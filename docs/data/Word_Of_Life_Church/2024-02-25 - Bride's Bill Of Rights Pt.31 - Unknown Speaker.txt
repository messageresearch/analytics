faithful and totally true some things have an element of Truth in them and some faithfulness but I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt Jesus is faithful and true even when we don't understand him he's faithful and true right amen God bless bless you let's turn today to 1 Corinthians chapter 1 if you would verse 5 I want to open this morning on our right to Fellowship our right to Fellowship First Corinthians chapter 1 verse 5 that in everything ye are enriched by Him in all utterance and in all knowledge now listen that in everything you are enriched and that is to give you Heavenly riches is what that means you are enriched by Him in all utterance what you speak and in all knowledge even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you so that you come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall also confirm you unto the end now this is what I want a double confirmation that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ friends what in the world could we ask for that would be any greater than that to be blame blameless how is that even possible it's not impossible it's not possible brother without God helping a mortal which mortal among us today or any that's ever lived on the earth could ever stand on their own and say I am blameless but yet that he that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ and listen to this verse n God is faithful by whom whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord listen again God is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord let's bow our hands together truly Lord Jesus these words are awesome how many hearts have they touched down Through the Ages since Paul wrote it to the church at Corinth so many years ago and here we stand today all these centuries later and we believe this with all of our hearts that we also have been called to the fellowship of your son Christ Jesus our lord I pray you would open our understanding as we Endeavor to look into the word today and see more of what you have purchased for us as your people bless us together father we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said am God bless you may be seated what a privilege to be called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord we know there's something about us as human beings that we we need Fellowship some people need it more than others of course some people like it more than others but we all need Fellowship it's something about us coming together even to eat brother brandom had a real insight actually I was reading it this week where he's talking about how that when people would come together that there was something about them coming together and eating that produced a real Fellowship that they would just get together and they would eat and then they would begin talking and fellowshipping and enjoying one another's company and that would be something within itself to be called into the fellowship of a great person most of us probably have had very few great people as far as the world would call great that we've ever been invited to their house that we've ever been invited to their table president vice president mayor Governor whoever it would be and yet for the people of the world to be identified in that and called well you've got an invitation to the governor's house and you've got one here and you've got one there you now most of us would be well we're going to let everybody and their brother know it I've been invited down to Mar Lago oh I've been invited to the White House I've been invited here and there and there and yet we have been invited to the personal fellowship with Jesus Christ the son of God and how is it that people with that invitation many of them never accept it they're not even interested whatsoever and some of those who say they are invited and say that they have accepted the invitation they still don't give him much personal Fellowship this is what they relate to fellowship with Jesus Christ the son of God church only so when they're in use Services we'll say or special meetings or uh twice a week whatever it is then they consider that Fellowship they're having fellowship with Christ Jesus well in one sense the word that is true but in this setting it's not just with the Lord Jesus that we're having Fellowship but we're having fellowship with one another but I want you to notice the way that Paul writes this he does not say that you're invited to the fellowship with Jesus Christ and his children but he says with Jesus Christ Our Lord self Fellowship personal Fellowship like this one on-one can be sometimes the most difficult Fellowship that Christians have a hard time relating to with the Lord Jesus and it's almost like they feel comfortable in his presence when they in him are amongst other people but they feel really really nervous with just Him and them alone and I understand that feeling I feel that way sometimes myself in his presence especially whenever it's so awesome and you're by yourself and there's just something about it it can be almost overwhelming to you it's quite intimidated to be in the presence of God Alone by yourself I mean that's what I'm talking about whenever you just get in that presence and there's no one else there but you and him there's something about it when we're together and you're in that presence and hundreds of others are there in that presence too and it seems like it doesn't bother us near as much but whenever we're by ourself and it's just us and him alone you ever go there to have fellowship with him and it seems like I have a hard time knowing what to say and how to approach him I'm not just talking at with your list you know all of our want list and all of our prayer requests and all of that that's not really Fellowship that's just making your request known to the Lord but whenever you change gears and you move from being able to bring your needs to the Lord and he wants us to do that and that whenever we are just fellowshipping with him so if you were sitting talking to your husband your wife son or daughter brother sister in the church and you was constantly asking them hey I've been meaning to ask you could I borrow $100 uh my car is tore up could I borrow your car and my tractor is tore up could I borrow your tractor my lawnmower is tore up could I borrow that I don't want your toothbrush don't worry about that I don't want your toothbrush but what about your mixer could I borrow your mixer and what about this and you say my goodness is that all you want from me you just constantly want things from me I I thought you loved me as a person and you wanted to be around me and you just enjoy talking to me well I wonder how sometimes that it makes the Lord feel whenever most of our prayers consist of our list so we have this list and that list and another list and when it really comes to just fellowshipping with him just talking to him and telling him how much you love him and what all he's done for you and what he means to you and how you can't wait to see him and you can't wait to be in his presence then you're really entering in to a place of Fellowship I I I personally believe this is more of what Paul was describing than he was our prayer list and our many needs and our many desires that it was actually a place that a person had been called into that personal intimate fellowship with the Lord Jesus I I've been privileged by the grace of God to be friends of many great preachers down through the decades that I've been a preacher myself and I count of a great honor to be friends of Great Men and I know that you know many of those friends and many of you are friends with them but in one way I have an advantage in that I have intimate fellowship with them so I can talk with them about what I'm going through they can talk with me about what they're going through and more than likely they would never do that with you they would because as lay members they just wouldn't do it but as preachers we have to have preachers on also that we can talk to and relate to and we can be able to discuss things and try to understand things and so we have that close fellowship and you know the Lord he has fellowship with the church he has fellowship with foolish virgins he has fellowship and will have fellowship with the 144,000 there would be people in the economy of God that will be allowed to come into the Great city of God walk down streets of gold but they will not be allowed to live there so they will come from time to time from New Moon Sabbath and so on and they will come and bring an offering unto the Lord but they will not be allowed to live in that City because the city is actually built for those who were called for close intimate Fellowship you see your walk on the earth actually reflects what where and how close you will live to him in the eighth day so it's not just that we will have this close intimate Fellowship here and then whenever we get there we get to go see him oh say once a year or something like that if there's anything like years there or we will get to go every now and then but depending on what you were called to do and how you're called to fellowship with him here in this life you're actually living out your future home right now so for those who really don't need that intimate fellowship with the Lord Jesus I mean they can go to church once a year you know that they talk to him once once every now and then and that they mainly he's just like a Sears and robu catalog house so they just going I need this I want that I want that I want I need I need I need I want I want but I I myself I like going to him with no request and I know that's hard to do in this day isn't it it's hard to go to where you just say what I've got this and that but there's times I go to him I do it on purpose I ask him for nothing I do not ask him for myself or for anyone else I go simply just to talk to him simply to be in his presence and for wait to him to speak back to me now maybe you don't understand where I'm coming from but I just desire to know him in a way in an intimate way of more than just him being this Almighty all powerful God that one day I'm going to meet and this distant sort of thing that he and I would have no I'm sorry I cannot handle that I've never had that walk with God and I sure don't want it now I want to know him in a way that I have never even known KN him before how many understand what I'm saying now as far as knowing him as Savior I know that knowing him as healer I know that but so do many others so do many others know him as saving them from sin but somehow another I feel I'm called to have something with him that is more than savior more than Redeemer notice this the prophet says in the beginning when man used to walk walk in the early age with God in the Garden of Eden when the first Man was created in the great Cathedrals Under The Palms he and his wife when the cool of the evening come along they came out and they worshiped God and they had a perfect Fellowship now listen what God actually wants we talk so much about what we want but let's see what God wants wants from people not from everyone I trust from us listen what God wants God Longs for Fellowship he yearns now listen to these words he Longs he yearns he wants who could ever imagine the almighty the Eternal long longing for anything that he himself could not provide yearning for something that he himself cannot provide wanting something that he himself he wanted a universe he made it he wanted trillions of planets he made them he wanted a multitudes of stars he made them he wanted angels He made them but he Longs for Fellowship but he didn't make just create Fellowship I'll just create fellowship and then I'll have it he Longs for something that only human beings can give it and if we don't give it to him he will never have it can you imagine the the Eternal putting himself in such a can I say it this way vulnerable position that he would bring himself to this spot to know that I want something that only humans can give me when humans are so frail they're so faithless they're so up and down and in and out and one day they're good and the next day they're not and one day they're faithful and the next day they're not and he would subject himself to wanting something not Angels now Angels would do it and gladly do so but he took this from Angels wormwood Michael I know you would give me this if I ask you for it you have been faithful since I created you aons of Ages ago but I yearn for something that you cannot give me Gabriel I yearn for something wormwood that you cannot give me I yearn for something Ariel that you cannot bestow to me what is it father what is it Fellowship love adoration I want to be adored I want to be loved by beings that will do it not because I make them but because I simply ask them God help us notice the prophet said God Longs for Fellowship he yearns listen what he wants us to do he wants people to speak with him to talk with him is that too much for us is that him asking too much brother Nathan that God would just want you to go around every day and say papa have I told you yet today how much I love you I just want you to know you mean everything to me you imagine the Angels there with all the finishing touches around the city and all that they're doing and papa says everybody stop everybody hush while I listen to my daughter as she Whispers love secrets to me listen at her listen at her oh from that heart that I redeemed from that soul that I purged she is pouring out the essence of something that you Angels cannot give you might sing too much you might preach too much sometime there's one thing you'll never be able to overdo that's pray the Bible said I would that men would pray everywhere lifting up holy hands you'll never be able to have too much fellowship with God God Longs for his creature who created in His image to fellowship with him but brother Donnie what what do I do do how do I do well how do you young people fellowship with one another you text you WhatsApp you zoom you do all these things you talk and when you get together and you hang together hang around together after service and you go eat and you have your meals together and you laugh and you cut up and you talk and is that enough for you uhuh some of y'all you're going to go eat after service you're going to come right back over here in this Fellowship Hall that we provided for you and some of you will be there till 8:00 9:00 tonight still fellowshipping still talking to one another because you enjoy being around one another I wonder how many days we make Jesus so lonesome anybody ever felt Lonesome you just feel Lonesome you just feel Lonesome you know what what I'm saying that there's times you can be around all kinds of people and still feel Lonesome because the combati ability issue is just you know people's doing this or that or the other and you just don't enjoy doing that sort of thing and you you try to talk and they don't want to talk to you and you just feel so alone can you imagine in an Earth with a population of 7 billion people on the Earth and I wonder how many of them every day they get up and they are making it part of their main goal and purpose to Fellowship personally with almighty God to talk to him to love him to let him know he is their everything they're waiting for the day when he is going to come gather them together he Longs for them to speak to him oh he said when I get there brother dony I want to he don't want you to wait till that long at your service today I pray that we leave this place and we look at our fellowship with God in a way that we never have before think of the moments that we spend with a crazy phone in our hand on Instagram and Tik Tok and looking at this and looking at that how many of you people sat with these deals in your hands and you're playing video games and going through all kinds of foolishness just absolute foolishness a waste of time and do you even give God five minutes five minutes not of asking of fellowshipping or fellowshipping how are you Jesus I love you I haven't told you enough today I just want to let you know you mean everything to me I know I say it a lot to you but truly you are my bride and Morning Star you're the lily of my valleys you help me when I'm down and when I'm weary you said brother dony how could that mean anything to him it's the way he chose to do it now we live in the south thank God all you Yankees can have the north as far as I'm concerned but you know you go through the drivethru hello honey Hello darling hello sweetheart well that little sweetheart right there don't like him women at the drivethru calling her swe sweetheart sweetheart you know everybody's buddy have a nice day buddy hey buddy how are you buddy a lot of them people ain't your buddy and they ain't my buddy but what is it becomes a way that people do I'd rather be like that some of y'all been up in the north you know how they are they don't even say thank you I mean it's like you got to pull you're pulling teeth to get a thank you out of them but can you imagine God yearning how many's ever yearned for something and longed for it I wonder how many days of my 67 years that God has yearned yearned to hear from me more than he did and at the end of the day I disappointed him when I laid down and the last one I spoke to was him the first one I speak to when I wake up but I could have give him so much more time and he yearned and he was like waiting Donnie Donnie Smith Jonathan as you Rob got any time for me just personal time not asking stuff you'll never be able to have too much fellowship with God God Longs for his creature who he created in His image to fellowship with him wouldn't you have loved to live in that time when the Great Fellowship God had with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to come down in the cool of the evening and talk with them and fellowship with him wouldn't that be marvelous we would all like to have that time now I Believe by God's word I can prove to you when we come right back on them terms again with God tonight right straight back to that kind of a Fellowship so I want you to think what are we going to do when we get to heaven I think of it no grocery stores no Walmarts no TJ Maxx no gabes no malls no football games no baseball games no soccer no TV so a lot of the things that we occupy our time with they won't even be there no airplanes no vacations cuz it is one great big vacation so think of it what are we going to do and not be bored some of you cannot set 15 minutes I watch people in a doctor's office and I watch people I'm just an observer people can hardly set for five minutes I've timed them without getting their phone out of their pocket how many people people do you ever sit and watch and just notice as they think and just meditate in this day we're living people can't hard to do it they cannot hardly do it the attention span has so dropped since people started watching television and movies years ago they could hold your eyes on the exact same scene in a movie for 10 times longer than what they can now but the attention span of people is so fast and gets away from them they have to constantly change the scenes in order to keep people's attention it's sad to say it's the same way in church it's the same way when it comes to reading the Bible the same way with listen to tapes the same way with reading a message book we've got to be going doing here there there there and we don't realize our attention span for God is getting less and less and less I wonder how many of us don't raise your hand but meditate I wonder how many of us children of God meditate Brother Don that's crazy no actually the Bible tells you to do it to meditate on him and think on him just lay your phone down brother Fred and sister B Mullen my dear precious friends they've got a a rule in their house so when the kids the grandkids when all of them come in they've got a basket sitting on the bar it is a deposit for everybody's cell phone now I know some of you is going to Pooch your lip at and you're going to get real quiet on me some of y'all is just as addicted to your cell phone as a drunk is to alcohol and you can't stand it without having that thing in your hand you've got a ding for this and a ping for that and this for that you got 47 notifications and you know what every one of them are and you cannot hardly stand it if one of them things goes off and you don't pick it up and look at it and Jesus is dinging and knocking and pulling and longing and begging and we don't even answer behold I stand at the door and no and if any man will open unto me I will come unto him and Su you know what that means it's short for supper Jesus wants to have supper with you and breakfast and your 10:00 snack and your 11:15 snack and your 11:55 snack and then your 12:00 lunch he wants to be such a part of our Lives you said brother T why are you telling this this believe it or not I'm trying to get you ready for the Rapture I think when the Rapture comes all it simply does is takes our soul changes us from within and if we're alive gives us a body which matches our soul and we will take our current status straight to heaven thank Lord so for bored and going to church bored and singing bored in praying bored in worshiping bored in fellowshipping what are we going to do when we get to the marriage supper AT&T ain't there Verizon ain't there WhatsApp ain't allowed at Jesus table so what in the world are we going to do what are we going to do we're going to worship we're going to praise we're going to adore now think of it when we've been there for 135 trillion years we've no less days to sing his praise than when we first begun how what in the world is going to occupy all of our time him it will take Eternity for him to still be unveiling who he is and what he is and how great he is and how great his love is for us so if you get bored hearing about him you don't want to go to heaven my friend notice this Paul goes on to say let me read the latter part of this I skipped one I'm sorry dedication of the building to the Lord in Cleveland 19 U 59 he said then being the Church of God God ordained a certain place for these people to meet and were they would be Fellowship because God longs to fellowship with his people and among his people I wonder when he showed up at church this morning what he had on his heart I wonder what Jesus wants to make this service for us today it's not about what I think the service should be and it's not about what you think it should be it's about what he wants it to be right so he showed up here this morning to have fellowship and to be among us that we also could Fellowship back to him now the fellowship varies according to what part of the service that we're in so whenever the service starts and then we start with the prayer requests and things like that and then we go to singing and then we're entering into praise and worship and singing songs then we will hear the prayer request someone will come up and pray and then we might sing another song and then we'll have some special songs and each one of those things will open up a different opportunity for you to be able to squeeze in this little private time with you and the Lord then when it comes time for the word what do we do preacher gets up reads the text goes to L out what God's put on his heart well when know most generally during that time it's not their perp time for everybody to be up running around jumping hollering shouting while the word's going forth is that right but yet you have a time while the word is is going force to be able to say thank you Jesus Lord that's what I need thank you for your word Lord anoint a man of God father give me what I need help me Lord you see every part of the service should be an opportunity to where we can enter into Fellowship now whenever I'll close here shortly then I I'll I'll offer prayer maybe somebody's got a need we'll offer prayer for them we'll start singing together again to worship the Lord what for to give you a time to where we can recreate our own personal little Garden of Eden when I enter these doors I'm not sure what you think about when you come in I want this to be as close to Eden as it can possibly be in this life before the restoration to where when Papa comes down and he he says my children how was your stay on Earth today now we could start at the top and give all of our complaining list and all of our griping list well it wasn't good at church it wasn't good at work it wasn't good at school and this wasn't good and that wasn't good and I'll agree there's a lot of things in this world that ain't good but if you spend all your time looking for what ain't good you ain't going to find no time to look for what is good we got trouble we got heartache we got all kinds of things to deal with but every person into this building today has got so much to thank him for you're alive aren't you you've got hands where you can raise up a voice you can talk you've got feet to be able to walk you've got something that God's done for you has all of us got something to praise God for oh Paul says God is faithful by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord Ephesians 3:9 to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God who created All Things by Christ Jesus so Paul identifies that there had been a a dispensational change with the preaching of the Cross and it had been hid in God and he identified it in these terms here The Fellowship of the mystery so there is a fellowship then of the mystery now the Greek word here is Mysterion it is something that is made known only to the initiated we in one sense Are Spiritual Mystics because something has been made known to us it's not made known to everyone not made known to The Sinner oh they hear about the cross and they hear about the blood but the mystery has not been personally made known to them once the mystery comes open that he died for you that he has redeemed you that birs you into the mystery of the fellowship ship so then it is more than a head knowledge oh yeah I know about the cross I know about the blood I know about all that I know about all that it shows by your attitude you know very little about it because you don't just know it by understanding notice again in 1 John 1:3 that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ how in the world could John be able to project that human beings could have fellowship with God in the same way they have fellowship with one another and God's in another dimension God in this great place called Heaven notice again he says 1 John 1:6 if we say then that we have fellowship with him and we walk in darkness we do lie we lie rather and do not the truth now so the people who say today oh I'm saved I'm a Christian and I have fellowship with God if they walk in darkness they are not telling the truth so you see whenever we walk in fellowship with him we must walk in the light as he is in the light and we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin if you notice the setting of John when he write said he's not talking about just us fellowshipping with one another but we're walking in fellowship with him you see the fellowship that Abraham had with God whenever God was able to try him and God was able to try job and the prophet tells us the reason that God had confidence in job was because him and job had been fellowshipping fellowshipping yes sir and no doubt there's people here today and you have close friends in our church and you may know things about them that no one else knows you may know weaknesses cuz they confide in you what is that Fellowship we've all of course been betrayed by people that we felt like we could confine in and they went and told it ain't that right but we know that there are true friends that don't do such a thing and God and job had been fellowshipping job was unaware of the testimony service that been held in heaven and in this testimony meeting it was God testifying about his servant it's something when we testify of God it's another thing when God testifies of us so in the testimony meeting in heaven God had told the devil said hey you considered my servant job there ain't a man like him and all the Earth the devil said well of course you baby him you give him this you give him that you do this at the other forign but you let me touch him I'll tell you one thing I'll make him deny you to your face I'll make him curse you I'll do this and that and the other and God said you can't do it ain't no way no you can't do it how in the world could God be so confident because him and job was buddies him and job had such Fellowship together that God knew him can God say about you he is my buddy she is my friend I know her so well I know her I know him we have Fellowship daily praise God anybody hearing me today 1 John 1 seven but if we walk in the light as he is in the light notice not as he is the light but as he is in the light if we walk with him fellowship with him as he is in the light you've got to catch him in the right light in order to have the right of Fellowship brother Melvin he must be in the light of the season and he is you can't fellowship with him in this hour under the light of Luther's Reformation that was the light of that day come on somebody you can't fellowship with him in the light of him under methodism that was a great move of God but we're not living in that age no more we must come to where he is we must find him in the light and there we can Fellowship oh oh praise God if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin oh how God longs to Fellowship praise the Lord I don't mind telling you there's an element of God that I fear the there's things about God's presence that alarms me as a human I've sensed him since I was a little boy I've heard him speak to me many times I've even heard him audibly a few times it's never happened to me that it does not terrify me and people think blessings is God's glory and yet the prophet tells us every time the angel comes come to him it would leave him numn and create this element of fear remember when Daniel saw him he fell at his feet was sick for many days John said when he laid his right hand on me he said that he passed out remember that book of Revelation chapter 1 so there's something about the presence of God that can seem unapproachable an element of the Devine mind that it would cause human beings to tremble of course your mind's running through all different scriptures in the Bible especially in the Old Testament when they would come into the courts of the presence of God and they would tremble and shake the people of Israel saw the Mountain of God as it trembled and Shook and they said don't let God speak to us God said I will raise them up a prophet so there is an element of God's presence that can be very fearful and scary but remember God will never bring you into the court of his divine presence beyond what you are capable of relating to so he will allow you to come into His courts and into his presence to the degree to match your call and your position in him I would never be able to go where the prophets did I would never be able to go where John was I'd never be able ago no doubt where Paul did is that right and no doubt many of you would not because I'm not made thus so I I don't have that fear but I know in my own personal boundary with God that there is that that line that that narrow escape to where I come into His presence and I sense him come near and and it it it alarms me oh I'm alarmed about it right now just talking about it because there's something about him that is so overwhelming to us Mortals but I'm longing for the day when that will be lifted from me because Adam never experienced that Adam never felt that when God come down every day in the cool of the day he never felt alarm he never felt fear he never felt what we would feel when we come deeply into his presence it was just this welcoming something and the same day it was over and over and over again and father would say children I've come down to kiss you good night and he would lay Adam down and lay Eve on his arm as he would stretch his arm out to be her pillow and he would stoop down and kiss Adam as it were good night and Eve good night and say good night my children Papa's come down to tuck you in I'll see you in the morning when you get up they didn't have to lock the door they had no doors to lock they didn't have to set their security system there was no security system the night did not do to them what the night does to us there's something about the night that can be frightening is that right the night sounds I'll never forget as I was in Zimbabwe several years ago there in some meetings and I was able to go on a on a safari a hunt while I was there and the guy told me he said now you're going to stay in this little thing it was a little round sort of a structure not very big oh I don't I don't know say say 12 14 fet maybe something like that built like like a circle and he said now we've got a leopard that's out here roaming around at night and you may hear it but just don't go outside I thought are you kidding me I ain't darkening out this door I might have been born in the morning but it wasn't this morning so sure enough in the night I was awakened by this Str strange and peculiar sound that I'd never heard now the African night as the sun goes to set the baboons go to making their noises and all the rest of the animals which I'm not aware of our brother and sister here and sister hope from Kenya they could tell you about it so I I heard this peculiar sound well I'm from Kentucky right I didn't know what leopard sound like so I wake up and when I do a a chill goes all over my entire body my hair is standing up on the back of my neck on my arms and the disadvantage was they had no locks on those doors now I'm thinking this is the wrong dispensation this is the wrong dispensation for no locks so I laid there and I laid there for quite some time while I'm hearing the sound well the next morning I mean needless to say I didn't sleep much the rest of the night I can imagine myself going down the esophagus of this leopard having raw preacher for supper so the next morning I mentioned to the guy and I said I think I heard that leopard he could hear the excitement of course in my voice he said what it sound like well I replicated it he laughed real big and said that was an ante eater well I didn't know if an eaters can eat humans or not I me that didn't make no difference to me all I knew was what I heard but when Adam and Eve would lay down at night sha would come over and laid down by him imagine the big African line the black man Big woy Man on him and he would just lay down and said come here Papa would R him on the man he just Adam would say Good night darling good night sweetheart I'll see you in the morning they wake up didn't have a Temperpedic Mas mattress but no wakes in the back they would get up and they say how'd you sleep well they couldn't sleep anyway but just perfect so I said what do you want for breakfast this morning maybe maybe that fruit to this fruit cuz they were not remember they were not meat eaters the animals were not carnivorous everything was eating vegetation so they'd get up and start today it was just the same thing over and over and over again in the evening time they knew it was about right they didn't have a watch but they knew it was about time for him to come down I could just see them as they was pacing back and forth and anxious is it about church stuff yeah it won't be long and this light would appear in the bushes and maybe just a slight little breeze would start blowing the leaves and they'd sense this great aura of the almighty my children how was your day oh papa it was perfect thank you for letting us live here or you're welcome I made this just for you you like it oh we love it so much I believe we are closer than any generation that's ever been to stepping back into that Garden again so I ask you why would you not want to love him and fellowship and adore with him more now than in your entire life what will it be friends oh he didn't he didn't make them fall he couldn't but he allowed a means by which they could fall in order to make his attributes more fully expressed and remember that same being crawled underneath the garden gate as we would say would love to crawl underneath the Gate of your life the Gate of our church our place that God has given us and to go to Whispering and talking to try to pull you out of fellowship with God I pray that God will help each of us that we can understand we are here for more than driving a truck building buildings painting walls finishing wood laying carpet we are here for an eternal purpose do you understand in heaven when we get there you will not be employed there will be no real estate sales he owns it all there will be no grocery stores as I said before there will be no industry there will be no industry what will we be doing it'll be a continuation of this same life we will come back back to the Garden of Eden again remember in the Garden of Eden before the fall God led the man there and he was just to do light listen light work just to tend the garden people make fun of me cause I like Gardens that was the original employment of the first man now life don't you understand it began in a garden the price started to be paid in another Garden The Garden of Gethsemane it will end in another one and let me give you an overview as I stop momentarily the city will descend from God out of heaven in a pyramidal shape the angle of descent up the walls of the city for people in glorified bodies you'll hardly feel yourself walking up an angle at all the Earth by this time will have been changed all the excretions all of the scars all of the things that even the Earth holds this day up in newand several miles thick they still find these sea creatures several miles deep in the Earth but in the Eighth Day all of that memory of the past the echos skeleton and all the record of her past sins will be annihilated holy far from God out of heaven will come and change this planet like he changed you by the Holy Ghost and John said I saw the new city the New Jerusalem descending from God out of Heaven as a bride adorned for her husband so it will come and set down on the earth and John said I saw no more sea and there will land this 1500 M Square City it will be built on an angle of ascent and the paradises of God will be built up like this John saw a throne and him that sat on the throne was like an unto a Jasper and a sarden stone and the River of Life proceeded out from under the Throne of God it'll start at the Throne of God it'll trickle down in our Gardens behind our houses here will come the river as it comes out from the throne and the water will Branch down and start trickling down all the way down all the way down all the way down to the bottom age the Ephesian age and then it'll start recirculating again all the way back up to the top and what age is it you all live in remind me Leo to seventh age guess where you get to reside right up at the top he will Crown your life living in hell by letting you live for eternity at the top of the city so I ask you is it worth it yes living out on the breadth of the earth will be those who are saved the nations of the earth and they will come in from time to time and bring fruits of their labors into the order of MDC the priesthood of God for we will be there as part of the temple of God on the earth remember John said I looked and I saw no Temple why the lamb is the temple the father is the temple and there will be his bride who loves to fellowship and she fellowshipped with him so much in life she loved him more than riches she loved him more than sin she loved him more than anything else in the world and he said because of that I give you an eternal inheritance in this city guess what there are no U-Haul trucks in that place so you won't be moving from the seventh floor to the first floor to the third floor to the fifth floor some of you's moved all of your life you better move while the moving's good CU you're going to come to a SP a spot you won't be moving no more coming down through the mainstream of the River of Life and there would be trees on either side of the river and they will bring forth their fruits and they'll change their fruits 12 times in the year and their leaves will be for the healings of the Nations so the Nations that live out on the face of the Earth will come in to worship and they'll come in to the bride City and they'll reach up and pull off a leaf off the tree of life and they'll hand it over to their neighbor King and say we fought for one another's blood one time on the Earth but now we don't fight no more and the leaves are for the healings of the Nations setting up on the top of the throne will be the human body of God which has been glorified and hanging above him will be the father which is not a man this great light so Jesus will be our Joseph and there he will sit on the throne and when we walk up to the throne he will be emanating these lights Rays coming out as beings but you'll be changed don't worry you won't fear you to you'll be able to walk up in that light and as it hits your face it'll reflect back off of you and the people that's coming up will see where you have been cuz you're of his priesthood you'll smell like him you'll look like him your face will glisten with his image that he has shared with you this will be part of your reward this will be part of your glory he will share his shakai with you through eternity and the people that live on the earth will walk in and they'll look at you and say they they they live in his presence every day look at him they look like him I saw that same Glory from the throne as I walked up there oh what an honor it must be what a privilege it must be to live in your every day why cuz in life you were what he learn yearned for you are what he longed for and in eternity he gets you every day for eternity Lord God who are we Lord that you would yearn for our fellowship who are we lord God that you would long to spend time with us I think of brothers sisters family whether it's a human family or the Divine family Lord willing Carol and I'll be leaving month from today to fly down to New New Zealand to be there for Easter meetings Brother David sister Susan brother Andrew Donaldson the Saints in New Zealand some of the Saints from Australia different Saints in the Pacific been about 20 years or so since I've been there so I'm longing to see them

children we will leave here and fly to Los Angeles and then 13 hours from Los Angeles to oam New Zealand it'll be a very difficult flight very very hard to be on a plane that long and yet all we have to do to fellowship with you is ask you it's not like you have to fly a million miles away but we just call upon your name and you're here oh Jesus my God my king I Love You Lord I'm so glad when they told me of that story about you as a little boy I heard it I'm glad the story hasn't grown old Lord I'm so glad I still love to fellowship with you I pray I always will maybe there's some here today
