glory through US father in Jesus name amen I'm Miss in love of Jesus today amen praise the Lord Hebrews chapter 2 Hebrews chapter 2:14 certainly like to wish all of our mothers today a Happy Mother's Day may God bless you I appreciate our mothers that make such a sacrifice for the children don't you realizing what a great responsibility that they have and what God has called them to be and what they give so many many years of their life to try to help mold their children and shape something in their children that the Lord can be proud of it's a great work to be a Godly mother it's a great work Hebrews chapter 2:14 I'd like to speak to you today again on human weakness for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren amen that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people may the Lord bless his words you may be seated I believe if we had a full understanding of these verses that we have just read our lives would never be the same two look at the stepping down or the condenscending of what our lord Jesus did for us I think it would set something within us that it would change Us by looking at what he become truly a revelation is something that it's an identifying and a making known The Book of Revelation of course the Greek word apocalypsis which is making known the other word that is used for Revelation is feneral which is to make manifest so it is something that declares or something that makes real I'm always Leary myself of any so-called Revelation that exalts human flesh and doesn't exalt the Lord Jesus I just don't understand that it's being Revelation from God but yet when I I look at him and see the condensing or the stepping down that he did and I think why what was the ultimate reason that he would do such a thing to prove that he could do it he's greater than that he doesn't just do things alone just to prove well I can do it I'll create a fish just so I can prove that I can I'll make a world so I can show that I can do it I'll make a sun I'll make a universe I'll make a moon I'll make all these things just so that I can do it just for the fun of it no that God don't do things in that way certainly to project himself and his characteristics is the things that he desires but you look at the overall picture of of him stepping down to become what he did and you think truly it was more than just to prove that he could do it it was more than just saying well I'm I'm going to do this so that I can show what I can do but it was something of a greater far more outreaching program that God had in his mind of course that was much of that was you and I that he desired to have a family you see he thought of himself and he not only thought of himself but he thought of you becoming tangible and he didn't want Just One of a Kind or one of this certain species that would be particularly perfect but he wanted a whole family an entirety of of of creation on the earth that would live like this and would be actually in the perfect image of a God man but think that God wanted to project it in such a way could have brought it by creation he could have said let there be and let there be another son and let there be another daughter and let there be another son and let there be another daughter and truly it would have been right there but the spoken word if he would have took his book of life the family Book of Life the Lamb's Book of Life which had the brides names written there inscribed before the foundation of the world and would have spoke them by the word and said let them be let them be let them be let them be but yet when he got done speaking there would have never been anybody to live outside the city amen there would have never been any Heathen of Psalms 2 that would have been given the opportunity to be able to make their choice in the time of the Millennium there would have never been millions of people of John 3:16 Christians and that's as far as they would go so myself I'm grateful that he did didn't just call from The Book of Life and speak the bride's names and create them and leave everybody else out but it expresses a greatness of his being that he would go beyond his own kind and offer this grace and and Waters of life and mercy to those which are not of his own species of his own kind you know it expresses the grace of God that he would be so willing to condem sin to be made like un to his Brethren that's a great thing Amen to be become flesh because his brothers was going to become flesh that's a great thing but to extend Grace to a a people which are not even of your own kind to extend the the love and the mercy of God that when he died upon the cross and he would actually let them which are not of his own genos his own kind he would let them come and actually partake a a part of reconciliation and a part of redemption that he would let them come and have let them have a Salvation a salvation by his blood now think about it you know that the profound wisdom of God knowing that the brides names was on the book and that he would redeem them because only the elect can actually be fully redeemed but he would divide Redemption from salvation and let some folks be saved which are not redeemable and actually save them from their sins and save them from what they were born into and yet he come to save to save many of those who were not even in that Lamb's Book of life and give them the opportunity or you're talking about Mercy you talking about the grace of God friend and you sing how that God so desired to express himself in such a way and this is why we should never limit our love just to our family or just our church or just our message because we're not displaying the full attribute of God when we behave in such a way if you can love only your family and only your friends there's something wrong with your love if you can love only the folks that come to this church and even this message there's something wrong with your life you don't understand God [Applause] yet let me read this to you in the Masterpiece paragraph 79 The Perfect Image the God man The Perfect Image the God man amen God in aor had changed from Supernatural to the vision and the vision was projected into the image and the image was smitten so that the supernatural could taste the feeling of death God's perfect Masterpiece now as we mentioned last night truly the world the Jews even many that were not Jews that heard the Messianic prophecies they had heard them talked about for many many years and no doubt they had it figured out in their mind what the Messiah would be what kind of an individual he would be but when he appeared it was in such a simple humble way and if God had not broke past the veil of humanity it was so simple even the elect would have stumbled over it but God Desiring that the elect would see it so he opened up opened up and revealed a part of himself by which they would be able to connect and you think the perfect man now is not a man which is divine only but the perfect image that God had in his mind was a mixture of divinity and humanity and the world looking for a Napoleon a Hitler a conqueror that would be able to come down but when God projected that God chose through the simple humility of human weakness and human Frailty that God would allow himself to live in mortal flesh and the word mortal mean liable to deaths that God would humble himself to be a mere man and walk upon the face of this Earth he would humble himself to the death of the Cross he would humble himself to become a curse a sinner in the eyes of God it now what does that humility in turn do for us Lift us up and give us the big head I'm afraid we everen received it if it does I'd like to read to you again the scripture that we read last night in 2 Corinthians 12:7 Paul after being can translated or carried by Vision however it was into the third heaven he said lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations that was given unto me a thorn in the in the flesh soul don't need a thorn Soul's converted but a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me now you think of the of the the spirit of God moving on this man's heart and him being afflicted by this thing and he prays three times that God would deliver him but instead of delivering him God says I'm going to give you Grace to deal with this and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for my strength is made perfect in my strength is made perfect in weakness it doesn't even make sense how could almighty God and his great power be completed perfected in weakness and you you see friend the reason that it's so hard for us to comprehend is because we're thinking of the human side and we think of Heroes and we think of you know my goodness as a little boy when I was raised in a home that had a television so I knew all the heroes at my my time frame you know I'm sure they've all changed since now but I knew Superman and Batman and Tarzan and I've swung on the grap Vines we live back near the woods there in Kentucky and I've went out many a day and chopped out with an axe or a hand ax or something like that and cut a great Vine Lord some of these kids look at me like I'm from Prime evil time yes sir I've swung on many of them and screamed like a wild ape I have and many of you probably done the same thing and yet rode an old stick horse like the wrong Ranger and whatever more why because there something always in us that look for a hero not today they've got an NBA star or a football star or this star or that star I wonder who was better off me as Tarzan or them as some basketball player but you realize there's always something we look for heo but if we're not careful movies and books and the drama of the world will shape in our mind what a real hero is when in reality it's nothing but a fabrication of a bunch of devils that's trying to take away the truth of what a genuine hero is in the eyes of God and you see no doubt they had seen many of them I mean the back of me a different man that they felt like was a great hero in their time and they would all come and do the same thing try to liberate the Jews try to bring them a Time freedom but when year the Messianic promise comes on the earth and they are looking for a hero and God sends them a baby who in the world would ever think of that why why spend all those years growing up when God made Adam he did not make a baby he made a man why would God start then with this one and make him a baby that's right because all of his brothers was going to be babies all of his brothers was going to grow up as teenagers so he didn't want to skip the pre-teen years nor the know itall smart elic teenage [Applause] years I'm sure some of you never had all of that neither did he want to skip the early 20s why didn't God give him the holy ghost at 15 why didn't God give him the holy ghost at 20 he wanted to live through the 20s he wanted to be mid 20s he want to come to the late 20s and then when he comes to the age of 30 which is the age of the office of the high priest then God chooses to give him the Holy Ghost praise the Lord so all of those years he lives a mortal life as Mortals would live Lord Jesus without the Holy Ghost I know some of our message folks have a hard time but I can't help it that's your problem at ain't M now notice here Paul says that my strength quoting God is made perfect in weakness and let me reiterate it again for those of you that W with us last night the word strength is dunamis which is ability inherit power power residing In A Thing by virtue of its nature now I want you to think if you would have been God and you would have come down and lived on this Earth for 33 and A2 years could you have kept who you were hid for all that time you see there's something about the vanity of human flesh we want folks to know who and what we are could we have kept it head would the devil know two days after you got here who you was I honestly believe friend Brother D before we come out I really believe with all of my heart God would do more for us and manifest himself in a greater way if we could learn to keep our mouth shut sometimes about what he deals with us about but God will show us a little something deal with us a little bit more go around telling everybody in the Brother come on now Church a lot of the things God don't want you to tell he wants it between you and him not everybody else but we want to brag about it and let everybody know what we are and we're cutting oursel off from further experiences but he lives such a life Veil in such humility that Satan looked right at him and never knew who he was so God's Dynamite is made perfect in weakness that's right tell me how how can it be a Son of God a daughter of God can get cancer in their body it rages it attacks organs tissues muscles bones their family sees them going down day by day by day week by week they're praying they're begging God God heal them God please but instead of healing God gives Grace and day by day their family watches them go down and go down and they're believing for a miracle asking for a miracle begging for a miracle but instead of a miracle God gives Grace amen look like to the world that's not a heroic death you know why we don't understand Heroes our mind is filled with Superman our mind is filled with Batman and Roy Rogers and all those sort of things come on now The Lone Ranger we need to get a bunch of that junk out of our mind and realize real heroes follow the word and they many times die died in weakness they died in humiliation they lived their whole life in humiliation and yet God said these are my heroes oh Hallelujah I wonder when we walk down the streets of gold and we go to shaking hands with God's heroes brother B said if you ever get there you'll walk down the streets of gold beside some of the weakest people that ever lived on this Earth but God Dynamite was manifested in the greatest Way by blowing up cardboard boxes which would be easier to blow up this morning this body of Flesh or this concrete building here blocks stick a stick of dynamite you wouldn't take a stick just take an M80 firecracker and stick in my ear won't be much left right th which should prove the greatest power in flesh or a concrete block of red oak but God says that's not the way I look at it Donnie I look at it that I fill a human being with my Dynamite I load them up with dynamite and I ignite their fuse with a baptism of the Holy Ghost and every day of their life they're exploding bringing their flesh bringing their Ambitions bringing their desire bringing all of that and there be days that they'll actually fail there'll be days that they'll succumb to the flesh but the end result is the flesh will be absolutely overcome now you and I think oh no that's not the greatest power the greatest power is when God said let there be and the word went out of his mouth and an Adam split apparently he don't agree with you now here's the man who' done that and he told Paul he said Paul oh look I made the world I'm the one who made atoms I'm the one who created the universe but I have found the greatest display of my power is when I express it in human weakness my strength is made perfect in weakness and weakness is infirmity disease sickness infirmity of the body its native weakness and Frailty want of strength and capacity and truly Paul had a stick of dynamite to go off in his brain for Paul said in verse N9 he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore yes will I glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me look at this word rest it's to pick a [Applause] tent the hoopah has arrived Glory Paul said that the glory of God that God might pitch a tent over me here's the bride's tent meeting for him GL here's the third PO for the bride here's the t i long is when the almighty will pitch his te over [Applause] me but notice how you'll do it in weakness infirmities Necessities Lord now how many still wants the tent pitched over you ah not near as many interested now didn't think there would be now if God was handing out folks today God said I need people in Happy Valley I want somebody to go down the seeding and I want you to go down to Wala Lake I'm going let somebody walk on the water and God said I want somebody else to go over to the river where there's people out there fishing and I want to let somebody Walk On The Water there and I need somebody to go to the hospital cuz I'm going to empty out the hospital in Elizabethan and I want somebody to go to the medical center I'm going to empty out the medical center and then God would say now for the important things is there anybody that would be willing that if you got some terrible disease in I ch was not to heal you would there be anybody willing to Bear there for me would there be anybody left or would all of us be at the hospit Elizabeth and all of us at the hospit at the med center want to do the great things for God would you done hit your car door poping your door lock said glory to God I'm going to go down walk on Lake while talk man I'm going to show them what God can do I'm going down to the river I'm going to walk on the river do we understand friends what greatness really is do we understand how God's dunamus is is perfected completed tellos brought to it finish the finishing of God's great creative power will consummate in a bride on this Earth that allows him to do what he chooses you see in a parallel of this in 1 Corinthians chapter 7:1 Paul dealing with the married man and woman he says to to shun or flee fornication we look at this Wednesday night Lord will let let every man have his own wife and he says go on down to verse two and verse three says that the man has not power over his body but the woman and the woman has not power over her body but the man so the marriage vow actually renders your control of your own body to your mate now that's the Bible right now this is even natural marriage this is why that we we do not believe in committing adultery or polygamy because your body don't belong to you it belongs to your wife or vice versa all right now if the natural marriage does that what about the spiritual marriage to Christ the word then if my body belongs to him and he chooses to allow a thorn a thorn to prick me do I have really any say think about it think about it notice in verse 10 I mean this this really done something something to Paul therefore I take pleasure in infirmities Lord have mercy I said it last night I said it again today I need help with this verse maybe all of y'all are there except for me so y'all pray for me that I'll get right but I ain't here yet I I I don't always take pleasure in infirmities I don't always take pleasure and things even when he assures me that he's mindful of it and he knows what's going on and he he's aware of everything that's happening I still don't always enjoy it but this Brother D was more than a scripture to Paul it released something to Paul friends we don't just need to hear the scripture quoted we don't need to just memorize it we need something released out of this word that Paul had released to him that will do for us what it done for him I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then am I wonderful strong hallelujah how so how so how can I be strong when I am weak how can it be that I'm getting greater when I'm getting weaker and acknowledging that I am more dependent on him than I've ever been in my life those of you here today in this service and you're lost I honestly don't know how you live one hour without God in your life well you say I'm not dependent on religion I ain't dependent on religion either I'm depending on a person I don't want religion I want salvation but the more I serve him the more I realize how much I need him I don't trust my decisions in life I don't trust my ability the older I get the more I feel like a child when it comes to him I mean well brother Don you're getting SE now I don't think it's that I think it's I'm learning how to surrender notice this in Hebrews 11:32 Paul says for what I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barak and of Samson of jepta of David also and Samuel and the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made that's right God anointed Moses and he stretched his Rod over the Red Sea my done through Joshua the Great Signs and miracles that was God's power but God's greatest power and conquering ability was going to be when he projected himself in human weakness growing with a headache get sick get nauseated and vomiting and get weary and get get upset like we do and have frustrations in life and yet the whole universe was created by his word and when that word come down in flesh oh Lord when it was embodied in flesh it took on the weakness of Flesh look with me if you would in the book of Hebrews again chapter 1 look at what he was now amen Hebrews chapter 1: 2 Paul speaking about God hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son by whom he has appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds so the son the logos the logos was the instrument by which God made not World singular worlds plural and when that logos cond incend into the bodily form of a human being it took on such weakness amen and Frailty look at verse three who being in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person now this is what Jesus was in his existence before his Incarnation the brightness of his glory my if we could have went back before the Throne of God and so the saw the mighty L God as God condens sins and goes to Breaking himself down into the realm of creation and as logos goes out of it and plays around the father's door as a little white light yet when that Loos is made human we never have one witness in the scripture that that white light ever emanate out of his fingers out of his hands out of his eyes as a matter of fact there's never any Earthly identification that that white light ever appeared when he was on the Earth the Lord that's greatness expressing humility now notice Paul says that he was the who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person Jesus was not The Express image of God's body cuz God doesn't have a body he was the express image of his person I love this word express it's character the instrument used for Engraving or carving the exact expression the image of a person or a thing a mark likeness a precise reproduction in every respect a fimile a fact Jesus was the fact of God in a human body glory to God hallelujah how many knows what a facts is when you take a document or a piece of paper and you run it through a machine human instrumentality and you dial a phone number and you send that person in a matter of seconds on the other end and they've got a fax machine and they receive that image on the other end except unlike human fax machines sometimes ARS are blurred and the images aren't clear but when God facts the logos and the logos came down to the Earth it was a precise image of the invisible image of God hallelujah the brightness of his GL the express image of his person so God fed himself let me let you in on something the faxes didn't stop at the River on the day of Pentecost there's 120 machines up there and they got a fact from Heaven too the same image not of God's body not of God's flesh but of God's person God faxed into Peter the image of the invisible God [Applause] who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power now look this is not logos this is Rama look at the difference in Rama and logos logos is thought concept look at Rama that which is or has been uttered by a living voice that's right you see we can take the thought of God written down on paper and repeat the logos over and over and over and over again but you know when this word actually becomes real when it becomes Rama but it's spoke by a living voice then if God drops it in your heart and the doctors say you ain't got the two days to live but God drops it in your heart I am healed and RMA takes a hold of that word it don't make no difference what the doctor said or anybody else says why it is spoken by a living voice not just by memory we're depending friends too much I'm afraid on memorization of the scripture and memorization of the message and we need some Rama we need the word spoken by a live voice of our souls you see this word express here that Paul chose to use it's not used anywhere else in the New Testament it's not used anywhere else it's the Greek word from which we get our English word from character ABCs amen like ABCs and ones and twos and threes it's something by which is used to express an image now as a man he ate but by the word he created food now he came in the form of a servant but he's the express image of God he's the facts of God Amen but God faxed it into a human body and sometimes itd be the human body and sometimes it'd be the facts [Applause] Hallelujah notice Paul says in verse three who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had purged notice this by himself purged our sins not the blood of bulls and goats now the word Purge is expiated that's right expe and the literal rendering is having made purification of our sins totally [Applause] annihilated then what did he do sat down on the right hand of the magesty on high amen now how could this great person ever live the way he did as a mortal to teach us his principles he was the express image of God according to Colossians he was the image of the invisible God in him brought the fullness of the godhead bottle all these great things but yet as a man look at me in Luke 2:51 watch his condensation he went down with them and came to Nazareth speaking of Jesus going with Mary and Joseph and was subject unto them this one who was with the father before the world began and when he come down here in this earth he was subject to his stepfather by the name of Joseph and a woman who let him allowed him to be born concede from her he subjected himself to a mother that's right Jesus go over there Jesus do this Jesus bring me that bucket of water Jesus go out there and help your daddy Jesus do this Jesus go Milk The Cow Jesus do this if you had been God could you done that we're not even God we can't be tell told what to do thank you Jesus you think he humbled himself just becoming a man can you imagine spending all these years of your life life being told what to do so may all of us understand if he acted that way what's it going to do to me and you wonder you see if you don't like to be told what to do nobody's going to tell you to do that lets me know you're of the devil cuz that's the way the devil was and that's the way the devil is notice this he was subject unto them but his mother his mother kept all these say in her heart hold on you Jesus H and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature did he allowed himself to learn more wow when he come to this earth he said father I want to condens sin so low I want to step from the volume of all that I am and the volume of all that I know I want to subject myself like them erase from my existence all that I am and me knowing all things and hearing all things and being all things yet when I am born Immortal I don't want to be that I want to learn sir let the same mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus you see friends where that know- it- all attitude comes from don't come from God and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God amen amen here he is acting as any other Mortal that actually is finding more favor with God as each day goes by that's staggering isn't it amen wake up devil you see this is why it burned him so bad yeah he looked at Jesus as a boy looked at him as a teenanger looked at him as a man and he said he looks just like ever other man eats Jewish bread eats Jewish meals he goes by the Tor he Minds his mama Minds his stepdaddy does all that how in the work of that being thing more than a man it was God hiding in human weakness Dynamite wrapped up in skin and flashed [Applause] Matthew 8:20 Jesus sath unto them the foxes have holes the birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath no word to lay his head he subjected himself to human poverty listen to me Happy Valley there is not a person here today who was as poor as Jesus was we'd call Jesus today a straight person be the kind of guy that you'd see hanging around downtown Johnson City with no place to go homeless we call it now most of you do you have a great respect for homeless people do you go past them and they stink they're not shaven they're not clean and you look at them and think oh my sorry thing you have no idea what why that individual's there come on now come on don't sit there with your self-righteous flare to me but Jesus had no home no donkeys no mules nothing 2 Corinthians chapter 88:9 for we know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ this is the sad part that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor why was that necessary why was it couldn't he come a rich man he could have but do you think you'd ever convinced us poor folks would be acceptable at the table of a rich man so he come to the bottom that way everybody from the bottom up could feel welcome Glory he didn't come to the top cuz you'd never convince those on the bottom that ever be able or worthy to receive it so he come to the bottom and he said from the bottom I'll start up then the rich the poor the middle class the White Collar the Blue Collar the no collar they'll all be acceptable if they'll accept my Mercy now friends this is totally by Choice totally by choice this is not made totally by choice though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor look at this word I can hardly read it to be a beggar to beg to be poor I've stood in India and seen them thousands tens of thousands sleeping in the major cities of Madras Bombay change of Madras and the other major cities of the world that I've seen thousands of them and if they die no big deal they just sweep them up like cattle the next day living in cardboard chenies I mean the main streets of these cities Jesus when he come that that would have been the type of person that he would have appeared to be right Jesus would not have looked like I do today with this three-piece suit on that's right nice shirt that's right nice tie he would not look like you sisters as far as the type of clothes you have on yeah where you could go down and buy you a nice dress and nice pair of shoes that's right but he cond sin to such a place in order to teach us real humility amen that it's more than words that it's actions now notice he says that Ye Ye through his poverty might be me well could he come and died as a rich man apparently not it was through his poverty the imagery that was projected through even this social economic weakness this type of a man is a leader when the priest are the great rich man when the high priest are the great man of clas right Jesus as far as they was concerned was a bastard anyway Oh my he was from Nazareth bad name his mother was a young girl courted by this older man their hist actually tell him that the Roman soldier B her and Joseph just hit it God let him be born with with this black name on him and then be born poor you wouldn't want to go see his place where he was born cuz there's a bunch of ox standing there and a bunch of donkeys they didn't have his little christening ground gown cuz he never had one but she was so poor she couldn't even buy no blue for him or no blanket but she took the old Ox wrap off of the ox's neck you imagine that old Ox out there sweating and working Ox hair all over it and she took that and grabbed her wrapped up her baby the greatest gift the world had ever known but it was veiled in weakness wrapped in weakness hid in weakness born under a weak name born under a bad situation and God said out of this I will start the new creation thank you Mark chapter 2 and when the Sabbath day was come he began to teach him the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying from whence hath this man these things and what wisdom is this which is given unto him that even such Mighty works are wrought by his hands is not this the carpenter yeah is not this the carpenter not the rabbi not the priest not the great king son the prince a common Carpenter oh he was the carpenter all right you see his first job before he come here was actually a carpenter except his first job wasn't building tables and hanging doors it's creating stratospheres and hemispheres Glory it wasn't shaping a piece of wood it was taking the logos and making the logos and the Rema blend together and divide an atam and create a [Applause] universe amen Romans chapter 8:3 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending a fact right yeah God sending a fact in the likeness of sinful flesh and force sin condemn sin in the facts praise God God faxed it down from his Great Divine machine down on the earth and here was Jesus on the earth and the facts said you complete this work and my people are free and then on the day of Pentecost they come back and give them the ministry of reconciliation and said now what I've done you go do and impart unto them eternal life set the C the free cast out Devils preach the word fre you have rece freely [Applause] give don't you understand that's what we needed in this day friend we didn't need a bunch of books thank God for every message book we've got thank God for every message tape we just didn't need books we needed a facts from Heaven God sent down the very Ministry of the son of man f it right down to a prophet Amen in this last day and in order to release to you the same power of [Applause] God Galatians 4:4 for when the fullness of time was come God faxed his son made of a woman made under the law the Creator allowed himself to be made of a woman not a man but made of a woman the instrument that Satan had beg galed in the Garden of Eden the Lord to come and be a man would not Place him as the one who had originally betrayed that word but he allowed himself to come through the woman made of a woman allowed himself to be attached to a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons Hebrews chap 2:9 but we see Jesus who was made lower than the Angels who but God could project himself lower than the lowest form of his creation not only Angels but a sinner yeah you see Jesus was God's answer to men's dilemma we we were we were hopeless helpless and hopeless but God sent down the facts here's your way out this is the express image of my person and I'll not just come down here and let you touch him and and kind of let a little bit of that goodness rub off on you but if you'll allow me I'll fax myself into you then the supernatural will change to the vision the vision will be projected into your image and you'll walk upon this verse no wonder brother said what Jeffersonville needs is thousands of live live voices that'll live out this word friend we don't need another publishing place we don't need another tape duplicating place we need folks in this message to get on fire the Holy Ghost and let this word live itself out of them let God fa himself into our lives that we can be the same image [Applause] made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering now watch when he gained a human rank on the earth he did not choose to be called a five-star general but he had Paul to call him a captain you see friends there's no hope for us to do this without a facts it's not in us it's not in any of us it'll produce falsehoods it'll be oh I'm humble I ain't nothing you don't believe that bit more than the man and the moon does I said last night we cannot produce this only God can do if there's something about man when he gets something he wants to brag about it he wants to boast about it but if you ever receive that fact from heaven am to make the captain of their salvation perfect through dunamus logos Rama sufferings human weakness I love this verse for both he that's Sanctified they who are sanctified or all of One Hallelujah for which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren it ain't no great wonder that I'd call him My Savior My Lord my my king my God my deliver but for him to turn around and say look at me in the face and say my brother amen that's right and for Jesus to embrace us brother Daryl for Jesus to come up and you'd want to get down on your knees and oh Jesus oh Jesus no darl you're my brother and embrace you as a brother would Embrace with with not only human love but Divine love that he would say I am not as shame how can this be look at what we've done look at what we were look at what we still are how can it be this is part of his great humility for him to allow me to come into His presence is an act of humiliation on his part but brother Tom to grab me and embrace me and say my brother amen my precious brother I don't know about you there's some of my family members that I wouldn't want you all to know them now not my brother Harry my brother Jamie neither one of them is done any bad things but I mean I've got uncles and and and people on both sides of my family that I I just wouldn't want to introduce to you all don't sat there and smile at me cuz y'all got them the same [Applause] way you wouldn't want people to know what tree you're from my they've done everything in the world a he horse thieves and bank robbers and all that and all that sort of thing well you know that that's just the truth and the way that it is and you think of there things that we would be ashamed of isn't there family members that you're ashamed of the way they live the way they do the way they do this and that and you think we we what we have done to him be he looks at us with no shame and say I'm not embarrassed by you oh my GL it's been several years since I've been to a sh reunion which is my mother's side or Reagan Union on my father's side but the last time I went I saw some characters there I'm telling you I mean I'll saw some characters and the scary thing about it was there my [Applause] family but oh how I'm longing for a family reunion oh God and I'm going to see some characters [Applause] there who are the express image of this [Applause] person [Applause] hallelujah how could he look at us you see friend it shows he sees us different we look at ourselves at our shame and our humiliation even after being born again and the things that we deal and oh God oh God I'm so ashamed oh that's my cousin there oh Lord he smells like a pole cat oh good not that's my cousin over there Lord somebody forgot to tell her she didn't put clothes on before she come to his family reunion oh no there's a second cousin oh no there's an aunt oh no there's an uncle there's so and so he's drinking this one's smoking this one's doped up and that's what many of us were how is it then that he could come Among Us and look at us and say my brothers my brother my sister yes sir my sister my brother I'm not ashamed of you no I love you that's right I'm not ashamed of you you're my family oh but Jesus how how how could we be your family don't you remember that day you felt that jolt of electricity go through you that was the father faction the same message I got down the river but you're still you're looking to give an instrumentality and you're looking your failures and your shortcoming I ain't looking at that I'm looking at the expressed image of the character of [Applause] God I'm not ashamed to call you Brothers prise the Lord the then verse 12 saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise into this of course if you don't believe in going to church I'm not sure how you're going to hear that I'd advise you if the church doors open three times a week if you live where you can you might ought to be here cuz Jesus might be doing the special singing on Wednesday night woo this one brother Lloyd that said this this wasn't hey that said this this was Jesus that said it I am not ashamed to call them Brethren and I'll declare thy name in the midst of the [Applause] church and again I will put my trust in him and again behold notice how he does this ah and the children which God has given me yes praise the Lord he doesn't stutter he doesn't put dot do dot dot do do dot do dot put some space between you and him but he uses a conjunction I am the children God help me Lord please for as much as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil now you see the peculiarity of our Lord's coming was that his human nature was assumed voluntarily it was not made to be done you and I you and I we would never I would never want to become this to become from Holiness and Purity and all that is right but he chose to become this we were brought to this world without our will but he came to this world willing to become this oh notice verse 15 and deliver them who through fear of death are all their lifetime subject to bondage for he took not him not on that nature of angels which would have been the condescending but on him the Seed of Abraham wherefor in all things it behooved him to be made liken to his brothers and the word behooved is proper it was proper and fitting it was becoming of him to come and get the rest of the family cuz all their fax machines are malfunctioning amen and all these facts is the ability to receive Divine thoughts was projected from the mind of God when they was born on the Earth but all the communication lines has broke between them so God had to send a Divine mechanic on the earth in order to reconnect all the lives glory in order to make us recipients he did not come and bring the seed but he come that we might have life to Quicken the seed that he might destroy him that has the power of death that is the devil I love this word here the word that Paul chose to use the word destroy does not mean annihilate it's obvious the devil is still alive and busy and well but the word means to render inoperative to make of none effect Satan trying to jam him faxes every way he can he can't figure out how to do it he trying to stop you from getting he's trying to stop you from getting a s try to stop you from getting the Holy Ghost try to stop you from hearing the word he's tried to jam your facts line try to jam your image line try to jam it all made you a human being attach you with sickness attach you with all kinds of thing and in spite of it all you rise up and say blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah IJ and infirmity High pleasure and trouble and sorrow the facts is still coming I believe we got one this morning praise the Lord I believe we got a Divine fact for the presence of almighty God don't you see friends that's what the new birth does to your flesh that from the soul you can render this black dog an operative [Music] [Applause] which is a greater Victory than killing [Applause] it Lord Jesus let me close chapter 2: 18 of Hebrews in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to sucker or save them that are tempted you see Jesus entered into such a a real of Temptation that he actually suffered because of it the Temptation was so hard so arduous so difficult for him to say no to that he actually suffered it now all of us we're just humans today and we all know that there are degrees of Temptation there's things when you're tempted maybe to do something or say something wrong and it hits you as a fleeting thought and you know it's gone and that's that's it but then there's others of it that works on you and works on you and it gets harder and harder more difficult and you actually enter into a stage of suffering cuz you're battling this thing so hard and Jesus actually suffered when the women of that day would approach him or drinking or tempted to be the king of the Earth whatever it was he actually entered into the sphere of of Temptation so great that he suffered and he felt that moving on him just like any other human being and Satan looked at him and said there ain't no way there ain't no way that's God I anointed that woman to walk right in front of him and he like Peter looked and turned away but if he had been God he'd never looked looked when he walked by that that bar the other day and I told him corner and get you a little drink you know how wine is it'll calm you down I saw him lick his lips and I saw him thinking my it would help my nerves they ain't no way that's God dumb devil [Applause] Satan thinks Dynamite comes in a big truck marked on the side danger explosives but here was God's greatest power of dynamite and it wasn't marked on the outside danger deity enclosed danger God enclosed but it cried like a man tempted like a man hungered like a man that's right died like a man but raised like a [Applause] god you see friends what this brought God to being exposed to this feeling actually brought God to a greater feeling of understanding now not knowledge of understanding but a feeling of understanding a feeling of compassion now some of us here today on Mother's Day we aren't as happy as some of the rest of you are cuz our mothers are gone right am we Brother D I wish my mom was here I buy her some flowers I'd go see her when you brother down amen I'll probably be preaching to y'all today i' probably understand her so you see when another brother lose his mama I can feel but for those of you that still got yours you don't know exactly how it feels you can say all the kind words you can go back God bless you oh it'll pass that's real affectionate of you thank you you'll get over it yeah right like you'll get over Me Knocking you in the mouth friends oh how heartless we can be you'll get better you'll get just keep your blabber mouth shut if that's all you know how to say but you watch somebody that's lost a mama a mama that meant something to them you watch them you watch them as they walk up there and take hold that person's hand and you can see it about their countenance there's something about it they're feeling they're feeling your loss they've been there and God said I know it but I want to know it I want to know it I want to be able to shake your hand and say I know it I know how it feels to be tempted amen yes than you Lord let's [Applause] [Music] stand and being found fashioned as a man and he humbled himself and became obedient unto death obedient unto death even the death of the Cross he didn't just obey God he didn't just obeyed Mary and Joseph but he obeyed death this is mindboggling as every Mortal when it come that time to cross over and death knocked on his door and said oh right boy I've come to get you submit bow and as a mortal Jesus became obedient to death Glory but his obedience brought Resurrection amen amen don't you love him friends what what ought this to do to to you and I today if we are partakers now of this same life and we get a little something in life and drive a little better car than somebody else and stick our nose up in the air and act like we're something you ain't nothing I ain't nothing if it wasn't for God's grace where would we be this morning here drunk trying to get over a hangover somewhere or been doped up all night long where would we be if was for God's grace we have no right to look down our nose at no one oh but brother Donnie I'm worth someone I don't care what you're worth I've got so many millions what good does that do you you needed the blood just like I needed it and you're worth no more in the eyes of God cuz you got money than those of us who don't have it may God help us to allow this mind when Paul says that let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus the word is allow you see in order for us to think this way we have to allow it to be so we have to be trained we have to be trained to think this way cuz as soon as we break the womb and we start thinking as little children you watch your little children you watch them they feel Superior one to the other they want your attention they want the better popsicle they want the better this the better dress the better doll why where it's born and breed in us and even after you're born again it don't come automatic I know I didn't title it thus but it could have just as easily titled last night and today epitome of the bride before the Rapture for believe it or not I have preached to you last night and today the closing facts and the final scene of the Gentile dispensation of a group of people around the world which will image enter into to the image of God mothers will do it and they'll give away their time and all this for their babies fathers will do it they'll not be selfish men that don't want to spend all their time doing what they want to do but they want to gift to their wife and give to their children come on man preachers that won't want to preach won't preach what they want to preach but'll preach what the flock needs right what is it friend it's Christ Living out from the very beginning let me just share this with you I thought I had last night in today's sermon already studied out I've been studying this week as I always do I had it named titled and almost ready to print until yesterday morning when I got up yesterday morning went downstairs and started studying the father sent me a fax yeah and there wasn't but one word on that fact and that word was weakness so I'm sitting there thinking what's that got to do with what I'm preaching see how Immortals are so I pull the facts out of the machine and I started doing a search and I looked into the Bible and I looked into the message and then I renamed my sermon and I started putting the scriptures in and quotes in and here's the product of the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] fast I'm not the only one that can receive faxes you can receive them too maybe not to preach a seron but to speak a kind word to somebody maybe to give somebody some financial help that's struggling with it maybe to speak a kind word don't just let the preachers be the only one that's tied to God's fa machine but let your heart be tied so directly with the express image remember eternal life is living for others not for yourself there will be no record book by the DAP in heaven of all the great things we have done for oursel we are not rewarded for what we do for us that's the times that you've went and preach that you didn't want to go the times when you've sung when you didn't want to the times when you've come to church that you didn't feel like it the times you've helped others when really you was the one in need of help yourself that's right but there's a great record book that's kept and your facts in these documents back up are the presence of God and he's a good Record Keeper Lord Jesus I don't know what to say I just get so overwhelmed by your presence and what you've been saying to us in the last a little bit I hope they don't think this is me I hope they don't think I'm the one putting this together and I hope they're able to recognize the style of the Divine writer and what they're hearing Lord Jesus forgive us you have given me so much love and mercy and Grace forgive me Lord if I harshly condemn others forgive me Lord if I criticize and ridicule it's one thing if the word does it but I'm talking about me forgive me Lord if I have ever treated any of your people in a way that's Unbecoming to a servant of God not just your people but Sinners on the street you know I try to behave myself whether I'm it's lost lost people or church people or whatever it is I want you to be proud of the way I behave help me Lord I pray Lord Jesus may you touch each heart here today teach us how to Humble ourselves to get off of our high horses thinking we're this and that and the other forgive us God for flaunting vain flesh May our image be molded to that which fits you there's some here today who's never received that Divine fact of the new birth may this be the moment it'll happen to them I'm convinced that there are many here that have but maybe they need a renewing a refreshing May fresh facts come from the presence of God Oh Glory with another refilling of the Holy Ghost can it Lord we love you so much Jesus thank you Lord can we just raise your hands into his presence remember friends he who was rich became poor that you through his poverty might be made Rich what' he do it for Express his great love to us his Mercy not only just a bit let you

reputation was made among such I pray that you'd go with them Lord protect them in their flights and be with them Lord as they travel Lord we know that the people there look for foreigners to come in

Jesus I always I just get so marveled at your greatness Lord though I've preached thousands of sermons and been preaching since I was just a boy but it never ceases to amaze me how you do he just dropped one word or a sentence or a line or something Lord sister Jan Greer is passing and last weekend Lord the service that come out of that all of that was from that one thought that you spoke to my heart it just amazes me how you do and it's not us that's great it's not us that's wonderful it's you it just amazes us how you could even use us oh really if you use me my whole life and cast me away at the end of the way I've been a blessed man to be inspired by God to receive inspiration if you wind up sending me to hell I really couldn't complain but when it's all said and done you'll meet me that day and then you'll get me a reward how could that be you're the one who gives me strength to do it the anointing to do it your wisdom to put it together and then you'll reward me as if though I was the one who done it I'm worthy of no reward Lord just to see you and be with you would be reward enough for me but you're beholden to no man may we be faithful to that hour Lord Keep Us by your grace I pray Lord God in Jesus Christ's name and the saint said amen let's sing together as we go he looked beyond my fault and saw my need and if that's what he done for you why don't you try doing that for others and reaching out to them that you might find it easier to criticize and easy to be judgmental and sharp why don't we try reaching out to them and thinking you know what how do I know I would do better if I walked in their shoes in the same situation you might have an attitude toward somebody and you might be sing in a restaurant like brother Brandon was in Ohio condemning and and really condemning that woman sharp but all of a sudden God pulled him over and got him connected and sent him a fresh facts from Heaven amen let's sing it together as we go God bless you friends amazing grace shall Lord always be my song of Grace for it was great [Music] that why he came to love [Music] [Applause] [Music] for my eyes [Music]
