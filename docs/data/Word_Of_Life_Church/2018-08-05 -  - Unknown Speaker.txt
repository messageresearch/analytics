do a paywall to do but it may makes me happy just to see [Music] and they just loves Jesus with all your heart let's turn to first John chapter 5 if you would first John chapter 5 verse 1 whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and His commandments are not Grievous and the church said for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and His commandments are not Grievous how in the world can a man say this based on the love of God that's the whole key this is the love of God when it comes into a person's heart that keep his Commandments and the commandments are not Grievous after trying to it on their own that's a total different story now well this is the love of God that would keep his Commandments and His commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our face a man-bag hits it together tonight with me in prayer if you would have me like to be remember before the Lord just raise your hand god Bless You Heavenly Father we love you tonight we are so honored that we could come before your great presence or Jesus we counted a privilege father that we can be called your children Lord to be able to assemble ourselves together again tonight we're so thankful we're grateful that we have a place where we can come still thankful Lord to be able to live in a nation thus far well we can have this freedom we are grateful Lord Jesus we don't want to ever take take advantage of it or do it without being thankful in our hearts as we approach it tuned out Lord each of us have needs you saw hundreds of hands went up before you before we bowed our heads you know what laid beneath each hand maybe a child maybe a husband a financial need a physical need something in this service that they need you alone know every heart I pray that you would help us Lord as we come to this portion of the service I certainly need your help Oh Lord God - for a man to stand up and to try to preach you know it's it's it's a phenomenal thing it's an amazing thing that a man can study it by inspiration build a fault try to put things together and order convey something to the people but it takes you Lord to move in a supernatural way to help us we're looking for that to happen this very night Lord speak to us you're a great Rhema word we ask in Jesus name and the Saints said god bless you you may be seated I'd like to speak to you tonight and get this microphone fixed here on learn of me learn of me we want to go back to Matthew chapter 11 verse 28 what we closed out with last week we want to pick up with Jesus dealing with the same thought of the commandments of God not being Grievous now I realized - an unconverted heart even to someone who intellectually knows where you're coming from and knows what you're talking about yet spiritually they never experienced that they'll really struggle with these things because to them the commandments of God the things that God requires of their life or of others they find it very very hard to do and maybe they'll look at others and say that's not fair that is just not right God would demand this and God would demand well you realize when people are saying that either their walk with God is not where it needs to be or they've got broken fellowship with God sometimes a person can get out of fellowship and actually know better but yet for many people saying that consistently habitually over and over again it's really a lack of a new verse because if the Spirit of God in our hearts would would they totally and completely agree with every word that God said that he would impart to us the ability to be able to live it now let's look here at the words of the Lord Jesus in Matthew chapter 11 verse 28 he says come unto me all ye that Labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly and heart and you shall find rest unto your souls now there's many things about the Lord Jesus many great attributes about the Lord Jesus that are so wonderful and so magnificent about his character and the way that he was even when he was here on the earth never a person that ever lived like him and none that ever will but yet for him to say this and point out these particular points about his character it must be a revelant that will have have some sort of impact upon our lives as children of God because we know that it's much more about the Lord Jesus and meekness and the ability you know whenever he stood that time at the temple and they turned the temple into a place of trading and there was buying and selling and exchanging money and the Lord Jesus takes the courts and puts it together and runs the people out of there why didn't you tell us to be longtime now why didn't you tell us to look over in st. John 8:44 and every time a preacher preaches said you're of your father the devil because that ain't the truth that doesn't always apply in every situation so why would Jesus point out that were to learn of him that he is meek and lowly now do we need to be bold at times we do do we need to rebuke your time so we certainly do do we need to be straightforward and even what some people would would consider to be hearts we do but there is a time to be harsh and there is a time to be humble and there's a time for all things in the administration of it but why would Jesus focus on the characteristics in order to help us to be burden bears and to take our yoke now he knows exactly which characteristics will help further the cause of God and help further the yoke bearing to make it more simple and make us where we can be more surrender now you realize that being stubborn being hard-headed even being bold and brazen sometimes that will not help you in bearing your yoke and you understand that being harsh and being all that sort of mentality and attitude that we can have that will not help your yoke that will make your yoke more difficult and more hard to bear so Jesus picks the attributes or the characteristics that would help each child of God to be a better yoke bearer and to help them to come to a spot where they can say this is not hard to do as a matter of fact I found this easier being a Christian it's much easier than it ever was when I was a sinner now if you don't feel that way you need to go on with God and get a deeper Walker's gone now why would he pick these attributes because in these attributes lays the very epitome of his own life never member of theirs as I said there's a time to review and there's a time to chastise and chasing and there's times that preachers have to say public things as Paul spoke to that Jesus spoke about it but yet for us to live and work in that room now you have to take my word for this because you don't know my heart and there's many things that I have to preach it's been very difficult through the years but only God knows how painful and my family this close to me how painful it is for me to have to preach hard and to say harsh thing I don't enjoy that it works so against my human makeup in my nature I'm not a harsh person I'm not a rough person never have been so people who don't know you they think ah he enjoys that you're a million miles from the truth but there are some that apparently do because that's the only way they know how to preach the only way they know how to live but this is not the way that will help you to come into a spot to where you can bury the yoke of the Lord Jesus now a man who really wants to preach I preached art God more than likable never even in a great capacity and you'll never be able to really rebuke in a very big area because he enjoys doing it God never got men in the Old Testament that was out to get the child Diaz or the Babylonians who got men who didn't want to do it that way if they would know it was God making them do it instead of them men having a personal agenda you think the Lord Jesus was a mean person you think the Lord Jesus was harsh and that Jesus was rash as far as being hateful and contrary of course not he was not that way at all and yet sure he displays this to us and he said take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest to yourself so first of all he asked us to come to him because we certainly cannot bear the yoke unless we come to him first so he gives us the divine approach come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and laden and I will give you rest so there is a release after we come to him he releases us from the yoke of sin and then he offers us an exchange of yo so then he tells us that in order for us to go on now from the release of that yoke there is a way there are steps about which we must come to him so we've got to come to Christ but then the next step is there must be a submission in order for the peace of God to be released in order to become a real disciple which is a follower of God now it says once you do that I want you to learn of me so we don't learn of him just my hearing preaching we don't learn of him just by reading the word now there is a truth to that intellectually we learn about him by reading about by the way done things and we learn by going to church and we learn by listening to prophets tapes and we learn by reading the books but yet here is a learn that is a different type of learn than the intellectual conception it is a learning by submission which you'll in turn will bring a divine experience now a person could learn about the characteristics of cross they could set under the ministry or the real son of God a real son of God which is called you'll be able to study the logos they will hear that God study the logos and bring the logos together they will set there and actually hear the Rhema though it won't be Rhema to them but they'll set down here that men of God as he's bringing that Rhema so they're scepter and they hear and they learn that intellectually and that all my Christ is this and he's this and he's this and they can break it down in all the categories and he's love and His mercy and he's on and on and on long and they are learning about him but they're not actually being conformed to that image which can only come by divine something working in their life now many people around the message have learned that God sent a prophet and they've learned about many signs and wonders and vindication but apparently many of them never had a revelation of who he was or they shouldn't be pulling away the way they are today so it's a parent now that a person can learn about holiness they could learn about Jesus they can learn even learn about the attributes of him being lit meek and lowly and he was humble he did not retaliate and he did not come against those who come against him but he held his peace and pray for them so they could learn all of that intellectually but then when that same thing would arise in their life they would never find the power of God released to them to help them do it now they'll hear it in the cell I know I shouldn't do that I know I should but I can't help it now you see what's happening they are learning about him they are learning what they should do hearing it intellectually but the intellectual power never the intellectual sharing ability will never release said them to power to help them do it now Jesus not only knew who he was but by knowing that by gnosis he had noted the Greek word gnosis so it was more than learning it intellectually that he had learned it by experience it released to him the power to help him fulfill what God wanted to do I don't want to just know the word by knowledge I don't want to know it in such a way that when I come to a further understanding of the word that that word releases to me a power or a Dunamis out of that word that helps me to live what I've learned if not I'm going to be more miserable because now I know I shouldn't do that and and that ain't got no power to help me do it but if that word becomes a reality it releases a power to you and to me to help me do what you and I cannot do aren't you grateful for that now what Jesus says learned of me all right Lord Jesus want what do you want me to learn now watch what he says I am meek and lowly in heart so the meekness and the humility the loneliness of Christ now what it appears and his assumption of human nature now what's learned of me watch me watch me look at me and learn of me if you want to bear your yoke without grumbling and complaining and fussing and argument and being at the mean temperent then learn of me now watch so then this was achieved in him by assuming the human nature laying aside all of the great splendor and the grandeur that he was in heaven and he assumed the human nature to come down on the earth and to be called everything on the world that's imaginable then it was also reflected in that he took on himself the obedience to the father's ever come in you ever think why did the Lord Jesus had to be baptized did anybody preach in all the call and Jesus got saved and said well the next thing didn't I've got to get baptized why did Jesus get that ties he was showing submission to the present tense troops there was no need for him personally to be baptized only other than John was there and John had the message of the day and the people were showing their submission to that message to be baptized so in symbol form what was that all you said didn't mean I said it did mean something it was displaying his meekness and his loneliness to the to the command of God for that hour praise the Lord do you understand it Jesus would have lived in this day then you would have found Jesus walking according to the message of this hour if he would have lived in the days of looser Alessia whatever more he would have found in why it was a submission to God this is what he wants us to learn of you learn of me so you can take this yoke upon you and you'll find my burdens are not heavy and cumbersome you'll find out that it is light any child of God that's truly born again if you can't say it there's something wrong with you that it's much easier being a Christian now the devil was living for the devil all brother Donnie you don't even know you said it last week you never got drunk that's exactly right well Brooke let me tell you brother Donnie how it feels to be drunk know what I want you to tell me is how does it feel to have a hangover I want you to tell me how your head feels I want you to open up your wallet and tell me how much you spend for that good feeling or not before and tell me how you're going to pay your light bill don't tell me how cocaine feels when you're up on it tell me how it feels when you can't get it tell me how it feels to sell your body in order to get it here don't tell me about the thrill tell me about the reality of the downside don't tell me oh I'm so free I'm so free don't tell me about that I want to know how that condemnation feels in your heart when you break the word that's what I want to know praise the Lord don't paint me the poster of the Marlboro Man centered upon the back of a horse and this leather vest on a big leather saddle don't give me that let me see the Marlboro Man laying in the ER when cancer is HEDIS lungs out and he can't breathe praise the Lord oh my notice his conversation among the people every day walk that he had what was it it was an absolute submission to the divine will of the father tells us I never come to do my will but the will of the Father so there is no coming to him of course until we know taking the yoke until we come down then actually come to him there's no way we can move to the second stage of rest real divine rest until we learn of him and then take his yoke upon us now notice that for a person to believe that in the - a man I know it's true I know churches oh god I want to do it I want to do it yet they never learn how to submit it very very sad what's this Jesus says take my yoke upon you and learn of me now I notice learn of me don't go to the church don't learn the prophets don't learn to the pastor don't loans just sell the doctrines but learn of me so it will help you to be like me how many wants to be like him walking on water so what you want placing the dead here on the sick planting ropes rub people out what you want what do you want you want to be like him what do you want to be like it praise the Lord now watch he says learn of me for I am meek and lowly so I want you tonight if we're going to this I want you to ask this I'm going to ask Lord what do I need to learn a few teach me what do I need to learn because I want to be a real servant learn of me for I am meek and lowly and Hart now these are the graces that must be cultivated in the life of a child of God in order for them to be completely surrendered to what the Lord wants them to be now notice this I found this meaning of meekness I thought is absolutely wonderful meekness is the strength of the man who can rule his own spirit under provocation subduing resentment under wrong refusing to retaliate now learn of me for I am meek and lowly now what's this when Jesus rebukes the Pharisees it is not in retaliation when Jesus rebukes the scribes and the Essenes and all the different ones and it's not out of retaliation because they have done something to him come on church he is not getting back at him Jesus was not a pulpit bully that he was taking the pulpit in order to satella score Jesus was not using the pulpit as a means to get back into people he was not retaliating against them and I know there's many many examples in the world tour people has leaned that way and I said we'll look at this and look at that look at that yeah look at the whole setting of its own Jesus was not up there preaching and getting back at them you hurt my feelings I'm gonna burn you up in that service buddy I'm gonna preach all over you that man don't even have the right attitude to be on the pulpit not till he gets nothing off of it the pulpit is not to be used as something to settle a score come on church so Jesus was not retaliating against those people I Peter keep a record of all their souls so said some so next time I get out boy I'll lay it on and that's not what Jesus was doing it for that would have not been the example that could have ever died on the cross for us so he says learn of me for I am meek and lowly let me share this with you again meekness is the strength of the man who can rule his own spirit under provocation subduing resentment under wrong refusing to retaliate now don't raise your hands but how many of you can do that oh ma if we take a lot of the retaliation off the Facebook things I'm not sure what there'd be to say anymore everybody's pulpit Facebook well Gloria I'm more interested in name book my name on the book and stay in there and stay in there now watch one he was reviled he didn't revile again notice Jesus whenever he gets under pressure notice when they get ready to take him and crucify him and beat him and all of that there is not one side not one even one display in all of the four Gospels of the same way that he preached John 8:44 year of your father the devil there is not little display of the same attitude like it was why so-so had it been said then had he'll preached that message in st. John a you have your father the devil the reason you don't hear my word because my warning got no place in you it could have been perceived it was retaliation because they were coming against and so God has him to say way beforehand and then whenever they come to get him instead of you know casting out my hole down into hell when Malthus has several ear was cut off and now those losses here what did Jesus do rates right down stuck it back on the side of his head and healed him my Dennis and citizen you're of your father the devil let your head bleeding righto why didn't he displayed a cuz that's what Peter was displaying amen what was Peter do and Peter was showing a message person without the Holy Ghost the way they respond they retaliate with the sword grace hello enough Peter was a good guy and he meant well but the means he was using wasn't well praise the Lord he was retaliation said don't do that Peter so Jesus had to undo what Peter done thank God for mercy so when he comes now under his great strength and city of Jesus retaliating or saying something that would be sharp and harsh and we know that he said many things that could have been taken that one but a shock he totally takes on a different demeanor he now moves into another face what was it the Lamb of God is fixin to be sacrificed as he walks in the temple he looks around and he looked on him as anger that's the prophet when I rebuked some boxcars prophet and now he's going to the cross he's not going to do it in the office of a prophet he's going to the office of a lamb praise the Lord now we know this message can be that way it come from a prophet it can make us all prophetic already talented people but that something attribute Jesus is coming for in the marriage supper if that's so would all be sent out the table fussing and fighting over who got sitting closer to Jesus than you did you know what that's not what's going in the marriage of the Lamb it must man be an attitude I done date show that will match his very own is that right I don't get quite on me already children now watch so meekness is the opposite of self will now watch what meekness will do whenever he was spoken against and her sings and lies and fabrication and they still going to lie after lie after lie why didn't Jesus set up and take a sermon on that law and another sermon on that way and another sermon on that line another sermon on that law and cities just stood there and held his peace as if though he was totally guilty this was not the time to preach such a sermon it was the time to not even act like you were retaliatory but submissive um meek as a lamb that disorder praise the Lord no one says Paul in second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 1 now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ on what grounds does this man have to beseech him as if though he had tapped into the very nature of God he didn't say my gentleness of mind meekness but I beseech you on the furring meekness and gentleness of Christ himself Lord God grant today that we as message folks in reality can say that I beseech you I beseech you not by my chilliness it runs out not the mom meekness it runs out but by the meekness of Christ which has known the gentleness of Christ which has no end oh thank God no one says so meekness is the opposite of self-will so loneliness then would be the opposite or the reverse of self-esteem now what's so meekness is going to be the opposite of self well loneliness will be the opposite of self-esteem which we're all born to esteem ourselves we're born this way into the world and many of us do today the very reason we fight such battles we think it's trials of her faith any trials of our faith it's our still our own rotten human makeup we're so set in our ways and we're so this is ridin re riding anybody crosses and sex what causes a lot of our problems if you can only say really what our trials of your face you'd probably surprised how few they are please mother darling thank you sir I'm going to oh ma now notices Jesus and Matthew chapter 20 verse 27 whosoever will be chief first in ranked first in influence first and honor whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant the problem is we got too many chiefs and nobody wants to be the servants we got the chief at the higher department chief of the dress Department the chief of the thermostat department and the chief of the carpet color department we got the chief of the pasture problem and we got the chief for how long the freaks are to preach and watch the preacher all to come and I don't like this preaching I don't achieve so we got a lot of Chiefs the first in rank you cost their opinion Betty they'll let they'll send up a signal signal to you know let you know you know get away from me get away from me you crossed me exactly is what I'm called to do crossed us all to make us what humble submissive and realize God don't work his whole plan around us we're to work our whole life around his plan now once your Jesus speaking about even those in position and authority intima seasoning in tomato they summon in the new administration of the body that the man who's actually going to be the leaders Oh verse 20 even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister Deacon all which is a Greek word we get deacon from supply food to help the necessities so in Jesus was here he did not come to be ministered to rather to minister to learn of me learn of me although that only the same very deep I know it ain't but it's all for good I think to get us out of here my my I know I need seven thunders and third told and great deep profound things that nobody can understand that's why you so quiet you understand it I've noticed a lot of times folks screaming hot or very deep things they don't understand but the more they're in the sand the quieter they are try to say man when you get Walter on trample on kicks hit in the mouth slap OH notice what Jesus said even as the son of man are you learning of him are you learning of him heavy Valley as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister to give his life a ransom a ransom not for everybody but for many I'm one of them Satan had me held up and he wanted ransom money and Jesus come paid my price so I could go free notice on Luke chapter 22 verse 27 he says for others greater he that set a set meat or he that service now you'll imagine you go in this day of course we're told for us to relate to it and that day they would have servants and slaves so you would be a guest to this man say brother Jamison Serena would knock me down to the house above the Dynamo to have supper tonight I'd come in and there'd be a servant meet me mr. Reagan brother Reagan didn't know what they told him to address me is what he would say he would come in bow himself before me how are you sir so nice to have you sir the babs are here to receive you sir would you please come out gonna take your car keys here take your shoes off here's some house slippers he bought Hamid himself down before me and take my shoes off then put my slippers on can I get you something to drink sir can you come in why they're on the inside they're not gonna meet me at the door they've sent their slave to meet me then when I'm ready or welcome to be received they will come out and receive me he'll go back and wait on the porch to do whatever Lord Jesus said don't you understand I did not come this one to be set at the table I come to answer the door I come to change your shoes oh I come to make you feel welcome are you here in church can we learn of him now keep in mind that position has changed now he's not that now he'll grow me the God but when he was here that's exactly the position he was in he answered the door of God's mercy and he said would you come in my father wants you to come in and sit he'll don't you come in or would you come in and sit down is there anything I can get for you would you like something to drink what about something D is the temperature too warm or can I get someone to fan for you notice this is your master whether it's greater he the citizen meter he'd that service so brother Jim sister Linda tell me but the donor sister Karen we're ready for separate ok so we go in and sit down she don't serve it but the Jim doesn't get me a glass of tea nothing else he sits down at the table the servants cup which is not potatoes sir they're trains to watch my hands to watch every move yes thank you I'll take a figure they move around the table what this is their position and Jesus said don't get in your mind that it's preachers everybody's to bow before you holy man of God preachers have made idol worship out of their positions purchase of servants the servants for deacons are servants the ministry is a position of sermons where many many servants in this church the the library the Deacons our trusty Sunday School teachers what is it it's the service they don't get paid for what they're doing they don't get paid that you very little even recognition for in the eyes but it is a position of servitude but keep the Lord Jesus in front of you it will help your yoke to be much easier for us we ought to be proud just to be servants in the house of God but for him who was the master and he put on the apron as he lost them servants would not be allowed to sit down at the same table where we had our supper they would have to wait until we were done and even at that they wouldn't get the same quality of food did we got so Jesus said I'm not him but sat down at the table with you you're at the table and I'm the one serving you what else you need Peter what else you want what can I bring for you is there anything you'd wants on what you're like another glass of water is there anything I can do anybody learning of him tonight I am among you as he that service so humbleness and meekness are yokes what humility and meekness my Oaks and most of us hate him why the contrary to our pride oh my and the aptness that we as humans have about blowing up who we are well Lord Jesus I I was convinced you want me to preach this tonight what I must have messed up somehow oh ma notice in Romans 5:19 Paul says as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by what you say you mean you were redeemed not only by blood but by obedience learn of me is there any of you men here in the church who would like to take the rap of being a homosexual any you want to take on you the being a male prostitute for other men what about some of your sisters do you not to take upon you the guilt of being a prostitute or a mother that had children that abandoned her children thief robber liar we wouldn't want to do that just in our saved condition then how would you like to be God and take that on you learn me you see freezers things we have to take and things we have to put up with for the end result to be pleasing to him oma notice pulse s for that one man's disobedience inners so by the obedience of one shall many again not all be made righteous Hebrews 5:8 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered so here is the logos in a human body but the logos could not learn it just by recalling back as he was in the father's presence in the great divine omnipotence of God it's not like that knowledge could be transmitted down into the human body and all of a sudden Jesus would know it with the same clarity as if he would not die first this must be learned by obedience which comes by experience if Jesus could not know this by reading the word and this was his previous identity he was the volume of the book but yet he could not know it realistically even by being the word he had to become obedient to it so he actually simple said though he were a son yet learned he you are the logos in the human body learned something then I mean maybe I could be wrong but I still think there's a slight possibility some of us and the message can learn a few things I know for some it seemed I nearly a miracle boy you can't tell them nothing they know everything there is to know about everything are they a clock ticking but if Jesus learned I guarantee to this room for Donnie if Jesus learn there's room for every one of you said right here tonight 9:00 notice again now Messi 11:28 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest notice now the double use of the word rest when we come to him initially this is the grace of God the mercy of God that gives us peace what is that peace it's peace with God peace we've got so by justification accepting him as our Savior we have made peace we're gone we were alienated and of course now through the middle one petition been torn out and we've accepted Jesus Christ as our Savior and we had peace with God but that's not the peace of God now we make peace with God when we got saved the peace of God comes as we learn to submit and obey and are yoked up to Jesus Christ this is why some Christians are never happy they never reached that place of happiness that God wants them to have now search here they learn tyre they search here they look there and they think it's the church there in they think it's the preacher that they're under other thing if I could get a better job it's so sad when you see people that are Christian and they're never happy no matter where they are no matter where they go and it's always somebody else's fault don't you tell what it is they are lacking the peace of God in the old hard now watch these are the words of Jesus not mine come unto me all you who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest notice now the terms I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find Oh so the first rest is given the second deeper rest is found you could come to church for 75 years and never find that second rest because you're expecting him to give it to you it is not given it is found but you can't find it unless you know there's another course of it if you think you've gone down you made peace with God and you don't realize there is peace of God then you live many many years of your life only in that first stage of peace and yet you've got a little peace shows you've got piece of garbage have no real deep settle picture than yourself you have no real fluid peace with the body and the members of the body of Christ but it's always a turmoil always something going on all the time unless you come into the second room and you actually find that peace oh praise the Lord then it won't be in the church it won't be a home in this matter I got a move over here to this man sir and then you get that whole nor though he's not the guy thought it would be all mine I'm going somewhere else and then they go over that you know I they're lacking peace within themselves notice this so the peace with God comes by surrender what he'll I feel sinful nature the peace of God comes as were yoked they strap around their neck the head on their shoulder look at this I love these words Jesus says in verse 30 now my yoke is easy and the word easy means well fitted tailor-made for our lives and needs man alone well there's no easy Mendez Wow what a what a word to use my yoke is easy and other words the things that he allows me to go through our tailor made to fit my life my positive parts my negative parts and the ones in the middle he knows exactly how to make every one of our yokes that are produced exactly what he wants out of our lives and that's why we're envious sometime of other folks yo cuz we look at that like manly bill are easier to bear that than what I bear not if you're that man if you're that man he send the same thing about you or we're so he smiles all the time I mean ever has no battles that's what you think that's what she's saying but every person show is custom-made it is tailor made to fit around your neck according to how wide your shoulders are according to how strong your back is for my yoke tailor-made custom fit Wow my yoke is easy and my burden is light the riff that our soul finds in peace from within the source of the burst is what renders us to the place that we can say I can do this I can do this no matter what he demands of me I can do this now that ain't intellectual it's not mind over matter it's not just repeating repeating remember because remember the man down the engine-room if you don't believe it he'll still go round and around and around the harbour it's not intellectually memorizing the promises in the words and we've just been through all the affirmations and they're wonderful thank God for what is still ongoing but there must be a power released out of the word it cannot just be intellectual conception alone what's this now let's go back to first John if you would chapter five verse three for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and His commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith no New Testament writer makes such frequent use of the metaphors of combat and victory and overcoming as does the disciple of love John now what'd you think of that there is no doubt that John had learned this phrase from the Lord Jesus now watch look what he said whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world this is the victory that overcometh the world even our face now God had given him the insight that the Christian walk is going to be such an embattlement Paul dealt with it we know as a soldier and all that but John over and over from the Epistle of John are on through the book of Revelation over and over again it's like God had so gripped the man that had such a perception of love had such a perception of war such a perception of overcoming and the constant struggle that would be undoing in the life of a child of God I don't think that's a mistake myself I think it's a great parallel hallelujah now notice this baby'll it's front such an imprint upon John's mind and his being as they were sitting there that night one hour before the Garden of Gethsemane a figure this long years of persistence and trials this book is written around 1993 ad something like that when John writes epistle so John had seen here a semadar and first John 2:13 not running do you father's because you've known him that is from the beginning I write unto you young men because you have overcome the wicked one I write unto you little children because you have known the father I have written unto you father's because you have known him that is from the beginning I have written unto you young men because you are strong and the Word of God abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one for Sean four for y'all God's little children and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world revelation 2:7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God listen the seven consecutive ages he that has adhered let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches he that overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death now the very epistle of love the very apostle of love the very man who had such a perception of love yet he's inspired to write overcome overcome overcome battle warfare why it goes hand in hand he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the him to him will I give power over the nation's revelation 3:5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels revelation 3:12 him that overcometh alone make a pillar in the temple of my god notice it over and over again not he that believes the message not he the goes to church not her that has long heard him that don't don't look like a woman but him that overcometh this is the victory that overcometh the world even our face how are we ever going to overcome if we cannot be truly yoked to Christ in submission again revelation 3:21 to him that overcometh I grant to seven men i throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his psalm revelation 21:7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son where did John get this imprint since he's the only apostle that worded it this way what was it that he heard that made it so special it comes as the night has now progressed they can see his fear they know there's something going on it's just got this aura about him he looks different he's acting different they've noticed it leading up to it for a while but now it seems more intent especially the last week since they've been in Jerusalem and they can see him as his setting at the table and it seems he's so nervous that human part about him no doubt reflected humanity and submission they can tell that something is peculiar this the feeling in the air the way he's looking and the words is sad they can tell by what he's leading up to something terrible it's fixing to happen I'm gonna suffer the hands of the sitter's the hour of the power of darkness has now come all these statements that he's saying and now he leads right up to this and he tells him this is my body paint gate he handles them to cut this is my blood in the New Testament which is shed for you they're sinking in our mind what is going on oh no I thought he was the one that was to come to save us or what in the world is happening what oh no what what is going wrong and then all of a sudden he moves from this bleak time and he says be of good cheer I have overcome the world how is that possible he's not died glory damn good chill I have not I will I have overcome the world now let me ask you we talk about it a lot here in our church if any of you have heard it for many many years John let me remind you again as John says in first John 5 for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is a victory that overcometh the world even our faith so what is the world what is the world if I would give each of you a piece of paper - not another Tay - write down ten things that you would identify swirlie ten things what would you write down Bob hair lipstick make it short dresses pants on women I didn't think y'all could get no Quadra than us a while ago but I believe you are going to movies going to the beach why would you write down its of the world in worldly all the above that I mentioned none of them were in heaven when Satan fell none of them were in the Garden of Eden none of them have been in existence except for the last hundred years which means if that's your view of worldly and of the world that means there was no sin up to a hundred years ago [Applause] so what is the world what is the world what is the world that were to overcome not truly there are worldly attributes that are identified by certain thing but is that the world did Jesus overcome bobbed hair there was no cigarettes why there was no Morgans there was no pornography penal never had to drive down the road and see all kinds of signs up with have- women so what did Peter have to deal with praise the Lord there was no internet so what did they have to deal with the world the world now Jesus actually spoke more about the world than any other New Testament speaker you ought to be very careful when you look at the word world because it is a very very broad word it is from the Greek word of course which you know is cosmos but it has multiple meanings and the applications of those meanings can be very very tricky what since in Matthew 13 22 jesus said he also that received the seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word now remember no cigarettes no drinking no movie houses nothing not drinking we know today no marijuana no cocaine no none of that stuff so wide in the world would be able to choke a man backside 2,000 years ago the world so the cares of the world weren't existence when Jesus faked this parallel do you believe that the elect of God would have been able in that day to have identified the world just like you and I can identify the world today Peter and James and John if they could rush erect in the morning and welcome this earth that probably pass out by noon they probably couldn't take the pressure of all the seven doesn't say how in the world do you all live in this terrible day I thought it was awful when I was here my goodness it is I belong there compared to what y'all deal with but yet they had the world to deal with and the elements and the rudiments of the world now notice Jesus gives in this parable of the seed how that the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word so to choke the word and I notice how they could do this how could a thorn choke the word this is the marvel the thorn was raised up or come right out of the same ground and it was so close to the seed that it could actually overpower that seed now what if the seed was right here and the thorns was in the office or the thorns was out on the parking lot there would be no threat there would be no difficulty and let it'll be a nettle or something like that that would spread but for some of these thorns that Jesus used the Darnell and some of the words that he used it was not so much a spreading type of a thorn but it was a thorn what's most planted in the same ground so you mean to tell me that a person hears the Word of God and they receive the Word of God and in that same ground is the sticky nature huckleberry oh here we go again so the thorny is not something way over yonder in another church somewhere or your great-great-great uncle that you don't even see but 13 times in your life if my uncle died and though I get rid of a lot of our problems your problem ain't your uncle it's your old fully hide it's just so thorny ground and it's amazing because look at this not Jesus the way this place is he said he the received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and his Cephas of riches choke the word so the world and the thorn is so close that the thorn can reach over and choke the word that's too close for comfort that means an ain't the guy that lives down the road from me or the guy that lives in the next neighborhood from me or the cul-de-sac above me it means it's the same guy that I'll lay down with it nicer it's the guy brush his teeth in the morning I comb this hair for I come to church why because this is grounds and even though the soul is good ground this is the embodiment it can be the embodiment of thorns it can be the carrier of the good seed but the thorns live so close notice then look how close it is in your soul receives the word in your spirit and in your flesh can be the thorny sticky nature and yet Jesus didn't say nothing about television here he's talking about the cares of this world not the sinful things but the cares you just get so busy well praise the Lord the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word but wait a minute I thought the word was so powerful I thought the word could create and do it can but when the word comes out of the heavens into the human heart and put in a little parcel of ground in your human plot the word requires conditions sunlight moisture and requires all these things in order to grow and if not them all thorns which already have everything they need they have the sarnax which is your fleshly nature they don't need Holy Ghost rain they don't need Holy Ghost preaching I think they don't like it they had to haul the nutrients they need in your human flesh my and it's Rives and clothes and bought that phone and get bigger and bigger and longer and longer and Gouger and gouge ear if there is such a word and it'll stick and prod and stick and probe around and get that little word of center [Laughter] I don't need just go to church tonight I need some good Holy Ghost rain to fall in that I need some good vitamins of the word I need some good nutrients and that thorn said not me I'm doing great no matter of fact I don't need to go to church I need a Dollywood weekend mother chairman spud the Donna gonna be gone it's another Dollywood we can bail the darkness out of town come on take the children let us all go down we did all the one ride up and down the girl it's another Dollywood we can pack up the suitcases and let's go people from Africa probably sinking by over spreading all the powers and faculties the attributes in the word the thorn over tops the seed and actually jokes a little at a time not to alarm it first just starts to putting his hands on snare oh that hurts really well you think that hurts you're just getting ready to feel hurt I'm gonna choke Malachi four out of your life revelation teen Luke seventeen thirty the coming of the Lord hold on us all these things I don't wanna choke it right out of your life we'll take one thing if it hadn't been for God's grace many of us had had this word choked out of our lives but God's got some preachers that know how to chopped out thorns thank God for the Holy Ghost God call me that come down your little garden patch and they got a hole on one side and a mattock on another they got a shovel on this pocket they got weed killer in that pocket whatever they you need they've got it because God prepared them for you he knew you would live in this sea choke today and he called me of this hour and equip them with the Spirit of God and the Word of God and the wisdom of God to chop the leads right out of your life hallelujah so you can be a fruitful person I don't want to just be a Christian I want to be a fruitful Christian he's ever received the seed among the thorns is he that hears the word in the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh not an infidel not an agnostic but it just becomes unfruitful and being unfruitful to a Christian is very very sad it's very very empty well the most empty feelings that a vine can have is barrenness Banas let me go just one step father can now watch this Luke 12:27 consider the lilies how they grow they tore not they spin not yet I say unto you the solemn and all of his glory was not arrayed like one of these if God so clothes the grass was just today in the field and tomorrow's cast into the oven how much more will he clothe you O ye of little faith and seek not what you shall eat now listen or what you shall drink neither be of a doubtful mind now notice this is an anxious distressing mindset now listen carefully this is worldly when you are worrying and fretting and allowing your faith to be paralysed you are under a worldly spirit that went over about like I figured it was it hits in the morning about 3:30 now think they said not my once again listen what Jesus said he shows us how that the lilies don't toll and that don't spin then he shows us in verse 28 if God caused the grass which is today in the field and tomorrow's cast into the oven how worthless it would seemingly be then he says how much more would it cause you oh you are the little face and seek not you that what she shall eat or what ye shall drink neither shall be of doubtful my notice a doubtful mine so when a person enters into the faith oh I don't know how we're gonna make it oh what are we going to eat what a girl all I don't know how to know God wants us to be concerned friends but if we're not careful we cross over the line of being concerned to being of a doubtful mind and a doubtful mind is worldly it is unstable the word here is unstable in constant wandering in your thoughts about things notice now in verse 30 Jesus said for all these things do the nations of the cosmos see gift so you mean a woman can dress godly on the outside a man could dress godly yet in their thoughts constant worrying about this old home oh just one thing and it never against it just changes from A to B and from B to C once C get settled D is that once they get settle is that do you understand that is of the world the worldly nations cosmos that's the way they look at it [Applause] notice Jesus your father knows that you have need of these things but what becomes doubtful should we be concerned absolutely so we could be concerned about our time and the economy absolutely we should but man we've done everything we know to do what more can you do I'll tell you what most of us did when we've done everything we know to do we don't stand there for we worry therefore and then we become into a doubtful mind Jesus said don't you know your father knows you need these things so whenever we enter into a doubtful mind we are becoming worldly why because it's contrary to Scripture this is even more plain than a woman wearing makeup this is even more plain than some of the things that we identify this is more plain than television there's no scriptures that says the word television there's no scripture that says many of the things that we as message people identify as the world yet this is absolute scripture that we become of a doubtful man and it is worldly to do so Jesus system should know your father knows if you go to a doctor tomorrow or the next day and you find out something is in your body or condition that you didn't know you think God fell apart when the doctor told you that he already knew it he knew it before the foundation of the world butthole God Oh God Christian hat is people it's got computers and internet let's see a bump on the head streak across your right wrist it turns at a right angle and your big toe jumps big toe jumps streak across right wrist you've got the low cific escapa Kapusta Camus purposely keeping its Mickey by myself it said oh no I got double critical scoopa Koopas begin to us and they say there's no killer will you poor little monkey Perkis you I'll tell your friends this on the worst things we can do sometimes when we go to identify in our line symptoms with Lion Devils the Internet can be a very helpful thing until you go to line up with unbelief and if you're not careful you'll bring your body in an exact identification of a lying symptom that you found on a website come on now don't get quiet on me all the other dummy times are hard I know they're hard that my God is still God and off as far as I know that scripture said the book of Philippians my God will supply all of your need according to his riches and glory I'll tell one thing if it gets so hard when God food my god still got Ravens I've seen some around my house today God can have them to fry me up a hamburger he can have them fix me ham meat in the morning he can have them give me a steak at suppertime at night if that's what he wants me to do but all I gotta do is live for him and trust him and get a worldly doubtful mind away from me hallelujah while because worry has no virtue [Applause] go ahead and give him a hand again [Applause] [Music] so the nations of the cosmos this is their man set this is what they seek after look Jesus goes on in verse 31 but rather seek ye the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added don't you see we're doing it backwards we're doing exactly backwards this is why friends many Christians are not blessed brothers we'll start a business and they wonder why they're not blessed they put their business before God how can God bless a business that is placed in opposition to his word don't put the business first don't put money first but seek him first then these other things will be added you're not to seek daily food praise the Lord you're not to seek your insurance and Obamacare and this and that one Oh Lord okay what are we going to heaven oh well that's going to come upon us on the other body but it depends on what your mentality become now you keep here stuck in Fox News and some over here stuck over there oh god oh god oh god it's terrible terrible stuff example what the change is terrible oh my brother I got good news to tell you the bride shot on the very break I'm going into body change all these Saints have got to come to pass yes sir but it's leading me in you know a change notice the very opposite which is the opposite Jesus says but rather seek ye the kingdom of God and all these things food raiment shelter shall be added to you don't seek them seek God and these things were just added blessings fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom it is worldly to be a for doubtful that it is worldly when we let go of face and worry I know each of you have to find that fine line of concern and worry there is no way you'll tell me about Scripture nor by the message that you can worry and have faith at the same time you've got to have one or the other you cannot have this faith is heavenly worry is worldly well I might need to preach this again in the morning listen to the scripture st. John 16:33 these things have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world one hour before guests M&E looks like the very end of everything they've hoped for he says I have overcome already finished they didn't say the grave right he said the world so the order of the world cosmos it's Prince its power every bit of it had already been put under his feet this is a kind of Christian I will be before I leave this world that I can look around at layer to see and say I have overcome Leo to seal I don't want to put on my tombstone well he lived a good life and after we burned him to finally overcome they'll put that lie on my tombstone I want to overcome now before I leave I want to overcome the

anyone to stumble or let anyone astray in any way away from Christ lord I ask you tonight that she would help me and help these people to be willing to take our tailored yoke through our submissive will and allow you to yoke us up may reap all the plow as it were may we be as a mother or father or a business man what have we our Lord the world is starving to death for life help us to be examples over daughter teach us Lord Jesus I'm willing to learn father you've taught me many years ago how to cast out Devils you taught me before I ever come to the message to believe that you could do the supernatural I saw many things before I become to the message in a supernatural realm I'm grateful for that the lure don't want to learn of you I don't want to just learn a message theology I want to learn of you help me not to retaliate Lord help me to learn there's power and Submission and love can happen God how many once said as well how many wants to love like Jesus loved ever sister there's gonna be bad tests and I shall come let me taste something the other day I stopped down Elizabethton to see a businessman and acquaintance he's had some real terrible things to happen to him physically I hadn't seen him for a long time I can't hardly walk just see him some real terrible terrible things my heart was so moved toward this man I just kept telling him I'm so sorry I'm so sorry and when I got ready to leave his place of business I just so felt in my heart to embrace him so I went over to him and I said I'm so sorry I'm gonna be praying for you it was like the love of God fell down in that little place or who was he started bawling and crying like a baby shaking like a leaf whenever I walked out of his place of business he had customers out in front waiting the scene and I walked out he was still standing there shaking and trembling couldn't even speak and I thought wonder if I would have give him a doctrine if that would have done that to him because I know what he believes he certainly don't believe what we believe what if I would have give him an opinion about something maybe if I would have rebuked him over this or that Heather but it sucks something moved on my being now I will say something it felt as if though the Lord Jesus himself was taking my arms and going around him as I pulled him up into my arms and I just began to panic I said I love you Betty I thought I left that place I come home told Carol about it every day this week it's just so affected me and I felt truly truly we're living in a world that is starving to death for love I'm not telling I love the compromises for saying I didn't change one thing what I believe but I believe he was able to sense a person greater than me is there anybody here that would be willing to give Jesus your arms Jesus your mouth so you'd be able to embrace somebody that was a Baptist or Methodist or a Church of Christ or a parousia or a to soul or a term ministry or whatever they'd believe be and we'd lay aside the label and had Jesus that Jesus I'll tell you to me or some one of the greatest things I've seen God heal the sick through my hands I've seen God cast out devils I saying God do so many things I'll give us one the greatest miracles I've ever experienced because I felt another person Cal can tell you when I come home ascending our bathroom tell her about it I couldn't have our keep from crying because I felt another person / children this is what I'm talking about that person is this what is there anybody here besides me that wants to let Jesus left me that way praise God
