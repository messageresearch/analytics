[0:01] preach what does he say Don't just show
[0:04] me signs don't just show me dreams don't
[0:07] just tell me about Visions don't just
[0:09] tell me this happened to you and that
[0:11] happened to me but tell me what you
[0:15] preach and what you believe amen praise
[0:19] the Lord this is the way we judge all
[0:21] preachers is by what they say now the
[0:25] real test then if the prophecy is true
[0:29] sure they can prophesy thus sayith the
[0:31] Lord this is going to happen and that's
[0:33] going to happen and it might happen
[0:35] exactly right but is their message of
[0:39] what they're going to say because we
[0:40] know that those signs are to get your
[0:43] attention as a matter of fact the
[0:44] prophet said that Divine Healing is the
[0:47] bait on the hook how many y'all's ever
[0:49] been fishing before so do you throw the
[0:52] bare hook out in the water say come on
[0:55] fishy fishy come on I want to catch you
[0:57] I want to eat you for lunch so what do
[1:00] you do you want to find what the fish
[1:03] are biting on today they might bite on
[1:05] this tomorrow they might bite on
[1:06] something else and you want to hide it
[1:09] if it's something if it's a spinner bait
[1:11] or whatever it is something that'll
[1:13] glisten and be able to catch a you know
[1:15] a Trout's attention or whatever you're
[1:17] trying to catch you don't want to show
[1:18] him them triple hooks that's on there
[1:21] you want those hooks to be hid as much
[1:23] as possible well Satan knows exactly the
[1:25] same thing so Satan will come in and
[1:28] he'll throw a bait a spin in bait way
[1:30] out in the middle of religion
[1:34] and water splashes up everywhere and
[1:37] here goes this person there goes another
[1:39] one there goes another oh oh my this is
[1:42] wonderful this is
[1:43] awesome but they don't try to check them
[1:46] by the word oh they say oh this is so
[1:48] great this is so wonderful my
[1:50] grandmother got healed and and my aunt
[1:52] got healed praise the Lord your
[1:54] grandmother got healed but what's that
[1:56] fisherman trying to say once he catches
[1:59] you right that's what's important amen
[2:02] and the youth said amen amen amen thank
[2:05] you and you old guys too thank you for
[2:07] those amens now watch in Deuteronomy
[2:10] chapter 18 verse1 15 now this scripture
[2:14] is is it's like one of the Messianic
[2:17] Psalms in the Book of Psalms and other
[2:20] Psalms that can have a compound meaning
[2:23] and a compound application now listen as
[2:27] God is going to tell the children of is
[2:29] is through Moses Deuteronomy 18:15 the
[2:33] Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a
[2:37] prophet from the midst of thee of thy
[2:40] Brethren like unto me unto him ye shall
[2:44] hearken now this is a Messianic prophecy
[2:48] speaking about the coming of the Lord
[2:50] Jesus and there's certain attributes of
[2:52] this verse that can apply to Jesus of
[2:55] course only but also he's speaking in a
[2:58] larger Spectrum about God going to raise
[3:01] up one Prophet after another after
[3:03] another that will come down Through the
[3:05] Ages now watch verse 15 applicable
[3:08] mainly to Christ look at verse 16
[3:10] according to all that thou deliver
[3:13] desirest of the Lord thy God in horb now
[3:17] this is the reason why that as the
[3:20] people of God are called out of the land
[3:22] of Egypt they are the people of God once
[3:25] they come out of Egypt they gain a new
[3:28] title they are called The Church of God
[3:32] because the word church means called out
[3:35] so when they were in Egypt they were the
[3:37] people of God but the people of God in
[3:40] bondage once God calls them out then
[3:43] they are not just any longer the people
[3:45] of God they still are but they are the
[3:49] called out people of God so they are the
[3:53] church in the wilderness now God is
[3:56] going to deal with them in a way that is
[3:59] totally different in the way that he
[4:00] deals with us as far as church and so on
[4:03] so he's giving them a pattern and he
[4:05] said according to all that thou desirest
[4:08] of the Lord thy God in Horeb in the day
[4:11] of the assembly saying let me not hear
[4:14] again the voice of the Lord my
[4:17] God anybody remember this setting on on
[4:20] the mount okay let me refresh it it's
[4:22] whenever they're coming out and God
[4:24] tells them Moses tell the children of
[4:27] Israel sanctify themselves tell them to
[4:30] wash their clothes tell them to set a
[4:32] boundary around the foot of the mountain
[4:35] if an ox or or a cow or a human anything
[4:40] comes near that mountain kill them right
[4:43] there because the mountain was
[4:45] Sanctified by the presence of God so
[4:48] when God come down the trumpet started
[4:51] sounding lightning and smoke it must
[4:54] have been horrific the children of
[4:57] Israel were terrified and Moses said he
[5:01] himself did shake and tremble from the
[5:05] presence of God so the people said oh
[5:09] don't let God don't let God speak we'll
[5:11] never live and they were shaking and
[5:14] trembling and and terrified and even the
[5:16] mountain was shaking like a volcano or
[5:19] an earthquake was hitting the mountain
[5:22] God did this for a reason remember horb
[5:24] is the Mount from which the law of God's
[5:26] going to go forth and they asked for the
[5:28] law of God God didn't want to lead them
[5:30] by law they rejected his leadership but
[5:34] God is showing them this is what comes
[5:37] with the law with the law comes fear and
[5:41] judgment and correction and whippings
[5:44] and so on and so on but that was not
[5:46] God's choice that was
[5:49] theirs so when they saw it they heard it
[5:53] you imagine it was mixed emotions like
[5:55] they never felt before they were afraid
[5:58] of pharaoh they were afraid of the task
[6:00] Masters they had all kinds of human fear
[6:03] down in the land of Egypt but no doubt
[6:05] they were experiencing something they
[6:07] had never felt seen or experienced in
[6:10] their entire life so they went to Moses
[6:13] and said please please tell God we can't
[6:18] take this we we cannot stand this if God
[6:22] speaks to us again like this we'll all
[6:25] die we can't take the presence of God
[6:30] so
[6:31] God quotes back to them what they ask
[6:36] according to all that thou desirest of
[6:40] the Lord thy God in Horeb in the day of
[6:42] the assembly so now they're coming to
[6:45] church so they're assembling together
[6:49] saying let me not hear again the voice
[6:52] of the Lord my God neither let me see
[6:56] this great fire anymore
[7:00] that I die not they were terrified
[7:04] absolutely terrified so this is what God
[7:07] Said and the
[7:10] Lord said unto
[7:13] me they have well spoken that which they
[7:18] have spoken I will raise them up a
[7:23] prophet from among their Brethren like
[7:27] unto thee and will put my words in his
[7:30] mouth and he shall speak unto them all
[7:34] that I shall command him and it shall
[7:37] come to pass that whosoever will not
[7:39] hearken unto my words which he shall
[7:43] speak in my name I will require it of
[7:49] him so since the people were to obey
[7:53] God's Prophet without
[7:57] question now listen with without
[8:02] question false
[8:04] prophets then were to be
[8:07] treated if they spoke falsely they were
[8:11] to be treated by the penalty of
[8:15] death because a prophet was supposed to
[8:18] be the spokesman for almighty God now
[8:22] notice in verse 20 but the prophet which
[8:25] shall presume to speak a word in in my
[8:30] name which I have not commanded him to
[8:32] speak or that shall speak in the name of
[8:35] other gods even that Prophet shall
[8:43] die you believe that amen now this is
[8:46] how God looks at false
[8:49] prophets oh my let's read in Jeremiah CH
[8:54] 23: 21 false prophets in the days of
[8:58] Jeremiah I I have not sent these
[9:01] prophets I want you to notice that
[9:03] they're in plural form God sent one the
[9:06] devil sent
[9:07] many I have not sent these prophets yet
[9:11] they
[9:13] ran tell me you talking about
[9:17] enthusiasm you talking about a desire to
[9:20] get their message out they wasn't
[9:22] walking they wasn't riding on a donkey
[9:26] they were
[9:28] running yet they ran I have not spoken
[9:32] to them yet they prophesied but if they
[9:36] had stood in my
[9:39] counsel and had caused my people to hear
[9:42] my words then they should have turned
[9:45] from their evil way now once again God
[9:47] is giving us a way to identify the
[9:51] message of a true prophet of God because
[9:55] his message will always without
[10:00] question bring the people back to God's
[10:05] word a true Prophet will never widen the
[10:10] narrow pass a false prophet will widen
[10:16] the Narrow Path and say oh this is not
[10:19] required no more that don't matter no
[10:21] more no no that's that's fine that's
[10:23] fine it's okay everything's acceptable
[10:26] and we're all the same that's a true
[10:29] true sign of a false
[10:31] prophet because a true prophet of God
[10:34] will never widen the Narrow Path Jesus
[10:37] said straight is the gate and narrow is
[10:41] the way and few there be that find it
[10:44] but yet look at the horde of thousands
[10:48] of false prophets around the world today
[10:50] and are they preaching the narath no
[10:54] they're preaching that somehow Heaven
[10:56] has changed its description
[10:59] Jesus described the
[11:01] Broadway as the way to
[11:05] hell but false prophets are saying the
[11:09] Broadway is now the way to
[11:12] heaven so you don't have to even be a
[11:15] Christian According to some of them you
[11:17] can believe Islam and still be a
[11:19] Christian be saved go to heaven you can
[11:21] believe a Hindu you can believe shintu
[11:24] ISM taism you can believe all these
[11:27] things and still be there because we're
[11:29] all going to the same place anyway and
[11:31] you know there's just Jesus is just one
[11:33] of the many doors like the different
[11:35] doors here we have in our church so you
[11:37] know Jesus is just one of them but I
[11:40] would like to point out to you tonight
[11:42] one door in our
[11:44] church that one right
[11:48] there anybody know where that door go
[11:50] that door goes
[11:52] to
[11:55] nowhere because that
[11:57] door is a false door
[12:00] St so when we were building the church
[12:03] and standing back there in the back and
[12:04] looking at it and Carol has a very
[12:07] symmetrical
[12:10] eye and brother Mike walls is trying to
[12:12] figure out how to do all the panels and
[12:14] this and that and Carol sit back there
[12:16] and she said Donnie I'll tell you what's
[12:17] wrong with the look of that and I said
[12:18] what is it woman the woman thou gavest
[12:22] to be with
[12:23] me she said you've only got one door you
[12:27] need another door I said that that wall
[12:30] right there goes to my bathroom I do not
[12:32] want a door going to my bathroom she
[12:33] said a false
[12:36] door so I stood back there and looked at
[12:39] and I thought well I hate to admit it
[12:40] but she's true speaking the truth I
[12:42] mean excuse me there yeah so brother
[12:46] Dave Swanson I talked to brother Dave
[12:48] and you know what brother Dave did he
[12:50] measured this door got exactly the same
[12:54] type of door the same
[12:56] frame and behind that door is a solid
[13:00] wall but yep it got a handle on it and
[13:03] if you notice it's even black where it
[13:06] looks like the door goes somewhere
[13:08] there's hinges on it there's a handle on
[13:10] it but you can't get it open and you
[13:14] can't go
[13:15] in now I told Brother Homer Longoria
[13:18] about that door because I didn't want
[13:20] him to try to go in there since he had
[13:21] never been here before on Wednesday
[13:23] night a few Wednesday nights ago and I
[13:24] said brother Homer I want to tell you
[13:26] about that door and I said thank you my
[13:28] luck i' to tried to R out that door now
[13:31] you see that's what religion is trying
[13:33] to do oh Shintoism taoism you know ISM
[13:37] It All Leads to
[13:39] Heaven it goes
[13:42] nowhere Jesus did not say I'm one of the
[13:45] doors but I am the door to the Sheepfold
[13:49] I am the way not one of them I am the
[13:52] way the truth and the life no man cometh
[13:55] to the father but by me aren't we glad
[13:59] we know that way
[14:00] tonight now you see whenever God gave
[14:03] this identification he knew there would
[14:05] be hundreds and hundreds of years that
[14:07] the people of Israel would be dealing
[14:09] with false prophets notice in Jer
[14:12] Jeremiah
[14:13] 28:15 then said the Prophet Jeremiah
[14:16] unto
[14:17] hananiah the
[14:20] prophet so Jeremiah the prophet said to
[14:25] hananiah the prophet
[14:29] here now hananiah the Lord hath not sent
[14:32] thee but thou makest this
[14:36] people to
[14:39] trust in a
[14:44] lie you see young people why will be so
[14:48] damnable for every
[14:51] preacher that preaches
[14:54] lies and yet convinces people to trust
[14:59] those lies for
[15:02] salvation and God will damn those
[15:06] preachers to Hell me
[15:11] included if I ever get off the truth and
[15:15] the paths of God's word ain't that right
[15:18] no preachers are
[15:19] exempt it's a very serious thing now
[15:22] what do preachers then because of their
[15:25] influence they have the ability to
[15:27] influence people
[15:29] to either trust in truth or trust in a
[15:35] lie so then a prophet could stand up and
[15:38] you know perform signs wonders Miracles
[15:40] whatever is they do and yet then people
[15:42] would find oh my goodness oh
[15:45] my let me just give you an example I
[15:48] said in a tent meeting many many years
[15:50] ago whenever I was in Pentecost and
[15:52] there was a certain man that was in
[15:53] Pentecost quite famous brother Bram
[15:55] actually mention him in 1959 1962 you go
[15:59] to YouTube you can find his name um but
[16:02] anyway I was sitting there Caroline in a
[16:04] tent service and this man called out
[16:06] this woman and did something very very
[16:08] vulgar there in the service I'm i w to
[16:11] tell you what it was but and I I'm
[16:12] sitting there right in the next seat
[16:14] there right behind them and I I'm
[16:17] thinking oh my Lord you've got to be
[16:19] kiding me there's no way this can be
[16:20] right there's no way this can be right
[16:23] this man calls me out after her and her
[16:26] husband sits
[16:27] down he he tells me what I
[16:31] prayed that
[16:33] day the words I said to God and the
[16:37] order I said them
[16:45] in testing one two three I think I lost
[16:50] contact now unless you've ever had that
[16:53] to happen to you you don't have a clue
[16:56] how that
[16:57] feels cuz here I am and I saw this man
[17:00] do something totally totally
[17:02] wrong and yet he called me out and told
[17:05] me something that was
[17:08] irrefutable absolutely irrefutable then
[17:11] what does that make you do that makes
[17:13] you where that you will not question the
[17:17] wrong and you will not question the
[17:21] Miss because you focus so much on the
[17:25] hit
[17:29] oh my goodness but you see I don't want
[17:32] hit and miss I want hit or
[17:35] ning we ain't playing baseball we're
[17:38] talking about people's Souls now you see
[17:40] how it can be then for someone that you
[17:43] know would would even give people what
[17:46] we would call a word from the Lord you
[17:48] know you're going to be healed or this
[17:50] is going to happen to you that's going
[17:51] to happen to you and if that was not a
[17:53] word from God that man is leading them
[17:57] people to trust TR in a
[18:02] lie and God don't like for his
[18:06] kids to be lied
[18:09] to whether it's about their healing
[18:12] whether it's about their Doctrine or
[18:14] whatever it
[18:16] is I mean boy God was really upset at
[18:21] haniah the Lord has not sent thee but
[18:24] thou makest this people to trust in a li
[18:29] therefore thus saeth the Lord
[18:31] behold
[18:32] I will cast thee off the
[18:35] face of the Earth this
[18:39] year Thou shalt
[18:43] die because thou has taught
[18:48] Rebellion against the Lord so William
[18:50] brandom was a false
[18:53] prophet and started
[18:56] prophesying in the 30s
[18:59] in the
[19:00] 40s traveling around the world preached
[19:03] to thousands times thousands of
[19:07] people God justly should have taken the
[19:11] man off the
[19:12] Earth not let him live till
[19:15] 65 not let him become more established
[19:18] and and more renowned and get more
[19:21] influence come on now let's put it to
[19:23] the test of God's word why did God let
[19:26] him live
[19:29] why didn't God take him like he did
[19:30] hananiah why would God let him get
[19:33] established and leave a message and
[19:37] would affect hundreds of thousands of
[19:40] people on the
[19:43] Earth then God treated us
[19:51] unfairly God treated the people in the
[19:53] days of hananiah one way and God treated
[19:57] us another way
[19:59] God allowed a so-called false prophet as
[20:03] the world would call him to preach have
[20:06] signs wonders Miracles even allowing to
[20:10] record tapes and let them tapes be
[20:12] played for years I leave the
[20:17] Earth praise the Lord I tell you what
[20:21] when the Lord give me this the other day
[20:22] I
[20:24] thought I can't wait to get up there and
[20:28] turn that Devil's hide anybody smell him
[20:31] here tonight I love getting him in a
[20:34] corner don't you now come on let's
[20:36] Supply God's word does God love the
[20:40] people in the days of Jeremiah better
[20:41] than he does the people in Tanzania and
[20:44] Uganda and Ghana and Trinidad and all
[20:48] over the world where this message has
[20:50] been God don't love them poor little
[20:52] ignorant children and God would let a
[20:55] soulall false prophet yes sir
[21:01] so
[21:03] hananiah the
[21:05] prophet now I want you to notice the
[21:07] Bible does not even call him a false
[21:12] one so hananiah the
[21:15] prophet
[21:17] died the same
[21:20] year in the
[21:22] seventh
[21:25] month
[21:27] my notice
[21:29] Moses goes on to say now back to
[21:30] Deuteronomy
[21:33] 18:21 and if Thou shalt say in thine
[21:36] heart how shall we know the word which
[21:40] the Lord has not
[21:43] spoken this is a good question is it not
[21:45] how shall we know the word which the
[21:48] Lord hasth not spoken when a prophet
[21:52] speaketh in the name of the Lord if the
[21:55] thing follow not now listen follow not
[22:02] nor come to pass now remember prophets
[22:06] could speak of things that would come to
[22:09] pass in their
[22:11] lifetime and then they would also be
[22:15] allowed to speak of things that would
[22:17] come to pass maybe decades or even
[22:22] centuries after they left the world
[22:24] after they left the world so part of
[22:27] what they said would come to pass in
[22:29] their lifetime and they would see it
[22:31] with their eyes other things they would
[22:34] speak in the name of the Lord would not
[22:36] come to pass in their generation or the
[22:38] Next Generation or the Next Generation
[22:41] and so on but their words of Prophecy
[22:44] would follow them even after they left
[22:48] the Earth notice how he said this now
[22:49] when a prophet speaketh in the name of
[22:51] the Lord if the thing follow not nor
[22:54] come to pass that is the thing which the
[22:56] Lord ha not spoken but the Prophet has
[22:59] spoken it
[23:00] presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid
[23:03] of him all you mean suppos there's
[23:06] supposed to be a genuine
[23:10] fear amongst the people of God about a
[23:14] true prophet's
[23:18] words you see the sad part about it is
[23:21] there's followers of our message that
[23:22] have lost that fear that's why they do
[23:24] what they want to with the message so if
[23:27] they don't think it applies to this say
[23:28] they just don't preach no more I sat
[23:31] down not long ago and and started just
[23:33] making some
[23:35] notes of this certain Church in the
[23:37] message that doesn't preach this no more
[23:40] not heresy but because I've talked to
[23:42] them myself and this certain Ministry
[23:44] and that certain Ministry and they don't
[23:46] believe the way the prophet taught this
[23:47] and the way the prophet taught that I
[23:49] was
[23:51] overwhelmed after about 20
[23:54] minutes of Great Men great churches
[23:59] great resounding
[24:01] Ministries and yet sorting through what
[24:05] they want and this don't apply well that
[24:08] was only because of the 60s and well
[24:10] brother randam only said that because he
[24:11] had a Baptist background and this so
[24:14] explaining away so where is the
[24:18] fear that the Old Testament produced in
[24:21] that
[24:22] day it's really sad to me now watch's
[24:25] this false prophecy by hanani
[24:28] Jeremiah 28:1 and it came to pass the
[24:31] same year in the beginning of the reign
[24:32] of Ziah king of Judah in the fourth year
[24:34] in the fifth month that hananiah the son
[24:36] of isur the Prophet which was of gibian
[24:39] spake unto the house of the Lord in the
[24:41] presence of the priest and all the
[24:43] people saying thus speaketh the Lord of
[24:46] hosts I want you to notice now he's not
[24:48] speaking in the name of a false
[24:51] god he's not saying in the name of
[24:55] ba in the name of Kos
[25:00] but in the name of the Lord of hosts the
[25:03] god of Israel saying I have broken the
[25:07] Yoke of the king of Babylon within two
[25:10] full years will I bring again in this
[25:13] place all the vessels of the Lord's
[25:15] house now notice his
[25:18] prophecy there's so much of this
[25:21] prophecy that is filled with the message
[25:25] of the
[25:26] hour what you prophesying about Babylon
[25:31] the house of the Lord the vessels of the
[25:34] house the people of the
[25:37] house he's mainly got two things wrong
[25:41] in the prophecy the length of time and
[25:45] the Yoke being broken all the rest of it
[25:48] is message message message message
[25:52] message but the two years sounded much
[25:56] easier than 70
[26:00] right so what is it a false prophet one
[26:02] way you can always red flag him he's
[26:05] always got an easier way it's always
[26:08] more palatable to the to the
[26:10] non-spiritual pallet that's looking for
[26:12] an easier way out making the burden
[26:15] lighter and making everything easier in
[26:18] life and you know shrinking it down
[26:21] Jeremiah just too hard 70 years oh my
[26:24] that hard man Jeremiah couldn't help
[26:27] that God was the one who said
[26:29] it within two full years while I bring
[26:32] you again to this house the vessels of
[26:34] the Lord's House that Nebuchadnezzar of
[26:36] Babylon took away from this place and
[26:38] carried them to Babylon I will bring
[26:41] again to this place jeah the son of jeim
[26:44] King of Judah with all the captives of
[26:46] Judah what message message message
[26:53] message sayth the
[26:55] Lord for I will break the yoke of the
[26:59] king of
[27:02] Babylon now you imagine them people
[27:04] sitting there this old worldly and you
[27:07] know like they' got into into that shape
[27:09] anyway and they said man that sounds a
[27:11] lot better to me don't you wow that old
[27:14] Jeremiah always knew his way too hard he
[27:17] gets up there and he just preaches Lord
[27:19] have mercy my toes curl up in my sandals
[27:23] I'm I'm getting why I'm having to wear
[27:24] hard toll sandals to church because he
[27:27] just preaches all over me Lord have
[27:29] mercy I I just don't understand and here
[27:32] comes this pudding Mouse pudding Mouse
[27:35] yeah pudding Mouse creamy pudding
[27:39] hananiah but Jeremiah was more like a
[27:41] chainsaw
[27:45] [Music]
[27:47] Mouse Bo and Jeremiah got done there
[27:50] arms and elbows and ears and toes and
[27:52] mouths laying all over the
[27:54] church everybody just kind of picked all
[27:56] their noses up and all their eyes and
[27:58] hope they wound up with the right one on
[27:59] their face again and mosied on out to
[28:01] the carriage and said I ain't coming
[28:03] back no more are you oh I ain't coming
[28:06] back he's too
[28:08] hard so the devil said ah this hard
[28:14] preaching opens a door for me so it's
[28:17] all based on supply and
[28:20] demand so there was a demand among the
[28:23] children of Israel for a prophet now
[28:26] remember they didn't want a general they
[28:28] wanted a prophet so Satan said ah I've
[28:31] got the man you're looking for can I
[28:34] introduce to you from Houston Texas
[28:36] hananiah
[28:39] himself and his way is so much easier
[28:42] he's so much more likable than
[28:47] Jeremiah and Mo and the people said
[28:49] glory to God thank you Lord thank you
[28:54] Lord praise God now if that man's
[28:57] prophet was true it meant that God had
[29:00] gone weak on his word and God didn't
[29:04] really mean what he said God said now
[29:07] you got to do this and you got to do
[29:08] that got now God said no no really I
[29:11] mean I realize nobody can't live that no
[29:12] more that ain't my God that ain't my
[29:17] God so you see a prophet sent by God is
[29:22] never wrong and what he says from the
[29:25] word of the Lord will always come to
[29:28] pass 1st Samuel 3:
[29:31] 19 and Samuel grew and the Lord was with
[29:35] him I love this scripture and he did let
[29:41] none of his
[29:44] words
[29:45] fall to the
[29:49] ground and all Israel from
[29:52] Dan even to berseba so this is from the
[29:55] northern part of Israel to the southern
[29:57] part that they possessed from one end to
[30:00] the
[30:01] other from Dan to berseba knew that
[30:06] Samuel was
[30:09] established to be a
[30:11] prophet of the
[30:14] Lord praise be to
[30:17] God and the Lord appeared again in
[30:21] Shiloh for the Lord revealed
[30:25] himself to Samuel in
[30:29] Shiloh by the
[30:31] word of the Lord now remember this is
[30:34] not a
[30:35] priest a priest is not made this way
[30:39] this is not a pastor I'm not made this
[30:43] way evangelists are not made this way
[30:47] I'm made like
[30:49] this I have a subconscious and a first
[30:52] conscience in order for me to contact my
[30:56] subconscious I must must go to sleep I
[31:00] will fall asleep close my eyes I will go
[31:04] into the deep sleep and once I'm there
[31:08] however long it lasts I may dream
[31:11] dreams my dreams most of mine are
[31:13] probably like yours as crazy as they can
[31:16] be I've had a few spiritual Dreams yeah
[31:19] they need no interpretation
[31:21] whatsoever so whenever I'm there I will
[31:25] dream this and then whenever I come out
[31:27] of it lot of times I remember you know
[31:29] how dreams can be and then other times I
[31:31] come out it's just all jumbled up in my
[31:33] mind but there's parts that you'll dream
[31:36] and it can be fearful I've woke up out
[31:38] of Dreams before and I've had a
[31:41] reoccurring dream since I started being
[31:43] a preacher I don't tell you what that
[31:45] reoccurring dream is it's a dream that
[31:48] I'm always smoking a
[31:51] cigarette that is a nightmare right so
[31:54] I'm smoking a cigarette thank God I
[31:56] ain't had that dream in a long time
[31:58] probably have it tonight now I'm talking
[31:59] about it because your dreams are
[32:01] affected by what you're talking about
[32:02] what you're thinking about so I I'm
[32:04] smoking a cigarette and somebody from
[32:07] the church or some preacher friend of
[32:09] mine will come up and catch me at that
[32:11] cigarette and I'm trying to get rid of
[32:13] that cigarette and trying to hide my
[32:14] breast and trying to now you know you
[32:16] say why in the world would you dream
[32:18] such a thing I've never smoked a
[32:20] cigarette in my entire life I'm way too
[32:23] old to start smoking one now so you
[32:25] thinking what is it about it so but a
[32:28] prophet his subconscious and his first
[32:32] conscience are like this God move move
[32:36] them so close together a genuine Prophet
[32:39] is a special creation of
[32:43] God he's not like other men so he God
[32:47] could let him break into a vision and he
[32:50] would stand right there with his eyes
[32:53] wide
[32:53] open in a WRA or a p
[33:00] t
[33:02] condition wrapped r a p
[33:06] t which short abbreviated term for
[33:12] Rapture you see we have to have a
[33:15] Rapture in this age this is one reason
[33:18] why we needed a
[33:20] prophet that would be able to be R
[33:23] A into the mind of God to catch the word
[33:28] and bring it down to us to produce an r
[33:32] a p t u r e for us Church age Messengers
[33:39] Luther Westley Pentecost done a great
[33:41] day great thing in their day but none of
[33:44] them were R
[33:45] A into the realm of God to catch the
[33:49] word
[33:51] needed praise the Lord
[33:54] Jesus notice now
[33:56] God when whenever this Samuel was known
[33:59] and identification remember that the
[34:02] people of Israel wanted a king so God
[34:06] said all right if they want a king I'll
[34:07] let them have one it's not my choice I I
[34:09] want to be their King but if that's what
[34:11] they want to make the story short you
[34:13] remember that Saul his father had Lo
[34:15] lost some donkeys and they couldn't find
[34:17] them so Saul and a servant went out to
[34:19] be able to find him and we'll pick up
[34:21] there chapter 9:6 and he said unto him
[34:23] behold now there is a city and a man of
[34:26] God and he is an honorable able man all
[34:29] that he saith cometh surely to pass now
[34:33] notice this is an identification of a
[34:35] true prophet of God now let us go per
[34:38] Adventure he can show
[34:41] us our way that we should go now a four
[34:46] time the Bible
[34:49] says they were called a sear s e e r
[34:56] sear why
[34:58] because they would
[35:00] see then said Saul to his servant but
[35:03] behold if we go what shall we bring the
[35:05] man for the bread is spent in our
[35:07] vessels there's not a present to bring
[35:09] to the man of God what have we and the
[35:12] servant answered Saul again said behold
[35:14] I have here the ham a fourth part of a
[35:16] shekele of silver that I will give to
[35:18] the man of God to tell us our way and
[35:20] before time in Israel when a man went to
[35:23] inquire of God thus he spake come and
[35:28] let us go to the
[35:32] sear now this was the
[35:34] reputation of a prophet of God so it
[35:37] wasn't just a preacher it wasn't just a
[35:40] man that went around and held campaigns
[35:43] but this was his
[35:45] identity now you know if you've studied
[35:48] much on the time frame of Israel
[35:52] witcraft
[35:53] idolatry and a lot of this stuff is
[35:56] going on during this t same time frame
[36:00] in the land of Israel so you can imagine
[36:02] what a real prophet of God was called in
[36:05] that day a
[36:07] witch a sser necro romancer another
[36:12] Hebrew word so here God sent a prophet
[36:16] you understand what Satan was doing
[36:17] coping mimicking what God was doing you
[36:20] remember whenever saw some years later
[36:23] went down to the witch of
[36:26] Endor and Samuel had died by that time
[36:29] the blood of Jesus had not been shed so
[36:31] Paradise was down this way and Samuel
[36:34] died and went down into Paradise kept
[36:37] right next to
[36:39] hell and whenever the witch of indor
[36:42] went he said who who would you want me
[36:43] to bring up and remember that can happen
[36:46] today so he said Samuel the prophet so
[36:50] she goes through all of her rituals what
[36:52] was it demonic power this woman had
[36:56] given her soul over to the control of
[37:00] demons so here she breaks into that
[37:03] Supernatural realm and she
[37:07] said you are
[37:10] so you are so why don't don't fear don't
[37:13] fear I'll spare your life she said I see
[37:17] an old man he said what does he look
[37:20] like so she described him and it was
[37:25] Saul she was able by this
[37:28] power to call
[37:31] Saul out of
[37:35] paradise and Saul
[37:39] spoke oh my goodness Samuel excuse me
[37:43] the prophet called out of
[37:45] paradise and Saul there
[37:50] backslid and yet the prophet Samuel told
[37:52] him tomorrow night by this time you and
[37:56] your sons will be with
[37:58] me did it
[38:01] happen this woman was no prophetess she
[38:05] was a
[38:07] witch you see how Satan loves to do this
[38:10] is why we have to be on our
[38:12] watch we have to be so careful in the
[38:16] time that we're in no wonder Jesus said
[38:18] there'll be false prophets and the
[38:20] prophet preached it false anointed ones
[38:24] at the end
[38:25] time oh brother scares me to death no
[38:28] need for us to be scared we know how to
[38:31] judge we judge by the word Judge Me by
[38:35] the word judge by the DAR by the word
[38:37] inter to the preachers the word is what
[38:41] we're judged by Praise the Lord right
[38:44] same with you that's the way we are
[38:47] known now watch in verse n again before
[38:50] time in Israel when a man went to
[38:52] inquire of God thus he spake come let us
[38:54] go to the sear for that is now called a
[38:57] Prophet Was Before Time called a seir 2
[39:02] Samuel 24:11 for when David was up in
[39:05] the morning the word of the Lord came
[39:07] unto the prophet
[39:09] dad David's sear so notice what a
[39:14] prophet was now David was a great king
[39:16] and David himself was also referred to
[39:20] as a
[39:21] prophet but not a
[39:25] sear you see David could received the
[39:28] word of the Lord in format of songs and
[39:32] Psalms ASAP was also a prophet who wrote
[39:37] part of the
[39:38] Psalms but not being a Seer you
[39:42] understand now god notice in 1
[39:45] Chronicles 9:22 all these which were
[39:48] chosen to be Porters in the gates were
[39:52] 212 these were reckoned by their
[39:55] genealogy in their Villages who whom
[39:58] David and Samuel the seir did ordain in
[40:03] their set office so now remember Solomon
[40:06] already had the direction through a
[40:09] prophet of God Samuel and his father the
[40:13] king it's going to be years before the
[40:15] house of God's even going to be built
[40:17] but God was so particular and he showed
[40:20] it by a prophet of God so a prophet of
[40:23] God receiv received the order of worship
[40:27] before the Tabernacle was ever
[40:31] built glory to
[40:34] God think of it Samuel was done dead and
[40:37] gone before the temple was ever even
[40:40] built but God gave the order and the
[40:43] ordination of how they'd be Porters at
[40:45] the gate who will be here this one will
[40:47] do this this and will do that and God
[40:50] gave that church or if you want to call
[40:51] it that way he gave it to who the
[40:54] prophet of God and to David
[40:58] 1 Chronicles
[40:59] 29:29 now the acts of David the king
[41:02] first and last behold they are written
[41:05] in the book of Samuel the
[41:09] sear and in the book of Nathan the
[41:14] prophet any of y'all ever read that
[41:17] book the book of Nathan the prophet and
[41:21] in the book of GAD the
[41:24] sear any of y'all ever read that book me
[41:29] either now the rest 2 Chronicles 9:29
[41:33] now the rest of the acts of Solomon
[41:35] first and last are they not written in
[41:37] the book of Nathan the prophet and in
[41:40] the prophecy of aijah the
[41:43] shilonite and in the visions of
[41:47] IDU the
[41:50] sear
[41:52] wow against jeroboam the son of nebat
[41:57] now look how God has always used
[42:01] Sears and
[42:03] Prophets to guide his
[42:06] Kings to guide his leaders don't you
[42:10] understand as a pastor God knew like
[42:15] David I needed the
[42:17] guidance of a
[42:21] sear but God knew I would not live the
[42:24] sear would not live long enough and I
[42:27] would not live in his time frame well I
[42:29] was born in 1956 he was still here but I
[42:32] was just a 9-year-old boy whenever he
[42:34] passed but God Made A Way so our church
[42:39] and other churches around the world
[42:42] could be worshiping under the counsel
[42:44] and guidance of God Seer if we will only
[42:48] take what he had to
[42:50] say well praise the
[42:52] Lord my my 2 Chronicles 29:30 close here
[42:59] momentarily moreover he Hezekiah the
[43:02] king and the princes commanded the
[43:03] Levites to sing praise unto the Lord
[43:07] with the words of
[43:09] David and of
[43:12] ASF the
[43:14] sear
[43:16] ASA the SE so whenever you go to your
[43:18] Bible and you open up there in your
[43:20] Bible if your Bible is like mine
[43:23] Scofield or different ones they will
[43:24] have it written at the top a song of the
[43:27] psalm of David you know written by so
[43:29] and so whenever David was doing this or
[43:30] that but and some of them it won't say
[43:32] of David but it'll say of
[43:36] ASF so God was giving
[43:39] Asaf and Asaf was a
[43:42] Seer and they sang Praises with
[43:46] gladness and they bowed their heads and
[43:50] worshiped so they're singing their
[43:53] praise their Church order or whatever
[43:55] you want however you want to refer to it
[43:57] it was given under the
[43:59] inspiration of a sear of men of God that
[44:03] receive from the Lord oh Lord that's the
[44:05] way I want ours to be let me read
[44:08] another can I just read you a couple
[44:09] more before we go now watch how God
[44:12] worked in the realm of vision with these
[44:15] prophets Genesis 15:1 after these things
[44:18] the word of the Lord came unto Abram now
[44:22] this is under his old name but he always
[44:25] was a prophet his his name is not
[44:27] Abraham but Abram after these things the
[44:30] word of the Lord came unto Abram in a
[44:36] vision not in a
[44:39] book not in a
[44:41] book but in a vision this is the way the
[44:45] Bible the Old Testament was
[44:48] written by the word of the Lord coming
[44:51] to
[44:52] prophets in Vision form now unlike mine
[44:56] and your dream
[44:57] which can be so jumbled up and so mixed
[45:00] up this is what people don't understand
[45:02] about a prophet that when a prophet
[45:05] receives a vision a word from the Lord
[45:10] in Vision
[45:11] format that is
[45:17] infallible it don't need our opinion
[45:19] added to it now I want you to notice so
[45:22] there was nobody there to check out
[45:24] Abraham's Vision now Abraham I'm going
[45:26] to check you out by the Bible there was
[45:29] no
[45:31] Bible but God gave him his word in the
[45:36] form of a vision now remember keep in
[45:38] mind different from you and I our dreams
[45:40] can be all jumbled up they can be
[45:42] totally messed up but because a
[45:44] prophet's first conscience and
[45:45] subconscious lay like this God can
[45:48] attach himself to that and it will be a
[45:51] perfect projection from the mind of God
[45:53] into the channel of that man and he can
[45:56] stand there and
[45:57] thus sayeth the Lord by tomorrow bread
[46:01] will be sold in the city of Samaria for
[46:03] such and such and there'll be such and
[46:05] such and so and so and there was some
[46:08] old lepers just happened to believe that
[46:10] word of the Lord and the very next
[46:12] morning it come to pass exactly as the
[46:14] prophet of God said because God
[46:17] projected from his own mind and that
[46:21] Prophet caught them thoughts of God and
[46:23] spoke it into existence do you
[46:27] understand God's prophet of this Agee
[46:29] said there will be a
[46:34] Rapture so from the mind of God the
[46:37] thoughts of God and he was able to say
[46:39] it there will be a Rapture and he said
[46:42] it over and over again and there will be
[46:43] a bride ready you believe what you want
[46:45] to about that I don't think it's just
[46:47] comments it's done been spoken so let it
[46:51] be done it will be done at the right
[46:54] season there ain't enough devils in hell
[46:56] to stop it from happening our our
[46:59] laziness our sorriness our mistakes our
[47:02] shortcomings there ain't nothing going
[47:05] to stop God's spoken word from coming to
[47:07] pass aren't you glad let's Stand
[47:12] Together praise the Lord praise the
[47:16] Lord and after these things the word of
[47:18] the Lord came unto Abram in a vision
[47:21] saying fear not Abram I am thy shield
[47:26] and thy exceeding in great reward now
[47:29] this is all the word that he had for a
[47:34] long long time years no Bible no daily
[47:39] devotion no nothing like that just God's
[47:44] word praise the Lord let me read this
[47:47] one to you numbers 12:6 and he said hear
[47:50] now my words if there be a prophet among
[47:53] you I the Lord will make myself know
[47:57] known unto him in a vision and will
[48:02] speak to him in a
[48:07] dream now God didn't say that about a
[48:10] pastor God didn't say that about an
[48:12] evangelist or a teacher but a prophet of
[48:15] God so how shall we know if this message
[48:20] that we are following if this is a true
[48:22] Vindicated prophet of God or not well we
[48:25] look back in the word see what the word
[48:28] said when he come did he broaden the way
[48:30] the way false prophets did did he beg us
[48:33] for money the way false prophets did did
[48:36] he bring us the easier way the more
[48:39] acceptable way when you look at the sign
[48:41] of the false prophets in the Old
[48:43] Testament it's pretty plain and it's
[48:45] pretty similar to where we are today
[48:48] thank God for the
[48:49] truth let's bow our heads together
[48:53] praise the
[48:54] Lord Heavenly Father how we thank you
[48:57] tonight for your word Lord Jesus these
[49:01] precious things that you've made known
[49:03] to us in this last day and it lays right
[49:07] in your Bible dear God how many
[49:10] scriptures have we looked at on this one
[49:13] question over and over again from
[49:17] Genesis PL over to the Book of
[49:20] Revelation your choice your means by
[49:24] which you would reveal the word of the
[49:27] Lord was a Vindicated prophet of God
[49:31] being your
[49:33] mouthpiece we thank you for that father
[49:36] we thank you for every one of those true
[49:38] prophets that have stood down through
[49:40] the span of time and given the word of
[49:44] God to the hearts of your children then
[49:47] Satan would come in with a a whole slew
[49:50] of false prophets behind them offering
[49:53] other gods and other names alternative
[49:58] ways that was pleasing to the flesh
[50:02] easier more acceptable and there was an
[50:05] element of Israel that followed that and
[50:08] they went to their Destiny but there has
[50:10] always been a genuine people who held
[50:13] fast to that word of God may we do the
[50:17] same
[50:19] father I'm afraid as we go on in
[50:23] time there will be more ways that will
[50:26] be introduced Among
[50:29] Us ways that many will succumb
[50:32] to they will be overcome by false
[50:36] prophecy maybe even some by signs
[50:39] wonders and then the message that will
[50:42] follow will be off the beaten path of
[50:45] Malachi
[50:46] 4 Lord God I believe it has been spoken
[50:50] and you will have a bride that will be
[50:52] faithful to your word oh Jesus make may
[50:56] that be so of our church dear God don't
[51:01] let it be said about our church in 10
[51:03] years 15 years 20 years if time should
[51:07] last yeah that was a that was a message
[51:11] Church years

[51:22] youths would gather there at the
[51:23] Banquets and they had such Services

[51:40] but somebody's told me now that he's got
[51:43] older he's got
[51:45] soft or may it not be said that the guy
[51:49] who who actually was there he passed
[51:52] away and now they've got younger men and
