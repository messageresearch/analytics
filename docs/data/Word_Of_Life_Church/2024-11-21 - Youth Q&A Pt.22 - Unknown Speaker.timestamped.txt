[0:00] now the people are shouting and
[0:02] rejoicing and screaming and here comes
[0:05] the Ark of God and the Bible said that
[0:08] the oxen stumbled so they just
[0:12] stumbled and when they did the cart
[0:15] simply just tilted like
[0:18] that and this man sincere man loved God
[0:23] with all of his
[0:25] heart remember his name
[0:28] oza and when ever he saw it what did he
[0:32] do put forth his hands to steady the ark
[0:36] oh he's trying to help God and whenever
[0:38] he touched it God killed him right
[0:41] there and the Bible said David went to
[0:44] his house that day
[0:47] afraid of the
[0:50] Lord now would people in our day how
[0:54] would they look at that well they should
[0:56] look at it pretty importantly because
[0:57] they're doing the exact same thing
[1:00] people in the message are too they leave
[1:02] this out and leave that out and leave
[1:04] that so oh it don't really matter don't
[1:06] really matter I mean what difference
[1:08] with it's Levites or whatever I mean
[1:10] we're bringing the word back praise God
[1:13] we're bringing the word
[1:15] back that's why you hear me preaching
[1:17] the tape only say and Blasting it all
[1:19] the time because what are they trying to
[1:21] do they're trying to leave out the order
[1:24] and the protocol of God God's Prophet
[1:27] show me where he ever laid hands on a
[1:29] tap place and ordained a tape player to
[1:31] be your
[1:33] pastor well praise the Lord a tap player
[1:36] can play brother brandom's tapes we
[1:38] thank God for it but you can go in this
[1:40] office back here and tell the tape
[1:42] player you've got
[1:44] problems and see if it answers you see
[1:48] if it can lay its hands on you you show
[1:50] me a tape player with hands I want that
[1:52] tape player but go what do they do they
[1:55] well would just take what the prophet
[1:57] said no they're not taking what the
[1:59] prophet said they're taking part of what
[2:02] the prophet said and they're setting the
[2:04] word the message of the hour over on a
[2:07] new cart what is that cart called tapes
[2:11] only and then they make their t-shirts
[2:13] and their sweatshirts and their hoodies
[2:15] and all that tape boy tape girl they got
[2:18] all this sort of say and we're proud to
[2:20] be taped we're proud to be taped well I
[2:23] said we really listen to those tapes and
[2:24] hear what they'd say then they'd find a
[2:26] church where they believe in preaching
[2:28] and they'd have men of God that are
[2:30] there but what they do they leave it out
[2:32] then we've got some that believe in
[2:33] preaching and they choose to leave this
[2:35] out and choose to leave that out I'll
[2:37] tell you one thing I don't want to leave
[2:38] nothing out myself no matter how small
[2:41] how insignificant that it might appear
[2:44] y'all understand where I'm coming from
[2:46] now watch he set the Levites in the
[2:48] house of the Lord with with Harps and
[2:50] according to the Commandment of David
[2:52] and of GAD to the king sear so now
[2:55] watch's David how this is now under the
[2:58] administration of Solomon and what
[3:00] they've done no doubt David we
[3:02] reiterated over and over and over again
[3:06] to Solomon his horrible mistake of not
[3:10] following the word of God so David had a
[3:13] Seer one which could see but David
[3:16] instead of Consulting the sear what how
[3:19] should we bring the word back David just
[3:21] went right around him and said I think
[3:23] this is good but watch him now whenever
[3:27] it comes to dedicating the house of God
[3:29] passing this on to Solomon they had the
[3:31] Levites symbols sues Harps according to
[3:34] the Commandment of David of GAD the king
[3:36] sa and naan the prophet oh my goodness
[3:41] boy they want to be sure they're
[3:43] worshiping right now don't they so
[3:45] they've got Gad The Seer and nathon the
[3:48] prophet praise the Lord you know what
[3:51] that done that scared David it scared
[3:54] him you want to know why I want to
[3:55] follow this word so much cuz I have a
[3:58] fear in my heart
[4:00] when I study this message I don't look
[4:03] at it as just some other study manual I
[4:06] don't look at it the same way that I
[4:08] would look at a Bible
[4:10] encyclopedia I don't look at it in the
[4:12] same way that I would pick up Adam
[4:15] Clark's commentary or you know some of
[4:17] these other biblical illustrator
[4:19] commentary I look at it totally
[4:22] different it's a prophet's message a
[4:25] prophet's
[4:26] message I hope I always look at it that
[4:29] way yes sir notice again in 2
[4:34] Chronicles
[4:36] 36:16 but they
[4:38] mocked The Messengers of
[4:42] God and despised his
[4:46] words and
[4:48] misused His
[4:50] prophets until the Wrath of the Lord
[4:55] rose against his people
[5:00] till there
[5:02] was no
[5:06] remedy oh my goodness young people don't
[5:09] never leave this word don't never leave
[5:13] this word oh you may always have
[5:15] questions my goodness I've said this
[5:17] message for years and years and years
[5:19] sometimes I think I have more questions
[5:21] than I have answers but I'm so glad for
[5:23] What Little bet I do understand oh
[5:26] Hallelujah now look at what God did so
[5:29] they mocked The Messengers of God they
[5:32] despised his words they misused His
[5:34] prophets until the wraths of the Lord
[5:38] arose against his people not Philistines
[5:42] not amorites not Hittites not jebusites
[5:45] gites but because his people treated His
[5:50] prophets this way the wrath of God
[5:53] raised against God's Own
[5:57] people my to till there was no
[6:02] remedy hide is the Lord Jesus behind
[6:05] this word Jeremiah 7: 25 since the day
[6:11] that your fathers came forth out of the
[6:14] land of Egypt until this day I have sent
[6:18] unto you all my servants the prophets
[6:22] daily rising up early and sending them
[6:26] now notice how many times that prophets
[6:29] is mentioned here in the Old
[6:32] Testament verse 26 yet they hearken not
[6:35] to me nor incline their ear but hardened
[6:38] their neck and they did worse than their
[6:42] fathers now I want you to notice that
[6:44] God he reckons himself as being the
[6:50] message that the prophets
[6:53] brought so he says I sent my servants to
[6:57] prophets daily rising up early and
[6:59] sending them yet they hearken not unto
[7:02] me now watch God is taking this as if
[7:05] though he
[7:07] himself was the ones that was speaking
[7:10] to
[7:12] Israel isn't that amazing that God would
[7:15] choose a man with a gift and it would be
[7:18] God breaking that man into the realm of
[7:21] vision and he would say thus sayeth the
[7:23] Lord and them people that are supposed
[7:25] to be the people of God would say we
[7:28] don't want what you've got to
[7:32] say now you do understand of course why
[7:35] they did that because Satan saw the
[7:38] importance of prophets too so when God
[7:43] would have a
[7:45] Jeremiah God God anointed God's
[7:49] mouthpiece Satan raised up a
[7:54] zedekiah
[7:56] Jeremiah zedekiah
[8:00] at the same time frame and zedek now
[8:04] whenever he would come in there he would
[8:06] not come in and say abraa Deborah abraa
[8:10] this and some type of chant and some
[8:12] type of blood of a goat but you know
[8:14] what zedi would do he would come in thus
[8:17] sayith the
[8:21] Lord so here you are now we'll say
[8:25] you're
[8:26] Israel so Jeremiah is saying you better
[8:29] repent you better get right you better
[8:30] give your heart to God God's going to
[8:32] sell you out to
[8:34] Nebuchadnezzar and then here comes
[8:35] another prophet he say thus sayeth the
[8:38] Lord Jeremiah's a false prophet you
[8:40] ain't going to be down there no 70 years
[8:42] you'll only be down there two years and
[8:44] you'll come back thus sayeth the
[8:47] Lord so who are you going to
[8:51] believe what if you're carnal you're
[8:54] going to choose the easier way you're
[8:57] going to take the two-year propit
[9:00] prophecy cuz that's the way our flesh is
[9:03] it always looks for the easy way how
[9:07] close can I
[9:10] walk to heaven but not I don't want to
[9:14] be a fanatic now I don't want to go my
[9:15] goodness why should I go way up here why
[9:18] should I go way up here just show me
[9:20] brother Donnie how close I can walk to
[9:22] the world and be saved but I won't be
[9:25] lost but show me how close I can get
[9:29] if you're having to do this you're way
[9:32] too close to the
[9:33] world I want to be way up yonder don't
[9:36] you father in I am away from the cliff
[9:39] the more safe I
[9:41] feel but can you
[9:43] imagine that every time God would raise
[9:46] up one Satan would do the same thing now
[9:49] watch in Hosea chapter 6:4 oh Ephraim
[9:54] what shall I do unto thee Oh Judah what
[9:58] shall I do unto thee for your goodness
[10:01] is as a morning
[10:03] cloud and as the early due it goeth
[10:08] away now therefore watch what God Said
[10:11] therefore have I
[10:14] HED
[10:16] them by the
[10:19] prophets so you understand Church
[10:23] natural foolish virgin all these
[10:26] churches out here they refuse the the
[10:30] tool by which God chops
[10:34] out his
[10:37] people so God Hues his people by
[10:41] prophets so he sends a prophet with a
[10:43] message and he chops the people out of
[10:46] the
[10:47] denomination well you know you look at
[10:49] them and they're pretty rough because
[10:53] they were chopped out with a pretty
[10:56] sharp tool in a prophet's hand and it
[10:59] got a little bit rough
[11:01] sometimes so God sends the rest of the
[11:05] ministry pastors evangelist teachers
[11:10] missionaries what do they do the same
[11:12] Holy Ghost not new word now same Holy
[11:16] Ghost they go to honing and
[11:19] polishing and
[11:21] honing taking them edges and rounding
[11:25] them all say they want a three4 round
[11:27] and it comes out of their great you know
[11:30] straighten oh my it's got splinters all
[11:32] over it you rub your hand down through
[11:34] there like I did today building
[11:37] something for Carol and I put it put one
[11:39] coat of finish on it and whenever I did
[11:41] the plywood had absorbed all the finish
[11:44] and I rubbed my hand up and when I did
[11:46] eight or 10 splinters right in my
[11:48] fingers and the palm of my hand I nearly
[11:50] cried like a
[11:53] girl but you see that was part of the
[11:57] process so I took a sand sing block
[12:00] dipped it in water and I wet sanded it
[12:04] and by doing that the Finish will cause
[12:07] them little splinters to stand up and it
[12:09] makes them hard then you can take a
[12:12] piece of sandpaper and rub over the top
[12:14] of it and they totally
[12:17] disappear and then I made it ready so I
[12:20] kept working it higher and higher
[12:22] another finish another higher coat of
[12:25] sandpaper from 320 up to 500 then up to
[12:30] a th000 then up to a 1,200 and a while
[12:33] ago before I come i s that it was the
[12:35] final one
[12:37] 5,000
[12:39] grit it's so fine it feels almost like a
[12:43] piece of
[12:45] paper so God chops his people out but
[12:50] chopped out people ain't ready for a
[12:52] Rapture so what' God do God calls
[12:56] pastors he calls evangelist he calls
[12:59] teachers it calls missionaries and then
[13:01] they go to working boy they go to
[13:03] sanding and they'll rub across your hide
[13:05] and boy some of you I rub across it I
[13:09] go don't worry I ain't going to give up
[13:11] on
[13:12] you aren't you glad God don't give up on
[13:15] us but you see what God did God said I
[13:19] have heed them by the prophets I have
[13:22] slain
[13:24] them by the words of my mouth
[13:29] you understand that's what's happened to
[13:30] us that we have
[13:33] died oh I've been playing a song that I
[13:36] that I heard here several weeks ago and
[13:39] it's it's talking about giving up
[13:41] everything you know to the world and all
[13:43] that so that you can get everything back
[13:45] that you really learn how to get it back
[13:47] once you give it all up and the words of
[13:49] the song say I died as a pulper and was
[13:54] reborn a
[13:56] king praise God I died as a sinner poper
[14:01] and I was reborn a king and God will
[14:04] work on us and Slick us down and get us
[14:07] Slicker and Slicker all the time that
[14:10] finished product and that's what people
[14:12] can't take they don't want they don't
[14:14] want their Splinter sand it down they
[14:15] don't want all the rough edges all they
[14:17] just leave me alone just just leave me
[14:20] like I am leave me tell me how good I am
[14:22] tell me how sweet I am tell me how I'm
[14:24] going to heaven tell me how I understand
[14:25] God understands all my failures no I
[14:28] want to sing s you I want to send you oh
[14:32] I going to run over you hide and run
[14:34] over you hide and mine right there with
[14:36] you until we get a slick that a fly
[14:38] comes in like a 747 he lands on one side
[14:41] and slides pum out on the other and
[14:43] breaks his neck on the other side and
[14:44] say now that's some slick Christians
[14:47] Hallelujah we want to be so honed in the
[14:51] presence of God that we will have a
[14:54] resistance in our life to sin Darkness
[14:59] Hallelujah until one day the spirit of
[15:01] God will so saturate our beings that
[15:05] death itself will fall off of our bodies
[15:08] and in a moment in a weing of an eye our
[15:11] hair color is going to be changed our
[15:13] age will be changed we'll all become the
[15:16] same age in a moment of time what a
[15:19] miracle and the same message that
[15:22] brought that to
[15:24] us will also usher in the tribulation
[15:27] period right and the atomic bombs will
[15:30] start flying I'm sure you've heard just
[15:32] this week with President Biden doing
[15:34] what he's done to Ukraine and allowing
[15:37] our missiles called attacks are the
[15:40] names that they go by allowing Ukraine
[15:43] to start singing them further into
[15:45] Russia Russia has responded yesterday
[15:48] and some today with icbms and now Russia
[15:52] Putin has signed a document that has
[15:54] lowered the threshold of his nuclear
[15:58] Doctrine what the call nuclear Doctrine
[16:00] well we got some nuclear Doctrine too
[16:02] it's nuclear to the soul praise God I
[16:05] ain't worried about the bombs are you no
[16:07] I I'm more concerned about the truth of
[16:09] this hour because I don't believe we're
[16:12] ever going to see it noow we we are
[16:14] going to take this Rapture by the word
[16:17] of God oh Hallelujah Hosea 12:10 I have
[16:22] also spoken
[16:24] by oh my
[16:27] goodness I have have
[16:30] spoken by the
[16:33] prophets so let's look at it like this
[16:36] what if this
[16:40] message is sent from
[16:43] God people laugh
[16:47] ridicule make fun of
[16:51] criticize now let's look at it in this
[16:53] sense if this message is not sent from
[16:57] God
[17:00] what have you give
[17:02] up that has been so bad for you look I
[17:05] mean some of the Aries live just like we
[17:07] do that's some right here today Amish
[17:10] people and Hut out different ones that
[17:11] was going to help build some buildings
[17:13] in the Reconstruction over here in the
[17:15] flood and I talk to one of them one of
[17:17] them that's that owns a construction
[17:18] company nice people the woman looked
[17:21] just like any of you sisters except she
[17:23] had the thing up here on top of her head
[17:25] she had long hair she had a long skirt
[17:27] dressed decent all that the man himself
[17:30] very nice courteous no bad language
[17:32] nothing like that really nice people so
[17:35] just looking Holiness some of the
[17:37] apostolic people still do that but that
[17:39] within itself will not make us ready for
[17:42] a Rapture but God has things to say that
[17:46] are more than Holiness so or you say
[17:49] well we've had to give up we we can't
[17:51] wear pants at our church the alies don't
[17:53] either hudats don't you know many the
[17:56] people there's still some of them left
[17:57] around the world you know being being
[17:59] being a missionar as I have over the
[18:00] seas over the world and you go into
[18:02] different parts of Africa it's very
[18:04] unusual Kenya Tanzania Zimbabwe some of
[18:07] those African countries very unusual to
[18:09] see a woman with pants
[18:11] on thousands times thousands times
[18:14] thousands of them still wear dresses
[18:16] it's just their attire it's just what
[18:17] they do here in America of course we're
[18:19] totally different so it's not just the
[18:21] clothes so we live clean so we live
[18:24] thing we think on things like that
[18:25] praise God you know people say well I
[18:27] give up the message and what does that
[18:29] mean exactly when people say well I
[18:31] walked away from the message so what
[18:33] does the message preach the message
[18:35] preaches this is some of our Doctrine
[18:38] I've got it written down sometime I hope
[18:40] the Lord let lets me bring it to you but
[18:42] this is what the message teaches that we
[18:45] are lost without the blood of the Lord
[18:48] Jesus so when people say they leave the
[18:50] message are they leaving that we believe
[18:53] Jesus died for our sins is that right we
[18:56] believe we are born lost right that's
[18:59] what the message teaches so when people
[19:01] leave the message do they leave that we
[19:04] believe in justification for we are
[19:06] Justified is that right according to the
[19:08] word of God so when people leave the
[19:09] message do they leave that we believe in
[19:11] sanctification do we not so when people
[19:14] leave the message they leave
[19:17] that we believe in predestination for
[19:20] whom he did for no he did also
[19:21] predestinate to be conformed to the
[19:23] image of his son that he might be the
[19:24] firstborn among many Brethren so do they
[19:26] leave predestination we believe in
[19:29] election the message teaches that the
[19:31] message teaches us for knowledge so when
[19:33] people say they leave the message what
[19:35] exactly does that mean that means
[19:37] they're leaving all these
[19:42] scriptures but let me tell you what most
[19:45] of them mean they're not going to set
[19:47] under a prophet
[19:48] messenger they don't want his name
[19:50] called they don't want his picture in
[19:52] their house they don't want this and
[19:54] that and the other it's not so much the
[19:56] scriptures it's not so much that it's
[19:59] being identified with God's
[20:02] Prophet well you imagine if you had
[20:04] lived in the days of Paul and Timothy
[20:06] got up to preach a sermon and Timothy
[20:09] would have had his notes there maybe he'
[20:11] used a few Old Testament scriptures and
[20:13] he's saying now brothers and sisters I
[20:15] just got this letter the other day and
[20:18] it was written by our beloved brother
[20:19] Paul and it was written to the church at
[20:23] thessalonica but I noticed here in
[20:25] reading this that brother Paul said he
[20:27] told the church that thessalonica to
[20:30] read the epistle which was written to
[20:32] the leans and let the leans read the one
[20:35] that was written to them so there
[20:37] they're stand and say a visor come in
[20:39] service at night and come in and sat
[20:40] down they said oh Lord have
[20:43] mercy a that Paul guy wasn't he the one
[20:47] that
[20:48] they I mean this guy was a wouldn't was
[20:51] this guy in
[20:52] prison no doubt he's guilty no doubt
[20:55] they Lord they ain't no telling what in
[20:57] the world he is in boy if there's smoke
[20:59] there's fire somewhere oh there ain't no
[21:02] way he could have been no prophet of God
[21:04] been thrown in jail in and out of jail
[21:07] stood before Nero himself why my
[21:10] goodness and yet that man stood up there
[21:12] and read from him oh I can't believe it
[21:18] if You' have lived in the first century
[21:20] that's what they would have
[21:22] done and you know what here we live in
[21:25] the last century in the last age of of
[21:28] time and we're doing the same thing
[21:32] because we believe the alpha has become
[21:36] the
[21:37] Omega and the Omega is going to reach a
[21:41] place of such maturity that we will call
[21:45] the alpha out of the
[21:47] Grave
[21:50] Hallelujah I'm feeling a little bit
[21:52] religious right now I have also spoken
[21:55] by the prophets I have mult multiplied
[22:00] visions and
[22:02] used
[22:04] similitudes by the
[22:07] minist of the
[22:11] prophets praise God
[22:14] Matthew
[22:16] 223 and he came and dwelt in a city
[22:20] called
[22:21] Nazareth that it might be
[22:25] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[22:29] prophets he shall be
[22:32] called a
[22:35] Nazarene well what difference did that
[22:39] make why would why would Jesus even need
[22:42] the word of the prophets but if you'll
[22:44] study your new testament you'll find the
[22:47] four gospels and also the Pauline
[22:50] Epistles constantly are referring to
[22:53] what the prophets had to say you see our
[22:57] faith is what is called
[22:59] judeo Christian and what that means is
[23:03] that it is based upon the principles of
[23:07] Judaism judeo Christian we are the true
[23:12] original judeo Christian faith because
[23:17] we still believe that God can use
[23:21] prophets praise the Lord now let me read
[23:24] this to you again then I'm going to
[23:25] shock you he came and dwelt in a city
[23:28] called Nazareth that it might be
[23:30] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[23:34] prophets he shall be called a
[23:38] Nazarene any person under the sound of
[23:41] my voice tonight or anybody that'll hear
[23:43] this I'll give you
[23:48] $1,000 if you will show me where one of
[23:52] the prophets of the Old Testament wrote
[23:54] it down and said he will be called
[23:59] a
[24:02] Nazarene hello
[24:05] testing frequency voided frequency
[24:08] voided they didn't understand
[24:11] me now for those who want to be and say
[24:14] oh brother Bram said things brother well
[24:16] why don't you read your Bible people
[24:18] quote this scripture I oh yeah the
[24:21] prophet said well show me where the
[24:23] Prophet said it
[24:31] hello watch in Matthew
[24:34] 5:17 think not that I am come to destroy
[24:38] the
[24:44] law oh my goodness we're reading this
[24:47] out of the New Testament brother Mala
[24:49] think not that I am come to destroy the
[24:51] law or the
[24:53] prophets I am not come to destroy but to
[24:57] fulfill
[25:00] Matthew 7:12 therefore all things
[25:02] whatsoever you would that men should do
[25:04] to you do even so to them for this is
[25:09] the law and the prophets now remember I
[25:12] told you the last time we spoke on this
[25:14] that people who think themselves Bible
[25:16] scholars and they try to quote from John
[25:18] and say well the law and the prophets is
[25:20] under John and then from that time the
[25:22] Kingdom of Heaven is preached and people
[25:24] pressed away into it and they try to use
[25:26] that scripture to say that there are no
[25:28] more prophets it shows how scripturally
[25:30] ignorant they really are this reference
[25:33] is made over and over again in the New
[25:36] Testament in these two segments or
[25:39] categories the law and the prophets is
[25:42] simply identifying the Torah and the
[25:47] prophets Hosea Amos Malachi Zachariah
[25:51] all the prophets the two distinctions of
[25:54] the Old Testaments was called the law
[25:58] and the prophets now what's amazing is
[26:00] that the our Christian faith come out of
[26:03] the foundation of Judaism and brought
[26:06] right into this notice again therefore
[26:08] all things whatsoever you would that men
[26:10] should do to you do you even so to them
[26:13] for this is the law and the prophets
[26:16] Matthew 11:13 for all the prophets and
[26:19] the law prophesied unto John what are we
[26:23] talking about now the law all the
[26:26] prophets and the law basically the Old
[26:30] Testament the Old Testament prophesied
[26:34] unto John Matthew
[26:36] 23:29 woe unto you scribes Pharisees
[26:39] Hypocrites because you build the
[26:42] tombs of the prophets and garnish the
[26:46] sepers of the righteous and say if we
[26:49] had been in the days of our fathers we
[26:52] would have been partakers we would not
[26:54] have been partakers oh my with them in
[26:57] the blood of the prophet oh I'll tell
[26:58] you one thing if IID have lived in the
[27:00] days of Jeremiah I would have never
[27:03] allowed them to put rotted claws under
[27:06] his armpits and allow them to put a rope
[27:09] around the upper torso of his body and
[27:12] put him in a rope across a pulley and
[27:15] put him down into a pit that was kneed
[27:18] deep in mud and allow that prophet of
[27:21] God I would have never stood by and
[27:24] allowed them to put Isaiah's body in a
[27:27] hollow law and take a Crosscut saw and
[27:31] cut that prophet in two while he's
[27:33] screaming and begging for mercy I'd have
[27:36] never done
[27:38] it and yet they'll get on
[27:41] YouTube and make a little personal video
[27:44] of how I escaped the message cult and
[27:49] the false prophet William
[27:51] brandom no you didn't kill el you didn't
[27:54] kill Elijah the first time he was here
[27:56] but you try to kill his INF fluence
[27:59] now well praise the lord they're doing
[28:02] exactly what the word says they would do
[28:04] wherefore ye be
[28:07] Witnesses unto
[28:10] yourselves that ye are the children of
[28:13] them which
[28:15] killed the
[28:18] prophets oh my so you see we would
[28:21] transport a lot of these people today
[28:24] that are doing and saying what they're
[28:25] doing against the message of the hour
[28:27] they they would have been the ones who
[28:30] would have let Jeremiah Down the Well
[28:33] they would have been the very ones that
[28:36] would have called Jesus be elub they
[28:39] would have been the ones that done
[28:41] terrible horrible
[28:43] things and you would have been the ones
[28:47] who would have followed their
[28:49] message you ought to be pretty happy
[28:52] tonight no matter where God would have
[28:54] put you in any age your seed
[28:58] would have brought out the same thing
[29:01] you'd have responded in the days of Noah
[29:03] brother Bobby you've been helping build
[29:05] the ark in the days of lucer you've been
[29:08] shouting praise God I've been justified
[29:11] by by faith in the days of wesa you'd
[29:14] have been laying on the floor as a Holy
[29:16] Roller you've been shouting under
[29:19] sanctification but God allowed you to
[29:21] live in the body change age under the
[29:24] ministry of Malachi 4 thanks be to God
[29:28] and we are so happy to Bear the reproach
[29:32] of Our Lord are we not let me read one
[29:35] more scripture we'll close wherefore
[29:38] behold I
[29:40] send unto
[29:43] you prophets now I want you to notice
[29:47] who this
[29:48] is the Lord Jesus he is not saying this
[29:54] in the past tense
[29:57] form but
[30:00] future now people want to argue with it
[30:03] let them argue with him wherefore behold
[30:05] I send unto you prophets and wise men
[30:07] and scribes and some of them you shall
[30:13] kill and
[30:15] crucify some of them shall you Scourge
[30:18] in your synagogues and persecute them
[30:23] from City to
[30:26] City so from Tucson to Louisville to
[30:30] Johnson City brother Ron told me the
[30:33] other day those articles are actually
[30:35] published in the paper there in uh in
[30:38] Harrisonburg so from City to City to
[30:42] city they're persecuting and when they
[30:46] persecute us they are persecuting the
[30:48] message of the hour by doing that
[30:51] they're persecuting the fruit of God's
[30:54] prophet's Ministry when they persecute
[30:57] that the persecuting the Lord Jesus
[31:02] himself that's why the Lord Jesus could
[31:05] say to Paul Saul Saul why persecutest
[31:09] thou
[31:11] me now it might be hard for you to
[31:13] comprehend but being a preacher and
[31:16] preaching this message I have had death
[31:19] threats on my life several
[31:23] times Brother Gary Hara brother Joe's
[31:25] father and I was talking about it to
[31:27] today in a meeting I preached in
[31:29] Kentucky several years ago and when I
[31:31] pulled up on the parking lot of that
[31:33] meeting where it was at it was acting
[31:35] camp gr where brother brand would
[31:36] preached there in
[31:38] 1955 there was two guys met me with guns
[31:42] on their
[31:43] hips so I thought what in the world
[31:45] Brother Gary was
[31:47] there and I didn't know what was going
[31:50] on brother Charlie Cox had hosted the
[31:52] meeting and some people had called and
[31:54] threatened to kill
[31:55] me for what cuz I somebody else's wife
[31:59] cuz i' stole money no because he
[32:02] preached the
[32:03] word you think You' never believe in
[32:06] this day would we the people would be
[32:08] that far gone look friend the
[32:09] pre-tribulation period anointing it's
[32:12] already here people are not that far
[32:15] from murder right now look at what
[32:17] people are doing that lost the election
[32:19] people are insane just seeing people
[32:22] that's lost the election didn't go the
[32:23] way they wanted it to do they're out of
[32:25] their minds thank God for Grace to keep
[32:28] us now can you imagine these men
[32:30] surrounded me they went they took me to
[32:32] a certain room they stayed outside I
[32:34] told them I want to be by myself and
[32:36] pray they wouldn't let me go to the
[32:37] bathroom by myself they followed me to
[32:39] the bathroom they followed me Under the
[32:42] Tent back and forth every night because
[32:44] somebody threatened to kill me several
[32:46] years ago whenever I preach some things
[32:48] again threats from all over the United
[32:50] States people going to come and boycott
[32:52] and kill you saying why why you know why
[32:56] cuz I was preaching the message of the
[32:59] hour now if I would have went through it
[33:02] and left this out and left that out and
[33:05] not make don't body man you know what
[33:07] boy if I say that right there o that
[33:09] won't go over very good so Lord I'll
[33:11] just kind of conveniently slide that
[33:13] under here and I I believe it with all
[33:15] my heart but I ain't going to preach
[33:17] that and and get me in trouble no that's
[33:20] not the kind of preacher I
[33:22] am if God lays it on my heart I'm going
[33:25] to say it sir and we yes sir I am proud
[33:30] to be identified with the message of the
[33:33] hour let them call us whatever they want
[33:35] to call us and you know what we're going
[33:36] to do back to them we're not going to
[33:38] call them names we're not going to
[33:40] ridicule them we're not going to make
[33:41] fun of them we're going to pray for them
[33:44] and pray that God will help them and be
[33:47] merciful and we hope and pray they've
[33:50] not crossed that line you imagine let me
[33:54] close with this the Lord Jesus said some
[33:57] of them they shall kill and crucify some
[34:00] of them they'll Scourge
[34:03] prophets so if the days of prophets is
[34:06] over apparently the Lord Jesus did not
[34:09] get that note I guess somehow the
[34:12] Post-it note must have fell off of
[34:13] jesus' text that day and Jesus didn't
[34:16] realize the prophets after John was over
[34:18] when he himself said I'm going to send
[34:20] you
[34:21] prophets Matthew 23:37 let's stand
[34:25] together oh jerus Jerusalem
[34:29] Jerusalem thou that killest the prophets
[34:33] and stonest them which are sent unto
[34:35] thee how often would I have gathered thy
[34:38] children together even as a hen gathers
[34:41] her chickens under her
[34:44] wings and you would
[34:47] not oh I don't know that I'll ever
[34:49] forget it but many years
[34:53] ago I was awakened by the spirit of God
[34:56] before daylight early one
[34:59] morning and I heard these
[35:02] words oh
[35:05] America
[35:06] America how of I would have gathered
[35:12] you and I heard his voice say America
[35:17] the
[35:18] Beautiful America the
[35:21] cursed
[35:22] America the
[35:25] Beautiful America
[35:27] the
[35:31] Damned we ought to be so happy
[35:34] tonight because that's where we would be
[35:37] if it wasn't for the mercy of
[35:40] God don't you love him with all your
[35:43] heart God called us out of that mess
[35:47] let's not go back into
[35:49] it you understand the love of God
[35:53] Malachi 4 says behold I sent unto you
[35:56] Elijah the prophet before the great and
[35:58] Dreadful day of the Lord then he tells
[36:00] us why then he tells us goes on in verse
[36:02] 6 lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[36:09] curse the Advent of Malachi
[36:13] 4:5 delayed The Curse Of God long enough
[36:18] to call out a people in a
[36:22] Rapture and to set in
[36:24] motion the resurrection of the Dead
[36:28] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[36:31] curse it will take more than building
[36:33] churches it'll take more than having
[36:36] singing
[36:37] conventions only
[36:40] Elijah will keep it
[36:43] off thank god let's bow our
[36:48] heads thank you Lord
[36:51] Jesus Heavenly
[36:54] Father we're so grateful tonight Lord
[36:57] for the
[37:00] prophets those fire brands that you've
[37:02] send down Through the
[37:06] Ages oh
[37:08] God I
[37:10] remember in my earlier days of being a
[37:13] Christian being a
[37:15] preacher how I
[37:18] wondered in
[37:20] darkness I wasn't out drinking running
[37:23] around all that but I just didn't know
[37:26] the truth
[37:29] Lord I I I read my Bible I believed it I
[37:34] memorized great portions of it and when
[37:37] I would preach I would quote
[37:40] scripture but yet I was blind to the
[37:43] meaning of those
[37:46] scriptures until you led me to the
[37:49] message of Malachi
[37:51] 4 and this message did not make me take
[37:55] my Bible and Fold It Up and put it up on
[37:58] the shelf and never open it again but I
[38:01] love my Bible now more than ever
[38:04] before because this word opens up the
[38:07] scriptures and makes it so plain and so
[38:10] marvelous to
[38:12] us then we would sit and look at it and
[38:15] think how could people think we are so
[38:17] weird because all through the Old
[38:20] Testament and the new even Jesus himself
[38:23] said I will send
[38:26] prophets and he told us what the people
[38:28] would do to them and they are carrying
[38:31] it
[38:32] out but Lord Jesus we also know there's
[38:36] a people that will respond to the truth
[38:39] of those prophets and we're happy to say
[38:42] tonight we are one of
[38:45] them thank you
[38:47] Lord thank you
[38:49] Lord Lord God open our hearts to even
[38:52] greater understanding of where we are in
[38:55] the end
[38:56] Time Lord we want to worship we want to
[38:59] praise we want to pray we want to have a
[39:02] church we want to carry on in the way
[39:06] you wish us to but may we not be so
[39:10] zealous and after our own
[39:12] desires that we as David will leave out
[39:16] a part that may seem very insignificant
[39:20] to us just the
[39:24] Levites and the Levites carrying the
[39:26] word
[39:28] over their
[39:29] hearts and we say well that really is
[39:32] not that big of a deal
[39:35] anymore Lord God may we not leave out
[39:39] anything father may we desire and hunger
[39:43] and thirst for all that which
[39:47] is essential oh Lord
[39:50] God we worship you tonight Jesus we
[39:54] bless your name father
[39:57] thank you for this time that we can be
[39:59] together thank you for your anointing
[40:02] Lord which I felt so powerful thank you
[40:05] for it
[40:07] Lord we rejoice in your presence Lord if
[40:10] there's any of these young people that
[40:11] are sick tonight May the angels of God
[40:15] pass through this place maybe there's
[40:17] some Lord that's really discouraged
[40:19] going through a hard time father would
[40:22] you bring
[40:23] Deliverance father maybe some of the
[40:25] parents some of those that Lord weren't
[40:27] here tonight and they streamed the
[40:29] service but they've got needs and
[40:31] they're they've got their heads bowed
[40:32] around their iPad or their their laptop
[40:35] there in the name of Jesus May the
[40:38] spirit of God go to them Lord Lord we're
[40:41] getting testimonies after testimonies of
[40:43] people that have been delivered by the
[40:46] Wednesday night services just a couple
[40:48] of Wednesday nights ago of depression
[40:50] and sadness and all that people that
[40:53] live thousands of miles away from here
[40:55] they may be thousands of miles away away
[40:57] from us but the a thousands of miles
[40:59] away from you and you love to deliver
[41:03] your children
[41:04] father we love your word Lord we're not
[41:07] here to make an idol out of our Prophet
[41:09] we're not here to worship him we worship
[41:12] you because he pointed us to you Lord
[41:16] Jesus Oh hallelujah thank you for this
[41:20] message Father oh it's cost me so much
[41:24] but Lord God the blessings that it's
[41:27] brought so outweighs the cost oh Jesus I
[41:33] would go through all I've went through
[41:35] over and over again
[41:39] hallelujah oh Jesus I I was kicked out
[41:43] by my family Lord turned down by my own
[41:47] family Lord they wouldn't speak to us
[41:50] for years and weren't invited to know of
[41:53] family functions or events but Lord God
[41:56] I do it again rejected by my preacher
[42:00] friends that I knew oh Lord lies told on
[42:04] me that's all right that's okay Lord oh
[42:09] Jesus it's been worth every trial every
[42:13] test Lord God help me to be true help
[42:17] every young person here tonight Lord
[42:19] they also have borne reproach they've
[42:21] been laughed at the sisters because of
[42:24] their hair and the dress and the
[42:26] brothers because of various things but
[42:29] Lord help them when they get weary of it
[42:32] all to know one day the Reckoning will
[42:37] come and when the Mount Zion Showdown
[42:40] comes we'll be changed in a moment in
[42:43] the twinkling of an eye and it won't be
[42:46] long after our
[42:48] departure Russia will be
[42:50] delivering Satan
[42:53] too with its multiple Warheads
[42:57] delivered on their great bomber the
[43:00] spirit as it's
[43:02] called and we would be here
[43:05] too were it not for the message yes of
[43:08] Malachi
[43:09] 4 but as you sent a prophet to deliver
[43:12] your people out of Egyptian bondage you
[43:16] sent prophets down through the ages to
[43:18] bring them out of the bondage they were
[43:20] in so you send us one of this day Lord
[43:24] to bring us out of the darkness
[43:28] trinitarianism all types of Dogma thank
[43:31] you Lord God we worship you Lord
[43:35] Jesus we worship you

[47:33] [Music]
[47:35] Away so thankful for that aren't you so
[47:39] thankful for whoever put that question
[47:43] in services that we've had brother
[47:46] Donnie's been on that
[47:48] question just made it pretty simple to
[47:52] me listening how he went through the Old
[47:54] Testament and into the New Testament cuz
[47:56] in the Old Testament God said I I am God
[47:59] and I change
[48:00] not and he had them prophets all the way
[48:03] through and in the Old Testament he
[48:06] spoke of prophets that were coming in
[48:07] the New
[48:08] Testament but then come you go into the
[48:11] New Testament Jesus said exactly what
[48:13] God Said in Isaiah when God said I am
[48:16] God and I change not Jesus said I am the
[48:18] same yesterday today and
[48:21] forever and so what did he he say there
[48:24] Ephesians
[48:25] 4 the fivefold ministry and included
[48:28] them was the prophets I asked a guy one
[48:30] time when he told me you know why in the
[48:32] world you believe in prophets I said
[48:34] show me where he took it out so now in
[48:37] in this day you've got the Leo seeing
[48:38] Church age all the way through every
[48:40] Church AG God's had
[48:43] prophets but for some reason in Leota
[48:45] he's decided not
[48:47] to people have taken what God did and
[48:51] they've taken a dead man and made him
[48:54] fulfill all five spots in Ephesians
[48:59] 4 they've changed God's never
[49:02] changed it's the spirit of Leota not
[49:05] God's
[49:07] spirit so if I don't know if you that's
[49:10] what you got out of that's what I got
[49:11] out of God said I I don't changed my
[49:13] plan from the day I said let there be
[49:16] his plan has always been the same and
[49:17] I'm so grateful for that because his
[49:19] plan included
[49:21] me and if his plan
[49:24] changed it's possibly his plan with me
[49:26] changed but it's never changed his plan
[49:28] for you has never changed if he saved
[49:31] you before the foundation of the world
[49:33] you will stay in that
[49:34] plan so grateful for that so grateful so
