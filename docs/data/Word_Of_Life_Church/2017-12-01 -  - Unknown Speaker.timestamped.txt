[0:00] and you know I would say that it would
[0:01] be a universal cry in this building
[0:03] tonight if I was just to ask for a show
[0:06] of hands to say who here wants to be
[0:08] like Jesus I'm sure all of us would
[0:10] raise our hand and say I want to be like
[0:12] Jesus I want to be like the Lord and his
[0:15] nature in his character then let's find
[0:18] out what produced this man as
[0:22] we know the prophet of God says
[0:24] character is not a gift but it's a
[0:27] victory oh don't let that become a cheap
[0:30] statement to you it has value to me
[0:33] character is not a gift it's not
[0:36] something that somebody hands you or
[0:38] just falls on your lap someday but
[0:40] character is a victory and victory
[0:43] doesn't come without a struggle and
[0:45] victory doesn't come without a fight oh
[0:48] I tell you what I dare you to show me a
[0:51] man of God whose anointed with the
[0:53] Spirit of God who desires righteousness
[0:56] in his life that is trouble free worry
[0:58] free pressure free you won't find one
[1:00] but you'll find a man of God who's used
[1:03] to Fiery Furnaces you'll find a woman of
[1:06] God who's used to lonely nights in
[1:08] prayer you'll find a son of God who's
[1:10] used to the Lions Den he's used to
[1:12] struggle he's just a torment
[1:15] because that's the way God chose the
[1:19] path of suffering
[1:21] they could not strange when fiery trials
[1:24] are to try you knowing that the trial of
[1:27] your faith is much more precious than
[1:29] that of gold oh
[1:32] but it's so hard sometimes to have come
[1:35] this route of suffering what was it that
[1:39] formed the pressure of this man what
[1:41] what was it about this man in this
[1:44] garden of gethsemane as we see Jesus who
[1:48] was the son of God and Gethsemane here
[1:50] and he had spent his entire life and
[1:53] mission his entire purpose his entire
[1:56] calling his destiny was leading him to
[1:59] this moment of Gethsemane his destiny
[2:02] was urging him and pulling him history
[2:05] and prophecy was pushing and anointing
[2:09] and urging this great climb actually say
[2:11] what was the climax was it a kingdom was
[2:14] it money wasn't popularity was it fame
[2:16] or fortune no it was a cross on a hill
[2:20] far away it was Calvary it was a it was
[2:23] a path of death to his own will
[2:27] as I know I've we preached it here
[2:29] before what was the victory that Christ
[2:32] endured it was the victory over his own
[2:35] human will with the plan of God for his
[2:37] life it was when he could say as the
[2:40] Bible says he even asked twice Lord if
[2:42] it's at all possible let this cup pass
[2:45] from me if it's at all his humanity said
[2:49] if it's even possible Lord God if
[2:51] there's any other way if there's any
[2:53] other way let it pass for me what was it
[2:57] it was the battle over his own will and
[2:59] this is where the victory or the defeat
[3:01] is won tonight is on your own human mind
[3:04] as you struggle and you struggle with
[3:06] the plan of God and you struggle with
[3:08] the calling of God in your life and many
[3:10] many people let me say this here tonight
[3:12] are serving God they love the Lord they
[3:14] come to church but they are not in the
[3:16] plan of God and the purpose for God for
[3:18] their life
[3:20] because many times they know that's a
[3:22] path of sorrow sometimes a path of
[3:24] torment a path of of suffering
[3:28] but we all say we want to be like Jesus
[3:31] but do we want to come Jesus his way as
[3:33] he says how I learned obedience by the
[3:37] things I suffered
