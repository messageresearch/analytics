guy and I don't know how they think or how they operate amen because hey I've been in this just about practically all my life and I don't know how some of them operate and think I know I'll bet there's some Ginuwine out there that's a let's go maybe a little bit of something they man but I don't know but me and you we know what it is amen and we constantly think about these things amen and that's talking about to give up my dad said it's all - we made my wife planning on flying home to tend to Texas Christmas and see everybody I don't know if you know me or not and you know sometimes I hate to go and face it you know in some way and if the Lord Saturn always is going to have to face something like that one these days unless we get out of here in a bar and that's what I'm hoping for that's what I'm trusting in God here that I can take my wife by the hand amen and we get out of here together in a body change but until then we've got to keep pressing but I don't know how they think but at night I think I said God if I miss it the scripture says if you couldn't handle it if you can keep up with those soldiers they meant what when the horses come amen he said well listen if I don't make it in the rapture I'll get my act together and surely I'll make it in the tribulation oh god if you can't make it now how about it when the tribulation comes amen and I think about them things sometimes brother Jim I don't know how they think but mean you've been privileged to know what was though God's mind it ought to make us fall in love with him that much more thank you God you don't have to call me what you did you didn't have to choose me out of the millions out of the billions he chose you to let you realize the hour and the day that you're living in well they don't to make us fall in love with him all over again hallelujah thank you lord hey man he said you know his bride whispering secrets to her you know how you tell you what things you know the little girl you're going to marry you love her so much you just tell her the secrets and get her up next to you and love you and everything you know how it is that's what Christ is doing to the church see he's letting her know the secrets just the secrets not these flirter I mean his wife see oh my love falling in love with him let's look at the courtship now hey man this alright this morning let's look at the courtship it's our token message hey man 1963 listen what he says he said love love love him he said see what it's done for you it's my love and love brings obedience love brings courtship love brings marriage that's where we're headed that marriage supper of the Lamb I can hear my Savior calling that he loves me too hey man I can hear him calling this morning amen he's calling come up come up hey man into this perfect word come up I could hear her my the Albany calling me hey it's a calling me a man hallelujah again doors in the door 1965 he said but see it's the church it's like the church has to pass through the Hall of critics we go you're going to be called Holy Roller you're going to be called everything but if you can only hold your position in Christ then Sunday he'll take us to the Hall of Fame but first we got to stand criticism that's where the littleness of us stands that's where it shows he cannot stand he that cannot stand chastisement is the illegitimate child and not a child of God no matter how much he's joined Church and whatever he's done his still if he's cannot stand chastened Tasmin he's illegitimate and he's not a real child of God but a real genuine child of God don't care what the world says everything else is secondary hey man I hope this morning but everything else this morning its secondary hey man your ballgames a secondary hey man hey man everything else your job secondary hey man but this war to God it'll live on forever hey man he said he's got in his mind he got his mind on Christ and that settles it him yes whatever Christ says he'll do it whatever cross says he'll do it hey man hallelujah what - Naomi tell Ruth told her how what was gonna happen hey man said hey Boaz ain't gonna rest to his kinsmen work is over with his redeeming work is over with said he's not gonna rest amen Andrew said when she told Naomi told Ruth what to do and you know what Ruth said all golf's a us I'll do hey man he's told me and you what to do a man at all I'll say us I'm gonna do it ain't man how do you like me I like you sisters I like your dresses below your knees where you're sitting while you're standing although I'll say us I'll do I'll do it I'll do it Lord how do you like me walk I like your walk be holy holy unto the Lord I'll do it Lord hey man I'll do it Lord hallelujah hey man whatever wherever the lamb goes there with him wherever and then you see his appearing his presence and what he does he always with he's always with his people his bride he's courting her someday there's going to be a wedding supper hallelujah hallelujah let's look at the engagement hey man we're Bream Sid on revelations chapter 4 part 1 1960 listen what he says and isn't that just exactly what they say today how could a bunch of holy rollers a bunch of people that can hardly write their own names how could they ever be the church how would a group like that ever be but that's just alright when we got engaged and felt that but the royal kiss of Jesus on our hearts to take away our sins something tells us he's coming back again amen and they sung that song he's coming back just like he said hey man he's coming back for me I got his ring oh hey man my god I've been engaged to him I've been but thrown to him a man and he's coming back you remember that story that the Prophet told about that man that came down from Chicago looking for a wife made a promise for the girl all she wasn't much to look at like the other girls were there but he found character in her a man and said I'm coming back in a year said I'm going to prepare a place and I'm gonna come back and receive you again hey man and that whole year they meant all they made fun of her but she took what she made and begin to make herself ready begin to prepare herself hey man when it was almost about the time for him to come all they begin to harass her they be getting to make all kinds of name-calling all kinds of names but she had the promise hey man we got a promise a man he said he's coming back just like he said he did 1963 a man he came back a man opened up to us the Word of God a man chose a bride a man with character that was like his character that's why Lanza went to that widow woman why because she was of the same caliber as Elijah was that's why he came to me and you this morning because he realized that menu was of the same caliber as Malachi 4 was a man thank you lord hey man hallelujah she begin to hear a man then wills of that wagon the horse is beating her a man on the ground a man she let out that door hey man come away with me well one these days we're gonna hear the sound hey man the rapture is upon us amen we're getting out don't look for me cuz I'm gonna be go hallelujah amen hallelujah thank you Lord again he says on oneness 1962 now the church now is engaged to cross for the wedding the wedding has never been performed yet it will be at the wedding supper Amen it said it will be at the wedding supper of the Lamb so you see the church is now engaged then you said the truth he said you see that the church is now engaged like a man engaged his wife what does he do while they're engaged he'd just be storing all kinds of things send her presents making her feel good well that's what Christ is doing to his church he's sending us gifts of the Spirit how can you be engaged then when you're denying these kids exist it's the very blood tokens it's God's token to the church jesus said so these signs shall follow them that believe amen it says love tokens to us so brother Charlie I want everything that God's got for me every little gift he's got for me I wanted a man that ain't gonna deny that I'm a man I want everyone that God's got for me man don't you a man he said wouldn't it be so awful for what for a lady to deny those gifts that that man that when she was engaged to that means you wouldn't want to be his wife hey man I don't want to deny her denounce any of them again in the same message he said again he said I'll keep those things in mind the church must believe every word every promise every iota and claim it for themselves I'm claiming every promise for myself this morning a man I'm claiming on Hill just morning hey man if you're sick claim it with me this morning come on delivered this morning amen I'm overcoming this morning I'm the Christian this morning I'm the bride across this morning [Applause] hallelujah hey man everything I'm claiming it for me and exercises themselves in it hey man that's what I want to do exercise myself in it if I'm down this morning hey man I'm coming to the church with a smile on my face with a praise on my heart with a song on my lips and sing hard if nobody works with you I'm gonna worship ya then nobody wants to make love to you I'm gonna make love to you if nobody wants to talk to your Lord I'm gonna talk to you if nobody wants to worship your lord I want to worship you that's how you give the devil a black eye hey man raise your hands when you don't feel like raising your hands a man shot when you don't feel like shouting dance when you don't feel like dancing [Applause] hallelujah there's been a lot of times when I didn't feel like going to church my walk the other day she said David I got such an awful headache I said about I don't even feel like going hey man but she said you know what I'm gonna go anyway then man heaven came down hallelujah hey man when you've done you all the greater the sacrifice the greater the blessing hey man when you've done your best [Music] hallelujah I want to give him my best hey man so he says the exercise if I was engaged a girl that was a single man I'd send her something an engagement ring she wouldn't wear it then that shows she doesn't believe me see see she doesn't want to be my bride but if Christ sends his church the gifts that he promised and they reduced him and they're not say they're not so they don't want to be the Bride of Christ they're exposed to some other lover and not to Christ oh this morning I don't want to be in smiles and some other lover but I want to be smiles to my husband amen and that's Christ the word for the hour and the day that we're living in amen he said it not to cross the broad room so the real church keeps the promise and keeps all in that sense the gifts that God sins he says all right hey man so now we're going to look at the marriage certificate and the wedding man hey man he said only invisible union of the bride 1965 they said no your old book is gone with your old Union now your name in your hole has been transferred now you say do you mean to tell me that my old but God put it in his sin forgetfulness you stand perfectly before God hallelujah he put it in the sit foregiveness under his blood you stand perfect before God hey man I stand perfect before God you stand perfect before God amen you stand perfect in him like I said I might not see no holiness about you but in him your holy tonight this morning amen in him your unblameable in him your Unruh provable hey man it's like Jack Coe one time said his mother got saved hey man and they was in the supermarket and they would shot all sudden he heard Jack hurt his mother on the other side said glory to God hallelujah we know there's certain Bob said mama what's wrong with you so you see this can of tomatoes you see that red label said it reminds me of the blood of Jesus Christ but all of a sudden they both got the shot right up down that the grocery store with him carts giving praise to God giving it to the way they feel felt hey man when Jack came to he was standing at the butcher's counter that old butcher was crying took that old bloody apron wiped the tears and sweat for this face and said you've been down there that tent revival said my wash down there went down there she's got saved I can't live with her now and right there he gave his heart to Christ hallelujah hey man under the blood perfect hey man hallelujah hey man he dropped it and it see if forgiveness never-to-be remember no more I might remember you might remember but God came [Applause] I'm so glad a man said you stand perfectly now your name is now in the new book none of the book of life but the Lamb's Book alive what the Lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural union hey my Anna but your new bride hallelujah your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life you're a marriage certificate hallelujah true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold and something on the way down and the way down on the inside of the inside anchors it says hey man hey man I might not understand about any man hallelujah again beautiful union he said I notice you're not only that but you're going to the wedding in the wind sky and you're wearing the wedding band / destinated mary did grace thank you lord / destinated unmerited grace i wouldn't been at grace unmerited of your own God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on your own you there put your name on the book he said water Thanksgiving hallelujah praise our God water Thanksgiving I know this is not Thanksgiving but hey water Thanksgiving what water you yet hey man water celebration ah hey man that he put our neck and it was left before the foundation of the world he knew me yet he loved me talking about a love story it's the greatest love story of all female again this is what he says second coming to the Lord 19:55 7 he said in those days they didn't have wedding rings they had a tablet they call it tablet they put on their head it had ten coins and it went all around their head and that was a sign there was a married woman and no man was to fool with them no boys was to flirt with them they were married each of those coins and we can only have time but I have it I'm gonna try to keep my word as close as possible I can't tell you what each one of those coins met it was placed in there and each coin met a certain virtue of that woman the first meaning her loved her husband second her pledge a virtue to live clean for him in the third and fourth and fifth on to the ninth and tenth he says it again if you want to look it up same message if you want to look it up look in Galatians five you found out that that woman represents the representative church and the church is its POW isn't it spout swap the Christ and the tablet that the church is supposed to where it's found in Galatians five which is love joy peace longsuffering goodness maintenance gentleness patience that is the tablet that's supposed to be war and the church brotherly love kindness fellowship Oh hallelujah I want to make sure I got it all old amen every one of them real help me Lord hey man remember that woman in the Bible she lost one amen and she began to go and sweep their house so she can find that one that came up met what about us I want to look over every crook and cranny Amen took over every cobweb everything and made sure I got everything at all make sure I'm dressed in his word this morning amen hallelujah again he says blasphemous names then what does he do when he gives me the Holy Ghost he sets you out in a separate place to yourself March you see you're a different person then you're not in the world no more see you're clothed different you're dressed different not this outside dress no no you don't have to be odd and peculiar and colored turned around and a long ceremony like no no you don't need that you dress physically like this it's just a spiritual dress that counts the wedding garments been put on you what you are like Jesus well Guinea says the Seventh Seal 1963 we can see the elements ready to bring it back we can see the elements ready to bring the church into the press to Christ we can see the bride taking on the form putting the wedding garment on making ready we can see the lots of fruit flickering we know we're at the end Oh brothers and sisters we see it we're at the end my friends now let's look at the marriage ceremony hey man he said now the next thing on the message question answers 1964 he said now the next thing is to happen here's the Jewish or the Gentile elect a bride to be caught up with the rest of the Gentile elected bride that's been down through the ages he called be caught up in the presence of Christ in the heavens but dead raises the ones that's alive and remain is change and they're caught up together air to meet the Lord then because and the wedding ceremony in glory geez after that has caught up into the skies Jesus returns on the earth and makes itself known just people in the top of the like Joseph made himself known to his brothers and his wife no Gentiles was present nobody but Joseph alone when he made himself known to his brethren I'll understand that now again Feast of the trumpets or they are the first seal excuse me 1963 he said he has taken a Gentile bride and would take her from here to the palace to his father's house in glory for the wedding supper and will slip back down and make itself known to his brethren the 144,000 see there he stands and remember look at the cymbals perfectly brothers and sisters were going somewhere anyway again he says on the rapture 1965 he said in the trumpet with the sound of the trumpet and when it does it could always a trumpet called is or to the feast of the trumpets II which was the Pentecostal feast the great feast in the sky and the feast of the trumpets and now trumpet announcer calling together calling to the feast and now the Lambs suffering the staff that sitting together in the bride the feast of the trumpets the wedding supper he's called us to a feast he's called us to a wedding supper [Music] again he said on question answers 1964 he said he said his wife in the palace that's the type the bride would be in the palace and glory at that time being Jesus makes itself known to the June see after the wedding ceremony but three and a half years and Jacob's trouble that three and a half years the end of the seventeen week of daniel than my size to be cut off in the midst of and he prophesied three and a half years and was cut off been there Serena half years left yet for the prophets Moses and Elijah and then at the end of that seventy days and yet determine is yet determined upon the people as Daniel said then at the end of the seventy days Jesus make itself known to them he's the Prince that should come to the Jews see again he says we take for instance of marriage for Union we find out that the marriage we find the courtship and agreements then the marriage that should settle it for all time now that that same thing is with Christ the church see a courtship dog call into her hearts which surrender the marriage ceremony and the bride takes the bride Grimm's name hallelujah hallelujah hey man now let's look at the honeymoon you know in a wedding there's a bride and a groom they do their part they say their vows say I do and all that and you know they the minister says you can kiss the bride pronounce ameno ah the Hat you can kiss the bride and there's guests at that wedding but after it's all said and done the bride and the bridegroom go on the honeymoon the guest is left behind god help us no I don't want to be left behind I don't want to be part of the I want to be one of his bride help me Lord help me Father Oh God there's going to be somebody we made to face facts there's going to be somebody that's left behind god help us this morning as much as we know as long as we've been around the god help us this morning oh what a love story this is what he said future home he said help us Lord he said if there's one here but it's called to this wedding supper of the lamb the thousand years of millennium went rain and to them and to then enter into the city after the honeymoon is over the Millennium is merely the honeymoon then the bride takes his bride groom takes his bride home it's hers her bridegroom his bride oh he's going to prepare a house since he's become engaged may we be true to him who is the word for he is a word regardless how others trying to sacis keep us away from it north draw me nearer amen draw me nearer Lord again he's talking about the honeymoon future home he's in the future home the groom in the bride he's coming back for me to the wedding supper hey man he's coming back he said it's going to be the arena have they they didn't return again in the Millennium of our honeymoon and then he's going to bring the city into the view he's like the bridegroom taking his bride to her surprise hey man he's coming back now let's look at our future home on the message the future home 1964 brother bran says it like this he said now notice Jesus said John 14 now go and prepare a place oh what will it look like did you ever think now bride what it will look like hemmings ever thought these things surely we all have we've all got these things he said what will it look like it is prepared and designed by the divine architect now I don't know if there's any architects in the building this morning or not but hey I don't know too much about rigging blueprints or anything but there's somebody you know how you read them and he said it's designed and prepared by the divine architect hallelujah it's prepared and designed by the divine architect hallelujah oh oh listen what will that city look like there we're going to talk about it for a few minutes he says the divine architect has prepared it designed it and look it's designed with tender hands for his beloved bride he's designed it hmmm brother Charlie for me knew his bride by his tender hands hallelujah he's designed it now listen what he says he said what's it going to look like could you imagine a man marrying a wife that's able how he builds and puts every little thing just exactly to her touch just what she like he goes a man now I've never built a house probably can't but you ever build a house and maybe four you know maybe your wife and she'd come in so now I want the kitchen this way and you wanted just to her touch and I want it this way and maybe the man said whether the husband said well I like a den and I liked it this way and it's just to their touch the way they like it well he knows what men you like but divine architect and he's designed it to mean your touch hey man he's designed it the way me and you like it Amen like I said you may not like some things I like I'm in a lot but he's designed it the way I like it he's designed it the way you like it hey man again listen what he says he said now the divine architect has designed a new city where he will live with his bride just to her touch no wonder the Apostle said I has not seen ear has not heard or neither has it entered into the heart of man let's see if we can probe into it just for a moment see what it's going to look like the divine architect has designed this for his beloved see oh what a place it must be when divine nature a divine architect designed it for a divine attribute a man he'll the divine architect that designed it for me for you I divide attribute a man what I love story a man he's designed it for divine an attribute that's been divinely protestin aided by divine God hallelujah who is the author of divine love or divine life hallelujah so the divine architect has prepared it for divine attribute you're looking at the bond attribute I'm looking at divine attributes this morning and my divine architect has prepared it for me his divine attribute that's been divinely podesta nated he knew I'd be here he knew you'd be here he knew you would say a man to the word man he knew you'd say that's right to the word oh you might not understand it like I said you might nothing God every I and cross every T but you could say man to the world something on the inside says that's right that's right hallelujah that's right and something in there and makes you want to live right and do right again in the future home listen what he says he said how the little bride stands there in all that she looks at in her future home oh brother Harry you've been somewhere I'd said like this so he's going on tape my wife watches it or listens or archives it and she's been won't mean I've been wanting to she wants me to take her and a lotta y'all not to be into the Biltmore and I guess it's lovely different tons of the season they say it's just beautiful and meaning her had a privilege a couple years ago three three about almost three years ago me I was out in Tucson and Phoenix doing some services preaching and we got to go up to Flagstaff and up there and we got to go to the Grand Canyon you know just driving along all of a sudden what grandeur what splendor but you know what that's just nothing when we stand there and see that city oh how the prophets said at that time we should sitting around that table thousands of miles long oh my I mean you are there battle-scarred veterans hallelujah all we've been through the walk battle we've been through trouble we've been through difficulty but we're sitting at that table of thousands of miles long and the King comes out and wipes the tears from our eyes said they'll cry no more it's all over thank you lord oh what a day that'll be what a day I'm looking forward to that day now a couple more things that were close let's look greater love listen what he said balm in Gilead 1959 he said in a good evening to all the servants of Christ present and in the radio land it's a privilege for me to come tonight speak into this fine audience and I've often wondered what I would do if I held in a charger cup a glass as we'd call it two drops he said just two drops of the little blood of the Lord Jesus he said how often he said I've often thought if I would be granted that privilege of packing two drops of the little blood of the Lord I thought my would that be a privilege he said just two drops in a cup he said I'd have a privilege I packing their little brother Lord he said how I would hold that to my heart walked so humbly and slowly and watching every step that I would not drop it or spill it in any way wouldn't you feel the same way if you just had two drops amen nation but then as I was thinking that tonight I have before me in the side the Lord a greater price than two drops of the little blood of our Lord I have the purchased of his blood hallelujah oh he said I wouldn't brother Bab he's an eye good if I could just put two drops he said I'll walk ever so slowly so humbly so I wouldn't spill it he said I was thinking that but tonight I got greater in front of me morning is the purchase of that blood oh what a love story listen he said I had the purchase of his blood his people that he gave his blood that his people might live so he thought more of his people oh you may be sitting here this morning he might say I'm just a nobody brother Donny don't know me brothers so do so don't know me brother David don't know me so-and-so don't know me I never got to shake the pastor's hand I never got to do this but listen so he thought more of his people then he did his own life so tonight or this morning whether you think you're nobody or if you think you're somebody he thinks more of you than he did his own life He gave His life that his people could leave us I hold this my audience tonight and the greatest respect because it's the purchase of his blood it's the purchase of the blood of the Lord hallelujah again question answers 1964 he said sometimes I may have to answer it may hurt it may scratch and I don't mean it to be that way I mention it with one purpose as I said Christ before me and I got to remember that it's him then I've got to get an account for so my first love is to him my second love is to you people and so his church that he's purchased with his own blood and he really loves you oh listen to this church you know the devil can get us the thing that Christ don't love us he's got us whipped but I just come to tell you this morning that we got the greatest love story of all and that pride God said them to drop sidewalk so carefully but I got the purchased of his blood before me and he said here he said I got to give an account he said my first love is to him my second love to you people and so his church that he's purchased with his own blood and he really loves you more than he loved his self because he gave his self for you your the purchased of his blood and I handle it just as careful and sincere as I know how but then in doing it some time you may think that was very rude remark I'm it's so blunt that I'm doing it with him in my mind to try to make the reverie buddy see that it just it must be this way it's not anything hurt or no more than just to make sure that the people gets it and I hope everybody receives it in that way and here we find out what is on our minds but he said he really loves you more than he loved his self because he gave himself for you what a love story stand together you love him this morning hallelujah let's just bow our heads have me Father Lord Jesus many things we looked at this morning father oh what a love story brother Ram said water food Stephen Lord you love this so much Lord that even before this world came into existence
