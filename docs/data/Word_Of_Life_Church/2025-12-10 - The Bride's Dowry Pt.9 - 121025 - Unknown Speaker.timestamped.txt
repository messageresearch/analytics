[10:26] over there. Don't you? How many of you
[10:28] glad to be in the house of the Lord
[10:29] tonight? What a privilege it is to get
[10:31] to be here. Brother Wade, Sister Anna,
[10:33] God bless your heart. So good to see
[10:35] these folks in service with us. Give
[10:37] them a good hand tonight if you will.
[10:39] Praise the Lord.
[10:42] Amen. We're going to look at our prayer
[10:43] request now. We got a message just a
[10:45] while ago that uh Interstate 26
[10:48] uh from Gray to Boon Creek or Boon Creek
[10:51] to Gray, whichever way you're going, is
[10:53] at a standstill. So, we may have some
[10:55] people that didn't make it tonight
[10:57] because of that or we'll be running a
[10:59] little bit late, but we just want to
[11:01] pray for traveling mercy for all those
[11:02] on the highways tonight. Uh, Sister
[11:05] Rebecca is asking for continued prayer
[11:07] for her three-year-old grandson whose
[11:09] name is Kanan. Please pray for his
[11:12] safety and well-being as his family and
[11:14] home life are very unsettled at this
[11:16] time. Thank you for your prayers. So, we
[11:18] want to remember that tonight. Sister
[11:19] Ruth Louise Jackson is asking for urgent
[11:22] prayer for her and her entire family.
[11:24] They're very concerned about the
[11:26] unsettling conditions where they are
[11:27] currently dwell dwelling and their
[11:29] desire is to be directed by the Lord for
[11:32] a safer place to live. So let's remember
[11:33] that prayer request tonight. Brother
[11:36] Frank Williams is asking for urgent
[11:37] prayer concerning his grandson John
[11:40] Johnson. Please pray that God will grant
[11:42] him the spiritual guidance and help he
[11:45] needs concerning his needs concerning
[11:47] his children's well-being. Brother Frank
[11:50] also wants everyone to know that he and
[11:52] Sister Jackie love and miss each and
[11:54] every one of you and would love nothing
[11:56] more than to be here to be in service to
[11:58] worship. So, we want to remember those
[12:00] folks tonight, those prayer requests. We
[12:02] love Brother Frank and Sister Jackie,
[12:04] don't we? Amen. Brother Curtis Hunnel
[12:06] wants to thank everyone for their
[12:08] continued prayers as he recovers from
[12:10] his recent fall. The pain has decreased
[12:13] and his strength has improved, allowing
[12:16] him to drive and walk with assistance.
[12:18] The MRI revealed a fractured pelvis that
[12:22] requires no surgery, but he will begin
[12:24] four weeks of physical therapy starting
[12:27] next week. So, we certainly want to pray
[12:28] for brother Curtis. The Lord would would
[12:30] remember him. This is from the Waco
[12:33] family. Dear church family,
[12:37] we sincerely appreciate continued
[12:39] prayers for brother Sam Waco and our
[12:40] family. He still feels pretty good
[12:43] overall other than tiring easily and
[12:45] sorish from this week's procedures. But
[12:47] after going through scans, blood work
[12:49] and laparoscopy has been given a serious
[12:52] diagnosis. He is facing a tremendous
[12:55] surgery possibly in January involving
[12:58] cancer removal and a chemo wash in his
[13:01] abdominal area. The surgery could take
[13:04] 12 hours or more followed by a few days
[13:07] in the intensive care with two weeks
[13:09] hospital stay and a long recovery to
[13:12] follow. The surgical oncologist openly
[13:15] confesses that we have a big God and she
[13:18] is just a vessel for God to use to help
[13:20] people. She said that Sam is a good
[13:22] candidate for this surgery and everyone
[13:25] to keep praying. Also, his job is very
[13:27] physical. He has been has lifting
[13:30] restrictions now. So, he's not able to
[13:32] work at this time, which is a great
[13:33] concern to him. We need God's leadership
[13:35] in all this. Thank you. We love you all.
[13:38] God bless you, the WCO family. Well, we
[13:40] love that family also, don't we? Amen.
[13:43] Praise the Lord. Sister Linda Jablski,
[13:46] autoimmune disease, can't get up without
[13:48] assistance. They're asking that we would
[13:50] remember her tonight as we pray. The
[13:52] Lord would be mindful of her. Sister
[13:54] Janet says she wants to be she's so very
[13:57] thankful for the continued prayers for
[13:59] my heart situation. Tomorrow they will
[14:01] try to shock it to get it back in
[14:03] rhythm. I know that our God is always in
[14:05] control and always on time. Well, we'll
[14:08] just commit that to the Lord. We
[14:09] appreciate Sister Janet also, don't we?
[14:11] Amen. Sister Shirley Robbins, severe
[14:14] back pain. Want to remember her tonight
[14:15] as we pray. Please remember Nean Caraway
[14:18] in prayer. The doctors have determined
[14:20] that he has strep and is very sick. Nean
[14:23] and his family would appreciate your
[14:25] prayers very much. So, we will certainly
[14:26] want to remember that. Brother Keith
[14:28] Phillips be having a root canal done
[14:30] tomorrow. Pray that all goes well. So,
[14:32] we want to remember that prayer request
[14:34] tonight. Sister Janet Kennedy says she
[14:36] has an important doctor appointment
[14:38] tomorrow. Please pray that I get good
[14:40] results. So, we just commit that to the
[14:42] Lord.
[14:44] And uh we may [clears throat] not know
[14:46] this family, but they go to brother
[14:47] Kenzer's Assembly over in Galax,
[14:50] Virginia. Uh the Anders family. They had
[14:53] a house fire. Uh their son was burned to
[14:56] death. Didn't make it out of the house.
[14:58] Uh Chris Anders, the father, is was in
[15:01] the is in the hospital with severe cuts,
[15:03] lacerations from getting out a window.
[15:07] uh just got a message a while ago that
[15:10] uh his breathing is decreasing because
[15:12] of uh lung uh I guess where he inhales
[15:15] smoke or whatever. So we want to we want
[15:18] to remember that family in prayer
[15:20] tonight as we pray that God would be
[15:21] mindful of them. And we have a brother
[15:23] Donniey's going to be praying over uh
[15:25] preaching and praying uh over prayer
[15:27] cloth for Willie McVeyy's wife, the guy
[15:31] that owns and runs Valley Forge Auction.
[15:34] just a very loving family and she's
[15:36] suffering from kidney cancer. Going to
[15:38] have to have a kidney removed I believe
[15:40] in January. So I told him that we would
[15:42] certainly get a prayer cloth and he said
[15:44] he'd be so thankful if we could do that
[15:46] for him. So let's remember that prayer
[15:48] request tonight as we pray that God
[15:51] would be mindful all the unspoken prayer
[15:52] request. I know there's tremendous needs
[15:55] in our group. We just commit all these
[15:57] things unto the Lord. We're serving a
[15:59] God that cares about our needs. You
[16:00] believe that tonight with all your
[16:02] heart? He's a caring God. Could we stand
[16:04] together tonight if you will? Let's sing
[16:06] just a little bit more of that that old
[16:08] song. Everybody will be happy over
[16:11] there. Mothers, fathers, sisters,
[16:14] brothers will be singing round the
[16:17] throne in that land where no
[16:19] [music and singing] one ever knows a
[16:21] care.
[16:24] And the Christians of all ages will join
[16:27] in [music] that triumph song. Everybody
[16:31] will be happy over there.

[18:13] for each one. I just pray for each one
[18:15] that put their request in just that the
[18:17] peace of God would go to them and just
[18:19] give them peace cuz that's what you
[18:21] promised, Lord. You didn't promise that
[18:22] we wouldn't go through trouble. You You
[18:25] said we were going to have trouble. We
[18:26] were going to have tribulation, but
[18:28] &gt;&gt; you'd give us your peace. That's all
[18:30] that matters, Lord, is your peace. So,

[29:27] Your ways [singing] are higher than
[29:29] mine.
[29:33] When I start to [music] doubt,
[29:36] [singing]
[29:36] help me believe
[29:39] in [music] somewhere [singing]
[29:42] so far above me. [music]
[29:49] Your [singing] ways are higher than
[29:52] mine.
[29:55] I want mountains [music and singing]
[29:57] to move.
[29:59] You want me to climb,
[30:02] so I'm going to [music] trust your
[30:05] [singing] work, your will, and your
[30:09] time.
[30:12] Your [singing and music] ways are higher
[30:15] than mine.
[30:17] [music]
[30:18] When I start to doubt,
[30:22] help me believe [singing]
[30:25] in somewhere
[30:28] so [music] far above me. [singing]
[30:35] Your [singing and music] ways are higher
[30:37] than mine.
[30:39] [singing]
[30:41] I want mountains to [music] move.
[30:44] You want me to climb. [singing]
[30:48] So [music] I'm going to trust your work,
[30:52] your will, [singing] and your time.
[30:58] Oh, [singing]
[31:00] [music] your ways [singing]
[31:04] are so much higher than mine.
[31:09] [singing]
[31:13] &gt;&gt; [music]
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Your [singing] ways are higher
[31:19] [singing]
[31:21] than mine.
[31:26] [music]
[31:34] [music]
[31:35] [applause]
[31:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[31:55] &gt;&gt; going through so [singing] many
[31:58] changes.
[32:02] What's the news for [singing]
[32:05] today?
[32:08] [music]
[32:09] Somebody's hurt. Somebody's [singing]
[32:13] aching.
[32:16] Somebody's [singing]
[32:17] trying to find a way.
[32:21] [singing]
[32:23] A [music] heavy heart can break
[32:26] [singing]
[32:26] your will. [music]
[32:30] A troubled soul leaves time [singing]
[32:33] standing still.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; [music]
[32:37] &gt;&gt; If [singing] you're hurting, please
[32:40] don't hide.
[32:43] Lift up your head. [singing] I'm on your
[32:47] side.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[32:50] &gt;&gt; But every mountain
[32:53] seems [music] too high.
[32:57] But every [singing] river
[33:00] looks too wide.
[33:04] When my dreams are lost and
[33:07] [singing and music]
[33:07] seen,
[33:11] Jesus
[33:13] rescues me. [singing]
[33:17] My faith is strong and carries me.
[33:21] [singing]
[33:23] Though sometimes [music] we
[33:26] still [singing] believe.
[33:30] My life is built [music] on this desire.
[33:34] Through the flood and through the fire,
[33:37] Jesus [music and singing]
[33:39] rescues me.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[33:43] &gt;&gt; I know [singing] you're looking for an
[33:47] answer,
[33:50] searching [singing] for some hope to
[33:53] [music] hold.
[33:56] Empty hands leave you waiting
[34:02] and praying [singing] for [music] a
[34:04] miracle.
[34:09] But Jesus hears your every
[34:13] cry. [singing]
[34:15] He sees the walls that you can climb.
[34:20] [singing]
[34:22] And he will heal your hurting
[34:26] soul [singing]
[34:29] and lead you safely to [singing] his
[34:32] home.
[34:36] Every mountain
[34:38] seems [music] too high [singing]
[34:42] and every river
[34:45] looks [music] too wide. [singing]
[34:48] When my dreams are lost and sea,
[34:56] Jesus [singing and music]
[34:58] rescues me.
[35:01] My faith is strong [singing] and carries
[35:05] [music] me.
[35:08] Sometimes [singing] we
[35:10] still believe.
[35:14] My life is [music and singing] built on
[35:16] this desire. Through the flood and
[35:19] through the fire,
[35:21] Jesus [music and singing]
[35:23] rescues me.
[35:27] When every mountain [music]
[35:30] seems too high [singing]
[35:33] and every river
[35:36] looks too [music] wide. [singing]
[35:40] When my dreams are lost [music] at sea,
[35:44] [singing]
[35:47] Jesus
[35:49] rescues me. [singing]
[35:52] My faith is strong and carries
[35:56] [music and singing] me.
[35:59] Though sometimes weak, I still believe.
[36:02] [singing and music]
[36:05] My life is built on his desire. Through
[36:09] the flood and through the fire,
[36:13] Jesus [music and singing]
[36:15] rescues me.
[36:18] My [music] life is [singing] built on
[36:20] this desire. Through the flood and
[36:23] through [music] the fire,
[36:25] Jesus [singing]
[36:28] rescues me.
[36:30] [music]
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Certainly appreciate our singers
[36:43] tonight, don't we?
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, we do.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Do we stand together? Let's sing a
[36:46] little chorus before our pastor comes
[36:49] tonight to bring us the word of the
[36:50] Lord. Who am I? Aren't you beginning to
[36:53] see who you are?
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Are you glad for identification?
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad I belong to him.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I belong to him. Are
[37:03] you glad you belong to him tonight? Give
[37:05] him one more good hand clap of praise.
[37:07] Amen. [applause and music]
[37:14] Oh, who am I?
[37:18] that [music]
[37:20] the king would [singing] bleed and die
[37:25] for.
[37:29] Who am I that he would pray
[37:35] [music and singing] not my will thine?
[37:41] [music]
[37:42] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[37:42] &gt;&gt; The answer
[37:44] I'm
[37:46] beginning to [singing] know. [music]
[37:49] Why did you ever
[37:53] love me so [music]
[37:56] that to an old rugged cross it go
[38:02] [singing]
[38:02] for who am I? One more time if you will.
[38:08] Oh, tell me who am I
[38:13] that [music]
[38:14] the king would [singing] bleed and die
[38:19] for?
[38:21] [singing]
[38:22] [music] Yes. Who am I that he would
[38:28] [music] pray not my will thine?
[38:36] The answer
[38:39] we're all beginning
[38:41] to know
[38:44] why
[38:47] [music and singing]
[38:53] rugged [music]
[38:54] cross he would go for who am I?
[39:03] Praise the Lord. [music]
[39:05] Aren't you grateful for God's mercy to
[39:07] you
[39:08] &gt;&gt; and God's grace?
[39:11] Well, I'm sure glad to see y'all. How
[39:12] y'all been?
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Good, good, good, good. Glad to see. I
[39:18] miss you. I know you don't miss me cuz I
[39:20] beat on you all the time, but I miss you
[39:23] all. Heard you had some good services,
[39:25] Brother Pete and Brother Tim. It always
[39:28] does the pastor's heart good to know
[39:30] that the people were blessed and helped,
[39:32] and I'm grateful for that.
[39:34] Amen.
[39:36] Let us uh turn if you would tonight to
[39:38] Genesis chapter 24
[39:41] verse 1,
[39:44] the bride's diary.
[39:47] And Abraham was old and wellstricken in
[39:50] age, and the Lord had blessed Abraham
[39:52] and all things. And Abraham said unto
[39:56] his eldest servant of his house
[39:59] that ruled
[40:01] over all that he had.
[40:04] So I guess if you
[40:08] wanted to be bride
[40:10] in that day,
[40:14] you had to listen to what this guy had
[40:16] to say.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm just I'm just thinking that
[40:20] myself, you know, from reading this in
[40:22] the Bible. So he was put over his all of
[40:26] his goods, ruled over all that he had.
[40:30] Put I pray thee, thy hand under my side,
[40:34] and I will make thee swear by the Lord,
[40:37] the God of heaven,
[40:39] and the God of the earth, that thou
[40:42] shalt not take a wife unto my son, of
[40:45] the daughters of the Canaanites, among
[40:47] whom I dwell, but thou shalt go unto my
[40:51] country,
[40:52] to my kindred, and take a wife unto my
[40:56] son,
[40:58] the three eyes, my country, my kindred,
[41:03] my son Isaac." And the servant said unto
[41:07] him, "Per adventure the woman will not
[41:10] be willing to follow me into this land.
[41:13] Must thy needs bring thy son again unto
[41:17] the land from which thou camest." Now be
[41:19] careful, preachers.
[41:22] Be careful, preachers.
[41:24] What you going to do with the message of
[41:27] go get a bride?
[41:29] Are you going to bring the bride to him
[41:33] or take him to her and leave him there?
[41:39] You see, that's what a lot of our
[41:40] brothers in the message want to do.
[41:45] They want to include Catholics in the
[41:47] rapture. Baptist, I heard one say that
[41:49] not long ago. When the rapture takes
[41:51] place, there'll be Catholics,
[41:54] Baptist, Assembly of God, Church of God.
[41:58] That man don't even believe the message.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; If you believe that, why you think we
[42:03] need a message?
[42:05] So if a woman who prays to Mary for
[42:08] forgiveness can go in the rapture and
[42:11] you have to tow the line and you can't
[42:13] do this and can't do that and a person
[42:16] can pray to Mary and go in the same
[42:18] rapture you go into
[42:21] &gt;&gt; something wrong somewhere ain't they?
[42:25] [clears throat]
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Must thine needs bring thy son again
[42:27] into the land from which thou camest?
[42:29] And Abraham said unto him,
[42:32] &gt;&gt; "Beware,
[42:34] &gt;&gt; beware,
[42:36] beware that thou bring not my son
[42:40] thither again.
[42:42] the Lord God of heaven, which took me
[42:44] from my father's house, and from the
[42:46] land of my kindred, and which spake unto
[42:49] me, and that swear unto me, saying unto
[42:51] thy seed, while I give this land, he
[42:55] shall send his angel
[42:58] before thee, and thou shalt take a wife
[43:02] unto my son from then." So this message
[43:06] from Abraham to this servant to the
[43:10] bride was forran by an angel and it was
[43:16] divine intervention. Thou shalt take a
[43:19] wife unto my son from
[43:23] how many believes our message one dead
[43:26] wasp.
[43:27] Our message is the same way.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; It's not from a Kuckian. It's not from a
[43:33] hillbilly.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; It's not from a denomination.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; It's from God
[43:39] &gt;&gt; and an angel forun it.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; How many like to be remembered in prayer
[43:43] tonight as we go before the Lord.
[43:46] Heavenly Father, we thank you tonight
[43:48] for your word. Lord Jesus, we're so
[43:49] grateful that we have been given the
[43:52] privilege again this cold, damp, wet,
[43:55] windy night out there. Well, Lord, we're
[43:57] just grateful that we have a warm place
[43:59] where we can come and be able to
[44:01] assemble and pray and sing and just
[44:05] worship you and hear your word. We're
[44:08] just believing you tonight, Father, that
[44:10] you're going to speak to us and give us
[44:12] what we have need of. May the presence
[44:15] of God come and help me to get out of
[44:17] the way, Father, that you can minister
[44:19] through me to your children. I pray that
[44:22] you'd capture every heart. May we bring
[44:25] every thought into obedience to the
[44:28] spirit of God. May you minister to your
[44:31] children. Father, you see these prayer
[44:32] cloths that I have in my hand. You know
[44:35] each of these needs, dear God, and we're
[44:37] believing you to move because we believe
[44:40] you are the same yesterday, today, and
[44:43] forever. Granted, Father, may we be able
[44:46] to leave here tonight and say, "Did not
[44:48] our hearts burn within us as he talked
[44:50] with us along the way?" In the name of
[44:53] the Lord Jesus and the saints of God
[44:55] said,
[44:56] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[44:59] Praise the Lord. We believe that our God
[45:02] is a God of supernatural. We know that
[45:06] angels ever since that God brought them
[45:09] into view, even before the creation of
[45:11] man, they have been great instruments of
[45:15] ministration by which God would con
[45:19] contribute not only to the heavens but
[45:22] to the earth. They have intervened in
[45:25] many things about the human race. They
[45:29] have influenced, they have affected.
[45:32] Actually, there's even angels that the
[45:35] prophet called healing angels. There's
[45:39] angels that bring messages, angels that
[45:43] bring deliverance, angels that move on
[45:47] politicians hearts,
[45:49] &gt;&gt; angels that will move on kings that are
[45:54] absolute heathens and will bend and mold
[45:59] those men into the direct will of God.
[46:02] And when the angel gets done, they're
[46:04] probably wondering why they even did
[46:08] what they did. Now, we know then that
[46:11] God knew that once Satan was able to
[46:14] pull away, how many other angels that it
[46:17] was by his lies that he must also use
[46:21] his angels which are left in paradise to
[46:25] be able to influence man upon the earth.
[46:28] So he could not leave man here totally
[46:30] to just the knowledge of the word. Now
[46:33] the word is wonderful and God knew that
[46:36] he would allow a certain portion of the
[46:39] word to be written down. But he also
[46:41] knew that there would be that which was
[46:44] noted in the scripture according to
[46:47] Daniel chapter 10 noted in the scripture
[46:51] which would not actually be written
[46:54] down. So you see part of the scripture
[46:57] will never be actually written in the
[47:00] pages of the Bible because every word
[47:04] that comes from God is scripture. And
[47:07] there are some word that he never
[47:09] allowed to be written, Matthew, Mark,
[47:11] Luke, John, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
[47:14] Numbers, Deuteronomy, Judges, Joshua, on
[47:16] and on and on and on. But he would send
[47:18] it seasonally through a prophet.
[47:22] [laughter]
[47:23] Unlike some people who say they believe
[47:26] this message, I believe that a prophet
[47:28] of God can catch that which is unwritten
[47:33] and bring forth the mandate of the hour.
[47:36] And if you believe the Bible, you
[47:38] believe the same thing. Cuz you see,
[47:41] Paul was used by God to write things
[47:44] that nobody else said in the New
[47:48] Testament. Do you all believe that? Now,
[47:50] wait a minute. I thought you had to have
[47:51] two or three witnesses.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Come on now, Bible theologians. I
[47:58] thought we had to have two or three
[47:59] witnesses to prove every word.
[48:02] You see, if we don't place God's word in
[48:04] the right place, what we do? We make
[48:07] God's word a lie.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Now, the angel of God is going to go
[48:12] before this messenger. He does not have
[48:15] the ability to be able the messenger to
[48:19] project this supernatural aura which
[48:22] will be necessary to get this woman's
[48:25] attention. He does not have the
[48:27] charisma. He does not have the
[48:30] magnetism, the ability to come and just
[48:34] sweep her off of her feet. He didn't
[48:37] actually need that. He could have been a
[48:39] pretty dumb fellow because the angel of
[48:42] God was going to go before him. We don't
[48:45] know if he's fat, if he's skinny, if he
[48:48] is ugly, if he couldn't hardly say good
[48:50] grammar. In reality, that didn't matter.
[48:53] All he needed to do was to bring the
[48:56] message of what the the prophet Abraham
[48:59] had told him to say. And the angel of
[49:02] God was going to prepare her heart and
[49:05] it would connect the message and the
[49:08] bride and the angelic anointing all in
[49:12] the same thing and it would be a divine
[49:14] response and it would change her life
[49:18] and the life of the rest of those people
[49:21] forever. Now, if we believe our God is
[49:24] doing something, I hope you understand
[49:26] this, even in a greater way now than
[49:30] what he did for Rebecca. Now, listen to
[49:32] me. It was an awesome thing what God did
[49:35] for Rebecca. But actually, it was just
[49:38] one woman. That was all that was
[49:40] affected by it at the time. So, how much
[49:43] greater would it be then if God would
[49:46] send a messenger with a message and
[49:50] there would be thousands times
[49:52] thousands, maybe even hundreds of
[49:55] thousands that would hear that message
[49:58] and would respond to that message and
[50:00] would be called out into a sanctified
[50:04] state to be the bride not only for Isaac
[50:07] but for the Lord Jesus. Wouldn't that be
[50:10] greater in the eyes of God than now?
[50:13] Well, all we know is that this great
[50:16] messenger of God, a very simple man, a
[50:18] man that was a gentile, actually, wasn't
[50:20] even a Hebrew, a man that was a slave,
[50:24] this is what he was before Abraham
[50:26] actually redeemed him. So, the the the
[50:29] messenger himself experienced this great
[50:32] thing of redemption through what God had
[50:35] done through Abraham. So the messenger
[50:38] was redeemed. Then he packed the message
[50:41] of redemption down to Rebecca and
[50:44] brought Rebecca out of that land, out of
[50:47] all the sin, nature, and things that was
[50:49] around her and brought her into a land
[50:52] of promise. And remember, it's not
[50:55] because she deserved it. It's not
[50:57] because she was worthy. It's because God
[51:00] ordained her to have it. I want to tell
[51:03] you right here tonight, there ain't a
[51:04] person in this building that's worthy of
[51:07] eternal life, including the preacher
[51:08] preaching to you. There ain't none of us
[51:11] that's good enough. We'll never be good
[51:13] enough. We can never do enough to pay
[51:15] him back. We could never sing enough,
[51:17] pray enough, read the Bible enough, but
[51:20] you know what? If you've got eternal
[51:22] life tonight, God ordains you to have
[51:24] it. There ain't enough devils in hell to
[51:26] take it away from you. your
[51:28] shortcomings, your failures, your
[51:30] family. I don't care how bad your family
[51:33] was. Come on, somebody. It don't have
[51:35] nothing to do with that. IF GOD PUT YOUR
[51:37] name on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[51:40] the foundation of the world, there ain't
[51:42] enough devils in hell to take it all.
[51:44] There ain't enough people in America or
[51:47] in the world. It don't make no
[51:49] difference how many people don't like
[51:51] you. How many people hate you? That
[51:53] ain't got nothing to do with it. It's on
[51:55] the Lamb's Book of Life, which is his
[51:58] personal diary. As far as God's
[52:01] concerned, it's over.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. I said it's over.
[52:07] [applause]
[52:08] &gt;&gt; BUT NOW LOOK, GOD [screaming] KNEW THAT
[52:10] IT would take angelic intervention
[52:14] in so many of his dealings with humanity
[52:18] and God started allowing it to be
[52:21] unfolded here in the book of Genesis.
[52:24] Now we see it as it comes up into even
[52:27] through the last book of the Old
[52:29] Testament Malachi. But something
[52:31] happened in the New Testament in the New
[52:36] Testament is that and angelic
[52:38] appearances. It was like the seals broke
[52:42] loose off of the supernatural realm. And
[52:46] at the coming of the Lord Jesus, that
[52:49] angel started breaking forth in dreams
[52:53] and in visions and even in physical
[52:57] material appearances. THEY WOULD COME
[53:00] WITH MESSAGES. THEY WOULD COME AS
[53:02] ENCOURAGEMENT. They would come with
[53:05] rebukes sometime. So, you know, the
[53:08] people should have known and we realize
[53:10] that all the books were not written at
[53:12] the time and it was not common knowledge
[53:14] because it had not been accumulated yet
[53:16] like you and I could read it tonight.
[53:19] BUT YET, GOD WAS ALLOWING something
[53:21] great and phenomenal to happen. The
[53:24] angelic appearance and manifestation was
[53:28] bringing forth something that the Old
[53:30] Testament could not declare. It was the
[53:33] beginning of a new creation. Now the
[53:36] Lord Jesus of course his birth was
[53:38] announced by many things in his own
[53:40] visitation as well. But read with me if
[53:42] you would in the book of Mark 1:12. And
[53:45] immediately the spirit driveth him into
[53:48] the wilderness. And he was there in the
[53:50] wilderness 40 days tempted of Satan and
[53:53] was with wild beast. Isn't this unusual?
[53:57] So the Lord Jesus was tempted by the
[54:00] devil and wild beasts were around him.
[54:03] I've always thought this is strange that
[54:05] Mark would put this in there. And was
[54:07] with wild beasts and the angels
[54:11] ministered to him. Now notice how low
[54:14] that our Lord Jesus had come into the
[54:17] act of condensation that the great
[54:20] Michael himself. Now remember Christ was
[54:25] Michael of the Old Testament. Now he is
[54:28] the chief prince. As a matter of fact,
[54:30] he is the only archangel that is
[54:34] mentioned by name in the Bible. And yet
[54:37] when he condenses sin from that heavenly
[54:40] angelic position as being the logos, HE
[54:44] COMES TO SUCH A DEGREE that Paul said
[54:46] that he was made lower than the angels.
[54:50] So he allows himself to be able to take
[54:53] on humanity.
[54:55] And when he does, he needs the lower
[54:59] angels to actually minister to him.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; NOW, THERE WAS SOMETHING GONE OUT OF
[55:06] HIM. SO, OKAY, he had not eaten. We
[55:08] don't know for sure if he had drank or
[55:10] not, but he had not eaten. He was weak.
[55:12] He went through temptation. Boy, the
[55:14] devil pounded him. Any of us that's been
[55:16] under heavy trials know what that does.
[55:18] It just leaves you so weak at times. AND
[55:21] THE LORD JESUS FOUND HIMSELF BEING WEAK
[55:24] in human strengths and maybe even
[55:27] skipping his own walk that he was just
[55:30] so depleted of divine energy because of
[55:33] where it condescended to. AND THE ANGELS
[55:36] OF GOD NOW THEY come down and they start
[55:40] ministering. So what did they do? We
[55:42] don't know. Were they giving him food
[55:44] like they did Elijah? Were they coming
[55:47] and touching him like they did Daniel?
[55:50] or were they touching him on the
[55:53] forehead the way they did Elijah? We
[55:55] really don't know. All we KNOW IS THAT
[55:58] MARK used this word as the other authors
[56:01] did as well, ministered to him. And the
[56:04] word is very broad. It's a very, you
[56:05] know, it's a very elaborate word, donos.
[56:08] It's the same word that we get deacon
[56:10] from. So it's a word that you can
[56:12] minister natural sustenance to an
[56:14] individual or you can minister divine
[56:17] strength which can only come from a
[56:19] supernatural being. So he allows himself
[56:22] to be ministered to. Now remember this
[56:25] is the beginning of a new dispensation.
[56:28] So he is opening up something not only
[56:31] for himself but for his seed who are
[56:35] going to follow in the same way. I don't
[56:38] mind telling you, friend, I believe that
[56:39] we need the advent of the angels of God
[56:42] in our lives like never before.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY I BELIEVE THAT.
[56:48] BECAUSE DEMON powers have been released
[56:51] in a way like never before. And it's
[56:55] evident that the world is coming under
[56:58] more demonic control and demonic
[57:01] influence than they have ever been. THEN
[57:03] GOD KNOWS THAT THERE MUST BE on the
[57:06] other side to counterbalance that or we
[57:09] would never be able to stand it. If
[57:11] demonic power would constantly increase,
[57:14] INCREASE
[57:16] AND GOD WOULD keep the same level of
[57:18] angelic power at a very low Lutheran
[57:22] church age level, Wesley and church age
[57:24] level. BUT GOD KNEW IT MUST be an
[57:27] increase that they would come and
[57:30] minister to us strength like we never
[57:33] have had need of it before in our lives.
[57:35] You believe that is true?
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Now watch in Mark 13 26. And they shall
[57:41] see the son of man coming in the clouds
[57:44] with great power and glory. THEN HE
[57:46] SHALL SEND his angels. Now watch what
[57:48] the angels are going TO DO. HE SHALL
[57:51] SEND HIS ANGELS AND SHALL GATHER
[57:53] TOGETHER his elect. Now, not non-elect,
[57:57] not foolish virgin, but he shall gather.
[57:59] You won't argue with this, up to you.
[58:01] But the this is the Bible. THAT HE SHALL
[58:03] GATHER HIS elect from the four winds.
[58:07] Now, notice where they're coming from.
[58:08] The four winds, north, south, east, and
[58:11] west. Also, from the outermost part of
[58:14] the earth to the outermost part of the
[58:18] heaven. So that shows us some of them
[58:21] would have already gone on passed away
[58:23] as we said and they are in the uttermost
[58:26] part of heaven waiting on what? Angels
[58:30] to come and get them. So those of us
[58:33] that are here and alive when the RAPTURE
[58:35] TAKES PLACE, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO NEED?
[58:39] Angels to carry us to the other side.
[58:42] Remember our loved ones do not make this
[58:44] journey when they go down the passage of
[58:47] death alone. But the angels of God are
[58:50] there to pack their soul into the
[58:53] presence of God. WE ALSO will need the
[58:57] angels of God when we get our body
[59:00] changed. Oh, praise the Lord. The angels
[59:03] of God. Now, listen. Whenever you
[59:04] recognize the very word of God is eagle
[59:07] food, you left the other thing and you
[59:10] heard from your theophony, which is your
[59:14] angel. IT WAS YOUR ANGEL that ushered
[59:17] you in to a word burst of the evening
[59:20] time. It will be your angel that will
[59:24] consummate the birth of your new body
[59:27] because you're going to have a body that
[59:29] is going to match your soul.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Notice in Luke 22:42
[59:37] saying, "Father, if thou be willing,"
[59:39] now here is in the garden OF GETHSEMANE.
[59:41] IF THOU BE WILLING, let this cup pass
[59:43] from me. Uh, nevertheless, not my will,
[59:46] but thine be done. And there appeared an
[59:49] angel unto him from heaven,
[59:53] STRENGTHENING. NOTICE a different word,
[59:55] not ministering. STRENGTHENING, GIVING
[59:58] HIM STRENGTH. WHAT KIND OF STRENGTH?
[1:00:00] WHAT STRENGTH WAS IT? HE NEEDED strength
[1:00:03] to be able to accept and do the will of
[1:00:06] God. NOW, WHAT'S HE DONE? FATHER,
[1:00:08] PLEASE, IS THERE ANY WAY that somebody
[1:00:10] else can do this? He knew there wasn't
[1:00:12] no one that could do it. DON'T YOU
[1:00:13] UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S DOING? HE'S
[1:00:15] ALLOWING himself to feel like he knew
[1:00:18] his children would decades and and and
[1:00:21] church AGES ON BEYOND HIM. WHENEVER THEY
[1:00:24] SAY, "LORD, PLEASE don't make ME GO
[1:00:25] THROUGH THIS. LORD, PLEASE don't let
[1:00:27] this happen TO ME. PLEASE, LORD, DON'T
[1:00:29] DON'T DON'T. BUT IF THIS IS YOUR WILL,
[1:00:31] THEN LORD, help me and give me
[1:00:32] strength." SO, WHAT WAS HE DOING? HE'S
[1:00:35] THE FIRST ONE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. HE'S
[1:00:38] THE SANCTIFIER AND HE'S making a pattern
[1:00:41] for the sanctified that are going to
[1:00:43] come behind him. And he is condescended
[1:00:46] TO SUCH A LEVEL THAT he needed strength.
[1:00:49] AND HE ALLOWED a being which was weaker
[1:00:52] than himself before his incarnation to
[1:00:56] be able to mentor. Lord children, I wish
[1:00:58] you could understand what I'M SAYING
[1:00:59] TONIGHT. YOU IMAGINE WHAT A CONDENSATION
[1:01:02] THIS WAS. HE MADE THEM ANGELS. HE WAS
[1:01:05] THE ONE WHO CREATED THEM. AND NOW THEY
[1:01:08] are ministering back to him.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. Notice now after his
[1:01:15] resurrection in Matthew chap 28 2. AND
[1:01:18] BEHOLD, THERE WAS A GREAT EARTHQUAKE FOR
[1:01:21] THE ANGEL of the Lord descended from
[1:01:23] heaven. Now notice the resurrection of
[1:01:26] the Lord Jesus. THERE WAS AN earthquake
[1:01:29] and an angel of the Lord descended from
[1:01:32] heaven and came and rolled BACK THE
[1:01:35] STONE. JESUS DIDN'T roll back his own
[1:01:37] rock.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Couldn't do it from THE INSIDE.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; SO GOD SENT DOWN an angel and the ANGEL
[1:01:45] WAS ON THE OUTSIDE and broke the seal.
[1:01:49] THE ROMAN SEAL WASN'T ON THE INSIDE. The
[1:01:53] Roman SEAL WAS ON THE OUTSIDE. SO THE
[1:01:57] ANGEL PULLED BACK THE seal and when he
[1:02:00] did, he rolled the Oh, glory to God.
[1:02:03] When he did, HE ROLLED BACK THE STONE
[1:02:05] AND THAT RELEASED the word to walk out
[1:02:08] the living word. What did it? An angel
[1:02:12] of God. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. OH, YOU
[1:02:15] KNOW, HE COULD HAVE SPOKE IF THAT'S WHAT
[1:02:17] HE HAD WANTED TO DO. BUT AN ANGEL WAS
[1:02:20] WHAT OPENED and broke that Roman seal.
[1:02:23] My my. And the angel answered and said
[1:02:26] unto the women, "FEAR YE NOT, FOR I KNOW
[1:02:29] THAT YOU SEEK Jesus which was
[1:02:32] crucified." Notice now one angel comes
[1:02:35] down. And here we have where that an
[1:02:38] angel answered and the women are there
[1:02:40] seeking for Jesus. And he said, "I know
[1:02:42] that you seek Jesus which was
[1:02:44] crucified." AND THE ANGEL IS NOW GIVING
[1:02:47] THEM A MESSAGE. He's not here. He is
[1:02:51] risen. ST. JOHN 20:1 BUT MARY stood
[1:02:55] without at the sepre weeping and as SHE
[1:02:59] WEPT SHE STOOPED down and looked into
[1:03:02] the separ
[1:03:07] [sighs]
[1:03:08] and seeth
[1:03:10] two angels.
[1:03:12] All right. Now, let's let's do to the
[1:03:15] Bible
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; what those who hate the message and have
[1:03:19] left the message do to the message.
[1:03:23] Matthew said there was one.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; John said there was two.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; So, reckon which one of them was a liar?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Testing. One, two, three. Testing.
[1:03:44] You believe the Bible's perfect, right?
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Without mistake, without fault.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; So she seeth two angels in white, the
[1:03:58] one sitting at the head and the other at
[1:04:01] the feet.
[1:04:03] Matthew didn't say that.
[1:04:10] where the body of Jesus had lain. I'm
[1:04:14] glad there's four gospels
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; because each of these men wrote in their
[1:04:20] own way and the way they did it. One of
[1:04:22] them says the robe is scarred and
[1:04:23] another said it was purple. Study your
[1:04:25] BIBLE SOMETIMES. AS A MATTER OF FACT,
[1:04:27] I'VE SENT some of these to these
[1:04:28] heathens that have left the message and
[1:04:30] told them IF YOU DON'T DO THE BIBLE THE
[1:04:32] same way you do the message, you're a
[1:04:34] hypocrite.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Come on. Of course, I've got some emails
[1:04:39] back from them. They done everything but
[1:04:40] cuss me,
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; call me every name that you can imagine,
[1:04:45] and then they want me to leave this and
[1:04:47] follow them. No thanks. I want to be
[1:04:49] more like Jesus, not more like the
[1:04:50] devil.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:57] And they, not he, THEY SAY UNTO HER,
[1:05:02] WOMAN, WHY WEEPEST THOU?
[1:05:05] SHE SAITH unto them.
[1:05:08] BUT HOW COME MATTHEW DIDN'T SAY THERE
[1:05:10] WAS A THEM? HOW COME HE SAID THERE'S A
[1:05:13] HIM?
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, friends. You didn't know this
[1:05:18] is in your Bible.
[1:05:20] IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO UNDERSTAND
[1:05:22] GOD EVEN BY READING YOUR BIBLE, YOU'RE
[1:05:24] AS CRAZY AS A LUNATIC.
[1:05:27] YOU CAN KNOW YOUR BIBLE FRONTWARDS AND
[1:05:29] BACKWARDS. AND WHEN YOU GET DONE REALLY
[1:05:31] KNOWING IT, YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE A WHOLE
[1:05:33] LOT OF FAITH TO still believe there's a
[1:05:34] God.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; AND YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE FAITH IN HIS
[1:05:37] BOOK AND KNOW THAT YOUR GOD COULD NOT
[1:05:40] GIVE YOU A BOOK THAT WAS CORRUPTED AND
[1:05:42] ROTTEN. YOU DON'T KNOW GOD BY QUOTING
[1:05:44] HIS BIBLE. YOU DON'T KNOW GOD BY THE
[1:05:47] GREEK AND THE ARAMAIC AND THE HEBREW.
[1:05:49] YOU KNOW HIM BY DIVINE REVELATION.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause]
[1:05:58] WOO. AND THEY SAY UNTO HER, WOMAN, WHY
[1:06:01] WEEPEST THOU? SHE SAITH unto them,
[1:06:05] because they have taken away my Lord,
[1:06:07] and I know not where they have laid him.
[1:06:10] And when she HAD THUS SAID, SHE turned
[1:06:12] herself back and saw Jesus standing,
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; and knew not that it was Jesus.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at the book of Acts.
[1:06:22] Acts chapter 5:1 18. AND THEY LAID THEIR
[1:06:25] HANDS ON THE APOSTLES AND PUT THEM IN
[1:06:27] THE COMMON PRISON. But the angel of the
[1:06:30] Lord by night opened the prison doors.
[1:06:33] Praise God. How many believe he can
[1:06:35] still open them?
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; AND BROUGHT THEM FORTH and said, "Go
[1:06:39] stand in the temple to the people." No,
[1:06:43] to speak. You got to be KIDDING ME. SO
[1:06:46] AFTER THEY get arrested and they PUT
[1:06:49] THEM IN THE PRISON, THE ANGEL OF GOD
[1:06:51] SETS THEM FREE. SAID, "NOW GO BACK DOWN
[1:06:53] THERE AND PREACH TO THEM AGAIN.
[1:06:57] Go stand and speak in the temple to the
[1:07:01] people all the words of this life." And
[1:07:05] when they had heard that, they entered
[1:07:06] into the temple early in the morning and
[1:07:08] taught.
[1:07:10] Well, I reckon if an angel of God told
[1:07:12] you to do it, you'd do it, right?
[1:07:14] Chapter 8, 26. AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD
[1:07:16] SPAKE UNTO PHILILLIP, SAYING, "ARISE,
[1:07:19] and go toward the south, unto the way
[1:07:22] that goeth down from Jerusalem unto
[1:07:24] Gaza, which is desert." And he arose,
[1:07:27] and went, and behold, a man of Ethiopia,
[1:07:30] an Enoch of great authority under
[1:07:32] Candace, queen of the Ethiopians,
[1:07:36] who had the charge of all her treasure,
[1:07:38] had come to Jerusalem for to worship.
[1:07:41] Well, he went to Jerusalem to worship
[1:07:44] and left empty-handed.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; HE'D BEEN UP AT ALL THE DDS, ALL THE
[1:07:48] COLLEGE GUYS, AND ALL THIS, THAT, AND
[1:07:50] THE OTHER. BUT GOD HAD A MAN that he
[1:07:52] sent down there. And how did he do? By
[1:07:55] an angel of the Lord.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD LED HIM
[1:08:01] down there. Now remember, THE ANGEL
[1:08:02] HIMSELF COULD NOT PREACH THE GOSPEL. THE
[1:08:05] ANGEL HIMSELF COULD NOT BAPTIZE HIM. BUT
[1:08:08] THE ANGEL TOLD PHILILLIP, "You get down
[1:08:10] there to Gaza." Amen. Notice Acts
[1:08:14] chapter 10 verse one. And there was a
[1:08:16] certain man in Cesaria called Cornelius,
[1:08:18] a centurion of the Italian band. THIS IS
[1:08:22] OUR BROTHERS. THIS IS WHAT THE ALPHA
[1:08:25] BRIDE STARTED IN THE FOUR GOSPELS AND IN
[1:08:28] THE BOOK OF ACTS. ONE MANIFESTATION
[1:08:31] AFTER another of the ANGELS OF GOD. MORE
[1:08:34] HERE THAN WHAT YOU FIND IN the entire
[1:08:36] cannon of the Old Testament.
[1:08:39] A devout man and one that feared God
[1:08:41] with all his house, WHICH GAVE MUCH ARMS
[1:08:44] to the people and prayed to God always.
[1:08:47] He saw in a vision evidently about the
[1:08:49] ninth hour of the day an angel of God.
[1:08:53] Notice it's just coming at random times.
[1:08:56] And it's not all to prophets. It's not
[1:08:59] all TO MESSENGERS, TO GENTILES AS WELL
[1:09:02] AS JEWS. GOD SAYING SOMETHING. WHAT'S HE
[1:09:06] SAYING? WHAT'S HE USING TO SAY IT?
[1:09:08] Angelic manifestation.
[1:09:11] ANGELIC MANIFESTATION IS CROSSING THE
[1:09:14] BOUNDARIES WHICH BEFORE THE JEWS SAY,
[1:09:17] "HEY, we're the holy people of God.
[1:09:19] We're the only one that gets angels
[1:09:20] around here. We're the only one that
[1:09:22] gets this and that." But God said, "I'M
[1:09:23] DOING SOMETHING NEW. I'M CHANGING. I I'M
[1:09:26] BRINGING IN SOMETHING. I'M CALLING A
[1:09:28] BRIDE OUT FOR MY NAME. I'M GOING TO LET
[1:09:31] THE ANGELS VISIT THE GENTILES.
[1:09:35] Can you imagine how astounding this was
[1:09:38] to the Jews?
[1:09:41] A centurion
[1:09:43] in the band called the Italian band. A a
[1:09:47] man and an officer
[1:09:50] of the Roman army.
[1:09:56] And he saw in a vision evidently about
[1:09:58] the ninth hour of the day an angel of
[1:10:00] God coming into him and saying unto him,
[1:10:04] Cornelius.
[1:10:06] And when he looked on him, he was afraid
[1:10:08] and said, "What is it, Lord?" And he
[1:10:10] said unto HIM, "THY PRAYERS AND THINE
[1:10:12] ARMS ARE come up for a memorial before
[1:10:15] God. NOW SEND A JAPA AND CALL FOR ONE
[1:10:19] SIMON whose surname IS PETER. HE LODGETH
[1:10:23] WITH ONE SIMON a tanner, whose house is
[1:10:26] by the seaside. He shalt tell THEE WHAT
[1:10:28] THOU OUGHTEST TO DO. ISN'T THIS STRANGE?
[1:10:31] THE ANGEL OF GOD COULD TELL HIM THE MAN.
[1:10:34] He could tell him where he was. HE COULD
[1:10:36] TELL HIM THE NAME OF the man that he was
[1:10:38] staying with, but he couldn't tell him
[1:10:40] what to do to get right with God. THAT'S
[1:10:42] RIGHT.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; WHY? [screaming]
[1:10:45] PETER WAS PART OF THE BODY.
[1:10:47] THE ANGEL AS HIGH AND HOLY AS HE WAS, HE
[1:10:50] DID NOT HAVE THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; AND HE did not HAVE THE SEED LIFE.
[1:10:55] [screaming] GOD HAD NOW TRANSMITTED HIS
[1:10:58] OWN SPERM INTO HIS MYSTICAL BODY ON THE
[1:11:02] EARTH. AND IN ORDER FOR [screaming] GOD
[1:11:04] TO BRING FORTH ANOTHER SON, IT HAD TO
[1:11:06] COME THROUGH HIS WIFE, HIS BODY ON the
[1:11:09] earth.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Praise [laughter] be to God. Oh, glory
[1:11:18] to God. Thank you, Lord. And when THE
[1:11:21] ANGEL WHICH SPAKE unto Cornelius was
[1:11:23] departed, he called two of his household
[1:11:26] servants and a devout soldier of them
[1:11:28] that waited on him continually, and they
[1:11:31] went and declared all these things unto
[1:11:33] them, and he sent them to Japa. Verse
[1:11:36] 22. AND THEY SAID, CORNELIUS, THE
[1:11:39] CENTURION, a just man, and one that
[1:11:42] fearth God, and of good report among all
[1:11:44] the nation of the Jews, was warned from
[1:11:47] God by a holy angel
[1:11:50] to send for thee. Now, they get up there
[1:11:52] to Peter and they've got to relate the
[1:11:54] same thing. And you imagine, Peter, you
[1:11:56] mean to tell me God sent you all an
[1:11:58] angel? Why in the world didn't he tell
[1:12:00] you what you need to do? WHAT THE ANGEL
[1:12:03] WOULD HAVE SAID BEEN FAR MORE PERFECT
[1:12:04] than Peter? any sermon Peter ever
[1:12:06] preached.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A VOCATION
[1:12:12] THAT GOD DEFINES YOU AS being foolish
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; and what you're doing is foolishness.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Welcome preachers to one of the most
[1:12:21] foolish jobs there is in the world,
[1:12:24] preaching.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; I AIN'T NEVER PREACHED A PERFECT SERMON
[1:12:29] IN MY LIFE AND NEVER WILL.
[1:12:33] YOU IMAGINE I PREACHED 51 YEARS AND
[1:12:37] NEVER ONE PERFECT SERMON.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; And the older I get, the worse they'll
[1:12:43] probably get.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; But that's all right. Some of y'all's
[1:12:47] getting so old you won't know it anyway.
[1:12:50] You'll say, "What he say,
[1:12:53] honey? What he say?" I don't know. I
[1:12:54] COULDN'T HEAR HIM. What he say? Turn the
[1:12:56] volume. I don't know what he say.
[1:13:00] At least we're all getting old together.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; You imagine NOW ON THE MARA PETER went
[1:13:07] away with them and certain brethren from
[1:13:08] Japa accompanied him. CHAPTER 12 VERSE
[1:13:12] 6. AND WHAT HEROD WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HIM
[1:13:14] FORTH the same night Peter was sleeping
[1:13:16] BETWEEN TWO SOLDIERS BOUND WITH TWO
[1:13:19] chains and the keepers before the door
[1:13:22] kept the prison. I mean, they got him
[1:13:24] locked up good, AIN'T THEY? AND BEHOLD,
[1:13:26] THE ANGEL OF THE LORD came upon him, and
[1:13:29] a light shined in the prison, AND HE
[1:13:32] SMOKED PETER ON THE SIDE. GET UP,
[1:13:34] PREACHER.
[1:13:36] SMOTE HIM ON THE SIDE. WHY IN the world
[1:13:37] could he have been a little bit more
[1:13:39] gentle? Just kind of rubbed him on the
[1:13:40] head. Must have been a sound sleeper.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; SO HE SMOTEED HIM ON THE SIDE. WOW, IT
[1:13:45] MUST BE NICE. SMOTE HIM ON THE SIDE AND
[1:13:48] RAISE HIM UP, SAYING, "RISE UP QUICKLY."
[1:13:51] AND HIS CHAINS FELL OFF. GLORY TO GOD.
[1:13:54] HIS CHAINS FELL OFF FROM HIS HAND. LOOK
[1:13:57] AT WHAT POWER [screaming] THE ANGELS OF
[1:13:59] GOD CAN DO. AND MINISTER SAY, "BROTHER
[1:14:01] D, I WISH YOU'D SEND MY THERE AIN'T NO
[1:14:04] TELLING how many times IN YOUR LIFE THAT
[1:14:07] ALMIGHTY GOD HAS SENT ANGELS YOUR WAY,
[1:14:10] BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM IN A PHYSICAL
[1:14:12] FORM OR YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM IN A LIGHT,
[1:14:14] BUT THEY WERE THERE NONETHELESS BECAUSE
[1:14:17] YOU ARE THE ELECT OF GOD JUST LIKE PETER
[1:14:20] WAS, JUST LIKE CORNELIUS WAS." AMEN.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:26] AND THE ANGEL SAID UNTO HIM, "GUARD
[1:14:28] THYSELF, AND BIND ON THY SANDALS." And
[1:14:31] so he did. And he SAITH UNTO HIM, "CAST
[1:14:33] THY GARMENT ABOUT THEE, AND FOLLOW ME."
[1:14:37] AND HE WENT OUT AND FOLLOWED HIM, AND
[1:14:39] WENT NOT that it was true, which was
[1:14:42] done by the angel,
[1:14:44] but thought
[1:14:46] he saw a vision. AND WHEN THEY WERE
[1:14:49] PASSED THE FIRST AND THE SECOND WARD,
[1:14:52] THEY CAME INTO THE IRON GATE THAT lead
[1:14:55] us into the city, which opened to them
[1:14:57] of his own accord. I'll tell you one
[1:15:00] thing, if I ever get in trouble, I want
[1:15:02] to have a companion like this in there
[1:15:03] with me, don't you?
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. I'M TALKING ABOUT the same God
[1:15:07] that can open gates of their own accord.
[1:15:10] YOURS MAY NOT BE AN iron gate. It might
[1:15:11] be a TB gate or a cancer gate or or a
[1:15:14] sickness or an oppression. I believe the
[1:15:16] angels of God ARE RIGHT HERE TONIGHT TO
[1:15:18] PASS BY RIGHT AMONG US. OH, I KNOW IT'S
[1:15:20] COLD AND WET AND WE GOT FOLKS THAT ARE
[1:15:22] SICK AND THAT THE OTHER, BUT YOU KNOW
[1:15:23] WHAT? WE ALL GOT READY AND COME TO
[1:15:25] CHURCH. I'VE BEEN SETTING FOR HOURS AND
[1:15:27] HOURS ON THIS SERMON. I say we go ahead
[1:15:29] and have church. I JUST SAY WE CREATE AN
[1:15:32] ATMOSPHERE IN HERE WHERE THE LORD JESUS
[1:15:35] CAN SEND OUT ANGELS AND LET THEM WALK UP
[1:15:37] AND DOWN THESE AISLES AND MINISTER TO US
[1:15:39] AND OPEN THE GATES FOR US.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:45] Oh, [laughter]
[1:15:46] thank you, LORD JESUS. THEY WENT OUT AND
[1:15:49] PASSED ON THROUGH ONE STREET AND FOR THE
[1:15:52] ANGEL DEPARTED from him. Well, I reckon
[1:15:54] he knew where he's at. So, he said,
[1:15:55] "I'll see you. I'll see him. I'll catch
[1:15:56] back up sometime later." THOUGH THE
[1:15:58] ANGEL OF GOD GOT HIM OUT. HE JUST LEFT
[1:16:00] HIM. AND WHEN PETER WAS COME TO HIMSELF,
[1:16:03] PRAISE GOD. WHEN PETER WAS COME TO
[1:16:06] HIMSELF, HE SAID, "NOW I KNOW OF
[1:16:09] ASSURITYITY THAT THE LORD HATH SENT HIS
[1:16:12] ANGEL and hath delivered me out of the
[1:16:15] hand OF HEROD." AND FROM ALL THE
[1:16:17] expectation of the people of the Jews,
[1:16:20] oh, I hope AND PRAY TO GOD THAT SOMEBODY
[1:16:22] WILL BE ABLE TO LEAVE THIS PLACE TONIGHT
[1:16:24] AND SAY, "I KNOW OF ASSURITYITY THAT THE
[1:16:27] LORD SENT HIS ANGEL in the service THIS
[1:16:29] NIGHT, AND I AM HEALED OF THIS. I AM
[1:16:32] DELIVERED OF THAT. I AM SET FREE FROM
[1:16:34] THAT. IS HE the same God?
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE SIN, HE
[1:16:41] CAME TO THE HOUSE OF MARY, THE MOTHER OF
[1:16:44] JOHN, WHOSE SURNAME WAS MARK, where many
[1:16:47] were gathered together praying. AND AS
[1:16:50] PETER KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE GATE, A
[1:16:52] DAMSEL CAME TO HEARKEN named Roa. And
[1:16:56] when she knew Peter's voice, SHE OPENED
[1:16:59] NOT THE GATE FOR GLADNESS,
[1:17:02] but ran in AND TOLD HOW PETER SAID
[1:17:05] BEFORE THE GATE.
[1:17:08] Just like Christians,
[1:17:10] God answered their prayers, but they
[1:17:12] DON'T BELIEVE IT.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; OH [screaming] GOD, OH GOD, HAVE MERCY
[1:17:19] ON PETER. GOD COULDN'T ANSWER THAT
[1:17:20] PRAYER. HE done answered it.
[1:17:24] I wonder how many of us have prayed and
[1:17:25] prayed and prayed and the answer is done
[1:17:27] THERE AND WE'RE S OH [screaming]
[1:17:29] GOD WE GET IN THAT VOICE AND HEY
[1:17:33] GOD I PRAY IN THE NAME OF JESUS OH LORD
[1:17:38] God
[1:17:39] saying why don't you put that thing off
[1:17:41] the answer is at the gate
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; and as Peter knocked at the door of the
[1:17:51] gate
[1:17:52] The damsel came to hearken named Roa.
[1:17:54] And when SHE KNEW PETER'S VOICE, SHE
[1:17:56] OPENED NOT THE GATE FOR GLADNESS.
[1:17:59] She just so happy and set free. She just
[1:18:01] left him standing on the outside, BUT
[1:18:03] RAN IN AND TOLD HOW PETER STOOD BEFORE
[1:18:05] THE GATE. AND THEY SAID UNTO HER, "THOU
[1:18:08] ART [screaming] MAD."
[1:18:10] DON'T YOU TELL ME GOD HAS ANSWERED MY
[1:18:12] PRAYERS THAT QUICK. THAT'S NOT THAT'S
[1:18:14] NOT THE WAY IT WORKS WITH ME. IT'S 40
[1:18:16] DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS OF LABOR AND
[1:18:18] INTENSIVE SWEATING AND PERSPIRATION. GOD
[1:18:21] ALWAYS MAKES ME SYNDROME. I'M TELLING
[1:18:23] YOU, GOD'S ALREADY ANSWERED IT. THEIR
[1:18:25] ANSWER IS STANDING AT THE DOOR.
[1:18:26] [laughter]
[1:18:27] THE ANSWER IS STANDING AT THE DOOR. THEY
[1:18:29] SAID, "YOU'RE CRAZY."
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; They said unto her, "Thou art mad."
[1:18:39] But she constantly affirmed
[1:18:42] it was even so.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Believe it or not, that's what I'm going
[1:18:45] to do tonight. I'm going to constantly
[1:18:47] affirm he's your healer. He's your
[1:18:49] deliverer. I don't care what you got
[1:18:50] need of tonight. I don't care what
[1:18:52] you're dealing with. I don't care how
[1:18:53] much pain. I I you know, all all that's
[1:18:56] may be real, but I believe our God is
[1:18:58] bigger than ever headache. I believe
[1:19:00] he's bigger than ever pain, every
[1:19:02] sadness, ever sorrow. Come on, somebody.
[1:19:04] You may be FACING SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY
[1:19:06] TERRIBLE in your life. AND IT DEPENDS ON
[1:19:08] HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. YOU THINK, "OH, IT'S
[1:19:10] GOING TO DESTROY ME." OR YOU CAN LOOK AT
[1:19:12] AND SAY, "WAIT A MINUTE. THIS IS AN
[1:19:14] OPPORTUNITY FOR MY FAITH TO RISE TO THAT
[1:19:17] LEVEL AND watch God MOVE ON THE SCENE
[1:19:19] AND TURN THIS THING RIGHT AROUND. WHAT
[1:19:21] GOD HALLELUJAH, WHAT SATAN INTENDED FOR
[1:19:24] A CURSE, GOD TURNED IT RIGHT AROUND INTO
[1:19:27] A BLESSING.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; BUT SHE CONSTANTLY AFFIRMED it was even
[1:19:34] so. THEN SAID THEY, "OH GOD, HE'S DIED."
[1:19:43] It's his angel.
[1:19:47] Dear God,
[1:19:51] [gasps]
[1:19:52] what are we going to do? Roa said, "He's
[1:19:55] waiting." I SAID, "SHUT UP, [screaming]
[1:19:58] GIRL. WE GOT TO SEE WHO'S GOING TO
[1:19:59] PREACH A FUNERAL. Who's going to do the
[1:20:01] funeral dinner? Who who's going to
[1:20:03] sing?" She said, "You ain't going to
[1:20:05] need no funeral or dinner.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; It's Peter out there."
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, it ain't Jesus out
[1:20:13] there. It's Jesus right in you.
[1:20:20] [sighs]
[1:20:22] But Peter continued knocking.
[1:20:28] They said, "WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE STOP
[1:20:30] THAT? WE'RE PRAYING. [screaming]
[1:20:31] WE'RE HAVING A PRAYER week for our
[1:20:33] brother. Oh God, have mercy on him. Lord
[1:20:36] God is a saints.
[1:20:40] Saints,
[1:20:42] somebody open the door and LET ME IN.
[1:20:44] COME [screaming] ON, SOMEBODY. AMEN.
[1:20:46] HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; And when they opened the door
[1:20:52] and saw him,
[1:20:55] they were.
[1:21:00] But there was one person there that
[1:21:02] wasn't astonished. Roa.
[1:21:06] She had heard, but now she seen.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; She could have said, "I tried to tell
[1:21:12] you all there's the apostle standing up
[1:21:14] there. There's the deacon boy. There's
[1:21:16] the trustees. They're all harmonizing in
[1:21:17] prayer. They're all going, you know,
[1:21:18] this and that and the other. She said,
[1:21:20] I'm telling you, he's out there. GOD, I
[1:21:21] HEARD YOUR IT DON'T WORK THAT WAY.
[1:21:23] THERE'S NO WAY THAT HE'S OUT OF THERE.
[1:21:25] HE'S BEHIND THE FIRST WARD AND THE
[1:21:27] SECOND WARD AND THE third ward AND THE
[1:21:28] IRON GATE. HE'S THERE. SHE SAID, I JUST
[1:21:30] SEEN HIM.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU A CRAZY GIRL?
[1:21:41] But he beckoning unto them with the hand
[1:21:44] to hold their peace,
[1:21:46] declared unto them how the Lord
[1:21:50] had brought him out of the prison. And
[1:21:52] he said, "Go show these things unto
[1:21:56] James and to the brethren." And he
[1:22:00] departed and went into another place.
[1:22:03] Now as soon as it was day, there was no
[1:22:07] small stir among the soldiers. what was
[1:22:11] become of Peter. So you imagine them old
[1:22:15] boys that was sitting in there locked up
[1:22:17] on one side. One one soldier sitting on
[1:22:20] this side locked to Peter. Another one
[1:22:22] sitting on this side locked to Peter.
[1:22:24] People soldiers sitting here at arm
[1:22:26] gates are on the other. They got up the
[1:22:27] next morning said
[1:22:29] what in the what?
[1:22:33] He disappeared.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:22:37] I LIKE THAT DISAPPEARING ACT. I hope I'm
[1:22:40] alive one day when THE DEVIL'S GOING TO
[1:22:42] TRY TO AGGRAVATE ME AND AGGRAVATE YOU
[1:22:44] AND DO ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO US AND
[1:22:47] HE'S GOING TO SPRING IT ON THIS CERTAIN
[1:22:48] CERTAIN DAY AND HE COMES TO MY HOUSE AND
[1:22:51] RINGS THE DOORBELL. DONNIE AIN'T THERE.
[1:22:53] CAROL AIN'T THERE. TRIES to get in the
[1:22:55] house, GET IN THE GARAGE DOOR. HE SAID,
[1:22:57] "WHAT IN THE WORLD'S HAPPENED TO HIM?
[1:22:58] TODAY IS MY DAY." AND WHAT HAPPENED? MY
[1:23:01] MY ONE MORNING I WAS THERE. THE NEXT
[1:23:03] MOMENT I WAS GONE.
[1:23:06] SO PETER WAS THERE. THEY KNEW HE WAS
[1:23:08] THERE. THEY FELT HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE.
[1:23:10] THEY SAT RIGHT THERE. OH MY HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:13] THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, CHILDREN.
[1:23:15] THE DEVIL MAY DONE HAVE YOU GRAVE MARKED
[1:23:18] OUT. HE MAY DONE HAVE YOUR CASKET PICKED
[1:23:20] OUT AND YOUR FLOWERS AND THE DRESS
[1:23:22] YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR. AND THE LORD JESUS
[1:23:25] SHOWS UP AND SAID, "COME ON, HONEY. COME
[1:23:27] ON. LET ME TAKE YOU OUT OF THIS
[1:23:29] SICKNESS. LET ME TAKE YOU OUT OF THIS
[1:23:31] TROUBLE THAT YOU'RE IN." AND THE DEVIL
[1:23:33] SAID, "WHAT IN THE WORLD HAPPENED TO
[1:23:34] HER? WHERE DID HE GO? OH MY GOODNESS. I
[1:23:37] DONE HAD THIS CASKET MADE AND THERE
[1:23:39] AIN'T NOBODY IN IT. PUT IN IT WHO YOU
[1:23:41] WANT, DEVIL. BUT IT AIN'T ME. IT AIN'T
[1:23:44] ME. YOU AIN'T PUTTING ME IN NO
[1:23:45] DENOMINATIONAL GRAVE. YOU AIN'T PUT ME
[1:23:48] IN NO DENOMINATIONAL CASKET. JESUS DONE
[1:23:51] GRABBED A HOLD OF MY HEAD AND SAID,
[1:23:52] "COME ON, DONNIE. LET'S GO."
[1:23:57] HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:59] Thank you, Lord.
[1:24:01] There won't be no small stir
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; whenever I'm gone.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; There won't be no small stir in Johnson
[1:24:12] City. When the elect out of word of life
[1:24:15] are gone and the elect from Germany and
[1:24:18] the elect from Africa and the elect from
[1:24:20] all over the world, there won't be no
[1:24:23] small stir. [gasps]
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Cuz them people that hate us so bad,
[1:24:26] they're going to say, "Oh Lord have
[1:24:28] mercy. What in the world have I done?
[1:24:31] What in the world have I said? I had the
[1:24:34] opportunity to go there. I call that man
[1:24:36] a devil. I call that prophet a liar.
[1:24:38] Lord God, have mercy on my soul. I ain't
[1:24:41] going to be saying that. I'm saying it
[1:24:43] now. Lord God, have mercy. Open my eyes.
[1:24:46] Bring me out of this world, Lord.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[1:24:51] Acts 27:22.
[1:24:55] AND HOW I EXHORT YOU TO BE ONE OF GOOD
[1:24:57] CHEER, for there SHALL BE NO LOSS of any
[1:25:01] man's life among you, but of the ship.
[1:25:05] And I remind you, we're talking about
[1:25:07] Paul now.
[1:25:09] And he's been on this ship, and they've
[1:25:11] had this tremendous storm for days and
[1:25:14] nights.
[1:25:16] For there stood by me this night
[1:25:20] the angel of God
[1:25:22] whose I am
[1:25:26] and whom I serve.
[1:25:28] Lord children, can't you see why the
[1:25:30] Lord wants us to know who we are? When
[1:25:33] we can stand our ground and the raw
[1:25:36] waves as a rock in the boat and tossing
[1:25:38] it around and we can look around and say
[1:25:40] there won't be one lost. Let me tell you
[1:25:43] right now, there won't be one of God's
[1:25:46] sheep lost. There won't be one elect
[1:25:49] member of the BRIDE OF CHRIST LOST. NOT
[1:25:51] ONE.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; NO, SIR.
[1:25:56] NOTICE. Oh my.
[1:25:59] HE SAYS, "THE ANGEL OF GOD WHOSE I AM
[1:26:02] AND WHOM I serve,
[1:26:04] SAYING, FEAR NOT, PAUL, THOU MUST BE
[1:26:07] brought before Caesar, AND LO GOD HATH
[1:26:11] GIVEN thee
[1:26:15] all them that sail with thee."
[1:26:19] I've often said before, it'll be a bad
[1:26:22] deal if it's my time to go and I'm
[1:26:24] flying across the Atlantic.
[1:26:28] I hope all the rest of them people none
[1:26:30] of that plane's going to be ready.
[1:26:32] But if IT SO HAPPENS THAT IT'S SOMEBODY
[1:26:34] I'M FLYING WITH and it's their time to
[1:26:37] go, I figure God can save one life if he
[1:26:40] don't save none of the rest of them. Cuz
[1:26:42] the devil can't take you. All the planes
[1:26:44] going down, we're crashing. We ain't got
[1:26:46] no fuel. My God is not going to let the
[1:26:48] devil outsmart him. He ain't going to
[1:26:50] let him take me until my life has
[1:26:53] completed God's purpose. I don't believe
[1:26:56] that just about me. I believe that about
[1:26:57] you.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; YOU IMAGINE WHAT CONFIDENCE THIS MAN
[1:27:02] could have in hearing brother Daryl in
[1:27:04] his voice.
[1:27:06] Praise God. Wherefore, sir,
[1:27:11] be of good cheer.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah, right. We're all seasick. I mean,
[1:27:17] the boats taken in water. The the sails
[1:27:20] have beat all to pieces. And you're
[1:27:21] TELLING US TO BE of good cheer, sir. I
[1:27:25] love that real true Christians are so
[1:27:27] courteous.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; NOTICE HE SAID, "YOU BUNCH OF INFIDELS.
[1:27:35] IF IT WASN'T FOR ME, YOU WOULD ALL WIND
[1:27:36] UP IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. YOU OUGHT
[1:27:38] TO BE SO GRATEFUL FOR ME. I'll tell you
[1:27:40] one thing."
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; If it hadn't been for Paul, God would
[1:27:45] have killed every one of them.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; But God gave them to Paul. Amen.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; But yet he didn't act like the master.
[1:27:57] He turns right around and says, "Sers,
[1:28:01] a lot of message folks could learn a
[1:28:03] little bit about respect.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; I ain't just talking about the
[1:28:07] preachers. I'm just talking about the
[1:28:08] humanity.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Be nice to them."
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; God knows a lot of them. That's all
[1:28:13] they're going to have. They ain't going
[1:28:14] to have nothing in this LIFE TO COME.
[1:28:17] WHEREFORE SERS, BE OF GOOD CHEER.
[1:28:19] [sighs]
[1:28:20] LISTEN TO THIS. FOR I believe
[1:28:25] God.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Don't misunderstand me. It didn't make
[1:28:31] no difference where they believed or
[1:28:33] not.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; He didn't even tell them to be believe.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; He just said, "Be of good cheer. You're
[1:28:41] saved cuz God gave you to me.
[1:28:47] Amen.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; For I believe God.
[1:28:52] Wow. When the bride can come to her
[1:28:55] PLACE
[1:28:56] IN SUCH A POSITION, NOT BRAGGING, NOT of
[1:29:00] her own arrogance, but by revelation
[1:29:02] from God, that the bride can say SUCH A
[1:29:05] THING. WHEREFORE, SIR, BE OF GOOD CHEER,
[1:29:07] FOR I believe God, that it shall be even
[1:29:13] as it was told me. Notice he don't say,
[1:29:17] "Y'all believe. Y'all believe with me
[1:29:20] now, right?" Okay. Now, if you don't
[1:29:22] BELIEVE WITH ME NOW, Y'ALL CAN'T BE
[1:29:24] SAVED. THAT'S NOT what the angel told
[1:29:25] him.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "As long as they b in the ship,
[1:29:30] everything's going to be good. I give
[1:29:31] them to you."
[1:29:34] Revelation 1 verse one. The revelation
[1:29:37] of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him
[1:29:39] to show unto his servants things which
[1:29:43] must shortly come to pass. And he sent
[1:29:46] and signified it by his angel
[1:29:51] singular
[1:29:53] unto his servant
[1:29:56] John.
[1:29:58] Now, angels are sent to earth to
[1:30:02] intervene
[1:30:03] many times in man's affairs.
[1:30:08] Sent to the earth to intervene
[1:30:12] in man's affairs. Watch this. In the
[1:30:15] healing line, 1953, you believe that he
[1:30:18] is here. It's a cancerous condition. And
[1:30:21] that man sitting right there has the
[1:30:23] same thing.
[1:30:25] Them demons are screaming one to
[1:30:28] another. You see, for pity,
[1:30:32] MERCY,
[1:30:34] THEY'RE CALLING.
[1:30:37] So is the angels of God
[1:30:41] calling.
[1:30:43] THE BATTLE is [screaming] here.
[1:30:45] Your faith will determine which way it
[1:30:49] goes.
[1:30:52] Now, here in this building, under this
[1:30:54] discernment, a person standing up there
[1:30:56] has cancer. That demon screams out for
[1:30:59] mercy or for pity or help. And there's
[1:31:03] another man sitting out there that has a
[1:31:06] cancerous demon as well. And he said,
[1:31:08] "Them demons are screaming one to
[1:31:11] another."
[1:31:13] Now, they might have been demons, but at
[1:31:15] least they're smart enough to know when
[1:31:17] they're outnumbered. Amen.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; They like a lot of message people. They
[1:31:21] just backslide and totally quit coming
[1:31:22] to church and don't reach out for help
[1:31:24] for nobody. And then they get in office
[1:31:25] shape ever was and they pick up the
[1:31:27] phone and call brother Rob or call
[1:31:29] brother Joe or call whoever. I I really
[1:31:31] need help. You should have done that six
[1:31:32] months ago before he got so cold.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice them demons. They
[1:31:38] knew. They knew
[1:31:42] THIS GIFT THAT GOD HAD SENT to the earth
[1:31:45] was so powerful
[1:31:48] they could not withstand it.
[1:31:52] I find that so amazing if he's supposed
[1:31:54] to be a false prophet.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; SO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THE greatest gift
[1:32:00] from a gentile prophet, never another
[1:32:03] like it on the face of the earth and
[1:32:05] never will be. And the greatest
[1:32:07] prophetic gift next to the Lord Jesus
[1:32:10] that ever struck the earth was a false
[1:32:12] prophet
[1:32:14] and not a true prophet. So you mean the
[1:32:16] devil outdone God when it come to
[1:32:19] prophetic gifts?
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Well, if that's so, shouldn't we be
[1:32:23] serving the devil
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; if he's bigger than God? And I mean I
[1:32:27] mean God God has no other promise that
[1:32:29] he's going to send a prophet like this
[1:32:31] anyway. AND AND THE ONE who had the
[1:32:33] greatest gifts and greatest anointing
[1:32:35] outside of the Lord Jesus wound up being
[1:32:37] a false one.
[1:32:45] Now here's powerful demons.
[1:32:49] THEY ARE PRINCIPALITIES
[1:32:51] archo
[1:32:53] of the principle and original order of
[1:32:56] the creation of angels.
[1:32:59] PRINCIPALITIES,
[1:33:00] POWERS, rulers of the darkness of this
[1:33:04] world.
[1:33:06] And here's also the angels OF GOD. SO
[1:33:08] DEMONS are screaming, "Help me, help me,
[1:33:12] help me."
[1:33:15] And the angels of God are also there.
[1:33:18] Listen to what he says now. So the
[1:33:20] angels of God are calling.
[1:33:24] Calling what?
[1:33:27] Calling who?
[1:33:29] Well, they're not calling to the demons,
[1:33:31] right? Who are they calling to? The
[1:33:35] people who need help.
[1:33:38] Now, here's demons and HERE'S THE ANGELS
[1:33:41] OF GOD. Both of them can appear,
[1:33:44] disappear, travel dimensionally,
[1:33:48] CAN DO ALL KINDS OF SUPERNATURAL
[1:33:50] ELEMENTS, BOTH demons and angels of God,
[1:33:53] but they will not determine the outcome.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE ANGELS OF GOD, AS STRONG AS
[1:33:59] THEY ARE, CANNOT DETERMINE THE OUTCOME.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; THE DEMONS OUT OF HELL, CANNOT determine
[1:34:05] the outcome.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; But who will determine the outcome? The
[1:34:12] battle is here. He says, now your faith
[1:34:15] will determine which way
[1:34:19] it goes.
[1:34:23] SO THE ANGELS OF GOD CAN'T DETERMINE IT.
[1:34:26] THE DEMONS OF HELL. WELL, THE DEVIL MADE
[1:34:29] ME DO IT. NO,
[1:34:31] the devil can't make you do anything you
[1:34:34] don't want to do.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; But you want to do it, and you blame it
[1:34:38] on the devil.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Preach, Brother Donnie. If you don't
[1:34:42] want to do wrong, ain't enough devils in
[1:34:44] hell that can make you do it. You have
[1:34:46] to surrender.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:50] Yeah.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Notice again now in [clears throat]
[1:34:54] when it comes to this demonic realm,
[1:34:58] I have to be the first one to confess to
[1:35:00] you. No doubt most of us know very very
[1:35:02] little about it. But let's read if we
[1:35:04] can in Daniel 10:10.
[1:35:07] Now sometimes the angels of God can't
[1:35:12] get to us.
[1:35:16] They just can't get to us whenever maybe
[1:35:19] we think they should.
[1:35:22] Daniel 10:10.
[1:35:24] And behold, a hand touched me which set
[1:35:27] me upon my knees and upon the palms of
[1:35:29] my hands. AND HE SAID UNTO ME, OH
[1:35:32] DANIEL, a man greatly beloved,
[1:35:37] understand the words that I speak unto
[1:35:39] thee, and stand upright. For unto them I
[1:35:41] now sent. And when he had spoken this
[1:35:44] word unto me, I stood trembling.
[1:35:47] THEN HE SAID UNTO ME, "FEAR NOT, DANIEL,
[1:35:49] FOR FROM THE FIRST day that thou didest
[1:35:51] set thine heart to understand and chasen
[1:35:54] thyself before thy God, thy words were
[1:35:57] heard, and I am come for thy words." So
[1:36:00] the very first words that Gabriel, this
[1:36:03] is Gabriel, the very first words that
[1:36:06] Gabriel says to Daniel, it is an
[1:36:10] explanation
[1:36:11] of his delay.
[1:36:16] Are you kidding me?
[1:36:19] The mighty angel Gabriel comes down here
[1:36:22] to Daniel and HIS FIRST WORDS BEFORE HE
[1:36:25] TELLS HIM WHY HE'S THERE, BEFORE HE
[1:36:26] gives him an understanding of that which
[1:36:28] is noted in the scripture, the very
[1:36:30] first thing he says, I want to explain
[1:36:32] to you why it's been 21 days.
[1:36:37] Are you kidding me? God owes us
[1:36:39] anything.
[1:36:41] But I want you to see what a position a
[1:36:44] prophet holds in God's eyes. AMEN.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; THIS ANGEL WHICH HAD NEVER THOUGHT A BAD
[1:36:51] THOUGHT, NEVER SINNED, [clears throat]
[1:36:54] sent down to a man called Daniel and
[1:36:58] he's explaining something to him. I'm
[1:37:01] late.
[1:37:02] Sorry.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; I'm late.
[1:37:06] But I wanted to let you know why he's
[1:37:07] late. [snorts]
[1:37:09] Are you kidding me? An angel of God is
[1:37:11] telling a mortal human being
[1:37:14] why he's late.
[1:37:17] Now he SAID, 'THE REASON I'M HERE,
[1:37:19] notice the last few words there, verse
[1:37:22] 12,
[1:37:23] I am come
[1:37:26] for thy words.
[1:37:30] Daniel pulled Gabriel
[1:37:33] out of heaven.
[1:37:36] I am come
[1:37:38] for thy words.
[1:37:41] But the prince of the kingdom of Persia
[1:37:47] withtood me one and 20 days. Now
[1:37:52] remember who this is.
[1:37:54] THIS IS NOT A LOWER RANKING devil or a
[1:37:59] lower ranking angel. WE'RE NOT TALKING
[1:38:01] ABOUT A HIGH PRIEST. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
[1:38:04] GABRIEL.
[1:38:06] GABRIEL.
[1:38:08] And yet a demon
[1:38:11] of greater hierarchy
[1:38:14] withstood him
[1:38:16] and he couldn't get through.
[1:38:22] Oh my goodness. I'll tell you friends,
[1:38:25] we need the angels of God to help us.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; If Gabriel couldn't get through, what
[1:38:29] makes you and I think we can get through
[1:38:32] without supernatural help from Almighty
[1:38:34] God? We can't do this on our own. WE
[1:38:36] CAN'T DO IT BY KNOWING THE BIBLE. WE
[1:38:38] CAN'T DO IT BY MEMORIZING THE MESSAGE.
[1:38:40] WE CAN'T DO IT JUST BY PRESSING PLAY.
[1:38:43] WE'VE GOT TO HAVE DIVINE INTERVENTION IN
[1:38:45] OUR LIVES OR WE'LL never make the grade.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Now explains to him what happened. But
[1:38:54] the prince
[1:38:56] of the kingdom of Persia, the prince of
[1:39:00] the kingdom of Persia withtood me one
[1:39:04] and 20 DAYS. BUT LO, MICHAEL.
[1:39:09] MICHAEL, and the word Michael means one
[1:39:12] like God.
[1:39:15] One of the chief princes came to help
[1:39:18] me. Gabriel
[1:39:20] needs help.
[1:39:23] If Gabriel needs it, Donnie needs it.
[1:39:37] One of the chief PRINCES CAME TO HELP ME
[1:39:40] and I remain there with the kings
[1:39:45] of Persia.
[1:39:46] Now remember Gabriel
[1:39:49] Gabriel's business
[1:39:52] in the court of Persia
[1:39:55] was to work on the minds
[1:40:00] of the king Cyrus
[1:40:04] and also on the chief leaders
[1:40:08] there in the province.
[1:40:12] NOW REMEMBER GOD had a word.
[1:40:15] Amen.
[1:40:17] AND IT WAS GETTING time for that word to
[1:40:20] be fulfilled. AND THAT WORD was the word
[1:40:23] of Jeremiah WHEN JEREMIAH SAID, "YOU'LL
[1:40:25] GO down there and you'll be down there
[1:40:27] for 70 years." And that time was rolling
[1:40:30] around for them to go back and rebuild
[1:40:32] the house of God.
[1:40:35] But the prince, this demon
[1:40:38] was there in the court and he was trying
[1:40:42] to stop this word in its season from
[1:40:47] being fulfilled.
[1:40:49] So, Michael had to come down
[1:40:53] and take over and release Gabriel to go
[1:40:58] down and explain to Daniel
[1:41:02] [panting and gasps]
[1:41:02] what was going on.
[1:41:05] And after he got the message DELIVERED
[1:41:07] THAT HE TOLD HIM, I SAID, "I'M GOING TO
[1:41:08] GO back and I'm going to fight."
[1:41:12] Lord, have mercy, CHILDREN. YOU SEE WHAT
[1:41:15] HE'S THERE FOR? HE'S THERE TO INFLUENCE
[1:41:18] THE KING of Persia and his nobles. But
[1:41:23] while he's there, and they're just
[1:41:24] talking politics and this and that and
[1:41:26] the other, and they'd get TO ARGUING AND
[1:41:28] FUSSING BACK AND FORTH AND BACK AND
[1:41:29] FORTH, AND THEY'RE JUST THINKING, "OH, I
[1:41:31] DON'T LIKE HIS POLITICS. I DON'T LIKE
[1:41:33] WHAT HE SAYS. THEY don't even realize
[1:41:36] the angels of God are there at the
[1:41:38] throne of the king.
[1:41:40] The angels of God are sitting there
[1:41:42] around the nobles table and they're
[1:41:44] discussing, "Oh, we're going to do
[1:41:45] this." DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THAT'S WHAT
[1:41:47] HAPPENS AT the White House. DON'T YOU
[1:41:49] UNDERSTAND? THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS AT THE
[1:41:51] UN. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THAT'S WHY THE
[1:41:54] UN AND MANY OF THESE NATIONS OF THE
[1:41:55] WORLD, WHY THEY SO HATE ISRAEL? BECAUSE
[1:41:58] THEM NATIONS, THEY come to the UN. And
[1:42:00] most of them nations have a demon
[1:42:02] that'll come there with them. And them
[1:42:05] demons hate Israel. And they will come
[1:42:08] and they more more amendments from the
[1:42:10] UN voted against Israel than ALL THE
[1:42:12] REST OF THE NATIONS PUT TOGETHER. IT'S
[1:42:14] NOT JUST A GATHERING OF THE MEN OF THE
[1:42:16] EMBASSY. IT'S A GATHERING TOGETHER OF
[1:42:19] DEMONS OUT OF HELL. AND THEY HATE
[1:42:22] ISRAEL. OH MY. HALLELUJAH. I'LL TELL YOU
[1:42:25] ONE THING. THAT'S EXACTLY SOMETIMES WHY
[1:42:27] YOU HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME PRAYING. WHY
[1:42:30] YOU HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME COMING TO
[1:42:31] CHURCH BECAUSE IT'S A GATHERING AROUND
[1:42:34] THE TABLE OF GOD. AND THE ANGELS OF GOD
[1:42:36] ARE WANT US TO COME TOGETHER TO FEAST
[1:42:38] AND TO BE STRENGTHENED AND THE DEMONS
[1:42:40] ARE FIGHTING YOU AND THEY'LL CAUSE YOU
[1:42:42] TO STAY HOME WITH A HEADACHE OR A
[1:42:44] BACKACHCHE OR SOMEBODY HURT YOUR
[1:42:46] FEELING. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHO'S AT
[1:42:48] THE COUNSELING TABLE AND WHAT VALUE IT
[1:42:51] IS TO GATHER TOGETHER, CHILDREN?
[1:42:56] Oh [laughter] my. [applause]
[1:43:00] YOU SEE, GABRIEL IS THERE and he's
[1:43:02] trying to influence the king and the
[1:43:06] king is getting these thoughts. You
[1:43:08] know, we we need to do this for these
[1:43:10] these Jews. I mean, we need to do it.
[1:43:12] Now, they're said, "What? We don't WHAT
[1:43:15] THE NO WAY. WHY THEM PEOPLE? THEY'RE
[1:43:18] THEY'RE THE THEY'RE THE filth of the
[1:43:20] world. They're just this and that and
[1:43:21] the other." Don't you understand what
[1:43:23] got on Hitler?
[1:43:25] DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S ALREADY HERE
[1:43:26] RIGHT NOW? ANTI-SEMITISM FRIENDS, IT'S
[1:43:29] INCREASED MANY, MANY HUNDREDS OF TIMES,
[1:43:31] JUST SINCE OCTOBER THE 7TH. WHY? That
[1:43:34] anointing is still here on the earth.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Them demons that hate them Jews are
[1:43:39] still here. How much more do they hate
[1:43:41] the bride? But the feelings are mutual.
[1:43:43] We hate every one of them, too. Praise
[1:43:46] be to God. I've done looked at my
[1:43:48] armament several times. I found a sword.
[1:43:50] I found a shield. I found a helmet. I
[1:43:52] found grief. I found ALL KINDS OF
[1:43:54] THINGS. I'VE LOOKED in the front pocket,
[1:43:56] the back pocket, the side pocket. I've
[1:43:57] looked hidden everywhere. I ain't never
[1:43:59] found a white flag of surrender that I
[1:44:01] was issued in the army of the Lord. SO
[1:44:03] APPARENTLY THAT MEANS I AIN'T NEVER
[1:44:05] SUPPOSED TO SURRENDER. AND I'VE DONE
[1:44:07] FOUND OUT THERE AIN'T NOTHING ON MY BACK
[1:44:10] BECAUSE GOD DON'T WANT ME RUNNING FROM
[1:44:12] THE DEVIL. GOD DON'T WANT YOU RUNNING
[1:44:14] FROM THE DEVIL. HE WANTS YOU FACING HIM
[1:44:16] AND SAY, "BACK OFF. GIVE ME MY SON. GIVE
[1:44:19] ME MY DAUGHTER. GIVE ME MY HUSBAND. TURN
[1:44:22] THEM LOOSE, DEVIL. I'M COMING AFTER MY
[1:44:24] MY CHILDREN, MY FAMILY. MEET THEM FACE
[1:44:27] TO FACE.
[1:44:32] [sighs and gasps]
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; You see the time,
[1:44:35] the message of the hour of their hour
[1:44:40] was a thought from God
[1:44:43] that it was time to go back
[1:44:47] and rebuild the temple.
[1:44:50] And them [clears throat] DEMONS WILL
[1:44:51] SAY, "NO, NO, NO, NO." SO WHAT WOULD
[1:44:54] they do? Get on them politicians.
[1:44:57] And then them politicians, they say,
[1:44:59] "I'll tell one thing. These bunch of
[1:45:01] Jews, they're this and that and the
[1:45:03] other." And them demons would get on
[1:45:05] this guy and get on that senator and get
[1:45:06] on that guy and that guy and there's
[1:45:08] Gabriel in there and he'd find one over
[1:45:10] here and he'd find the King Cyrus and
[1:45:12] find one over there and now brethren,
[1:45:14] brethren, you know, I mean, these people
[1:45:16] really ain't done anything. We ain't
[1:45:18] really got no proof of it. Now, I just
[1:45:19] want to tell you here, I I guess I
[1:45:21] should just let you know this that that
[1:45:23] I couldn't find anywhere where the
[1:45:24] Courier Journal was able to authenticate
[1:45:27] that Daniel actually saw this angel. And
[1:45:29] I couldn't find on Snoops nowhere where
[1:45:31] that actually they have any proof that
[1:45:33] this angel came to Daniel. And I realize
[1:45:35] we can only take Daniel's word for it.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; And we're supposed to have two or three
[1:45:43] witnesses, right?
[1:45:47] Come on.
[1:45:49] [snorts]
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; I love smelling fried devil hide.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Come on, children.
[1:46:00] SO, THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS THERE. IS THERE
[1:46:02] S AN ANGEL?
[1:46:04] AND GABRIEL IS THERE IN these intense
[1:46:06] meetings and Daniel's crying and he's
[1:46:10] praying.
[1:46:12] Why didn't God send another one? Because
[1:46:15] Gabriel is the angel sent about Jewish
[1:46:19] affairs.
[1:46:23] So, he's really busy at the temple
[1:46:25] there. And here's Daniel in the same
[1:46:27] kingdom. You imagine he's so tied up
[1:46:30] though in politics
[1:46:32] because it's so important. And one that
[1:46:33] Daniel wasn't important. Can't you see
[1:46:34] why I explained it to him? He said,
[1:46:36] "Daniel, you're beloved.
[1:46:39] God loves you so much.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Now, I wonder why he would say that.
[1:46:44] Sister, go reckon he was down. He's just
[1:46:46] kind of weary and says, "The Lord must
[1:46:48] not love me. I mean, I've been praying
[1:46:49] for three weeks. I've afflicted my soul.
[1:46:52] I fasted. I've went through this
[1:46:53] terrible time. I ain't heard a word from
[1:46:54] the Lord." And he said, "Oh, Daniel,
[1:46:57] you're greatly beloved. You're not just
[1:47:00] loved, but you're beloved. Beloved,
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; he loves you with a special love which
[1:47:07] is even above the rest of the people
[1:47:09] that are here. But I was just busy.
[1:47:13] [laughter]
[1:47:15] Don't you understand? Angels of God are
[1:47:18] not omnipotent.
[1:47:20] They're not omnipresent.
[1:47:23] They cannot be everywhere at the same
[1:47:25] time. Let me bring it on down, which
[1:47:27] ought to make somebody shout with me
[1:47:28] here tonight. Neither is the devil.
[1:47:33] Hallelujah. The devil can't be HERE AND
[1:47:36] THERE AND THERE AND SOMEWHERE ELSE ALL
[1:47:37] AT THE SAME TIME CUZ HE AIN'T LIKE GOD.
[1:47:40] HALLELUJAH. HE COULD NOT DO ANYTHING IF
[1:47:43] HE DIDN'T HAVE A BUNCH OF DEVILS. And
[1:47:44] devils go HERE AND THERE AND THERE.
[1:47:46] PROBABLY MOST OF US AIN'T NEVER even
[1:47:47] faced the devil himself anyway. We've
[1:47:49] got little bitty opons or whatever they
[1:47:51] are. And they come AGAINST US AND FIGHT
[1:47:53] US AND DO WHATEVER. BUT THEY REPRESENT
[1:47:55] THE DEVIL. Same way with the angels OF
[1:47:57] GOD. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] I MAY NEVER
[1:48:01] WALK WHERE GOD'S PROPHET DID THAT THE
[1:48:03] LORD JESUS WOULD COME DOWN. BUT THAT'S
[1:48:05] ALL RIGHT. HE CAN SEND ME AN ANGEL. IT
[1:48:07] STILL REPRESENTS HIM. IT'S HIS PRESENCE.
[1:48:10] HALLELUJAH. TO BE ABLE TO MINISTER to
[1:48:12] the saints of God.
[1:48:16] Oh, praise God. So you they're they're
[1:48:19] trying to they're trying to encourage
[1:48:21] them with thoughts and that's I think
[1:48:23] it'd be a good idea to let them go back
[1:48:25] and you know, don't don't you think it
[1:48:27] would BE THERE? NO, GREAT KIM. I'VE
[1:48:31] ALWAYS AGREED WITH YOU. I CAN'T BELIEVE
[1:48:32] YOU'RE THAT WAY. AND then they'll
[1:48:33] probably go home and say, "What in the
[1:48:35] world was the matter with him?"
[1:48:37] You've been around many of these people
[1:48:39] that's left the message lately and seen
[1:48:42] how some of them become. I'm telling you
[1:48:44] friends, I've dealt with a bunch of
[1:48:46] them. It's absolutely awful. The kind of
[1:48:50] spirit, the kind of attitude that they
[1:48:53] get. And you want me to leave this to
[1:48:55] follow you?
[1:48:58] No,
[1:48:59] no, thank you. SO THERE WAS A MAN THERE
[1:49:02] IN THE COURT NAMED SIMBUSES.
[1:49:05] So what he was doing, he was courting he
[1:49:07] was courting these great leaders and
[1:49:09] giving them gifts
[1:49:13] and trying to buy their loyalty and
[1:49:15] saying we we we don't need to do this.
[1:49:17] The king was wrong on this.
[1:49:20] And you know who was anointing them?
[1:49:23] demons.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; To pull them away from the program of
[1:49:28] God.
[1:49:33] So here they were battling back and
[1:49:34] forth and back and forth and gave
[1:49:37] whatever he was saying to the Lord God.
[1:49:39] And all of the sudden into that realm
[1:49:42] walks Michael.
[1:49:46] And Michael tells Gabriel,
[1:49:48] "Go to Daniel."
[1:49:51] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:49:54] Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:57] Go to Daniel and tell him.
[1:50:02] I wonder how many times, my precious
[1:50:04] friends, when we've been laboring and
[1:50:08] praying and trying to get an answer from
[1:50:11] God,
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; and you thought, "Don't he love me
[1:50:13] anymore? Haven't you heard me, Lord?"
[1:50:18] But maybe God would maybe God's got an
[1:50:21] angel here in this vicinity and he
[1:50:23] covers pretty good area.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; He may not be able to get to you quite
[1:50:32] as fast as you'd like for him to,
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; but don't worry, he's got your address.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; And he ain't like UPS or USPS or FedEx
[1:50:43] or DHL. He won't deliver your package at
[1:50:47] the wrong door.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Won't you love him tonight?
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Can we stand together?
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:51:07] This has been so encouraging to me these
[1:51:11] several weeks that I've been been able
[1:51:13] to look at this and study it and bring
[1:51:14] it to you. I mean, I believed, you know,
[1:51:18] pretty much my whole life since getting
[1:51:19] saved that there was angels, of course.
[1:51:24] But not till I come to this message I
[1:51:26] realize how great the presence was. and
[1:51:30] then studying it in the last month and a
[1:51:32] half or so,
[1:51:34] it has just brought such comfort to my
[1:51:36] heart, not only with life and the
[1:51:39] challenges of life, but with death
[1:51:44] that Satan cannot take them
[1:51:47] until the Lord God is ready.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not only the passing of those who
[1:51:52] are already gone, but for those of us, I
[1:51:55] believe there's people here tonight will
[1:51:57] be alive when our Lord Jesus comes.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; We will need the angels of God to help
[1:52:04] us get in to that other realm.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; I believe they'll be there.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Can we bow our heads?
[1:52:16] Hallelujah.
[1:52:19] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:52:24] Heavenly Father, as we
[1:52:28] ponder over these things,
[1:52:33] they've been going on around us all of
[1:52:36] our lives.
[1:52:38] And yet most of us
[1:52:41] are not even aware, I'm sure, to this
[1:52:43] day, even those of us that love you,
[1:52:46] how true, how real that it is.
[1:52:50] Things have happened in our lives and
[1:52:52] we've had divine interventions and
[1:52:55] people call it luck.
[1:52:57] I don't need luck. I got Jesus.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Not only have I got Jesus,
[1:53:04] I've got his angels.
[1:53:08] And Lord, I thank you for that.
[1:53:11] Just like as it was in the days of
[1:53:14] Daniel,
[1:53:18] I believe myself that you
[1:53:21] can allow this person to go into the
[1:53:24] White House or another one or another
[1:53:26] one or another one, whoever they would
[1:53:28] be. For the powers that be are ordained
[1:53:33] of God.
[1:53:36] I just wish people could learn and see
[1:53:40] the nations down through the ages which
[1:53:42] have attacked Israel and tried to
[1:53:44] destroy them
[1:53:46] and they wound up destroying themselves.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; And it's the same way with your message.
[1:53:52] In every age,
[1:53:55] Rome tried to kill them. The Catholics
[1:53:58] tried to kill Martin Luther.
[1:54:01] on down through the ages, they've tried
[1:54:03] over and over again.
[1:54:07] Oh, but Lord God, you've always always
[1:54:10] had somebody that would stand up for
[1:54:12] you.
[1:54:14] And now here we are again. Lord,
[1:54:16] Satan hates this message now more than
[1:54:19] when the prophet was here preaching it.
[1:54:22] And we know a lot of it is to just to
[1:54:24] divert our attention
[1:54:27] off of our promised land because this
[1:54:29] word is our land in this present life. I
[1:54:32] mean,
[1:54:34] and if he can get our eyes off of that
[1:54:36] and we worry about what this one says
[1:54:38] and what that one thinks and what's this
[1:54:40] one's going to do and that one's going
[1:54:42] to do, it's all a great scheme.
[1:54:46] And it's so sad because there's people
[1:54:48] that at one time have been part of our
[1:54:50] church. [cough] They moved out from
[1:54:53] under the influence of angels of God and
[1:54:56] moved under the influence of demons.
[1:55:00] They give their lives, their mouths,
[1:55:02] their strength
[1:55:04] to now try to destroy the very thing
[1:55:07] they once said changed their life.
[1:55:12] [music] How sad.
[1:55:14] And it's like for many of them, they
[1:55:16] have such a hatred for God's prophet and
[1:55:19] a hatred for this message.
[1:55:22] And instead of being more like Jesus and
[1:55:24] praying for those of us that they think
[1:55:26] are so blind,
[1:55:28] Lord, they become so vicious and
[1:55:31] violent.
[1:55:34] Lord, after studying this, it helps me
[1:55:37] to realize
[1:55:39] [music] as it was in the days of
[1:55:40] Sandbalat,
[1:55:42] as it's been down through the days of
[1:55:44] the Assyrians, the Babylonians,
[1:55:47] now we can see it with the Palestinians.
[1:55:50] Lord,
[1:55:52] we can see it with Rome, which once
[1:55:55] ruled the world,
[1:55:58] and where are they now?
[1:56:00] When Carol and I were in Rome several
[1:56:02] years ago and we saw the statues there
[1:56:06] and they would every time they change an
[1:56:07] emperor, they would of course have to
[1:56:10] carve a new image of the new emperor.
[1:56:13] But their kingdom became so rotten and
[1:56:16] so distorted by the very demons that
[1:56:18] anointed them to conquer.
[1:56:22] And they was changing emperors so fast
[1:56:25] [music] that they got to the place that
[1:56:26] they quit making a brand new total
[1:56:29] image.
[1:56:30] So they just made the head where it
[1:56:33] would sit on top of the shoulders and
[1:56:35] when a new emperor would come up they
[1:56:37] just take the head off and put the new
[1:56:38] head of a new man on there cuz it's
[1:56:41] replacing them so fast.
[1:56:44] [music] So their headship has just
[1:56:46] changed from one year to another, six
[1:56:47] months to another.
[1:56:50] [music] Under that demonic anointing,
[1:56:52] they were able to conquer the known
[1:56:54] world.
[1:56:56] I can't imagine how it must be down in
[1:56:59] hell.
[1:57:01] Cuz hell is established upon a split
[1:57:05] of the angelic church in heaven. [music]
[1:57:10] And them demons,
[1:57:12] the prophet said, they're spirits. So
[1:57:15] the spirit of Germany and the spirit of
[1:57:17] France and the spirit of America, and he
[1:57:19] said them spirits get jealous of one
[1:57:23] another and then they cause war.
[1:57:27] And yet every one of them are under the
[1:57:29] same head.
[1:57:32] And brother David was talking about the
[1:57:33] other day. Brother David s, brother
[1:57:35] David, can you imagine what hell must be
[1:57:37] like?
[1:57:39] them demons fussing, arguing, fighting.
[1:57:46] Why? That's what their king done. He
[1:57:50] rebelled against the headship of God and
[1:57:52] established his own kingdom
[1:57:55] from a split in heaven.
[1:57:59] [music] So that's why Satan likes to
[1:58:01] split families,
[1:58:02] split homes, and make them where they
[1:58:04] won't talk to one another, won't even
[1:58:06] speak to one another.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Who does that? Satan does.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; But oh Jesus, as I read it today, your
[1:58:15] prophet said, "One day when you come
[1:58:18] back to the earth again, there'll be no
[1:58:21] German spirit, no Finnish spirit, no
[1:58:25] American spirit, but everybody will have
[1:58:29] the spirit [music] of God.
[1:58:32] And they'll all speak the same language.
[1:58:35] and they'll all have the same motives.
[1:58:39] Hasten the day, Lord Jesus.
[1:58:43] Granted, Father,
[1:58:46] Lord, help us
[1:58:49] as we're the closing hours of the
[1:58:51] Gentile history. There must be a few
[1:58:54] more words that's yet to be fulfilled.
[1:58:57] No doubt the angels of God are here
[1:58:59] trying to anoint the participants of the
[1:59:02] anointed word of the hour. Demons of
[1:59:05] hell are powerless. We know without
[1:59:08] human beings.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; So them demons need humans to try to
[1:59:15] afflict us.
[1:59:17] Them demons need human tongues,
[1:59:20] human hands
[1:59:22] [music]
[1:59:23] in order to go to websites and put all
[1:59:25] their trash and whatever and write
[1:59:26] emails and texts and so on and so on.
[1:59:29] Them demons can't text. Them demons
[1:59:31] can't email.
[1:59:34] So they need humans.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; What a terrible thing to think that
[1:59:39] people are submitting their text to
[1:59:42] demonic influence.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Preachers getting in the pullpit
[1:59:47] preaching against the anointed word of
[1:59:50] the hour,
[1:59:52] not knowing they're cutting their own
[1:59:55] head off
[1:59:57] [music] as the Assyrians did, as the
[2:00:00] Babylonians did.
[2:00:02] Lord, help us that we will never turn
[2:00:06] our lives
[2:00:07] over to Satan and his demons.
[2:00:12] How many will raise your hands with me
[2:00:14] tonight and say, "Lord, keep me. Keep me
[2:00:16] from such.
[2:00:19] Keep me from demonic influence, Lord."
[2:00:23] Hallelujah.
[2:00:25] Think of it, children.
[2:00:28] [music] Them demons cannot do anything
[2:00:30] on their own. They're powerless.
[2:00:33] They could not make Cyrus do anything.
[2:00:37] The angels couldn't make him. So there
[2:00:40] in that conference room was all this
[2:00:43] warfare going on.
[2:00:45] It's been here tonight. Satan trying to
[2:00:48] make some of you tired, some of you
[2:00:50] weary, some of you fighting sleep, some
[2:00:53] of you thinking about the day and you've
[2:00:54] had bad news about your job or your work
[2:00:57] or whatever and you fought through hell
[2:00:59] to try to concentrate [music] and the
[2:01:01] angels of God have been there trying to
[2:01:03] nudge you. Listen, listen, pay
[2:01:06] attention. Your deliverance is here
[2:01:09] tonight.
[2:01:12] The war has been raging
[2:01:15] and the outcome will be determined by
[2:01:18] us.
[2:01:20] What if my outcome is going to be
[2:01:22] determined by me? [music] Then I
[2:01:26] determine
[2:01:28] I am victorious.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; I am a winner, [music] not a loser.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; I am undefeable
[2:01:38] by the grace of God. I'm more than a
[2:01:42] conqueror.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Satan will never be able to wipe me out.
[2:01:48] He will never be able to take my name
[2:01:51] from the lamb's book of life.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; He'll never get me so low that I'll
[2:01:56] quit. It ain't in me to quit.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:01] If it's the outcome is going to be
[2:02:03] determined by my faith, then that's what
[2:02:06] my faith says tonight. I'm saying what
[2:02:09] Jesus says about me. That he loved me
[2:02:12] before the foundation of the world. And
[2:02:15] my name was written in the book the same
[2:02:18] time his was. Hallelujah. Before there's
[2:02:21] ever one speck of stardust. That's my
[2:02:25] confession.
[2:02:26] So my outcome is not going to be
[2:02:29] determined by demons. It's not going to
[2:02:31] be determined by people.
[2:02:34] Oh, glory to God. My faith says I am a
[2:02:38] believer. I am a Christian. Greater is
[2:02:43] he that is in me than he that is in the
[2:02:47] world.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So what about it
[2:02:50] friends? What's your outcome going to
[2:02:53] be? Tell me what's your outcome going to
[2:02:56] be? Are you defeated?
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Are you victors by the grace OF GOD? ARE
[2:03:01] YOU OVERCOMERS?
[2:03:03] IS JESUS your savior?
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Is he your healer?
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IS HE MORE than enough?
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, we worship you, Lord Jesus.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; We worship you, Lord. The prophet said,
[2:03:19] "Them demons are here tonight waving
[2:03:21] their black flags, but the angels of God
[2:03:24] are waving their white flags of
[2:03:26] victory." Well, a flag is an end sign.
[2:03:31] And they're waving to let people know
[2:03:34] which side is which.
[2:03:36] Why are they waving? Both sides are
[2:03:39] wanting us to get on their side.
[2:03:43] So, I'm going to go join sides with the
[2:03:46] angels of God.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say to them demons, get
[2:03:49] away from me. I don't want nothing to do
[2:03:52] with you. Amen. I didn't come from where
[2:03:55] you live and I ain't going to where
[2:03:57] you're from.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; I come from God and I'm going back to
[2:04:00] God.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. Let that be your
[2:04:04] confession. Remember, he can only
[2:04:05] confess. Only confess what you confess
[2:04:09] that he's already done for you. Let your
[2:04:12] confession match his in heaven.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's just raise our
[2:04:19] hands now
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; and close our eyes.
[2:04:23] We say, "Brother Donnie, I don't feel
[2:04:25] anything." You don't have to. Just let
[2:04:27] the angels of God walk up and down these
[2:04:30] aisles.
[2:04:31] They're here right now, children. How do
[2:04:34] you know that, Brother Donnie? Cuz his
[2:04:35] word says they are.
[2:04:39] The Lord Jesus is here and you are here.
[2:04:42] And they come together where the saints
[2:04:44] of God are gathered. We're standing here
[2:04:48] on hallowed holy ground in the presence
[2:04:52] of the great king and the angels of God.
[2:04:55] You need healing, they're here. The
[2:04:58] healing angels of God are here. You say
[2:05:01] healing angel? Yeah. That's what came
[2:05:03] down to the waters there and would
[2:05:06] trouble the water. The prophet of God
[2:05:08] called that angel, brother John, a
[2:05:10] healing angel. So that healing angel
[2:05:14] would come down and he would trouble the
[2:05:16] water. Well, we don't have to have no
[2:05:18] water troubled here tonight. But if he
[2:05:21] can come and anoint your faith or be
[2:05:24] able to strengthen you to rise above
[2:05:26] whatever it is that you're dealing with.
[2:05:29] Oh, praise the Lord. How many believe
[2:05:32] you can do it on Wednesday night? I'm
[2:05:33] glad they're just not limited to Sunday
[2:05:35] morning. Boy, we'd have been a mess,
[2:05:36] wouldn't we? Amen.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be in church, but
[2:05:40] there's just greater chances it can
[2:05:41] happen to you cuz there more licks of
[2:05:43] fire here.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; What do you need of children?
[2:05:48] Tell him. Speak to your husband.
[2:05:52] Speak to him. Lord, I need
[2:05:55] encouragement.
[2:05:56] I need strength. The Lord Jesus can
[2:05:59] relate to that cuz he was that way.
[2:06:02] [music] He needed strength, but he
[2:06:05] wasn't too big to let someone lesser
[2:06:08] than himself minister to him.
[2:06:11] Oh, praise be to God. We worship you
[2:06:15] tonight, Lord Jesus.
[2:06:17] We magnify your holy name, Lord God.
[2:06:22] Praise the Lord. Would you just turn and
[2:06:25] lay your hand on the person standing
[2:06:27] there near you? Just offer a word of
[2:06:29] prayer for him, would you? Oh Jesus.
[2:06:34] Believers to believers, eagles to
[2:06:36] eagles. Father, we pray for healing. We
[2:06:40] pray for strength. We pray for
[2:06:43] encouragement.
[2:06:45] Lord, I know several sick couldn't be
[2:06:48] here tonight.
[2:06:50] Lord, Brother Harvey called me today.
[2:06:52] And Sister Shirley, Lord, having
[2:06:55] problems in her back and facing some
[2:06:57] other things. Lord, Lisa's been sick.
[2:07:00] Lord, Courtney, come home sick today
[2:07:03] with a terrible headache. Lord, others
[2:07:06] that are sick. I I wasn't able to hear
[2:07:07] the prayer requests, but Lord, you know
[2:07:09] them all. Father, may the spirit of God
[2:07:12] go right there to each of their homes
[2:07:14] tonight. May the angel of God be able to
[2:07:17] pass to their neighborhoods.
[2:07:20] Oh Lord, hallelujah. We believe you,
[2:07:22] Jesus. And if you're so busy that you
[2:07:25] can't get to him till in the morning,
[2:07:27] we'll still be waiting on you, Lord. You
[2:07:30] know our address. You know where we
[2:07:32] live. Father, hallelujah. We believe you
[2:07:35] tonight, Lord God. Maybe some they're
[2:07:38] facing a terrible financial situation.
[2:07:40] Lord, maybe it's a a legal sort of
[2:07:43] situation. They don't know what to do.
[2:07:45] Lord God, I believe you're our great
[2:07:47] lawyer. Father, you can plead our case
[2:07:50] in the name of Jesus. Let the angels of
[2:07:53] God, oh Lord, be able to minister to
[2:07:56] your believing children. Lord, we don't
[2:07:58] want to just limit it to those who are
[2:08:00] in this visible presence and your divine
[2:08:02] presence that's here. But Lord, those
[2:08:04] that would be streaming or those that
[2:08:06] are go back and archive. Father, may the
[2:08:08] presence of God come in their car. May
[2:08:11] the presence of God come in their living
[2:08:12] room, their office, wherever it is
[2:08:14] they'll be streaming this service.
[2:08:16] Father, may the presence of the Holy
[2:08:18] Spirit become so great they just have to
[2:08:20] pull over on the side of the road. We
[2:08:22] believe you love your children that
[2:08:24] much, Lord. Oh lamb of God, touch your
[2:08:27] children to that. Father, you know I
[2:08:29] love your people, Lord. I want to see
[2:08:31] them helped. I want to see them healed.
[2:08:33] I want to see them delivered. If I do as
[2:08:36] their pastor, how much more do you do,
[2:08:38] Father, with divine love? Oh Jesus,
[2:08:41] touch each one tonight, I pray. Lord
[2:08:43] God, we love you, Father. We believe
[2:08:46] we're going to spend eternity together.
[2:08:48] We thank you for our church. We thank
[2:08:50] you for our church family. Lord God, be
[2:08:53] mindful of each one of them, would you?
[2:08:55] Lord, we worship you tonight, Father. We
[2:08:58] bless your holy name, Lord God. We
[2:09:01] worship you, Lord. Oh, hallelujah. We're
[2:09:05] not here to praise any man. We're not
[2:09:07] here even to worship angels. We're
[2:09:09] worship to here to worship you, Lord.
[2:09:12] I've never bowed my knee. I've never
[2:09:14] said another being's name. I have never
[2:09:17] baptized in any other being's name. Oh
[2:09:20] Lord, I worshiped you and you alone. All
[2:09:23] these years of my life, I've given no
[2:09:26] praise to man, no credit to man. I've
[2:09:28] only worshiped you, Lord. Oh,
[2:09:31] hallelujah. And I can't wait to be able
[2:09:33] to stand before you in my real body and
[2:09:36] be able to worship you like I've never
[2:09:38] done before. But until I get that body,
[2:09:41] I'm going to worship you, Lord. And this
[2:09:42] 69year-old body that I've got, I'm going
[2:09:45] to praise you. I'm going to lift my
[2:09:47] hands. I'm going to preach. I'm going to
[2:09:49] pray. I'm going to study. I'm going to
[2:09:51] do everything I can, dear Jesus.
[2:09:54] Hallelujah. To the last day of MY LIFE.
[2:09:57] OH LORD, HELP ME, FATHER. I pray. I may
[2:10:00] not have the strength. I may not have
[2:10:01] the vitality that I had as a younger
[2:10:03] man, but Lord God, I want to give you
[2:10:06] everything that I am. I want to live,
[2:10:08] Lord Jesus, every day of my life for the
[2:10:11] cause of Christ. I'm not here to preach
[2:10:13] about me. Paul said we don't preach
[2:10:16] ourselves, but we preach Christ Jesus.
[2:10:18] I'm not interested in hear about a lot
[2:10:20] of the preachers here in our church.
[2:10:21] This man, that man, tell me how to fight
[2:10:23] the devil. Tell me how to get victory in
[2:10:26] my life. Give me something that I know
[2:10:28] how to face hell. Oh Lord, help us, I
[2:10:30] pray. Anoint the ministers, Lord God, of
[2:10:33] your people. Anoint the men of God in
[2:10:35] this last day like never before with the
[2:10:38] anointing from the throne of God. Give
[2:10:40] them that charge, heavenly father,
[2:10:42] that'll help the people in this hour. We
[2:10:44] need it so desperately, Lord. Oh, we
[2:10:48] worship you, Lord Jesus. We worship you,
[2:10:52] Lord Jesus.
[2:10:54] We bless your holy name tonight, Father.
[2:10:57] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord
[2:11:00] Jesus.
[2:11:02] We need you, Lord. We need you right
[2:11:05] now. Sing it for us by there. And let's
[2:11:07] just sing together. Let's just worship
[2:11:09] him now. Remember the prophet said
[2:11:11] that's the kind of homes that angels can
[2:11:13] visit. homes and lives that are
[2:11:16] consecrated to the Lord. We've
[2:11:18] consecrated this place here to the Lord
[2:11:20] Jesus. We've consecrated our bodies, our
[2:11:23] lives. So that means this is the place
[2:11:25] that the angels of God can visit.
[2:11:28] Hallelujah.
[2:11:29] We worship you, Lord Jesus.
[2:11:32] We worship you, Lord.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
