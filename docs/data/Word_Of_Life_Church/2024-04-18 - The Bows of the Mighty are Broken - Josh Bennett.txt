a youth service at the old church granted all the parents weren't there there's probably like 40 young people there and my platform was uh looked a little different uh but kind of brings back old memories of how things used to be and where I was and I was had kind of given a testimony to a buddy of mine about my life and where I was and I remember when I was a young person it's like I had a little Bott of lighter fluid and I just spray the holy my Holy Ghost out and light it and I was good I was like quick and then it just go away come to church spray it again light it on fire every time and then one day my lighter fluid ran out and I didn't have nothing there then a year ago somebody put a piece of wood down they put that lighter fluid on that piece of wood and lit it then they put another piece of wood on it guy put another piece of wood on it I don't have that hot flash of fire no more I got something that's burning inside of me that's running and it won't never run out there ain't nothing that could ever make that fire burn out every now and then y'all the young people can come in here and y'all will light up every fire in this church y'all don't know how important you

could be why I'm hurting and I told him this doctor probably didn't even know this and I said well last night me and the devil had a little Pow Wow over in the corner of the church and he left battered and bruised and I couldn't hardly walk so I don't know who won but I'm claiming [Music] Victory the past couple weeks I went on a hunt and I was hurting and one morning he's out in Nebraska

heaven heaven eyes [Applause] praise the Lord how wonderful it is for us to be gathered together here tonight want to thank each of you for coming putting forth the effort to be here um we're so grateful for all that has been done to make a make this a special time for the Youth and so appreciate all the work that's going on in the background all of our sisters getting everything ready for the banquet and food preparation and all that sort of thing the ministers that have put forth the effort to study and pray don't we appreciate that with all of our hearts so grateful I appreciate Servants of God that don't um cut a corner just because they're preaching a youth service that they give everything they are to the youths just like they would if it was all adults or if it's a big crowd medium-sized crowd large crowd a real servant of God gives their all it makes no difference how many is there if the Lord Jesus could go to one woman at the well then I don't figure any of us should be too big that we can't so brother Josh did a wonderful job last night and we're going to invite him to come now and just bring to us what the Lord has placed on his heart for us I'm sure you have needs tonight don't you things that you need in your walk with the Lord and we're just believing that God's going to take our brother get him out of the way and remember now a gift is something that God places in an individual's life and it helps them to be able to step aside and let God be able to use that part of himself that he puts in there but it's not operated just by the preacher the preacher studies and he prays and he tries to put it all together as best as he can but it takes the spirit of God to help him and it also takes you it takes you pulling and if you go preach many times I've done it these other Brethren here have as well and the people don't pull and pull oh it's so disappointing and God gives it to you in such a way and the people don't do their part and it just doesn't go over like you know that it could have but we don't want that to be so do we we want it to be that it'll just be above and beyond amen God bless you so I think it's such an important thing for us as as the people of God to be able to realize we we pull now remember a preacher will get a certain thought and God will give him that thought he go to building on that thought working on it working on it it and there'll be always Sidelines there'll be a little Direction this way and one that way and one that way and a real spirit-led man what he will do is he will go down this Lane for just a few minutes if it's no more than two three minutes do you know why he done that because somebody here or there or somebody streaming the service really needed that to be said and that's the kind of man we want to preach to us is it that's right so you remember you pull on the gift of God oh you sound nobody you should should never say that you are somebody you're a part of the body of Christ so if our brother studied in a certain direction tonight and maybe your need lays outside the confines of what he studied just remember the heavenly father can put on his heart and pull him in a direction and he's standing here in bewilderment he cannot understand why he's going down that path sister Rebecca Smith told Carol and I One Time there was a person in brother bram's meeting that had a real need and she was just so touched by that person's need and she began to pray that God would speak through her daddy to that individual's need and God answered her prayer and directed The Prophet to go right toward that person's need tell them you know whatever it was that they was dealing with now here was a a young woman a teenager at the time but God so heard her prayer and she was so concerned and God was concerned about that so maybe you're doing pretty good tonight but maybe you've got a friend that you brought with you or someone that you've talked to even if you've come this way today and you've talked about some of the things you're going through and you just said I need answers I need help well maybe you don't need it tonight but maybe you can pray for that individual and God will direct our brother I believe we're serving that kind of a god don't you amen Justin come saying something for us let's just open our hearts and want ask our brother to come and we've just told him just obey the Lord whatever he feels l in his heart to do if he wants to preach pray for the sick uh offer prayer after the the word has come just whatever we've just come here we've said as y'all ain't got nothing else seem more important to do do you come to the house of God and just see what the Lord will do with us we don't want just this to be another another service we want it to be a monumental visitation of the presence of God God bless you where would I be you only know I'm glad you see through Eyes Of Love a hopeless cake an empty place if not for Grace let's sing it again where would I be you all know I'm glad you see through Eyes Of Love a hopeless case and empty place if not for grace Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound I once was lost but now I'm found I'm a hopeless C an empty place if not for Grace precious Lord take my hand and lead me on and let me stand I'm a whole case an empty place if not for Grace where would I be you all know [Music] for grace Amazing Grace how sweet the [Music] S I'm found hopeless G an empty place if not for gra how many can say Amen to that tonight how many's thankful for the grace of God Amen I I believe Paul said it this way he said I am what I am amen by the grace of God Amen and I believe that we can all say the same thing tonight and and you know I think it's amazing that the Apostle Paul would say he said the life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God Amen I I'm thankful that the life that I Live Now is not um it's not it's not my life it's his life it's not my faith it's his faith amen and it's all by his grace let's just bow our hearts together and if you have a need just lift it up to the throne tonight Lord Jesus we just counted a privilege and an honor to be standing with your children one more time and and Lord we we just appreciate Lord how that the songs have been sung and the atmosphere has been created and Lord an atmosphere to welcome your presence and Lord that's what we desire more than anything Lord we just want to we want to invite you to come and Lord just be in the service this evening but Lord we don't want you to be here as just an onlooker or a recording Angel but Lord we want you to take a part we want you to be the Supreme one Lord we want you to take full control and Lord have your preeminence Lord we just want to yield oursel to you Lord we Just Surrender oursel into your hand I pray God that you would just take the speaker and the hearers of the word and Lord I pray that you would just anoint us Lord anoint lips of clay anoint our ears to hear anoint our hearts to receive Lord I pray that you would just have your way Lord we give you that tonight we give this service over to you Lord I pray that everything that's said and done would be pleasing to you and that Lord it would all bring glory and honor to Your Name Lord because if there's one thing that we desire is that we would lift you up Lord and Lord may this service be like it was on the Mount of transfiguration there Lord when they saw you glorified and Lord Peter got excited and perhaps in his Zeal Lord and his excitement he said let's build a tabernacle for Moses and one for Elijah but Lord when it was all said and done and after the voice had spoke they saw no man saved Christ and Lord that's what we want to have here tonight Lord when it's all said and done Lord I pray that that we would see no man save Jesus Christ and Lord may you be lifted up and Lord we just put you in the highest place tonight Lord we're just Lord we're just surrendering oursel completely now Lord we give it to you in Jesus name amen amen if you take your Bibles this evening we'll turn to the book of 1 Samuel just want to I just want to say uh what a privilege it is once again to be here and U to be a part of these services and appreciate your pastor and um his wife and the church here and the um hospitality and we so we just love each one of you um always um you know I look around sometimes at other ministers and and there's some great ministers here tonight but uh and I always wonder what in the world am I doing here but uh we just pray that the Lord will be able to use us and say something that' be a blessing to somebody and you know a long time a brother told me a long time ago a brother told me he said I was just a young man and just started preaching and hadn't been preaching very long and a brother kind of pulled me to the side and he said brother Josh he said I want to share something with you he said there's a difference in preaching and ministering and he said you need to uh always keep that before you that you're not just there to preach A good sermon but you're there to minister to needs right and um I I I pray that you know I I will always keep that before me and and like brother Donnie said even if if God has to take me off my notes tonight and when I get done and I feel like I made a mess out of it if somebody could be helped then that's what it's really all about amen so 1st Samuel chapter 2 and let's read from the first verse here it's kind of perhaps an odd text but um this is actually Hannah's Prayer of Thanksgiving to God for answering her prayer and giving her a son the Bible says and Hannah prayed and said my heart rejoiceth in the Lord my horn is exalted in the Lord my mouth is enlarged over my enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation there is none holy as the Lord for there is none beside thee neither is there any Rock like our God talk no more so exceeding proudly let not arrogancy come out of your mouth for the Lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weighed the bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbleth are girded with strength I also want to read from the book of 2 Corinthians the 12th chapter SE 2 Corinthians chapter 12 and we'll read from verse 6 and Paul writing here says for though I would desire to Glory I shall not be a fool I believe that what Paul's saying that if I did Glory I would be a fool it would be foolish in other words for me to Glory he said for I will say say the truth but now I forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord thce that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is suff sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities and in reproaches and necessities and persecutions and distresses for Christ's sake for when I'm weak then am I strong amen may God add His blessings as you're seated tonight I'd like to just speak to you for a few minutes this evening on the bows of the mighty are broken and and thinking about this tonight um just getting a lot of the inspiration out of the message that the prophet preached there perfect strength by Perfect weakness and I just been thinking about the the difference between human ability and the power of God because in that message there perfect strength by Perfect weakness brother Brandon would say when we're thinking that we're able to do it he said then God can't use us because we're wanting to do it ourselves see and then on the other side we get these feelings that we think that we're just insufficient and we don't want to do it but then if we would just listen to the call of God that's the very thing that God wants us to get into into that kind of a shape so he can see when we are insufficient in ourselves then we are subjects to yield to God's spirit but see as long as we think that we can do it then we can't do it but when we get to the place where we know that we can't do it and then we just yield ourselves to God and he does it so then if it's I I if it's us trying to do it then we're going to fail but if we'll just yield ourselves to God then God can't fail there's only one thing that God cannot do and that's fail he can do anything else but fail how many believes that's the truth because God cannot fail so see he said as long as we're trying it in ourselves and depending upon our own abilities and so forth then we we we'll do nothing but when we get to the place that where we know that we're nothing then God can use us see the important thing is one of the most important things that we must Master now remember this and especially he says you young preachers and lay members alike there's one thing that we got to master if we expect to fulfill the God's desire in our our life and that is that we have to master the thought of human ability amen I just think that is so powerful because you know brother RM was saying on the one hand you know we get to the place that we think that we can do it he said and when we think we can then then God can't even use you he said but then on the other hand he says we get in a spot that because of our inabilities and you know that we just don't think that you know we have we're not capable of doing it he said then we don't want to do it he said but that's exactly where God wants you to get he said because then you can yield to him see amen I think that's so powerful and brother BR would even talk about Moses there's a lot of different ones in the Bible that he would uh uh you know Bible characters that he would use there in that message but he spoke about Moses and and in another message there in uh Paul a prisoner brother BR talks about Moses and all of his training he said see and today with all of our training making Bishops and so forth and great High Ambitions and and what will we do he said our Ambitions become just about like Moses see see because before God uh uh before he could get the man in his hand he had to strip him of his Ambitions just just about like uh Moses see our Ambitions are just like his and but before God could get Moses in his hand the first thing he had to do is strip him of all his train ring seat amen he had to go out there and see Moses went out brother BR said and he did deliver he killed one Egyptian that's all he accomplished on his own that's all he got done Moses went out and killed one Egyptian buried him in the sand and then he went running for his life that's what Moses could do with his own ability see amen so God is allowing this to to for us to and I think it's amazing that that these things are recorded in the Bible because I want to tell you you know men wrote this Bible they were scribes but they were not the author and I can prove that to you because men like Moses that wrote the Old Testament he had to include in there his own failures ain't that amazing amen when Moses was writing that he had to put his own failures right in the scripture because listen friends this Bible was never wrote to glorify man it was wrote to glorify God Amen and God included all the failures of men and the failures of Moses and the failures of Abraham and all the prophets amen and all their amen where they come up short God had it recorded right in the scripture Amen to show us that man's ability is never going to be enough amen a human ability is never going to be enough and and so brother R said that God Amen took Moses on the backside of the desert and and he had to get all that training out of and now the prophet of God said in God hiding himself in Simplicity he said notice he said he had him trained in in the worldly wisdom down there in Egypt amen and he and he had him trained so that he could fail to show that it isn't wisdom that will ever that that we will ever be delivered by see It'll be by faith that we'll be delivered so he let him go down there and get such an education until he could even teach the Egyptians wisdom and Moses took the high schooling and such great education amen till he could even teach the genius amen God let him get that way so he could display himself in humility to show that wisdom has nothing to do with it see Moses miserably failed in his genius and he let him get that way for his purpose that he would fail and he did fail amen and to show that it's not by power and it's not by might it's not by the wisdom of Egypt it's not by the wisdom of our schools amen it's not by the power of our seminaries it's not by the amounts of our organization amen it's not by the power of our scholarly teaching but it's by my spirit saith God hallelujah amen his wisdom was vanished in out his in but when he met God in the burning bush Hallelujah he took off his shoes and humbled himself amen he forgot about all his wisdom and listen friend brother R said what Moses lacked amen the burning bush had amen and when he went down there he went amen down into the desert of failure amen but when he met God in the form of a burning bush amen God Amen turned that failure around amen and send him back to Egypt a one man of invasion to the greatest country with the greatest army and the greatest power of that day amen an old man with a crooked stick in his hand and he went down there to take over is that right amen and brother Brown said God allowed it to happen to prove see that wisdom and training and knowledge and all these great things would never be enough right and he he allowed uh H uh Moses to become a failure and the prophet said to show that it's not by power it's not by might but by my spirit sayith the Lord that's Zechariah 4 Zechariah 4:1 and the Bible says and the angel that taught with me came again and wake me as a man that is waken out of his sleep and he saith unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked looked and behold a Candlestick allive gold with a bow upon the top of it and his seven lamps there on and seven pipes and seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and the two olive trees bite one on the right side of the bowl and the other on the left side thereof and so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord and then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord and then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts brother Brown would picked that up in the church age book and he said here's another lamp of pure gold it's Burning Brightly because it has plenty of oil which is which is getting from the two olive trees which stand on either side the two the two trees here represent the Old and New Testament and the and of course the old types the Holy Ghost who alone can give the light of God to to the people the angel who spoke to Zachariah was as much as saying this this is what you see means amen the church cannot accomplish anything of its own might or power but only by the Holy Ghost amen and let me just say this tonight amen that is still true amen we cannot accomplish nothing listen friend even in this service tonight amen nothing will be accomplished except amen the spirit of God Amen would come and do the work amen amen listen friends it doesn't matter what amen we're trying to achieve or do and even brother B saying th this is what it means amen that the church the church can do nothing apart from the spirit of God or the Holy Ghost brother brenon would even say in the message Oneness he said God said not by power not by might not by spirit amen amen sayith the Lord he said that's how I'll unite my church it won't be by organization it will not be by education it will not be by theologians but by my spirit sayith the Lord I'll bring my sheep together he goes on in another message there taking size with Jesus he said because the people was predestinated to eternal life they're going to find it that's all all that the father has given me will come and all that comes to me I'll give them eternal life and raise them up at the last day and they'll not be one of them lost amen I'm holding right to that the prophet said it's not by works it's not by Deeds it's not by power it's not by might but by my spirit sayith God it's not what I done it's not what I am or what I will be but what he is and I am in him and whatever he is I'm a part of him I'm saved because I'm a part of him and he is God and I'm a part of him and being his son that's right so it ain't what I done or not what I will do it's what he's already done and that's what I'm trusting in right there how many of you are trusting in the same thing amen Isaiah 28:5 amen the prophet WR or says this in that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a Crown of Glory and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people and for a spirit of judgment to him that Seth in judgment and for strength to them that turn the the battle to the gate brother bam picks that up and the and he says it uh about that scripture he said that to the him that who is standing for him and with him this great spirit the Holy Spirit that's prophesied will be the strength of him that stands at the gate in the battle see he is our strength and we rely upon him not upon culture not upon education not upon the things of the world not by power not by might but by my spirit say the Lord see the church rest solemnly in that he will be the strength of him that stands in the gate at the Battle amen it won't be the theological background it's not the denomination but the Holy Ghost will be his strength and he'll be the one that'll stand at the gate he'll rely upon the strength of the Holy Spirit to turn the alien away and I say this tonight that's what I'm relying on tonight listen I ain't got a lot of Education I ain't got no ability amen but I tell you one thing amen I have this in my life amen that I have the Holy Ghost amen and I found this is amen that the spirit of God is my joy it's my peace it's the strength Hallelujah like I preached last night I'm not holding on to him he is holding on to me and I found this that when you get in the battle amen that's what'll keep you amen that's what'll Hold You In the Heat of the battle listen friends I'm telling you this amen determination won't do it peer pressure won't do it amen uh H uh you know preacher religion won't do it amen just church membership won't do it because there's going to be times your preacher ain't there there's plenty of times you ain't in church there's plenty of times you ain't around your parents but brother sister if you ever get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you get the spirit of God down in your heart amen when you're weak he's strong Hallelujah and when you have no ability to stand amen he's still strong he'll keep you in the hour of Temptation he'll be your strength in the battle that's why Paul would say it this way in Philippians 4:13 I can do all things amen how many believes that tonight say well brother I can't do nothing you're exactly right amen within yourself we can't do nothing amen but he said I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me but I want to say this tonight but without him see without the Lord right we are helpless and hopeless and I'm just going to say this on your own friends and I I I'm not trying to this is not a service to beat you down but I I want you to understand something though within your own selves with your own abilities you're no match for Satan and and he's been dealing with people for for thousands of years now he has studied you know personalities and personality traits and genealogy and certain strains that are passed down and he's he knows exactly uh where the you know the buttons to push and exactly where to attack you at and amen he'll stand back and study you like a like an opponent and and he'll know exactly where to hit you and you on your own are are no match for him is that right amen and I'm telling you this tonight the only hope that we have amen is is that we got to get the Overcomer in us because the Bible says that he has overcome amen and and and once you get the Overcomer in you then you can have this testimony greater is he that is within me than he that's in the world Amen and then you realize it ain't me amen it's not me that's overcoming it's not me it's not my power it's not my might it's not my ability but greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world the prophet of God said greater is he that is in me than that overcoming sin greater is he that's in me amen than that than that uh sickness or amen whatever it is that you're facing tonight you believe that you see but without him that's What Makes You Different right cuz you know it's let's just take Israel you put God on one side in other words you separate God from from from Israel and Israel is just like anybody else can I just read a quote to you brother BR said you see the one difference between Israel and the rest of the Nations was God and by the way God didn't choose them because they were the greatest or because they were the strongest in another as a matter of fact when God chose them they were nothing he said I found you in a field in your own blood amen you are nothing but I picked you up and cleaned you up and washed you up listen friends amen God didn't choose them because they were great amen he chose them because he loved them by predestination and I say this tonight he didn't choose you either because you were great and he didn't choose you because of your last name and he didn't choose you because of your ability Hallelujah and I don't care how much of a failure are you are or feel like you are or what your past is tonight or the family you come out of or the mess that you're in amen the god that picked up Israel can pick you up Hallelujah when it come to the Gentiles he said I chose you a people that was not even a people and I'll raise you up for my name's sake Hallelujah do you believe it but brother R said the only difference between Israel and the rest of the Nations was God right you put God on one side and Israel was just like any other Nation when Samson cut off his hair he was like any other man you put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God's name and attached to it the world and the church are of the same lump just like Jacob and Esau was of the same parents but the spirit of God is what makes the difference you know I I I I like brother Donnie said sometimes you go on side roads this is a side road but you know I'm always amazed at this cuz Israel when they come to Samuel they said we want a king and and and the reason why they wanted a king is because they wanted to be like other nations right Oh my he said we want somebody to go before us in battle we want a man to go before us in battle we we we would you know God was leading them and God had been going before them they had the greatest General that they that ever was or ever will be he never lost a battle amen but Israel amen under that kind of leadership says you know they got to looking at other nations and what other people and they said you know we want to be like them we want a man to go before us in battle and God said okay you want to be like everybody else then go ahead and be like everybody else but what they didn't realize amen as soon as they become like other nations that's exactly what they was going to be and they was going to lose battles and they was going to be listen re they were going to be oh yes sir amen if you want to be like everybody else God to let you be like everybody else and you'll be depressed and and discouraged and amen you say well we get depressed too amen sure we do and we get sick and we have down days and bad days and all kind of problems but when we're down we got a God that we can turn to and when we're sick we got a Healer hallelujah amen and when we're depressed we got a deliverer Hallelujah I want you to know something tonight I don't want to be like everybody else God made us different and I say let's be different Hallelujah he caught us out he separated us I say this tonight we ought to dress different we ought to talk different we ought to walk different we ought to live different our preaching ought to be different our singing ought to be different our worship ought to be different Hallelujah because God made us to be different but what separates us from every other church is not the pictures we got on the wall come on Friends what separates us from every other church is not you know necessarily that we got more gifted minister or or or greater musicians or or better uh singers or come on friends I think we got the best of the best but I'm telling you what makes us different is the spirit of God what makes us different is that the Holy Ghost is here what makes us different is that God's presence is with us amen that's what said amen that's what made Samson different Amen brother Bram said perfect strength by Perfect weakness again he said here's something to console us here's something that encourages us he said out of weakness and humility God chooses people to build his kingdom out of it out of that if we ever get to heaven amen if we ever stand in the presence of God with his church we'll stand with a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and cast out by the world a bunch of know it nothings I love this message I love how brother Braham could say things he said God don't need a bunch of know- at- all he needs some know it nothings amen God is looking for I don't know about the rest of y'all but that that encourages me brother Jackie amen because you know sometimes you get to think and well you know if I just had a greater understanding or if I just you know or if you ain't careful you know I know what it is I'm a preacher so you know sometimes you start thinking well if I could preach like that brother if I could sing like that brother and I know you're going through the same thing amen but I tell you this amen we ain't God didn't call us to compare ourselves with one another amen listen friends that's not what God is looking for amen he's looking for somebody not a know it all but a know at nothing and somebody say oh God I don't know how you could ever use me I don't know what you could ever get out of my life amen but I tell you what everything I have all that I am amen I ain't nothing but I give all of my nothingness into your hands and whatever you can do in my life I Surrender my life to you yes sir the Bible says in Hebrews 11:32 what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson of jethi and David and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stop the mouth of lons quench the violence of Fire escaped the edge of the sword and out of weakness were made strong wax violent in in in in in fight turn to flight the armies of the aliens listen friends you know who he's talking about here the heroes of the faith right right the heroes of your Bible he said they amen these Heroes that he's talking about out of weakness were made strong brother Brown said they actually had to get weak before they could ever get be strong amen and he begins to name some of them I just going to take maybe one or two but probably one because I've already run out of time amen but but he mentioned Samson there and I got to thinking about Samson and how that he was you know such a great uh a warrior in the scripture and such a great man and had all these great victories you know brother Bram said you know that somebody dra a picture of him he said he said man his shoulders was so big he said I don't even see how the guy could even stand on the platform he has such a h you know such a big shoulders and and and and muscles he said he said there wouldn't be no mystery in that he said see there wouldn't be no mystery in that how he could amen take and tear a line apart or pick up the gates and walk up on the hill with it or something like that there wouldn't be no mystery in that he said but I think he was a little bitty curly-headed shrimp about like that a little mama's boy little curls hanging down amen but what where was the thing was see they couldn't understand how he could take the Jawbone of a mule amen and and just beat them Philistines and their helmets about an inch or half thick and and what was it it was a hidden power Amen brother BR said it wasn't amen the muscles in his arms no it was the it was at the power of God Came Upon him I I again I tell I just love the message cuz the message brother B talks about David being a a little Ruddy guy and he he and then brother Brown talk about Samson being a little curly-headed shrimp and you know I thought praise God Amen cuz I you know I wish I was 6' 10 too and amen maybe packing about 200 lb right now amen but I tell you God didn't make me that way amen but I tell you what when I begin to read about Samson I thought I begin to find out God don't need no big man he's a big God I knew I'd get a good solid amen out of Joe Adams it really don't matter how big or small you are because it ain't the power it's not the the strength of that was in Samson's arm brother B said it was a hidden power right it was a hidden power he said and that's what the church today you got a hidden power something that fortifies what is it it's the word amen the manifestation of God's grace in his people amen that's the hidden power listen friends I'm telling you the world you're a mystery to the world tonight I I I'm just going to speak to you young people tonight you're a mystery to the world I guarantee you you're a mystery in your school if you go to school or on your job or wherever you go and people look at you amen and listen to the pressures of this age and amen all the trends and all the Fashions and all the Styles and and all the things that amen and you got and we got young girls amen that are letting their hair grow and they're dressed in modest apparel amen we got we still got some boys around this message that actually look like boys and dress like boys and amen and they know what side of the bed they woke up on come on friends and the world looks at you and that's a great mystery how are you standing in this age how are you maintaining a testimony in the middle of Satan's Eden they don't know how you're doing it amen and they're trying to figure it out well I just don't well maybe it's a church or or maybe it's a you know they raising or maybe it's and all that's got something to do with it but friends amen The Secret of it is a hidden power hallelujah it's something down on the inside of the inside it's called the Holy Ghost Hallelujah well I know amen some people are ashamed to say that word anymore but you looking at one preacher I am not ashamed to be identified with with the Holy Ghost with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the with the power Hallelujah of the spirit of God that's living within an individual I tell you R it's overcoming power Hallelujah I say this it's not by might it's not by power it's by my spirit sayeth the Lord [Applause] that was a secret of of Samson's Victory and that's what Delilah was trying to find the Bible says in judges 16 and4 and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman there's a great opportunity opportunity right here for me to preach to Young people but I'll be careful he loved a woman whose name was Delilah and the Lords of the Philistines came unto her and said unto her entice him and see wherein his great strength Li and by what means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him and we will give thee every one of us 1100 pieces of silver and Delilah said to Samson tell me I pray thee where in thy great strength lith and wherewith thou thou mest be bound to afflict thee and Samson begin to tell her well you know if you bind me with ropes that have never been used or you know and there was several different things that he said and or put a pen in my hair and all these kind of things and every time she would you know she would do what Samson said and then she would come Samson the fistings are and he'd rise and Shake himself and a and she would just go back and press upon him with her words brother Brown said that was Delilah's motive was to find his power that's where she could wreck him after she found his power and that's what the devil is trying to do with the church is to find the secret of the power is that right and then brother Brown would begin to say how that the Philistines would come and there would come a message and and he would rise up and brother Brown would even type that with the ages he said the church seemed to be bound there after the uh you know after the early church come and after the N counsel the church seemed to be bound he said but a message come the fistings are upon the and it rose up and shook itself and here comes Luther with justification then it was bound again he said but it rose up and shook itself and here come Wesley amen with say and he typed it down through the church like that amen but but watch but she just continued to press upon her the Bible says in the 16th verse there and it come to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his Soul was vexed unto death that he told her all his heart and said unto her there has not come a razor upon my head for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb and if I be shaven then my strength will be will go from me and I shall become weak and be like and be like any other man did you hear what Samson's own testimony amen if you cut my hair off amen which was a representation of his Covenant with God God Amen he said I will be like any other man brother Brown said amen what caused it am me what was the cause of Samson's fall he let a woman lure him away from the promise of God and that's exactly we all know that he had Seven Locks he was born his birth path was to be a Nazarite an odd fell to the Lord but you see he let this woman lure him until she shaved his oddness off and that's the the same thing that's happened to the church amen you were born to Be A peculiar people a holy nation a royal priesthood but what has happened you let the world shave off your peculiar until you become one of them listen friends I say this tonight amen let amen I refuse to let the world shave off our peculiar you say well amen we look strange to the world you ought to well we stand out you ought to well we look OD you ought to amen because you are called out a chosen generation a pecular your people we ought to be OD to the world brother say we're odd boss and the devil is trying to find the secret of your power and I'm telling you the prophet of God is standing right here and preaching to us that when you lose that and we allow Satan to shave off the thing that makes us different you'll lose the [Applause] power because the spirit of God left him and he was like any other man and watch this in the 19th verse and she made him to sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off the Seven Locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength had went from him and she said the Philistines be upon thee Samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said I will go out as other times before and shake myself and he was not amen he wish not that the Lord was departed from him but the Philistines took him and put his eyes out and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with feathers of brass and he did grind in the prison house and the Lord's in verse 23 and the Lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice to deeon their God and to Rejoice for they said our God ha delivered Samson our enemy into our hand and when the people saw him they praised their God for they said our God had delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us and it came to pass that when their hearts were Merry and they said and they said call for Samson that they that he may make us Sport and they call for Samson out of the house of prison and he made them Sport and they set him between the pillars listen friends Amen brother brother Brown said look at this scene he said they had actually gathered themselves together to celebrate the victory over Jehovah's servant why because he had lost the thing that made him different brother R said they had him doing tricks to entertain them and that's just about the way it's got instead of the Holy Spirit Come on is all right listen brother Donnie said just obey the Lord so that's what I'm going to do tonight because I want to tell you when the spirit of God leaves a church church will become entertainment and when the spirit of God leads a preacher a preacher will become an Entertainer come on friends and I tell you what it'll come it'll become a laughing stock to the world Amen and that's exactly what they were doing to Samson they were literally making fun of him and making sport of him and laughing at him and and this great man of God that had once stood and killed a thousand with a Jawbone amen that would ripped a line apart amen all all these great victories just think about that amen because he lost the thing that made him different he become an Entertainer he just become their entertainment I say oh God help us Amen brother B said oh we got we got our great G togethers we have our great meetings that we call it and worldly revivals and so forth full of all these things and the ma the man with a message of the hour and so and so and so and so and so we have all that but where is God see that's the thing that we're looking for where is God oh we could have a great big piece of scholarly Showmanship and somebody with enough education and all these things and and election are and I don't even know what that means put all the words together and stand and perfectly straight and say Amen just exactly right amen and all these things but where is God Amen and listen friends I'm not trying to say I'm not preaching against the message or or message people so don't misunderstand me but I'm telling you this amen we can have meetings upon meetings and I believe in meetings and thank God for meetings and thank God how many of you young people are thankful for youth camps and youth services and and and things like this that are going on Amen even this weekend amen we're so thankful for that amen listen friend I wish I'd have been a part of that when I was your age amen but I'm telling you this amen if God is not there amen then that don't amount to a whole lot amen that might be good for a get together amen for acquaintances and so forth amen but if you really want to see a change in your life Hallelujah if we really want to see somebody delivered that takes the spirit of God that'll take the presence of God and I don't know about the rest of y'all but I just want to lift my voice and lift my hands and say oh God come in these Services come in every meeting let the spirit of God be poured out let the Holy Ghost have his way brother brandham goes on to say he says we got a lot of that today but it's too bad he said but notice it didn't bring back the spirit of God and see the thing about it is is the people are not willing to pay the price he said I believe that God just Remains the Same as he ever was how many of you believe that right but the thing of it is the people has got so wound up in the world and the world in them till they just got enough religion to make them miserable come on and not enough to really turn loose to God and give their whole heart to him oh get enough just to say well I go to church certainly I enjoyed the good singing and the Clapping of the hands well I love that too see amen but the prophet God that didn't bring the spirit of God back and Samson had to get to a place of such desperation until he was willing to die with his [Applause] enemy he said we find out Samson prayed right he said Lord let me die with my enemy die to the enemy that that that had got him that way and if there's anything that people ought to pray for tonight and we see the thing that's been done is is getting away from the Bible and getting to Crees and so forth then die to that thing and get out of it see just die to it Samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of God back again and there's a price to be paid for it but today people don't seem to do do it see oh we hear Revival sure yes we have denominational Revival we got more members and all things like that but look at the morals is constantly decaying and look how further and further away from God they're getting all the time and getting away from the word but Samson knew one thing and I wonder if the church realizes that today he knew that in his backslid condition he could not meet the challenge of the hour listen I just want to say this tonight as far as a man Samson was just as much man as he ever was apart from his eyes being out taken out apart from him being blind he was just as as far as human ability he was just as much man as he ever was he had the same arms same legs same muscles he ever had as far as a man you see he was just the same but he knew I cannot meet the challenge in the condition that I'm in amen and Samson stood there stripped of his power stripped of his power but do you know there was something that the Philistines didn't notice that while Samson was standing there thinking all this over come on come on his hair begin to grow out again Hallelujah and listen friends while they were standing there looking at that powerless man amen and they were making sport of him and amen and what he had become amen they forgot to watch amen they forgot to watch and brother BR said what they didn't see was them tears running out of them dry sockets amen where the eyeballs used to be what they didn't see amen what they didn't see was his lips moving a prayer of repentance hallelujah what they didn't realize amen amen listen for oh they said all they saw was an old blind man a defeated enemy a poweress church I'm church I'm telling you amen the devil might be looking at us tonight and the devil might be laughing at us right now and he said oh look they've lost their power they've lost their anointing the message is on the way down amen oh yes sir and the devil's looking at look at that all amen oh yes sir it's a defeated enemy but what the devil don't see tonight is there's a new shock of hair that's going out Hallelujah and while Samson was in prison his hair begin to grow Hallelujah and the prophet of God said all of a sudden he begin to feel something on his shoulder and and S begin to realize wait a minute I might be a blind man but the secret of my power was never in my eyes I might be weak but the secret of my power was never in my arm arms Hallelujah I might be a slave amen I might listen I might be a prisoner but the secret of my power come from within and he begin to fill them Seven Locks and he begin to realize I'm a Nazarite un God I was chosen to destroy this enemy Hallelujah and something in his heart heart begin to cry out is there a possibility just once more just once more just one more time could I see the power of God and brother BR said Samson wanted to see God's glory manifested more than he loved his own life he wanted to see amen the power of God return back more than his own life he was willing to die for it oh is there any senses in this building tonight if you get to war to see the power of God more than your own life and you're willing to give Pride Amen to sacrifice Pride or reputation Hallelujah and you ain't worried about what your neighbor thinks or the girl sitting beside you or the boy sitting beside you amen but all you know is I got to feel that power one more time Hallelujah and the prop of God said that God is raising a Samson up for that last great kill and while Samson was in prison amen he said oh here's the only hope that I have that while Simpson is in prison a new shock of hair is growing out there's a new crop that's oh come on church I believe I'm looking at some of them tonight I believe I'm looking at some of tonight a new crop while the devil's been standing about standing back amen rejoicing over his victory a new crop has been growing and God is raising up some young people in this message I ain't going to leave the old people out either he still got some calebs around here too Hallelujah and Caleb even when he was 80 years old Hallelujah L it was a new generation that went in and took the the land and you are that new generation that God is raising up to go and possess the promise but brother Jackie you're a Caleb Hallelujah you're a Caleb that's standing true to Joshua in this hour and Caleb said listen I'm just as strong now as I was then and he pulled his boots on jerked his sword out and said said give me my Mountain Hallelujah I'm telling you tonight Church the devil forgot to watch and while the devil's been rejoicing over his victories amen because he's had people bound and he's had people walk away and people have backslid and some have turned and they built websites and said the message is false and the devil's been rejoicing but he forgot to watch he forgot to notice these young people going to the altar there's backsliders being restored there's people crying out to God there's Simpsons rising up and I want to tell you tonight it's not just a possibility it's a promise Hallelujah and I say just once more Lord just once more [Applause] Hallelujah there a musicians come tonight Hall the prophet of God said he said the case is with us as we stand our feet listen to me because this is powerful on I wanted to get into Gideon a little while because Israel got in such a condition and backlit on God and the enemy come in and took over and God sent him a prophet and brother Brown said and Gideon was out there threshing wheat and he said the message of the Prophet was running through his heart but brother Daryl he the question he has was if God be for us and where's all the Miracles come on but an angel met him there you know what that angel told him he said thou Mighty Man of Valor you know what brother Brown said he said that that message from the angel was very surprising to Gideon he said cuz he didn't know he was a mighty man of Valor he said it maybe it's surprising to you he said but you're Mighty Man of Valor too and the prophet of God but you know what's amazing to me because as as you go on down through the scripture there and and and and the angel begins to give him his commission and call him to defeat the enemy Gideon says listen my family's poor and I'm the least in my father's house but you know what God didn't accept his excuse he just looked at him and said have I not called thee go in this thy might and you'll defeat the minites as one man because God never did need a great man listen when Jesse went down to the house of or I'm sorry when Samuel went down to the house of Jesse and he was looking for a king for Israel you know even Jesse said hey I know exactly who it is I'll go ahead and get him he called his eldest son I mean he looked like a king and you know conducted himself that way and all the kind he had all the traits character traits and and Samuel let him said no he that ain't him and then he called the next one he he said no he's he it's not him either he got went all the way down through seven sons and none of them was God's anointed and to the place even the prophet said you got any more yeah we got a little we got I got a little boy out there watching the Sheep go fetch him and when he brought Little David up to in the eyes of that Prophet fell on that little that little Shepherd boy he just took the Horn of the anointing oil poured it out over David's head he was the least in his father's house but he was chosen of God and God said I called you out of the sheep coat amen I called you out of the field I listen David you was nothing when I found you and I made you the king of Israel and David was one of the greatest kings ever was amen because of that very reason that God gave him his training out there in the field with a bunch of stinking sheep listen friends amen that's exactly how God ch amen the the the Bible says that man looks on the outward appearance but God is looking at the heart and that's what God is looking at you tonight and he's saying you're a mighty man of Valor and you your estimation of yourself might I'm the least in my father's house I'm the littlest in the church I have the least to offer amen but listen friends God is saying this amen my strength is made perfect in your [Applause] [Music] weakness let the bows of the Mighty Men be broken am and he that stumbleth be GED with strength I tell you what brother Braham said he said we think that we're too weak he said but really we're too strong see and and and I'm closing with this young people but I'm from my heart I'm speaking to you you might be here tonight and you might think I'm too weak or I don't have the ability or I ain't got nothing to offer God or I don't know exactly how you're feeling or what your battle is but a prophet said see you feel like you're too weak but really you're too strong he said because you're too strong to surrender yourself and yield yourself to God God don't need your ability he just needs you to surrender good how many of you will just want to lift your hand and say I surrender everything to you lord lord Jesus Lord I pray that you just take these few words tonight and broke up sermon as it may be and I feel like I made a mess out of it but God somehow made the Holy Spirit just come Lord I pray that you would just walk up and down the Avenues of deal with the hearts of these young people here tonight and maybe even an older person may be [Music] here Lord I want to say tonight from my heart I want I desire more than anything a refilling a refreshing from your presence oh God lord I pray that you'd give us baptism after baptism Revelation upon Revelation oh God we love the emotion and we love that to feel you and all those things but Lord I'm praying for more than that I don't want to just feel a feel good oh God I want your spirit to drop down on the inside of the inside and change me Lord I pray that you would just deal with these Hearts here tonight maybe I'm looking at some samsons or maybe there's a Gideon here tonight maybe there's a little girl that would be like that little girl that was taken captive in the Bible and become a WI witness and begin to testify to non the leop and it would be through her testimony that non would be healed of his leprosy and though her name was never written down lord her testimony was recorded in scripture and here we are thousands and thousands of years later still talking about it Lord maybe there's a Mary in here tonight that would just want to fall at the feet of Jesus just so give themselves to you Lord pour out everything they have and anoint your feet wash your feet with the tears of their eyes where your Prophet said the the only water that was worthy to wash your feet was tears of repentance Lord I believe these people here want Revival but God the only way a true Revival could come is first there's got to be a true repentance and I say Lord let it start with me Lord if there's anything I've done if there's anything Lord that's cause your spirit to leave me or if I've allowed anything Lord to come to shave off my peculiar oh God I Repent of it tonight and I say Lord let them let the let the hair grow again let me feel that anointing oh God let me recognize and re remember who I [Music] am Grant it tonight Lord Jesus have your way in the remainder of this service they're getting ready to sing I just say this tonight brother Brandon when he's coming down to the end of that sermon he begins to talk about a little widow woman over in Israel [Music] her husband had died and she had become a debor and the creditors would come and take her sons away and she didn't have nothing in her house just a little bit of oil the Prophet come and he said you got any any any vessels empty vessels then he begin to instruct your go and Bor from your neighbors get get get as many empty vessels as you can get and take that oil and begin to pour it out and brother Brown takes that and he says see what God is looking for in this hour is empty vessels and he said many times the reason why God can't fill us is we're already full but I was reading another place brother Brown said but God made you in such a way that you could empty out and I said oh thank you Jesus if I'm too full of something tonight that God can't fill me I want to empty out tonight and God made you in a way that you could empty out so I invite you young people tonight empty yourself become an empty vessel and allow God to fill you tonight the prophet said he's looking for empty vessels to shake the world is there anybody want to just lift your hand and say Lord let me be one of them and if you need to empty out tonight the altar is open you can do it at your seat just do whatever you got to do to empty yourself and say Lord come and fill me tonight [Music] amen I give myself away so you can use me I Give Myself Away

was actually there the people were in the back of the building waving their hands trying to get brother brandham to stop preaching they wanted him to hush they was moving dishes making all kinds of noise and he kept right on going aren't you glad he did aren't you glad he did you'd never even know that that was going on cuz God had a a message called The Rapture that needed to be preached he never preached it like that anywhere else around the world but he faced right through that opposition that'd be pretty distracting wouldn't it Brothers that'd be pretty distracting for people standing back there in the back waving their hands making noises with dishes and all that he just kept right on going thank God for a man thank God for a man that we'll be able to do it I believe we got men of the same caliber today amen praise the Lord God bless you we're so honored to have each of you that are here probably be more coming in tomorrow and for the banquet and we're just trusting that the

our hearts together Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for the anointing that we feel in this building tonight Lord it goes beyond just emotion or sensation Lord it moves into that channel that Lord your Prophet talked about Lord that we're Messiah dear God we're not operating by the five inner outer senses but Lord we're operating by that super sense and Lord as your word has come forth tonight in power and demonstration Lord We Believe by that super sense that all things are possible Lord I pray tonight as we prepare to go our separate ways Lord May these things not just be another sermon Lord may we not just leave and say what a good message that was but Lord may we begin to feed up on these things until the word we heard tonight takes all the human ability out and Lord there's no way we can take that Rapture that we've been Lord just thinking about and speaking about here tonight but Lord we know that greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world and Lord we're so thankful tonight that your Prophet did not tell us that it was rapturing works but he said it's rapturing Grace and rapturing Faith and Lord that has been spoken now there's a people in position
