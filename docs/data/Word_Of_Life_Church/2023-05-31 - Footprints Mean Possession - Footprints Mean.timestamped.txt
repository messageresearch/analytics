[42:28] he was on the cross

[42:46] [Music]
[42:48] oh yes and he loves me
[42:55] Mercy

[43:30] I was

[43:36] oh I'm so glad
[43:39] he knew

[45:13] [Applause]
[45:27] cross
[45:28] but before the cross
[45:31] regardless man
[45:33] I'm so grateful
[45:36] I'm glad it's not left up to uh
[45:39] our choice
[45:41] our determination our ability
[45:45] our strength
[45:47] I'm probably looking tonight at some of
[45:49] the weakest human beings
[45:51] that have ever lived through time
[45:55] approximately eight billion people in
[45:58] the face of the Earth
[46:00] at least several hundred of the weakest
[46:02] ones that's ever lived is right here
[46:03] tonight okay
[46:05] and I'm number one
[46:08] I said I would never say that well you
[46:10] won't say you're strong and stubborn and
[46:12] bullheaded no I'd rather say I'm weak
[46:14] because Paul said whenever I'm weak then
[46:17] I'm strong
[46:18] amen I'm so grateful for his grace and
[46:21] mercy to us tonight aren't you I heard
[46:24] y'all had an awesome time here this
[46:26] weekend
[46:28] are you so Lord
[46:30] [Music]
[46:35] but I figured we might as well have
[46:37] another one tonight
[46:40] we're already here
[46:45] no doubt we have needs don't we desires
[46:48] things we need from the Lord so we
[46:49] believe that he certainly
[46:51] mindful of us to come and and help us
[46:54] and be able to speak to us and
[46:57] I'm sure most of you know it already but
[46:59] the Lord did a wonderful thing right
[47:01] here last Wednesday night
[47:03] Mr Ruth Garland
[47:06] deaths come knocking and life said no
[47:09] way
[47:16] amen
[47:18] I'll tell you one thing if death ever
[47:19] comes prematurely knocking on my door
[47:22] and I'm going to church I'd sure like to
[47:24] make sure they believe he's a
[47:25] resurrection in life at that church
[47:28] I'd sure like to make sure that some men
[47:30] of God there that can call death's hand
[47:32] and say Hey you get back where you
[47:34] belong
[47:36] I believe it's the same don't you
[47:39] Genesis 13 14.
[47:42] Genesis Chapter 13 Verse 14.
[47:49] our setting
[47:50] tonight and in this chapter in the book
[47:54] of Genesis
[47:57] it's after quite a difficult time
[48:00] for Abram
[48:03] he has experienced a great traumatic
[48:06] thing
[48:08] his nephew lot is left with him and been
[48:10] out with him now for quite some time
[48:13] but all along there was little things
[48:16] that was there
[48:17] and they had come to a spot to where the
[48:20] herdsmen were arguing fussing debating
[48:22] and so on
[48:23] and finally Abraham tells a lot
[48:28] you look this way you looked at which
[48:30] whichever way you want I'll go the
[48:32] opposite direction you go north I'll go
[48:34] south you go east Talca West
[48:37] now when you know the setting of The
[48:39] protocol of that day Abraham Abram his
[48:41] name is still yet now he was the Elder
[48:45] so he would have been the patriarch of
[48:48] the family he had the right
[48:51] to tell lot
[48:53] which way to go
[48:55] a lot you go there and don't you cross
[48:58] some boundaries or you go there or you
[49:01] go there wherever Abram said for him to
[49:04] go he would have been obligated by the
[49:06] law to go there
[49:09] but I want you to notice the difference
[49:10] between a foolish virgin and a bride
[49:13] type
[49:15] Abram looks in a total different way you
[49:19] see eternal life is living for others
[49:21] and even though Abraham didn't have it
[49:22] in his soul yet he had the deposit and
[49:26] there was something that was there so
[49:29] the Bible tells us that lot lifted up
[49:33] his eyes
[49:34] I keep that in mind as we read this
[49:36] first verse
[49:38] and the Lord said unto Abram
[49:41] after that lot was separated from him
[49:47] lift up now
[49:49] thine eyes
[49:51] okay so in chapter 12
[49:54] the Bible tells us that lot lifted up
[49:57] his eyes
[50:00] not direction from God
[50:02] but Abraham waited to lift his eyes
[50:05] until God told him to
[50:08] you see when you see selfishness man
[50:11] woman boy or girl a person's life is all
[50:14] about themself everything is about them
[50:17] that's a terrible sign of a foolish
[50:19] virgin
[50:20] or to say the least a seed of God that's
[50:23] not yet been born again
[50:25] God hates selfishness
[50:27] it's the very epitome of the heart of
[50:29] Satan is selfishness
[50:32] so lot lifted up his eyes Abraham
[50:35] doesn't now this is more than just
[50:37] raising your head but lifting up their
[50:40] eyes was a sign of a claim
[50:44] a possession
[50:45] so when lot lifted his eyes it was more
[50:48] than just his head been down and raising
[50:50] it up but it was a claim on something
[50:53] now notice the Lord said unto Abram
[50:55] after that lot was separated from him
[50:57] lift up now
[51:01] now
[51:03] not when you want to Lord
[51:05] not when you want to Abram but when I
[51:08] tell you to now lot may have come back
[51:09] and said well I felt led to do this or
[51:12] that or the other it's incredible to me
[51:15] how many people feel led in the crazy
[51:17] stuff they feel led to do
[51:19] but you don't want a real child of God
[51:21] always checks what they feel led to do
[51:23] but what the word says first
[51:26] and the word will never the spirit of
[51:28] God will never lead you or I outside the
[51:31] confines of the word never don't never
[51:33] blame that on God
[51:34] lift up now thine eyes and look
[51:38] wow this is quite simple in it but look
[51:40] at the commands now
[51:42] now what's what's going to follow his
[51:45] obedience lift up your eyes now is the
[51:48] season now is the dispensation
[51:51] that Lots pulled away from you now
[51:54] you've time for you to go on
[51:56] so he lifted up his eyes no doubt over
[51:59] and over again but not like this lift up
[52:02] now thine eyes and look
[52:05] from the place where thou art northward
[52:08] now remember he's near Bethel
[52:11] so where he's at on this high place he'd
[52:14] be able to look for miles and miles and
[52:17] be able to see what is going to be his
[52:20] from the place where thou art northward
[52:23] Southward Eastward
[52:26] and Westward
[52:28] now Abraham has lost the presence of lot
[52:35] but not the presence of the Lord
[52:39] now after a lot left
[52:42] the Lord come to give Abraham a visit
[52:46] amen
[52:48] lot had the best pastor land in all the
[52:52] country
[52:53] but he didn't have the presence of the
[52:55] Lord
[52:56] I guess which one will Breathe by then
[52:58] if you can have the best pastor land and
[53:00] the presence of the Lord go for it but
[53:02] if I have to make my my choice between
[53:05] the best pastor and the presence of the
[53:07] Lord I'll take the presence of the Lord
[53:08] anyway
[53:10] now notice what God tells him for all
[53:12] the land which thou seeest to thee will
[53:14] I give it and to thy seed forever
[53:19] and I will make thy seed as the dust of
[53:22] the Earth
[53:23] so that if a man
[53:26] can number the dust of the Earth
[53:30] then shall thy seed also be numbered now
[53:33] when did this happen
[53:35] at a great separating time in Abram's
[53:38] life
[53:39] now all of us know that God demands
[53:43] separation
[53:44] sometimes it's your mother it's your
[53:46] father sometimes it might be a friend
[53:48] but the greatest separation well then
[53:51] when we separate from ourself
[53:55] that's the thing
[53:57] now watch in verse 17. arise
[54:01] and walk
[54:03] through the land
[54:05] in the lengths of it
[54:07] now the original boundary from border to
[54:10] border from the north notice the length
[54:12] which would have been north to south
[54:15] and the wit would have been east to west
[54:19] so from the North Boundary to the South
[54:23] about a hundred and eighty miles
[54:27] is the length of the Promised Land
[54:31] now the width would have been from the
[54:34] East to the West
[54:37] so from the Mediterranean over toward
[54:40] the Great River
[54:42] about
[54:43] 145 miles wide
[54:47] the land of Israel is about the size of
[54:51] New Jersey
[54:53] wow
[54:55] it has been sought after and more wars
[54:59] fought for that piece of real estate
[55:01] than any other place on the Earth
[55:05] and a place about 170 miles long and 145
[55:09] miles wide why in the world does the
[55:12] devil want that place so bad because God
[55:15] wants it
[55:17] you think you're so handsome you think
[55:20] you're so pretty sisters while the devil
[55:22] wants you he don't care nothing about
[55:24] your looks it's because God wants you
[55:30] arise walk to the land and the length of
[55:35] it and the breadth of it for I will give
[55:40] it
[55:41] unto thee
[55:43] I mean let to be rumored tonight as we
[55:45] pray
[55:47] and let's just hold our requests in our
[55:50] hearts before the Lord
[55:52] Heavenly fathers we bow our heads to the
[55:55] dust of the Earth
[55:57] we call Upon Your Great Name tonight
[55:59] father
[56:01] we ask that you take your word and speak
[56:03] to us
[56:05] may this reverberate in our souls
[56:09] tonight
[56:09] what you spoke to Our Father Abraham
[56:14] in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray
[56:17] and the Saints said amen God bless you
[56:20] you may be seated
[56:22] from those verses of scripture
[56:25] I like to speak to you for just a little
[56:28] bit tonight on footprints
[56:31] means possession
[56:36] Footprints means possession
[56:40] so Abram was told by God
[56:45] to lift up his eyes
[56:47] lot
[56:49] lifted up his eyes
[56:51] on his own
[56:54] now you know to me it's not just a great
[56:57] reflection of two men a silver dollar
[57:02] and a penny
[57:04] but it also speaks of the last days when
[57:09] self will be so dominant in the lives of
[57:14] the majority of the people on the Earth
[57:17] so lot would have been a
[57:20] ambitious sort of a person
[57:23] a man that was always looking out for
[57:28] himself
[57:29] so whatever he would think whatever he
[57:33] would do whatever achievements that he
[57:37] would make
[57:38] it would be always with number one in
[57:42] mind
[57:43] so the Bible then tells us setting was a
[57:47] very epitome of law it's amazing how the
[57:49] scripture can take three or four words
[57:51] and epitomize two different men and
[57:56] revealed the very secrets of their
[57:58] hearts just with three or four words so
[58:02] lot lifted up his eyes so that tells to
[58:07] us the nature of Lord's soul
[58:10] and then Abraham Waits until God tells
[58:16] him to lift his eyes now we know that
[58:18] Abraham didn't go around like this all
[58:21] the time and never looking up God had
[58:23] already told him about the stars and the
[58:25] sand on the seashore of course so he was
[58:29] going around with his head lifted up but
[58:32] yet this speaks of inheritance this
[58:36] speaks of possession
[58:38] and both of them are epitomized by the
[58:42] exact same words but yet they go in a
[58:46] different avenue because their souls
[58:48] were from a different place so Abraham
[58:53] Desiring to please God and Abraham to be
[58:57] honest Abraham was willing to put lot
[59:01] first now boy I'll tell you if you can
[59:03] find a man like that you found yourself
[59:05] a real man
[59:06] now Abraham as a said had the choice by
[59:10] protocol If Abraham would have said you
[59:13] go back down that country we left six
[59:15] months ago our sheep ate it to the
[59:18] ground our camels grazed it to the
[59:21] ground there's hardly one sprig of grass
[59:23] left but you go there and don't you come
[59:27] out of there until I send word for you
[59:30] to come
[59:31] now by the law he would have been
[59:34] obligated to have done that because
[59:36] Abraham was the patriarch and he led the
[59:40] clan so this would have been the
[59:42] abrahamic plan but Abraham forfeited his
[59:46] right of selfishness and his own choice
[59:49] to be the main one now remember he
[59:53] didn't even have eternal life yet but
[59:55] he's already displaying the attribute of
[59:58] God and shows us of course the choice of
[1:00:01] God in his life so Abraham was waiting
[1:00:05] now it might have seemed foolish to lot
[1:00:08] that why in the world what are you
[1:00:10] waiting for God has already made his
[1:00:13] Covenant with you God's chosen you what
[1:00:15] are you waiting for do this do that take
[1:00:19] it it's yours but Abraham somehow it
[1:00:22] just feels like he's got to wait on that
[1:00:25] nod from God he's got to wait until he's
[1:00:29] sure and he's totally sink recognize
[1:00:32] with what God I mean it was what I'm
[1:00:34] talking about was what God wants for his
[1:00:36] life he felt like there was a time of
[1:00:39] possession he had the promise of
[1:00:41] possession but he felt like that his
[1:00:43] life must be synchronized with the time
[1:00:46] now I hope you understand I believe with
[1:00:49] all of my heart that we as the people of
[1:00:51] God are experiencing a great move are we
[1:00:54] not I'm so glad to be a part of it I
[1:00:58] don't know I'm telling you I've been
[1:00:59] around the message for a while now and
[1:01:01] I've seen revivals come and go you know
[1:01:04] and then it was said years and years ago
[1:01:08] by deal Moody people laughed at it and
[1:01:11] said well you know revivals don't stay
[1:01:13] and it lasts and he said well no they
[1:01:16] don't but baths don't either but it's
[1:01:19] nice to get one every now and then so
[1:01:22] it's the same way with revivals people
[1:01:24] don't understand Revival Revival comes
[1:01:27] but Revival will go but when Revival is
[1:01:31] gone to the real seed of God it leaves
[1:01:34] them with a greater determination or
[1:01:36] greater desire and they have been
[1:01:38] quickened when the Revival struck their
[1:01:40] church or struck to remove or struck
[1:01:42] their family and the others will be
[1:01:45] moved for That season and then they just
[1:01:47] wallow right back in the mess they were
[1:01:49] before the Revival came so you see we do
[1:01:53] need Revival do we not and we are by the
[1:01:56] grace of God God has allowed us this is
[1:01:59] the bride's Revival but we know in
[1:02:02] between the moves that have struck the
[1:02:04] message all types of men have tried to
[1:02:06] raise up and say well this is the
[1:02:09] bride's Revival and of course every one
[1:02:11] of them wants to claim my they're the
[1:02:13] one that got it you know they've got the
[1:02:14] superior Revelation and all them that
[1:02:17] follow them that's all the bride that's
[1:02:19] a bunch of nonsense whenever God wants
[1:02:22] to choose to send a Revival God will do
[1:02:24] it there ain't none of us going to start
[1:02:26] it and there ain't none of us going to
[1:02:28] stop it and God will do it in such a way
[1:02:31] if he wants to pick up some not head
[1:02:33] that don't hardly know nothing and we
[1:02:36] look at him that's why God won't use
[1:02:37] that fellow God will use whoever he
[1:02:40] wants to he don't need our approval he
[1:02:43] don't need for us all to vote on it and
[1:02:45] see if it's okay God will do what he
[1:02:47] wants to do is that right so you see
[1:02:50] Abraham had this about him that lot
[1:02:53] didn't have and that was that he was
[1:02:56] going to wait on God and God was going
[1:02:59] to give him the land but notice the
[1:03:01] difference now again in this between
[1:03:04] Abraham and lot lot took the land was
[1:03:09] out direct leadership from the spirit of
[1:03:13] God you see lot looked at the land with
[1:03:16] his eyes and he saw the opportunity
[1:03:19] because a lot was a true opportunist so
[1:03:24] he saw the opportunity and Abraham put
[1:03:27] it before him and he looked at the land
[1:03:30] and Lord said wow I could have this I
[1:03:32] could be that I could do that I could do
[1:03:35] that now notice he does some even
[1:03:37] consult the prophet and say but now wait
[1:03:40] a minute Prophet Uncle what what should
[1:03:43] I do Leave Me Help Me Guide Me you are
[1:03:47] the messenger of the age help me to know
[1:03:51] what I should do I'm afraid I'll make
[1:03:53] the wrong choice but instead of doing
[1:03:55] that he saw the opportunity and he sees
[1:03:58] it well I hope you understand we've had
[1:04:00] a lot of lots around this message
[1:04:03] that's right and we will until the end
[1:04:06] until the final separation comes but yet
[1:04:09] lot reflected many many types down to
[1:04:12] the ages so where Abraham waited and
[1:04:15] waited and waited on God then whenever a
[1:04:18] lot saw it lot took it now I realized
[1:04:21] there's quite a contrast there but
[1:04:23] there's also the balance of us on the
[1:04:26] other side of us seeing our inheritance
[1:04:29] and walking into what God wants us to be
[1:04:33] how many wants out as a child of God I
[1:04:35] believe God gives every one of us as it
[1:04:38] were a title D and the title unlocks and
[1:04:41] it starts in the revealing from the soul
[1:04:44] when you're truly born again then God
[1:04:47] releases your soul from every claim that
[1:04:50] was held against you at the courthouse
[1:04:53] of God so whenever you're truly born
[1:04:56] again then your deed is absolutely
[1:04:59] cleared in the presence of God then God
[1:05:03] God starts releasing little by little
[1:05:06] your inheritance of the fullness of your
[1:05:10] adoption now your adoption is not just
[1:05:13] going to be over in the Millennium but
[1:05:15] it's when we receive the baptism of the
[1:05:17] Holy Ghost and then we start growing and
[1:05:20] God look at the apostles how long did
[1:05:22] the Lord Jesus let them grow before they
[1:05:25] started manifesting their adoption well
[1:05:27] what about three days whenever they got
[1:05:30] the Holy Ghost somebody started healing
[1:05:32] the scent they didn't have to wait five
[1:05:34] years 10 years 15 years 20 years well
[1:05:37] come on somebody when they got the Holy
[1:05:40] Ghost they started Healing The Sick they
[1:05:42] started doing exactly what the Lord
[1:05:45] Jesus done they started walking in their
[1:05:48] inheritance
[1:05:50] now notice God restated that he would
[1:05:53] give God had already made this statement
[1:05:55] but now God is reverifying to his son
[1:05:58] what he's going to do and he's going to
[1:06:00] give it to him as a possession but
[1:06:03] notice God tells him to walk so signify
[1:06:07] now Abraham has got to track this entire
[1:06:10] Journey now remember he never owned any
[1:06:12] of it yet and the only place he actually
[1:06:15] ever did only had a title to was the
[1:06:18] land of shakim where that he had able to
[1:06:20] bury his wife which was in the field and
[1:06:23] the cave of Matt Pila where job was
[1:06:26] buried but all the rest of it Abraham
[1:06:28] was a Sojourner but if Abraham would
[1:06:32] have only went 20 miles this way 20
[1:06:35] miles that way 20 miles that way and 20
[1:06:38] miles that way from the land of their
[1:06:41] cell his children would have never went
[1:06:44] any farther than that 20 miles do you
[1:06:48] understand parents that you are not not
[1:06:51] only acting out for your own inheritance
[1:06:53] but the way you relate to church you are
[1:06:57] sowing a concept in the minds of your
[1:07:00] children the way you value the ministry
[1:07:04] the way you value Church the way you
[1:07:07] value listening to tapes and reading
[1:07:09] your Bible you are set in a boundary for
[1:07:13] your children and then what they do will
[1:07:16] set a boundary for their children so if
[1:07:19] Abraham would have won 20 miles in every
[1:07:21] direction can you imagine how hard if
[1:07:24] not impossible it would have been to
[1:07:27] ever had one Seed of Abraham to go 20
[1:07:30] miles Beyond Basel but what did Abraham
[1:07:34] do he tracked from there as far north as
[1:07:38] God told him to go and then he went all
[1:07:41] the way down to the South and then at
[1:07:43] the widest part of Palestine which juts
[1:07:45] out a little bit near over a right where
[1:07:48] it goes the widest part around 100 45
[1:07:51] miles the average is around 125 to 130
[1:07:54] but he had to go over that because that
[1:07:57] little jut out went out just a little
[1:07:59] bit more what if God's got a little Judd
[1:08:01] out in my life I want to Jet over there
[1:08:04] to the Judd owl I don't want to miss an
[1:08:06] acre well come on somebody if God's got
[1:08:09] a jut out to your life why would you not
[1:08:12] want it why would you not want
[1:08:14] everything that God has given to you why
[1:08:17] would you only want 20 miles from
[1:08:20] Calvary that way 20 miles from Calvary
[1:08:23] this way 20 miles from Calvary that way
[1:08:27] and that way when God has got thousands
[1:08:30] times thousands of Acres Calvary is only
[1:08:34] to be kidding the cross is just where we
[1:08:37] get started we don't stop at Calvary
[1:08:40] that's where we start we don't stop at
[1:08:43] the cross and say well I've got the
[1:08:46] cross I've got everything the cross is
[1:08:49] the bridge that takes just across the
[1:08:51] Council on the other side it takes us to
[1:08:55] Healing it takes us to the Holy Ghost it
[1:08:58] takes us to the fullness of our
[1:09:00] inheritance does anybody want it tonight

[1:12:42] life well I believe I can I believe you
[1:12:46] can but it don't make no difference how
[1:12:48] much I believe you can if you don't
[1:12:51] believe you can and you cannot just
[1:12:53] stand there and say yeah I believe it
[1:12:55] well don't wear your seat mail sure off
[1:13:00] your land by your sea March from the
[1:13:03] north to the south from the East to the
[1:13:05] West let the devil know I've ever inch
[1:13:08] of ground is mine
[1:13:14] yeah
[1:13:16] oh my goodness
[1:13:19] you know Abraham believed God of course
[1:13:22] we know that he did the Bible doesn't
[1:13:24] say that of course about lot lot was a
[1:13:27] troublemaker but Abraham was a
[1:13:31] peacemaker lot's heart was centered on
[1:13:34] wealth Abraham's heart was centered on
[1:13:38] the will of God I trusted we've got some
[1:13:40] Seed of Abraham in your tonight and you
[1:13:42] see then it actually turned lot they
[1:13:45] were the best of buddies you thought and
[1:13:47] of course he was his nephew but
[1:13:49] eventually lot it set lot at war with
[1:13:53] Abraham against it so lot then entered
[1:13:57] into this trivial saying and what
[1:13:59] happened then the Shepherds began to
[1:14:01] beat around on Abraham's Shepherds and a
[1:14:03] war broke out among them what whose
[1:14:06] fault was it it was watt's fault you
[1:14:08] realize friends that that he could not
[1:14:11] walk with Abraham any farther because
[1:14:14] Abraham walked was gone now listen
[1:14:17] you're the reason that many people pull
[1:14:19] away from you and pull away from the
[1:14:22] bride of Christ it's because who we keep
[1:14:25] company with we keep company with God we
[1:14:29] keep company with the angels of God and
[1:14:33] some folks just don't like hanging
[1:14:34] around angels
[1:14:35] well I don't mind telling you I do I
[1:14:39] love hanging around Angels help me in
[1:14:40] your desk notice that you see his his
[1:14:43] the heart the heart problem of light was
[1:14:47] actually his heart the heart of every
[1:14:50] problem
[1:14:51] it's the problem of the heart the heart
[1:14:55] of every problem is the problem of the
[1:14:59] heart so God's heart was not where it
[1:15:01] needed to be with God but Abraham was
[1:15:04] and Abraham's best friend was God but
[1:15:07] lot's best friend was the world so
[1:15:10] there's no way they're going to be able
[1:15:11] to hang together or they said totally
[1:15:13] impossible so you see God told Abraham I
[1:15:17] want you to walk it so here's what's
[1:15:19] Abraham doing by his feet he's surveying
[1:15:23] the promised land now God said I want
[1:15:26] you to go all the way first you know the
[1:15:27] North and God gave him a perimeter you
[1:15:29] remember reading about that and God told
[1:15:31] him exactly where to go so he had to
[1:15:34] cover every boundary from the north to
[1:15:37] the South East to the west and claimed
[1:15:40] it for his sins
[1:15:43] our lord Jesus not only come on the
[1:15:47] earth and God a great victory for
[1:15:49] himself but he did it for us so he went
[1:15:53] as far as he could go to redeem us he
[1:15:57] brought the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:59] and he set the boundaries there and he
[1:16:01] said all things are possible if you only
[1:16:05] believe I'm going to tell you how far
[1:16:07] the Lord Jesus surveyed this property
[1:16:09] and he went on to say if you shall
[1:16:12] believe when you say to this mountain
[1:16:14] and don't doubt on your heart it shall
[1:16:16] be moved and nothing shall be impossible
[1:16:19] to you
[1:16:20] now remember here is the surveyor
[1:16:23] himself so he won as far north as a
[1:16:27] person could go right into the presence
[1:16:29] of God and brought back the delivery to
[1:16:32] you and I on the title deal and said all
[1:16:35] things are not just possible with God
[1:16:37] but all things are possible with you if
[1:16:39] you'll believe him
[1:16:41] how many needs help us there tonight oh
[1:16:43] yeah I guarantee we all do so you see
[1:16:46] God was telling Abraham Footprints means
[1:16:50] possession now that's all well and good
[1:16:53] if God gives it to Abraham but what
[1:16:55] about his see now does God carry on that
[1:16:59] same command to the seed or the
[1:17:02] genealogy of Abraham or does it stop
[1:17:04] just with Abraham or does God continue
[1:17:07] at all let's read Deuteronomy chapter 11
[1:17:09] verse 21 that your days may be about
[1:17:13] supplied in the days of your children in
[1:17:15] the land which the Lord swear unto your
[1:17:18] fathers to give them as the days of
[1:17:20] Heaven upon the Earth for you shall
[1:17:24] diligently keep all these Commandments
[1:17:26] which I command you to do them to love
[1:17:28] the Lord your God to walk in all his
[1:17:31] ways and to cleave unto him then the
[1:17:35] Lord will drive out all these nations
[1:17:38] from before you and you shall Perse yes
[1:17:42] greater Nations and mightier than
[1:17:45] yourselves
[1:17:47] I mean he's got an enemy tonight that
[1:17:49] seems greater than you you need to
[1:17:51] possess it here's your promise now
[1:17:53] notice they're not equal to or your
[1:17:56] enemy is less than God's telling them
[1:17:59] right up front I'm gonna let y'all know
[1:18:00] right now your enemy is bigger than you
[1:18:03] your enemy is greater than you but not
[1:18:07] me and you together it's bigger than you
[1:18:10] but it's not bigger than me and you
[1:18:12] because we are a team well praise the
[1:18:15] Lord notice in every place watch God now
[1:18:19] in every place well for the soul oh

[1:18:50] code so from the Euphrates now the
[1:18:53] number we're going East-West from the
[1:18:55] Euphrates over to the Mediterranean Sea
[1:18:58] and then from the Lebanon which is north
[1:19:01] of course on down to the South what's

[1:19:47] enough picture to even come to the house
[1:19:49] of God we ain't got enough venture to
[1:19:51] fight the devils and to be able to let
[1:19:53] Satan know where we stand oh yeah we
[1:19:55] believe the message Satan ain't scared
[1:19:57] of you just saying that along what he's
[1:19:59] scared of the Prophet said what we need

[1:22:01] ground
[1:22:07] I wonder what you all think
[1:22:10] of how it is when you pray
[1:22:13] of how Satan reacts
[1:22:17] what is the imagery in your mind of you
[1:22:22] pray
[1:22:24] Lord God
[1:22:26] I need this Lord I need that father my
[1:22:29] kids is Grouchy my wife ain't doing

[1:22:37] God I pray you'd help all of them but me
[1:22:39] I'm just so glad you put me on the earth
[1:22:41] Lord
[1:22:46] we need to get rid of our
[1:22:47] self-righteousness
[1:22:48] cast herself at the mercy of God and say
[1:22:51] God I need help
[1:22:53] God I I need help
[1:22:56] and then when we do that then what do
[1:22:58] you think the devil does you all think
[1:23:00] the devil's down in Hell life and it's
[1:23:01] your prayer if you're living where you
[1:23:04] need to be living and you know your
[1:23:06] position in Christ Jesus Devils Tremble
[1:23:09] When you pray
[1:23:11] it's not you that ought to be afraid of
[1:23:13] the devil it ought to be the devil
[1:23:16] afraid of you the Bible tells you if
[1:23:19] you'll resist the devil he will
[1:23:23] not towards you he's going to go the
[1:23:26] other way
[1:23:28] God will put the dread of you on demons
[1:23:33] God will put the dread of you on cancer
[1:23:38] on sickness on depression on anxiety and
[1:23:43] when anxiety gets near you anxiety will
[1:23:46] say oh no you better not get around him
[1:23:50] you better not get around her
[1:24:05] but of course
[1:24:09] oh
[1:24:10] I'm so

[1:24:29] well down there I don't feel it word the
[1:24:31] Bible say you had to feel anything
[1:24:34] when are you ever gonna learn you ain't
[1:24:35] gonna overcome a Hell by feeling
[1:24:37] anything you're going to overcome hell
[1:24:39] whenever you feel nothing understanding
[1:24:41] your positions the word of God my
[1:24:43] friends I saw a little bit of the
[1:24:44] excerpt of the service here Sunday my
[1:24:46] goodness a hypocrite could be able to
[1:24:48] shout and run and shout and carry on
[1:24:49] under the anointing though that was your
[1:24:51] son if it didn't hit you that way I
[1:24:53] wonder about you but that is when you
[1:24:55] overcome it's when you walk outside them
[1:24:58] doors and you don't feel nothing when
[1:25:00] you walk outside them doors and all hell
[1:25:02] breaks against and you say back off
[1:25:05] devil back off devil I'm the same child
[1:25:08] of God was running around that building
[1:25:10] I'm the same child of God with the same
[1:25:13] Holy Ghost with the same promise and
[1:25:15] you're on my land and I don't allow any
[1:25:19] trespassing on my land
[1:25:27] foreign
[1:25:33] there's a little varmint that's been
[1:25:35] trespassing
[1:25:36] mine and Carol's Home
[1:25:41] it's about that tall
[1:25:43] not that long
[1:25:45] got rings around its tail
[1:25:47] and he's wearing a mask like a bandit
[1:25:51] and he truly is abandoned
[1:25:54] but apparently this Bandit went to
[1:25:56] school
[1:25:57] because he found out a way to open up
[1:26:01] our refrigerator door on the back porch
[1:26:05] so he's been helping himself
[1:26:07] to my goods
[1:26:12] oh man he's been helping himself to my
[1:26:16] goods which you won't help me by and as
[1:26:19] far as I know none of you help me buy
[1:26:22] that for no raccoon you did not give it
[1:26:25] to me and say well brother don't you buy
[1:26:27] the of sandwiches buy the this
[1:26:29] and buy the that no I didn't buy it
[1:26:32] for no and I don't want no
[1:26:34] eating it and my wife sure don't want no
[1:26:37] either she was out there today and
[1:26:40] she was madder than a hornet there was
[1:26:43] tracks all over everywhere her
[1:26:45] unless and then out there cleaning the
[1:26:47] back porch and they was tracks on
[1:26:49] the counter they was Paul Prince on
[1:26:52] the refrigerator they was punched
[1:26:54] here and there and the other there was
[1:26:56] flames of fire dancing in her eyes and
[1:26:59] it wasn't a pillar of fire neither
[1:27:01] [Applause]
[1:27:06] so I told her don't get mad at me
[1:27:10] get mad as I come we've got to do
[1:27:12] something down I said all right
[1:27:15] so I went to Tractor Supply
[1:27:18] and I'm hoping that I've got a hairy
[1:27:21] garment or a varmint
[1:27:24] in that Triumph when I get home I put
[1:27:28] him some sweet little marshmallows I put
[1:27:31] him some orange old man alive when he
[1:27:33] comes in that back porch I even took on
[1:27:36] the screams off and made him an easy
[1:27:38] entrance I'm hoping when I get home so
[1:27:40] if any of you in the neighborhood hear
[1:27:42] somebody let out a big Squall you know
[1:27:45] man the how to fight I'll tell you
[1:27:47] one thing I don't like it whenever he
[1:27:49] trespasses and he tears up my screen how
[1:27:53] much more do I not like it when the
[1:27:56] devil trespasses my peace and the devil
[1:27:59] devil trespasses your home and your
[1:28:02] health and your family and your husband
[1:28:05] and your wife we ought to say devil out
[1:28:09] of here
[1:28:10] Jesus Christ purchases for me and don't
[1:28:14] belong to you
[1:28:26] now the difference between me and that
[1:28:27] is
[1:28:29] my footprints on that back porch
[1:28:32] means it's mine
[1:28:34] he ain't got no title deep
[1:28:36] and he shows up after Dark
[1:28:39] well praise the Lord that sounds like
[1:28:41] the devil don't it
[1:28:43] I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna challenge
[1:28:44] him if I don't catch him I'm gonna tell
[1:28:46] him I'll just say I'm trying to holler
[1:28:47] come on come on
[1:28:51] I reach and get my 12 gauge
[1:28:55] I'll tell you one thing that's what we
[1:28:58] need to do to the devil
[1:28:59] or mother daddy how am I going to know
[1:29:01] what my ground is study your Bible

[1:29:19] got in tune with Tick Tock but not the
[1:29:21] one from China but the time clock of God

[1:29:27] getting closer and closer and closer to
[1:29:30] the Midnight Cry and we're not gonna be
[1:29:33] ready by feeding on social entertainment
[1:29:36] and this and that and the other we need
[1:29:39] to be so filled with the Holy Ghost that
[1:29:42] gambles rhyme when we come around
[1:29:44] because if our inheritance
[1:29:47] [Applause]
[1:29:56] laughs
[1:29:59] so
[1:30:01] under the prophet messenger
[1:30:03] it's clear I think
[1:30:04] God told him to take the land
[1:30:07] so God takes his Prophet messenger now

[1:32:02] years ago
[1:32:04] or shall I just go ahead and preach
[1:32:07] you ain't got no confidence in my
[1:32:08] transmittal meditation do you
[1:32:11] well what if I'm just trying to think
[1:32:13] myself six months young you reckon it'll
[1:32:15] work
[1:32:17] you know
[1:32:18] well what if I just try to imagine
[1:32:21] myself
[1:32:22] well you know how that works don't you
[1:32:24] and they were living in because a boy
[1:32:26] gets up one day and he decides he's a
[1:32:28] girl
[1:32:30] I wonder if I get up in the morning
[1:32:31] decide I'm a millionaire
[1:32:33] and I just walk into the bank and say I
[1:32:36] have arrived
[1:32:39] I'm a manner oh really but what's your
[1:32:41] account number BR549
[1:32:46] okay now where's all these deposits oh

[1:32:51] I don't need no deposits I don't need no
[1:32:53] biological deposits or anything like
[1:32:55] that I'm just thinking today I'm just
[1:32:58] thinking that I'm a you know I'm a
[1:33:00] millionaire well come on it makes just
[1:33:02] as much sense as a man getting up and
[1:33:04] seek and he's a woman and a woman
[1:33:07] thinking she's a man or they're seeking
[1:33:10] they're not either one the non-binary
[1:33:13] they don't have to be nothing you're
[1:33:15] about as dumb as a cold bucket
[1:33:17] well come on nature will teach you
[1:33:20] better than that why the jack rabbits
[1:33:22] got more sense than that you don't see
[1:33:25] no male Jackrabbit acting like no trans
[1:33:28] female they don't see no squirrel or
[1:33:31] taking his tuxedo suit off and putting a
[1:33:34] dress on a squirrel do you no that's
[1:33:37] only crazy human beings
[1:33:46] foreign
[1:33:49] place the soul of your foot shall tread
[1:33:52] upon
[1:33:54] that have I given unto you
[1:33:56] so if you don't put your put your foot

[1:34:47] Coast there shall not any man be able to
[1:34:49] stand before thee all the days of thou
[1:34:51] life and as I was with Moses

[1:37:32] opposition is how great it seems if God
[1:37:35] said so it's yours
[1:37:39] would he give it to Joshua he never said
[1:37:41] I'll take all the havites
[1:37:44] and the Philistines

[1:37:50] every inch of God
[1:37:54] oh my goodness
[1:37:57] every inch
[1:38:00] that's about your inches right

[1:38:14] many times friends that's where we fail
[1:38:18] we take three steps forward

[1:39:34] furlongs when you were kilometers by
[1:39:36] kilometers or continent by continent you
[1:39:38] mean that's the way God told him right
[1:39:40] up front
[1:39:41] this is the way y'all gonna get this
[1:39:43] land by little and little
[1:39:46] not little and lot I'd have been even a
[1:39:48] little more comforted but little by

[1:40:33] what what kind of friend are you
[1:40:40] I can help you but don't you understand
[1:40:43] it's not me it's not these preachers
[1:40:46] that are your favorite ones and you say
[1:40:48] oh I get so much well what do you do
[1:40:51] with what you get
[1:41:00] look friends remember I think I'll
[1:41:02] forget sometimes
[1:41:03] opposite Pentecostal before I come to
[1:41:05] this message
[1:41:07] and I got to a place I was so dependent
[1:41:10] on gifts
[1:41:13] so dependent
[1:41:15] boy the Lord had to teach me some
[1:41:17] lessons
[1:41:17] [Music]
[1:41:19] there was two little brothers in this
[1:41:21] Cherokee Indians Carl and Willie was
[1:41:24] their names
[1:41:26] but the car was really gifted
[1:41:29] whenever I needed something from the
[1:41:31] Lord
[1:41:32] I'd go over there to Russell Springs
[1:41:33] near where they lived at
[1:41:36] my other Lord would just show him stuff
[1:41:38] and show him this and show him that
[1:41:41] we're going to sit down in the living
[1:41:43] room sitting there just go to talking
[1:41:45] about the Lord and the goodness of the
[1:41:46] Lord and they had a lamp right at the
[1:41:49] end of the sofa
[1:41:50] that lamp would start going off
[1:41:53] and on
[1:41:54] off
[1:41:55] and on
[1:41:56] off and on
[1:41:59] by itself
[1:42:01] and he said that brother Donnie
[1:42:03] you've got a need
[1:42:05] say yes I do
[1:42:06] well let's just pray so they go to pray
[1:42:09] and praying
[1:42:10] oh but brother Donnie was building up a
[1:42:14] great big pacifier
[1:42:16] I mean that dude was about that big
[1:42:18] around and about that long
[1:42:21] so every time I got in trouble
[1:42:23] I would call him brother Carl Brother
[1:42:25] Willie some other brothers that I knew
[1:42:28] in Pentecost that was gifted all one
[1:42:30] particular time and Coast I met the
[1:42:32] other day I was going through such a
[1:42:33] storm in my life and it was on a Sunday
[1:42:35] a Nitro Carol said I just got to go seek
[1:42:37] all the women I just got to have got to
[1:42:40] I believe the Lord is leading me
[1:42:48] well I missed church on Sunday morning
[1:42:51] and drove over to Carl and Willy's house
[1:42:54] but guess what man I got where Carl and
[1:42:56] where he lives Carlton really wasn't
[1:42:58] there
[1:43:00] so we sat out in the car and sat out in
[1:43:02] the car and burned up and sat out in the
[1:43:05] car went to a little store and got
[1:43:07] something to drink we sat out in the car
[1:43:09] and we sat out in the car and after a
[1:43:12] while I went home
[1:43:15] I was so defeated
[1:43:18] huh yeah oh I know a lot of preachers
[1:43:21] ain't going to tell you stuff like this
[1:43:22] about them but you know what I figured
[1:43:24] this will help somebody it's worth me
[1:43:26] being humiliated a lot of preachers want
[1:43:28] to tell you how God always answers their
[1:43:30] prayers and everything like that don't
[1:43:32] you never believe that don't you never
[1:43:34] believe God answers every prayer though
[1:43:36] I ever preacher praised it now that's a
[1:43:38] bunch of Lies there ain't no such a
[1:43:40] truth to no such thing absolutely not
[1:43:43] that'll only tell you why I pray for
[1:43:44] someone's on this happen they won't tell
[1:43:46] you when they fall flight on their face
[1:43:48] but they do just like all the rest of us
[1:43:52] oh my I was so low and I was so low and
[1:43:56] so low and I oh God what am I going to
[1:43:59] do God what am I going to do but you see
[1:44:01] what Donnie had done God God eat Donnie
[1:44:05] had got to the place he was so dependent
[1:44:07] on A Gifted Man that I couldn't have
[1:44:10] Victory Without A Gifted Man oh
[1:44:13] Hallelujah my aren't you glad I've
[1:44:15] changed since then at least some anyway
[1:44:17] I wouldn't be much of a leader would I
[1:44:19] but you see God knew what he had in his
[1:44:22] mind for me so he had to take me through
[1:44:25] that school that's the reason it really
[1:44:27] bothers me friends when I see a lot of
[1:44:29] our message people getting behind
[1:44:32] certain gifted ones and they can only
[1:44:34] get revived and really fired up around
[1:44:36] certain preachers yeah you're heading
[1:44:38] the same path oh Donnie does it may not
[1:44:41] be Carl and really they may have
[1:44:42] different names but the result is going
[1:44:45] to be the same thing you see God wants
[1:44:48] us to stand on his word
[1:44:50] listen to the sermon listen to the
[1:44:54] sermon in Shreveport in 1965 I listened
[1:44:57] to it going down to brother David's and
[1:44:59] coming back from Brother David's works
[1:45:01] his faith Express and you'll find the
[1:45:03] prophet of God saying that gifts are
[1:45:06] only minors I find this so strange that
[1:45:09] we're all of a sudden but you're going
[1:45:10] to hear according from here the prophet
[1:45:13] said that gifts are minors and you can
[1:45:15] never make a major out of a minor come
[1:45:20] on children we do not take the Rapture
[1:45:24] by gifts God's Prophet said we take the
[1:45:27] Rapture by the word you will not take
[1:45:30] your inheritance my gifts you will not
[1:45:34] take your possession by emotion you will
[1:45:37] take it by a god-given face and you
[1:45:41] stand right there and say Satan in the
[1:45:44] name of Jesus give me my property
[1:45:47] I need my healing I need my Deliverance
[1:45:51] I need peace
[1:46:03] don't you believe in gifts sure do in
[1:46:07] the right place
[1:46:09] gifts are minors
[1:46:12] not majors
[1:46:14] only someone writing re-writing the
[1:46:19] symphony
[1:46:20] makes gifts majors
[1:46:23] don't get quiet on me now
[1:46:27] the Divine Symphony of this age so the
[1:46:31] message of Malachi 4 says they are
[1:46:33] minors
[1:46:36] and if we're not careful about going to
[1:46:37] get just off the Pentecostals we won't
[1:46:40] believe unless we've got a gift
[1:46:42] [Music]
[1:46:46] y'all done a little studying on it while
[1:46:48] I was gone and a film where the Prophet
[1:46:50] said many people the evangelists come
[1:46:53] soon praise for all the sick and he said

[1:52:01] glory to God
[1:52:05] we got thumbitis we click
[1:52:09] ah oh Jesus

[1:52:42] me get plant their favorite fruits you
[1:52:45] plant her favorite vegetables you set up
[1:52:47] grocery stores you set up everything
[1:52:49] just the way they wanted and don't you
[1:52:51] touch one bite of it and when you get it
[1:52:53] all done you just gently walk out of
[1:52:55] here and I mean it now yes sir yes sir
[1:52:58] yes sir and they walked in boy there
[1:53:00] there was just big nanners hanging
[1:53:02] everywhere that was onions and
[1:53:03] cantaloupes and everything and that's
[1:53:05] such a praise God I'm talking about a
[1:53:08] victory victory is mine victory is mine
[1:53:14] know it
[1:53:21] Arc
[1:53:24] you just walked in and took it
[1:53:30] was that hot in yours it's just me
[1:53:35] they had to fight for every inch of the
[1:53:38] way that's right
[1:53:40] they had the promise of Victory but God
[1:53:42] told Joshua we're the soldier of your
[1:53:43] foot tread that have I given to you so
[1:53:45] Footprints meant possession remember
[1:53:47] that sister in the wheelchair
[1:53:52] Footprints means possession
[1:53:54] every time the soles of your feet touch
[1:53:57] it that's it
[1:53:58] you say I couldn't wiggle
[1:54:02] my finger
[1:54:03] yesterday
[1:54:05] but I can wiggle it today
[1:54:11] now you see God will perform Miracles
[1:54:13] and maybe bring somebody out of the
[1:54:16] wheelchair instantly but he don't do
[1:54:17] everybody that way
[1:54:19] Divine Healing in a miracle it's not the
[1:54:21] same thing
[1:54:22] so how do some people get healed by the
[1:54:24] miraculous power of God well they lose
[1:54:27] one pain and then another pain and then
[1:54:31] another pain and then they go for a week
[1:54:32] and they realize you know what I'm
[1:54:34] getting my strength back praise the Lord
[1:54:36] hallelujah I I'm feeling a little bit
[1:54:38] better I said brother can you leap over
[1:54:40] a troop and jump through a wall no I
[1:54:42] can't do that or vice versa I'm still so
[1:54:45] we can't I can't hardly go and
[1:54:46] somebody'll go to God it didn't happen
[1:54:48] to me that way I'll tell you one thing
[1:54:49] I've got prayed for I'll come out of
[1:54:50] like a boat a lot and hit me but that
[1:54:52] might have been a bolt for them it don't
[1:54:53] mean it's a boat for you God may want to
[1:54:55] prove your face and let others look at
[1:54:58] you and say I want you to look at that I
[1:55:00] want you to look at that brother I want
[1:55:01] you to look at that sister she barely
[1:55:03] barely just moves that little finger but
[1:55:06] you see her she said glory to God
[1:55:09] glory to God
[1:55:11] now some of you all y'all to be ashamed
[1:55:13] of yourself you've got both hands both
[1:55:15] arms and you can do this some people all
[1:55:17] they can do is this right here and yet
[1:55:19] they do it with all their mind if you've
[1:55:21] got both your hands tonight both your
[1:55:22] arms and a good voice you ought to be
[1:55:24] ashamed of yourself you're saying glory
[1:55:26] to God I worship you Lord I Praise You
[1:55:29] Lord God because you're so good
[1:55:31] Hallelujah
[1:55:34] notice this
[1:55:35] [Applause]
[1:55:37] I couldn't wiggle my finger yesterday
[1:55:39] but I can wiggle it today you got that
[1:55:44] much possession
[1:55:47] well praise God three weeks ago I was
[1:55:49] taking 14 blood pressure pills and 19
[1:55:51] tension pills and 37 but blood pressure
[1:55:53] this and that and the other glory to God
[1:55:55] I'm down to 113 pills a day now praise
[1:55:58] God and some people say Lord have mercy
[1:56:01] just leave them alone little by little
[1:56:02] if that's the way they come praise God
[1:56:04] then let's just go ahead and take the
[1:56:06] victory let's encourage one another or
[1:56:09] we don't know if you're gonna say I'd be
[1:56:11] ashamed of myself if I should if they
[1:56:13] drop off a pill a day it may take them
[1:56:15] six years to get to it they ain't taking
[1:56:17] none but praise God they're on the way
[1:56:24] notice so today yesterday you couldn't
[1:56:27] wiggle your finger today you wiggled
[1:56:29] your finger
[1:56:30] and the prophet said tomorrow
[1:56:33] you can wiggle your hands

[1:56:41] here you go
[1:56:43] but notice so you start with nothing so
[1:56:45] prayers made for you absolutely nothing
[1:56:47] can do one thing then tomorrow you get
[1:56:49] up and say glory to God Hallelujah
[1:56:52] praise the Lord my people look at that
[1:56:54] says Lord have mercy what look at them
[1:56:56] they're absolutely out of their mind
[1:56:57] what the hell happened she wiggled her

[1:57:02] thing if you can't wiggle it
[1:57:04] well praise the Lord hallelujah she's
[1:57:07] wound about today what will happen she
[1:57:09] wiggled her hand
[1:57:10] you better watch out whenever she jumps
[1:57:12] out because she's really going to go I'm
[1:57:13] telling you but what will God do God's
[1:57:16] got to have somebody
[1:57:18] that he can do this to
[1:57:20] there's so many he came
[1:57:22] cause if he don't do it like that
[1:57:25] they're ready to quit
[1:57:30] a lot to preach something to to you
[1:57:33] sometime
[1:57:34] the pain preceding Glory
[1:57:39] the blind man that Jesus said was born
[1:57:41] blind they said he sent his mother sin
[1:57:43] father sin said no for the glory of God
[1:57:46] how much humiliation did he Bear for the
[1:57:48] glory of God how much pain did he Bear
[1:57:51] for the glory of God years the man
[1:57:52] couldn't work for the glory of God Years
[1:57:55] A man was ridiculed and made fun of for
[1:57:57] the glory of God you see some people God
[1:58:00] will use their life through a great
[1:58:02] phenomenal thing they will pay for years
[1:58:05] for that one event

[1:59:48] God all hell's broke loose that's a good
[1:59:49] sign you're probably supposed to be here
[1:59:52] but people come and say oh

[2:00:22] thinking everybody's perfect including
[2:00:24] the pasture well let me tell you right
[2:00:25] up there ain't no such a thing as a
[2:00:27] perfect Pastor there ain't no such a
[2:00:29] thing as a perfect church and if there
[2:00:31] was and you move there you just messed
[2:00:33] up the whole deal
[2:00:36] there was only one perfect thing among
[2:00:38] us and that's the Lord Jesus
[2:00:49] Joshua was told by God everywhere The
[2:00:51] Souls of your feet set that I've given
[2:00:52] you footstep me possession
[2:00:54] every promise in the book is two
[2:00:57] Believers but you've got to make
[2:00:59] footprints
[2:01:00] through it
[2:01:03] you've got to fight every inch of the
[2:01:06] way listen at this advice
[2:01:09] and if you haven't got no fight in you
[2:01:12] then get out
[2:01:15] of the game
[2:01:24] Glory
[2:01:26] a child of God can compare the worst day
[2:01:29] they've ever had since they've been a
[2:01:31] Christian
[2:01:32] to the very best day they ever had
[2:01:34] Living For The Devil
[2:01:36] and they say his days don't steal don't
[2:01:38] even compare
[2:01:41] Jesus never answers another one of your
[2:01:43] my prayers or your prayers he has been
[2:01:46] so good to us all
[2:01:48] we're unworthy friends we're Unworthy of
[2:01:51] any of his kindnesses and his mercies
[2:01:53] oh but I'm so glad they're renewed every
[2:01:57] morning
[2:01:59] just think of it when you open your eyes
[2:02:01] in the morning
[2:02:03] his mercies are renewed for you
[2:02:06] his strengths are there to help you
[2:02:11] so you're dealing with an issue in your
[2:02:13] life
[2:02:14] you're dealing with a problem you're
[2:02:15] dealing with something you can't
[2:02:16] overcome
[2:02:18] he said brother Donnie I try I struggle
[2:02:20] with this certain certain thing whatever
[2:02:22] it is and I do good and then it seemed
[2:02:24] like it just overwhelms me what can I do
[2:02:26] keep her right on fight
[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:30] well I was hoping you'd have some type
[2:02:32] of Magic Bullet I carry no Magic Bullets
[2:02:34] I hand out Swords not Magic Bullets
[2:02:38] quotes scriptures
[2:02:41] to be able to put in your armor that
[2:02:43] when you walk out of those doors tonight
[2:02:45] and you face the devil tomorrow you can
[2:02:48] stand there and feel nothing you'll
[2:02:50] stand up with no preachers surrounding
[2:02:52] you no use leaders they're behind you
[2:02:55] but you'll stand up with almighty God
[2:02:57] and a host of angels and send Satan I'm
[2:03:00] warning you in the name of Jesus you
[2:03:03] better get off my property
[2:03:05] you better get off my property

[2:03:12] flower he'll eat your marshmallows and
[2:03:14] he'll eat your pork chops he'll eat
[2:03:17] everything you've got he'll take away
[2:03:18] from you and leave you high and dry and
[2:03:21] then he will tell you that you ain't no
[2:03:23] good you might as well just go ahead and
[2:03:25] stand your ground and say back off devil
[2:03:28] this is my inheritance
[2:03:31] Hallelujah
[2:03:40] Footprints means
[2:03:42] possession
[2:03:51] I wonder
[2:03:53] so we're about our heads tonight
[2:03:54] together
[2:03:58] maybe there's folks that need healing in
[2:04:00] their body they need
[2:04:02] Deliverance for something
[2:04:04] you're dealing with
[2:04:06] you just like to be remembered now
[2:04:08] remember you're not going to overcome
[2:04:09] but me praying for you
[2:04:11] but I believe God will hear my prayers
[2:04:13] and strengthen you and help you
[2:04:17] but you're going to overcome by taking
[2:04:18] this word
[2:04:20] not my footprints but yours
[2:04:24] your footprints on that Devil's Head
[2:04:27] will mean possession
[2:04:30] you may not get as quick as you want
[2:04:32] but you fight
[2:04:34] and if you gain two inches and you fight
[2:04:36] three days to get it and fight three
[2:04:38] days to keep it
[2:04:39] once you've got a good stand then you're
[2:04:42] ready to take another inch or two
[2:04:44] keep right on going until we change in a
[2:04:48] moment in the twinkling of an hour
[2:04:51] I mean a lot to be remembered tonight
