[41:24] responsibility it's not all the goo and

[41:31] disappointments up late at night

[41:59] life I'm grateful for my brother and
[42:03] sister who desire Lord to be able to
[42:06] bring up their children in the way
[42:08] that's pleasing to
[42:10] you we know it's not always easy there's
[42:14] no way for them to know the heartaches
[42:16] that may lay before them with their
[42:18] little
[42:19] son there's no way for them to know the
[42:22] diseases or sickness or the darkness of
[42:25] the age that they may
[42:27] face but the way they look at it it's
[42:30] worth
[42:31] it for we know that if we can train them
[42:34] up in the right way then they will not
[42:37] depart from it this is the shortest time
[42:40] that we'll ever have them we're looking
[42:42] Beyond the Veil

[42:46] our children
[42:48] again my brother and sister bring their
[42:50] little son to you today to dedicate his
[42:54] life to you father help my sister that
[42:57] it can be the Fifth Gospel the
[42:59] Declaration of
[43:01] Jesus May the angels of God feel so
[43:04] comfortable in their home May the
[43:07] presence of the spirit of God be near
[43:09] him Lord if time would tear that he'd be
[43:12] old enough to reach the age of
[43:14] accountability and to be able to know
[43:16] right from wrong may he be able to give
[43:19] his little heart to you when he's young
[43:21] before the evil days come upon him keep
[43:25] him from the sickness disease his evils
[43:28] of the day I dedicate his life to you
[43:31] Lord Jesus for a life of service for
[43:34] it's in your precious Holy Name that we
[43:37] ask it
[43:41] amen yep he'll fit really good look at
[43:43] that
[43:45] sleeping
[43:53] wow can we stand together
[44:05] praise the Lord let's turn to Romans
[44:08] chapter 7 if you would
[44:12] today I'm sure brother Lou already
[44:14] mentioned it but the um Vacation Bible
[44:17] School will start tomorrow actually I
[44:20] want to say how much I appreciate all
[44:21] the work and all the effort that's been
[44:23] um gone into it for our children
[44:27] um also ask brother Michael if he would
[44:31] reach out to the other churches in our
[44:33] area professing to follow the message
[44:36] and U invite them their children if they
[44:40] wish to come I don't think the lord gave
[44:43] us this place just for
[44:47] us you know and some of the other
[44:49] churches around or smaller churches and
[44:51] they don't really have some of them
[44:53] don't have that many young people so
[44:54] they maybe they couldn't do something
[44:56] like like this but I wanted to open up
[44:59] for them as well and um if they can come
[45:02] so if you see some kids maybe you don't
[45:04] know and you know I believe that if we
[45:07] could get them to
[45:09] Jesus and say something that would help
[45:12] their
[45:13] hearts I read the other day where that
[45:16] the houti which is a a rebel group in
[45:21] Yemen they are having summer camps this
[45:26] summer they have over a
[45:29] million of these kids that are attending
[45:32] these camps and the main theme of their
[45:36] entire Camp is hating Jews learning how
[45:41] to kill them learning how to torment
[45:44] them learning how to torture them rape
[45:47] them you imagine little bitty children I
[45:52] saw pictures of little bitty old boys
[45:54] standing there with fake guns and their
[45:57] arms and the hamos things and all that
[46:00] around their heads Satan knows exactly
[46:02] what he's doing to try to influence you
[46:05] remember Hitler years and years ago had
[46:07] a group called Hitler Youth and they was
[46:10] taking them when they were young
[46:12] teenagers and instill this
[46:14] hatred well if they can do that how much
[46:17] more should we do it with the truth of
[46:20] the
[46:21] Gospel amen so remember that this week
[46:24] that the Lord will just be with them
[46:26] they'll be having fun of course and
[46:27] they're going to have um different
[46:29] things that they're going to teach them
[46:31] so just pray the presence of God will be
[46:33] able to be here for every night that
[46:35] that's going on you know what it might
[46:38] be a little child I just read it to you
[46:40] the other day where the Prophet said
[46:42] there's a little boy a little girl in
[46:44] here that was born over in Seattle
[46:46] Washington they're not old enough to
[46:48] receive it yet but the church will plug
[46:50] play along slug along have meetings and
[46:52] so forth until that child is old enough
[46:55] so what if this week a child will come
[46:59] to the age of
[47:02] accountability and that last one might
[47:05] not be a 40 year old man or a 50 year
[47:07] old man maybe it's a nine or 10 year old
[47:09] little boy or little
[47:11] girl and the presence of God will deal
[47:13] with their
[47:14] hearts wouldn't that be awesome it would
[47:17] be
[47:18] awesome
[47:21] [Music]
[47:23] sorry I personally don't want to say
[47:25] anybody lost you I don't want to say
[47:27] nobody go to hell let's do everything we
[47:30] can to reach those that are
[47:34] redeemable Romans chapter 7 verse
[47:39] one I want to speak to you again today
[47:41] on the right to be
[47:44] married to
[47:47] God know you not brethren for I speak to
[47:50] them that know the
[47:52] law how that the law hasth dominion over
[47:55] a man as long as he liveth for the woman
[48:00] which hath an husband is bound by the
[48:02] law to her husband so long as he
[48:06] liveth but if the husband be dead she is
[48:08] loosed from the
[48:10] law of her
[48:12] husband so then if while her husband
[48:14] liveth she be married to another man she
[48:19] shall be called an
[48:21] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[48:24] she is free from the law
[48:28] from that law so that she is no
[48:30] adulterous though she be married to
[48:33] another
[48:34] man wherefore my
[48:36] brethren ye also are become dead to the
[48:40] law by the body of Christ that you
[48:44] should be married
[48:46] to another married to another even to
[48:53] him what an honor who is raised raed
[48:57] from the
[48:58] dead that we should bring forth fruit so
[49:03] now we're talking about a
[49:05] marriage and then Paul says so that once
[49:08] we are married to him we should not be
[49:12] fruitless or
[49:14] Barren but that we should bring forth
[49:18] fruit unto
[49:21] God may the Lord bless his word you may
[49:24] be seated
[49:28] let me read the quote that I've been
[49:30] sharing with you for a couple of weeks
[49:31] from invisible Union Paul here is giving
[49:33] an illustration in her scripture about
[49:36] the law and Grace and illustrating it
[49:38] like marriage and divorce this passage
[49:41] is very seldom preached on because it
[49:43] more or less pertains to like marriage
[49:46] and divorce but it also pertains to a
[49:49] greater portion of marriage and divorce
[49:54] of how that he's trying to set in order
[49:56] that we as a church now I believe also
[50:00] it is to my belief it unfolds one of the
[50:04] great mysteries of Prophecy so one of
[50:09] the great Mysteries of the last day is
[50:12] the greater portion of marriage and
[50:15] divorce so it's not just about men and
[50:18] women getting married and and all of
[50:20] that but it is also about Christ being
[50:24] able to achieve a bride that would move
[50:27] Beyond just religion move Beyond
[50:31] organized systems of man led by man
[50:34] called by man put together by man
[50:37] orchestrated by man and it would be a
[50:39] body that he himself would step inside
[50:44] that body now individually we are
[50:47] baptized collectively into the body of
[50:50] Christ so we don't all get the Holy
[50:52] Ghost at one time we don't all grow at
[50:54] the same rate we don't all even in feed
[50:57] at the same time and sometimes on the
[50:59] same amount same amount of food but we
[51:02] are individually baptized collectively
[51:06] into the body of God this like every
[51:09] other special event down through time it
[51:13] requires a special manifestation of God
[51:18] now we know that there's been different
[51:20] times down to the ages by which God
[51:23] would do great Supernatural things and
[51:26] it would be like a changing of a
[51:29] dispensation when everything runs normal
[51:31] as we'd say and it may go that way for a
[51:34] long time 50 years 100 years 200 years
[51:37] and then all of a sudden God will appear
[51:40] on the scene in an abnormal unusual way
[51:45] sometimes he sends an Angel sometimes it
[51:48] would be a theophonic
[51:50] appearance of Christ himself before the
[51:54] Incarnate body of Flesh was brought on
[51:57] the earth other times it would be a
[51:59] supernatural manifestation of the father
[52:03] appearing in the form of lights or fire
[52:06] or a visible manifestation of God and
[52:10] whenever we look then at the last days
[52:13] if this is what we believe it is one of
[52:16] the great mysteries of Prophecy it would
[52:18] lead us to believe that this will also
[52:22] require a special manifestation of God
[52:26] to reveal himself in a way that would be
[52:30] quite unusual from the way that he's
[52:33] done before so we could go back in the
[52:35] time of manoah and his wife and God is
[52:38] fixing to send a deliver by the name of
[52:41] Samson and we can see that an angel of
[52:43] the Lord comes and wondrously performs a
[52:47] very unusual appearance there before mon
[52:51] Noah and his wife we could also go back
[52:53] to Moses of course in the burning bush
[52:55] we could go to Gideon we could go to
[52:58] different various times when the Lord
[53:01] appeared in such a way and sometimes
[53:04] depending upon the seriousness of the
[53:07] cause God would choose whichever
[53:10] administrative spirit that would be able
[53:13] to most definitely meet the need of that
[53:16] age now remember when God sends an angel
[53:19] it's for a specific need so God would
[53:22] send Gabriel from time to time and then
[53:25] God sent wormwood at the anti deluvian
[53:29] destruction God sends different ones
[53:32] because when we see that Angelic
[53:34] presence it's not just here in a body
[53:36] form but it's releasing something so
[53:39] when Daniel was there and he was praying
[53:42] and seeking God and God sent an angel
[53:45] down we remember reading the scripture
[53:47] and that angel was detained by a war
[53:51] then the the angel of God was able to
[53:52] break loose and another one came and he
[53:55] was able to come and give Daniel this
[53:57] great message of what he needed but it
[53:59] wasn't just an understanding of
[54:02] scripture alone but it was the releasing
[54:06] of an anointing something that would
[54:08] help them to be able to take the message
[54:11] that God gave and be able to live it now
[54:14] you see whenever God reveals a greater
[54:17] portion of his word it's not just like
[54:19] God shines the light on a certain
[54:22] portion of the scripture and then people
[54:24] look at oh oh okay yeah wow wow I see
[54:26] that my that's that's wonderful but
[54:28] there must be a release in the
[54:31] Supernatural to be able to anoint the
[54:34] people to live what they have seen if
[54:37] not they'll try to take the same kind of
[54:40] life and the same kind of experience and
[54:43] all that produces is a carnal
[54:45] impersonation but God releases with that
[54:49] a special anointing there has to be
[54:52] because God knows exactly how we are now
[54:55] we're talking about then a marriage in
[54:58] the last days by which the bride of
[55:01] Christ will come through all of these
[55:03] systems now in the early church they did
[55:06] not need this special type of anointing
[55:09] because it was the age of the personal
[55:12] life of Christ revealed in the first
[55:16] church age so God revealed the anointing
[55:19] in that age and it was the personal life
[55:22] of Christ and it anointed them to be
[55:24] able to preach the gospel live their
[55:27] lives not only that but give their lives
[55:30] in this then we move from that to
[55:32] another church age then a seal was open
[55:35] trumpet sounded seal tore off it
[55:37] released a mystery but also released the
[55:41] life or the anointing to help the people
[55:44] in that day how could the people be able
[55:47] to stand by and watch their children be
[55:49] taken from them how could husbands watch
[55:52] their wives be killed how could mothers
[55:55] and father s watch their children be
[55:58] beheaded and all that they did how could
[56:00] they do that with just the scripture No
[56:03] the scripture plus a special anointing
[56:07] that would release and anoint them to
[56:10] help them to be able to do it cuz
[56:11] remember they were not superhumans they
[56:14] were humans just like us how is God ever
[56:18] going to help them to do it he must
[56:20] release an anointing that would anoint
[56:23] them individuals to receive the message
[56:25] of that day and help them to live it I
[56:28] believe we need the same thing don't you
[56:31] so then we look at the culmination of
[56:34] seven Church ages and we've got
[56:36] thousands of denominations when the
[56:38] prophet was here there was 900 and
[56:41] something but now there's multiplied
[56:44] thousands of them all types of different
[56:47] religions around the world and of course
[56:50] every one of them say they are the way
[56:53] they have a special Enlightenment they
[56:55] have a special
[56:56] understanding so they claim if not why
[56:59] not just have one major Church in every
[57:01] city and everybody go to that church and
[57:04] everybody just believe the same thing
[57:06] but every church with whatever name
[57:08] that's tacked onto it is an
[57:11] identification of someone who feels like
[57:14] they have a special something different
[57:16] than every other church that you pass to
[57:19] come here this morning is that right if
[57:21] not why not just shut this one down and
[57:24] shut down every other one and will All
[57:26] Join one great big gigantic mega church
[57:30] because if we all believe the same thing
[57:32] all go to the same place and we're all
[57:34] carrying out the same Divine Purpose of
[57:36] God what's the use in having a whole
[57:38] bunch of different ones let's just all
[57:40] be the same thing but of course we know
[57:43] we are not the same now because the
[57:46] devil wants to project that doesn't mean
[57:48] that we believe it because we know God
[57:51] is always a separationist that God
[57:54] separates his people not from other
[57:57] people so much but from sin and unbelief
[58:01] now that's the way we believe the gospel
[58:04] so in this day through all the theology
[58:07] all the hierarchy of religion all the
[58:10] nonsense that God knew would be in the
[58:12] last days there will have to be not only
[58:15] certain scriptures that would
[58:17] prophetically apply to this hour such as
[58:21] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 1-7
[58:25] revelation
[58:26] 3:14 uh Zechariah 14 different
[58:30] scriptures that would pertain to the
[58:32] last day but there must also be an
[58:35] anointing that would come on the earth
[58:38] to help those people who live in this
[58:41] hour to help call them out from all the
[58:44] rest of these systems now remember
[58:46] there'll be more in this last age than
[58:49] has ever been before of all the
[58:52] different religions and systems of the
[58:54] world but it won't just be an anointing
[58:58] that will make them shout and rejoice
[59:01] and be happy and all that because a lot
[59:04] of religions of the world do that and we
[59:06] certainly are not the only one that even
[59:09] has Miracles and signs and wonders
[59:12] there's many religions that do that so
[59:15] it can't be that alone and yet we do
[59:18] believe in that it cannot just be that
[59:20] our music is nice and our singers are
[59:23] nice and we've got a nice place to come
[59:26] because there's people that have a whole
[59:27] lot better music than we do a whole lot
[59:29] nicer place than we do so what is it
[59:32] going to be that is going to make the
[59:35] people of this day called what we
[59:37] believe to be the bride that is going to
[59:40] make them different than all the rest of
[59:42] the religions and the churches well it
[59:45] must be a supernatural manifestation
[59:48] will it be a profit only will it be just
[59:52] special ministry will it be special meal
[59:56] that God has given a great insight and
[59:59] somehow they will understand more than
[1:00:02] other men will it be a a special type of
[1:00:05] ability that maybe they will have above
[1:00:08] others nope none of the above now God
[1:00:11] will use men of course and God will
[1:00:14] anoint men but God is not going to allow
[1:00:18] this to be carried out by men only you
[1:00:22] see in this end time it must have been a
[1:00:27] special need for a special anointing and
[1:00:31] it cannot be just the anointing on an
[1:00:34] ordinary human being it cannot be the
[1:00:37] anointing just upon ordinary people that
[1:00:41] are struggling and trying to move along
[1:00:44] trying to do the best they can and try
[1:00:46] to hold out to the end no there must be
[1:00:49] something really
[1:00:52] Supernatural now what it is it's the
[1:00:55] divine
[1:00:56] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:00:59] son of man himself which is more than
[1:01:04] just a Revival it is more than just a
[1:01:08] group of people getting together with a
[1:01:10] bunch of Creeds and Theology and ideas
[1:01:13] and deciding to form a a special group
[1:01:15] or a special church but it must be
[1:01:18] something that the Lord God will declare
[1:01:21] himself and we know that there's been a
[1:01:24] handful of these events down through
[1:01:27] time whenever God himself would actually
[1:01:32] slip down on the earth and would
[1:01:35] intervene himself we know of course it
[1:01:38] had happened in the time of Abraham when
[1:01:41] God was going to destroy Sodom and
[1:01:44] before he destroys Sodom he appears to
[1:01:47] his prophet Abraham is that right so it
[1:01:50] was what was this
[1:01:53] manifestation it was a Supernatural
[1:01:57] manifestation of the Eternal himself but
[1:02:01] what he did he simply took the elements
[1:02:05] of the Earth the 16 elements and he blew
[1:02:08] into them and Ste into a body that could
[1:02:12] eat a calf sandwich and drink milk and
[1:02:15] be able to have his feet washed he also
[1:02:19] blew two more bodies and two angels of
[1:02:22] God one stepped into one and one stepped
[1:02:25] into the other now this was a great
[1:02:28] change Abraham had had all types of
[1:02:30] events in his life but now something
[1:02:33] great must be fixing to happen and this
[1:02:38] appearing theophonic appearing of God
[1:02:42] not in a form of a fire not in a form of
[1:02:45] a bush but a theophany in a man the
[1:02:50] opony in human flesh now notice what did
[1:02:55] this
[1:02:56] forun it
[1:02:58] forun Abraham and Sarah's bodies being
[1:03:03] changed now God never done this of
[1:03:06] course whenever he calls him out of of
[1:03:09] Mesopotamia God does not do this even
[1:03:12] when he backslides and goes down to the
[1:03:14] land of Egypt God does not do it at
[1:03:16] other times but this was a special time
[1:03:20] that required a special anointing and
[1:03:24] God didn't just send them two angels oh
[1:03:27] my angels are profound it's amazing what
[1:03:30] angels can do but there's certain things
[1:03:33] that God Saves for himself you hearing
[1:03:36] me this morning now in this it was the
[1:03:40] the visible
[1:03:42] manifestation of the son of man now the
[1:03:46] son of man is a special entity of God
[1:03:51] it's different from the burning bush
[1:03:53] it's different of course than just a
[1:03:55] pillar of Fire Light smoke different
[1:03:58] manifestations by which the presence of
[1:04:01] God has been revealed but it is him
[1:04:05] revealing himself in a prophet form
[1:04:09] Prophet form now listen every time the
[1:04:13] manifestation of the son of man would
[1:04:16] appear on the earth it's always attached
[1:04:20] to a prophetic message that something
[1:04:23] needs to be revealed in the New
[1:04:26] Testament we would know it in the term
[1:04:29] as the
[1:04:30] Messianic sign now listen the Messianic
[1:04:35] sign the Messianic sign and the ministry
[1:04:38] of the son of man are not one of the
[1:04:42] nine spiritual gifts in the book of
[1:04:46] Corinthians now listen carefully let me
[1:04:49] say it again the Messianic sign is not
[1:04:53] one of the nine spiritual gifts in the
[1:04:56] book of Corinthians Faith Miracles
[1:04:59] healings word of knowledge word of
[1:05:00] wisdom so on and so on it is a special
[1:05:05] manifestation of God that's quite unlike
[1:05:09] anything else it will be so unique that
[1:05:14] God himself will be the only one that
[1:05:17] can perform it amen now he can create
[1:05:21] himself a body or if he chooses he can
[1:05:25] able to step
[1:05:27] inside of another human's body which was
[1:05:31] actually brought forth by natural births
[1:05:35] doesn't make any difference to him just
[1:05:36] a special manifestation but the thing is
[1:05:39] it's the revealing of the son of man in
[1:05:43] a body of Flesh now God himself called
[1:05:46] Ezekiel son of man and it was absolutely
[1:05:49] essential that he himself coming in the
[1:05:52] New Testament must call himself the son
[1:05:55] of man who do men say I the son of man
[1:05:59] not Son of God but who do men say I the
[1:06:02] son of man am so in the last days this
[1:06:07] will require a special manifestation
[1:06:10] again of the son of man why because of
[1:06:15] all the religions and all the demons
[1:06:18] that's going to be released Out of Hell
[1:06:20] will produce such a power of deception
[1:06:24] without the people of God having a
[1:06:26] special anointing to pull them it would
[1:06:30] be so close it would deceive the very
[1:06:33] elected if possible now say the first
[1:06:36] church age under the administration of
[1:06:39] the first church Angel Paul did not need
[1:06:43] the personal presence of the son of man
[1:06:46] to to be able to influence that church
[1:06:49] age as bad as the second Church age
[1:06:52] third fourth fifth sixth on down as bad
[1:06:56] as it was they did not need the son of
[1:06:59] man to come down and call out the bride
[1:07:03] but the seventh Church age would be so
[1:07:06] horrible and the Darkness would be so
[1:07:09] severe and Satan would be going about to
[1:07:13] deceive even the very elected if it were
[1:07:17] possible God himself had to come down in
[1:07:21] the form of the son of man and not only
[1:07:25] give scriptures but to release a special
[1:07:29] anointing on the bride in the last days
[1:07:33] that would help her beyond what any of
[1:07:37] the other ages needed to be helped by
[1:07:41] now do you understand by this very
[1:07:43] manifestation it shows us how dark that
[1:07:46] it really is but it ought to make us
[1:07:48] rejoice as
[1:07:50] well now let me read this to you and
[1:07:53] proving his word Jesus said I said was
[1:07:55] in the days of Sodom now watch close in
[1:07:58] the days of Sodom so will it be in the
[1:08:00] coming of the son of man when the son of
[1:08:02] man is being reveal not no more as a
[1:08:05] church see not no more uh the bride is
[1:08:09] called in the day when the son of man
[1:08:12] will be revealed what why is the son of
[1:08:16] man being revealed to join the church to
[1:08:20] the Head unite the marriage of the Bride
[1:08:26] now this could have been done under the
[1:08:28] administration of Paul in the first
[1:08:31] church age because Paul tells us that he
[1:08:34] had presented them as a Chase virgin to
[1:08:37] Christ so the son of man the
[1:08:40] manifestation of the son of man was not
[1:08:43] needed in the Ephesian age now you look
[1:08:46] around you didn't see any churches back
[1:08:48] there in the first church age called
[1:08:50] Baptist Methodist Church of God unarian
[1:08:52] Church of Christ Presbyterian Catholic
[1:08:55] honor and on and on and on there were no
[1:08:57] such a thing so the deception of
[1:09:00] Christianity had only started in its
[1:09:03] infant stage so they did not need this
[1:09:07] type of manifestation Everybody follow
[1:09:09] me this morning to be able to see
[1:09:12] because the the Perpetual darkness that
[1:09:15] Satan was going to produce in such a way
[1:09:18] it had not yet been founded the Devil
[1:09:19] Himself was just learning how to do this
[1:09:22] in the first church age same with the
[1:09:24] second third fourth and sixth but in the
[1:09:27] seventh it's going to be so horrible
[1:09:30] it's going to be so bad that the prophet
[1:09:34] talking about gifts from God and he said
[1:09:38] that Satan can
[1:09:40] impersonate everyone of those gifts from
[1:09:43] the Lord amen and it would be so close
[1:09:47] in the last days it would deceive the
[1:09:50] very elect if possible I personally
[1:09:53] believe that's also a prophetic
[1:09:54] utterance that was never applied in such
[1:09:57] strength as it is in this hour now what
[1:10:01] he said what's what's this son of man
[1:10:03] for to join the church to the Hedge and
[1:10:05] not the marriage of the Bride now notice
[1:10:08] what will happen the bridegroom call
[1:10:12] will come right through this the
[1:10:16] bridegroom call will come right through
[1:10:20] this when the son of man will come down
[1:10:25] Lord God and come in human flesh to
[1:10:30] unite the
[1:10:32] two
[1:10:34] together so the bridegroom call will
[1:10:38] come through the
[1:10:39] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:10:41] son of man I realize that many
[1:10:43] theologians for years taking Matthew 24
[1:10:47] also Luke 17 and other scriptures that
[1:10:51] pertain to the last day and they tried
[1:10:54] to take and put it all together as it
[1:10:56] was in referring to the coming of the
[1:10:59] Lord Jesus and the Lord tells us
[1:11:02] remember Lot's wife remember Lot's wife
[1:11:06] isn't it amazing that Jesus there when
[1:11:09] he says Luke 17:28 and remember Lot's
[1:11:13] wife then he goes on to tell us as it
[1:11:15] was in the days of Sodom thus shall it
[1:11:18] be in the day when the son of man is
[1:11:20] being revealed not
[1:11:23] comes not corporal
[1:11:26] coming different word altoe when the son
[1:11:29] of man now remember friends this is not
[1:11:32] a bunch of nonsense I'm making up in my
[1:11:35] mind I'm telling you the words of the
[1:11:37] Lord Jesus Jesus was the one that said
[1:11:40] the son of man would be revealed in the
[1:11:44] last day but yet in the bride coming or
[1:11:47] the Rapture coming of Christ the world
[1:11:50] will never even see him because where he
[1:11:53] hangs there suspended in the the heavens
[1:11:56] and we rise from our home he lives his
[1:11:58] home and there we meet in the middle but
[1:12:01] when the son of man is going to be
[1:12:03] revealed isn't it amazing that he gives
[1:12:05] us the warning of Lot's Li wife before
[1:12:09] he tells us of the manifestation of the
[1:12:12] son of man remember Lot's wife I found
[1:12:16] it astounding he never did tell us
[1:12:18] remember Sarah remember Rebecca remember
[1:12:22] Rachel remember Solomon's mother
[1:12:25] remember remember but he tells us
[1:12:28] remember Lot's wife and then he tells us
[1:12:32] why we should remember her and then he
[1:12:35] gives us the revealing of the son of man
[1:12:40] so it was prior to Lot's wife
[1:12:44] destruction right over the hill where
[1:12:47] the son of man had made himself known to
[1:12:51] Abraham now lot did not see the son of
[1:12:54] man but Abraham did he come down and
[1:12:58] talked to him in the form of a human
[1:13:01] being and what did he do he gave him a
[1:13:06] promise by this time next year Sarah
[1:13:10] will have a son what is it prop
[1:13:13] prophesying prophetic word Discerning
[1:13:17] Sarah's heart in the tent now remember
[1:13:21] Sarah was in the tent he did not see her
[1:13:24] he did not not hear her physically but
[1:13:27] he said why did Sarah life Sarah said
[1:13:30] how did life he said yes you did
[1:13:34] life you imagine calling God a liar to
[1:13:40] his
[1:13:42] face but you do know why God couldn't
[1:13:46] kill her don't you her husband had a
[1:13:48] covenant was God sir a't it amazing
[1:13:52] Lot's wife could be turned to a pill of
[1:13:55] salt she never called God a liar she
[1:13:59] never withstood God to his face she
[1:14:01] simply turned back to hear the the cries
[1:14:05] of her grandchildren in Sodom as they
[1:14:08] were burning up in the flames and God
[1:14:11] turned her to a pillar of salt why her
[1:14:14] husband had no Covenant with
[1:14:18] God so after the manifestation of the
[1:14:22] son of man then Lord 's wife which had
[1:14:27] hung around the message for a long
[1:14:31] time remember lot and his wife we don't
[1:14:35] even know what her name is so apparently
[1:14:37] must not be significant but lot and his
[1:14:40] wife and their children their daughters
[1:14:42] had walked with the prophet's message
[1:14:45] they had stayed with the prophet's
[1:14:48] message for several years until light
[1:14:51] looked down toward the well-watered
[1:14:54] plains and it reminded him of Egypt you
[1:14:57] see Abraham had backslid years before
[1:15:00] this and lot went with him and where did
[1:15:02] they go they went to the land of Egypt
[1:15:05] and Egypt made an imprint so much on lot
[1:15:10] that he never got over it so as he
[1:15:12] looked toward the well-watered plains
[1:15:15] that was laying there toward solom and
[1:15:17] gamar and the five cities that were
[1:15:19] there and he sees and it reminds him of
[1:15:23] what he saw in the land of EG Egypt he
[1:15:25] does not consult the prophet he does not
[1:15:28] go and say Abraham my uncle you know I'm
[1:15:32] thinking about going here and you know
[1:15:34] doing this and that and the other what
[1:15:36] do you think lead me help me to know
[1:15:38] exactly what to do he doesn't apparently
[1:15:40] considered essential for him so he makes
[1:15:43] up his mind and they go down there into
[1:15:46] the land of Sodom and God never went to
[1:15:49] Sodom but God sent two angels to Sodom
[1:15:53] Sodom never received
[1:15:55] the manifestation of the son of man but
[1:15:59] it was Abraham and under the opes of
[1:16:03] this administration of the son of man
[1:16:05] now watch what the son of man Ministry
[1:16:07] does it's always prophetic and with it
[1:16:12] is a supernatural discernment You Follow
[1:16:16] Me Now what so the bridegroom call will
[1:16:19] come right through this when the son of
[1:16:20] man will come down and come in human
[1:16:23] flesh to unite the two together together
[1:16:25] the church has to be the word he is the
[1:16:28] word and the two unites together and to
[1:16:32] do that it will take the
[1:16:35] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:16:38] son of
[1:16:39] man not a
[1:16:42] clergyman I don't know do you see what I
[1:16:45] mean see it's the son of
[1:16:47] man Jesus Christ will come down in human
[1:16:53] flesh Among Us
[1:16:55] amen now you see take the words of the
[1:16:58] Lord Jesus in Luke 17 thus shall it be
[1:17:01] in the day when the son of man is
[1:17:04] revealed
[1:17:06] apocalypsis which means take the cover
[1:17:09] off oh only the elect will be able to
[1:17:14] look at what God has done in this hour
[1:17:18] some will look at the veil and make God
[1:17:21] out of the veil others will look beyond
[1:17:24] the Veil and know that it's the son of
[1:17:27] man hiding in
[1:17:29] humanity well I hope somebody's sharing
[1:17:31] me this morning and don't just get St
[1:17:34] stuck on the messenger that God used to
[1:17:37] initiate the bridegroom call but God
[1:17:40] wants you and I to realize it's also
[1:17:43] still ongoing in the sense of us
[1:17:46] carrying the exact same message of the
[1:17:49] bridegroom the remember the call is not
[1:17:53] the Malachi for call
[1:17:55] it is not the prophet called we're not
[1:17:57] called to marry the prophet of the age
[1:18:00] we're not called to marry a pastor come
[1:18:02] on somebody we're not called to marry
[1:18:05] some clergyman or some preacher we're
[1:18:08] called to marry Jesus Christ the son of
[1:18:14] man Oh my he will come down in human
[1:18:17] flesh Among Us and make his word notice
[1:18:19] what he's going to do he he's going to
[1:18:21] make his words so real
[1:18:25] he's going to make his word so real that
[1:18:29] it will unite the church and
[1:18:34] him as
[1:18:37] one so he's going to make his word so
[1:18:41] real in our services in our move and our
[1:18:46] hearts and our home he is going to make
[1:18:50] his word so real that it will produce a
[1:18:55] supernatural uniting time and
[1:18:58] Son now notice what he's going to do it
[1:19:01] isn't just going to anoint us to heal
[1:19:03] the sick it isn't just going to anoint
[1:19:06] us to have signs and wonders and it will
[1:19:08] do that but it is going to anoint us on
[1:19:12] the greatest phase of the bride's
[1:19:14] Revival and that is it will bring us and
[1:19:18] him together by making the words so real
[1:19:23] that within itself produces the uniting
[1:19:27] time and sign it ain't no wonder to me
[1:19:30] the devil hates this message it ain't no
[1:19:32] wonder to me that he wants preachers to
[1:19:34] stop preaching it and just say well you
[1:19:37] know now everybody's streaming their
[1:19:39] services and and we're on YouTube and
[1:19:41] we're here and there so we can't we
[1:19:43] can't no longer preach this stuff and I
[1:19:45] get to a place that I can no longer
[1:19:47] preach this stuff it's time for me to go
[1:19:50] off YouTube it's time for me to go off
[1:19:53] Instagram and all the come on somebody
[1:19:56] brother it ain't a time to hus preaching
[1:19:58] it it's a time to Herald it from the
[1:20:01] rooftop and let people know we're under
[1:20:04] the
[1:20:05] administration of the son of man himself
[1:20:08] Christ Jesus but Brother Don the prophet
[1:20:11] is gone I agree with that he is gone but
[1:20:14] Christ Jesus is still here Among Us and
[1:20:17] he's not just at Word of Life he is
[1:20:20] around the world getting a bride ready
[1:20:23] filling her with a baptism of the Holy
[1:20:26] Ghost and wanting to CP to her and make
[1:20:29] love to her and doing so if he can get
[1:20:32] her to harmonize with him and she will
[1:20:35] see his word under his own personal
[1:20:39] presence his own personal presence of
[1:20:42] the anointing of the son of man it will
[1:20:46] make her one with him and there ain't
[1:20:49] enough devils in hell that will ever
[1:20:52] pull her away from that one
[1:20:55] [Applause]
[1:21:00] so Jesus Christ will come down in human
[1:21:02] flesh Among Us and will make his word so
[1:21:05] real make his word so real that it'll
[1:21:08] unite the church and him as one the
[1:21:11] bride then she'll go
[1:21:13] home to the wedding supper amen she's
[1:21:17] already united we go to the wedding
[1:21:20] supper not the
[1:21:21] [Music]
[1:21:23] marriage amen
[1:21:26] there's people sitting in this building
[1:21:28] today that are already
[1:21:32] married to almighty
[1:21:36] God
[1:21:37] hallelujah already righty
[1:21:42] married to almighty
[1:21:46] God then he quotes part of the scripture
[1:21:49] there in Revelation fill your flesh of
[1:21:51] the Mighty Men cuz the marriage of the
[1:21:52] Lamb has come but the
[1:21:56] Rapture is
[1:21:58] going to the wedding Supper The Rapture
[1:22:01] is not us getting
[1:22:04] married don't you understand the son of
[1:22:07] man his presence is here it's not just a
[1:22:11] repeat of Pentecost it's not a repeat of
[1:22:16] 1906 they did not get the promise of the
[1:22:19] son of man on Aza
[1:22:22] street but we did
[1:22:26] I said we did but after the restoration
[1:22:29] of the gifts come with a Pentecostal
[1:22:32] message the Lord Jesus knew it would be
[1:22:35] so close and so deceiving he couldn't
[1:22:37] send just a church Angel he couldn't
[1:22:40] send just a man with a message but he
[1:22:42] said I've got to go down myself I've got
[1:22:45] to go Oh Glory I've got to go down
[1:22:48] myself and take human instrumentality
[1:22:52] don't let that stumble you
[1:22:57] if the Lord God could pick up dust out
[1:22:59] of the earth and step into that dust why
[1:23:02] would you struggle with God been able to
[1:23:04] use a human being's
[1:23:07] body it shows you the power of the
[1:23:12] blood but the Rapture is going to the
[1:23:15] wedding supper when the
[1:23:18] word here unites with the
[1:23:22] person and they to become
[1:23:26] one glory and then when what does it
[1:23:31] then it manifests the son of man
[1:23:36] again not the church
[1:23:39] theologians the son of man you
[1:23:42] understand when you and I become one
[1:23:44] with this word we're still acting out
[1:23:48] the
[1:23:49] Fulfillment of the son of man himself
[1:23:51] because we heard the word and it was so
[1:23:54] real to us when we heard it we United
[1:23:57] with him and a bond was made for
[1:24:01] eternity Oh
[1:24:03] Glory the word and the church becomes
[1:24:06] one whatever the son of man done he was
[1:24:11] the word the church does the same
[1:24:15] thing well Glory so what was this
[1:24:20] manifestation then of the son of man it
[1:24:24] was called many different things it was
[1:24:28] the life son it was the Messianic son it
[1:24:34] was in one sense the coming of the Lord
[1:24:38] no one knew that was the minute or the
[1:24:41] hour that Christ would
[1:24:44] come as he revealed it to
[1:24:49] us but you see people were looking for a
[1:24:52] visible manifestation I'm not saying
[1:24:54] there wasn't a
[1:24:55] manifestation there was yeah and it was
[1:24:58] actually visible amen yes it was look
[1:25:02] like a
[1:25:04] head look like a head well praise the
[1:25:08] Lord look like a head out there in the
[1:25:11] west oh Hallelujah to God formed the W
[1:25:15] the Angels formed the wig over the
[1:25:19] revealed son of man and if you notice
[1:25:23] whenever the prophet and the voice told
[1:25:25] him turn it to the right turn it to the
[1:25:27] right I think I had it to the right turn
[1:25:29] it to the right and when he did he said
[1:25:31] there he was Christ in all his glory so
[1:25:36] the head was there oh my goodness the
[1:25:39] head appeared there and the angels
[1:25:42] formed that wig he was glory to God what
[1:25:46] was he doing look at the way the head
[1:25:48] was positioned so the head was not
[1:25:51] looking back up toward Heaven the head
[1:25:54] was not looking this way or that way but
[1:25:56] the head was looking down to the Earth
[1:25:59] what's he looking for it's the son of
[1:26:02] man Glory the son of man come looking
[1:26:06] for his bride where are you honey where
[1:26:10] are you sweetheart where are you he
[1:26:13] found some of us in the Church of God he
[1:26:16] found some of us in a barroom he found
[1:26:19] some of us in a honky Tong but brother
[1:26:21] there won't be one of them that will be
[1:26:24] lost because the head come down looking
[1:26:28] for the
[1:26:29] [Applause]
[1:26:39] body proving his word in Los Angeles
[1:26:42] remember Abraham and his
[1:26:44] group never received one more sign from
[1:26:47] God until the promised son arrived how
[1:26:50] many knows that's true and the
[1:26:52] congregation said amen
[1:26:55] yes that sign of discernment and the
[1:26:58] Royal Seed of Abraham let me tell you
[1:27:02] thus sayith the
[1:27:04] Lord you're receiving your last
[1:27:10] son thank
[1:27:13] you neither we believe this or we don't
[1:27:17] this is why I'm not looking for some
[1:27:20] super preacher I'm not looking for some
[1:27:24] mega church well don't get quiet on me
[1:27:27] now according to the words of a
[1:27:30] Vindicated Prophet we have
[1:27:34] already received our last
[1:27:38] son now will we look at Israel of course
[1:27:41] is that a sign yes but notice that's
[1:27:44] World signs that's World signs Israel
[1:27:49] what's going on out here our sign is not
[1:27:52] Israel so much our sign is not the mark
[1:27:55] of the beast and the economy of this and
[1:27:57] that and the other our sign is our
[1:28:00] husband our sign is our husband that
[1:28:03] come down with an anointing to anoint us
[1:28:07] to live this message look friend it's
[1:28:11] not us trying to live right it's not us
[1:28:13] trying to make oursel do it it is the
[1:28:16] anointing of the Lord Jesus himself when
[1:28:20] he come he release an anointing on this
[1:28:23] Earth and there ain't enough powers in
[1:28:25] hell to stop the bride of Christ from
[1:28:28] manifesting what God ordained her to
[1:28:36] do thus sayith the Lord you're receiving
[1:28:41] your last sign that's according to the
[1:28:43] scriptures and the revelation of God
[1:28:46] that's in my heart that speaks this is
[1:28:49] the
[1:28:50] truth
[1:28:52] wow again he says look Look what Jesus
[1:28:55] said oh it just Thrills my soul as it
[1:28:59] was in the days of Noah so will it be at
[1:29:01] the coming of the son of man what did
[1:29:04] the angel do he had the spirit of
[1:29:09] discernment and he said as it was then
[1:29:12] so will it be when the son of man is
[1:29:15] being
[1:29:16] revealed from heaven now remember this
[1:29:19] is
[1:29:20] not one of the nine gifts of the Spirit
[1:29:24] Discerning of spirits according to Paul
[1:29:27] was one of the nine spiritual
[1:29:30] gifts that ain't what I'm talking about
[1:29:33] I'm talking about the son of man the
[1:29:37] word in human
[1:29:40] beings think of it in our midst now
[1:29:43] stands that same angel of
[1:29:47] God which is none other but the Lord
[1:29:50] Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy
[1:29:54] Holy
[1:29:55] Ghost it's in our midst he was God and
[1:29:59] that was his message just before the
[1:30:03] destruction came can't you see we need
[1:30:06] more than just shouting we need more
[1:30:10] than a return to isusa Street
[1:30:13] Pentecost look what that produced for
[1:30:15] them it didn't produce a Rapture for
[1:30:17] them how in the world can it produce one

[1:30:21] gifts if we believe the word we do but I

[1:33:29] million people around the

[1:33:47] else here doing the talking somebody
[1:33:50] else here doing the walking well Glory

[1:33:56] could stand up and speak in tongues and
[1:33:58] somebody interpret it according to the
[1:34:00] teaching of God's Prophet that's not
[1:34:02] even to be received by the church until
[1:34:05] three people with the Discerning of
[1:34:07] spirits on them has the ability to say
[1:34:10] that was the Lord that was the Lord come
[1:34:11] on children there ain't nobody stands
[1:34:14] before the son of man there ain't nobody
[1:34:17] that stands before Christ
[1:34:20] [Applause]
[1:34:22] Jesus I thank God for his prophet of
[1:34:25] Malachi
[1:34:27] 4 but to be
[1:34:29] honest I needed even more than
[1:34:33] that I thank God for every Godly holy
[1:34:36] message preacher that's preaching the
[1:34:39] truth but Harry I needed more than
[1:34:42] that I needed the son of man
[1:34:51] himself you'll never re receive another
[1:34:56] sign this is
[1:34:58] it thus saith the
[1:35:03] Lord would a prophet of God make a
[1:35:06] statement like that if it wasn't
[1:35:08] true you're receiving your greatest son
[1:35:13] and your last
[1:35:15] son before the
[1:35:17] appearing of
[1:35:20] Christ there's only one way that can be
[1:35:22] true
[1:35:24] is that the son of
[1:35:26] man was
[1:35:29] there in order to answer to the anti
[1:35:31] type of Abraham and
[1:35:33] Sarah that's the last sign they
[1:35:37] saw there might have been streaks across
[1:35:39] the sky there might have been Thunder
[1:35:41] there might have been lightning the mean
[1:35:42] might the moon might have looked pink
[1:35:44] and the sun might have looked orange
[1:35:45] everything said oh my there it is yeah
[1:35:48] oh praise the Lord praise the Lord yeah
[1:35:49] we look at that too but we've done had
[1:35:51] our greatest son
[1:35:56] come on children I'm not believeing any
[1:35:58] signs that God sent to the Earth but my
[1:36:01] greatest sign is not Russia oh I know
[1:36:05] they're talking World War II and they're
[1:36:07] talking this and that and the other what
[1:36:08] difference is that matter to me I've
[1:36:11] already received my greatest son and I
[1:36:13] have heard from that voice not the voice
[1:36:16] of a Kian not the voice of an illiterate
[1:36:19] preacher I heard Christ Jesus the son of
[1:36:22] man call I didn't hear William brandom
[1:36:25] I'm not hearing Donnie Reagan I hope
[1:36:27] you're hearing more than Donnie Reagan
[1:36:29] today I hope you're hearing more than
[1:36:31] Tim pro and the rest of these brothers
[1:36:33] that are preaching I hope you're hearing
[1:36:36] Jesus Christ calling you to that Oneness
[1:36:39] with himself lay aside the world lay
[1:36:42] aside everything that hinders you and
[1:36:45] become
[1:36:46] one was Christ Jesus
[1:36:57] remember I tell you in the name of the
[1:37:01] Lord if you regard me to be his
[1:37:05] servant this is the last
[1:37:08] sign the church will
[1:37:10] see according to the
[1:37:16] scripture that was the last thing that
[1:37:18] Abraham seen
[1:37:20] done before the promised son
[1:37:26] arrived
[1:37:28] Hallelujah and somebody
[1:37:31] said again spiritual Amnesia this is the
[1:37:35] last sign
[1:37:37] remember thus sayith the
[1:37:40] Lord did you ever hear me say that but
[1:37:42] what it was true you are seeing your
[1:37:46] last
[1:37:47] son that
[1:37:49] scripture you've seen your last sign
[1:37:56] Pentecost now Lance when we were still
[1:37:58] in it the last sign had done been
[1:38:01] seen yet we were jumping running
[1:38:04] shouting screaming holling glory to God
[1:38:06] glory to God glory to God glory to God
[1:38:07] glory to God glory to God glory to God
[1:38:12] what it's good to say glory to God but
[1:38:15] what am I glorying to God for well this
[1:38:17] is what I'm gloring to God for the son
[1:38:20] of man has come down in the end time the
[1:38:23] Lord Jesus borrowed a body a body that
[1:38:27] he Sanctified by his cleansing blood and
[1:38:30] was able to use that human anatomy to
[1:38:33] speak things that only the Lord God
[1:38:35] himself knew do you think a lot of these
[1:38:38] things that brother renon preached about
[1:38:39] was brother Brandon brother Brandon was
[1:38:41] not a smart man he was not an
[1:38:43] intellectual man God didn't need an
[1:38:45] intellectual man all he needed was a
[1:38:48] body huah was a body then God could
[1:38:52] speak through that man things that had
[1:38:55] never been uttered before and by doing
[1:38:57] so it would form an invisible Union
[1:39:00] between Christ and the bride and the
[1:39:03] bride would be so magnetized to him and
[1:39:06] the devil say say away stay away say
[1:39:07] away that's a cult that's a cult that's
[1:39:09] a call and the bride can't help us you
[1:39:11] just overcome oh oh Hallelujah here I go
[1:39:16] here I go oh it's a cult it's a cult

[1:50:58] rest of the hen houses around be sure
[1:51:00] and watch all of your

[1:51:06] [Applause]
[1:51:10] loose just want to warn you in case
[1:51:13] there might be another one sitting here
[1:51:15] and there and everywhere because there's
[1:51:18] something about that drawing power of
[1:51:20] that eagle
[1:51:23] it
[1:51:24] mesmerizes them
[1:51:28] Birds it actually changes their
[1:51:32] thinking and convinces them they can
[1:51:41] fly is anybody here convinced today
[1:51:44] beside me we can not only can we we
[1:51:50] shall we shall
[1:51:53] we shall be
[1:51:55] changed
[1:51:59] Hallelujah since I was a little
[1:52:02] boy I've dreamed about
[1:52:08] flying I'll be 68 in a couple
[1:52:11] months I've dreamed about it my whole
[1:52:14] life I don't have a pack on my back I
[1:52:18] don't have a suit
[1:52:20] on or respect
[1:52:24] but I just kind of take off running like
[1:52:26] this and I'm
[1:52:29] gone I figure somehow it must be
[1:52:32] embedded in My DNA
[1:52:36] maybe that I'm not a chicken after all
[1:52:40] GL
[1:52:42] Hallelujah aren't you glad you ain't a
[1:52:45] chicken after all but it took more than
[1:52:48] Miracles it took more than
[1:52:51] signs took the revealing of the son of
[1:52:57] man this is the LI sign remember thus
[1:53:01] sayeth the
[1:53:02] Lord did you ever hear me say that but
[1:53:05] what it was true you're seeing your Li
[1:53:06] sign that's scriptural you've seen your
[1:53:09] last
[1:53:11] son
[1:53:13] Pentecost
[1:53:15] bride you have seen
[1:53:18] yours The Living
[1:53:21] Word don't follow this person that
[1:53:24] person this move my goodness look at how
[1:53:25] many moves we have you understand what
[1:53:27] the issue has been for decades around
[1:53:29] our message the search for the Messiah
[1:53:33] is still
[1:53:36] on cuz people have not
[1:53:39] recognized who and what the Messiah
[1:53:44] is it's
[1:53:46] Christ it's not some preacher it's not
[1:53:49] some church it's not some great big move
[1:53:51] it's Christ Jesus
[1:53:53] Jus and his
[1:53:55] presence is
[1:53:58] unrecognized you imagine that little guy
[1:54:01] when he finally got up off the fence
[1:54:03] post and he got remember him never flew
[1:54:04] in his life he didn't know how to
[1:54:07] fly but he had to trust her he didn't
[1:54:11] how to bend his wings brother Jack to be
[1:54:12] able to cup them in order to catch the
[1:54:14] wind you know Eagle Eagle spends a whole
[1:54:17] lot more time soaring than he actually
[1:54:19] does exercising glory to God I'm a
[1:54:20] Christian Hallelujah I'll tell you one
[1:54:22] thing I'm that another but he knows how
[1:54:23] to set his
[1:54:25] wings brother sister that's where we
[1:54:27] need to be in this hour setting our
[1:54:29] wings in the Wind of the anointing of
[1:54:32] the son of man instead of you and I
[1:54:34] struggling trying to be this and trying
[1:54:36] to do that let's just go in the wings
[1:54:39] and set it in the Wind of the hour and
[1:54:42] you'll find out it ain't you no more it
[1:54:44] ain't your faithfulness no more it ain't
[1:54:46] me it ain't this man it ain't that man
[1:54:48] it's this son of man up here Jesus
[1:54:52] Christ CHR the
[1:54:59] [Applause]
[1:55:11] word you see but Satan tries to upset
[1:55:14] the
[1:55:15] bride with things to keep her from
[1:55:19] letting Christ being formed
[1:55:23] in her own
[1:55:25] being so whether it's Troubles of Life
[1:55:29] anxieties moves you know around us or
[1:55:32] this man or that man or this Doctrine or
[1:55:34] whatever more it's to try to keep Christ
[1:55:39] from being
[1:55:40] formed into the stage of maturity in our
[1:55:43] life we'll pick it up again Galatians
[1:55:46] 4:19 my little children of whom I
[1:55:48] travail in birth again I travailed in
[1:55:51] birth again so it had already
[1:55:53] happened but some things had attacked
[1:55:56] the galatian church what was it
[1:56:00] legalism it couldn't take Christ out of
[1:56:03] them but Satan found a way to keep the
[1:56:07] Christ from being formed into the
[1:56:09] fullness of what God wanted it to be the
[1:56:12] stature of a perfect man so get them
[1:56:15] sidetracked on this and get them
[1:56:17] sidetracked on that and sidetracked on
[1:56:19] something else so here they throw Paul
[1:56:22] back into this labor my little children
[1:56:24] of whom I travail notice he doesn't say
[1:56:27] Christ but I travail this is what Real
[1:56:30] Men of God go through they want you to
[1:56:34] be what Jesus has made you to
[1:56:37] be I'm not looking for any
[1:56:44] reganit you don't want to be me why
[1:56:47] would you settle to be like me when he
[1:56:50] wants you to be like him yes
[1:56:55] but Paul said I travail and birth again
[1:56:58] until Christ be formed in you so as a
[1:57:02] formless embryo by degrees takes the
[1:57:06] shape of a human
[1:57:10] being so the Christian by
[1:57:14] degrees starts taking the shape and the
[1:57:17] form of the perfect man and the perfect
[1:57:20] man is not you it's not me
[1:57:22] it's not you and I think well we'll get
[1:57:24] to a place we'll never make another
[1:57:25] mistake you'll never get to that place
[1:57:28] in this life the perfect man we're
[1:57:31] struggling for is not us anyway it's
[1:57:34] Christ
[1:57:36] Jesus so Paul sent legalism among the
[1:57:38] galatian Believers and what it did it
[1:57:41] reversed their growth in Christ Jesus
[1:57:43] and then it sent the man of God back
[1:57:45] into labor pain so he had to go back and
[1:57:48] and redeal with some of the very
[1:57:49] fundamental foundations of the faith you
[1:57:53] why because they listen to things they
[1:57:55] shouldn't listen
[1:57:57] to
[1:57:59] amen but as that embryo when the mother
[1:58:02] begins to
[1:58:03] grow and many of you have seen scans of
[1:58:06] your children and your grandchildren
[1:58:08] absolutely amazing a few weeks old and
[1:58:12] have that thumb stuck in its
[1:58:16] mouth it don't look like a dog or a cat
[1:58:19] or an airplane or a
[1:58:21] go-kart is taking on the image of a
[1:58:24] human
[1:58:25] being the galatian church had this
[1:58:28] Christ child being formed in
[1:58:32] them so he sent this legalism among them
[1:58:35] what he calls it to regress they would
[1:58:38] lose part of that imagery then they're
[1:58:40] fussing and fighting and arguing over
[1:58:42] who's got the biggest church and who's
[1:58:43] got the most important Ministry and all
[1:58:45] that stuff and it throw the man of God
[1:58:47] right back into this birth cycle again
[1:58:49] my little children of whom I travail in
[1:58:51] birth
[1:58:53] again
[1:58:55] again
[1:58:57] children how many times have you thrown
[1:59:01] me again and
[1:59:05] again and
[1:59:10] again but I love you with all of my
[1:59:12] heart and I am not giving up on you you
[1:59:16] hear me you hear me I am not giving up
[1:59:21] on you
[1:59:22] and don't you give up on
[1:59:24] me but Brother D I messed up so many
[1:59:27] times so what else is
[1:59:29] new so what do men of God do they do
[1:59:31] like Paul did he goes right back and he
[1:59:34] trails and if has to start at the Bottom
[1:59:36] Rung on faith and salvation
[1:59:38] predestination whatever he's got to do
[1:59:41] and he'll get them pass up that stage
[1:59:42] again and then the embryo will start
[1:59:44] taking on the very image of Christ not
[1:59:46] your pastor not your Prophet
[1:59:50] Christ amen
[1:59:53] till it becomes more and more
[1:59:57] defined till it starts looking
[1:59:59] like the Lord
[2:00:03] Jesus don't you love
[2:00:06] him let's bow our heads together if you
[2:00:14] would oh how many wants that in your
[2:00:16] heart that God can just help
[2:00:19] you that Christ Jesus can be seen from
[2:00:22] your
[2:00:24] soul don't stop at the embryo praise God
[2:00:28] praise God I got it I got it what you
[2:00:31] got was the
[2:00:32] start don't just Rejoice because of the
[2:00:36] start and then stop but keep
[2:00:40] growing to the image of the perfect
[2:00:43] man thank you
[2:00:46] Lord thank you Lord
[2:00:48] God so we can love like him we can
[2:00:51] forgive like like him we can move Beyond
[2:00:54] grudges we can forgive those that don't
[2:00:56] even ask us for forgiveness i't talking
[2:00:59] about just seen on the sick and casting
[2:01:01] out Devils I'm talking about living and
[2:01:03] acting and living and believing like
[2:01:05] Jesus
[2:01:07] Christ through the revealing of this
[2:01:11] word how many with me this morning say
[2:01:15] Lord that's what I want to
[2:01:17] be that's what I want to be Lord
[2:01:22] Heavenly
[2:01:25] Father oh dear
[2:01:29] Jesus this is what I want to be
[2:01:32] father help me
[2:01:35] Lord help
[2:01:38] me dear
[2:01:40] God mold me shape
[2:01:44] me this year Lord I've been preaching
[2:01:46] for 50
[2:01:48] years pastoring for 40
[2:01:52] what good does that do to come up to the
[2:01:55] end of the way and get sidetracked on
[2:01:56] this or that or the other some of these
[2:01:59] folks have been Christians for longer
[2:02:01] than I've been
[2:02:02] preaching but what good does that do any
[2:02:04] of us if we don't allow you to finish
[2:02:08] your
[2:02:10] work and as it was an impossibility as
[2:02:13] it seemed for Abraham and Sarah to be
[2:02:17] turned back to young men or young
[2:02:20] women this so it may seem that way to us
[2:02:26] today proving the providential mercy of
[2:02:30] God the Sarah didn't even believe it
[2:02:33] anyway a matter of fact your Prophet
[2:02:34] said she never
[2:02:37] did finally she received enough strength
[2:02:40] to conceive because she considered you
[2:02:45] Faithful but Abraham was way ahead of
[2:02:48] her but because she was part of
[2:02:50] Abraham you couldn't leave her
[2:02:53] out the Lord
[2:02:55] Jesus is way ahead of
[2:02:58] us but because we're part of him you
[2:03:02] can't leave us
[2:03:03] out thank you
[2:03:06] Father forgive us for our smirking
[2:03:09] forgive us of our laughing in the tent
[2:03:11] forgive us of our Humanity our
[2:03:15] shortcomings remember us Lord
[2:03:18] God may become more and more under the
[2:03:22] influence of what you have done in this
[2:03:24] day it's no wonder to me that Satan
[2:03:25] wants people to be so occupied with
[2:03:28] things of
[2:03:30] Life they don't listen to tapes no more
[2:03:32] they don't read books no more they'd
[2:03:35] rather read Instagram than read the
[2:03:38] future home they'd rather read Facebook
[2:03:42] than read the church
[2:03:44] ages but it ain't going to be Facebook
[2:03:47] that's going to unite us to the body
[2:03:50] change it's not going to be Instagram or
[2:03:53] this or that or the other it'll be us
[2:03:55] feeding on the word because as we feed
[2:03:57] on that word we actually become the word
[2:04:02] yeah somehow that little Eagle had to
[2:04:05] trust his
[2:04:07] mama he couldn't trust himself CU he'
[2:04:11] never flown
[2:04:12] before he couldn't trust his
[2:04:14] understanding he didn't understand
[2:04:16] it or his reasoning he had to trust her
[2:04:21] imagine as he flew off that fence post
[2:04:23] and got higher and higher in one way the
[2:04:26] more scared that he
[2:04:28] got but he had to
[2:04:31] believe that she could die faster as
[2:04:34] Brother David Siler said it here in that
[2:04:36] awesome sermon he brought to us
[2:04:38] Lord that that mother Eagle can fly down
[2:04:43] faster than them babies can
[2:04:46] fall praise
[2:04:49] God because they have been clocked at
[2:04:52] flying down at 200 miles an
[2:04:58] hour so Lord God you can fly down to
[2:05:01] rescue me faster than I can hit the
[2:05:05] ground may we by faith today Lord spread
[2:05:09] our
[2:05:10] wings maybe there's some that's sick and
[2:05:12] they need healing may they spread their
[2:05:16] wings may they flop Them Wings of Faith
[2:05:20] to the land
[2:05:22] of good health
[2:05:25] yes Lord God just as it happened here
[2:05:28] last
[2:05:29] Sunday at the end of the service Lord
[2:05:32] when you put it on my heart to speak
[2:05:35] those words to the
[2:05:38] church
[2:05:40] Hallelujah Lord several different ones
[2:05:43] hearing back from them and the anointing
[2:05:46] fell on their heart and something that
[2:05:47] had bothered them for years it fell
[2:05:50] around their feet that that day thank
[2:05:53] you Lord they walked out of here
[2:05:55] changed oh
[2:05:58] Jesus it's great as the discernment was
[2:06:02] yet looking at it yesterday I found
[2:06:03] where the Prophet said it several times
[2:06:06] over there is something greater than the
[2:06:10] discernment
[2:06:11] coming something greater than the
[2:06:16] discernment what was it he said it was
[2:06:19] the speaking
[2:06:21] of the
[2:06:23] word I'm so glad that the full
[2:06:26] manifestation did not stop with just the
[2:06:30] discernment since the one you used to
[2:06:32] discern is not
[2:06:34] here so before he left you went to the
[2:06:38] last
[2:06:40] phas which is not the discernment of a
[2:06:43] prophet Discerning and telling people
[2:06:44] this and that and the
[2:06:46] other but
[2:06:48] speaking the word
[2:06:51] most of us don't discern we don't have
[2:06:54] the ability to
[2:06:56] discern but Lord God if that word can
[2:06:58] become alive in our hearts and a son or
[2:07:01] of daughter of God can take that word
[2:07:03] and place it on their lips and speak the
[2:07:06] word it's the same as deity
[2:07:12] speaking
[2:07:15] oh
[2:07:19] Hallelujah May that anointing drop up
[2:07:21] here this morning
[2:07:24] Father and they've got a wered son a
[2:07:26] wavered daughter sickness and
[2:07:30] disease may they be able to speak to it
[2:07:32] today in the name of
[2:07:35] Jesus oh I know what a lot of preachers
[2:07:38] want some of these preachers want to be
[2:07:41] the one that'll speak the
[2:07:43] word so it can bring them all the credit
[2:07:45] and all the
[2:07:48] tribute but Lord God I pray you would
[2:07:50] let that fall in the hearts of
[2:07:53] mamas
[2:07:55] daddies maybe some teenagers here today
[2:07:57] are fighting besetting sins and they
[2:08:00] can't get the best of it may their word
[2:08:04] drop in their
[2:08:06] heart Hallelujah the Bible tells us in
[2:08:09] the Book of Psalms about
[2:08:11] Joseph the word of the Lord tried
[2:08:16] him until his word came
[2:08:23] so the word of the Lord tried him until
[2:08:27] his word
[2:08:29] came and then he took his word and could
[2:08:33] place it on his
[2:08:35] lips Lord
[2:08:38] Jesus no wonder the prophet said the
[2:08:40] power of God living in us today if we
[2:08:42] have the Holy Ghost we will call our own
[2:08:46] bodies from the dust of the Earth
[2:08:53] We Worship You
