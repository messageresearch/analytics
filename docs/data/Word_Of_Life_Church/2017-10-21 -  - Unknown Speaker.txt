never meet again like this here so this morning the Lord laid something on my heart I preached on it before but I never went this way with it so you just pray for us and I know the prophet of God he said where you have a gather and there's always three kinds of believers there's a make believer there's an unbeliever there's a make believer and there's a real true believer so this morning I'm going to maybe so much and I hope that we're all here I hope that we're all saved but I want to speak maybe this morning to the may be to that that group those that are believers but also I want to speak to maybe those that are backslidden maybe this morning and this is what the Lord laid on my heart okay and maybe to those that are unconverted this morning amen because this could be our last time amen this could be our last time you said what Trump's president my he's myself everything the prophets done said 1956 she said America we either accept God or reject God came back said she's rejecting God she's going to I don't care Trump whoever amen she's going down you know he may make it a little better for a little while but it's been prophesied and she's going down hey man I want to be found in Christ this morning Amos the fourth chapter the ninth verse said I have smitten you with blasting and mildew when your when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased the palmer worm divide them yet you have not returned to me unto me saith the Lord I have sinned among you the pestilent after the manner of Egypt your young men have uh slain with a sword and have taken away your horses and I've made the stink of your camps to come up into your nostrils yet you have not returned unto me saith the Lord I have overthrown some of you as God over the proves Sodom and Gomorrah and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning yet have you not returned into me saith the Lord therefore thus will I do unto thee O Israel and because I will do this unto thee prepare to meet thy God o Israel may the Lord that his blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated this morning amen so I was thinking about this I'm preparing to meet God and so you know we agree we prepare for a lot of things amen we prepare like me and brother Marquette to prepare this morning to get ready to come to the house of God you had to prepare Amen you wouldn't want to you know in here just you maybe just half dressed and all that but you you got prepared you got up maybe ate something brushed your teeth comb your hair to the shower whatever it was and and everything get to get ready to come to the house of God a man means remotely to chard brushed her teeth everything and you know got ready to come to the house of God prepared to come amen and in in a couple in a month or so we got a young men in our church young ladies that's gonna get married and they're starting to prepare brother Jim Amanda said for that special day of theirs amen they're starting to prepared to get ready for when she marches down the aisle amen it Hinda to take their vows before a group of people and to commit themselves to one another for life amen and they're preparing for that and I hope they would prepare because you know that you wouldn't want them to come and not be prepared and all that but they're preparing for that day and I wondered this morning it it mean you this morning have prepared you know like I think brother brother made a statement like this he said now and President Johnson was to visit your city and he would took brother Jim he would he would want to come to your house that would be an honor for him to come to your house even though you might disagree with maybe his uh his policies as a is there is a is a is a you know politics and stuff like that he might disagree with him but it still would be an honor for him to come to your house you would prepare for him to come to your house he would maybe perhaps maybe hire somebody to clean it up real good and and all that because hey the president is coming to your house a man and so and today if it would be that a president Trump you know would come to our house to my house or do your house it would know you might disagree with all that but it would be great it would be an honor for him to come amen but you know what today I didn't come the president Trump's house I didn't come to the White House I didn't come to that but I come to the house of the Lord amen and I had to prepare myself to go to me God amen because I want my heart ride my attitude right cuz I'm coming to me the king of kings and the Lord of lords and I hope that you come prepared this morning a man to meet Christ this morning we have gathered together this morning but for what purpose have we come this morning maybe some come so maybe he said well I've done my duty Sunday morning I come to the house of God some of us has come that way a man some of us has come that way but what purpose that have you come for this morning you know what I come for the prophet of God said you get what you expect Amen I come expecting to see God this morning I come expecting to see somebody that's not saying brother words to get saved I come expected to see somebody that they got the Holy Ghost to get the Holy Ghost that's what I come expected Christ to do how about you this morning hey man hallelujah I come amen expecting to see the sick get well a man brother home I preach the message just here I paint last Sunday or Wednesday night maybe about what kind of fruit is your life producing hey man what kind of fruit and brother branham I don't know mark he been losing that tape Paul a prisoner Christ nothing brother branham mentions he said if a person would come up here brother Wes and would get prayed for and I would lay their hands on them or you would lay their hands on her brother Terry and they would something and you would let their hands out and immediately they would receive their healing it's all my look at brother David look at brother Terry look at their but brother brems and you don't judge it that way you look and see what kind of fruit their life it's presently bearing oh god I pray this morning that my life can bear the fruits of the spirit man hallelujah hallelujah so what purpose did you come for this morning did you come to see me then you're gonna be disappointed Amen because I know I'm nothing amen but he's everything oh if I could keep that in my mind amen I'm nothing without him I'm lost without him I'm helpless without him this morning Amen one with hell I can do all things hallelujah and I want to keep that before me hey man Oh so what purpose say man if you have come rightly you've come to meet God if you come rightly brother Jim you've come to meet God I hope this morning that me and you have come riding then we prepared ourselves to come to the house of God to meet with him if not then this is just like I said let's not just another gathering Amen we can go down to the restaurant together there hey man but I want him to come I want him to be here amen some people say well you know the Pentecost what they used to be and he didn't shout and dance and speak in tongues you didn't have no service God wasn't there but we found out different in this hour that we're living in amen they've got so you know still waters they tell me runs deep sometimes it's to get into his presence brother Terry and just begin to lift your hands and make love to him and let him make love back to you Oh Oh hallelujah I hope I can do that today just to lift my hands and make love to and let him make love back to me hey man hey man you know the Israelites they often come together to bow down before their graven images hey man that's what the scripture tells us and they were professing to worship God they bowed down before their graven images professor worship to worship God amen but you know what they knew about true worship they knew what it took they knew how to approach God amen God had instructed them here that the prophet Moses how to come in how'd it go out and how to do that just like me and you today we know Church protocol we know how to come in we know how to go out but probably God said we ought to come to church 30 minutes early said there in the quietness amen read our Bible and pray to create that atmosphere and they knew how to come they knew how to create that atmosphere but many times it became a ritual tool amen and they just came anyway hey man do you remember what the prophet of God said Cain hey man when God said hey if you do as your brother you do well and Cain said here it is Lord you just take it or leave it and he left it I wonder what purpose we came for here's my worship Lord just take it or leave it you'll leave it and leave you without him god help us this morning we gotta prepare amen amen so they came and like I said they knew about true worship and how they should come hey man but they could not do it that way what about me and you this morning we know about like I said church protocol we know about true worship we know that the scripture says that the father secrets such that works of healing what in spirit and in truth amen we know about that but sometimes I wonder amen if we cannot do it that way hey man see they could not do it that way but they still went back home satisfied what about me and you we come here on Sunday morning we gathered our church on Sunday more Rhian brother mark our families I wonder what kind of attitude we come in they would come and say Lord just take it or leave it a man we know about true worship but probably God taught us about true worship we don't have to wait for the music to get pumped up hurry on the organ or her brother hurry on the organ or whoever we ought to come in here a man with our hands lift it up saying hey man speak to me Lord speak to the depth of my soul Lord amen then we come in and we do it that way and we leave satisfied because we think we but what we did it it just went through the motions amen oh my they had gone through all the rituals correctly they've done everything amen to the letter like me you do sometimes you know even you know and I don't know about y'all I know we don't sometimes sometimes we do but usually in most churches and whatever it don't matter however every Church is sovereign within itself hey man there ain't no dictatorship or lordship or don't bishop hey man don't tell you how to you should take communion all I know is the Bible says Jesus said Paul said when he wrote it how as off this you take this you do it under me did you know what that can become a ritual amen we should where's gonna be communion we were to make sure we love everybody if we made any mistakes we do you know what there's healing in communion I've know people that's received their healing during the protection of the Lord's Supper amen if we come right if we come prepared God to give us what we have needed [Applause] amen but it's left up to me and you we got to prepare a man we got to prepare all they've went through and we go through all that stuff correctly like they did and they were content what about me in here I wonder if we get content amen and just coming and going through the motions doing everything and thinking everything's all right amen all help us Lord hey man now God calls them to meeting now God calls them to meet them no longer to be satisfied with the visible and the external but get to the invisible and the eternal a man that's what I want to get nothing what we can see on the outside not the external but I want what about my soul ain't man down on the inside of the inside I don't just want it on my flesh cuz we can go to a ballgame and get happy in the flesh amen not just on my spirit amen cuz we can talk about your grandmother I know your mama died or whatever or this or that reasoning and all that you'll come to the altar but I wanted down on the inside of the inside that soul amen to where it'll make me live right it'll make me talk right it make me walk right it make me love one another it made me want to come to the house of God they make me want to raise my hands and give God glory [Music] hey man hey man oh that is the call of God to everyone here this morning hey man like brother Louie can I preach it this morning hey man like this could be our last service what would you do if you knew this was your last service hey man would you would you make sure that you loved everybody would you make sure you didn't have nothing a man in your heart against no one would you make sure that you were that world was the priority thing in your life hey man is that what you would do if this was your last service what would you do what would I do if I knew this would be my last service what would you do hey man what would I do I think I come in here and I wouldn't care who what's preaching it as long as they was preaching the pure unadulterated word I wouldn't worry about who's leading songs per second is special but I come for one purpose and that's a god I need you this morning ain't worried about this ain't worried about that ain't worried what they say about Trump what they say about hearing I want you to are I ain't worried whether they say you're coming back with a white horse or a white cloud Lord get so come quickly Lord even so come Lord amen hallelujah brother Homer preached last Sunday morning I thought it was very timely on the bride who revelation 19:7 says the bride has made herself ready in other words meaning you are God something to do a man and that's what that's to prepare that's to make ready you remember the Prophet talked about that little woman amen she was a cousin to the rest of the all the sisters around there and the young man from the meat packing company from Chicago the owner's son come down looking for a wife a man and so he looked and he could never find one among them didn't I mean been sisters a man but he what he was looking for he was looking for character man and you remember how he's seen that cousin throw the wash water out the back doors is washing dishes barefooted and she he went to her and said excuse me man you know who I am yes and kind of hung her head together you're the boss's son he said she'd be here he goes just ma'am that's

fellowship this morning he still wants your love he still wants you he still wants to be number one in your life he still wants you for him to be the number one priority in your life oh god I thank you for that Lord it said that we were so like so that were picked out a firebrand they men all talk about grace hey man we was on our way dug a grave in the devil's hell a man but God trucked us around brother Mike hey man why don't we love him like we should why don't we talk to him like we should why don't we balance it with a lot with sugar brother brems said hey man on North it not is the

forget the time Amen that he saved us the pit from which we was dug out I don't want to talk about it but I thank God that he didn't leave me in that pit that with his outstretched hands he lifted my feet and put my feet on a solid rock to stay you said then what do I need to do brother Davis cast down our idols amen I want to read something I didn't print it out but I'm gonna read you something out something's 51 real quick hey man hold on hey man this and some 151 you remember David and Bathsheba when he done there you remember Nathan came to him remember told him that little parable and David even pronounced his own death sentence hey man he said he said that men ought to be killed and Nathan said David dark the man oh I like the man David but you know what David didn't get mad there's the way I talk about I you know I did this I did that forgotten my no God knew all about that but listen to David what he said son 51 how mercy upon me O God according to thy loving-kindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies take a blot out my transgressions oh I want that to be my prayer we've got any David's in here that's in the building this morning I want that to be my prayer hey man wash me thoroughly from my iniquity do that Lord and cleanse me from my sin for our knowledge broad knowledge my transgression David acknowledge brother Jim what are you done he's our knowledge my transgression amen our knowledge my transgression and my sin is ever before me against need we only have a sinned and done this evil in that side that I write that I - be justified when thou speaketh David knew that when the Lord speak is the Lord hey I've done this to thee and only thee and when you speak and judge me you're right in doing it you're justified and what your punishment should be a man a lot of us don't think what God you know no he's justified whatever he does son to us he's just somebody doing it because we don't deserve nothing Amen but we deserve hey hey man we deserve the grave but God in His infinite mercy God in his election called me and you thank God hallelujah thank you Lord hey hey man he don't owe me nothing but I all hear my everything hallelujah how am i hallelujah he said without speakers and be clear when our judges behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom purge me with hyssop and I will be clean wash me and I shall be water than snow may need enough hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice how do I face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities listen what he said create in me a clean heart O God that's what I wanted to do this morning and renew a right spirit within me Amen give me a rock come prepared Lord for you to create a new heart a man renew a right spirit within me hey man he said and renew a right and good cast not cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit that's what I want him to do this morning created me a clean heart renew a right spirit within me amen restoring to me the joy of thy salvation and then he went on to say then will I be able to teach transgressors thy ways a man then will I be able to do that hey men probably be standing at the door Christ and knocking amen and this later you'll see an age worth the spirit what's lukewarmness ain't man he'd rather you make he'd rather he's got more respect for a cold person than lukewarm person he'd rather you'd be hot or cold but because you're lukewarm and the Bible even says that they put Christ on the outside of the church the only age that put him on the outside of the church and he was knocking trying to get back here but he's knocking and individuals doors this morning knocking amen and we'll just open up the door he'll come in and sup with us and we can sup with him amen what about backsliders here this morning would there be any here you know the Bible says he's married to the backslider hey man you had to have something in order to backslide a man oh my if you are here this morning maybe you've gone cold on God maybe your unconverted this morning but by you being here this morning shows me or tells me there may be a little something that God is working on you may be a backslider this morning but by being here in the presence of Almighty God this morning that's me to know there may still be a little something tugging in your heart to get right with God bring me back to where I used to be Lord bring me back to my first love bring me back to work I used to be Lord where you are number one Lord hey man oh if you are and you have that there must be something in your heart prepared to come back into his loving arms and be reconciled to him hey man let me look at three three points I'll try to hurry hey man number one I want to look at a challenge number two an invitation and number three of summons and I'll do it quickly hey man number one challenge it was posed he was punishing he punished the Israelites time and time again for their worship for their idols trying to bring them back to repentance but none of that had moved them amen none of that what about me and you the more God smoked them the harder they come like I said you know brother Brent said I'll go across the country and preach it come back they're worse than what they do I think about my pastor I think about brother Donny and all that hey man the harder they preach it seems like the harder but people become a man they don't want to be moved they don't want to be touched a man nothing you see ain't met old God amen so since she won't submit to him then he said I'll send my wrath upon you amen yeah I believe he's putting on a challenge this morning prepare to meet me amen amen Oh hope you heard it for a long time you've heard the gospel for a long time and you still reject it but I challenge you to meet me be prepared to meet me this morning hey man and do you still and do you hope if you're here this morning and I put out this challenge to you do you hope to meet God do you hope to stand or withstand God number one under this heading the challenge number one why do we justify ourselves to remain his enemy [Music] well that's just my nature thus gadlin's we got that kind of a man if God saved you amen he'll bring that nature and the Holy Spirit I bring that nature under control [Applause] now I ain't gonna say that old man won't try to raise up and down then but we got the Holy Spirit amen and we're prepared to meet him it'll bring it back under subjection hey ho but you justify yourself well I would call so and so they didn't smile at me a man silane will come back to church no more the pastor didn't shake my hand but didn't say my favorite song so you're justified in remaining God's enemy then hey man you're justifying yourself a man or you finding a little quote a man that the Prophet said you know one place and somebody told me this one time said the angel the Lord told the Prophet not to have a television so I say you're justifying yourself so I'm saying you're more spiritual than the Prophet that means you can sit there and watch it and then come to church on Sunday morning and expect God to move but you justify yourself because you said the angel of the Lord told the probably didn't tell us but that prophet was an angel to this church age a man and he said to apply their token take the television out take the sword start out take the dirty magazines out [Applause] very man but we justify we get a quote and justify ourselves hey man oh but I want to ask you a question how much has he done for you how many of these you snatched out of a as a firebrand hey man I'll leave you hey man how many bees He healed hey man how many bees he saved how many of you filled you with the Holy Ghost Oh God that we are - we owe our life to him number two under this heading the challenge how many how long are you gonna resist him can you stand up against him when he comes at you and he says prepare to meet me and he comes at at you with a slore drone and that sort is none other than the Word of God not only the written word but the work for our hour are you going to resist him are we gonna be like David said in the Psalms we're like the shaft that the wind blows away they want to resist him hey man you know the property of God you know when he was praying for somebody many times he said that demon cancer is calling out for help but that other person has got it what about somebody that's resistant the Word of God then another spirit over here that's resisting the Word of God I'll call out for help from that other spirit that's resisting the Word of God amen but I want to preach a man and I hold brother Donnie and brother homer and brother Vince come brother Ted all them preach hey man amen cuz we gonna tear that kingdom of Satan down hallelujah probably do you and sometimes brother Trey you can feel them spiritually you know there I know though there that rig sitting there calling out for help I was going to resist what he's saying I'm gonna resist what the path I can really resist what the evangelists say though I know it's the Word of God amen amen you know Pharaoh couldn't stand up against him at the Red Sea he tried to resist him there was many people in the Bible that tried to stand up against God even Pilate said you know I got I had part of release she just said he ain't got no part at all and that's you're giving it to it by my father hallelujah amen don't you know I could call 2,000 angels and they come right now but he died for me and for you hey man all we got to count the cost and find out that we are prepared to resist him we better count the cause number three under the head and what about are you able to endure what he may lay upon you amen there's no telling you know sometimes brother Brent said we may have to get knocked down on our bed in order to look up amen oh I wonder hey man there's no hell you say some 14:1 says The Fool has said in his heart there is no God amen The Fool has said in his heart there is no God old are we prepared to go out and fight find it out but if neither these you can do you can't justify yourself you can't resist him you're not able to endure then I'll tell you what to do amen let the challenge bring you to your knees so you can speak to seek His grace man if you can't resist him if you can't justify yourself if you're not able to endure what he puts upon you then let that challenge this morning sinner backslider like a bird amen bring you to your knees and say God I'm seeking your mercy I'm seeking your grace amen oh my number to you what about an invitation I believe he's sent out an invitation and when God comes out to meet us we want a running hide but he's an invited and said I'm gonna come out to meet you what did Adam do when God was looking for him you know what brother Brenham said that a ditch should have been Adam running through the garden saying God where are you God god I've done this wrong well what did the Bible say it hidden he hid himself a man so I was 139 $0.08 it like this if I sent up into heaven right there if I make my bed in hell all right there where we go he's there we can't run too far from him we can't hide from him and he's given us an invitation and he says I'm gonna come out to meet you hey man Oh God hey man he gave an invitation when every one of them walked away from him then in the course of his ministry he he had three pools in his ministry and then when he begin to preach the word they walked off and left him and he turned to the 12 that were left and said will you go also and Peter spoke them words to whom shall we go for thou has the words of eternal life where we're going to go Lord hey man we can't run from you we can't hide from ya if I make my bed in hell you're there if I sitting up in the heaven you're there you've invited you're gonna come out and meet you be prepared so God I want to meet you on the grounds of your mercy in your grace what did that captain alpha say to him captain of the police he said listen brother branham you think he said the whole you thank God to give me the Holy Ghost brother brems it is to the Baptist just as anybody else whosoever will he said you think he will I said yes he will he said brother and says she will captain he said well let me he said you thinking well you can I go get a nice suite of rooms you know right there in Tacoma Washington can I go get a hotel get the best room in the hotel and all that and him he said no you don't have to do that he said where will you meet me right here right here you he said brother Graham you mean right here in this shooting gallery right here in this shooting gallery and down on their knees they win a day man and God met him right there hey man he told him God would in the belly of the whale for one one time amen he wasn't the fight furnace for some some time he crossed the Red Sea he crossed Stormin cm got a read for one one time he'll come in here for one of us if there's just one this morning if there's just one unconverted parson but that's just one backslider here that's more that's just one somebody that wants a closer walk with God they'll come right in this church just for one [Applause] Amy you said what I need to do brother David kneel at the cross hey man remember Billy Graham in his invitations but he ain't got no monopoly on that invitation just like the prophet of God to the Catholics didn't have no monopoly on the cross what did you use just as I am without one plea Amen just as I am Lord that's all that's all I'm bringing to you Lord I'll just leave here I am Lord I know I'm nothing I know I was born in sin like David said strengthen iniquity come to the world speaking lies probably the first log we told was to get out of a whipping hey man but we're here hey man you like the cross and say God give me repentance God give me faith give me give me hatred for sin give me a yielding spirit give me a heart of flesh take the hardest stone out and give me a heart of flesh that can be touched then we'll be prepared to meet God you remember the great advantages Breton talked about him when she said we can't find the old record is it on the great adventurous hey man he said what there's one thing you can do you can appeal your case that the right throne he said I guess that's all I have to do he said he got darker and darker and darker then their great light and I don't think brother brems just told these stories just to feel well I got twenty minutes on the tape I might as well fill it up with no I believe he told it for a purpose and there he was the great adventurer stood before the God that white throne they said hey advance it so and so have you ever lied he's into that presence you better tell the truth he said ah I thought about he said yeah la have you always have you been good have you always been good know how heaven may be always wanted a god know Miniclip he said he's about ready to hear condemned depart for me but behind them he heard a voice sweeter than any mother's voice he said father advantages he stood for me here on earth said I'm gonna stand for him here oh god help me to stand for you lord help me Lord one more real quick a sermons a sermons you know you never know when that time comes there was many that left us last year some we didn't have no idea I sense ministers brother Terry and got that authority to tell people sometimes but the one that has that authority when he comes and said it's time and he takes your card off the rack you remember the prophet of God he got real upset kind of got mad at God about that woman that she uh you know prayed for she got worse than she died brother brems said God you owe me an explanation and then I think he had a dream or vision and God saw more she nearly drowned a year ago and said that was her time then but she wasn't right went to her mother and told her said yes I'll be bout a year ago rightness he said she nearly drowned it's a God forgive me just humbles forgive your stupid servant that's what he says a man said God you don't owe me nothing hey man oh god help me Lord help me to be prepared Lord we don't know like I said brother Louie said this could be our last service me and brother Mike don't know we'll get back to Alabama State for naught but one thing I do know I know who holds tomorrow and I know who holds my hand [Applause] Jeremiah said it like this the harvest is past the summers ended and we're still not saved brother Brown preach the message out of that why why you got the antidote you've got the inoculation you got the remedy why why if we all here die and go to hell every one of us in this bill it won't be brother Donny's fault it won't be God's fault we won't be brother homers fault but it be your father you're my father why because we didn't take the prescription that God oh yes I don't worry nothing I don't want to rely on my mama's experience I don't really want to rely on my pastor's experience I don't really rely on brother branham's experience but I want experience for God for myself I want to look to Jesus the Bible says there were five wise and five foolish a man and what they did not cry went out that behold the bridegroom cometh and they all rose up the five wise and the five foolish and both of them trimmed their lamps but the five foolish their lamps went out and they went to the warrant wise and say hey give us of your oil because our lamps have won out and you know what then watch this and listen we got barely enough for ourselves so what you need to go and get from them and buy from them that sells amen and where they went the Bible says the bridegroom come and took the five wise in and shut the door oh god what we live in a church what we live in at what we live in had prepare to meet God hey man oh you know what used to be one time a song you finally could took the time to pray you finally took the time to come to the house of God but she was too late because God came the day before and he was one day too late then me can I read you just a few quotes and we're gonna close now just give me five more minutes a man listen what he says he said and now he said and now mother you hear in the street and the dear loving person mother here and here all around over the building now I want to do tonight by God's help if you will to speak to his word to you then to prepare your heart for the healing service now I want you to listen close preparation God before he does anything he always prepares for it how could we as he spoke in the Bible before we go over the final war we have to prepare for that war if you're going to get made while you prepare for that time and you have preparations and before you come to church in my preparations the amulets of bring your your loved one to bring you or you had to get a certain amount of money ready before you could come it's preparation and God is always prepares the people for the events that's just about to happen I believe God's getting the church ready prepared before the great event of it's coming he's gonna have a bride ready listen why should I prepare to meet God brethren brother you prepare for a wedding you prepare for anything else when you see these things coming you prepare to meet God every time you see a gray hair in your head that means you better prepare to meet God every time you pass Undertaker's and statments that means you better prepare to get ready to meet God every time a baby's born

coming is drawing I got many more but we'll just stand hallelujah stand together hallelujah prepare to meet God amen and with our head bowed and our eyes closed they come to the music maybe maybe they play something softly like I said brother Lewis said this could be your last time I don't know who's here this morning I don't know if there's an unconverted person here this morning maybe you've never given God the opportunity maybe you're here this morning your backslider maybe you're here this morning you grub : God hey man whatever it is go God sees you like he told Amos all he wanted to

meet you are you ready are we ready and then summons I don't know like I said many left us this past year meaning we knew about many we did I'd say one of these days the Lord doesn't come there'll be more than slip away but I know he's gonna have a people ready to take a change of body I want to be a part of that if you're here this morning you're unconverted and you want to talk it over with a
