of Jesus and I'm so glad that we are known as the body we're known as mistress Jesus Christ bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit life of his life she is him he's just changed his mask the God that was behind the mask in the groom of Jesus is nailed is now veiled behind the mask of his bride making him the same yesterday today and forever and the works that he done when he walked the shores of Galilee he is now doing those same Works in a many membered body around the world that's right you know why cuz he said so Hallelujah he said so that settles it amen amen wonderful message that was preached last night by Brother Matt oh my so appreciated it brother from mid this amen he preached on of the passing of the Baton and if you wasn't here I'm sure it's archived and you want to pull that out and listen to it just a wonderful wonderful message we appreciate brother Donnie giving us an opportunity to stand here with you this evening and I know there's many great man of God preaching that he could have had here tonight but he allowed someone like me to come and I I appreciate that may God richly bless him and bless you be our prayer if you have your Bibles this evening turn with me to Mark chapter 10 we want to read from Mark 10 starting at verse 46 and tonight you know wanting to have a prayer line if it should go that way and uh we just tried to be just just as concise and and as we can be and not be long at all uh not take much time so we'll just try to enter into the word of God as quick as we can and we trust that something will be said to encourage your faith because you're not healed by sensation you're not healed by emotion you're not healed by a prayer line you're not healed by someone laying hands on you you're healed by faith and if your faith can rise up to receive what he's already done for you you can walk out of here free tonight you I'm telling you I don't care if you got high blood low blood or no blood God can do something for you tonight amen amen Mark chap 10 we want to start reading at verse 46 and the Bible says this and they came to Jericho and as they went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind barus the son of Tas Sat by the highways side begging and when he had heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy mercy on me and many charged him that he should hold his peace so he just sat down and folded his arms and thought about something else they said hold your peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of David have mercy on me and Jesus Stood Still and when Jesus stands still something Good's always going to happen and he commanded him to be called and they called the blind man saiding unto him be of good Comfort arise he calleth thee and he casting away His Garment Rose and came to Jesus and Jesus answered and said unto him what Willl thou that I should do unto thee and the Blind Men said unto him Lord that I may receive my sight and Jesus said unto him go thy way thy emotion thy sensation thy faith thy faith hath made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word SS of God what a blessing it is to know that the same Jesus that gave blind barus his sight is the same Jesus who gave Jessica her sight and that same Jesus is in the house tonight let us bow our heads I want to speak to you for just a few minutes as quick as we can on step out to your promise step out to your promise oh Lord God we love you Lord we thank you for the many blessings you have given us and Lord as we have gathered here this evening and set aside this service we ask Lord that you would come once more and confirm your word to the hearts of your ch children for oh God you're the same who gave the eyes to Blind B ofus you're the same one tonight that can open every eye in this building Lord and those that would be bound dear God by a chain of circumstance that those that would be afflicted by a disease or a report that there's nothing else that can be done you are The God Who changes situations for Lord I have seen you make the lame walk I have seen you open the eyes of the Blind and Cancers disappear there is nothing that you cannot do so Lord once more we look to you and ask God may your word become so real that our faith can rise up dear God and possess that Lord that's been given to us bless your children tonight Lord may they be great testimonies for Lord th know it's my heart if I could Lord myself I would heal everyone but I can't Lord I'm just a man but oh God you're God and you can do anything so Lord use these brothers tonight as we lay hands upon your children Lord may they go forth testifying of a God who cannot fail amen we commit this congregation the ministry of oursel into your hands For Your Glory for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says amen God bless you Saints you may be seated speak tonight on step out to your promise now notice I didn't say step out to a promise but I said step out to your promise for you see it must be a personal revelation for the Bible says the promise is unto you the promises unto you and to your children even as far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call and I was thinking of this thing of faith and fear and reminded me of something that the prophet of God said he said I thought tonight that I would talk on faith for a little while just to build up on Christian faith and I find that one of the greatest hindrances that the church has got today is their scared to death and what are you scared about but that's the hour that we're living in when everything is a fear now everything is a phobia I can't even spell phobia we never heard of such as that when I was a boy but now they have balloon phobias and lettuce phobias and Subway phobias and all kinds of phobias why we're living in the era when men's hearts are failing for fear but the prophet said what are you scared about amen one of the greatest hindrances of the church to God today is they're scared to death but what are you scared about that's what I'm wondering if you'll just only realize who you are you don't know who you are you don't know who that is sitting next to you you say yeah that's my neighbor I know him all right but he's a Son of God see adopted by Jesus Christ into the family that's a daughter of God sitting next to you and who are you if you're a Christian if you're a Believer you're a son and daughter of God then what are you scared about ain't no need of being scared this is his house he will take care of it amen as listen to this as long as the devil can keep you scared that's all he wants to do he's got you right then so then we find that Amnesia of not knowing who you are feeds fear think about that that's right what are you scared about it's because you don't know who you are so Amnesia not knowing who you are not knowing your surroundings will produce fear you know I lost my daddy few year ago to alzheimer's it's a terrible disease CA you lose thank you brother Donnie CA you lose them twice you lose them before you ever lose them so when my daddy got into the advanced stages of it we had to put him into a unit where they could take better care of you and they were having a little party and I took my daddy over to where the the room where they was having the party I wrode him in there and they were passing out gifts and they said James Ward but he never moved cuz he didn't know who he was and I said Daddy you better raise up here buddy they they've got a present for you it looks really good but he never moved cuz he didn't know who he was you said why do you say that because I want you to understand that God comes service after service and he speaks your name through his word but I want you to know that no matter how great the message would be no matter how wonderful the rich the anointing would be if you don't recognize that it's for you it will do you no good good you must recognize that every promise in this Bible is your personal promise hallelujah amen not knowing who you are feeds fear but knowing who you are produces perfect Faith oh come on how could you say that because the prophet said Jesus had perfect Faith because he knew who he was in the the word and when you know who you are and the Devil comes and says you can't make it and you might as well give up and you might as well turn back you can tell him I came from God I go back to God I've already made it Hallelujah brother bam used this illustration several times about a box of rattlesnakes and he said why does someone come up in the morning to your door an Express agent today we would say FedEx or prime you know but they come up with the box of rattles snakes and it's got your name on it and the Box is doing this because they're moving around and you hear they're there you see the rattlesnakes you hear the rattlesnakes you know that they're there just like your symptoms is there yeah but if you receive them they're yours come on now but you don't have to take them you can say I don't want them but the man can say but your name is on the box but I don't want them I won't have them and he will do everything he can to try to get you to take them look at the MRI look at the CT scan look at that rash look at that Twisted arm look at that Twisted foot he'll try everything in the world to get you to take them and in one sense they're yours because it's real pain in one sense they're yours in another sense they're not you might see all your symptoms the devil said here it is here's your cancer here's your heart trouble here's your condition here's your glycom here's your blindness but they're not yours until you sign for them now if you refuse to sign for them he has to take them back to the express agent he has to send them back to the one who sent them by you not accepting your symptoms they have to go back they have to go back to the one that said [Applause] them let the devil feel that pain for a while all right he can stand there and argue as much as he wants to but until you take them and sign for them they belong to the express company until you sign for them don't sign nothing the devil brings you that we're all guilty I am too amen I know you're human we're all human many times we've signed for stuff well I'm getting a cold amen don't sign for nothing that the devil brings you I refuse to have it if you won't testify that you've got it if you won't testify that you got it when you testify you still have your sickness then the devil keeps it with you but if you to testify that you've got it he can't give it to you amen refuse to testify say I won't have it no sir if you receive them you're yours but you don't have to take them well your name's on it I don't want them I don't have to have them but if you sign for them and receive them they are yours and as long as you testify of it the devil will keep it with you if that's true for a box of rattlesnakes Oh Glory to God I got to thinking if that's true for a box of rattlesnakes would it not be true if an angent from Heaven comes and offers you a box and in this box is healing it's Joy it's peace is a Revival it's Deliverance it's Redemption it's got your name on it it's for you it's to you but if you don't accept it if you won't receive it it goes back to the one that's in it but if you accept it and believe it and confess it you can have everything you can have everything that's in the [Applause] Box it's a personal possession glory to God the prophet said God can only bless you as you confess that he's done it for you see he's the high priest of our confession is that right Hebrews 3 he said it did he's the high priest of our confession he can only do for you as we accept it believe it and confess it no there's a little instruction how like to give you you might say I want to say this to the sick you might come here and be prayed for listen to this you might have angels to lay hands on you my God we talk about that for 6 months if an angel came down tonight and laid down oh you you talking about Facebook blowing up you might have angels to lay hands on you and it will never do one thing to you on now until you first believe it accept it and confess it think about that Angels would come down and lay their hands on you but they would do you no good unless you accepted it here's the high priest of our confession we've got to confess it first before he can witness it before God he's the high priest there to make intercession Upon Our confessions of what he's done for us and I say to you tonight that's the ABCs of healing of your deliverance of any blessing that the word of God has for you it's a b cs accept it believe it confess it accept it if we could accept God's promises the way you accept the doctor's report on come on Friends doctor give you bad news you call everybody you know but I'm here to give you good news tonight well the doctor gave me this pill and that pill and this I've got nothing against that I believe in those things but I'm here to give you the gospel tonight when those pills fail this one will not fail you amen Hallelujah ABCs of your healing accept it believe it confess it if we can do that tonight if we can do that tonight you will see Miracles you will see Giants fall you will see Revival the angel of God told brother brenon if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand in your way not even cancer what are you doing tonight I'm trying to get you to believe to accept it believe it and confess it now as our story opens this evening on blind barus he had been blind for many years no he wasn't born that way but something had happened to him that caused him to go blind then after all these years of blindness he had took on the name of blind barus the beggar everyone around him never thought he would ever see again his very name testified of what they believed about it blind barus they didn't say blind barus until they said blind barus the beggar and after all those years people just accepted it that's just the way it is he's a blind beggar amen think about that they call bind barus after all that's his name he made a living at the gate begging for coins go with me now as we I just want to recreate this for just a wee bit it must have been a cold October morning that blind b m was getting to the gate late and the reason he was late because he had dreamed all night long that he could see again and all the businessmen had done g into the City and there was very few tourists in them days so what could he do he had got to the gate late he wouldn't get a coin how would he get something to eat he listened he could hear no one the morning was looking bad the day had gotten off to a bad start it wasn't looking good but little did he know oh glory to God this would be the last day he would have to beg for a coin because of blindness this would be the day of his Deliverance maybe you woke up this morning depressed sick a bad doctor's report things don't look too good for you the morning started out bad but I've come to tell you tonight but today today is the day that you don't have to deal with that fear no more you don't have to deal with that sickness no more you don't have to deal with that habit no more for today this day is the day of your deliverance Hallelujah so blus took his place by the side of the gate he fell around him until he found a big Stone and he sat down he began to think you know this Stone this very Stone I'm sitting on right now the power of God shook it off the top wall of Jericho and broke that wall down think about that I'm sitting right here I am setting right here where God manifested his great power you see oh I wish I could have sit there where that great miracle took place it would have been nice to sit there where he sit to see that rock that God shook off the wall but I'm here to tell you this evening the very place that you are sitting tonight in this very building we have seen that same God manifest himself by healings deliverances salvation raising the Dead come on somebody we have seen our God manifest himself in the power of His glory you say I wish I could be sitting there that day I'm telling you you're setting in the best place you can be setting right now you are Hallelujah you are setting in the very place that Christ said he would place his name and there is power in the name of Jesus Hallelujah setting in the warm sunshine warming himself from the cold morning he began to think of what he was dreaming the night before Oh What a wonderful dream I dreamed I could see it was so real the dream dream was so real what made me dream that I haven't thought about Sin for years I wonder is there a possibility I could see again and maybe you're wondering is there a possibility that I won't need this cane anymore is there a possibility that that painful arthritis will leave my joy joints listen to me tonight every believer in here every believer in here ought to take the word impossible out of your vocabulary for the Bible says in Mark 9:23 all things are possible to him that believe every believer we don't even have a right to say impossible there is nothing that's impossible with God and his people oh hallelujah amen the dream was so real it changed his thinking of forever being blind to a possibility of sin and if thinking on the dream can do that what can thinking on a promise from the word of God do knowing that word can not fail we spend so many time thinking of our problems thinking of our fears thinking of our afflictions come on somebody but what if we thought of the possibility we serve a God who can change that a god whose word cannot fail heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away Philippians says finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just what whatever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise Lord he didn't say leave them in your Bible he said think on these things you ought to be thinking theight of your healing you ought to be I tell you what I'm thinking in the morning I'm just going to run about three miles on these bad legs cuz it ain't going to be bad no more you need to start thinking that God's going to do something for you think on these things so we find blind Barda setting on a rock off the walls of Jericho warming himself in the sun trying to get a few pities he was all alone thinking he got to thinking about his life I remember sometimes it's good to slow down and remember what good things God have done for you he never brought us this far to leave us he never built a home in us to move away he never taught us to swim to let us drown and he never lifted us up to let us down [Music] amen you need to remember the god you serve he said I remember I used to come here with my lamb and I I had these Turtle does that would that would do tricks to and they would help get the attention of the people to help me get a few coins what happened to those doves what happened and as The Story Goes they begin to remember I remember my wife got sick and the doctors didn't know what to do and blind Barz went behind the house to pray he said Lord my wife is real sick I don't know what to do I need her Lord she cooks for me she washes my clothes she she puts my fork and my plate and her always in the same place so I can find it Lord don't take her from me if you let my dear precious wife live if you let her get well I promise you I take these two t does and I'll offer them to you for a sacrifice and he got well she got well and he kept his promise and he said it wasn't long after that and his daughter took sick his only little girl she got sick with a fever and he slipped out found his way out to the back of the house and he lifted up those blinded eyes he said Lord my little girl is dying oh god I've been there I need her Lord I see the world through her eyes she tells me what the flower looks like that a smell she sees the images in the clouds and tells me what they're making I need her Lord she brings me such joy and I don't have nothing left but my lamb but if you let my baby live I promise you oh don't make a promise to God you can't keep if you have a baby live oh God I remember those please if you'll let her live Lord I'll take my lamb and give it to you as a sacrifice upon the Altar and as The Story Goes she got well and on his road to the church to offer the sacrifice he met the priest and said where goest Thou blind barus and he said to the priest I go to the Temple of the Lord to give my lamb for a sacrifice and he said Barnes thou canst do that that lamb is your your eyes here I'll give you some money go down to the market Stall go to the Stalls and buy yourself a lamb to offer to God for your eyes B btoa said I never promis God aam I promis God this lamb and he said and if I obey my promise to Jehovah he will provide a lamb for my eyes what made me SA that sometimes inspiration strikes you'll say things you don't even know why you're saying it what made me say that God will Pro provide for me a lamb but you see God has always had a preparation for healing in all ages in all times in this scientific artificial intelligence age God still has preparation for healing for those who will believe you sitting there thinking on these ways of a provided lamb and sitting there he begins to hear a noise and he says what's going on and someone says it's Jesus of Nazareth the Lamb of God he's come and when blind barus heard that the lamb the lamb the provided way the Lamb of God that's my lamb he begin to cry out to Jesus Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and someone said hey hold your peace we don't act like that in this church you just sit there and Nod your head every once in a while you'll be all right huh hres hres every time you try to make a move towards God he the devil will provide hres snags you know in horse races when they take that horse and back them in and close that gate and they're getting ready to do so many laps into the Victory Lane and they put those horses behind that gate and close the gate do you know what that Gate's called it's called a barrier gate to keep the horses from running a barrier gate but you know what that barrier gate means it means there's a victory line up ahead and every time oh God come on somebody every time Satan tries to hold you down discourage you turn you back just remember it's a barrier gate but what does it take you there's a victory line Straight Ahead there's a victory just for you do not let the devil D in your faith do not let the devil sets you down you need something for God cry out for it the Bible said he cried the louder that was his lamb if he could get his attention his blindness is over it wasn't his voice that stopped Jesus it's not how hard you scream how hard you cry it wasn't his voice he was more than 150 yards away there's people all around him screaming and crying and singing and shouting and carrying on there's no way he heard the man's voice it wasn't his voice that stopped Jesus it was his faith amen and if his faith can stop Jesus your faith stop him tonight his faith think of it the faith of an insufficient beggar bum we call today a blind man dirty ragged setting by a gate side begging stop the Son of God on his march to Calvary yes sir what would your faith do today it'll bring him from Heaven down here to any individual whether you're in the front row or the back row or wherever you're at tonight your faith can bring him down to you tonight a person Revelation a personal experience let me tell you something young people that's all that will ever hold you in this hour if someone talked you into this message someone will talk you out of it but if you've got the you not long ago I was out in the back field praying and I was praying for the young people I had a burden for him and I was praying for him and I said oh God I said are we just getting them to shout or are we getting them to Christ and while I was praying something spoke to my heart and said go ask them go ask them are you in the message or is the message in in you you see if you're just in this message someone can pull you out of it but if the message is in you all hell cannot get it out of you so I ask you are you in the message or is the message in [Applause] you the Bible said Jesus Stood Still They said he stopped he's calling for you now blind Bar M is left with this decision just like everyone in this building is left with the same decision tonight either sit here sit on this rock or get up and come to Jesus he was 150 yards away from Jesus he's totally blind setting raggedy poor Jesus said come here now I found this where brother B was talking to a sister he said the devil he said the devil he seen you the devil seen you just ready to receive it and the devil said I'll put a little damper on her and brother B makes a sound to illustrate he said I'll fan her a little bit you know to kind of cool her down a little bit see but oh my oh my when the devil tries to dampen you down or cool you down a little bit that's when you rise and claim your god-given rights everybody wants the rights why can't we have hours go on somebody I'm not talking about a political correct right I'm talking about the right of God's word these signs shall follow them that believe they shall cast out Devils they'll raise the Dead come on somebody blooded eyes will be open the fire of God will fall in their assemblies but Satan uses reasoning against Faith how you coming how you coming barnabus reason would say sit still well the master he's asking you to do something you can't do how will you know how to find him how you going to find Jesus and all this multitude of people over here screaming and crying going on how you going to find him reason says you can't find him there's all kinds of obstacles in the way look at the MRI look at the CT scan look at what the doctor said and you know he's number one in his class yeah he may be last in his class amen everything everything how you going to get to him reason said you can't find him there's all kinds of obstacles in your way there's people in your way you're totally blind just sit still it'll be over in a little bit just sit still but you see it was his moment with Jesus he had an audience with the master he couldn't let the opportunity pass by like that woman with the bloody shoe she saw Jesus was passing by her window of opportunity was closing she couldn't get over the crowd or through the crowd so what did she do she went under the crowd she never touched his back she never touched his arm she never shook his hand but she climbed under the people and reached out and touched the H of His Garment and when she touched the him of His Garment the issue of blood stopped [Applause] Hallelujah so blind B steps out of reasoning steps out of all the reasons of why he should not get up off that rock he was sitting on you're blind 1550 yards away can you trust those people to take you to Jesus all the noise all the crowd you don't even know exactly where he's standing all those were just valid reasons of why he shouldn't go while he should just sit still reasoning will have you to sit still but Faith goes into action this is my day this is my time of opportunity I cannot miss my opportunity blind barnz gets up and he goes to Jesus by faith why cuz Jesus said come and if Jesus said come the way has already been provided for you to get here glory to God he never asked us to do something we could not do hallelujah hallelujah the way is only being provided if Jesus is calling for you the way has already been provided for you just step out to your promise step out to your promise I I don't know well I don't know for years if you don't do something what if you doing ain't working too good just step out to your promise that's what we need here tonight Faith to take action it's not enough to say I believe it the devil believes it you must act on it you must accept it believe it and confess it the ABCs of your deliverance how do we know no believ God when God told Noah build a build a boat it's going to rain build the ark it's going to rain how do we know that Noah believed him cuz he built the ark before the rain ever fell Take Action Joshua believe the walls would come down they shouted the victory as our brother said last night they shouted the victory before one rock ever fell off the wall and if you can believe this is your promise this is your night you can start right now shouting the victory Hallelujah you can start right now shouting the victory because the same God that shook the Rock Off the Wall of Jericho we'll shake that chain off of you we'll shake that come on [Applause] somebody they shouted before one rock ever fell oh God that's the kind of faith I want to well I'll wait till I'm completely well and testify that ain't Faith you need to stand there with every symptom and say bless God I'm Healed anyhow how do you know he said so amen Lord I believe Lord I believe what you say to me that's the kind of faith we have that's the kind of faith we need Lord I believe I believe what you say to me Lord I believe Faith jumps up and leaps no matter where he is he's B me to come I'm going there you are that's it SS of God oh my that's when you're getting Faith give your faith Faith a chance some of you have never gave your faith a chance you're afraid to let it go you're afraid to unbridle it but I say tonight turn loose un Bridle it let that faith that brought you here work for you [Applause] tonight you've got your faith all bound down with Traditions turn it loose cut it Loose let God have his way I told Brother Matthew was talking this afternoon I said people will put God In A Box in their service and won't let God move but a certain way we're going to put him right here in this box and God can only do this and then you know what they do they sing let go and let God have his wonderful way oh no we need to really sing that we need to really sing that let go let God have his wonderful way amen amen do you love him let me hurry I'm about done listen to me somebody's word is right is that not true sometimes your doctor is 100% And I'm not against doctors friends I worked in surgery for years thousands of operations I've been on I believe in medicine I believe in I've seen people at Walmart that I worked on I know medicine works but when the doctor says he can do nothing for you I know someone who can amen they told me they said Mr Ward there's nothing we can do for your little girl I said I know someone who can amen somebody's words right it's either what you're looking at or what God says but you see what you're looking at it may be right but it it may be wrong but if you look at this it's always right Mark 10:50 I'll hurry he Cast Away His Garment and he rose and came to Jesus now this beggar garment why is this so significant why is it written in the scriptures that he rose up and Cast Away His Garment this coat because I was doing a little bit of research and I found that this coat was a government issue coat that gave them permission or a license to beg it was the evidence that he could beg on so he needed you see if he threw that robe down and he couldn't see he'd have to either get somebody to get it for him or try to find it himself so for him to cast that away he must have been thinking of something [Applause] else see him leaving it on the ground it indicates how much he believed that Jesus said he would restore his sight oh brother sister tonight can you leave that depression robe can you cast that besetting sin robe can you cast that arthritis robe can you cast that cane robe that eye trouble that fear Ro can you leave it on the ground and step out toward your promise amen cast off that condemnation robe if you ask God to forgive you he is just to forgive you you've got to accept it and believe it and confess it with let the devil condemn you amen step toward your promise cast it off tonight he cast off His Garment and he went to Jesus and Jesus answered and said to him what do you want me to do you come here tonight for a healing service what do you want him to do what do you want what would you that I should do unto thee what you want me to do said how many of you sick tonight or have a need who wants to be healed or helped B said he wants to heal you tonight he wants to heal you a thousand times more than you want to be healed so I wonder is it Jesus or us hey be see and the blind man said to the Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith ha made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way be of good chair he call it for thee he's calling you he called him out from the crowd he had to step out of the crowd and he's doing the same thing right now you have to step out of the crowd of all the reasons of why you can't be you got to step you got to leave that Fellowship of that crowd alone think about it Friends The Master's come and he calls for you and when he called him when he called him he gave him back his sight when he comes don't be afraid to step out and when he calls for you he's got something for you Brothers come to the instruments come to the instruments we're closing amen it's just about right when he calls you he's got something for you sent these brothers here to come to this meeting but on brother's Donnie's heart to have these meetings he's called this assembly because he has something for you do you believe amen blind B has think about this blind B us standing there looking at his hands that he hadn't seen for years oh god look how much I've aged since the last time I saw these hands but it was over oh God I cannot begin to tell you what it felt like when the doctor said Jessica would never see again that she would never walk she would never swallow I could not begin to tell you the joy when she touched my face I could see me again oh Saints if the devil has blinded you under C IR stances and conditions and situations and symptoms let the master tonight open your eyes he R it was the promised word the promised word had been made flesh for Isaiah said when he comes the blind will receive their sight if the Lord Jesus can heal one person he can heal all the people and the only thing you have to to know is this is to believe his presence is here to believe that he is here to help and if you believe that and will accept that he can help you and I trust now that you'll do that each one of you will be reverent and Believe on him with all your heart the Masters comes and he calls for you he's calling you back to health he's calling you back to Joy he's calling you back to peace don't be afraid to sign it don't be afraid to sign for it to accept it to believe it to confess it Jesus died to heal us every one of you is healed every one of you is healed right now Jesus has already healed you you just have to confess it is there someone here tonight that will confess it he has healed me he has delivered me confess it believe it by his trip is he did it at Calvary that's when he overcome sickness and sin and all at Calvary he did it for you if you was the only person ever sick he would have took every strike for you if he was the only person ever lost he would have died on that cross for you that's how much he loves you hallelujah amen just like a tble the prophet said it's just like a table that's set here it's already set a few year ago I was in a restaurant and the waitress came by and she said is there anything
