Disney but a reality of a Living God in his people fulfilling the promises of his word what a privileged people we are brother Daryl it's getting so dark it's getting so evil but it's getting too close save man hallelujah it's getting too close save man well we don't look to that or we concerned sir we're concerned we're humans we're concerned but that's not our priority amen blue we don't entangle ourselves in those things a man he untangled us he unshackled us he made us a free people tonight for the Bible said you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free tonight or what a privilege people we are to know the truth they men Oh to know that we've got that thing it is there when he Satan knocks us down something in us gets us back up amen Oh hallelujah what a privilege people we are tonight we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus it kind of such an honor to be able to gather here with a few that's gathered and with the Saints that's on the internet and I'm so glad that even though Satan can throw a great punch our God just got a stronger and a greater counterpunch tonight and amen he just moves right around and knocks him in the head anyway amen so we're grateful that we may not be able to similar selves together yet we can still gather ourselves together amen and I'm so glad that the Holy Spirit is not bound by state lines and borders and lockdowns and buildings and amen he's the same right here in Happy Valley in this building tonight as he is in your home making him the same yesterday today and forever if you have your Bibles to seem to turn with us to the book of Proverbs we want to read from chapter 3 starting at verse 23 it's a very unusual text that Lord just spit it on our heart last night and we studied up late and in most of today and we distrusted to be a blessing to use just a simple little thought that's really the only kind that I can bring and I was just thinking to I can preach like these brothers could sing would certainly have some church too not a man that just wonderful ha just the songs and the music that stirs our heart but anyhow we want to do what we can do and be what Lord has made us to be and we trusted to be a blessing to you tonight we want to read now from proverbs chapter 3 starting at verse 23 and may the Lord richly bless you whatever you're facing tonight whatever I want you to look to him and believe that even before this service is over he can do a miracle in your life that's just the kind of God that I serve amen proverbs 3:23 the Bible says this then shut up then shalt thou walk in thy way safely and thy foot shall not stumble and when thou liest down they shall not be afraid yay thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet be not afraid of sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh notice it is coming when it cometh not if it cometh but when it cometh Amen be not afraid of the sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh Amen for the Lord oh I love this right here for the Lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken amen let us bow our heads I want to speak to you for just a few minutes this evening on when thou liest down to sleep o Lord father we're just so grateful for your presence that we feel here Lord no wonder God that you are our God Lord as I was thinking of these scriptures it reminds me of the prayer we prayed as a child now I lay me down to sleep lord I never want to get away from bad Lord to come to you with that childlike faith simply just to believe your word Lord that they don't have to be explained to me and figured out Lord but I can believe it and be happy in it simply because you said it Lord knowing your word cannot fail the Lord I pray for your children tonight Lord those dear god that's afflicted with the virus may your presence just go to him Lord and strengthen them god father we know that even while were yet praying the Holy Spirit can remove every symptom every affliction every sign of this evil Lord father we pray for different ones that come to our mind brother Wade Lord and may you touch his body God that he could swallow it enjoy his food Lord we pray sister Becky Lord you see her need tonight sister Lane Lord you see her need to not others Lord that comes to our minds God may your spirit move upon them we pray and Lord may you just come and take this simple thought Lord God may we be able to relay it to the people as we saw the Lord as we looked at it dear God Lord may it bring peace to their hearts tonight we pray Lord that we can just shut the door and let the storm pass by because we're safe and secure in your arms we love you tonight Lord we commit this service into your hands for your glory for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says it may God bless you may be seated this evening amen you know it always amazes me that we serve a god that is so great that is so awesome that he created the universes and billions of Oh billions of stars a God so great that he knows all things the Prophet said he knows every time that Annett my lord I can barely see in that and yet our God knows every time that an at-bat sits I the puppet said he knows every being where he goes into the comb to get his honey hook that blows we can't even comprehend that tonight of all the bees in all the world and all the honey cones in all the world and yet God knows where every bee goes in the comb to get its honey he knows every sparrow that sets in a tree he knows every bird that falls to the ground he knows every thought that's in your mind of God so great of God so knowing of God so awesome and a God who's so caring that he cares about the littlest aspects of our life God so great so awesome that even our canary brains cannot even comprehend him that God so great cares so much about the littlest things in her life that he even cares about our sleep for he said in his word when thou liest down to sleep be not afraid and when thou liest down thy sleep shall be sweet God has given us a promise in his word that I we don't have to have nightmares asleep doesn't have to be interrupted but when we lay down to sleep our sleep can be sweet he won't sir sleep to be restful peaceful he wants it to be pleasant you say sleep your brother you're talking about sleep I know I'm talking about sleep and I'm trying to get you to understand that's how much he cares for you my god if he cares about whether I sleep or not he cares about every aspect of my life this even amen amen he even cares about your sleep think about that tonight Amen brother branham in the sermon he said the little lady sitting back there with a little white jacket or thing home you can sleep at night do you believe the Lord Jesus is going to give you sleep from now on not a brain tumor not a life-threatening disease the woman had trouble sleeping and God anointed His Prophet to call it out and said do you believe he's going to give you sleep from now on you've not been able to sleep but after tonight you're going to be able to sleep that you might know that I'm his prophet or his servant that's your husband sitting by you do believe that God can heal him if God revealed to me what his trouble is will you believe it the arthritis will go from you sir you can go home now and be well and be a happy family a happy family because the husband was delivered of arthritis and the woman was delivered of insomnia the inability to sleep why would he do that because you see brother branham mentioned can't sleep 38 times he put those two words together can't sleep and out of the 38 times that the prophet mentioned it 15 different times was in discernment and while in discernment he mentioned every time while in discernment he mentioned it was caused by nervousness let me show you I just pulled a few of them up now I see you're having you're having some your you keep sitting up in bed you just keep sitting oh oh you can't sleep you've got your nervous is it that right a nervous condition and you can't sleep at night here's another one the man's going from me years ago your trouble started you're probably you look 15 years or more younger than what you are now he went back in a vision 15 years said it's a nervous condition that you've been bothered with a nerve trouble I see you can't sleep you're pacing around Restless it's a nerve cause you don't know what it is the doctors can't locate what it is they don't know what it is but God anointed the property said it's your nerves amen here's another one you had a feeling move over you that's the angel of the Lord oh he's here right between us right now that's see this here now now the lady's moving away from me she's very much distressed I see her in the bedroom she can't sleep she's walking up and down the floor she goes into another room she comes back she goes into another room she goes into a little place and gets something some kind of a little powder to take it to go to sleep and she's trying her condition is a nervous condition and she's taking powders to keep her sleep and she's taking so many of them till they just about got the best of her think just about got the best of us she's just about to go into a breakdown and be finished that's thus saith the Lord every one of them a nervous condition you can't sleep you're taking powders because I want you to understand one of Satan's tactics is to bind people with sickness and with fear and you'll find a lot of times the sickness is in our body it is a result of fear our spirit gets nervous our body gets upset your stomach gets upset it causes an ulcer many of the sickness of all goes back to nervous conditions in fear because the world of Satan's tactics he uses the greatest is fear Illinois no woman that's possessed with the demon to speak like a man to cause fear because that's what he operates in the realm of fear amen Oh hallelujah stew bound the people that fear the Prophet said now you're moving on you're the father you're moving you're showing signs and wonders the great Atomic Age is here nations against nations kingdoms up against kingdoms spirits fighting against spirits the people are nervous you said it would be fear up on the earth perplexity of time the stress between nations men's hearts failing for what a dig that we're living in mitts hearts failing them for fear perplexed of time distressed between nations the Earth's getting so nervous till it's burst and forth earthquakes everywhere Jesus said it would be that way there'd be earthquakes in diverse places what's the matter the earth knows she's doomed she's nervous the world's nervous but the church the church is rising in the gospel ducked away with security Oh an internal time perplexed the time nervous time Oh hallelujah the bride it's tucked away its security she is secured oh that my father had given me will come and no man can them out of my head that's security whoo hallelujah were not in this pocket we're not in a safe when I don't know what we are in his hands amen brother secured in the time of trouble the hour of gross darkness when gross darkness would cover the earth and gross darkness would cover the people because the children of the world walk in darkness they walk at nighttime they love darkness the Bible said men people loved darkness more than they do liked because the light would manifest their deeds a man that's when the cockroaches and the let's when all those things crawl around is in the darkness but turn the light on and watch them flee but in a time of gross darkness darkness on the land darkness on the people and the children look darkness the people loved darkness more than they love light when the spiritual darkness gets upon the earth like that then it's the time for the enemy to attack we're at that hour of gross darkness you know it sure showed me a video clip here not long ago of a river that was flooded out of its banks and the river out of its banks it struck a house and he destroyed the house broke it up and washed it away and that's exactly where Satan is tonight the spiritual darkness upon the earth has opened up the floodgates to allow the god of this evil age to unleash his destruction destruction upon the communities upon our government about our homes upon our families Satan is like a flood a raging river of water destroying everything that in its path have the people under a spirit of destruction because the puppet said God cannot bring destruction to the people or under the spirit of it that's why they're destroying their bodies that's why they destroy everything that they touch Satan is riding his horse he Satan has built his house now he's just wallpapering it this is the world that's around us as we know it today under a spirit of destruction Saint John 10:10 says that this way the thief cometh not but for to steal had to kill and to destroy he wants to steal your joy he wants to steal your peace he will store robbed you of every deadly blessing but I say let's not let him tonight God gave me joy God gave me peace God gave me healing God gave me deliverance that's the devil robbed us of none of it hey man he wants to steal your joy steal your peace Rob you've ever addicted blessing that Jesus died at Calvary for to secure for you we're living in a time when people are scared to death their nerves are on edge they can't sleep they can't eat depressed worried you sit on the people's faces at Walmart you see it at the red light you look at the VIPs almost like they're in a stoop it's almost like they don't even see they're in their own world because Satan has isolated the people isolated because we don't talk no more we got our phones they talk for us people are isolated don't you see Satan's this tactic has always been to divide and conquer divide and conquer you so you're painting the dark picture but that's what we're after is people are scared depressed worried they're tired the Restless that can't sleep they can't rest their minds are somebody told me the other day said I was up all night my mind was just racing I couldn't quit thinking what is it it's Satan's Kingdom all that is Satan's doing that's he's doing that's what he he's on this Howard she's riding the best he's ever rode right now safe and the Prophet said following you alone that great big King Lee Priest Goliath trying to scare the liver out of you the Satan trying to scare the living out of you like a kingly priests trying to rule over our lives Satan wants to rule our lives with fear he knows faith hallelujah he can't come again safe but he can work in the realm of fear if he can just get you scared oh I don't know who I'm preaching to but this is for somebody a great big King Lee priestly Goliath towering over the people I could giant trying to skill the liver out of you trying to rule our lives with fear we're living in the era or everything is a phobia now I've never seen so many phobias in all my life homophobia Islamophobia those phobias I can't even pronounce and probably don't want to everything I've never seen so much fear everything is the phobia people scared of lettuce that's a God's truth brother Joel look look at that brother people scared they go to psychiatrists and try to get hypnotized because lettuce scares them you can't make this stuff up fear phobias fear fears Satan's how to scare you thinking you go to miss the rapture a fear of dying a fear of losing the loved one a fear of being alone a fear of never marrying a fear of going out of the house I fear a bond to the markets fear of home invasions fear of riots fear of mobs fear everything is fear things happiness that people never thought people who think they're in control of their lives and all of a sudden things hit us that we didn't think it's supposed to be that way you know 2020 supposed to be like 19 we come to church three times a week we play volleyball after church on Sunday and all of a sudden it ain't like that no more all of a sudden it's changed all of a sudden the pews are taped and were isolated one from the other things happen that people didn't expect to get scared things begin to go sideways here he's supposed to be like I work God's people for heaven's sakes we followed the message but I was thinking about God bringing Israel to the promised land they had a prophet they had a pillar of fire they were coming out of bondage sound familiar and they were after Kadesh Barnea they had not been brought through many trials they had seen the hand of God a very beautiful picture of us 12 spies were sent to spy out the land I believe if my memory serves me like 40 days and they come back they come back packing a huge bundle grace takes two I'm just said my god is that a great vine see that's just one bunch that's how big they are they came back with evidence they came back with evidence that the land was exactly the way God said but 10 of them out of the 12 10 of them come back I said all yes like God said but but it's too hard it's too great of a place it's impossible that God walls they've got armies they've got cities that are well trained they're educated they're smart and we really you know as we look like grasshoppers and because we thought we were grasshoppers that's the way they perceived us we're a failure we can't do it well now God said it's a laugh oh yeah that's the grace but I'm trying to tell you you're not listening look at me focus those giants there they're scary they're big they're mean they've got tattoos it's impossible God brought us this far and we can't go no further and Caleb Joshua maybe your old man he stood up he said that's nonsense what more than able to take the land get me my mountain oh he's a quack he went in the alley well they're property you're gonna get get away from him we're trying to tell you there's giants in the land don't listen to em there's a bunch of hopped up faith 10 against two they were all numbers and that mob mentality you get a mob and get them in the direction they'll do a lot of damage a mob mentality tend against - it wasn't long till it spread throughout the entire camp how fast bad news travels and it's something somebody can get healed all I ever hear about somebody break a leg everybody hears about it how fast bad news travels the minute when it said we're not able to go up against these people that's stronger than we and they brought an evil report to the land that they searched out to the children of Israel say in the land which we have go to searches the land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people we saw an army and a great statue and all the congregation look how fast this fear went through the church the Bible said all the congregation except for two as far as I know all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night they were no sleeping in Israel that night their fear produced insomnia the nervous condition the report that they believed changed their whole attitude changed their whole atmosphere and they went from a people of God's people who had saw miracles and wonders and they become a people that were scared to death what are we going to do and they cried and they wailed and every time they take a breath to cry again they heard somebody snoring you know who it was capable that was no sleep in the camp because the report caused him to lose confidence in the god that gave him the promise but kind of never lost his faith he just laid down and his sleep was sweet cousin said I'll tell you one day I'm gonna sleep about eight hours and then we'll get up in the morning and I'm going to start with my sword now I'm gonna go get my Mountain now what made Caleb so sure when the opposition was so great God brother you're not listening you don't know how bad this thing is it's spreading throughout the message all kinds of churches people getting infected oh my lord you just don't realize how bad it is but look at Caleb he never catered to that fear he never even entertained it what make Caleb's is sure what the opposition was so great it's according to what you look at it's according to what you take care it's according to what you believe in what you hear Caleb was looking at the promise of God his confidence was in God the other kids were looking at their circumstances if you go to looking at your circumstances or look what's around you you're sure to fail you must never look at what's around you never look at what's around you look at the promise that's where Eve made her fatal mistake Satan come along with this theology and she mixes theology with what God gave her and she gave it to Adam and it caused a hybrid faith you won't have her faith will do nothing well I believe but hybrid faith commotions well I believe that the doctor said hybrid faith hybrid faith cannot produce life but faith in God's Word the doctor may say you're a double tensor but faith in God's Word can cause that to dissolve out of your body I've seen God do it I know he's able to do it amen she mixed it gave it to hi Adam a hybrid faith that's what the church has got today the so-called Church a hybrid faith it's mixed with fear and doubt and frustration are you hearing me tonight so if you've got four well I believe I believe the message but if you've got fear and doubt and frustration you've got hybrid faith hybrid faith is mixed with fear doubt frustration or brother I thought you said fear and faith don't mix fear and faith don't mix but hybrid faith and fear does mix there's splits with hybrid faith and pure faith hallelujah amen amen it's frustration if it was genuine faith Taylor continued on faith it wouldn't move when God says anything it'll be that way if God says it'll be that way the Prophet said if God said George Washington what's going to get up in five minutes I'd say get him a chair so he could shut down when he gets up because God does not lie we're just who's recovering from the from the accident or a woman from the Institute's coming to call me said mr. Ward can I talk to you I said yes ma'am said this is not about Jessica said it's about someone else I said yes ma'am she said there's a boy that we've got a class that he he got choked on a hot dog had sprain damage so he's not able to speak said his mama said they're Christians like you are they're Christians his father's a pastor also said his boys mother's telling everybody that God spoke to her and said on a certain date her boy will speak I said yes ma'am she said with mr. Ward here's what I want to ask you said if that's just a few days away and from what I can see there is no way that boy can speak and she said if he don't speak mr. Ward she was such a nice lady she was so concerned she said I'm so afraid if that boy don't speak it will crush that woman because she's told everybody that God said so I said well ma'am I am NOT a smart person but there's one thing I do know if God said the boy will speak it maybe one second before that time expires but that boy will speak because God does not lie now if the woman got an impression or thought not said that then that's something else but if God said the boy will talk he will talk because God does not live I'm so glad my confidence isn't that kind of God tonight not a wishy-washy God that spins a will but a God who speaks it and confirms it and backs it up and manifest it to his people amen amen Oh hallelujah genuine faith wouldn't move but she mixed it up with what Satan gave her turned it together said here it is you see Satan wants you to see the problem but not the answer he wants you to see the symptom but not the healing he wants you to see the chaos but not the calm he wants you to see the storm but not the rainbow the darkness but not the light but I say to you don't see the problem see the answer don't look at the symptom as long as you look at that arm as long as you look at that throat you'll never be able to swallow don't look to that look to that either a my head so nervous Said's what is it the Prophet said the churches are in an erotic age every church is proselyte in pulling and fussing and steward so neurotic aids the world in chaos but I say stand still God's calling his church to halt see stand still don't be jumping around running around not knowing what you're doing be sure be sure whom you believe be sure of your testimony be sure of your experience be sure of who you are and stand on it I'm not a Christian because I feel like it I'm a Christian because I met God's requirements amen amen amen be confident the one who gave the promise had to give a solemn warning to the church stand still God always commands to stand still before he does anything stand still and see the promises of God God doesn't make a promise that he can't keep God will bankrupt heaven before he'll let one promise of his word fail Oh hallelujah tonight we have a word from the Lord amen he told us these things would come he told us this time would be he told us what to look for did he not do it did he not prepare us did he not make us aware for the signs and the times in the hours that were living in is to take none of us by surprise he said these things would come men's hearts would sell for fear in a day of fear it's not something that's coming in here a man told us what to look for he said when these things begin to come to pass they lift up your heads your redemption comes back comes coming 9 amen you see tonight my brother my sister the prophecy said that's my message to the church it stands still and looked to the promise stand still don't be caught up on all this fanaticism we're going on don't get caught up in taking sides and all these things that's going on be sure be sure in whom you have believed they may stand upon the promise of his word of who we are the seals have been open to reveal to us who we are where we come from what our position is the sons and daughters of God he's gave us these things not to put on a chef somewhere not just to marked up with a highlighter but he gave us these things to believe it and to live it amen oh I'm so happy too that brother Louie we serve a God who turns water to wine I love it right there turns water to wine and some of the best wine he ever put to you

went to Jesus in the boat I know I preach don't hear not a while back but what I was looking at is my mind way straight back to that story of Jesus in the boat knowing the storm was covered knowing it would be a cat 5 hurricane no doubt a major storm knowing the cells would be torn no the boat would fill with water knowing that the sciples would be frenetic and woods filled with fear screaming and running around he knew every bit of that because he was the word yet what did he do he laid down and he went to sleep because the word said with all the hair stem that shall not be afraid sleep sweet he just laid down and went to sleep because he knew the word would override the storm be not afraid of a sudden fear me not afraid of the sudden storm being unafraid of the desolation of the wicked did not afraid when it comes by the Lord shall be that confidence that Lord shall bear that confidence his sleepless week because he knew who he was hookah Oh God let that strike us tonight his sleep was sweet because he knew who he was and he had confidence if the God who made him that that he would pass to the other side because the Son of God had spoke the word who were the son of God Bob faith takes the word into his heart and spits it back upon his lips every mountain must move it's just the same as deity speak God give me that confidence in your word that in the hurricane category five storm I can get some of the best sleep sleep she'll be sweet laughter wake up are you tired no I feel pretty good that was a restful sleep what's the matter what's going on oh oh it's a storm it's a peace be still okay let's go to the other side Psalms 27 the host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the hosts you remember Elijah remembers out there camping okay hazel Elijah and he got up that morning don't know how he got hazed to be in the servant he said put the coffee on him okay he goes out to get the coffee and he walks outside the Tennyson hey Raj better come out here what's the matter you better come and see and the largest steps is head outlet and he looks around hey Shou well my goodness there's more of us than there are them make the coffee and I just go on I don't to be disrespectful but are you sure What did he say God opened the boy's eyes and I say to you didn't I hole in our weakness and we may be looking so weak but as brother Tommy's been preacher in perfect weakness comes perfect strength and I say to you tonight there's more of us there's more than us so we are an army we're two armies amen the hostess kept against me my heart shall not fear though this war shall rise against me and this will I be confident one thing about the side of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord to enquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock Philippians 1:6 says be confident being confident of this very thing that he was begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ he never brought us this far to leave us he never told us to swim to let us drowned he never umbilical nests to move away and he never lifted us up to let us down he never created us to forget us he created us for himself [Laughter] that's why Satan hates us what he wants to destroy what God created for himself it was anything he ever asked for he didn't have a car he didn't have a chariot he didn't help us he didn't have more than one change of clothes as far as I know but he never asked God for a new suit to preach it he never asked God for a new tractor idea he never asked God for a good out the only thing he ever ask the Father for was both foolish be a confident of this very thing he that started the hook I've never done it myself but you never did you you was looking for you he come looking for us we wasn't trying to find Elijah God sent Elijah to find us a bird being competent in this very thing that he who started the work in us will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ like Ruth like Ruth were arrested we're just resting waiting on his Lord he finished the work at Calvary but before he can come and take us to his home he goes home first to prepare a place for us so we're just resting in sleep sweet sleep resting relaxing remember the prophet of God said under the Seventh Seal it's laxing time why because the open of the word reveals to us who we are brother Joe I don't have to guess no war I know I come from God I know I go back to God I know that my DNA is God's DNA and I can no more die than God can die how can no more be lost than God the seals revealed them to me my position he just didn't tell me who brother Branham was but the opening of the work he come to tell me who I am and I'm resting now waiting on him to build the home he promised to build for his queen that Ruth were West resting he said let not your hearts be troubled if you believe in God believe also in me and my father's house are many mansions if it wasn't so I would have told you so because you're my bride I don't keep secrets from you I would have told you so I told you I felt good but you understand this word this message is God's very hard to us sir to us his love secrets think of it let not your heart be troubled believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many men in wasn't so I'm what I told you but I'll go and prepare a place for you if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again I will return again and receive you to myself home brother bread how do you love you to that there is no peace to a troubled heart to a sinful heart there cannot be peace the man longs to drink he calls because that life he thinks he's having a big time it shows his emptiness take a man make a million dollars he wants to take a man that goes to party drinks one drink tonight he wants another take a man lives untruth his wife once you live it again vice versa see it's something he's never satisfied he might have a million dollars in his hand ten million in his hand he lays down at night with a drunken still on him he wakes up the next morning haunted nightmares troubled mind and you call that peace that's no peace that's the world today trouble sleep nightmares who died long ago someone I think it was in this church somewhere I was preaching I believe it was in they don't matter who it was that somebody come to me with having nightmare said I have nightmares at night I said you don't never have to have another one you let your nightmares right here take good dreams and go back with them you have to live that way troubled Minds can't rest can't stop thinking about what's going on he never wanted us to live that way that's not the way he wants us to live I give you peace not as the world giveth give unto thee the man I'm coming to a close a man may not have a pillar to press his head to oh I love this right here a man may not even have a pill at the press's head - he may not even own a decent pair of shoes or be able to have a decent meal in his house but if God reigns in his heart he can go to bed happy and he wakes up happy it's a lasting peace because he's got confidence that God told David I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed beggin for bread so when I have meat of it he will provide it for me so troubalert you'll give it to us not when we think we need it but when he knows it'll be right old if you go to bed happy and he wakes up happy it's a lasting peace it's something that God does it's our confidence in our Lord that he'll never leave us nor will he forsake us brother sister he said brother Harry your brother's come
