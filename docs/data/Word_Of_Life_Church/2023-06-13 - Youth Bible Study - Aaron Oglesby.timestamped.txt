[23:48] I'd start out with this one I might grab
[23:51] that other one
[23:54] God bless you it's such a privilege for
[23:56] us to be together tonight
[23:58] let's turn to Matthew chapter 27 if you
[24:00] would
[24:04] Matthew 27
[24:07] verse 27.
[24:10] than the soldiers of the governor took
[24:13] Jesus into the common Hall
[24:16] and gathered unto him the whole band of
[24:19] soldiers
[24:21] and they stripped him
[24:23] and put on him a Scarlet robe
[24:27] when that planted a crown of thorns
[24:30] they put it upon his head
[24:32] and a read in his right hand
[24:36] and they bowed the knee before him
[24:39] and mocked him saying hail
[24:43] King of the Jews
[24:45] and they spit upon him
[24:47] and took the Reed
[24:49] and smote him on the head
[24:53] and after that they had mocked him they
[24:56] took the robe off from him and put his
[24:58] own raiment on him and led him away to
[25:02] crucify
[25:03] and as they came out they found a man of
[25:06] Cyrene Simon by name him they compelled
[25:09] to bury his cross
[25:11] and they were coming to a place called
[25:13] Golgotha that is to say a place of a
[25:17] skull
[25:18] they gave him vinegar to drink mingle
[25:21] was Gall and when he had tasted thereof
[25:24] he would not drink
[25:26] and they crucified him
[25:30] and parted his garments casting lots
[25:33] that it might be fulfilled which was
[25:35] spoken
[25:36] by the prophet they parted my garments
[25:39] among them and upon my Vester did they
[25:43] cast lots
[25:45] I made lots of be remembered tonight in
[25:46] prayers we pray and ask God's blessings
[25:49] over the word
[25:52] Heavenly Father we
[25:54] count it such an honor
[25:57] that we could be gathered together again
[25:59] here tonight Lord in your presence
[26:02] we thank you for each one of these young
[26:05] people we thank you Father for the
[26:08] adults that are here to prepare the food
[26:10] and serve and all of that we so
[26:13] appreciate each of them
[26:15] brother Rob we thank you for his
[26:17] commitment him and Sister Sarah Lord and
[26:21] brother Joe and each one that's here
[26:24] Lord the musicians the brothers on the
[26:27] sound we're just thankful for each one
[26:29] that's put forth our effort to be here
[26:31] we pray tonight that you would help us
[26:34] Lord God help me to get out of the way
[26:36] that you could use me for a few moments
[26:39] to speak something to their hearts that
[26:42] would help them you saw their hands that
[26:44] were uplifted you know the needs and the
[26:47] requests there I pray that your granted
[26:49] father in the name of the Lord Jesus
[26:52] amen God bless you you may be seated
[26:58] I'd like to speak to you for just a
[27:00] little bit tonight on
[27:03] what all of us of course have heard
[27:05] since we were children many of you were
[27:08] raised in church and in Sunday school
[27:10] and the cross and Calvary and the blood
[27:14] was part of the foundation of what we
[27:18] heard about
[27:20] but I'd like to speak to you tonight on
[27:23] that day on Calvary
[27:26] there's three things that we'd like to
[27:28] look about about tonight at at Calvary
[27:31] what that day was
[27:34] what that day did for us
[27:36] and what we can do for that day
[27:41] it truly was up to that particular time
[27:44] the greatest day
[27:46] that it ever dawned upon the Earth
[27:49] although the setting that we would read
[27:52] from tonight wouldn't seem like a great
[27:55] day
[27:56] they spit upon him they mocked him they
[27:59] ridiculed him they stripped his clothes
[28:01] off of him put a purple robe on him
[28:05] put a scepter fake scepter a rod in his
[28:08] hand
[28:09] they laughed at him they ridiculed him
[28:13] what would look like shame and dishonor
[28:17] and great reproach
[28:19] yet it would turn out to be one of the
[28:21] greatest days that man would have ever
[28:24] known
[28:26] and yet for the people that was doing it
[28:28] they were laughing jeering making fun of
[28:32] him ridiculing him now keep in mind this
[28:36] is of course the Lord Jesus how many of
[28:38] us wants to be like him
[28:40] but not this way they were doing
[28:43] this is a painful way isn't it
[28:45] this is painful it hurts me to to read
[28:48] about it it hurts me to in my mind and
[28:52] vision
[28:53] what he must have went through and even
[28:57] though Matthew declares it very vividly
[29:00] Luke a little different Mark a little
[29:02] different John a little different but
[29:05] I'm sure that they even themselves could
[29:08] not have caught what it was in the eyes
[29:10] of God why was this day necessary
[29:14] it was because our father in the Garden
[29:16] of Eden forfeited his rights to the
[29:20] eternal life
[29:21] when he forfeited his rights he
[29:23] forfeited ours all the human race was
[29:27] standing there in the balance in the
[29:29] Garden of Eden
[29:30] the Bible doesn't really tell us how
[29:32] enlightened that Adam really was to the
[29:35] future we don't know if he had an
[29:38] understanding that there would have been
[29:40] countless of generations of people if he
[29:43] knew there would be billions of people
[29:45] that will live on the face of the Earth
[29:46] was his understanding somewhat darkened
[29:49] to what he was going to do that by
[29:53] trading out the Book of Life there in
[29:56] the Garden of Eden that he would put all
[29:58] of these billions of people under this
[30:01] curse but Adam of course in that sense
[30:06] he was acting out of what the Lord Jesus
[30:09] would do later but I want you to
[30:11] remember with me tonight that sin
[30:14] actually did not begin in the Garden of
[30:17] Eden
[30:18] sin never started in the Garden of Eden
[30:21] it wasn't whenever Eve believed the LIE
[30:24] of the devil sin did not start actually
[30:26] whenever Adam forfeited his rights but
[30:29] sin started in heaven that might be hard
[30:33] for us to understand things in such a
[30:35] holy perfect place but that's exactly
[30:38] where sin started and God because of
[30:41] that they knew that there would be a day
[30:43] that would be absolutely essential to be
[30:48] Calvary
[30:49] what a day that it would be all of
[30:51] humanity of the elect would wait for
[30:54] that time they would long for the time
[30:57] of redemption when man could be called
[30:59] back into his rightful place and yet
[31:03] here it stands would it look like a
[31:05] deliverer to any of us
[31:07] if we would have stood there that day
[31:09] and we would have been out in the crowd
[31:11] of the Jews or the Gentiles which would
[31:13] have been right on the outside and if we
[31:15] would have stood there we would have
[31:17] looked at this man and we pierced
[31:19] through the gates
[31:20] and we see a man there that was not not
[31:23] a very big man at all
[31:25] not a large man a man of small stature a
[31:29] man that was so misunderstood that some
[31:32] called him a devil some called him God
[31:34] they didn't know exactly even who he was
[31:35] but yet a man that would be able to
[31:39] suffer all of this that we just read
[31:41] about
[31:42] and would we have understood what was
[31:45] going on the disciples didn't they were
[31:47] there they loved him but they didn't
[31:50] understand what he was going through it
[31:52] was the sin question that is not going
[31:56] to be answered that day on Calvary would
[32:00] totally eradicate the power of sin on
[32:04] Adam's race now what's amazing is that
[32:07] it started this great work and yet we're
[32:09] still dealing with it to this day but to
[32:12] many of you that are sitting here
[32:13] tonight and those that will hear this
[32:15] service the power of sin has already
[32:17] been eradicated in your life you will
[32:21] never be a sinner again because of what
[32:25] that day on Calvary
[32:28] so that day on Calvary the prophet says
[32:30] it this way and I wasn't going to go
[32:32] this way tonight but I felt led to the
[32:35] Lord to listen to this sermon today that
[32:37] day on Calvary and as I did it was like
[32:39] the Lord just pulled me into this place
[32:41] and just started dropping this stuff in
[32:44] my heart and I put this sermon together
[32:46] and maybe 30 or 40 minutes which is not
[32:49] like me at all generally takes me days
[32:51] because of the way that I study but
[32:54] brother Brahm said the one great
[32:55] important thing about Calvary what it
[32:57] means to us and to the world is that it
[32:59] settled the sin question wants and for
[33:04] all man was found guilty of sin and sin
[33:07] was a penalty that no man could pay so
[33:12] God orchestrated this whole thing in a
[33:15] way that the Judgment price would be so
[33:17] high that no mortal could ever pay it
[33:20] why would he do that brother Donnie he
[33:22] did it so that he himself would be the
[33:26] only one that could pay it because if
[33:29] any man could pay that sin penalty then
[33:33] that man would be able to say I do not
[33:36] need Jesus Christ as my savior now you
[33:40] realize no matter what good we do and
[33:42] the things that we do to help people and
[33:44] all of that none of that will ever pay
[33:46] our sin penalty is that right we must
[33:49] have him to do it no no it doesn't make
[33:52] any difference how long you've been
[33:53] saved I I'm probably the oldest person
[33:56] in the building tonight me and Carol and
[33:58] we've probably been saved more than
[34:00] longer than you all have and I've done a
[34:03] lot of things for the Lord by his grace
[34:04] I'm glad to say that praise the Lord
[34:06] I've helped a lot of people around the
[34:08] world preach thousands of sermons on all
[34:11] kinds of things but if you piled all
[34:13] that together in one pile it wouldn't
[34:15] get me that high off the ground it would
[34:18] not buy me five minutes worth of
[34:21] Salvation there's nothing any of us can
[34:24] do to be able to get that because the
[34:27] price was too high so God said it to
[34:30] where that there was only one person
[34:32] that can pay the penalty and that would
[34:35] be him himself
[34:37] so that day on Calvary now notice
[34:39] brother Brown goes on to say the penalty
[34:42] of sin was death and we were all born in
[34:45] sin shape and iniquity come to the world
[34:48] speaking lies so none of us were worthy
[34:51] it wouldn't make any difference who it
[34:52] was Moses Jeremiah Ezekiel none of the
[34:55] prophets none of the great songwriters
[34:57] musicians there's no way for it to be
[34:59] now he goes on to say sin did not start
[35:02] in the Earth but sin actually started in
[35:05] heaven the devil was a condemned
[35:09] creature that was cast to the Earth he
[35:12] said for his Disobedience and he said
[35:14] sin began in heaven so what did Calvary
[35:19] mean he says that's what Calvary meant
[35:22] men were in bondage they were set free
[35:25] men that were once under fear of death
[35:29] can no longer fear deaths our sins are
[35:33] gone praise the Lord our sins are gone
[35:36] that day at Calvary paid the price
[35:41] so first of all we want to look at what
[35:44] that day was so it's going to bring man
[35:47] to a place to where that man can finally
[35:50] be set free from sin now would he make
[35:53] mistakes every day of his life
[35:55] thereafter but yet that changed nature
[35:59] inside of him will never revert back to
[36:03] being a sinner again aren't you grateful
[36:05] for that tonight how many of y'all still
[36:06] make mistakes oh the rest of his lying
[36:09] you might as well raise your hands too
[36:10] we all do and that's the human part that
[36:13] we will despise and deal with every day
[36:16] of our life but once you're totally
[36:18] converted and receive the baptism of the
[36:20] Holy Ghost you will never be a sinner
[36:23] again it's totally impossible that
[36:26] nature is eradicated what made that
[36:29] possible that day on Calvary now no
[36:33] doubt many of you have fallen like I've
[36:35] fallen your bums and dads the great
[36:37] people that you honor and respect and
[36:40] we've fallen short of the girl glory of
[36:41] God and what do we do when we do that we
[36:44] go right back and we repent and we make
[36:47] that thing right with God is that right
[36:49] but it does not mean that we need to be
[36:51] received again or re-baptized again but
[36:55] it simply means that we repent and
[36:57] confess our sins and the Lord cleanses
[36:59] us how is that possible that day on
[37:02] Calvary aren't you glad the Lord Jesus
[37:04] didn't have to come in every Church age
[37:06] and die in every Church age and face the
[37:09] same deaths over and over this death was
[37:13] so powerful It produced such a release
[37:16] from sin it was once and for all once
[37:21] and forever that makes me feel like
[37:23] Shalom right now he does not have to do
[37:26] it again and again and again it was so
[37:30] powerful it released every child of God
[37:34] that was going to come in the future
[37:36] think of how many millions times
[37:39] millions of people have accepted that
[37:42] day now sad about it is many of them
[37:44] don't go any farther than that day but
[37:47] at least thank God they accept that day
[37:50] what many people be saved that don't
[37:52] know what you and I know yes they will
[37:54] they will not be bride but they will be
[37:57] saved on what basis because they accept
[38:00] that day on Calvary but you and I want
[38:04] to be able to go further into these
[38:07] other two captions of what God has about
[38:10] Calvary so first of all we know what
[38:13] that day was and what it meant it's
[38:16] going to be the terminating power of
[38:18] Satan holding man's Soul captive and the
[38:22] Lord Jesus produced that great atonement
[38:25] to release us from that now notice
[38:28] brother Ram goes on to say that's what
[38:30] Calvary meant men that were in bondage
[38:33] were set free so first of all what did
[38:36] it mean I love the way he says this
[38:38] first we should seek what that day meant
[38:41] then second we should see what that day
[38:45] has done for us now what it did for us
[38:50] now third now this seems very odd now
[38:53] third let's look and see what we
[38:57] ought to do for that day
[39:01] well how is that possible now if we
[39:04] would go back in our minds to Iwo Jima
[39:06] if we would go back to the Korean
[39:09] conflict if we would go back to the days
[39:11] of Vietnam if we would go back to the
[39:13] days of the battles of Saiyan Antietam
[39:16] in the Civil War or we would go to
[39:18] Sharpsburg or we would go to the days
[39:21] when the in the Napoleonic Wars and we
[39:24] would try to go back and say how could I
[39:26] ever add anything to a day which has
[39:30] been in the past this seems unusual does
[39:33] it not but yet Calvary is so designed
[39:37] and the work of Calvary is so designed
[39:40] that you young people sitting here
[39:42] tonight can actually complement what
[39:46] happened two thousand years ago there's
[39:49] nothing we can do now that will ever
[39:51] change anything historically about the
[39:55] Civil War is that right or the
[39:57] Napoleonic Wars or the wars that went on
[40:00] in the time of Babylon and Assyria and
[40:03] so on and so on but yet we are
[40:05] privileged by the grace of God to be
[40:07] able to complement what happened two
[40:10] thousand years ago on that day on
[40:13] Calvary of our Lord Jesus when he did on
[40:15] the cross you say how is that even
[40:17] possible because he testifies and gives
[40:21] us his own life back inside of us and
[40:25] when we witness that we are receiving
[40:27] today of that power that he did two
[40:30] thousand years ago we are actually
[40:33] complementing that day two thousand
[40:36] years ago now Robert E Lee never knew
[40:39] your name you'll never know him those
[40:41] days that have gone by but this day was
[40:44] different than any day that's ever been
[40:47] now this is where so many people miss
[40:50] the third phase of that day on Calvary
[40:54] they Rejoice of what happened that day
[40:56] and they can even go to part two and say
[41:00] well I'll tell you what it means this to
[41:02] me and that to me and that's all well
[41:05] and good but we don't want to stop at
[41:08] first part or the second part but we
[41:10] want to go to the third part and say
[41:13] what can I do to that day on Calvary
[41:17] what can I do that would be a proof that
[41:22] would be such a testimony that that day
[41:25] was a success you believe we can
[41:29] now notice he said so first we should
[41:31] see what that day meant second we should
[41:35] see what that day has done for us now if
[41:37] I would stop right now and ask each one
[41:40] of you to come and give your personal
[41:42] testimony and you would say well the
[41:44] Lord saved me and I I growed up in a
[41:47] message church maybe others would say I
[41:50] didn't know nothing about religion I
[41:52] didn't know nothing about God and God
[41:54] got a hold to man He Set Me Free by the
[41:57] power of the Cross and each one of our
[41:58] testimonies would be a little bit
[42:00] different well that's part one and
[42:03] that's part two but what about part
[42:05] three now part three is he said let us
[42:09] look at what we
[42:11] ought to do for that day and he repeats
[42:15] it what we
[42:16] ought to do now it's amazing now he goes
[42:19] into the realm of how is that possible
[42:23] that we would be able to complement or
[42:26] testify if you will into the Third phase
[42:29] of this day that we would actually make
[42:33] this day even greater and I hope you
[42:35] understand that in the first century and
[42:37] those Christians for the first few years
[42:39] and they testified the power of the
[42:41] Cross and they testified of what God
[42:43] done and no doubt Rome thought that it
[42:46] would fade away and they'd even said
[42:48] that they believed that it would until
[42:51] they began to kill these Martyrs and
[42:54] then they took note that these Martyrs
[42:57] christianos as they call them and they
[43:00] noticed something so different because
[43:02] it was not just the Christians that they
[43:05] would put in the arena now remember it
[43:07] was Nero that began to take our brothers
[43:10] and sisters and he would set them out in
[43:13] his Gardens in the beautiful gardens of
[43:15] Nero they say was absolutely incredible
[43:18] the gardens that he had around his
[43:20] Palace and they would take these
[43:22] Christians and they would ramp them up
[43:24] in war and they would tie strings around
[43:27] this wool they then they would pour
[43:30] pitch we know it is tar t-a-r and they
[43:33] would pour this pitch on this sheep's
[43:36] wool and when it would get dark they
[43:38] would take a torch and light that wool
[43:41] and the Christians were on the inside of
[43:43] that wool and he would go through his
[43:46] garden at night and walk the paths and
[43:49] how it was all laid out them Christians
[43:52] were his torch their bodies were burning
[43:55] you imagine their flesh as it was
[43:58] melting merged inside those sheep wool
[44:01] what kind of a cruel individual this was
[44:05] but they expected them to scream and beg
[44:09] for mercy but what was so strange many
[44:13] of these christianos what they would do
[44:16] they would start singing
[44:19] so say brother Rob was right here and
[44:22] brother Joel was on down the paths a
[44:24] little farther and I would have been on
[44:26] down the path and then some of you
[44:27] brothers and sisters because they burnt
[44:30] young people too
[44:32] just like you
[44:34] but what they found about these
[44:36] Christians was they would start singing
[44:40] and praising and worshiping the Lord
[44:43] Jesus
[44:45] and they would pray
[44:47] and some of their last breaths were into
[44:50] thy hands I commit my spirit
[44:54] but they were also burning other people
[44:57] and you know what they would do they
[45:00] would curse Rome
[45:02] they would do all kinds of horrible
[45:05] language and say horrible things but not
[45:09] the Christians
[45:10] so what were the Christians doing
[45:13] the third phase of this right here we're
[45:16] talking about tonight
[45:18] they were complementing that day of
[45:20] Calvary now notice how eternal life
[45:23] expresses itself it's it's so different
[45:26] from any other life that there is
[45:30] what's the prophet as he breaks into
[45:31] this Jesus never lived for himself
[45:35] his life was spent for others that's
[45:38] perfectly
[45:40] eternal life
[45:41] now none of us have this on our own
[45:46] we can do things for others and we can
[45:48] do things especially for those we like
[45:52] that's the way we are isn't it our
[45:55] friends our buddies our Pals whatever
[45:57] you call your close Circle your intimate
[46:00] friends why we would do we would do just
[46:02] great things for them
[46:04] but that's not what separates eternal
[46:07] life from human life
[46:08] because Sinners will do the same thing
[46:12] but eternal life would actually do
[46:15] something for the person that you know
[46:18] would kill you
[46:21] we just don't have that within us as a
[46:24] human
[46:25] but now Jesus comes to the Earth and
[46:28] he's so different even from Moses
[46:32] even from Ezekiel Jeremiah great man
[46:35] that loved God but they did not have
[46:38] eternal life in this way that Jesus did
[46:42] now he said when you said well you go to
[46:44] church and you do good things that's
[46:46] fine but when you live your life
[46:50] to yourself now here he doesn't say for
[46:54] yourself
[46:55] but to yourself
[46:58] so you pulled away from the body
[47:01] I don't need to go to church I don't
[47:04] need nobody and they don't need me
[47:08] that's one of the greatest signs that
[47:11] you do not have eternal life
[47:16] I don't care how much you run jump you
[47:19] can walk the backs of these chairs
[47:22] but if you feel and see no need
[47:26] to Fellowship
[47:27] and to be with the saints of God
[47:31] you need more than what you have
[47:34] so what if the Lord Jesus would have had
[47:37] that concept
[47:38] you know what I've thought about it and
[47:40] I really don't want to go down there
[47:43] because it's bad
[47:45] it's bad I'm going to leave the praise
[47:48] of angels I'm from the very first day
[47:51] that I take the breath of life until the
[47:53] last day that I live they're going to
[47:55] hate me they're going to run me down
[47:57] they're going to call me every name they
[47:59] can think of I'm just not sure that I
[48:02] want to deal with that
[48:04] so what if he would have stayed in
[48:06] heaven himself guess what I wouldn't be
[48:08] preaching the sermons tonight
[48:10] you all wouldn't be here listen to it
[48:12] because there would be no that day
[48:15] on Calvary
[48:18] so eternal life is not living for
[48:21] ourself or living to ourself so I'm just
[48:25] pulling away from everybody
[48:27] you know it's risky loving folks
[48:31] praise the Lord
[48:33] how many's ever been hurt by people
[48:34] friends yeah I'm sure we all have so
[48:38] it's risky loving folks let me bring it
[48:41] on down to your level it was risky your
[48:45] mom and daddy bringing you into the
[48:46] Earth
[48:49] I didn't figure y'all would say Amen on
[48:51] that one
[48:51] because there's no way for them to know
[48:54] what you're going to do to them
[48:57] there's no way at all for them to know
[48:59] how you're going to turn out are you
[49:01] going to turn against them one day are
[49:04] you going to do something that would
[49:05] bring such reproach on the family and
[49:08] your family would have to hang its head
[49:10] in shame because of some well there's no
[49:12] way for them to know that
[49:14] so you're just as wee little tiny thing
[49:17] and oh they just love you so much and
[49:19] they think you'd never break their heart
[49:21] well there's no way for them to know it
[49:22] are they so then we get older and we
[49:25] start making friends and we you know get
[49:27] a little bit older than that we like a
[49:29] boy or a girl you know we say oh my
[49:32] goodness he's just so cute and she just
[49:34] so pretty oh I think I met my soul mate
[49:38] yeah how many times have we heard that
[49:40] and yet six months from that time that
[49:43] soul mate tore your soul out of your
[49:45] body you felt like you said how in the
[49:48] world could they
[49:49] could that way well there's a risk of
[49:51] getting a boyfriend or a girlfriend is
[49:54] that right there's a risk whenever you
[49:56] have a circle in the church and you say
[49:59] oh my we're just our little click is so
[50:01] clicky and we all click together because
[50:03] our clicks really click so good and
[50:06] we're just so clicky I know somebody
[50:08] gets in the click that breaks the click
[50:10] and then all of a sudden you're thinking
[50:12] what happened to us we were just so
[50:13] lovey-dovey everything was going so good
[50:16] and you invited somebody else into your
[50:18] Clique that you found that wouldn't
[50:19] click with your click
[50:21] and now you all ain't clicking so good
[50:23] either are you
[50:25] but it's risky it's risky it's risky for
[50:29] you let me just sit this way it's risky
[50:31] for you to trust me
[50:35] it's risky for you to trust any preacher
[50:40] any preacher I know
[50:43] I've been hurt by lots of them all
[50:46] around the world they've lied to me like
[50:48] a dog
[50:49] they've lied to me over money they've
[50:52] lied to me over that they've lied over
[50:54] one thing and another brother Donnie do
[50:56] you trust any of them I sure do
[50:59] maybe not them ones that lied but
[51:02] there are ones you can trust it's risky
[51:05] you understand it's risky loving folks
[51:08] and trusting them
[51:11] so what do a lot of people do they just
[51:13] pull off to themselves I'm not going to
[51:16] be hurt by nobody
[51:19] I'm not going to be hurt by no preacher
[51:21] so I ain't going to believe in no
[51:23] preachers well if you don't believe in
[51:24] Preachers you don't believe God's word
[51:28] and if you don't believe in Saints you
[51:30] don't believe in God's word
[51:32] if you don't believe he's going to have
[51:33] a body you don't believe God's word
[51:37] is it worth the risk yes friends it is
[51:40] worth the risk
[51:42] because you know what you may get hurt
[51:44] by some but God if you will allow him
[51:46] God will put friends in your life that
[51:49] will stick with you through thick and
[51:51] thin how many knows that's the truth
[51:53] your witness of that right here tonight
[51:55] so what do we do now eternal life then
[52:00] is living in a way that is beyond what
[52:04] we can live or sell
[52:05] now notice what that day on Calvary did
[52:08] it paid the price that could not be paid
[52:11] by anyone else
[52:14] so those who receive the effect of
[52:16] Calvary could receive eternal life into
[52:20] themself and live a life that no one
[52:23] else can live except those who have
[52:27] eternal life this is what separates us
[52:29] even in our own Human family
[52:32] notice what he says but when you live
[52:34] your life to yourself you haven't
[52:37] eternal life
[52:38] eternal life is living for others it
[52:40] proves it when he come and the Lamb of
[52:43] God he lived and had eternal life
[52:44] because he did not live for himself he
[52:48] lived for others and you receive eternal
[52:50] life by receiving that day that day you
[52:55] don't live for yourself no more you live
[52:58] for others now watch brother Brown
[53:00] brings it to himself someone said how
[53:03] can you stand and let anyone call you
[53:06] such bad names he said this is his
[53:10] answer
[53:10] you don't live for yourself
[53:13] now I don't know about you
[53:16] I tend to shun away from those who call
[53:18] me bad names
[53:22] oh no come on don't sit there and look
[53:23] at man you want me to think you all
[53:25] don't do that too
[53:27] actually the Johnson City Press put my
[53:29] picture in there and printed lies that I
[53:32] didn't even say I dare say if they call
[53:35] me and want an interview again I'm going
[53:37] to hang up my phone as fast as I can why
[53:40] I don't trust them
[53:42] but you know what makes it even worse is
[53:44] when we don't trust folks we go to
[53:46] church with
[53:47] and we don't trust Christians
[53:50] and that's exactly what Satan wants us
[53:52] to do and get us all isolated so we just
[53:56] pull away and pull away and pull away
[53:59] and then we don't live for others
[54:05] knows what he said you don't live for
[54:08] yourself
[54:09] you live for others that you might
[54:12] redeem
[54:14] that man now here's the key
[54:17] you become sons and the trouble of it is
[54:19] the church is forgot that we're Sons
[54:21] you're taking
[54:23] Christ's place
[54:26] your sons now listen how he says we're
[54:29] taking Christ's place
[54:31] so you don't live for yourself
[54:34] you'll live for others I Marvel
[54:37] that we preached this we're taking
[54:39] Christ's place but we hear it preach so
[54:42] much that it's just in praying for the
[54:44] sick and miracles and signs and wonders
[54:47] and healing and that's not the only
[54:49] thing that he did
[54:51] right here is an Avenue that many
[54:53] miracle workers will never live
[54:56] why they don't have eternal life
[54:58] you see you can be anointed to pray for
[55:01] the sick and still not have
[55:03] eternal life
[55:06] um
[55:07] notice this well brother Branham I can
[55:10] live for this brother
[55:12] because he is such a nice man
[55:16] that's not it
[55:18] live for that man
[55:20] who hates you
[55:28] so how many of us pray for our enemies
[55:33] brother James the only one
[55:41] how many wants to be more willing to
[55:43] pray for your enemies ah ah God bless
[55:45] you yeah out
[55:49] so you see we needed that day
[55:54] to not only forgive us
[55:57] but to enable us
[55:59] to forgive
[56:02] I marveled yesterday at the service and
[56:04] the way the Lord led me because I just
[56:07] had planned on spending a few minutes on
[56:09] forgiveness and all of that Mark 11
[56:12] 22-24 but the more got into it the more
[56:15] I couldn't get out of it
[56:17] by the time I got home yesterday I'd
[56:19] started receiving texts and emails and
[56:22] been hearing them all through the day
[56:24] today and I realized how needful that
[56:27] that really was because his Mortals we
[56:31] we still have this human element about
[56:34] us and if anybody hurts our feelings
[56:37] it's a little bit hard for us to deal
[56:39] with them
[56:40] and we kind of tend to want to shun that
[56:43] person that does us that way now from
[56:46] this point on y'all don't have to batch
[56:47] your eyes you don't have to even breathe
[56:49] if you don't want to you don't have to
[56:51] move around but I know your everyone as
[56:53] guilty as a hound dog in the hen house
[56:55] so whether you move or not you're
[56:57] already guilty by association
[56:59] association of what of being Immortal
[57:02] you're associated with the rest of us
[57:04] so can you imagine now brother Branham
[57:07] telling us this live for that man who
[57:10] hates you
[57:12] live for that person
[57:16] who would kill you
[57:19] if they could
[57:24] wow
[57:26] so they are actually out to get you
[57:31] they're out to get you
[57:36] and what do you do for them
[57:38] you pray God or forgive them
[57:41] you can't get them off your heart
[57:44] you say God please
[57:47] please that they need help Lord
[57:49] it's that evil spirit on them that's
[57:51] making them feel that way Lord I love
[57:54] them with all my heart
[57:56] please God don't let them die with that
[57:59] terrible Spirit on them
[58:02] please help them
[58:06] oh I know there's some people that pray
[58:08] for him Lord God In The Name of Jesus
[58:11] get even with them
[58:13] God I pray fire will fall down from
[58:16] heaven
[58:23] some of y'all ain't like James and John
[58:26] remember them in the New Testament they
[58:28] said Lord there's some people throw
[58:30] Jesus out of his head and they said Lord
[58:31] you want us to call fire out of heaven
[58:33] like Elijah did
[58:35] Jesus said you don't even know what
[58:38] spirit
[58:39] hereof
[58:40] yet they thought they were giving a
[58:42] scriptural example
[58:44] but it was in the Old Testament
[58:48] but not in the new now the person of
[58:51] eternal life has come
[58:54] to do what
[58:56] Stan here is this day on Calvary and
[58:59] give us his life so his life could come
[59:01] inside of us and it would actually
[59:04] Empower us to say father forgive them
[59:09] for they don't know what they do
[59:12] well
[59:13] how many said to do that before
[59:15] it's an awesome feeling is it not it is
[59:19] absolutely awesome whenever someone or
[59:22] more than someone has trespassed against
[59:25] you and you're trying to figure it out
[59:27] understanding you say Lord I just don't
[59:29] understand what did I do and yet from
[59:32] your heart you can say Lord please
[59:35] forgive them
[59:36] please don't hold it against them Lord
[59:38] please maybe I'm weird okay maybe I'm
[59:41] already weird and strange but I know of
[59:44] no one listen to me I know of no one in
[59:49] the Earth
[59:50] that I want to see go to hell
[59:54] no one
[59:56] and there's people that has treated me
[59:58] awful Christians and sinners alike
[1:00:02] but still if God would say to me tonight
[1:00:04] Donnie
[1:00:06] whatever you say
[1:00:08] will happen
[1:00:10] I put their destiny
[1:00:13] in your hands
[1:00:17] wow
[1:00:19] that's a solemn thing isn't it
[1:00:21] I wouldn't have to pray about it
[1:00:24] I wouldn't have to think about it
[1:00:27] I would just say Lord
[1:00:29] please forgive them
[1:00:31] Don't Hold Us in against him for my sake
[1:00:36] is anybody else in here weird besides me
[1:00:40] ah you see
[1:00:42] you see what struck your heart
[1:00:46] that man
[1:00:48] from Calvary
[1:00:50] that's not in US
[1:00:53] that's not in us we cannot
[1:00:55] psychologically psych ourself up
[1:00:59] to such a state
[1:01:02] that means that day on Calvary
[1:01:05] has had an effect on your life
[1:01:10] so you're not just doing part one you're
[1:01:12] not just saying part two
[1:01:15] but you are testifying back to the
[1:01:17] effect of what happened on the cross
[1:01:19] that day that that life that was in him
[1:01:22] has come in you but brother Donnie I'll
[1:01:26] forgive them when they come and ask me
[1:01:27] he didn't
[1:01:29] we have no record that not one Roman
[1:01:32] soldier not one priest
[1:01:35] not any of the rest of the people there
[1:01:37] said Lord Jesus please forgive me
[1:01:41] but he said father forgive them
[1:01:45] for they don't even know what they do
[1:01:48] you believe that prayer will stand at
[1:01:50] the day of judgment
[1:01:56] yes it will
[1:01:58] you mean he forgave them and they never
[1:02:01] even asked
[1:02:04] look at the thief
[1:02:06] that man never even prayed what we would
[1:02:08] call a sinner's prayer
[1:02:12] that man never said he was sorry one
[1:02:15] time
[1:02:17] he never even said the word repent
[1:02:21] he never said I am so sorry listen at
[1:02:26] his words
[1:02:27] remember me
[1:02:29] when you come into your kingdom
[1:02:32] not I'm sorry please forgive me pardon
[1:02:35] me redeem me all the vernacular that we
[1:02:38] use
[1:02:40] was he ignorant did he not know I don't
[1:02:43] know what the fullness of the story was
[1:02:46] but it goes to show me
[1:02:49] that whether or not you understand the
[1:02:51] right vernacular
[1:02:52] whether or not you understand the right
[1:02:54] words can you imagine your prophet
[1:02:58] he was so ignorant about God he didn't
[1:03:00] know how to pray and he went out and
[1:03:02] tacked a note
[1:03:04] on a tree
[1:03:06] because he'd seen God out in nature and
[1:03:08] he said sir
[1:03:11] please please hear me
[1:03:13] that didn't work so it knelt down on an
[1:03:16] old cold shed and he said held his hands
[1:03:18] together and said sir I don't know if
[1:03:21] you understand my language or not
[1:03:24] he's praying and he's praying
[1:03:26] can you imagine a man being so in
[1:03:29] America didn't even know how to pray
[1:03:31] didn't know how to repent
[1:03:34] and then this light come hovering on the
[1:03:36] wall and making a noise
[1:03:38] and he said maybe you can't speak my
[1:03:41] language
[1:03:42] and maybe kind of I can't understand
[1:03:44] yours
[1:03:45] but if that means you've forgiven me
[1:03:48] would you let that light appear again
[1:03:51] and the light came down and appeared on
[1:03:53] the wall
[1:03:55] his understanding was so primitive about
[1:03:58] God
[1:03:59] oh young people you're so blessed you've
[1:04:03] got youth Banquets done for you you've
[1:04:05] got use meetings you've got all kinds of
[1:04:07] things that are that are set
[1:04:09] specifically for your age
[1:04:11] but don't never get to a place that all
[1:04:14] those things that are done for you that
[1:04:16] you get away from the Simplicity of the
[1:04:18] Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:04:21] no matter all brother Donnie I can't
[1:04:23] lead people to Jesus I can't why can't
[1:04:25] you
[1:04:26] well I I don't know I don't understand
[1:04:27] how to explain brother Branham don't
[1:04:29] tell him about brother Branham first get
[1:04:31] them to the Lord Jesus and then we'll
[1:04:34] lead him to the message of the hour
[1:04:36] we want to be able to let our life the
[1:04:39] third phase of the power of Calvary be
[1:04:43] so effective and ongoing until the last
[1:04:46] member is brought in listen to this he
[1:04:49] says
[1:04:50] live for that person that would kill you
[1:04:53] if they could so now be honest tonight
[1:04:55] so if you know of one or more people in
[1:04:58] the Earth tonight that would actually
[1:05:00] kill you
[1:05:02] what would be your attitude toward them
[1:05:06] now brother Bob King told me a couple
[1:05:08] years ago I said brother Donnie I met
[1:05:10] some people out in Arizona's after I'd
[1:05:11] preached a certain series that raised a
[1:05:14] lot of ruckus around the message and
[1:05:16] brother King said I talked to some of
[1:05:18] them people and they said they would
[1:05:19] kill you
[1:05:20] if they had the opportunity to do so
[1:05:25] but you know what because I have eternal
[1:05:27] life you know what I did
[1:05:30] I prayed God would have mercy on their
[1:05:32] poor souls because these were message
[1:05:35] people
[1:05:36] born and raised in the message
[1:05:39] how pitiful how could anybody be born
[1:05:42] and raised in this message and want to
[1:05:44] kill somebody
[1:05:46] come on children it's the truth just
[1:05:49] because people around this message and
[1:05:51] sent in a message search don't mean
[1:05:52] they're born again
[1:05:55] so what do we want to do
[1:05:57] with Calvary
[1:05:59] listen to this
[1:06:01] that's what they've done to him they
[1:06:04] killed him and he died that he might
[1:06:07] save them that's eternal life
[1:06:10] when that's in your bosom
[1:06:15] you're facing heaven
[1:06:19] you're looking it in the face
[1:06:23] when that is in your soul
[1:06:27] do you understand you are looking heaven
[1:06:31] in the face
[1:06:33] Church can't do that for you Church
[1:06:36] annity can't do that for you
[1:06:38] attending youth camps can't do that for
[1:06:41] you
[1:06:42] that day on Calvary
[1:06:45] is the only thing that can do that for
[1:06:47] all of us
[1:06:49] Church isn't going to church to play
[1:06:51] music and sing songs
[1:06:53] but Church
[1:06:55] is a place of Correction
[1:06:57] where judgment begins at the house of
[1:06:59] God and we must reckon ourselves dead
[1:07:02] and alive to Christ that he made the way
[1:07:05] that we could sacrifice ourselves
[1:07:10] to his service and follow him
[1:07:13] we look and say oh yes that's fine
[1:07:15] that's fine but if the Son of God had to
[1:07:18] go to Calvary for crucifixion
[1:07:21] every son
[1:07:24] that comes to God
[1:07:26] must also go to Calvary
[1:07:30] you must also have a Calvary you must
[1:07:34] have a day
[1:07:36] of calvary
[1:07:38] I've got to have that day now this is
[1:07:40] preached in 1960 and brother Branham had
[1:07:42] been saved for years and years
[1:07:45] I've got to have that day of Calvary
[1:07:48] that's what the day of Calvary was
[1:07:50] that's what it meant that you might do
[1:07:54] and follow and act like Jesus
[1:07:59] so what does Calvary mean to you what
[1:08:02] that day did for you did it stuff you
[1:08:05] with some kind of theology did it make
[1:08:08] you a stuffed shirt or did it make you a
[1:08:11] Christian sold out and he says
[1:08:14] hallelujah
[1:08:18] does it mean mother Donnie that because
[1:08:21] I can't pray for my enemies that I don't
[1:08:23] have eternal life no
[1:08:27] no it doesn't mean that you don't have
[1:08:28] it for some they do possess it but it
[1:08:32] simply means they're not letting that
[1:08:34] eternal life flow out of them you know
[1:08:37] it's degrees degrees of the love of God
[1:08:41] degrees of the mercy of God degrees of
[1:08:44] understanding and degrees of eternal
[1:08:46] life and the closer we get to him and
[1:08:49] the more we submit to him the more he
[1:08:51] wants to live this out of us
[1:08:53] automatically you see whenever we start
[1:08:56] serving the lord we're learning we learn
[1:08:59] how to sing we learn how to clap our
[1:09:01] hands we learn how to pray we learn how
[1:09:03] to to do all these things and the more
[1:09:05] we learn then the more we learn to
[1:09:08] submit and allow eternal life itself to
[1:09:12] live out of us and you know what it'll
[1:09:13] become to you a second nature that it'll
[1:09:17] actually be easier for you to love those
[1:09:19] that hate you that it was before he ever
[1:09:22] got saved the way it was it was easy for
[1:09:25] you and I to not like folks that didn't
[1:09:27] like us it was just our nature it's just
[1:09:29] in our nature to do that and once
[1:09:32] eternal life comes to that fullness and
[1:09:34] it starts living out of us it will be
[1:09:36] even easier because it's another person
[1:09:39] inside of you this is why we need to
[1:09:42] have mercy and Grace for those who just
[1:09:44] get started out ain't that right
[1:09:47] well something's been started out for 50
[1:09:48] years and they still need Mercy I still
[1:09:50] do I don't know about you all I still
[1:09:52] need mercy and Grace but what are we
[1:09:55] going to do with that day on Calvary
[1:09:58] look what it done to him it embarrassed
[1:10:01] him
[1:10:02] you know as well as I you see the
[1:10:05] picture of him hanging on the cross and
[1:10:07] he had clothes on that is not a true
[1:10:09] description of calvary he hanged there
[1:10:12] naked
[1:10:13] they hang their beaten despise rejected
[1:10:17] Angels turned their back on him
[1:10:19] he was a curse in the eyes of God
[1:10:23] no one helped him even his disciples
[1:10:26] forsook him
[1:10:29] that's what Calvary was
[1:10:31] your Calvary may be so painful your mama
[1:10:34] your daddy your best friend
[1:10:37] but each of us will come to that place
[1:10:41] let me close remember says it this way
[1:10:43] when Jesus Christ the son of God humbled
[1:10:45] himself
[1:10:46] to a hat up body
[1:10:50] a spit on face
[1:10:52] shame and disgrace
[1:10:54] they stripped his clothes off and
[1:10:56] crucified him before the world
[1:10:58] how can you go to Calvary
[1:11:02] and come away with anything different
[1:11:05] than what he was a disgrace
[1:11:08] a shame
[1:11:10] but let's be honest young people the
[1:11:13] majority of Christendom and the day that
[1:11:15] we're living
[1:11:16] the way them preachers preach Calvary
[1:11:19] and the way they preach it to their
[1:11:21] people their people come away from what
[1:11:24] they think is Calvary not a shame not a
[1:11:27] reproach but they walk away from there
[1:11:30] with what they feel like is a license to
[1:11:33] sin more or less every day
[1:11:37] and have an excuse for living a loose
[1:11:40] cold laodicea in life well it proves to
[1:11:44] me they've not been to the real Calvary
[1:11:47] because if you and I if they ever get to
[1:11:50] the real Calvary we'll come away
[1:11:52] disgraced shamed embarrassed we will not
[1:11:56] want to take advantage of the blood we
[1:11:59] will not want to take advantage of the
[1:12:00] Cross well Jesus died so I could be
[1:12:03] saved and Jesus died so I could I could
[1:12:05] live this way and I don't have to live
[1:12:07] that Holy way I don't have to do this
[1:12:08] and that that's what his blood is for he
[1:12:11] knew I couldn't live right he knew I
[1:12:13] couldn't be that kind of a Christian so
[1:12:14] I can go ahead and do what I want to do
[1:12:16] and then he takes care of all of that
[1:12:18] that's not the calvary that we have in
[1:12:21] the Bible
[1:12:22] it brings you to a shame or reproach
[1:12:26] notices
[1:12:28] or you say they'll kick me out
[1:12:31] let them kick
[1:12:34] they'll kick me out let them kick
[1:12:38] have your day at Calvary
[1:12:41] when you listen to this tape it's
[1:12:44] amazing it's it's preached since
[1:12:45] September the 25th 1960. I heard it
[1:12:47] today and I rewound it again when
[1:12:49] brother Ben said this because it's just
[1:12:51] like this wasn't in his notes it was
[1:12:52] just so inspired to him and he says this
[1:12:56] have your day at Calvary
[1:12:59] God
[1:13:00] will have his way
[1:13:03] with you
[1:13:04] and then he says let me quote that again
[1:13:08] have your day at Calvary
[1:13:11] and God will have his death his way
[1:13:15] with you
[1:13:17] have your day at Calvary
[1:13:20] and God will have his way with you
[1:13:25] now watch him as he prays Lord God
[1:13:29] take us all the way up to Calvary just
[1:13:32] now now remember brother Branham has
[1:13:34] been saved for decades
[1:13:36] this is preaching the Bradham Tabernacle
[1:13:38] he's preaching to people that have been
[1:13:40] saved for decades
[1:13:42] let us get away from self
[1:13:46] Lord from the fear of man from the fear
[1:13:50] of what somebody else
[1:13:52] is going to say
[1:13:53] you see if that's still what controls us
[1:13:56] well I'm scared somebody to laugh at me
[1:13:58] oh I can't Worship the Lord like that I
[1:14:00] I can't do this or that or the other
[1:14:02] well again you need to go to Calvary to
[1:14:06] die to that but brother Donnie I'm done
[1:14:08] saved but fear is keeping you from being
[1:14:11] what God wants you to be
[1:14:15] notice this
[1:14:17] as he prays god
[1:14:19] let me be crucified today
[1:14:24] I said this today too
[1:14:27] when I heard this
[1:14:30] God let me be crucified today
[1:14:33] let me crucify today myself
[1:14:37] and my ideas
[1:14:39] that I might live with Christ
[1:14:42] and live
[1:14:44] for others
[1:14:47] what a joint
[1:14:50] great plan of God
[1:14:52] to live with Christ
[1:14:55] and for others
[1:14:58] so not just your best and closest friend
[1:15:03] but maybe reach out to that one
[1:15:06] you see what really causes clicks and
[1:15:08] clans in a church
[1:15:10] it's in a family it's in schools it's
[1:15:12] it's always been that way
[1:15:15] sometimes it's just easier to be friends
[1:15:18] to those that's more like us
[1:15:21] more likable now let's just face facts
[1:15:23] some folks are easier to be friends with
[1:15:27] and some folks are more likable than
[1:15:30] others
[1:15:31] now y'all ain't even batting a now are
[1:15:33] you but it's the truth but what if that
[1:15:37] person that say outside the clicks of
[1:15:40] some of our young people
[1:15:42] and they're wanting to be inside
[1:15:44] they're wanting to be included
[1:15:47] and you'll say oh they are really weird
[1:15:49] man I mean they're just really maybe
[1:15:51] they're backwards
[1:15:52] maybe they don't know what to say maybe
[1:15:55] they feel inferior they don't feel apart
[1:15:59] well why don't one of you or you or you
[1:16:01] or you move out of your comfortable
[1:16:04] click
[1:16:05] and live for others
[1:16:09] Hallelujah
[1:16:11] maybe that person that you'd look at and
[1:16:13] they got green hair and tattooed from
[1:16:16] the tiptoe of their finger up behind
[1:16:17] their ears and smell like marijuana and
[1:16:20] everything I said I'd never have nothing
[1:16:22] to do with them how do you know
[1:16:25] the deceit of God don't lay on that
[1:16:27] heart
[1:16:30] and if we would inconvenience ourselves
[1:16:32] just enough
[1:16:34] to say hey how you doing
[1:16:36] how you do it
[1:16:39] well what if they turned me down well
[1:16:41] they may I've been turned down plenty of
[1:16:43] time but I keep on asking anyhow
[1:16:46] why
[1:16:48] we're gonna say let me go ahead
[1:16:50] brother Bram closes out this sermon
[1:16:55] quoting what Jesus said
[1:16:58] these works that I do will you do an
[1:17:00] also greater
[1:17:02] and he said it's not just laying hands
[1:17:04] on the sick
[1:17:06] but he said the greater work is this
[1:17:10] imparting
[1:17:12] eternal life
[1:17:17] if I pray for you you live long enough
[1:17:19] you'll get sick again
[1:17:22] but if I can lead you to the Lord Jesus
[1:17:27] and you can brace eternal life
[1:17:30] you will never
[1:17:33] get away from that again
[1:17:36] not only me
[1:17:38] but you
[1:17:40] if you can Witness
[1:17:42] and you can say God

[1:32:34] Music Room in the music room choir
[1:32:36] practice right after the service today
[1:32:38] and um what a service I thank God for
[1:32:42] Church of how clean I feel after after a
[1:32:45] service like that and what Jesus did for
[1:32:47] me and what hit my heart too
[1:32:52] there are many times I have witnessed to
[1:32:54] people and I want so deeply and for them
[1:32:58] to see it
[1:33:00] and I know that they're close to me and
[1:33:02] they are dear to me their family or
[1:33:04] their friends
[1:33:06] and they just can't
[1:33:07] and they love me and yet they cannot see
[1:33:10] it what God God is the only Savior and
[1:33:12] it's up to him but remember there was
[1:33:15] someone brother Larry witnessed to me
[1:33:17] and I told brother Donnie this it was
[1:33:19] five years

[1:33:23] saw the Lord in the first second he
[1:33:24] mentioned the name Jesus it was five
[1:33:27] years so be patient it's on God's time
[1:33:30] and just let your light shine
[1:33:32] because and it it hurts so much you love
[1:33:34] the Lord so much you want others to see
[1:33:37] what you see and maybe they will but to
[1:33:39] whatever capacity God has ordained them
[1:33:41] to receive but you love the Lord so much
[1:33:44] that you want to share it
[1:33:46] and it and it hurts so much
[1:33:49] but it's on love because he hurt for us
[1:33:52] right
