sang often many years ago there's lines in it that says all my days are filled with Sunshine not a cloud or darkened my mind on my way up here today and I got a chance to hear that awesome sermon Sunday needless to say I've been brother a for a long time and I'm sure there's others here but I look over the last few years and seven years ago the Lord brought me this way and the leadership my precious brother Reagan has helped me so much God blessed me to cross the path of brother Ron and I learned more about predestination one the experience that many of you heard about but today on the way here listening to that as of message and those glooms I realized why I can sing this song The Devil jumped on my shoulders you can't sing this song all your days aren't filled with Sunshine not a cloud darkens your mind I see you when you're moaning and you're groaning and all the things you've been through and the scars and this as I heard brother Daryl say after that sermon that Cloud's beyond that Sun's Beyond those clouds and I just want to give the Lord the glory for how much he's reached down and touched me through the ministry over the recent weeks [Music] there was a time I thought that I could conquer anything I knew it all had nothing left to try oh and blind it to disaster my world kept spinning faster till I felt the very soul of me would die but desperation brought me back to The Old Rugged Cross when my world had turned so black I couldn't see oh and like a brighten child lost in the night I search for life and in my desperation Lord you shined on me oh I'm a man who can walk again and be croud of who I am for the sins I once held tight I've now let go and all my days are filled with Sunshine not a cloud never darkened my mind I tell you now it wasn't always so oh but desperation brought me back to Through The Old Rugged Cross when my world had turned so black that I could not see oh and like a frightened child lost in the night oh I search for light and in my desperation oh Lord you shined on me oh desperation brought me back to The Old Rugged Cross when my world had turned so black I could not see oh like a frightened child lost in the

have her gall stones removed and might have to have her gallbladder out turned in by Sister Marcy Robert we'll pray for that uh amen man man I don't know about y'all I'm excited I don't know why this there a feeling of excitement just came over my body let's sing this song Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he goes by amen Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he goes by you'll find he's not too busy to hear your heart's cry he passing by this moment your needs he will supply Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he goes by just Reach Out And Touch the Lord as [Applause] [Music] he Hearts cry I he believes

your heart's cry he pass sing by this moment your needs he will supply if you reach out and touch the Lord [Music] as he goes [Music] by Praise the Lord I'm glad we believe it's just that simple tonight no matter what you have need of what you brought to church with you your burdens might be so heavy and it feels like it's that rain on that roof that it's waiting you down and you think you cannot put one foot in front of the other but just remember the Lord Jesus is mindful of everything we have need of I'd answered an email today from a a foreign country of someone who wanted to had ask a question and this person said that this question was hindering them from serving God that they could not serve God but because they did not understand the answer to this question and the question was why is it that God allows sickness and trouble and difficulty to come against people and sometimes they feel like they just can't take it anymore and that question was hindering them from serving God of course I could have sent them all kinds of scriptures and quotes but one of the ones that came to my heart was from the Church age book where the Prophet tells us that why does he stand by why does he stand by and watch his children suffer it's for our good because he wants to teach us things he wants to help us you know in the world that we're living many people have that question I'm sure that you know it already but some of the Jews after the Holocaust they turned to be total infidels because they said there could be be no such a thing as God that would allow his chosen people to suffer but to me that's one of the things that makes me love him CU I realize he loves us so much and he wants such a character out of our lives that he will hurt himself to put us through what we need to go through do you actually think he lets you go through the things you're going through and he sits there in heaven and he's so separate from what's killing you that he just looks down and laughs and say wow this is great this is absolutely awesome that's not my father he was touched by the feelings of our infirmities when he was here I wonder what all that we go through and how is our high priest it still affects him I couldn't serve a god any other way could you I couldn't serve the devil myself cuz he just outright mean to his people he don't love his children he torments them puts them through hell bankrupts them lies to them robs them steals from them and they going to take them to hell when it's all said and done and they love him some of them love him just as much as you love God and what in the world is he doing for them absolutely nothing and the Lord Jesus not only promises us a world that is to come but he says no matter what you go through in life I promise I'll be with you I promise I'll be with you am I'm glad I know him that way tonight isin it a privilege to be gather together here in the house of God tonight well praise the Lord we're going to preach again tonight on the latter rain all right I figured some of y'all would have a hard time smiling whenever I was going to read them a text so I thought I'd go and tell you yes it's pouring outside and it's been pouring and going to pour for the next 24 hours or so and I hope that it does the same way on the inside and then our walks with God and our life with God because as our state has went through a dry spell the whole Southeast basically a lot of crops are burn up uh down at the nursery down in Hampton where we got some of our plants from the church they told me down there that this summer they'd had a really difficult time trying to keep the plants healthy because it's stressed the plants the trees the bushes the flowers and I thought wow if it can stress a tree what about a servant of God or a son of God or a daughter of God whenever we go through things they talking about what they had to do to them and telling me what that they had to do you know to try to their best to keep them healthy and if they do that just with a nursery well I guess that's what church is really a nursery I guess we could take that two ways right amen a nurse where where we got plants and then a nurse where we got babies well Hallelujah praise the Lord I guess you'll just have to identify which one you are friend I ain't going to tell you but I pray God would just pour out his blessings on us I'm telling you what that service Sunday I have heard from all over this great big wide world wow our God is mindful how many has a need a request tonight on your heart talked to brother Frank Williams today and he was just expressing him and sister Jackie's desire to be in church and brother Frank's dealing with several things in his body and uh he's real prone to fall and things like that and he just wanted us to be remembered him we know we have several several needs among us tonight s needs in our church family let's just take it to the Lord before we read his word Lord Jesus we want to thank you tonight for the natural rain that we're getting on the outside we certainly needed it it's been dry and really hot and we can see the stress that it's caused on plants and trees and so on I look around the nature and I can see a parallel of what dry spells do to the church what dry spells do to a family to individuals and their walk with you it can become so hot and dry and seem like that been a while since we've had a good drenching rain but oh Lord how we rejoice when you send down the presence from the Holy Ghost and then we look around and it will be absolutely amazing after these rains that we get and what it will do to the grass and the trees and oh it's just remarkable I've been out here watering them like crazy and the city waterers kept them alive but there're just something about that water falling down out of Heaven it just does something to us we can come to church and sometimes we feel like we got our city water on we got to make oursel clap our hands we got to make oursel raise our hands and worship God and that might just sustain us a little bit until the Heavenly rain comes down Lord I just pray that you'd speak to us tonight from your word father we have so many needs among us but we're not discouraged by these needs as a matter of fact we're looking at these needs as opportunities of the supernatural amen opportunities by which you can manifest yourself Lord among us and we see you doing great things and we're looking for even greater would you help us tonight father be mindful of us help me to get out of the way shut my mouth to anything that would displease you Lord anoint me dear God and anoint the people that we can be able to receive from you tonight we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen praise the Lord God bless you so happy to be together tonight we was able to um have the youth service the other night and our brother and sister white was able to come and share their testimony of some of the things that the Lord had done for them and has done my heart good bunch of the young people there and um you young people that were there did you really enjoy that it was some really good things that they shared with us and we so so appreciated as I was there thinking about it what it's going to be that day when we all gather together we go to sharing different testimonies things that God's done for us where he's brought us through and where he's brought us from won't that be a time let turn tonight if you would to Jeremiah chap 5 verse 24 we'll be reading the scriptures again about the former and the latter rain I truly believe that we're living in the season when God is wanting to bring a greater fulfillment to his word Jeremiah 5: 24 neither say they in their heart let us now fear the lord Our God that giveth reain both the former and the latter in his season he reserve us unto us the appointed weeks of the Harvest Hosea 6:3 then shall we know if notice now then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord now you see a great portion of the people who come to the Lord Jesus as their savior they never go on to know him greater than just that he's a Son of God that died for their sins went to the Cross to set them free from sin and that's as far as they go but I don't want to stop there I want the rest of this verse then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us notice not gifts not signs not wonders Miracles healings all that's part of it but a personal presence of the Lord himself for he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain unto the earth now we need healing we know that we need Miracles we need Supernatural there's several people in our church that need a miracle from God and we're believing that but we also not only want the gifts we want the giver yeah and I'll tell you what if I get the giver in the right perception and the right ability I've got access to every gift of the spirit of God and the church said that's right and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and the former Reign unto the Earth Joel chap 2 verse 23 be glad them ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given listen he has given unto you the former Reign moderately so the former Reign came in a moderate Temperance now notice how it's going to come he's given it to you in a measure what was the measure it was a moderate measure for he has given unto you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain rain and the latter rain in the first months may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word and the church said amen amen God bless you as we've been looking at it that truly as the people of God we are a prophetic class of people we are a people that believes that God utters things sometimes that are quite plain and simple in his word other times he gives things out in a symbolic form other times he gives it out in the form of a prophecy and it may lay in his written word for thousands of years until the hour arrives for that prophecy to come to pass sometimes that prophecy will be veiled in symbols and then if it is it will take a profit to take that symbol and to be able to take the Twist and the turns out of it to make it simple where we can understand it now sometimes God will prophesy things in such a way that it doesn't take a prophet to be able to interpret it but other times he gives it in a way you take Isaiah 7:14 unto us a child is born a son is given a virgin shall conceive bring forth the son that really didn't need an interpretation because of the way that God sent it yet there were many other prophecies giving about the Advent of the coming of the Lord Jesus that took a prophetic understanding and that's why God sent a prophet to forerun his first coming that he could prepare the hearts of the people for the coming of the Lord and that's why we believe that the Advent of a prophet in the last days is absolutely essential in order to prepare a people to be able to meet the Lord Jesus in the body change if it was not absolutely essential at his first Advent why did he ever sent John the Baptist because he wind up getting getting his head cut off because of it so it must have been of Great Value to the economy of God to send a prophet like that so what was he doing he had a preparation message in order to prepare a people that they would be able to accept what was coming after John the same way with the Elijah of our day that God would have never sent him had it not been of a great essential necess necessity now naturally Satan is going to do what he can to block that if he cannot block it from coming that after it comes he will try to devalue that message and what's the sad thing about it is he will do that devaluing many times from those who were formerly identified with it or even those who sit among it and said well yeah yeah we we can see that you know I I I'll take the message when it's thus sayth the Lords but the rest of it I ain't got no use for it I I don't understand that type of mentality so who do the preachers who would say such a thing think that they are that they would under undervalue a prophet of God that according to the symbolism that God gave John on the aisle of patmas that our Prophet messenger was in the right hand of Jesus let me just update you on that John didn't see me in there John didn't see brother Tim PR in there he did not see brother Ron Spencer in the right hand of Jesus he didn't see none of the brothers ministering Brothers here but he saw our church age messenger now to me that gives him more value than it does me and whether you like it or not it gives him more value than it does you so God give him then a special hidden Mana by which he would have to feed on that hidden Mana first and then once he fed on the hidden Mana he would bring that message to us and remember it'll only be a hundreds of a percent that will ever even hear what he's got to say and then there'll be an even smaller percentage of that that do hear that will stay with what he has to say because all of those who go out don't always remember how important it is to say only what the messenger has spoken they will begin to add here and take away there and no and the word is no longer pure and the Revival dies is that right now friends we're living in that day when it is happening right before our eyes it's amazing some of the ministers in the message that have gone through certain doctrines that the prophet taught well you know what we don't need that one no more and that was just a a southern thing and and and that was during the time of the 50s and the 60s that brother brandham was cheering we really don't need that and then other said well you know the gift thing that was only for the brandham Tabernacle you might need to study a little bit farther and you'll find out that it wasn't just for the brandom Tabernacle and others said well we don't need that we don't need that so you know who are we supposed to believe we supposed to believe the one that God sent or the men that are here to supposedly update what God had that Prophet to say and tell us well we don't need this no more we don't need that no more but what if they take something away from us and it just so happens we do need it for the Rapture are you really are we really going to let men do that to us well I can answer for myself tonight no I am not anybody with me no I don't care how close a friend they are to me I don't care how many years I've known them and what camaraderie that re that we have when it comes to that word I'll stand on it by myself if I have to come on somebody I don't believe I'll have to cuz God's got a people around the world but my point is this that we want to make sure what we're feeding on what we're listening to what we're taking in that men aren't spicing and slicing out and taking this and we don't need that why in the world do we need that in this end time we do not but but Satan has always done that to the people of God remember he started in the Garden of Eden was Eve well yeah God has said that but God does know why you why in the day you eat thereof you shall be as Gods you will not surely die all he had to do is make her question that one thing and we realize we are here today because of what she did in the Garden of Eden is that right now Satan knows then by sewing the original seed word with just a little bit of Doubt then it produced a crop which was what king which was a mongrel or a hybrid serpent seed so it was the mixing of Eve with the serpent now remember Cain in one sense of the word had two fathers he had a father of his body which was The Serpent and he had another Father which was the father of his nature and that was the devil well don't look at me too Qui cuz you're the same way when before you're born again you had a natural daddy which SED you in your mother's womb and then your daddy also might have handed you a a human patronage but you had another nature the one who was to who was the closest kin to you and every one of us come to this Earth with the nature of the devil in US amen well well praise the Lord that's exactly right oh my and Satan's been sewing the hybridized seed since the very beginning so in every age it's like that God swed the seed word and then God would take the messenger from the earth and men after that messenger would leave would start vying for position and they wanted to move in to be the big guy this that and the other and then one would pull this way one would pull that way one would pull that way and would make their own little branches of what Luther said or of what Wesley said or of what Pentecost said and the message is exactly the same way many of the men that you hear brother randam talk about on tape hardly any of them hardly any of them that he mentions on tape even many of them that he ordained to preach when he come right down to the very end of their walk with God stayed true to that word thank God there were some but many of them only use the message as a platform to introduce their C now part of the seeds that we are reaping right now and in 2024 were seeds that have been previously sown back in the 70s ' 80s 90s early 2000s now they are coming up because the Harvest rain is Begin to Fall in the end time so you know it started out the tape thing where we have it now to where they don't really even believe in going to church anymore and and they're saying that their homes are actually their churches so that's their home Church woo a't that nice Antichrist you can call it nice if you want to it's Antichrist it's against Christ teaching well praise the Lord but now that started out years ago very gently very easy you know from some of the folks around the Tabernacle and just well we'll play a tape for this meeting and a tape for that one and little by little start easing out the god call Ministry now what's it doing so now in order to take communion then you have a driveby spot so you got to drive by spot to where that you pick up your communion wi and then they want to tell you what time to have it oh oh okay now somebody I'm open for correction here tonight so stand up put your finger on the Bible page or the message page or the prophet said it and I'll retract my former statements but until you do I'm going to keep on with it so where did that come from seeds that were started years ago now people would have never thought it would have ever gotten to the spot that it is now to word that the brandom Tabernacle sits there empty musty and molded and the only thing you can do in the brandom Tabernacle even if you go in in there to this day is have silent prayer all you got to do is go to the website and look at it just ready this evening silent prayer silent prayer so that's what we're doing so where did this seed come from years and years ago so you see as we now here we are believers in this day so if it goes on another year 5 years 10 years whatever more we also are sewing seeds too every Ministry especially those that have a worldwide effect they are globally sewing seeds every young man every older man every all all the brothers that have an effect upon the people of God they are sewing seeds now those seeds whether it's at a youth camp whether it's at a family camp or a convention and then Brothers will come in and they'll seow their seed well for some it's going going to be seed of intellectualism for some it will be more of the emotional side and for some it will be those that desire to strike a balance between the intellectual part and the emotional part because they know they need a certain amount of their faith to believe God it'd be nice if God would believe for me every day but he don't there's times that God strikes our heart with his face but that's not the way it's going to happen every day how many knows that's right so I need an element of my faith that at times that's what I will have to believe with but I also need emotion I need to be able to worship I need to praise I myself need to assemble myself together with the rest of the children of God in our assembly well praise the Lord there's something to me about coming to church now you know I I realize that people of God Is So spiritual that you can stay home and you don't really need to go to church and you see the problem is they don't believe the very Prophet that they say they do they want to make him infallible but I call them Liars over the internet and I'll call them Liars to their face because God's Prophet said if God is in your heart you can't wait for them doors to open to get to the house of God now why don't you press play on that because you're a deceiver and a hypocrite that's why on well Glory the Bible says in the book of Hebrews forsaking not the assembling of ourselves together not you staying at home at your house and pushing play and sitting there to eating a bowl of ice cream and a piece of chocolate cake and some Southern sweet tea that is blasphemy and say you're replacing God's people coming together in the house of God or if you want some quotes email me I'll blow you away what what the prophet said some of them are actually fearful I'd like to take one night here and just go through it and show you what God's Prophet said about going to church it will show you how much unbelievers we have around this message well glory to God there's something about us gathering together you with your lick of fire and you and you and you and we all get together come on somebody there's something about special meetings and we get more of the saints of God gathered together and all and they're just it's an awesome thing isn't it but you realize Satan started sewing some of these seeds now years ago and they were sewn so slightly and so subtle and they never even thought my years ago whenever I was preaching against some of this stuff and some of my closest friends said I do wish brother Donnie would shut his mouth on some of this stuff he's preaching we don't need that that's not even needful for us it's not even needful it don't bother us oh my of course now they realize it does bother us now they do realize the Holy Ghost had that answer years and years ago before it ever arrived to where it is now you see the Holy Ghost knew it was coming coming to this well amen the Holy Ghost knew it was coming to the end time to where the seeds are going to be manifest and he always has men of God that he can Inspire with inspiration and sometimes they'll preach things years before it ever even happens and we realize that's the way it's always been so here we are then the seed time and the Harvest is here now remember I your brother R and preached that our sermon called the spoken Lord's Original Seed he goes to tiffon Georgia and he preaches in time seed sign in time seed sign they had two services at Jeffersonville he drives Down to Georgia and he preaches there on on Monday night so he kind of brings it all together so if you're listening to end time seed sign go ahead and listen to the the spoken words original seat and he'll follow up with that and brings the highlights in there and he's showing us that in every age you have exactly the same thing that God will send a messenger and that Messenger will seow the seed and Satan then will come in and had a little bit of this and a little bit of that now what he wants to do is hybridize that seed and get it in the ground as soon as possible now get it in the ground it don't do no good to keep it just in the minds and in the hearts of some of these so-called message preachers but he wants to get it into the ground where's the ground your hearts your hearts right there that's why that preachers have to have a following you ever see a preacher with a church full of cows what about goats well maybe I mean I'm talking about the four Le ones or are a church full of jack rabbits say a church full of squirrels what does most preachers want they don't want jack rabbits they don't want squirrels they want people they want people so when they get to we the seed within themselves you understand that a preacher a perverted preacher starts conceiving whatever this is that he's ordained I hope you understand men have are ordained of God they are ordained of God to come in this message that will never be born again ordained of old the Bible says orain of old to this condemnation so there's men that have come in they've said under the quietness of the spirit and they will get a little bit of influence here and a little bit of influence there and then when they arrive to the place that they feel the motivation to make their move then they will start you know this clicker Clan whatever it is and they they they themselves first started conceiving this questionable form of the message of the hour I don't know about that now I don't know about that I'll say with brother brandom as long as he's in the word are you kidding me you're going to say that about a word prophet a Vindicated Prophet as if though we would know more about it than a Vindicated Prophet would yeah it's hard to believe but there's been all kinds of them and there'll be more so the man conceives this within himself then it starts coming up from within his being and it start that's all he can see that oh my it's all he can see what's the seven Thunders the parara or whatever Doctrine it is you know where brother R's wrong here and I take this and I take that and I take this and I take that then he starts putting his ideology together it conceives within his own soul then it's like he becomes pregnated with what he feels like is the word and now the baby's growing within him the seed word he thinks is oh my oh W I can no longer stay around these brothers you know cuz they're I mean you know they're just making too much out of brother Brandon what in the world will they stand up and read quotes about brother brandom well I guess that's because that's the way they're done in the Old Testament whenever Daniel read quotes from Jeremiah and then titim must have read quotes from Paul and and the church agents that that exactly the same thing is that right honestly don't understand the preachers that don't read quotes myself well praise the Lord but you see they get heavy with this child then they will start pulling off and the first thing they want to do is start sewing the seed now I couldn't say it while I was there under brother Tim I couldn't say it while I was Hing to brother Ron I couldn't say it when I was with this brother that brother oh I've been holding this in my heart all this time oh my I want to share it with you I want to share it with you and I want to share it with you and then there it starts now we got another crop now they're still identified generally as message followers but before long you notice them that they believe that he's already come which is the Peruan Doctrine so they believe he's already come so then they no longer take communion and if he's already come then there's no need to pray for Revival because the book's already Clos and if he already come then we don't really have to live Holiness anymore so it don't matter what you look like it don't matter what you dress like because he's already here and we've arrived well you know if they go that way then there they go they start pulling off pulling off pulling off pulling off then they get their own field and they get their own farm and they get their own Farmers preachers and then they start sewing the same seat out from under the headship boy I wish somebody hear me tonight under the headship of this one man and all these things always point back to one man I feel sorry for these one men they're going to stand before God at the day of judgment and give an account for every soul that they have led astray they will stand before God I'm talking about if they don't repent they will stand before God and give an account for sewing Discord in the body now watch so it started happening years ago now it went to the intellectual side around the message for years and years boy if you believed in shouting and stuff worshiping God and just hardly having any emotion at all he was considered to be a Pentecostal I've been considered that for years and years uh you know but I I really never did take it really as a slam in my face I was always proud to be identified with Pentecost not so much as ze's treat but Acts chapter 2 but you realize then that some will say well now wait a minute wait a minut we we've got to have a move of God here because our young people are backsliding our young people can't be kept young people cannot be kept with just an intellectual conception they need to know a true and a living God let me tell you something it ain't just young people that know that need to know that it's us old people too so what did Sayan do he started hybridizing then in the form of farmer preachers farmer preachers started sewing the seeds with all types of different thing so we had this click that click that click that click that click we got them all over the world and many of them now thank God have collapsed because many of them initial leaders that started founding all of these moves many years ago many of them have gone on now of course the clicks are divided and and we know that the sth under thing and this and that there's still a few of them that are around and one of their main guys right now says he's the Holy Ghost so that like lets you kind of know where they are I don't know how in the world an idiot could stand in the ppit and claim to be such a thing brother Donnie that's crude speaking I figure you understand it don't you you me to use some great big four barrel word about that long that you don't understand and I'm saying the same thing idiot ain't got enough sense to get in out of the rain well they're getting in out of the ladder rain all right because they're so in their heart and their soul full of Discord and Seed of the serpent oh thank you Jesus thank you Jesus but on down through this time there were true Servants of God and they just kept Desiring to preach the word preach the word now remember years ago we must give them credit for this time frame that in the late 60s after the prophet left 70s 80s uh there was there was many sincere brothers that were preaching the message and the message was not available on computer there was no software to be able to cross reference what the prophet had said to pull up the quotes concerning a certain subject and they might get a few quotes and they might make a little pet idea out of it but they were not doing it trying to deceive anybody or so Discord they just don't not have availability of the message but a preacher has no excuse now if he lives where he can afford a computer if he can afford to get one I'll tell you what it is is now they know them other quotes are there but it would be able to blow their narrative out of the water so they're not going to read them well come on now now it makes it more damnable for the preachers when they're studying on whatever it is and they see this quote that one that one and that one which would absolutely go contrary to what they're trying to project so what do they do just simply leave them out now you're getting into willful sinning because what Satan wants to do is every man you think Satan don't want me to do that you think Satan don't want brother Dar to do that all these different men that have an influence of speaking around the world because no matter what you preach and who you are if God calls you God gives you favor with people you can't get that on your own and once God gives you that favor that's why people say well how in the world could people follow men when they get off when they get so far off the word well they look at him and they love him and they trust him you shouldn't follow a man because you love him you shouldn't follow a man because you trust him you should follow him because he stays true to the word and if he ever leaves the word you leave him is that what the prophet Tau well praise the Lord now what God did was whenever he first started this church and Jesus was the first one to mention this word church and he said Upon This Rock I will build my church and never been uttered before it never been spoken so it was new imagine the first time the devil heard he thought what in the world is church now we know the devil knows all the languages of course and he knew the Greek word of what church meant Ecclesia that it was a people called out from their homes called out from their homes to meet and a certain place and Satan thought wow this is absolutely brilliant this is genius but he still didn't know what it was yet cuz Jesus hadn't form one and they were just following Jesus around from capernium to Galilee here and there and there so Jesus actually never got to preach a sermon in a church well let me reate that he didn't until after the Holy Ghost come on the day Pentecost because they didn't stay in one place and Jesus didn't have a church in capernium he didn't have one in the upper coast of Galilee he didn't have one in any of the places there but they were just following around and wherever Jesus would go the people would come where he is same thing today when Jesus shows up people somehow find out where Jesus is amen they find out where he's Healing The Sick they find out where the truth is they find out where he's delivering people and you know what they do they show up where he is but can you imagine now whenever they first start and they formulate then a church so they started gathering together and they go to doing it and it wasn't no time at all in Acts 1 ver8 that Paul or Galatians rather that Paul begin to tell them oh what what happened what happened to you at one time you would have pulled your eyes out and given them to me have I become your enemy because I've told you the truth and the judaizers from Jerusalem what did they do they come down and they was going to try to convert the Gentiles and so on they said you cannot be saved if you're not circumcised what was they doing taking the message of the Cross trying to cross hybridize it with circumcision now Satan knew don't deny the cross don't deny water baptism that's okay that's okay and people think the devil is just a total denial of everything no the biggest lie that was ever told had over 90% truth to it so Satan did didn't mind them preaching the cross he didn't mind them preaching water baptism but just hybridized it with circumcision now accept the blood of the Lord Jesus that's okay I'm all right with that accept water baptism I'm okay with that but just believe that you've got to do this and you've got to do that and you've got to do that or you're not saved and when you believe that you're taking away from the power of the Cross so what was he doing hybrid iing I know that them judaizers didn't say initially now you know what that Paul's a false prophet I'll tell you what that man talking to a pillar of fire and a light while whoever heard of such a thing and they may have started out real gentle now look Brethren we're not trying to do away with the cross we're not trying to do away with water baptism oh thank God for dealing with you all we're grateful but you just need to pick up Paul is leaving out circumcision he's leaving out worship on the Sabbath day he's leaving out the levitical order he's leaving out the Feast of the trumpets A Feast of Tabernacle he's leaving out all this stuff and brethren we are just trying to go back to the Bible uhuh it never ceases to amaze me how some of these message preachers when they run across a dark that the prophet taught and they always go this way well I can't find well the Bible says it that way oh my and yet every one of them same preachers will say well each church is Sovereign I'd like for you to show me the scripture where it says that so you know what they do hybridize so they use that each church is sovereign so if we want to do this and that and the other in our church we can you know we don't have to exactly comply to the teaching of the message cuz our church is sov and where did you get that statement out yes Acts Corinthians Philippians Ephesians fimon John Jude Hebrews James so what do they do hybiz so they mix quotes scriptures theology then they get books from Amazon and a few little things from the Houston guy I hope that man can get straight I do because if he don't when he stands before God the tens of thousands of souls that will be damned to hell because of his teaching and he will stand before almighty God with the blood of countless of souls on his hands I don't know about you I don't want to see nobody lost nobody what it do in the days of Luther same thing days of Wesley same thing whenever brother Seymour out in a Zeus Street in California a black man blind in one eye and whenever he began to receive the understanding about the gifts of the Spirit and that there was to be a restoration and the gifts were supposed to come back in the body again well it started out initially seemingly good and the spirit of God started falling in Ireland it started falling in whales it started falling all over the world it was a supernatural move of God it was not a manmade move and the spirit of God started moving then did what happened Satan got some farmer preachers together and they said hey brothers you know what we need you do we need to make the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues and the prophet said when they done it they organized right then now they never mention organization look at them early fathers I've read some of their statements it was never brother Joe their desire to make an organization but they felt like who was it the same serpent that talked to Eve in the Garden of Eden but before long in another generation if you didn't speak in tongues you didn't have the Holy Ghost now I know many of our message people have ever been through that and you've never seen it but unless you have seen it you don't realize what an absolute error that is that if they beat you on the back they are you done bite your tongue that's all you got and many of them said they have the Holy Ghost and they didn't have no Holy Ghost come on and yet they go right back out and backside and get away from the Lord and Satan knew all alone if I can hariz it'll make Pentecost to where they don't speak in tongues they ain't got it yeah do you honestly think he's going to let the greatest truth that's ever been on the earth a Comm that's culminated in the end time without getting right inside of that truth and splitting it every way from this Sunday and be able to walk Before the Throne of God and say hey God like to call your attention down to the message or he might say it critically like this the message look at them God they're divided they're split they fuss they fight they argue how many brid's revivals if we had in the message you know what we do when we do that making another spiritual organization that okay this is a r of Revival so we all get to the place and where it's a seven Thunder and if you ain't got seven Thunder blood on your alter there is no such a thing that's right it was the blood of Jesus come on somebody and people stand in the mirror and try to pronounce the word perusia watch their lips and that's the evidence of being bride well the evidence of being bride now is jumping running shouting hollering the evidence of being bride is you say Amen to every word and it don't just come from your mouth it comes from your life and let me just say this I preached about the fourth light a few weeks ago the fourth light is not a repeating or a repetition of the third the third light was the restoration of gifts the fourth light is not the third light it is the culmination of all four Satan by fourth death Messengers cut down the tree and it seemed like he absolutely wiped it out but God said I will restore sayeth the Lord and God started it back in the days of Luther and He restored it and yet look at all the fanaticism that followed Luther's Revival the prophet said it was no great thing that Luther could withstand the Catholic church and get by with it but he could hold his head above the fanaticism that followed his Revival same with Wesley same with Pentecost let me go ahead and say it same with the message of the hour can we hold our head above the fanaticism that follows this revival I say yes we can yes we do yes we will we will not let fanaticism dictate who we [Applause] are well brother Don if there's Wildfire I'd not know I'd rather not have any that's exact opposite of what prophet said he said he'd rather have a little bit of wildfire no fire at all if we get a little bit of wildfire don't worry about it we know how to tame Wildfire ain't none of you was any wilder than I was I got tamed down pretty good I reckon some of you think Lord have mercy I ain't never seen such wild stuff you ought to seen me back in Pentecost I would have scared you te totally out of your mind and God got a hold to me and tame me down I'd rather have people a little bit extreme emotional than some of you dry High Church of Christ that don't ever even move you don't even nod your head you don't even worship God at all come on somebody I wish somebody around here would want to serve God and worship God in spite of the fanaticism in spite of the other side let's find the middle of the road and let's go home [Applause] church now I'm going to be honest with you I ate some of Carol's cooking today and she might have slipped some that gunpowder in on me again I've got several emails and texts from people saying please don't stop the gunpowder listen this and the spoken words you re see if you want a cucumber y'all ready now this is some deep stuff man you're talking about theological wow yeah if you if you want a cucumber start with a cucumber if you want a church start with the word of God so what do preachers want then when they start with a portion of the word plus their idea plus this book from Amazon Plus this book from the smiley preacher and this book from this guy and that guy and that guy and they lay it all out and they go to putting it all together what do they want they don't want a Church of the Living in God they want a church of their own making so their name can always be identified with it I started this I started this this is what I done this is what I started I don't want to own that thing myself now watch this if you want a church start with the word of God if you want a life of God start with the word of God accept the word of God in his fullness every measure of it that then that's if that's the fullness of God oh my goodness if that is the fullness of God in you then the rain that's falling will produce exactly what's in your garden so if the rain falls and you've got anger resentment right bitterness and when the rain falls you know what you're going to do you're going to have more anger than you've ever had your resentfulness is going to explode and you're going to look at yourself and think what in the world is a matter with me because you wouldn't hear the preaching of God's word to get that out of your heart you kept protecting it ain't nobody taking my bitterness I've worked a long time to get this ain't nobody taking my resentment ain't nobody getting my attitude glory to God well glory to God go ahead and keep it that's what you want but I'm telling you your end is not going to be good notice and if it's the fullness of God in you then the rain that's falling will produce exactly what's in your garden then now where's your latter rain coming up at you see where that's going after a while don't you the life that he produced that same watering Spirit of the Holy Ghost will bring forth the same kind of life now listen doing the same thing that he did if it's the same seed son of God's seed will bring forth a son of God's [Music] seed well we got seven Thunder children we've got peria children we've got no preacher children take children return Ministry children and they call theel by these names and proud of it tape boy tape girl well you know why that was the seeds that was swn in them oh I play tapes too I listen to them too but I am not identified by a man-made name I ain't Church of God I ain't Church of Christ Christ long ways from being that I ain't Episcopalian I ain't Presbyterian come on somebody I ain't return Ministry I ain't seven Thunder I ain't peruse you come on R have church tonight I'm not my identity is more than a tape boy I'm an ordained Holy Ghost fil Son of God Son of God seed will bring for Son of God seed if the Lord God wanted tap boy seed he should have made the Lord Jesus the original take boy but he made the Lord Jesus his spoken word he don't want tape boys and tape girls he wants Holy Ghost fill God ordained children of God that believe his word and tear hell all to [Applause] pieces now shame on you women with bobbed hair shame on you preachers denying that truth say it's all right hair has nothing to do with it but God said it did amen that's why I believe the word it's a seed and if the rain falls upon the seed it'll bring force of its kind now I'm telling you I've solded hundreds of pounds of grass seed over in this field wow and on this B B and this one get ready cuz after this rain and these warm temps it may look like a tropical jungle around here and you say where did it all come from months and months ago and what happened to the Sea it lay there dormant I didn't have enough garden hose to run P to the other field across the Yonder I imagine the Water Company's trying to figure out what in the world are they grunning so much water over there they baptizing people like crazy I'm trying to keep the plants alive that's what I'm trying to do to you tonight by the grace of God I'm trying to do everything I can pray oh my preach do everything I can to keep you ready keep you ready keep you ready what you doing brother Donnie I'm waiting for the LGH rain glory to God I'm waiting for the body chain and if I've got a pump a little water over here and pump a little water over I'm going to keep on PING I don't want y'all dying on me now if I have to I'll use it in Bottle form if I need to I'll take two garden hoses and I'll just dous you I don't want you dying amen cuz it's dying trying time one day I'm going to stand before this Prophet Malachi 4 that's I want to stand before God yes but under this church age messenger every preacher who says they believe this message will have to stand up under the opes of this Prophet imagine what it's going to be for those men that added to what he said took away what he said yes butchered what he said LED people astray used their association with him to do their own thing and they're going to walk before God and walk before that prophet and they're going to see him again all these that have made fun of him called him a liar a blasphemer how surprised they're going to be when they walk up before the judgment and he's on this side the throne side of the Judgment they're think he's going to walk up and be in Chains and going to be cast into hell ah surprise surprise surprise cuz there he will stand on this side of the throne and the bride sending there with him remember when he was carried beond the curtain of time in the sixth Dimension he did not see Luther's people Wesley's people Paul's people he only saw his own when I stand before that Prophet that day and he presents us as a bride I don't want him pointing his finger at me and say you hypocrite you added to what I said he said it plainly anybody that adds to what I say don't believe what I say yes amen oh my watch's this it's the water to the Sea if the seed's been planted that falls on you you say bless God let me tell you something preacher I'm so and so I don't believe in that stuff you're the denominational you're just an old hypocrite to start with right wow that's what kind of seed was planted so if you got a hybridized preacher standing in the pulpit and he sewing hibiz seed and he'll say just enough message well brother brandom said this and brother Ram said that and then says no more you know just just to keep on for the message people that that are waiting for that just to keep them on until little by little he begins to transubstantiate and take all that out and before long they're sitting our feet and constantly on him and the next thing you know the message is not being preached at all not even been preached at all oh but they just love him so much they could never leave him I love God more than I love any of you I love God more than I love my wife I love God more than I love my grandchildren my daughters my daughters and her children and my son-in-laws I love God more than I love any of you all yes sir and that's the way you ought to love God you ought to love God more than you do your mom you ought love God more than you do you Dad y'all love God more than you love me so here we are our nation what do we do how is it that politicians are talking about socialism communism quoting principles of Communism in their political speeches and the American people screaming and hollering yes yes and you think are you all out of your mind I'll answer that question yes they are I wouldn't be a bit surprised if they don't make one of the horriblest mistakes they'll ever make in their entire life notice this spoken words Original Seed page 42 the mind that's in Christ is in you see the minds in Christ in you will take the word say it with me a just like he did h just like he did C he was the word friends don't you understand why people can back out away from this message the message is something supplemental to their intellect it's something supplemental that they hear it and they they like it for a while and they enjoy it for a season but the reason they can part with it is because it was never part of who they are but if this word is you you would give up your life before you would give up this word but if it's not it's just a supplemental thing and it's just something that you take someone had sent me a clip not long ago the Young Smart elic message preacher and he was talking about oh how great it was just to realize that the message is just like a book you know setting up on the shelf and you just take it down and use it and use whatever part you want and then you just put it back up I thought yeah that's exactly where we are that's the kind of seeds that's being s You' got young people sitting there that's what they hear you've got old people sitting there that's what they here and then what kind of crop is it going to produce lead to seean tribulation bound message people oh Lord Jesus and the mind of Christ in you you are the word you're God's Living Word representatives of of him here on Earth that's right continuing the work the church should be that way listen this and when so the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of the disciples just like the disciples the Bible is living again in you we've got a translation you know in this day called The Living Translation that's what I am and that's what I'm wanting to become the living translation amen The Living Translation the Bible is living again notice again in you all right when so the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of Christ see call you oh goodness you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was yes and of course Christ was a predestinated seed I guess because God saw before the foundation of the world that he he wanted to be and then God predestinated him based on his forn knowledge of what he saw he wanted him to to be it's amazing how many message preachers preach that really well God before the world saw I wanted to be a good boy God said Donnie I admire that in you you want to be a good boy so I'm going to write your name down here on my good boy book so I'll wait till you're ready and willing and then whenever you do you'll walk up there to that altar glory to God you'll lay down your rods your Tabernacle your Sanctuary you'll lay your holy will on the altar then I'll be able to do something in you that I wanted trash nonsense I wasn't looking for for God I didn't want God come on somebody you all wasn't looking for God many of you was happy in your cigarettes you was happy in your Min skirts sister you was happy in your brushes you was happy doing all that thing of the world but the predestination of God got a hold to you when you wasn't looking for him you couldn't come to where he was so he come looking for you praise be to God I I am not a predestinated seed because I wanted to be I'm a predestinated seed just like Christ was as a matter of fact you Jesus and me all come from the same source Hallelujah you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was when the rain falls on that sea the light produces itself of the Holy Spirit Falls when it fell on those sea notice now that Jesus said he chose them when before the foundation of the world talking about the apostles now and them they go up to the upper room then there they were a predestinated seat is that right then here they haul themselves up in the upper room well that's what you've done tonight to church you haul that old carcass of yours to church some of you is tired some of you is wore out some of you had this and that and other on your mind you just said come on honey let's go to church you wasn't ready in no good frame of mind you didn't come prayed up you didn't come really expecting a whole lot of stuff all you done was hold yourself in and sat down at the church pew and you emptied your load and there you sat out and said move me if you can I'm down I'm weary it's raining outside and I don't like the rain I don't like this I don't like the music I don't like the temperature but I really need something from God yeah an attitud change well praise the Lord so they haul theirself into the upper room and that's what we done we Haul ourself into the Word of Life church tonight Hallelujah and what's fixing to fall the same rain that fell on them in the upper [Applause] room then here they haul themselves up in the upper room these seats dear Lord you mean to tell me brother bandam was identified Peter James John barthol all those Brothers as seeds and they ain't even got the Holy Ghost yet you see you were not you were seed before you was ever born you were seed and therefore reborn you did not become a seed when you got the Holy Ghost you were a seed it's why you could get the Holy Ghost oh they haul themselves up in the upper room them seeds the way and the Word was laying on there without any life in it all of a sudden there come a sound from Heaven as the waters begin to gust down and it actually filled all the house where they were sitting and the seeds begin to grow it began to manifest itself the word of God being made manifest listen at it oh it's pouring out there the trees are drinking it in the grass the distress of the hot dry September will be relieved and before the cold winter comes there'll be another burst of chlorophyll and the grass and the leaves and the grass will shoot up I know this is going to cuz I applied several hundred pounds of ammonium nitrate anybody need a hay Balor I want to load you down in spiritual ammonia nitrate triple 10 triple 19 I'm going to spray you so much brother Larry you're going to weigh 585 lb spiritually I want you young Caleb I want you young brothers and sisters to grow in the spirit of God you may come here sometime and think well I didn't get nothing out of the service no that's the same thing this grass said out here when I was putting that dry fertilizer on it I just spread it out just a singing as I was going cuz I knew when the rain come it's going to come up out of that ground it's going to come busting up there them Roots it's going to pull that phosphorus down there that ammonium and that nitrate it's going to get down inside and just going to say what in the world's going on with me I've got to grow I've got to go I'm getting out of here but it's the same with the Bride s the mechanics s the mechanics s the mechanics and we're waiting for the light of rain to fall when it does the bride Say Goodbye World goodbye Billy gr struck the world the Pentecostal struck the world the word has struck the world now what's the matter now she's waiting for the latter rain that's when she produces her fruits then the kind of seeds you have planted in your field will be the kind of crop that you reap yes so let me repeat it again to you now so in the small minuscule form that it was soed years and years ago questioning about brother brandom are you the only one to preach you see that Spirit was already around the Tabernacle it was already around the message people ain't that amazing you don't find that in Pentecostal churches or Baptist Churches or Presbyterian or Lutheran what's the main move that don't believe in Preachers Catholicism priests priest and one great holy man that's above everybody else you don't see Catholics going out casting out devils and evangelists and you know pastors and all that sort of thing but it's priests that intercede for you and pray for your prayer request pray for this that and the other uhhuh see where they're going back don't you oh mother so now many of the grandchildren of those who sewed those seeds ridicule laugh make fun of you all cuz you go to church and because you think you need a pastor and they ridicu you and people just like you around the world and their goal is for every preacher to sit down and start playing the same tape they play from Jeffersonville cuz that's the headquarters I agree with that it is the headquarters for that type of people but my headquarters ain't in Jeffersonville or been in Louisiana or up in Virginia in the Hill Country my headquarters ain't even in Johnson City my headquarters is up this way and the head of my quarter says go to church oh my look children seed of being sown you young people you're not ignorant you go to some of these youth meetings and you hear things being said you're seeing things happening it's causing questions I had to deal with some of them and are question answers cuz it's raising up questions what about this and I don't understand that and did Brother BM said that that's not the way Brother Don is saying well what's going on again seed time seed are being swn in the message sir seed are being sown in youth camps seed are being swn on the internet yes sir you know what I find amazing is how many of the message preachers absolutely blasted me for years years for straming our services and then whenever Co hit they they ever preaching the message on the internet I reckon they must have Sanctified it now so once they went on it they got it all cleaned up now I'm not against you listening to preachers on the internet as long as you got that filter of the Holy Ghost I ain't talking about me as your filter I'm talking about the Holy Ghost cuz every preacher has a narrative of some sort he's got an agenda he's got something he's trying to promote I do oh yeah I do I've got an agenda my agenda is a person but it ain't this person it's a risen savior my agenda is not to make our church a bunch of William brandom's Donnie Reagan darl WS no other man it's Sons and Daughters of God that become the Living Word you are the Bible living itself out is that what you want if it isn't then if I was you I'd go somewhere else because I am not going to change okay let me just let you know up front I am not going to change to where I want to have this this agenda that agenda no I'm not pushing gifts I'm pushing the giver praise the Lord I'm not pointing everybody in the message to this one man or that one man or that one man look friends I preach youth different youth conventions and camps around the world world now tell what it's heartbreaking I stood him one several years ago and Carol was there with me and there was some youth there from a certain move around this message you could tell every one of them they had a spirit about them they had an attitude about them the brother want me to have questions and answers I said brother I don't like doing that off the cuff he said oh brother Donnie you know please they want to do it they want to do it I said I'd rather study be able to have the answers I I know you but you don't have time you don't have time I felt so funny about it I said all right all right I'll do it well there were some of them they're just let me just be honest with you they were denominational message youth every one of them had this certain question about their Doctrine their certain terminology the Holy Ghost is moving people being healed people being delivered people being filled with the Holy Ghost and they was just sitting there cuz I never said their certain words and they were sitting there waiting for me to say seven Thunder and I didn't say it and they just could not understand how could God be moving when I never said their magic words cuz God don't move by magic words God moves by faith it was pitiful them young people that ask one question after another after another every one of them what about the Holy Ghost what about salvation Carol remembers it it was about their theology their Doctrine that's why I kept feeling that funny feeling but I've never been in them times types of situations when my back wasn't against the wall that I found out there somebody between me and the wall and he come and help me and off the top of my head and from down in my spirit and wherever all that stuff come from man alive I was still rejoicing Carol remembers that I mean the Lord took care of that real quick now that's been years ago you imagine now some of them guys are preachers married so wonder what now they've hybridized and some of the people in that move deacons stealing offerings hiring prostitutes molesting grandchildren horrible stuff but as long as they could shout and jump and run is that what we want is that what we want our church to turn into a bunch of perets Thieves Liars no we want genuine Christians how many wants that men women boys girls let's bury it together if you would oh Jesus sometimes I wish I could just get them together Lord and turn the internet off and just talk to him from my heart about some of the things I've seen and my years of travel around the world I think they'd understand a little better why I preached so hard against some of this know sense I wish some of the adults could have heard our brother and sister White's testimony the other night about what they had been through their experience of being identified around some of the same sort of people that I've preached about tonight oh the pain that it brings the scars Lord Jesus help us I pray forever God call me man Lord help us Jesus may we preach the word without fear without favor without compromise Lord I'm an old man now years ago when I first started preaching this message in my 30s I guess it was oh dear God I don't know how many more days of God how many more settings of the son I'll see but if time goes on there'll be someone that'll come and have to step here behind this pulpit and take the church Lord God what will it become I wonder what brother brandham would say if he could drive by brandham Tabernacle on Wednesday night drive by it on Sunday morning and Sunday night no church no church there's a preacher friend of mine I heard him say that he'd went there and just a tour it been years since he was there and he went in to see it smelled molded and musty I thought how sad some of the greatest sermons that was ever preached on the earth brought forth from that little Tabernacle and now shut down so what does the future hold for Word of Life maybe if I get a bit older and I can't preach no more and then devote some young guy in here that comes in they think he's on the word and they figure out he's got an agenda little by little he starts pulling them away from the message it quits referring to the prophet quits reading quotes and they notice for about two years that he don't even put a quote on his Facebook post but they think he's just trying to use wisdom and trying to bring people in Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus may you touch each heart it'll not just be us old people that'll keep the church strong the future of this church if there is a future ladies and the young people who come here there may be a young man standing here tonight that doesn't even know it but he might be the future pastor of this church of time teres what will he be an intellectual will he be sa he's preaching the fourth light when the whole time he actually emphasizing the third well he used the message as simply a a platform to launch his own version each one will bring forth each pastor each evangelist each teacher help me Lord God when I stand before you I know I've made many mistakes Lord but help me Jesus to stay true it's cost me many a friend no doubt I'll lose more before it's said and done Lord if I lose everyone this people here turns against me and they want nothing to do with me anymore then Lord as long as I've got you on my side you and I will be the majority but I believe there's people here who love you and love your word Lord God we're standing in great need tonight we've got Saints in our assembly that need Miracles Lord you don't vindicate lies you vindicate truth I want to preach a gospel that when my people get sick I can show them a Jesus that still heals amen and still delivers we love you father we worship you tonight Lord God thank you Father thank you Father Can we just raise our hands in the presence of the Lord may you look inside your own heart there for a few moments if you got anger resentment bitterness just something there in your heart that's not like the Lord remember when the rainfalls it'll produce whatever your garden is holding in seed form so let's love let's forgive let's be like Jesus that way when the latter rain falls what will it produce a mega do of Jesus Christ don't you see Word of Life Church what the Rapture is going to be the latter rain will be the power of God the rapturing faith that will produce in the bride such a Measure of Faith like she's never experienced before and it will change her body in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and it will come to such a power on the earth it will cause the resurrection and the Deads that's been dead for many hundreds and some of them for thousands of years will come out and will enter in with them to go meet our lord Jesus remember this is what the rapture faith is Mount Zion Showdown What a Sad thing it's going to be see for these hybridizing preachers and oh yeah they preach the message they say they do anyway they preach a Rapture but they're mixing a concoction of a conglomeration of all this mess and on the Rapture morning them and their people will be left cuz the preacher has has conceived hybrid seed within himself first then he has sown that seed in the hearts of his congregants so they take so much of the message so much of the Bible so much of this so much of that so much of something else and the mix it all together under the leadership of that preacher then when the latter rain falls it sends them straight to their Destiny the tribulation period and there'll be some men of God on the earth that have labored under the truth under their Ministries the bride of Christ will come to that place of rapturing faith and it'll sweep the world in a moment of time and our bodies will be changed the dead will be raised will get together with the rest of the group and come up missing on the earth and then the Mount Zion Showdown will be Jesus proving which one is bride yes now why would you have to prove that if you've only got one group of people claiming to be bride if the bride was the only one claiming to be bride her own claim would be enough but there's going to be all kinds of them claiming to be bride amen so it's up to Jesus to prove who is bride yes sir praise God oh how many wants to be so full of of the Holy Ghost would you just with me there tonight just raise your hands there Lord just tell him Lord if there's anything in my heart if there's anything in my life that displeases you Lord if I've got any bitterness any anger anything at all Lord God if I've got one Speck of my doctrine of what I preach to your people that's wrong that's contaminated show me Lord Jesus show me father if I've got any of ausa Street any of it left in me show me Lord God if I've got anything dear God any attitude toward any human being anything Lord God that would hinder me show me father I want to be right before you lord it's my desire to serve you to please you to live for you Lord It's My Desire Lord God that if I'm alive if I'm still here at this place and we go together in the rtes my desire that our our little group will be gathered together and we we'll be changed and we'll be gathered with all of our friends and our loved ones and then we'll be gathered with the resurrected Saints and then we'll be gathered with those who've gone on before us and we'll all be gathered somewhere in an invisible realm and there will be our Prophet which is also raised and we'll gather under the opes of the seventh angel then the first church Age 2 3D fourth fifth 6th and then the seventh will'll all start rising and then we will meet you and we'll be presented Paul will present his age on down on down on down to our age it will not be Paul that will present some of the these message preachers that think they know so much about the Bible if they don't stand with Elijah Malachi for and if they're not found under his resurrection message that means they are father it means they are not bride
