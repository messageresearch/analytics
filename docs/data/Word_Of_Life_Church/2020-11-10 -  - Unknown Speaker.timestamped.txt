[21:21] lord
[21:22] faith is the substance
[21:25] of things hoped for
[21:29] the evidence of things not seen
[21:33] that's crazy to the world isn't it the
[21:36] evidence
[21:37] of things hoped for the evidence
[21:41] you mean faith has an evidence faith is
[21:44] the evidence
[21:45] of things hoped for it's a substance
[21:48] it's just as real to you more real than
[21:51] this or
[21:52] this or this or this
[21:56] or symptoms it's an evidence
[21:59] now we're talking about bride material
[22:03] we thank god for positive test results
[22:06] we thank god for
[22:07] days when we feel better but real face
[22:11] says i'm healed whether i feel bad or
[22:13] not amen
[22:14] real faith says it well the doctor said
[22:16] bad news
[22:17] doesn't make any difference brother ben
[22:19] said the doctor could say you ain't got
[22:20] but a few minutes to live
[22:22] if it was dropped in your heart you
[22:24] could life in his face
[22:25] why you've got isaac
[22:28] and isaac is laughter amen don't you
[22:32] love him today don't you appreciate his
[22:34] grace and mercy
[22:35] to our hearts let's turn if you would to
[22:37] the book of romans chapter eight
[22:39] we're turning there and wanted to
[22:41] announce another
[22:43] wedding engagement of justin lovell and
[22:46] sister shalom swanson we're happy as
[22:50] long as he's moving this way
[22:51] we're not so happy if she's having to go
[22:54] there
[22:55] that's the downside of having all these
[22:57] girls in our church
[22:59] these guys from phoenix and from tucson
[23:01] and from louisiana they come here
[23:03] courtney and then take our saints away
[23:06] we're happy for him aren't we listen
[23:16] amen praise the lord
[23:19] romans chapter 8 verse 8
[23:23] so then they that are in the flesh
[23:26] cannot please god
[23:29] wow so if we take that literally as the
[23:33] english
[23:35] phrases it there is not a person in this
[23:38] building
[23:38] or one in the world can ever please god
[23:44] if we take it literally for what it says
[23:48] but now let's read a little further so
[23:49] then they that are in the flesh cannot
[23:52] please
[23:52] god but ye are not in the flesh
[23:56] wow somebody hit me with a wet noodle
[23:59] you've got to be kidding i'm not in the
[24:01] flesh and you all aren't
[24:02] in the flesh what in the world's causing
[24:07] us all these problems
[24:10] but listen but you are not in the flesh
[24:14] but in the spirit if so
[24:18] be that the spirit of god
[24:21] dwell in you
[24:25] now remember this is chapter 8 of course
[24:27] after chapter 7.
[24:29] chapter 8 does not cancel out seven it
[24:32] actually brings
[24:33] six and seven together in the merging
[24:37] of chapter eight now listen to this now
[24:40] if any man have not the spirit of christ
[24:43] he is none of his and if
[24:47] christ be in you the body
[24:50] is dead
[24:54] because of sin but the spirit
[24:57] is life because of righteousness
[25:02] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[25:04] jesus
[25:06] from the dead dwell in you
[25:09] he that raised up christ from
[25:12] the dead shall also quicken
[25:16] your mortal bodies by his spirit
[25:20] that dwelleth in you now this used to be
[25:23] one of my favorite scriptures when i was
[25:25] a pentecostal preacher
[25:28] but once i really realized what this
[25:31] scripture actually meant
[25:32] i used to use it all the time maybe many
[25:34] of you all heard it the same way
[25:36] that it was for shouting and dancing and
[25:39] you know highly emotional services that
[25:42] the spirit in you will quicken your
[25:43] mortal body
[25:44] but when you look at what paul's saying
[25:46] he ain't talking about shouting at all
[25:49] he's talking about our bodies being
[25:51] brought subject
[25:52] to the life that lives within us
[25:56] so it actually quickens our body
[26:00] to obedience aren't you grateful for
[26:02] that today
[26:04] i may like to be remembered today before
[26:05] the lord in prayer
[26:07] i have two requests i'd like to make
[26:09] known to you today the bible tells us to
[26:11] make our requests known and
[26:13] i'd like for you to be praying for my
[26:15] oldest daughter liz she's been sick for
[26:18] for several days um just not feeling
[26:20] well at all
[26:21] just ask that you remember her erica
[26:24] will begin her
[26:25] fourth treatment tomorrow monday tuesday
[26:27] and wednesday we got some really good
[26:29] reports from the doctor the words the
[26:31] doctor kept using over and over again
[26:32] was great
[26:33] she was doing great doing great so we're
[26:36] thankful
[26:37] we shouldn't really be surprised we have
[26:39] a great god
[26:41] he's a great mighty god
[26:45] praise the lord
[26:49] also brother louie has already mentioned
[26:51] all the other needs among
[26:52] among the body our assembly here and
[26:56] the philippines was hit with a terrible
[26:59] terrible typhoon and we have
[27:03] thousands and thousands of believers
[27:05] there on the islands of the philippines
[27:07] i haven't really heard any initial
[27:09] reports yet as far as
[27:10] lives damage churches things like that
[27:13] but we'd certainly like to remember them
[27:15] as well
[27:17] i'm sure that most of you understand
[27:18] that we are in a
[27:20] terrible time politically in the sense
[27:23] of the world
[27:25] facing an election this week and i know
[27:26] probably every one of you has got your
[27:28] own party and you've got your own man
[27:30] and i ain't interested in neither one of
[27:31] them
[27:32] one of them's i'm just a narcissist is
[27:35] all he can be and the other is a
[27:36] political crook and a liar
[27:37] so we ain't got no nobody choose from
[27:40] you you could vote for a groundhog and
[27:41] get a better option
[27:43] than either one of them so don't don't
[27:44] get either one of them get mad at me
[27:46] because we ain't got nobody's runs worth
[27:48] account
[27:49] but the way i read according to the
[27:51] bible the scripture said the powers that
[27:52] be
[27:53] are ordained of god
[27:56] and you're probably like me you want
[27:58] prophecy to come to pass i want the end
[28:00] time to come
[28:00] upon us and i want to get out of here
[28:02] but i want it to be as
[28:03] easy and as gently as possible
[28:07] [Music]
[28:08] i'm only being honest
[28:12] so i'm not telling you not to vote i'm
[28:14] going to tell you not to vote who to
[28:16] vote for and who not to vote for
[28:18] but there's one thing i'm going to tell
[28:19] you this morning we better pray
[28:22] because the lord knows who we need in
[28:24] the white house
[28:26] who do you sing what i'm saying don't
[28:28] really matter what you think
[28:29] to be honest don't really matter but the
[28:32] lord knows
[28:33] so let's take these requests to the lord
[28:36] today
[28:39] heavenly father as we bow our heads to
[28:43] the dust of the earth from once these
[28:44] bodies were taken
[28:47] we bring many needs and requests before
[28:50] you today
[28:52] but we're instructed to ask for great
[28:55] things
[28:57] and for many of them we know lord that
[29:00] you're not
[29:01] rationing your power
[29:05] your greatness is so been expressed
[29:09] to our hearts and our lives and we're so
[29:12] thankful
[29:14] in one way we hate to constantly come
[29:16] before you
[29:17] with this need and that need and another
[29:20] need
[29:22] but i remember reading of your children
[29:26] as they come out of the land of egypt
[29:27] and how there was
[29:30] two and a half million of them or so
[29:33] there was no walmarts no krogers
[29:36] there was no dollar general store so
[29:38] they could run over and
[29:40] get a pair of shoes if they needed some
[29:43] water if they needed something to eat
[29:46] they had no grocery trains that was
[29:48] following them
[29:50] there was no supply lines
[29:54] but you love them so much father
[29:58] you sent them water you sent them meat
[30:00] you sent them bread from heaven
[30:03] their shoes their clothes they didn't
[30:05] have no malls to be able to buy clothes
[30:08] but their shoes never wore out nor their
[30:11] clothes
[30:12] so we believe you're just as concerned
[30:14] about our needs today
[30:17] father you see our nation where we are
[30:19] facing an election week and
[30:21] probably for most of us this is no doubt
[30:24] the most important election in our life
[30:28] lord god i'm neither democrat nor
[30:31] republican
[30:32] i'm a christian i've never voted in my
[30:35] life and i have no plan on starting it
[30:37] now
[30:38] but there's one thing i can do i can
[30:41] pray
[30:42] and lord jesus you see the way we need
[30:45] to go
[30:46] whichever man we need in the white house
[30:48] whichever party
[30:50] we need to control the white house the
[30:52] senate
[30:53] and the congress we pray your divine
[30:56] will
[30:57] will be done that's one thing we
[31:00] all as christians can agree on you know
[31:03] better than we do
[31:05] so we pray father that you bring to pass
[31:08] your divine order those that are sick
[31:10] those that are afflicted
[31:12] may you be mindful of us lord as we
[31:15] endeavor to look into your word and
[31:17] break the bread of life i pray that you
[31:19] should help me to get out of the way
[31:20] father
[31:21] in the name of the lord jesus we ask him
[31:24] and the saints said
[31:25] amen amen god bless you you may be
[31:30] seated
[31:39] really the only way you and i could ever
[31:42] come back to god and be reconciled
[31:46] in his presence is because
[31:49] our god had to canoes himself
[31:55] away from the shekinah
[32:00] away from the fullness
[32:03] of what he was in the form of the word
[32:07] had he left us here in this
[32:10] earth as mortals to defend ourselves
[32:14] to try to find our way somehow back to
[32:18] god
[32:19] every one of us here today would be lost
[32:23] no hope for us paul says here in romans
[32:26] 8
[32:27] 10 and if christ being you
[32:31] the body is dead now the english here
[32:34] doesn't actually give
[32:36] the true perspective of the greek words
[32:40] that paul
[32:40] used actually the words that he uses
[32:44] references that the body is not actually
[32:48] physically dead but subject
[32:51] to death because of sin
[32:55] i hope you can understand it today that
[32:58] before
[32:59] sin there was no mortality
[33:03] there were no mortal leaves
[33:08] the garden of eden never had a fall
[33:11] the garden of eden never had winter
[33:15] it never had snow it never had rain
[33:19] it never had a frost the trees were
[33:23] constantly
[33:25] being renewed and when adam and eve had
[33:28] pulled the fruit
[33:29] off of the trees it was constantly
[33:32] being replenished there was no mortality
[33:37] there were no dead animals
[33:40] no dead birds you would never walk by
[33:45] a tree as we can see
[33:48] and as the wind blows even this morning
[33:51] i looked at my window at home and saw
[33:53] the leaves that were falling by the
[33:56] hundreds
[33:57] well what does that speak up it speaks
[34:00] of
[34:01] a mortality that not only struck us
[34:05] but that struck all of nature
[34:08] now whether it would be dogs cats
[34:11] elephants
[34:12] oils whatever more there are no
[34:16] animals there are no bugs no microbes
[34:20] no micro isms nothing that can live
[34:24] eternally under the curse of what took
[34:28] place
[34:28] in the garden of eden and yet god
[34:32] did not ordain mortality
[34:35] to be our destiny only a spot
[34:39] that we would be in it in this sequence
[34:43] of time we were not made to be mortal
[34:47] that's why when we reach a certain age
[34:50] and wrinkles start coming in our face
[34:52] and our hair
[34:53] turns gray or loose whichever it is
[34:57] what is it a sign of mortality
[35:00] so when you get up of a morning and
[35:02] you've got aches and pains
[35:04] you weren't meant to have that actually
[35:07] the body
[35:08] renews itself every seven years
[35:12] you were meant to be able to eat foods
[35:15] that would provide the nutrients and the
[35:18] nourishments
[35:19] that you would need where you would
[35:21] never die
[35:23] and you would have lived and ate and
[35:26] drank
[35:27] and continually lived forever
[35:30] was ever out aging one hour
[35:34] so you would have never got old you
[35:37] would have never got crippled
[35:39] you would have never lost your sight or
[35:41] your hearing
[35:43] but sin brought mortality then death
[35:47] entered into the world by sin
[35:51] so there's only one way sin can be taken
[35:55] out of the world and that again
[35:58] is by death but it's not
[36:01] by the deaths of an animal it's not
[36:04] by the deaths of botany life
[36:07] not by the deaths of even good people
[36:11] but it must be by the deaths
[36:14] of him who gave life
[36:18] now we can get ourselves in trouble
[36:22] but most of time we can't get ourselves
[36:24] out
[36:26] we can sin without any help
[36:30] but we can't be made righteous without
[36:33] help
[36:34] we can make the office messes in the
[36:37] world
[36:38] without any help then when we get help
[36:41] we're really in a mess
[36:43] well come on it's the truth that's why
[36:45] when you put people in a gang mentality
[36:48] that's why things go absolutely crazy
[36:51] because you within yourself me within
[36:54] myself can make up enough mess
[36:56] and then you get a bunch of us together
[36:58] and boy we can really tear
[37:00] things up but there had to be
[37:03] something someone that would come
[37:07] that was not mortal yet he had to become
[37:11] mortal in order to pay the penalty
[37:14] and the price of mortality you see that
[37:18] price could not remain
[37:20] in the realm of eternity and ever cover
[37:23] the debt that we
[37:24] owed so the eternal had to become
[37:27] mortal himself the eternal had to become
[37:32] mortal and how could the eternal ever
[37:35] become
[37:36] mortal when god could never die
[37:39] so then we come to the mystery or the
[37:42] marvel
[37:43] of what is called the son of god not
[37:45] another person in the godhead
[37:47] not another being which was less god
[37:51] but god himself in a form of
[37:54] condescension
[37:55] that he would condescend to a level that
[37:58] he would be able to feel
[38:00] and deal with mortality so if sin
[38:04] entered into the human race and by that
[38:08] the end result was
[38:09] death and it set the cycle of mortality
[38:13] what a sad day it must have been when
[38:16] adam and eve were forced
[38:18] out of the garden of eden and when they
[38:21] moved beyond the gates
[38:22] of paradise and they had to turn and
[38:26] we we know that they stayed right near
[38:29] the gate
[38:30] initially because paradise then
[38:34] the garden of eden being located in the
[38:36] land of egypt
[38:38] and mesopotamia being called the cradle
[38:41] of
[38:41] civilization and when they were
[38:44] cast out there was still something in
[38:48] adam's nature that he wanted to be
[38:51] close to god they
[38:54] taught their voice and they
[38:58] actually did not teach them the right
[39:00] way you remember the sermon the lord
[39:02] gave me years ago on
[39:04] my father taught me wrong they did not
[39:07] teach them
[39:08] the full understanding that they were
[39:11] brought out
[39:12] by disobedience by blood
[39:15] so when cain goes to bring an offering
[39:18] to god
[39:19] he brings his fruits his labors his
[39:22] vegetables but abel by revelation
[39:26] brought life and by that it showed
[39:30] that he had a direct contact into the
[39:33] presence of god so the first
[39:35] mortal outside of the gates of paradise
[39:39] god reveals to him the way back
[39:43] and yet he was not there when his mother
[39:45] and father
[39:46] were called to the carpet as we would
[39:49] say
[39:50] and god went running through the garden
[39:52] of eden screaming
[39:54] adam where are you where are you
[39:57] finally adam called out from behind the
[39:59] bushes
[40:01] his flesh trembling and the first time
[40:04] in his life he feels fear
[40:08] trauma must have run over his entire
[40:11] body
[40:12] as his flesh quivered and trembled he'd
[40:16] never
[40:16] experienced it before that's hard for us
[40:19] to imagine
[40:20] it's all we've known as mortals but yet
[40:23] for them to experience in their first
[40:26] time
[40:27] the trauma of fear and hearing the voice
[40:31] of god which the day before
[40:33] and the day before and the day before
[40:35] and the day before
[40:36] have brought them such happiness and
[40:39] such
[40:39] peace but today the voice of god
[40:43] brings trauma and fear and anxiety
[40:49] adam where are you
[40:52] i'm over here i heard your voice
[40:57] walking in the garden and i was afraid
[41:02] because i am naked
[41:06] now the man had made a fig leaf apron
[41:10] but that apron did not hide his sin
[41:12] [Music]
[41:14] is that right he knew he was
[41:17] naked so he needed help
[41:20] with his atonement and god
[41:24] by his mercy killed a lamb
[41:27] and threw the skin in behind the bushes
[41:31] where adam and eve were and told them to
[41:35] put it on god is not going to reverse
[41:39] now their mortality god is not going to
[41:43] reverse
[41:45] this conscience level that they've moved
[41:48] into they lived in this first
[41:50] dispensation in the garden of eden
[41:52] was innocence but by partaking of the
[41:55] fruit
[41:56] disobeying the word adam himself and eve
[42:00] brought a dispensational change they
[42:04] then move
[42:04] into the dispensation of conscience
[42:09] so now they begin to experience what is
[42:13] right and wrong the feelings
[42:16] of conviction condemnation
[42:20] the knowing that you never ever again
[42:24] will you ever be able to have a perfect
[42:27] day
[42:27] on earth
[42:31] for us that's all we've ever known
[42:34] as you know i've been preaching since i
[42:36] was a little boy just 18 years old
[42:39] i'm 64. been preaching most of my life
[42:42] preached thousands of sermons
[42:44] around the world and i've never preached
[42:47] a perfect one
[42:49] i've made mistakes in every one of them
[42:53] we've got musicians here that are very
[42:55] talented brothers and sisters
[42:58] they've never played a perfect song in
[43:00] their life
[43:01] we've got many singers that are talented
[43:04] songwriters and so on
[43:06] they've never sung a perfect song
[43:10] you christians many of you been living
[43:12] god for decades
[43:13] giving your life to him you've never had
[43:16] a perfect day when you could say today
[43:19] was
[43:20] absolutely perfect you've never had one
[43:27] you'd stand and would have you all to
[43:29] stand and give a testimony today of the
[43:31] greatness of god in your life
[43:33] none of you would give a perfect
[43:34] testimony you would probably think why
[43:37] did i say that i wish i would have said
[43:39] that
[43:40] i wish i'd have left that out and said
[43:42] this you see we don't know
[43:44] perfection in reality we cannot even
[43:48] understand it we use the word
[43:52] and we use it so loosely well this was a
[43:55] perfect day
[43:56] the sun was so beautiful and the
[43:58] temperature was just right
[44:00] and there was no wind uh there was no
[44:03] clouds in the sky
[44:05] but it wasn't a perfect day thousands
[44:07] die
[44:08] every hour so no matter what we look at
[44:13] there's nothing in this life that is
[44:16] actually able to reach the goal
[44:20] of perfection and there was only one
[44:24] who had perfection was in himself
[44:28] but how do you get that perfection broke
[44:31] down
[44:31] into the realm of mortals who were never
[44:35] meant to be this way anyway
[44:38] if you come in the state of perfection
[44:40] itself
[44:42] and you remain in that state you cannot
[44:45] divide yourself
[44:46] and share that with these mortals that
[44:49] use so
[44:50] hunger to have them in your presence
[44:54] you see the desire that we have is only
[44:57] half
[44:58] of this story you want to see him
[45:01] not near as bad as he wants to see you
[45:05] you long to go to heaven do you not you
[45:08] long for the rapture we long to see our
[45:10] loved ones we long
[45:12] for the great gathering together we
[45:14] don't long for it near as much as he
[45:16] does he longed for it before there was
[45:19] ever a molecule before there's ever one
[45:21] cosmic ray of light he longed to have
[45:24] you there in his presence
[45:27] and yet he allowed mortality to move
[45:30] into the cycle as we spoke about it
[45:32] before the little loop of time
[45:35] that come right down to the cycle in
[45:37] order to express the greatness of his
[45:40] attributes now when paul is writing here
[45:43] in romans chapter 8 by this stage and
[45:45] the journey
[45:46] of course the apostolic time it was
[45:48] meant in succession and it was going on
[45:51] the book of romans written around 64 a.d
[45:54] something like that
[45:55] so christianity had been around for
[45:58] about 30 years
[46:00] as far as what god was doing in the
[46:02] church and there were people from rome
[46:04] which are very vile
[46:05] people had a very bad background the
[46:08] crinton people were
[46:09] were a mixture of greeks and romans and
[46:13] corinthians corinth was a port city a
[46:15] very
[46:16] wicked wicked place and yet god through
[46:19] all of this had established churches now
[46:22] in different continents and different
[46:23] nations and god
[46:25] was pulling the people together and
[46:27] there needed to be a gospel message that
[46:30] was beyond
[46:31] matthew mark luke and john
[46:35] we thank god for the four gospels but i
[46:38] thank god that's not the end of it
[46:40] we would not know a lot of how to
[46:42] conduct ourself
[46:43] in life and in the church and in our
[46:46] behavior in the world
[46:48] if we only have the gospels is that
[46:50] right and yet god
[46:52] chose one man for the most part which
[46:54] was paul
[46:56] that was going to be anointed the first
[46:58] church age messenger
[46:59] to be able to bring most of how we were
[47:02] to live
[47:03] how we were to behave the doctrines of
[47:06] the church dress
[47:07] and so on and so on why because matthew
[47:09] mark luke and john
[47:11] was not called to write much of those
[47:13] things
[47:14] the lord jesus could have said those
[47:16] things when he was here
[47:17] but he chose not to it was a
[47:20] dispensation that would be administered
[47:22] to
[47:23] by himself through the gifts in his body
[47:27] called preachers is that right
[47:30] now then if the spirit of god lives
[47:33] inside of us this is one of the true
[47:35] signs
[47:36] that we have the holy ghost that the
[47:38] spirit of god
[47:39] will bring our bodies subject to the
[47:42] word
[47:43] now this happens of course because the
[47:45] lord jesus
[47:46] desired to express himself and the sense
[47:49] is that the gospel by the
[47:51] influence of the spirit of god will
[47:54] bring
[47:54] the entire man in subjection
[47:57] to the word so the indwelling of the
[48:00] holy ghost
[48:01] actually places our soul further back
[48:05] than adam and eve was in the garden of
[48:08] eden
[48:09] now i know it may seem odd to you to say
[48:11] that but yet
[48:12] when you look at it i don't know i've
[48:14] never found actually what adam
[48:16] actually had in the garden of eden i
[48:18] know he had an express
[48:19] image and it was something that god had
[48:21] given to him that was eternal
[48:23] breathed into him the breath of life and
[48:25] he became a living soul which bore the
[48:27] image of the invisible god
[48:29] but yet whatever it was that he received
[48:32] he could
[48:32] lose by disobedience right and this
[48:36] is why we are where we are today but the
[48:38] lord jesus and the new testament perform
[48:41] such a work that those that would
[48:43] actually get
[48:44] in christ jesus and be hid away in him
[48:48] they would be sealed further back than
[48:50] adam and eve
[48:51] ever was in the garden of eden now for
[48:54] those of you today who had the true
[48:55] baptism of the holy ghost
[48:57] adam fell he fell you know on and on and
[49:00] on the story goes
[49:01] but if you are sealed by the holy ghost
[49:03] the bible tells us
[49:05] that you've got these virtues of the
[49:06] lord god inside of you
[49:08] you will never fall
[49:11] so that shows us the greatness of the
[49:14] work
[49:15] that transpired at calvary was even
[49:18] greater than the original creation
[49:20] in the garden of eden now we're
[49:22] certainly long do we not we long for
[49:24] paradise to be restored
[49:26] but in reality paradise is already
[49:29] in the phase of restoration because
[49:32] those who have the true baptism of the
[49:34] holy ghost they have already
[49:37] entered into that secret place in christ
[49:40] jesus and their soul is sealed in the
[49:42] presence of god and then when the body
[49:44] dies
[49:45] the soul goes into the theophany and the
[49:47] presence of god
[49:48] then the resurrection they both come
[49:50] back to meet the redeemed body
[49:51] now this is not the end for the body
[49:54] itself there is a future for the body
[49:56] thank god
[49:56] but notice this in romans chapter 8
[49:58] verse 12
[49:59] therefore brethren we are debtors not
[50:03] to the flesh to live after the flesh
[50:06] now here is a man that you all believe
[50:08] with me i'm sure had the true baptism of
[50:11] the holy ghost how many believes that
[50:12] and yet paul is still writing in chapter
[50:15] 6 of romans chapter 7 of romans chapter
[50:17] 8 of romans
[50:18] and he's still writing about apparently
[50:21] a battle that is going
[50:22] on between the regenerated part the soul
[50:26] and the part which is not regenerated
[50:28] which is the flesh
[50:30] notice how that he approaches this
[50:32] therefore brethren we
[50:33] are deaders not to the flesh look at
[50:36] this meaning of this word
[50:37] one who owes another one held by
[50:41] some obligation bound by some duty
[50:45] one who has not yet made amends to whom
[50:48] he has
[50:48] injured so in other words paul is saying
[50:51] to us that are redeemed in the soul
[50:53] that we are not in debt to our flesh
[50:56] to obey our fleshly desires
[50:59] if they are contrary to the word of god
[51:03] right but who are we in debt to the
[51:06] almighty god every day of your life
[51:09] now notice therefore brethren we are not
[51:11] deaderst not to the flesh
[51:13] to live out to the flesh for if you live
[51:16] after the flesh ye shall die now here
[51:19] he's bringing in the consequence
[51:21] of how that being born again this is why
[51:23] it goes back to the other verses that we
[51:25] read that he said that if we are in the
[51:27] flesh we cannot even please god
[51:30] so he's not saying that a soul left an
[51:32] immortal body cannot please god
[51:34] but a soul left in a mortal body that
[51:36] tries to please the soul
[51:38] and tries to please the flesh it's
[51:40] totally
[51:41] impossible you've got to make your
[51:44] choice of which one you're going to
[51:45] serve
[51:46] that's right for if you live out to the
[51:48] flesh you shall die
[51:50] but if you through the spirit
[51:53] do mortify the deeds
[51:56] of the body ye shall live
[52:00] mortify not then to live out to the
[52:02] flesh
[52:03] is to obey the orders of the flesh which
[52:07] is still
[52:08] unregenerate now remember your body is
[52:10] in a state of spiritual neutrality
[52:13] how that your body can do right or wrong
[52:16] now praise the lord everybody's going to
[52:17] say amen right
[52:18] brother louis said make your mask puff
[52:20] now
[52:22] i don't want snoring ones i don't want
[52:25] them sucked over your face i want you
[52:26] saying amen breathing out not breathing
[52:29] in now to live out to the flesh then
[52:32] is to obey the flesh and to know that
[52:35] our flesh it has the ability of sin
[52:37] praise the lord i love you jesus
[52:39] or if you lose your temper and boy can
[52:41] say things and run off at the mouth
[52:43] amen or you can say things about one
[52:46] another that you shouldn't say well
[52:47] who's doing that your soul
[52:49] or your body amen is that right now
[52:52] notice again then paul said that if the
[52:55] spirit of god is in us
[52:57] then we have the ability to mortify
[53:00] the deeds of the body what a peculiar
[53:03] word
[53:03] so sin is mortified in its
[53:07] power whenever the holy ghost from the
[53:10] soul
[53:10] captures it and brings it into captivity
[53:14] so then it
[53:15] actually ceases to be active
[53:18] as it was now i know this may seem odd
[53:21] to you
[53:21] but mortification is not something that
[53:24] happens
[53:24] one time now listen to me so that you
[53:27] don't misunderstand
[53:28] where i'm going i'm not saying by any
[53:30] means at
[53:31] all that a person who is born again does
[53:34] not have any control
[53:35] over their body if you have no control
[53:37] over your body
[53:38] you are not born again but your
[53:42] body is not born again but the new birth
[53:46] wants to bring the body into a state of
[53:49] continual
[53:50] ongoing mortification now whenever the
[53:53] lord
[53:54] strikes our nature the old nature and
[53:56] the all nature
[53:57] actually dies and we are born again that
[54:00] is not something that is gradual
[54:03] that is not something that is day by day
[54:05] by day
[54:06] and then gradually you grow into more of
[54:08] the holy ghost and more of the holy
[54:10] ghost and then one day
[54:11] you realize you got the holy ghost
[54:13] somehow you don't know when you got it
[54:14] but you growed into it no
[54:15] the holy ghost is an experience is that
[54:19] right
[54:19] it's not an ongoing something that takes
[54:22] you 45 years to get it
[54:25] you can get it right here today if you
[54:26] don't have it
[54:28] in a moment and a twinkling of an hour
[54:31] is that right but notice then whenever
[54:34] we move mortification then to the body
[54:37] it is not something that happens
[54:39] instantaneously
[54:40] as the new birth does now this is what
[54:42] seems to be so confusing to so many
[54:44] folks
[54:44] because they read quotes like this or
[54:46] scriptures like this
[54:48] and they will say well my goodness i've
[54:49] got the holy ghost and i believe i'm
[54:51] born again
[54:52] how come my flesh still bothers them and
[54:54] how come this still bothers me
[54:55] and then others will say bless god if
[54:57] you ever get to holy ghost
[54:58] you'll never look at a woman i'll tell
[55:01] you one thing
[55:01] you'll never get aggravated you'll never
[55:04] get upset
[55:05] they're lying to you
[55:06] [Applause]
[55:10] well praise the lord but mortification
[55:14] must be a continual necessarily
[55:17] painful procedure that goes on
[55:20] in the life of every child of god now
[55:23] there's
[55:24] no way that we can mortify our bodies
[55:27] without it causing pain now think of it
[55:30] there's no way an animal or a mortal
[55:33] can be able to leave out of this life
[55:36] all you people say well boy
[55:37] i've been able to go to sleep on you
[55:39] know and go lay down and sleep at night
[55:41] and then you die in your sleep
[55:42] that would be ideal but you might not
[55:44] have known it but somehow you're
[55:45] experiencing some type of pain you're
[55:48] having a heart attack you're having
[55:49] whatever
[55:50] more so death does not come and strike a
[55:53] mortal
[55:54] without an element of pain now when we
[55:57] bring that then to the
[55:58] continual sacrificial life of a child of
[56:01] god it's going to bring pain
[56:04] because the mortification on our body
[56:07] cannot be pain free now i know we don't
[56:10] like that
[56:11] we want it to be pain free and we'd like
[56:13] to have all kinds of spiritual shots and
[56:16] all kinds of spiritual pills and you
[56:17] know where we can be able to leave this
[56:19] life as a pain-free mortal it ain't
[56:21] going to happen
[56:22] now i guarantee you one thing any of you
[56:24] that's ever experienced a lot of pain
[56:26] how many y'all's experienced pain before
[56:28] whether by cut or pull muscle in your
[56:30] back or a kidney stone or whatever it is
[56:32] oh my goodness
[56:34] whenever they give you a shot the last
[56:35] big kidney stone i have and i went to
[56:37] franklin woods and took them in there
[56:38] and i was trying to sit on the bed i
[56:40] couldn't sit on the bed i was standing
[56:42] up
[56:42] i was moving i was twisting around they
[56:44] gave me morphine and tore it all
[56:46] at the same time both of them at the
[56:49] same time i was tearing the sheets off
[56:51] the bed
[56:52] i was up i was moving i was trying to
[56:54] stand still
[56:55] but in a few minutes a warm thing hit me
[56:57] in the back of my neck which they said
[56:58] it would
[56:59] and whenever that warm feeling hit me in
[57:01] the back of my neck
[57:02] all of a sudden i felt a relief come
[57:05] over my body
[57:06] i wanted to buy a 55 gallon drum of that
[57:09] stuff
[57:09] just in case it ever hit me again
[57:14] now those of you that ain't had kidneys
[57:15] don't you're sitting or the big frown on
[57:17] your face if you've ever had one
[57:19] or your husband or your dad's had one
[57:21] you can smile because you know what i'm
[57:22] talking about
[57:23] so there's something about pain that we
[57:26] don't like i don't like pain myself
[57:28] i don't like pain i've had a lot of in
[57:30] my life as most of us mortals have
[57:32] and it's worse in the sense when it
[57:34] comes to the body
[57:36] on a continual diet you see those that
[57:38] are christ
[57:39] have crucified the flesh that's what
[57:41] paul says in the book of galatians
[57:43] they that are christ which is possessive
[57:46] they have crucified the flesh but it's
[57:48] not
[57:49] just something that happened one time
[57:51] and that's the
[57:52] end it is an ongoing continual
[57:55] crucifixion
[57:56] this is what god is requiring for us
[57:59] all praise the lord and this is what
[58:02] made it possible
[58:03] was the kenosis or the emptying out of
[58:06] our lord jesus
[58:07] in order to have a church that he would
[58:10] call
[58:10] his bride now this is what separates one
[58:12] of the many things that separates the
[58:14] bride from the church because the church
[58:16] natural
[58:16] they don't want to go to hell they don't
[58:18] want to be lost they don't want you know
[58:19] any those sort of thing
[58:20] but they don't want to live a continual
[58:23] life
[58:24] on the cross now living a life
[58:28] on the cross is not an easy life
[58:31] living alive on the cross and the lord
[58:33] jesus spoke more about your cross and my
[58:35] cross than he did about his own cross
[58:38] as a matter of fact he spoke about your
[58:39] cross before he spoke about his own
[58:41] if any man will follow me let him take
[58:44] up his
[58:45] cross and follow me once at least once a
[58:48] week
[58:49] at least once a month no let him follow
[58:51] me daily
[58:53] now the more painful and you know that's
[58:56] so sad but with human beings
[58:57] what i've found so many times in the
[58:59] lives of many people
[59:00] is the longer they prolong this thing
[59:03] about giving up
[59:04] everything to god the more painful the
[59:08] deaths
[59:08] will actually be there are some that are
[59:11] able by the grace of god
[59:12] they realize they're wrong and they
[59:14] realize mortification is the only way to
[59:16] be able to deal with this body
[59:17] and they're able to come to that
[59:19] recognition pretty soon in life
[59:21] and they're able by the spirit of god to
[59:23] be able to give over the body to
[59:25] mortification
[59:26] not saying that it doesn't arise every
[59:28] now and then and bother them and try to
[59:29] affect them
[59:30] but it no longer controls them it is not
[59:33] their master
[59:34] it is not their master but they control
[59:37] it
[59:37] and there's others and they give a
[59:39] little bit to god and then they go on
[59:40] and they give a little bit more to god
[59:42] and they spread it over five years and
[59:44] then 10 years and 15 years
[59:46] and 20 years and they're only prolonging
[59:48] the inevitable
[59:50] you see to be the bride this is
[59:52] inevitable for every one of us
[59:54] whether you're a prophet whether you're
[59:55] a pastor or a sunday school teacher
[59:57] no matter who you are every one of us
[1:00:00] must mortify
[1:00:01] the deeds of our body what am i speaking
[1:00:03] about i'm speaking about
[1:00:05] isaac bringing ishmael under control
[1:00:09] because isaac is the promised son and
[1:00:12] his smell is the troubled one
[1:00:15] whoa boy that was good right there and
[1:00:17] then my my
[1:00:19] isaac is the promised son and ishmael is
[1:00:22] the troubled one
[1:00:23] then what's going to happen why don't we
[1:00:25] just take a knife and slit this
[1:00:27] ishmael's throat that's not the way god
[1:00:29] wants it done
[1:00:30] it wants it through the power of
[1:00:32] sanctification which runs in on
[1:00:34] mortality
[1:00:35] and then it produces what to the body it
[1:00:38] mortifies the deeds
[1:00:40] of the body oh my my thank you all for
[1:00:44] saying amen so much as more
[1:00:46] now notice this cannot be done by
[1:00:48] ourselves
[1:00:50] but it will never be done without
[1:00:53] ourselves let me say it again
[1:00:54] this cannot be done by ourselves
[1:00:58] but it will not be done without
[1:01:00] ourselves i want you to notice how paul
[1:01:02] is separating this from the new birth so
[1:01:05] he did not say that
[1:01:06] god mortified the deeds of your body but
[1:01:09] you
[1:01:10] are to mortify so from there it lets us
[1:01:13] know we're speaking to people that are
[1:01:15] born again
[1:01:16] in romans chapter 8 still following
[1:01:18] chapter 7.
[1:01:19] so he's speaking to those who have the
[1:01:22] indwelling presence of christ
[1:01:24] living inside of them but he is telling
[1:01:26] them
[1:01:27] for them to mortify the deeds of their
[1:01:30] body well why don't the holy ghost do it
[1:01:32] why don't he just do everything we'd be
[1:01:35] more lazy than what we are
[1:01:38] so notice it cannot be done by ourselves
[1:01:41] but it will not be done without
[1:01:44] ourselves
[1:01:45] oh hallelujah we can sin of
[1:01:48] ourselves but we can't make ourselves
[1:01:51] righteous
[1:01:53] is that right we know how to be slaves
[1:01:56] but we cannot free ourselves
[1:01:59] notice in romans chapter 8 verse 13
[1:02:02] for if you live out to the flesh you
[1:02:05] shall die but
[1:02:06] if ye notice now the channel watch him
[1:02:09] as he brings it together now of you from
[1:02:11] the soul
[1:02:12] and you by that choice if you through
[1:02:15] the spirit do mortify the deeds of the
[1:02:17] body who's he talking about
[1:02:19] he's separating you from you so
[1:02:22] if you by the spirit do mortify the
[1:02:25] deeds of the body
[1:02:26] so he's not even calling you the body
[1:02:30] he's separating you from your body don't
[1:02:33] you understand
[1:02:34] glory to god he's speaking about the
[1:02:37] work
[1:02:37] of incarnation but people
[1:02:40] think the work of incarnation was jesus
[1:02:43] though the lord of jesus only no
[1:02:45] that was the beginning that was the
[1:02:48] beginning
[1:02:49] of a continual do you understand for
[1:02:51] seven church ages
[1:02:53] for 2 000 years god has been the work of
[1:02:57] incarnation and every holy ghost feels
[1:02:59] saying the work of
[1:03:01] incarnation is going on right here today
[1:03:03] in this building
[1:03:04] the spirit of god incarnating himself in
[1:03:07] our flesh
[1:03:09] [Applause]
[1:03:12] lord jesus but if you through the spirit
[1:03:17] if ye through the spirit do mortify
[1:03:21] the deeds of the body
[1:03:24] ye shall live
[1:03:28] ye who
[1:03:36] you see the fallen nature
[1:03:40] that every one of us still have in the
[1:03:43] flesh
[1:03:44] not the soul in the flesh
[1:03:48] the propensities to do wrong
[1:03:51] the incarnations
[1:03:58] so y'all believe that brother branham
[1:04:01] had the cross on his mirror
[1:04:02] in the car for decoration right
[1:04:05] [Music]
[1:04:06] really you know you mean you believe
[1:04:09] that was there for
[1:04:10] to to help him some way he was immortal
[1:04:17] praise the lord
[1:04:20] so it's to kill to kill
[1:04:25] the appetites
[1:04:28] that are in our mortality and your paul
[1:04:31] about dividing this is showing the work
[1:04:35] of incarnation this could not be said to
[1:04:37] people that are not born again is
[1:04:39] impossible
[1:04:40] their soul their spirit their body is
[1:04:43] all
[1:04:44] vile and corrupt this could only be
[1:04:47] addressed to those who have the holy
[1:04:49] ghost
[1:04:50] so if ye have the spirit what are you to
[1:04:53] do with it not just signs wonders and
[1:04:55] miracles
[1:04:56] but mortify the deeds
[1:04:59] of your body notice this i love this in
[1:05:03] romans 8 14
[1:05:04] for as many as are led
[1:05:08] by the spirit of god they are the sons
[1:05:12] of god
[1:05:14] this is a mark of a son and daughter of
[1:05:16] god
[1:05:18] they're led not
[1:05:21] driven
[1:05:22] [Music]
[1:05:25] now watch a person in a justified and
[1:05:27] sanctified state
[1:05:29] they will have to be driven to do many
[1:05:32] things
[1:05:33] why because their nature still in their
[1:05:36] soul
[1:05:36] has not been born again and they've got
[1:05:39] to be drove to the
[1:05:41] don't do this and don't do that and
[1:05:43] don't do this and don't do that
[1:05:45] but if they ever get the holy ghost
[1:05:47] those driving days are over
[1:05:50] why because from their soul now notice
[1:05:53] i'm not talking about people who say
[1:05:55] well i feel led to do this and i feel
[1:05:57] led to do that look come on let's be
[1:05:58] honest
[1:05:59] we've all felt led to do a lot of things
[1:06:01] when we found out it was either the
[1:06:02] devil or our flesh
[1:06:04] it wasn't a bit more god than the man on
[1:06:05] the moon and yet well i feel led to do
[1:06:07] this i'm talking about that
[1:06:10] i'm talking about notice he's not just
[1:06:12] talking about feeling led to move here
[1:06:14] or feeling led
[1:06:15] by this car feeling led to go to work
[1:06:17] over here he's talking about us
[1:06:19] being led by the spirit of god every day
[1:06:22] of our life
[1:06:23] bringing our humanity under a state
[1:06:26] of mortification this is what leads us
[1:06:29] to do it
[1:06:30] the indwelling presence of god
[1:06:35] you don't need a pastor going around
[1:06:36] with you everywhere you go to keep you
[1:06:38] right
[1:06:39] if you got the holy ghost the holy ghost
[1:06:41] will keep you right
[1:06:43] oh my well your wives don't need to
[1:06:45] follow your husbands around everywhere
[1:06:47] and vice versa
[1:06:48] to make sure they live right and they're
[1:06:49] gonna do right if they've got the holy
[1:06:50] ghost the holy ghost and we'll help them
[1:06:52] do right
[1:06:53] come on saints say amen thus manias are
[1:06:56] led by the spirit of god
[1:06:58] they are the sons of god you see as a
[1:07:01] traveler
[1:07:02] would be led by his guide
[1:07:06] as a traveler would be led by his god
[1:07:09] or a student would be led by his or her
[1:07:12] teacher
[1:07:13] so the spirit of god wants to lead us
[1:07:17] as he teaches us in the realm of
[1:07:20] mortification
[1:07:21] oh hallelujah notice in colossians 3 4
[1:07:24] when christ who
[1:07:25] is our life shall appear then shall ye
[1:07:28] also appear with him in glory
[1:07:32] amen the dead bodies of the saints
[1:07:36] will be raised up i love the way the
[1:07:38] prophet says it this way
[1:07:39] and melchizedek we meet jesus in the air
[1:07:42] before we get home that's right second
[1:07:44] thessalonians tells us that
[1:07:46] we meet him in the our beautiful type of
[1:07:48] rebecca meeting isaac in the field
[1:07:50] in the cool of the day we meet him in
[1:07:52] the air second thessalonians tells us so
[1:07:54] for we which are alive and remain shall
[1:07:56] not prevent or hinder those which are
[1:07:58] asleep
[1:07:59] for the trumpet of god shall sound the
[1:08:02] dead and christ
[1:08:03] shall rise first we which are alive and
[1:08:05] remain shall be called up together with
[1:08:07] them to meet the lord
[1:08:09] in the air perfect all these types
[1:08:12] therefore the theophany if you have died
[1:08:15] and entered
[1:08:16] into that theophany what happens the
[1:08:18] theophany comes to the earth
[1:08:21] to pick up the redeemed body
[1:08:24] and if you're here in the air
[1:08:28] i don't know about you i'm going to have
[1:08:29] to be changed to be able to be suspended
[1:08:31] in the middle of the air waiting for my
[1:08:32] theophany
[1:08:36] oh my if you are here in
[1:08:39] the air my my you take the body
[1:08:43] you take the body you
[1:08:47] take the body who is you the seed of god
[1:08:51] the gene of god that one which has
[1:08:54] amen receive the true baptism of the
[1:08:57] holy ghost
[1:08:58] you it is you why because you're the one
[1:09:01] who mortified it
[1:09:02] it would be you who leads it to match
[1:09:05] the theophany
[1:09:08] don't you understand friends even in the
[1:09:10] rapture god is allowing you
[1:09:14] to bring your body into the final phase
[1:09:17] of mortality you will
[1:09:20] take your body you will not jesus
[1:09:24] not paul taken yours not brother branham
[1:09:26] taking your not peter taking yours but
[1:09:28] you brother larry
[1:09:30] you my brothers and sisters you will
[1:09:32] take your own body
[1:09:34] to meet your theophany
[1:09:44] if you're here in the air you
[1:09:48] take the body to meet the theophany
[1:09:51] there you are and caught up and go
[1:09:55] meet the lord in the air who is this
[1:09:58] melchizedek but god
[1:10:03] colossians 3 5 paul says mortify
[1:10:08] therefore your members
[1:10:11] again not the holy ghost
[1:10:14] but me and you
[1:10:18] mortify let's look at the meaning of
[1:10:21] this word
[1:10:22] the greek word is necro to make dead
[1:10:26] to put to death slay
[1:10:29] worn out deprive
[1:10:32] of power destroy
[1:10:36] the strengths of
[1:10:42] and the holy ghost ain't going to do
[1:10:44] this not by himself
[1:10:49] with the holy ghost using you he will do
[1:10:52] it now we're talking about bride
[1:10:53] material
[1:10:55] i just gave just gave you the definition
[1:10:56] of every member around the world of the
[1:10:58] bride of christ that'll go in the
[1:10:59] rapture
[1:11:01] you see whether the black white red or
[1:11:03] yellow where they go to this church that
[1:11:04] church that won't have one thing to do
[1:11:06] with it
[1:11:06] it will have to do with this right here
[1:11:08] those who brought their bodies under
[1:11:09] mortification
[1:11:10] will change their body to the final
[1:11:12] consummation
[1:11:13] of a body change notice mortified
[1:11:17] therefore
[1:11:17] your members which are upon the earth
[1:11:22] oh my goodness what in the world is he
[1:11:27] doing
[1:11:27] listing these horrible things
[1:11:33] fornication uncleanness inordinate
[1:11:36] affection
[1:11:37] evil concupiscence covetousness
[1:11:40] which is idolatry
[1:11:44] you mean our bodies our
[1:11:47] bodies brother nathan could do
[1:11:52] them awful things
[1:11:58] now all of you angels that are here this
[1:11:59] morning it's pretty warm in this
[1:12:00] building so i'd appreciate a little bit
[1:12:01] of air if y'all want to flutter your
[1:12:03] wings a little bit
[1:12:04] because it's getting awful warm in here
[1:12:06] i think so all you church members just
[1:12:08] flutter your wings and cool it down
[1:12:14] i wonder how many of you have lied this
[1:12:16] week
[1:12:18] [Music]
[1:12:19] i wonder how many your brothers have
[1:12:21] looked at women in a way you shouldn't
[1:12:22] have
[1:12:23] don't raise no hands i don't want no
[1:12:25] divorces going on today
[1:12:28] i wonder how many of you got on facebook
[1:12:30] and flying oh my just flapped your jaws
[1:12:32] about this and that and the other
[1:12:34] i wonder how many of you have been busy
[1:12:35] bodies and other people's matters that
[1:12:37] really don't affect you at all
[1:12:39] preach brother bernie
[1:12:42] so why do we deal with these things
[1:12:45] because of our mortality
[1:12:47] and there's only one way a mortal can
[1:12:49] keep be kept subject
[1:12:51] mortified mortified
[1:12:56] mortify our eyes our ears
[1:12:59] our hands our feet
[1:13:04] praise god
[1:13:08] wow i found this scripture yesterday and
[1:13:11] i'll tell you what it was just
[1:13:12] overwhelming to me first corinthians 9
[1:13:14] 27 but i keep
[1:13:18] under my body
[1:13:22] and bring it into subjection lest by any
[1:13:25] means
[1:13:26] when i have preached to others i myself
[1:13:30] should be a castaway
[1:13:36] now you know in reading paul's writings
[1:13:38] that paul
[1:13:40] used a lot of the greek games
[1:13:43] running the race and the different
[1:13:45] synonyms that he would use
[1:13:47] because he could see a parallel of the
[1:13:50] games
[1:13:51] and how that it was a struggle and
[1:13:54] that'd only be one
[1:13:55] in a certain class that would get the
[1:13:58] the wreath that was planted
[1:14:01] but here paul says a strange word
[1:14:05] and it was like those who boxed
[1:14:10] and wrestled in the olympic games
[1:14:14] look at the word keep to beat
[1:14:18] black and blue oh
[1:14:31] but now most of us deal with our flesh
[1:14:33] with
[1:14:35] rose petals
[1:14:45] when you should be doing this
[1:14:50] ah even you legalists didn't say
[1:14:55] i'm in for it aren't i
[1:15:00] i can you imagine a man filled with the
[1:15:02] holy ghost a church aged messenger and a
[1:15:04] prophet
[1:15:08] that would liken dealing with his
[1:15:10] humanity
[1:15:12] as a man boxing himself
[1:15:18] so he's not standing up you know boxing
[1:15:20] with an opponent
[1:15:22] but he's actually hitting himself
[1:15:25] wham well that was a government ram that
[1:15:27] was a government
[1:15:30] i knocked the breath out of myself
[1:15:35] i died good didn't i'm
[1:15:39] well we'd say there's something mentally
[1:15:40] wrong with a person like that the way we
[1:15:42] look at it there's something mentally
[1:15:43] wrong with the person if they're not
[1:15:44] doing that
[1:15:49] to beat myself black
[1:15:53] and blue
[1:15:56] you see friends to be honest with you
[1:15:58] and make my my job as a pastor a whole
[1:16:00] lot easier
[1:16:01] if you all would do this to yourself
[1:16:02] instead of making me do it
[1:16:14] y'all come in here and sit down and you
[1:16:16] all ain't gotten a bit more bruises in
[1:16:18] this piece of paper right here
[1:16:21] you look like a sack of white lily
[1:16:22] flower
[1:16:26] you're just so prim and proper
[1:16:30] and you're just as white
[1:16:34] now i get up here brother dale gets up
[1:16:35] here some of these other preachers get
[1:16:36] up here
[1:16:37] and go to dragging out that sword and we
[1:16:38] cut your ear off
[1:16:40] we flay your nose we've removed two or
[1:16:42] three of your fingers
[1:16:43] that's just an opening comments
[1:16:49] and then you walk out
[1:16:54] where you been church
[1:16:59] well it must have been bad i got out
[1:17:01] easy you ought to see the rest of them
[1:17:10] notice what paul said
[1:17:14] to be black and blue to smite
[1:17:18] so as to cause bruises and livid spots
[1:17:23] like a boxer one buffets his body
[1:17:27] handled it roughly disciplined by
[1:17:31] hardships
[1:17:32] metaphorically to give one intolerance
[1:17:37] intolerable annoyance
[1:17:40] beat one out wear one out
[1:17:45] buying treaties
[1:17:50] now if you could do this to yourself the
[1:17:53] way you do it to folks on facebook
[1:18:00] we'd have a church on me
[1:18:03] now wait a minute if paul is converted
[1:18:05] and got the holy ghost and now
[1:18:07] remember this is not chapter seven he's
[1:18:10] talking about how he has to still
[1:18:12] treat his life as a mortal brother jim
[1:18:17] i've got to beat it black and blue why
[1:18:19] if it's saved and got the holy ghost
[1:18:22] why is it if there's no faults left in
[1:18:25] this human
[1:18:29] it shows me that the paul
[1:18:32] that he's addressing is like the donny
[1:18:35] i'm addressing
[1:18:36] like the harry like the lance lot the
[1:18:39] carol the barber the janet the whoever
[1:18:41] more
[1:18:43] come on now saints go ahead and say amen
[1:18:48] but i i notice i not the holy ghost
[1:18:52] not the church not the deacons but i
[1:18:56] keep under
[1:19:00] my body and bring
[1:19:04] it into subjection look at the word
[1:19:08] bring
[1:19:09] to lead away to slavery
[1:19:15] claim as one slave
[1:19:19] praise god forget human perfection
[1:19:25] focus on human captivity
[1:19:29] and you bring your body as a slave
[1:19:34] to the spirit of god
[1:19:40] to make a slave and to treat
[1:19:44] as a slave with severity
[1:19:48] subject to stern and rigid
[1:19:53] discipline
[1:19:56] you can see why
[1:19:59] straight is the gate that leads to
[1:20:02] heaven
[1:20:03] and few there be that will find it but
[1:20:06] broad is the way that leads to
[1:20:09] destruction
[1:20:10] and many there be that go in there at
[1:20:13] why they cannot stand personal
[1:20:17] discipline personal your friend
[1:20:20] you understand that a real son of god a
[1:20:22] real daughter of god
[1:20:24] they don't behave righteous and good
[1:20:26] just in the presence of their wife
[1:20:28] or their husband or the pastor or a
[1:20:31] deacon
[1:20:31] they behave the same whether the wife's
[1:20:33] around the deacon's around
[1:20:35] the pastors around why because they have
[1:20:38] something inside of them
[1:20:40] that mortifies their body when they're
[1:20:42] by their self
[1:20:44] they don't flip a switch to
[1:20:45] sanctification stage from the wife
[1:20:47] sitting next to him
[1:20:48] or when the husband is sitting next to
[1:20:50] him but they've got a hallelujah
[1:20:53] a power on the inside that helps them to
[1:20:56] live a sanctified life
[1:20:57] if there ain't nobody within a thousand
[1:21:00] miles they're holy
[1:21:01] they're righteous they're true they're
[1:21:03] pure they're
[1:21:04] born again and they mortify
[1:21:08] by that new birth the deeds
[1:21:12] of their body
[1:21:21] so paul in capturing this thought
[1:21:26] uses the athlete
[1:21:30] and the associate must be disciplined
[1:21:34] to win the prize
[1:21:38] he must watch what he eats
[1:21:41] he must watch how many hours he stays up
[1:21:43] at night even
[1:21:45] though other people may come around oh
[1:21:47] man look at this boston cream pie look
[1:21:49] at this
[1:21:49] upside down pineapple cake man look at
[1:21:53] all these high carbs it's that another
[1:21:55] oh don't you want it why of course he
[1:21:56] wants it
[1:21:58] but he wants to prize more because he
[1:22:01] knows too many carbs and this and that
[1:22:03] and the other can work on his
[1:22:04] performance you're preaching with me
[1:22:06] oh you'd be lying to say i don't want
[1:22:08] that at all sure he wants it
[1:22:10] he wants it just as bad or maybe more so
[1:22:12] than you do because you had it yesterday
[1:22:15] he ain't had it in a month why because
[1:22:17] he disciplines himself
[1:22:18] you think he likes him when he has to
[1:22:20] get out there and run in the white rain
[1:22:21] and run in the snow
[1:22:23] and running the whim whenever you're
[1:22:24] piled up in the bed at a quarter after
[1:22:26] five of course he don't
[1:22:27] but he wants what he wants the price you
[1:22:30] think our
[1:22:31] mortality wants all of these things of
[1:22:34] course it does not
[1:22:35] but we want the prize
[1:22:38] i don't want to just come to the gates
[1:22:40] and say i barely made it
[1:22:41] i want to please my lord my prize my
[1:22:45] brother sister
[1:22:46] is hearing my lord jesus say well done
[1:22:49] thou good and faithful servant well done
[1:22:53] i'll give up the world i'll give up the
[1:22:55] things of the world
[1:22:56] i will discipline myself to get the
[1:23:04] prize
[1:23:09] you see discipline
[1:23:13] does not necessarily mean just giving up
[1:23:15] the bad
[1:23:17] discipline means giving up the good
[1:23:21] the better for the best
[1:23:29] it don't just mean giving up the
[1:23:31] horrible and the terrible
[1:23:33] it means giving up the good the better
[1:23:37] for the best
[1:23:41] hallelujah the athlete must watch what
[1:23:45] he eats must watch his time
[1:23:50] his mind his concentration
[1:23:54] that's why you need to watch what you
[1:23:55] feed on spiritually
[1:23:58] i talk about your hamburgers and you
[1:23:59] taters and your maters and all that sort
[1:24:00] of thing i'm talking about what you feed
[1:24:03] on
[1:24:04] now look here paul said i disciplined
[1:24:08] myself in this way lest
[1:24:09] while i preached to others i would be a
[1:24:14] castaway
[1:24:18] you see paul believed in eternal
[1:24:19] security he's not saying that he
[1:24:22] thought he'd be lost again he's using
[1:24:24] the same term
[1:24:26] in the games that he would lose the
[1:24:29] prize
[1:24:31] and get no reward
[1:24:36] so there was a herald let me bring you
[1:24:39] this way this is history
[1:24:40] a herald who announced the rules of the
[1:24:42] contest
[1:24:43] the names of the contestants and the
[1:24:46] names and cities of the winners
[1:24:48] he would also announce the names of any
[1:24:51] contestants
[1:24:53] who were qualified so paul saw himself
[1:24:57] as a herald
[1:24:59] but he also saw himself as a contestant
[1:25:02] he saw himself as announcing the evil he
[1:25:05] saw himself as announcing the good
[1:25:08] and he also announced those who are
[1:25:10] going to win and those who are going to
[1:25:12] lose
[1:25:14] but he said after i've done all that i
[1:25:17] don't want to come up myself
[1:25:19] and actually the word there was be
[1:25:21] disqualified
[1:25:24] right don't we hear it about in american
[1:25:26] sports
[1:25:27] and other sports where they take
[1:25:29] enhancing drugs to do this and that and
[1:25:31] the other
[1:25:33] in horse races so the horse that wins
[1:25:35] they want to take him back to the stable
[1:25:37] and let them draw blood
[1:25:39] and make sure they didn't give him some
[1:25:40] type of enhancing drug
[1:25:43] oh my paul said i don't want to go
[1:25:46] over this and labor i don't want to be
[1:25:49] tossed out at night and no
[1:25:50] sleep and and no food and being
[1:25:53] downtrodden and cast out
[1:25:55] and then come to the end of it and my
[1:25:58] reward be taken from me
[1:26:00] and i would be a castaway find
[1:26:03] myself disqualified
[1:26:09] don't you understand what the church is
[1:26:11] going to find out in the morning of the
[1:26:12] rapture
[1:26:14] don't you see what even folks have said
[1:26:16] around this message are going to
[1:26:18] realize they have been disqualified
[1:26:25] to be in the rapture
[1:26:31] oh my let me read one more can i
[1:26:35] galatians 5 24 and they
[1:26:39] that are christ's now this is possessive
[1:26:44] the christ owns them and possesses them
[1:26:47] they're not that by an external
[1:26:49] profession only
[1:26:51] but by an internal implantation
[1:26:54] of a divine deposit of the faith of the
[1:26:57] son of god
[1:26:58] for the life that i live i no longer
[1:27:00] live it by myself
[1:27:02] but i live it by the faith not in but of
[1:27:06] the son of god they that
[1:27:09] are christ's notice what he said they
[1:27:11] that are christ
[1:27:12] have not christ crucified the flesh
[1:27:16] but they your very large friends
[1:27:20] is a symbol that you're a christian all
[1:27:23] to say that people are christian today
[1:27:25] they smoke they drink they have how many
[1:27:27] ever wives and husbands and boyfriends
[1:27:29] and girlfriends
[1:27:30] they live any way they want to and yet
[1:27:32] claim they're a christian to means you
[1:27:34] are a christian
[1:27:35] it means you are christ-like what did
[1:27:39] they call them in the early days
[1:27:40] when they called him a christian they
[1:27:42] were first called christians and any
[1:27:44] it was not a descriptive term of great
[1:27:46] describing of great
[1:27:47] praise and adoration it was a name that
[1:27:50] was cast out
[1:27:51] they call them crossbacks because they
[1:27:55] carry crosses on the back well i don't
[1:27:57] have one on my back
[1:27:58] but i've got one in my life
[1:28:03] they that are christ's
[1:28:06] have crucified so here you are
[1:28:11] your soul your soul
[1:28:16] is telling your body cattle on the cross
[1:28:22] your soul has led your body down the via
[1:28:26] dela rosa
[1:28:29] you have beat it every step of the way
[1:28:34] your body fell and got weak
[1:28:38] and again he said here and pained
[1:28:43] but your soul had no pity
[1:28:47] your soul marched it up the hill
[1:28:52] in the place of the skull your mind
[1:28:57] there your soul said to your body
[1:29:00] climb on the cross
[1:29:06] and you're stole your soul stood there
[1:29:08] as your body
[1:29:09] shaking and
[1:29:14] it called its way up on the cross
[1:29:19] [Laughter]
[1:29:23] and it lay it down and your soul
[1:29:28] took the hammer and the nail
[1:29:32] oh don't please
[1:29:37] [Music]
[1:29:42] again and again
[1:29:49] then it laid the other hand out shaking
[1:29:52] and quivering
[1:29:55] your flesh screamed
[1:30:01] and you drove both feet
[1:30:05] one on top of the other
[1:30:09] then you picked it up
[1:30:16] and you said you stay there
[1:30:23] don't you ever come down
[1:30:28] you understand that the romans were not
[1:30:31] the first ones
[1:30:32] to crucify the carthagins many others
[1:30:36] did but the romans brought it to a stage
[1:30:39] of perfection the romans assigned a
[1:30:40] guard
[1:30:41] with a centurion that would stay there
[1:30:44] to watch the crucified
[1:30:47] because actually what would happen
[1:30:48] before they did this
[1:30:51] say one of you men was crucified and the
[1:30:53] romans would leave you there
[1:30:54] your family would come and pull you off
[1:30:56] the cross
[1:30:57] and you would live you see crucifixion
[1:31:01] is not necessarily an instant death
[1:31:03] every year in the philippines
[1:31:06] there are people who get crucified
[1:31:10] i saw a documentary not long ago of a
[1:31:12] man that's been crucified 15 years
[1:31:14] in a row
[1:31:17] nails drove through his hands nails
[1:31:19] jolts or his feet
[1:31:21] and he hangs there from the morning to
[1:31:22] the afternoon
[1:31:25] by the afternoon they take him down off
[1:31:27] the cross and he's done this
[1:31:29] for 15 years in a row
[1:31:32] revival after revival
[1:31:36] youth camp after youth camp oh god i
[1:31:40] promise i promise god our brothers are
[1:31:44] but you've got to have a guard or a
[1:31:45] pastor
[1:31:47] [Applause]
[1:31:51] hallelujah when you go to drag hunt out
[1:31:55] that claw hammer out of your tool pat
[1:31:57] ready to remove them nails the pastor
[1:32:00] said i had
[1:32:02] put that back oh
[1:32:06] sorry so that's all i packed mine there
[1:32:09] too and i've learned how to crucify my
[1:32:12] you think i want to die
[1:32:16] you think i love being a laughing stock
[1:32:19] around the world do you think i love
[1:32:20] my name being ridiculed
[1:32:24] you think i love being one of the most
[1:32:26] ridiculed and lifetime preachers in the
[1:32:28] message
[1:32:29] you think i enjoy that
[1:32:35] i have to die to myself every video i
[1:32:39] see with my name on it
[1:32:42] every letter every email
[1:32:47] because i think why me why do i have to
[1:32:50] deal with a whole fest
[1:32:53] i want to drag up my glow hammer and
[1:32:56] pull these nails
[1:32:58] out of my hands and throw them as far as
[1:33:01] i can throw them
[1:33:05] and never look back
[1:33:11] but my soul says
[1:33:17] my soul is threatened to get rid of that
[1:33:18] claw hammer and give me a ball pen
[1:33:21] which has no claws
[1:33:30] let's stand now that y'all i've left you
[1:33:34] suspended right
[1:33:36] some of y'all's got one arm in and one
[1:33:38] arm out and you're
[1:33:41] think of it friends
[1:33:48] they that are christ have crucified
[1:33:53] isn't it amazing that paul says they
[1:33:56] have done it
[1:33:58] it's no wonder that when the prophet of
[1:34:02] god
[1:34:04] it was carried there beyond the curtain
[1:34:06] of time
[1:34:08] even when the prophecy was given to him
[1:34:12] a huge portion of heaven
[1:34:16] awaits you why because of his choice
[1:34:22] his choice
[1:34:25] can you imagine how your body will be
[1:34:29] on that day of the change when finally
[1:34:33] you're able to pull the nails out
[1:34:36] for the last time and your body will be
[1:34:40] pulled down
[1:34:42] off of the cross your soul
[1:34:46] would have led your body into eternal
[1:34:48] eyes
[1:34:49] eternal lips eternal teeth
[1:34:54] eternal bones eternal hands
[1:34:57] eternal feet
[1:35:00] the same body that nailed it to the
[1:35:03] cross
[1:35:04] will lead it to the theophany and say
[1:35:07] i'd like to introduce you to
[1:35:12] yourself
[1:35:24] you see to be a christian is what this
[1:35:26] embraces
[1:35:27] to show conformity to our crucified lord
[1:35:31] jesus
[1:35:32] who died a death of shame humiliation
[1:35:37] and pain remember the cross was barely
[1:35:41] erased
[1:35:42] off the ground so people on the ground
[1:35:43] would come by and smack them
[1:35:46] as i mentioned it to you a week or so
[1:35:47] ago actually the jackals and the coyotes
[1:35:50] would tear the skin off of their legs
[1:35:52] tear the skin off their feet the birds
[1:35:55] would eat their eyes out
[1:35:56] and they're still alive they would hang
[1:35:59] there for days
[1:36:01] the longest one so far that i've been
[1:36:02] able to find historically is about 18
[1:36:04] days can you imagine
[1:36:06] gang green sets in the body gangrene
[1:36:10] your own body rottening
[1:36:14] and they've got somebody there garden
[1:36:16] let your family come and take you down
[1:36:22] we would be deserving of such a death
[1:36:25] but this holy righteous one
[1:36:28] not only subjected himself to mortality
[1:36:31] but subjected himself to this kind of
[1:36:33] death you see the lord jesus went
[1:36:34] through more
[1:36:36] than most people ever go through life
[1:36:38] and death just getting to the cross
[1:36:41] much less the cross then the sins of all
[1:36:45] the world
[1:36:47] placed on him that horrible pain and
[1:36:49] suffering
[1:36:50] of the transfer of our sins spirit god
[1:36:54] the angels the cherubims the seraphims
[1:36:57] the zunes
[1:36:59] all the heavenly beings turning their
[1:37:01] back as it was
[1:37:03] and him saying my god my god
[1:37:08] why hast thou forsaken me
[1:37:13] hallelujah why
[1:37:17] so you could stand here today and hang
[1:37:20] your body on a cross
[1:37:21] when your body would say to you why have
[1:37:24] you forsaken me you'll have to say
[1:37:25] cause i love you if i listen to you
[1:37:29] you'll take me to hell
[1:37:31] if you listen to me i'll take you to
[1:37:33] heaven
[1:37:37] is that right in his time
[1:37:41] when mortification is setting in
[1:37:45] when his body is so shaking and
[1:37:49] quivering with pain while he's on the
[1:37:51] cross
[1:37:53] but a man also on the cross
[1:37:57] lord when you come into your kingdom
[1:38:02] remember me
[1:38:05] most of us would not even categorize
[1:38:07] that as a prayer of repentance
[1:38:10] he doesn't mention any wrongs he's done
[1:38:13] he doesn't say i'm a sinner
[1:38:15] he doesn't say i've drunk i've run
[1:38:16] around i've done this i've done that
[1:38:18] i've done that he don't even say nothing
[1:38:20] like that
[1:38:22] but he acknowledges what it takes to get
[1:38:24] in
[1:38:26] you're the king remember me
[1:38:32] can you imagine the lord jesus and all
[1:38:34] that agony and pain looks to him and
[1:38:36] said
[1:38:38] today you will be with me
[1:38:42] in paradise
[1:38:47] oh i'd love to been there for just a few
[1:38:49] moments
[1:38:51] when him and jesus arrive
[1:38:54] there was abraham isaac jacob joseph
[1:38:56] ezekiel jeremiah zephaniah got malachi
[1:38:59] thousands times thousands there
[1:39:03] and this man comes and said who are you
[1:39:06] how did you get here
[1:39:08] it happened just a few moments ago
[1:39:12] what was your prophet i was a thief
[1:39:15] was you're a good man i died because of
[1:39:18] my sins
[1:39:21] but i realized that man on the cross
[1:39:26] was the way to life
[1:39:30] praise god thank you lord jesus
[1:39:36] friends we don't want church hannity
[1:39:40] we don't want religion
[1:39:43] we want new births
[1:39:46] no birth and a surrendered life
[1:39:50] that comes in conformity with that new
[1:39:53] birthday amen
[1:39:55] come with our heads together brother
[1:39:57] gary has a friend he wants us to pray
[1:39:59] for rick culler
[1:40:01] his family's been called to the hospital
[1:40:05] virus and very critical how many of you
[1:40:08] today
[1:40:09] would like to be remembered before the
[1:40:11] lord
[1:40:12] maybe not sickness in your body you'd
[1:40:15] like to be more of a surrendered person
[1:40:17] to the lord
[1:40:19] i'll raise my hands both of them
[1:40:24] lord jesus
[1:40:27] thank you for the service today i know
[1:40:28] it's not one to make a shout
[1:40:30] but if we'll get it we'll shout after a
[1:40:33] while
[1:40:34] ain't no question about it if we can
[1:40:37] apply this to our lives and live by it
[1:40:39] every day
[1:40:40] we will shout through the ceaseless ages
[1:40:42] of eternity
[1:40:45] oh we like deeper things better we like
[1:40:48] other things better that make us feel
[1:40:50] good
[1:40:52] but it wasn't lord jesus those things
[1:40:56] that make the flesh feel good that paid
[1:40:59] my redemption
[1:41:01] it was your pain you're suffering
[1:41:05] oh lord god i thank you for it emptying
[1:41:09] yourself out
[1:41:11] letting satan by the be of death
[1:41:15] strike your body
[1:41:19] you become a curse for us all
[1:41:22] for it is written cursed is everyone
[1:41:24] that hang us on a tree
[1:41:27] thank you lord jesus but we are so glad
[1:41:31] you didn't just die but you raised from
[1:41:34] the dead
[1:41:37] praise god and you were raised for our
[1:41:40] justification
[1:41:42] father help us we realize this is not
[1:41:47] something that happens instantaneously
[1:41:50] as the new person with that nature of
[1:41:53] the world the world in nature we were
[1:41:55] born with in the soul
[1:41:58] whenever you get it
[1:42:01] to the altar and the pillar of fire
[1:42:05] breaks on that nature
[1:42:08] it destroys it your prophet projects it
[1:42:11] so beautifully and you must be born
[1:42:12] again in 1961
[1:42:14] that the judgment of god the wrath of
[1:42:16] god
[1:42:18] falls on that nature
[1:42:21] it's annihilated
[1:42:25] and that little seed germ which was part
[1:42:28] of the father's thinking
[1:42:30] the father's gene it sprang to life
[1:42:35] at the death of that old man
[1:42:39] so we're not forgiven we're justified
[1:42:45] that oh life and forgiven that old
[1:42:46] nature ain't forgiven has saint there is
[1:42:48] no scripture in the entire canon of the
[1:42:50] bible
[1:42:51] that says that old life ever is
[1:42:54] sanctified
[1:42:55] our battle life is refurbished
[1:43:00] but the old man died
[1:43:04] praise god and we were born again
[1:43:09] thank you lord jesus
[1:43:12] help us i pray father
[1:43:15] lord you see the time we're in
[1:43:18] father we can feel it we can feel it
[1:43:21] around us we can see it
[1:43:24] lord i saw pictures of it today even in
[1:43:26] some of our cities they're
[1:43:28] boarding up windows and boarding up
[1:43:30] stores
[1:43:32] boarding up residences and
[1:43:35] some of these movie stars and
[1:43:38] millionaires hiring
[1:43:40] security services to come and patrol
[1:43:42] their properties
[1:43:44] because they're expecting such things in
[1:43:47] the time of the election
[1:43:49] who would have ever thought that our
[1:43:51] nation supposedly
[1:43:53] the home of the free the land of the
[1:43:55] brave and the home of the free
[1:43:57] and even men sitting right here today
[1:44:00] that risked their life to buy us this
[1:44:02] freedom
[1:44:04] lord where will we come to because we
[1:44:06] left you
[1:44:07] out this is where we are
[1:44:12] oh god i pray that you'll help us watch
[1:44:14] over your children lord
[1:44:17] mayhem we know will rain one day
[1:44:20] but lord jesus we ask that you be
[1:44:22] mindful of your bride
[1:44:25] help us lord god that we can live the
[1:44:27] kind of life that's pleasing to you
[1:44:29] every day lord jesus we're not waiting
[1:44:31] for some special speaker to come
[1:44:34] we're not waiting for some special
[1:44:35] meeting to come and then we're going to
[1:44:37] get
[1:44:37] some type of miraculous prayer
[1:44:41] but father we want to begin today
[1:44:44] that we are the kind of christians you
[1:44:46] want us to be
[1:44:48] we're sorry for laying all of it at your
[1:44:50] door and saying you have to do it
[1:44:52] surely they see it lord after these
[1:44:54] scriptures today
[1:44:56] it's you and us working together
[1:44:59] to bring it to pass it's really a marvel
[1:45:03] because
[1:45:03] you don't need our help in dealing with
[1:45:06] the soul just our consent that's all
[1:45:08] you don't really ask for help so you by
[1:45:11] the pillar of fire
[1:45:12] devour the nature that's there and it
[1:45:15] dies
[1:45:16] you birth your own seed your own son or
[1:45:19] daughter
[1:45:20] we're birthed by the breath of god the
[1:45:22] holy ghost
[1:45:24] but then you incorporate us in that
[1:45:26] everyday life
[1:45:27] of surrendering so when people hurt our
[1:45:29] feelings or people
[1:45:31] offend us over and over again our flesh
[1:45:33] wants to act back lord we want to get
[1:45:34] even with them we want to say this or
[1:45:36] that the other or do this or that or the
[1:45:37] other
[1:45:38] but the soul says father forgive them
[1:45:41] for they don't know what they're doing
[1:45:44] lord i ain't just talking about people
[1:45:45] running around smoking committing
[1:45:47] adultery
[1:45:48] i'm just talking everyday stuff having a
[1:45:50] nice
[1:45:51] word and in the place of a of a bad foul
[1:45:54] word or
[1:45:55] a rough word just everyday kind of life
[1:45:58] lord
[1:45:59] that's what we want to be just everyday
[1:46:02] christians
[1:46:04] help us today father in the name of
[1:46:07] jesus
[1:46:10] praise god you love him saints with all
[1:46:13] your hearts
[1:46:16] what do you say we have an invisible
[1:46:18] altar call this morning
[1:46:21] now no doubt many of you in the past
[1:46:22] have laid your cigarettes as it were on
[1:46:25] the altar and you
[1:46:26] you've laid your worldly music on the
[1:46:28] altar
[1:46:29] some of you laid your pornographic
[1:46:31] websites on the altar
[1:46:34] i say today that we all beginning with
[1:46:36] me
[1:46:38] take our claw hammer or our pry bar
[1:46:42] or our crowbar we lay our ability to
[1:46:45] remove
[1:46:46] these nails out of our hands on the
[1:46:48] altar of god and say god by your help
[1:46:50] and grace
[1:46:52] i will never try to free myself again
[1:46:55] look friends you might as well like some
[1:46:56] of the things you deal with in life at
[1:46:58] your cross
[1:46:59] some of your burdens some of your family
[1:47:00] some of the things you have to do
[1:47:02] some of the things you have to put up
[1:47:03] with you'll never pray it away
[1:47:06] but you can pray god will give you grace
[1:47:08] and strength
[1:47:09] to be able to bear it and sometimes we
[1:47:12] don't bury it well when we're
[1:47:13] complaining
[1:47:14] and grumbling we lose the value of our
[1:47:18] cross
[1:47:19] when we grumble about it every day
[1:47:23] how many needs help with it me too
[1:47:27] so what you say let's just lay our claw
[1:47:29] hammers at the altar
[1:47:31] let's lay our grumbling attitude as the
[1:47:34] altar
