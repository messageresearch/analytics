did it a couple times lately and be honest I don't remember what key what the key was [Music] but I'm so glad that this voice that speaks to you is a piece of Kentucky dirt and I am such a blessed piece of Kentucky dirt because in my soul is a thought that came from eternity that's somehow someday is going to get to be in eternity with a body from this Earth and I don't know if it's any chemicals elements left of this 16 elements that came from Kentucky but today as a hillbilly I'm a very blessed man I feel like on the back bony of space step to pure and holy God and an awesome Solitude he stood alone I think I messed up let's do it inde D Brothers I'm sorry on a balcony of space step to pure and holy God and in awesome Solitude he stood alone not one faint star to give him light just endless rolling Blackest Night but somehow through all the darkness he could see he saw mountains high and lofty he saw vales Lush and green babbling Brooks and wild flowers growing even heard a robin sing but he fell to strange compassion as close to love as pain could be standing out there in tomorrow he saw me he saw me in his likeness he saw me like him Pure Clean and holy spotless white Within but he saw me Bound in heavy chains and long to set me free but he knew if I became like him he must become like like me so Jus paid it all all to him I ow sin had left me CRM Sun [Music] [Applause] stain but he was me white as snow sing that course Jus paid it all all to him I ow sin had left me Crimson Stain but he Wash Me wide as snow thank you Lord oh Jesus Paid it all all to him I ow sin had left us Crimson Stain but he was [Music] me let's sing that again can what a mirror [Applause] Jesus PA it all all to to him I thank you Lord s had left us Crimson Stain but he was [Music] W as SM Hallelujah dear God through the ceaseless ages we will be praising you for that we've seen many miracles that you've done you healed cancer straight out crooked eyes fixed torn up marriages but I wonder if we realize yet to this day one of the greatest Miracles we will see is a sinner Changed by the power of God thank you Lord we love you so much thank you for your Miracle working power in us today Lord Jesus speak to us from your word father we ask in the name of Jesus praise the Lord isn't he wonderful praise God well if you're changed today by his power you are a miracle yourself amen truly to think of what God can do to be able to transform sinners and change them into accepted people in God's presence it's a wonderful thing turn with me to Luke chapter 9 verse 23 if you would today I've got a few announcements question answers again on Thursday um 7:00 and also we've been trying to plan for a a communion service here in our new place and um we're looking at June the 1st which will be on a Saturday night we'll probably start the service maybe about 6:00 so we can be able to have service and then communion and then everybody be back for Sunday and I've asked brother Daryl if you'll preach for us on that service that'll be June the 1st also of course I'd like to wish all the mothers of Happy Happy Mother's Day to each one of your mothers God bless you thank you for your your of sacrifice and raising your children and trying to influence them in a in a Godly way I've been speaking to you on the the bride's Bill of Rights and um I want to speak to you today on another one of those rights and it's the right to Die daily the right to Die daily I'm not sure if you understand it yet or not but actually the right to Die daily is such an awesome right because you realize everybody out here cannot do that there's only one class of people that can actually Die daily that's those who've already died and then were raised in a new body something in their soul quickened and there's another man or woman inside of you we can't see it now but there's someone inside of us that's being formed as we're feeding on the word it's like a body and a body it's a soul and a body and as you're feeding and maturing on the word that something inside of you is growing started from a little thing about the size of a button on your shirt growing into what God wants to be that's an awesome thing a it Luke 9: 23 and he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross How often daily and follow me so each one must deny himself that is not think about about his own good well I like I want this is the way my life's going to be I choose I want I decide I this that but he must take up his cross him or her daily and follow the lord Jesus you say but brother Donnie what all does that involve really it's quite simple it's not complicated at all it is that you admit that the one who has called you and what he allows you to go through and what allows you to be Tried by that you'll take that cross on a daily basis and admit that he is right and letting you bear it it may change from one day to the other but if you have that attitude no matter what you face you'll always be bearing a cross and we must follow Jesus unto death which in this case is daily death for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and you realize this is where the leodan church is doing every day they're saving their life preserving their desires their Ambitions their goals they preserve it so Jesus says whosoever shall will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake in other words you give it up for him him the same shall save it it's actually odd people look at us and think y'all are losing so much actually we're saving so much and they think they're saving so much but they're actually losing so much so you actually save by loss and you lose by saving a't that peculiar you see this is why it's so odd even today among Christian churches whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it now we're not talking about being a martyr now Jesus is not talking about going to Mar them he just set up this precedent that you will give yourself every day on your cross so every day you give that you're saving your life for what is a man advant aged if he gained the whole world and lose himself lose himself so a life lived for self is an absolute guarantee you will lose yourself there's only one way to make sure that we won't be lost and that is we commit our life into the only one who can save us amen and may want that with all your heart can we just pray together again over the word and I've got some prayer calls here that the Lord knows what they what they need father once again we bow our heads before we begin to speak and I pray that you would take each of our hearts today make our hearts fertile ground Lord that the word seed can be able to go down deep and bring forth an abundance of the crop of the end time we believe we have the moisture the Holy Spirit we believe we have the seed which is the word we believe we have the light which is the light shining in the last days so there's no reason that it will not produce a great crop that'll be pleasing to you all the elements are here if we can just obey them in the right way father you see these prayer calls Lord you know these needs I'm asking you in the name of Jesus be mindful of them Father help me today Lord to be able to get out of the way speak to each one of our hearts we ask in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated I've got it be honest there's an ele element about the soul which I find mysterious we've never seen our souls of course and we've never seen our spirit all we've known about each other is is the body that's what we Conta but yet we also can see by the attributes of the life that's in every one of us that there's something there that influences us something that sets us in a certain pattern in a certain way we believe it's a supernatural element which of course we call the soul when we were born into this world we were born with a lost soul as we say it a nature which was not regenerated a nature which God never intended for us to have what Adam did that day whenever he forfeited his rights he also forfeited yours your right to health you were supposed to have the right to live in the Garden of Eden never have one gray hair in your head none of us would ever experience deaths sickness pain sorrow so when Adam forfeited his right he forfeited mine he forfeited yours so there must be a second Adam that will come and reconcile us back into the presence of God and yet when we're born from that time on the first two B boys born outside the garden gate there was a need to come before the presence of God to try to make peace to make reconciliation to where you could be accepted in his presence we just been looking at at both Cain and Abel and how that one was right and the other one wasn't and since that time man is still on this Quest this search to all the religions are in the world today so a Founder gets some sort of idea that he feels like this would be the right way so you've got to find the proper zen zen so you've got to be able to find the right Zen or you've got to get into the the thing of meditation and you begin to get in so far and you know you let go of this and you let go of that if I did that long I'd be asleep myself I don't know about you uh but but the reason that all of these religions they're out there is because there's something in man that he's searching for something and I hope you understand that actually the soul of man that's lost tends to be religious so it even though he's lost it doesn't mean that he doesn't have an inclination towards some sort of religion but most of them will will accept something that is contrary of course to God's way of reconciliation and God's way is that the the nature that we were born with must be changed the soul has to be different and how will that Soul ever be different what can God do to ever bring that sinful nature to a spot now for some even in Christianity they believe that that nature then will come to God and you will repent and you will go to an alter maybe come and shake the preacher's hand and God will go inside of you and God will change that soul that soul will be different it'll be the same one but somehow you went in to that presence of God and you come out a different person changed and then you will struggle basically the rest of your life to try to please God you'll fall you'll make mistakes of course the way most of them preach it you cannot live above sin ever live above it but is that really true is that really God's way of looking at it or is that man's way of looking at it so is the sinful nature actually brought into the presence of God and then the sinful nature is somehow changed and then that's what we classify as the new birth but is that really the truth or is there to be a death an absolute death yes sir and an Annihilation and then there will be some something reborn but will it be that old nature or will it be something that father himself deposited there which Mom and Daddy of course couldn't give you the sinful nature can only die once but to the flesh We Must Die daily amen I I believe that even for some of you you that are truly born again and filled with the Holy Ghost there's something in you that longs every day that you're on this Earth no matter how close you are to God and how much Holy Ghost you've got it's like there's something in you you're never satisfied with what you've got how many feels that way and if you're not careful the devil will try to convince you when you hear somebody preaching about the Holy Ghost and the token and you know you want to make sure that you've got it if you're not careful the devil will try to convince you that you don't have it because there's a longing in you but it's not that you're longing to be born you're longing for more of the payments of what he gave you initially and Satan will convince many people and if he can do that it stops us from coming to the fullness of our position read with me if you would here in the in the Hebrews where the prophet deals with this about the nature and he said your old nature died the nature of the world and you become a new creation and your desires that old life that had a beginning when God breathe the breath of life into your nostrils when you were born now listen to what happened when you were born so that old life that had a beginning when God breathes the breast of life into your no so that old nature had a beginning so when God breathes a breath of life into every one of us then that old nature had a beginning and it had an end Now list at the difference the way a prophet preaches the new birth than the way most Christians believe it that we were born when we took the breath of life is just a small small infant the Midwife the doctor spanked you and you took the Breath of Life God gave you the breath of life then that nature that was there had a beginning but it must also have an end now he says and it died and was done away away with forever so that old nature is not born again you see if Satan can't stop you from believing in the new births he'll try to mess up your perception of what it truly is and then you will come and you'll say well I I I'll give God this and then God will take it and and God will reverse that the the nature will be more like a it'll be like a phoenix that will happen to that own nature and that's why people keep on sinning after they say they're born again because actually that old nature never died but they did quit doing some things and they started maybe going to church they started reading the Bible which they' never done before maybe they had some religious inclinations and things they started doing but I want you to notice how a prophet brings this now so when God breathed into the breaths of life into your Noles when you were born that life of that carnal nature died it had a beginning and it had an end and it died and was done away with forever the old nature and God came in with the new nature so notice in the old nature dies and God comes in with a new nature now with everybody that says they are a Christian and said they were born again if this happened to them how could they ever go back to a life of sin amen Carol and I were talking just this week about about the conditions of time and what a state the world is in and what a state that many so-called Christians are in and while we were talking about it the spirit of God just moved right over me while while we were there and he spoke these words out of my mouth it overwhelmed me when it happened and I told her I said what the majority of people are is they are christless Christians remember car christless brother Jim it just about overwhelmed me christless Christians what a deception that a person would be a christless Christian yes so what are they Christian by name and by title I want you to listen now how the prophet when he goes in into this and he said it died and was done away with forever that on nature and God came in with the new nature again he says every man's got to be born again this sinful nature killed in him I want you to listen to this new birth blue John and a new man born in him which is Christ Jesus am the Son of God now you see this new birth is a Christ full Christian not a christless Christian so look what Satan wants to do he wants to convince people then they give their life to the Lord the Lord comes in modifies changes red does you know refurbishes that old nature can you see why he would want them to have that instead of this so you get modified a little you get changed a little you get religious you get you know something that actually makes you a better person and you go to feeling better and you think wow I I'm really different this is awesome and you think that's what What It Takes no Satan is deceiving Millions by change happening to them which they think is a new Burst when actually the new birst is your own nature dying and the man Christ Jesus being born in you I don't care how good you would ever be you'll never be able to compare to Christ Jesus in you no matter how good I'd ever be any of us we are lost and were born with that poor decrepit nature is that right now listen this to me I I just find this so awesome every man's got to be born again this sinful nature killed in him and a new man born in him which is Christ Jesus the Son of God then you surrender yourself completely to Christ Christ comes in and writes a book of Acts through you if is that awesome or what praise God it ain't no wonder that don't want this to happen it's no wonder that he wants to mess with theologians thinking and they would preach the new birth in an opposite way from what I just read to you because what will it produce in the majority it will produce christless Christians but if we can come by this process here that then every man that is born in order to be born again his old nature the sinful nature the prophet said killed in him and a new man born in him which is Christ Jesus notice again he says and you must be born again our nature to begin with is sinful to start with we're no good can anybody say Amen to that we are no good question and answers 1961 so the soul is the nature of your spirit now notice what you were when you were born so your soul was the nature that was on your spirit so you got a soul a spirit and a body first you were mean and evil and hatred and Malice and strife now now you're loving sweet kind see the difference it's your nature we could all call it that it's your soul that's been changed now listen carefully don't take the word change and go back to your concept of what you think the new birth is it's been changed change but notice how he describes what happened in the change the old soul died so it got changed not that the old nature was changed into the new right amen but it died and God put his soul in you Chang it out not Chang it from Lost to save not change it from bad to good but got rid of it he changed it and put himself inside of praise be to God the old soul died I know people get scared to death and you go to reading this quot look when God called me to preach this message he called me to PR preach at all I'm not afraid of none of these quotes I'm not scared because people went this way and went that way and that way that's only a scarecrow to keep you an eye away from the truths that's right scarecrow shouldn't work on Eagles just crows notice the old soul died and the new Soul which is the new nature Was Born Into You right the old soul died and the new Soul which is the new nature don't you understand what the new birth is the new birth is the new nature which is born in you that's your birth so your birth isn't I've done this and i' done that and you done that and you done that no not what you done anyway the birst Oh Glory to God the birst was him being born in us don't you to understand what the new birth is it's not while I run I jump I shouted I spoke in tongues you may do all of that but yet the new birth is him being born in you a new praise be to God the old soul died and the new Soul which is the new nature Was Born Into You Now whatever that happens in so how can we make sense out of what Jesus says in our opening scripture that we must take up our cross daily H how can we die once and then turn right around and have to die every day thereafter because once we are born again then that nature can never die again there is no resurrection and you know brother brandham said it several times ever he referred to it and said well you know brother brandham I had the Holy Ghost and I was born again and this and that but you know the the devil the devil made me to it made me do it he said no the devil didn't make you do it you just wasn't sealed in now let me tell you something now the devil can can not make a holy ghost feel child of God do one thing wrong never he does not have power over you the only way the devil can make you do things that are wrong is that you are demon possessed W brother Donnie what about my mistakes he don't make make you do them you choose to do them come on somebody say Amen once you and I are born again the devil has no more power over our soul because our soul is a gene of God and Christ himself is born a new in our own nature and he cannot make the Lord Jesus sin I wish somebody would preach with me this morning it's not you and I it's not our determination it's not our strength glory to God I grabbed a hold of the horns of the altar i' done this and i' done that oh come on you ain't nothing but a weakling you ain't nothing but a Lost Sinner when you come to God it wasn't you that grabbed a hold of the horns of the elders it's more like God grabbed a hold of your horns and Drug you up to the Altar and made you willing to die and when you were able to do that that old nature died right there and Christ Jesus was born again in you once that happens it is an impossibility for it to ever happen again don't you see what a miracle you are that are sitting here today that are truly born again you will never be able to be anything else other than born again no matter how old you get how how sick you get how many problems you have no matter what goes on you will never ever be able to revert back to being a sinner again because there is no more Fallen nature for you as a son or daughter of God and you all are looking for miracles why don't you look around at somebody you're looking at one look up this way you're looking at another I'm looking out here looking at hundreds of Miracles lives that have been changed of previous Sinners that's why I say well I'm just an old sinner saved by grace no I'm not I was an old sinner but I ain't one no more I am not a person that's living a life of sin come on children I don't believe we as Sons and Daughters of God had to live under the Dominion of the devil as a matter of fact I want to say to hell today I was born I was born ordained of God to torment the devil I was ordained of God to torment hell every son and daughter of God was ordained before the foundation of the world to be born again and you can never be anything else but born again think of it you can never be lost again Lord so we're dead but yet alive so the old nature is no longer there in Christ the new man the new man is not you made over it's not you sisters made over the new man is him watch this the prophet again says Abel died on this same altar his sacrificed lamb died and every believer that comes to Christ must die on the same altar with his dying lamb Christ and die in Christ to be a new creature die out to the things of the world and become Born Again a new creature in Christ Jesus die on the same altar of self sacrifice again he says what people need today is get back on that self sacrifice lay your all on the altar forget who you are but the Son of God or the daughter of God forget who you are but the son of God or the daughter of God forget who you are but the Son of God or the daughter of God we are too well aware of who we are in the Reagans we're too aware of who we are as a witson or an orff or a Smith or whatever your name is you need to lay the Reagan part aside you need to lay the Smith's part aside or whatever you are in the natural birst and realize I was a thought of God before I was ever a Reagan I'm only a Reagan temporarily that was the family he ordained me to be in in this life but before I was a Reagan I was a thought in the mind of God and when I leave this place I won't be a Reagan no more I will go back into that original creation he already has a body prepared for me Hallelujah I'll go back to my true and original family I want you to listen to this how he goes into this he says walk forward claim every promise God's got for you there will be a Revival that'll Shake New York like it never shook before men come back men and women come back to God come back to the place I don't mean come back to church I mean come back to God let every home come on start a Revival praise be to God our church is no stronger than the homes that make up our church our church is no more uh you know on on the the opes of God's presence and the H that make up this church because if we want Revival over brother da there ain't no Revival in the world I agree with you but that don't mean we can't have one a Word of Life well God ain't moving out yonder I agree he may not be doing a whole lot out yonder because of their unbelief but there ain't no reason why we cannot see him the same yesterday today and forever I don't know about you I want to see him manifest himself Among Us greater than he's ever done it before listen to this he says what we need today is an oldfashioned God sent Revival clean up the home clean up the heart give things ready start a Revival in your home and it'll begin at the church well somebody Word of Life say Amen to that it's not just brother Donnie's part to start a Revival you men in your home you need to start you got things in your life clean them out you got things in your home that don't please the Lord get rid of it let's start a Revival what do you mean Revival what's Revival doing washes all the trash out of your life you got Envy you got Strife you got jealousy well come on somebody you're doing things in your life that displease the Lord start a Revival in your home it may start in that corner then jump on them then jump on those in the mezanine and then jump on this one jump on that one what is it you starting a Revival I don't bring Revival I cannot carry Revival start a Revival in your home and it'll begin at the church a preacher don't bring Revival in his briefcase God sends it from Heaven to the individuals to the individuals not to the church body not well the all the message move needs Revival let me tell you something I don't want to be the be bad news but this message as a whole will never have this God shaking World World opening Revival it will never ever come it's individuals and it will be churches that believe it we're as divided as the denominations are I am not one to just be identified say well I'm a message believer all that's well and good I want to be a holy ghost F Sanctified on fire Son of God don't you I want our church yes we identified as a message church but I want more than the term I want more than the title I want the living god notice in Romans 6:4 Paul says therefore we're buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life newness look at the meaning of the word in the new state of life and which the Holy Spirit places a soul as to produce a new state which is eternal life that's the newness thank you Lord of life for we if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be also in the likess of his resurrection knowing this that our old man listen now our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin amen amen oh so the old man is dead and there's a new man and we are not to serve sin and the church said you see the Christians who still serve sin are christless Christians Ephesians 4:22 that you put off concerning the former conversation amen the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness notice what the new man is it is a new creation created after God so it's not us while I pray I read my Bible three times a day I fast every now and then I pay my TI and I give offerings and I do and I do that's good that's really good that's that's wonderful that that life has changed you to make you want to do for others but that within itself is not what I'm talking about I'm talking about you actually receive the new man Christ Jesus look friends when're in the evening time God wants us to have more than just a baptism of the Holy Ghost in our spirit now I know many of you didn't have come from Pentecost you never saw what myself and some of the others some of the older ones here seen in Pentecost how the people could run scream shout holler prophesy true prophecy speaking tongues with true tongues and true interpretation hit it right on and other times miss it just as wrong as it could be off on off on live lives that was contrary to the word of God I want more than that for us I want more than just a baptism of the Holy Ghost in our spirit the token must move into the soul it must be more than manifestations of the spirit of God and we lay hands on other yes and we're going to continue to do so but I don't want it for us to just stop there I want it to be that when we go before God In Prayer we can present the token what is the token it is your own personal uh possession that God gave you of himself it's your right to the Life of Christ more than a gift more than tongues more than speaking around Oh Glory to God hallelujah I love you Jesus that's wonderful but when you pray you present your token what is that token it's not a sensation it's not an emotion it is the personal life of Christ the man Christ Jesus in you no wonder the prophet said that he don't hear your voice he don't even see you it's your voice coming up through the blood of the Lord Jesus and it's the Son of God himself lord god notice that you put on the new man which after God has created and righteousness and true Holiness so if there's a true Holiness it lets us know there's a false one oh come on now we're not the only people that wear long skirts and long dresses and long hair and all that sort of thing the the men andite Hutterites many of them do exactly the same thing there's still some of the apostolic down in Mississippi and in Louisiana and Alabama and they've got just as much outward Holiness as we do and we believe in that but we also believe there is a true Holiness that generat itself from the soul out and if it's from the soul it will reflect itself on the way you dress and the way you act in the world notice now Paul in Colossians 3:9 he says lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him now remember knowledge to the Greeks was just being able to know Thing by facts but knowledge to the Jews nosis was not just knowing the factual side of it but knowing it by experience right Romans 6:11 likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed into sin be alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let not sin therefore rain in your mortal body don't you notice how Paul separates you from your house now Paul is addressing the newborn part the soul let not sin therefore reign in your mortal B so he separates you and he's telling you don't let sin be a king over you he gives a personification a very strange personification to sin as if though sin was a king as if though sin was an individual ah here we go so if sin is an individual then righteousness must also be an individual Tree of Life tree of knowledge of Good and Evil let not sin therefore Reign the word Reign the Greek is bilios which means to be king over so Paul is writing to a part of us that is different from the Mortal body so that's that's who Romans 6 is addressed to is the soul of the regenerate let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lust thereof why because sin ens slaves making a person subject to sin's desires so sin is actually a master sin is a characterization of a spiritual being which has desires and passions and wants and longings but in order for him to fully Express them the way he wants he wants to do it through human beings you see Satan will never achieve everything that he wants just by him and how many other angels that he took in the beginning we don't know exactly how many there were but there must have been quite a few one of the words is used there in the Book of Genesis is Myriad that describes those also in the Book of Revelation when he talks about those that had fallen so it was Myriad one of the meanings of the word Myriad is a number which you cannot number so we don't know exactly but it's like he does not want to stop there he wants it in you he wants said an Ever Sinner and whenever we were born in sin he was king of our life his nature we partook of it by natural birth and when you got the holy ghost in your soul it turned hell upside down amen so he lost control every son and daughter of God sitting in this building today was taken away from the devil just out the Earth is fixing to be taken away from it thank you Lord and boy you know how he is with his possession he don't love you he does not love you the prophet said Satan is not love and he cannot love so he doesn't love you but he's very jealous of what's his so God slipped down and wooed you to himself and pulled you to an altar somewhere and you and God made an agreement together and there you laid down that old nature on the Altar and that old nature died which was your first husband that I wish somebody would hear me this morning that first nature which had a rule over you was your first husband and you were married to that don't get in your mind now that well the Lord's going to just save me you know he's going to divorce that that old thing and that you know I I'll be able to take that same old nature and Remar that nature to the Lord Jesus oh no you can't remember the high priest must marry a virgin Only The Lord Oh Glory to God the Lord Jesus is not going to Remar what was formerly the devil's wife he's not going to take you and you and you and you and you and then he'll stand there well I that's okay that don't bother me I I I'll I'll marry the devil's wife he said no I ain't doing that but I will give her a new birth amen and it will be as if though she never done it in the first place I will remove the devil's nature the devil's power I will be born in her and I will marry myself in her because it will be me living out my own life W glory to [Applause] God so the nature the command center the control tower and the Soul amen when you got born again you walked up to that alar and all all the demons out of hell they're they're shaking they're quivering they're trembling oh no don't let him get it don't let him get it don't let her get it don't let her get it do everything again whisper now for it whisper she cross the line don't let her get it don't let her get it you imagine these demons hang around these meetings and whenever they sees people coming up and getting the Holy Ghost and they say oh no oh no if they ever get it they'll never be ours again if they ever get it oh my and we're going to have to answer to the big man downstairs you imagine how it is when them Devils go down in hell after some meetings glory to God on Sunday morning question answers on Thursday night and on Wednesday night and then Devil's have to report and say all right what happened up there there another young person got the Holy Ghost what do you mean allowing them to get the Holy Ghost I've done everything I could I told I tried to get them from going to church I made them have a flat tar I made them had a headache and you know what they done they went in there and said down anyway I thought I had him convinced cuz I got there real comfortable and I made him real sleepy but all all of a sudden something come down and struck their soul I don't know how to explain it devil it got a hold to them oh glory to God that got a hold to them and change their and you imagine the devil saying why did you do that well if he'd be honest he'd have to say I didn't have no power over it I hate to admit it but I just couldn't hold him back let me tell you something if we start putting harnesses in these seats and seat belts and tying your feet to the chair some of you jump up and come like this to the altar if you have to why because it's a holy ghost it's the spirit of God drawing you there's not enough gravity on the earth there's not enough powers in hell to keep an elect child of God in darkness notice in Romans 8:13 or 6:13 rather neither yield [Music] ye your members so Paul is speaking to a resident that's living in the house and saying don't let your doors don't let you windows don't let you attics don't let let your porch don't let your living room your kitchen or your bedroom don't let them be members to the devil you're the boss of this house Christ the new man so Paul eradicates the idea that the devil made me do I didn't have no power over him that is a lie amen amen amen neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness under sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as now notice he doesn't say they are members of righteousness but they're as my body don't like to be used by the Holy Ghost my body don't like to praise the Lord right you've heard me preach it before about Paul being chained to a Roman guard and whenever Paul would have to go preach that Roman guard standing there by him in the Pulpit you imagine that was an odd situation Paul wanted to praise the lord well he's changed that Roman Guard Paul put his hands up that Roman guard put his hands up too Paul said I'm going to pray and that Roman said I I I I don't I don't pray to your God he said well I'm going to pray I'm not sure who you're praying to but I know who I'm praying to Paul go to prayer meeting that Roman guard was with him well that's the way you are you're trained to a dead man what is that dead man this old body right here is this still does this still lean toward the world and the things of the world absolutely it does notice how Paul differentiates between the New Birth part in the soul and this part right here and he identifies this as your members he doesn't say it's you amen he doesn't say it's you he says it's your members of your house that you're living in can't you see children that when we are born again all a saint of God passes beyond the curtain of time and we weep and we cry yes we do because we love them and we miss them but they are not dead that was simply an old cult the prophet said but the Lord had a brand new one for them glory to God Amen there's a brand new body weight and so what do we do I'm doing the very best thing I can do for This Old House of mine I take it to church I'll make it pray I'll make it study well glory to God I'll make it sing I'll make it bend down on its knees and pray and one of these days this old body is going to thank me for making it go to church it's going to thank me for M making me turn my head it's going to thank me because the king in my body say hey hey hey don't you do that [Applause] I kind of hope on that morning I'm standing in front of the mirror I know there's a lot of men in the message are jealous of me not because of my preaching or because of my gift but because of my hair you ought to see it sometimes and I've had sleepless night though worrying about Saints I get up the next morning it don't look like just one rooster tail it looks like a hen house I mean they're sticking up all over my head and there's a witness sitting right there smiling right now she knows she sees them so I'll have to get up and wet it down and she'll wet it down she said you have a bad night yeah a rough night turning on that pillow back and forth back and forth oh my I've always kind of wondered how awesome it must be on that Resurrection morning when you're standing there in front of the mirror and you gargle your list streen and you get your toothbrush out and you go to brushing your teeth and you know getting ready putting your contacts in if you can find them and you're just getting ready to face the day and all of a sudden there appears your loved ones behind you in the bathroom door and you're saying glory to God it ain't going to be long I'm going to be changed you talking about being happy my body will want to embrace my soul and say thank you thank you thank you one of these days friends it's going to happen around this world what's happened only a few times before the dead and chist shall rise first and we which are alive and remain are going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye because you brought this body subject to the word your soul will lead your body back to Eternity in a moment you will be changed men Lance has done talked about it no doubt Erica won't show up to mine and Carol's house first she show up over the hill first 101 not 209 but after they get the their little time Lance and M4 babies sitting there together today glory to God she may appear to her mama first cuz her mama had her before I ever did she was attached to her mama today is kind of a sad day for Mother's Day because one of the attributes that made her that is no longer here it's a mother but she's only on a vacation as a matter of fact one of her little girls said that the way she deals with her mama being gone is that Mama's Just on an extended vacation and we're either going to go to our mama is or mama's going to come back to us I think that's pretty good for a child don't you that's the way we look at it this morning that's the way it is Sister Linda Brother Jimmy's gone on this extend Ed vacation that's why it is Sister Linda brother Daniel's there on this extended vacation sister Linda Phillips brother Jerry just made his journey just a few days ago it ain't been very long yet but oh you imagine him running up through there imagine some of the some first ones that sry maybe his mama and his daddy and then maybe brother Daniel all my daughter Erica I don't know how many different folks in the last five six months one after another after another had dreams and going beyond the curtain of time here come brother J running up to him here come brother ceil here come Erica saying oh I missed you so bad I thank God for it I believe we're getting closer than we've ever been before Oh friend what could we do what would be worse missing it for to satisfy the desires of this flesh and if you can crucify your Humanity right now it will be worth it through eternity we do not want sin to be the king of our life but we bring our body subject to the Holy Ghost I'd rather let the power of God use my hands I'd rather let the power of God use my mouth and my eyes and my ears instead of let my eyes let the devil use it why would I want to exchange that when almighty God wants to use us God wants to use you young people verse 14 for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace verse 22 but now being made free from sin and become servants to God you have your fruit on Holiness and the end everlasting life amen thank you praise God I love the way a prophet is so gifted by God to look into things that all the rest of us would never see the prophet preaches a message about the Widow from zarapas and be certain of God you're familiar with it she only has just enough oil and enough meal for one more little hake of bread then after she and her son eats this they will die they're at their end they don't know anything else to do listen at him daylight broke she said the little fella had cried all night long for something to eat what will I do with one little handful of meal maybe just putting it off and putting it off before fixing the L that she had you know that meal was Christ any a Bible student knows that Christ was the meal offering and the oil means the spirit as we know according to Ezekiel 4 and so forth that's the reason we anoint it says with oil it's the spirit what is it as St John 4 the father seeketh such to worship Him in spirit and in truth and Jesus was the truth so he was the meal offering and this oil was the spirit and the spirit mixed with the truth has got to bring something you put it together and it makes a cake wow that's what we wanted our church a cake Holy Ghost cake meal's good but not by itself oil is good mix them together what do you get a cake now watch now it's what's it ready for it's ready for the cross it's ready for self-sacrifice that's what you have to do is if the word's been preached and you've got the spirit mixing it together it's self- sacrifice to deny every pain praise God to deny every sickness to deny everything that's contrary to God's word isin't that awesome way to look at it the doctor says this that or the other that don't make a bitter difference you stand on it because God said so the meal comes you got got the oil you mix it together now I hear a voice it's a little like your daylight a voice speaks and says go out in the yard and get two sticks did you notice the scripture said two sticks the cross the meal and the oil but she's going to be called on to act now act with it so the meal and the oil and now she's going to have to act she don't know where the sticks will be laying but there's two sticks in the yard somewhere she starts off and she goes out in the yard and she looks around oh how hot the screams from the city the night prowers coming in scrambling along drinking their wines and so forth she looks down the street and she sees nothing she finds one stick part of the Cross self-sacrifice she gets another piece of a stick and when she picked up that second stick oh how gloomy it must have been death lying at the door her and her son had to eat the one little piece of the whole cake and die that's all there was of it and sometimes right in the midst of Gloom we hear the voice and when she picked up the second stick and started back there was a voice came over the gate fetch me a little water in a vessel so she's got the spirit she's got the word now she's got the cross and then this voice comes right exactly when she picks up the cross oh Lord God she turned to look with those two sticks in her hand with some meal and the allil mixed and ready and she said she addressed it and mixed it together that's what the word and spirit has to mix together and lay it upon the cross of self- sacrifice to deny anything that's contrary to what you've asked I hope somebody's hear me today I mixed it now I'm going to get the six and the voice said bring me a drink of water in the vestel and she looks and sees a man sending there leaning across the gate thin cheek bearded baldheaded looking across the gate with an old piece of sheep skin wrapped around him look like he was a kind kind of a looking Old Gentleman she said I'll share my water with him Waters of life you're willing to give it to anybody and then when she starts with the cross with some mixture now another word comes bring me a little morsel tee now see she had picked up the cross what's the prophet's message going to have her do she will now have to use that cross if you'll notice he never promised now that what you give me a hook cake first and God woman I'm telling you God's fixing to explode your meal Barrel God's fixing to explode your vessels she got no promise right what she said how can I do that I've only got just a handful of meal and a little bit of oil and I've mixed it together don't you understand I've got this cross here me my son I'm fixing to bake this and we're going to die but he said bake me one first little did she know when she picked up that cross she would have to lay her meal and her oil on the cross that she picked up and of course you know the end of the story so so let me ask you as I close what will God demand of you and I one day it might be one thing the next day it might be something else ultimately taking our cross is for whatever he chooses before us I don't mind telling you friends I believe the bride of Christ has been tried like never before I'm in contact with people all over this world I have never heard of the people of God going through so much stuff preachers churches individuals what people are going through is just unbelievable incredible the things that people are having to deal with all hell is against you as the people of God don't misunder understand what I'm going to say I can handle that but I'll tell you what becomes so difficult is when it seems like he turns against you I can't handle that anybody ever been there where you felt like Lord where are you where are you Lord if you forgot my name if you forgot where I live Lord why why are you why are you letting this happen I found the quote years and years ago where the Prophet said God you broke my heart over and over again and I thank you for it and I thought man that that was that was from a man that had been through so much and yet he was able to view it from a perspective that it had entered into Thanksgiving instead of resentment and an attitude what will God ask of you some of you say oh my we got the word we got the message of that we got a move of God we've got a church to go to praise God we got good Ministry Brothers there we got a place for our young people my what what could happen What could happen after we mix together the word and the oil the cross the cross brother Phillip two sticks one laying over here one laying over there but when you put them together and then you embrace it oh Jesus thank you thank you thank you so much thank you for letting me see this cross oh Jesus thank you thank you for dying on that cross and he said no [Music] child that's yours Oh you mean that that that that that's not yours I've done died on mine this one that you just picked up in the yard that's yours how much easier it would be brother Jim Woodson was sing in this my office there Sunday after church thanking me for just obeying the Lord there about the service the Lord dropped this Sal here in my heart as he and I were talking I told him then brother Jim people get it confused they think after they die one time why do I have to die again I said I don't think we realize that our nature dieses once but our flesh does every day praise the Lord don't you want to be willing to die so you mix your word and your spirit your oil together and then the Lord Jesus says I climb upon the cross and give it back to to me oh my how how reassuring it must have been when she hears that voice Thunder back across that gate for thus saith the Lord your meal Barrel will not R nor will your cruise of oil until the day the Lord God visits his people let's spow heads together shall we I wonder how many of you with me want to be willing help me Lord help me I love the word I love the spirit oh my but whoever thought would have to take it to that place place of the Cross where we trust him even when we don't feel him where we pray even when we don't feel nothing when we do pray will we come to church even though we may not feel it he say but yet his word says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together what are you doing you're taking that word laying it on the cross I'm going to church whether I feel it or not when I get there I'm going to worship I'm going to sing I'm going to clap my hands I'm going to or praise the Lord because that's what the word tells me to do what are you doing then you were laying that word that you've heard and that spirit that you have within you upon the cross of self-denial I don't feel you Lord I've been going to a low spot remember the prophet After the Storm was calmed out in Colorado and he said he'd been going through a spot in his life and he began to question himself and wonder if he'd done something wrong you remember the story and he said after the Lord calmed the storm there was snow laying on the leaves a little bit prior to that and as he bowed his head and started crying the tears is falling off out of his eyes down his cheeks landing on those leaves which were now dry which had been covered with snow just a little while before and said Lord you know what's wrong I don't understand have I done this have I done something wrong I was talking to someone the other day I've never found where brother brand actually ever said that he ever found what was going on during that trial but the Lord spoke to him and said why don't you come and walk with me and he said it's the greatest privilege of my life and he said that burden just left him and be certain of God in 1959 especially the one in Jeffersonville he preached it several times but that when there's always been my favorite when he said he'd come to a time in his life to where you'd uncover every stone and you search everything in your life and seemed like he can't find nothing wrong you'd make it right if you could and he said you don't know what else to do he said then what do you do you be certain of God so maybe you've got your word today and your spirit and you're looking for a move you're not sure exactly what the outcome will be take it and you and it come upon that cross and Jesus will honor you praise the Lord heavenly father thank you for the service today I actually thought last Sunday I was done with dealing with this but I've done figured out a long time ago it's a whole lot better off for me to you me to follow you than me to follow what I think anyway I pray Lord that you would make us sensitive father to the spirit of God I don't know if they can say it yet truthfully but what an honor it is how blessed we are to be able to die one more day because there's billions of people people on the face of the Earth today they cannot take that scripture that Paul read wrote in 1 Corinthians and say I Die daily because they still have that nature in them that's sinful that scripture can only apply to a son or daughter of God which has been filled with the Holy Ghost and their nature has been changed and separates them from the Mortal body in the sense of two different dominions because when we were Sinners we couldn't say that truthfully but after we're born again we can say I Die daily help us Lord Jesus how may like to be remember today before the Lord God bless you raise your heads if you would read this with me in that day on Calvary he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life and made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself do you understand one of the worst mistakes that many of the message people are making in this day they feel like they're following the plan of God they don't go to church they don't attend church they stay home and play tapes and yet there's churches and driving distance of where they live and they feel like they're fulfilling the will of God do you understand what they're doing they're fulfilling the very epitome of a selfish life I don't need to go to church it's not just about what you need we might need you amen but do people like that think about others they don't I don't need to go I get everything I need I don't need to worship I don't I don't that's not eternal life how sad it's going to be one day when the Rapture takes place and all over the world yes sir people are just getting ready to stream and stay home yes sir and if the Rapture takes place on that Sunday morning they'll still be able to stream because they'll be left they will be left because they are living a selfish life amen they can get up and listen to the tape with their pajamas on they can have a cup of coffee in their hand and a donut if they wish when some of youve do two hours one way to come to church today what time you have to get up early to get that start some of you drove further than that why because you wanted to be here not just so you could get something but you could bring your little lick of fire with the rest of us you being here helps me you being here helps others and people who live that life I don't need to go to church they're not living the life of the Lord Jesus oh I know some of you have family members that do it pray for them cuz don't you understand they will hang around this message with their long hair and their long dress and they will miss the Rapture if the Lord Jesus marries one selfish person I quit if he marries one cigarette sucking man and one cigarette sucker is allowed to go in the Rapture I quit today for all he's demanded out of many of us and he will let somebody go on the Rapture that is so self centered that they have their very epitome of Satan's nature and he allows one to go like that oh my he's been unjust to me he has been so unjust to many of us he demanded our lives he demanded that we be separated from our families I was disowned by my family years ago for this word for years my family wouldn't even speak to me I wasn't allowed to dinners I wasn't allowed to nothing and then God's going to let some of his message people go in that's as backslid as they can be and they're going to go on the Rapture no Word of Life there's one way we will go in this rapture we must be filled with the Holy Ghost and we must be living a life which is worthy of the Gospel of Jesus Christ was that for you are you are you is that for you brother John it was okay all right I was wondering who I was saying that for all right brother John when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when he come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others someone said how can you stand and let anyone call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot their sons your sons you're taking Christ's place so you don't live for yourself you live for others well brother brandom I can live for the brother oh that brother because he's a really nice man that's not it live for that man who hates you live for that person who kill you if they could well now we're separating the men from the boys ain't we now we're separating the bride from the church now we're separating message people from bride people cuz all message people ain't bride people can you imagine live for that person who would kill you if they could that's what they done to him yes they killed him and he died that he might save them listen to this church let's stand together that's eternal life when that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then notice where he said it was here not here when every one of us get that we're Rapture Ready praise God let me read one more a person who lives their life for their s lives a selfish life praise the Lord don't you love him today don't you love one another it ain't enough to love him and it ain't enough to love those that like you it ain't enough to be able to oh yes I would gladly brother Donnie there's people here today I know I I know beyond a shadow of a doubt if it come between my life and your life some of you would give your life so that I could live because you think what I do is more beneficial than what you do and you would give your life for me that I could live that's wonderful that's notable but when we get to the place that we could do it for the person that tells things on us it's not true that lies on us that hurts us you're even closer to looking heaven in the face than whenever you do it for me you see I know whenever Erica went through her hard time especially the last six months or so I know that y'all kept your birds from me I know the deacons kept things from us CU they knew we were going through so much stuff ourselves Carol said you reckon the church people ain't going through a whole lot of stuff I said you know that you know what they're doing they're keeping it from us once Erica graduated moved on up into that sixth Dimension boy did you all let the gates fly open but you know what that done to me you'll never know what that done to me Carol because it let us know you was having such hard times but you felt so for us you didn't want to add to our trouble amen God bless you for that I want to live with you all for eternity you hear me I Don't Preach hard things to you because I dislike you I do it because I love you what kind of man would I be to cut a corn corner and just patch you on the back well they might get their feelings hurt I know probably nearly everybody here's got mad at me before including my wife maybe even my brother but if I make you mad every now and then to tell you the truth on that day when we stand there together you're going to come run into me oh brother Dary thank you thank you won't we brother Daryl stands here and these other ministers and they say things that cuts us oh one day when we stand there we'll be so grateful to God oh praise the Lord sing something for us har thank you Lord Jesus can we just worship him a little bit before we go now oh praise the Lord praise the Lord
