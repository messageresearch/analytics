[42:38] protection of his wings and this hour
[42:40] will live him amen me brother Daryl was
[42:42] just talking about before I came out if
[42:44] a prophet whenever he was here in his
[42:46] day was talking about the world groping
[42:49] and Insanity can you imagine what he'd
[42:51] say now about how dark it is and the
[42:55] spiritual condition of of the world our
[42:58] natural state of our our nation and the
[43:01] nations of the world come Lord Jesus is
[43:04] what I say
[43:06] Amen Let's uh turn tonight if you would
[43:09] to numbers chap 1 verse
[43:11] 52 remember the U youth meetings that'll
[43:15] be going on this weekend brother Matt
[43:16] Watkins and um just looking for the Lord
[43:20] to come in a special way did yall
[43:23] announce it already to announce it okay
[43:27] um not only for the Youth of course but
[43:30] brother mat be speaking to to the whole
[43:32] church on Sunday so we're looking
[43:33] forward to that as well always
[43:35] appreciate brother Matt's
[43:38] Ministry numbers 1 verse
[43:42] 52 how many believes it's important to
[43:45] find your
[43:47] position your position in Christ of
[43:49] course and then your position in in the
[43:53] in the body um your position in the home
[43:57] we know it's a very important thing to
[43:59] God many people don't put much relevance
[44:02] on it they just do whatever and whenever
[44:05] and however but our God has always been
[44:08] a god of order divine order that's what
[44:11] we want and I've said it before and I've
[44:13] said it again tonight probably said it
[44:15] many times as we go on we're so against
[44:19] organization if we're not careful we'll
[44:22] be against organism and divine order and
[44:26] if you don't think the prophet taught
[44:27] divine order type it in and you'll find
[44:31] out the Bible is filled with it that's
[44:34] not the same thing as organization
[44:36] there's a difference in man organizing
[44:38] something and God setting it up by his
[44:41] word I was looking at it today where
[44:43] Paul had told the Believers in the first
[44:46] church age to be followers of
[44:50] him he mentioned it several times and he
[44:53] also told them to be followers of the
[44:55] church churches so I just clicked on
[44:58] that y'all think I'm really smart I
[45:00] ain't really too smart I just click and
[45:02] get the meanings of them words so I just
[45:05] clicked on that and it took me straight
[45:06] to the Greek
[45:08] Lexicon and the meaning of the word was
[45:11] to be a follower of him was to be an
[45:16] imitator an imitator come here you
[45:24] you
[45:28] I want you to imitate
[45:32] me I want you not
[45:37] to do something
[45:48] different now which one looks like me
[45:52] neither one of them look exactly like
[45:54] this thing that's for sure but which one
[45:56] is imitating me you
[45:59] choose so what about preachers
[46:03] then if we've got one that s what the
[46:05] Bible said and one what the prophet said
[46:07] then we've got one that
[46:09] ain't thank you
[46:17] brothers so we want to be
[46:20] imitators of Christ
[46:23] right now watch this numbers chap 1 ver
[46:25] 52 and the children of Israel shall
[46:27] pitch their tents every man by his own
[46:29] Camp every man by his own standard
[46:33] throughout the host chapter 2 verse two
[46:36] every man of the children of Israel
[46:38] shall pitch by his own standard with the
[46:41] ins sign of his father's
[46:44] house far off about the Tabernacle of
[46:48] the
[46:48] congregation shall they pitch Isaiah
[46:53] 5919 so shall they fear the the name of
[46:56] the Lord from the West and his glory
[46:57] from the rising of the sun when the
[47:00] enemy shall come in like a flood the
[47:03] spirit of the Lord which is
[47:06] ruach ruach Spirit of the Lord shall
[47:11] lift up a standard against him so the
[47:15] enemy comes in and when he does then the
[47:17] spirit of God lifts up a standard which
[47:20] is an inside what is it a flag it's an
[47:24] identification a message if you will
[47:27] it's so you know where to stand so the
[47:30] enemy comes in like a flood and whenever
[47:34] he does God raises up a sign and the
[47:37] elect of God are looking looking looking
[47:39] like everybody else is looking looking
[47:42] where do we go where do we go where do
[47:43] we go and
[47:45] God raises up the flag and said this is
[47:49] the box of the
[47:52] hour this is the anointing you're
[47:54] supposed to live by walk by talk by and
[47:57] in our age be raptured
[48:01] by Joel chapter 2 verse
[48:06] 7 they shall run like Mighty Men they
[48:09] shall climb the wall like Men of War and
[48:12] they shall March everyone on his ways
[48:15] now remember this is a prophecy of the
[48:16] last days of the army of God and they
[48:20] shall not break their
[48:23] ranks so if this is a prophet prophecy
[48:26] what do you figure the devil's going to
[48:28] do try to get us as the people of God to
[48:32] break that prophecy right and see this
[48:35] is not making that you oh I there ain't
[48:38] no God I I've just made up my mind there
[48:40] ain't no God no that's not people like
[48:42] that it's simply just to try to talk
[48:45] them out of the will of God for their
[48:48] life and then they will break the rank
[48:51] so God predetermines and pre assigns
[48:53] your rank and then Satan will do his
[48:56] best to pull you out of it how many
[49:00] light to be remembered tonight as we
[49:01] pray let's just hold our needs our
[49:04] requests and our heart before the Lord
[49:06] Heavenly Father we love you so much we
[49:09] thank you for your word we thank you for
[49:11] the insign that's been raised in every
[49:14] age we're grateful for those ins signs
[49:16] in the past we're grateful for the ins
[49:19] signs that will be raised during the
[49:21] time of the tribulation period for it
[49:24] will be a gathering again of your people
[49:27] not your bride but Lord are we so
[49:30] grateful in this day that you have sent
[49:33] an anointing an ins sign an Insignia
[49:38] that we might be able to be identified
[49:40] with it help us tonight father that each
[49:44] of us can each and every individual men
[49:48] women boys girls no matter who we are
[49:51] what our age what our color authenticity
[49:54] help us father to be more more
[49:55] determined than ever before to find our
[49:58] place and to war in that place and not
[50:02] let no Devils our mama our daddy no
[50:06] preacher no prophets no
[50:11] prophesied that place in Christ Jesus
[50:16] granted father it's in Jesus name we
[50:18] pray and the Saints said amen God bless
[50:21] you you may be seated I'd like to go
[50:24] back to that that are read to you last
[50:26] Wednesday night from the fifth seal now
[50:29] the prophet has a little box there where
[50:31] people would give prayer requests and
[50:32] prayer clause and things like that and
[50:34] he says I'm going to set this box up
[50:36] here to represent that and what he's
[50:38] talking about is that God would release
[50:41] a certain anointing in every day and the
[50:44] people of the day the elect of God could
[50:47] only operate under that anointing that
[50:50] God gave to them and he gives us the
[50:53] four powers that was released from the
[50:55] The Book of Revelation of course and the
[50:57] first one was influenced by the very
[50:59] Life of Christ himself which was the
[51:01] line of the tribe of Judah and then we
[51:04] had the ox or a a sacrificial uh beast
[51:08] and then we had the face of a man and
[51:11] then we had a flying eagle I'm sure that
[51:13] all of you all already know it but three
[51:17] out of those four are Earthbound the
[51:20] lion Earthbound the ox Earthbound the
[51:25] the man Earthbound and the force was a
[51:29] flying eagle was the anointing that Paul
[51:32] and the first church age operated under
[51:34] tremendous absolutely tremendous
[51:37] anointing but it could not produce a
[51:41] Rapture now think of it none of them in
[51:44] the first church age took a
[51:47] Rapture there was not a Rapture message
[51:51] it was a church message a burst message
[51:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost message but it
[51:57] was also a burial message a burial of
[52:03] the seed of God that was going to be
[52:06] crushed and going to die out in the
[52:09] alpha stage and then it would bring a
[52:12] resurrection so none of them had a
[52:15] Rapture even the Beloved Apostle Paul
[52:18] which was able to go into the third
[52:20] Heavens hear things that was not lawful
[52:22] for him to utter tell the Saints when he
[52:24] come back but yet that he did not have a
[52:27] Rapture he went by the way of the grave
[52:30] and is there of course to this day in
[52:33] the sixth Dimension waiting for the
[52:35] resurrection then we move from that
[52:38] anointing to the ox anointing not one of
[52:41] them had a Rapture there was not a
[52:44] church in that anointing that had a
[52:47] Rapture moved from there to the man
[52:49] anointing which come right up and joined
[52:53] into ours not one of them had a Rapture
[52:58] not a one of them churches was caught
[53:01] out but prophecy says that there will in
[53:05] the last days be those who will have a
[53:09] Rapture now listen there have been those
[53:12] of course that have lived under the
[53:14] eagle anointing and many of them have
[53:17] also died many of them have come to the
[53:20] spot to where their life was terminated
[53:23] as we know but they live their life walk
[53:26] their life and believe the light of the
[53:28] day under the message of the hour and
[53:31] they were partakers in that their souls
[53:35] were already quickened now remember the
[53:37] token was not in the middle Church ages
[53:41] the token was not under the man
[53:44] anointing the token was not under the ox
[53:48] anointing but the token was to return in
[53:52] the last day in the evening time
[53:54] remember the prophet says it himself
[53:57] it's evening time for me it's evening
[53:59] time for you when when the token is to
[54:03] return in its fullness now did they have
[54:06] a portion of the spirit of God they did
[54:08] lucer had a portion of the spirit of God
[54:11] but he didn't have enough to help him
[54:12] lay down his PO his
[54:15] pipe neither did they had enough to quit
[54:17] drinking their beer come on now but yet
[54:20] there was a fullness that was going to
[54:22] return in the last day now under that
[54:26] anointing it will be some of the same
[54:29] things remember God can never give a
[54:32] revelation and then send somebody else
[54:35] with another Revelation contrary to that
[54:39] one God can send a revelation and then
[54:43] God will add more to that Revelation and
[54:46] as the prophet says it in the church
[54:47] AG's book it will simply be more
[54:51] information about the same thing but it
[54:55] will not be contrary you know that God
[54:57] cannot say one thing and then say
[54:59] something else so God would not send a
[55:01] prophet in this day and send me or any
[55:04] other man and that would say something
[55:06] the exact opposite of what that Prophet
[55:08] said absolutely not he might send other
[55:12] men and they'll be gifted in other ways
[55:14] and they might make it you know in an
[55:16] Evangelistic way or in a teacher way but
[55:19] they'll not say one thing contrary and
[55:22] be led of the Holy Ghost because the
[55:23] Holy Ghost has one mind
[55:25] and the church
[55:26] said so what is then this anointing in
[55:30] the last day so what is released to us
[55:33] in order to bring it to pass now he goes
[55:36] on to say now he'll prove it to you by
[55:38] the history of the church and by the
[55:39] opening of those seals and the powers
[55:41] that let loose watch exactly the church
[55:44] responded to the anointing and they
[55:47] couldn't do nothing else so now think of
[55:50] people that are still operating and
[55:54] we've got millions of them that are
[55:56] still operating under the man anointing
[56:00] so they will take the word and they
[56:02] study it and they oh my that they do a
[56:05] great job with it while they can write
[56:07] Christian books Christian bookstores are
[56:09] full of books written by Christian
[56:12] authors and they approach the gospel
[56:14] from what view not from the Flying Eagle
[56:17] but from the man so they bring it from
[56:20] the psychological side and they would
[56:23] got Christian therapist and Christian
[56:25] this and Christian that on how to love
[56:28] your wife and how to be a better man how
[56:31] to do this what's it all dealing with
[56:34] the mind to try to be able to you know a
[56:37] psycho analysis to where that they can
[56:39] be able to set you down and know your
[56:41] problem is this you know you had these
[56:43] issues when you were a child and this is
[56:46] what made you this way let's talk about
[56:49] it and let's bring it out that'll help
[56:51] you deal with it better no a lot of
[56:53] times it's a spirit it ain't got nothing
[56:55] to do with just that and you read them
[56:57] books and you say oh I'm a better man
[56:59] I'm a better man and you still don't
[57:01] have the power to be able to overcome
[57:03] sin why because it's working on the mind
[57:06] again and what's sad about it is friends
[57:09] we've got message preachers that have
[57:10] done exactly the same thing and they're
[57:13] still doing the same thing to this very
[57:15] day to try to take the message and
[57:17] change it just modify it a little bit
[57:20] just whitewash it a little bit you know
[57:22] we we can preach the message without
[57:24] mentioning where we got it oh why in the
[57:26] world would you want to do that you know
[57:29] Paul told him he said don't be ashamed
[57:31] of the gospel and don't be ashamed to me
[57:33] his messenger what in the world is a
[57:35] matter with a preacher that ain't got
[57:37] enough guts to stand up and tell where
[57:39] he's getting what he's preaching I call
[57:42] that a
[57:43] chicken I said I call that a chicken I
[57:46] knew them guys back in Pentecost but a
[57:48] real anointed servant of God is not
[57:52] ashamed to tell of where he feing
[57:55] because he knows he's going to stand to
[57:57] be identified with that Prophet
[57:59] messenger of the age now do I thank God
[58:02] for the man anointing I do I appreciate
[58:05] it with all my heart I've been
[58:08] privileged by the grace of God to
[58:10] operate under two phases of the
[58:13] anointing and that is I was called under
[58:17] the man anointing I preached under the
[58:20] man anointing I lived under the man
[58:22] anointing so and by do doing that I used
[58:25] to despise those years that I spent
[58:29] under that man anointing I did I despise
[58:32] it I thought it was a waste of time but
[58:35] as I went on I realized the Lord allowed
[58:38] me to be under that man anointing so
[58:42] whenever I come to the eagle anointing
[58:44] and when the man anointing started
[58:46] penetrating around the eagle anointing I
[58:49] would be able to look back and said I've
[58:52] already been in that and I don't want to
[58:54] repeat of that that myself I've done
[58:56] been there and done that and I know what
[58:57] that produces come on but you see some
[59:00] of the message people never were really
[59:02] in Pentecost so someone could come in
[59:05] with a Pentecostal anointing and they
[59:07] wouldn't even know it they could start
[59:09] doing things that I've done in Pentecost
[59:12] when I was a boy preacher and they
[59:13] wouldn't even know it at all they
[59:15] wouldn't even know it and they just
[59:17] swallow it right down and think well
[59:20] glory be to God my this here he goes
[59:22] it's a bride's Revival how many of them
[59:25] have we had anyway how many bride
[59:28] revivals have we had and every one of
[59:32] them points back to a man who come up
[59:35] with the
[59:36] idea well that tells me enough right
[59:39] there it ain't a bride's Revival cuz a
[59:41] Brides Revival comes from Heaven it
[59:44] don't come from New York it don't come
[59:47] from Johnson City it don't come from
[59:49] Virginia it don't come from Louisiana or
[59:53] Canada or come on somebody or Nigeria it
[59:56] didn't originate in Jeffersonville it
[59:59] originated in the streets of
[1:00:01] gold there you go but now watch what
[1:00:04] Satan will do again to try to get the
[1:00:07] army of God to break their ranks to
[1:00:11] break their ranks now you see if he
[1:00:14] cannot get you to belittle what you are
[1:00:18] then he'll try to get you to overshoot
[1:00:21] what you are it makes him no difference
[1:00:23] whichever works for you is what he's
[1:00:25] happy with so for some they you know
[1:00:28] they feel like they're never really used
[1:00:30] that much and we know how it is for some
[1:00:32] people position means everything to them
[1:00:37] I've seen people that would trade off
[1:00:39] eating a seven course meal for eating
[1:00:43] out of a garbage can because the garbage
[1:00:46] can offered them a position and yet
[1:00:50] setting there feeding on a seven course
[1:00:52] meal they might not be used near as much
[1:00:55] but to them what really matters is
[1:00:59] position anyway well let me tell you
[1:01:01] something when you go to talking like
[1:01:03] that you're talking the devil's talk can
[1:01:05] you imagine Lucifer the bright shining
[1:01:09] angel that he was and he forfeited being
[1:01:13] the right-and man of God the right-hand
[1:01:16] man to Fellowship the angel or the
[1:01:19] Cherub who stopped the approach so any
[1:01:23] angels that would come up to the throne
[1:01:25] of God they had to come up to Lucifer
[1:01:28] first that's his original name day
[1:01:31] bringer lar all that so the Angels would
[1:01:35] have to come up to Lucifer and Lucifer
[1:01:38] then would inquire of them what seeky of
[1:01:41] the master what do you want he was the
[1:01:43] anointed cherub and God said him so and
[1:01:46] he traded all of that to become what we
[1:01:50] know today as the
[1:01:53] devil can you can you imagine that a
[1:01:55] being would trade all that he was to
[1:01:59] become the devil which is my goodness an
[1:02:02] object that we have heard about our
[1:02:04] entire life that is going to be
[1:02:07] destroyed and yet that angel Satan was
[1:02:10] the greatest person in heaven outside of
[1:02:14] God
[1:02:15] himself was given great traits and
[1:02:19] characteristics and the only angel that
[1:02:22] was given Godlike
[1:02:24] traits except he was not a Creator he
[1:02:29] was more of the divine nature more of
[1:02:33] the Divine traits and characteristics
[1:02:36] but he could not stand being second
[1:02:39] place in
[1:02:40] heaven now you watch then so when Satan
[1:02:44] will begin to move on people men women
[1:02:46] boys girls whatever it is and try to get
[1:02:50] them to craving after a position or
[1:02:54] something that God himself maybe has not
[1:02:57] called them to do but they're convinced
[1:02:59] that God has but you see we know the way
[1:03:02] that God deals in his Divine protocol
[1:03:06] and that is that God deals with his
[1:03:08] creature in the way that he's made it so
[1:03:12] the prophet said a man that claims that
[1:03:14] he's called to be a pastor well he said
[1:03:17] a pastor cannot be a flighty type of
[1:03:21] person and he said if a man claims he's
[1:03:23] called to be a teacher watch how he
[1:03:27] interprets the word so if a man claims
[1:03:31] he called to be a gospel preacher gospel
[1:03:33] teacher and he will say well we don't we
[1:03:36] don't need that that that that end time
[1:03:38] message stuff well let you know right
[1:03:40] there that man ain't really called of
[1:03:41] God why watch how he interprets the word
[1:03:45] well if he goes to Reading in there and
[1:03:47] he reads the Bible and he comes out with
[1:03:49] three Gods well you know right there is
[1:03:51] not called to be able to interpret the
[1:03:54] word
[1:03:54] because God gifts him according to what
[1:03:58] he's claimed that he's called to be so
[1:04:01] and how do we judge it then by Apostolic
[1:04:04] order now some people as I said they're
[1:04:06] so against the you know the organization
[1:04:09] and all that and they don't even study
[1:04:11] the scriptures close enough to realize
[1:04:14] that the framework of Satan's Antichrist
[1:04:18] move of organization was stolen from the
[1:04:22] passages of the very Bible they hold in
[1:04:26] their
[1:04:29] lap uhhuh what's this in the Ephesian
[1:04:33] Church age this is from the church age
[1:04:35] book page 66 thus what the church was as
[1:04:39] Pentecost is the standard now in other
[1:04:42] words this the word standard here is one
[1:04:45] of the same words that was used in the
[1:04:47] Old Testament that we just read there in
[1:04:50] the book of numbers by his own standard
[1:04:53] or by his own Insignia so here the same
[1:04:57] thing is used in the New Testament the
[1:04:59] prophet uses so the Pentecostal church
[1:05:03] is the standard now what kind of church
[1:05:06] was it a church that was born of the
[1:05:08] spirit of God they did not have church
[1:05:10] membership you did not join it you were
[1:05:13] born into it you did not get into it
[1:05:16] because you was a man of wealth and
[1:05:18] because you a wealthy person they gave
[1:05:21] you a position in the church that's not
[1:05:23] the way they done it
[1:05:24] but they actually they were led by the
[1:05:27] spirit of God and the Holy Ghost would
[1:05:31] tell them separate me Paul and Barnabas
[1:05:36] so there was none of this stuff well
[1:05:38] there's brother so and so back there
[1:05:40] he's quite wealthy so let's make him a a
[1:05:43] position in the church and as long as
[1:05:46] you know we do that we we'll kind of
[1:05:48] appease him and uh and he'll He he'll
[1:05:50] all the time contribute a whole lot to
[1:05:53] the church yeah and every one of them
[1:05:55] guys come with an agenda too and then
[1:05:58] you cross them and they'll pull their
[1:06:00] money from you and then you're led by
[1:06:03] businessmen instead of being led by the
[1:06:06] Holy Ghost come on brother Donnie preach
[1:06:09] well you see that is the standard so
[1:06:13] then when you see a church that is being
[1:06:15] formed and you watch the pastor and you
[1:06:18] watch the the people in position and
[1:06:21] they go to picking people and giving
[1:06:23] them positions because they know the
[1:06:26] makeup of that man and that man and that
[1:06:28] man and they know if he don't get a
[1:06:31] position he won't stay now I know friend
[1:06:34] I know you don't even want to hear this
[1:06:36] but I'm got to tell you there's Pastors
[1:06:38] in this message that study by psychology
[1:06:42] they study people's makeup well enough
[1:06:45] to know when a man wants and needs a
[1:06:49] position and they will give him one if
[1:06:52] they can pull him from another church
[1:06:54] that is and in order to let them do this
[1:06:58] and that and the other and then people
[1:07:00] will fall right in for it come on
[1:07:02] Brother Don and then we claim we
[1:07:05] Apostolic well I'll tell you what I'll
[1:07:07] do I'll tell you what I'll do I'll
[1:07:10] apologize for tonight's sermon if you
[1:07:13] show me that in the
[1:07:18] Bible and if I can show you where it
[1:07:21] ain't you need to apologize to me after
[1:07:23] the service is over for thinking what
[1:07:25] you just
[1:07:27] thought praise the Lord now are we
[1:07:30] Apostolic or do we just think we are now
[1:07:34] what so here is the standard the church
[1:07:36] at Pentecost there is no other pattern
[1:07:39] no matter what Scholars say God has not
[1:07:42] changed the pattern what God did at
[1:07:46] Pentecost he has to keep on doing until
[1:07:50] the church ages close how many word of
[1:07:52] alive believes this quote
[1:07:54] well I'd like to know why some people
[1:07:56] think God's changed the
[1:08:00] pattern we got folks around this message
[1:08:02] they don't even believe in Preachers
[1:08:04] well God has to change the pattern there
[1:08:07] somehow they think the end time is just
[1:08:10] push and play and Obey you show me that
[1:08:13] quote that had a quote brother Ram said
[1:08:16] that's something somebody made up it
[1:08:18] might make a nice cliche but it's not in
[1:08:21] the teachings of the word of God
[1:08:24] come on somebody say Amen what if you
[1:08:26] can't say Amen say ouch or at least seek
[1:08:28] him or something so I know you're
[1:08:29] listening to me now notice what God did
[1:08:32] at Pentecost he has to keep on doing
[1:08:36] until the church ages closed how many
[1:08:38] believes the church age is still on
[1:08:39] going and the lead of sin age will close
[1:08:42] with the Rapture of the body change now
[1:08:44] watch's this in page 67 the promise of
[1:08:47] the power with which the apostles were
[1:08:50] uted Pentecost is to you Jews and your
[1:08:53] children Jews and to all them a far off
[1:08:57] Gentiles to as many as the Lord Our God
[1:09:00] shall call both Jew and Gentile until he
[1:09:03] stops calling the
[1:09:05] Pentecostal message and power will
[1:09:18] not now when preachers try to take
[1:09:21] quotes from the same message and make it
[1:09:24] sound like brother Brandon was against
[1:09:27] Pentecost I wonder what they're led by
[1:09:31] well come on now remember the prophet
[1:09:33] was a great balancer and if he would be
[1:09:35] at Jack Moors he would say certain
[1:09:37] things if he'd be among the brother out
[1:09:40] there in Arkansas in
[1:09:41] 1963 and you hear him preaching on once
[1:09:44] more and then you hear him go back to
[1:09:46] the Tabernacle and described them
[1:09:49] Services now he said some of you all
[1:09:51] were there he said that group of people
[1:09:53] was was leaning in a certain way and God
[1:09:56] led me to try to pull them out of that
[1:10:00] direction now you see that's where
[1:10:02] preachers have got to be so careful when
[1:10:05] we go to pull in quotes together and to
[1:10:07] make sure that we're following the
[1:10:09] continuity of the spirit of God because
[1:10:12] you can pull a quote here and one there
[1:10:14] and one somewhere else and you put them
[1:10:16] together glory to God I'm saying exactly
[1:10:18] what the prophet said you mean you're
[1:10:21] put you're saying exactly what the
[1:10:22] prophet said and them three places that
[1:10:25] don't mean that's all he said about that
[1:10:27] certain subject so we got people say
[1:10:30] well we're Beyond Pentecost and we don't
[1:10:33] need that no more well I'm afraid we've
[1:10:35] got an issue right here then because
[1:10:38] that same Prophet also said that it will
[1:10:41] not cease the Pentecostal message and
[1:10:44] power will not cease and Word of Life
[1:10:50] said notice again what the church had at
[1:10:54] Pentecost is her I love this quote
[1:10:58] inalienable right here we go the bride's
[1:11:01] rights it is our right well I want them
[1:11:07] I said I want them it is oh Hallelujah
[1:11:11] it is our right notice what the church
[1:11:13] had at Pentecost is her inalienable
[1:11:16] right originally she had the pure word
[1:11:19] of God she had the power of the spirit
[1:11:23] manif fested in diverse signs and
[1:11:25] wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:29] yet if we see that today in some message
[1:11:32] churches then you are lied at you are
[1:11:35] ridiculed do you understand some of our
[1:11:37] services portions of them are played in
[1:11:41] certain message churches and are played
[1:11:44] to be ridiculed Brother Louie is tuck of
[1:11:47] certain little clips and certain clips
[1:11:50] of our songs and other churches that are
[1:11:53] played before congregations and we are
[1:11:56] used as an example to prove Pentecost
[1:12:00] well they use it to shame us I counted a
[1:12:03] great honor I counted an honor to be
[1:12:05] identified with people that still
[1:12:08] believe in Acts 238 acts 2:4 Mark 16
[1:12:13] come on somebody I'm glad to be
[1:12:16] identified with a group of people that
[1:12:19] believe Jesus Christ is the same
[1:12:22] yesterday today forever he still heals
[1:12:25] the sin he still Saves The Lost he still
[1:12:29] baptizes with the Holy
[1:12:31] [Applause]
[1:12:41] Ghost that original church was not
[1:12:43] organized by men it was led by the Holy
[1:12:47] Ghost it wasn't very big it was hated
[1:12:51] and despised it was oppressed it was
[1:12:54] persecuted unto death but it was true to
[1:12:57] God it stayed with the original word Oh
[1:13:01] Glory pattern how many believes it how
[1:13:04] many wants our church to be exactly the
[1:13:07] same way well tell me how it is now my
[1:13:11] wife is a seamstress her grandmother
[1:13:14] taught her to First SE and she was what
[1:13:16] three years old something like that she
[1:13:18] set Carol up on her lap and she had one
[1:13:20] of the more meal machines you sisters
[1:13:23] understand what I'm talking about and
[1:13:25] she would she Carol's feet of course
[1:13:27] couldn't even reach it so her
[1:13:28] grandmother would sit there and pedal
[1:13:30] the thing and she would show Carol how
[1:13:32] to turn a seam and so she's a absolute
[1:13:36] beautiful seamstress of what she can do
[1:13:38] and I've helped her before on our bar
[1:13:41] whenever she'd lay out something and
[1:13:42] she'd make a pattern and she'd take and
[1:13:45] maybe she got patterns that she's used
[1:13:47] for years find a good skirt cuz we're
[1:13:50] the skirt church and have a skirt
[1:13:53] pattern and use the same pattern well
[1:13:55] wouldn't it be really odd if she laid
[1:13:58] out that pattern and cut a skirt size
[1:14:00] six and she did that for the first year
[1:14:03] and then two years later she made
[1:14:05] another out of the same pattern three
[1:14:07] years later four years later five years
[1:14:09] later and then 15 years later she lays
[1:14:13] out that same pattern and I hear out
[1:14:15] walks my wife with a dress instead of
[1:14:17] being down here is way up here and I
[1:14:21] said Carol Jean what in the world are
[1:14:23] you doing why Donnie this was made from
[1:14:26] the same pattern that you bought me it's
[1:14:29] Mall's number
[1:14:31] 6307 don't you remember you bought it
[1:14:33] down there in Somerset Kentucky at that
[1:14:36] fabric store well no I may not remember
[1:14:38] that but you're trying to tell me it's
[1:14:40] the same pattern as that one that you
[1:14:43] made the skirt off of two years ago five
[1:14:45] years ago you understand where I'm going
[1:14:48] don't you if it's the same pattern laid
[1:14:51] out on the same type of people people
[1:14:53] won't it do the same stuff won't it act
[1:14:57] the same way won't they believe the same
[1:15:00] stuff brother Jack if we get the pattern
[1:15:03] and we lay it out on the same type of
[1:15:06] fabric it will produce what Jesus Christ
[1:15:10] the same yesterday today and
[1:15:13] [Applause]
[1:15:22] forever the unchanging God with
[1:15:25] unchanging ways we can go back to the
[1:15:29] beginning and see the first and perfect
[1:15:31] ACT of God than judge by that
[1:15:38] standard praise the Lord that is how it
[1:15:41] is done so let's just be honest it makes
[1:15:45] no difference how big our church is
[1:15:46] makes no difference how nice the carpet
[1:15:48] is how nice everything looks that's not
[1:15:51] what God's going by if Our Lives don't
[1:15:54] match the pattern if them acts two
[1:15:56] Christians we'll miss the Rapture as
[1:15:59] sure as there's a God in heaven amen oh
[1:16:02] but Brother D I believe God said a
[1:16:04] prophet no you got to believe that plus
[1:16:06] you got to believe what that Prophet
[1:16:08] said will produce a holy
[1:16:10] life is that right now notice that is
[1:16:13] how it's done the true church will
[1:16:16] always try to be like the
[1:16:22] original
[1:16:23] did you say that out loud yes I did well
[1:16:28] my goodness are you a
[1:16:31] Pentecostal
[1:16:33] sir don't tell me we've got Pentecostals
[1:16:37] in here tonight Lord have
[1:16:42] mercy you mean the true church will try
[1:16:46] to be like that original
[1:16:49] church so at PA went they won't be
[1:16:58] going if Paul preached women ought to
[1:17:00] have long
[1:17:02] hair then what do you figure preachers
[1:17:04] of today is going to preach I tell you
[1:17:07] what some of them's going to preach
[1:17:09] nothing they ain't even going to mention
[1:17:11] it no they're not going to mention it
[1:17:14] well I'm afraid I'll run people off how
[1:17:16] do you know that ain't the very thing
[1:17:17] that'll bring them to the Lord
[1:17:22] God
[1:17:24] I listened to the testimony of a young
[1:17:26] man a while back this brother had been
[1:17:30] backslid away from the Lord he got in a
[1:17:33] real nervous State and he said God I've
[1:17:37] got to have some help I need help bad it
[1:17:41] wasn't where he needed to be with the
[1:17:42] Lord at the time so he didn't call the
[1:17:46] pastor he didn't go to the church in the
[1:17:49] area where he was but he went to a
[1:17:52] medical
[1:17:53] place not too far from where he lived so
[1:17:57] he goes in there he sore all the pieces
[1:17:59] his nerves is a bundle you know just
[1:18:01] tied up in knots he don't know what to
[1:18:03] do and just got a lot of trauma in his
[1:18:06] life he's sitting in there with his head
[1:18:09] down the door opens in walks a woman
[1:18:15] with a pair of sandals on he notices
[1:18:19] immediately her toenails ain't pink or
[1:18:23] or green or
[1:18:25] purple as he raises his head and he
[1:18:28] looks up at her and there stands this
[1:18:30] medical person in a
[1:18:34] dress long
[1:18:38] hair he told me the spirit of God oh he
[1:18:42] knew what he needed to do anyway but
[1:18:45] when he saw that example of the word
[1:18:49] walk into that office to be able to
[1:18:52] minister and to him she ministered unto
[1:18:55] him by her clothes before she ever wrote
[1:18:58] him a
[1:19:00] prescription Hallelujah tonight that man
[1:19:04] that young man is sitting back in the
[1:19:07] church where he's needed to be all along
[1:19:11] back in fellowship and it wasn't a
[1:19:13] preacher standing there pointing his
[1:19:15] finger in his face it was not somebody
[1:19:18] prophesying over him it was a daughter
[1:19:21] of God with her long dress and her long
[1:19:25] hair Hallelujah why a life live by the
[1:19:30] word is the word expressed sisters don't
[1:19:35] you let the devil intimidate you by the
[1:19:38] world you are a living
[1:19:41] [Applause]
[1:19:50] testimony oh my
[1:19:54] and remember when the prophet was
[1:19:55] carried beyond the curtain of time he
[1:19:58] saw no women in
[1:20:01] pants neither did he see any men in
[1:20:06] shorts W thank you
[1:20:09] Jesus I'll say it again if you wrinkle
[1:20:12] your nose too bad on me he didn't see no
[1:20:15] women in many skirts on there was no
[1:20:18] trans people there the only trans people
[1:20:22] were
[1:20:23] transformed a
[1:20:25] people I believe in that kind of transor
[1:20:29] I believe in being transferred from a
[1:20:32] homosexual to a son or daughter of God
[1:20:35] I'm being transferred from a cigarette
[1:20:38] suck and drunk oh my to a Son of God so
[1:20:41] full of the Holy Ghost that the devil
[1:20:44] don't want nothing to do with you the
[1:20:46] devil can't stand it cuz you're so much
[1:20:49] like
[1:20:51] Jesus
[1:21:03] the true church of today will try to
[1:21:04] approximate that early first one the
[1:21:07] messengers to the churches had the same
[1:21:10] spirit of God in them amen and Tred to
[1:21:13] approximate the Apostle Paul they won't
[1:21:16] be exactly like it but the true
[1:21:18] Messengers will be the ones that come
[1:21:20] the closest to Paul yes Lord
[1:21:23] who was free of all men sold out to God
[1:21:27] Gave for us a word of God only
[1:21:29] manifested the Holy Ghost and power none
[1:21:34] else would do you have to work from the
[1:21:42] original is there anybody in this
[1:21:44] building tonight dumb
[1:21:47] enough to
[1:21:49] believe this was made
[1:21:53] from an apron of an
[1:21:58] elephant you don't think so is there
[1:22:01] anybody here tonight lost your senses so
[1:22:04] much you can believe this was made from
[1:22:07] a pattern of blue
[1:22:15] jeans thank you so what would you want
[1:22:19] to suggest to me tonight that this was
[1:22:22] made from the pattern of

[1:22:32] outfit what boy your brothers are so
[1:22:35] vocal
[1:22:39] tonight so brother Tom horac
[1:22:43] says that no doubt the way he's looking
[1:22:46] at
[1:22:47] this this was made from a pattern of a
[1:22:51] handkerchief
[1:22:54] how many of you all would agree with
[1:22:55] brother
[1:22:58] Tom dear God some of y'all didn't raise
[1:23:00] your
[1:23:03] [Laughter]
[1:23:10] hands so somebody please explain to
[1:23:14] me how that we are producing message
[1:23:16] churches socalled message preachers
[1:23:18] so-called messing Christians so socalled
[1:23:21] that make fun of people with a Holy
[1:23:26] Ghost I know you don't understand it but
[1:23:29] there is a move right now around us
[1:23:31] friends that so against the move of
[1:23:36] God they're scared to death of
[1:23:39] emotion Oh Brother Don I'm scared bro
[1:23:41] going to get in the flesh I've been in
[1:23:43] it all my life I'm trying to get out of
[1:23:48] it oh Lord why why in the world would
[1:23:50] you want to lead people back to
[1:23:51] Pentecost I ain't leing back to
[1:23:53] Pentecost God's the one doing
[1:23:56] that I ain't talking about 1906 I'm
[1:23:59] talking about that
[1:24:00] original I realize what makes it hard is
[1:24:03] we've got two time frames called by the
[1:24:07] same
[1:24:08] name there was no two Lucen
[1:24:11] dispensations there was no two Wesleyan
[1:24:14] dispensation but we've got two called by
[1:24:17] the same name the original Pentecost and
[1:24:21] then the restoration of gifts and if
[1:24:23] we're not careful we will merge the two
[1:24:26] together and try to put them under the
[1:24:29] original
[1:24:34] name thank you
[1:24:37] Jesus brother how we going to judge it
[1:24:41] simple by the
[1:24:43] word any Spirit that'll lead you away
[1:24:46] from one scripture is not the Holy
[1:24:49] Ghost any spirit is is not of the Holy
[1:24:53] Ghost that won't lead you to God's
[1:24:57] word now let's jump down a bit he said
[1:24:59] you had to work from the original as
[1:25:01] like begets
[1:25:04] like the true church will always be the
[1:25:07] one that tries to follow in the steps of
[1:25:09] her Founders at
[1:25:14] Pentecost oh my goodness so you mean
[1:25:17] we're going to have to follow some
[1:25:21] men
[1:25:24] wow that sort of sounds like an army
[1:25:26] don't
[1:25:29] it some of y'all was in the military

[1:25:33] hands for Veterans Day and all that we

[1:25:54] against
[1:25:56] organization
[1:25:59] Hallelujah they'll send your parts home

[1:26:06] box

[1:26:12] journey tonight let me let the journey
[1:26:14] with me for a bit you got some time
[1:26:15] don't
[1:26:16] you now let's look at this New Testament
[1:26:19] Church let's look at the founder now
[1:26:21] Matthew 16 18 this is the founder
[1:26:23] himself and I say unto thee that thou
[1:26:26] art Peter and Upon This Rock I will
[1:26:28] build my
[1:26:29] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:26:33] Prevail against it so truly every church
[1:26:38] that you passed on your way to here
[1:26:40] tonight Jesus did not build
[1:26:45] it every message Church Jesus did not
[1:26:50] build it a lot of them are men built
[1:26:54] just like organizations are just built
[1:26:56] by man out of jealousy or whatever more
[1:27:00] I hope and pray by the grace of God ours
[1:27:03] is built by Jesus Christ himself if it
[1:27:06] isn't it'll never
[1:27:09] endure but the way we can check it is
[1:27:11] our foundation our motives our
[1:27:14] objectives are lined up with God's word
[1:27:16] so now Jesus said Upon This Rock I will
[1:27:19] build my church notice acts 1 vers vers
[1:27:22] one Luke of course wrote this and he
[1:27:24] said the former treaties have I made o
[1:27:27] Theophilus of all that Jesus began both
[1:27:30] to do and teach until the day in which
[1:27:33] he was taken after he had through the
[1:27:35] Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto
[1:27:39] the apostles whom he had chosen now
[1:27:42] notice here's the man himself the Lord
[1:27:45] Jesus who said on this rock I will build
[1:27:47] my church then Jesus transfers the
[1:27:51] Commandments
[1:27:52] unto the
[1:27:54] apostles notice acts 1 and3 to whom also
[1:27:57] he showed himself alive after his
[1:28:00] Passion by many infallable proofs being
[1:28:02] seen of them 40 days and speaking of
[1:28:04] things pertaining to the kingdom of God
[1:28:07] Acts chapter 2: 42 and they continued
[1:28:11] steadfastly
[1:28:16] in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship
[1:28:21] and breaking of bread and in prayers so
[1:28:25] here the original church was built upon
[1:28:28] the doctrine of the
[1:28:31] Apostles praise the Lord amen and what
[1:28:35] was that Doctrine what did they
[1:28:38] teach repentance baptism in the name of
[1:28:41] the Lord Jesus I've got a series I hope
[1:28:44] the Lord lets me preach to you before we
[1:28:46] get raptured if not we won't worry about
[1:28:47] it anyway but you know we have folks for
[1:28:49] years saying they're leaving the message
[1:28:51] so what I've been doing is taking by the
[1:28:54] scripture and accumulating and proving
[1:28:56] by the scripture every doctrine that we
[1:28:58] believe in the message new births by the
[1:29:02] scripture sanctification by the
[1:29:04] scripture baptism of the Holy Ghost by
[1:29:05] the scripture justification by Faith by
[1:29:08] the scripture Apostles Doctrine by the
[1:29:10] scripture and then when you come right
[1:29:13] down to it so say when you're leaving
[1:29:14] the message what do you leaving
[1:29:16] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:29:18] the Holy Ghost Holiness righteousness
[1:29:21] before God on and on and on it goes and
[1:29:24] it's true about a lot of them because
[1:29:26] you can see the way they dress when they
[1:29:27] leave it that's what they leave
[1:29:30] behind now watch in Ephesians 2:19 here
[1:29:33] Paul says now therefore ye are no more
[1:29:35] strangers and foreigners but fellow
[1:29:37] citizens with the Saints and of the
[1:29:41] household of God and are built upon the
[1:29:47] foundation of the Apostles and the
[1:29:49] prophet you mean the Lord Jesus
[1:29:52] is not the
[1:29:57] foundation
[1:30:04] hello are built upon the foundation of
[1:30:07] the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[1:30:11] himself being the Chief
[1:30:16] Cornerstone so the Chief Cornerstone is
[1:30:19] laid
[1:30:20] upon the
[1:30:23] foundation so what's the first building
[1:30:25] Stone of the New Testament Church the
[1:30:28] beginning of that New Testament Church
[1:30:31] is Jesus
[1:30:33] himself oh Hallelujah upon what the the
[1:30:37] apostles and the prophet are the
[1:30:40] foundation so from the Old Testament the
[1:30:43] coupling together of the prophets of the
[1:30:45] Old Testament and the Apostles of the
[1:30:47] New Testament then what did they do they
[1:30:50] laid upon that new dispensation the
[1:30:53] foundation block the first one which was
[1:30:56] Jesus Christ
[1:30:59] himself praise God in whom all the
[1:31:03] building fitly framed together
[1:31:07] growth unto a holy Temple in the Lord in
[1:31:12] whom ye also are builded together for an
[1:31:15] habitation of God through the spirit now
[1:31:18] this is Apostolic Doctrine that the Holy
[1:31:22] Ghost is to live in each of our souls
[1:31:25] and we are to become the very temple of
[1:31:28] God on the earth and we are a temple
[1:31:31] that grows together and moves together
[1:31:34] and flows together in the direction of
[1:31:37] God that's the way they moved can't you
[1:31:40] see why Satan loves contention Among Us
[1:31:44] and if he can't cause you adults to
[1:31:46] argue with one another he'll cause your
[1:31:48] kids to argue with one another which in
[1:31:50] turns make you all argue because of
[1:31:53] course each one of you is going to take
[1:31:54] up for your kids cuz most of you unlike
[1:31:57] me and Carol Alicia and Erica uh we got
[1:32:00] just regular human beings for our kids
[1:32:03] and they need to be corrected and
[1:32:04] whooped and all that sort of thing but I
[1:32:06] realize some of you had little angels
[1:32:08] which come down with little T90 Wings on
[1:32:11] their back and they flew around their
[1:32:13] crib room didn't they oh you did darling
[1:32:16] you y'all y'all was little young on they
[1:32:18] just flew around in the crib and they
[1:32:19] just co co angel tongues I reckon who
[1:32:23] you think you're fooling come on your
[1:32:25] children is as rotten as mine and mine
[1:32:28] was as rotten as yours was everyone born
[1:32:30] lost and on our way to hell and we
[1:32:32] needed to be regenerated by the spirit
[1:32:35] of God don't you go to putting a bunch
[1:32:37] of wings on the back of them young ones
[1:32:40] and convincing them they don't need the
[1:32:42] Holy Ghost you better tell them without
[1:32:44] the Holy Ghost they
[1:32:50] lost
[1:32:53] Ephesians chapter 3:5 which in other
[1:32:55] Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of
[1:32:58] men as it is now revealed unto His Holy
[1:33:01] Apostles and Prophets by the spirit
[1:33:05] second Peter 3:2 that you might be
[1:33:08] mindful of The Words which are spoken
[1:33:10] before by the holy prophets and of the
[1:33:16] Commandment yes sir do you understand
[1:33:18] Peter's words is not a suggestion
[1:33:22] Paul's Epistles are not
[1:33:25] suggestions they are the words of
[1:33:30] God Amen praise the
[1:33:33] Lord the Commandment of
[1:33:37] us the apostles wow what a
[1:33:41] statement of our Lord and
[1:33:46] savior now let's notice how did this
[1:33:49] Apostolic Ministry how did they work
[1:33:53] together how did they do acts
[1:33:57] 8:14 now when the apostles which were at
[1:34:00] Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[1:34:03] received the word of
[1:34:04] God they sent unto them Peter and
[1:34:13] John
[1:34:15] what so the apostles heard that Samaria
[1:34:18] had received the word of God and the
[1:34:22] Apostles sent
[1:34:27] preachers right now you see if we're not
[1:34:31] careful we're so against
[1:34:34] organization we will deny our Apostolic
[1:34:38] roots and breaking ranks from the
[1:34:41] original teaching of
[1:34:43] scripture thinking we're standing on
[1:34:45] what's right no no sir no sir no this is
[1:34:50] the original on
[1:34:52] Church well I'm sorry y'all didn't know
[1:34:54] this was in your Bible so you should
[1:34:56] spend more time in this book instead of
[1:34:58] on face
[1:35:02] book oh brother night that's only one
[1:35:04] scripture that's cuz I'm just getting
[1:35:06] started I got a lot
[1:35:09] more now notice in Samaria had received
[1:35:12] the word of God they sent it to them
[1:35:13] Peter and John Peter and
[1:35:15] John Peter and John were sent
[1:35:20] somewhere
[1:35:22] Acts 9: 26 when Saul was come to
[1:35:25] Jerusalem he Sav to join himself to the
[1:35:27] disciples but they were all afraid of
[1:35:29] him if you and I been living there we
[1:35:31] would have been too and believe not that
[1:35:33] he was a disciple they had good reason
[1:35:35] not to didn't they but I want you to
[1:35:37] notice how God brought Paul in to be
[1:35:41] able to get influence among the people
[1:35:43] now this is the church Aid's
[1:35:45] messenger now why he say glory to God I
[1:35:48] feel that of the Lord to you bunch of
[1:35:50] serpent seed if you you don't want to
[1:35:51] receive me that's up to you go to
[1:35:55] hell I want you to notice how this man
[1:35:58] being a preacher now you see a preacher
[1:36:01] that can't be taught is not a real
[1:36:04] leader at
[1:36:06] all he's a
[1:36:09] dictator come
[1:36:10] on now watch but
[1:36:14] Barnabas took
[1:36:18] him you mean to tell me that Paul the
[1:36:22] church age
[1:36:23] messenger submitted himself to a man of
[1:36:27] lesser understanding less calling less
[1:36:31] degree as far as the presence of God was
[1:36:33] concerned and let this lesser man
[1:36:36] introduce him that he could gain
[1:36:43] favor but Barnabas took him and brought
[1:36:48] him oh no
[1:36:53] to the apostles and declared unto
[1:36:58] them how he had seen the Lord in the
[1:37:03] way and that he had spoken to him and
[1:37:07] how he preached boldly at Damascus you
[1:37:09] imagine now Paul the great orator the
[1:37:12] prophet of God standing there Justin
[1:37:14] just
[1:37:15] listening or Barnabas is saying he's
[1:37:18] okay Brothers really honestly he okay
[1:37:21] the man got converted I mean God done
[1:37:23] this for him God done that for him Paul
[1:37:25] just
[1:37:30] in why didn't Paul say I'm going and
[1:37:32] I'll tell you one thing I'll go in and
[1:37:34] I'll show them I'm a man of
[1:37:37] God that's not Apostolic at
[1:37:41] all you know as I begin to study this
[1:37:44] really kind of made me wonder how many
[1:37:46] message Apostolic churches we
[1:37:50] got
[1:37:52] oh my notice in Acts chapter 9:28 and he
[1:37:56] was with them coming in and going out of
[1:37:58] Jerusalem he spake boldly in the name of
[1:38:00] the Lord Jesus and disputed against the
[1:38:02] grecians and they weren't about to slay
[1:38:05] now Paul was bold now which when the
[1:38:08] Brethren
[1:38:10] knew
[1:38:11] they brought him down to
[1:38:17] cesaria and sent him for
[1:38:20] us
[1:38:24] torous now I wonder how many preachers
[1:38:26] in our church could follow this
[1:38:28] Apostolic
[1:38:30] pattern wonder how many preachers and
[1:38:32] message
[1:38:35] churches and we claim or
[1:38:44] Apostolic well if you can't say Amen say
[1:38:47] pray for me brother
[1:38:49] d i 11:22 then Tidings of these things
[1:38:53] came into the ears of the church which
[1:38:56] was in
[1:38:57] Jerusalem and they sent
[1:39:02] forth Barnabas that he should go as far
[1:39:06] as
[1:39:08] Antioch well now wait a minute I thought
[1:39:11] I thought anybody the church would send
[1:39:14] forth was nothing but organization you
[1:39:17] haven't read your Bible
[1:39:20] enough
[1:39:23] so you see God has a divine
[1:39:26] order this is the Divine part I'm
[1:39:28] reading to you
[1:39:30] tonight and what did Satan do he tuck
[1:39:33] that and tried to mimic it and make an
[1:39:35] organization and raise it up in front of
[1:39:38] some of the message people that's been
[1:39:39] around it and makes them
[1:39:41] despise even God's
[1:39:45] protocol that's right they think they're
[1:39:47] rebelling against organization when in
[1:39:49] reality they're rebelling against
[1:39:51] against the very Bible that they hold in
[1:39:52] their hand when they stand up and preach
[1:39:54] and beat the pull pit
[1:39:56] with
[1:39:58] sir thank you
[1:40:00] Jesus y'all see me on the side of the
[1:40:03] road Friday I will preach for
[1:40:07] food notice in Acts 13:1 now there were
[1:40:11] in the church which was at Antioch
[1:40:12] certain prophets and teachers and now
[1:40:15] wait a minute I thought the Bible said
[1:40:16] the the prophets was under John and then
[1:40:19] after John there was no more prophets
[1:40:21] uh-huh shows you ain't called to
[1:40:24] preach notice now so there's certain
[1:40:26] prophets and teachers Barnabas and
[1:40:29] Simeon Kiger and Lucius of sirene and
[1:40:32] manine had been brought up with Herod
[1:40:34] the tetrarch and Saul as they ministered
[1:40:37] to the Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost
[1:40:42] said separate me Barnabas and Saul for
[1:40:45] the work where unto I have called them
[1:40:49] and when they had fasted and and prayed
[1:40:51] they laid their hands on them they sent
[1:40:55] them
[1:40:57] away
[1:40:59] wow so the Holy Ghost what was it doing
[1:41:02] from the church that God ordained out of
[1:41:05] that church is going to be birthed of
[1:41:10] Works don't you understand one of the
[1:41:12] reasons God does this this way is to
[1:41:15] keep out false prophets amen keep out
[1:41:18] false Shepherds keep out false
[1:41:21] evangelists false
[1:41:23] teachers if it didn't come from
[1:41:25] recommendation from the church of
[1:41:27] Jerusalem the people wouldn't hear
[1:41:30] [Music]
[1:41:30] [Applause]
[1:41:31] them oh I can say why a lot of preachers
[1:41:34] don't want this protocol it would show
[1:41:36] their wolfy
[1:41:39] hide well come on brother Donnie hey I I
[1:41:42] thought you folks believe the Bible I'm
[1:41:43] sorry anybody got a Donald Duck cartoon
[1:41:46] book you me to read from that you
[1:41:48] brother me preach to you about Barbie
[1:41:52] do you want the word do you do you want
[1:41:55] the
[1:41:56] [Applause]
[1:42:03] Bible oh my acts 14:21 and when they had
[1:42:07] preached the gospel to that City and had
[1:42:10] taught many they returned again to lisan
[1:42:12] Iconium and Antioch confirming the souls
[1:42:14] of the disciples exhorting them to
[1:42:16] continue in the faith that we must
[1:42:18] through much tribulation enter into the
[1:42:21] kingdom of God and when they had
[1:42:24] ordained them
[1:42:27] elders and every
[1:42:30] church I want somebody to stand right
[1:42:33] now show me chapter and verse where any
[1:42:37] church in the New Testament was ever
[1:42:40] established just to give a preacher more
[1:42:43] places to preach
[1:42:45] in that's not the apostolic pattern as a
[1:42:49] matter of fact a church was born then a
[1:42:52] preacher was sent to it never the other
[1:42:55] way that a preacher goes in and people
[1:42:58] rally around a personality right then it
[1:43:01] becomes a denomination around one
[1:43:06] man boy is it me is it is it off of
[1:43:09] warming here
[1:43:11] tonight when they had ordained them and
[1:43:14] their elders and every church so you
[1:43:16] mean actually from the
[1:43:18] church have you noticed in all these
[1:43:21] scriptures that we've read tonight
[1:43:22] there's not one spot where this man or
[1:43:25] that man or that woman or this person
[1:43:27] did it because they felt
[1:43:35] led if it didn't come from the original
[1:43:38] church it was not recognized as being
[1:43:41] from God amen
[1:43:46] amen
[1:43:47] amen praise the Lord
[1:43:54] so you see the ordination then of these
[1:43:57] ministers was an act not just by the man
[1:44:01] himself or the denominational board but
[1:44:05] Apostles prophets spirit-led
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:13] men a church wasn't
[1:44:16] started out of
[1:44:19] jealousy right that's right it was not
[1:44:21] started in competition or to bring
[1:44:25] division to the church at
[1:44:29] Jerusalem notice Titus 1 verse5 for this
[1:44:33] cause left I Thee in cre that thou
[1:44:36] should us set in order the things which
[1:44:39] are
[1:44:43] wanting and ordain Elders in every city
[1:44:45] now wait a minute whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:44:47] whoa
[1:44:47] whoa you mean this man right here
[1:44:51] is going to go out there and help the
[1:44:54] church get pastors now remember there's
[1:44:57] over 100 cities in the island of
[1:45:00] cre and Paul had started from the north
[1:45:02] and travel South and evangelized the
[1:45:04] whole
[1:45:05] island and before he could get Pastor
[1:45:08] set in there he had to leave and go
[1:45:09] somewhere
[1:45:10] else so he sent Titus back with
[1:45:15] Apostolic
[1:45:17] Authority amen amen and he told him now
[1:45:21] I want you to go back because there's a
[1:45:23] lot of things lacking there's no pastors
[1:45:25] here there's no pastors there where
[1:45:27] again where's these preachers raising up
[1:45:30] I feel L to go here I feel L to go over
[1:45:32] there I feel L to go over here Paul said
[1:45:34] hey before that gets started Titus you
[1:45:38] go you go among the people now remember
[1:45:41] he's not acting as a cardinal he's not
[1:45:44] acting as some bishop or some kind of
[1:45:46] denomination or something we know the
[1:45:48] way of God well enough to go enough to
[1:45:51] know that Titus did not go in there some
[1:45:53] sort of Archbishop and go to handpicking
[1:45:55] people he must have got together with
[1:45:57] the elders and with the church and says
[1:45:59] there anybody here that feels the call
[1:46:00] of God you know he would have never left
[1:46:03] the teaching brother Joel of that
[1:46:05] Apostle Paul he knew he could trust
[1:46:13] Titus oh my now this man was not even an
[1:46:19] apostle yeah I want you to notice I I
[1:46:21] found this amazing looking at the
[1:46:23] scripture he said that you might be able
[1:46:25] to set in order the things that are
[1:46:27] wanting now that actually comes from a
[1:46:30] medical term which means the setting of
[1:46:34] a crooked
[1:46:36] limb so here was churches on down
[1:46:39] through them that them cities one after
[1:46:41] another after another after another but
[1:46:43] they didn't have no
[1:46:45] pastors so Paul said there's something
[1:46:47] likeing wonder why they didn't just
[1:46:49] write down Paul's books and just
[1:46:50] distribute books among them and just
[1:46:52] have somebody stand up and read the
[1:46:53] books that way they get it straight from
[1:46:55] Paul's mouth oh Paul said it's a cooked
[1:46:59] limb it's a crooked limb I'll tell what
[1:47:02] you need to do Titus you need to go in
[1:47:05] and set them so Titus going
[1:47:09] to set that
[1:47:11] limb so he leave that one place to get a
[1:47:14] Elder established come on down to the
[1:47:15] next come on down to the next come on
[1:47:17] down to the next and wherever God sent a
[1:47:19] Revival notice what come first it was
[1:47:22] not the preacher going in to build
[1:47:23] himself a little kingdom it was the
[1:47:26] birth of a church under God called men
[1:47:28] which were not Kingdom Builders except
[1:47:31] the kingdom of Christ and then after
[1:47:33] they left then he sent another man in
[1:47:36] which was not a kingdom Builder and the
[1:47:38] the people caused the preacher to be
[1:47:41] called by
[1:47:42] God praise be to God so then it was not
[1:47:46] the big Mighty preacher standing glory
[1:47:49] to God I done this this and I done that
[1:47:51] and i' done something else and man I
[1:47:53] transformed this place uhhuh you see
[1:47:55] where we're going don't you but what was
[1:47:57] it that man was called on the scene
[1:48:00] because the bride in them cities
[1:48:03] Hallelujah and the spirit of God moved
[1:48:06] on Paul and said Paul set these things
[1:48:08] in order set him up Mur set an arm and
[1:48:10] set a leg and set a nose and this and
[1:48:13] that here come Titus down through there
[1:48:15] and ordaining the church would vote on
[1:48:17] it the church would vote on it it was
[1:48:19] not a
[1:48:23] dases praise be to
[1:48:27] God Titus 1 verse 6 these are the type
[1:48:32] of men that Paul instructed Titus about
[1:48:36] if any be
[1:48:42] blameless
[1:48:44] unreprovable that cannot be called into
[1:48:48] account unac accused
[1:48:52] innocent of
[1:48:56] wrongdoing I don't know that I'll ever
[1:48:58] forget
[1:48:59] it as I was called to preach at a
[1:49:02] convention many years ago many many
[1:49:06] hundreds of people
[1:49:08] there the host Pastor introduced me to a
[1:49:12] a preacher back off the stage before
[1:49:16] church said Brother D this is brother so
[1:49:18] and so I said how you doing brother I
[1:49:20] don't think I've ever met you before no
[1:49:22] no not been around that
[1:49:25] much
[1:49:27] so whenever I
[1:49:30] preached the Lord laid on my heart to
[1:49:32] preach about Satan's
[1:49:37] ambition so while I'm preaching I turn
[1:49:40] around to this
[1:49:42] man and I use the example that I used
[1:49:44] you a while ago about Satan wanted to be
[1:49:47] you know next to God so I had that man
[1:49:49] to stand up I said stand up
[1:49:51] brother I said so be like this brother
[1:49:54] right
[1:49:55] here he got tired of being an associate
[1:49:57] here in this church and say he wants to
[1:50:00] build his own church or whatever he
[1:50:02] wants to be a big guy in the
[1:50:05] message I said thank you
[1:50:08] brother so he sets back down sometime
[1:50:11] after that I'm preaching in another city
[1:50:13] many hundreds of miles away from that
[1:50:15] one this man is
[1:50:18] there he comes up to me after the
[1:50:21] service how you doing brother D you
[1:50:22] remember me I said yes I do remember
[1:50:26] you I remember what you preach up par I
[1:50:28] said really yeah yeah uh but I want to
[1:50:32] tell you me and some of the Elders of
[1:50:35] the church
[1:50:36] there we fixing to split the
[1:50:40] church I said
[1:50:43] brother
[1:50:44] why well we don't like this and we don't
[1:50:47] like that and you know some of the
[1:50:48] elders have come to me and they they
[1:50:51] they want me to
[1:50:57] Pastor I said I be very careful F you
[1:51:01] that's a man of
[1:51:03] God you going to answer to God for
[1:51:07] that well we we we feel led and we're
[1:51:10] going to we're going to
[1:51:12] okay well he tells me this about two
[1:51:15] weeks before they got a set date they've
[1:51:17] got this date set they've already got a
[1:51:19] building
[1:51:21] Ed so I come home and I pondered over it
[1:51:26] prayed about it and thought about it I
[1:51:29] called a little short dark-headed
[1:51:33] friend of
[1:51:37] mine I see right off there's no need to
[1:51:39] mention no
[1:51:41] names I tell him the scenario I said
[1:51:44] what what what what would you do well
[1:51:48] I'll tell you right now what I do I knew
[1:51:52] he would tell
[1:51:54] me that's my little
[1:51:57] buddy I'll tell you one thing if brother
[1:52:00] Daryl Ward or anybody at your church was
[1:52:03] going to do that to you I would
[1:52:05] certainly tell you well I said that's
[1:52:08] kind of what I was thinking but I I I
[1:52:10] didn't want to cause no trouble cause
[1:52:12] trouble well look at the trouble is
[1:52:14] fixing the C if you don't tell
[1:52:18] them so I call the brother make small
[1:52:22] talk how you been doing brother been a
[1:52:23] while since I talk you oh doing good
[1:52:24] brother D how you doing doing good how
[1:52:26] how's your church oh doing good I'll
[1:52:28] tell you what I said how how's brother
[1:52:30] so- and so doing oh brother Donnie I'll
[1:52:32] tell you what he's doing so good he has
[1:52:35] been such a blessing to me he's been
[1:52:37] such a blessing to the
[1:52:42] church and I said brother I hate to be
[1:52:44] the bearer of bad news but I just saw
[1:52:46] that man about two weeks ago I gave him
[1:52:49] the date I said on this date they're
[1:52:52] fixing to split your
[1:52:54] church now you know what amazed me about
[1:52:57] it was not just the man
[1:52:58] himself but some of the people who were
[1:53:01] part of this were Elders of that
[1:53:05] church now how could a man like this
[1:53:08] with sneaking around his pastor's back
[1:53:11] like a
[1:53:15] snake tell me how that man could meet
[1:53:18] this requirement right here of being
[1:53:20] blameless which is the very first
[1:53:23] requirement of a
[1:53:25] pastor it never ceases to amaze me how
[1:53:29] ignorant how ignorant that some people
[1:53:33] are when it comes to God's Bible and yet
[1:53:35] we pride ourself we know the church ages
[1:53:38] we know the Seven Seals we know this and
[1:53:40] that and the other and on some
[1:53:41] principles of the scripture we're Dumber
[1:53:45] denominations now do we believe this is
[1:53:48] the truth or not it ain't no wonder
[1:53:50] we've got churches in the message that
[1:53:53] don't even believe in Holiness no more
[1:53:54] do you understand there's some of the
[1:53:56] churches in the message that don't even
[1:53:58] believe in Holiness that do not believe
[1:54:00] in communion because the Lord has
[1:54:02] already come some of them don't even
[1:54:04] believe in the necessity of even going
[1:54:07] to church they don't even believe that
[1:54:09] the gospel nobody can be saved after
[1:54:12] 63 which means most of us are lost right
[1:54:17] why we got preachers wound up from the
[1:54:20] pulpit that was not called of
[1:54:29] God yes
[1:54:34] sir look at it wasn't enough for Paul to
[1:54:36] mention it in verse
[1:54:38] 6 he mentions it again in verse 7 for
[1:54:41] the
[1:54:42] bishop must be
[1:54:47] blameless and as I read this again this
[1:54:49] story come back to me cuz it's been one
[1:54:51] that's haunted me for
[1:54:55] years I never knew exactly why that man
[1:54:58] ever told me that he didn't know me
[1:55:00] really close enough to be a
[1:55:03] confidant but I've told this story
[1:55:05] around the world and I wondered if
[1:55:08] that's why the Lord let me know about
[1:55:12] it and you see it repeated over and over
[1:55:15] again I've heard of it in Africa I've
[1:55:17] heard of it in India I've heard it in
[1:55:18] South America
[1:55:21] especially in the last 6 months to a
[1:55:23] year it's like we go through cycles and
[1:55:26] that's the cycle that the message is in
[1:55:29] right
[1:55:30] now you hear preachers going in and
[1:55:33] causing all kinds of confusion and this
[1:55:35] and that and the other oh yeah I
[1:55:37] preached on this not long ago and one of
[1:55:38] our sisters sitting here come up crying
[1:55:40] with her husband because that same thing
[1:55:41] had just happened in their country I
[1:55:44] heard about it in Africa I've heard
[1:55:46] about it in Europe I've heard about it
[1:55:47] here and there and there and yet
[1:55:49] supposed
[1:55:51] Elders joining up with such a
[1:55:55] thing why don't believe the Bible and
[1:55:59] they sure don't believe the
[1:56:00] message that's the
[1:56:03] truth amen come on a bishop must be
[1:56:08] blameless as the steward of God not
[1:56:13] self-willed not soon anger now remember
[1:56:15] Titus would have went this is what Titus
[1:56:19] went with when he started at the top and
[1:56:22] went down through the island of creit
[1:56:25] looking for pastors of the
[1:56:29] churches it was not if the man could
[1:56:31] sing like a Mockingbird and he looked
[1:56:32] like an Elvis Presley and he had curly
[1:56:34] hair and he had this and that and the
[1:56:36] other if the man was as crossided as I
[1:56:38] don't know what and couldn't carry a
[1:56:40] tune in a lard bucket if the man was
[1:56:42] faithful not self-willed and the man was
[1:56:45] without reproach you tell me you tell me
[1:56:50] how could that man that I just described
[1:56:52] to you which did all this conniving and
[1:56:55] this
[1:56:56] evil ever be
[1:56:59] blameless and how could them people
[1:57:01] which had been around the message for
[1:57:05] decades ever want to be
[1:57:08] identified with such a
[1:57:11] man I can tell you why for part of them
[1:57:14] this one was going to get a position
[1:57:15] that one was going to get one that one
[1:57:17] was going to get one that one was going
[1:57:18] to get one
[1:57:20] come on
[1:57:21] now sir and let me tell you the result
[1:57:25] of that
[1:57:27] man he later
[1:57:30] backslid left his
[1:57:33] wife don't even serve God no
[1:57:41] more now I wonder where some of them
[1:57:44] Elders yes sir is going to stand and
[1:57:46] they stand before God and they're going
[1:57:48] to be identified
[1:57:50] on the wrong side of that
[1:57:54] situation
[1:57:55] why
[1:57:58] why we don't check it by
[1:58:02] this but what do we go
[1:58:05] by oh this is my friend this is my buddy
[1:58:08] it's Uncle so and so it's great grandpa
[1:58:10] so and so I don't care if it's your 13th
[1:58:12] cousin and your 14th uncle and your
[1:58:15] second whatever more you ought to judge
[1:58:17] every man by God's word
[1:58:19] me
[1:58:28] included every preacher in this church
[1:58:30] ought to be judged by the same thing if
[1:58:33] my life ever gets to a
[1:58:35] spot that it's not above reproach I hope
[1:58:39] you know what to do yes sir have a
[1:58:48] vote amen you don't remember the sermon
[1:58:51] I preached to several years ago how to
[1:58:53] get rid of a
[1:58:55] pastor who's still in the archive you
[1:58:57] can go back and listen to
[1:58:58] it but don't ain't you scared nope long
[1:59:01] as long as I live right I ain't scared
[1:59:02] at
[1:59:06] all it makes you wonder Friends when the
[1:59:09] eagle anointed goes to flying in the
[1:59:12] resurrection how many in our message
[1:59:14] churches will show up the Sunday Morning
[1:59:18] After
[1:59:19] the
[1:59:25] Rapture cuz we think it's enough to say
[1:59:28] I go to a message church I believe God
[1:59:30] sent a prophet every devil in hell
[1:59:32] believes the same thing as a matter of
[1:59:35] fact them devils are more faithful to
[1:59:36] church than a lot of you all are they
[1:59:38] don't take
[1:59:39] vacations they don't find out whether
[1:59:41] I'm going to be gone or not and it's
[1:59:43] another Dollywood weekend brother
[1:59:45] Donnie's out of
[1:59:48] town they believe
[1:59:51] it I don't want to just believe it I
[1:59:54] want to live it brother the
[1:59:57] GRE I want our church to be a word
[2:00:00] church look friend I know we've heard it
[2:00:01] for years many of you have heard it
[2:00:03] you've heard it and heard it and heard
[2:00:05] it but I'm telling you every day we're
[2:00:07] getting closer to the
[2:00:09] end look at our world look at Israel
[2:00:12] look at what's going on around us we
[2:00:14] better make sure amen that we are built
[2:00:18] up upon the solid rock of God's word I
[2:00:22] wonder if Paul Peter James John some of
[2:00:24] them bre would walk into some of our
[2:00:26] message churches and say you've got to
[2:00:28] be kidding
[2:00:32] me this is supposed to be a message
[2:00:41] Church
[2:00:43] stand if you can't get up you can just
[2:00:45] sit
[2:00:47] there if you're be eat a week you can't
[2:00:50] we'll excuse you
[2:00:54] tonight oh
[2:00:56] my how many loves the
[2:00:59] word praise the
[2:01:04] Lord praise the
[2:01:09] Lord oh
[2:01:12] my so I
[2:01:16] wonder when the eagle anointing
[2:01:19] goes to flying on the earth for the
[2:01:22] resurrection time the dead in Christ
[2:01:26] rise our loved ones will go to appearing
[2:01:28] before
[2:01:31] us I wonder how many
[2:01:34] people that have set in message churches
[2:01:37] profess to be message
[2:01:40] Believers yet in their
[2:01:44] hearts they can never really accept that
[2:01:47] word as their absolute
[2:01:51] and some of them that accept what they
[2:01:53] think as their version of the Bible and
[2:01:56] say well I really don't need a prophet's
[2:01:58] quotes I really don't have to preach
[2:02:00] that I just preach the
[2:02:03] Bible I I don't understand that myself
[2:02:07] how can we understand this Bible without
[2:02:10] the inside of a prophet's
[2:02:12] message this message does not come to
[2:02:14] give us another version of the Bible it
[2:02:17] gives us more information
[2:02:20] about the original
[2:02:22] Revelation don't you understand all that
[2:02:24] hit me the other day like a bol light
[2:02:26] and I nearly had an oldfashioned Holy
[2:02:28] Ghost spell I told Carol I want you to
[2:02:30] listen to this I said God never gave
[2:02:32] brother Bram another Revelation contrary
[2:02:34] to what Paul's PR contrary to the Bible
[2:02:37] it was only more information about the
[2:02:40] same thing to make it more real to us I
[2:02:44] don't know about you I needed more
[2:02:46] information but there we needed more
[2:02:50] information is that wonderful hallelujah
[2:02:53] praise God brother Manuel it gives us
[2:02:55] more information it's not contrary to
[2:02:57] what Paul said it's more
[2:03:01] information oh
[2:03:03] hallelujah how many wants to be an
[2:03:06] Apostolic Bible believing Holy Ghost
[2:03:09] Phill
[2:03:10] Christian me too thank you Lord me
[2:03:17] too heavenly
[2:03:21] father these words aren't easy to
[2:03:25] bring I know
[2:03:28] tomorrow oh my
[2:03:32] goodness help me
[2:03:35] tomorrow dear
[2:03:39] Jesus I pray you'd help each of
[2:03:44] us when the last sermon is preached the
[2:03:47] last song has been sung
[2:03:52] when the call is being made when you
[2:03:54] Gathering your
[2:03:56] Jewels May there not be a one of us left
[2:03:58] behind
[2:04:01] father dear God we want our church to be
[2:04:04] built upon your
[2:04:08] word I wouldn't even know how to
[2:04:11] estimate how many churches Christian
[2:04:13] churches socalled that there would be in
[2:04:15] the tric Cities area hundreds if not
[2:04:17] thousands
[2:04:21] more than likely every one of them think
[2:04:22] they're built on the
[2:04:25] Bible you're the
[2:04:29] judge all but those good people go
[2:04:33] there people don't take the Rapture
[2:04:36] because they're so-called good
[2:04:38] people they take the Rapture by the
[2:04:43] word oh Father we don't want to just be
[2:04:46] good
[2:04:47] people we want to to be your
[2:04:50] people cuz when you was on the earth you
[2:04:53] said there is none good not
[2:04:58] one but I hear it so much I get sick of
[2:05:01] it good people good people good
[2:05:08] people ain't none of us any
[2:05:11] good if you don't change us and make us
[2:05:14] like
[2:05:17] you What In Me Is any good what in any
[2:05:20] of these people is any good unless you
[2:05:24] make us good we're
[2:05:29] lost father we don't want the pattern
[2:05:33] laid across our life our life our
[2:05:35] humanity is the goods and the pattern
[2:05:38] will stretch across us and if the
[2:05:41] pattern was a
[2:05:42] handkerchief and we come out looking
[2:05:45] like a
[2:05:47] jacket something bad bad
[2:05:50] wrong if the pattern was a jacket and we
[2:05:53] come out looking like a
[2:05:56] handkerchief and we say well we're a
[2:05:58] good
[2:05:59] person I'm a Christian I'm a
[2:06:04] Believer yet Our Lives don't match the
[2:06:07] pattern where will we be
[2:06:11] Lord help us
[2:06:14] Jesus God I pray every man every woman
[2:06:19] every boy and every girl those that are
[2:06:21] streaming tonight those that are sick
[2:06:24] wanted to be here and couldn't be may
[2:06:27] you minister to every heart begin with
[2:06:30] me tonight Lord
[2:06:33] Jesus and then move to every preacher
[2:06:37] that's in this place and every preacher
[2:06:40] that'll hear
[2:06:42] this may we realize your Prophet told us
[2:06:45] in
[2:06:46] 1965 three times in the
[2:06:49] Bible it was an unpardonable
[2:06:54] sin to add one word of your own
[2:06:57] interpretation to a message after it had
[2:07:00] been
[2:07:01] Vindicated to be the
[2:07:04] truth so every preacher who stands
[2:07:07] behind his
[2:07:09] pulpit and adds or takes
[2:07:12] away from the message of the
[2:07:15] hour will be judged at the day of
[2:07:18] judgment
[2:07:22] dear God hide
[2:07:24] me I pray you would take me off the
[2:07:28] Earth before I would fall
[2:07:31] away Lord I've been serving you for 55
[2:07:35] years
[2:07:38] now preaching for many many many
[2:07:42] years baptized hundreds buried hundreds
[2:07:46] preached thousands of sermons what good
[2:07:49] but all of that do to come down to the
[2:07:52] end and deny this word or that word or
[2:07:55] another word go to adding a sleeve to a
[2:07:58] handkerchief adding a cuff adding a
[2:08:01] collar adding this and that and the
[2:08:05] other oh God help
[2:08:07] me help me
[2:08:11] Jesus I know you don't want us to serve
[2:08:14] you by ungodly fear but we know that
[2:08:17] there is a fear
[2:08:20] that you want your people to have for it
[2:08:22] is the beginning of knowledge and the
[2:08:23] beginning of wisdom it's evident many of
[2:08:26] the message people have lost all
[2:08:30] fear they'll talk about a servant of God
[2:08:32] they'll run him down they'll spread lies
[2:08:34] on him and others will believe it and
[2:08:38] spread it not realizing they're taking a
[2:08:42] knife and stabbing him in the back and
[2:08:44] they are guilty of
[2:08:47] murder and they will will stand before
[2:08:49] God as a
[2:08:51] murderer it's evident a lot of our young
[2:08:54] people have moved away from Fear they
[2:08:58] listen to music they shouldn't listen to
[2:09:00] they watch movies they shouldn't watch
[2:09:02] they do different things that they
[2:09:03] shouldn't do and it don't even bother
[2:09:05] them no more or just waiting till the
[2:09:08] next Youth Camp to get all fired
[2:09:11] up but Lord what if you come in between
[2:09:14] youth
