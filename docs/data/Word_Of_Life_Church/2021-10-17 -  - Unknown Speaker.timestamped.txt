[32:05] we cherish it
[32:06] and the meetings and louisiana the lord
[32:08] really helped and brother ron brother
[32:10] wayne did an outstanding job
[32:12] they said that some of the people that
[32:14] had visited the
[32:15] services there hadn't been able to be in
[32:17] church actually physically in church for
[32:20] two years
[32:22] two years
[32:24] so
[32:25] even though we've had it hard yet we've
[32:27] been able to come to church so thank the
[32:29] lord for that
[32:31] are you here today expecting the lord to
[32:34] just give you something in your heart
[32:35] your life how many knows we need we need
[32:37] him we need his help and need his
[32:39] guidance
[32:40] let's turn to ephesians chapter one
[32:43] if you would
[32:45] i certainly want to continue to remember
[32:48] those that are sick and some
[32:50] aren't feeling well today
[32:52] reason they haven't been here to church
[32:55] and um
[32:57] after the meeting there brother tim
[32:59] several got sick actually brother tim
[33:02] cancel their service again today for the
[33:04] jason watkins as well they'll be
[33:06] resuming lord willing next week and i
[33:08] have
[33:09] several in their assembly that's sick so
[33:11] we want to pray for them as well
[33:14] god would just
[33:15] move for them
[33:16] help them
[33:18] ephesians chapter 1 verse 22 and 23 and
[33:22] then we'll read chapter 2
[33:23] verse 6 and 7.
[33:25] i hope you don't mind me reading these
[33:26] things i've read these scriptures for a
[33:28] couple of different times but
[33:31] if we could understand it what we're
[33:33] about to read actually here today is
[33:36] christ
[33:37] the mystery of god
[33:39] revealed
[33:40] this was part of his entire purpose
[33:44] from eternity what we're fixing to read
[33:46] about
[33:48] as put all things under his feet
[33:50] and gave him to be the head
[33:53] over all things to the church
[33:56] which is
[33:58] his body
[34:00] so the church
[34:02] is the body
[34:04] the fullness of him that filleth all
[34:08] in all
[34:09] chapter 2 verse 6
[34:11] and has raised us up together made us
[34:14] sit together
[34:16] in heavenly places
[34:18] in christ jesus
[34:20] that in the ages to come
[34:23] he might show the exceeding riches
[34:26] of his grace
[34:28] and his kindness toward us
[34:31] through christ jesus verse 10
[34:35] for we are his workmanship
[34:38] created in christ jesus unto good works
[34:42] which god has before ordained
[34:46] that we should walk in them well if he
[34:49] ordained that i do it i want to do it
[34:51] with all of my heart
[34:53] chapter 5 verse 23
[34:56] the great conclusion now
[34:58] of this mystery
[35:00] for the husband is the head of the wife
[35:03] even as christ is the head of the church
[35:06] he is the savior
[35:08] of the body
[35:09] the savior
[35:11] of
[35:12] the body and then paul goes on down on a
[35:14] few verses and he tells us that as
[35:17] christ loved the church so men
[35:19] also to love their own wives for he that
[35:23] loveth himself loveth his wife
[35:27] catching from the great mystery of what
[35:29] god had gave to adam in the garden of
[35:31] eden
[35:32] whenever he looked at his wife and said
[35:34] you are now born of my bone and flesh of
[35:36] my flesh in other words you are me
[35:40] in another expression
[35:42] and this is what the lord
[35:44] intended that his church
[35:47] should be
[35:48] how many has a need today in your heart
[35:50] request on your heart can we just take
[35:52] it before the lord
[35:54] father we love you so much today
[35:57] we are so honored to be in your place
[36:00] here that we have set aside
[36:02] called a church
[36:04] we know lord that the building is not
[36:06] the church but it's the people
[36:08] but this building has been hallowed or
[36:10] sanctified
[36:12] set apart that we could come here to
[36:14] sing to worship to pray
[36:17] to be able to be called the house of god
[36:20] father we're asking you now that you
[36:22] would help us our needs are many but our
[36:25] god is greater than all of our needs put
[36:27] together
[36:28] lord we have so many requests and needs
[36:32] and father my heart
[36:33] now going to different parts of the
[36:35] country even around the world
[36:37] or just hearing of another pastor
[36:40] passing away this morning and lord
[36:43] different ones that are very sick lord
[36:46] brother jason to mars in the hospital
[36:48] and i see you and certainly needing to
[36:51] touch from you today father
[36:53] different ones lord and we're praying
[36:55] that your great hand would reach to them
[36:58] in kindness and in mercy some not here
[37:01] today father because they're not feeling
[37:03] well some being exposed and lord they
[37:06] felt it would be safer for the rest of
[37:08] the saints if they didn't come so we
[37:10] pray that you bless them even as they
[37:12] sit at home and stream the service today
[37:15] for those of us that are present we
[37:17] acknowledge to you lord god
[37:20] that we need you so much
[37:24] lord most of my life i've been living
[37:27] for you
[37:28] but i need you now
[37:30] more than ever before
[37:32] i need you every day
[37:34] every hour lord jesus
[37:37] i'm so thankful
[37:39] that you've opened your word to our
[37:41] hearts once again will you
[37:43] speak to us today these great truths
[37:46] bring us into a great union and harmony
[37:49] i ask in the name of the lord jesus
[37:53] and the saints said amen
[37:55] god bless you you may be seated
[38:02] two major images given in the bible
[38:07] the church is a family
[38:10] the church
[38:11] is a body
[38:13] both mystical
[38:15] and natural local assemblies
[38:19] we can see this pictured in the book of
[38:21] acts
[38:22] as the lord god baptized
[38:24] the first human beings
[38:27] with the holy ghost outside of jesus
[38:29] christ in acts chapter 2.
[38:32] when the day of pentecost was fully come
[38:35] they were all in one place
[38:37] one accord there the spirit of god
[38:40] began to move on these people's souls
[38:43] and capture them and captivate their
[38:46] beings
[38:47] and perform what the lord jesus had
[38:50] announced
[38:51] that would come
[38:52] and that was a new birth
[38:55] it was a marvel even that nicodemus
[38:59] heard this first idea of a new birth and
[39:02] said how can a man
[39:04] when he is old enter the second time
[39:08] into his mother's womb you can imagine
[39:10] that if you would have been there and
[39:11] heard the lord jesus say
[39:13] except a man be born again
[39:16] he cannot see or understand the kingdom
[39:19] of heaven
[39:20] in his mind him thinking born again the
[39:22] second time enter into my mother's womb
[39:25] how can that be and jesus said you being
[39:27] a teacher in israel and you don't
[39:29] understand these things
[39:31] but we know that the mystery of it was
[39:33] not even really made clear by the lord
[39:36] jesus himself in the form of teaching
[39:40] it was going to be made clearer in the
[39:43] form of experience
[39:46] we can teach the new births we can have
[39:48] quotes and scriptures and theology but
[39:52] it will never be clear to the human
[39:54] heart the human soul until one
[39:57] experiences that for themselves
[40:00] once it happens to them then they don't
[40:03] really need just to be able to read
[40:05] about it but they have experienced it on
[40:08] their own i trust everybody in this
[40:10] building today has had that to happen to
[40:13] you
[40:14] we can hear it sung about preached about
[40:17] talked about read but yet when one knows
[40:20] that they have passed from death unto
[40:23] life their soul has been brought into
[40:25] the original image that adam had in the
[40:28] beginning an image of oneness that could
[40:32] only be received by the breasts of god
[40:35] so you can sign your name on a church
[40:37] book shake a preacher's hand go to a
[40:39] beautiful church large assembly or small
[40:42] whatever it would be that doesn't mean
[40:44] bring you in to the spiritual body of
[40:47] the lord jesus there's only one way to
[40:49] get there and that is by according to
[40:52] what paul said in first corinthians for
[40:54] by one spirit are we all baptized or
[40:57] immersed into that mystical spiritual
[41:01] body but yet the mystical part of the
[41:04] family of god does not do away from the
[41:08] local assemblies for we see immediately
[41:11] after the church received the holy ghost
[41:14] then we see they started gathering
[41:17] together on what was called the first
[41:20] day of the week so the mystical part was
[41:24] that which could not be seen but the
[41:27] mass the nature the natural aspect of it
[41:30] was they started gathering in homes or
[41:32] gathering in buildings and then from
[41:34] there it became called the church so
[41:37] paul by the time he wrote some 30 years
[41:40] later after the day of pentecost he
[41:42] would address the church which was in
[41:44] this one's house or the church in that
[41:47] one's house or to the church of corinth
[41:50] now they didn't name their churches what
[41:53] we do today word of life tabernacle word
[41:56] of life church or even light tabernacle
[41:59] but actually mainly for the most part
[42:02] initially when the churches started they
[42:04] were called the church of laodicea the
[42:07] church of ephesus the church of
[42:10] philadelphia so they were called the
[42:12] church or the gathering place in a
[42:15] certain city then as the churches began
[42:17] to grow and they would have one and then
[42:20] another and another then they would take
[42:22] on another name and they would begin
[42:24] identified as what we know today so
[42:27] today we call them the missionary
[42:28] baptist or the faith baptist or this or
[42:31] that or the other or happy valley church
[42:33] why we call that because years ago when
[42:36] the church moved here from roan hill
[42:38] they took on the identity of this
[42:40] particular place where we are located
[42:43] happy valley so we call it happy valley
[42:46] church of jesus christ and what does
[42:48] that identify that does not identify the
[42:51] mystical body but that identifies this
[42:54] local assembly that we have here so in
[42:58] the picture of the family of god we can
[43:00] see how the lord jesus wants to continue
[43:04] his work in this body called the church
[43:08] so the church is the wife now when i say
[43:11] that i don't mean everybody that is
[43:13] called church because we know there's
[43:15] two churches one of them is the true
[43:17] church of the living god the other are
[43:19] imposters actually they gather together
[43:22] they call themselves church but the lord
[43:24] jesus is not their head they have men as
[43:28] their head men vote them in men vote
[43:30] them out men sin here they've been to
[43:32] this so it's actually men but the lord
[43:34] jesus desires a body that will be his
[43:38] own masterpiece in the making and they
[43:41] will be a group of people that will be
[43:43] gathered together under his auspices in
[43:46] other words they do not have a
[43:48] denominational headquarters and the
[43:50] bishops and the overseers say okay you
[43:52] all do this and you all do that and you
[43:54] all do something else and we're moving
[43:56] this pasture from this location to this
[43:58] one and we're setting this guy there no
[44:00] the bible tells us the holy ghost sent
[44:03] them out to preach
[44:05] so it was not a gathering of people
[44:08] that's the church we believe in today
[44:10] now the lord jesus desires to continue
[44:13] that same work that he started in the
[44:16] book of acts let's change over brother
[44:17] eric to the handheld whenever he started
[44:20] that out
[44:21] okay battery's dead on this
[44:25] harry come help me the lord jesus
[44:27] started that out in the mystical body
[44:30] get off her hair gunner and change
[44:31] batteries for me and the top drawer on
[44:32] the right in the mystical body that
[44:35] would be baptized by the holy ghost in
[44:37] that he made five different diversions
[44:40] of how he would minister to the saints
[44:43] of god and we call it the fivefold
[44:45] ministry the lord of course did not have
[44:47] that in the old testament but he had
[44:50] mainly prophets and judges by which he
[44:53] would speak to the people then he
[44:54] ordained a priesthood which would bring
[44:57] the sacrifices from the lord from the
[44:59] people rather into the presence of the
[45:01] lord but in the new testament the lord
[45:04] decided to go a different way so he's
[45:07] not going to have a levitical priesthood
[45:10] he's not going to have judges but he's
[45:12] going to have ministry that will come
[45:15] and minister to the saints of god and of
[45:18] course we know there's apostles prophets
[45:20] evangelists pastors and teachers they
[45:23] are to be
[45:24] the living
[45:25] representation of the voice of god in
[45:29] every age now we know that he would have
[45:31] one major prophet that would appear once
[45:35] in an age that would come and speak to
[45:37] the saints of god he would catch the
[45:39] mind of god and the word logos of course
[45:42] means the mind of god or the mandate of
[45:45] god for the day and a major prophet
[45:47] would catch that from god and then the
[45:50] other ministry would go out from
[45:52] underneath that one apostles and
[45:54] teachers and so on and they would begin
[45:56] to replicate what god had given to that
[46:00] pastor then god would continue the same
[46:03] work that he started in the book of acts
[46:06] so god has not changed his format at all
[46:09] but it's exactly the same yesterday
[46:12] today and forever so he started it out
[46:15] in the book of acts the way he wanted it
[46:18] now he's going to manifest himself in
[46:21] the form of apostles of prophets
[46:24] evangelists pastors teachers and that is
[46:26] actually going to be god's way that he
[46:30] will close himself in the form of an
[46:34] army inside his body on the earth so god
[46:38] will represent himself in the form of
[46:41] these five offices and these five
[46:44] offices will represent the way that god
[46:47] will minister to the body now that does
[46:50] not mean that the body is not important
[46:52] within itself because in the body will
[46:55] be there will be diversities of
[46:57] government there will be all kinds of
[46:59] aspects in the body and keeping your in
[47:02] your mind because you're not a preacher
[47:05] does not mean that you are not important
[47:07] to the mystical body and also the local
[47:11] body so what if we do away with
[47:13] everybody here today that's not
[47:14] preachers we're going to have about
[47:16] three or four people that are sitting
[47:18] here in this body so god does not mean
[47:22] that just because you're not a preacher
[47:24] that you're a laity that you're not
[47:26] important you are very important to the
[47:29] body and nobody can take your place and
[47:32] the church said
[47:34] why because that's the way god
[47:37] designated then in that god would have
[47:39] those that would be given certain
[47:41] abilities some would sing some would be
[47:43] used in the office of ministry some
[47:46] would be used in the office of
[47:47] administration they would be there to
[47:49] help and we know of course there was no
[47:51] deacons in the old testament but
[47:53] whenever the diversity of the government
[47:56] of the body changed then the the
[47:58] apostles themselves they said it's not
[48:01] right that we should wait on tables
[48:03] because there was widows and there was
[48:05] people that was not getting their needs
[48:07] met and the ministry was being pulled in
[48:10] that way and the apostles said it's not
[48:12] right that we should be pulled away from
[48:14] the word and then we should wait on
[48:16] tables you've got these needs so they
[48:18] didn't say well you know the widows are
[48:20] not important and the the homeless are
[48:23] not important they did not believe that
[48:25] they believed they were important but
[48:27] they said what we need we need to
[48:30] designate a new member in the body of
[48:33] christ that will start administering to
[48:35] these offices and they come up with the
[48:38] greek word dickiness which is deacon now
[48:41] from that it means the word minister or
[48:44] one that will minister to
[48:46] so then we find that the deacons were
[48:49] placed into the body and they started
[48:51] ministering to what more to the natural
[48:54] needs now deacon of course can be apt to
[48:56] teach and all that but it certainly does
[48:58] not mean that a deacon is to be a
[49:00] preacher but the deacon is to minister
[49:03] to the people on their everyday level
[49:05] and if they've got needs and they're
[49:07] lacking of this and that and the other
[49:09] and god orchestrated that in the body
[49:12] and it was something that god has never
[49:14] taken away to this day now initially
[49:16] even the first few years of the early
[49:18] church they never had what we have today
[49:21] and that is the office of a trustee
[49:24] because the church did not own any
[49:27] property but as the church began to grow
[49:29] and they had houses and they had church
[49:31] buildings and so on then there was a
[49:33] need for trustees especially dealing
[49:35] with the banks of course in this day the
[49:38] banks want a board of trustees so it's a
[49:41] board of men that are able to be
[49:43] responsible for the finances of the
[49:45] church so as the church grew then things
[49:47] began to happen why you'd have never
[49:49] been able to probably convince peter and
[49:52] james and john that one day preachers
[49:54] would be able to stand in the pulpit
[49:56] like we are today and at the same time
[49:59] that you are hearing my voice here in
[50:01] johnson city tennessee there are people
[50:03] in canada and france and in norway in
[50:06] europe and africa all over the world in
[50:09] a few seconds after i say these words
[50:12] they're hearing it as well so then what
[50:14] do we need well if we've got that
[50:16] technology we have to have people in the
[50:19] body that understand how to fix that
[50:22] technology i'm glad it ain't dependent
[50:24] on me because i'll tell you one thing if
[50:27] it was left up to me to know how to do
[50:29] streaming and all that i don't know one
[50:31] thing about it and the majority of you
[50:33] don't either do you but yet we're glad
[50:36] that we can do it and then what did god
[50:39] do god give us people not only in our
[50:41] assembly but in assemblies around the
[50:43] world that would know how to do such
[50:46] things so as the need arose then god
[50:49] would facilitate that by people in that
[50:52] body that would help minister to that
[50:54] particular need now i realized some of
[50:56] these are unseen folks some of you don't
[50:58] even know who takes care of the internet
[51:00] whenever it's down all you know is
[51:02] whenever you can't get on there you get
[51:04] mad and aggravated or you try to get on
[51:07] there and you're buffering all the time
[51:08] and whatever more and you contact
[51:10] whoever you think is in charge and you
[51:13] want it fixed i mean right now asap you
[51:16] don't want to waste no time you want it
[51:18] done but yet if it was not for people
[51:21] behind the scenes that knew how to do
[51:23] that where would we all be and it's the
[51:26] same way in the spiritual sense of the
[51:28] body that god can move on some people's
[51:30] hearts they may never get up and sing
[51:33] they may never get up and prophesy or
[51:36] preach a sermon but yet they are prayer
[51:38] warriors and god will wake them up in
[51:40] the wee hours of the morning and put
[51:42] brother daryl on their heart by the west
[51:44] or some of his other brothers or myself
[51:47] and they don't even know why they may
[51:49] never get any credit as we call it in
[51:52] this life and some positions in the body
[51:56] are those that do not render a bunch of
[51:58] glory but it is unseen it is almost as
[52:02] if it is not there except for those who
[52:05] are part of it and those that receive
[52:08] the benefit from doing it aren't you
[52:10] glad god does it that way
[52:12] there are some in the church and it
[52:14] seems as if though they are the ones
[52:16] that get so much of the honor and the
[52:18] glory and you remember there was
[52:20] instances by which the prophet would go
[52:22] into a city and he would have great
[52:24] meetings and my the blind would be be
[52:26] able to see the lame wall and brother
[52:29] random would give credit not only to
[52:31] himself and say well i've done this i'm
[52:32] the prophet and i've done that but he
[52:35] would mention those people that were
[52:37] praying for the meetings and he would
[52:39] mention those that had fasted for days
[52:42] on end before he came to their city and
[52:46] god took their prayer and their
[52:48] sincerity and some of the folks that day
[52:51] that received their healing it wasn't
[52:53] just because brother branham was there
[52:56] but it was coupled together with those
[52:59] who had a burden on their heart for
[53:01] their city or for their church don't you
[53:04] understand friend that the preacher does
[53:06] not bring revival in his briefcase the
[53:09] preacher does not bring a great stirring
[53:12] in his briefcase to the church but
[53:14] sometimes it can be a little sister or a
[53:16] little brother in the church and heart
[53:18] and nobody even knows that they're there
[53:20] but god lays a burden on their heart
[53:22] lord we need a stirring in our church
[53:25] god we've got sick people in our church
[53:27] lord we need a visitation of healing in
[53:30] our church and yet the spirit of god may
[53:33] move and people come up and are prayed
[53:34] for maybe i lay hands on him brother
[53:37] west does one of the other minister
[53:38] brothers here and we lay hands on them
[53:40] and you see god heal them and you
[53:43] totally attribute it to that because
[53:45] brother joel brown laid his hands on
[53:47] somebody's head and they turn in their
[53:49] testimony on wednesday night brother
[53:51] joel prayed for me and god healed me
[53:53] well thank god that brother joel had
[53:55] faith to do it but it might have been
[53:57] somebody else who also had a burden on
[53:59] their heart as well and yet we don't say
[54:02] well saint god sister so-and-so prayed
[54:05] why because it's just like the anatomy
[54:08] of the human body there's things about
[54:10] our body we have never seen we've never
[54:13] seen our insides we've never seen the
[54:15] parts that are absolutely so vital for
[54:18] life and yet take our heart out our
[54:20] kidneys out our liver many other things
[54:23] of us that's on the inside and we would
[54:25] no longer be able to live or exist it's
[54:28] the same way with the body there are
[54:30] people in the mystical body of christ
[54:34] and they will never be renowned oh you
[54:36] know your friend it's hard to imagine
[54:38] but i thank god for pastors in and
[54:41] around this message and many of them are
[54:44] not called to be convention speakers
[54:47] many of them will never step up before a
[54:49] great crowd of people and never be
[54:52] called by various brothers to come and
[54:54] preach a special meeting or come and
[54:56] speak at a convention they're just not
[54:58] called that way but yet they pastor
[55:01] their little small church 25 or 30 or 50
[55:03] or whatever it is they may never travel
[55:06] around the world they may never leave
[55:08] their own country and yet they're just
[55:10] as faithful as they can be and they
[55:13] serve the lord jesus with all of their
[55:16] heart and yet god may put on their
[55:18] hearts and they may be burdened for
[55:20] other men of god who are called to
[55:22] travel that way that is a great
[55:24] revelation from god that a person can
[55:27] hold an inferior smaller position and
[55:31] still be able to acknowledge those that
[55:34] as we would say may be greater gifted
[55:37] than they are and not be jealous well i
[55:39] wish somebody would preach with me today
[55:42] but it's always something about the
[55:44] human race especially after adam fell
[55:47] and threw us into this thing of
[55:49] competitiveness and how do we look at
[55:52] this man and it's so hard for us many
[55:54] times to see people that are gifted
[55:57] above us or better than us and not to
[56:00] feel some sort of resentment or a little
[56:03] bit of jealousy now if y'all get any
[56:05] quieter on me than what you are now i
[56:07] don't know how i'm going to be able to
[56:08] finish this
[56:09] but i want you to notice that it is a
[56:11] great thing to acknowledge in the body
[56:14] of the lord jesus that there are some
[56:17] that are so gifted my goodness i hear
[56:20] some preachers preach and i say wow it
[56:22] ain't no wonder that they're called on
[56:23] to preach so much because they're so
[56:26] gifted others that can sing and they
[56:28] just sing and sing and sing and i'm
[56:31] saying if i could sing like that that's
[56:33] probably all i do i just go around like
[56:35] a mockingbird i'd just sing at 24 7. i'd
[56:38] sing in my sleep i'd sing when i'm
[56:40] eating i'd sing i'd just sing sing sing
[56:43] so i guess that's why the lord didn't
[56:45] give me too well to sing but i'm glad
[56:47] that if we've got people like that
[56:49] aren't you but yet for us to be able to
[56:53] acknowledge of what the lord does that
[56:55] when god gives people and places them in
[56:58] the body it is actually for the benefit
[57:01] of the body itself god does not give
[57:05] people just so that they can be looked
[57:08] up to and they can be acknowledged as
[57:10] this great so-and-so this great piano
[57:13] player this great guitar player this
[57:15] great singer but actually god places
[57:18] them in the body for the body
[57:22] is that right then god chose to minister
[57:25] in this way now we know that god created
[57:29] even in the beginning that god created
[57:31] by degrees now i know people don't like
[57:33] this but actually still in heaven when
[57:36] we roll back into eternity where we came
[57:39] from there will still be degrees in
[57:42] eternity but the difference is we will
[57:45] not have the human element which cannot
[57:48] take degrees very well there will be
[57:52] degrees and there were degrees and
[57:54] angels there were cherubims there were
[57:57] seraphims there were zooms that were
[58:00] angels which were called by paul elect
[58:03] angels and there were other angels which
[58:06] were put on a place of probation listen
[58:10] to me now and they were actually
[58:13] creative so they are not of eternal
[58:15] essence so they were angels which were
[58:18] created remember lucifer was created
[58:22] thou was perfect from the day that thou
[58:25] was created so lucifer amen had a day
[58:29] that he began
[58:31] he had a day when he started and he'll
[58:34] have a day when he will end
[58:37] that's right but there are other angels
[58:40] which were not created out of time
[58:43] substance they were not brought into
[58:46] view and they were actually elect angels
[58:49] and you and i i hope you understand this
[58:51] our theophany body is a part of that
[58:53] supernatural element of the angelic host
[58:57] which never failed in the beginning so
[58:59] it is our angel in the presence of god
[59:03] then god wanted to have a body on the
[59:06] earth that would be able to carry out
[59:08] his work so they would minister to the
[59:10] sick they would preach the word they
[59:12] would be able to just not only do that
[59:15] now for the church body but they would
[59:17] have a heart for fallen humanity now you
[59:21] know i realized a lot of folks get so
[59:23] caught up in humanitarian aid and they
[59:26] think that the church of the living god
[59:27] basically that's what the church is all
[59:29] about it's not just about humanitarian
[59:32] aid but neither should we be so
[59:34] spiritual that we don't care about the
[59:37] human needs of those around us one of
[59:40] these days at the day of judgment when
[59:41] we stand there and all will be unfolded
[59:45] of what this church has done around the
[59:47] world you're going to find out that
[59:49] we've not just printed books and we've
[59:51] not just duplicated tapes and sent out
[59:53] things but we have done things in a
[59:56] humanitarian way we've drilled water
[59:59] wells we've made them available for
[1:00:01] communities in africa and they were not
[1:00:03] just available for the saints of god but
[1:00:06] they were available for any thirsty
[1:00:08] human being that needed to drink
[1:00:11] we've sent medicine we've done different
[1:00:13] things in vietnam and different parts of
[1:00:16] the world why because i care for
[1:00:19] humanity i don't just care for you oh
[1:00:22] you say well we should think about our
[1:00:24] own we want to put our own first but
[1:00:27] remember the lord jesus does not just
[1:00:30] save his own but he saves those in the
[1:00:33] book of life which are not his own
[1:00:36] so he cares for others you see if satan
[1:00:39] can get us so locked in that all we care
[1:00:42] about is this this group then we'll
[1:00:44] narrow it down to just this family and
[1:00:47] then it'll come on down to our family
[1:00:49] and it keeps getting smaller and smaller
[1:00:51] and smaller but the love of god is so
[1:00:54] great it'll take eternity for us to
[1:00:57] really understand and comprehend how
[1:01:00] much god so loved the world
[1:01:04] that he gave his only begotten son not
[1:01:06] the bride the world it is not his will
[1:01:10] that any should perish but that
[1:01:14] all should come to repentance so he
[1:01:16] doesn't just love his family he loved
[1:01:19] the human race
[1:01:22] is that right so we don't want to become
[1:01:24] so narrowed and so focused that all we
[1:01:27] think about is our church or just our
[1:01:29] message well everybody else and you know
[1:01:31] they're not even worth where well god
[1:01:32] don't agree with you in that view if you
[1:01:35] can give people a kind word why not give
[1:01:38] it to them well they don't come to
[1:01:40] church what difference does that make
[1:01:42] the lord jesus did not just heal those
[1:01:44] that were elect the lord jesus did not
[1:01:47] just come and make a way for those who
[1:01:49] have salvation that were on the lamb's
[1:01:51] book of life but also on the book of
[1:01:54] life i think we need to have his makeup
[1:01:57] his character and his attitude
[1:02:00] well hallelujah is that right
[1:02:06] now let's tap back if we can for just a
[1:02:08] few minutes before we go a different
[1:02:09] direction here on this great virtue of
[1:02:12] the lord god which is to be revealed
[1:02:14] mainly in the laodicean church age on
[1:02:17] the attribute of brotherly kindness now
[1:02:19] this is what's going to be in the body
[1:02:21] the main virtue of the day now we need
[1:02:24] of course all seven virtues but this is
[1:02:26] the one that will be the focus second
[1:02:28] peter chapter one verse five and beside
[1:02:31] all beside this giving all diligence add
[1:02:34] to your faith virtue and divert your
[1:02:36] knowledge to knowledge temperance to
[1:02:39] temperance patience to patience
[1:02:41] godliness oh my to godliness brotherly
[1:02:44] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[1:02:47] charity which is god himself for these
[1:02:50] things be in you and abound they make
[1:02:53] you that you shall neither be barren nor
[1:02:57] unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord
[1:02:59] jesus christ but he that lacketh these
[1:03:02] things is blind and cannot see afar off
[1:03:05] and have forgotten that he was purged
[1:03:08] from his old sin so we're talking about
[1:03:10] now people that have been forgiven and
[1:03:13] people that have been purged so you can
[1:03:15] be forgiven and you can be purged and
[1:03:18] still miss these virtues right here and
[1:03:21] a person who thinks well i'm forgiven
[1:03:24] that's all i need no you're just getting
[1:03:26] started you're just getting started to
[1:03:28] come into the economy
[1:03:30] of god now we notice when prophet deals
[1:03:32] with this he says actress artists looser
[1:03:35] then comes philadelphia god in this
[1:03:37] wesley holiness just shall live by faith
[1:03:40] said looser sanctification through
[1:03:42] wesley then come in brotherly kindness
[1:03:45] through the laodicea and we believe the
[1:03:48] great message of the second appearing of
[1:03:51] elijah in the last days shall sweep the
[1:03:53] land now notice what this is going to be
[1:03:56] each of us may have an element of these
[1:03:59] seven virtues that are natural to our
[1:04:01] human makeup but god does not accept
[1:04:04] that into the stature of a perfect man
[1:04:07] well brother donnie i'm pretty patient i
[1:04:09] i've got you know a little bit of faith
[1:04:11] and i've got a little bit of godliness
[1:04:12] that's well and good but these virtues
[1:04:15] are not our own virtues but they are the
[1:04:18] virtues of the lord jesus christ himself
[1:04:23] in the days of paul it was the virtue of
[1:04:27] christ jesus that was manifesting
[1:04:29] himself and the bottom part of the
[1:04:31] pyramid because god is building a house
[1:04:34] and that house don't look like a cube
[1:04:36] but it looks like a pyramid so we got
[1:04:39] the church age the church aids messenger
[1:04:41] and then we've got a virtue on the other
[1:04:42] side notice this now oh my and now we
[1:04:46] put the blood of jesus christ in and
[1:04:48] that brings the face of jesus christ so
[1:04:51] the face of jesus christ is not your
[1:04:54] faith on steroids
[1:04:56] it's not your faith built up by
[1:04:58] intellectual something but the virtues
[1:05:01] are actually the virtues of the lord
[1:05:04] jesus
[1:05:06] phil brother god i've got such faith
[1:05:09] wonderful i appreciate that but there
[1:05:11] will be times your faith will not be
[1:05:13] able to do what you need to be done
[1:05:17] what's this now we put the blood of
[1:05:19] jesus christ in that brings the face of
[1:05:22] jesus christ the virtue of jesus christ
[1:05:26] the knowledge of jesus christ but notice
[1:05:28] satan will try to bring a carnal
[1:05:32] impersonation
[1:05:33] of every one of these virtues why he
[1:05:36] does not want us to have the face of
[1:05:39] jesus christ the virtue of jesus christ
[1:05:43] the knowledge he don't mind you having
[1:05:45] knowledge he don't care if you memorize
[1:05:47] the scripture he don't care if you
[1:05:49] memorize the message and you can quote
[1:05:51] it and quote it and quote it but what
[1:05:54] does that knowledge do puffs you up
[1:05:57] but you see the knowledge of jesus
[1:05:59] christ will give an answer to the devil
[1:06:02] when you don't know what to say but the
[1:06:04] knowledge of jesus christ never makes
[1:06:06] you arrogant
[1:06:08] it never makes you puffed up
[1:06:10] but human knowledge does
[1:06:12] [Applause]
[1:06:14] oh my the knowledge of jesus christ the
[1:06:18] temperance the temperance you say why
[1:06:21] would the lord jesus need these he
[1:06:24] become
[1:06:25] a human
[1:06:27] being
[1:06:28] praise god
[1:06:29] jesus had faith jesus had virtue jesus
[1:06:34] had knowledge don't the bible tell us in
[1:06:36] luke 2 52 that jesus grew in wisdom and
[1:06:40] in stature before both god and men he
[1:06:43] allowed himself by the act of kenosis to
[1:06:47] step out of that all-knowing situation
[1:06:50] and step into humanity in such a degree
[1:06:54] and say i can do nothing except what my
[1:06:57] father shows me
[1:06:59] remember him talking about his second
[1:07:01] coming and he said even the son
[1:07:05] don't know when he's coming
[1:07:10] wow
[1:07:11] mind-boggling the temperance of jesus
[1:07:14] christ the patience you say why would he
[1:07:17] need patience
[1:07:19] you
[1:07:21] you
[1:07:23] me
[1:07:25] paul
[1:07:26] peter john
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:31] angels ain't done near the trying of his
[1:07:33] patience that i have
[1:07:34] and i'm going to go ahead and say it for
[1:07:36] the rest of you you bunch of sorry
[1:07:37] outfits y'all have done the same thing
[1:07:40] jesus needs patience to put up with us
[1:07:43] we're lazy we're sorry
[1:07:48] and i love you all y'all know it
[1:07:49] [Applause]
[1:07:52] the patience of jesus christ the
[1:07:55] godliness
[1:07:58] of jesus christ
[1:08:00] the brotherly kindness friend every one
[1:08:03] of these satan will try
[1:08:05] to bring an impostor of this and you're
[1:08:09] saying well i'm good i'm good i don't
[1:08:10] cut my hair don't do this i don't do
[1:08:12] that praise god i never wear red i i'm
[1:08:14] oh man i've got this holiness i'm so
[1:08:17] holy i'm so righteous uh-huh yeah
[1:08:20] and with yours it'll bring an attitude
[1:08:22] it'll bring an arrogance and you'll look
[1:08:24] down that long nose of yours that
[1:08:26] everybody that don't obey your
[1:08:28] convictions
[1:08:29] oh i'll tell you one thing there's
[1:08:30] people in our church that do this and
[1:08:32] don't do that and do something those do
[1:08:33] something else you know what it is
[1:08:35] that's the kind of so-called godliness
[1:08:37] satan wants us to have that we become
[1:08:40] harsh we become judgmental oh my but
[1:08:43] jesus said blessed are the merciful for
[1:08:47] they shall obtain
[1:08:50] apparently they need it
[1:08:53] i don't know about you i need mercy
[1:08:54] every day of my life
[1:08:58] my my you mean jesus christ as a man
[1:09:04] needed brotherly kindness
[1:09:08] if you'd had to put up with peter
[1:09:11] james john bartholomew
[1:09:14] thaddeus and all the rest of them guys
[1:09:18] you would have knew knowing why
[1:09:20] he needed it
[1:09:22] now let's just update it and say he
[1:09:24] still needs it today putting up with the
[1:09:26] rest of us
[1:09:29] oh my
[1:09:30] that's exactly right notice in the love
[1:09:33] of god which is jesus christ he's the
[1:09:36] head that controls you
[1:09:38] and your feet is the foundation face
[1:09:41] amen controlled by the head there you
[1:09:43] are there is the perfect man of god
[1:09:49] when he possesses
[1:09:51] these virtues
[1:09:54] notice again on page 51 so when you're
[1:09:56] surrendering your complete being
[1:09:59] then the holy spirit just pours through
[1:10:03] you
[1:10:04] in these verses notice the holy spirit
[1:10:08] pours through you
[1:10:11] through these virtues as god speaks to a
[1:10:13] pastor god speaks to the prophet god
[1:10:16] speaks to the evangelist the teacher and
[1:10:18] so on so the holy ghost these are the
[1:10:22] aspects in our life that god wants to
[1:10:25] speak through us
[1:10:27] not our human intelligence not our
[1:10:29] intellect not our pride not our
[1:10:31] arrogance these are the avenues that god
[1:10:35] will speak through us too by the dawning
[1:10:38] to everybody you come in contact with
[1:10:40] that he leads you to say something to
[1:10:44] if god's got anything to say on the
[1:10:47] earth today
[1:10:48] guess what he's going to use
[1:10:51] if god's got a sermon to be preached
[1:10:54] he's not going to send an angel
[1:10:56] god will never send an angel with wings
[1:10:58] on his back to stand here in this pulpit
[1:11:01] and preach a sermon to you all if you're
[1:11:03] down if you're weak if you're sick god
[1:11:05] said i'll get out of the way donnie get
[1:11:07] out of the way let me take that
[1:11:08] microphone i'll preach to them that's
[1:11:10] absolutely forbidden
[1:11:13] as a matter of fact the prophet of god
[1:11:14] said when the pastor steps in the pulpit
[1:11:16] he is the angel of god to you
[1:11:20] it would be forbidden for god to send a
[1:11:22] cherub and take my ipad this morning and
[1:11:26] preach these things to you it's totally
[1:11:28] forbidden it breaks divine protocol
[1:11:31] so is god want to fill his people with
[1:11:36] these things and god threw that protocol
[1:11:39] of your life
[1:11:40] loves like jesus
[1:11:42] forgives like jesus
[1:11:45] has temperance with your brother your
[1:11:47] sister your wife your children your
[1:11:49] husband whatever more that you yourself
[1:11:52] can say oh i'll tell you one thing boy
[1:11:54] they aggravate me but i'm gonna love
[1:11:56] like jesus
[1:11:57] i'm gonna pray for him
[1:12:00] help me first lord help me first
[1:12:05] oh my
[1:12:06] so when you're surrendering you're
[1:12:08] complete being then the holy spirit
[1:12:10] pours through you
[1:12:13] in
[1:12:15] these
[1:12:16] virtues
[1:12:18] then you're
[1:12:20] a living tabernacle
[1:12:24] then people look out and say that's a
[1:12:27] man
[1:12:28] full of virtue knowledge
[1:12:31] believes the word
[1:12:32] temperance patient godliness got
[1:12:34] brotherly kindness full of the love of
[1:12:37] the holy ghost walking around what is it
[1:12:39] a statue that unbelievers can look at
[1:12:43] and say
[1:12:44] there
[1:12:45] is
[1:12:47] a christian
[1:12:50] i'm going to tell you something friend
[1:12:51] you will never attain anything higher
[1:12:55] in this life
[1:12:57] until the body change
[1:13:00] that for this to be said about you in
[1:13:04] reality
[1:13:06] people may call you a rich man i said
[1:13:07] wow i've arrived
[1:13:09] i'm in the millionaires club i'm a
[1:13:12] billionaire i'm a thousand here i'm a
[1:13:14] penny or i'm whatever i i've arrived
[1:13:18] well with who we've got in the white
[1:13:19] house now you better hang on to it
[1:13:20] because next year you may not be
[1:13:24] come on they're going to give the irs
[1:13:25] the authority you know that already to
[1:13:27] monitor your checking account and your
[1:13:29] savings
[1:13:31] they're going to keep an eye on you big
[1:13:33] brother's watching you
[1:13:35] but aren't you glad your riches your
[1:13:37] real ones are laid up in heaven and mr
[1:13:40] biden don't have access to that account
[1:13:43] congress and the irs don't have access
[1:13:46] to that account praise the lord
[1:13:49] but when a person can look out of
[1:13:51] sincerity and say these words about you
[1:13:56] there
[1:13:57] is
[1:13:58] a christian
[1:14:01] nothing higher
[1:14:03] could be said about you
[1:14:06] nothing
[1:14:07] oh but brother donna would that man pray
[1:14:09] for me that don't mean he's a christian
[1:14:13] jesus said many will stand before me in
[1:14:14] that day so i cast out devils in your
[1:14:16] name i heal the sick in your name and
[1:14:19] then i will say unto them depart from me
[1:14:20] you worker of iniquity i never even knew
[1:14:24] you
[1:14:27] friends i wonder sometimes if we haven't
[1:14:28] missed some things
[1:14:30] we're saying why because we're so deep
[1:14:32] and we understand so much and now we
[1:14:34] know this i i i know i know i've been
[1:14:37] around a lot of those kingdom building
[1:14:39] preachers around the messaging what i've
[1:14:41] found is for a lot of their followers
[1:14:43] the more they know
[1:14:44] the more arrogant they become
[1:14:47] and the less friendly they are to
[1:14:49] everybody else i've been around some of
[1:14:51] them better so deep and know so much
[1:14:54] they know so much they won't even speak
[1:14:56] to you
[1:14:57] and you want me to believe you've got
[1:14:59] more of jesus than i do i don't see
[1:15:01] jesus doing that friends
[1:15:03] well preached brother donnie
[1:15:05] notice this in blasphemous names first
[1:15:08] foundationally is faith second that to
[1:15:10] your faith virtue to your virtue
[1:15:11] knowledge from knowledge temperance from
[1:15:13] temperance patience to almighty patience
[1:15:16] godliness and from godliness to
[1:15:18] brotherly kindness brotherly kindness
[1:15:20] then love being the capstone seven of
[1:15:24] those things seven church ages seven
[1:15:26] stars of the seven church ages all of it
[1:15:30] is tempered by what the holy spirit now
[1:15:33] that's what it takes to become
[1:15:36] a servant of christ
[1:15:39] how many needs more brotherly kindness
[1:15:42] more faith
[1:15:43] more virtue oh you're just keeping your
[1:15:45] hand up good good
[1:15:48] notice this again he says in paragraph
[1:15:49] 254 what is purpose to the church
[1:15:53] then life that was in christ isn't
[1:15:56] reflecting in you
[1:15:58] don't you stand still if you haven't got
[1:16:00] patience notice that the prophet himself
[1:16:03] didn't did not tell us don't stand still
[1:16:06] until you're the deepest person in the
[1:16:07] message you can quote me verbatim you
[1:16:10] can quote me word for word for word but
[1:16:13] these are the things he instructed us to
[1:16:16] persist in
[1:16:18] don't you stand still
[1:16:20] oh my if you've got patience virtue all
[1:16:23] these things and temperance and things
[1:16:25] and godliness and brotherly kindness all
[1:16:28] these things that's required of
[1:16:32] you
[1:16:35] now let us look in first corinthians
[1:16:36] chapter 12 if you would verse
[1:16:38] 24.
[1:16:40] look at how we are in the body
[1:16:44] for our comedy parts
[1:16:46] have no need
[1:16:49] but god hath tempered
[1:16:52] the body together look at this greek
[1:16:54] word mixed with
[1:16:56] mixed together
[1:16:58] co-mingle
[1:17:00] calls several parts to combine
[1:17:03] into
[1:17:04] an organic structure
[1:17:07] which is the body to unite one thing
[1:17:12] to another
[1:17:13] so god is liking the spiritual body to
[1:17:16] our natural body and this way paul is
[1:17:18] taking it but god has tempered the body
[1:17:21] together having given more abundant
[1:17:24] honor to that part which
[1:17:26] lacked
[1:17:28] now i hope you understand already that
[1:17:30] what we just read is an absolute miracle
[1:17:32] within itself
[1:17:34] that god actually takes people from
[1:17:37] different makeups different backgrounds
[1:17:39] different oh my just everything about us
[1:17:42] different races different culture
[1:17:43] different things totally around the
[1:17:45] world and god tempers them together and
[1:17:49] they commingle and they could never
[1:17:51] there's no way that the message of the
[1:17:54] hour could ever be replicated it could
[1:17:56] not be replicated by politics the
[1:17:59] republican party is divided as the
[1:18:00] democrats and the democrats are divided
[1:18:03] and the liberals are divided communism
[1:18:05] is divided socialism is divided but
[1:18:08] there is not a unity around the world
[1:18:11] that exists like the spiritual unity of
[1:18:14] the body of jesus
[1:18:17] because we're not uniting on political
[1:18:19] principles there may be democrats
[1:18:21] sitting here this morning republicans
[1:18:23] and some of you wouldn't give you a flip
[1:18:24] of a nickel for either one of them
[1:18:26] because you don't really care one way or
[1:18:28] the other but yet you are brothers and
[1:18:30] sisters in christ jesus
[1:18:32] [Music]
[1:18:33] [Applause]
[1:18:35] notice this in verse 25 that there
[1:18:38] should be no schism
[1:18:40] schism
[1:18:42] the word schism means division
[1:18:45] or dissension
[1:18:47] in the body notice now he's not calling
[1:18:49] this bodies
[1:18:51] but he uses one term through these whole
[1:18:54] passages of scripture
[1:18:56] body singular
[1:18:58] but the members should have the same
[1:19:00] care
[1:19:02] for one another
[1:19:06] now please listen to me carefully and
[1:19:08] don't misunderstand me
[1:19:10] i
[1:19:11] am not
[1:19:13] the body of christ
[1:19:18] you are not the body of christ
[1:19:21] as an individual
[1:19:24] but we
[1:19:25] are members
[1:19:28] of that body
[1:19:29] well i don't need to go to church i
[1:19:31] don't need someone so ah well you see a
[1:19:33] person like that don't even understand
[1:19:36] the body at all
[1:19:38] because they are making themselves the
[1:19:42] body as a whole well i don't have to go
[1:19:45] to church why of course you don't have
[1:19:47] to go to church but if you ever get to
[1:19:48] holy ghost you'll want to
[1:19:50] oh sure i don't have to not run around
[1:19:52] on my wife i don't have to not want to
[1:19:55] rob banks and smoke cigarettes and do
[1:19:56] all that sort of thing it's not a case
[1:19:58] of me not having to i just don't want to
[1:20:01] do it
[1:20:02] and it's the same when a person really
[1:20:04] gets a revelation that coincides with
[1:20:07] the divine word of god oh i don't have
[1:20:10] to go to church i don't have to be
[1:20:12] around nobody else i can stay at home
[1:20:14] and be just as good a christian well
[1:20:16] according to your prophet he said you
[1:20:18] couldn't
[1:20:20] amen
[1:20:21] but you see that there would be no
[1:20:24] schism in the body so god takes all
[1:20:27] these different members and he tempers
[1:20:30] them together and makes them function to
[1:20:33] one divine purpose that's an absolute
[1:20:35] miracle
[1:20:36] it's an absolute miracle some of us are
[1:20:39] so stubborn some of us are hard headed
[1:20:41] some of us are gentle some of us are
[1:20:43] tempered one way some are tempted or
[1:20:45] another it's a miracle for all of us to
[1:20:47] be sitting in the same building this
[1:20:48] morning having church together
[1:20:52] why because in our human makeup we're so
[1:20:54] different and you'd ask our likes and
[1:20:56] our dislikes and say how in the world
[1:20:58] are you all able to get together we've
[1:21:00] been tempered by the holy ghost
[1:21:04] notice in verse 26
[1:21:06] and whether one member suffered now
[1:21:08] notice what paul is identifying now he's
[1:21:11] not calling that member of the body but
[1:21:14] he's calling it a member of the body
[1:21:18] so if one member
[1:21:20] suffer
[1:21:21] so
[1:21:23] your brothers your wife tells you look
[1:21:24] honey
[1:21:25] i'd like to move that picture on the
[1:21:27] wall
[1:21:28] you say okay
[1:21:30] sure
[1:21:31] so you get your tools ready
[1:21:34] you hold it up there your stud finder
[1:21:36] you run across it
[1:21:41] you hold that nail up
[1:21:43] all of a sudden you've got it right back
[1:21:45] and whenever you do she said you care
[1:21:46] for t
[1:21:54] so you hit
[1:21:55] the wrong nail
[1:21:58] now look how small
[1:22:00] my thumbnail is
[1:22:02] not very big at all
[1:22:04] pumps no blood
[1:22:06] does not filter things in my body like
[1:22:08] my liver and my kidneys
[1:22:11] does not have any digestive juices in it
[1:22:15] it does not help as far as my eye color
[1:22:17] my hair color made out of keratin and
[1:22:20] all that vitamin k
[1:22:22] but all of a sudden
[1:22:24] my entire body
[1:22:27] is focusing
[1:22:30] on that little bitty piece of
[1:22:33] carrot
[1:22:36] and your heart oh
[1:22:39] oh why did you ask me if i wanted teeth
[1:22:41] in
[1:22:43] oh
[1:22:45] oh honey i'm so sorry and she comes over
[1:22:48] oh jesus jesus jesus oh
[1:22:59] so the entire body
[1:23:01] is giving attention
[1:23:03] your whole focus
[1:23:05] is now on that little nail
[1:23:09] can't you see what we're supposed to be
[1:23:10] as a body of jesus christ
[1:23:13] but what we tend to do we're the only
[1:23:16] army
[1:23:17] that's ever been in history that kills
[1:23:21] our own
[1:23:22] wounded
[1:23:24] brother
[1:23:27] so somebody falls and makes a mistake
[1:23:28] and does this and that and then ah we
[1:23:30] don't want nothing to do with a bunch of
[1:23:31] sorry outfits
[1:23:34] [Music]
[1:23:35] you should do it the way you do your son
[1:23:37] [Music]
[1:23:40] oh i realize it's risky you see when
[1:23:43] folks get in sin and they fall on the
[1:23:44] backside and they get all dirty and
[1:23:46] nasty and filthy
[1:23:48] it's risky going to the rescue
[1:23:51] sometimes i feel like i work for the
[1:23:53] sewer department of heaven
[1:23:55] with some of the trash i have to deal
[1:23:57] with in people's lives
[1:23:59] but let me tell you one thing
[1:24:00] i would rather do that
[1:24:02] i would rather be identified and fulfill
[1:24:04] the scripture the word of god remember
[1:24:06] the prophet talking about abraham
[1:24:08] whenever a lot backslid and god away
[1:24:10] from god and abraham risked his own life
[1:24:13] and the lives of his 318 men to go down
[1:24:16] there and deliver his brother said
[1:24:17] somebody said to me not long ago why do
[1:24:19] you go after that fella why do you go
[1:24:22] after that thing and said god forbid
[1:24:23] that i would ever get to a place that i
[1:24:26] would not reach out oh i'll tell you
[1:24:27] friend i'd love to be able to lead some
[1:24:30] of those who've backslid away from god
[1:24:32] and left our church i love to be able to
[1:24:35] lead some of them back they may smell
[1:24:37] like marijuana they may smell like
[1:24:39] alcohol they may smell like whatever
[1:24:41] more or but if i can lead them to the
[1:24:43] lord jesus i found out if we can bring
[1:24:46] them in we can clean them up after we
[1:24:48] catch them
[1:24:50] you brothers that fish no you cannot
[1:24:52] claim that fish while he's still in the
[1:24:54] lake but if you catch him then you can
[1:24:57] clean him oh hallelujah may god help us
[1:25:01] as a body that no matter how vile how
[1:25:04] wretched that we're not afraid to get
[1:25:06] our hands dirty
[1:25:10] [Applause]
[1:25:16] oh but my
[1:25:18] we're all so clean
[1:25:22] we're lily white
[1:25:24] oh
[1:25:26] we're just so precious
[1:25:28] and so wonderful
[1:25:30] and we've sat down to eat at the table
[1:25:32] of the king
[1:25:34] and our hands are clean
[1:25:36] our spirit is clean
[1:25:38] we're totally flawless
[1:25:40] we're just about the next thing to god
[1:25:42] himself you're a liar
[1:25:44] [Applause]
[1:25:50] is it risky yes
[1:25:52] i have risked my reputation many times
[1:25:57] by putting my arms
[1:25:59] around a fallen brother
[1:26:03] that i knew when i did it
[1:26:05] there would be self-righteous people
[1:26:08] that would look at me and say why would
[1:26:10] brother donny do that
[1:26:11] because i don't want to see a one parish
[1:26:15] i don't want to see a one parish
[1:26:18] i don't want to see a woman but brother
[1:26:20] donny they smell and they stink oh they
[1:26:22] do that's the way you and i did when we
[1:26:25] were in sin oh my but it might not be
[1:26:28] just one that's never got saved that'll
[1:26:30] be the last one in it could be a
[1:26:33] backslider that used to sit right here
[1:26:35] in this church or used to sit in
[1:26:37] louisiana somewhere and well come on
[1:26:39] let's just be honest it takes more grace
[1:26:42] in our hearts to deal with a backslider
[1:26:44] than it does a ranked center if we lead
[1:26:46] rank sinners to the lord and we baptize
[1:26:49] them all we're all standing up and we're
[1:26:51] so proud and we make such accolades
[1:26:54] but who wants to reach someone
[1:26:56] that's god had a fellowship with god
[1:27:00] and they're contaminated and they're
[1:27:02] filthy
[1:27:06] i will
[1:27:10] i'll do it
[1:27:11] even at the risk of you some of you
[1:27:14] not understand
[1:27:17] some of my contemporaries
[1:27:19] not understanding
[1:27:21] because i want to be like my jesus
[1:27:24] in every aspect of my life i'll tell you
[1:27:26] one thing if he would have reached out
[1:27:28] to those of us that were so clean and so
[1:27:31] pure
[1:27:32] and so sanctimonious
[1:27:35] there wouldn't be none of us even saved
[1:27:37] today but he picked us up out of the
[1:27:40] mirey clay he picked us up out of
[1:27:43] wretchedness and sin and the filth of
[1:27:46] the world and said child come on home
[1:27:49] come on
[1:27:54] hallelujah
[1:27:58] whether one member suffer all the
[1:28:00] members suffer
[1:28:02] with it
[1:28:02] [Music]
[1:28:05] listen to this high flips now it goes
[1:28:08] one member be honored
[1:28:11] all the members
[1:28:13] rejoice with it
[1:28:17] well that's a tough one for some folks
[1:28:21] oh yeah we turn out of prayer remember
[1:28:23] sister so it's awesome you just said
[1:28:28] god help my sister and for many of you
[1:28:31] is genuine
[1:28:32] but when you hear about somebody getting
[1:28:34] honored
[1:28:37] i've been saved longer than them
[1:28:40] well this is tough for preachers too
[1:28:43] because god will call them and raise him
[1:28:44] up and let him do this and that the
[1:28:46] other boy preachers if they're not
[1:28:47] careful they'll go to fighting him
[1:28:49] ah these big name preachers i've asked a
[1:28:52] lot of people to please explain to me
[1:28:54] what that means
[1:28:56] is that how many letters is in his name
[1:29:00] big name i only know one big name among
[1:29:03] us
[1:29:04] that's the lord jesus christ it ain't my
[1:29:07] name tim pruitt's name ron spencer's
[1:29:09] name joel brown's name there's only one
[1:29:11] big name
[1:29:12] that's the lord jesus
[1:29:14] oh the love of god in the body can cry
[1:29:18] for those who are crying and then when
[1:29:20] they see a brother or sister that god
[1:29:22] blesses and uses or even maybe blesses
[1:29:24] them financially they can like i say
[1:29:26] praise god praise god
[1:29:31] amen well i guess i'm also dismissed now
[1:29:36] can you rejoice
[1:29:38] if you see other people blessed more
[1:29:40] financially than you are
[1:29:44] or do you have a problem
[1:29:49] my problem is them no actually it's not
[1:29:52] it's you
[1:29:57] [Applause]
[1:29:58] brother reminds me of it
[1:30:01] every now and then
[1:30:03] to be honest i don't remember even
[1:30:05] saying it to him
[1:30:06] but he says that i told him something
[1:30:08] years and years ago
[1:30:10] and he was a young preacher
[1:30:12] and that was this brother daryl
[1:30:15] you cannot really be used by god
[1:30:18] in a great way
[1:30:19] until you can see one of your brothers
[1:30:21] use greater than yourself
[1:30:24] then you're a candidate
[1:30:26] for god to use you
[1:30:29] then you realize it's not competitive
[1:30:33] that's right well i'll tell you one
[1:30:34] thing there's more folks stream happy
[1:30:36] valley than any other church in the
[1:30:37] message i'm not sure that that's a
[1:30:39] blessing
[1:30:42] pardon probably the fbi and the irs and
[1:30:45] only god knows who else
[1:30:48] well i tell one man i've got more folks
[1:30:50] following my ministry than so-and-so
[1:30:52] does you are so carnal
[1:30:55] you are so carnal thank god for every
[1:30:58] man of god that's called by the spirit
[1:30:59] of god i don't care if they reach 5 000
[1:31:02] times more than we do i want to do our
[1:31:05] little parts and let them do their great
[1:31:08] big parts and when we all get to heaven
[1:31:11] we will all give praise to our lord
[1:31:14] jesus christ and say that we were
[1:31:17] unworthy servants
[1:31:27] oh
[1:31:32] so a brother or sister can be set in a
[1:31:34] high place
[1:31:36] wow
[1:31:38] and we have to walk by them and look at
[1:31:40] them
[1:31:43] god bless you
[1:31:48] you pharisy
[1:31:50] [Applause]
[1:31:52] i'm talking from my heart's friends oh i
[1:31:55] know this ain't deep this morning most
[1:31:56] you don't live deep anyway so that's
[1:31:57] right where you live
[1:32:00] can we with all reality
[1:32:04] if god blesses a man or a woman
[1:32:06] god blesses somebody to sing and they're
[1:32:08] so talented
[1:32:10] and people just oh they so bless and
[1:32:12] they just clap and clap and clap and
[1:32:13] clap and clap and reclap and reclap and
[1:32:15] then whenever you sing they just clap
[1:32:21] or do you take it out on the people come
[1:32:23] on
[1:32:24] brother's fault they got with them
[1:32:26] better than the other person you see
[1:32:27] some people who are that way can never
[1:32:29] acknowledge
[1:32:31] that maybe god gives someone else a
[1:32:33] little greater gift
[1:32:35] than themselves
[1:32:37] but one of the greatest victories you'll
[1:32:39] ever achieve
[1:32:41] is to find that god sets people in the
[1:32:43] body as it pleases him
[1:32:46] not
[1:32:47] them
[1:32:51] can i have a few more minutes
[1:32:53] y'all ain't gonna turn further me are
[1:32:54] you
[1:32:55] now brother louie don't give me this
[1:32:57] pasture appreciation i thought about
[1:32:58] time maybe you should wait till after
[1:33:00] the service and see if they still
[1:33:01] appreciate me
[1:33:02] it might be pastor
[1:33:06] depreciation so god blesses somebody
[1:33:10] helps them honors them with a higher
[1:33:12] office
[1:33:13] maybe more understanding
[1:33:15] my goodness i hear some of the message
[1:33:17] brothers preach on whatever it is i
[1:33:18] think
[1:33:20] i just heard that same sermon how come i
[1:33:22] didn't get that
[1:33:24] and believe it or not some of them tell
[1:33:25] me that and that's the greatest marvel
[1:33:27] of all believe me
[1:33:29] you think wow really
[1:33:31] why because god does not give all of it
[1:33:34] to one human being
[1:33:36] god does not give all the great
[1:33:38] understanding of election to one message
[1:33:40] pastor then everybody in the message
[1:33:42] rallies around that pastor but god
[1:33:44] diversifies his gifts and divides them
[1:33:47] out among the body
[1:33:51] i'm glad he does it that way it's
[1:33:52] perfect
[1:33:54] maybe one have more spiritual light on
[1:33:56] this or that or the other
[1:33:58] my
[1:34:00] and some just so struggle watch this in
[1:34:02] oneness with god the prophet said by one
[1:34:04] spirit we're all individually baptized
[1:34:07] into one body collectively
[1:34:10] the body of jesus christ and jesus
[1:34:12] christ living with his spirit
[1:34:15] in our flesh
[1:34:19] serving who
[1:34:25] not jesus christ living in your flesh
[1:34:28] serving you
[1:34:32] but jesus christ in your flesh
[1:34:36] serving the body
[1:34:40] boy it's a meeting down in louisiana and
[1:34:42] i'll tell you one thing
[1:34:43] that last service
[1:34:45] several weeks ago i asked brother tim
[1:34:47] brother tim
[1:34:48] who's preaching the last service
[1:34:51] because somehow another always gets
[1:34:53] stuck with a lifestyle
[1:34:55] so i was hoping maybe i wouldn't
[1:34:58] so he said why are you iron brother
[1:35:00] dummy
[1:35:04] i didn't even ask about the other one i
[1:35:06] wanted to know about that one
[1:35:09] him and i'm brother ron we're all
[1:35:10] together we all got a
[1:35:12] life out of it
[1:35:14] oh i went home back to the room of rv
[1:35:17] where karen i was staying boy i studied
[1:35:19] for a sermon i'm telling you what
[1:35:22] i studied and it was going to be man was
[1:35:25] it going to be a sermon oh
[1:35:28] i got a sunday morning or before i got
[1:35:30] up and the lord woke me up before
[1:35:32] daylight
[1:35:34] oh why it doesn't matter way but it does
[1:35:36] that's fine i have no problem with
[1:35:37] that's fine
[1:35:40] sir he started dealing with me about
[1:35:43] some things i thought
[1:35:45] oh no
[1:35:47] there was that real good sermon i was
[1:35:48] gonna preach
[1:35:50] so when i got up i started putting all
[1:35:52] that together for those of you there and
[1:35:53] those of you that streamed it
[1:35:54] oh i struggled with that sermon
[1:35:58] i even posted on the ministry chat
[1:36:00] brothers pray for me this morning
[1:36:02] i told brother tim before i walked out
[1:36:04] and said pray for my body i got to bring
[1:36:06] something i really don't want to bring
[1:36:07] it obey the lord
[1:36:15] but i told her brother this week if i
[1:36:16] ever get up in a convention anywhere
[1:36:18] else
[1:36:19] and announce my title
[1:36:20] going back home the whole building will
[1:36:22] empty out
[1:36:26] some of you don't know what i'm talking
[1:36:27] about but i preached about returning
[1:36:28] back home coming back down off the
[1:36:30] mountain and all kinds of battles and
[1:36:31] all hell breaking loose believe what you
[1:36:33] want to believe it was prophetic
[1:36:38] but it wasn't what i wanted to preach
[1:36:41] i wanted to cap off them meetings oh i
[1:36:44] had a sermon i told carol said this is
[1:36:46] what i was going to preach it was going
[1:36:47] to be this and it was going to be that
[1:36:48] and it had been a million miles off
[1:36:51] it would have made everybody so happy
[1:36:53] and jumping and shouting my lord they
[1:36:55] never tore the pews down just other
[1:36:57] services that have been swinging off the
[1:36:58] chandeliers you think with the final
[1:37:00] climax of the presence of god
[1:37:03] but god didn't want that
[1:37:06] so now what are you going to do
[1:37:09] you're a preacher you're gifted you're
[1:37:11] called
[1:37:13] you want to get up and preach what you
[1:37:15] want to preach
[1:37:19] or you want to preach something that's
[1:37:21] so against you
[1:37:25] but you do it because he's the boss
[1:37:29] [Applause]
[1:37:30] why
[1:37:31] he knew the body
[1:37:33] would need it
[1:37:36] that was what i gonna say in the other
[1:37:37] sermon lies no it wasn't lies it was the
[1:37:40] truth it was the scripture it was a
[1:37:41] message but it was the wrong season
[1:37:44] what was seasonal was what he wanted a
[1:37:47] song leader might be the same way god
[1:37:49] put something on his heart to sing and
[1:37:50] say we practice that i don't know about
[1:37:52] that i don't know no i don't do that i
[1:37:54] might mess up what you're concerned
[1:37:56] about himself
[1:37:57] i want people to say i'm a good singer i
[1:37:59] want people to think i'm a good preacher
[1:38:01] i want people to think this that what
[1:38:02] difference does it make what people
[1:38:04] thinks
[1:38:05] it's what god thinks
[1:38:08] that counts
[1:38:12] oh my
[1:38:14] verse 27 we'll close
[1:38:17] now ye
[1:38:19] are the body of christ
[1:38:23] and members
[1:38:26] in particular
[1:38:28] so depaul is addressing the church
[1:38:30] remember this isn't one of the most
[1:38:32] gifted churches in the new testament
[1:38:35] not another church had as many gifts
[1:38:38] but they assumed gifts
[1:38:40] meant depths understanding knowledge
[1:38:43] just because people are gifted
[1:38:45] don't mean they have a lick of sense
[1:38:51] well praise the lord
[1:38:54] they don't mean they've got to lick a
[1:38:55] sense it don't mean they have a lick of
[1:38:57] wisdom
[1:38:58] i don't understand it myself that's one
[1:39:00] of the things i'm going to ask him one
[1:39:01] day why do you give gifts to people that
[1:39:03] don't even know how to use them i don't
[1:39:04] know
[1:39:06] but look at them they were so divided
[1:39:09] they were cultish
[1:39:10] this was following that man this group
[1:39:12] was following that man that group was
[1:39:14] following another man and they argued
[1:39:16] and they fussed and they fought and yet
[1:39:18] they were so gifted they had one man
[1:39:20] living with his stepmother they had the
[1:39:22] office bunch of issues that ever was and
[1:39:24] they had more gifts than all the rest of
[1:39:27] the bible even mentions of the new
[1:39:29] testament church and they thought
[1:39:31] because of the gifts that meant they
[1:39:32] were so close to god it didn't
[1:39:39] so they used their gifts so they come to
[1:39:42] church
[1:39:42] they love to speak in tongues
[1:39:45] they would just speak in tongues while
[1:39:46] the preaching was going on they'd speak
[1:39:48] in tongues and they're so loud it would
[1:39:50] drown out the preacher you couldn't hear
[1:39:51] the preacher
[1:39:54] but they thought they were so spiritual
[1:39:56] you imagine they just speak in tongues
[1:39:58] and just go on and on and on and on and
[1:39:59] on oh glory to god we had such a service
[1:40:02] a preacher couldn't even preach it was
[1:40:03] such a wonderful service
[1:40:07] why
[1:40:08] because they were using their gifts
[1:40:12] for themselves
[1:40:16] instead of edifying
[1:40:18] the body
[1:40:21] whatever god gave you as far as your
[1:40:23] gift
[1:40:25] it's not for you
[1:40:27] it's for the body
[1:40:29] of christ but you will be tempted i'll
[1:40:31] warn you ahead of time
[1:40:33] to use that gift for yourself you see
[1:40:35] the example i just gave you a preacher
[1:40:38] a preacher can go and preach
[1:40:40] with that gift that god's given and he
[1:40:43] can use that gift
[1:40:45] to make himself look greater in the eyes
[1:40:47] of the people or he can use that gift to
[1:40:51] follow the spirit of god and i found out
[1:40:54] through decades of experience many times
[1:40:56] god will have you to preach beneath your
[1:41:00] capacity
[1:41:01] beneath what you see and beneath what
[1:41:05] you understand and then people will
[1:41:07] criticize you oh he don't know very much
[1:41:09] he don't this and that and the other but
[1:41:12] yet you're following the spirit of god
[1:41:13] and he knows you will
[1:41:16] and it's like he puts that before you
[1:41:19] what's he doing he's using you
[1:41:22] to prove his word to the devil
[1:41:24] i've got men that are so gifted that if
[1:41:27] they ever stood up and really opened
[1:41:29] what i've given them it would profound
[1:41:31] their congregation that's been setting
[1:41:34] under them for years and years
[1:41:37] but what does god do he keeps you right
[1:41:40] where he's in charge
[1:41:41] he's
[1:41:42] the boss
[1:41:44] [Applause]
[1:41:47] can we stand
[1:41:50] oh praise the lord
[1:41:55] i'm just glad you come to church
[1:41:58] me too
[1:42:06] oh my
[1:42:09] may god help us
[1:42:13] now ye are the body of christ
[1:42:15] and members in particular romans 12 4
[1:42:18] for as we have many members in one body
[1:42:21] and all members have not the same office
[1:42:24] so we being many are one body in christ
[1:42:30] and everyone
[1:42:32] remembers
[1:42:33] one
[1:42:35] of another
[1:42:37] no revelation from god will ever
[1:42:39] disassociate you or me from the rest of
[1:42:43] the body i don't need the body i don't
[1:42:45] that's contrary to scripture
[1:42:48] you are members
[1:42:50] of one another look friends you all
[1:42:52] think you need me
[1:42:53] that's only half the picture i need you
[1:42:57] what good would a gift to preach do in
[1:42:59] any man's life without people to preach
[1:43:02] to
[1:43:03] when the bad case of covet was going on
[1:43:05] here in our church and we had about 10
[1:43:06] or 11 brothers here god help me and god
[1:43:09] anointed me
[1:43:10] but his show wasn't the same as saying
[1:43:12] you're all smiling faces and i can tell
[1:43:14] you that right now
[1:43:15] not one of these pews ever jumped up and
[1:43:17] raised their ends
[1:43:19] not a one of them ever raised up and
[1:43:21] shouted not a one of them ever praised
[1:43:23] god these brothers god bless the heart
[1:43:25] they double amen they quadrupled every
[1:43:27] ever every time they could to try to
[1:43:29] make it easy on the preacher why it
[1:43:31] ain't the same without you being here
[1:43:35] why we need
[1:43:37] one another
[1:43:40] how many wants to be more like what
[1:43:42] you've heard today
[1:43:46] amen lord jesus
[1:43:49] let's bow our heads together for it
[1:43:57] lord god
[1:44:01] we know as long as we're in these old
[1:44:03] human prisons
[1:44:06] we're a slave held in captivity through
[1:44:09] these bodies
[1:44:11] our make up our natures
[1:44:15] most of us
[1:44:16] can take promotion much greater than
[1:44:18] demotion
[1:44:20] most of us love to be acknowledged
[1:44:24] we love to hear a name called
[1:44:28] lord god help us to realize
[1:44:30] every gifted singer in this place
[1:44:32] musician preacher whatever more
[1:44:35] that gift was not given to them so that
[1:44:37] people could think
[1:44:38] oh they're so gifted we need to
[1:44:40] acknowledge that of course
[1:44:43] but every gift in this assembly
[1:44:45] was given for the body
[1:44:48] i mean oh lord that even with preachers
[1:44:50] and with singers
[1:44:52] some lord are given to bless other
[1:44:54] assemblies
[1:44:55] so when they go out
[1:44:57] someone may say however so and so to say
[1:44:59] have sister so-and-so to sing because
[1:45:01] their singing is such a blessing to
[1:45:04] other assemblies maybe for some it's not
[1:45:06] so
[1:45:07] they just bless that assembly where they
[1:45:09] are
[1:45:09] it doesn't mean they're not called
[1:45:12] doesn't mean they're not gifted
[1:45:14] same with preachers samuel musicians
[1:45:18] lord god help us
[1:45:20] help each of us
[1:45:22] to move beyond jealousy and carnality
[1:45:27] may we move closer and closer to the
[1:45:29] image of the lord jesus
[1:45:32] we see the apostles as they were arguing
[1:45:35] and debating
[1:45:36] of who was going to be the greatest
[1:45:39] just days before you're going to be
[1:45:41] crucified in their fussing of who's
[1:45:44] going to be the biggest
[1:45:46] the sons of thunder their mother comes
[1:45:48] and says i want my two boys to be able
[1:45:51] to sit in the throne one on the left and
[1:45:52] one on the right
[1:45:54] and the rest of the disciples got
[1:45:56] jealous and angry because of this
[1:45:59] we know this was all signs
[1:46:01] that they didn't have the holy ghost yet
[1:46:05] once they got the holy ghost we don't
[1:46:07] see any other instance in the bible
[1:46:09] where such things prevailed
[1:46:12] carol asked me the other day that i
[1:46:14] think after they got the holy ghost if
[1:46:16] they still battled them i said i believe
[1:46:17] they did they were human beings
[1:46:20] but the prevalent thing was the holy
[1:46:22] ghost
[1:46:24] not their humanity
[1:46:26] so it wasn't so essential to write about
[1:46:29] all their failures no doubt peter ward
[1:46:32] with peter
[1:46:33] every day of his life
[1:46:36] no doubt john ward with john and we know
[1:46:38] that john the beloved disciple john
[1:46:42] when they didn't receive you in the city
[1:46:44] the samaritans and john said you want us
[1:46:46] to call fire down that heaven
[1:46:49] him and his brethren jesus said you
[1:46:50] don't even know what spirit you're off
[1:46:54] no doubt john still had to deal with an
[1:46:57] element of john
[1:46:58] after he got the holy ghost
[1:47:01] louie's got to deal with an element of
[1:47:03] louie
[1:47:04] harry and don ian all the rest of us and
[1:47:08] this is why you give us these great
[1:47:10] manifestations of your own nature
[1:47:13] in a seven-fold way of these virtues to
[1:47:15] live out of us
[1:47:17] so when our patience runs thin
[1:47:19] the patience of jesus christ can kick in
[1:47:23] when our godliness may run short
[1:47:25] the godliness of jesus christ
[1:47:28] our brotherly kindness may run short
[1:47:30] with a brother or a sister
[1:47:32] but when ours runs thin
[1:47:35] yours is an inexhaustible fountain
[1:47:39] help us today lord jesus
[1:47:42] not only those in this visible audience
[1:47:44] but those that have streamed today
[1:47:46] may you minister to every hungry heart
[1:47:48] lord
[1:47:50] we believe you started your church the
[1:47:52] way you wanted it and you're going to
[1:47:53] end it the way you started it
[1:47:56] this is the type of lives
[1:47:58] the alpha bride lived
[1:48:01] when they were buried
[1:48:03] in the dirt of denominationalism
[1:48:06] then the omega bride
[1:48:08] must be living out the same life with
[1:48:10] the same nature
[1:48:12] with the same virtues
[1:48:14] that the alpha bride had
[1:48:16] for she was alpha
[1:48:19] now she is
[1:48:20] omega
[1:48:23] we see them lord as they would tack them
[1:48:25] to crosses
[1:48:27] they would wrap them in sheepskins and
[1:48:30] animal skins and
[1:48:31] poor pitch on their bodies and set them
[1:48:34] on fire
[1:48:36] and they would sing songs and the
[1:48:38] heathens the romans
[1:48:40] would say listen they sing
[1:48:42] look at how they die
[1:48:45] yet the neros would scream like a pig
[1:48:48] when they were being killed
[1:48:51] the romans died like cowards
[1:48:54] what was it that helped those christians
[1:48:57] it was your life in them
[1:49:00] so they could pray
[1:49:02] for those who crucified them
[1:49:04] as nero would walk through his garden at
[1:49:07] night and those human torches would burn
[1:49:10] our brothers and sisters flesh
[1:49:12] would fall off of their bodies and melt
[1:49:15] as it were
[1:49:16] them screaming in pain and torture
[1:49:20] but they did not recant
[1:49:22] because it was the patience of jesus
[1:49:24] christ
[1:49:26] the faith of jesus christ
[1:49:29] well today lord we're not being torched
[1:49:32] we're not being hunted down
[1:49:34] but we're fighting lord never demon out
[1:49:37] of hell that's been let loose against us
[1:49:40] sickness disease pestilence oppression
[1:49:43] sadness sorrow we can feel it
[1:49:46] lord god we need you to live through us
[1:49:51] in the omega cycle
[1:49:53] the way you live through your first
[1:49:54] bride in the alpha cycle
[1:49:59] hallelujah
[1:50:00] yes we want to heal the sick as you did
[1:50:04] yes we want to lay hands on them
[1:50:07] but we also want to have this
[1:50:11] as you did
[1:50:13] that you could hang there on the cross
[1:50:15] and say father forgive them
[1:50:18] for they know not what they do
[1:50:22] hallelujah
[1:50:24] so it's not a blinded eye it was not a
[1:50:27] crippled leg
[1:50:28] the last work on the cross
[1:50:31] it was pardoning the hard-hearted
[1:50:33] the uncaring
[1:50:36] and reaching out to a man that said
[1:50:38] remember me
[1:50:40] and you said today thou shalt be with me
[1:50:43] in paradise
[1:50:47] help us lord jesus may we not give up on
[1:50:49] our children
[1:50:51] maybe not give up on our loved ones
[1:50:52] maybe not give up on those lord have
[1:50:54] pulled away
[1:50:56] lord god bring them back
[1:50:58] for that last one lord jesus could be a
[1:51:01] woman you're today
[1:51:02] she's out there in the world went back
[1:51:04] to the slop of the world yet her name is
[1:51:06] on that book
[1:51:08] well if she sees one of our sisters
[1:51:10] well our sisters be shamed to be
[1:51:12] identified with her
[1:51:14] she got a tattoo on her left arm a
[1:51:15] tattoo on her neck a tattoo on her right
[1:51:17] arm
[1:51:21] lord god help us
[1:51:24] hallelujah
[1:51:26] that we can be like you
[1:51:28] that that last one that last work of
[1:51:31] miraculous power
[1:51:33] might be reaching out to a thief
[1:51:35] on a cross
[1:51:37] we don't know who it'll be lord
[1:51:39] but may we be ready
[1:51:42] may we not preach so that we can be
[1:51:44] honored
[1:51:45] may we not even preach sermon titles in
[1:51:47] certain subjects
[1:51:48] because that's our favorite
[1:51:51] the lord god help me as a preacher
[1:51:54] and i'll always follow your spirit
[1:51:57] you know how much i dislike preaching
[1:52:00] sermons like today
[1:52:02] you know how
[1:52:04] it breaks my heart
[1:52:06] the last service i shared i sat back
[1:52:09] there in the office with my head
[1:52:11] in my hands
[1:52:12] carol opened the door and walked in and
[1:52:14] said don't you feel bad
[1:52:16] it's what we needed
[1:52:19] any man of god you know lord how it goes
[1:52:21] against us
[1:52:23] but our gift is not for us
[1:52:25] it's not for fame or fortune
[1:52:28] it's to minister to your people
[1:52:31] i know sometimes i may make them angry i
[1:52:33] don't mean to
[1:52:35] i don't want to but if i've got to
[1:52:37] swallow them a little bit
[1:52:39] and i've got to shake them
[1:52:41] they'll appreciate it lord after a while
[1:52:45] help us lord jesus
[1:52:48] thank you lord god
[1:52:50] how many of you would raise your hand
[1:52:52] and say to the lord lord use me
[1:52:55] whatever i can do lord
[1:52:58] maybe it's
[1:52:59] give a person a little money lord
[1:53:02] maybe it's
[1:53:03] send somebody a text to lift them up
[1:53:06] maybe it's to pray for brother donnie
[1:53:07] brother daryl these ministers
[1:53:09] maybe it's to pray for the song leaders
[1:53:11] lord nobody may never know it
[1:53:14] what can i do lord that'll minister to
[1:53:17] this body here this local assembly
[1:53:21] hallelujah
[1:53:23] hallelujah
[1:53:27] hallelujah
[1:53:30] blessed jesus
[1:53:33] may you anoint us father
[1:53:35] may we have such a baptism of love today
[1:53:39] through this covert thing i've seen this
[1:53:41] body come together like never before
[1:53:44] i've seen them reach out to one another
[1:53:45] and help one another
[1:53:47] i thank you for that lord
[1:53:50] so it proved to us once again that when
[1:53:51] we get in stress and great difficulty
[1:53:54] that we run to one another's needs
[1:53:56] even though humanly we may not like each
[1:53:58] other's makeup or this or that
[1:54:00] but that don't matter
[1:54:02] hallelujah we're brothers we're sisters
[1:54:06] in the economy of god
[1:54:09] oh jesus
[1:54:11] will you send a fresh baptism of the
[1:54:13] holy ghost around the world
[1:54:15] baptize us preachers afresh lord
[1:54:20] oh we don't agree on this idea and maybe
[1:54:21] that idea but lord god help us to
[1:54:24] realize through difficulty
[1:54:26] really isn't these minor ideas that's
[1:54:28] what makes us family
[1:54:31] it's because we have the same father
[1:54:35] the word
[1:54:37] worship you today jesus
[1:54:40] we worship you jesus
[1:54:43] can we take just a few minutes now
[1:54:45] how many feels like you need just a
[1:54:47] fresh baptism of the holy ghost
[1:54:50] in your life not for signs and wonders
[1:54:53] but for love
[1:54:55] brotherly kindness
[1:54:56] godliness
[1:54:58] patience
[1:55:00] virtue
[1:55:01] remember jesus come down off of that
[1:55:03] mount of transfiguration
[1:55:05] and in the valley he was met by a man
[1:55:08] who had a boy possessed of an evil
[1:55:10] spirit
[1:55:11] one thing after another hit him moses
[1:55:13] come down from the mount of god
[1:55:16] and he was met by people and
[1:55:18] naked worshiping idols
[1:55:21] oh it's easy when we're under his
[1:55:22] anointing
[1:55:24] but it's when we walk out of these doors
[1:55:26] to take what we're hearing and let it
[1:55:28] live out of us when there is no
[1:55:30] anointing present
[1:55:33] but remember you are anointed to be
[1:55:35] bride
[1:55:37] that does not mean when you feel it
[1:55:40] i'm just as anointed to pray for the
[1:55:42] sick when you call me in the morning at
[1:55:44] 1 30.
[1:55:45] as i am when i'm standing right here
[1:55:47] under the anointing
[1:55:49] and many of you know you've called me at
[1:55:50] one o'clock two o'clock three o'clock
[1:55:52] four o'clock whatever it is in the
[1:55:54] morning for prayer and now i'm awakened
[1:55:56] out of a dead sleep
[1:55:58] and the spirit of god will come on the
[1:56:00] other end of the phone and heal your
[1:56:02] body and bring deliverance why i'm
[1:56:05] anointed to pray for the sick
[1:56:07] i'm anointed to live right and i'm not
[1:56:10] only anointed to live right but as a
[1:56:12] bride

[1:56:15] you feel it or whether you don't
