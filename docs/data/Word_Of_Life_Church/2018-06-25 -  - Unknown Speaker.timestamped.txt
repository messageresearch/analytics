[0:00] I know you're familiar to a story but
[0:01] let's read it and thirst and Tucson like
[0:06] a little lady in our city where we come
[0:07] from a little girl went up there to
[0:10] church very little fine girl
[0:12] she was coming down the street she had
[0:14] long hair you know and had her pull back
[0:16] slick of like a peeled onion no makeup
[0:20] on this girl used to make fun of her
[0:22] that if you wouldn't have that flat
[0:24] headed preacher up there speaking of me
[0:27] you can look like something decent but
[0:30] you look like something out of an
[0:31] antique shop she did write to her over
[0:35] the coals every time she'd see her like
[0:37] that said I pass chourus broad mirrored
[0:40] I mean brown and that's why you look
[0:46] like that that don't mean anything how
[0:48] you dress or think it does God's Bible
[0:51] says it does we shall live every word so
[0:53] this little girl I like this little
[0:55] girl's attitude this little girl never
[0:57] paid a bit of attention to her went on
[1:00] she is a missionary now
[1:03] so then this young lady took a social
[1:06] disease and she died a friend of mine
[1:09] pump the embalming fluid in her when she
[1:12] was dying he told me after she was dead
[1:14] he kept smelling the fluid in at either
[1:18] hole in her side social disease even her
[1:21] parents didn't know what was wrong with
[1:23] her she died but before she died she
[1:25] taught Sunday school and all the little
[1:28] Sunday school group come in they wanted
[1:32] to see her when she went off to heaven
[1:35] the angels come and pack her away and
[1:39] remember she'd went to church she was a
[1:41] Sunday school teacher she'd done many
[1:44] many things and she got ready to go to
[1:46] heaven she got ready to meet God by what
[1:49] mirror by the mirror of that church and
[1:53] that preacher that preacher kept holding
[1:55] this miracle sister don't worry about
[1:57] cutting your hair
[1:58] God go man whatever so gone some old
[2:00] burns need a new coat of paint
[2:01] I agree Barnes
[2:03] lips bless you wanna be a Jezebel then
[2:07] push them on Jezebel good so he
[2:11] kept holding that male front so she's
[2:13] getting ready to go to heaven in front
[2:15] of that mirror so she looks in that
[2:16] mirror and she sees her Bob huh
[2:18] God don't care about that she sees her
[2:20] painted face that don't make no
[2:21] difference to God
[2:22] and she sees that all these things he
[2:23] should that don't make no difference a
[2:25] God
[2:25] running have a man commits adultery
[2:27] getting a social disease I don't make no
[2:29] devil God yes sir how could she do that
[2:30] it was the mirror she's getting ready my

[2:54] to die the doctor said she was dying so
[2:56] there's gonna see the angels come and
[2:58] pack her away and all at once was she
[3:04] faced the reality now death is moving in
[3:09] the church mirror is now pulled away and
[3:13] the word bear is now in front of her her
[3:20] soul that should send away her
[3:21] conscience was now coming back she's

[4:28] last thing she saw was herself lost so
[4:32] she dies she dies gasping for grab
[4:36] breath looking at herself in the mirror

[7:23] Deacons of the Church of one of the
[7:24] other preachers of the church but why

[7:31] that had walked before her day in and
[7:33] day out and she tried to talk her out of

[7:51] Oh Happy Valley this is what I want you

[7:59] me for prayer I don't want them said all
[8:01] he's a good preacher I want them to see
[8:03] this message manifest here here on the
[8:05] pews go get that little good juice girl
[8:17] and bring her up here to me real quick
[8:21] she is right wait till you face that
[8:27] reality once don't you try to stop that
[8:29] holiness don't you blast it away with
[8:32] some modern education or double-barrel
[8:33] shotgun you listen to that warning of
[8:36] the holy ghost tonight
[8:37] that's warning you I'm the way the truth
[8:39] and the life no man comes to the Father
[8:41] but Namie here is the word oh so good
[8:47] can you imagine when the tribulation
[8:50] finally sets in when the rapture goes it
[8:55] will be weeks or possibly even months
[8:58] before the people begin to realize the
[9:02] church now there will be people around
[9:05] this message that will start to
[9:07] recognize it as soon as day one
[9:10] everybody comes home from work and
[9:12] Mama's not there or daddies know it
[9:15] there you imagine the shock for the
[9:18] message people as the rapture takes
[9:20] place and they begin to realize there
[9:22] are the only ones in the world that will
[9:24] know what's going on and they go to work
[9:27] and they go to call the police and the
[9:28] EMT people and all the emergency people
[9:30] my mama's gone the rapture Church but oh
[9:32] brother BAM said within so you imagine
[9:33] how they're gonna look but how many
[9:36] other days or weeks go by before people
[9:39] begin to realize something's happening
[9:41] here all kinds of stuff is breaking
[9:42] loose everywhere what in the world is
[9:44] going on brother Ram said they will say
[9:47] I've thought there supposed to be a
[9:48] rapture first and the voice have come
[9:52] back from heaven it's already happened
[9:54] and you didn't know it
[9:57] I wonder how they'll feel when they
[9:59] found in look into the mirror of this
[10:02] message they have made fun of and then
[10:06] they realize they're in the tribulation
[10:08] period
[10:09] can you imagine some of these former
[10:11] followers that one day when the rapture
[10:13] takes place in Los Angeles falls in and
[10:15] all these things that they're laughing
[10:17] at in making fun of today and they will
[10:19] see every prophecy letter by letter and
[10:22] word by word come to pass and then they
[10:25] realize oh god what have I going god
[10:27] what have I done and they look into the
[10:30] mirror and what do they look and they
[10:32] see behind and in the mirror the
[10:34] backdrop of the tribulation why because
[10:39] they listen to some website they listen
[10:41] to some preacher they're tried to lead
[10:43] them off forward instead of taking the
[10:45] Bible the scriptural message and the
[10:46] vindicated prophet of God and trying to
[10:49] get dressed by the word they listen to a
[10:51] date than a car on a barrel and strip
[10:53] the women off and take them back to
[10:54] Laodicea and they're trying to get ready
[10:57] to meet Jesus of that mirror oh my
[10:59] brother sister will never work
[11:01] we've got to have the light of this day
[11:03] in order to reflect our lineage remember
[11:10] the only illumination
[11:12] present-tense illumination as around the
[11:15] reveal word of this hour
[11:16] everything else is darkness Laodicea is
[11:20] got the mirror of the Bible but I can't
[11:22] see they're in darkness how many mirrors
[11:28] you got if you ain't got light you still
[11:31] can't see
[11:33] [Music]
