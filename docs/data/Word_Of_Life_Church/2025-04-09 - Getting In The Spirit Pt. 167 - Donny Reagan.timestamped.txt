[38:05] lifted. This holy fire is burning inside
[38:09] of
[38:11] me. I cannot hold it inside. I cannot
[38:16] keep it quiet. This holy fire is burning
[38:20] inside of
[38:22] me. I cannot hold it inside. I cannot
[38:27] keep it quiet. This holy fire is burning
[38:32] inside of
[38:35] me. I've been touched by a
[38:39] fire. So let the world come and watch me
[38:44] burn.
[38:46] [Music]
[38:48] Shout it from the
[38:51] rooftops. Shout it till every one has
[38:58] heard. I've been touched by a
[39:02] fire. So let the world come and watch me
[39:09] burn. Oh, shout it from the
[39:14] rooftops. Shout it till
[39:17] everyone has
[39:20] heard. I cannot hold it inside. I cannot
[39:25] keep it quiet. This holy fire is burning
[39:29] inside of
[39:31] me. I cannot hold it inside. I cannot
[39:36] keep it quiet. This holy fire is burning
[39:41] inside of me.
[39:45] I've been touched by your
[39:48] fire. So let the world come and watch me
[39:54] burn.
[39:55] [Music]
[40:07] Praise the Lord.
[40:10] I'm glad that fire is still here. Aren't
[40:12] you? Yeah. And he's got it. If you ain't
[40:16] got it, you can get it before you leave
[40:17] tonight. Yes, sir. How's that? Okay. You
[40:20] can be fixed, totally fixed, changed,
[40:25] transformed. You know, whenever a person
[40:27] that has a seed of God in them, when
[40:30] they hear the
[40:33] word, their response is so different
[40:37] than someone else who hears the same
[40:40] word but does not have it in them to
[40:44] represent
[40:45] that. That will be
[40:47] our setting tonight where we resume in
[40:50] Genesis 24. If you want to turn there
[40:52] with
[40:54] me, it always makes you
[40:57] feel really sad for people in reality,
[41:00] for those who do hear truths and turn
[41:03] away. The scripture tells us, of course,
[41:06] that it would be better for them to have
[41:08] never known or ever even heard it than
[41:12] after they have heard it to turn and go
[41:16] back because it's a great great thing
[41:18] when God puts light in our in our
[41:23] paths. Genesis 24:21.
[41:28] And the man wondering at her held his
[41:32] peace to wit whether the Lord had made
[41:35] his journey prosperous or not. And it
[41:40] came to pass as the camels had done
[41:42] drinking that the man took a golden
[41:45] earring of half a shekele weight. I want
[41:49] you to notice in the order that this
[41:50] works. She doesn't get the earrings,
[41:54] none of the gold, none of the gifts,
[41:56] none of the adornment before she does
[42:00] her
[42:00] part. She does her part without a
[42:04] promise of
[42:06] anything. Not if you do this, I give you
[42:09] that. God ain't looking for a trade. No.
[42:13] God wants our all and then he'll reward
[42:16] us for it. And it came to pass as the
[42:19] camels had done drinking 60 trips up and
[42:25] down to the
[42:26] well that the man took a golden earring
[42:30] of half a shekele weight and two
[42:32] bracelets for her hands of 10 shekels
[42:37] weight of gold. Now this is not tinfall
[42:40] stuff, okay? There were there was no
[42:43] Chinese market at that time. This wasn't
[42:45] big lot stuff. I mean, this is stuff
[42:49] fit for a
[42:53] princess. But if you're going to have
[42:55] princess adornment in a princess
[43:00] character and said, "Whose
[43:04] daughter whose
[43:07] daughter art thou? Tell
[43:11] me I pray thee."
[43:16] two-fold question. Is there room in thy
[43:19] father's house for us to lodge
[43:22] in? Now, you're looking at a wife now to
[43:26] marry a rich man. So, he wants to
[43:30] know, no doubt Abraham had told him a
[43:33] little bit about his brother, what to
[43:35] expect, what kind of a person, what's
[43:39] your lineage, where do you come from?
[43:42] And she said unto
[43:43] him, I am the daughter of
[43:48] Bethule, the son of
[43:51] Mila, which she bare unto Nahor. Now,
[43:56] unless you've already studied the
[43:57] genealogies of the Bible and notice the
[44:01] order, the way they say this, you might
[44:04] skip right over the top of it. But this
[44:07] is so unusual and out of the ordinary. A
[44:11] lot of times the woman's name was not
[44:15] even mentioned, the mother not even
[44:17] mentioned at all, much less to be
[44:22] said before the
[44:25] man. Now notice how she responds. I am
[44:28] the daughter of Bethule, the son
[44:32] of
[44:35] Mila, which she bare unto Nahor.
[44:40] She said, "Moreover, unto him we have
[44:43] both straw and proender,
[44:47] enough room to lodge in." I love the way
[44:53] Rebecca answers these
[44:56] questions.
[44:58] Eleaser puts them out in a certain
[45:04] order. She answers in the exact order.
[45:09] Now, she doesn't go way out here and
[45:11] take a big spin about 40 acres out and
[45:14] come back around and come back this way
[45:15] and then go that way and then go that
[45:17] way and way over there and then come
[45:19] back and never did really say anything.
[45:21] She wasn't a politician.
[45:26] She was a bride to be.
[45:29] So apparently she thought it was
[45:31] important to answer in the same order
[45:37] that the questions were asked. So you
[45:40] see the real bride has no problem with
[45:43] divine order.
[45:45] Matter of fact, she likes it. It helps
[45:47] her to keep straight. That's true.
[45:51] She said, "Moreover, unto him, we have
[45:52] both straw and proender enough and room
[45:56] to lodge in." Now look at the man's
[45:59] response. And the man bowed down his
[46:05] head and
[46:07] worshiped the Lord.
[46:11] Bowed down his head and worshiped the
[46:15] Lord. Why?
[46:17] God has went before him.
[46:23] Let us bow down our heads as we
[46:31] pray. Our heavenly
[46:35] father, we stand here tonight as the
[46:40] antitype of Rebecca that day.
[46:44] You have sent to us an EER
[46:49] call. There's certain questions that's
[46:51] been asked to
[46:53] us. They've been asked in a certain
[46:56] order. We might have the right
[46:59] answers, but if we don't answer them in
[47:02] the right order, it proves that we did
[47:05] not listen well enough or we did not
[47:09] believe order counted.
[47:12] So we answered back the way we thought
[47:16] we
[47:17] should. So I pray that we as your people
[47:21] of this day would listen carefully to
[47:25] what's being said and what's being asked
[47:29] again to
[47:31] us and that we will be able to answer
[47:34] with the words that are pleasing to you.
[47:39] We believe the great Holy Spirit of God
[47:42] is going around this earth of
[47:45] ours searching out looking for hungering
[47:51] hearts and they'll be asked certain
[47:55] things. They'll be inquired
[47:58] upon and you will listen to what they
[48:01] say, the way they say it, the intensity.
[48:06] Is it just
[48:07] repetition or is it a soul that set on
[48:11] fire? May we say the right things,
[48:14] Lord? No doubt it was a very simple
[48:17] thing that day when little had it right.
[48:20] Just a little simple woman. Little did
[48:24] she know that by saying the right words
[48:28] and answering in the right way and in
[48:32] the right
[48:33] order what you would do for her
[48:36] boys. Father, I pray that you'd speak to
[48:38] us tonight. Take your word, open our
[48:42] understanding. May we be able to share
[48:46] in a little bit more of your divine
[48:49] knowledge tonight. Lord, it's in the
[48:52] name of the Lord Jesus we ask it. Amen.
[48:56] God bless you. You may be seated.
[49:06] I'm sure that we have all thought about
[49:09] this many times since
[49:11] we've first heard this preached and as
[49:15] we hear it touched on again from time to
[49:18] time of what a difficult thing laid
[49:23] before both Eleaser and before
[49:28] Rebecca. He has more of the
[49:32] insight as far as to what lays before
[49:36] her destiny. She doesn't quite yet see
[49:40] it, no doubt, but all she knows
[49:44] is she had this
[49:47] supernatural
[49:49] experience and it wasn't an emotion,
[49:53] though no doubt emotion came with it.
[49:57] I honestly don't believe that we could
[49:59] come in
[50:00] contact with an angel of
[50:04] God and it keep from moving us in such a
[50:09] profound way. Some might cry. I I
[50:13] imagine it could make you shout. I
[50:16] suppose the visitations that I've had
[50:20] from the power of God, not the blessings
[50:22] of God, but the power of God, most of
[50:26] the time have left me
[50:29] startled,
[50:32] afraid, afraid to look
[50:35] around, afraid to do much
[50:38] shouting. Now, the blessings of God
[50:40] aren't that way. the blessings of God.
[50:43] You hoop and holler and scream and glory
[50:46] hallelujah.
[50:49] Brother Biscll told me when he was with
[50:51] brother Brandham and he had shared
[50:54] several visions and things that come to
[50:56] him and he took his finger and went
[50:59] across and pointed to a certain city
[51:01] over there and told brother Biscll who
[51:03] lived there and this and this and this
[51:06] told him about a certain man, things
[51:08] that would happen and the days that were
[51:11] to come. And then he come to himself
[51:16] after it happened like a man that was
[51:19] coming conscience after he had passed
[51:22] out or went into another sphere and come
[51:27] back. And then he told brother Biscll
[51:31] that of all the times that he's come to
[51:34] me and it still makes me react this way.
[51:38] And then I hear people talking about
[51:40] angels coming to them and I think their
[51:43] their reaction is so different from that
[51:46] of John. The reaction is so different
[51:49] from that of our Elijah. And this
[51:53] Rebecca had a a visitation from an angel
[51:57] of God. And I guess what I look for
[52:01] myself is the the
[52:04] identification of an angelic visitation.
[52:07] and what it does to a person's life, how
[52:11] it impacts them. And what I see here in
[52:16] her is an
[52:19] immediate
[52:21] response to a message in her day. Now,
[52:26] Moses when he wrote this, he does not
[52:29] mention anything about her being a
[52:32] static emotion. No doubt she was. But
[52:36] that wasn't what caught Moses attention.
[52:39] Now remember, Moses is writing this
[52:42] years after it took place because God
[52:46] catches him into this supernatural place
[52:50] and carries him back in time. So he's
[52:53] writing it by vision. So it would be
[52:56] like that Moses is watching a movie so
[52:59] you can understand it. and he's sitting
[53:02] there with his eyes open watching this
[53:04] movie and he's writing it. So, he's
[53:06] seeing it. He's hearing it. He's he's
[53:09] catching it from several different
[53:10] paradigms and he's he's watching it.
[53:13] He's seeing it. No doubt if God knew
[53:15] that it was overwhelming him, God would
[53:17] slow down the vision where he could see
[53:20] it and catch up as he's writing it down.
[53:22] And and Moses is watching her response
[53:25] and he's hearing what Eluser said.
[53:28] Abraham didn't write this down. Isaac
[53:30] never wrote it down. Isaac wasn't even
[53:32] there. But God carried away a prophet
[53:35] into the fourth dimension and be able to
[53:38] convey this to him so all these
[53:40] generations would have it. Aren't you
[53:41] glad he did? So he doesn't mention
[53:44] anything about Rebecca taking off and
[53:46] just by mean having a march around the
[53:48] walls of Jericho and you know some great
[53:51] supernatural something another. But he
[53:53] does take note to the response of an
[53:58] angelic
[53:59] visitation and he identifies it with her
[54:03] response to an angel's
[54:06] message. I find this to be a great great
[54:10] phenomenon. I want you to notice that
[54:12] brother Ram said, "So why did Rebecca
[54:14] make that sudden move?" Now notice the
[54:18] response that another prophet now picks
[54:21] up about Rebecca of being able to
[54:24] identify that it was a supernatural
[54:28] something that influenced her. So why
[54:31] did Rebecca make that sudden move? Why
[54:34] did she go to the waters of life so
[54:39] quickly? Notice, not emotionally, not
[54:42] erratic, not despondent, not screaming
[54:45] to the top of her voice and those
[54:47] things. We believe in all that. But
[54:49] notice how a person can respond to an
[54:54] angel visiting them that they move
[54:57] quickly and they go to the waters of
[55:00] life suddenly and there's something
[55:03] pulling them. It makes me wonder if
[55:07] we've recognized the angels of God when
[55:10] they visited us
[55:13] because we have in our mind what we
[55:15] think people will do when angels are
[55:19] around them. Now listen, why could the
[55:23] angel speak to her? Because she was a
[55:28] blood relation to Isaac. And that's who
[55:32] the angel can speak to tonight is a
[55:36] blood relation. By the blood were born
[55:39] into the body of Christ. Rebecca was
[55:42] Isaac's own cousin by both fathers which
[55:46] made their blood relation. And the bride
[55:48] of Jesus Christ is sanctified through
[55:51] the blood of Christ and an open vessel
[55:55] for the Holy Spirit to speak to. She
[55:59] made her decisions quick. Now notice
[56:04] again here we have another prophet that
[56:06] is looking back and catching this
[56:10] setting of Genesis
[56:12] 24. And again another prophet and he
[56:17] something that sticks out to him that is
[56:20] so noticeable. She made her decisions
[56:23] quick. Watch her real quick. Then in the
[56:30] meeting quickly, if they're ordained to
[56:35] life, they'll know it. Amen. Now watch.
[56:39] If they're ordained to life, they'll
[56:43] know it. There'll be a response there.
[56:46] There's something in the
[56:50] message that stirs them. Praise be to
[56:55] God. Amen. That's what
[56:58] stirred
[57:00] Rebecca. The
[57:02] message stirred her. That makes me feel
[57:07] like having a spell about right now cuz
[57:09] that's what stirred me.
[57:12] Praise the Lord. That's what stirred
[57:16] Rebecca. The message stirred her. Angel
[57:22] was leading her. Oh, can't you see her?
[57:27] Picture the angel of the Lord leading
[57:31] her. Then she was stirred and
[57:35] immediately when she watered the camel,
[57:38] the gift went on her. He be to take out
[57:42] the earrings, which means faith cometh
[57:46] by hearing. You see, put the bracelets
[57:49] on, the work of her hands. He got
[57:55] her ready. He got her ready. So, who is
[58:02] it then that is going to be the bride of
[58:06] Isaac? The only woman that's going to be
[58:10] his bride is the woman that Elely Ezer's
[58:15] message got her ready. Amen. Well, I
[58:19] don't know how you feel about it, but it
[58:21] makes some sense to me that we're on
[58:23] this camel train and now a lot of folks
[58:26] are saying, "Well, we don't need the
[58:28] message no more." You're stripping
[58:30] yourself off. You're getting rid of your
[58:33] earrings spiritual. You're getting rid
[58:36] of your spiritual bracelets. You're
[58:38] getting rid of the very things that was
[58:41] given to you to help make us ready to
[58:44] meet our rising. Well, if it's all the
[58:48] same to you, whether it is or not, I'm
[58:50] going to keep mine.
[58:52] Praise the Lord. He got her ready as
[58:56] soon as she began to notice now to
[58:59] water, give the waters of life, testify,
[59:04] tell others to get the message out, tell
[59:08] them what has happened to you. Now,
[59:12] watch what he does now. his response to
[59:15] her reaction. So, it's an a an action
[59:18] and then a reaction, then another action
[59:22] and another reaction and another action
[59:26] and another reaction. So, it's one after
[59:29] another after another. So, it's coming
[59:31] in consecutive order and she's not
[59:34] breaking over out of place and say, "All
[59:37] right, now let me do this." But she's
[59:38] waiting and watching and listening. So
[59:42] she does what she's impressed to do, the
[59:45] impulse of the hour, which is the
[59:48] pulsation of faith supernaturally that
[59:52] only the elect can have. And then when
[59:54] she does her part, she stops and he does
[59:58] his. Then he does his part and then he
[1:00:01] stops. Now watch after she waters the
[1:00:04] camels, then he puts the earrings and
[1:00:06] the bracelets. And then verse 23, and
[1:00:10] said, whose daughter art thou? Tell me,
[1:00:13] I pray thee, is there room in thy
[1:00:16] father's house for us to lodge in? Now,
[1:00:19] I'd like to resume from that on what we
[1:00:22] looked at last Wednesday night, and
[1:00:24] instead of asking you whose daughter you
[1:00:27] are, I want to ask you who you are. Now,
[1:00:32] it's very important that we find out who
[1:00:35] we are. I I believe that surely most of
[1:00:39] us that have been sitting around the
[1:00:41] message very long that we are convinced
[1:00:44] that God has sent a prophet and
[1:00:47] prophesied one in the last days. Most of
[1:00:50] you, probably a big portion of it
[1:00:52] anyway, you were you've come to the
[1:00:54] message many years ago. Some here are
[1:00:57] people tonight. We have second, third,
[1:00:58] fourth generation people that have been
[1:01:00] around the message. We've got others
[1:01:02] that are first generation people. And
[1:01:05] you're probably like I was. You waited
[1:01:08] out. You were checking it out. Well, who
[1:01:10] could it be? If God promised there's
[1:01:12] going to be a prophet, then who would it
[1:01:14] be? You may have read this book, that
[1:01:16] book. You're looking in a in a conquest
[1:01:18] and a search to be able to find out who
[1:01:20] it was. For some of you, you were raised
[1:01:23] in a message church and then you were
[1:01:25] children years ago. Now you're married
[1:01:27] and you've got children and you're
[1:01:29] raising your children under that same
[1:01:32] influence and hopefully by the grace of
[1:01:34] God helping them to see that it is God's
[1:01:38] promised word to send this in the last
[1:01:41] days. Now, but what I want to ask you is
[1:01:44] more so tonight than are you not so much
[1:01:47] just a message believer that truly, but
[1:01:50] who are you by your identification of
[1:01:54] your soul? Are we just mortals that are
[1:01:58] here in time trying to do the very best
[1:02:01] that we can? And do we believe the
[1:02:04] report of our fathers or maybe our
[1:02:07] mothers who told us that we were
[1:02:10] worthless and we would never amount to
[1:02:12] much of anything in our life. I know
[1:02:14] many of you were told that because I'm
[1:02:16] your pastor and I've counseledled with
[1:02:18] you. And and is that what shapes you? Is
[1:02:21] that what molds you into the way you
[1:02:24] even receive the word of this hour? You
[1:02:27] see, those things can be uh they can
[1:02:29] either be a stumbling block before us or
[1:02:32] they can be a stepping stone. And some
[1:02:35] will come to the word of the hour with
[1:02:37] that same molding that their father put
[1:02:40] in them naturally. And they will find
[1:02:42] theirel trying to climb the spiritual
[1:02:44] ladder in God by the same influence that
[1:02:48] they had by their daddy. But that won't
[1:02:50] work when it comes to God because God,
[1:02:53] in case you don't know it, is not your
[1:02:55] daddy.
[1:02:56] That's right. And maybe your daddy
[1:02:58] didn't know how to love you, right? But
[1:03:00] God does. And you'll never be able to
[1:03:03] serve God. I mean, there's a sister
[1:03:05] sitting right there tonight that asked
[1:03:07] me, sent me an email some time ago and
[1:03:09] say, "How can I be able to love a God
[1:03:13] who I relate to as my husband and that
[1:03:17] I've been abused by men? I've been
[1:03:20] mistreated by men. and I find myself
[1:03:23] relating to God the same way. And my
[1:03:27] response was back to this sister, first
[1:03:30] of all, you've got to realize God and
[1:03:32] your husbands ain't the same person. And
[1:03:35] you've got to be in that and your
[1:03:38] mindset to realize he loves you with
[1:03:41] your faults and your failures. And just
[1:03:44] because men have abused you does not
[1:03:47] mean that God wants to. As a matter of
[1:03:50] fact, there has never been a a a love, a
[1:03:53] heart, a being, an epitome of love as
[1:03:56] great as our God is. And Word of Life
[1:03:59] Church said, "But if we're not careful,
[1:04:02] we will find ourselves going back to
[1:04:05] that same old molding." And if you had
[1:04:07] to constantly prove yourself to your
[1:04:09] father because you had a sister or an
[1:04:12] older brother or whatever more that your
[1:04:14] father compared you to them all the time
[1:04:17] and you never met up to that standard.
[1:04:19] And if you're not careful, you'll bring
[1:04:21] the same mindset right into serving the
[1:04:23] Lord. And you're constantly trying to
[1:04:26] please God because you know there's the
[1:04:28] big brother still in church. And it may
[1:04:30] happen to be your pastor or it may
[1:04:32] happen to be some other preacher or some
[1:04:34] other person and you find yourself in
[1:04:36] the same relationship mentally in church
[1:04:40] that you were in your home. So there you
[1:04:42] are, you know, as a a 50 year old man,
[1:04:44] 25 year old man, 80 year old woman,
[1:04:47] whatever you are, reliving the same type
[1:04:50] of life that you were when you were at
[1:04:52] home. And Satan keeps us so bound down
[1:04:56] by such stuff. I'm asking you tonight,
[1:04:59] who are you? Is this your second
[1:05:03] childhood? Are you reliving your natural
[1:05:06] childhood in church? Are you reliving?
[1:05:10] Are you reliving that life that was
[1:05:13] emboldened in you by your father, by
[1:05:15] your mother? And and I know that there's
[1:05:18] some here and some who listen to me
[1:05:19] preach and stream our services that were
[1:05:22] actually uh adopted by other people
[1:05:25] naturally because their parents didn't
[1:05:27] want them. I cannot imagine what what it
[1:05:30] would feel like to be that way. And I
[1:05:32] know the type of influence and and
[1:05:35] shaping and the molding and the
[1:05:37] character of an individual that
[1:05:39] something that like that can be. And
[1:05:41] they will battle it until God can give
[1:05:44] them a revelation that he will never do
[1:05:47] to them what their father or their
[1:05:50] mother did. God will never put you up
[1:05:53] for adoption. I wish somebody would
[1:05:55] preach with me tonight. God will never I
[1:05:58] don't care how many mistakes you make.
[1:06:01] If you are a son or daughter of God,
[1:06:03] I'll repeat it to you again what I
[1:06:06] repeated during the meetings that Martin
[1:06:07] Luther said. When I look at myself, I
[1:06:10] don't know how I could be saved. But
[1:06:12] when I look at Christ Jesus, I don't
[1:06:15] know how I could be lost. Let me just
[1:06:18] say to you tonight, if you're a son or
[1:06:20] daughter of God, there's not one thing
[1:06:23] you can do in time that will ever take
[1:06:26] your name off of that lamb's book of
[1:06:30] life. Oh yes, I've made so many
[1:06:32] mistakes. I know you have, and I have,
[1:06:35] too. But I'll tell you one thing. We're
[1:06:37] talking about a love that is so
[1:06:39] powerful, a security that is so secure.
[1:06:43] There ain't enough powers in hell. There
[1:06:45] ain't enough demons of darkness. There's
[1:06:48] not enough sickness. There's not enough
[1:06:50] affliction. Oh, hallelujah. Hype or
[1:06:53] death or principalities or powers or
[1:06:56] things present or things to come that
[1:06:59] can separate us from the love of God
[1:07:01] which is in Christ Jesus. But brother
[1:07:04] Donnie, you don't know what I've been
[1:07:05] through. I may not. But I know a God who
[1:07:08] does. And he's greater than all you've
[1:07:10] been through and all that I've been
[1:07:12] through and all of your disappointments
[1:07:15] and all of my disappointments. And there
[1:07:17] is nothing that can take you out of your
[1:07:21] father's love. And the only thing that
[1:07:23] will hinder you from being loved the way
[1:07:26] he wants to love you is your own self.
[1:07:33] Don't you understand the devil cannot
[1:07:35] stop you? your mother, your father, your
[1:07:38] wife, your daddy, whoever more. They
[1:07:41] cannot stop you if you don't allow them
[1:07:43] to.
[1:07:46] Right? Here's the person right here.
[1:07:48] Here's the person that we need to focus
[1:07:51] all of our stuff in. But you know how we
[1:07:53] are? We want to blame everybody else.
[1:07:55] Well, I'm this way because of so and so.
[1:07:57] It's the people of the church. Nobody
[1:08:00] likes me. I'm this and that and the
[1:08:01] other. Why don't you point them fingers
[1:08:04] where they need to be pointed right back
[1:08:06] to you and say, "God, help me. I'm the
[1:08:09] culprit, Lord. I'm the problem. I need
[1:08:12] more of you. I need more of your love.
[1:08:15] Help me to move beyond all that sort of
[1:08:17] thing." Well, nobody loves me. I'll tell
[1:08:19] you one thing. If there's a devil, I
[1:08:21] want to be on the committee that kicks
[1:08:23] him down into hell. It's that old feel
[1:08:25] sorry for yourself, devil. And nobody
[1:08:28] loves me. Nobody likes me. What in the
[1:08:30] world are we ever going to get out from
[1:08:32] under that demon out of hell and say, "I
[1:08:35] am greatly loved. I am thought of. God
[1:08:38] thought about me before the world began.
[1:08:41] My pastor studies so he can feed me. My
[1:08:44] pastor prays so he can feed me." Come
[1:08:47] on, somebody. We need to rise as a army
[1:08:50] of God and say, "I'm sick and tired of
[1:08:52] being a little baby around here. I need
[1:08:55] to grow up and be a man. I need to grow
[1:08:58] up and be a daughter of God and get this
[1:09:01] old feel sorry for myself. Pity me, pity
[1:09:04] me. No, you need to be a soldier in the
[1:09:07] army of the living God. And if you can
[1:09:09] ever do that, you realize it ain't pity
[1:09:12] me, pity you. It'll be us pitying the
[1:09:15] devil. Cuz you'll be one powerhouse of
[1:09:18] God. You'll be one son or daughter of
[1:09:21] God that hell will say, "Get out of
[1:09:23] their way. Here they come.
[1:09:30] Woo!
[1:09:32] Who in the world was that for? Was that
[1:09:34] for you?
[1:09:39] Who are you?
[1:09:42] Good for nothing, worthless.
[1:09:50] My
[1:09:51] Jesus paid the ultimate price
[1:09:55] that you could sit here tonight and be
[1:09:57] free.
[1:09:59] Amen. That you could worship and love
[1:10:01] him and serve him. That don't sound like
[1:10:04] a piece of junk and trash to me.
[1:10:10] Hallelujah.
[1:10:15] Who are
[1:10:21] you? So,
[1:10:23] let's see if we can find the
[1:10:27] answer.
[1:10:29] Jesus is the
[1:10:31] beginning of the creation of
[1:10:36] God. Jesus is the beginning of the
[1:10:39] creation of
[1:10:40] God. Listen to this. and knoweth it not.
[1:10:43] Unto the angel of the church of the lad
[1:10:45] of sins, right? These things sayaith the
[1:10:49] amen, the faithful and true witness, the
[1:10:54] beginning of the creation of God. This
[1:10:57] is Jesus talking about
[1:11:00] himself. Listen to the way the prophet
[1:11:02] explains this. When God the Spirit was
[1:11:06] created in the form of a
[1:11:09] man, that was God being created.
[1:11:16] Hallelujah.
[1:11:18] I wonder where in the world this seventh
[1:11:21] grader got this kind of education.
[1:11:27] Hallelujah.
[1:11:29] I tell you one thing, I went to Kentucky
[1:11:31] schools, too, but I sure didn't get that
[1:11:33] at the seventh grade or the 11th grade
[1:11:35] or any other grade. When God the Spirit
[1:11:38] was created in the form of a man, that
[1:11:40] was God being created. God the creator
[1:11:47] himself becoming a creation.
[1:11:52] God who made the
[1:11:54] dirt, made the calcium, made the pot
[1:11:58] ash, cosmic light,
[1:12:01] petroleums, took the thing together and
[1:12:04] created
[1:12:06] himself in the beginning of the creation
[1:12:10] of God. The amen, the final. Amen means
[1:12:16] so be it. The final of God. when God
[1:12:20] completed in his
[1:12:22] creation. Now, in the church age book,
[1:12:24] he goes into this in a little bit more
[1:12:27] detail. That's in the latest in church
[1:12:29] if you'd like to read it. And he said,
[1:12:31] "The beginning of the creation of God."
[1:12:33] This is who the Lord Jesus says he is.
[1:12:37] But those words don't mean exactly as
[1:12:40] they sound to us. just taking them the
[1:12:45] way they sound. Isn't this pecoo? Now,
[1:12:48] God says something, but he actually
[1:12:51] don't mean it the way it sounds.
[1:12:56] How in the world am I supposed to
[1:12:58] understand? So, God says something, but
[1:13:00] I can't really take it the way it
[1:13:02] sounds. I I I have to have help.
[1:13:07] Well, glory to God. Thank God for the
[1:13:10] help of Malachi 4. Amen. Thank God for
[1:13:13] the help of pastors. Thank God for the
[1:13:14] help of evangelist, teachers. Praise the
[1:13:17] Lord. How many's ever read something in
[1:13:20] your Bible and come to church and one of
[1:13:21] the ministers get up and preach on you
[1:13:22] just say, "Lord have mercy. I read that
[1:13:24] same thing. I didn't understand nothing
[1:13:26] about that." You know why? That the way
[1:13:28] it sounded to you was totally wrong. And
[1:13:30] then God used a man and he say, "Well,
[1:13:32] praise the Lord. That's absolutely
[1:13:33] awesome." He's still doing the same
[1:13:35] thing. Right now, watch those words
[1:13:37] don't mean exactly as they sound to us.
[1:13:39] is taking them the way they sound has
[1:13:42] made some believe. In fact, multitudes
[1:13:45] of people get the idea that Jesus was
[1:13:48] the first creation of God, making him
[1:13:51] lower than the
[1:13:54] Godhead.
[1:13:56] A then this first creation created all
[1:14:00] the rest of the universe and whatsoever
[1:14:04] it contains. Now you may not be aware of
[1:14:06] this as this as much as what Christendom
[1:14:09] around the world believes. This started
[1:14:11] in the first century got really big on
[1:14:12] the 3rd century Aryanism and all that
[1:14:15] went divided. It's where they come to
[1:14:16] the nian council 325 AD. So it was with
[1:14:19] this concept of who he actually was. Was
[1:14:22] he a lower god and no way no way that
[1:14:26] they believed he was the only god. So he
[1:14:28] was the beginning of the creation of
[1:14:30] God. So God the father created this this
[1:14:33] son which was a little bit less than God
[1:14:36] and then he used that as a tool to
[1:14:39] create everything else. So Jesus was
[1:14:42] just a mere man as one message preacher
[1:14:45] famous message preacher I might say said
[1:14:48] many many years ago that Jesus don't
[1:14:51] even have his own
[1:14:53] angels and Jesus better be
[1:14:57] careful he might lose his throne.
[1:15:02] I believe there's some of the dumbest
[1:15:04] idiots called preachers in this message
[1:15:06] that I've ever seen. I've seen baboons
[1:15:08] in Africa with more sense than some of
[1:15:12] the men around this message that claim
[1:15:13] to be preachers.
[1:15:18] Donnie, watch. If a man's called of God
[1:15:20] and he interprets the word like that, he
[1:15:23] needs to get a job.
[1:15:27] Pick up pop cans on the side of the
[1:15:29] road. Make pretzels and sell them. Make,
[1:15:31] you know, whatever. Get out of the pull
[1:15:33] pit before you damn yourself
[1:15:38] and hundreds to hell with you.
[1:15:43] You imagine a preacher saying, "Jesus
[1:15:45] better be careful.
[1:15:48] Jesus ain't got no angels.
[1:16:01] M but that is not right. You know that
[1:16:05] doesn't light up with the rest of the
[1:16:07] Bible. He
[1:16:08] says the words are he is the
[1:16:12] beginner or author of the creation of
[1:16:16] God. Now we know for assurityity that
[1:16:19] Jesus is
[1:16:22] God. Not one of them. Right.
[1:16:27] The only one.
[1:16:29] Jesus is God. Now we know for sure that
[1:16:33] Jesus is God. Now we know for sure that
[1:16:37] Jesus is God. No, the needle ain't
[1:16:40] stuck. I just want you to get it. Now we
[1:16:42] know for assurityity that Jesus is God.
[1:16:47] Very God. And I'm very glad. Are you all
[1:16:53] very glad? Jesus ain't one of the gods.
[1:16:56] He's very God. And I'm very glad because
[1:17:01] I'm very bride.
[1:17:03] I ain't halfway bride. I ain't want to
[1:17:06] be bride. I'm very bride. And I'm very
[1:17:09] glad. I'm very bride. And I'm very glad
[1:17:12] Jesus is very God. Anybody very happy to
[1:17:15] be with me on very Wednesday night?
[1:17:21] Who are you? I am very bright. If we
[1:17:25] would ask Jesus, are you one of many?
[1:17:28] Are you the second one? He would say, I
[1:17:31] am the alpha and the omega, the
[1:17:33] beginning and the end. Amen.
[1:17:40] How can men, brother Daryl, who was in
[1:17:43] the prophets meetings and rub shoulders
[1:17:46] with a prophet of
[1:17:48] God, the one I just quoted, making those
[1:17:51] foolish
[1:17:54] remarks.
[1:17:56] Of course, when a man hung around the
[1:17:58] prophet of God for years and years,
[1:18:00] still baptized in titles, and wasn't
[1:18:02] rebaptized for years afterwards, that
[1:18:05] tells you a whole lot right there.
[1:18:09] Good Lord, what in the world am I doing
[1:18:10] over in this avenue? Somebody needed
[1:18:12] that, I guess, out on the airways. Well,
[1:18:14] there you go. Take it. Take
[1:18:17] it. Notice John 1:3. All
[1:18:23] things were made by him
[1:18:26] and without him was not anything made
[1:18:31] that was made.
[1:18:35] Now, does that sound like a little boy
[1:18:37] up in heaven playing with tinker tonker
[1:18:38] toys up there to
[1:18:43] y'all? God.
[1:18:47] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:18:50] He is the one of whom it is said in
[1:18:52] Genesis
[1:18:53] 1:1, in the beginning, God created the
[1:18:58] heaven and the
[1:19:00] earth. But now
[1:19:02] listen, but now he is standing in the
[1:19:05] midst of the
[1:19:07] church as he stands there
[1:19:11] revealing who he is. Oh,
[1:19:15] notice. So the question is being asked
[1:19:19] this way too
[1:19:21] Jesus who are
[1:19:27] you and now he's want to ask you and who
[1:19:31] are
[1:19:33] you millions are responding and ask him
[1:19:38] who are you
[1:19:40] Jesus and some of the poor ignorant
[1:19:42] people on the message and believe in two
[1:19:45] lords
[1:19:48] Lord have mercy. Heathens,
[1:19:51] idol worshippers,
[1:19:56] I don't know what in the world it is
[1:19:57] about Wednesday night up here. Has John
[1:19:59] the Baptist been in here today? Has
[1:20:00] anybody seen him?
[1:20:02] Why is that old fell show up on
[1:20:04] Wednesday nights anyhow? Of course, he's
[1:20:06] here Sunday morning, too.
[1:20:09] He must go to this church, recognize.
[1:20:12] Lord have
[1:20:14] mercy. But dar, you come up here and
[1:20:16] take my notes and finish
[1:20:19] this. Listen to this. Now, oh, glory to
[1:20:23] God. He is standing in the midst of the
[1:20:25] church as he stands there revealing who
[1:20:28] he
[1:20:29] is in this last age. He calls himself
[1:20:33] the author of the creation of
[1:20:37] God. This is another creation.
[1:20:42] This has to do with the church.
[1:20:48] This is a special
[1:20:51] designation of himself.
[1:20:57] He hallelujah is the
[1:21:01] creator of that church.
[1:21:05] The heavenly
[1:21:07] bridegroom
[1:21:09] created his own bride.
[1:21:14] Now, who are
[1:21:15] you? What are
[1:21:20] you? I am a
[1:21:23] creation of God.
[1:21:26] I'm not the old one patched. I'm not the
[1:21:29] old one try to halfway fix it up. Amen.
[1:21:33] I am a new creature.
[1:21:36] I'm not the same person I was.
[1:21:41] The heavenly
[1:21:42] bridegroom created his own
[1:21:45] bride. As the spirit of God, he came
[1:21:48] down and created in the Virgin
[1:21:51] Mary the cells from which his body was
[1:21:55] born. Now remember, in the early 50s,
[1:21:58] the prophet actually believed that the
[1:22:01] spirit of God came upon the
[1:22:04] egg in Mary's
[1:22:07] womb. Oh, come on now. Don't sit there
[1:22:09] and look at me like that. Let's allow
[1:22:11] him growth, children.
[1:22:14] That's what he believed.
[1:22:17] But oh my, when the revelation of God
[1:22:20] come, my
[1:22:22] He came down and created in the Virgin
[1:22:25] Mary the cells
[1:22:28] from which his body was born. I want to
[1:22:31] repeat that. He created the very cells
[1:22:33] in the womb of Mary for that body. It
[1:22:37] was not enough for the Holy Spirit to
[1:22:40] simply give life to a human
[1:22:44] oam supplied by Mary. If God did not
[1:22:49] need the productivity of her ovaries,
[1:22:52] then God don't need you and I to help
[1:22:54] out with trying to make our salvation
[1:22:57] better, our salvation more holy, our
[1:23:00] walk with God more perfect. Let's just
[1:23:03] obey him and do the simplicity of the
[1:23:06] gospel. That's all he wants. He wants an
[1:23:09] incubator out of our body. He's not
[1:23:12] wanting you. You'll never bring your
[1:23:14] flesh perfect. You'll never bring it to
[1:23:17] a place. Oh, I wish somebody would
[1:23:18] preach with me tonight. If you could get
[1:23:21] in your mind, all he wants this body to
[1:23:23] be is no more than an incubator. He
[1:23:26] placed the seed of God in you. You took
[1:23:28] the breath of life and the spirit of God
[1:23:31] came upon it and watered that seed. Just
[1:23:34] go ahead and
[1:23:36] incubate. Give it a warm place. Carry it
[1:23:40] around. Oh, glory to God. But let the
[1:23:43] great creator do the work.
[1:23:46] [Applause]
[1:23:52] But we want to make a naval.
[1:23:56] We want to make a
[1:23:59] navl to the word attached to our ideas.
[1:24:05] And we want to give the word baby our
[1:24:08] opinions. And I think and this is what I
[1:24:10] believe and this is what I feel. The
[1:24:13] word ain't got no navl.
[1:24:20] Lord have
[1:24:22] mercy. Well, I'll tell you one thing. I
[1:24:25] believe this and that and the other. Oh,
[1:24:26] you know friends, we've got so much
[1:24:29] going on around us everywhere in the age
[1:24:31] and hour that we're living. It's like
[1:24:32] the Bible is not enough and it's not the
[1:24:34] preaching of the message and not not
[1:24:36] enough. And I've said it years ago and I
[1:24:38] still maintain the same thing today. If
[1:24:40] the Bible doesn't say then the message
[1:24:42] don't require it, forget about it.
[1:24:47] What is it? people wanting to make a
[1:24:50] navl on the word and attach it to our
[1:24:54] system
[1:24:56] and then we will give the word strength.
[1:25:01] We will feed the word. You've got it
[1:25:03] backwards. You ain't supposed to feed
[1:25:06] the word. The word's supposed to feed
[1:25:07] you.
[1:25:15] Oh, but people have got it in their
[1:25:17] mind. Oh, the Holy Spirit, the Holy
[1:25:21] Spirit will come and anoint my great
[1:25:24] personality,
[1:25:27] my charisma.
[1:25:30] I'm so gifted and I Oh, here Lord. Here,
[1:25:33] here
[1:25:35] come take me. I'm a Plato. I'm a Caesar.
[1:25:40] You're a nut.
[1:25:47] And I'm here to crack you tonight,
[1:25:51] Mr.
[1:25:52] Hickory or Mr. Acorn or Mr. Walnut,
[1:25:57] unless you see what you really are
[1:25:59] without God.
[1:26:06] Lord
[1:26:07] God, that's why people around this
[1:26:10] message are still free will
[1:26:11] Baptist. They want to hang on. Glory to
[1:26:14] God. I went down there to that altar. I
[1:26:17] grabbed a hold to that altar and I said,
[1:26:20] "God, I'm telling you one thing, Lord.
[1:26:23] I'm not getting up from here to me and
[1:26:25] you worked this out. I grabbed a hold to
[1:26:27] that altar. I gave my will to God. I
[1:26:30] wanted to go up there. I will to do it.
[1:26:33] The Bible says we're not saved by the
[1:26:35] will of man, but we're saved by the will
[1:26:37] of God. There you go, free will Baptist.
[1:26:40] You wasn't looking for God. You didn't
[1:26:42] really want God. You may have wanted
[1:26:44] church and you may have wanted religion,
[1:26:46] but you didn't want the God of this
[1:26:47] Bible. Come on, somebody. It wasn't you
[1:26:50] wanting God. It was God wanted you.
[1:26:53] Hallelujah. That's what it was. It was
[1:26:56] God wanting you.
[1:27:05] He created the very cells in the
[1:27:07] womb of Mary for that
[1:27:10] body. It was not enough for the Holy
[1:27:13] Spirit to simply give life to human
[1:27:17] over
[1:27:19] supplied by
[1:27:22] Mary. That would have
[1:27:25] been sinful mankind.
[1:27:30] producing a
[1:27:33] body. Can't you see why we always get in
[1:27:36] trouble when we try to make the bride's
[1:27:39] revival our ideas? It's this and this
[1:27:41] and this and this and this. We are
[1:27:43] providing the human
[1:27:46] oam and then we're laying out our
[1:27:48] mechanics and we're laying everything
[1:27:49] out. All right. Now, Holy Ghost, come
[1:27:50] on. Come on. Come on. We're the only
[1:27:52] ones. No, no, now we done know. We've
[1:27:54] we've done Dr. G and talked about it.
[1:27:55] We're the only ones. I mean, ain't
[1:27:56] nobody saying what we're saying. We're
[1:27:58] the only ones preaching. That's really
[1:27:59] scary. If there's only one or two
[1:28:02] churches around this message that's got
[1:28:04] the truth, there's something wrong
[1:28:05] somewhere.
[1:28:07] I'd like to know how a lot of these
[1:28:08] people around the world that don't have
[1:28:09] the internet and how they don't know
[1:28:11] this preacher's name and that preacher's
[1:28:12] name. How in the world are they ever
[1:28:14] going to go in the rapture because they
[1:28:15] don't know nothing about Donnie Reagan.
[1:28:16] They don't know nothing about Word of
[1:28:18] Life Church. Many of them never even
[1:28:19] heard the name. Come on, somebody. Well,
[1:28:21] how in the world are they ever going to
[1:28:22] go on the rapture? I'll tell you how
[1:28:24] they're going to go. Because the same
[1:28:25] Holy Ghost that fell on you fell on
[1:28:26] them. And they may not know this
[1:28:28] preacher and that preacher from America
[1:28:30] and this one from Ohio and this one from
[1:28:31] Texas and wherever more. But the thing
[1:28:33] about it is God created that cell inside
[1:28:36] of them. And then God sent down the Holy
[1:28:39] Ghost in the very similar way the way he
[1:28:41] did Mary. Look at yourself and say, "Who
[1:28:44] am I? Am I a or am I repeat of
[1:28:50] Mary?
[1:28:56] Do we take our womb and share it with
[1:29:00] God and with
[1:29:02] preachers and with ideologies?
[1:29:07] Or do we belong to
[1:29:09] God alone?
[1:29:22] that would not have produced the last
[1:29:25] Adam or him. It was said, "Lo, a body
[1:29:30] hast thou Father prepared for me." God,
[1:29:35] not
[1:29:37] Mary, provided that body.
[1:29:44] Mary was the human incubator and she
[1:29:47] carried that holy child and brought him
[1:29:50] to
[1:29:51] birth. So you could have looked at his
[1:29:54] skin but none of it marries. Looked at
[1:29:57] his eyes well none of it hers. Now you
[1:30:00] know the splitting of the chromosomes
[1:30:01] and the man has so many the woman have
[1:30:02] so many. Not in this creation. Everyone
[1:30:05] from God. Wonder what color God's eyes
[1:30:08] were. Well if I could see the face of
[1:30:09] Jesus I could tell you. Wonder what
[1:30:12] color God's hair was. If I can see the
[1:30:13] face of Jesus, I can tell exactly what
[1:30:14] color his hair because that was the
[1:30:16] image of the invisible God. Is that
[1:30:19] right? So there was not part of it God
[1:30:21] and part of it Mary. Oh no. That would
[1:30:23] have been what Eve said. I have gotten a
[1:30:26] man from the Lord. Or as one of the
[1:30:29] interpreters of the translator said it,
[1:30:31] I have gotten a man
[1:30:33] with I have gotten a man with the Lord.
[1:30:37] Not from with.
[1:30:39] Don't you understand children? down
[1:30:41] through the church ages. That's what
[1:30:42] it's been every time that the church has
[1:30:44] said, "I've got a man with the Lord."
[1:30:48] And what do they do? They raise Cain and
[1:30:51] kill Abel. Oh, God is going to come to
[1:30:54] the same place in the message that there
[1:30:56] will rise a Cain move. And what will
[1:30:59] they do? Kill Abel.
[1:31:02] Lord, try their best to when they get to
[1:31:04] the place I think they'll be, he'll
[1:31:05] rapture us out of here by the grace of
[1:31:07] God. Why? Because the church always
[1:31:10] claims the wrong son.
[1:31:14] Oh God,
[1:31:16] I have gotten a man from the Lord. But
[1:31:18] as for this Abel, worthless.
[1:31:26] Worthless. So she names Cain, acquired,
[1:31:31] gotten, but she names the promised one
[1:31:34] worthless
[1:31:36] as the press of no value at all.
[1:31:41] Oh God, help us to recognize the right
[1:31:44] son.
[1:31:47] Help us, Jesus.
[1:31:52] Mary was a human incubator and she
[1:31:53] carried that holy child and brought him
[1:31:56] to
[1:31:58] birth. It was a God
[1:32:01] man. It was a God
[1:32:04] man. He was the son of God. He was of
[1:32:09] the new creation.
[1:32:12] man and God
[1:32:16] met and
[1:32:19] joined. He was the
[1:32:21] first of this new race.
[1:32:27] So the new
[1:32:28] race,
[1:32:30] hallelujah, was
[1:32:32] God and man
[1:32:35] in the same tabernacle.
[1:32:39] Now notice that man at least for the
[1:32:42] first phase of his life 30 years
[1:32:44] whatever it was
[1:32:45] 33 was not God in a glorified body
[1:32:50] but God in a human body.
[1:32:54] Oh you say brother Donnie I'm so waiting
[1:32:56] for that hour to come. Glory to God. One
[1:32:58] of these days it's going to come. We're
[1:32:59] going to be that new race. No actually
[1:33:03] it's already here.
[1:33:06] There are people in this place
[1:33:09] tonight that are
[1:33:11] already part of that new race. God
[1:33:16] living in human tabernacles.
[1:33:20] Now remember, oh you said, "But the Lord
[1:33:21] Jesus, he he was sinless." That's right.
[1:33:23] He was sinless by choice, but he was
[1:33:25] tempted as all points like as we are. So
[1:33:28] it was not God living in a glorified
[1:33:30] body. He could bleed. He could have a
[1:33:32] headache. He could suffer. Can't you see
[1:33:35] who are you? Can't you see Satan wants
[1:33:38] to focus on this? That's only part of
[1:33:41] the equation. The thing we need to focus
[1:33:43] on tonight and for the rest of our life
[1:33:45] is not how frail our flesh is, how
[1:33:48] faulty our flesh is, how low down it is,
[1:33:50] how people have hurt you and let you
[1:33:52] down and disappointed and sure they've
[1:33:54] done all us that way. I can spend the
[1:33:56] rest of my life packing tales and
[1:33:58] telling all kinds of story. My goodness,
[1:34:00] I could write a life story and have
[1:34:01] several volumes of all the hurt that I
[1:34:03] went through in my life. Or I can talk
[1:34:06] about how great my God is, how many
[1:34:08] great things I've seen him do. Why in
[1:34:10] the world would I want to spend my time
[1:34:13] writing a life story about some
[1:34:15] knucklehead about myself when I can
[1:34:17] spend the rest of my life talking about
[1:34:20] the great I am, the healer, the
[1:34:22] deliverer. Come on, somebody.
[1:34:25] [Applause]
[1:34:36] It was a God
[1:34:40] man. He was the
[1:34:42] son of
[1:34:45] God. He was of the new
[1:34:47] creation. Man and God
[1:34:51] met and joined.
[1:34:54] Hallelujah.
[1:34:56] met and joined and he was the
[1:35:01] first of this new
[1:35:03] race. He is the
[1:35:07] head of this new race.
[1:35:11] Anybody believe it?
[1:35:14] Well, that's
[1:35:15] good. Let me ask the second part.
[1:35:19] Anybody here part of it?
[1:35:22] That's even more awesome. Amen.
[1:35:26] So the new race is already living on the
[1:35:30] earth.
[1:35:32] Man has always looked for the dominant
[1:35:36] race.
[1:35:39] I know which one it is.
[1:35:49] It's not the whites.
[1:35:51] It's not the Hispanic. It's not the
[1:35:54] Africans. It's not the tribal Americas.
[1:35:57] It's not Papa New Guinea. You know, the
[1:35:59] th those people there right here. It's a
[1:36:03] predominant race. Which is made up of
[1:36:06] all the above and others that I didn't
[1:36:08] say.
[1:36:10] And that's why if you've got the baptism
[1:36:12] of the Holy Ghost, you could grab a
[1:36:14] black brother, a brown brother, a yellow
[1:36:17] brother, a pink brother, if there was
[1:36:18] such a thing, and put your arm around
[1:36:20] him and feel no racial contention in
[1:36:23] your life. And if you don't feel that,
[1:36:25] you ain't got the Holy Ghost because it
[1:36:28] is not by your color. Or you say,
[1:36:30] "Brother Donnie, do you think Jesus was
[1:36:32] a white man?" I don't care what color
[1:36:35] Jesus was. I'm not focusing so much on
[1:36:37] the color of his skin. I'm focusing on
[1:36:40] that he was the beginning of the new
[1:36:42] race. We've done been told there will be
[1:36:45] black and white and red and yellow.
[1:36:47] There'll be redheaded people,
[1:36:48] blondheaded people, all kinds of people
[1:36:50] in that new land. And nobody there will
[1:36:54] play the race card.
[1:37:04] But the only ones that will be
[1:37:07] there will belong to the new race.
[1:37:11] That Hitler thought that it was the
[1:37:14] Aryans.
[1:37:17] Nimrod thought it was his race.
[1:37:21] God has let the three sons of
[1:37:24] Noah in their own time frame rule and
[1:37:29] have domain over the
[1:37:32] earth. God let them do that so he could
[1:37:35] prove none of you can rule this earth.
[1:37:42] The prophet said God's idea was a
[1:37:44] righteous king.
[1:37:46] And that's what I'm waiting for, for the
[1:37:49] righteous king to come back.
[1:37:52] Oh, hallelujah. I've told you before
[1:37:54] that some of the Jews are thinking
[1:37:55] Donald Trump is a messianic rabbi and
[1:37:58] some people think he's the devil and
[1:37:59] some think this and that and the other.
[1:38:01] My hope ain't in Donald Trump. My hope
[1:38:04] certainly wasn't in Joe Biden. My hope
[1:38:06] ain't in no man. My hope tonight is in
[1:38:08] the Lord Jesus. And if he don't come,
[1:38:10] we're all in a
[1:38:12] mess. Come on, somebody say amen. But we
[1:38:16] have got the promise from the head of
[1:38:18] this new race. I will not leave you
[1:38:21] comfortless, but I will come unto you.
[1:38:24] Lo, I am with you always. I will never
[1:38:27] leave you nor forsake you. Hallelujah.
[1:38:30] I'll be with you all the way to the end
[1:38:32] of the age. That's our age. So when
[1:38:35] there is no more Donald Trump, when
[1:38:38] there is no more Democrats, no
[1:38:40] Republican, what are we talking about?
[1:38:42] saints of God that have already been
[1:38:45] partakers of the divine nature.
[1:38:56] Watch him. He goes straight to the
[1:38:57] scripture here in Colossians
[1:38:59] 1:18. He is the head of the body, the
[1:39:03] church, who is the beginning, the
[1:39:05] firstborn from the
[1:39:07] dead, that in all things he might have
[1:39:10] the preeminence. 2 Corinthians 5:17,
[1:39:12] "Therefore, if any man be in Christ,
[1:39:16] he is a new
[1:39:17] creation. Old things have passed away,
[1:39:21] and behold, at least three things,
[1:39:28] all things become new." There you can
[1:39:32] see that though man
[1:39:35] was of the old order or
[1:39:38] creation, now in union with Christ, he
[1:39:42] has become the new creation of God.
[1:39:48] But here's the catch to it. The new
[1:39:51] creation of God in the same old house.
[1:39:56] Wow.
[1:40:00] Sister
[1:40:01] Sylvia wrote a
[1:40:03] poem about me coming to the church. My
[1:40:06] goodness, years and years ago, I've
[1:40:08] still got it. Sometimes I look at that
[1:40:10] guy and I think, who is
[1:40:12] that? But I hold it up in the mirror and
[1:40:14] I look, I say, "Yeah, that was me but in
[1:40:16] a younger
[1:40:17] day." A lot of that agent has to do with
[1:40:20] you all.
[1:40:23] sags and wrinkles and all that worries
[1:40:26] and fattening and crying and
[1:40:28] praying and a lot of us just has to
[1:40:30] because I'm a human being and you just
[1:40:32] get old.
[1:40:34] But you know what? Inside of me, I'm not
[1:40:37] one day older.
[1:40:39] Not one day older. I've got just as much
[1:40:41] joy. I've got just as much
[1:40:43] determination. I've got just as much
[1:40:45] victory as I had the first moment I
[1:40:47] received the Holy Ghost. And I'll never
[1:40:49] leave it. That's why child of God when
[1:40:50] they look death in the face they can
[1:40:52] laugh at death and say you are not my
[1:40:55] master but I'm yours. Why? Because it
[1:40:58] runs in our family to laugh at death. It
[1:41:02] runs in our family to say oh God where
[1:41:06] is your power? Where is your strength
[1:41:08] over
[1:41:09] me? Hallelujah.
[1:41:12] Who are you?
[1:41:16] What's your daddy's name?
[1:41:19] Who is your
[1:41:23] mother? Who is your
[1:41:28] patronage? Was you born on a certain
[1:41:32] day? Did you
[1:41:34] start at a certain time?
[1:41:54] Hallelujah. Ephesians
[1:41:56] 2:10, for we are his
[1:42:01] workmanship, created in union with
[1:42:05] Christ
[1:42:06] Jesus unto good works. Ephesians 4:24,
[1:42:09] "And you put on the new man, which after
[1:42:11] God is created in righteousness and true
[1:42:17] holiness." This new creation is not the
[1:42:20] old creation made
[1:42:23] over. Or it could not be called a new
[1:42:26] creation. That is exactly what it says.
[1:42:29] It is new creation. It is another
[1:42:34] creation distinct from the old one. No
[1:42:37] longer is he dealing by ways of the
[1:42:41] flesh. That was how he dealt with
[1:42:43] Israel. He chose Abraham out of
[1:42:45] Abraham's issue through the godly Isaac
[1:42:47] line. But now out of every kindred,
[1:42:51] tribe, and
[1:42:54] nation, he has purposed a new
[1:42:59] creation. And he is the
[1:43:02] first of that creation.
[1:43:07] This is overwhelming to me
[1:43:10] that according to the future home that
[1:43:12] he thought of
[1:43:14] himself as being a
[1:43:18] human. That's what I've been for going
[1:43:21] on 69 years of my life. I want to be
[1:43:24] something else.
[1:43:26] But he was the eternal. He was God. But
[1:43:30] he thought of
[1:43:32] himself as being a
[1:43:34] human. And he projected that
[1:43:38] down to become
[1:43:41] Jesus. So, we all know what a projector
[1:43:43] is, right? Huh? See this black box right
[1:43:46] here? That's a projector. Another one
[1:43:49] right over here. Another one right back
[1:43:51] there. This shows me the same thing
[1:43:53] you're seeing there. Now, the screen's
[1:43:55] nice. Really nice.
[1:43:59] But this screen cannot produce any
[1:44:00] words, any image. It has no ability. We
[1:44:04] cut off the projectors, these screens
[1:44:06] will go totally blank. They have no
[1:44:09] power, no visual ability to reproduce
[1:44:13] that. So I sat under the inspiration and
[1:44:16] study and pray and ask God to help me.
[1:44:18] And then I send the brothers these
[1:44:20] quotes and scriptures and all of that.
[1:44:22] They put it loaded into the computer,
[1:44:24] however it is they go about doing all
[1:44:25] that. and they got hooked up to the
[1:44:29] projector and it projects all that right
[1:44:33] there. So God before the world
[1:44:37] began thought about himself as
[1:44:43] being I want to be a human
[1:44:50] being. That's what I want to be.
[1:44:54] What if he wants to be? He's going to
[1:45:04] be and he knew the head of the human
[1:45:08] race, the initial one, would
[1:45:11] fall. So he
[1:45:14] says, I I'll go myself.
[1:45:18] So when I start this new
[1:45:20] race, I'll make it from an
[1:45:23] infallibility of my own power.
[1:45:27] And if he had given that to Adam, Adam
[1:45:29] would have never fallen.
[1:45:32] But in order to do it, I've got to mix
[1:45:37] myself.
[1:45:39] Deity plus
[1:45:41] humanity. There never been anything
[1:45:43] quite like it. So if you mix deity,
[1:45:46] fullness of the godhead, and then you
[1:45:48] mix it with clay, corpusles, blood
[1:45:53] cells, heart, kidneys, liver, brain,
[1:45:56] tissues, marl, bones,
[1:46:00] ligaments, hair, toenails, fingernails,
[1:46:04] teeth, and then you put God inside of
[1:46:08] that. What do you
[1:46:09] get? The head of the new race.
[1:46:14] Don't you understand? You'll never be
[1:46:16] happy being like an angel.
[1:46:21] Just flying around with wings on your
[1:46:22] back in
[1:46:24] heaven. God never made you to be an
[1:46:26] angel. You understand? When brother Ram
[1:46:29] went beyond the curtain of time and he
[1:46:30] saw those people there in the sixth
[1:46:32] dimension, he said, "Do you all eat
[1:46:35] here?" They said, "No, we don't eat."
[1:46:39] "Do you drink?" "No, we don't drink."
[1:46:41] but said, "One day we'll go back to
[1:46:45] Earth and we'll take up bodies."
[1:46:50] Now, they're in that temporary place in
[1:46:52] the sixth dimension waiting to reunite
[1:46:55] again with their glorified body to enter
[1:46:59] in more fully into the new race. And as
[1:47:03] she says it in future home, it will be
[1:47:07] eternal
[1:47:09] life in a human body.
[1:47:15] That is mindboggling.
[1:47:18] Eternal life in a human
[1:47:21] body. Can you imagine? Carol, I was
[1:47:24] talking about this week.
[1:47:28] that if the Lord just changed us back to
[1:47:30] be young
[1:47:31] people, we still need more than that.
[1:47:35] You ever really think about it? How many
[1:47:38] people could you actually be around day
[1:47:41] and night, 24 hours a day for 30
[1:47:48] days? I'm going to step off the platform
[1:47:50] here while everybody is trying to decide
[1:47:56] Now think about it. How many people do
[1:47:59] you really like, love, whatever you want
[1:48:01] to say, enough to be around them
[1:48:05] 24/7 for a solid
[1:48:08] month? Some of you are thinking, "My
[1:48:10] husband, my wife, to brother include
[1:48:12] them. Even some of your young ones might
[1:48:14] be excluded. I don't know. I'm just
[1:48:18] saying. But can you imagine living
[1:48:21] through the ceaseless
[1:48:24] ages with everybody in heaven and no one
[1:48:28] will ever get a little miffed at the
[1:48:30] other one.
[1:48:33] No one will ever you'll never see
[1:48:34] nobody's face ever, you know, kind of
[1:48:36] flush red because they got aggravated.
[1:48:39] They they turned and walked away. They
[1:48:40] walked down from Righteous Avenue to to
[1:48:42] Fifth Avenue and where it turned to corn
[1:48:44] there and Praise Avenue. They said,
[1:48:45] "I'll tell you one thing. If he ever
[1:48:47] says
[1:48:48] that, then Jesus walks out. Oh, Lord
[1:48:54] Jesus. You see, it's not enough for us
[1:48:56] to be made young.
[1:48:59] But this part's got to be changed, too.
[1:49:02] Cuz we still clash, don't we? Be honest.
[1:49:05] We do. Amen. But
[1:49:09] think it will be a
[1:49:13] place 100 million
[1:49:17] years. Cannot even touch it.
[1:49:20] And after we've been there for say 150
[1:49:23] million years, if we would even count
[1:49:25] time,
[1:49:27] there's not one record of a tear falling
[1:49:30] from anybody's eye.
[1:49:33] Nobody's ever pouted and didn't show up
[1:49:35] for supper.
[1:49:39] Ain't nobody standing at home because
[1:49:40] nobody shook their hand. Cuz everybody
[1:49:42] there shaking hands. Everybody's just
[1:49:44] loving one another. Everybody's just
[1:49:46] smiling and they're worshiping and
[1:49:47] they're praising God. There's no
[1:49:49] oddities among us. Lord, I'll tell you
[1:49:52] that sounds like heaven to me.
[1:49:57] It's It's almost more than we can
[1:49:59] comprehend, right? Why? Because because
[1:50:02] of the differences, val say, "But is
[1:50:04] that who I am?" It's not who I am.
[1:50:08] Donnie Reagan and the oddities that I've
[1:50:10] got and the oddities you've got and the
[1:50:12] ones you've got and you've got, that's
[1:50:13] not who you are.
[1:50:16] If that was really who you are, that's
[1:50:19] what heaven will be like.
[1:50:23] You're captured in this prison house of
[1:50:26] time.
[1:50:28] And eternal life is doing its best to
[1:50:31] express itself beyond the cells and the
[1:50:35] walls of this
[1:50:37] prison. And every now and then we get a
[1:50:39] good dose of it and it'll the the real
[1:50:42] us will really come out sometimes to
[1:50:44] stress and anxiety and trouble and it'll
[1:50:46] really bring it out and we catch it. Oh,
[1:50:48] oh, that's it. That that's it right
[1:50:50] there. And you see it yourself. Another
[1:50:51] said, yes, yes, that's
[1:50:53] it. And then it kind of goes back again
[1:50:56] and then you still see the prison house.
[1:51:01] Oh,
[1:51:05] hallelujah. Let's stand.
[1:51:21] But now out of every kindred tribe and
[1:51:23] nation, he has purposed a new
[1:51:26] creation. He is the first of that
[1:51:29] creation. He was God created in the form
[1:51:34] of
[1:51:35] man. Now by his
[1:51:37] spirit he
[1:51:39] is creating many
[1:51:44] sons unto himself.
[1:51:48] God the creator creating
[1:51:51] himself a part of his
[1:51:55] creation. You understand what your new
[1:51:57] birth
[1:51:58] is? The new creation is him creating
[1:52:02] himself
[1:52:04] in
[1:52:08] us. Now if it's not it's not the same
[1:52:11] quality, it's not the same essence and
[1:52:12] it's not the same character.
[1:52:15] This is the reason why he's not
[1:52:19] ashamed to call us
[1:52:23] brothers. Let me read the rest of this
[1:52:25] here. Skip down a few lines there. His
[1:52:29] sovereign power. Oh, let me read the
[1:52:32] above. This is the true revelation of
[1:52:35] God. This was his purpose.
[1:52:38] This purpose took form
[1:52:43] through
[1:52:46] election. His sovereign power brought it
[1:52:48] to pass by his own
[1:52:52] decree. He elected the members of this
[1:52:56] new
[1:52:57] creation. He predestinated them to the
[1:53:01] adoption of children to the good
[1:53:04] pleasure of his will. By his
[1:53:07] omniscience and
[1:53:09] omnipotence, he brought
[1:53:12] it to pass.
[1:53:15] And the church said,
[1:53:19] "And
[1:53:20] Jesus is the firstborn." Romans 8:29.
[1:53:26] For whom he did
[1:53:28] forno, he also did
[1:53:31] predestinate to be
[1:53:33] conformed to the image of his
[1:53:37] son that he might be the
[1:53:41] firstborn among many
[1:53:44] brethren. We realize we're living in a
[1:53:46] day when it's on so many people's minds
[1:53:49] and we hear it talked about on the news
[1:53:51] almost daily. the trans move. Trans this
[1:53:56] and trans that and trans that and trans
[1:54:01] that. I was thinking about the other day
[1:54:03] and I thought I'm so glad that I'm a
[1:54:06] part of the real trans move.
[1:54:10] Transformed. Amen. Translated.
[1:54:14] Transferred.
[1:54:16] Well, come on now.
[1:54:18] [Laughter]
[1:54:20] hath translated us into the kingdom of
[1:54:23] his dear son. There's the real transm
[1:54:28] through the power of
[1:54:34] transformation. Hebrews 2:10, and we'll
[1:54:36] pick it up again, Lord willing, the next
[1:54:39] Wednesday when I get back from
[1:54:40] Switzerland.
[1:54:42] For it became him, for whom are all
[1:54:44] things, and by whom are all things, and
[1:54:48] bringing many
[1:54:50] sons unto glory, to make the captain of
[1:54:55] their
[1:54:56] salvation perfect through
[1:54:58] sufferings. For both he that sanctifith,
[1:55:01] and they who are
[1:55:03] sanctified are all of one.
[1:55:09] For which cause he is not
[1:55:13] ashamed to call
[1:55:15] them brethren. Hallelujah.
[1:55:19] He's not ashamed to call them brethren.
[1:55:24] Aren't you glad?
[1:55:26] Let me just share this with you.
[1:55:28] Leviticus 25:47. And if a sojourer or a
[1:55:31] stranger wax rich by thee, and thy
[1:55:34] brother that have dwelt by him wax poor,
[1:55:37] and sell himself to the stranger or
[1:55:40] sojourer by thee, or to the stock of the
[1:55:44] stranger's
[1:55:45] family, after that he is
[1:55:48] sold, he may be redeemed
[1:55:51] again. One of his
[1:55:54] brethren may redeem him. Thank you,
[1:55:57] Lord.
[1:56:00] Can't you see why he had to become one
[1:56:03] of us?
[1:56:06] God and spirit. How could that be kin to
[1:56:09] us fallen
[1:56:11] people? So he had to become our brother.
[1:56:16] Praise be to
[1:56:19] God. Or when Matthew 25, when shall we
[1:56:23] thee sick or in prison or came unto
[1:56:25] thee?
[1:56:26] And the
[1:56:27] king, the
[1:56:29] king shall answer and say to unto them,
[1:56:32] verily I say unto you, in as much as you
[1:56:36] have done
[1:56:37] it to one of the least of
[1:56:39] these, my
[1:56:42] brethren, ye have done it unto
[1:56:46] me. What's he
[1:56:49] introducing? The new race.
[1:56:53] A lot of kings down through time have
[1:56:55] been known for great
[1:56:57] things. Some for the power of their
[1:57:01] army. Some for lenience to the nations
[1:57:04] they would
[1:57:06] conquer. Some for their
[1:57:09] verocity. Some for their
[1:57:12] wickedness. But our
[1:57:15] king is known by love.
[1:57:18] Our king is known that one day in his
[1:57:22] great throne room in
[1:57:25] heaven. And he said to those great
[1:57:27] cherubams and seraphims and
[1:57:30] zuns, "This is the last time you'll see
[1:57:32] me for a while this way. Oh great king,
[1:57:36] where will you
[1:57:37] go? I'm going down among my people. I
[1:57:41] want to chop wood with the wood chopper.
[1:57:44] I want to live the life of a
[1:57:46] peasant so I can understand my people
[1:57:50] better. Oh, great king, don't leave.
[1:57:52] Don't leave. Oh, I'll be
[1:57:55] back. So, he changes his garments and
[1:57:58] puts on the clothes of a wood chopper, a
[1:58:01] peasant, whatever
[1:58:04] more. Our great king laid aside his
[1:58:07] diadem, the praise of myriads of angels
[1:58:11] in the
[1:58:12] heavenlies. And he come to the earth and
[1:58:14] he heard words like this. Say we not
[1:58:17] well. Thou art the
[1:58:19] Samaritan and hast a devil.
[1:58:25] Instead of praise, blasphemy, false
[1:58:30] accusations, but he was a man on a
[1:58:33] mission.
[1:58:34] What's he coming to do? Redeem his
[1:58:37] brothers.
[1:58:41] Don't you love him with all your heart?
[1:58:43] Amen.
[1:58:47] Heavenly Father, as
[1:58:49] we bow our heads, Lord
[1:58:53] God, and we know if time will go long
[1:58:56] enough
[1:58:58] that people that are standing here
[1:59:00] tonight, young and old
[1:59:03] alike, we'll have to go by the way of
[1:59:05] the grave and our body will go back to
[1:59:08] the dust of the earth.
[1:59:10] But the deposit has already been made in
[1:59:12] our soul and we've none done been
[1:59:16] changed. Hallelujah. And our old name
[1:59:20] has been transferred. He told us in
[1:59:23] invisible union. So we've been
[1:59:26] transformed and translated and our name
[1:59:30] has been
[1:59:32] transferred. Hallelujah.
[1:59:36] And one morning you'll call and we'll
[1:59:41] answer. Who are
[1:59:44] we? No wonder the prophet
[1:59:47] said, "I am not the son of Charles and
[1:59:50] Ella
[1:59:51] Brandham, but I'm a son of
[1:59:55] God." As I looked at the picture of my
[1:59:58] mom and daddy as I've got two pictures
[2:00:00] of them down in the basement. I looked
[2:00:02] at them today before I got ready to come
[2:00:06] up. I see things about mama that I can
[2:00:09] see in myself. Things about mama I see
[2:00:11] in Harry and my siblings. And things
[2:00:13] about daddy I
[2:00:16] see. And Lord, I I thank
[2:00:19] you for them. I I loved them. I still
[2:00:23] do. But Lord Jesus, they could only hand
[2:00:26] down to me the natural
[2:00:28] traits. And I'm part of their race.
[2:00:32] But thank you. Thank you that you come
[2:00:35] to give me more than my earthly daddy
[2:00:38] could give me.
[2:00:40] Oh, we worship you tonight,
[2:00:43] Father. I am the son of Don and Betty
[2:00:47] Reagan, but I'm more than
[2:00:50] that. Their DNA, the splitting of their
[2:00:54] chromosomes, handed things down to me I
[2:00:56] wish I hadn't got. I handed things down
[2:00:59] to my girls I wish they hadn't got.
[2:01:03] Oh, but Jesus, there's nothing you've
[2:01:05] given me that I regret
[2:01:08] getting. We worship you tonight,
[2:01:12] Father. We adore
[2:01:15] you. We magnify your name,
[2:01:19] Lord. Thank you for loving us so
[2:01:23] much. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:01:29] down
[2:01:30] from his
[2:01:34] [Music]
[2:01:37] glory. Ever
[2:01:39] living story.
[2:01:46] My
[2:01:47] God and
[2:01:50] Savior
[2:01:52] King and
[2:01:56] Jesus was his name.
[2:02:01] Born
[2:02:02] in a
[2:02:08] manger to his own a
[2:02:15] strange a man of
[2:02:20] sorrows,
[2:02:21] tears
[2:02:25] [Music]
[2:02:27] and everybody now.
[2:02:31] Oh,
[2:02:33] how the bride loves
[2:02:37] you. How
[2:02:40] I
[2:02:42] adore
[2:02:45] him. My
[2:02:47] breath. You're my sunshine.
[2:02:54] My
[2:02:55] all in
[2:03:00] all the
[2:03:03] great
[2:03:07] creator. Thank you Lord
[2:03:10] God became my savior.
[2:03:16] [Music]
[2:03:38] Oh, how
[2:03:41] I
[2:03:43] adore
[2:03:46] you, my
[2:03:48] breath, my
[2:03:51] [Applause]
[2:03:53] Sunshine my
[2:03:56] all in
[2:03:59] [Music]
[2:04:01] all the
[2:04:03] great creator.
[2:04:05] [Applause]
[2:04:09] He
[2:04:11] became my
[2:04:16] savior and all God's
[2:04:23] fullness
[2:04:26] dwell in him.
[2:04:29] [Music]
[2:04:33] Come
[2:04:38] decision bringing
[2:04:41] us redemption.
[2:04:45] [Music]
[2:04:48] In the
[2:04:50] dead of
[2:04:53] night, not one faint hope inside.
[2:05:02] God
[2:05:04] precious
[2:05:08] tender laid
[2:05:11] aside his
[2:05:14] [Music]
[2:05:16] splender
[2:05:20] [Music]
[2:05:26] sto my my soul.
[2:05:33] Oh, I
[2:05:35] love
[2:05:38] you.
[2:05:41] I
[2:05:43] adore you for your worship.
[2:05:47] I dress
[2:05:51] my shine. My Lord Jesus
[2:06:01] I the
[2:06:08] great. He
[2:06:10] became my
[2:06:16] savior and
[2:06:18] all God's
[2:06:23] fullness
[2:06:26] dwell in
[2:06:31] him. Oh,
[2:06:33] how I
[2:06:35] love you.
[2:06:39] How
[2:06:41] I
[2:06:43] adore
[2:06:46] him. You're my breath. You're my
[2:06:53] sunshine. Lord, you're my
[2:06:57] [Music]
[2:07:01] all the
[2:07:03] great creator.
[2:07:10] You
[2:07:11] became our
[2:07:15] savior and all
[2:07:26] God. Let's look at this verse again.
[2:07:28] What condescension?
[2:07:30] [Music]
[2:07:32] What
[2:07:34] [Music]
[2:07:38] kind bringing
[2:07:41] us
[2:07:44] [Music]
[2:07:46] redemption while
[2:07:49] in the dead of
[2:07:52] night and most of us are like this?
[2:07:55] brought one faint
[2:07:58] home
[2:08:01] inside. God
[2:08:04] gracious
[2:08:09] tender laid
[2:08:11] aside his splend.
[2:08:14] [Music]
[2:08:19] do
[2:08:21] to
[2:08:23] win to
[2:08:25] change
[2:08:27] my
[2:08:29] soul. Everybody
[2:08:31] now.
[2:08:34] Oh, how I
[2:08:36] love
[2:08:39] him.
[2:08:42] How do you understand? You could never
[2:08:45] love the devil the way you love him
[2:08:47] tonight. He just wasn't in
[2:08:49] you. My
[2:08:51] son
[2:08:54] shall my
[2:08:57] all and
[2:09:02] all the
[2:09:05] great creator.
[2:09:09] [Music]
[2:09:18] and
[2:09:20] all your
[2:09:25] soullessness
[2:09:27] will
[2:09:31] [Music]
[2:09:32] be. Oh,
[2:09:35] how I love you.
[2:09:44] [Music]
[2:09:47] Oh, my
[2:09:50] breath, my
[2:09:56] My
[2:09:59] [Music]
[2:10:05] own creator.
[2:10:11] He
[2:10:12] became my
[2:10:17] savior and all God's
[2:10:25] fullness
[2:10:27] will
[2:10:34] be in the town in
[2:10:39] Bethlehem. God came down to visit
