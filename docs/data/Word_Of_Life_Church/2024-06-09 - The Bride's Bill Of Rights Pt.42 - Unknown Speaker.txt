in from the fear of sin bring them in congratulations bring them in bring the little on to Jesus thank you Lord it's more than my mind can comprehend how any mother or any father would want to kill such a thing amen shows the darkness that has moved Upon Our World does it know it makes me so honor and appreciate parents that desire to face this awesome responsibility it's not all the goo and the laughs and all that but it's also the heartache the disappointments up late at night sickness trouble aren't you glad God has parents like that you ought to be you wouldn't be alive today if it wasn't let's pray together dear Jesus thank you for life life itself is the greatest gift that we could be given as Mortals then we move into eternal life I'm grateful for my brother and sister who desire Lord to be able to bring up their children in the way that's pleasing to you we know it's not always easy there's no way for them to know the heartaches that may lay before them with their little son there's no way for them to know the diseases or sickness or the darkness of the age that they may face but the way they look at it it's worth it for we know that if we can train them up in the right way then they will not depart from it this is the shortest time that we'll ever have them we're looking Beyond the Veil father when we'll be able to gather with our children again my brother and sister bring their little son to you today to dedicate his life to you father help my sister that it can be the Fifth Gospel the Declaration of Jesus May the angels of God feel so comfortable in their home May the presence of the spirit of God be near him Lord if time would tear that he'd be old enough to reach the age of accountability and to be able to know right from wrong may he be able to give his little heart to you when he's young before the evil days come upon him keep him from the sickness disease his evils of the day I dedicate his life to you Lord Jesus for a life of service for it's in your precious Holy Name that we ask it amen yep he'll fit really good look at that sleeping wow can we stand together praise the Lord let's turn to Romans chapter 7 if you would today I'm sure brother Lou already mentioned it but the um Vacation Bible School will start tomorrow actually I want to say how much I appreciate all the work and all the effort that's been um gone into it for our children um also ask brother Michael if he would reach out to the other churches in our area professing to follow the message and U invite them their children if they wish to come I don't think the lord gave us this place just for us you know and some of the other churches around or smaller churches and they don't really have some of them don't have that many young people so they maybe they couldn't do something like like this but I wanted to open up for them as well and um if they can come so if you see some kids maybe you don't know and you know I believe that if we could get them to Jesus and say something that would help their hearts I read the other day where that the houti which is a a rebel group in Yemen they are having summer camps this summer they have over a million of these kids that are attending these camps and the main theme of their entire Camp is hating Jews learning how to kill them learning how to torment them learning how to torture them rape them you imagine little bitty children I saw pictures of little bitty old boys standing there with fake guns and their arms and the hamos things and all that around their heads Satan knows exactly what he's doing to try to influence you remember Hitler years and years ago had a group called Hitler Youth and they was taking them when they were young teenagers and instill this hatred well if they can do that how much more should we do it with the truth of the Gospel amen so remember that this week that the Lord will just be with them they'll be having fun of course and they're going to have um different things that they're going to teach them so just pray the presence of God will be able to be here for every night that that's going on you know what it might be a little child I just read it to you the other day where the Prophet said there's a little boy a little girl in here that was born over in Seattle Washington they're not old enough to receive it yet but the church will plug play along slug along have meetings and so forth until that child is old enough so what if this week a child will come to the age of accountability and that last one might not be a 40 year old man or a 50 year old man maybe it's a nine or 10 year old little boy or little girl and the presence of God will deal with their hearts wouldn't that be awesome it would be awesome [Music] sorry I personally don't want to say anybody lost you I don't want to say nobody go to hell let's do everything we can to reach those that are redeemable Romans chapter 7 verse one I want to speak to you again today on the right to be married to God know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hasth dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from the law from that law so that she is no adulterous though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another married to another even to him what an honor who is raised raed from the dead that we should bring forth fruit so now we're talking about a marriage and then Paul says so that once we are married to him we should not be fruitless or Barren but that we should bring forth fruit unto God may the Lord bless his word you may be seated let me read the quote that I've been sharing with you for a couple of weeks from invisible Union Paul here is giving an illustration in her scripture about the law and Grace and illustrating it like marriage and divorce this passage is very seldom preached on because it more or less pertains to like marriage and divorce but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce of how that he's trying to set in order that we as a church now I believe also it is to my belief it unfolds one of the great mysteries of Prophecy so one of the great Mysteries of the last day is the greater portion of marriage and divorce so it's not just about men and women getting married and and all of that but it is also about Christ being able to achieve a bride that would move Beyond just religion move Beyond organized systems of man led by man called by man put together by man orchestrated by man and it would be a body that he himself would step inside that body now individually we are baptized collectively into the body of Christ so we don't all get the Holy Ghost at one time we don't all grow at the same rate we don't all even in feed at the same time and sometimes on the same amount same amount of food but we are individually baptized collectively into the body of God this like every other special event down through time it requires a special manifestation of God now we know that there's been different times down to the ages by which God would do great Supernatural things and it would be like a changing of a dispensation when everything runs normal as we'd say and it may go that way for a long time 50 years 100 years 200 years and then all of a sudden God will appear on the scene in an abnormal unusual way sometimes he sends an Angel sometimes it would be a theophonic appearance of Christ himself before the Incarnate body of Flesh was brought on the earth other times it would be a supernatural manifestation of the father appearing in the form of lights or fire or a visible manifestation of God and whenever we look then at the last days if this is what we believe it is one of the great mysteries of Prophecy it would lead us to believe that this will also require a special manifestation of God to reveal himself in a way that would be quite unusual from the way that he's done before so we could go back in the time of manoah and his wife and God is fixing to send a deliver by the name of Samson and we can see that an angel of the Lord comes and wondrously performs a very unusual appearance there before mon Noah and his wife we could also go back to Moses of course in the burning bush we could go to Gideon we could go to different various times when the Lord appeared in such a way and sometimes depending upon the seriousness of the cause God would choose whichever administrative spirit that would be able to most definitely meet the need of that age now remember when God sends an angel it's for a specific need so God would send Gabriel from time to time and then God sent wormwood at the anti deluvian destruction God sends different ones because when we see that Angelic presence it's not just here in a body form but it's releasing something so when Daniel was there and he was praying and seeking God and God sent an angel down we remember reading the scripture and that angel was detained by a war then the the angel of God was able to break loose and another one came and he was able to come and give Daniel this great message of what he needed but it wasn't just an understanding of scripture alone but it was the releasing of an anointing something that would help them to be able to take the message that God gave and be able to live it now you see whenever God reveals a greater portion of his word it's not just like God shines the light on a certain portion of the scripture and then people look at oh oh okay yeah wow wow I see that my that's that's wonderful but there must be a release in the Supernatural to be able to anoint the people to live what they have seen if not they'll try to take the same kind of life and the same kind of experience and all that produces is a carnal impersonation but God releases with that a special anointing there has to be because God knows exactly how we are now we're talking about then a marriage in the last days by which the bride of Christ will come through all of these systems now in the early church they did not need this special type of anointing because it was the age of the personal life of Christ revealed in the first church age so God revealed the anointing in that age and it was the personal life of Christ and it anointed them to be able to preach the gospel live their lives not only that but give their lives in this then we move from that to another church age then a seal was open trumpet sounded seal tore off it released a mystery but also released the life or the anointing to help the people in that day how could the people be able to stand by and watch their children be taken from them how could husbands watch their wives be killed how could mothers and father s watch their children be beheaded and all that they did how could they do that with just the scripture No the scripture plus a special anointing that would release and anoint them to help them to be able to do it cuz remember they were not superhumans they were humans just like us how is God ever going to help them to do it he must release an anointing that would anoint them individuals to receive the message of that day and help them to live it I believe we need the same thing don't you so then we look at the culmination of seven Church ages and we've got thousands of denominations when the prophet was here there was 900 and something but now there's multiplied thousands of them all types of different religions around the world and of course every one of them say they are the way they have a special Enlightenment they have a special understanding so they claim if not why not just have one major Church in every city and everybody go to that church and everybody just believe the same thing but every church with whatever name that's tacked onto it is an identification of someone who feels like they have a special something different than every other church that you pass to come here this morning is that right if not why not just shut this one down and shut down every other one and will All Join one great big gigantic mega church because if we all believe the same thing all go to the same place and we're all carrying out the same Divine Purpose of God what's the use in having a whole bunch of different ones let's just all be the same thing but of course we know we are not the same now because the devil wants to project that doesn't mean that we believe it because we know God is always a separationist that God separates his people not from other people so much but from sin and unbelief now that's the way we believe the gospel so in this day through all the theology all the hierarchy of religion all the nonsense that God knew would be in the last days there will have to be not only certain scriptures that would prophetically apply to this hour such as Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 1-7 revelation 3:14 uh Zechariah 14 different scriptures that would pertain to the last day but there must also be an anointing that would come on the earth to help those people who live in this hour to help call them out from all the rest of these systems now remember there'll be more in this last age than has ever been before of all the different religions and systems of the world but it won't just be an anointing that will make them shout and rejoice and be happy and all that because a lot of religions of the world do that and we certainly are not the only one that even has Miracles and signs and wonders there's many religions that do that so it can't be that alone and yet we do believe in that it cannot just be that our music is nice and our singers are nice and we've got a nice place to come because there's people that have a whole lot better music than we do a whole lot nicer place than we do so what is it going to be that is going to make the people of this day called what we believe to be the bride that is going to make them different than all the rest of the religions and the churches well it must be a supernatural manifestation will it be a profit only will it be just special ministry will it be special meal that God has given a great insight and somehow they will understand more than other men will it be a a special type of ability that maybe they will have above others nope none of the above now God will use men of course and God will anoint men but God is not going to allow this to be carried out by men only you see in this end time it must have been a special need for a special anointing and it cannot be just the anointing on an ordinary human being it cannot be the anointing just upon ordinary people that are struggling and trying to move along trying to do the best they can and try to hold out to the end no there must be something really Supernatural now what it is it's the divine manifestation of the revealing of the son of man himself which is more than just a Revival it is more than just a group of people getting together with a bunch of Creeds and Theology and ideas and deciding to form a a special group or a special church but it must be something that the Lord God will declare himself and we know that there's been a handful of these events down through time whenever God himself would actually slip down on the earth and would intervene himself we know of course it had happened in the time of Abraham when God was going to destroy Sodom and before he destroys Sodom he appears to his prophet Abraham is that right so it was what was this manifestation it was a Supernatural manifestation of the Eternal himself but what he did he simply took the elements of the Earth the 16 elements and he blew into them and Ste into a body that could eat a calf sandwich and drink milk and be able to have his feet washed he also blew two more bodies and two angels of God one stepped into one and one stepped into the other now this was a great change Abraham had had all types of events in his life but now something great must be fixing to happen and this appearing theophonic appearing of God not in a form of a fire not in a form of a bush but a theophany in a man the opony in human flesh now notice what did this forun it forun Abraham and Sarah's bodies being changed now God never done this of course whenever he calls him out of of Mesopotamia God does not do this even when he backslides and goes down to the land of Egypt God does not do it at other times but this was a special time that required a special anointing and God didn't just send them two angels oh my angels are profound it's amazing what angels can do but there's certain things that God Saves for himself you hearing me this morning now in this it was the the visible manifestation of the son of man now the son of man is a special entity of God it's different from the burning bush it's different of course than just a pillar of Fire Light smoke different manifestations by which the presence of God has been revealed but it is him revealing himself in a prophet form Prophet form now listen every time the manifestation of the son of man would appear on the earth it's always attached to a prophetic message that something needs to be revealed in the New Testament we would know it in the term as the Messianic sign now listen the Messianic sign the Messianic sign and the ministry of the son of man are not one of the nine spiritual gifts in the book of Corinthians now listen carefully let me say it again the Messianic sign is not one of the nine spiritual gifts in the book of Corinthians Faith Miracles healings word of knowledge word of wisdom so on and so on it is a special manifestation of God that's quite unlike anything else it will be so unique that God himself will be the only one that can perform it amen now he can create himself a body or if he chooses he can able to step inside of another human's body which was actually brought forth by natural births doesn't make any difference to him just a special manifestation but the thing is it's the revealing of the son of man in a body of Flesh now God himself called Ezekiel son of man and it was absolutely essential that he himself coming in the New Testament must call himself the son of man who do men say I the son of man not Son of God but who do men say I the son of man am so in the last days this will require a special manifestation again of the son of man why because of all the religions and all the demons that's going to be released Out of Hell will produce such a power of deception without the people of God having a special anointing to pull them it would be so close it would deceive the very elected if possible now say the first church age under the administration of the first church Angel Paul did not need the personal presence of the son of man to to be able to influence that church age as bad as the second Church age third fourth fifth sixth on down as bad as it was they did not need the son of man to come down and call out the bride but the seventh Church age would be so horrible and the Darkness would be so severe and Satan would be going about to deceive even the very elected if it were possible God himself had to come down in the form of the son of man and not only give scriptures but to release a special anointing on the bride in the last days that would help her beyond what any of the other ages needed to be helped by now do you understand by this very manifestation it shows us how dark that it really is but it ought to make us rejoice as well now let me read this to you and proving his word Jesus said I said was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being reveal not no more as a church see not no more uh the bride is called in the day when the son of man will be revealed what why is the son of man being revealed to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride now this could have been done under the administration of Paul in the first church age because Paul tells us that he had presented them as a Chase virgin to Christ so the son of man the manifestation of the son of man was not needed in the Ephesian age now you look around you didn't see any churches back there in the first church age called Baptist Methodist Church of God unarian Church of Christ Presbyterian Catholic honor and on and on and on there were no such a thing so the deception of Christianity had only started in its infant stage so they did not need this type of manifestation Everybody follow me this morning to be able to see because the the Perpetual darkness that Satan was going to produce in such a way it had not yet been founded the Devil Himself was just learning how to do this in the first church age same with the second third fourth and sixth but in the seventh it's going to be so horrible it's going to be so bad that the prophet talking about gifts from God and he said that Satan can impersonate everyone of those gifts from the Lord amen and it would be so close in the last days it would deceive the very elect if possible I personally believe that's also a prophetic utterance that was never applied in such strength as it is in this hour now what he said what's what's this son of man for to join the church to the Hedge and not the marriage of the Bride now notice what will happen the bridegroom call will come right through this the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down Lord God and come in human flesh to unite the two together so the bridegroom call will come through the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man I realize that many theologians for years taking Matthew 24 also Luke 17 and other scriptures that pertain to the last day and they tried to take and put it all together as it was in referring to the coming of the Lord Jesus and the Lord tells us remember Lot's wife remember Lot's wife isn't it amazing that Jesus there when he says Luke 17:28 and remember Lot's wife then he goes on to tell us as it was in the days of Sodom thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is being revealed not comes not corporal coming different word altoe when the son of man now remember friends this is not a bunch of nonsense I'm making up in my mind I'm telling you the words of the Lord Jesus Jesus was the one that said the son of man would be revealed in the last day but yet in the bride coming or the Rapture coming of Christ the world will never even see him because where he hangs there suspended in the the heavens and we rise from our home he lives his home and there we meet in the middle but when the son of man is going to be revealed isn't it amazing that he gives us the warning of Lot's Li wife before he tells us of the manifestation of the son of man remember Lot's wife I found it astounding he never did tell us remember Sarah remember Rebecca remember Rachel remember Solomon's mother remember remember but he tells us remember Lot's wife and then he tells us why we should remember her and then he gives us the revealing of the son of man so it was prior to Lot's wife destruction right over the hill where the son of man had made himself known to Abraham now lot did not see the son of man but Abraham did he come down and talked to him in the form of a human being and what did he do he gave him a promise by this time next year Sarah will have a son what is it prop prophesying prophetic word Discerning Sarah's heart in the tent now remember Sarah was in the tent he did not see her he did not not hear her physically but he said why did Sarah life Sarah said how did life he said yes you did life you imagine calling God a liar to his face but you do know why God couldn't kill her don't you her husband had a covenant was God sir a't it amazing Lot's wife could be turned to a pill of salt she never called God a liar she never withstood God to his face she simply turned back to hear the the cries of her grandchildren in Sodom as they were burning up in the flames and God turned her to a pillar of salt why her husband had no Covenant with God so after the manifestation of the son of man then Lord 's wife which had hung around the message for a long time remember lot and his wife we don't even know what her name is so apparently must not be significant but lot and his wife and their children their daughters had walked with the prophet's message they had stayed with the prophet's message for several years until light looked down toward the well-watered plains and it reminded him of Egypt you see Abraham had backslid years before this and lot went with him and where did they go they went to the land of Egypt and Egypt made an imprint so much on lot that he never got over it so as he looked toward the well-watered plains that was laying there toward solom and gamar and the five cities that were there and he sees and it reminds him of what he saw in the land of EG Egypt he does not consult the prophet he does not go and say Abraham my uncle you know I'm thinking about going here and you know doing this and that and the other what do you think lead me help me to know exactly what to do he doesn't apparently considered essential for him so he makes up his mind and they go down there into the land of Sodom and God never went to Sodom but God sent two angels to Sodom Sodom never received the manifestation of the son of man but it was Abraham and under the opes of this administration of the son of man now watch what the son of man Ministry does it's always prophetic and with it is a supernatural discernment You Follow Me Now what so the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman I don't know do you see what I mean see it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us amen now you see take the words of the Lord Jesus in Luke 17 thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed apocalypsis which means take the cover off oh only the elect will be able to look at what God has done in this hour some will look at the veil and make God out of the veil others will look beyond the Veil and know that it's the son of man hiding in humanity well I hope somebody's sharing me this morning and don't just get St stuck on the messenger that God used to initiate the bridegroom call but God wants you and I to realize it's also still ongoing in the sense of us carrying the exact same message of the bridegroom the remember the call is not the Malachi for call it is not the prophet called we're not called to marry the prophet of the age we're not called to marry a pastor come on somebody we're not called to marry some clergyman or some preacher we're called to marry Jesus Christ the son of man Oh my he will come down in human flesh Among Us and make his word notice what he's going to do he he's going to make his words so real he's going to make his word so real that it will unite the church and him as one so he's going to make his word so real in our services in our move and our hearts and our home he is going to make his word so real that it will produce a supernatural uniting time and Son now notice what he's going to do it isn't just going to anoint us to heal the sick it isn't just going to anoint us to have signs and wonders and it will do that but it is going to anoint us on the greatest phase of the bride's Revival and that is it will bring us and him together by making the words so real that within itself produces the uniting time and sign it ain't no wonder to me the devil hates this message it ain't no wonder to me that he wants preachers to stop preaching it and just say well you know now everybody's streaming their services and and we're on YouTube and we're here and there so we can't we can't no longer preach this stuff and I get to a place that I can no longer preach this stuff it's time for me to go off YouTube it's time for me to go off Instagram and all the come on somebody brother it ain't a time to hus preaching it it's a time to Herald it from the rooftop and let people know we're under the administration of the son of man himself Christ Jesus but Brother Don the prophet is gone I agree with that he is gone but Christ Jesus is still here Among Us and he's not just at Word of Life he is around the world getting a bride ready filling her with a baptism of the Holy Ghost and wanting to CP to her and make love to her and doing so if he can get her to harmonize with him and she will see his word under his own personal presence his own personal presence of the anointing of the son of man it will make her one with him and there ain't enough devils in hell that will ever pull her away from that one [Applause] so Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride then she'll go home to the wedding supper amen she's already united we go to the wedding supper not the [Music] marriage amen there's people sitting in this building today that are already married to almighty God hallelujah already righty married to almighty God then he quotes part of the scripture there in Revelation fill your flesh of the Mighty Men cuz the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding Supper The Rapture is not us getting married don't you understand the son of man his presence is here it's not just a repeat of Pentecost it's not a repeat of 1906 they did not get the promise of the son of man on Aza street but we did I said we did but after the restoration of the gifts come with a Pentecostal message the Lord Jesus knew it would be so close and so deceiving he couldn't send just a church Angel he couldn't send just a man with a message but he said I've got to go down myself I've got to go Oh Glory I've got to go down myself and take human instrumentality don't let that stumble you if the Lord God could pick up dust out of the earth and step into that dust why would you struggle with God been able to use a human being's body it shows you the power of the blood but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they to become one glory and then when what does it then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man you understand when you and I become one with this word we're still acting out the Fulfillment of the son of man himself because we heard the word and it was so real to us when we heard it we United with him and a bond was made for eternity Oh Glory the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing well Glory so what was this manifestation then of the son of man it was called many different things it was the life son it was the Messianic son it was in one sense the coming of the Lord no one knew that was the minute or the hour that Christ would come as he revealed it to us but you see people were looking for a visible manifestation I'm not saying there wasn't a manifestation there was yeah and it was actually visible amen yes it was look like a head look like a head well praise the Lord look like a head out there in the west oh Hallelujah to God formed the W the Angels formed the wig over the revealed son of man and if you notice whenever the prophet and the voice told him turn it to the right turn it to the right I think I had it to the right turn it to the right and when he did he said there he was Christ in all his glory so the head was there oh my goodness the head appeared there and the angels formed that wig he was glory to God what was he doing look at the way the head was positioned so the head was not looking back up toward Heaven the head was not looking this way or that way but the head was looking down to the Earth what's he looking for it's the son of man Glory the son of man come looking for his bride where are you honey where are you sweetheart where are you he found some of us in the Church of God he found some of us in a barroom he found some of us in a honky Tong but brother there won't be one of them that will be lost because the head come down looking for the [Applause] body proving his word in Los Angeles remember Abraham and his group never received one more sign from God until the promised son arrived how many knows that's true and the congregation said amen yes that sign of discernment and the Royal Seed of Abraham let me tell you thus sayith the Lord you're receiving your last son thank you neither we believe this or we don't this is why I'm not looking for some super preacher I'm not looking for some mega church well don't get quiet on me now according to the words of a Vindicated Prophet we have already received our last son now will we look at Israel of course is that a sign yes but notice that's World signs that's World signs Israel what's going on out here our sign is not Israel so much our sign is not the mark of the beast and the economy of this and that and the other our sign is our husband our sign is our husband that come down with an anointing to anoint us to live this message look friend it's not us trying to live right it's not us trying to make oursel do it it is the anointing of the Lord Jesus himself when he come he release an anointing on this Earth and there ain't enough powers in hell to stop the bride of Christ from manifesting what God ordained her to do thus sayith the Lord you're receiving your last sign that's according to the scriptures and the revelation of God that's in my heart that speaks this is the truth wow again he says look Look what Jesus said oh it just Thrills my soul as it was in the days of Noah so will it be at the coming of the son of man what did the angel do he had the spirit of discernment and he said as it was then so will it be when the son of man is being revealed from heaven now remember this is not one of the nine gifts of the Spirit Discerning of spirits according to Paul was one of the nine spiritual gifts that ain't what I'm talking about I'm talking about the son of man the word in human beings think of it in our midst now stands that same angel of God which is none other but the Lord Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Holy Ghost it's in our midst he was God and that was his message just before the destruction came can't you see we need more than just shouting we need more than a return to isusa Street Pentecost look what that produced for them it didn't produce a Rapture for them how in the world can it produce one for us do we believe in restoration of gifts if we believe the word we do but I am not going to Major on a minor and God's Prophet said gifts have to be watched because they're not perfect come on somebody don't get quiet on me I'm not going to try to produce to you some super church somewhere or some super preacher somewhere this is a body move it's going on around the world there are people in India and Africa all over the world that are being united to Christ the word that never heard the name Word of Life Church they never heard the name of some of these preachers around the message but they have heard the bridegroom call which come through what the anointing of the last day to bring us a message not just to come out that's all we preach for years and year come out the denomination come out come out well don't just lead me out lead me in I don't want to be led into another man way group take me under the wings of the son of man himself be not afraid it is ey remember thus saith the Holy Spirit write it in your Bible if something else Rises besides this and greater than this call me a false prophet cat got y'all's tongue Amen brother T I'll tell you one thing boy I've been scanning the TV and a man I've been looking over here and boy this preacher's got this gift and that got that gift I don't doubt it at all but remember the devil can impersonate every one of them right oh but Brother D I want somebody to tell me my name I've know my name since I was knee high to a grasshopper why do I need somebody else to tell me what my name is oh I want somebody to tell me what I ate for breakfast why I don't know what I ate for breakfast somebody tell me how to get one with God so come on some preachers get in the word get in the word Brothers get in the word tell me what to do tell me how to live tell me how to to be able to live a Godly life that rapturing Faith Can ooze out of my soul Hallelujah that I can love the unlovable I can reach those that seem like they're [Applause] unreachable write it in your Bible if something Rises besides this and greater than this call me a false prophet that's quite a statement I watch what I say I'm in better listen to this in contact with better than 10 million people around the world so I have to say that and I know I didn't say that myself uh-oh I said uhoh so there's somebody else here doing the talking somebody else here doing the walking well Glory to God we didn't just need a man that could stand up and speak in tongues and somebody interpret it according to the teaching of God's Prophet that's not even to be received by the church until three people with the Discerning of spirits on them has the ability to say that was the Lord that was the Lord come on children there ain't nobody stands before the son of man there ain't nobody that stands before Christ [Applause] Jesus I thank God for his prophet of Malachi 4 but to be honest I needed even more than that I thank God for every Godly holy message preacher that's preaching the truth but Harry I needed more than that I needed the son of man himself you'll never re receive another sign this is it thus saith the Lord would a prophet of God make a statement like that if it wasn't true you're receiving your greatest son and your last son before the appearing of Christ there's only one way that can be true is that the son of man was there in order to answer to the anti type of Abraham and Sarah that's the last sign they saw there might have been streaks across the sky there might have been Thunder there might have been lightning the mean might the moon might have looked pink and the sun might have looked orange everything said oh my there it is yeah oh praise the Lord praise the Lord yeah we look at that too but we've done had our greatest son come on children I'm not believeing any signs that God sent to the Earth but my greatest sign is not Russia oh I know they're talking World War II and they're talking this and that and the other what difference is that matter to me I've already received my greatest son and I have heard from that voice not the voice of a Kian not the voice of an illiterate preacher I heard Christ Jesus the son of man call I didn't hear William brandom I'm not hearing Donnie Reagan I hope you're hearing more than Donnie Reagan today I hope you're hearing more than Tim pro and the rest of these brothers that are preaching I hope you're hearing Jesus Christ calling you to that Oneness with himself lay aside the world lay aside everything that hinders you and become one was Christ Jesus remember I tell you in the name of the Lord if you regard me to be his servant this is the last sign the church will see according to the scripture that was the last thing that Abraham seen done before the promised son arrived Hallelujah and somebody said again spiritual Amnesia this is the last sign remember thus sayith the Lord did you ever hear me say that but what it was true you are seeing your last son that scripture you've seen your last sign Pentecost now Lance when we were still in it the last sign had done been seen yet we were jumping running shouting screaming holling glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God what it's good to say glory to God but what am I glorying to God for well this is what I'm gloring to God for the son of man has come down in the end time the Lord Jesus borrowed a body a body that he Sanctified by his cleansing blood and was able to use that human anatomy to speak things that only the Lord God himself knew do you think a lot of these things that brother renon preached about was brother Brandon brother Brandon was not a smart man he was not an intellectual man God didn't need an intellectual man all he needed was a body huah was a body then God could speak through that man things that had never been uttered before and by doing so it would form an invisible Union between Christ and the bride and the bride would be so magnetized to him and the devil say say away stay away say away that's a cult that's a cult that's a call and the bride can't help us you just overcome oh oh Hallelujah here I go here I go oh it's a cult it's a cult you imagine that little Eagle down in the barnyard him trying to come up on that Roost pole he taking big long claws and you know kind of set them around that pole tell to set up poor guy I mean he was just rocking back and forth every day didn't hard sleep a wink during the night cuz his body was so big he wasn't made for a pole he made for a tree that's the way we were we was out there in them poles of denomination and this and that and the but one day that mother Eagle

know some maybe that's the way we used to get our little dab of [Applause] corn but the prophet said when he heard that he said that sounded right it echoed a voice from within him and he looked up there and he saw a being like what he wanted to be brother Paul it's the first time had had ever seen the son of man I I I I mean an eagle first time he'd ever seen one but there was something that struck down on his soul Mama you're me and I'm you what should I do jump jump about this time here comes the mama she goes over to the Head Bishop the pastor rooster stay away from those tapes it's a

Hallelujah since I was a little boy I've dreamed about flying I'll be 68 in a couple months I've dreamed about it my whole life I don't have a pack on my back I don't have a suit on or respect but I just kind of take off running like this and I'm gone I figure somehow it must be embedded in My DNA maybe that I'm not a chicken after all GL Hallelujah aren't you glad you ain't a chicken after all but it took more than Miracles it took more than signs took the revealing of the son of man this is the LI sign remember thus sayeth the Lord did you ever hear me say that but what it was true you're seeing your Li sign that's scriptural you've seen your last son Pentecost bride you have seen yours The Living Word don't follow this person that person this move my goodness look at how many moves we have you understand what the issue has been for decades around our message the search for the Messiah is still on cuz people have not recognized who and what the Messiah is it's Christ it's not some preacher it's not some church it's not some great big move it's Christ Jesus Jus and his presence is unrecognized you imagine that little guy when he finally got up off the fence post and he got remember him never flew in his life he didn't know how to fly but he had to trust her he didn't how to bend his wings brother Jack to be able to cup them in order to catch the wind you know Eagle Eagle spends a whole lot more time soaring than he actually does exercising glory to God I'm a Christian Hallelujah I'll tell you one thing I'm that another but he knows how to set his wings brother sister that's where we need to be in this hour setting our wings in the Wind of the anointing of the son of man instead of you and I struggling trying to be this and trying to do that let's just go in the wings and set it in the Wind of the hour and you'll find out it ain't you no more it ain't your faithfulness no more it ain't me it ain't this man it ain't that man it's this son of man up here Jesus Christ CHR the [Applause] word you see but Satan tries to upset the bride with things to keep her from letting Christ being formed in her own being so whether it's Troubles of Life anxieties moves you know around us or this man or that man or this Doctrine or whatever more it's to try to keep Christ from being formed into the stage of maturity in our life we'll pick it up again Galatians 4:19 my little children of whom I travail in birth again I travailed in birth again so it had already happened but some things had attacked the galatian church what was it legalism it couldn't take Christ out of them but Satan found a way to keep the Christ from being formed into the fullness of what God wanted it to be the stature of a perfect man so get them sidetracked on this and get them sidetracked on that and sidetracked on something else so here they throw Paul back into this labor my little children of whom I travail notice he doesn't say Christ but I travail this is what Real Men of God go through they want you to be what Jesus has made you to be I'm not looking for any reganit you don't want to be me why would you settle to be like me when he wants you to be like him yes but Paul said I travail and birth again until Christ be formed in you so as a formless embryo by degrees takes the shape of a human being so the Christian by degrees starts taking the shape and the form of the perfect man and the perfect man is not you it's not me it's not you and I think well we'll get to a place we'll never make another mistake you'll never get to that place in this life the perfect man we're struggling for is not us anyway it's Christ Jesus so Paul sent legalism among the galatian Believers and what it did it reversed their growth in Christ Jesus and then it sent the man of God back into labor pain so he had to go back and and redeal with some of the very fundamental foundations of the faith you why because they listen to things they shouldn't listen to amen but as that embryo when the mother begins to grow and many of you have seen scans of your children and your grandchildren absolutely amazing a few weeks old and have that thumb stuck in its mouth it don't look like a dog or a cat or an airplane or a go-kart is taking on the image of a human being the galatian church had this Christ child being formed in them so he sent this legalism among them what he calls it to regress they would lose part of that imagery then they're fussing and fighting and arguing over who's got the biggest church and who's got the most important Ministry and all that stuff and it throw the man of God right back into this birth cycle again my little children of whom I travail in birth again again children how many times have you thrown me again and again and again but I love you with all of my heart and I am not giving up on you you hear me you hear me I am not giving up on you and don't you give up on me but Brother D I messed up so many times so what else is new so what do men of God do they do like Paul did he goes right back and he trails and if has to start at the Bottom Rung on faith and salvation predestination whatever he's got to do and he'll get them pass up that stage again and then the embryo will start taking on the very image of Christ not your pastor not your Prophet Christ amen till it becomes more and more defined till it starts looking like the Lord Jesus don't you love him let's bow our heads together if you would oh how many wants that in your heart that God can just help you that Christ Jesus can be seen from your soul don't stop at the embryo praise God praise God I got it I got it what you got was the start don't just Rejoice because of the start and then stop but keep growing to the image of the perfect man thank you Lord thank you Lord God so we can love like him we can forgive like like him we can move Beyond grudges we can forgive those that don't even ask us for forgiveness i't talking about just seen on the sick and casting out Devils I'm talking about living and acting and living and believing like Jesus Christ through the revealing of this word how many with me this morning say Lord that's what I want to be that's what I want to be Lord Heavenly Father oh dear Jesus this is what I want to be father help me Lord help me dear God mold me shape me this year Lord I've been preaching for 50 years pastoring for 40 what good does that do to come up to the end of the way and get sidetracked on this or that or the other some of these folks have been Christians for longer than I've been preaching but what good does that do any of us if we don't allow you to finish your work and as it was an impossibility as it seemed for Abraham and Sarah to be turned back to young men or young women this so it may seem that way to us today proving the providential mercy of God the Sarah didn't even believe it anyway a matter of fact your Prophet said she never did finally she received enough strength to conceive because she considered you Faithful but Abraham was way ahead of her but because she was part of Abraham you couldn't leave her out the Lord Jesus is way ahead of us but because we're part of him you can't leave us out thank you Father forgive us for our smirking forgive us of our laughing in the tent forgive us of our Humanity our shortcomings remember us Lord God may become more and more under the influence of what you have done in this day it's no wonder to me that Satan wants people to be so occupied with things of Life they don't listen to tapes no more they don't read books no more they'd rather read Instagram than read the future home they'd rather read Facebook than read the church ages but it ain't going to be Facebook that's going to unite us to the body change it's not going to be Instagram or this or that or the other it'll be us feeding on the word because as we feed on that word we actually become the word yeah somehow that little Eagle had to trust his mama he couldn't trust himself CU he' never flown before he couldn't trust his understanding he didn't understand it or his reasoning he had to trust her imagine as he flew off that fence post and got higher and higher in one way the more scared that he got but he had to believe that she could die faster as Brother David Siler said it here in that awesome sermon he brought to us Lord that that mother Eagle can fly down faster than them babies can fall praise God because they have been clocked at flying down at 200 miles an hour so Lord God you can fly down to rescue me faster than I can hit the ground may we by faith today Lord spread our wings maybe there's some that's sick and they need healing may they spread their wings may they flop Them Wings of Faith to the land of good health yes Lord God just as it happened here last Sunday at the end of the service Lord when you put it on my heart to speak those words to the church Hallelujah Lord several different ones hearing back from them and the anointing fell on their heart and something that had bothered them for years it fell around their feet that that day thank you Lord they walked out of here changed oh Jesus it's great as the discernment was yet looking at it yesterday I found where the Prophet said it several times over there is something greater than the discernment coming something greater than the discernment what was it he said it was the speaking of the word I'm so glad that the full manifestation did not stop with just the discernment since the one you used to discern is not here so before he left you went to the last phas which is not the discernment of a prophet Discerning and telling people this and that and the other but speaking the word most of us don't discern we don't have the ability to discern but Lord God if that word can become alive in our hearts and a son or of daughter of God can take that word and place it on their lips and speak the word it's the same as deity speaking oh Hallelujah May that anointing drop up here this morning Father and they've got a wered son a wavered daughter sickness and disease may they be able to speak to it today in the name of Jesus oh I know what a lot of preachers want some of these preachers want to be the one that'll speak the word so it can bring them all the credit and all the tribute but Lord God I pray you would let that fall in the hearts of mamas daddies maybe some teenagers here today are fighting besetting sins and they can't get the best of it may their word drop in their heart Hallelujah the Bible tells us in the Book of Psalms about Joseph the word of the Lord tried him until his word came so the word of the Lord tried him until his word came and then he took his word and could place it on his lips Lord Jesus no wonder the prophet said the power of God living in us today if we have the Holy Ghost we will call our own bodies from the dust of the Earth We Worship You Jesus We Worship You Lord God we worship you Lord we

presence right now what could God do in this place every one of us could lay aside our own thinking our plans for the day for tomorrow just shut the world out our schedules Lord what do you want to do in this service we got a little sister that give her heart to the Lord just a little while back she's been talking to her mom and daddy about wanting to be baptized and we're going to baptize her this morning keep in mind now this might be the last one we'll ever baptize I don't know there could be a million more but this could be the last one the important thing is is that we're ready and we're feeding on the unfailing body word remember what he tells us you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man so as you feed upon that word you're becoming that word oh you say how can that be brother Donnie why do you think the devil is so pushing the social media thing movies games video games look at all this stuff that he's doing pushing it into that realm feed it into people where they feed on it day and night day and night day and night and then they go to acting it out he broke into that understanding that God had a long time ago you become what you feed on constantly oh
