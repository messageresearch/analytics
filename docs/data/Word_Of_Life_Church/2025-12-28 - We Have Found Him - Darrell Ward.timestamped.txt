[12:35] Lord saw fit to take their baby boy home
[12:37] yesterday morning. Please pray for the

[14:26] Let's just go to the Lord in prayer.
[14:29] Dear Lord Jesus, it's almost impossible
[14:32] &gt;&gt; to come up here and not be emotional,
[14:35] but Lord, I love you and I know these
[14:37] people love you. We look to you for all
[14:40] of our needs, Lord. And Lord, we that
[14:43] story Louie told, I hadn't heard that,
[14:45] but Brother Bram said in another place
[14:48] that the Holy Ghost was the enforcer.
[14:51] And he said, "And many a night when my
[14:53] children was late coming in, I I sent
[14:56] that enforcer to him
[14:58] &gt;&gt; to bring them [snorts] home." And God,
[15:00] we can do that today. And Lord, against
[15:03] these diseases and things, Lord, he's
[15:05] the enforcer. He enforces our healing,
[15:07] Lord. And we're so thankful that we have
[15:09] a place to come to bring these these uh
[15:13] these needs, Lord. And we pray you'd be
[15:15] with the minister as he speaks today.
[15:17] Give us courage and strength, Lord, to
[15:20] go another few days, Lord, and and live
[15:22] a life worthy of the gospel in Jesus
[15:24] name. We love you. Amen.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Skill. Ushers,

[29:17] [music]
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Longing
[29:23] [music]
[29:25] longing
[29:26] [singing]
[29:27] for [music] Jesus.
[29:33] I have
[29:35] a longing
[29:37] [singing] in
[29:39] my heart
[29:42] for
[29:44] him.
[29:47] [music]
[29:48] us to
[29:51] be [singing] near
[29:53] [music] him,
[29:56] to feel his presence.
[30:03] [music]
[30:04] I have
[30:07] a longing [singing]
[30:09] in my heart
[30:13] [music] for
[30:15] him.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; [music]
[30:23] &gt;&gt; We live this life and [music] it's full
[30:27] of disappointments.
[30:33] Trials come to [music] try to make us
[30:37] [singing] fail.
[30:42] [music] Through it all, there [singing]
[30:45] still burns a desire.
[30:51] [music]
[30:52] And deep within my heart
[30:56] comes forth a cry.
[31:02] I'm longing
[31:06] to [music] be taken [singing]
[31:08] from this place.
[31:11] I'm yearning
[31:16] to [music] see his glorious face.
[31:21] I know that [music and singing] he's
[31:25] here calling me by name.
[31:30] No [music and singing] more sorrow, no
[31:32] more pain.
[31:35] My greatest
[31:37] desire [singing and music]
[31:39] is to be changed.
[31:42] [music]
[31:44] There's nothing left in this world
[31:48] [music] but destruction.
[31:53] We see people [singing and music]
[31:55] turning
[31:57] back to their old ways. [singing]
[32:01] [music]
[32:03] And by the grace of God, there's a bride
[32:07] [music] here [singing] that's praying
[32:12] for the promise of the hour [music] to
[32:17] be [singing] fulfilled.
[32:22] I'm [music] longing
[32:26] to be [singing] taken from this place.
[32:31] I'm [music] yearning [singing]
[32:36] to see his glorious face.
[32:41] I know [music and singing] that he's
[32:45] here calling me [singing and music]
[32:48] by name.
[32:50] No more sorrow, no more pain.

[33:10] this place.
[33:13] I'm yearning [singing]
[33:17] to [music] see his glorious face.
[33:22] I [singing] know that he's
[33:26] here calling [singing]
[33:27] me by name. [music]
[33:30] No more sorrow, no [singing] more pain.
[33:35] My greatest
[33:37] desire
[33:39] is to be changed. [singing]
[33:44] My only
[33:47] desire [singing]
[33:49] is to [music] be changed.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[34:01] [applause]
[34:04] [music]
[34:08] &gt;&gt; last Sunday that we'll ever be together
[34:10] in 25,
[34:12] right? I hope I'm writing that in and
[34:14] saying that. I think we got one more
[34:15] service Wednesday night. Just look
[34:19] around a second. Just look at look at
[34:20] your neighbors.
[34:23] Just go ahead and look at them.
[34:28] God's been good to us. We've lost some
[34:31] of our congregation this past year, but
[34:35] God had a greater plan.
[34:38] We don't understand a lot of things, but
[34:39] we respect and know that he does all
[34:42] things well, don't we?
[34:44] &gt;&gt; God's been good to us as a congregation.
[34:46] God's blessed us with a wonderful
[34:48] ministry.
[34:49] wonderful people to go to church with.
[34:52] We've been blessed.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor and say, "You have
[34:57] blessed me." Now, I mean it from your
[34:59] heart. Praise the Lord. And we're going
[35:02] to hear Brother Harry the last Sunday
[35:04] morning in 2025.
[35:06] We've got to hear The Dove Leads the
[35:08] Lamb. Would you like to hear that this
[35:10] morning? Give Brother Harry a good hand
[35:11] this morning as we sing it with you.
[35:19] D.
[35:22] Don't you appreciate, brother Louie?
[35:25] Most of the time I do.
[35:30] I was thinking about what brother Daryl
[35:32] said last night
[35:36] about
[35:38] really it was him that put the desire in
[35:40] us. Do you know if you're here this
[35:42] morning and you really are seeking the
[35:44] Lord from your soul in this message and
[35:47] truth, do you know why?
[35:50] Because he made it possible.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; You're not here just because your mom
[35:56] and daddy's here, your grandpa's here,
[35:57] or whatever, but you're here because the
[36:00] almighty God who spoke and said, "Let
[36:02] there be."
[36:04] Also spoke and said, "There will be a
[36:07] bride."
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she's manifested right here.
[36:12] Let them say what they want to about us.
[36:14] And we're crazy. Yes, we [music] are
[36:16] crazy. We're crazy about Jesus.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; [music]
[36:23] &gt;&gt; The spirit and the bride [singing]
[36:26] was single
[36:31] [music] elect
[36:33] and stirred [singing]
[36:34] inside their home. [music]
[36:39] Our [singing] united time has come. We
[36:42] and the father [music]
[36:44] [singing]
[36:45] are one.
[36:48] You will [music and singing] be with our
[36:51] Lord forever more.
[36:56] Oh, evening [music]
[36:58] light has come. The bride is making
[37:02] preparation. [music]
[37:05] She's here in [singing]
[37:06] the shadow of her king.
[37:10] [music]
[37:16] He's cleaning from inside
[37:18] [music and singing]
[37:20] and the lead
[37:25] [music]
[37:28] finally clean [music]
[37:31] was granted to her.
[37:36] Jes [music]
[37:37] [singing] washed in the blood of God's
[37:40] hol
[37:43] [music]
[37:43] with righteousness
[37:46] not our own.
[37:48] We're just before his throne. [music]
[37:54] Where we reign with our Lord [music]
[37:57] forever more. [singing]
[38:02] Oh [music]
[38:04] light has come. The bride is making
[38:08] preparation.
[38:10] We're still hearing [music and singing]
[38:12] the shout of our king.
[38:18] The tokens [music]
[38:19] been
[38:22] cleaned from inside. [music and singing]
[38:26] And the dark lead
[38:30] once again
[38:34] [music and singing]
[38:36] has come. The bride is making [singing]
[38:42] today [music] we're hearing
[38:45] of our king. [singing]
[38:49] [music]
[38:50] The token's been made.
[38:54] He's [music] clear from [singing]
[38:56] inside.
[38:58] And the lead [music]
[39:02] once again.
[39:05] Oh, and the leads
[39:09] [music] once again.
[39:15] [music]
[39:16] Praise the Lord.
[39:20] Hallelujah.
[39:23] Praise the Lord. [music]
[39:25] &gt;&gt; I believe he is. Don't you?
[39:27] &gt;&gt; I've been listening to the couple of
[39:30] different Christmas sermons that Brother
[39:32] Brandon had preached and one of them was
[39:34] the one brother Daryl had been studying
[39:35] and listening to and why it had to be
[39:37] shepherds. And brother Brandham
[39:39] addressed the people at that time frame
[39:42] which is December of 1964.
[39:45] And he called them Christmas time sheep.
[39:50] I thought, how unusual. Christmas time
[39:55] sheep. I hope we have some Christmas
[39:58] time sheep here today.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[40:02] &gt;&gt; you can be seated. We got a little baby
[40:04] to dedicate today. And brother Jonah and
[40:07] Sister Julie couch to bring their little
[40:10] baby girl today, Ellie. and we'll
[40:13] dedicate her to the Lord.
[40:17] Bring [singing]
[40:18] them in.
[40:21] Bring them in.
[40:25] Bring them [singing] in from the fields
[40:30] [music]
[40:31] of sin.
[40:34] Bring them in.
[40:38] Bring [singing and music] them in.
[40:43] Bring the little ones [music] to Jesus.
[40:50] [singing]
[40:51] Congratulations.
[40:53] Let's bow our heads together.
[40:58] Heavenly Father,
[41:00] I've held hundreds of these little
[41:03] newborns like this.
[41:05] It never ceases to amaze me the miracle
[41:08] of life.
[41:10] to see the mixture of the DNA and the
[41:13] chromosomes of a man and a woman
[41:15] together and to see the product of what
[41:18] it produces.
[41:20] And with that comes such great
[41:23] excitement. And as it has been said at
[41:27] our birth tears
[41:30] are are shed because people are happy.
[41:33] At our passing tears are shed because
[41:36] they are sad.
[41:39] So we know we have an increment of time
[41:42] in between those birth tears and those
[41:45] death tears.
[41:48] We desire Lord to live our lives for you
[41:50] in a way that's pleasing to you.
[41:53] Lord God, these parents stand before you
[41:56] today in your presence to bring back
[41:59] their little daughter Ellie to you.
[42:03] We're praying, Lord, for your wisdom and
[42:05] your strength to them. Help them to be
[42:08] able to love her, nurture her, teach
[42:10] her, raise her in a way that'll be
[42:13] pleasing to you.
[42:16] The excitement, the joy, but we know
[42:18] also with life can come pain and
[42:21] difficulty and sorrow. But may you help
[42:24] them, Lord. For little, we pray you'd
[42:27] watch over her, keep her, keep her from
[42:30] the evils, the diseases of the day.
[42:32] Lord, we commit our life to you today,
[42:35] Father, for a life of service. In the
[42:38] name of the Lord Jesus, we ask. Amen.
[42:46] [applause]
[42:51] [applause]
[42:52] Bless you all.
[42:57] Let's stand together. [clears throat]
[43:05] Truly, as the scripture says in the book
[43:07] of James, our life
[43:10] is as a vapor.
[43:13] It u
[43:16] it's here and it's gone. I remember when
[43:19] I was a boy, some of y'all was thinking,
[43:22] "Wow, you can remember that far back."
[43:25] Yeah, I can literally. It seemed like
[43:28] the summer days would never pass. The
[43:30] days were so long.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Now it seems like they're passed before
[43:36] you even realize they're gone.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Y'all experience that, too.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; And you can realize why it's so
[43:43] important that the life that we have is
[43:46] lived in a way that's pleasing to the
[43:48] Lord Jesus. When it's all said and done,
[43:51] that's what matters more than anything.
[43:54] I've preached uh funerals of rich, poor,
[43:59] middle class, upper class, lower class,
[44:01] no class.
[44:03] I've never seen one casket full of gold,
[44:07] keys to Cadillacs, Lincoln,
[44:10] titles or property, just a body laying
[44:14] there with no soul there.
[44:18] If I have to face that time and I'm not
[44:20] alive to be changed, I want my life to
[44:22] have been lived for the Lord Jesus to
[44:25] know
[44:27] &gt;&gt; there's value to it. Don't you?
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Whether you're a preacher or not, just
[44:31] just a Christian that you can live for
[44:33] the Lord. It's a great honor for us. We
[44:36] greet you today in the name of the Lord
[44:37] Jesus. For those of you that wasn't able
[44:40] to be with us in the service last night,
[44:42] we had a wonderful time here. Had an
[44:44] awesome, awesome service. and thank
[44:46] brother Daryl for obeying the Lord and
[44:49] presence of the Lord but just so
[44:51] wonderful uh people singing after after
[44:54] the communion and u people didn't want
[44:57] to go home to me that's good churchmen
[45:02] &gt;&gt; that's good church people just so in
[45:04] love with the Lord let's [clears throat]
[45:07] read today if you would second Peter
[45:08] chapter 1 verse 2
[45:14] grace and peace be multip multiplied
[45:16] unto you through the knowledge of God
[45:17] and of Jesus our Lord, according as his
[45:21] divine power hath given unto us all
[45:25] things that pertain unto life and
[45:27] godliness to be like God, through the
[45:30] knowledge of him that hath called us to
[45:33] glory and virtue,
[45:35] whereby given unto us exceeding great
[45:38] and precious promises, that by these you
[45:41] might be partakers
[45:43] of the divine nature.
[45:45] Having escaped the corruption that is in
[45:48] the world through lust,
[45:51] and beside this, giving all diligence,
[45:53] add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[45:57] knowledge, and to knowledge temperance,
[46:00] and to temperance patience, and to
[46:03] patience godliness,
[46:05] and to godliness, brotherly kindness,
[46:09] and to brotherly kindness, charity. How
[46:12] many like to be remembered today as we
[46:14] pray over the word? God bless you. Me
[46:15] too. [clears throat]
[46:18] Heavenly Father, as we come again today
[46:21] in this place that we have built and
[46:23] dedicated to your honor and to your
[46:26] glory.
[46:28] Father, we're not gathered here today so
[46:30] that any individual, any human being
[46:34] would get credit for anything. We're
[46:37] here to give you praise.
[46:40] We want to be as you have told us that
[46:42] when we stand before you that day that
[46:44] we will stand there and and simply give
[46:47] give credit of course and give answer to
[46:50] our life. But no matter what we would
[46:52] have accomplished, we know that we will
[46:54] stand there as unworthy servants as far
[46:58] as ourselves. There's not a one of us
[47:01] here today, no matter what we've done or
[47:03] what we think we've done, that deserves
[47:05] grace and mercy. But you've given that
[47:08] to each of us. And for that we are
[47:10] thankful. Now we come today again, Lord,
[47:12] to approach your word and to approach
[47:14] your people with the word. I pray that
[47:17] you'd help me. Help me to get out of the
[47:19] way. Lord, shut my mouth to anything
[47:21] that would displease you. Help me to
[47:23] follow the leading of the spirit of God
[47:25] and your channel. We ask, Lord. Father,
[47:28] you see this prayer call, dear God, of
[47:31] our sister. Lord God, you see these
[47:34] needs, these requests, Lord, that she
[47:36] has before you, the leadership of the
[47:39] spirit of God that's needed in her life.
[47:41] I pray, Father, that you'd be with her,
[47:43] Lord. All these hundreds of hands that
[47:45] were uplifted, be mindful of every need.
[47:48] We ask in the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:50] Christ. And the saints of God said,
[47:53] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[48:00] I don't mind telling you I've enjoyed
[48:02] all these virtues that we have looked at
[48:05] thus far and I've been blessed uh uh by
[48:09] by studying them and by preaching them.
[48:12] But I think this one has been one of the
[48:14] most surprising to me and one that I
[48:18] have enjoyed so much, so tremendous in
[48:20] such a tremendous way. being able to
[48:23] bring a part of God's own nature in
[48:27] avenues that I personally had never
[48:30] looked at before in order to be like God
[48:34] and to have attributes that would be
[48:36] given to us by the new birth and
[48:38] something that he would share with us of
[48:42] his own nature and of his own being. And
[48:45] to know that we live in in quite a
[48:48] complex time, a difficult time. The Lord
[48:51] Jesus knew that sin would be where it is
[48:54] today. He knew that the outrage of
[48:56] darkness and everything that's going on
[48:59] in the world, he knew that it would
[49:01] regress to the time that we're in. and
[49:04] only a couple of times in civilization
[49:06] that it could even be compared to in the
[49:09] days of Noah and in the days of Sodom
[49:11] and Gomorrah. The Lord Jesus could have
[49:14] used many different time frames to be
[49:17] able to reference the time of his
[49:20] coming, but he chose two particular ones
[49:23] as it was in the days of Noah and as it
[49:26] was in the days of Sodom. Historically,
[49:30] there were awful times and different
[49:32] time frames and he could have used any
[49:34] of those in a reference. But the thing
[49:36] of it is none of those others actually
[49:39] met the same type that would be set
[49:43] forth in this day. So, we can see by
[49:45] that that we're living in a in a time
[49:48] that it's a time of prophecy, but
[49:50] prophecy is not only good, but prophecy
[49:53] can also be forecasting things that are
[49:55] going to be evil. And we believe we're
[49:57] in that time. So when the Lord Jesus
[50:00] came to the earth, he started using
[50:01] terminology that had never been used by
[50:04] any of the of the prophets, the sages,
[50:07] the seers that had been on the earth to
[50:09] uh before him. And he began to set forth
[50:12] something that was totally new. Now
[50:14] remember, it wasn't just new to the
[50:15] people of God, but it was new to the
[50:17] devil. So the devil had to listen and he
[50:20] had to pay attention to what God was
[50:23] doing and the change that was being
[50:25] brought about. So the Lord Jesus started
[50:28] using things about sayings about the
[50:31] world. Well, that terms had been used in
[50:34] the Hebrew in the Old Testament, but it
[50:36] never been used like the Lord Jesus
[50:39] began to use it. So he said, "You're not
[50:42] of this world. You're uh different from
[50:44] the world. I'm not of the world and you
[50:46] aren't of the world. And if you were of
[50:48] the world, the world would hate you. Now
[50:50] you imagine the disciples as they were
[50:52] there and then some of them understood
[50:54] Greek and the Greek word there is of
[50:56] course the cosmos which is the world
[50:58] order. Jesus didn't say the earths but
[51:01] he said the world which is not the same
[51:04] thing. The world is on the earth, but
[51:08] the earth is not necessarily the world
[51:11] in every scriptural reference because it
[51:13] is the order which now occupies and
[51:17] controls the earth. So we don't need as
[51:20] far as a new ball of the earth. We don't
[51:22] need a new earth. We just need this
[51:24] earth to be able to be completed in its
[51:26] new birth and be changed and the order
[51:29] the cosmos will be destroyed. Now the
[51:32] real Christians, you know, they may look
[51:34] at it and try to sort through it and
[51:36] figure out how how do we live in the
[51:37] world and how do we a part of the world,
[51:40] but yet we don't partake of the things
[51:42] that are wrong, that are sinful, that
[51:45] are questionable, that would make us
[51:48] unlike God. So there's two aspects of it
[51:51] and one of them is godliness and the
[51:53] other aspect is ungodly. So to be one,
[51:57] you cannot be the other. And you cannot
[51:59] be both at the same time. So you've got
[52:02] to either be godly or you've got to be
[52:05] ungodly. And what is it that identifies
[52:07] us? No doubt churches all over the Tri
[52:09] Cities today have used the same words,
[52:11] godly and ungodliness, righteous and
[52:14] unrighteousness. And the words would not
[52:16] be a problem with us. But the
[52:19] interpretation of what they mean and the
[52:22] way they say it, we would have issues or
[52:25] hopefully we would because there's got
[52:28] to be something that will separate God's
[52:31] people to make them like God different
[52:34] than just going to church and say,
[52:36] "Well, I I'm a Christian. I'm a
[52:38] believer. I' i've accepted the Lord
[52:40] Jesus as my savior, and all that's
[52:42] wonderful and good." But a person that
[52:44] has done that still doesn't mean that
[52:46] they've reached the place that we just
[52:48] read for our text that Peter wrote
[52:50] about. So he's writing about people that
[52:53] have been saved, as we would say,
[52:56] sanctified, and they've started growing
[52:58] up into the stature of a perfect man.
[53:01] Remember, perfect worship can only be
[53:03] reflected in the stature of a perfect
[53:06] son and daughter of God. So to be like
[53:09] God is to hate certain things. Things
[53:13] not people things. To be like God is to
[53:17] love certain things. There's some things
[53:20] that God loves that you know what I I
[53:23] imagine most of us would probably
[53:25] struggle with it in our humanity. I'll
[53:27] give an example. The prophet said God
[53:30] loves to let his children get in such a
[53:33] spot that they don't know what to do.
[53:36] and then he comes on the scene. I
[53:39] particularly don't like those types of
[53:40] instances,
[53:42] &gt;&gt; but he loves it. So, I'm praying he'll
[53:43] help me to love him.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? Now,
[53:47] there's things that God loves then
[53:49] that's going to be contrary to our
[53:50] humanity. And then there'll be certain
[53:53] things that God hates that our humanity
[53:56] might gravitate toward. So each of us
[53:59] are in this in this you know this
[54:01] difficult spot of trying to find okay
[54:03] God for my life what what what do you
[54:06] want me to do how do you want me to
[54:08] behave in this world now let us read if
[54:11] you would today in St. John 12:2. Now
[54:14] remember, these words are not up for
[54:16] debate because it was the words of the
[54:18] Lord Jesus that said it. I imagine that
[54:20] it must have been very peculiar and more
[54:23] than likely very very much misunderstood
[54:25] whenever he said these things and they
[54:27] are still today. Notice Jesus is going
[54:30] to say something that is going to take
[54:33] the spirit of God to be able to discern
[54:36] the the intent and the meaning. He that
[54:38] loveth his life shall lose it.
[54:42] He that loveth his life.
[54:46] How many loves your life?
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Okay, the rest of you are liars.
[54:53] How many loves your life?
[54:56] And there's an element of loving your
[54:58] life that is not wrong. But according to
[55:01] the Lord Jesus, there's an element of
[55:03] loving your life is sinful.
[55:06] And as a matter of fact, you'll lose it
[55:07] if you do.
[55:09] Listen. He that loveth his life shall
[55:13] lose it.
[55:15] He that hateth his life in this world
[55:21] shall keep it unto life eternal.
[55:27] So in order to get eternal life, I have
[55:30] to hate my life.
[55:34] How am I supposed to hate my life when I
[55:36] love my life?
[55:38] God makes each of us with laws of
[55:41] self-preservation
[55:43] to eat, to take care of oursel, to do
[55:46] certain things. Do we all do that? If we
[55:49] don't, shame on us. But yet, you imagine
[55:52] how these disciples didn't have the Holy
[55:54] Ghost yet. And the Lord Jesus, it would
[55:56] seem as if though that he said one thing
[55:59] that was contrary to the other. So he
[56:02] says, "He that loveth his life shall
[56:05] lose it. He that hateth his life,
[56:08] notice, but where? In this world.
[56:14] So, a person that loves their life in
[56:17] the order of the world. Now, we're
[56:19] talking about in society and in the
[56:23] structure of the world and the order of
[56:25] the world. So, a person loves their life
[56:28] in that. So, does that mean that us as
[56:30] believers that it's totally sinful for
[56:33] us to be nice to people in the world?
[56:35] You're not even a Christian if you're
[56:37] not nice to people.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Is there anything wrong with us having
[56:41] friends out there? Not a thing in the
[56:43] world wrong with it as long as you don't
[56:45] let them friends lead you contrary to
[56:47] the word of God. As a matter of fact,
[56:50] Jesus said he would leave us in the
[56:52] world so that our lights would shine
[56:55] before men that they may see our good
[56:56] works and glorify our father which is in
[56:58] heaven. But look at how delicate that
[57:01] that is in this verse. So he that loveth
[57:04] his life shall lose it. He that hateth
[57:07] his life in this world shall keep it
[57:10] unto life eternal. Now all of us no
[57:12] doubt know people and have met people
[57:14] that are just absolutely miserable. They
[57:17] don't like life. They don't like church.
[57:19] They don't like nothing and nobody in
[57:22] it. And they think they're heavenly.
[57:24] They're just a bunch of crabs.
[57:27] I said, they're just a dried up old crab
[57:29] and they're in a bad mood. And they
[57:31] don't like church. They don't like
[57:33] singing. I don't care what you do, where
[57:35] you go, what you eat. They always growl
[57:38] and complain and sing. I'm heavenly. You
[57:40] ain't done it. You're as rotten as an
[57:42] old crab.
[57:44] Amen.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; But you see, the balance is us hating
[57:48] our life in this order. Now, why
[57:51] wouldn't we whenever we know there's a
[57:54] world that is so far beyond this one and
[57:57] God allowing our church age's messenger
[58:00] to go beyond that curtain of time and
[58:02] bring us a little insight to the order
[58:06] where our brothers and sisters are this
[58:09] morning, waiting for us. Why wouldn't we
[58:11] hate it in the order of the world? Now
[58:14] notice since then Jesus goes on to say
[58:16] in St. John 15:18, "If the world hate
[58:20] you, ye know that it hated me before it
[58:26] hated you." Now, does the world as a
[58:30] whole hate modern Christianity?
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Does the world as a
[58:41] whole hate modern Christianity? No. Now,
[58:46] there may be certain Muslims that do. Of
[58:48] course, they they decreed that in their
[58:50] own laws, you know, to kill the
[58:52] unbelievers, infidels. That's what we
[58:53] are. I'm glad I'm an infidel according
[58:55] to their God. I'd be in a mess if I
[58:58] believe what they believe.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; But I want you to notice now how Jesus
[59:02] said this. If the world hate you, so
[59:05] what is it about certain Christians that
[59:08] the world hates and other so-called
[59:10] Christians, the world loves them.
[59:14] They don't dress different than them.
[59:16] They don't talk different. They listen
[59:18] to the some of the same music and
[59:20] they'll see some of them at the same
[59:21] bars and the same, you know, places
[59:24] where they hang out together. And they
[59:26] love those type of Christians. And yet
[59:29] there's other Christians that the world,
[59:32] the cosmos, the world order absolutely
[59:35] hates them. [snorts]
[59:36] Why? Why is it? Because they believe in
[59:41] Jesus. It's very popular to believe in
[59:43] Jesus to wear a cross around their neck.
[59:46] How many rappers wear crosses around
[59:48] their necks? How many rock and roll
[59:50] singers? Come on, somebody. How many
[59:53] country music people and rock and roll
[59:55] and this and that and the other? It's a
[59:56] big deal to be religious. My goodness,
[59:59] Christianity has broke over every
[1:00:01] barrier as far as what they think
[1:00:04] because now we got Christian drug
[1:00:06] addicts
[1:00:07] and we got Christian homosexuals and we
[1:00:11] got Christian this. That is an
[1:00:13] abomination
[1:00:14] to put the name Christian with such
[1:00:17] thing. Come on, somebody.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; WE GOT CHRISTIAN liars and Christian
[1:00:22] this and Christian that. No, no, we
[1:00:25] don't.
[1:00:27] BUT YOU SEE, THE world totally accepts
[1:00:31] Christian addicts. The world accepts
[1:00:34] Christian homosexuality.
[1:00:37] The world accepts Christian this and
[1:00:39] Christian that. But who are the
[1:00:42] Christians that the world hates?
[1:00:45] Those who separate themselves.
[1:00:50] Now, by separation, I don't mean that
[1:00:52] you just still don't go to Walmart and
[1:00:54] Kroger and Engles and Food City and
[1:00:57] Amigos after church. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:00] But you're separated by the way you
[1:01:01] live, by the way you talk, by the way
[1:01:04] you behave yourself, you're nice to
[1:01:06] them, you do business with them. Is that
[1:01:08] right?
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; So you business people, do you all just
[1:01:11] limit your business to Christians only?
[1:01:16] You electricians, you converter guys,
[1:01:18] you rest, you painters, whatever you do,
[1:01:20] Y'ALL JUST WORK FOR message people only,
[1:01:23] right?
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:01:27] You know why? God don't want you to.
[1:01:30] NOW WATCH. THE LORD Jesus is bringing in
[1:01:34] this new
[1:01:36] new commandment, new covenant. So if the
[1:01:39] world hates you, you know that it hated
[1:01:42] me before it hated you. How many here
[1:01:46] loves to be hated today?
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Wow. Not one person. You notice I didn't
[1:01:54] put mine up either.
[1:01:58] And yet if we are going to be true
[1:02:01] Christians, we are going to be hated.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Not just misunderstood. That's not the
[1:02:07] same thing. We are going to be hated.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Notice again in verse
[1:02:17] 19, if ye were of
[1:02:22] the world, the world would love,
[1:02:26] notice the gender which Jesus used to
[1:02:30] identify the rulership of the world. The
[1:02:33] world would love his own. His who? Well,
[1:02:39] who do you figure? The devil.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; So if you were of the world, the world
[1:02:44] would love his own. Well, how is it then
[1:02:46] that the the majority of Christendom in
[1:02:49] this day, the world loves them and they
[1:02:53] have SUCH COMPLIMENTARY things to say
[1:02:55] about them. Oh my, the worldier preacher
[1:02:58] is, the better the world likes him. Oh,
[1:03:01] we go to this church because they don't
[1:03:02] preach against sin. And we go there and
[1:03:04] they've got this program for our kids
[1:03:06] and they've got this program for the
[1:03:08] elderly and they've got this program for
[1:03:11] the middle terms and they got this
[1:03:12] program for this and our preacher is so
[1:03:15] nice and I have never heard him rebuke
[1:03:18] anybody. That ain't no servant of God
[1:03:20] then.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, the world loves
[1:03:25] that. Don't you understand? It's the
[1:03:26] consummation of Revelation 13 to where
[1:03:30] that beast power with the religious,
[1:03:33] political, and civil power is going to
[1:03:36] come together and usher in the mark of
[1:03:38] the beast. And it ain't going to be with
[1:03:40] Islam. It's going to be under the oposes
[1:03:43] of so-called Christianity
[1:03:46] because the mother and the daughters are
[1:03:49] coming together.
[1:03:51] Come on, somebody. Don't you understand?
[1:03:53] Islam is nothing but Satan putting up an
[1:03:57] image in front of people so they will
[1:04:00] get their eyes off of the real beast.
[1:04:04] You remember I told you years ago when I
[1:04:06] was on the Serengeti in Kenya in
[1:04:09] Tanzania, a great park there in the
[1:04:12] Masamara and I was with a brother which
[1:04:15] was a game warden there in in the
[1:04:17] message and and we was able to take
[1:04:19] tours around in these different places
[1:04:21] and we went out into this massive
[1:04:23] massive field in the Masamara and there
[1:04:26] was this big lioness laying up on the
[1:04:29] top of an of an ant mound and those
[1:04:31] things there can be 7 8t tall but this
[1:04:33] one was around four 4 and 1/2 ft tall
[1:04:35] and she was laying right on top of it.
[1:04:37] Out in the field were gazels and Jim's
[1:04:40] buck and all different types of hundreds
[1:04:42] and hundreds of animals and they were
[1:04:44] there and they were eating the little
[1:04:46] the little analopee and things that was
[1:04:48] all around looking at her and they'd
[1:04:50] raise their head up and look down. They
[1:04:51] go down and get some more grass and
[1:04:53] they'd flick their little tail and flick
[1:04:55] their ears and they're watching and
[1:04:56] they'll wet their nose cuz that's the
[1:04:58] way that they they make the sensitivity
[1:05:00] been able to smell. and that's watching
[1:05:03] her and that lioness was laying there
[1:05:04] just every now and then she'd raise her
[1:05:06] tail I guess to let them know she's
[1:05:08] still alive. So I asked the brother that
[1:05:11] was with I said why why aren't they
[1:05:12] running? Why why are they not? He said
[1:05:15] she is a decoy. So he got his binoculars
[1:05:19] out and he got to looking and the grass
[1:05:20] was about this tall average and some of
[1:05:22] it was higher than that. And he got to
[1:05:24] looking and he glassed in a glass and he
[1:05:26] hand me the glasses and now right here
[1:05:28] is the one that they don't they don't
[1:05:30] see. And as I looked through there,
[1:05:33] there was the rest of the pride. And the
[1:05:35] pride was all sulking here. They were
[1:05:38] coming down real low, crawling, but they
[1:05:41] had their eyes on the decoy. She's just
[1:05:44] flicking her tail and they're watching.
[1:05:46] But you know where they were coming
[1:05:48] from? Behind them. Don't you understand
[1:05:50] what Satan does in different ages? He
[1:05:53] sticks up this and he sticks up that.
[1:05:56] All it is is a decoy. The rise of Islam
[1:05:59] in the last day. I want somebody to show
[1:06:02] me in the Bible. Well, the Bible
[1:06:04] prophesies that Islam will rule the
[1:06:06] world. Come on, somebody. Oh, that's
[1:06:10] their claim and that's what they want.
[1:06:12] BUT THERE'S NO BEAST power in prophecy
[1:06:16] that's written to anoint Oh my Islam to
[1:06:19] take over the world. But what does Satan
[1:06:22] do? He raises up this decoy and that
[1:06:25] decoy for people to get their eyes. And
[1:06:27] what does it do to the church annity? It
[1:06:30] drives all the so-called Christians
[1:06:32] together. We got to huddle together.
[1:06:34] We've got to come together. Mother and
[1:06:36] daughters. Oh my. We've had our
[1:06:37] differences, but now we're all one.
[1:06:40] Yeah, they're all one. All right. But
[1:06:42] not one with a word.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Notice Jesus said, "If you were of the
[1:06:47] world," I love these words. "If ye were,
[1:06:52] but I'm glad I'm not." If you were of
[1:06:56] the world, the world would love his own.
[1:07:00] But because ye are not of the world,
[1:07:04] somebody ought to say, "Praise the Lord
[1:07:06] for that."
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Because ye are not of the world, but I
[1:07:11] have chosen you out of the world,
[1:07:16] THEREFORE THE WORLD.
[1:07:24] The world hateth you.
[1:07:28] This is godliness
[1:07:30] revealed in the form of world hatred.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; I'd hate to be a preacher today that
[1:07:37] nobody had anything evil to say against
[1:07:39] them.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; I'd be the first to hit this altar right
[1:07:43] here cuz if you're a man of God, the
[1:07:45] devil's going to hate you. Not only
[1:07:47] preachers, if you're a son or daughter
[1:07:49] of God, the devil's going to hate you.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; There will be people that YOU WILL DO
[1:07:53] WORK FOR. And no matter how you try to
[1:07:56] please them, I don't care what you do,
[1:07:58] they will hate you. You know what it is?
[1:07:59] Many times it's a demon living in their
[1:08:02] body that recognizes the spirit of God
[1:08:04] in your body. And that devil hates you.
[1:08:07] Well, I'm I'm here today to say,
[1:08:09] "Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm glad the
[1:08:12] devil of the world hates me. I'm glad
[1:08:15] the devil hates our church. I'm glad the
[1:08:18] world hates our message. I WOULD NOT
[1:08:20] WANT A SO-CALLED Christianity that
[1:08:23] anybody could live any way they wanted
[1:08:25] to live. They could drink. They could
[1:08:27] booze. They could dope. They could do
[1:08:29] everything in the world and everybody's
[1:08:31] just accept you. But I'll tell you
[1:08:33] friend, that's not the church the Lord
[1:08:35] Jesus calls as his own.
[1:08:39] Now, these are his words, not mine. Now,
[1:08:42] NOTICE IN ST. JOHN 17:6, I have
[1:08:46] manifested thy name, Jesus, in prayer,
[1:08:48] unto the men which thou gavest me out of
[1:08:52] the world. So they were in the world,
[1:08:54] born in the world, of the same carnal
[1:08:56] nature. And yet they were given to Jesus
[1:08:59] out of the world. And how did they treat
[1:09:03] them once Jesus was gone? Beat them,
[1:09:06] FALSELY ACCUSED THEM, eventually kill
[1:09:09] most of them. And yet today in modern
[1:09:12] Christianity, we don't even live right
[1:09:15] enough, holy enough to make the devil
[1:09:17] even mad.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Preach, Brother Dunny.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Thine they were, and thou gavest them
[1:09:28] me.
[1:09:30] Thine they were, and thou gavest them
[1:09:33] me, and they have kept thy word. Verse
[1:09:37] 14, I have given them thy word, and the
[1:09:40] world hath hated them because they are
[1:09:44] not of the world. And they didn't even
[1:09:46] have the Holy Ghost yet,
[1:09:51] EVEN AS I
[1:09:55] am not of the world.
[1:09:59] I wonder how many of the churches in the
[1:10:01] Tri Cities,
[1:10:03] including ours,
[1:10:06] can say this truthfully.
[1:10:08] The world hates me in the same way it
[1:10:11] hated Jesus
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; for the same cause.
[1:10:15] I ain't talking about people hating you
[1:10:17] cuz you done a bad business deal with
[1:10:19] them and you cheated them.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; I think I'll go in the office and preach
[1:10:24] the rest of this.
[1:10:26] I AIN'T TALKING ABOUT THEM HATING YOU
[1:10:28] BECAUSE YOU'VE SINNED AGAINST THEM.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you being so much like
[1:10:33] God, they can't stand you.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; And they don't even really know why.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; This is an aspect of godliness that only
[1:10:42] the elect will ever attain to.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz it will be demons and their bodies
[1:10:48] recognizing God in yours. and they
[1:10:53] declare war
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; where they see God lives.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; So, praise the Lord, Brother Donnie.
[1:11:00] Sounds like it's going to be rough. It
[1:11:02] is,
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; but it's going to get better after a
[1:11:04] while. That's what we're waiting for.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Now, notice in VERSE 15, I PRAY NOT THAT
[1:11:10] thou should have shouldest take them out
[1:11:15] of the world.
[1:11:17] SO, DOES THE LORD WANT US HOW DOES HE
[1:11:20] WANT US TO DEAL THEN with so you
[1:11:22] business SO BROTHER ROB DOES THAT mean
[1:11:24] that from now on you have to put up a
[1:11:25] sign on your door there in your line of
[1:11:27] work that I only work for message people
[1:11:30] only finance homes for message people
[1:11:32] and and you brothers that DO CONVERTERS
[1:11:34] I ONLY BUY CONVERTERS from converted
[1:11:36] people good luck on that
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; some of the converted people I'm not
[1:11:41] sure is converted some of the issues
[1:11:43] I've had to resolve between them honest
[1:11:46] integrity.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD, BROTHER DONNIE.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT US BEING HATED BY
[1:11:53] THE WORLD BECAUSE IN THAT DEMONIC REALM,
[1:11:57] they see something pulsating from your
[1:11:59] soul.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Right here in this building today,
[1:12:02] everybody here is pulsating one of two
[1:12:06] things. Light or darkness.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Every one of us are pulsating out of OUR
[1:12:12] BEING. SO DEMONS don't just look at the
[1:12:14] length of your hair, sisters, or the
[1:12:16] length of your dress, but they look at
[1:12:18] what pulsates from that dynamo in your
[1:12:22] soul. Every one of us ARE PUTTING OFF
[1:12:24] SOMETHING. AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T EVEN
[1:12:27] have to say something to SOME PEOPLE AND
[1:12:29] THEY JUST look at you and they don't
[1:12:32] like you.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, they hate you.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; And they probably don't even know why.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; But don't hate them back. feel sorry for
[1:12:42] him.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; That's the other side of living on the
[1:12:46] hated aspect of godliness.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; That Jesus could look at those that
[1:12:52] hated him and he wouldn't go through and
[1:12:55] heal all only those who believed him.
[1:12:58] And when he broke the bread and the
[1:12:59] fish, he didn't just say, "Now boys,
[1:13:02] hand that out only to the believers,
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; but the liars, the deceivers, the one
[1:13:08] who would witness against him, false
[1:13:10] witness,
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; he helped them, too."
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Godliness. Now, how many wants to be
[1:13:16] more like God? Amen.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Now notice he says, "I PRAY NOT THAT
[1:13:21] THOU SHOULD US TAKE THEM OUT OF the
[1:13:24] world, BUT THAT THOU SHOULDEST keep them
[1:13:29] from the world." Wow. Out.
[1:13:34] Out. We're called out by his grace,
[1:13:39] but we're still in it, but he wants us
[1:13:42] kept from it.
[1:13:44] called out, living in it, but kept from
[1:13:48] its control
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; and its power.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; And what kind of a battle is that? Every
[1:13:55] day of our lives.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Every day of our lives.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Notice again St. John 17:16. THEY ARE
[1:14:04] NOT of the world even as I am not of the
[1:14:09] world. And yet they were born IN THE
[1:14:10] WORLD. BORN OF EARTHLY PARENTS, BORN OF
[1:14:12] NATURAL SEXES ARE. AND JESUS SAID, "THEY
[1:14:14] ARE NOT OF THE WORLD." Oh children, how
[1:14:18] blessed we are.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; IF GOD ALMIGHTY COULD SAY THAT ABOUT
[1:14:22] EACH OF US TODAY, HOW BLESSED WE ARE.
[1:14:25] They are not of the world. EVEN AS I
[1:14:30] AM not of the world.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Sanctify them through thy truth. THY
[1:14:35] WORD IS TRUTH. AS THOU HAST SENT ME into
[1:14:39] the world. Look at him saying this term
[1:14:41] over and over and over again. The world,
[1:14:44] the world, the world.
[1:14:47] As thou has sent me into the world, even
[1:14:49] so have I also sent them
[1:14:53] into the world. AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE
[1:14:55] AMONG THEM, AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE
[1:14:57] around you.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; And yet he says, don't partake of their
[1:15:02] deeds.
[1:15:03] Paul uses the word rudiments,
[1:15:06] PRINCIPALITIES, THINGS BY which they try
[1:15:10] to get effect on our lives.
[1:15:13] Notice he says
[1:15:16] again in VERSE 18, "AS THOU HAS SENT ME
[1:15:18] INTO THE WORLD, EVEN SO have I also sent
[1:15:22] them into the world." 1 Corinthians
[1:15:25] 2:12, PAUL SAYS, "NOW WE HAVE RECEIVED
[1:15:28] NOT [clears throat] the spirit of the
[1:15:30] world." So we're not just looking then
[1:15:32] that the world order is made up of a
[1:15:36] bunch of things.
[1:15:39] So what is your smartphone?
[1:15:42] A thing.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; What's your car? A thing.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; On and on and on we could go. But things
[1:15:50] alone
[1:15:52] don't necessarily captivate people's
[1:15:54] souls.
[1:15:56] It's the spirit of the world that will
[1:16:00] use
[1:16:02] a thing. Now remember, EVERYTHING THAT
[1:16:04] COMES OFF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD
[1:16:06] AND evil has a capability of being good
[1:16:10] or evil or both. Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; It could have been DESIGNED FOR A GOOD
[1:16:16] PURPOSE, BUT BECAUSE IT COMES from the
[1:16:18] tree of knowledge OF GOOD AND EVIL. YOU
[1:16:20] TAKE THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND PUT on the
[1:16:22] fruit OF THAT TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD
[1:16:25] AND EVIL AND GOD can use it for
[1:16:27] something of glory. Turn it right
[1:16:29] around. Let the spirit of the world COME
[1:16:31] UPON THE EXACT same thing. And that
[1:16:35] thing is only a thing. And it becomes a
[1:16:39] tool under the influence of the spirit
[1:16:42] of the world. Boy, I wish somebody would
[1:16:44] hear me today.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THIS MICROPHONE,
[1:16:47] THIS PULLPIT, THIS PIANO, THIS ORGAN, SO
[1:16:50] MANY THINGS. YOUR TONGUE.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; WOO. NOW, WE'RE GOING TO GET DOWN TO
[1:16:55] WHERE WE LIVE, AIN'T WE? YOUR TONGUE.
[1:16:58] YOUR TONGUE CAN BE A THING USED BY THE
[1:17:00] GLORY OF GOD FOR THE HONOR OF GOD. Or it
[1:17:03] can become an unruly EVIL SET ON FIRE OF
[1:17:07] HELL. LORD HAVE MERCY. AIN'T THAT WHAT
[1:17:10] THE BIBLE SAYS? A HUMAN TONGUE can be
[1:17:13] ONE OF THE WORST THINGS. MY THAT CAN
[1:17:15] DESTROY OUR LIFE. IT CAN DESTROY OUR
[1:17:18] CHURCH. IT CAN DESTROY A FAMILY. WHY?
[1:17:20] BECAUSE HELL ANOINTS THAT TONGUE AND
[1:17:24] SETS IT ON FIRE.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; NOW WE HAVE RECEIVED NOT THE spirit of
[1:17:36] the world but the spirit which is OF GOD
[1:17:40] THAT WE MIGHT know the things. This is
[1:17:44] it friends that we might know the things
[1:17:49] THAT ARE FREELY GIVEN TO US OF GOD. SO
[1:17:52] THERE ARE THINGS THAT GOD GIVES US. THEN
[1:17:56] IF GOD'S GOING TO give us things, GUESS
[1:17:59] WHAT SATAN'S GOING TO DO? Impersonate
[1:18:02] God. And he will have a twin thing that
[1:18:07] will look SIMILAR TO THE GOD THING THAT
[1:18:11] GOD GIVES YOU.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; And then you look at IT AND SAY, "WAIT A
[1:18:14] MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. IS
[1:18:15] THIS OF THE LORD? IS THIS OF THE DEVIL?
[1:18:17] I FEEL LED TO DO THIS. I HEARD A VOICE.
[1:18:19] I I HAD A DREAM. I SAW A VISION." YOU
[1:18:21] KNOW, THINGS THINGS. IT'S NOT JUST ALL
[1:18:24] THE TIME MATERIAL THINGS OF THE WORLD
[1:18:26] BUT GOD WILL GIVE TO US SPIRITUAL THINGS
[1:18:29] AND SATAN WILL PRODUCE A TWIN AND IT
[1:18:33] WILL BE ANOTHER THING THAT CAN LOOK SO I
[1:18:35] feel led to do this and I feel led to do
[1:18:38] that. WELL BROTHER THE WORD SAYS I KNOW
[1:18:40] I KNOW I KNOW BUT I FEEL led
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; them words override every scripture in
[1:18:45] the Bible.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; That's right
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; to a lot of people anyway.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord everybody. Okay, this
[1:18:53] morning,
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; brothers, keep you deacons, keep your
[1:18:58] phone there on hand. We might need to
[1:18:59] call the emergency squad.
[1:19:03] Some of us looking pretty puny today.
[1:19:08] Now, notice in Galatians 1:4,
[1:19:11] Paul says, "Who gave himself for our
[1:19:13] sins that he might deliver us
[1:19:18] from this?" I love this choice of words.
[1:19:23] Present
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; evil world,
[1:19:27] not future.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; He put a designation of time, brother
[1:19:33] Daryl. Present evil world. Let the devil
[1:19:37] do what he's going to do because his
[1:19:38] days ARE NUMBERED. THE COSMOS IS
[1:19:42] ORDERED. IT'S THE PRESENT EVIL WORLD,
[1:19:44] but it's not the future world that we're
[1:19:46] looking forward to. Amen. that he might
[1:19:49] deliver us from this present evil world
[1:19:52] according to the will of God and our
[1:19:55] father. GALATIANS 4:3 EVEN SO we when we
[1:20:00] were children were in bondage under the
[1:20:04] elements
[1:20:06] under the elements
[1:20:08] of the world and the elements of the
[1:20:11] world been used by the spirit of the
[1:20:14] world. WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY ENGULFED
[1:20:17] US INTO HABITS AND TO THINGS THAT BECOME
[1:20:21] addictions in life. AND THOSE ELEMENTS
[1:20:25] WERE SIMPLY LIFELESS. THINK OF WHAT
[1:20:28] PEOPLE MAKE GODS OUT OF AND IDOLS. THEY
[1:20:31] MAKE IDOLS AND GODS OUT OF THINGS THAT
[1:20:33] DON'T BREATHE. THINGS THAT CANNOT SAY
[1:20:36] BACK, "I LOVE YOU." THINK OF IT,
[1:20:39] CHILDREN. WE FILL OUR LIVES WITH ALL
[1:20:41] KINDS OF THINGS THAT DO NOT LIVE, DO NOT
[1:20:44] BREATHE, DO NOT MOVE, CANNOT LOVE. OH
[1:20:47] MY. MAY GOD HELP US THAT WE REALIZE
[1:20:51] JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS NOT SIN OF
[1:20:54] ITSELF, IT CAN BECOME SIN BECAUSE THE
[1:20:57] SPIRIT OF THE WORLD TAKES IT AND ENGULFS
[1:21:00] OUR SOULS with it.
[1:21:05] Oh, you see, SATAN'S TACTICS MUST BE
[1:21:08] TOTALLY different with the elect of God
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; than with the unconverted. It don't take
[1:21:14] much TO GET THEM. IT DON'T REALLY TAKE
[1:21:16] much to get a church member. It don't
[1:21:18] really take a whole lot to get somebody
[1:21:20] that really doesn't see the light that
[1:21:22] God has given us to walk in. But in that
[1:21:25] category, he must study meticulously and
[1:21:29] watch. In every age, he's redefined it
[1:21:32] according to the message of that day,
[1:21:33] he's done exactly the same thing in our
[1:21:36] age. Think about it. All these years
[1:21:38] that the prophet of God has been gone.
[1:21:40] Now, all the different things that have
[1:21:43] come and gone, all the different
[1:21:44] ministries and all the different
[1:21:46] ideologies and all the psychology and
[1:21:48] this and that and the other that's been
[1:21:50] around us and Satan constantly
[1:21:52] redefining redefining. I've seen it
[1:21:54] changed several different times, no
[1:21:57] longer than I've been in the message
[1:21:58] myself. AND YOU WATCH MOVES AND YOU
[1:22:00] WATCH THINGS AND HOW THEY RAISE UP. AND
[1:22:03] WHAT IS IT PEOPLE SAYING? WHAT'S A MOVE
[1:22:04] OF GOD? IT ALWAYS BREAKS MY HEART WHEN
[1:22:07] YOU SEE GOOD SINCERE PEOPLE ADJOINING
[1:22:09] their allegiance to something that they
[1:22:12] think is God. And yet in time it proves
[1:22:14] it was exactly wrong. And they wasted
[1:22:16] years of THEIR LIFE. THEY GAVE THEIR
[1:22:20] FAITHFULNESS TO SUPPORT THIS MAN. THEY
[1:22:22] GAVE THEIR HEART TO SUPPORT THIS CERTAIN
[1:22:24] MAN WHEN IN REALITY WASN'T EVEN WORTHY
[1:22:27] of them. HE WAS NOT EVEN WORTHY TO OH MY
[1:22:30] TO EVEN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GUIDE
[1:22:33] children of God.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Oh help us Lord. Even so we when we were
[1:22:40] children were in bondage of the under
[1:22:42] the elements of the world. EPHESIANS 2:2
[1:22:45] WHERE IN time past you walked according
[1:22:48] to the course.
[1:22:50] NOW WATCH HOW PAUL PICKS UP THE same
[1:22:53] terminology now. The world. The world.
[1:22:56] So they're preaching the way Jesus
[1:22:59] preached.
[1:23:01] It just overwhelms me that the preachers
[1:23:04] of this age don't preach against the
[1:23:06] world.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Is our faith been restored back to the
[1:23:11] original apostolic fathers?
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Then we ought to be preaching against
[1:23:15] what? The world.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; It's the Bible.
[1:23:20] WHERE IN TIME PAST YE WALKED ACCORDING
[1:23:22] TO THE course
[1:23:24] the course OF THIS WORLD WHICH WAS
[1:23:27] CHARTED OUT BY OUR NATURAL birth and the
[1:23:30] spirit of demons on that course of human
[1:23:33] life. So some one thing would appeal to
[1:23:36] them to others another thing would
[1:23:37] appeal TO US AND SATAN HAS SOMETHING FOR
[1:23:40] everybody and their appetite. You know
[1:23:43] what I'm talking about?
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Some of you no doubt oh my goodness
[1:23:47] you're not the Harley-Davidson Titan.
[1:23:49] Get on the back of a big hog going down
[1:23:51] the road with your arms up over like
[1:23:53] this. Your blood pressure 330 over 185
[1:23:56] and you're going down through there
[1:23:57] SITTING THERE BOPPING IT. HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:00] YOU might as well say hallelujah cuz
[1:24:02] you're worshiping the devil.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Others of you would say Lord have mercy.
[1:24:06] Look at that. OH MY MY MY. You're one of
[1:24:09] the other kind, aren't you? That sticks
[1:24:11] your finger out and puffs your little
[1:24:12] siggy. Yeah. You do it the fancy way and
[1:24:15] you go to the balls and this and that
[1:24:17] and the other. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR
[1:24:19] MAKEUP IS. THE DEVIL'S GOT SOMETHING FOR
[1:24:21] EVERY one of you. Come on, somebody.
[1:24:24] Let's have church today. And that WAS
[1:24:26] THE COURSE OF THE WORLD THAT WAS
[1:24:28] CHARTERED OUT FOR US. HALLELUJAH. BUT
[1:24:30] THE LORD JESUS COME DOWN WITH THE CRASH
[1:24:33] COURSE. AND HE BUSTED UP THAT COURSE
[1:24:36] THAT THE DEVIL HAD CHARTED FOR our life.
[1:24:38] And the devil LOOKED AT SOME OF US AND
[1:24:40] SAID, "THERE AIN'T NO WAY OUT. THERE
[1:24:42] AIN'T NO WAY OUT. THEIR MAMA done it.
[1:24:44] Their daddy done it. THEIR GRANDPA DONE
[1:24:46] IT. IT RUNS IN THAT FAMILY. EVERY ONE of
[1:24:49] them commits adultery. Every one OF THEM
[1:24:51] SMOKES. EVERY ONE OF THEM DONE THIS AND
[1:24:53] THAT AND the other. BUT JESUS SAID,
[1:24:54] "THIS ONE IS MINE, DEVIL. THIS ONE IS
[1:24:58] MINE." HALLELUJAH. EVEN THOUGH WE MAY
[1:25:01] HAVE WENT THAT WAY FOR A WHILE, BUT THE
[1:25:04] SPIRIT OF GOD COME RIGHT DOWN IN THE
[1:25:06] MIDDLE OF THAT COURSE AND SAID, "COME
[1:25:09] ON, HONEY. LEAVE THIS PLACE. GET OUT OF
[1:25:11] THIS WORLD. YOU BELONG TO ME.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; where in times past you walked according
[1:25:24] to the course of this world. Now listen
[1:25:26] what operated us
[1:25:29] according to the prince
[1:25:31] of the power of the air.
[1:25:37] the spirit
[1:25:39] that now workketh in the children
[1:25:43] of disobedience.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Notice Paul doesn't call them children
[1:25:47] of drunk, children of dope.
[1:25:52] The reason they do those is one simple
[1:25:54] fact, disobedience.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; It's one of two things, obedience or
[1:26:00] disobedience. Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; The spirit that now workketh in their
[1:26:05] children of disobedience, which used to
[1:26:07] work in us.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; So, how many of your parents sat you
[1:26:11] down when you got to be 2, three years
[1:26:12] old, four, something like that, and
[1:26:14] started teaching you how to lie?
[1:26:17] Now, today, honey, we're doing
[1:26:18] homeschool online,
[1:26:20] and mama's going to teach you how to be
[1:26:22] a good deceitful liar. And then your
[1:26:25] daddy come in that said, "Now, daddy's
[1:26:27] going to teach you how to run around on
[1:26:28] bombing."
[1:26:30] should have hit him upside the head of
[1:26:31] the number 10 frying band, WOULDN'T YOU?
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO TEACH THEM. THE COURSE
[1:26:37] WAS ALREADY CHARTERED FOR US,
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of the world just got
[1:26:43] right on us and we went right into it.
[1:26:47] Notice in this Ephesians chapter 2:3,
[1:26:50] Paul says, "Among whom also
[1:26:53] we all
[1:26:56] had our conversation in times past in
[1:26:59] the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the
[1:27:02] desires of the flesh and of the mind,
[1:27:05] and were by nature children of wrath,
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; even as others."
[1:27:12] But I want you to notice he doesn't say
[1:27:15] by seed.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; By nature, I was the children of wrath
[1:27:21] just like you were. Can the church say
[1:27:23] amen?
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; But by seed, I was a seed of God before
[1:27:27] the foundation of the world. ONLY THING
[1:27:29] GOD'S GOT TO DO IS LET THAT SEED
[1:27:31] override that nature I was born with and
[1:27:33] give me a new birth. And that changes my
[1:27:36] course forever.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, PRAISE THE LORD. NOW WATCH PAUL
[1:27:41] AGAIN IN [clears throat] Galatians 6:14
[1:27:43] as he talks about the crucifixion of THE
[1:27:47] WORLD. BUT GOD FORBID that I should
[1:27:49] glory saving the cross of our Lord JESUS
[1:27:51] CHRIST BY WHOM THE world is crucified
[1:27:55] unto me and I unto the world. So there's
[1:27:58] two crucifixions there. The world is
[1:28:01] crucified. So how does it do that? The
[1:28:03] believer will place the rudiments, the
[1:28:06] elements, the sin, QUESTIONABLE THINGS,
[1:28:09] AND THEY WILL PLACE THAT ON THE CROSS.
[1:28:11] AND THERE THE BELIEVER SAYS, "YOU ARE
[1:28:14] NOT A PART OF ME. THEREFORE, I CRUCIFY
[1:28:17] YOU." And then the BELIEVER WILL COME
[1:28:19] RIGHT BACK ON AND SAY, "AND I'LL ALSO
[1:28:21] CRUCIFY myself to the world." That the
[1:28:24] world is dead to me and I'm dead to the
[1:28:26] world. So therefore, there's no
[1:28:27] connection at all.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:28:32] Colossians 2:8, "Beware lest any man
[1:28:36] spoil you through philosophy."
[1:28:41] Wow.
[1:28:43] PHILOSOPHY. LOOK AT THE MEANING OF THE
[1:28:45] word love of wisdom
[1:28:48] used either of zeal or for skill in any
[1:28:53] art or science.
[1:28:57] DO YOU UNDERSTAND? IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL,
[1:29:00] THIS MESSAGE WILL BECOME PHILOSOPHICAL.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; It will become message philosophy
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; AND PREACHERS WILL BECOME MORE SKILLED
[1:29:11] and more trained and learn how to move a
[1:29:13] crowd and how to how to move our youth
[1:29:15] and how to move this and that and the
[1:29:17] other. They'll call it the anointing,
[1:29:19] but a lot of times it ain't nothing but
[1:29:20] emotion.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Well preach, brother Donnie.
[1:29:25] SO IT IT WAS ALREADY relevant in this
[1:29:28] first church age that there were men
[1:29:30] going around and using first century
[1:29:33] message philosophy
[1:29:36] and THEY WERE USING THIS PHILOSOPHY as
[1:29:38] Paul said beware lest any man spoil you
[1:29:42] spoil you through philosophy and vain
[1:29:46] deceit after the tradition of men after
[1:29:51] the rudiments
[1:29:52] of the world. SO THE THINGS OF THE
[1:29:55] WORLD, the principle, the primary, the
[1:29:57] arcade, the things which IS FIRST IN
[1:29:59] ORDER, THE RUDIMENTS OF THE world will
[1:30:02] be hidden under their philosophy and
[1:30:04] they would spoil many people. God help
[1:30:07] us Lord. Add to the rudiments of the
[1:30:10] world and not after Christ. Again,
[1:30:13] Colossians chapter 2:20. WHEREFORE IF
[1:30:16] YOU BE DEAD with Christ from the
[1:30:18] rudiments of the world, why as though
[1:30:21] living in the world are you subject to
[1:30:25] ordinances?
[1:30:27] AND YOU IMAGINE THAT AS THE NEW CHURCH
[1:30:29] begin to form now by the time Colossians
[1:30:32] is written, it's around 60 62 AD. SO THE
[1:30:35] CHURCH HAS already become established
[1:30:37] and NOW THE DEVIL IS DOING DIFFERENT
[1:30:39] TACTICS of trying to bring the world
[1:30:42] into the church. Initially they look
[1:30:44] different. They acted different as far
[1:30:46] as Jews. The Jewish men would have
[1:30:48] looked pretty much the same. Jewish
[1:30:50] women at that time wore dresses and all
[1:30:52] that sort of thing. Anyhow, uh so it
[1:30:54] wasn't just that part, BUT AS TIME WENT
[1:30:56] ON, they begin to change and they begin
[1:30:59] to work on it and SATAN TOOK THE VERY
[1:31:02] MESSAGE of the hour. You imagine with
[1:31:04] some of the men that were there, they
[1:31:06] were preaching that the resurrection had
[1:31:09] already passed. And these men were
[1:31:12] former followers of St. PAUL. WHAT WERE
[1:31:15] THEY USING? No doubt his quotes.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; So they were breaking INTO THE QUOTES
[1:31:21] AND PUTTING IT TOGETHER and twisting up
[1:31:24] the minds OF THE PEOPLE SAYING the
[1:31:26] resurrection has already passed. There
[1:31:28] is no raising from the dead. AND THEN
[1:31:30] THEY STARTED PREACHING PURELY THE GRACE
[1:31:33] OF God which the Bible warns us in the
[1:31:35] last days would be a return OF THAT
[1:31:37] SPIRIT. AND THEY WOULD TRY they would
[1:31:39] change the grace of God into
[1:31:41] lasciviousness.
[1:31:43] SO THEY WOULD PREACH GRACE WOULD COVER
[1:31:46] everything so you can live any way you
[1:31:48] want to live. Yeah. Sounds like modern
[1:31:50] day to me.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Oh my. BUT WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO AS
[1:31:56] BELIEVERS?
[1:31:58] MATTHEW CHAPTER 5 verse1 14 JESUS SAYS
[1:32:02] YE ARE THE LIGHT OF the world
[1:32:05] a city that is set on a hill cannot be
[1:32:10] hid. PHILIPPIANS 2:14 DO ALL THINGS
[1:32:14] WITHOUT MURMURINGS and disputings.
[1:32:18] Help us Jesus.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Help us Jesus.
[1:32:25] Now, for those people who say they have
[1:32:27] left the message, does that mean they're
[1:32:29] also leaving all these scriptures that
[1:32:31] message preachers use?
[1:32:36] Cuz I'm preaching to you today the
[1:32:38] message of the hour, which comes from
[1:32:40] the Bible.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; So, when people are leaving the message,
[1:32:42] I guess that means they're leaving all
[1:32:44] these scriptures, too, right?
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; I thought that was a good one myself. I
[1:32:51] I'm just saying now.
[1:32:53] NOTICE IN VERSE 15 HE SAYS VERSE 14 DO
[1:32:57] ALL THINGS WITHOUT murmurings and
[1:32:59] disputations DISPUTINGS RATHER THAT YOU
[1:33:02] MAY BE BLAMELESS.
[1:33:05] Wow
[1:33:07] and harmless.
[1:33:10] This is one true way to differentiate a
[1:33:13] person who has the Holy Ghost to one who
[1:33:14] does not.
[1:33:16] Anyone
[1:33:18] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:20] Ghost and every fiber of their being is
[1:33:22] filled with the spirit of God,
[1:33:25] they are harmless when it comes to
[1:33:28] trying to destroy people.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; According to your Bible,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; does that matter to anybody?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought it would. Look at what
[1:33:39] harmless means. Unmixed, pure as in
[1:33:43] wines or metals. was out a mixture
[1:33:49] of evil, free from guile.
[1:33:53] Innocent.
[1:33:56] Innocent.
[1:33:58] THAT YE MAY BE BLAMELESS,
[1:34:01] HARMLESS,
[1:34:03] THE SONS OF GOD without
[1:34:07] rebuke.
[1:34:09] Praise God.
[1:34:11] And the word rebuke means blameless
[1:34:14] that cannot be censured.
[1:34:19] So you see then a troublemaker
[1:34:22] cannot fulfill this scripture.
[1:34:29] So, kind of makes you wonder down in
[1:34:31] hell
[1:34:33] when jobs are being assigned out from
[1:34:36] the main man down there
[1:34:38] and them demons are called together for
[1:34:41] an annual demonic convention
[1:34:45] and their meeting day must be on Monday.
[1:34:49] I'm just saying.
[1:34:53] SO THEY ALL COME IN AND THEY REPORT FOR
[1:34:55] DUTY
[1:34:58] AND SATAN SAYING, "ALL RIGHT, I WANT I
[1:35:00] WANT SOME GOSSIP devils to go up there
[1:35:01] and attack Word of Life.
[1:35:05] I want some Facebook devils to go up
[1:35:07] there.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; I WANT THIS DEVIL, THAT DEVIL, THAT
[1:35:12] DEVIL."
[1:35:15] Wouldn't it be absolutely a horrible
[1:35:17] testimony to have down in hell that
[1:35:21] demons would call our name specifically
[1:35:24] and say, "Let me go. Please, please,
[1:35:27] please let me go. Let me go." I love
[1:35:30] using him. I love using her. She gets so
[1:35:34] dramatic.
[1:35:35] I mean, he gets so much drama. Oh, I
[1:35:39] whenever they get that that that their
[1:35:41] phone in their hand or they get their
[1:35:42] laptop, you know, in their hand or their
[1:35:44] keyboard, I mean, I move on them and I
[1:35:47] give them such an anointing and words
[1:35:49] are pouring out of them and they
[1:35:51] actually are astounded themselves cuz
[1:35:53] they're dumb as a doornob. They don't
[1:35:55] even realize all them words is coming
[1:35:57] from me. They don't realize all them
[1:36:00] words and they're throwing them at this
[1:36:02] person and that person and throwing off
[1:36:04] on this and that and the other. Come on,
[1:36:06] church. Wouldn't you hate it if any
[1:36:08] devil down in hell said, "Let me go,
[1:36:11] Satan. Let me go." I'll tell you one
[1:36:13] thing. I want to be the TYPE OF
[1:36:15] CHRISTIAN THAT WHEN THE DEVIL GOES to a
[1:36:17] sign of demons up my way that they all
[1:36:20] cry. I mean, a lot of red eating onions.
[1:36:23] THEY SAT AROUND in tears coming out of
[1:36:25] their eyes and no devil. No. Please
[1:36:28] don't make me go up there. YOU DON'T
[1:36:30] KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE ATTACKING THAT DONNY
[1:36:32] REAGAN. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
[1:36:34] ATTACKING DARYL WARD. I DON'T WANT IT
[1:36:36] JUST TO BE SAID ABOUT THE PREACHERS.
[1:36:38] DON'T YOU WANT IT SAID ABOUT YOU THAT
[1:36:40] THEM DEMONS DOWN IN HELL SAY, "OH NO, I
[1:36:44] DON'T WANT TO GET AROUND HER." SHE
[1:36:45] REBUKES ME. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. I
[1:36:48] GO TO PUTTING THEM THOUGHTS IN HER MIND.
[1:36:50] NOBODY LOVES HER. AND SHE'S SHARP WITH
[1:36:52] THAT WORD. SHE'LL COME RIGHT BACK AND
[1:36:54] SAY, "DEVIL, YOU'RE A LIAR. THE PASTOR
[1:36:56] LOVES ME. JESUS LOVES ME. THE CHURCH
[1:36:59] LOVES ME. GET OUT OF HERE. I FEEL SORRY
[1:37:02] FOR MYSELF SPIRIT. DEVIL, YOU DON'T KNOW
[1:37:04] WHAT IT'S LIKE. [applause]
[1:37:07] BUT WHAT A TERRIBLE THING FOR SATAN TO
[1:37:10] LOVE PEOPLE SO MUCH THAT ARE CHRISTIANS.
[1:37:20] And Satan can say, "They are my favorite
[1:37:24] tools.
[1:37:26] I'd much rather use them than a
[1:37:27] prostitute."
[1:37:29] Yeah.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; How much success you figure a prostitute
[1:37:35] would have in our church.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; So if some drunk come off the street
[1:37:40] back there and sit down, the devil said,
[1:37:43] "I want some drunk to go in there and
[1:37:44] disrupt service." He might get in a
[1:37:47] couple of words. Our deacons would nail
[1:37:49] his high and have him packed out of here
[1:37:50] before he got the third word out.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; The devil knows better than to use
[1:37:55] certain things that would never affect
[1:37:56] us. Amen.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; And yet our message churches are filled
[1:38:04] with women with long hair and long
[1:38:06] dresses and men with neck ties and this
[1:38:11] and that and some of the worst message
[1:38:12] people I've dealt with in my life. Their
[1:38:15] sins and their issues are from their
[1:38:18] heart.
[1:38:20] Looking at them on the outside, they
[1:38:22] match the criterion
[1:38:25] perfectly
[1:38:27] and rotten to the core.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; God have mercy on us.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more minutes?
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; You're just asking for trouble, ain't
[1:38:39] you?
[1:38:42] that you may be blameless
[1:38:45] and harmless,
[1:38:47] the sons of God, without rebuke in the
[1:38:51] midst of a crooked and perverse.
[1:38:56] Look at the word perverse. Turn away to
[1:39:00] distort,
[1:39:01] turn aside, oppose, plot against the
[1:39:05] saving purposes and plans of God to turn
[1:39:11] aside from the right paths to pervert
[1:39:15] or corrupt,
[1:39:17] that you be without rebuke in a crooked
[1:39:21] and perverse nation, among whom ye shine
[1:39:25] as lights
[1:39:28] in the world.
[1:39:31] Godliness
[1:39:33] and any of us still wants it. Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Now notice Paul in Titus 2:12 says,
[1:39:40] teaching us that denying ungodliness
[1:39:45] and worldly lusts,
[1:39:48] we should live soberly,
[1:39:51] righteously,
[1:39:53] godly
[1:39:55] in this present
[1:39:57] world.
[1:39:59] SO THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT SATAN SAYS. AND
[1:40:01] REMEMBER, ALL OF THAT IS NOT unprofessed
[1:40:03] Christianity.
[1:40:05] Some of the worst ones
[1:40:07] are Christians.
[1:40:10] Again, second Peter chapter 1:4,
[1:40:12] "Whereby given unto us exceeding great
[1:40:14] and precious promises, that by these you
[1:40:16] might be partakers of the divine nature,
[1:40:19] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:40:21] the world through lust." Second Peter
[1:40:24] 2:20. For if after they have escaped
[1:40:29] the pollutions
[1:40:31] of the WORLD THROUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF
[1:40:33] THE LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST, THEY
[1:40:36] ARE AGAIN ENTANGLED therein and
[1:40:39] overcome.
[1:40:41] The latter end is worse with them
[1:40:45] than the beginning.
[1:40:49] Look at the word pollutions.
[1:40:52] things that infect, pollute and defile.
[1:40:55] It is you still today of the contagion
[1:40:58] of dangerous diseases
[1:41:02] and of decaying bodies, stagnated water,
[1:41:06] putrid matter. The world is here
[1:41:08] pictured as putrid and full of contagion
[1:41:12] of sin
[1:41:14] and uncleanness. NOW YOUR PETER IS
[1:41:16] ADDRESSING BECAUSE by now there's
[1:41:19] already been people WHO HAD ACCEPTED THE
[1:41:21] GOSPEL MESSAGE AND AFTER they ran it for
[1:41:23] a while they decided I don't want this
[1:41:26] anymore.
[1:41:29] Now watch how Peter frames
[1:41:31] what will happen to those
[1:41:34] if they have escaped THE POLLUTIONS OF
[1:41:36] THE WORLD. THINK WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.
[1:41:39] BROTHER D. THEY MUST HAVE HAD A GREAT
[1:41:40] TESTIMONY. I GOT OUT. I ESCAPED LUST. I
[1:41:45] ESCAPED THIS. I ESCAPED THAT. GOD SET ME
[1:41:48] FREE. I GOT OUT. PRAISE GOD. I GOT OUT.
[1:41:51] AND THE CHURCH REJOICE WITH THEM. PRAISE
[1:41:53] GOD. ANOTHER ONE HAS BEEN SET FREE.
[1:42:01] But he says, "If they are again
[1:42:03] entangled
[1:42:07] therein and [clears throat] overcome,
[1:42:11] the latter end is worse with them than
[1:42:14] the beginning." I want you to listen to
[1:42:15] this next verse. It had been better for
[1:42:18] them
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; not to have known the way of
[1:42:23] righteousness
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; than after they have known it to turn
[1:42:28] from the holy commandment
[1:42:31] delivered unto them. Do you mean that it
[1:42:33] WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THEM to have
[1:42:35] stayed a sinner?
[1:42:38] THEY'VE BEEN BETTER OFF TO REMAIN A
[1:42:40] drunk
[1:42:42] instead of coming to a PORTION OF TRUTH
[1:42:45] AND BE DELIVERED FROM ALCOHOL AND
[1:42:47] DELIVERED FROM SMOKING OR WHATEVER VICES
[1:42:49] AND WHATEVER MORE THAT THEY DID. AND
[1:42:50] THEN AFTER THEY DO THAT, THEY TURN AND
[1:42:52] GO BACK. THEY WOULD HAVE been better off
[1:42:55] to been left there.
[1:42:58] DON'T YOU SEE WHAT EXPOSURE TO LIGHT
[1:43:01] DOES TO US?
[1:43:05] Now hopefully you understand, those of
[1:43:07] you that study your scripture know that
[1:43:09] by the word better that Peter uses to
[1:43:13] describe it, he's actually using a word
[1:43:15] that would differentiate between two
[1:43:18] levels of evil.
[1:43:20] So it would have been a lesser evil to
[1:43:24] remain a SINNER AND STOOD BEFORE God as
[1:43:27] a sinner
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; than it would have been a person that
[1:43:30] knew the truth, said in the truth, glory
[1:43:31] to God. Thank you, Lord, for this truth.
[1:43:33] And then after they left it, they turn
[1:43:35] and walk away and go to blasting that
[1:43:37] truth. It would have been better for
[1:43:39] them had they never even heard it.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Dear God,
[1:43:48] better to have never known
[1:43:52] than once THEY HAVE KNOWN IT TO TURN AND
[1:43:54] WALK BACK THEN THEY BECOME ENGULFED
[1:43:57] AGAIN BY THE sins that they were in. and
[1:44:00] actually worse. Notice Jesus catches
[1:44:03] this same thought in John 9:40. And some
[1:44:05] of the Pharisees which were with him
[1:44:07] heard these words, and they said unto
[1:44:08] him, "ARE WE BLIND ALSO?" Jesus said
[1:44:12] UNTO THEM, "IF YE WERE BLIND,
[1:44:15] you should have no sin."
[1:44:19] Which proves that some of those men that
[1:44:21] were there that day saw and knew
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; who he was.
[1:44:28] Amen.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Had they been blind, the mercy of God
[1:44:32] would have understood that. But they
[1:44:35] knew who it was,
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; and they simply denied it. But now you
[1:44:40] say we see, therefore, your sin
[1:44:43] remainth. St. John 19:10. THEN SAYEST
[1:44:46] PILATE unto him, Speakst thou not unto
[1:44:48] me? Knowest thou not, I have power to
[1:44:51] crucify thee, and have power to release
[1:44:54] thee? Jesus answered, "Thou couldest
[1:44:56] have no power at all against me, except
[1:45:00] it were given thee from above.
[1:45:02] THEREFORE, HE that delivered me unto
[1:45:06] thee hath the greater
[1:45:10] sin."
[1:45:12] I know people say it. I've heard it my
[1:45:14] WHOLE LIFE. ALL SINS ON THE SAME LEVEL.
[1:45:17] YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR BIBLE.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Come on. ACCORDING TO THE MASTER who
[1:45:21] will judge sin, there are some sins
[1:45:24] greater
[1:45:26] than others.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; NOW YOU IMAGINE EVEN THOUGH THE JEWS at
[1:45:32] that time was not the ones who nailed
[1:45:34] him to the cross, but they were the ones
[1:45:37] that delivered him and Judas the one who
[1:45:39] DELIVERED HIM AND PONTIUS PILATE WAS THE
[1:45:42] ONE THAT SIGNED THE DOCUMENT THAT sent
[1:45:44] him to the cross. But Jesus said, "Those
[1:45:47] that delivered me unto you have
[1:45:49] committed the greater sin."
[1:45:53] Oh, help us, Lord.
[1:45:58] MATTHEW 10:14, "AND WHOSOEVER SHALL NOT
[1:46:00] RECEIVE you or hear your words when you
[1:46:03] depart out of that house or city, shake
[1:46:06] off the dust off of your feet. Verily I
[1:46:09] say unto you, it shall be more tolerable
[1:46:13] for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in
[1:46:16] the day of judgment than for that city.
[1:46:19] So you imagine God sends a servant of
[1:46:21] God to a city to preach the word.
[1:46:25] And the people turn him down and refuse
[1:46:27] him. And at the day of judgment,
[1:46:30] perverts
[1:46:32] out of Sodom,
[1:46:34] it'll be more tolerable for them than it
[1:46:38] will be for some of those church
[1:46:39] members.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; THESE ARE THE WORDS OF JESUS, FRIENDS.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; MATTHEW 11:21, "WOE UNTO THEE, CURASAN.
[1:46:51] WOE UNTO THEE, BASADIA.
[1:46:53] For if the mighty works which were done
[1:46:56] in you have done in Ty and Siden,
[1:47:00] they would have repented long ago in
[1:47:02] sackcloth and ashes.
[1:47:05] But I say UNTO YOU, IT SHALL be more
[1:47:07] tolerable for Ty and Siden at the day of
[1:47:11] judgment than for you.
[1:47:15] And you look and read the story of the
[1:47:17] four gospels and Jesus didn't hardly do
[1:47:20] any miracles
[1:47:22] in these cities
[1:47:25] compared to Capernaum
[1:47:27] and Jerusalem.
[1:47:30] DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THOSE WHO ARE
[1:47:32] TURNING AGAINST THIS WORD,
[1:47:35] THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND AND SEEN AND HEARD
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; MORE miracles that's WRITTEN IN THE
[1:47:42] ENTIRE BOOK OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.
[1:47:46] JESUS DID NOT SAY THE WORDS YOU HEARD.
[1:47:48] HE DID NOT SAY THE DOCTRINES THAT YOU
[1:47:50] HEARD ME PREACH, BUT the works
[1:47:54] that you saw me do.
[1:47:58] I know it staggers people and blows them
[1:48:00] away, but I'm going to say it anyhow.
[1:48:02] The prophet of God said, "I've seen him
[1:48:04] do more in my ministry than he done in
[1:48:06] his own on the earth."
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; And if you read the Bible and listen to
[1:48:10] the message much, you know that's exact
[1:48:11] the truth.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Brother Bam didn't do
[1:48:15] that. IT WAS JESUS. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
[1:48:16] WHO THEY'RE TURNING DOWN. [screaming]
[1:48:18] IT'S THE LORD. YOU IMAGINE LITTLE GOSPEL
[1:48:20] PREACHERS GOING OUT SOMEWHERE. HOW MANY
[1:48:23] CITIES HAS BROTHER BENTON WENT TO? HOW
[1:48:25] MANY MILES HAS HE FLOWN AND TRAVELED AND
[1:48:28] WALK and canoe AND THIS AND THAT AND THE
[1:48:30] OTHER? AND PEOPLE GO BY HEAR HIM SING.
[1:48:33] HE PLAYS A LITTLE GUITAR AND PREACH AND
[1:48:35] LAUGH AND MAKE FUN AND THEY ALL STAND
[1:48:37] BEFORE GOD THAT DAY NOT KNOWING ALMIGHTY
[1:48:40] GOD SENT A MAN WITH A MESSAGE OF
[1:48:43] DELIVERANCE. AND THEY THOUGHT, "OH, IT'S
[1:48:45] JUST A SOME PREACHER FROM AMERICA." NO,
[1:48:47] IT'S MORE THAN A PREACHER FROM AMERICA.
[1:48:50] IT'S A MAN SENT FROM THE PRESENCE OF GOD
[1:48:53] WITH THE ANOINTING OF THE HOLY
[1:48:55] [screaming] GHOST. YOU'RE NOT TURNING
[1:48:57] DOWN ME, FRIENDS. YOU'RE NOT TURNING
[1:48:59] DOWN WILLIAM BRANDOM. IT'S NOT THAT THEY
[1:49:02] TURNED DOWN PAUL. YOU'RE TURNING DOWN
[1:49:04] JESUS CHRIST. YOU'RE TURNING DOWN HIS
[1:49:07] WORD. DON'T TURN HIM DOWN. [applause]
[1:49:13] OH, GOD.
[1:49:21] And thou, Capernium,
[1:49:24] which art exalted into heaven,
[1:49:27] shall be brought down to hell.
[1:49:31] For the mighty works, not words, NOT
[1:49:34] DOCTRINE, NOT THEOLOGY, works
[1:49:40] which had been done in thee,
[1:49:43] had been done in Sodom, it would have
[1:49:46] remained
[1:49:48] until this day.
[1:49:51] You imagine the discernment, the
[1:49:53] healing, the miracles.
[1:49:55] Had that been done in Sodom, it would
[1:49:58] have changed a bunch of perverts.
[1:50:00] AND JESUS WOULD COMPARE CAPERNIUM. CAROL
[1:50:05] AND I STOOD THERE SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND
[1:50:06] YOU'VE GOT TO DIG DOWN 20OME FEET
[1:50:10] TO FIND THE FOUNDATION OF THAT TEMPLE
[1:50:12] THAT JESUS OR THAT SYNAGOGUE THAT JESUS
[1:50:15] STOOD IN AND SAID THESE WORDS.
[1:50:18] ONE CONQUEROR TO ANOTHER ANNIHILATED
[1:50:21] THEM.
[1:50:22] Oh God,
[1:50:25] could you see children what awaits our
[1:50:28] nation
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; and our world?
[1:50:33] Let's not be identified in the judgment
[1:50:37] that's going to come on our nation
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; cuz she has rejected Jesus Christ. And
[1:50:44] here's the message.
[1:50:49] [panting]
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; For if the mighty works which had been
[1:50:54] done in thee had been done in Sodom, it
[1:50:56] would have remained to this day. But I
[1:50:58] say unto you that it shall be more
[1:51:00] tolerable for the land of Sodom in the
[1:51:03] day of judgment than for thee.
[1:51:07] And Paul says it this way. Hebrews 6:4,
[1:51:09] "For it is impossible for those who were
[1:51:12] once enlightened
[1:51:15] and have tasted of the heavenly gift and
[1:51:18] were made partakers
[1:51:21] of the Holy Ghost." You see, these
[1:51:23] people that are now being warned
[1:51:26] have enjoyed high spiritual
[1:51:30] privileges.
[1:51:32] First, THEY WERE ENLIGHTENED.
[1:51:35] SO they were illuminated to certain
[1:51:37] truths of God. They'd come into a light
[1:51:41] of the day, no doubt, regarding the
[1:51:44] gospel.
[1:51:46] Secondly, they had enjoyment.
[1:51:49] THEY tasted it.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; THEY ACTUALLY TASTED, "OH, THAT IS SO
[1:51:54] GOOD. THAT IS SO WONDERFUL. THAT IS SO
[1:51:56] AWESOME." THEY THEY DIDN'T JUST I TASTE
[1:51:59] OFF. I HATE THAT STUFF. NO, THEY ENJOYED
[1:52:03] IT. THEY, OH, THIS IS SO GOOD. THIS IS
[1:52:05] SO GOOD. OH MY. FIVE YEARS LATER, 10
[1:52:08] YEARS LATER, 15, OH YEAH, THIS IS SO
[1:52:10] WONDERFUL. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
[1:52:12] something happens to THEM AND THEY SAY,
[1:52:13] I HATE THAT WORD. I HATE THAT MESSAGE. I
[1:52:16] HATE I HATE WHAT HAPPENED.
[1:52:20] They lost their enjoyment
[1:52:22] of the taste.
[1:52:25] If you're sitting here today and you're
[1:52:26] feeling that pull on your heart against
[1:52:28] the word of God, you better listen
[1:52:30] carefully to the gospel. Don't make me
[1:52:32] stand before you at the day of judgment
[1:52:35] and condemn you.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Don't make me and the rest of these
[1:52:40] preachers have to stand there. AND GOD
[1:52:42] SAID, "WHO TOLD THEM THE TRUTH?"
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; And I'll have to STAND THERE. BROTHER
[1:52:49] DARYL HAVE TO STAND THERE. THE OTHER
[1:52:51] BROTHERS IN OUR CHURCH, YOUTH LEADERS,
[1:52:52] SO ON AND SO ON. LORD GOD, we did. We
[1:52:55] stood there. WE TOLD THEM. WE TOLD THEM.
[1:52:56] AND GOD SHOWS IT ON THE SCREEN. YEP.
[1:52:59] There it was.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:53:02] Amen.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Oh God, children.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; You see, they also
[1:53:15] they also enjoyed the heavenly gift.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; They ptook of the heavenly gift and they
[1:53:21] taste it and said, "Oh, this is so good.
[1:53:23] It's changed my life. It's made me so
[1:53:26] different. Oh, this is so good." And
[1:53:27] they were just eating and eating and oh
[1:53:29] my, this is so awesome.
[1:53:33] And they even was allowed to partake of
[1:53:35] the powers of the world that is to come.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand what your portion
[1:53:42] of the Holy Ghost is? It will be yours
[1:53:44] in eternity.
[1:53:46] And when people are TAKING OF THE HOLY
[1:53:49] GHOST, THEY'RE TASTING AND they're
[1:53:51] enjoying a little taste of the world
[1:53:54] that's fixing to come.
[1:53:57] Paul says in verse 5, "And have tasted
[1:53:58] the good word of God and the powers of
[1:54:02] the world to come,
[1:54:05] IF THEY SHALL FALL AWAY TO RENEW THEM
[1:54:08] again unto repentance,
[1:54:10] seeing they crucify themselves the Son
[1:54:14] of God,
[1:54:15] Aresh,
[1:54:18] and put him to [sighs] an open shame."
[1:54:25] the height of ungodliness.
[1:54:28] It's not a drunk. It's not the
[1:54:31] prostitute that knows she's going to
[1:54:32] hell.
[1:54:34] It's religious people that once again
[1:54:37] are crucifying
[1:54:39] the Lord Jesus.
[1:54:42] And he is the word. Oh, most of
[1:54:45] Christianity today, no, they wouldn't
[1:54:46] never. Oh, I'd never do that. I'd never
[1:54:48] do that. Tell me what you do with his
[1:54:50] word and I'll tell you whether you're
[1:54:51] doing it or not.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He is the word. You believe
[1:54:56] Hebrews 13:8?
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday and forever.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; So, does that mean a corporal body here
[1:55:01] on the earth?
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; You see Hebrews 13:8, a corporal body on
[1:55:06] the earth? No. Not his own body. He's
[1:55:10] the same yesterday and forever. How is
[1:55:12] he? His presence and his word and his
[1:55:15] word made flesh in his feminist
[1:55:18] counterpart.
[1:55:21] So Jesus says, "When they receive you,
[1:55:23] they receive me. And when they reject
[1:55:26] you,
[1:55:28] I don't mind telling you, friend,
[1:55:29] there's cities I've left before. And
[1:55:31] when I flew out, as I board the plane,
[1:55:35] I'd shake the dust off my feet. THERE'S
[1:55:38] CHURCHES I'VE WALKED OUT OF.
[1:55:41] AND BEFORE I get in my vehicle, I'll
[1:55:43] shake the dust off my feet. Not because
[1:55:44] they REJECTED ME. NOT BECAUSE THEY
[1:55:47] REJECT BROTHER JACKIE OR BROTHER D.
[1:55:48] because they reject him
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; his word. When God will speak to them,
[1:55:57] oh Lord,
[1:56:06] Hebrews 10:26, for if we sin willfully
[1:56:10] after that we've received the knowledge
[1:56:11] of the truth,
[1:56:13] there remainth no more sacrifice
[1:56:16] for sins.
[1:56:18] But brother Donnie, I I backslid and I I
[1:56:20] I got away from the Lord. Does that mean
[1:56:23] I can't come back? You want to?
[1:56:26] You want to come back?
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Well, if you do, you can come back.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THOSE WHO REACH THIS SPOT will
[1:56:34] never. They have such disdain and such
[1:56:39] hatred.
[1:56:41] I feel so sorry for them
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; cuz they think they're free.
[1:56:49] But if we would have spiritual glasses
[1:56:51] to look at the chains that's around
[1:56:53] their souls.
[1:56:56] I've seen demons a few times and I don't
[1:56:58] mind telling you I don't like seeing
[1:56:59] them. I don't want nothing to do with
[1:57:01] them. I sure don't want them motivating
[1:57:03] me.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; I sure don't want them making me hateful
[1:57:07] and contrary. That's why some of these
[1:57:09] folks who've left the message, friends,
[1:57:11] their behavior, their personality, their
[1:57:14] mannerisms has changed.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; They've taken on a demon.
[1:57:24] You imagine how alarmed the wife of
[1:57:27] Capus must have been, the wife of the
[1:57:31] religious leaders of the day and their
[1:57:33] children
[1:57:35] because before Jesus came on the earth,
[1:57:37] they were some of the nicest people
[1:57:39] you'd ever want to be around.
[1:57:41] But after they denied the Lord Jesus,
[1:57:44] them demons, come on, them them guys,
[1:57:47] brother Daryl, it must have been awful
[1:57:49] trying to live with them people.
[1:57:52] Why they turn down the word?
[1:57:58] Let's bow our
[1:58:04] [sighs]
[1:58:09] dear God.
[1:58:13] Lord, in one way, we're living in an
[1:58:15] awful time.
[1:58:18] The darkness is moving
[1:58:21] in so rapidly.
[1:58:25] Lord, we're rubbing shoulders with
[1:58:27] repbates
[1:58:30] who have believed a lie
[1:58:34] and will be damned by it.
[1:58:37] We're rubbing shoulders with souls
[1:58:40] that are in prison now.
[1:58:44] And as the angels who left their first
[1:58:45] estate,
[1:58:48] those angels are reserved in everlasting
[1:58:52] chains of darkness. And we've been
[1:58:54] looking at it on Wednesday nights
[1:58:58] how that those demons look for rest
[1:59:03] and they can't find it.
[1:59:05] I've sat and thought about it over the
[1:59:07] years.
[1:59:10] What a nost they had in the paradise of
[1:59:13] God.
[1:59:15] Perfect peace, joy, happiness.
[1:59:20] And yet they left their first estate
[1:59:24] and decided to join ranks with Lucifer,
[1:59:29] the great archangel.
[1:59:32] No doubt it didn't take a month or
[1:59:35] six weeks.
[1:59:38] But when they made up their mind that
[1:59:40] instant
[1:59:42] their natures changed,
[1:59:46] something happened within them.
[1:59:49] And they started looking through the
[1:59:50] same spirit eyes, whatever it is they
[1:59:53] see with.
[1:59:55] And before all they saw was beauty and
[1:59:59] holiness and righteousness and purity,
[2:00:02] all things lovely, all things divine.
[2:00:06] And now they looked and everything
[2:00:09] seemed
[2:00:11] contrarian and hateful
[2:00:16] and they had hate and
[2:00:19] despised one another.
[2:00:22] And the prophet has told us them demons
[2:00:24] can't even get along with one another.
[2:00:26] So they come from a perfect harmony and
[2:00:29] a perfect union in heaven.
[2:00:32] And once they left that
[2:00:35] for thousands of years, how many ever
[2:00:38] years this has been going on since they
[2:00:40] fell because the prophet told us they
[2:00:41] fell before the foundation of the world.
[2:00:43] So maybe hundreds of thousands of years
[2:00:45] the way we'd measure time. They've been
[2:00:48] arguing, fussing, fighting, debating.
[2:00:53] Not one minute of peace down in hell.
[2:00:58] So they hate one another and they hate
[2:01:01] their master
[2:01:03] and they hate God
[2:01:05] and they hate us.
[2:01:08] And the prophet said even about the
[2:01:10] devil
[2:01:12] that he can't love.
[2:01:15] And being one of your created beings in
[2:01:18] the beginning, no doubt he was created
[2:01:20] to love.
[2:01:22] And he w must have walked in a sphere
[2:01:26] of love that would have been phenomenal
[2:01:29] in the way that we would look at it as
[2:01:31] mortals. He didn't have to struggle.
[2:01:35] He didn't have to fight
[2:01:38] to love the way we do, but he was just
[2:01:42] created in it.
[2:01:44] And then when sin began in his heart
[2:01:46] when he said I will
[2:01:51] all of a sudden he experienced hate
[2:01:55] variant strife.
[2:01:58] So he looks at his own subjects today
[2:02:00] and hates every one of them.
[2:02:04] Those that he's already took to the
[2:02:06] regions of the lost.
[2:02:09] He despises them all.
[2:02:13] Millions are already in his domain.
[2:02:16] Oh, we know Lord, he's not just trying
[2:02:18] to torment a person here 18 years or 60
[2:02:22] years or 70 or 80,
[2:02:25] but he wants to take them into the abyss
[2:02:29] in the regions of the lost
[2:02:32] where there they scream, they cry,
[2:02:37] they fall into that regions. when the
[2:02:40] prophet was allowed to go into that
[2:02:43] place before his conversion
[2:02:47] and he was falling falling falling in
[2:02:50] that darkness.
[2:02:52] Scream for daddy but no daddy there.
[2:02:54] Scream for mama but no mama there.
[2:02:56] Scream for God but there was no God
[2:02:59] there.
[2:03:02] And he said, "A burning fire would have
[2:03:05] been a pleasure,"
[2:03:08] which is more than our minds can
[2:03:10] comprehend. Most of us that have been
[2:03:12] burned by fire before know how painful
[2:03:14] that is. And yet what he experienced was
[2:03:17] so much worse.
[2:03:20] Oh Jesus, hide me, Lord.
[2:03:24] Hide me.
[2:03:27] Hide these people. Father,
[2:03:31] we can't do this on our own. This battle
[2:03:33] is greater than us.
[2:03:35] These demons that I fight, these demons
[2:03:38] that these people fight are professional
[2:03:41] warriors, as we would say. They're the
[2:03:44] same ones that fought against Noah in
[2:03:47] his day. They're the same ones that
[2:03:49] fought against Abraham in his day, the
[2:03:52] children of Israel. on down on down.
[2:03:56] In comparison to ability and years of
[2:03:59] experience,
[2:04:01] they would definitely be more equipped
[2:04:04] than we are. And you knew that. But you
[2:04:08] had your inspired author to write,
[2:04:10] "Greater is he that is in you than he
[2:04:15] that is in the world."
[2:04:18] So with you and us, we are more than a
[2:04:21] match for every devil out of hell.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; So Father, we don't walk out of here
[2:04:27] today terrified and scared, but we march
[2:04:30] out of here as an army of God, called by
[2:04:34] the most high, given everything we need
[2:04:37] to meet the challenge of this hour. And
[2:04:41] we will not come out of here and barely
[2:04:43] hang on and receive a t-shirt. As I've
[2:04:45] said it for years and years that I
[2:04:47] overcome Leodysia, we're not going to
[2:04:49] barely make it. We're more than
[2:04:51] conquerors.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:04:56] Father, may you minister to every heart
[2:04:58] here today, Lord.
[2:05:00] I pray, dear God, if there's some that's
[2:05:03] kind of weighed in the balance and
[2:05:05] they're found wanting today,
[2:05:07] some that's entertaining the thoughts of
[2:05:10] walking away or turning, maybe not even
[2:05:12] present in the visible audience, but
[2:05:14] maybe someone will stream it. I don't
[2:05:16] know for sure, Lord, but I know you
[2:05:18] know. I've followed you long enough to
[2:05:21] know to follow the leading of your
[2:05:23] spirit. So, I just commit it to you,
[2:05:24] Lord. I pray for those that are yours
[2:05:27] already and sealed by the Holy Ghost and
[2:05:30] yet maybe they're weary in the journey.
[2:05:31] And we know that's Satan's tactic
[2:05:34] according to the prophecy of Daniel in
[2:05:35] the last day that he would try to wear
[2:05:38] out the saints.
[2:05:41] Not get their soul, but wear them out.
[2:05:44] Wear them out with sickness. Wear them
[2:05:46] out with stress. Wear them out with
[2:05:48] living in Leodosa.
[2:05:50] We need your strength, Lord Jesus. Help
[2:05:55] us today, Father. I pray.
[2:05:58] Can we stand our feet, children?
[2:06:02] God bless you.
[2:06:07] Hallelujah.
[2:06:11] How many wants to be more in love with
[2:06:13] Jesus than ever before?
[2:06:15] I know a sermon like this can bring an
[2:06:18] element of fear. And I'm not saying that
[2:06:20] all godly fear of course is what we need
[2:06:24] an element of that. But we can't serve
[2:06:26] him out of fear. We have to serve him
[2:06:28] out of love. But remember much greater
[2:06:30] than us have been this way and have
[2:06:33] turned back.
[2:06:35] Let us not look at ourselves and say we
[2:06:38] will never do this. Our church will
[2:06:40] never do that. Our pastor stand strong.
[2:06:43] No. Let's not look that way. Let's not
[2:06:46] look at this. Let's look up this way.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; This is the only way right up here that
[2:06:52] we'll remain strong. It's greater than
[2:06:54] us. It's greater than me. It's greater
[2:06:56] than the minister brothers that we have
[2:06:58] here. It's greater than you sheep. Oh,
[2:07:00] some of the finest folks I've ever
[2:07:01] preached to around the world are right
[2:07:03] here. Some, not all, some. But it's
[2:07:06] greater than you. It's bigger than your
[2:07:08] flesh. It's bigger than your
[2:07:09] determination, bigger than your desire.
[2:07:12] But one thing we know for sure, it's not
[2:07:15] greater than our Lord Jesus.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Would you do me a favor and lay your
[2:07:21] hand on that person standing in our
[2:07:23] balance? Maybe it's your husband, your
[2:07:24] wife, your friend, a brother, sister,
[2:07:26] whatever it is, a companion in this
[2:07:28] warfare.
[2:07:31] We want to pray for one another.
[2:07:34] And we're going to offer prayer also for
[2:07:36] those that stream around the service. I
[2:07:38] know you you realize it, but there's
[2:07:39] people around the world that stream a
[2:07:42] service. Some in France watching, some
[2:07:44] in Norway, some some already watched in
[2:07:46] Canada, just different ones around the
[2:07:48] world. Some will do it tomorrow, some
[2:07:50] later tonight. Let's pray for them as
[2:07:53] well. The bride of Christ needs
[2:07:55] strength, friends, like never before.
[2:08:00] Heavenly Father, as we bow our heads in
[2:08:03] humility to the dust of the earth,
[2:08:07] thanking you for your grace to us, Lord
[2:08:09] Jesus,
[2:08:11] we're asking you, Lord, that you'd help
[2:08:13] us.
[2:08:15] Father God, I pray you'd help me today,
[2:08:17] Lord.
[2:08:19] I don't understand why it is, Lord, but
[2:08:22] there's I've noticed a pattern that it
[2:08:23] seems to be with some that I've seen in
[2:08:26] Pentecost and even some in the message
[2:08:28] that when preachers get older, maybe
[2:08:30] it's they they tend to think they have a
[2:08:33] kingdom and they get strong or I don't
[2:08:35] know exactly, but they tend to think
[2:08:39] that they can interpret the word and if
[2:08:41] they don't like this that brother said,
[2:08:43] they leave that out and explain this
[2:08:44] away and take this and don't go that way
[2:08:46] and
[2:08:48] Lord, Please help me.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Please Jesus,
[2:08:52] help me that I'll ever be true. Father,
[2:08:55] I pray for the other ministers here at
[2:08:57] our church. Lord, that you'd give each
[2:09:00] one of us strength, burden, desire to
[2:09:03] stay true to your word, Lord Jesus.
[2:09:06] I pray for the sheep here today, some of
[2:09:09] those that are visiting with us. Lord,
[2:09:11] you know their needs as well. And Lord,
[2:09:13] their church home where they go. And
[2:09:14] we're praying for them. We're praying
[2:09:16] for those, Father, that aren't really
[2:09:18] sheep of this fold, but yet they do
[2:09:20] stream from time to time and they get a
[2:09:22] little help along the way. We pray for
[2:09:24] them as well today, Lord Jesus. We pray
[2:09:26] for the ministry, the chosen ministry of
[2:09:29] God around the world that you'd
[2:09:30] strengthen them.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Oh God, may may the preachers preach
[2:09:34] this word like never before.
[2:09:38] I was thinking about it this week
[2:09:39] studying preparing for this Lord and I
[2:09:41] thought about different men that I've
[2:09:43] known and down through the years and yet
[2:09:45] some of those preachers that stood and
[2:09:47] preached for this message for years and
[2:09:49] traveled in different parts of the world
[2:09:52] and now denying it turning away from it.
[2:09:55] I thought so in light of what Peter
[2:09:58] said, they'd have been better off to
[2:09:59] stay a Baptist.
[2:10:01] They'd have been better off to stay a
[2:10:03] Pentecostal or a Methodist or whatever
[2:10:05] they were.
[2:10:08] They may not understand the theology,
[2:10:11] but if they'll hear these discernments
[2:10:14] and see the miracles of God,
[2:10:17] it was that that you condemned
[2:10:20] Capernium.
[2:10:22] You didn't say they understood your
[2:10:24] doctrine, but they saw things done that
[2:10:26] had never been done before.
[2:10:29] Lord God, help us, Father.
[2:10:32] Oh, keep the coldness of the hour away
[2:10:34] from our hearts, Lord Jesus. How it
[2:10:37] warmed my heart last night to see your
[2:10:39] children, worshiping you, Father, after
[2:10:41] the word and the communion and the foot
[2:10:43] washing and the saints of God singing
[2:10:46] and worshiping and praising you, Lord.
[2:10:49] or just standing around in the presence
[2:10:51] of the king. Keep us, Lord Jesus.
[2:10:56] Keep me true, Lord. Keep our church
[2:11:00] true. Father,
[2:11:02] our deacon brothers, our trustees, Lord,
[2:11:04] our youth leaders, oh lamb of God, every
[2:11:08] man, woman, boy, and girl, keep us, Lord
[2:11:11] Jesus, that it won't be said about us
[2:11:15] that we WERE ENLIGHTENED. WE TASTED OF
[2:11:18] the good word of God. We were made
[2:11:20] partakers of the world that is to come,
[2:11:24] the powers that will usher in that
[2:11:26] world, and we turned and walked away. No
[2:11:28] matter what I have to go through, no
[2:11:30] matter what I have to face, keep me
[2:11:33] true, Lord Jesus.
[2:11:35] Keep me true, Lord. We have our hands
[2:11:38] laid upon one another in the name of
[2:11:40] Jesus. Strengthen our brothers.
[2:11:43] Strengthen our sisters. Strengthen our
[2:11:45] youth. strengthen the saints of God,
[2:11:48] Father. Not only our assembly, but those
[2:11:51] around the world. We need you, Lord
[2:11:53] Jesus. We need you, Father.
[2:11:57] Oh, thank you for the word today, Lord.
[2:11:59] You know my heart. You know, I I don't
[2:12:01] enjoy preaching stuff like this, but
[2:12:03] God, I've got to obey your spirit. If it
[2:12:06] would pull one person away from veering
[2:12:09] off, Lord God, it'll be worth it.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, we worship you, Lord.
[2:12:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Don't you love
[2:12:21] him today, saints?
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Don't you just want to be closer and
[2:12:26] closer to him? Falling in love with
[2:12:29] Jesus is the best thing I ever done. I
[2:12:32] don't know about you.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; And falling out of love with Jesus is
[2:12:36] the worst thing we can ever do.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Don't you just want to fall in love with
[2:12:41] him more and more? Can you sing it for
[2:12:43] us, Harry? Not just his doctrines. I
[2:12:45] love his doctrines. I love studying the
[2:12:47] theology side of the word and and the
[2:12:50] doctrines. But oh, I tell you, I love
[2:12:52] his person. I just love the person. It
[2:12:55] ain't a doctrine coming for me in a
[2:12:57] rapture. It's a person I want to see.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Can we just worship him a little bit
[2:13:01] before we go? And it been good to be in
[2:13:03] the house of God.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing it together and just
[2:13:07] worship the Lord Jesus. Oh my
[2:13:09] [singing and music]
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; love.

[2:21:54] other day that preachers in this day now
[2:21:57] are getting messages off of AI.

[2:22:35] perfect man. I don't care what the world
[2:22:38] thinks about me. I really don't.

[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Bless you.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[2:25:21] Hallelujah. Dear God, as we stand here
[2:25:25] today, Lord, with this awesome, awesome
[2:25:27] privilege to be able to baptize our
[2:25:29] sister, Lord, you see, she felt on her
[2:25:32] heart that she needed to be rebaptized.
[2:25:35] Baptized years ago, but you've been
[2:25:37] dealing with her, Lord. She just wanted
[2:25:39] to obey that that tug, that pull. I
[2:25:42] pray, Father, that you'll just be with
[2:25:44] her and help her. You see the things of
[2:25:46] life and the journey, oh Lord, that
[2:25:49] she's dealt with along the way. I pray,
[2:25:51] God, that you would be with her. Yes,
[2:25:53] Lord.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, she drives down once a month or so
[2:25:56] to be in church with us. And we just
[2:25:58] pray that you'd help her and keep her by
[2:26:00] your grace, Father.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; Dear God, I can baptize many of one in
[2:26:04] water, but you're the only one, oh
[2:26:07] Father, that can not only baptize with
[2:26:08] the Holy Ghost,
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; but baptize every fiber of our being.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Lord, I I figure every real
[2:26:14] sincere son or daughter of God today
[2:26:17] would say they need that refilling of
[2:26:19] the Holy Ghost. Lord, granted, I pray to
[2:26:22] all of us. Dear Father, in the name of
[2:26:24] the Lord Jesus, we ask
[2:26:27] my sister, in obedience to the word of
[2:26:29] God, I baptize you in the name of our
[2:26:31] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:26:36] Praise the Lord. Praise the [applause]
[2:26:38] Lord.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; Just something about a baptism, it makes
[2:26:51] you want to get baptized yourself again.
[2:26:53] [laughter] It's just such a good
[2:26:54] feeling. You remember that day when you
[2:26:57] got baptized and it just it's just such
[2:26:59] a wonderful feeling. Have you enjoyed
[2:27:01] the word of God today? Amen. [applause]
[2:27:10] I appreciate a man that won't tickle our
[2:27:12] ears, but will tell us the truth,
[2:27:16] make us search our hearts. That's what
[2:27:18] church is all about. Amen.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're so we're such a blessed
[2:27:22] people today for what he's done for us
[2:27:24] in our lives. And I pray in this this
[2:27:27] coming year, we got one more service
[2:27:28] left in this year and looking now into
[2:27:30] 26 and already as we meeting scheduled
[2:27:34] up into July and August of next year.
[2:27:36] And but my desire for me and my family
[2:27:39] and your family is that
[2:27:41] that the presence of God would be
[2:27:43] greater in our lives and in our homes
[2:27:46] and in our churches in the coming year.
[2:27:49] that we would so illuminate our souls
[2:27:51] with his presence that the world would
[2:27:54] see his light in their darkness.
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. There just something about being
[2:28:00] in the presence of the Lord. Sing it,
[2:28:04] brother. Let's just sing this just
[2:28:05] before we go. May the Lord bless you
[2:28:08] this week and keep you, we pray. And we
[2:28:11] won't be seeing you. We're leaving for
[2:28:12] meetings, but happy new year. May the
[2:28:14] Lord bless you in the coming year. Amen.
[2:28:17] Let's just let's just sing this before
[2:28:18] we go.
[2:28:20] I know what it's like to be in the
[2:28:21] presence of the Lord. I know what it's
[2:28:24] like.

[2:35:03] Lord. [music]
[2:35:08] Amen.
[2:35:10] Please
[2:35:11] stay.
[2:35:16] Let's [music] just bow our heads.
[2:35:20] Heavenly Father, we are so grateful
[2:35:24] that we've been given the privilege to
[2:35:25] gather here in your name. once again.
[2:35:29] And Lord, to me, what we just sung is is
[2:35:33] more than a song, Lord.
[2:35:36] It's the desire of my heart.
[2:35:41] And Lord, I pray as we part our ways
[2:35:44] today, Lord, and different plans that
[2:35:46] ones would have
[2:35:49] may we take a moment, Lord, to
[2:35:54] to meditate upon the things that we have
[2:35:56] heard and
[2:35:58] maybe slip aside somewhere and make that
[2:36:00] commitment, Lord, that
[2:36:03] we want to give everything we have to
[2:36:05] you, Lord.
[2:36:08] Lord, we don't want to be like the
[2:36:10] world, act like the world, look like the
[2:36:12] world.
[2:36:14] We want to be like you, Lord.
[2:36:18] As your prophet said, Lord, he read a
[2:36:19] book about the long ranger and he took a
[2:36:21] broomstick and run around the yard,
[2:36:23] tried to be a cowboy,
[2:36:26] read a book about Tarzan, and cut up a
[2:36:28] rug and slept in a tree.
[2:36:31] So, one day he read a book about a man
[2:36:33] named Jesus.
[2:36:37] his desire ever since
[2:36:39] is to be like that.
[2:36:42] Granted today, Lord, we pray. We ask
[2:36:44] your blessings upon each family here,
[2:36:45] Lord. And those unable to be here today,
[2:36:48] we ask your blessings upon them and
[2:36:50] strengthen them, Lord, and touch their
[2:36:51] bodies and those who are having surgery
[2:36:54] this week, God. We pray that you would
[2:36:55] be with them, Lord, and bring them
[2:36:56] safely through.
[2:36:59] Watch over us, Lord, on the highways and
[2:37:01] the byways and bring us safely back
[2:37:02] again together, Lord. We pray.
[2:37:05] Thank you, Lord, for all that you've
[2:37:06] done for us, for all that you've given
[2:37:09] us. Thank you, Lord,
[2:37:12] for the privilege and the honor
[2:37:15] to serve you.
[2:37:17] We love you, Lord. We commit ourselves
[2:37:20] in this congregation into your hands for
[2:37:22] your glory. Touch Brother Donnie today,
[2:37:25] Lord. Renew his strength. Thank you,
[2:37:27] Father God, for using him, Lord.
[2:37:31] We just love you today, Lord. And commit
[2:37:33] these things into your hands. Go with
[2:37:34] your people now. We pray for we ask
[2:37:36] these things in Jesus name. Amen. God
[2:37:40] bless you saints. You're dismissed in
[2:37:42] the fear of the Lord. May God be with
[2:37:44] you. Be our prayer.
