[12:19] zone into the realm of the unknown where

[12:35] [Music]

[22:09] fs and
[22:11] S my
[22:15] [Music]
[22:20] need thank God for Grace to us
[22:24] tonight God bless you so happy we could
[22:27] be together once again again in in the
[22:29] presence of the Lord Brother Joe had
[22:32] asked me the other
[22:34] day if I liked the singing and the
[22:38] preliminaries about the well before we
[22:40] do the question answers and I told him
[22:43] absolutely I think it helps create an
[22:45] atmosphere for us to be able to enter
[22:48] into the presence of God don't you all I
[22:50] appreciate our brothers the effort that
[22:52] they put forth into the the music and
[22:55] the singing
[22:57] and
[22:59] we're grateful for that I like hearing a
[23:02] preacher that you can tell he's prepared
[23:05] I like hearing singers that you can tell
[23:07] they're prepared hearing musicians to me
[23:10] it just reflects something about the way
[23:13] we feel about the Lord you know the
[23:15] Bible tells us that whenever Abel
[23:17] offered unto God a more excellent
[23:19] sacrifice than that of Cain and he
[23:22] testified that he was considered
[23:24] righteous and it's amazing that God did
[23:27] not accept
[23:29] Abel because of the sacrifice but God
[23:32] accepted the
[23:33] sacrifice because of Abel and because
[23:37] God would not accept Cain he wouldn't
[23:39] accept him so it's the same with us
[23:42] whenever we come and we sacrifice I
[23:44] doubt some of you sacrificed to be here
[23:46] tonight maybe had to miss your supper
[23:48] and whatever boy you've had to do but we
[23:51] realize with Christianity if there isn't
[23:54] a sacrifice we don't appreciate it it's
[23:57] like it means nothing to us whatever I
[23:59] can go to church whenever I want to I
[24:01] can read my Bible when I want to but
[24:04] whenever it's a sacrifice it's like it
[24:06] has more value to it I trust it'll
[24:09] always be that way with us I didn't get
[24:12] done on the um um the question that we
[24:16] finished up on last time so I wanted to
[24:18] pick it up again I looked at it a couple
[24:20] different times and I thought well I
[24:22] covered quite a bit of it but the more I
[24:24] looked at it I thought no I think we
[24:27] need to go with it a little bit more and
[24:29] maybe bring a little bit more clarity to
[24:32] it so we'll uh we'll read this question
[24:35] how is it fair that a message Christian
[24:38] goes in the Rapture and any other
[24:43] denomination
[24:44] doesn't how is it fair now first of all
[24:48] I want to say the word fair is not a
[24:51] scriptural
[24:53] term the Bible doesn't say anything
[24:56] about fair this or fair that
[24:59] but it's a term that's an English term
[25:01] of course and it's a term the way that
[25:03] we measure whenever we look at things
[25:05] the way they're being dispensed or given
[25:08] out or treatment well they don't treat
[25:11] me Fair they treat me unfair this person
[25:13] gets more than I do or less than I do
[25:16] but when whenever we're talking about
[25:18] God God owns all
[25:22] Grace all Mercy all compassion
[25:26] faithfulness so on so on and so on so
[25:30] since it belongs to him then he can do
[25:32] whatever he wants to with it so first of
[25:35] all whenever we go to answering this
[25:36] let's look at it in in the right way
[25:38] that we will never be able to understand
[25:42] maybe all that God does when we talk
[25:44] about Fair how many of youall ate
[25:46] something before you uh came over here
[25:49] maybe over here or out in the Drive
[25:51] street so whenever you did that I want
[25:54] to ask you how many other people did you
[25:57] get food for other than
[26:01] yourself
[26:03] neighbors what about some homeless kids
[26:06] maybe some people standing on the side
[26:08] of the intersection coming off of the
[26:09] exit uh come out and there's some people
[26:11] there I will work for food I will do you
[26:14] mean you all had the
[26:16] osity to feed
[26:18] yourself and not feed somebody else is
[26:21] that
[26:24] fair yeah it
[26:26] is you me it fair that we get to have a
[26:29] place like this to worship
[26:31] God and several years ago I was in Kenya
[26:35] and preached under a big gigantic tree
[26:37] because they had no building and yet the
[26:40] presence of God came down there and God
[26:43] moved and God delivered as a matter of
[26:45] fact I received an email some months
[26:47] back from a young man that was just a
[26:49] little bitty boy whenever I was there he
[26:52] contacted malaria you know anything
[26:54] about malaria you know once you get it
[26:56] you never get rid of it the restk rest
[26:58] of your life an individual who's had
[27:00] malaria can't even donate blood because
[27:03] it's there but God healed that little
[27:05] boy that day underneath that tree and
[27:08] there's not one Speck of it left in his
[27:10] body so you think well is it fair that
[27:13] we would have a place like this and they
[27:15] would have to meet under a tree or maybe
[27:17] meet under a shack so whenever we go to
[27:19] looking at the way God dispenses stuff
[27:22] naturally it doesn't make sense but
[27:24] let's approach it tonight we'll pray and
[27:26] just ask God to open our hearts and help
[27:28] us to see it how many wants to see it
[27:30] right me too let's pray together father
[27:33] we love you so much we thank you for
[27:35] these young people that have assembled
[27:37] together tonight Lord not only for those
[27:40] but all of those that are streaming and
[27:42] those that will go back and archive the
[27:44] service I pray that you'll also open
[27:46] their understanding but truly we desire
[27:49] to know more about you and more about
[27:51] your ways and the things that you choose
[27:54] to reveal to us helps us to understand
[27:57] you better the way I look at it if I can
[28:00] understand you better and what you want
[28:02] of me then that means I can please you
[28:05] better in a more perfect way and you
[28:08] know my heart with all my heart that's
[28:10] what I want to do I believe these young
[28:12] people desire the very same thing so we
[28:15] look to you tonight to speak to us in
[28:17] the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen
[28:20] God bless you you may be
[28:22] seated now in answering this question as
[28:24] a preacher does sometimes a preacher
[28:26] will answer a question with another
[28:28] question so I've got a few questions
[28:30] that I'd like to go for on this now
[28:32] whenever we go to looking at God's
[28:34] choice of who God chooses to give what
[28:38] again it is God's choice but keep in
[28:41] mind when you're thinking about uh the
[28:44] basis of this question how is it fair
[28:45] that a Messenger Christian goes in the
[28:47] Rapture any other denomination doesn't
[28:50] that's a pretty broad spectrum of a
[28:53] question to be able to answer in one
[28:55] night much less to try to divide it with
[28:57] two or three others
[28:58] but just let me say this so you
[29:00] understand just because a person says
[29:02] they are a message believer does not
[29:05] mean they're going in the Rapture you're
[29:07] not going in the in the Rapture because
[29:09] you sit in the message Church you're not
[29:11] going in a Rapture even because you say
[29:14] you believe God sent a prophet but we go
[29:17] in the Rapture because our soul is
[29:19] sealed by the Holy Ghost and we know
[29:22] that the way we receive the Holy Ghost
[29:25] is obedience to his word then God makes
[29:27] himself known to us so there will be no
[29:29] doubt countless of so-called message
[29:32] people that will not go in the Rapture
[29:35] because they said in a message church
[29:37] and they felt like I'm fine I'm good I I
[29:40] I believe God sent a prophet and I go to
[29:42] church every now and then and I do this
[29:44] and that and the other there'll be a
[29:45] bunch of them that'll be left behind so
[29:48] just because a person says that they
[29:50] believe the message and they're in the
[29:51] message does not believe they'll go on
[29:53] the rapture we use the term message to
[29:56] identify us because that's what the
[29:57] prophet used to himself of course and
[29:59] the the word term message is also used
[30:01] in the New Testament so it identifies a
[30:04] group of people that are believing a
[30:06] message that we believe was sent from
[30:07] God as far as any other denomination can
[30:10] people from the denomination come to the
[30:13] truth of course they can many of us had
[30:15] that background um a lot of you all as
[30:18] young kids probably have been raised in
[30:19] the message and that's all that you've
[30:20] ever known but some of your parents
[30:22] grandparents Aunts Uncles things like
[30:24] that come from a denomination but if
[30:27] they TR receive the spirit of truth and
[30:30] the spirit of light it will draw them
[30:33] out of the denomination because in
[30:35] Revelation 181 whenever John saw and he
[30:38] said there was a a great angel that came
[30:41] down out of heaven and he cried with a
[30:43] loud voice and he said come out of her
[30:46] my people and touch not her unclean
[30:49] things so that they would not be
[30:51] identified in the denomination why are
[30:53] we so against the denomination because
[30:55] it's
[30:56] manmade it's man man run it's man
[31:00] orchestrated would they ever let people
[31:02] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:04] for the most part no they do not do they
[31:07] believe the fullness of the word they
[31:09] don't are are some of them good people
[31:12] as we would say well I guess if you're
[31:14] going to identify good people although
[31:16] the Lord Jesus said there is none good
[31:18] no not one so when we're talking about
[31:21] good remember the measuring Rod that
[31:23] that we're using are there some of them
[31:25] that love the Lord yes and they will
[31:27] come through the tri tribulation to be
[31:28] honest with you I don't understand how
[31:31] that a denominational person will be
[31:33] able to live and survive in the
[31:37] tribulation period because the prophet
[31:39] tells us they will be hunted down like
[31:42] dogs they will be persecuted they will
[31:45] be killed I honestly don't see how they
[31:47] will make it because there will not be
[31:49] one person here in the tribulation
[31:52] period with the Holy Ghost every person
[31:55] that had the Holy Ghost will be taken up
[31:58] those that are left here are those who
[32:00] think they are under the blood and then
[32:02] they will give their life no doubt there
[32:04] must be a special release of God to help
[32:07] them to be able to stand so it's not
[32:10] that we are against denominational
[32:11] people we're not against any people as
[32:13] far as people themselves but to be
[32:16] identified in the rapture we believe
[32:19] that the Rapture is for the elect of God
[32:22] now I think I asked the question last
[32:23] time we dealt with this how many of you
[32:24] young men feel like you have the choice
[32:27] to choose your
[32:29] wife how many of you sisters feel like
[32:31] you have the right to either accept a
[32:33] man or turn him down you want your daddy
[32:37] to pick him for you your mama what about
[32:39] your pastor what about your grandmother
[32:42] your grandfather no so it's fair for you
[32:46] to be able to choose your wife or your
[32:48] husband you agree with that tonight it's
[32:50] fair so is it fair for God to be able to
[32:54] choose his now keep this in mind that
[32:55] God has the ability that we don't have
[32:58] called for knowledge so God could look
[33:01] and see who would accept him and who
[33:03] wouldn't at the end of the Millennium
[33:05] after we have lived on this Earth for a
[33:07] thousand years and there will be people
[33:09] here the elect and glorified bodies
[33:12] there will be people here that are are
[33:14] not in glorified bodies they are in
[33:16] human bodies and they will see us and
[33:20] the Lord Jesus will be reigning from
[33:22] Jerusalem the temple will be built and
[33:25] all the great things of God that man as
[33:28] long for down Through the Ages will
[33:29] happen in the time of Millennium
[33:30] there'll be no deaths there'll be no
[33:31] suffering no heartache no crying none of
[33:34] the things like that that we know of and
[33:36] there will be people that will live on
[33:37] the earth that are not saved as we say
[33:41] but they are made to obey the laws of
[33:44] God made to do it then at the end of the
[33:47] Thousand Years the Bible says then Satan
[33:49] was loose out of his prison for a little
[33:51] season and he will go about all over the
[33:54] Earth gathering together all these
[33:56] people now they've seen Jesus Christ on
[33:58] a throne they've seen the elect of God
[34:00] in glorified bodies and at the end of
[34:03] that thousand years they will say I hate
[34:06] Jesus
[34:07] Christ I hate his kingdom I hate these
[34:12] people I hate him I didn't want to go to
[34:15] the Feast of Tabernacles they made me I
[34:18] did not want to go to church they made
[34:20] me uh it's it's more than I can
[34:24] comprehend that people would live on the
[34:26] earth first of all mortal human beings
[34:29] there's never been anybody that's lived
[34:32] to be a thousand years old because God
[34:34] said in the day you eat thereof that day
[34:36] you will die and that day was a
[34:38] Thousand-Year increment or a
[34:40] Thousand-Year dispensation the oldest
[34:42] man that we have record of in the Bible
[34:44] that lived was 969 years old and that
[34:47] was methusa Adam was 930 others 940 945
[34:52] different ones but nobody ever lived to
[34:53] be a thousand years old but in the
[34:55] Millennium people will live to be
[34:57] thousand years old there is no devil so
[35:00] think about it it's not like there's
[35:01] demons they're all held captive in the
[35:05] regions of the lost so it's not like
[35:07] there's anybody there to even teach them
[35:09] how to sin they don't even know how they
[35:12] don't know how to sin they don't know
[35:14] how to lie they don't know how to commit
[35:16] adultery because it's not bread in them
[35:18] they're raised from the dead given the
[35:21] opportunity now remember they're not
[35:23] getting a second chance but it's people
[35:25] who never had the opportunity to hear
[35:28] the truth and God knows that I hope you
[35:30] understand it this way that God actually
[35:32] allowed some of them to be blinded so
[35:34] they would never be able to hear it or
[35:36] wouldn't allow preachers to go in a
[35:37] certain area because he needed somebody
[35:40] in the Millennium to Reign over and
[35:42] we're not going to Reign Over each other
[35:43] so in Psalms 2 God said I will give Thee
[35:46] the Heathen for thine inheritance
[35:47] speaking this is a Messianic Psalm
[35:49] speaking about the Lord Jesus so they
[35:52] they were not born in sin like we are
[35:54] now they were not raised up in in
[35:56] schools and and they started out and you
[35:58] know in the early years and somebody
[36:00] taught them how to smoke a cigarette
[36:01] they don't know none of that they've
[36:03] never taught how to lie never been
[36:05] taught and yet at the end of that
[36:07] Thousand Years Satan will go about all
[36:09] over the face of the Earth and there
[36:11] will be millions of them and they will
[36:14] make their choice and rebel against
[36:17] Jesus Christ and his kingdom now let me
[36:20] just make sure that you understand this
[36:22] if the Millennium would have been a
[36:24] million years five million
[36:28] 10 million at the end of that time frame
[36:32] some of them people would have done the
[36:34] same
[36:35] thing because it's like no matter how
[36:38] many opportunities God gives them they
[36:40] want nothing to do with him now you and
[36:44] I don't know who they are boy am I glad
[36:47] we don't have a clue who they are so we
[36:49] may look at people and think man they
[36:51] have messed up so many times there
[36:53] couldn't be any more grace there
[36:55] couldn't be they've run out well only
[36:58] God is the only one that could determine
[37:00] that we look at him and we think boy boy
[37:02] it's looking bad this time but God is
[37:04] the only one that can be able to know
[37:06] when people have crossed that line I
[37:09] hope that you and I never have to
[37:10] experience that for oursel or for any of
[37:12] our family members but God by for
[37:15] knowledge could look down through time
[37:16] and know every person of all the
[37:18] billions of people that have been on the
[37:19] face of the Earth over seven billion
[37:21] people on the face of the Earth tonight
[37:23] he knows every one of them by name he
[37:25] knews when they were born he knows know
[37:27] if they will or will not serve him he
[37:30] knows he could give them
[37:32] 500,000 opportunities to serve him and
[37:35] they would still say I want nothing to
[37:38] do with him others would say yeah I mean
[37:41] I don't mind being a Christian I don't
[37:43] want to go to hell and I I don't want to
[37:45] be lost but don't tell me how to dress
[37:48] don't tell me I can't do this and I
[37:49] can't go there don't tell me I can't
[37:51] drink now don't tell me that I can't
[37:53] listen to rock and roll music well you
[37:55] see by that very attitude and behavior
[37:58] it proves if they maintain that they
[38:01] cannot be the bride so which one of you
[38:03] Brothers then you're looking for a wife
[38:07] you find this young lady she's a
[38:09] beautiful young lady and you go to
[38:10] talking to her and say I really like her
[38:12] I think maybe you know there might be
[38:14] something there between us and then you
[38:16] go to talking real serious and you say
[38:18] now now if we were to get married you
[38:20] know now now what are you saying well
[38:23] she said let me tell you right now if
[38:26] you think that I'm going to take your
[38:28] name I don't like your name that your
[38:32] last name is weird so I'm keeping my own
[38:36] name and don't think now that you are
[38:39] ever going to tell me anything to do no
[38:43] as a matter of fact your brother Donnie
[38:45] marries us it will be a requirement he
[38:48] will not say that in my vows that I will
[38:52] obey you because I never will do you
[38:56] understand that sweetie
[39:00] well I'm going to tell you one thing
[39:01] young man if you marry a woman like that
[39:03] you're dumber than she
[39:05] is you know what you're asking
[39:08] for you know what you're asking for and
[39:10] she tells you look now you're you're
[39:13] going to be my husband and I want you to
[39:15] provide for me I want you to buy me
[39:17] clothes and I want you to feed me and I
[39:18] want you to take care of me but just so
[39:20] you know my love is not all yours I mean
[39:24] if I see somebody else that I think is
[39:26] more handsome than you are
[39:27] I I want you to know I will have no
[39:29] problem in kissing them I will have no
[39:32] problem in going out on a date with
[39:35] them is there any of you young man that
[39:38] would want to continue relationship with
[39:40] that
[39:41] woman well you see that's what the
[39:43] church is telling Jesus now Jesus I want
[39:47] you to know now I I love you so much and
[39:49] I thank you for dying for me on the
[39:50] cross but leave my clothes
[39:54] alone don't you tell me that I can not
[39:57] do this and do that the other N I want
[39:59] you to save me from hell I don't want to
[40:01] go to hell no I don't want to burn in no
[40:03] Lake of Fire I don't want to be unated
[40:06] but don't you go to tell me what kind of
[40:08] music that I can listen to a person like
[40:11] that is not a member of the bride of
[40:14] Christ because just like a woman keeps
[40:17] her virtues 15 years 20 25 whatever it
[40:22] is she lives a holy life a Godly life
[40:25] she keeps her virtues she walks walks
[40:27] upright before God she walks down that
[40:30] aisle I performed the ceremony they
[40:33] married they exchange vows and Rings she
[40:36] will give all of those
[40:39] virtues to one
[40:41] man she will lay aside her maiden name
[40:45] unless she incorporates it in with his
[40:47] uses it as a middle name of sorts but
[40:50] she will no longer be called by her
[40:53] father's name but by his name
[40:58] where before she had her own money had
[41:00] her own car she you know kind of do
[41:02] whatever she wanted sort of but now she
[41:05] finds herself saying honey I saw her
[41:08] pretty dressed is it okay with you if I
[41:10] get that can can we afford it now can
[41:14] well no no I I don't I don't think we
[41:16] can because our insurance is due you
[41:19] know for that woman to say oh my
[41:20] goodness this is my money oh no wait a
[41:22] minute wait a minute wait a minute it
[41:25] was yours before you and him got married
[41:28] just like his money was his before you
[41:30] got married but once you get married
[41:33] it's not just his and not just yours
[41:37] it's both of you together now some
[41:39] people have the philosophy whatever you
[41:42] know they tell the wife or their husband
[41:44] whatever is mine is mine and whatever is
[41:46] yours is mine that's the way they want
[41:48] it to be they want everything to be
[41:50] theirs but it's no longer just yours
[41:54] it's no longer just your life you young
[41:56] ladies you come and go as you please you
[41:57] know you go here you go there you do
[41:58] this that the other but whenever you
[42:00] become married you can't do that and
[42:02] that's not just so with young ladies
[42:04] that's so with men I know in the message
[42:06] a lot of the men don't want to be that
[42:07] way but a man that doesn't have that
[42:09] attitude about his wife girls don't
[42:12] marry him a man that will not make you a
[42:15] queen stay away from him I'm warning you
[42:18] as your pastor a man that will not
[42:21] admire you a man that will not make you
[42:24] the queen of his home the queen of his
[42:27] heart and treat you like a lady and love
[42:30] you so much that if a criminal broke in
[42:33] your house that he would beg that man to
[42:36] shoot him instead of shooting you that
[42:40] man is not worth your
[42:44] life husbands love your wives as Christ
[42:48] also loved the church and gave himself
[42:50] for it that he may wash it by the water
[42:54] of regeneration or by the word that's
[42:56] the kind of man sisters that you want to
[42:59] marry you you sisters agree with that
[43:01] you agree with that well then you
[43:03] Brothers you agree with me then that the
[43:05] kind of woman you want to marry is one
[43:07] that says now honey we want to make a
[43:09] home together we want to make it
[43:11] together we're going to make decisions
[43:12] together and we're going to pray and
[43:14] we're going to seek God about brothers
[43:16] that kind of wife you want well surely
[43:18] we wouldn't want something that we
[43:20] wouldn't allow the Lord Jesus to have
[43:22] would we of course not so we can see the
[43:25] very epitome of God's character from the
[43:27] Old Testament and that God God exercises
[43:31] the right of sovereignty by being able
[43:34] to choose look with me in Exodus chapter
[43:39] 19:5 now therefore if you will obey my
[43:41] voice and deed and keep my Covenant then
[43:43] ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[43:48] above all people now this is God
[43:51] speaking to the children of Israel if
[43:54] you notice what now there's a
[43:55] conditional part if you will obey my
[43:57] voice inde deed and keep my Covenant
[43:59] then ye shall be a peculiar treasure
[44:02] unto me above all people for all the
[44:07] Earth
[44:09] is
[44:11] who a so here's the key
[44:17] sovereignty he's the one who brought
[44:19] them on the earth he's the one that gave
[44:22] every sinner this very day every breast
[44:27] that they
[44:28] breathed he gave them his Mercy for the
[44:31] hundreds of times their heart has beat
[44:34] and pumped gallons of blood through
[44:36] their body most of them will never thank
[44:39] him for it they'll never be grateful but
[44:42] yet all Humanity lays before him so he
[44:46] can reach down as you did when you were
[44:49] little and maybe your mom and daddy or
[44:51] Aunt or uncle or someone bought you some
[44:53] Play-Doh or you sat out in the mud and
[44:55] played in the mud whichever it was for
[44:57] you and you take that Play-Doh and you
[44:59] want to make a horse or you want to make
[45:01] a cow well who who's going to dictate
[45:04] you no no no you can't make a cow out of
[45:07] that who ever seen a Blue Cow who ever
[45:11] seen a yellow oh my goodness you've got
[45:13] to have a brown white polka doted you
[45:15] can't well if you wanted to make a blue
[45:17] cow out of blue Play-Doh that's what you
[45:19] done right so all of the earth lays
[45:24] before him and this this is what God
[45:27] said you will be a peculiar treasure
[45:30] unto me above all people for all the
[45:31] Earth is mine Deuteronomy 7:6 for thou
[45:35] art Unholy people unto the Lord thy God
[45:38] the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be
[45:41] a special people unto himself above all
[45:46] people that are upon the face of the
[45:50] earth now this is God's
[45:52] character the Lord did not set his love
[45:56] upon you nor choose you because you were
[46:00] more in number than any people for ye
[46:04] were the
[46:05] fewest of all people but because now
[46:10] this is why the
[46:12] Lord loved
[46:16] you it wasn't that they loved
[46:19] him he loved them you know why you're
[46:22] sitting here tonight oh brother Donnie I
[46:24] love the Lord I wanted to oh I made up
[46:27] my
[46:28] mind
[46:31] no actually what we did as the elect of
[46:34] God
[46:36] was we finally got our will in line with
[46:41] his that's all you done you finally
[46:45] surrendered your will and God coaxed on
[46:48] you and pulled on you until he finally
[46:51] got your will because you was here and
[46:53] he was here and he finally lined you up
[46:57] to where you surrendered to what he
[47:00] wanted you to
[47:01] be I'm so grateful that it's that way
[47:04] the Lord did not set his love upon you
[47:07] nor choose you because you were more
[47:09] number than any people for you were
[47:10] fewest of the people but because the
[47:13] Lord loved you and because he would keep
[47:16] the Oaths which he had sworn unto your
[47:20] fathers ha the Lord brought you with a
[47:22] mighty hand and redeemed you out of the
[47:25] house of bondman
[47:27] from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt
[47:31] Deuteronomy 14:2 for thou art a holy
[47:34] people unto the Lord thy God and the
[47:36] Lord ha chosen thee To Be A peculiar
[47:38] people unto himself above all the
[47:41] nations that are upon the Earth
[47:43] Deuteronomy
[47:45] 26:18 the Lord hasth avouched thee this
[47:48] day to be his peculiar people as he hath
[47:53] promised thee and that thou should us
[47:55] keep all his commands Commandments and
[47:57] to make thee
[48:00] High Above All
[48:03] Nations which he has made in praise and
[48:09] in name and in honor and that thou
[48:13] mayest be a holy people unto the Lord
[48:16] thy God as he has spoken thee so it was
[48:20] not then that they chose the Lord it was
[48:22] not that Abraham said oh God oh God I'm
[48:26] making up my mind I'm going to serve you
[48:28] oh God I'm this that the other it was
[48:31] not Abraham that did that it was God
[48:33] that spoke these words to him and said
[48:35] as for me my Covenant is with thee as a
[48:42] matter of fact he never even asked
[48:44] Abraham if he wanted
[48:46] to he never even said now this is the
[48:49] way I feel but it's all based upon you
[48:51] now Abraham if you say no then I I I
[48:55] guess I just I guess I made a mistake
[48:56] mistake I'll give up God never even give
[48:59] him a
[49:01] choice I love that God never even said
[49:04] now really I I I want you to be saved
[49:06] can't you see the way people preach
[49:08] grace and mercy it's like that God had
[49:11] to send his little boy down from heaven
[49:13] and maybe somebody will feel sorry for
[49:15] him so the preachers get up and cry and
[49:18] beg and cry oh won't somebody come won't
[49:21] somebody come please please please feel
[49:25] sorry that ain't my my
[49:28] God Jesus came to seek and to save that
[49:32] which was lost he knows every creature
[49:37] that'll ever serve him and he knows
[49:39] there will be billions of them that if
[49:41] he gave them a million years of Peace a
[49:45] million years of happiness and joy at
[49:48] the end of that million years they Point
[49:50] their finger in his face and say God I
[49:53] want nothing to do with you I want your
[49:57] blessings I want your money I want your
[49:59] peace but don't you tell me how to
[50:03] live I'm not sure that we're grateful
[50:07] enough that we have a desire to serve
[50:10] him that we want to you realize how
[50:12] blessed you are you young ladies and
[50:15] young men you realize how blessed you
[50:17] are that you want to serve him you want
[50:21] to live for him nobody made you come
[50:24] tonight you didn't have to nobody made
[50:26] you come last night but you wanted to be
[50:28] here right you chose you chose this
[50:32] way praise the Lord but why did I choose
[50:35] it because he foreordained me to choose
[50:39] it just like he did you and others he
[50:43] could give them all kinds of things and
[50:45] at the end of it they'd still choose
[50:47] their selfish ways notice in Titus 2:14
[50:51] who gave himself for us that he might
[50:53] redeem us from all iniquity and purify
[50:58] unto himself a peculiar people zealous
[51:04] of good works now this is one of the
[51:06] signs of his peculiar people even in the
[51:09] New Testament that they would be zealous
[51:12] and that word it's it's a word that
[51:14] comes from Zeal in the New Testament
[51:17] there was a group of Jews and they were
[51:19] called zealots so the zealots were known
[51:24] because of their passion they hated the
[51:27] Romans they hated the Roman government
[51:31] they done everything really so you'd be
[51:33] able to relate to it they were first
[51:35] century terrorists so they would slit a
[51:39] Roman guard's throat they would burn
[51:42] their corn they would burn their
[51:43] buildings down and they were little
[51:45] terror cells that's what they were and
[51:47] they were called zealots and the reason
[51:51] they were was because the Zeal they
[51:53] wanted their country back so bad they
[51:56] hated it that the Romans were there and
[51:58] many them lost their lives for it and
[52:00] this is the same word that Paul uses in
[52:03] describing the elect of God they have
[52:05] such a Zeal for the Lord it burns in
[52:09] them I mean that they can't live without
[52:11] him they can't even think without him
[52:13] correctly they can't function without
[52:16] him it's a Zeal it's a passion and the
[52:19] word zeal actually means a fire that
[52:21] burns within them so like a zealot oh he
[52:25] he he would kill he would murder he
[52:27] would do anything to be able to inflict
[52:30] some type of Terror on the first century
[52:33] Romans did it Avail to anything no of
[52:35] them they crucified them they hung them
[52:37] on crosses and they wound up just
[52:40] absolutely annihilating most of them
[52:43] zealots but there is no devils in hell
[52:46] can wipe out the real passion the real
[52:49] Zeal in our hearts for Jesus Christ so
[52:52] notice what the elect of God will be
[52:55] they will be zealous
[52:57] of good works it burns in them you know
[53:00] they're just well I heard brother Donnie
[53:02] say I've got to do this and brother Joe
[53:03] said I've got to I reckon I'm want to
[53:05] get my dos and my don'ts done and I want
[53:08] to go ahead and do it you're not doing
[53:10] it because you love him you're doing it
[53:12] because you think it's required of you a
[53:14] real Christian wants to know what's
[53:18] required not so they can figure it out
[53:21] and get as close to the world as they
[53:24] can and just walk really carefully
[53:27] they want to know what their boundaries
[53:29] are so they don't get in trouble but let
[53:32] me add to you another aspect of a real
[53:34] believer they want to know what's
[53:37] required because they also want to know
[53:40] what they can do above and beyond what's
[53:42] required because that's the way they
[53:45] feel about him they don't want to just
[53:47] do you know these required things and
[53:49] then you're good they don't live by that
[53:52] law they say is there anything else I
[53:55] could do is there anything else Lord
[53:58] that you'd like me to do is there
[53:59] anybody that you want to do this or that
[54:01] that nobody else wants to do that Lord I
[54:03] I I'd be willing to do anything because
[54:05] you've done so much for me I don't want
[54:07] to just do what I'm required to do I
[54:11] want to do above and beyond what I'm
[54:14] required now many of you have said unto
[54:16] me for years and years I could study I
[54:19] could study for an hour or so maybe to
[54:22] be able to get a sermon together I don't
[54:24] have to study hours and hours I don't
[54:27] have to study and read hundreds of
[54:29] quotes hundreds of scriptures I've done
[54:31] studies before in the message and quotes
[54:34] and have over
[54:37] 6,000 that I've looked at in one
[54:41] subject now did god require that Donnie
[54:44] if you do
[54:45] 5,998 I won't anoint you no I just want
[54:50] to make so sure I cover every inch of
[54:53] ground that I can and I also want to
[54:56] give you so much weapons to work with
[54:59] that you'll be able to leave out of here
[55:01] and kill every devil that gets in your
[55:02] path I want you to be equipped I want
[55:05] you to be ready if anybody can over
[55:08] equip you're looking at the preacher
[55:09] that'll do it because I want to give you
[55:12] everything that I can give you I don't
[55:15] want to just do what's required well
[55:16] tell me what's the minimum Lord so I can
[55:18] go out and do this and that and the
[55:19] other there is greater No Greater Joy in
[55:22] my life than to be able to study the
[55:24] word of God for God's people I don't
[55:26] believe it's just so for a preacher I
[55:28] think it should be for all of us now let
[55:30] me ask another
[55:31] question was it
[55:34] fair that the Lord Jesus
[55:38] Walks In A
[55:40] congregation around a pool called
[55:45] salom whenever they come in there now
[55:47] the angel of the Lord would come down on
[55:49] a certain season and they would lay the
[55:51] sick so there's crippled blind halt lame
[55:56] all kinds of people with all kinds of
[55:59] diseases notice St John
[56:01] 53 in these lay a great
[56:07] multitude of impotent folk
[56:11] blind halt wizard waiting for the moving
[56:16] of the water for an angel went down at a
[56:19] certain season into the pool and
[56:21] troubled the water whosoever then first
[56:24] after the troubling of the water stepped
[56:25] in
[56:27] was made whole of whatsoever disease he
[56:30] had know ain't that peculiar so here
[56:33] lays a multitude so it could have been
[56:35] hundreds could have been thousands a
[56:37] multitude is no certain number we don't
[56:40] know exactly how many it was but it was
[56:42] a vast I've been at that pool and it's
[56:44] quite a large place around this pool so
[56:48] there's porticos and porches and things
[56:50] like that so it was no doubt thousands
[56:52] of people whenever they was there and
[56:54] the angel of the Lord would come down
[56:56] and step in the water and Trouble the
[56:58] water and the first person that got in
[57:01] we think now wait a minute we've got
[57:03] thousands maybe 2,000 3,000 5,000 from
[57:07] looking at the place whenever I saw it
[57:09] there you could easily put several
[57:10] thousand people there so why would God
[57:15] only give
[57:16] healing to one person when there's
[57:20] thousands of them
[57:21] there you see when we take our
[57:24] mind and try to understand God we're
[57:28] already defeated before we ever star
[57:30] we now watch so the Lord Jesus goes in
[57:33] there now remember he is the Divine
[57:35] healer but Jesus did not go out and
[57:39] heal at just him Desiring to heal people
[57:44] now let me be honest with you if it was
[57:45] left up to me tonight when this service
[57:47] was over and I had the ability to do it
[57:49] I'll tell you what I'd do I'd go to the
[57:52] med center first because it's the
[57:53] largest one I would go in that Med
[57:55] Center and I'd offer one prayer and I
[57:58] would pray for every person in there and
[58:01] if it's left up to me I would pray that
[58:04] every one of them would clean out all
[58:06] them five floors of rooms everybody
[58:09] would check out tonight and they all go
[58:11] home well then I'd go to the next
[58:14] hospital then I'd go to Kingsport then
[58:15] I'd go to Bristol I'd empty out every
[58:17] one of them well I brother don't so
[58:19] people would know you've done it I
[58:21] wouldn't want to know I even prayed I
[58:23] just have a feeling for sick people but
[58:26] I tell you what a lot of that is human
[58:30] compassion us feeling sorry for people I
[58:33] see people whenever I'm out Lowe's
[58:34] Walmart you know it is and you go out
[58:36] you see sick people and this that and
[58:38] other I've actually stopped and prayed
[58:40] for people that were sick asked them if
[58:42] I could of course because you just feel
[58:44] for people and sometimes we get that
[58:47] confused with the way God looks at it so
[58:50] we ourselves we say oh be healed be
[58:52] healed be healed be healed be healed and
[58:55] here what was God himself and he walks
[58:58] among the people maybe stepping over a
[59:01] blind man stepping around a little girl
[59:04] that was crippled stepping around
[59:07] another one they just piled in there and
[59:10] it goes over to one
[59:12] man one man now we would look at that
[59:16] and think well that's not compassion you
[59:19] know why we would think that because we
[59:21] don't understand the Divine meaning of
[59:25] what compassion
[59:26] is the prophet describes this for us and
[59:29] he said compassion is not human
[59:34] sympathy but
[59:36] compassion is doing the will of
[59:41] God so we look at that and say oh my a a
[59:45] compassionate God would just heal
[59:48] everybody there well he
[59:52] didn't he didn't I walked into the
[59:55] hospitals many of times time and prayed
[59:56] for people I've seen God stop heart
[59:58] attacks in the med center I've prayed
[1:00:01] for people and God do all kinds of
[1:00:03] things absolutely do all kinds of things
[1:00:06] and yet other people there never got one
[1:00:09] thing you ought to be so grateful
[1:00:11] tonight that God's give you Grace you
[1:00:14] have found favor now watch and there was
[1:00:17] a certain man that was there which had
[1:00:18] an infirmity 30 and8 years so this guy
[1:00:22] had whatever it was he had the prophet
[1:00:24] said it was a prostate trouble had it 38
[1:00:27] years it was not a terminal condition so
[1:00:31] it was not cancer it was not TB it was
[1:00:33] not something that he was right on his
[1:00:34] last leg and the man's going to die he'd
[1:00:36] had that for 38 years when Jesus saw him
[1:00:43] lie and
[1:00:45] knew that he had been now a long time in
[1:00:48] that
[1:00:49] case he saith unto him will thou be made
[1:00:54] whole the impotent man answered him sir
[1:00:57] I have no man when the water's trouble
[1:00:58] to put me into the pool but when I'm
[1:01:00] coming another steth down before me
[1:01:02] Jesus saith unto him
[1:01:05] rise take up thy bed and walk and
[1:01:10] immediately the man was made
[1:01:14] whole and took up his bed and walked and
[1:01:18] on the same day was the
[1:01:22] Sabbath I wonder how many babies
[1:01:25] toddlers
[1:01:27] teenagers old men old women blind daddy
[1:01:31] blind Mama maybe an old lady with her
[1:01:34] legs all contorted and twisted and
[1:01:37] crippled Jesus walked right by her you
[1:01:40] said but D why would he do that because
[1:01:43] the father had showed him a
[1:01:47] vision so he goes in and and he's
[1:01:50] looking there's all them people they
[1:01:53] wonder who is that guy he's looking they
[1:01:55] can tell he's intently looking for
[1:01:57] something what's he looking for he's
[1:02:00] looking for the man that he saw in the
[1:02:03] vision that the father showed him so he
[1:02:07] works his way around this group and that
[1:02:09] group and that group why Jesus had
[1:02:12] Divine compassion which is to do what
[1:02:17] heal everybody that was there that's
[1:02:19] human
[1:02:21] sympathy but compassion is doing the
[1:02:23] will of God so Jesus J goes and says
[1:02:27] these words to the man the man of course
[1:02:29] takes up his bed and walk it's on the
[1:02:31] Sabbath day the Pharisees of course you
[1:02:33] know they blow a gasket as we'd say I
[1:02:35] mean they get all bent out of shape
[1:02:37] Jesus just walks right out from among
[1:02:39] them and goes right on and leaves all
[1:02:41] the rest of those people laying
[1:02:48] there I wonder how many people died lost
[1:02:52] the night you got
[1:02:54] saved
[1:02:57] wonder how many of you satting here
[1:02:58] tonight that God had to deal with you
[1:03:00] five times 10 times 20 times 25
[1:03:04] times before you ever really committed
[1:03:07] your whole life to
[1:03:10] him and maybe some people he called them
[1:03:13] once one time they live to be 75 80
[1:03:17] years old 90 he gives them one call
[1:03:20] because that's all he's obligated to
[1:03:22] do but you see he looks in a way
[1:03:26] that we don't see and if he sees his own
[1:03:29] representation in that individual he
[1:03:32] cannot lose that person or he would lose
[1:03:36] a part of
[1:03:41] himself
[1:03:43] Hallelujah so again I'll ask another
[1:03:46] question was it fair that Jesus allowed
[1:03:51] Peter James and John to spend more time
[1:03:57] with him than the other
[1:04:00] nine
[1:04:03] disciples watch this Matthew 1771 and
[1:04:06] after six days Jesus taketh Peter James
[1:04:10] and John his brother and bring us him
[1:04:12] into a high mountain Mark 5:35 while he
[1:04:16] yet speak there came from the rulle of
[1:04:19] the synagogue's house certain which said
[1:04:21] thy daughter is dead why troubles thou
[1:04:22] the master any further as soon as Jesus
[1:04:25] Jesus heard the word that was spoken he
[1:04:28] sath unto the ruler of the synagogue Be
[1:04:29] not Afraid only believe when he suffered
[1:04:33] no
[1:04:34] man to follow him save Peter and James
[1:04:39] and John Mark 132 Jesus answering said
[1:04:43] unto him seest thou the great buildings
[1:04:46] there shall not be one one stone left
[1:04:48] upon another that shall not be thrown
[1:04:50] down and as he set upon the Mount of
[1:04:52] Olives over against the temple Peter and
[1:04:54] James and John and
[1:04:58] Andrew now we're talking about the
[1:05:01] original 12
[1:05:03] disciples and yet Jesus allowed three of
[1:05:06] these
[1:05:07] guys more special occasions with him
[1:05:13] than any of the others now the other
[1:05:15] eight we know Judas was an elect but the
[1:05:18] other eight were just as chosen as these
[1:05:21] three are
[1:05:22] why brother Donnie do you do you know
[1:05:25] why you know why I
[1:05:28] don't but I figure if I needed to it
[1:05:31] would be in
[1:05:32] there so what do we do we trust him you
[1:05:36] know God does the same thing today that
[1:05:38] he will allow certain people to have
[1:05:41] certain experiences with him we may
[1:05:43] never have we may never have in our own
[1:05:46] life and we realize our experiences are
[1:05:48] predestinated by God and to me I've
[1:05:50] learned that I I I wouldn't want to
[1:05:52] experience something maybe in a higher
[1:05:56] sphere or in a place that I wouldn't be
[1:06:00] called to walk in that because it could
[1:06:03] be detrimental to me I would never want
[1:06:07] to soar into a realm I cannot imagine
[1:06:11] the realm that brother random must have
[1:06:12] walked in to be able to see angels and I
[1:06:14] was reading it today whenever the angel
[1:06:16] of the Lord come in when he saw him the
[1:06:17] first time when he was at the cave there
[1:06:20] praying and then into that little cabin
[1:06:23] of a thing and whenever he was there he
[1:06:26] was down on his face and he heard the
[1:06:28] footprints of a man coming but the man
[1:06:32] had not no shoes he was
[1:06:35] barefooted and he said whenever he
[1:06:37] opened his eyes he saw that man's feet
[1:06:41] and then he looked up higher and it was
[1:06:43] an angel standing
[1:06:45] there now I've seen Angels myself but
[1:06:49] I've never seen them to where it did not
[1:06:51] terrify me I've seen demons same thing
[1:06:55] AB absolutely terrify you to be honest
[1:06:59] with you I'm glad I don't see them every
[1:07:00] day I don't think I'm made to you
[1:07:04] understand maybe some of you have never
[1:07:05] seen him and maybe you never will well
[1:07:07] God knows exactly what each of us can
[1:07:10] take now brother R said whenever he
[1:07:12] would finish the prayer lines at night
[1:07:14] and he would go back to the hotel room
[1:07:17] those demons would come in his
[1:07:20] room he would feel their flesh rub him
[1:07:25] in the
[1:07:27] night he would hear chains rattle they
[1:07:31] would come in his room and torment him
[1:07:34] you understand what had happened people
[1:07:36] in those meetings had been delivered and
[1:07:39] them demons was bringing them chains
[1:07:42] that they had been set free from and
[1:07:44] rattling them around that Prophet trying
[1:07:48] to scare him and make him afraid I'm not
[1:07:52] made to hear that if I ever heard that
[1:07:55] I'd be buried underneath the
[1:07:58] covers or I'd done be out of the hotel
[1:08:00] room I'd be you know going somewhere
[1:08:02] else anybody else here with me okay all
[1:08:05] right at least y'all on the same page
[1:08:07] see we're not called we're not we're not
[1:08:09] called to be able to experience things
[1:08:11] like that I I've seen things like that a
[1:08:13] few times and I've wrestled with demons
[1:08:15] and and that sort of thing but I'm not
[1:08:17] called to do that on the daily day
[1:08:19] to-day thing I'm not called to do it so
[1:08:21] God calls us and God gives us according
[1:08:24] to what he knows we're called to do now
[1:08:28] the same with Peter and James and John
[1:08:31] notice in Mark again whenever Jesus Mark
[1:08:35] 14:32 and they came to a place which was
[1:08:38] called Gethsemane and he says to his
[1:08:40] disciples sit here while I shall pray
[1:08:42] and he taketh with him Peter and James
[1:08:46] and John and begin to be sore amazed and
[1:08:50] to be very heavy so they enter in with
[1:08:54] him in Glory they enter in with him can
[1:08:58] you imagine on Mount Transfiguration he
[1:09:00] takes them up to the mountain there
[1:09:02] Peter James and John and they look out
[1:09:05] there and they see Moses and Elijah
[1:09:07] standing there in glorified bodies and
[1:09:10] they watch the Lord Jesus as he is
[1:09:12] transformed the word metamorpho he
[1:09:15] actually was
[1:09:17] transformed and they saw him
[1:09:20] change as they come off the mountain and
[1:09:22] they had to tell the rest of the
[1:09:23] brothers you imagine how the rest of the
[1:09:24] brothers saw
[1:09:25] well how come I didn't get to see that
[1:09:28] you know how we are as human beings if
[1:09:30] we feel like anybody's getting something
[1:09:32] more than we do come on let's be honest
[1:09:34] we have a little problem with that don't
[1:09:36] we and they were it's evident they were
[1:09:38] unconverted because it's arguing about
[1:09:40] which woman was going to be the the
[1:09:42] greatest so why did he do that but as we
[1:09:45] look on in the book of Acts and we can
[1:09:48] see Peter James and John were the
[1:09:51] prominent of the three so the Lord Jesus
[1:09:54] was doing this for a cause and a reason
[1:09:57] another question I had a conversation
[1:09:59] with my parents asking why message
[1:10:02] people get the privilege to go into the
[1:10:04] raptures from the same individual but my
[1:10:06] Baptist friend wouldn't Matthew chap
[1:10:10] 27:1 15 now let's look at
[1:10:12] this Resurrection Jesus when he had
[1:10:15] cried again with a loud voice yielded up
[1:10:18] The Ghost and behold the veil of the
[1:10:20] temple was ran and Twain From the top to
[1:10:22] the bottom and the Earth did quake and
[1:10:24] the rocks rent and the graves were open
[1:10:28] I'm sure you know this already but there
[1:10:30] has already been a resurrection of the
[1:10:33] Dead not a child not one or two in the
[1:10:37] Old Testament and in the new but there
[1:10:39] has been a mass resurrection of the Dead
[1:10:43] That's when Paradise was emptied out now
[1:10:47] want you to notice though it was not
[1:10:49] everybody that was dead and the graves
[1:10:52] were opened and many bodies
[1:10:56] of the
[1:10:57] Saints which slept
[1:11:01] aose now you notice that Matthew when he
[1:11:04] coined this term he did not say all the
[1:11:07] bodies for whatever reason Adam and Eve
[1:11:12] did not
[1:11:13] raise actually brother Brandon places
[1:11:16] them in our Resurrection he said Adam
[1:11:19] will reach over and take a hold of Eve
[1:11:21] she will reach over and take a hold of
[1:11:23] Seth Seth will reach over and take a
[1:11:25] hold of Enoch and on down and on down
[1:11:28] and on down there's a reason for it oh
[1:11:31] do you know the answer brother Donnie no
[1:11:33] another one I don't know the answer of
[1:11:36] but all I know is I'm just glad I'm
[1:11:38] going to be part of it aren't you so you
[1:11:40] see when God puts people in and leaves
[1:11:44] people out many times we don't see the
[1:11:47] bigger picture God will heal some and
[1:11:50] God will choose to take others and we
[1:11:52] look at and say that makes no sense that
[1:11:54] makes no no sense why would God why
[1:11:57] would God heal that one and that one and
[1:11:58] that one and and and and not heal this
[1:12:00] one and take it well we have to trust
[1:12:03] him that his plan is a great plan
[1:12:05] perfect Flawless makes no mistakes
[1:12:08] whatsoever and he's working it for the
[1:12:10] good of that individual you believe that
[1:12:13] now watch what happened and the graves
[1:12:14] were open many bodies of the Saints
[1:12:16] which slept arose and came out of the
[1:12:18] graves after his resurrection so
[1:12:21] actually these Graves were open after
[1:12:24] Jesus come out now we know the prophet
[1:12:26] tells us that Abraham and Sarah were
[1:12:27] part of them there was a dimension that
[1:12:29] was held downward that down down this
[1:12:31] way you know there's three dimensions
[1:12:33] this way three above us and then here we
[1:12:35] live in the fourth dimension 1 through
[1:12:37] four and and this mortality but they
[1:12:40] could not go up into the presence of God
[1:12:43] so there was a place called paradise and
[1:12:45] this is what Jesus told the thief on the
[1:12:46] cross this day you will be with me in
[1:12:48] Paradise because the blood had not been
[1:12:50] shed so the souls could not go to the
[1:12:52] sixth Dimension he created the sixth
[1:12:55] Dimension when he made all seven but he
[1:12:57] knew that mortal Saints could not be
[1:13:00] able to come straight from this world
[1:13:02] and go straight into that realm so they
[1:13:04] went downward and they were held down
[1:13:07] there waiting for the shedding of the
[1:13:09] blood when the Lord Jesus goes down and
[1:13:12] he becomes the atonement for our sins
[1:13:14] then Paradise was emptied out he goes to
[1:13:17] hell knocks on the gate the door to hell
[1:13:20] and whenever he does he conquers the
[1:13:22] devil he reaches in there and grabs a
[1:13:24] hold of the king keys and slams the door
[1:13:26] shut the prophet said and kicks
[1:13:28] everything on the wall off man that was
[1:13:30] a Victor wasn't it and then he goes over
[1:13:33] in a realm that is very close now
[1:13:35] remember Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph
[1:13:37] Ezekiel Jeremiah Zachariah Hagi all of
[1:13:40] those saints of God were there in that
[1:13:42] Dimension and they were waiting for the
[1:13:44] promised Redeemer so Jesus goes in there
[1:13:47] and knocks on the door and then they
[1:13:49] come and he said come on children let's
[1:13:51] go and he sets them free and empties out
[1:13:55] out paradise then Jesus raises from the
[1:13:59] dead and then the prophet said that was
[1:14:01] Abraham and Sarah and Jacob and Joseph
[1:14:05] and they were being seen by people on
[1:14:08] the Earth and Abraham looked over at
[1:14:10] Sarah and said Sarah we better leave
[1:14:13] we're being
[1:14:15] recognized praise be to God I believe
[1:14:18] our resurrection's fixing to happen too
[1:14:20] before long same thing's going to take
[1:14:22] place again so they no longer go to par
[1:14:25] Paradise but they go up into the sixth
[1:14:28] Dimension watch again Revelation 20:4 I
[1:14:32] saw Thrones and they that set upon them
[1:14:34] and judgment was given unto them and I
[1:14:36] saw the souls of them that were beheaded
[1:14:38] for the witness of Jesus and for the
[1:14:40] word of God which had not worshiped the
[1:14:42] Beast neither his image neither had
[1:14:45] received the mark of their foreheads or
[1:14:47] in their hands now this is tribulation
[1:14:49] Saints of course and they lived and
[1:14:51] reigned with Christ A Thousand Years but
[1:14:55] the rest of the Dead live not again
[1:14:58] until the thousand years were finished
[1:15:01] this is the first resurrection you mean
[1:15:04] he can
[1:15:05] choose even which ones comes out the
[1:15:08] rest of the Dead live not till the
[1:15:11] thousand years were finished yes he can
[1:15:14] blessed and holy is he that ha part in
[1:15:16] the first resurrection for on such the
[1:15:19] second death has no power so is it fair
[1:15:23] for God to choose
[1:15:25] his own bride is it fair for God to
[1:15:28] raise in the first resurrection Those
[1:15:31] whom he
[1:15:32] fornew and chose them before the
[1:15:35] foundation of the
[1:15:37] world and you all said Romans chapter 9
[1:15:41] verse 7 neither because they are the
[1:15:44] Seed of Abraham are they all children
[1:15:46] but in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:15:50] that is they which are the children of
[1:15:51] the flesh these are not the children of
[1:15:54] God but the children of the promise are
[1:15:56] counted for the sea for This Is The Word
[1:15:59] of Promise at this time will I come and
[1:16:03] Sarah shall have a son not only this but
[1:16:06] when Rebecca also conceived by one even
[1:16:09] by Our Father Isaac for the children now
[1:16:12] listen carefully the children being not
[1:16:14] yet born neither having either done good
[1:16:18] or evil but that the purpose of God
[1:16:21] according to election might stand not of
[1:16:25] works but of him that cth it was said
[1:16:29] unto her the Elder Shall Serve the
[1:16:34] younger now here we're talking
[1:16:37] about a chosen man married to a chosen
[1:16:41] woman and they're going to have two sons
[1:16:44] twins but just because the father is
[1:16:47] chosen and the mother is chosen does it
[1:16:49] mean that every progeny of their Union
[1:16:52] will be chosen Now by natural Birthright
[1:16:55] the first firstborn would get a double
[1:16:58] portion of the inheritance but God said
[1:17:00] in this
[1:17:02] situation it will not be the Elder that
[1:17:05] will be my choice my choice will be the
[1:17:10] younger you say how could he do that he
[1:17:13] could look at Esau before Esau was ever
[1:17:16] born he could look at Jacob before Jacob
[1:17:18] was ever born he could see that Esau
[1:17:22] would trade his Birthright
[1:17:25] for a bowl of beans as we would say
[1:17:30] lentils so can you imagine he come in
[1:17:32] one day and Jacob had these
[1:17:35] lentils and Esau had been out hunting
[1:17:38] and he was hungry and he was thirsty and
[1:17:40] tired and Jacob
[1:17:44] said oh I I'll I'll I'll let you have
[1:17:47] this oh he so s I'm so hungry I'm so
[1:17:50] hungry let let me have it let me have it
[1:17:52] he said all right I'll do it
[1:17:55] let me have your birth right he the
[1:17:57] birth what difference does that make you
[1:18:00] see that was his attitude so what does
[1:18:02] the birthright type for us the baptism
[1:18:06] of the Holy
[1:18:08] Ghost so people like baptism of the Holy
[1:18:12] Ghost I belong to the church I put my
[1:18:15] name on the church that's why God will
[1:18:18] not let
[1:18:20] people who cling to a denomination or
[1:18:23] membership go in his Rapture because
[1:18:27] they care nothing about the
[1:18:30] birthright it's my mama was a Methodist
[1:18:33] my daddy was a Baptist it was good
[1:18:35] enough for them it's good enough for me
[1:18:37] oh but the Bible says repent and be
[1:18:39] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:18:40] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[1:18:43] gift of the Holy Ghost my church don't
[1:18:45] believe in the Holy
[1:18:47] Ghost you see what they're doing they're
[1:18:49] doing exactly the same thing that Esau
[1:18:53] did I don't need no Holy Ghost I'll
[1:18:55] never get up at no Alder you'll never
[1:18:57] see me shouting and jumping around like
[1:18:59] a a bunch of Holy Rollers why them
[1:19:02] people that go to that word of lie my
[1:19:04] goodness I heard some of them last night
[1:19:06] screaming and hollering even some of
[1:19:08] them young people was praising God oh
[1:19:11] that would embarrass me so much and yet
[1:19:13] some of them same people will go to a
[1:19:15] ball game and scream and holler and jump
[1:19:19] up and down
[1:19:22] wow so they'll do that for their
[1:19:25] team and won't even hardly do this for
[1:19:30] Jesus can't you see why he would not
[1:19:33] take a person like that to be his
[1:19:38] wife I wouldn't marry a woman like
[1:19:41] that can you imagine a woman wanting to
[1:19:45] be your wife and say don't you touch me
[1:19:48] don't you get close to me don't
[1:19:49] embarrass
[1:19:52] me don't you do that Jesus don't don't
[1:19:55] do
[1:19:57] that don't you anoint me in front of my
[1:20:00] friends and make me
[1:20:01] cry that's embarrassing Jesus the only
[1:20:05] reason It embarrasses you because you
[1:20:07] don't love him right if you loved him
[1:20:09] right you'd say whatever you want to do
[1:20:12] go ahead you want me to roll I'll roll
[1:20:15] you want me to scream I'll scream you
[1:20:17] want me to holl I don't care whatever
[1:20:18] you want me to do I'll do it I was lost
[1:20:21] and you found me I was blind and you
[1:20:23] opened my eyes I'll do whatever you want
[1:20:26] me to
[1:20:26] do but you see those who cherish their
[1:20:31] membership or what will the mayor think
[1:20:34] I don't care what the mayor thinks I
[1:20:37] don't need the mayor's approval to be
[1:20:39] able to preach like I did last night I
[1:20:41] don't need the governor's approval I
[1:20:43] don't need to call Mr Biden and ask him
[1:20:45] he probably wouldn't know anyway I'm not
[1:20:47] sure he even knows what world he's in
[1:20:48] from one day to the next to you I don't
[1:20:50] need his approval and to be honest with
[1:20:52] you I don't need yours I don't need need
[1:20:54] the approval of the deacons of the
[1:20:55] church the trustees of our church cuz
[1:20:57] the deacons of our church don't run this
[1:20:59] church praise the Lord the trustees of
[1:21:02] the church don't run this church we want
[1:21:04] the Holy Ghost to run our church so I
[1:21:07] want to please him don't you all I want
[1:21:09] to please him whatever he wants me to do
[1:21:11] if he wants us to scream one night and
[1:21:13] holler that night and then the next
[1:21:15] service we cry and oh we repent praise
[1:21:18] God if that's what he wants we want him
[1:21:20] to have his way will you see what that
[1:21:23] shows that shows that we want his
[1:21:28] headship so I wonder how many
[1:21:30] denominational Christians would say to
[1:21:32] Jesus Jesus if you want me to dance
[1:21:35] tonight I'll dance if you want me to go
[1:21:38] home and clean out my closet I'll get
[1:21:40] rid of all my slacks I'll never cut my
[1:21:42] hair again Lord I'll never drink another
[1:21:44] beer I'll Never Smoke another cigarette
[1:21:47] whatever you want me to
[1:21:50] do of course they
[1:21:52] won't but the bride will because she's
[1:21:55] married to him and now this is what God
[1:21:57] saw about Esau it was said unto her the
[1:22:01] Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is
[1:22:03] written Jacob have I
[1:22:06] loved but
[1:22:08] Esau have I
[1:22:10] hated now I know this sounds very very
[1:22:13] hard but there's one thing you want to
[1:22:15] keep in mind about the word hated the
[1:22:19] Hebrew of course is written the Old
[1:22:21] Testament was written in Hebrew and when
[1:22:23] you look at the word hated the Bible
[1:22:26] says that God
[1:22:27] saw that Leah was
[1:22:31] hated and that Rachel was
[1:22:34] loved now it seems as if though how in
[1:22:38] the world could Jacob do that but when
[1:22:40] you look at the Hebrew word it don't
[1:22:42] mean what we think
[1:22:45] hate but it simply means she was loved
[1:22:51] less now remember the scripture never
[1:22:53] contradicts itself
[1:22:55] John 3:16 tells us God so loved the
[1:22:59] world right that he gave his only
[1:23:01] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:23:03] him should not perish but have
[1:23:04] everlasting life but God does love the
[1:23:07] world but not in the same degree that he
[1:23:11] loves the
[1:23:13] bride praise the Lord now those of you
[1:23:16] that are married tonight no doubt you
[1:23:18] wives there's other brothers here in the
[1:23:19] church that you love I hope you don't
[1:23:22] love them the way you do your husband
[1:23:24] and the same for you brothers or maybe
[1:23:26] sisters in the church that you love them
[1:23:27] as sisters but you certainly don't feel
[1:23:29] the same way I love every one of you
[1:23:31] sisters tonight but there's one
[1:23:32] particular sister in here that whenever
[1:23:35] I'm done here in a little bit she goes
[1:23:37] home with me she has my name she has my
[1:23:40] checkbook she has a a key to every
[1:23:43] vehicle that I own she can drive
[1:23:45] whichever one she wants whenever she
[1:23:47] wants why she is my wife I love all the
[1:23:50] rest of you but don't come up to me and
[1:23:52] ask me for a spare key to my car don't
[1:23:55] ask me for a key to my truck because I
[1:23:57] ain't going to give it to you okay but I
[1:23:58] love you now honey I just don't love you
[1:24:01] the same way that I love her well you
[1:24:03] see that's the way God looks at the
[1:24:05] church and he looks at them and he says
[1:24:07] I do love you all I don't want you to Lo
[1:24:09] be lost it's not my will that any of you
[1:24:12] would perish but I see you all will
[1:24:16] never love me right you will never ever
[1:24:21] totally submit to me so I'll save you
[1:24:26] I'll even heal some of you I I'll move
[1:24:29] for you but pardon me while I really
[1:24:33] love on my
[1:24:35] wife cuz I love her so much I don't want
[1:24:39] her going through the tribulation I
[1:24:41] don't want her down here when all hell
[1:24:43] is breaking loose I love her so
[1:24:47] much as he got a right to do that oh
[1:24:50] yeah he does because he looks and sees
[1:24:54] what the church will be and he looks and
[1:24:56] sees what the bride will be and he says
[1:24:59] my bride I have
[1:25:02] loved and the church I love
[1:25:07] less because they love me
[1:25:12] less you see Jesus is a perfect
[1:25:14] gentleman we may look at it
[1:25:16] Sunday if you and I have invited to
[1:25:19] someone's
[1:25:20] house and they come to the door and let
[1:25:23] us in we knocked on the door rang the
[1:25:25] doorbell whatever it was and come on in
[1:25:27] come on
[1:25:28] in and then they said now
[1:25:31] listen you sit right
[1:25:33] there we're going to go in the kitchen
[1:25:36] and we're going to
[1:25:37] eat don't you get out of that
[1:25:40] chair you're not invited to
[1:25:43] supper you just sit right there and you
[1:25:45] be quiet don't be on your
[1:25:49] phone so they leave you 45 minutes hour
[1:25:54] they come
[1:25:56] back and they start just talking to one
[1:26:00] another start reading a book getting on
[1:26:02] their
[1:26:03] phone and you're sitting right there
[1:26:07] they don't talk to you they don't say
[1:26:09] how's your day been how you been doing
[1:26:12] how how's your family they just leave
[1:26:14] you sitting there and they
[1:26:17] intentionally ignore
[1:26:20] you after an hour or so one of them
[1:26:23] finally comes to you and said you can
[1:26:25] leave
[1:26:27] now we're fixing to get ready to go to
[1:26:29] bed and we really don't want to be
[1:26:31] troubled by
[1:26:33] you and you get up and say
[1:26:37] okay I I'll see
[1:26:39] yall yeah we want you to come back
[1:26:41] tomorrow night because we want to do you
[1:26:43] the same way that we did you
[1:26:48] tonight how many of us would go back to
[1:26:51] their house tomorrow
[1:26:53] night but you know what Jesus
[1:26:57] does many of the churches in our Tri
[1:27:01] Cities that's the way they treat
[1:27:03] him they'll stand up now we will have
[1:27:06] brothers so and so to invite the
[1:27:07] presence of God to come our gracious
[1:27:10] Heavenly Father we ask you to come in
[1:27:12] this place
[1:27:13] tonight but if anybody started getting a
[1:27:16] little bit emotional and even started
[1:27:19] reacting hey hey
[1:27:21] hey don't you start doing that Jesus we
[1:27:24] don't believe that stuff
[1:27:26] here and yet you know what he'll do
[1:27:29] he'll come
[1:27:31] service after
[1:27:34] service and they just leave him
[1:27:37] there they'll talk about him they'll use
[1:27:40] his
[1:27:44] name if that was
[1:27:47] me I'd go once I might even go
[1:27:52] twice probably after that I would never
[1:27:55] go back that's one of the many
[1:27:57] differences between me and God just one
[1:27:59] of the
[1:28:02] many but he goes back to our
[1:28:05] house he comes to our
[1:28:12] church and whenever we have
[1:28:15] time we talk to
[1:28:17] him and around all of our rest of our
[1:28:23] activities
[1:28:25] and he's so hungry for our
[1:28:28] love he's so hungry for our
[1:28:32] attention it's just like he would sit
[1:28:34] there and look at us like a little you
[1:28:36] know just like a little child or
[1:28:38] something that would sit there and just
[1:28:39] look and and look and see if you'd pay
[1:28:42] him any
[1:28:44] attention me traveling all over the
[1:28:46] world and you know being known all over
[1:28:49] the world and I don't say that to brag I
[1:28:51] just say it because it's a truth
[1:28:53] whenever I go out and all over the world
[1:28:55] and oh my goodness the people just for
[1:28:58] me to stop and shake their hand African
[1:29:00] Indian places like that photo photo
[1:29:03] photo they want a photo so everybody
[1:29:05] wants their picture with you you think
[1:29:07] you gave them $10,000 they want this
[1:29:09] ugly mug shot with me you know and just
[1:29:11] say oh my goodness oh my goodness those
[1:29:14] that come here and visit when they come
[1:29:16] back in my office all of them want a
[1:29:18] picture they want to send it to Africa
[1:29:21] last time somebody was back there month
[1:29:23] or so ago they took a picture picture of
[1:29:24] me I started getting it from Africa it
[1:29:26] went from here to Africa to India to
[1:29:28] Here There and there why because they
[1:29:32] like being
[1:29:33] identified with Servants of
[1:29:36] God it means something to them to stand
[1:29:38] beside a a man of God they have respect
[1:29:41] for and they want to be
[1:29:45] identified and I say
[1:29:50] Jesus we want selfies with you for sure
[1:29:53] at the day of judgment oh yeah oh yeah I
[1:29:56] want my picture with him oh man alive if
[1:29:59] my picture is with Jesus I I won't be
[1:30:03] L but I don't want him just on the day
[1:30:05] of
[1:30:08] judgment I want him a part of my life
[1:30:11] every day don't
[1:30:13] you no doubt there's been
[1:30:18] days I made him sit in a
[1:30:22] chair cuz I was just too
[1:30:27] busy if I was
[1:30:29] him I probably wouldn't have nothing to
[1:30:32] do with
[1:30:36] me I'm so glad I'm not him aren't
[1:30:40] you if you was him would you have
[1:30:43] anything to do with
[1:30:45] you the way we've treated
[1:30:49] him oh but I'm so glad that he come to
[1:30:52] the Earth to live in this old
[1:30:55] body he knows how these
[1:31:01] are and when you look at
[1:31:04] Jacob the prophet said that
[1:31:07] Esau morally was a better man than Jacob
[1:31:10] he was a liar a trickster a
[1:31:15] deceiver but God said I love
[1:31:19] him I love him and I choose
[1:31:22] him because he will wanted that birth
[1:31:26] right and that's the way we are there's
[1:31:29] something inside of us I believe
[1:31:32] sometimes Christians are some of the
[1:31:35] stupidest people that ever
[1:31:38] lived I tell Carol all the time sheep
[1:31:42] are the dumbest bunch of people that
[1:31:44] ever
[1:31:45] lived sheep as Christians we do some of
[1:31:49] the dumbest
[1:31:51] things come on don't sit down and look
[1:31:53] at me I'm talking about some of you I'm
[1:31:56] talking about
[1:31:58] me and yet God reaches to us and our
[1:32:03] stupidity in our
[1:32:06] ignorance how many of us have fell into
[1:32:08] the some the same traps over and over
[1:32:12] again come on let's be honest I mean
[1:32:15] just dumb stuff that we do with like
[1:32:19] ain't no way he'll forgive me but he
[1:32:22] does he
[1:32:25] does thank God for his
[1:32:27] Mercy thank God for his Mercy what does
[1:32:31] he want you continue doing that well of
[1:32:33] course not but he knows if he can get
[1:32:36] you to that place of
[1:32:38] victory that you will be like Jacob was
[1:32:40] it finally he'll be able to change your
[1:32:43] name till you'll no longer be Jacob but
[1:32:47] you'll be Israel that's what God saw
[1:32:50] about Jacob it wasn't just the ups and
[1:32:52] the downs and the ends in the outs and
[1:32:54] God oh my how can I tolerate that but
[1:32:57] God has the ability to look down here
[1:33:00] however far it is in the journey and God
[1:33:03] says if I can get him or her to that
[1:33:06] spot it will change them
[1:33:11] forever and God allowed this man to go
[1:33:15] over the brook one night when he's going
[1:33:17] to meet his brother the next
[1:33:19] morning and an angel of God which was
[1:33:22] God himself
[1:33:24] and a human appearance and Jacob Hears A
[1:33:27] noise in the bush and they said who are
[1:33:30] you no doubt
[1:33:33] scared and he saw him something moving
[1:33:36] in the
[1:33:37] shadows but it grabbed a hold of him and
[1:33:41] they wrestled and they wrestled and the
[1:33:43] angel said let me go he said what's your
[1:33:46] name why did you asked me my name saying
[1:33:49] it's a
[1:33:50] secret and he said what's your name he
[1:33:52] said my name
[1:33:54] is deceiver
[1:33:57] Jacob Hallelujah and the angel said let
[1:34:00] me go can you imagine a man having such
[1:34:04] a hold on an
[1:34:06] angel that the angel asked for
[1:34:09] deliverance it was a condensation of God
[1:34:12] that placed himself in a human form that
[1:34:15] a human could could grab a hold of God
[1:34:20] don't you understand he's done each of
[1:34:21] you the same way he come down to you in
[1:34:26] such a way that you could grab a hold of
[1:34:28] him in such a
[1:34:30] way and you've got such a hold on him
[1:34:33] tonight that he will never let you
[1:34:38] go Hallelujah he said let me go for the
[1:34:42] day breaks he said I will not let you go
[1:34:46] till you bless
[1:34:48] me you know the story well that's the
[1:34:52] old that was the time God was waiting
[1:34:55] for he put up with all this nonsense all
[1:34:58] these failures all these mistakes
[1:35:00] waiting for that change right there
[1:35:04] that's why he has Mercy on us because he
[1:35:08] knows tonight tomorrow Sunday maybe
[1:35:11] Monday you're going to get it yes he
[1:35:15] sees it he knows it he's not guessing is
[1:35:19] not open he knows every elect member
[1:35:23] will get it and it will be impossible
[1:35:27] for them to be
[1:35:29] lost what should we say in it is your
[1:35:31] unrighteousness with God God forbid for
[1:35:34] he saith to Moses I will have mercy on
[1:35:36] whom I will have mercy I will have
[1:35:39] compassion on whom I will have
[1:35:42] compassion so then is not him that will
[1:35:44] us nor him that run us but of God that
[1:35:47] show us Mercy for the scripture saith
[1:35:50] unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose
[1:35:52] have I raised thee up that I might show
[1:35:54] my power in thee and that my name might
[1:35:57] be declared throughout all the Earth
[1:36:00] therefore hath he Mercy on whom he will
[1:36:02] have mercy and whom he will he Harden us
[1:36:06] how could the bible say that God
[1:36:08] hardened Pharaoh's heart God knew if he
[1:36:12] give Pharaoh a thousand chances 10,000
[1:36:15] chances a million chances Pharaoh would
[1:36:19] still turn him
[1:36:21] down God knew that
[1:36:24] so God could Harden his heart because he
[1:36:27] knew it's amazing when you read these
[1:36:29] instan in the scripture that the Bible
[1:36:31] would say God hardened his heart and
[1:36:33] then it would say Pharaoh hardened his
[1:36:35] heart don't you see what was happening
[1:36:38] God was only doing the exact same thing
[1:36:41] to Pharaoh that Pharaoh was doing you
[1:36:43] understand why God turns people over to
[1:36:45] reprobate mind that's the path they
[1:36:49] choose that's the path they want this is
[1:36:53] why it's so important that we make the
[1:36:54] right choice we choose him we want right
[1:36:57] then what does God do God gives us what
[1:37:00] we want oh Hallelujah God gives us what
[1:37:03] we want Jacob wanted a chains God gave
[1:37:05] him a chains Pharaoh wanted a hardness
[1:37:08] of his heart God said fine that's what
[1:37:09] you want that's what I'll give you you
[1:37:12] want church membership that's exactly
[1:37:14] what God will give you but if you want
[1:37:16] the birthright and you say I don't want
[1:37:18] to just belong to Word of Life I don't
[1:37:20] want to just be part of the use of word
[1:37:22] of life I I want that Birthright I want
[1:37:25] to know beyond the shadow of a doubt
[1:37:27] I've got the Holy Ghost the token is in
[1:37:29] my soul when the Rapture takes place I
[1:37:32] will not be left and if brother Donnie
[1:37:35] stands up there and says well glory to
[1:37:37] God there's only going to be one person
[1:37:38] for Word of Life leaving you can jump to
[1:37:41] your feet and say I hate to tell you
[1:37:43] brother Donnie but it's going to be me
[1:37:46] God wants you to know in such a real way
[1:37:49] that if there ain't but one leaving in
[1:37:51] this church it's going to be you
[1:37:55] praise God so that will say then unto me
[1:37:58] why does he yet find fault for who ha
[1:38:01] resisted his will now Paul knew this
[1:38:03] sovereignty of God would be questioned
[1:38:06] down Through the Ages nay but oh man who
[1:38:08] art thou that repliest against God shall
[1:38:11] the thing formed say to him that formed
[1:38:15] it why have you made me thus has not the
[1:38:18] Potter power over the clay of the same
[1:38:20] lump to make one vessel unto honor and
[1:38:23] another unto dishonor what if God
[1:38:26] willing to show his rest and to make his
[1:38:29] power known ured with much long
[1:38:34] suffering the vessels of rest fitted to
[1:38:39] destruction do you understand that's
[1:38:41] what God is doing to all these Sinners
[1:38:44] out here these reprobates that he knows
[1:38:46] will never serve him they will never
[1:38:49] live for him he is enduring them
[1:38:54] he is putting up with them he already
[1:38:57] knows their end he knows what they'll do
[1:39:01] but he will let them live out their
[1:39:04] choice oh my but I love this next part
[1:39:07] and we're going to
[1:39:10] close and that he might make
[1:39:13] known The Riches of his
[1:39:16] glory on the
[1:39:19] vessels of
[1:39:22] Mercy the the vessels of Mercy notice
[1:39:26] the two different types of vessels in
[1:39:28] verse
[1:39:28] 22 and verse 23 one is identified as a
[1:39:33] vessel of
[1:39:35] Wrath and the others are
[1:39:38] identified as vessels of Mercy on which
[1:39:42] he a four
[1:39:44] prepared unto
[1:39:47] Glory I trust every one of us here
[1:39:50] tonight are one of those vessels of
[1:39:52] Mercy
[1:39:54] and let me just say this to you but
[1:39:56] brother Donnie what if I'm not elect
[1:39:59] brother Donnie do you know beyond the
[1:40:01] shadow of a doubt that you are
[1:40:05] elect y'all ready for my
[1:40:07] answer no I do not know beyond a shadow
[1:40:11] of a
[1:40:15] doubt oh brother Donnie we we just knew
[1:40:18] you were
[1:40:19] bride I believe I am I believe the token
[1:40:24] I have the token and if I do I am his
[1:40:28] elect do I see myself in the word yes
[1:40:32] but does the devil still come to me and
[1:40:34] say oh you know you ain't one why you
[1:40:38] know you ain't never been good enough
[1:40:41] you can never do this you can never be
[1:40:43] like this brother that brother the other
[1:40:46] brother you mean the devil bothers you
[1:40:48] with that stuff oh
[1:40:52] yeah whether or not you believe it the
[1:40:55] devil still comes to me and tells me now
[1:40:58] you know there really ain't no
[1:41:03] God cuz you can't really prove him by SS
[1:41:08] you know that he can't be
[1:41:11] proved and I'll come right back well I
[1:41:13] know I can't prove him by science but I
[1:41:15] was there when it happened and I know it
[1:41:18] happened to me and that sure didn't
[1:41:20] happen out of evolution I didn't become
[1:41:22] like this I come from a polywog to a
[1:41:25] frog and then from something else to
[1:41:26] something else and all of a sudden I
[1:41:28] become a man so can I prove God by
[1:41:30] science no can I prove that I'm bride
[1:41:33] because I shout jump run preach whatever
[1:41:36] more I can't but I believe with all of
[1:41:39] my soul I am but let me tell you the way
[1:41:42] I approach it even if I'm
[1:41:45] not he will not cast me into hell cuz I
[1:41:49] don't want to go
[1:41:51] there I love him and the prophet told us
[1:41:54] if you want to be saved God is
[1:41:58] obligated to make a way for
[1:42:01] you but let me just tell you how I feel
[1:42:03] from my heart now close I don't think
[1:42:06] there's any way on this Earth I could
[1:42:09] love him the way I
[1:42:11] do and not be
[1:42:15] bright because I love him more than I
[1:42:17] love
[1:42:19] life
[1:42:21] Hallelujah you can look at yourself and
[1:42:24] ask what do you love most of
[1:42:29] all and judge yourself by this if the
[1:42:32] Lord Jesus come to each of you tonight
[1:42:34] after this service and said I'm going to
[1:42:37] give you 30
[1:42:38] days you can do anything you want for
[1:42:42] the next 30 days lie cheat steal commit
[1:42:47] adultery rob banks you know do whatever
[1:42:51] do whatever you want at the end end of
[1:42:53] those 30 days I will forgive you it'll
[1:42:56] never be remembered I'll never mention
[1:42:59] it to you
[1:43:01] again I think about
[1:43:04] that what would you
[1:43:08] do and the way you would answer me
[1:43:11] tonight from your soul I'll have a
[1:43:14] pretty good
[1:43:16] idea if you've got the holy ghost or
[1:43:19] not if God were to come to me tonight
[1:43:23] and tell me that first of all it would
[1:43:25] scare me to death cuz I think Lord do
[1:43:29] you see something in me do you would see
[1:43:32] something in me that I that I would want
[1:43:36] wrong but I'll tell you what I do I'd
[1:43:39] pray I'd read my Bible more every day
[1:43:42] than I do now I'd listen to more tapes
[1:43:44] than I'd do now because i' think oh my
[1:43:46] goodness oh my goodness 30 days oh oh 30
[1:43:48] days I'm on this trial I I don't want
[1:43:50] him to think I want anything other than
[1:43:54] him you understand what I'm to say it do
[1:43:56] you understand a mortal cannot feel that
[1:43:59] way unless they've been
[1:44:03] changed unless they've been
[1:44:05] changed a person a saved person can be
[1:44:09] saved and love the Lord and if that
[1:44:11] offer was offered to a saved person many
[1:44:15] of them would take it even offered to
[1:44:19] sanctified people they would take it
[1:44:24] because that snake is still in their
[1:44:27] heart the only people with the power to
[1:44:31] turn that down would be those who've had
[1:44:34] the snake taken out remember when
[1:44:37] brother R preached the future home and
[1:44:38] he draw two human hearts and he draw a
[1:44:41] dove inside of one and a snake inside of
[1:44:45] the other now he said this one has the
[1:44:47] Holy Ghost and this one doesn't only
[1:44:50] those with the Holy Ghost of their
[1:44:51] hearts would have have the ability to
[1:44:54] say no father I don't want sin I don't
[1:44:58] want
[1:45:00] unrighteousness I want
[1:45:03] you amen let's bow it
[1:45:12] together Lord Jesus I want to thank you
[1:45:15] for these special
[1:45:17] times that we can have together like
[1:45:20] this I I can't say that I understand
[1:45:23] what the difference is
[1:45:25] in regular service that we
[1:45:29] have but somehow it just feels so
[1:45:34] special your presence has been with us
[1:45:36] through every one of these question
[1:45:38] answer
[1:45:39] services and we want you to know we're
[1:45:42] so
[1:45:43] grateful we're so
[1:45:46] thankful we love feeling your presence
[1:45:50] sensing that you're near us Lord
[1:45:54] I pray that you'd help us
[1:45:56] to think and contemplate these things
[1:46:00] that have been said tonight
[1:46:02] father maybe it'll answer the question
[1:46:05] on somebody else's heart as well maybe
[1:46:08] they thought about it and pondered about
[1:46:10] it Lord we don't want to
[1:46:13] be any of those
[1:46:16] people that would choose the
[1:46:18] world we don't want to be any of those
[1:46:21] Christians are they Christians
[1:46:22] Christians yes we would say they
[1:46:26] were that would set you in the
[1:46:29] corner of their
[1:46:31] life and they go on and live the way
[1:46:33] they want to and act the way they want
[1:46:36] to and they leave you sitting there
[1:46:39] humiliated and
[1:46:43] embarrassed Jesus forgive
[1:46:46] me forgive me Lord
[1:46:51] God forgive me for any day of my life
[1:46:56] that I've ever done you that
[1:46:58] way forgive me
[1:47:01] Lord I want you to be a part of
[1:47:03] everything that I
[1:47:05] am Hallelujah
[1:47:07] Jesus May every young person may every
[1:47:10] other person that'll hear this
[1:47:16] service I believe Lord by you leading me
[1:47:18] that way tonight I could see it as it
[1:47:20] struck their
[1:47:21] hearts I saw it Lord on the countenance
[1:47:25] of many of their
[1:47:26] faces it was like for the first time
[1:47:29] they saw
[1:47:31] it and they saw that you want to be a
[1:47:34] part of our everyday life whether we're
[1:47:37] studying for a test or we're doing our
[1:47:40] job or whatever it is that we're doing

[1:47:46] yourself you want to be part of our
[1:47:48] friends as a matter of fact you want to
[1:47:51] choose our friends for us

[1:50:30] they should
[1:50:31] be but Lord we want

[1:51:02] the anointing was moving so
[1:51:05] wonderful and I looked over toward the
[1:51:07] direction where Harry was sitting on the
[1:51:11] organ and I saw an angel standing

[1:59:07] [Applause]
[1:59:10] I I'm lost without
[1:59:18] you
[1:59:20] amen would you enjoy that
[1:59:23] tonight I never I never have ever
[1:59:25] questioned election
[1:59:27] um election to me you know brother
[1:59:29] brandom made that plain when he when he
[1:59:32] said you were in God's thoughts before
[1:59:34] the foundation of the
[1:59:36] world God you are expressed thought of
[1:59:39] God but I always always wondered and I
[1:59:43] could never grasp the scripture where
[1:59:46] Jesus tells them is that their eyes were
[1:59:48] blinded unless they believe and be
[1:59:51] saved as brother is the the question was
[1:59:53] asked tonight how is it fair and the
[1:59:56] Bible says that God is a just God means
[1:59:59] god is a fair God he's not unjust he's
[2:00:02] not unfair so we look at that and for
[2:00:05] years that bothered me he's a just God
[2:00:07] but yet he's blinding
[2:00:09] eyes
[2:00:11] L and then you
[2:00:13] realize it's by forn
[2:00:16] knowledge he knew that those that He
[2:00:18] blinded the eyes lest they believe and
[2:00:21] be saved
[2:00:22] they will be given that
[2:00:24] opportunity after the first resurrection
[2:00:26] after the Thousand
[2:00:28] Years but you look at at what he gave
[2:00:31] you that person is only going to get one
[2:00:34] offered one
[2:00:36] time but to you and me offered he's
[2:00:39] offering the Holy Ghost to you time and
[2:00:41] time again brother brandom said it's a
[2:00:43] free gift it is a free gift and he keeps
[2:00:45] holding it out offering it to you I had
[2:00:48] a young man tell me sometime last year
[2:00:51] we was talking about the scriptures and
[2:00:52] I and I to told him we was talking
[2:00:55] about the B how Matthew it says in
[2:00:57] Matthew that the holy spirit will lead
[2:00:59] you into all
[2:01:00] truth and he said oh that was just for
[2:01:02] the
[2:01:04] disciples I said well how do we get
[2:01:07] Revelation it's black and white it's
[2:01:09] written there on the paper it's black
[2:01:11] and
[2:01:12] white that's how he got Revelation was
[2:01:15] through reading it off a page without
[2:01:17] the Holy
[2:01:18] Ghost and I got to thinking if if if the
[2:01:21] Holy Ghost was the disciples what was
[2:01:24] that that was getting through me through
[2:01:26] that
[2:01:26] trial time and time
[2:01:29] again what gets you through the things
[2:01:32] in in your life it's not human willpower
[2:01:35] God allows you to go through some things
[2:01:36] that human willpower will never ever get
[2:01:39] you through it takes the Holy
[2:01:43] Ghost and he's a just God he's a fair
[2:01:47] God I so enjoy that whoever wrote that
[2:01:50] question thank than
[2:01:52] you he's he's
[2:01:55] Fair the Bible says he's not
[2:01:57] unfair and it really doesn't explain why
[2:02:00] he's not unfair but it says he's Fair
[2:02:03] that's good enough for
[2:02:05] me so I hope y'all enjoyed that tonight
[2:02:08] if you will let's give brother Donnie a
[2:02:09] hand that was
[2:02:14] wonderful so be praying for service
