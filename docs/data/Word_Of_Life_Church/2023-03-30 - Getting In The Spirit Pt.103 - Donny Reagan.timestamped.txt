[45:58] do you
[46:00] going to church loving him serving him
[46:02] not ought to let us know though what a

[46:36] we'll just leave them we'll take them or
[46:38] you take them all right okay
[46:42] First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 7.
[46:48] let's listen at the great master builder
[46:51] now
[46:53] I believe the Lord
[46:55] truly had a church in the book of Acts
[46:58] the way he wanted
[47:00] a church that he himself founded
[47:03] and he gave the plans
[47:05] to his god-called men in that day
[47:09] Paul calls himself the master builder
[47:13] that word is octuron which is an
[47:17] architect
[47:18] an architect
[47:20] so Peter never
[47:22] claimed that he was nor did James nor
[47:25] John
[47:27] so there must have been something
[47:28] special that God gave to Paul
[47:31] First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 7.
[47:34] so then neither is he that planteth
[47:37] anything
[47:39] neither he that watereth
[47:41] but God that giveth the increase
[47:45] now he that planteth and he that
[47:47] wadereth are one
[47:50] and every man shall receive of his own
[47:53] reward
[47:55] according to his own labor now remember
[47:59] our reward is not based upon just grace
[48:01] alone what God gives us but reward is
[48:06] based on labor what we do is what God
[48:09] gives us
[48:10] and listen to astounding verse for we
[48:13] are laborers together
[48:17] with God now here he's speaking about
[48:20] the ministry we are laborers together
[48:23] with God and the word labor is helper
[48:27] fellow worker
[48:29] companion in labor
[48:33] we are laborers together with God and ye
[48:36] are God's husband
[48:40] God's husbandry ye are God's Building
[48:45] and the word husbandry is land that has
[48:49] been tilled land that has been warped to
[48:53] be able to receive the seed
[48:55] second Corinthians chapter six
[48:57] verse 1.
[48:59] weeds in as workers together with him
[49:04] beseech you also that you receive not
[49:08] the grace of God in vain workers
[49:12] together
[49:13] with him
[49:15] I mean a lot to be remembered tonight as
[49:17] we pray before the Lord
[49:19] Heavenly Father we're so grateful that
[49:21] we can be gathered together here tonight
[49:23] Lord we counted an honor a privilege
[49:26] near Jesus that we could assemble and
[49:28] sing and worship and pray and raise our
[49:31] hands and lift our voices and just be a
[49:34] witness just to let hell know we've come
[49:37] here tonight to praise God
[49:39] as your word tells us for forsake not
[49:42] the assignment of yourselves together as
[49:44] a manner of some is that's not our
[49:47] manner our manner is to be able to come
[49:50] together with the people of God not on a
[49:52] gift but to give we're here to give back
[49:55] to you praise and love so we're asking
[49:59] that should help us tonight as we look
[50:00] into the word help me Jesus I can get
[50:03] out of the way speak through me I pray
[50:06] in Jesus name amen God bless you you may
[50:10] be seated
[50:15] there is absolutely no higher honor
[50:19] that could be bestowed upon any man
[50:23] in this life
[50:25] then to be reckoned as being a labor
[50:29] with God
[50:31] in the same field
[50:33] doing the same things
[50:35] having the same plan
[50:39] the same designer the same architect
[50:42] for one goal one motive one purpose
[50:46] not a private Personal Agenda on your
[50:49] own but to be identified as a laborer
[50:52] with him every one of us not just
[50:56] preachers of course in the ministry but
[50:58] every one of us have something that we
[51:01] can do and the thing for us to do is go
[51:03] to him who brought us here and ask him
[51:06] Lord what can I do what should I do what
[51:10] can I be able to benefit the body and
[51:13] being able to minister to the body so as
[51:17] God's husbandry your part is going to be
[51:20] more as the cultivated field than the
[51:25] seed no matter how wonderful precious
[51:27] powerful that it is with life it cannot
[51:30] grow without being in the right type of
[51:33] soil and we all aware that there are
[51:35] many people that will hear the gospel
[51:37] they will hear the truth present date
[51:39] truth and because their soul is not the
[51:43] right type of ground it'll never bring
[51:45] forth and for fruition it'll never
[51:47] multiply never grow they'll go for a
[51:50] while then they go right back out into
[51:51] the world they'll go for a while get
[51:53] cold backslide or just accept a little
[51:57] occasion or something was God a little
[51:59] bit of religion that makes them feel
[52:01] pretty good but for the bride she's
[52:04] actually called the husbandry so she is
[52:08] the cultivated field by which God sows
[52:12] it now according to what Paul says
[52:14] you're in First Corinthians 3 10.
[52:16] according to the grace of God which is
[52:18] given unto me as a wise master builder
[52:23] now some people might consider this to
[52:25] be bragging and that Paul was sure was
[52:28] speaking pretty highly of himself but I
[52:31] think myself this was necessary for Paul
[52:34] be able to lay out to the Corinthian
[52:37] Church what God had revealed to him now
[52:40] remember the Lord tells him about the
[52:42] city of Corinth that I have much people
[52:45] in this city and the Corinthian Church
[52:48] was a very carnal Church the first
[52:51] letter is filled with one rebuke after
[52:54] another because they're living all kinds
[52:57] of lives and it was a major port city
[53:00] basically a Greek it was a Melting Pot
[53:03] so like we'd say of New York so they had
[53:06] all types of classes and cultures of
[53:08] people who live there one of the big
[53:11] main worshipers places for astarti also
[53:14] Zeus a lot of the different gods and
[53:17] goddesses so there was anything and
[53:19] everything that you can imagine and the
[53:22] Christians that were there the church
[53:24] that was there was made up predominantly
[53:26] of Gentile Believers and when they came
[53:28] to the Lord they still was not quite
[53:31] washed now don't be too hard on them
[53:33] because remember they did not have the
[53:36] New Testament put together the way you
[53:38] and I do many of them did not even have
[53:40] the Old Testament well they could go
[53:42] back and read psalms and Proverbs and
[53:44] song with Solomon they certainly had had
[53:46] no types and no books so it's not like
[53:48] that they had all these volumes and
[53:50] libraries to know what to do so much of
[53:54] especially First Corinthians is Paul
[53:56] dealing with a bunch of issues that was
[53:59] in the Corinthian Church but Paul also
[54:01] knows that his ministry is going to go
[54:04] on for the ages that is to come so it's
[54:07] not just writing to them there so much
[54:09] of what we see in especially First
[54:12] Corinthians is issues that was in the
[54:14] church so there was sin of the church
[54:16] there was sexual sins it had all kinds
[54:19] of problems with the gifts had all kinds
[54:21] of problems with people who wanted to
[54:23] magnify the spiritual aspect of speaking
[54:26] in tongues prophecy things like that and
[54:29] yet for many of them they didn't even
[54:31] understand love so Paul had to go
[54:33] through the basic understanding of love
[54:35] now he's having to lay out to them about
[54:38] the order of the ministry in the body
[54:41] now as the wise master builder he's
[54:44] going to have an understanding about the
[54:46] ministry that probably some other
[54:48] ministers won't even have themselves now
[54:51] listen how he addresses this as a wise
[54:54] master builder I have laid the
[54:57] foundation and another build us thereon
[55:00] but let every man take heed how he build
[55:05] us thereon now listen to this carefully
[55:08] every man that is a Christian Builder
[55:12] now this will include denominations this
[55:16] will include every man who claims he's a
[55:19] preacher and claims he's building on the
[55:24] foundation of Jesus Christ now many men
[55:28] are actually on the the substrate or the
[55:32] foundation of Christianity and they will
[55:36] let you know right up front they are not
[55:38] building on the gods of Islam they're
[55:41] not building on the gods of Hinduism or
[55:44] taoism or communism something they'll
[55:46] let you know right up front that they
[55:48] believe Jesus Christ died for the
[55:50] ungodly they believed that God so loved
[55:52] the world he gave his only begotten son
[55:54] and they will say that's my Foundation
[55:56] now listen to me carefully so you don't
[55:58] misunderstand and Paul actually knew
[56:01] that there would be thousands times
[56:03] thousands of these types of Builders and
[56:07] they would profess that they were
[56:09] building on Jesus Christ so here Paul
[56:12] warns them all right now you men every
[56:16] one of you preachers you get this in
[56:18] your mind and take heed wow so if they
[56:23] were not actually building on part of
[56:26] the foundation that Paul laid Paul would
[56:29] just say I I ain't worried about you no
[56:31] way hey I'm you're false you're in the
[56:33] error you ain't going to bring no no
[56:35] detriment at all to the gospel but Paul
[56:37] knew they named The Name of Jesus and he
[56:41] knew that many of them because they
[56:43] would build on the foundation stone of
[56:46] Christianity so they're not building on
[56:49] an Old Testament principle alone they're
[56:51] not building on just a denominational
[56:54] Doctrine because even them say they
[56:56] believe in the cross and the power of
[56:58] the blood so here Paul is now warning
[57:01] then every preacher so listen what he
[57:04] says that every man to take heed now
[57:09] notice his warning let every man take
[57:11] heed how he build us
[57:15] thereupama so Paul never separated them
[57:19] the so-called gospel preachers that
[57:23] would build wood hay or stubble on the
[57:27] foundation of Christianity so what is
[57:30] the foundation then of all Christian
[57:33] churches they will say of course it's
[57:35] Christ Jesus it's God so loved the world
[57:37] it said he came to the world to save
[57:40] Sinners of whom I am chief and they'll
[57:42] say oh yes we believe in the blood we
[57:44] believe in the cross we believe in the
[57:46] transforming power to change the light
[57:48] so Paul did not recount that or deny
[57:51] that but Paul said all right I'll give
[57:53] you that credit so you say you are
[57:56] building on the foundation of Christ so
[57:59] let me go a little farther he said and
[58:01] give you a warning
[58:04] that you need to take heed what you are
[58:07] going to build on this Foundation of
[58:11] Christianity so now to settle this
[58:13] before any go any farther is it possible
[58:16] then that a preacher
[58:19] can build wood hay stubble on the
[58:24] foundation of Christianity and what he
[58:27] builds is totally error
[58:31] he will spend years of his life
[58:34] he will labor he will study he will pray
[58:39] he will do all sorts of things but yet
[58:42] the materials that he is using is
[58:46] incorrect but the foundation itself is
[58:50] true
[58:51] so what is the foundation brother the
[58:53] foundation is Christianity now we know
[58:56] the Old Testament they've done exactly
[58:58] the same thing so they took the law that
[59:01] God gave Moses and then they begin to
[59:04] add things to it so by the time Jesus
[59:07] got there a man could divorce his wife
[59:10] for burning his supper
[59:14] man Carol wouldn't have lasted about
[59:16] three or four months after we got
[59:18] married
[59:19] because bless her little darling heart
[59:20] she was cooking black and cajun before
[59:23] it was ever known about
[59:27] but I put up with them I'm gonna tell
[59:29] you one thing she's turned into an
[59:30] awesome cook
[59:31] so you can imagine how the law never
[59:34] said a man could put away his wife for
[59:37] that reason a man could put away his
[59:39] wife by the time Jesus got there if his
[59:43] wife raised her voice to his mother or
[59:47] even if he looked at a younger woman and
[59:50] wanted her then he could put away his
[59:53] wife for any cause or just about that
[59:56] bad in the message anymore
[59:58] so Moses never taught that but they took
[1:00:02] the foundation of the law and began to
[1:00:06] add their own ideas to it and build on
[1:00:09] that by the time Jesus got there it had
[1:00:11] eroded to the spot that we read on
[1:00:13] Sunday morning where the disciples
[1:00:15] themselves and most of them if you don't
[1:00:17] know it they were of the Pharisee group
[1:00:19] so the Pharisees taught that sin before
[1:00:22] you were ever born which is absolutely
[1:00:25] absurd that the blind man in John 9 and
[1:00:28] they asked Jesus the question who sinned
[1:00:30] him or his parents that he was born
[1:00:33] blind anybody in their right mind should
[1:00:36] know the answer to that how in the world
[1:00:38] could you sin before you were born but
[1:00:40] you see they had eroded so far from the
[1:00:43] truth by the time Jesus got here that's
[1:00:46] where it was but yet they would go back
[1:00:48] and say but we are Moses disciples so
[1:00:52] you see Christianity then after 2 000
[1:00:55] years Christianity has eroded to the the
[1:00:59] spot even worse now than it was in the
[1:01:02] days of the Lord Jesus so Paul feels the
[1:01:06] necessity to warn every man that claims
[1:01:10] to be a god-called pastor a god-called
[1:01:13] teacher a god-called evangelist that he
[1:01:16] would build erroneous teaching ideology
[1:01:20] all kinds of things that are not gold
[1:01:23] they are not silver and they are not
[1:01:26] precious gems but they are wood hay and
[1:01:30] stubble now Paul preaches something
[1:01:33] about this that of course I had a really
[1:01:35] hard time with whenever I was a
[1:01:37] Pentecostal because I read the book of
[1:01:39] Corinthians a lot and whenever I would
[1:01:41] run across this being a Pentecostal I
[1:01:44] couldn't understand him so I never
[1:01:46] preached it one time when I was a
[1:01:48] Pentecostal preacher and that was that
[1:01:51] Paul said that if a man will build on
[1:01:54] this Foundation of Christianity would
[1:01:57] hay or stubble that the fire one day
[1:02:00] will try every preacher's work
[1:02:04] and if his work does not stand the fire
[1:02:07] then his work will be burned up but he
[1:02:11] himself will be saved
[1:02:13] now you understand that there's a
[1:02:15] difference in being saved and being
[1:02:18] called to be a preacher I mean he knows
[1:02:20] that so being called to be a preacher
[1:02:22] has nothing to do with being saved a
[1:02:24] matter of fact it's two separate things
[1:02:26] so a person can be saved and yet lose
[1:02:30] every one of their works
[1:02:35] well you said where's Bible for that uh
[1:02:38] man in the name and the Bible by the
[1:02:40] name of Mr Lott
[1:02:42] he lost everything that he had lost
[1:02:45] everything by fire yet he himself was
[1:02:48] saved is that right
[1:02:50] so Paul feels the need to warn them not
[1:02:55] just the preachers in this day but every
[1:02:57] other preacher that would come notice
[1:02:59] again in first Timothy 4 15 he said
[1:03:01] meditate upon these things and give
[1:03:04] thyself holy to them that thou profiting
[1:03:08] may appear to all notice verse 16 take
[1:03:12] heed unto thyself
[1:03:15] and unto the doctrine continue in them
[1:03:19] for in doing this Thou shalt both save
[1:03:23] thyself and them that hear them now here
[1:03:27] Paul is writing to his son in the gospel
[1:03:30] but yet he felt the need to warn Timothy
[1:03:35] to take heed to be Careful What doctrine
[1:03:40] that he preaches what he stands for and
[1:03:43] what he promotes now Paul knows he's not
[1:03:46] going to live much longer by the time
[1:03:48] this is written he's very close now to
[1:03:50] being offered so he wants to give
[1:03:52] Timothy Titus and these other Brethren a
[1:03:56] good sound Doctrine and good
[1:03:58] understanding and also a warning because
[1:04:02] he believed that God would take him and
[1:04:05] these men would carry on with that same
[1:04:07] word so he wants to instill in them not
[1:04:10] just correct water baptism but he wants
[1:04:13] to instill in them the structure of the
[1:04:16] church and the structure of how the
[1:04:18] church would continue on because they'd
[1:04:21] come to the spot now to where they
[1:04:23] realized Jesus was not going to come in
[1:04:26] their generation he they realized that
[1:04:28] Jesus was going to tarry for many many
[1:04:31] years I'm glad they realized that I'm
[1:04:34] glad they moved beyond the basic
[1:04:36] understanding of what most of them had
[1:04:38] when the apostolic church first started
[1:04:40] because if they hadn't we'll only have
[1:04:43] the basic principles of how to know how
[1:04:45] to get saved but I'm glad they had an
[1:04:47] understanding you got to have a church
[1:04:49] with substantial Foundation doctrines I
[1:04:52] know a lot of folks don't like Doctrine
[1:04:54] but you got to have Doctrine to be a
[1:04:55] church
[1:04:57] so he wanted to encourage them to be
[1:05:00] able to understand this now notice he
[1:05:02] said take heed unto thyself and unto the
[1:05:05] doctrine now not just salvation but the
[1:05:07] doctrine so Doctrine is important and
[1:05:10] continue in them the doctrine and in
[1:05:13] doing this Thou shalt both save thyself
[1:05:15] and them that hear thee notice First
[1:05:18] Corinthians 4 13. he says being defamed
[1:05:22] we Intrigue we are made as the filth of
[1:05:27] the world and are the off scouring of
[1:05:31] all things unto this day I write not
[1:05:34] these things to shame you but as my
[1:05:38] beloved Sons I warn you
[1:05:42] now here Paul again is writing to those
[1:05:45] in the city of Corinth but also those
[1:05:48] that are ministering because he has
[1:05:51] begotten them to Christ through the
[1:05:54] gospel he was a father not Peter in the
[1:05:57] sense of a pope but a father which had
[1:06:01] begotten them by the word now they know
[1:06:04] every preacher does not have the ability
[1:06:07] to beget children to God
[1:06:10] somebody's going to look at me funny
[1:06:13] every preacher does not have the ability
[1:06:16] to produce new births you see a man
[1:06:21] who's not born again himself cannot lead
[1:06:23] you to eternal life
[1:06:25] so many preachers are not actually
[1:06:28] bringing people to birth they're
[1:06:30] bringing them to a confession I accept
[1:06:32] Jesus as my savior and they will present
[1:06:35] many people at that day that were saved
[1:06:38] people but not truly born again
[1:06:42] oh you're saying no wait a minute
[1:06:43] brother Donnie I've got to have
[1:06:44] scripture for that well I knew you would
[1:06:46] that's why I have one prepared for you
[1:06:49] all right not these things to shame you
[1:06:51] but it's my beloved Sons I warn you for
[1:06:56] though you have ten thousand instructors
[1:07:00] in Christ so ten thousand rabbis ten
[1:07:05] thousand teachers ten thousand
[1:07:08] instructors in Christ yet have you not
[1:07:11] many fathers
[1:07:14] so you might have ten thousand preachers
[1:07:17] that could preach Doctrine and they
[1:07:20] could go through and boy quote you Greek
[1:07:22] words and Aramaic Enlighten and Hebrew
[1:07:24] and all that sort of thing and yet not
[1:07:27] be able to produce one birth in a
[1:07:30] six-week Revival
[1:07:33] now you see this is why it's so
[1:07:35] important friends
[1:07:36] that men that are called of God not only
[1:07:39] to preach but they are also called to
[1:07:43] produce new births you see this is why
[1:07:47] some preachers do not have the ability
[1:07:49] to make their Ministry grow on its own
[1:07:53] so what did they do proselyte others at
[1:07:56] the end of the service here Wednesday
[1:07:58] night one of the sisters come up for
[1:07:59] prayer and she told me brother Donnie
[1:08:02] What You Preach here tonight just
[1:08:04] happened in my father's Church her
[1:08:07] father's church is in another country I
[1:08:08] know the brother well great Labor in the
[1:08:11] gospel great brother stood for the Lord
[1:08:12] for years and years but a younger man
[1:08:14] going around in that particular country
[1:08:16] and and prosely lighting people from
[1:08:19] this church and that church and that
[1:08:21] church and pulling on people to follow
[1:08:24] him
[1:08:25] now you see a true man that is born of
[1:08:28] the spirit of God does not have to
[1:08:30] depend on other preachers to beget sheep
[1:08:34] for him
[1:08:35] he has the ability to reproduce his own
[1:08:39] but some preachers don't have that
[1:08:42] ability
[1:08:43] now this is the Bible which just to
[1:08:45] believe the Bible right right oh okay I
[1:08:47] just want to make sure you all right I
[1:08:48] was thinking y'all did so we could have
[1:08:50] ten thousand instructors but how many
[1:08:54] out of that ten thousand would actually
[1:08:56] have the power of begettable
[1:08:59] or they could preach the word to the
[1:09:02] soul because you see them Men actually
[1:09:04] have the ministry of reconciliation some
[1:09:07] men only have a Ministry of Salvation
[1:09:10] they have a Ministry of some sort of
[1:09:12] Doctrine or you know they're just like
[1:09:15] the kind old priest always so loving is
[1:09:17] so gentle he's so nice or he talks so
[1:09:19] sweet to you oh it's just such a sweet
[1:09:22] sweet brother well that's well in good I
[1:09:23] like sweetness on certain things but you
[1:09:26] know what I'd rather have a man that
[1:09:28] could be my father in the word and
[1:09:31] produce a new birth than of God that's
[1:09:33] just about like a cinnamon roll I mean
[1:09:35] he just oozing with goodness and
[1:09:38] sweetness and I mean just you know
[1:09:40] everybody gets around just ooey gooey
[1:09:42] whenever he gets done and cannot produce
[1:09:44] one son or daughter of God what good is
[1:09:49] sweetness with just a bunch of words
[1:09:51] now you know y'all do believe what Paul
[1:09:53] said right I know you did now know this
[1:09:56] so he said for though you have ten
[1:09:58] thousand instructors in Christ yet have
[1:10:00] you not many fathers for in Christ Jesus
[1:10:03] notice now Paul said for in Christ Jesus
[1:10:08] in Christ Jesus I have begotten you
[1:10:13] through the gospel
[1:10:16] so Paul was in Christ and Christ was
[1:10:21] using Paul's gift to pass his seed word
[1:10:24] to quickened germs of life
[1:10:27] now a man who's not in Christ a man that
[1:10:31] just studies to be a preacher and he
[1:10:33] might be a good talker there's no
[1:10:35] question about some of these guys at
[1:10:36] podcasts and some of these guys that
[1:10:38] will write books and you pick them up in
[1:10:40] the Bible bookstore many good thoughts
[1:10:42] and many good ideas they're not all
[1:10:45] crazy and all weird and all that many of
[1:10:47] them have some good Bible principles but
[1:10:51] can they produce births
[1:10:53] can they produce births oh you might get
[1:10:56] a good something from them every now and
[1:10:58] then and they may have a good point here
[1:11:00] and a good point there but for myself if
[1:11:03] I was a person looking to set under a
[1:11:06] minister I would want to see if the man
[1:11:08] was produced first and had through the
[1:11:11] years
[1:11:13] if he ain't I ain't gonna sit there
[1:11:15] alone myself
[1:11:16] now notice for in Christ Jesus I have
[1:11:20] begotten
[1:11:21] through the gospel so then apparently
[1:11:25] every preacher does not have the ability
[1:11:28] to beget children to God by Spoken Word
[1:11:32] birth now there might be men that can
[1:11:34] set up and quote the Bible and quote the
[1:11:37] message oh my they quote that Prophet
[1:11:38] they just lay it down there and yet you
[1:11:41] follow them and you watch them and you
[1:11:43] wonder what are they doing what what is
[1:11:46] their agenda what are they doing for the
[1:11:48] body what are they doing to the body is
[1:11:51] the body coming to that place of
[1:11:52] fruition what's really happening with
[1:11:55] him now Paul wanted to warn because he
[1:11:58] knew there was an intellectual side to
[1:12:00] the gospel that was going to come there
[1:12:02] after it was already there really
[1:12:03] wherefore I beseech you be ye followers
[1:12:07] of me I mean she wants to do that today
[1:12:10] so Paul now himself now keep this in
[1:12:13] mind Paul himself could be led and
[1:12:17] instructed now you don't want to follow
[1:12:19] any man I don't care who he is any man
[1:12:22] who can not be led and be instructed to
[1:12:26] by those that are his Elders he's not a
[1:12:29] god-called leader a leader that cannot
[1:12:32] be led is not a real leader from God's
[1:12:35] presence he's more like a dictator
[1:12:38] Amen brother Donnie Amen brother amen
[1:12:43] amen I'm gonna have to make that tape
[1:12:45] after church tonight Brothers maybe I'm
[1:12:47] doing four-part Harmony on it now notice
[1:12:49] that
[1:12:50] notice there is three years after Paul's
[1:12:53] conversion whenever the Lord met him on
[1:12:56] the road to Damascus and we know the
[1:12:58] story about Paul so Paul is now he wants
[1:13:03] to visit the brothers and the churches
[1:13:05] in Jerusalem now I said in your last
[1:13:09] swings and I don't want to say it again
[1:13:10] that most of us message folks are so
[1:13:13] scared to death of organization we are
[1:13:16] terrified of organism now once you
[1:13:20] listen how the early church operated in
[1:13:23] the body now you see the problem that we
[1:13:26] have is actually coming through
[1:13:29] thousands of years of organization some
[1:13:32] of you coming out of it maybe some of
[1:13:34] your families coming out of it then
[1:13:36] whenever you see anything that looks
[1:13:39] like an order to a certain move of God
[1:13:42] it scares people to death but the reason
[1:13:45] of that is because we're standing here
[1:13:47] trying to read the Bible back through
[1:13:49] what we've experienced ourselves now
[1:13:52] keep in mind whenever we read these
[1:13:54] places tonight in the scripture that
[1:13:56] these people had never had an
[1:13:58] organization before like as far as an
[1:14:00] organization of the Gospel now they come
[1:14:02] out of Pharisees Sadducees have seen
[1:14:04] herodians and all of that but it was
[1:14:06] nothing quite like this so whenever they
[1:14:09] would see this they had no problem with
[1:14:11] it because they were not pulling it
[1:14:13] through the fear of organized religion
[1:14:16] so Paul is going up to Jerusalem now he
[1:14:21] is not known hardly at all you know Paul
[1:14:25] felt like now I know this may seem
[1:14:27] really strange To You Paul knew that God
[1:14:30] had a special word for him because he
[1:14:32] had told ananias to tell him and by now
[1:14:35] the Lord had already been dealing with
[1:14:36] Paul three years since he's been
[1:14:37] converted now what was he doing during
[1:14:40] that time of three years well he was
[1:14:42] preaching in Damascus but it was quite a
[1:14:44] way from Jerusalem so they didn't have
[1:14:47] phone texts email things like that so it
[1:14:49] might have been quite slow for news to
[1:14:51] come from Damascus over but we also know
[1:14:54] according to what Paul told us later
[1:14:56] that he had went down to Arabia during
[1:15:00] this same time frame so three years have
[1:15:03] passed since Paul got converted he still
[1:15:06] identified actually under the old name
[1:15:08] of Saul but he was not like a lot of us
[1:15:11] in the message he was not like a lot of
[1:15:14] people that have been down Through the
[1:15:16] Ages and that Paul did not feel like he
[1:15:20] did not need the rest of the brothers
[1:15:23] now you see it's never the spirit of God
[1:15:26] that will separate us away from the rest
[1:15:29] of the body it's never the spirit of God
[1:15:31] that will convince you you can set home
[1:15:33] and be just as good a Christian as you
[1:15:36] can by coming to church
[1:15:38] well praise the Lord God's Prophet tells
[1:15:40] you better than that and so does your
[1:15:42] Bible so Paul brother Jack he wanted to
[1:15:45] go up to Jerusalem now remember by this
[1:15:48] time he had never met Peter he had never
[1:15:51] met James he had never met any of the
[1:15:54] rest of the brothers yet he's in the
[1:15:56] ministry he's preaching he's doing what
[1:15:59] God's called him to do but he felt like
[1:16:01] that he needed to be recognized with the
[1:16:05] rest of the body now this is Apostolic
[1:16:08] teaching this is the master builder
[1:16:11] himself before he comes into the
[1:16:14] architect position of the body now how
[1:16:18] could a man be used as an architect for
[1:16:21] God if he only knows about the church in
[1:16:25] Damascus
[1:16:26] how can this man do this then unless he
[1:16:30] has favor with the rest of the body all
[1:16:33] mine so he wants to associate himself
[1:16:37] with the disciples he wants to be able
[1:16:40] to know Peter and to be able to meet
[1:16:42] some of the other brothers and he also
[1:16:44] wants to be able to meet the rest of the
[1:16:47] body you see communion with the Saints
[1:16:50] is as healthy as it is right for the
[1:16:54] individuals that understand him so here
[1:16:57] was Paul and he hadn't hardly had any
[1:17:00] communion at all with anybody only just
[1:17:03] a few people and he preached there in
[1:17:06] Damascus and no doubt brought some to
[1:17:07] the Lord but yet Paul wanted to reach
[1:17:10] out he was not of the mindset I don't
[1:17:13] need no Mighty blessed God I'll take my
[1:17:15] own Ministry I don't need a home Church
[1:17:17] to work out other I don't need no
[1:17:19] preacher friends I don't need nobody no
[1:17:21] that's not the way the apostolic
[1:17:23] Doctrine was established
[1:17:25] now you see this is also established
[1:17:29] from the mind of the great designer
[1:17:31] himself notice this in Luke chapter 22
[1:17:33] verse 32 the Lord Jesus said I have
[1:17:37] prayed for thee speaking to Peter that
[1:17:39] thy faith failed thee not and when thou
[1:17:42] art converted strengthen thy Brethren so
[1:17:46] the Lord Jesus is showing that in this
[1:17:48] body that he will establish upon the
[1:17:51] Earth that no man is going to be an
[1:17:53] island so Peter is going to backslide
[1:17:55] Peter is going to deny the denies the
[1:17:58] Lord but Jesus said I prayed for you
[1:18:00] that your faithful and fail and when you
[1:18:02] get reconciled back yourself I want you
[1:18:05] to strengthen the brother so don't stay
[1:18:07] home and don't stay away from everybody
[1:18:09] sure you're going to be ashamed you
[1:18:11] imagine how shame Peter was when he had
[1:18:13] to come back to the brothers and ask him
[1:18:15] where was you where was you well well I
[1:18:17] I cussed and I I denied I even him can
[1:18:20] you imagine some of you are ashamed of
[1:18:22] the things you've done can you imagine
[1:18:23] what this man had to tell his brothers
[1:18:25] and said Brothers I'm sorry please
[1:18:27] forgive me for what I've done but yet
[1:18:29] the Lord Jesus knew this would happen
[1:18:31] but he wanted people Peter to understand
[1:18:34] like us that with the body this is what
[1:18:37] God makes it for also this is with the
[1:18:40] teaching of the Apostles and Colossians
[1:18:43] 3 16 let the word of Christ dwell in you
[1:18:46] richly in all wisdom teaching and
[1:18:49] admonishing one another in Psalms and
[1:18:53] hymns and spiritual songs singing with
[1:18:57] Grace in your hearts to the Lord now
[1:19:00] this is again of course the great master
[1:19:03] builder emphasizing the importance of us
[1:19:06] getting together not only in church but
[1:19:09] when we can have times of fellowship and
[1:19:12] whatever more that we would admonish one
[1:19:14] another and we would talk Psalms and we
[1:19:17] would sing songs and we would be able to
[1:19:19] be a benefit and the church said
[1:19:22] Hebrews 10 25 not forsaking the
[1:19:27] assembling of ourselves together
[1:19:30] as the manner of some is and brother Ram
[1:19:34] quotes this in the seals and says as the
[1:19:36] manner of unbelievers is
[1:19:39] but exhorting one another so you see you
[1:19:43] don't just come to church for the
[1:19:45] preacher to do all the talking but
[1:19:47] you're to have fellowship with one
[1:19:48] another and mingle among the saints and
[1:19:50] and talk how you doing brother well I've
[1:19:52] been going through a Bernal brother I'm
[1:19:54] going to be praying for you pray for me
[1:19:56] and I'll pray for you that's the way God
[1:19:58] intended for the body to be just like
[1:20:01] your body does
[1:20:03] now notice he said but exhort in one
[1:20:05] another so much more as you see the day
[1:20:09] approaching which don't do it less and
[1:20:11] less the farther you get into the tapes
[1:20:13] and then you realize you don't need to
[1:20:15] go to church that's anti-scripture and
[1:20:18] anti-message
[1:20:19] James 5 16 confess your faults one to
[1:20:23] another you're going to have a hard time
[1:20:25] doing if you don't go to church ain't
[1:20:26] you because you don't see nobody and
[1:20:28] pray one for another that you may be
[1:20:31] healed the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:20:34] righteous man Avail us much now notice
[1:20:37] him Paul gets the longing and hungering
[1:20:41] as it was to meet the brothers and sin
[1:20:44] now listen to this scenario very
[1:20:47] carefully Acts chapter 9 verse 26 and
[1:20:50] when Saul was come to Jerusalem he
[1:20:54] assayed to join himself to the disciples
[1:20:58] now here's a desire and this is a
[1:21:00] prophet of God now nobody in Jerusalem
[1:21:04] will ever compare to his Revelation
[1:21:07] nobody in Jerusalem will ever bring as
[1:21:11] many to the cause of Christ as he would
[1:21:14] he is the very first missionary in the
[1:21:17] New Testament no one ever outdid what he
[1:21:22] did oh I had the facts of it several
[1:21:24] years ago how many miles that he walked
[1:21:26] how many miles they calculated that he
[1:21:28] spent in the ship it was absolutely
[1:21:30] incredible to read what the man went
[1:21:33] through and yet this man as I would say
[1:21:36] had the premier position in the first
[1:21:40] church age yet he himself did not feel
[1:21:43] like that his position alone would
[1:21:47] qualify him to stay by himself and say I
[1:21:50] don't need nobody else
[1:21:52] I hope you're going to hear me tonight
[1:21:54] so he is saved to join himself to the
[1:21:57] disciples
[1:21:59] and they were so glad
[1:22:01] and they all they just opened their
[1:22:04] doors to Saul and said dear brother we
[1:22:07] heard that you are the master builder
[1:22:09] and praise God come in our homes
[1:22:12] no that wasn't a reception he got at all
[1:22:16] so I wonder what some of us would have
[1:22:18] done
[1:22:19] and we would have got this reception
[1:22:23] but they were all
[1:22:26] afraid of him
[1:22:29] and believe not
[1:22:31] that he was a disciple
[1:22:36] so what would you do
[1:22:39] Shake the Dust off your shoes bless God
[1:22:41] let the judge
[1:22:43] the judge fall on this place no you see
[1:22:45] Paul knew the necessity
[1:22:49] of being with the body
[1:22:51] even though it's going to hurt him
[1:22:54] now watch in Galatians 1 18 after three
[1:22:57] years I went up to Jerusalem to see
[1:23:01] Peter and Abode with him for 15 days now
[1:23:05] can you imagine what a time that must
[1:23:07] have been Peter and Paul together just
[1:23:11] hanging out as we'd say talking
[1:23:13] fellowshipping well brother Peter how do
[1:23:16] you see this how you preach election how
[1:23:18] do you preach the new birth what what
[1:23:20] tell me tell me about Jesus tell me tell
[1:23:23] me all these stories tell me I want to
[1:23:25] know now here is the greatest man in the
[1:23:28] New Testament next to the Lord Jesus
[1:23:31] but he was still teachable
[1:23:38] you see when we get to a spot that we
[1:23:40] can't no longer receive teaching we're
[1:23:43] actually backslid
[1:23:45] I don't care what you're doing
[1:23:47] notice this man
[1:23:50] chapter 9 again of Acts verse 27. but
[1:23:54] Barnabas
[1:23:55] took him
[1:23:57] I brought him
[1:23:59] to
[1:24:01] the apostles
[1:24:03] now you see the Lord Jesus had already
[1:24:06] told us that would be an act of the
[1:24:09] paracletos
[1:24:10] an advocate that would come and stand
[1:24:14] between us
[1:24:16] and our father
[1:24:18] Barnabas had been so baptized by the
[1:24:21] Holy Ghost
[1:24:22] that he's acting out the advocacy of the
[1:24:26] spirit of God
[1:24:29] now Barnabas had already heard about
[1:24:31] Paul remember his place of where he
[1:24:34] lived was closer than than Jerusalem so
[1:24:37] he had heard about Paul now here is the
[1:24:40] church age messenger that needs to be
[1:24:44] introduced
[1:24:46] to average church people of Word of Life
[1:24:49] will say
[1:24:50] and he's going to be introduced to the
[1:24:53] church
[1:24:54] to a man who has a much lesser inferior
[1:24:59] call understanding Revelation and so on
[1:25:03] than he does
[1:25:05] now can you imagine men of Pride and
[1:25:08] Prestige they would have never humbled
[1:25:12] their self to be introduced to Peter or
[1:25:16] James or the rest of the church in
[1:25:18] Jerusalem by a man which was their
[1:25:21] inferior
[1:25:25] I'm sorry y'all didn't know this is in
[1:25:27] your Bible
[1:25:29] now watch what Barnabas does so Barnabas
[1:25:33] is acting the part of the paracletus or
[1:25:38] The Advocate
[1:25:39] so nobody you just read it nobody
[1:25:42] believed
[1:25:44] that Saul was a Believer much less a
[1:25:47] preacher
[1:25:48] much less a prophet
[1:25:51] a master builder are you kidding me
[1:25:55] so barnaba steps in with his brother
[1:26:00] now keep this in mind precious friends
[1:26:03] sometimes we might have to be a
[1:26:04] paracletus
[1:26:05] for someone who's fell
[1:26:08] someone who's backslid someone has
[1:26:11] stepped out of God's care and mercy
[1:26:15] so will you be there for them if they
[1:26:18] need somebody to stand between them
[1:26:23] oh y'all ain't going to
[1:26:25] okay I'm making an older car right now
[1:26:27] we'll start right here everybody from
[1:26:28] here over come up here and repent
[1:26:31] you see it was very risky for Barnabas
[1:26:37] but he feels this man it's true
[1:26:42] don't notice and brought him to the
[1:26:45] apostles
[1:26:46] and declared unto them how he had seen
[1:26:51] the Lord in the way now it's not Paul
[1:26:54] telling it but it's Barnabas had either
[1:26:56] talked to Paul or Barnabas had heard it
[1:26:59] as he come back from where he lived
[1:27:01] coming back through Damascus to
[1:27:03] Jerusalem
[1:27:04] so here he is telling
[1:27:07] Paul's testimony second-handed
[1:27:12] well you can imagine some of the
[1:27:13] preachers in the message can't you that
[1:27:15] say you bunch of rebels you bunch of
[1:27:19] infidels and unbelievers if you don't
[1:27:21] believe in me suit yourself I don't need
[1:27:25] you anyway I've got my Ministry I've got
[1:27:28] my church I've got this and go on do
[1:27:31] whatever you want to do
[1:27:33] that's a man that doesn't understand
[1:27:35] very much in the scripture does he
[1:27:40] Paul to just walk out and say okay Lord
[1:27:42] I tried but you know
[1:27:44] you know witness every one of them
[1:27:46] thought I was a phony every one of them
[1:27:49] thought that I never even believed you
[1:27:53] and more than likely by this time three
[1:27:55] years on had already done more than any
[1:27:57] of them had
[1:28:00] so here Barnabas
[1:28:02] stands in as the media so through
[1:28:06] Barnabas
[1:28:07] Saul is received as a brother
[1:28:13] his past
[1:28:15] his past
[1:28:17] no doubt that heard of him and that
[1:28:19] heard that he went to Damascus and he
[1:28:21] had papers and he had had some of the
[1:28:24] saints of God thrown in jail
[1:28:26] so his past didn't speak very good of
[1:28:28] him
[1:28:29] but through Barnabas oh praise the Lord
[1:28:33] I hope you get it through Barnabas
[1:28:36] Barnabas was able to convince the people
[1:28:41] Paul was a believer
[1:28:44] praise be to God notice what one man's
[1:28:48] testimony about another bearing Truth
[1:28:51] Now can just be able to dissolve that
[1:28:55] distrust
[1:28:56] and it's not when Barnabas began to tell
[1:28:59] this notice in verse 28 and he was with
[1:29:04] them coming in and going out
[1:29:09] at Jerusalem so here the paracletos
[1:29:12] Barnabas just stood there and they said
[1:29:15] well praise God we know brother Barnes
[1:29:17] he's a good brother he loves the Lord
[1:29:18] and if Barnabas has got confidence in
[1:29:20] him praise God my what a thing that
[1:29:23] would be as Believers would it not to be
[1:29:26] able to intercede in such a way and all
[1:29:29] the Believers there probably Peter James
[1:29:31] all the rest of them included and yet
[1:29:33] when Barnabas stands up for him it's
[1:29:35] just like it rolls the distrust away
[1:29:38] notice in verse 29 and he spoke
[1:29:41] In The Name Of The Lord of the Lord
[1:29:43] Jesus
[1:29:46] but they weren't about to slay him
[1:29:49] bless his heart he was a troublemaking
[1:29:50] guy wasn't he
[1:29:52] notice in verse 30. which when the
[1:29:56] Brethren knew now you're the brothers
[1:29:58] they meet him they talk to him he spends
[1:30:01] two weeks in a day with Peter and then
[1:30:02] he still kind of hangs her out Jerusalem
[1:30:04] boy he's out and about and then he's out
[1:30:06] there preaching goes to debate with the
[1:30:07] Christian and her out to kill this guy
[1:30:09] so the brothers now the rest of the
[1:30:12] Apostles and the disciples in Jerusalem
[1:30:13] when the Brethren knew they
[1:30:16] notice now they
[1:30:19] they brought him down to caesarea they
[1:30:24] who
[1:30:25] the brothers
[1:30:27] now if we would read this if we're now
[1:30:30] careful reading it coming through all
[1:30:31] the denominational nonsense we would go
[1:30:33] back and say Lord have mercy wow that
[1:30:36] ain't right
[1:30:37] ain't right for them to try to work with
[1:30:39] the local Church of Christ Lord have
[1:30:41] mercy where'd they get that book of Acts
[1:30:44] but you see what Satan done he wants to
[1:30:47] take God's truth and so pollute it that
[1:30:50] we're scared to death of the Bible
[1:30:52] this is your Bible this is the way they
[1:30:56] operated this is the way they functioned
[1:30:58] in the apostolic age and I ask you are
[1:31:02] we restored to this
[1:31:04] oh you think it's just acts 2 38.
[1:31:08] um
[1:31:09] notice so when the Brethren knew they
[1:31:12] brought him down to caesarea
[1:31:15] and sent him forth
[1:31:18] to Tarsus
[1:31:21] you mean the preachers
[1:31:24] spoke to Paul and said Paul you don't
[1:31:27] need to stay here you need to leave oh
[1:31:30] well your brothers think I need to go
[1:31:31] you need to go to Tarsus
[1:31:38] testing what I thought this microphone
[1:31:40] was working maybe it ain't
[1:31:42] this is your Bible don't you see why
[1:31:44] Satan wanted to make a denominational
[1:31:47] system and make it appear like the truth
[1:31:51] so it would be such a scarecrow before
[1:31:53] people that even bribe people hear this
[1:31:55] and they look at you like you're from
[1:31:57] Mars
[1:32:01] or you can imagine some of our message
[1:32:03] preachers get you now brother I'll tell
[1:32:05] you one thing I don't think I'll do that
[1:32:07] glory to God I'll tell you one thing I'm
[1:32:09] going to do it I don't care what
[1:32:10] happened I'll tell you one but if I have
[1:32:13] to do that there you go
[1:32:16] why
[1:32:17] so scared of organization
[1:32:20] we're scared of organism right with it
[1:32:23] all my Acts chapter 11 verse 28.
[1:32:29] well I hope you do time I get done with
[1:32:30] you tonight
[1:32:32] and there stood up one of them named
[1:32:34] agabus and signified by the spirit that
[1:32:37] there should be a great dirse which was
[1:32:38] a famine throughout all the world which
[1:32:40] came to pass in the days of Claudius
[1:32:42] Caesar then the disciples every man
[1:32:45] according to his ability determined to
[1:32:47] send relief under the Brethren which
[1:32:49] dwelt and Judea which also they did
[1:32:53] and sent it to the elders by the hands
[1:32:57] of Barnabas and salt now notice the
[1:33:00] order
[1:33:01] that they had
[1:33:03] so they didn't just say here you take it
[1:33:05] and you take it in they believe that God
[1:33:08] had an order in his church
[1:33:12] and they also knew there was false
[1:33:14] prophets out there and they knew that
[1:33:16] those folks that would be following what
[1:33:18] the Bible term was filthy Luther which
[1:33:21] is the love for money generally filthy
[1:33:24] Lucas associated with filthy Lucifer
[1:33:27] aha now notice that they set up then in
[1:33:32] the church Elders deacons Bishops
[1:33:36] overseers which is exact same word when
[1:33:38] you look at it in the Greek one defines
[1:33:40] his age the other defines his office and
[1:33:43] this is the way the original Church set
[1:33:45] up to eliminate a lot of the error
[1:33:49] notice now in Chapter 14 verse 21 and
[1:33:53] when they had preached the gospel to
[1:33:55] that sin it had taught many they
[1:33:57] returned again to lystra and to Iconium
[1:34:00] unto Antioch confirming the souls of the
[1:34:02] disciples and exhorting them to continue
[1:34:05] in the face that we must through much
[1:34:07] tribulation enter into the kingdom of
[1:34:10] God and when they had ordained them
[1:34:14] elders
[1:34:18] in every Church
[1:34:21] pastors
[1:34:27] so who did this
[1:34:29] the apostles
[1:34:31] now I'm looking for these words as I'm
[1:34:33] going through the book of Acts and I'm
[1:34:35] looking at every scripture where it used
[1:34:37] the word church and I'm looking up every
[1:34:40] scripture where it uses the word
[1:34:42] churches and I'm looking at every
[1:34:44] scripture where it uses the word Elder
[1:34:47] and elders and overseers and all these
[1:34:51] words and I'm looking for those magic
[1:34:53] words that we use so much in the message
[1:34:57] I felt led
[1:35:01] now apparently my software
[1:35:04] don't work very good
[1:35:06] because in all my looking
[1:35:08] I ain't found where Paul told any of
[1:35:10] these guys to do this if you feel led
[1:35:18] I'm telling you Jesus you're going to
[1:35:19] get me killed one of these days
[1:35:22] you know what they consider this as
[1:35:24] being the word of God you don't have to
[1:35:27] feel led to obey the word you obey it
[1:35:30] because it's God's word
[1:35:33] praise the Lord some of you that wait to
[1:35:36] worship when you feel it you're missing
[1:35:38] a great time with God you're
[1:35:40] commissioned by God to worship him
[1:35:42] whether you feel it or not you're
[1:35:44] commanded by God to raise your hands it
[1:35:47] has nothing to do with fear clap your
[1:35:50] hands all you people that's a command in
[1:35:52] God's Bible just like water baptism any
[1:35:55] other command I'm on a sing I'm gonna
[1:35:58] clap my hands I'm going to raise my
[1:36:00] hands brother Jack whether I feed it or
[1:36:02] whether I don't why because the word
[1:36:04] tells me to do it
[1:36:12] now I want you to notice the apostolic
[1:36:14] order that it's not preachers now that
[1:36:17] are going out and establishing their own
[1:36:20] things and doing their own thing
[1:36:21] themselves well I don't need what James
[1:36:24] said I don't need what Peter said I
[1:36:26] don't care what they say glory to God
[1:36:27] the Lord called me to do this I'm doing
[1:36:30] it I don't need nobody's approval oh and
[1:36:33] there you're wrong you see
[1:36:35] if the elders didn't approve of a
[1:36:38] preacher in the New Testament he didn't
[1:36:40] get in their churches
[1:36:44] hmm
[1:36:46] and what they had ordained them elders
[1:36:48] and every church I want you to notice
[1:36:50] now the sequence of God
[1:36:52] the preacher didn't come first
[1:36:56] so a New Testament Church was never
[1:36:58] established
[1:37:00] just so a preacher could have a place to
[1:37:03] preach
[1:37:04] the church was established and then the
[1:37:08] pastor the Elder come into the church
[1:37:12] read your Bible
[1:37:16] all right
[1:37:18] when they had ordained them Elders in
[1:37:21] every church I said doesn't say that
[1:37:22] they ordained the church or then they
[1:37:25] ordained well the the preacher went out
[1:37:26] first and then he now remember what's
[1:37:28] going on in this is the missionary stage
[1:37:31] of the Apostolic Church
[1:37:33] so Paul is going out Peter is going out
[1:37:35] other brothers are going out so these
[1:37:37] men are starters they are Apostles so
[1:37:40] they would go out and they might stay
[1:37:41] there a year two three like Paul did in
[1:37:44] some places but he's not a pastor so
[1:37:46] he's not going to stay so Paul wouldn't
[1:37:48] just go there and establish the church
[1:37:49] and then just let whoever come here well
[1:37:52] I feel that I feel that as I said you
[1:37:54] won't find that
[1:37:55] but they would be very careful of who
[1:37:59] that they placed in that church
[1:38:02] so it wasn't like well I feel led to go
[1:38:04] here and I feel led to go there that's
[1:38:06] not the scripture
[1:38:09] I stand to be corrected
[1:38:11] if I'm wrong
[1:38:14] notice them what they did and they had
[1:38:16] ordained them Elders in every church and
[1:38:18] prayed with fasting and they commended
[1:38:20] them to the Lord on whom they believed
[1:38:24] acts 15 1. and certain men which came
[1:38:27] down from Judea taught the Brethren and
[1:38:29] said except ye be circumcised after the
[1:38:33] manner of Moses you cannot be saved now
[1:38:35] you see this is one of the reasons they
[1:38:37] set this Apostolic order up because
[1:38:39] there's always going to be these guys
[1:38:41] right here
[1:38:42] I found it amazing for years the work in
[1:38:45] China was hidden hardly nobody knew any
[1:38:48] contact information and that was done
[1:38:51] for a reason
[1:38:53] Satan is never the original missionary
[1:38:56] but ever were Gods ever sent a
[1:38:59] missionary the Devils come in right
[1:39:01] behind them and I've seen it happen in
[1:39:03] China and seen it in other that was one
[1:39:05] of the first works that we was ever
[1:39:06] involved in as far as one of the early
[1:39:07] foundation groundworks and you try your
[1:39:10] best to keep it out of there as long as
[1:39:12] possible so you can get them rooted and
[1:39:15] grounded and settled in the truth
[1:39:17] because you know it's inevitable these
[1:39:20] guys will come in and sure enough here
[1:39:22] they come right into China somebody got
[1:39:25] a phone number let's listen to every
[1:39:27] testimony I'd give or every testimony
[1:39:29] about the physical together whoever
[1:39:30] would make a trip there until finally
[1:39:32] they call somebody and got a phone
[1:39:34] number and here they go they go and make
[1:39:36] a trip to China One missionary of this
[1:39:38] and another missionary of that and to go
[1:39:41] in there what do they do try to pull the
[1:39:43] people off to follow in their ideology
[1:39:45] which they were successful
[1:39:47] and Paul knew that this would happen so
[1:39:49] Paul said this is the way God now is
[1:39:52] there anybody here in the right mind
[1:39:53] that would want to dispute and say
[1:39:56] that's not right Paul did it wrong
[1:39:59] oh my goodness well I'll tell you one
[1:40:01] thing you're braver than I am or Dumber
[1:40:06] I believe we're talking about the master
[1:40:08] builder here
[1:40:09] I don't care what you feel I don't care
[1:40:11] what I feel it has to come back to this
[1:40:14] or it's the devil
[1:40:16] well judge All Things by the word
[1:40:20] now notice when therefore Paul and
[1:40:22] Barnabas had no small dissension I mean
[1:40:25] they scorched these guys out had no
[1:40:28] small dissension at disputation and with
[1:40:31] them they disputed with them they
[1:40:33] determined that Paul and Barnabas and
[1:40:34] certain other of them should go up to
[1:40:36] Jerusalem under the apostles and the
[1:40:39] elders about this question you've got to
[1:40:41] be kidding me
[1:40:42] so here is a dispute in the church and
[1:40:46] they want to go back up to Jerusalem to
[1:40:48] talk to Peter and the apostles
[1:40:53] you can imagine some of ours wanting to
[1:40:55] do that well brother let's sit down with
[1:40:57] this Brethren no no I
[1:41:01] tell what
[1:41:03] well different Spirit on us I'm afraid
[1:41:06] than what was in the book of Acts
[1:41:09] oh my goodness
[1:41:11] and being brought on their leg by the
[1:41:13] church they pastor finisi and Samaria
[1:41:16] declaring the conversion of the Gentiles
[1:41:19] and they caused Great Joy unto all the
[1:41:22] brethren
[1:41:24] notice in verse 4 when they were come to
[1:41:26] Jerusalem they were received of the
[1:41:28] church
[1:41:29] and of the Apostles and elders
[1:41:35] Oh you mean that's Apostolic um
[1:41:38] you see any man that's preaching
[1:41:40] anything
[1:41:41] that cannot be received by the elders in
[1:41:44] this message men that are true there's
[1:41:47] something wrong with that dude
[1:41:49] well praise the Lord
[1:41:52] I got healed I don't care if you walked
[1:41:55] on the benches I don't care if you walk
[1:41:56] on water if they're off the word you
[1:41:59] better leave them alone
[1:42:02] so they declared all things that God had
[1:42:05] done with him but the rose up certain
[1:42:06] sect to the Pharisees which believed
[1:42:10] here's our problem
[1:42:12] we've got a certain set of the Badness
[1:42:14] Among Us that it believes a message
[1:42:17] and we've got a certain sect of
[1:42:19] Pentecostals that believe and believe it
[1:42:22] or not we've got a certain sect to
[1:42:23] church Christ that believe and they've
[1:42:26] got a certain sect of nazares that
[1:42:28] believe and yes we even have some
[1:42:30] Catholics that are a certain sects of
[1:42:32] Catholicism and they believe and they
[1:42:34] are our worst troublemakers
[1:42:37] you see it for real believer believes he
[1:42:40] will no longer be a believer Pharisee he
[1:42:42] will be a believer ex Pharisee amen you
[1:42:46] might have been a Church of Christ but
[1:42:48] if you ever become a Believer praise God
[1:42:50] you'll know you made a Church of Christ
[1:42:52] no more you clap your hands you shout
[1:42:55] you love music and you say glory to God
[1:42:57] I used to win like music in the church
[1:43:00] but I sure do like it now Hallelujah it
[1:43:02] makes me feel like dancing a little bit
[1:43:04] why because you are no longer a Church
[1:43:07] of Christ which believes you are an ax
[1:43:10] Church of Christ
[1:43:18] now I want you to notice how they handle
[1:43:19] these disputes
[1:43:21] verse 6 on the apostles and elders
[1:43:24] apostles
[1:43:25] and pastors
[1:43:28] come together to consider this matter
[1:43:32] well women ain't that lack of
[1:43:34] denomination no the denomination was
[1:43:36] like the original
[1:43:38] friend don't be scared don't be scared
[1:43:40] of the rich I'm reading to you the
[1:43:41] original tonight but you see what's
[1:43:43] trying to hinder you is that old
[1:43:45] scarecrow I thought scare scare
[1:43:48] scarecrows well y'all been scared right
[1:43:51] I don't know what scare coach Karen
[1:43:52] Eagle but I guess the Scarecrow can
[1:43:54] scare an eagle if an eagle's so scared
[1:43:55] that he's scared to scarecrow because
[1:43:56] he's getting his eyes off of what he's
[1:43:58] fearful of instead of getting his eyes
[1:43:59] on the woods and wait a minute wait a
[1:44:00] minute wait a minute this is God's Bible
[1:44:02] God's Bible cannot lie this is the way
[1:44:04] the original Church operate and this is
[1:44:06] the way the master builder told that
[1:44:08] preachers as I follow the word you all
[1:44:11] follow me and this is what brother
[1:44:13] Graham said that he followed Paul
[1:44:19] verse 22 then pleased it pleased the
[1:44:23] apostles and the elders with the whole
[1:44:25] church
[1:44:26] to send chosen men of their own company
[1:44:28] to Antioch but Paul and Barnabas
[1:44:30] surnamed Judah surname barcibus and
[1:44:32] Silas Chief men among the brethren
[1:44:36] enters by them
[1:44:38] to this manner the apostles and elders
[1:44:40] and Brethren send greeting unto the
[1:44:44] Brethren which are of the Gentiles and
[1:44:45] Antioch and Syria and Sicily for as much
[1:44:48] as we have heard now this is the way
[1:44:50] they resolve these makes you know
[1:44:52] Doctrine or republican you can't hardly
[1:44:54] get a preacher to even sit down with you
[1:44:55] that differs with you in this message
[1:44:57] and if you differ with them they'll turn
[1:45:00] treat you like I don't know what and
[1:45:01] some of them will never speak to you
[1:45:03] again
[1:45:05] I was check out her chest because we
[1:45:07] know the Seven Seals and what good has
[1:45:09] that done us if it hasn't brought back
[1:45:11] the original Apostolic Faith I thought
[1:45:13] this is what brother Rams said God
[1:45:15] called him to do to bring us back to the
[1:45:18] original Apostolic face
[1:45:24] oh my goodness
[1:45:26] for as much as we have heard the certain
[1:45:28] one out
[1:45:30] from us
[1:45:32] went out from us
[1:45:36] John wrote about him later and said they
[1:45:38] went out from us because there wasn't of
[1:45:40] us and here's what they're saying these
[1:45:42] guys was never filled with the Holy
[1:45:44] Ghost
[1:45:45] these guys could not preach you'd have
[1:45:48] to have circumcision if they were really
[1:45:50] born again
[1:45:53] these were the type of teachers that
[1:45:55] could teach you all about the law and
[1:45:57] could not produce the First new birth in
[1:46:00] one soul
[1:46:03] oh praise the Lord now notice what
[1:46:06] they've done they troubled you with
[1:46:09] words so subverting your souls saying
[1:46:14] You must be circumcised and keep the law
[1:46:16] to whom we gave no such
[1:46:22] what
[1:46:26] commandment
[1:46:28] wow you mean these Apostles had that
[1:46:32] Authority with God
[1:46:39] it seemed good unto us being a symbol
[1:46:42] with one Accord
[1:46:43] to send chosen men
[1:46:46] unto you with our beloved Barnabas and
[1:46:49] Paul and then they thought it'd be a
[1:46:51] good time to just throw this next verse
[1:46:53] in men that have hazarded their lives
[1:46:56] for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:46:59] and remember it wasn't that long ago
[1:47:01] that some of these same guys right here
[1:47:03] was afraid of Saul
[1:47:06] but her brother stood in between him and
[1:47:08] brought them to an understanding of his
[1:47:10] position
[1:47:11] we have sinned
[1:47:16] we have sinned therefore Judas inside us
[1:47:20] who shall also tell you the same things
[1:47:23] by mouth boy they wanted this to be
[1:47:25] resolved didn't they
[1:47:28] acts 15 40. and Paul chose Silas
[1:47:32] and departed being recommended by the
[1:47:37] Brethren unto the grace of God you mean
[1:47:39] Paul chose a man to travel with him I
[1:47:43] should be him try his traveling partner
[1:47:46] by recommendation of the church
[1:47:50] oh
[1:47:51] don't you see why Satan wants to divide
[1:47:54] us
[1:47:54] don't you see why Satan wants to message
[1:47:56] churches this one won't speak to that
[1:47:58] one that one won't speak to that and I
[1:48:00] reckon we figure when the Rapture takes
[1:48:02] place we're all just going to be changed
[1:48:04] we're all going to be lovey-dovey
[1:48:05] everybody's just going to have so much
[1:48:06] love and y'all figured that that's going
[1:48:09] to be a street Down Heaven for the seven
[1:48:10] Thunder people and there's going to be
[1:48:12] another Avenue this and you'll be called
[1:48:14] Perugia Avenue and this and over here
[1:48:16] will be called tape only Avenue
[1:48:19] and listen over here will be called two
[1:48:21] souls and this one may call someone else
[1:48:22] there won't be no such things there and
[1:48:24] there won't be nobody there but them
[1:48:26] kind of attitudes either if we ever get
[1:48:28] there we got to get rid of them
[1:48:29] attitudes right here
[1:48:32] oh my
[1:48:33] God so you Paul took a man with him now
[1:48:36] wait a minute this is the messenger the
[1:48:37] age this is the master builder but he
[1:48:39] was still in tune with the body you see
[1:48:42] anything that pulls you that pulls me
[1:48:45] that pulls any other minister any other
[1:48:47] Church seclusively away from the body
[1:48:50] remember call it what you will it is the
[1:48:53] devil
[1:48:55] it breaks God's word
[1:49:01] oh my
[1:49:03] and he went through Syria and Sicilia
[1:49:06] confirming the churches acts 16 4. and
[1:49:09] as they went through the cities they
[1:49:11] delivered them the decrees oh decrees
[1:49:14] for to keep that word ordained
[1:49:19] of the Apostles and the elders
[1:49:23] which are at Jerusalem now look what
[1:49:25] Satan has done he's tried to mimic this
[1:49:29] with organization and scare the liver
[1:49:33] out of people for all these years
[1:49:36] so it produces that Independence
[1:49:38] something I don't need nobody I don't
[1:49:41] care if anybody approves of what I do or
[1:49:43] not and look at the spirit that goes
[1:49:45] with that sort of thing
[1:49:47] I don't need nobody blessed God I've
[1:49:50] gotten my Ministry my church and my
[1:49:53] family and my gift
[1:49:56] and you ain't going nowhere without all
[1:49:57] the rest of us either
[1:49:59] if you're going that is
[1:50:03] notice
[1:50:04] Paul traveling again Acts 2017. and from
[1:50:09] melitus he sent to Ephesus
[1:50:13] oh my goodness and call the Elders
[1:50:16] of the church
[1:50:18] so you mean Paul wouldn't even pass
[1:50:20] through an area
[1:50:22] just on his way through
[1:50:24] without paying the courtesy to the
[1:50:26] pastors
[1:50:30] wow
[1:50:33] there'll be a bride around the world
[1:50:34] that'll be restored to this just as soon
[1:50:36] as there's a God in heaven
[1:50:39] now you see verse 28 which I'm fixing to
[1:50:41] read to you proves that these were
[1:50:43] ministers and not just older brothers
[1:50:46] Paul now speaks to these Elders pastors
[1:50:50] take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[1:50:52] to all the flaws over which the Holy
[1:50:54] Ghost has made you overseers
[1:50:57] to feed the Church of God who he has
[1:51:00] purchased with his own blood acts 21 18.
[1:51:04] and the day following Paul went with us
[1:51:06] unto James and all the elders were
[1:51:09] present and when he had saluted them oh
[1:51:12] my goodness you mean Paul the prophet
[1:51:14] the master builder goes into men that
[1:51:16] are inferior to him and treats them as
[1:51:20] if they are the Great Men of the hour
[1:51:25] that's a real Holy Ghost Field preacher
[1:51:27] right there
[1:51:30] when he had saluted them he declared
[1:51:32] particularly what God think
[1:51:35] among the Gentiles by his ministry
[1:51:37] wow
[1:51:38] First Timothy 5 17 let the elders that
[1:51:43] rule again same Greek word age his Elder
[1:51:46] position is overseer Bishop prick or
[1:51:49] Bishop let the
[1:51:52] at rule so we're not talking about old
[1:51:55] man in the church now
[1:51:59] over to superintend preside over to be a
[1:52:04] protector or a guardian
[1:52:07] let the elders that rule well be counted
[1:52:11] Worthy
[1:52:13] oh my goodness
[1:52:16] of double honor
[1:52:19] but who gets double honor in this
[1:52:21] message
[1:52:23] a lot of times gifted men get
[1:52:25] more honorable than the man who labors
[1:52:27] and Doctrine in the word
[1:52:30] preachers that will step down out of
[1:52:32] their pulpit and start playing tapes and
[1:52:34] never preach another sermon
[1:52:36] they get more honor than the men of God
[1:52:38] who labor in the word
[1:52:40] which is a crying shame
[1:52:42] I'll tell you one thing a preacher that
[1:52:44] listened to some headquarters somewhere
[1:52:45] named talking out of preaching he ought
[1:52:46] to sat down boy I figured if God calls
[1:52:49] you how can any man shut you up
[1:53:00] labor
[1:53:01] in the word
[1:53:03] and Doctrine
[1:53:06] look at this word labor
[1:53:08] told
[1:53:10] be wearied
[1:53:12] tired
[1:53:13] exhausted
[1:53:15] was toil or burdens or grief
[1:53:18] to labor with worrisome effort
[1:53:24] to labor was worrisome
[1:53:27] effort
[1:53:29] now the Bible your Bible
[1:53:32] says men who do this are supposed to be
[1:53:35] worthy of double honor
[1:53:37] and the church said
[1:53:39] now this is Apostolic Doctrine
[1:53:42] notice and then Paul gives the parallel
[1:53:44] or the example Verse 18 for the
[1:53:46] scripture says Thou shalt not muzzle the
[1:53:49] ox that treadth out the corn so I'll let
[1:53:52] you know what I am just to know Ox with
[1:53:54] a thing over the top mind X and I'm
[1:53:55] plowing you all out and you're the core
[1:53:57] the ma the ox have tried us out the corn
[1:54:00] and the labor is worthy of his reward
[1:54:03] against an elder
[1:54:06] receive not an accusation but before two
[1:54:10] or three Witnesses
[1:54:12] and yet people in this message receive
[1:54:14] lives and gossip against all kinds of
[1:54:17] preachers they don't require two
[1:54:19] witnesses or three
[1:54:21] self will be put on Facebook on Tick
[1:54:24] Tock and rock rock and Brock block and
[1:54:25] whatever more and they'll spread it
[1:54:27] around us lies against men of God and it
[1:54:30] ain't even the truth and we feel like
[1:54:32] we're flying away into the Rapture
[1:54:34] somewhere not if we break this word we
[1:54:36] ain't sins God demands obedience to his
[1:54:40] word
[1:54:42] oh my God now if you would come to a
[1:54:45] little different change can I have a few
[1:54:46] more minutes
[1:54:48] Titus Chapter 1 Verse five now the Titus
[1:54:51] was one of Paul's sons in the gospel but
[1:54:56] here in this particular occasion
[1:54:58] Paul and Titus have been to the island
[1:55:00] called Crete
[1:55:02] now Crete is part of the Mediterranean
[1:55:04] area but it's it's in the Aegean Sea a
[1:55:08] little island about 40 miles wide 120
[1:55:11] 130 miles long
[1:55:13] had approximately a hundred cities on
[1:55:17] that little island very great vacation
[1:55:19] spot even to this day
[1:55:20] so Paul goes in there now he's a ship
[1:55:23] whenever his Shipwrecked there and he
[1:55:25] had to go in but apparently Paul went
[1:55:27] back again and him and Titus had made
[1:55:30] another trip because the other time he's
[1:55:32] on his way to Rome so he didn't have
[1:55:34] time to study but Paul apparently
[1:55:36] preached from one end of that Island to
[1:55:38] the other
[1:55:39] and there was converts from City to City
[1:55:43] now here Paul and Titus are back again
[1:55:46] but something comes up and Paul doesn't
[1:55:49] tell us what it was so apparently we
[1:55:51] didn't need to know what it was so
[1:55:53] something pulls Paul away from the
[1:55:57] island of Crete
[1:55:58] and Paul leaves Titus there on the
[1:56:01] island now listen what he leaves him for
[1:56:04] this cause left eye thee in Crete
[1:56:10] that thou should have set in order the
[1:56:15] things that are wanting
[1:56:18] now we know no doubt that he told him
[1:56:21] this verbally but there must have been a
[1:56:23] question that someone would question
[1:56:26] whether or not Titus had this type of
[1:56:29] authority he was not an apostle but he
[1:56:32] was a preacher and apparently a man of
[1:56:34] Great Character that Paul would trust
[1:56:36] him with this so Paul is delegating to
[1:56:39] him an Apostolic authority to stand in
[1:56:42] this position under the circumstance now
[1:56:45] listen what Paul tells him to do so he
[1:56:47] says he reminds him I left you there
[1:56:50] that you might set the things in order
[1:56:54] that are wanting so Paul just went and
[1:56:57] preached and maybe Titus and we don't
[1:56:59] know who else and they had established
[1:57:01] churches people got saved say this heard
[1:57:03] from the south and we're to the North or
[1:57:04] vice versa and people was getting saved
[1:57:07] getting healed get delivered
[1:57:09] and they had churches
[1:57:11] but they didn't have no pastors yet
[1:57:14] so as I said look in the apostolic order
[1:57:17] and it's not that a church is built
[1:57:20] because a preacher wants a place to
[1:57:22] preach
[1:57:24] uh it's not because an associate in a
[1:57:26] church thinks he ain't being used enough
[1:57:28] so he wants to go start his own church
[1:57:29] that's not the Bible
[1:57:32] come on now read your Bible and show me
[1:57:34] and I apologize
[1:57:36] study your Bible close and you'll find
[1:57:38] out the way churches were established in
[1:57:40] the apostolic order men went in and
[1:57:42] preached and gave birth and then what
[1:57:45] God would have to send in pastor but it
[1:57:47] was not started around the preacher
[1:57:49] first it was started with the church and
[1:57:52] then they had to come in and ordain
[1:57:54] elders
[1:57:56] this is your Bible now now what's the
[1:57:59] word that Paul used said in order this
[1:58:02] is actually a medical term which means
[1:58:05] to set a broken bone or straighten a
[1:58:09] crooked limb now the church has heard
[1:58:12] the truth they've got saved no doubt a
[1:58:15] lot of them got the Holy Ghost and
[1:58:16] they're loving God and in many Greeks uh
[1:58:19] also this is just absolutely
[1:58:21] overwhelming to them but Paul told Titus
[1:58:24] because of this urgent situation I had
[1:58:27] to leave and things are not in order
[1:58:31] oh I didn't Paul tell him well just let
[1:58:32] him do whatever the thing it was just
[1:58:34] that some man that feels led to do it
[1:58:35] just just let it let it happen I mean we
[1:58:37] believe in the Providence of God so let
[1:58:39] God take care of it Paul felt it his
[1:58:40] responsibility
[1:58:42] to let there be Elders placed in them
[1:58:45] Church why they'd be like India was if
[1:58:48] you listen to taking signs of Jesus 1962
[1:58:50] and the prophet said most of those
[1:58:51] converts that he led to the Lord all
[1:58:53] went back to the Sikhs and the chains
[1:58:55] and the Buddhists why said because there
[1:58:57] was no Minister that I could send them
[1:58:59] to oh he said I wish that I had young
[1:59:01] men that would be able to go there
[1:59:03] notice brother Branham ringing the
[1:59:05] apostolic Doctrine oh I wish I had young
[1:59:07] men that I could send to South Africa
[1:59:09] young men I could sin here and there and
[1:59:11] there that's the way the church growed
[1:59:13] not by being divided and split the
[1:59:16] church growed out of itself under the
[1:59:18] administration of the present Ministry
[1:59:21] that God put it in not somebody trying
[1:59:23] to establish themselves that's not the
[1:59:26] way it was in the Bible
[1:59:30] so there was a broken bone or a crooked
[1:59:34] lamb well what was the broken bone no
[1:59:36] pastors
[1:59:37] what was the Crooked Liam they couldn't
[1:59:40] hardly walk right no pastors
[1:59:42] so Paul tells Titus look Titus I've left
[1:59:45] she was there that you can set the
[1:59:48] things in order I want you to get in
[1:59:49] there and set that bone boy I'll tell
[1:59:51] you one thing that hurts don't it it
[1:59:53] ain't no wonder that a preacher has to
[1:59:54] break people sometimes and boy people
[1:59:56] get mad at him man you ever go to a
[1:59:58] doctor and you're in pain that doctor
[1:59:59] has to gouge on you a little bit and
[2:00:01] poke on you and do you say come on man
[2:00:02] I'm hurting already don't hurt my words
[2:00:04] well I look at if he's got to hurt me
[2:00:05] worse to make me better lay it on me Doc
[2:00:07] that's why I look at her preacher if you
[2:00:09] got to burn me up one side and down the
[2:00:11] other let me have it don't let me go to
[2:00:12] hell
[2:00:14] oh my
[2:00:16] God so the church is a body and
[2:00:19] sometimes the preacher has to be like a
[2:00:20] spiritual physician
[2:00:23] so Titus was not to select the Bishops
[2:00:28] himself I only want you to notice the
[2:00:30] word that Paul uses here
[2:00:32] so he is not a pope he is not an
[2:00:35] Archbishop oh and I'll pick him I pick
[2:00:38] him I picked that one I picked that one
[2:00:40] but you see the body themselves the word
[2:00:43] that Paul uses is not the Titus is going
[2:00:46] to pick them but Titus is going to
[2:00:49] ordain them
[2:00:50] hahaha
[2:00:52] the church is already voting the church
[2:00:56] is already looking and young men raising
[2:00:58] up or whatever more from among them but
[2:01:00] Paul wants to give Titus the
[2:01:02] requirements of a pastor
[2:01:05] and he wants to send him there just to
[2:01:07] make sure their choice is scriptural
[2:01:13] praise God now let's read this verse
[2:01:16] again for this concept of the increte
[2:01:18] that thou should have said in order the
[2:01:20] things that are wanting and ordained
[2:01:24] elders
[2:01:26] in every city as I had appointed thee so
[2:01:30] he's not there picking him any meaning
[2:01:32] but he's ordaining ordaining my brother
[2:01:36] I ordain you
[2:01:38] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:01:41] chosen by this flock chosen by them I
[2:01:45] stand Here representing Paul wow
[2:01:49] I stand here with an Apostolic Authority
[2:01:53] I hope you understand this it was only
[2:01:55] temporary allotted to Titus to do this
[2:01:58] under the circumstances
[2:02:01] so Paul now instructing him now he's
[2:02:05] going to give verse 6 and he's going to
[2:02:07] him now look Thomas when you get there
[2:02:10] just in case the church may have voted
[2:02:13] for a man that does not meet the
[2:02:15] standard of God I want to remind you
[2:02:18] what you told Timothy some of these same
[2:02:19] words if any man be blameless
[2:02:25] look at the meaning of the word
[2:02:27] unreprovable
[2:02:29] that cannot be called into account
[2:02:36] unaccused
[2:02:40] this is the kind of man you want
[2:02:43] to be your pastors he said
[2:02:45] a man that's blameless
[2:02:47] now blame us isn't just necessarily that
[2:02:50] he don't run around with women
[2:02:52] all right don't drink
[2:02:53] or he's not you know he loves money he's
[2:02:56] not a gambler it could be all kinds of
[2:02:58] things
[2:02:59] this man must be now he doesn't say
[2:03:01] perfect
[2:03:03] but he's saying blameless which means
[2:03:05] that they cannot say this man is a
[2:03:07] backstabber and have proof of it
[2:03:11] this man is two-faced and have proof of
[2:03:14] it
[2:03:15] this man is this or that or the other
[2:03:17] Paul said nope don't put that kind of
[2:03:19] man in as your pastor
[2:03:26] a lot of preachers would be about to be
[2:03:28] plumbers wouldn't he
[2:03:31] not converter guys because there's
[2:03:32] enough rotten stuff in there who
[2:03:33] wouldn't want to send them in that
[2:03:34] direction anyway if anybody he blameless
[2:03:38] the husband of
[2:03:42] one wife
[2:03:46] not been married two times three times
[2:03:48] four times five times
[2:03:52] oh I know I'm old-fashioned but I still
[2:03:54] believe this is God's word
[2:03:56] my God is not so hard up and he can have
[2:03:58] double-minded double married preacher
[2:04:00] double-minded too double married
[2:04:02] preachers in the pulpit
[2:04:05] oh I'll catch you for that but that's
[2:04:06] still God's Bible that's okay I'm
[2:04:08] willing to Bear reproach for the word
[2:04:11] the husband of one wife
[2:04:14] having faithful children
[2:04:16] not accused of Riot or unruly
[2:04:20] so you see the character is twofold both
[2:04:23] positive and negative he must have this
[2:04:26] he must have this he must have this but
[2:04:28] he can't have this and he can't have
[2:04:30] that and he can't have that
[2:04:32] for a bishop must be blameless again he
[2:04:36] uses the word again blameless as the
[2:04:39] steward of God not self-willed
[2:04:42] self-pleasing
[2:04:44] self-willed arrogant
[2:04:49] let's stand
[2:04:52] [Music]
[2:04:58] now this is not a suggestion
[2:05:01] notice the word a bishop must
[2:05:06] be blameless as the steward of God not
[2:05:08] self-willed
[2:05:09] not soon angry
[2:05:13] not given to wine
[2:05:17] no Striker
[2:05:19] this ain't walking in front of a picket
[2:05:21] line now and carrying you know those
[2:05:22] Union signs but it's a man who loses his
[2:05:25] temper real quick and raises his voice
[2:05:30] you see a man might have a great family
[2:05:31] he might even have a great call in his
[2:05:33] life but a short-tempered man
[2:05:36] God will never put one to be his pastor
[2:05:42] Apostolic times are coming oh yes they
[2:05:46] are Apostolic times are coming the
[2:05:50] bride's going up in the fire we've been
[2:05:52] restored by Malachi 4 he is coming
[2:05:56] knocking on the door oh Apostolic times
[2:06:01] are coming Lord bring them down again
[2:06:06] that was an ox Lord
[2:06:12] notice this word Striker
[2:06:15] Bruiser
[2:06:17] ready for a blow whoa
[2:06:21] pugnacious a pugnacious contentious
[2:06:26] quarrelsome
[2:06:27] person
[2:06:33] verse 8 but a lover of hospitality
[2:06:37] a lover
[2:06:39] of Good Men
[2:06:41] you are not only known by your friends
[2:06:44] but you're known by your enemies but
[2:06:46] I'll tell you one thing
[2:06:48] if the saints of God don't want to be
[2:06:50] around you or me the saints of God
[2:06:54] don't want to be Fellowship
[2:06:56] I'd question myself if I should
[2:06:59] I worry I don't need nobody oh
[2:07:03] you just now forfeited your right to
[2:07:04] preach
[2:07:08] you see it was you first then me
[2:07:11] it wasn't me who come here years and
[2:07:13] years ago and this church is built
[2:07:15] around me I came to you all
[2:07:19] the Lord sent me here to you all
[2:07:23] praise the Lord it may not easier for me
[2:07:25] if the Lord would have sent you all to
[2:07:27] me in Kentucky that's where I'm from
[2:07:30] and the Lord but it sent you all but he
[2:07:31] didn't do that did he he sent me to you
[2:07:34] he tore up my family
[2:07:36] he busted up my family my friends my
[2:07:39] girls had to leave their their friends
[2:07:40] they had to leave their family
[2:07:43] for who for you so you see this is not
[2:07:46] built around me a church that is built
[2:07:49] around the man is built on the wrong
[2:07:52] Foundation
[2:07:53] do you understand a church that is built
[2:07:56] that way is just as anti-scriptural as a
[2:08:00] denomination
[2:08:01] because a denomination is a man-made
[2:08:03] system and you'll agree with Bill I'd
[2:08:05] never joined that but some of you will
[2:08:07] go to a man-made Church
[2:08:09] because it don't meet the requirements
[2:08:11] of God's scriptures
[2:08:13] and what is it just as much man-made is
[2:08:15] any denomination ever breathed
[2:08:17] we don't want a church man-made if if if
[2:08:20] his church was started by men we're in a
[2:08:23] herd of trouble friends if this message
[2:08:25] was founded by a man we're in a mess of
[2:08:29] trouble but if it was founded by God
[2:08:31] using a man which we believe it is we've
[2:08:34] got the right way to heaven
[2:08:37] oh praise the Lord
[2:08:39] we'll give the Lord a hand would you
[2:08:50] let me just read this for you for the
[2:08:51] next time Lord willing First Corinthians
[2:08:53] 3 11 4. other Foundation can no man lay
[2:08:57] that is laid which is Christ Jesus
[2:09:00] now if any man build upon this
[2:09:01] Foundation gold
[2:09:04] silver
[2:09:05] precious stones wood
[2:09:08] hey
[2:09:09] stubble
[2:09:11] you see the fire only purifies the gold
[2:09:15] and the silver
[2:09:16] and the stones
[2:09:19] but it destroys the wood
[2:09:21] they
[2:09:23] the stubble
[2:09:24] Paul uses six different types of
[2:09:27] material three are durable lasting
[2:09:31] three are temporal
[2:09:35] they are substance that can be destroyed
[2:09:38] by fire
[2:09:39] now let's move it beyond the preachers
[2:09:40] tonight let's bring it to you laity
[2:09:43] when your life is finished and spent
[2:09:47] you want what you've done to count don't
[2:09:49] you
[2:09:50] oh you'll never be maybe a preacher you
[2:09:52] may travel the world and be a missionary
[2:09:53] and this and that but what God's give
[2:09:55] you to do don't you want to be faithful
[2:09:57] whether it's a housewife a father a
[2:09:59] mother whatever it is you want your
[2:10:01] Works to be able to stand
[2:10:02] but your Paul is basically looking at
[2:10:04] the preachers and he sets forth two
[2:10:06] types of preachers
[2:10:08] some that are sound and solid on the
[2:10:10] apostolic Foundation others that are
[2:10:13] unsound
[2:10:15] and what they're going to do and what
[2:10:16] they're going to build upon
[2:10:18] will seem great in the eyes of some
[2:10:20] until the fire tested
[2:10:23] and the fire will annihilate it you
[2:10:25] imagine God said except the Lord build
[2:10:28] the house they that labor
[2:10:30] labor in vain
[2:10:34] Oma
[2:10:35] that's about it
[2:10:38] Hallelujah
[2:10:41] how many wants your works for the Lord
[2:10:43] Jesus
[2:10:44] be lasting
[2:10:46] you don't want it to be temporary
[2:10:48] passing ordinary
[2:10:52] not substantial that'll last
[2:10:55] oh my
[2:10:57] two friends
[2:10:59] it's going to be awful much sin some
[2:11:01] preachers stand before him that hey Lord
[2:11:02] I prayed I labored I sweated I set up
[2:11:05] past midnight many a night and I'd done
[2:11:07] this and that and the other
[2:11:09] and Jesus will look around and say
[2:11:10] where's your works
[2:11:12] well Lord I I was an evangelist I I was
[2:11:15] a I was a theologian I was a pastor i i
[2:11:17] pastored a church for 40 years and where
[2:11:20] is that
[2:11:21] I see you standing there empty-handed
[2:11:24] well Lord what happened
[2:11:26] you built it upon stubble
[2:11:29] on word on Hay
[2:11:33] Oma
[2:11:36] heavenly father is we
[2:11:39] bow our heads to the dust of the Earth
[2:11:41] from once our bodies were taken and one
[2:11:43] day
[2:11:44] they will return again
[2:11:47] may we look tonight in this sober solemn
[2:11:50] atmosphere that we feel in this place
[2:11:54] whether we're preachers or laity or
[2:11:57] singers or
[2:11:59] whatever our
[2:12:00] vocation is in life
[2:12:03] Lord may we purpose
[2:12:05] tonight greater than ever before we want
[2:12:08] to be found standing on your word
[2:12:12] the fire is going to come Lord
[2:12:15] the fire is going to come and it's going
[2:12:16] to try my work
[2:12:19] when I stand there
[2:12:21] mama won't be there with me Daddy won't
[2:12:23] my brother Harry stood with me stood
[2:12:25] together with me for years and years
[2:12:27] but he won't be able to stand there with
[2:12:29] me
[2:12:30] my wife stood with me and Stood Beside
[2:12:32] Me my family my friends Minister
[2:12:35] Brothers here in the church church
[2:12:37] members
[2:12:38] but Lord will not stand that day and the
[2:12:40] fire comes
[2:12:42] it'll be me and my works
[2:12:45] if I built on the foundation and I took
[2:12:48] wood
[2:12:49] hay stubble I left out a little word
[2:12:52] here a little Apostolic teaching there a
[2:12:54] little Apostolic Doctrine there and I
[2:12:56] didn't think it really mattered that
[2:12:57] much because
[2:12:58] I felt led to do this or that or the
[2:13:00] other
[2:13:01] Lord God I pray that you should help me
[2:13:04] help us to realize we cannot go by what
[2:13:06] we feel we must go by your word
[2:13:10] feelings will lie to us
[2:13:12] they will deceive us
[2:13:15] but your word will forever stand
[2:13:19] begin with me tonight would you Lord
[2:13:21] Jesus
[2:13:23] see if I've got any wood
[2:13:27] in my building accessories see if I've
[2:13:30] got any stubble any hay
[2:13:33] any combustible substance
[2:13:36] that I would be laying upon the
[2:13:38] apostolic Foundation
[2:13:41] May every man woman boy and girl look at
[2:13:43] their own Hearts tonight the works
[2:13:46] well I've done this for the Lord I've
[2:13:48] done that for the Lord
[2:13:50] but is it gold silver
[2:13:52] precious stones
[2:13:54] now we know wood hay and stubble us
[2:13:57] we can pick it up land on the side of
[2:13:59] the road
[2:14:01] hardly no value to it at all
[2:14:03] fleeting passing
[2:14:05] gold
[2:14:07] most of us probably don't even own a
[2:14:08] piece of it
[2:14:10] silver it's played it it's not even
[2:14:13] probably real
[2:14:14] precious stones
[2:14:17] so Lord that's the way it is with the
[2:14:18] gospel and Paul chose these to show how
[2:14:21] hard they are to get and how precious
[2:14:23] they are when you get them
[2:14:26] Lord God I pray you'll help us
[2:14:30] although we know many times you use
[2:14:31] these even in the parables
[2:14:34] you talked about a pearl
[2:14:36] about the pearl of great price and you
[2:14:39] talked about the gates of that City are
[2:14:41] made out of pearls and then we look at a
[2:14:43] pearl and we know that a pearl is made
[2:14:46] when this little animal down in the
[2:14:48] water
[2:14:50] gets a little irritant inside of its
[2:14:52] body a grain of sand a little tiny piece
[2:14:56] of stone
[2:14:57] and it begins to rub that little old
[2:14:59] tiny animal the wrong way and it starts
[2:15:02] secreting
[2:15:03] this stuff in its body
[2:15:05] to surround that little Thorn that
[2:15:09] little Stone whatever it was
[2:15:12] so a pearl is formed
[2:15:14] out of much labor and pain and anguish
[2:15:19] and ain't no wonder you didn't make the
[2:15:21] gates out of gold and you didn't make
[2:15:23] the gates out of silver
[2:15:25] but you wanted to make the gates out of
[2:15:28] a gigantic Pearl
[2:15:30] every child of God that walks through
[2:15:32] those Gates will look up at them and be
[2:15:35] able to know their life matches the
[2:15:38] entryway to heaven
[2:15:40] because they themselves
[2:15:42] are a pearl as well
[2:15:45] oh Jesus help us tonight father
[2:15:49] forgive us of our mistakes
[2:15:51] forgive us of our wrongs Lord God
[2:15:55] if our building has any wood
[2:15:58] Lord God may we by the grace of God
[2:16:01] tonight
[2:16:02] temporarily pull that thing out
[2:16:05] and replace it with something
[2:16:06] substantial
[2:16:09] something permanent
[2:16:11] it don't necessarily mean we have to
[2:16:12] start all over again but let us just go
[2:16:14] to that one spot and pull it out maybe
[2:16:17] an attitude arrogance whatever more
[2:16:20] Lord God may we be first honest enough
[2:16:23] to admit it
[2:16:25] and then pull it out of our Lives Lord
[2:16:27] God
[2:16:28] we love you tonight Jesus
[2:16:31] how many loves him with all your heart
[2:16:34] you want him just to search you tonight
[2:16:36] friends
[2:16:37] will you say it with me Lord just search
[2:16:38] me
[2:16:40] just search me Lord Jesus you find any
[2:16:42] wood
[2:16:43] any hay any stubble
[2:16:45] anything Lord that will not endure
[2:16:48] help me Lord
[2:16:49] Lord I'm getting up in years if I live a
[2:16:52] couple more months I'll be 67 years old
[2:16:55] I'm only one breath away
[2:16:58] from going into eternity
[2:17:00] I don't want to play I've never wanted
[2:17:02] to play I sure don't want to now Lord
[2:17:05] oh Jesus I want to be true I want to be
[2:17:08] genuine I want to be sincere Lord
[2:17:11] Hallelujah
[2:17:13] help me Lord
[2:17:15] help me my word
[2:17:18] be fire testing
[2:17:20] fire proven
[2:17:22] may my gold
[2:17:24] be able to match the Touchstone
[2:17:27] may my silver
[2:17:29] not be brittle
[2:17:31] but may it withstand the fire
[2:17:34] granted Lord God

[2:18:23] of the Bible
[2:18:25] May every preacher that goes out of this
[2:18:27] church may his ministry
[2:18:29] be based like that in the book of Acts
[2:18:35] May every believer witness that they are
[2:18:38] a bible-believing Christian
[2:18:43] oh Jesus bring your people
[2:18:46] back to the original word

[2:29:51] we know that was nothing we could ever
[2:29:53] give you that would be really worth
[2:29:55] anything
[2:29:57] except you gave it to us first
[2:30:00] so you gave us our gifts and our
[2:30:02] abilities and we wish to bring them back
[2:30:04] to you tonight
[2:30:05] and say would you use them
[2:30:08] would you use them

[2:30:15] Lord God I thank you for this tonight
[2:30:17] it's so
[2:30:18] helps us to understand where a lot of
[2:30:21] folks that are weak so all they're good
[2:30:22] people they're good people yes and many
[2:30:23] of them are good people but yet they
[2:30:25] will labor for many years and they'll
[2:30:28] work will not be able to stand the fire
[2:30:30] but you and your mercy how merciful you
[2:30:33] are that many of those people will be
[2:30:35] saved they will be saved
[2:30:39] but Lord God we don't want to just be
[2:30:40] saved
[2:30:41] but we want to bring to you things
[2:30:45] I don't want to do things for reward
[2:30:47] I want to do things because I'm called
[2:30:50] to work with you
[2:30:52] I'm called to labor with you
[2:30:55] Lord God I pray that should help me
[2:30:58] Jesus as I get older I may not be as
[2:31:01] strong and I may not be able to go like
[2:31:03] I could when I was a younger man
[2:31:05] but as long as you count me fit
[2:31:07] I want to labor as long as you want me
[2:31:09] to labor
[2:31:11] not from my own Glory
[2:31:13] but for you for your people
[2:31:16] Lord God help me
[2:31:18] help me Jesus if there's any wood any
[2:31:21] stubble any hay in me
[2:31:24] show me Jesus I beg you
[2:31:27] show me so I can get rid of it Lord
[2:31:31] the fire is coming
[2:31:34] it's coming Lord
[2:31:36] we want to be able to pass through it
[2:31:38] and we want our works to pass through it
[2:31:40] with us so when we get on the other side
