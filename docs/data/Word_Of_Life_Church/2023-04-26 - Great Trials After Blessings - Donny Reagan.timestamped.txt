[40:49] Lord bless them and be with them
[40:52] Matthew chapter 3 verse 16.
[40:58] and Jesus
[41:00] when he was baptized
[41:03] went up straight way out of the water
[41:05] and lo the heavens were opened unto him
[41:09] and he saw the spirit of God descending
[41:11] like a Dev
[41:13] and lighting upon him
[41:15] and lower voice from Heaven saying this
[41:19] is my beloved Son
[41:21] in whom I am
[41:22] well pleased
[41:24] chapter 4.
[41:26] verse 1.
[41:28] the very next scripture now
[41:30] after this happens they're at the river
[41:34] then when Jesus led up of the spirit
[41:37] Into the Wilderness
[41:39] to be tempted
[41:41] of the devil
[41:44] wow
[41:45] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[41:48] nights he was afterward
[41:50] and hungered
[41:53] you mean after getting the Holy Ghost
[41:56] the very next thing
[41:59] is this
[42:04] listen to this and a sermon called
[42:06] Witnesses brother brannerman says isn't
[42:08] it strange how God
[42:10] leads his people
[42:12] very strange
[42:15] just as soon as Jesus was baptized he
[42:18] went into the Wilderness to be tempted
[42:20] of the devil
[42:22] just as soon as Israel came out under
[42:25] the blood circumcised the Holy Spirit
[42:28] leading them in the form of a light
[42:30] right straight up to the Red Sea and
[42:33] their cornered
[42:35] mountains on one side desert on the
[42:38] other
[42:39] Pharaoh's Army coming and the Red Sea
[42:43] cutting them off
[42:44] God
[42:46] LED them
[42:48] right up to that place
[42:52] then he asked this question why
[42:57] to get Glory
[43:01] praise the Lord
[43:03] to get Glory then Moses prayed and God
[43:07] told him to step right on down toward
[43:09] the Red Sea holding his stick out in
[43:11] front of him as he walked the Red Sea
[43:12] moved from one side to the other right
[43:15] across the Red Sea why God's paths LED
[43:20] through
[43:21] listen at God's path LED through as soon
[43:24] as they came out there right into the
[43:26] Wilderness of sin strange God's past LED
[43:31] right through that great Temptation
[43:33] there
[43:35] when they murmured against God
[43:38] they went from there on and from one
[43:41] murmur to another
[43:42] from one trial to another
[43:48] wow
[43:50] anybody ever been there
[43:53] I'd like to speak to you tonight on this
[43:56] great trials
[43:59] after blessings
[44:02] great trials after blessings how many
[44:06] I'd like to be remembered tonight as we
[44:08] pray God bless you I hold your request
[44:10] in your heart there
[44:12] Heavenly Father we are so grateful to be
[44:14] here Lord and we've already sensed your
[44:16] presence for that we are so grateful
[44:19] Lord God I pray that you would help me
[44:23] to be able to get out of the way tonight
[44:25] Jesus
[44:28] apparently
[44:30] some of your children
[44:32] have some needs
[44:35] I've been studying all week even last
[44:38] week
[44:39] for
[44:40] what I saw
[44:42] tonight's service would be
[44:45] but this evening
[44:47] You Changed Me Lord
[44:49] so I know
[44:51] when you do that it's for a purpose
[44:54] so I pray we would be sensitive to the
[44:58] spirit of God
[44:59] minister to us tonight Lord not only the
[45:02] visible audience but the invisible
[45:04] that'll strain granted father in the
[45:08] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[45:10] amen God bless you you may be seated
[45:18] I'll be the first to admit to you
[45:20] tonight that I sure don't always
[45:22] understand God's ways
[45:26] the way that he leads his people
[45:29] the way that he allows things to happen
[45:32] and things to come up
[45:34] in our lives and things to
[45:37] set us back really
[45:40] and things that will affect us sometimes
[45:44] in a in a very profound positive way and
[45:49] then on the other hand sometimes in a
[45:52] very negative way
[45:54] we scratch our heads as it were and we
[45:57] try to understand it and figure it out
[46:00] and I'm sure you're probably like I am
[46:03] you get to a place to where you think
[46:05] Anthony let me try to figure it out a
[46:07] cane God's way is just so far beyond our
[46:11] way
[46:12] and we read from this tonight in Matthew
[46:16] one of the most profound
[46:19] astounding events that had ever been
[46:22] recorded in the scripture when the
[46:26] father God comes down into his Humanity
[46:31] his word or we call it his son
[46:35] no doubt we are still feeling the
[46:38] reverberation of what happened that day
[46:41] on the river I wonder sometimes if we
[46:44] still comprehend all that was taking
[46:48] place in that one event
[46:51] and yet it was so miraculous so
[46:55] phenomenal so profound
[46:58] so wonderful so outstanding that you
[47:02] think an event like that
[47:04] the the results would be ongoing for
[47:08] weeks and weeks a person living on the
[47:13] after effects of such Glory now the Lord
[47:18] Jesus we believe he was both God and man
[47:22] is that right
[47:24] but we know as far as his Humanity he
[47:28] was not born God he was not born with
[47:32] the fullness of the godhead bodily in
[47:36] him he was a man but he was the word but
[47:40] remember God separated the anointing
[47:43] from the word
[47:45] so he was the word made flesh but so is
[47:48] a tree a tree is the word made bark and
[47:52] leaves and life an animal was the word
[47:57] made skin and hair and all of that so
[48:01] the Lord Jesus was Isaiah 7 14 Isaiah 9
[48:05] 6 Isaiah 35 3 many of those scriptures
[48:08] and he was the word but the father had
[48:11] not yet come in his body
[48:14] and here it happens and we see what a
[48:17] great thing that it was that John
[48:20] hearing this great sound and maybe
[48:23] telling him to lift up his eyes and when
[48:25] he does he sees this Pillar of Fire as
[48:28] it comes down and John hears the voice
[48:31] and this great great event happening on
[48:34] the Earth
[48:36] and you'd think that after this event
[48:39] happening surely the Lord Jesus would go
[48:43] into great healing campaigns wouldn't he
[48:46] go out and just be rejoicing of what had
[48:50] happened in his life he just received
[48:53] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[48:57] if you can take it this way because this
[48:59] is the way the prophet said it he just
[49:02] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:06] and what happened after he received it
[49:09] all hell broke loose
[49:13] I just wonder sometimes after God goes
[49:18] to doing things for us and in our lives
[49:22] and he will allow things like this to
[49:26] happen to us and if he doesn't do it for
[49:29] a great reason and yet we look at it and
[49:33] think something must be wrong
[49:36] something I I must have missed God
[49:39] somehow
[49:40] and when I I got to thinking about this
[49:43] was my mind in the last week or so I've
[49:47] been thinking about the youth camp and
[49:49] thinking about all the hundreds of
[49:52] people that were there use and others
[49:54] that were there as well how many
[49:57] miracles happened and how many lives
[50:00] were touched and changed and affected by
[50:03] the power of God but I know I think kind
[50:05] of strange and weird sometimes but I was
[50:08] also wondering how many of those lives
[50:12] that were so impacted by the power of
[50:15] God I wonder how many of those young
[50:17] people went back home and went back to
[50:20] their church and their job and the the
[50:23] other adults that were there as well and
[50:27] since that week a couple of weeks ago
[50:29] they have had one battle after another
[50:32] after another
[50:34] and I began to think about our own young
[50:37] people that are sitting here tonight
[50:39] wandering in my mind for some of you
[50:42] that felt like you received the Holy
[50:44] Ghost and I wonder if some of you have
[50:46] been battling things in your mind well I
[50:50] must not have got him I messed up after
[50:52] I got back home and I I thought this
[50:55] would happen and that would happen and I
[50:57] began to look at this and realize that
[51:00] sometimes God lets it happen this way
[51:03] after he will do great things for us in
[51:08] our lives and then it's amazing that he
[51:11] doesn't give us a long term sometimes
[51:14] for us to be able to enjoy that
[51:18] tremendous blessing and before you know
[51:21] it when we it are able to receive this
[51:24] thing that God has done whether it's a
[51:27] new job for you or it's a new wife or
[51:29] you got a you know a child it's calm or
[51:32] whatever it is that just such a blessing
[51:35] to you and your home or something has
[51:37] happened and you know you've been
[51:39] waiting for it and longing for it and
[51:41] before you get to really go and enjoy
[51:44] that thing then Here Comes one trial at
[51:47] your Nether and one test after another
[51:49] and it seemed like that it just robs the
[51:53] joy of that Newfound blessing that God
[51:56] gave you in your life and you think Lord
[51:58] why would you let this happen but yet we
[52:02] see here in the life of the Lord Jesus
[52:05] that the Lord Jesus did not even have
[52:09] two hours
[52:12] he did not have from the day of his
[52:16] baptism until the next day or the next
[52:21] week now remember he lived his life on
[52:24] the earth as a man without the Holy
[52:27] Ghost
[52:28] so he lived as he was 8 9 10 then he
[52:32] becomes a teenager then he becomes in
[52:35] his early 20s and then middle 20s late
[52:38] 20s and then now it comes up to 30 years
[52:41] old and he's lived all these years on
[52:44] the earth as a human being without the
[52:48] fullness of the father in him and he
[52:51] gets the fullness of the father in him
[52:53] now we have no record that he shouted or
[52:56] jumped or anything like that we have no
[52:59] record that he's spoke in tongues when
[53:01] he got it but we know that he did speak
[53:03] in tongues later but we really don't
[53:06] have any record of the joy that the Lord
[53:10] Jesus must have felt of him God to be
[53:14] able to receive that of being able to
[53:16] even enjoy it before he goes into this
[53:20] tremendous trial
[53:22] that only only he would be the only one
[53:26] that would ever be able to face such a
[53:28] thing now it was not like he got to
[53:31] enjoy this baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[53:35] fullness of the father coming in him it
[53:38] was just like he went straight from that
[53:40] straight into this tremendous trial now
[53:44] I know we read in Matthew 4 and also
[53:47] Luke 4 and both of them catch this and
[53:50] they both phrase it a little bit
[53:52] differently but we know that there was
[53:54] these three great trials that the Lord
[53:57] Jesus faced and remember he did not face
[54:01] them as an actor that well I'll act like
[54:07] I'm being tempted no he was actually
[54:10] tempted
[54:12] Satan offered him the kingdoms of the
[54:14] world remember I preached it to you
[54:17] years ago a kingdom without a Calvary
[54:20] and the Lord Jesus as a man was tempted
[54:25] to take that easy way
[54:27] now think that he had just received the
[54:31] fullness of the father in him and yet he
[54:35] had hardly any time at all to enjoy
[54:39] whatever that that had brought to his
[54:42] life
[54:42] so he goes straight from there walks
[54:45] right out of the water I'm not talking
[54:47] about three days four days five days but
[54:50] he goes straight out of the water LED of
[54:54] the spirit and the Wilderness to be
[54:57] tempted of the devil I wonder how many
[55:00] here tonight's ever went from a great
[55:02] experience with God or a great blessing
[55:04] with God and it's just you go straight
[55:07] from that into a trial you think Lord
[55:09] what in the world is going on with me
[55:12] well you know you ought to take it in
[55:15] one way as a compliment because there
[55:18] must be something about you that's like
[55:21] the Lord Jesus
[55:23] now you know this does not happen to
[55:27] everyone that professes Christianity
[55:30] this does not happen to everyone who
[55:34] says they are a Believer everyone cannot
[55:39] handle this great caliber of tests and
[55:43] trials now you say oh I wish you didn't
[55:48] love me so much sometimes I understand
[55:51] that feeling yeah you find favor with
[55:53] God you go through trials and tests and
[55:55] sometimes you wish well I wish I didn't
[55:58] have so much favor with him but that's
[56:00] only The Human Side in reality I'm glad
[56:03] I've got favor in his eyes now I know
[56:06] that we tend to look at healing signs
[56:08] wonders Miracles and all of that and we
[56:11] believe every one of those things but to
[56:13] me there's more favor with God than just
[56:16] that because according to the words of
[56:18] the Lord Jesus there will be people that
[56:21] will stand there that day and no doubt
[56:22] there'll be preachers that will be in
[56:24] that group and they're saying we cast
[56:26] out devils in your name heal the sick in
[56:28] your name down this and that and the
[56:30] other and he'll look straight at him and
[56:31] say depart from me you worker of
[56:33] iniquity so just because people have
[56:36] Miracles and signs and wonders don't
[56:38] even mean they're the elect of God is
[56:40] that right but yet God does not cannot
[56:44] give these types of Trials to those that
[56:49] are not his own now notice again we'll
[56:53] read in Matthew chapter 17 verse 1. and
[56:56] after six days Jesus taketh Peter James
[57:00] and John his brother and bring us them
[57:03] up into a high mountain apart and was
[57:06] transfigured before them now I realize
[57:10] we're living in a day whenever the word
[57:13] trans
[57:16] t-r-a-n-s it's in our news media every
[57:20] day if you get a newspaper it's there if
[57:24] you get it or whatever news you've got
[57:26] on your phone trans this and trans that
[57:29] and trying something else well let me
[57:32] tell you what kind of trends that I
[57:34] believe in tonight okay because I do
[57:38] believe in certain Trends and this is
[57:41] one of them transfigured there is a
[57:44] another trans that I believe in and that
[57:48] is transformed
[57:51] amen now this other stuff where you go
[57:54] to a doctor and you were born a boy you
[57:57] were born a boy and when you come out of
[57:59] surgery you're automatically a girl I
[58:02] call that an abomination
[58:05] oh I know they put up a new billboard
[58:08] down on Milligan Highway
[58:11] they put up a new billboard this week
[58:13] down on the Milligan Highway and they're
[58:16] they're saying that uh queer is Holy
[58:20] trans is Holy go down to the whole list
[58:24] and say it is Holy that is an
[58:27] abomination in the eyes of God
[58:31] well praise the Lord
[58:35] but we do believe trans and what I say
[58:38] is all them people who say that need to
[58:40] meet God and be transformed
[58:43] praise the lord well that'll give us
[58:45] some trouble but that's all right what's
[58:47] new about that now notice what happened
[58:49] then the Lord Jesus was transfigured
[58:53] before them and his face did shine as
[58:56] the sun and his raiment was white as
[58:59] light and behold there appeared unto
[59:01] them Moses and Elias talking with him
[59:04] then answered Peter and said unto Jesus
[59:07] Lord it is good for us to be Earth I
[59:10] will let us make three Tabernacles one
[59:13] for Z one for Moses and one for Elias
[59:16] what a great time it must have been an
[59:19] awesome thing like you can imagine that
[59:22] here is Peter James and John they are
[59:26] seeing Moses and Elijah in glorified
[59:30] bodies they are standing there looking
[59:34] at the Lord Jesus and one moment he was
[59:38] Immortal and then they see something
[59:40] sweep over him and they see his visits
[59:44] changed on his face and he becomes white
[59:48] like light emanating out of his presence
[59:51] and Peter gets so torn up that he said
[59:53] oh my what a what a place let us build
[59:56] three Tabernacles let's make one for the
[59:58] law and one for the prophets and one for
[1:00:01] you now you know what this is it is
[1:00:04] emotion Peter is so emotional under this
[1:00:08] presence no doubt he'd never felt
[1:00:10] anything like it before in his life so
[1:00:12] Peter just gets so torn up and he gets
[1:00:16] so emotional but he says something
[1:00:18] totally contrary to what the father is
[1:00:21] going to say now you see this ought to
[1:00:24] be a warning to each of us that when the
[1:00:26] presence of God comes near that we want
[1:00:29] to worship and we want to respond but we
[1:00:32] want to make sure that our emotion does
[1:00:34] not lead us contrary to God's word is
[1:00:37] that right we know the spirit of God
[1:00:39] never does that it'll always be in
[1:00:41] decency in order of course and while he
[1:00:43] yet Spain now while Peter was yet
[1:00:47] talking God interrupted Peter why
[1:00:51] because what Peter had to say wasn't
[1:00:53] right well he got spanked Behold a
[1:00:55] bright Cloud overshadowed them and a
[1:00:58] voice out of the cloud notice a voice
[1:01:01] out of the cloud which said this is my
[1:01:04] beloved Son and whom I am well pleased
[1:01:07] hear ye him it ain't time for Moses to
[1:01:10] talk it ain't time for Elijah to talk
[1:01:13] and it sure ain't time for you to talk
[1:01:15] Peter
[1:01:17] hold your peace what you're saying ain't
[1:01:19] right boy but listen to what Jesus has
[1:01:23] got to say now notice what a great thing
[1:01:26] this was and the presence of God up on
[1:01:30] the mountain and then you imagine the
[1:01:32] apostles as they were standing there and
[1:01:35] they see this thing as it gradually came
[1:01:37] on Jesus and no doubt the glory began to
[1:01:40] dissipate again and it Gloria glory of
[1:01:43] God was little by little by little began
[1:01:46] to leave him and Jesus may be staggering
[1:01:48] as a man and standing there and they had
[1:01:51] to kind of support him because this was
[1:01:53] leaving his flesh I'm sure that as a man
[1:01:57] that it made him weak because the
[1:01:59] woman's One Touch made him weak and the
[1:02:01] Shekinah Glory of God it tends to do
[1:02:04] that to human flesh and maybe Jesus was
[1:02:07] teetering a little bit and kind of
[1:02:09] coming at himself and didn't know what
[1:02:12] to say maybe stuttering a little as he
[1:02:14] talked and all the apostles were sold
[1:02:17] related they were so blessed by what
[1:02:20] they had seen not another mortal dumb
[1:02:23] Through Time had ever seen such a thing
[1:02:26] now what a glory that this was but I
[1:02:29] want you to notice later in this chapter
[1:02:32] now those of you that know the
[1:02:34] chronology of the Bible and the
[1:02:36] chronological order you know that this
[1:02:38] happened not too long before the Lord
[1:02:41] Jesus is going to be crucified so he
[1:02:45] goes from this great Glory he's going to
[1:02:49] Golden shortly after this to Mount
[1:02:52] Calvary but before Calvary ever comes
[1:02:55] notice was me in verse 22 and Matthew 17
[1:02:59] and while they Abode in Galilee Jesus
[1:03:02] said unto them the son of man shall be
[1:03:06] betrayed into the hands of men and they
[1:03:09] shall kill him and the third day he
[1:03:12] shall be raised again and they were
[1:03:15] exceeding sorry now they come straight
[1:03:18] from this Mountaintop experience of
[1:03:21] hearing the voice of God say this is my
[1:03:24] beloved Son and God said this is my son
[1:03:28] so here ye him well now Jesus this is
[1:03:32] what he says they are going to betray me
[1:03:35] I'm going to be so and I'm going to be
[1:03:38] killed well now the son is speaking and
[1:03:41] how did it make them feel it made them
[1:03:43] feel not just sorry but they were
[1:03:46] feeling such an extreme exceeding
[1:03:50] Sadness and Sorrow in the heart after
[1:03:53] such an experience well when you think
[1:03:56] that if the son is going to speak it
[1:03:59] would be you're healed and you're
[1:04:01] delivered and you're set free the son is
[1:04:04] going to speak about death and sorrow
[1:04:10] well you know he does us the same way
[1:04:13] sometimes sometimes he'll tell us well
[1:04:15] you're going to be healed and this is
[1:04:17] going to happen thus saith the Lord
[1:04:19] that's going to happen and then there's
[1:04:21] other times that he gives us encouraging
[1:04:23] scriptures and encouraging quotes which
[1:04:26] lets us know our healing is down the
[1:04:29] road maybe a waste it don't mean he's
[1:04:31] going to do it tomorrow now don't sit
[1:04:33] there and look at me like that don't
[1:04:35] discourage you it does me whenever I'm
[1:04:38] praying I told the Lord the other day I
[1:04:40] said Lord I need a word from you so bad
[1:04:43] I'm begging you give me a word God you
[1:04:47] know you know where I'm at you know Lord
[1:04:50] what I'm praying about you know I need a
[1:04:54] word from you so bad
[1:04:56] and you know what he said
[1:04:58] nothing
[1:05:01] I told him the next day the same thing
[1:05:03] you know what he said nothing
[1:05:06] I told him the same thing today you know
[1:05:10] what he said nothing
[1:05:12] to me but gave me this for you
[1:05:17] something and sir do you know my address
[1:05:19] you need to email you need my phone
[1:05:21] number so you can text me so I could
[1:05:23] just bypass me
[1:05:25] but he wanted you to hear this
[1:05:28] well maybe my words after you tonight
[1:05:30] right
[1:05:32] now so brother Daniel you so discouraged
[1:05:35] you're going to quit are you kidding me
[1:05:36] quit how could I quit something I never
[1:05:39] started in the first place
[1:05:41] well does that mean that now you've got
[1:05:43] a problem with God absolutely I have no
[1:05:46] problem with God I've got a problem with
[1:05:48] me
[1:05:49] I'm always a hindrance it ain't never
[1:05:51] been God I've been serving him all my
[1:05:53] life and I he ain't never been no
[1:05:55] problem it's always been me anybody else
[1:05:58] honest enough here tonight to say the
[1:06:00] same thing about yourself
[1:06:02] now notice how that whenever the Lord
[1:06:05] Jesus bringing this straight from this
[1:06:08] Mountaintop experience and the sun
[1:06:10] speaks and the sun brings a message of
[1:06:14] exceeding sadness and something that
[1:06:17] would bring them a heaviness of their
[1:06:20] heart I wonder how many of you young
[1:06:22] people that was at the camp down in
[1:06:24] Louisiana if any all had any trials
[1:06:28] and test and difficulties since you got
[1:06:31] back home and oh brother Jonathan ah Oh
[1:06:35] Brother John you're not even a young
[1:06:36] person you raised your hand well
[1:06:38] apparently these things are not respect
[1:06:40] to persons 18 and under anyone else any
[1:06:43] of you young people and you come back so
[1:06:46] fired up and now you're saying well Lord
[1:06:48] why in the world happened to me I'm like
[1:06:50] an old models here
[1:06:52] I can hardly stand still down to Camp
[1:06:55] what in the world is a matter of me I
[1:06:57] feel so draggy well maybe you're falling
[1:06:59] in the footsteps of the Lord Jesus but
[1:07:02] let me just encourage you tonight to
[1:07:04] tell you that I don't think the Lord
[1:07:07] wants our expectation to be high just
[1:07:10] for Louisiana Youth Camp and then we
[1:07:12] come back to our home church and well
[1:07:15] it's church as usual it's brother Donnie
[1:07:18] it's brother Daryl it's whoever it is no
[1:07:20] I believe our expectation ought to be
[1:07:23] through this Ruth when we come in here
[1:07:26] because he's the same God right here in
[1:07:29] Johnson City as he was in Dry Creek
[1:07:31] Louisiana
[1:07:34] is that right
[1:07:35] but we have to understand sometimes
[1:07:38] what's going on now notice how Luke
[1:07:42] relates this in Luke chapter 9 verse 37
[1:07:45] Luke brings it this way that when Jesus
[1:07:48] comes off of the mountain the mount
[1:07:50] Transfiguration and it came to pass that
[1:07:52] on the next day when they were come down
[1:07:56] from the hill much people met him and
[1:08:00] behold a man of the company cried out
[1:08:03] saying master I beseech thee look upon
[1:08:05] my son for his mine only child and Lois
[1:08:09] Spirit take us in he suddenly cross out
[1:08:12] and it tells him that he foam us again
[1:08:15] and bruising him hardly departed from
[1:08:19] him and I Basalt thy disciples to cast
[1:08:22] him out and they could not so hear the
[1:08:25] Lord Jesus now comes down from this
[1:08:27] great experience and Luke in his own way
[1:08:30] writes it a little bit different than
[1:08:32] the other authors do and he catches this
[1:08:34] so we could see seeing that after Jesus
[1:08:37] coming off of the mountain that he meets
[1:08:40] a disappointment and who's this
[1:08:42] disappointment with it's with the
[1:08:45] preachers that are following him so this
[1:08:48] man brings his boy to the message
[1:08:51] preachers and the message preachers of
[1:08:54] that day they pray for him and pray for
[1:08:56] him and who knows what they've done but
[1:08:58] they could not get this Spirit to leave
[1:09:01] him now here's the Lord Jesus after this
[1:09:03] great experience can you imagine how he
[1:09:06] must have felt as a man disappointment
[1:09:09] the disappointment of these men are the
[1:09:12] ones that's going to take the message on
[1:09:14] these are the men that I've given them
[1:09:16] power remember he had already given them
[1:09:18] excusing authority to cast out evil
[1:09:22] spirits but this one was a tough one
[1:09:24] this one was one that could not just be
[1:09:28] cast out by little feeling this one had
[1:09:31] to come by prayer and fasting now the
[1:09:35] Lord Jesus then is met with this I want
[1:09:37] you to notice how he addresses them I
[1:09:39] the salt thy disciples to cast them out
[1:09:41] and they could not Jesus answering and
[1:09:44] said oh faithless and perverse
[1:09:47] Generation Now can you imagine coming
[1:09:50] out of the glory of God and seeing the
[1:09:53] Lord Jesus in his future Kingdom what
[1:09:56] happened on the mount Transfiguration
[1:09:58] which they say was Tabor Mount Tabor
[1:10:00] whenever John and Peter and James saw
[1:10:04] that it was a pre-figure of what is
[1:10:08] going to be the onset of the kingdom of
[1:10:10] God that was the Lord Jesus the
[1:10:13] resurrected Son of God that was Moses
[1:10:16] the resurrected death that was Elijah
[1:10:19] those which are alive and changed that
[1:10:22] was Peter James and John three that were
[1:10:25] standing there not in glorified bodies
[1:10:28] there were the people at the bottom of
[1:10:30] the foot of the mountain a pre-figure of
[1:10:33] the coming Kingdom of the Son of God and
[1:10:37] yet he has to leave that glory and come
[1:10:39] out and address a people like this and a
[1:10:43] way of rebuke what a contrast so he
[1:10:46] leaves that kind of Glory of God and he
[1:10:50] has to address people and call them by
[1:10:53] these terms oh faithless and perverse
[1:10:56] generation
[1:10:58] what a grieving that must have been to
[1:11:01] the Lord Jesus how
[1:11:03] will I be with you
[1:11:06] you suffer you
[1:11:09] you come straight on the mountain out of
[1:11:11] the glory of God and he has to stand up
[1:11:13] there and rebuke the people and say how
[1:11:17] long am I even going to put up with you
[1:11:18] all you imagine them saying Lord have
[1:11:21] mercy what kind of preacher is this boy
[1:11:23] he must have got up on the wrong side of
[1:11:25] the bed no he'd ever it wasn't him on
[1:11:27] the wrong side of the bed it's them on
[1:11:28] the wrong side of faith
[1:11:30] and you see when God will have his
[1:11:32] servants to rebuke us that ain't because
[1:11:34] God dislikes us and it's not because
[1:11:36] they dislike us it's to shake us out of
[1:11:39] a faithless time that we're going
[1:11:41] through and to shake ourselves and
[1:11:43] realize these things are part of being a
[1:11:47] child of God and actually we prove our
[1:11:50] faithfulness to God when the trial hits
[1:11:53] us out to the blessing more so than we
[1:11:56] do when we're getting the blessing when
[1:11:58] it comes you see it's really easy all my
[1:12:01] you young people that was on you adults
[1:12:03] that was there and the anointing was so
[1:12:05] great and the miraculous was so great
[1:12:07] absolutely phenomenal oh my goodness I
[1:12:09] believe about anybody could live right
[1:12:11] in that atmosphere but that is not the
[1:12:13] way it works you're going to leave from
[1:12:15] there and you're going to go back to
[1:12:16] your home back to your school back to
[1:12:18] your job same way with any of you that
[1:12:21] God has moved for you and you're going
[1:12:22] to face things it's going to be so
[1:12:24] difficult it's like well what happened
[1:12:26] absolutely nothing you're in the
[1:12:28] footsteps of Jesus Christ we we sang the
[1:12:31] song to be like Jesus oh how long to be
[1:12:35] like him do we do we want to be like him
[1:12:37] like this or we just want signs wonders
[1:12:41] and miracles
[1:12:43] well praise the Lord
[1:12:46] now notice Oh my Jesus says how long
[1:12:50] shall I be with you and suffer you bring
[1:12:52] thy son hither notice again now down at
[1:12:57] verse 46 so we again come off of the
[1:13:00] mountain he has to deal with this
[1:13:02] faithless and perverse generation and
[1:13:05] then verse 46 then there arose a
[1:13:08] reasoning among them
[1:13:11] which of them shall be the greatest now
[1:13:14] no doubt this is preachers of course
[1:13:17] which of them should be the greatest can
[1:13:19] you imagine the Lord Jesus has just the
[1:13:23] day before stood in this glorified
[1:13:26] premature glorified condition and he's
[1:13:29] got to hear these guys arguing and
[1:13:32] fussing of which one of them is going to
[1:13:34] have the biggest church or the biggest
[1:13:36] Ministry or who streams them more or we
[1:13:40] have more live views than you do and we
[1:13:43] do this and that and the other how
[1:13:44] carnal
[1:13:46] and the Lord Jesus has to step out of
[1:13:49] the glory of God and come back down to
[1:13:52] the Earth to deal with this kind of
[1:13:54] stuff sort of like you coming out of the
[1:13:57] presence of God and having to go to
[1:13:59] school and having to go to work having
[1:14:02] to go to family members that sometimes
[1:14:04] don't believe what you believe or people
[1:14:06] that just wants to argue and fast and
[1:14:09] debate and you think my goodness what in
[1:14:11] the world is a matter of me don't sound
[1:14:13] like to me there's nothing matter with
[1:14:15] you it just sounds like you're going in
[1:14:18] the same way the Lord Jesus went I wish
[1:14:20] somebody would preach with me tonight so
[1:14:23] what are we going to do when we come to
[1:14:25] these times of verse 22 verse 46 what
[1:14:29] are we going to do we're going to say
[1:14:31] well I guess I didn't get nothing I
[1:14:33] guess I didn't get the Holy Ghost after
[1:14:34] all I went through the prayer line and I
[1:14:37] guess I didn't get one thing you're
[1:14:38] letting the devil talk to you right out
[1:14:40] of your Miracle you're letting the devil
[1:14:43] talk you right out of the blessing the
[1:14:45] god the brother Donnie God I got the
[1:14:47] Holy Ghost said can't and I made a
[1:14:49] mistake and I fell short of the glory of
[1:14:51] God Welcome to the Real World
[1:14:54] this is after count this is after Sunday
[1:14:58] morning this is after our dedication
[1:15:01] service this is after when the special
[1:15:03] speaker preaches and we say oh my oh
[1:15:06] glory to God oh I love special meetings
[1:15:08] I love special meat but don't you
[1:15:10] understand what makes special meetings
[1:15:12] special if we didn't have the special
[1:15:14] presence of God already here on
[1:15:17] Wednesday and Sunday before the special
[1:15:19] meetings they wouldn't be near special
[1:15:21] as they are so you see about our
[1:15:25] everyday walk with God our everyday
[1:15:27] pressing but brother Donnie sometimes I
[1:15:30] come to church and I don't feel like
[1:15:31] cropping my hands I understand sometimes
[1:15:34] I come to church and I just feel so down
[1:15:37] I understand so you say well I ain't
[1:15:39] going to clap my hands in okay so I'll
[1:15:41] make a deal with you sometimes I come to
[1:15:43] church I don't feel like preaching
[1:15:46] [Applause]
[1:15:48] so if I walk out and you're not saying
[1:15:50] amen and you're not crapping your hand
[1:15:52] does that mean the deal between me and
[1:15:54] you is as long as you're silent I don't
[1:15:56] have to preach
[1:15:58] as long as you're just sitting there
[1:15:59] looking at me then I'm going to sit down
[1:16:01] in this chair and look at you
[1:16:04] oh you don't like that kind of deal do
[1:16:05] you but how do you want me to be
[1:16:09] I'm going to stand up like this
[1:16:15] I've been having a hard time
[1:16:21] it's been mighty rough

[1:16:45] don't feel like it we're going to sing
[1:16:47] with all of our hearts we're going to
[1:16:49] clap our hands we're going to worship
[1:16:51] amen but mother Donny you mean we even
[1:16:54] when we don't feel it especially when we
[1:16:57] don't feel it because it's a whole lot
[1:16:59] easier to jump up and down when the
[1:17:01] anointing is all over you it's a whole
[1:17:03] lot easier to say devil where are you at
[1:17:05] when the anointing is all over and your
[1:17:07] hair sticking up on the back of your
[1:17:08] neck it's another thing when you don't
[1:17:10] feel God nowhere it's another thing when
[1:17:13] it seemed like God's ten thousand miles
[1:17:15] from you and you still stand up to the
[1:17:17] Jonathan say you better back off devil
[1:17:19] cause I'm a Son of God when I feel it

[1:17:27] when I don't amen I may be down good
[1:17:30] dealing in verse 22 I may be down here

[1:17:36] overcomer well I'm in verse 1 or verse 5
[1:17:40] or verse 22 or verse 46 I want to be an
[1:17:44] overcomer in ever verse I want to be an
[1:17:48] overcomer when I'm sick when I'm weary
[1:17:50] if I get down if I get blue I want to be
[1:17:53] able to stand and look that devil in the
[1:17:55] face and say dude
[1:17:58] devil
[1:18:00] [Applause]
[1:18:09] well John I want to ask you a question
[1:18:11] buddy
[1:18:12] did you feel kind of down the other
[1:18:13] night after you preached
[1:18:18] you think of that
[1:18:20] field down after you preach
[1:18:23] you do
[1:18:26] now I want you to think of that
[1:18:28] a man that's been preaching for decades
[1:18:30] of his life
[1:18:33] seemed great Miracles well these days
[1:18:35] you folks will realize how God uses our
[1:18:37] brother
[1:18:38] they don't go around telling everybody
[1:18:40] but it's phenomenal the things that God
[1:18:43] has done through it
[1:18:46] I'd rather give him Rose now than
[1:18:48] whenever they wrote them up here tonight
[1:18:49] to pre-children
[1:18:51] raise the Lord
[1:18:53] but does he always feel like it no
[1:18:56] he said how do you know because he's
[1:18:58] calling me before
[1:19:01] laying on the floor in the motel room
[1:19:05] on his back with his legs up on the bed
[1:19:08] like this
[1:19:09] crying and agony and pain
[1:19:13] brother Donnie I've got to go preach in
[1:19:15] a few minutes would you please pray for
[1:19:16] me I don't think I can do it
[1:19:21] but you know what he'd done he got up
[1:19:23] got dressed went mashed the Devil's
[1:19:26] Mouth
[1:19:31] oh God
[1:19:36] oh Hallelujah
[1:19:39] notice this other rows of reasoning
[1:19:41] among them which of them should be the
[1:19:42] greatest in Jesus perceiving the thought
[1:19:45] of the heart took a child
[1:19:47] and set him by him and he said unto them
[1:19:49] whosoever shall receive this child in my
[1:19:51] name receiveth me and whosoever
[1:19:54] receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
[1:19:56] for he that is least among you all the
[1:19:59] same shall be great now as humbling
[1:20:01] these Apostles and John notices and John
[1:20:05] answered and said Master we saw one
[1:20:07] casting out devils in thy name and we
[1:20:10] forbade him glory to God
[1:20:13] John the Beloved one of where he's
[1:20:16] beloved went then
[1:20:20] we forbade him because
[1:20:23] he didn't go to our church
[1:20:28] I hate that old stinking denominational
[1:20:30] thing
[1:20:32] because he followeth not us wow John
[1:20:38] John of all people John
[1:20:41] and Jesus said unto him forbid him not
[1:20:43] for he that is not against us is for us
[1:20:46] and it came to pass when the time was
[1:20:49] come that he should be received up he
[1:20:52] steadfastly set his face to go to
[1:20:55] Jerusalem look
[1:20:56] this happened all this great thing and
[1:20:59] that he's hit was one thing after
[1:21:01] another among who the Pharisees the
[1:21:03] scribes
[1:21:04] his followers
[1:21:07] you can expect infidels to do this you
[1:21:10] can expect heathens and unbelievers to
[1:21:13] do this but when believers do it
[1:21:15] preacher Apostles Peter James John
[1:21:19] oh how discouraging
[1:21:21] it must have been
[1:21:23] and he set his face
[1:21:25] to go to Jerusalem
[1:21:28] I sit in Messengers before his face and
[1:21:30] they went and entered into the village
[1:21:32] and they went notice other Samaritans to
[1:21:34] make ready for him and they did not
[1:21:37] receive him
[1:21:39] so you come straight from this mountain
[1:21:43] people don't understand
[1:21:45] Apostles fussing your Apostles can't
[1:21:48] cast out Devils now you're going to just
[1:21:51] going through this Village
[1:21:54] and they won't even receive you there
[1:21:57] I wonder how he must have felt to take
[1:22:01] this attitude now to the cross
[1:22:07] instead of having people standing there
[1:22:09] on the side oh Jesus die for me Jesus
[1:22:12] died for me go please I beg you please
[1:22:15] please I need it I need it
[1:22:17] instead they were laughing making fun
[1:22:20] ridiculing
[1:22:22] and not one of the Apostles except for
[1:22:25] John
[1:22:26] was even there with him
[1:22:28] to incur
[1:22:35] oh my goodness
[1:22:38] and then we complain about what we have
[1:22:40] to go through
[1:22:42] now notice what happens
[1:22:45] they wouldn't receive Jesus and when his
[1:22:48] disciples James and John saw this
[1:22:50] they said Lord
[1:22:52] will thou that we command fire
[1:22:56] to come down from heaven
[1:22:59] and consume them we've got a scripture
[1:23:02] for it
[1:23:05] even as Elias did
[1:23:08] glory to God I feel it
[1:23:13] ain't
[1:23:14] right our lord Jesus that way are you
[1:23:17] one you want us to do it
[1:23:20] well I hate to inform them but they
[1:23:22] couldn't have done it you know why their
[1:23:25] attitude was totally wrong
[1:23:28] we don't believe me listen what Jesus
[1:23:30] said
[1:23:31] but he turned and rebuked them
[1:23:36] and all of this happens
[1:23:39] after Mount Transfiguration
[1:23:45] but he turned and rebuked them and said
[1:23:47] ye know not what manner of spirit
[1:23:52] you are of
[1:23:54] you kind of reminds me of us sometimes
[1:23:56] and folks cross us
[1:23:58] we're ready to turn them into serpent
[1:24:00] seed bless God how could they be brought
[1:24:02] out you know what ain't none of us got
[1:24:04] no magnifying glass and we got the Holy
[1:24:06] Ghost to look down in people's soul and
[1:24:08] see if their seed or not let God do the
[1:24:10] sort and friends let's just live right
[1:24:13] and do what's right let God take care of
[1:24:15] all the rest of that stuff he's the only
[1:24:17] one that can anyway
[1:24:19] so what are we seeing that great trials
[1:24:23] can come after such wonderful wonderful
[1:24:27] phenomenal blessings
[1:24:29] and it's not that you're out of the will
[1:24:31] of God when you're going through it
[1:24:33] so when God brings the children of
[1:24:36] Israel
[1:24:37] out of the land of Egypt ma they hardly
[1:24:41] get any time at all to be able to enjoy
[1:24:43] the blessings of God to enjoy their
[1:24:45] freedom they've been down there for 430
[1:24:48] years
[1:24:49] they don't even have it a few days
[1:24:52] before the tasks start coming
[1:24:55] and you say God why would you do this
[1:24:58] why would you do this why not let us
[1:25:01] enjoy our Newfound Liberty why would you
[1:25:04] send us straight into trials
[1:25:09] Exodus 32 15 and Moses turned it went
[1:25:12] down from the mount now remember it's
[1:25:14] been up there
[1:25:17] receiving the law of God
[1:25:19] Erica sent me a little thing the other
[1:25:21] day
[1:25:22] and it said
[1:25:24] had a thing of Moses standing in there
[1:25:26] with the Ten Commandments in his hand
[1:25:28] and he said Moses was the first one to
[1:25:30] use a tablet
[1:25:36] foreign
[1:25:39] 's been messing up like crazy it was
[1:25:41] acting up back on the office before I
[1:25:43] come out Moses had one that wasn't made
[1:25:45] by iPad
[1:25:46] so Apple had nothing to do with it so
[1:25:48] it's pretty reliable I figured don't you
[1:25:51] written with a finger of God
[1:25:54] coming out of that and Moses face so
[1:25:57] shown that they had to put a veil over
[1:26:00] his face because he'd been with God so
[1:26:02] long he took on the very image of God
[1:26:06] oh
[1:26:07] Moses turned and went down from the
[1:26:10] mound and the two tables of the
[1:26:11] testimony were in his hand
[1:26:13] the tables were written on both their
[1:26:15] sides one on the one side and one on the
[1:26:17] other they written and the tables the
[1:26:20] work of God and the riding was the
[1:26:22] writing of God
[1:26:24] great and upon the tables
[1:26:27] when Joshua heard the noise of the
[1:26:29] people as they shouted he said unto
[1:26:31] Moses there's a noise of war in the camp
[1:26:34] and he said it's not the voice of them
[1:26:36] to shout for Mastery neither is the
[1:26:39] voice of them to cry for being overcome
[1:26:40] it is the noise of them that sing do I
[1:26:43] hear
[1:26:44] now notice you come straight
[1:26:47] from the very presence of God
[1:26:50] and it came to pass as soon as it came
[1:26:52] down to the camp he saw
[1:26:55] oh my Lord
[1:26:57] the calf
[1:27:01] so you come straight from God's presence
[1:27:03] into your church and you see the people
[1:27:07] practicing idolatry worshiping a calf
[1:27:15] now you know there's a paradox about
[1:27:16] Moses I can't say that I understand
[1:27:19] the Bible says that Moses was the
[1:27:21] meekest man on the Earth
[1:27:23] that that old boy had a temper like a
[1:27:25] buzz saw
[1:27:27] I'm not sure how that goes together I've
[1:27:29] met a few people like that myself I know
[1:27:31] a few preachers like that actually and
[1:27:33] yet he was the meekest man that was on
[1:27:35] the Earth but still yet had a real
[1:27:37] temper now I want you to notice what
[1:27:39] this does to him
[1:27:41] it so bends him out of shape as we say
[1:27:45] that he came to pass as soon as he came
[1:27:47] down to the camp that he saw the calf
[1:27:49] and the dancing and Moses
[1:27:53] anger walks hot
[1:27:56] and he cast the tables out of his hands
[1:28:02] and break them beneath the mountain I'm
[1:28:04] going to tell them at six months after
[1:28:05] he was up there we're not talking about
[1:28:07] three years we're talking about he comes
[1:28:10] straight from the Mountain of God and
[1:28:12] takes the journey down and he comes down
[1:28:14] and hears the noise and he sees the calf
[1:28:16] and just immediately out of the presence
[1:28:18] of God gets so upset and you know who
[1:28:22] did it
[1:28:23] it was not the oxen of the camp it was
[1:28:25] not the sheep of the camp natural sheep
[1:28:27] it was not camels it was not animals
[1:28:31] it was his people
[1:28:35] his people
[1:28:38] mom
[1:28:40] and he took the calf which they had made
[1:28:42] him burn it in the fire ground it to
[1:28:45] powder
[1:28:46] of course no doubt all this has been
[1:28:48] done in such meekness and humility
[1:28:51] now you imagine him just taking the
[1:28:53] powder the calf and just Oh Glory to God
[1:28:57] he set me free I imagine there's some
[1:29:00] slamming ones
[1:29:07] God said calm down Moses calm down
[1:29:11] you don't want to know that water to
[1:29:12] your boy
[1:29:15] he burned it with fire and grounded to
[1:29:17] powder and swallowed it upon the Water
[1:29:20] and made the children of Israel
[1:29:23] drank
[1:29:24] so you go straight from that
[1:29:27] to this
[1:29:29] in your church so this is your first
[1:29:31] service after you receive your tablet
[1:29:37] didn't even have time to preach on it
[1:29:41] since I'd like to read my text now from
[1:29:44] the first commandment and then tomorrow
[1:29:46] now we're starting a series I'm taking
[1:29:47] the 10 9 series and I'm going to call it
[1:29:49] the Ten Commandments
[1:29:51] well praise the Lord let me tell you
[1:29:53] some Charlton Heston couldn't have
[1:29:54] touched the original Moses I guarantee
[1:29:56] you that the man never even got to
[1:29:58] preach the first time remember the
[1:29:59] Harvey because the people were so far
[1:30:02] out of sync with God and it's so upset
[1:30:04] Moses coming straight where no man had
[1:30:08] ever walked not even Abraham's
[1:30:11] countenance was ever changed like Moses
[1:30:14] was
[1:30:21] lost after God
[1:30:24] speaks to his servant Abraham
[1:30:27] and brings him
[1:30:30] a great lamb of Deliverance
[1:30:33] on Mount Moriah
[1:30:37] the Lord God
[1:30:39] had worked a miracle and created a ram
[1:30:42] in the bushes
[1:30:46] what a great experience
[1:30:49] and the very next written verse
[1:30:53] about the life of Abraham
[1:30:57] is Sarah
[1:30:59] died
[1:31:04] so from Jehovah Jireh
[1:31:08] Mount Moriah
[1:31:10] my son lives you imagine coming off that
[1:31:13] mountain brother Paul running and
[1:31:15] skipping Hallelujah
[1:31:18] Praise Adonai praise Jehovah
[1:31:23] and the very next verse of scripture
[1:31:26] says and Sarah
[1:31:29] died
[1:31:34] don't you understand why real
[1:31:36] Christianity
[1:31:37] can be so perplexing to people
[1:31:41] why many will come
[1:31:43] and they will turn away
[1:31:45] they just cannot handle the extremes
[1:31:49] as everybody anybody ever been there
[1:31:51] three of you four five six seven eight
[1:31:53] left
[1:31:54] to where you get in the presence of God
[1:31:56] and it is so wonderful and you have such
[1:31:59] an awesome service or maybe an
[1:32:01] experience of God in your home or
[1:32:02] whatever it is and you go from that to
[1:32:05] some terrible terrible thing that has
[1:32:07] happened some horrible news and you
[1:32:09] think God how
[1:32:17] Elijah's we looked at him not long ago
[1:32:21] standing up on the mountain
[1:32:23] calling fire out of heaven
[1:32:26] killing 400 Prophets
[1:32:30] and the very next day running from the
[1:32:32] threat
[1:32:33] of one woman
[1:32:36] I cannot imagine the anointing that was
[1:32:38] on that man that he would be able to
[1:32:40] take some type of instrument of
[1:32:42] Slaughter and one man killed 400 false
[1:32:46] prophets in a setting
[1:32:50] oh yeah
[1:32:51] 400 of them
[1:32:53] and then the very next day run for his
[1:32:56] life like a coward
[1:32:58] I did under a juniper tree and asked God
[1:33:01] to kill him he didn't even want to live
[1:33:04] another day
[1:33:06] from one extreme to the other great
[1:33:09] trials
[1:33:10] that fall
[1:33:12] great blessings
[1:33:15] oh Lord Jesus
[1:33:18] after the birth of the church and great
[1:33:21] power and miracles were given
[1:33:23] acts 5 17 then the high priest rose up
[1:33:27] and all they that were with him which is
[1:33:29] the sect of the Sadducees
[1:33:31] and we're filled with indignation sure
[1:33:33] they were anointed of the devil I laid
[1:33:36] the hands on the apostles and put them
[1:33:39] in the common prison Well Jack they
[1:33:41] don't even get to enjoy this new and
[1:33:44] feeling that they've had they do a
[1:33:46] miracle or two and automatically all
[1:33:48] this starts turning loose all hell
[1:33:50] breaks loose all around them
[1:33:52] look in chapter 12 verse 2 and King
[1:33:55] Herod of course is who this referencing
[1:33:57] and he killed James the brother of John
[1:34:00] with a sword
[1:34:02] and because he saw it please the Jews he
[1:34:05] proceeded further to take Peter also
[1:34:09] then were the days of unleavened bread
[1:34:12] so they don't get to come to church and
[1:34:14] enjoy their new church
[1:34:16] they don't get to come and enjoy this
[1:34:18] brand new move that God has never done
[1:34:21] it doesn't hardly last no time till All
[1:34:24] Hell Comes against them
[1:34:27] and what did they do
[1:34:29] get discouraged and stay home
[1:34:32] get signed and stay home oh I just don't
[1:34:34] think it's worth it I just don't think
[1:34:36] it's worth all the hassle they're going
[1:34:38] through they kept right on preaching
[1:34:40] anyhow
[1:34:41] now I guarantee you one thing we
[1:34:42] probably wouldn't have near as many
[1:34:44] preachers in this message if we went
[1:34:46] back to the acts too and if there was a
[1:34:48] risk of every message preacher been
[1:34:50] thrown in jail every time he'd preached
[1:34:53] I figured we'd get down to the real ones
[1:34:55] either that would not be a few crazy
[1:34:56] ones left but I figured that our numbers
[1:34:59] would definitely be a lot thinner than
[1:35:01] what they are right now because you know
[1:35:04] that you can be thrown in jail and what
[1:35:06] did it do to these guys they kept right
[1:35:08] on preaching like there was no Herod
[1:35:11] they kept right on preaching because
[1:35:13] they were called by God to do so and
[1:35:17] somehow they understood by hearing the
[1:35:20] teaching of the Lord Jesus and had been
[1:35:22] quickened to him by the holy ghost that
[1:35:24] these things must happen after great
[1:35:27] blessings they just got the Holy Ghost
[1:35:28] they just got their life changed they
[1:35:31] just got filled with the father himself
[1:35:33] and they expected all hell to break
[1:35:36] loose young people let me encourage you
[1:35:38] tonight you got the holy ghost at the
[1:35:41] used Camp then just look for it the
[1:35:43] devil's going to come but keep this in
[1:35:45] mind you've got more to face him with us
[1:35:47] than you had pre-use cap you've got more
[1:35:51] on your sides you've got more living
[1:35:53] inside of you that will give you the
[1:35:55] ability well what am I supposed to do
[1:35:58] brother Donnie Kim right on pressing on
[1:36:00] you older people said in your tonight
[1:36:03] you're going through a hard time oh
[1:36:05] brother Donald the Lord's been so good
[1:36:06] to me and he just blessed me here a few
[1:36:08] weeks ago but this and that of the other
[1:36:09] and it seemed like all hell broke loose
[1:36:11] well that's exactly what I'm talking
[1:36:13] about tonight and what are you going to
[1:36:15] do you're going to keep right on
[1:36:16] pressing you're not letting the devil
[1:36:19] not gain one inch as a matter of fact
[1:36:21] we're going to take away from him
[1:36:23] because it is our rights it is our
[1:36:26] privileges as the Sons and Daughters of
[1:36:29] God so let me put hell on notice tonight
[1:36:32] devil Let My People Go Let My People Go
[1:36:36] you try to hold them with bondage of
[1:36:40] Oppression and sadness and whatever more
[1:36:42] in the name of the Lord Jesus we have
[1:36:45] been called of God to bring Deliverance
[1:36:48] to the people of God Satan ain't got no
[1:36:51] right to claim you and I tonight in the
[1:36:54] name of Jesus Shake him off
[1:36:57] Hallelujah Shake him off but I don't
[1:37:00] feel I could shake him off anyhow I
[1:37:03] don't fill out praise from the Lord
[1:37:04] Praise Him anyhow
[1:37:11] great trials
[1:37:13] after blessings
[1:37:15] you see this is the law that we're under
[1:37:18] right now the law
[1:37:21] of contrast
[1:37:23] but it ain't going to be very long I'm
[1:37:25] going to close
[1:37:26] the law of contrast or no longer be
[1:37:29] needed
[1:37:30] and will no longer be living under it
[1:37:34] and when the Law changes
[1:37:36] after we get great blessings
[1:37:39] they'll be even greater in store
[1:37:42] so when you've been there Ten Thousand
[1:37:46] Years bright shining as the sun you've
[1:37:50] no less days to sing God's praise than
[1:37:53] when you first begun do you understand
[1:37:56] it will take
[1:37:58] Eternity for him to continuously be
[1:38:01] unveiling himself to us you imagine for
[1:38:05] you think you're going to get bored In
[1:38:06] Heaven There is no way in the world we
[1:38:09] are ever going to get bored ain't
[1:38:10] nobody's going to say myself well what
[1:38:12] are we going to do today what are we
[1:38:13] going to do day birthday and where are
[1:38:15] we going to go what are we going to do
[1:38:16] my goodness we've been your 385 million
[1:38:19] 975
[1:38:20] 331 days aren't you getting a little bit
[1:38:23] bored what are we going to do he'll
[1:38:25] still be revealing himself if we could
[1:38:28] even measure time as far as millions of
[1:38:30] years it would go on he's still
[1:38:32] revealing himself and you're not tired
[1:38:35] you're not weary you're not going
[1:38:37] anywhere you ain't got no watch praise
[1:38:40] the Lord for that you ain't got no time
[1:38:42] clock to punch you ain't got no schedule
[1:38:44] to be there and to be somewhere else
[1:38:46] y'all ever feel like you're going 40
[1:38:48] different directions at the same time
[1:38:50] and you're trying to keep up with
[1:38:51] everything we live in a stressful age
[1:38:53] did we not but don't worry children
[1:38:55] there's a Time coming well there won't
[1:38:58] be no stress in that land there ain't
[1:39:00] going to be no schedules for you to keep
[1:39:02] there ain't going to be no appointment
[1:39:04] that you got to go to praise the Lord
[1:39:06] there'll be doctors there but they just
[1:39:08] won't be practicing no more they'll be
[1:39:10] former dentists there but they won't be
[1:39:12] feeling nobody's teeth they'll be
[1:39:14] preachers of it that won't be making no
[1:39:16] other cause and they won't be laying
[1:39:18] hands on those sex because they have
[1:39:21] finally reached the spot till where
[1:39:23] blessings follow blessings and goodness
[1:39:26] follows goodness and the great things of
[1:39:29] God is followed by more great things of
[1:39:31] God
[1:39:33] the second
[1:39:38] oh Hallelujah
[1:39:46] praise the Lord
[1:39:49] praise the Lord
[1:39:51] oh don't you love him
[1:39:53] oh my how many can relate to what I'm
[1:39:56] talking about tonight
[1:39:57] you know the thing with his friends if
[1:39:59] we're not aware of such things
[1:40:01] Satan will try to convince us we've done
[1:40:03] something wrong oh we've missed the Lord
[1:40:05] somehow well if we have let's just fix
[1:40:07] it and go on if you've done something
[1:40:08] wrong if you fell short of the glory of
[1:40:10] God repent make the thing right and go
[1:40:11] on don't wallow in that thing and let it
[1:40:13] steal your victory for the rest of your
[1:40:15] life but a lot of times it's not even
[1:40:16] that we've done something wrong it's
[1:40:18] following the sequence of God's Divine
[1:40:20] elect
[1:40:21] they're the only ones that God can bring
[1:40:23] from this extreme others yes to Baby
[1:40:26] them look at what the Bible says there
[1:40:27] when the people of Israel come out there
[1:40:29] was a more direct way for them to have
[1:40:31] gone to the land of Canaan a much more
[1:40:34] direct way it had been a lot quicker the
[1:40:36] journey the miles would have been
[1:40:37] drastically cut off but the Bible says
[1:40:40] that God would not bring them that way
[1:40:42] because they would become discouraged
[1:40:44] because of War so God LED them the long
[1:40:48] way around but they thought the long way
[1:40:51] around was the wrong way now they didn't
[1:40:53] have GPS of course Global position
[1:40:55] system the way we do but there might
[1:40:57] have been some people that have been
[1:40:58] there before say hey I've been close
[1:40:59] this way before this Moses God's taking
[1:41:01] us 175 miles away out of the way I don't
[1:41:04] understand this do you I don't
[1:41:06] understand this at all don't make a lick
[1:41:07] of sense to me there's a more direct
[1:41:08] route then God said yeah there is one
[1:41:11] but if you go that way you'd be so
[1:41:13] discouraged in three or four days you
[1:41:14] wouldn't want to make no further Journey
[1:41:16] so God said believe me sometimes when I
[1:41:19] take you the long way around it's my
[1:41:21] grace to to you it's my grace to you
[1:41:24] it's my Mercy to you well we ask God to
[1:41:27] heal us and know this oh God you know
[1:41:29] please bring it God said no I think I'll
[1:41:30] go this way and say well Lord how come
[1:41:32] looks like there may have been a whole
[1:41:33] lot easier well when you get to where
[1:41:35] you can be God and look down on the
[1:41:36] earth say maybe he'll he'll help you to
[1:41:38] understand that but until we do until
[1:41:40] you become God I figure we better just
[1:41:43] stay down here on the earth and become
[1:41:45] his children and act what we aren't dumb
[1:41:49] and just say well Lord I'm trusting you
[1:41:52] I don't understand and I finally got to
[1:41:54] a place I didn't want to ask to no more
[1:41:55] I'm just going to believe and I pray God
[1:41:57] give me strengths give me strengths help
[1:42:00] me that I can be faithful help me that I
[1:42:02] can be true help me that I'll stand
[1:42:04] right there at the promise of God
[1:42:06] and the church said
[1:42:09] praise the Lord
[1:42:11] who's that for
[1:42:13] you
[1:42:16] oh
[1:42:19] wow
[1:42:21] thank you Jesus
[1:42:24] I was hoping I hadn't said all that for
[1:42:26] nothing
[1:42:30] now maybe he'll give me my word
[1:42:37] oh Jesus
[1:42:40] thank you for your mercy to his father
[1:42:45] thank you Lord for showing us
[1:42:49] how our journey leads sometimes
[1:42:53] I pray for every person that raised
[1:42:55] their hand
[1:42:56] Lord God they would be able to
[1:42:58] contemplate and think about what was
[1:43:01] said
[1:43:02] maybe you've got them in the
[1:43:05] long road
[1:43:07] and they can see across the river and
[1:43:08] they know if they could go this other
[1:43:10] way be a whole lot quicker
[1:43:12] most of us prefer Miracles over Divine
[1:43:15] Healing most of us prefer Lord that our
[1:43:18] pain has shortened our suffering is
[1:43:20] shortened what we go through is short
[1:43:23] Lord sometimes we know your way is so
[1:43:26] much different than ours
[1:43:28] but Lord God I pray that you would help
[1:43:30] us
[1:43:31] when we feel it we'll praise you when we
[1:43:34] don't feel it we're still going to
[1:43:36] praise you
[1:43:38] when we feel it and we're excited to go
[1:43:41] to church we're going to go
[1:43:43] and when we don't feel like going to
[1:43:46] church and when we're not so excited
[1:43:48] we're still going to come anyhow
[1:43:51] and we're not going to sit down with a
[1:43:52] big long mule looking face because we
[1:43:54] ain't mules
[1:43:55] but we're going to put forth our best
[1:43:58] effort
[1:43:59] we're going to sing we're going to clap
[1:44:00] our hands and worship you and praise you
[1:44:03] because tonight might be the very night
