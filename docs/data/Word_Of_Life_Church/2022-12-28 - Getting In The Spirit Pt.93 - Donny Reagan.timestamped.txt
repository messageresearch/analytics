[41:30] a month now or has it been
[41:32] like it's been forever don't it
[41:35] I love going to church
[41:38] I love going to church some folks love
[41:40] going to a rodeo
[41:42] somebody going to a football game
[41:43] baseball game basketball game
[41:46] Dollywood wherever it is that you like
[41:49] to go but
[41:50] my favorite place is going to church
[41:54] I enjoyed getting together with family
[41:56] and friends and things like that but
[41:59] there's just something about being in
[42:01] God's presence
[42:02] it changes you every time you're there
[42:04] if you'll let it hey man it's so
[42:06] wonderful to be able to to gather you
[42:08] tonight let's turn to the Book of
[42:10] Revelation if you would Chapter 19 Verse
[42:12] verse 19.
[42:15] Revelation 19 19.
[42:23] what an astounding
[42:25] time
[42:26] is laying before this world
[42:29] for us as the people of God it's a
[42:31] tremendous time absolute tremendous time
[42:35] that lays before us
[42:37] what will happen after the departure of
[42:40] the Bride or not so much
[42:43] it's going to be a terrible terrible
[42:45] time
[42:46] I wish you could
[42:48] be able to let everybody know
[42:50] but if we would head out of here tonight
[42:51] scream it to the top of our lungs
[42:54] we probably wouldn't get to the traffic
[42:56] light down in order to where somebody
[42:57] had already called the cops on us and
[43:00] think we were crazy have us picked up if
[43:03] we try to witness to the Jailer to the
[43:05] people in jail they'd think Luke was
[43:07] crazy
[43:08] and it's like we have the truth to be
[43:11] able to tell people
[43:12] that people simply don't want it
[43:14] they want their way they want what they
[43:17] want and what they think is right we're
[43:20] so blessed to desire the truth
[43:24] listen carefully now
[43:26] I saw the beasts and the kings of the
[43:28] earth and their armies gathered together
[43:31] to make war
[43:33] against him that sat on the horse
[43:36] and against his army you're talking
[43:39] about insanity
[43:42] people are going to be so insane
[43:45] they will attack
[43:47] the Lord Jesus
[43:49] and his army
[43:52] and the Beast was taken
[43:54] and with him the false prophet
[43:57] that wrought Miracles before him
[44:00] with which he deceived then
[44:04] that had received the mark of the beast
[44:09] and them that worshiped His image
[44:13] these both were cast alive
[44:17] into a lake of fire
[44:20] burning with a brimstone
[44:23] now remember these are the first beings
[44:26] that the scripture records being cast
[44:30] into this Lake of Fire
[44:33] the Old Testament people and the New
[44:35] Testament people that were lost have
[44:38] went into Hades or Shield of the Old
[44:41] Testament but these go directly
[44:45] into the Lake of Fire
[44:48] and the remnant were slain with the
[44:51] sword
[44:52] of him that set upon the horse
[44:56] which proceedeth
[44:58] out of his mouth
[45:02] and all the fowls were filled
[45:06] with their flesh
[45:08] Lord Jesus
[45:11] let's pray together
[45:13] father thank you for your mercy to us
[45:16] tonight
[45:17] thank you Lord Jesus that you have made
[45:19] a way of Escape
[45:21] that we would not be partakers
[45:24] of these terrible things that are going
[45:27] to happen
[45:28] father God if there's one individual in
[45:30] this place tonight
[45:32] that is not ready to meet you that does
[45:35] not have the token applied to their life
[45:38] we pray for them now Lord
[45:41] if there's one that does not know you as
[45:44] Savior one who's maybe Justified and
[45:48] Sanctified but never received the seal
[45:52] may this be the night that you will make
[45:55] it real to them father may you pass by
[45:58] this way tonight heal the sick encourage
[46:01] those that are down and weary Lord be
[46:04] remember those that are traveling still
[46:07] on the holiday times we pray for your
[46:09] mercy to them flying driving whatever
[46:11] they're doing
[46:12] be merciful to Him Father we ask we
[46:15] commit the service and the word into
[46:18] your care help me to be able to get out
[46:20] of the way to speak the words of Life
[46:22] help the people to be able to receive it
[46:25] for it's in the name of the word we ask
[46:27] amen
[46:29] God bless you you may be seated
[46:38] I don't think that our minds as much as
[46:41] we have the ability to imagine
[46:43] can every ever be able to comprehend
[46:48] what a terrible time that lays before
[46:51] the people at the end not only during
[46:54] the tribulation but at the end of the
[46:56] tribulation which is where this setting
[46:58] is
[46:59] they will be so under the wrath of God
[47:03] they will be so under the domain of the
[47:07] Beast and of the false prophet
[47:10] they will so be under the plagues the
[47:14] prophets of Revelation 11 will be given
[47:17] Authority power to control the elements
[47:21] to be able to stop winds bring all kinds
[47:25] of things upon the human race
[47:27] and yet at the end of it instead of
[47:30] people being of a repentant heart and a
[47:33] repentant attitude and saying God we're
[47:36] so sorry what what have we done to you
[47:39] instead of them having that mindset they
[47:42] were going to be so angry and so upset
[47:46] at God they will see the Lord Jesus
[47:48] coming out of Heaven on a white horse
[47:51] and the armies of heaven with him and
[47:55] they will have such rage and such anger
[47:58] that they will go out to meet him the
[48:02] King of Kings you've got to be kidding
[48:05] these people are absolutely out of their
[48:07] minds they're going to attack the Lord
[48:10] Jesus they're going to attack the saints
[48:13] of God in glorified bodies what would
[48:16] make them do such a thing well the key
[48:20] is where they are and who they are you
[48:23] see the Bible tells us here that they
[48:25] have received the mark of the beast
[48:29] they've been deceived by miraculous
[48:32] power of the false prophet so they will
[48:36] have been so duped by this religious
[48:39] thing they would have received the mark
[48:41] of the beast and they will their soul
[48:44] will then be turned over to a reprobate
[48:46] state so you know they've got in their
[48:48] mind they know they know they'll be able
[48:51] to win they believe in their mind
[48:53] they'll be able to win a battle against
[48:56] the Lord Jesus now you know demons are
[48:59] so they're so deceptive they they
[49:02] themselves believe in one God they know
[49:06] their Destiny they don't even question
[49:10] God about words are going they don't
[49:14] even accuse God of their judgment and
[49:18] their Destiny they know that he's a
[49:22] savior but not theirs
[49:25] and they are so determined but yet still
[49:29] they are able to anoint people to accuse
[49:33] God their Oneness all demons believe in
[49:36] one God but yet they convince many that
[49:39] there's three
[49:41] and when it comes to their own
[49:43] personalities and the way that they view
[49:46] God it's such a strange thing to me so
[49:50] here we come now to when the ages are
[49:53] now going to end it's the end of man's
[49:55] day and it is the day the dawning of the
[49:59] day of the Lord and the tendency of
[50:02] liberal interpreters that will take the
[50:06] scriptures of God and the traits and the
[50:09] attributes of God's love Mercy salvation
[50:12] goodness forgiveness and all of that and
[50:15] them same interpreters don't want to
[50:18] look at the scripture that talks about
[50:19] God's judgment and God's rest but let me
[50:23] just tell you tonight those scriptures
[50:25] are just as real and just as profound as
[50:29] those that describe his grace
[50:32] is that right those that all they're so
[50:35] caught up on the love of God and the
[50:37] mercy of God but you don't hear them
[50:39] talking too much about the wraths of God
[50:42] and the Judgment of God it's just as
[50:44] real
[50:45] and it will happen just as much now you
[50:49] know the word to a real True Believer
[50:51] the word is not lopsided and it's not
[50:55] warped but it takes a real understanding
[50:58] to be able to view God in this right
[51:01] perspective now let's move over from
[51:03] chapter 19 to chapter 20. now notice
[51:06] what happens at the end of this battle
[51:09] this is the battle of Armageddon it's
[51:12] going to be held in the valley of
[51:14] Jezreel that is called or the valley of
[51:17] megetto or the valley of Jehoshaphat
[51:19] very same place given different names in
[51:23] the context so after the Lord Jesus
[51:26] comes out of heaven and then the sword
[51:28] proceeds out of his mouth no doubt a lot
[51:32] of these people will be killed by Atomic
[51:34] Warfare but there will be many of them
[51:36] that will be reserved to be annihilated
[51:39] by the sword that proceeds out of his
[51:42] mouth some of them their bodies will be
[51:45] disintegrated this it will fulfill the
[51:49] scripture in Malachi 4 that the
[51:51] righteous will walk out on the ashes of
[51:55] the wicked notice how God differentiates
[51:57] the deaths and the Judgment of the
[51:59] wicked that some of them will be eaten
[52:02] by vultures some of them will be tore
[52:06] apart by vultures and will be eat by
[52:09] these birds and it's called the Great
[52:11] supper of God and yet others of them
[52:14] will be annihilated and be nothing but
[52:17] Atomic fodder now who's to determine
[52:20] that God himself will we will step out
[52:23] on the ashes of some and on the bones of
[52:27] others because there they will lay and
[52:30] their bodies will be ripped to shreds by
[52:33] these vultures that have come to eat
[52:35] them you say that's awful well they're
[52:37] only getting back what they deserve you
[52:40] see people who turn down the mercy of
[52:42] God they make their own religion and
[52:45] they rewrite God who God is and what God
[52:48] is this is what God's going to give them
[52:50] and pay back I personally don't want
[52:52] none of that myself
[52:54] I don't care what he asked for me to do
[52:56] I want to do it
[52:58] right don't you now watch when it comes
[53:02] to where the beasts and the false
[53:04] prophet which are two separate
[53:06] individuals they will be cast alive into
[53:10] this Lake of Fire which burns with fire
[53:13] and brimstone notice now in Revelation
[53:16] chapter 20 verse 1 and I saw an angel
[53:20] come down from heaven having the key of
[53:24] the bottomless pit and a great chain in
[53:27] his hand now notice how many angels that
[53:32] it takes to throw the devil into the
[53:37] abyss I want you to notice that John
[53:39] does not see a whole Legion which is
[53:43] from two to six thousand he does not see
[53:48] a whole band he does not see an army as
[53:52] a matter of fact he does not even see a
[53:55] cherubim a Zune he does not see an art
[53:58] Archangel he does not even see a noted
[54:02] Angel he sees an angel apparently of
[54:07] minor rank but this Angel is all it
[54:11] takes to grab those through for it and
[54:15] throw him down in the pit
[54:17] Hallelujah notice so I saw an angel now
[54:21] notice John differentiates in the Book
[54:23] of Revelation in the categories and
[54:26] degrees of angels that he would cause
[54:28] them a mighty angel or a great angel or
[54:32] a shining Angel but this one is just an
[54:35] angel so just let you know that no
[54:38] matter what you're going through God
[54:40] don't have to be able to dispense a
[54:42] legion it doesn't take a mighty Angel it
[54:45] doesn't take a great Angel all God has
[54:47] to do is in just one of his ordinary
[54:49] Angels your way and it's way more than
[54:52] what you need
[54:53] Hallelujah now notice this Angel has a
[54:58] key to a certain place and it was a key
[55:02] to the bottomless pit now let's look at
[55:06] this bottomless pit a little bit and
[55:08] let's look at the realm of demons I know
[55:11] it's a world that we know very little
[55:13] about but let's just peer into it for
[55:16] just a little bit from the scripture now
[55:18] before I do I want to let you know
[55:20] something about demons and the Devil
[55:22] Himself and I'm not sure you're aware of
[55:24] but Satan actually has fear that may be
[55:29] something that would seem unusual but
[55:32] demons actually experience fear and
[55:36] Satan experiences fear you can find the
[55:40] prophet saying this in the church age
[55:42] book about the devil that whenever
[55:44] people would come up before him and the
[55:46] spirit of God would start Discerning
[55:48] them and that devil would pick up that
[55:51] he's fixing to be exposed and he's said
[55:54] he would watch the countenance of those
[55:56] people's face as it was changed because
[55:59] Satan hated and was afraid to be exposed
[56:04] now he knows that his end is coming I
[56:07] can't say that I understand him because
[56:11] he can read right here in the Bible and
[56:13] he believes that his end is coming now
[56:17] if you notice system or not but you will
[56:18] but time are done tonight these demons
[56:21] actually know their days are numbered
[56:24] they know the Lord Jesus is going to
[56:28] torment them they know that they're
[56:31] going to this place of the Abyss or the
[56:35] Deep or the pit and they know it is just
[56:40] huh and they're scared to death
[56:43] so what I love to hear is when the
[56:48] tormentors are afraid of Torment
[56:52] amen I read something uh this this year
[56:56] early in the spring about stink bugs
[56:59] y'all know what stink bugs are uh we've
[57:01] got two or three different kinds here in
[57:02] East Tennessee and there's one
[57:04] predominant one which is a brown got a
[57:06] little Touch of Gray on the back of it
[57:07] and the females are mainly the ones that
[57:09] stinks are bad but I was trying to
[57:11] figure out how to get rid of because it
[57:13] got a screened in porch so I've got some
[57:14] up there and they love that place so I
[57:17] was trying to figure out how to do it
[57:18] and what you do well you know you can do
[57:20] this and do this and this and what I
[57:22] thought was so amazing about stink bugs
[57:25] is this they cannot stand stinky smells
[57:31] that's all that's the Bible reminds me
[57:34] of a pole cap that can't stand you know
[57:36] can't stand strong smell but a stink bug
[57:39] cannot stand strong smells it just
[57:42] bothers them and they will not stick
[57:44] around so what I found was that you can
[57:47] take either camphor or you can take some
[57:50] strong oils essential typoles put them
[57:53] in a container with water and put just a
[57:55] few drops inside of there and then pump
[57:57] that dude up and whenever you see them
[57:59] on the Rascals all you got to do is just
[58:01] spray around where they are and then oh
[58:03] I can't stand this I gotta get out of
[58:05] here they can't stand it but yet they
[58:07] themselves are nothing but stink bugs
[58:11] but they don't like stinks or long
[58:14] strong smells and that's what I think
[58:16] about the devil that Devils love to
[58:18] bring fear they love to cause torment
[58:22] but they themselves are so afraid of
[58:25] being exposed they are so afraid of the
[58:29] spirit of God and hang with me now they
[58:32] are scared to death of a man woman boy
[58:35] or girl that knows their position in
[58:38] Christ Jesus and when you get on your
[58:41] knees to pray and you begin to call on
[58:44] the name of the Lord them Devils begin
[58:46] to tremble not because of you and your
[58:50] Humanity but because you in your deity
[58:53] Hallelujah you cannot be destroyed
[58:59] Oh Glory to God
[59:01] now once this instance in Matthew
[59:04] chapter 8 verse 28 and when he was come
[59:07] to the other side into the country of
[59:10] the gagena scenes they met him to
[59:13] possessed with Devils coming out of the
[59:15] tombs exceeding Fierce so that no man
[59:19] might pass by that way and behold they
[59:22] cried out saying what have we to do with
[59:25] thee Jesus
[59:28] thou Son of God
[59:33] how did they know
[59:35] who he was
[59:38] what do we have to do with thee Jesus
[59:41] thou Son of God
[59:43] Art Thou come hither
[59:46] to torment us
[59:49] before the time
[59:54] is this the time
[59:57] is this the time when we're going to the
[1:00:01] pit
[1:00:02] to the abyss
[1:00:04] have you come to torment us before the
[1:00:07] time or is this the time now let me just
[1:00:10] let you in on something that apparently
[1:00:12] the demons that are under Satan's
[1:00:16] control did not know and recognize in
[1:00:20] the promise of God that there were two
[1:00:22] comings of the Messiah
[1:00:26] so when they see him and they see by of
[1:00:29] course by this time in the scripture
[1:00:31] Jesus says already been casting out
[1:00:34] devils and doing Mighty Wonder Works and
[1:00:36] things like that so they knew there was
[1:00:39] something different about him and now
[1:00:40] they are wondering is this our time to
[1:00:44] go into the pit so they were scared they
[1:00:48] were afraid because they're going into
[1:00:51] the pit now now they are not in this
[1:00:55] place so wherever they are remember II
[1:00:58] Peter talks about it how that they were
[1:01:00] kept and they were in a prison life but
[1:01:03] in that prison they can come and go they
[1:01:06] can be able to do this and that but once
[1:01:09] they get assigned into this pit or the
[1:01:12] Deep or the abyss it's like they know
[1:01:15] they can never come out so now they are
[1:01:18] afraid their Destiny has arrived and
[1:01:22] they are scared to death and I say
[1:01:24] hahaha
[1:01:26] now what have we Jesus our son of God
[1:01:29] Art Thou come hither to torment us
[1:01:32] before the time now won't you listen to
[1:01:35] this this strange faith
[1:01:38] now listen this strange faith that they
[1:01:42] have so they they know they believe that
[1:01:46] he is the Son of God and they also
[1:01:49] believe he has the authority to send
[1:01:53] them to their Destiny they believe he
[1:01:56] has the power to speak and they would be
[1:02:00] forced to leave now can you imagine
[1:02:02] we're talking about demons but look at
[1:02:05] their face look how strongly they
[1:02:08] believed who he was that if if demons
[1:02:12] could believe that that what about us as
[1:02:15] children of God if they could believe
[1:02:17] that can you imagine believing that he
[1:02:21] is a savior but also knowing he's not
[1:02:24] your savior
[1:02:27] What A peculiar face that they had you
[1:02:30] say of Faith yes they believed they
[1:02:34] believed and it was a sort of faith that
[1:02:38] they believed he could speak he could
[1:02:40] determine their Destiny he would send
[1:02:42] them to their Destiny but yet at the
[1:02:45] same time they also knew it was not for
[1:02:47] them now I find this so amazing because
[1:02:49] they fight like they are the winners and
[1:02:53] we act like we're the losers and they
[1:02:56] can look in the back of the book and
[1:02:57] they already knew their Destiny was
[1:02:59] predetermined and somehow they knew they
[1:03:02] were going to wind up in the abyss or
[1:03:04] the pit now remember the New Testament
[1:03:06] was not even written whenever they said
[1:03:08] this but they are quoting New Testament
[1:03:10] terms and it's not even wrote down in
[1:03:13] the New Testament yet and they are
[1:03:15] confessing the Lord Jesus will send them
[1:03:19] to their Destiny isn't it amazing Devils
[1:03:21] knew who he were and preacher said he
[1:03:24] was a false prophet the church crucified
[1:03:27] him and Devils testifying who he was
[1:03:29] well that's about the way it goes isn't
[1:03:31] it
[1:03:33] now notice to be able to believe he's a
[1:03:36] savior but not yours so what did they
[1:03:39] ask him Art Thou come hither to torment
[1:03:43] us before the time so this displaced to
[1:03:47] us the apprehension of the demons that
[1:03:50] live in that world that no what did they
[1:03:53] know about him what did they see what
[1:03:55] did they recognize that the rest of the
[1:03:57] world could not see there was something
[1:03:59] about him that must have been
[1:04:00] Supernatural and phenomenal that they
[1:04:03] would recognize that so the question it
[1:04:06] comes back how was they able to see it
[1:04:08] and yet they did not question him now
[1:04:11] you ain't got the right you ain't got no
[1:04:13] Authority you can't do this or that they
[1:04:15] never even question their Destiny they
[1:04:19] never even said we should not go to hell
[1:04:21] we should never have to go there no no
[1:04:24] no you made a mistake they don't even
[1:04:26] question it at all their question is is
[1:04:30] the time arrived we know we're going and
[1:04:33] we're getting what we deserve but the
[1:04:35] only question we've got is that now or
[1:04:37] not we don't know we're not sure
[1:04:40] if demons could have that kind of faiths
[1:04:42] and where they're going
[1:04:44] what are we to have brother Larry if
[1:04:47] demons can look at that and say well I
[1:04:50] know where I'm going I'm a devil I know
[1:04:53] where I'm going and I'm getting exactly
[1:04:55] what I deserve is this the time of not
[1:04:57] and we get up and down and in and out
[1:05:00] well I'm not sure if I'm saved or not
[1:05:02] well if the Rapture was to go I'm not
[1:05:04] sure if I'm going if a devil can know
[1:05:06] her he's going how much more should a
[1:05:08] son or daughter of God filled with the
[1:05:10] Holy Ghost have confidence in God I know
[1:05:13] where I'm going I pass from Death unto
[1:05:16] life I'm not what I was I'm a different
[1:05:19] person the old man has died I am a new
[1:05:23] creature in Christ Jesus
[1:05:26] it ain't just mother Donnie's savior
[1:05:28] he's mine he ain't just mother random
[1:05:31] savior He's Mine He's my God he's my
[1:05:34] redeemer he's my king
[1:05:37] oh my
[1:05:40] God so they don't question his authority
[1:05:43] they don't question his determinant
[1:05:46] ability to assign them to what they
[1:05:49] deserve they don't question any of that
[1:05:51] their main question is has it arrived
[1:05:54] it's a time for us to go into the abyss
[1:05:58] and never get out again
[1:06:01] oh my goodness
[1:06:03] so they don't say one thing against it
[1:06:07] now maybe some of you have never been
[1:06:09] called to cast out devils
[1:06:13] maybe some of you have seen it happen
[1:06:15] before I'm sure you have
[1:06:17] but I've seen it many times even before
[1:06:19] I come to the message
[1:06:21] and whenever you deal with a
[1:06:23] demon-possessed person and you've got a
[1:06:25] person that's trying to make them leave
[1:06:29] and you'll watch the reaction of that
[1:06:32] demon inside that individual
[1:06:35] and that demon will try to Bluff
[1:06:39] that preacher or that individual that's
[1:06:41] trying to cast him out
[1:06:43] and if he catches the least little bit
[1:06:46] of question in the heart of that
[1:06:49] individual that's trying to make him
[1:06:50] leave you watch him Bluff and you can
[1:06:53] watch that devil and I did say him
[1:06:55] because they are him
[1:06:57] and you'll watch them I don't have to
[1:06:59] come out I don't have to come out you
[1:07:02] can't make me come out all Vibes cast
[1:07:05] someone out several years ago and that
[1:07:08] demon spoke out of a woman
[1:07:10] in a man's voice and said I was the one
[1:07:15] in the Garden of Eden I was the one who
[1:07:19] come against Eve began to talk and say
[1:07:22] these things over and over and I forbid
[1:07:25] him to preach to me
[1:07:28] I said hold your peace
[1:07:31] I knew the Book of Genesis I didn't want
[1:07:33] to hear his account of it
[1:07:36] well praise the Lord now you see he is a
[1:07:40] bluff so he will try to Bluff you now
[1:07:43] I've seen him many times so well then
[1:07:44] then if that thing goes to try to
[1:07:46] bucking against the preacher that's
[1:07:48] casting him out then he will get that
[1:07:50] edge and the preacher of Satan can pick
[1:07:52] it up you know just like a dog if you
[1:07:55] are scared of a dog and you go in a yard
[1:07:58] that dog may not bother nobody else but
[1:08:01] your body produces a an element of fear
[1:08:04] and it will produce a sense that that
[1:08:07] dog can pick it up and its smell your
[1:08:09] body produces that and that dog about
[1:08:12] you nine times out of ten my advice is
[1:08:14] for you to run like you never run in
[1:08:16] your life
[1:08:17] but somebody else can go to the same
[1:08:20] doll and say shut your mouth and lay
[1:08:22] down I'm going to tell you limb from
[1:08:24] limb and you watch that dog's tail and
[1:08:27] you know where it goes right between its
[1:08:29] legs and it'll back down and look at you
[1:08:31] like that why because your body is not
[1:08:34] putting that out and he can sense and I
[1:08:36] better keep my bark to myself this old
[1:08:38] boy's got a pretty good about himself so
[1:08:41] devils are the same way now they are the
[1:08:44] king of bluffers and that's why no
[1:08:47] matter whether your demon possess or
[1:08:49] where Satan's just trying to fight you
[1:08:51] in your mind all of you oh you say well
[1:08:53] I'm not possession of course you don't
[1:08:54] have to be but he'll still try to Bluff
[1:08:57] you on being saved being bride being
[1:08:59] filled with the Holy Ghost God's going
[1:09:01] to heal you God's going to move for you
[1:09:03] well you've been praying and God ain't
[1:09:05] done it he's trying to Bluff you away
[1:09:06] from your promise he's trying to Bluff
[1:09:09] you away from your healing but you need
[1:09:11] to stand right there and say shut up
[1:09:13] devil get back to hell and leave me
[1:09:15] alone I believe God word I'm God's son
[1:09:19] I'm God's daughter get out of my way I
[1:09:23] am healed I am delivered
[1:09:28] now what so they quote this about before
[1:09:32] the time now they know that there is a
[1:09:35] certain time that's been set aside for
[1:09:39] them to be judged now we know of course
[1:09:42] that in the last days when the Great
[1:09:44] White Throne judgment is set and Satan
[1:09:47] will be judged and all of those demons
[1:09:50] which were angels in the presence of God
[1:09:53] each one of them will be given their own
[1:09:56] judgment oh my goodness what a time
[1:09:58] that's going to be
[1:09:59] now the demons not recognizing the
[1:10:03] Messianic coming was going to be divided
[1:10:05] Isaiah 61 into two advents so they no
[1:10:09] doubt they were kind of confused by the
[1:10:11] joy and trying to understand now wait a
[1:10:13] minute the son of David things Psalms 2
[1:10:15] Zechariah 7 Zechariah 14. what about all
[1:10:19] that what about a Micah 4 2 aren't those
[1:10:21] things going to come about so they were
[1:10:23] looking at it but here was an advent
[1:10:25] that they didn't understand you see it
[1:10:27] was that coming of the Messiah that
[1:10:30] confused the the Jews and the great
[1:10:32] teachers and they was looking for the
[1:10:35] son of David but instead he come as son
[1:10:37] of man Prophet right and then he come
[1:10:41] back on the day of Pentecost as the Son
[1:10:43] of God and the next coming we know of
[1:10:45] course was to be a son of man according
[1:10:47] to Luke 17 30. in the last days and then
[1:10:50] this coming is what the son of David to
[1:10:53] set upon the throne so these demons were
[1:10:56] kind of confused about the time they
[1:10:58] said well there's the time right are we
[1:11:01] going to the pit so notice this in Mark
[1:11:04] chapter 5 verse 1. and they came over
[1:11:07] into the other side of the sea and to
[1:11:09] the country of the Gatherings and when
[1:11:12] he was come out of the ship immediately
[1:11:13] they met him out of the tombs a man was
[1:11:17] an unclean spirit
[1:11:19] who had his dwelling among the tombs and
[1:11:23] no man could bind him no not with chains
[1:11:26] but and because they had often bound him
[1:11:29] with Fetters and chains I listened to
[1:11:31] strength that this demon would give to
[1:11:34] this man and the chains had been plucked
[1:11:37] asunder by him and the Fetters broken in
[1:11:41] pieces neither could any man tame him
[1:11:45] now notice the word tame like you would
[1:11:48] try to tame an animal
[1:11:51] what a degenerate State a
[1:11:54] demon-possessed person can get into it
[1:11:56] and they have Supernatural power you've
[1:11:59] seen them before of course they can have
[1:12:01] Supernatural Powers just phenomenal some
[1:12:03] of the things that I've seen before and
[1:12:05] watched when people get under that
[1:12:06] influence you just think it's almost
[1:12:08] it's almost impossible for it to happen
[1:12:10] but these demons when they fell from
[1:12:13] their original estate they still kept
[1:12:15] that delegated authority given to them
[1:12:17] by God so that's why they can appear
[1:12:19] disappear angels of life and all of that
[1:12:22] now watch and always night and day he
[1:12:25] was in the mountains and in the tombs
[1:12:27] crying
[1:12:30] oh
[1:12:32] and cutting
[1:12:34] himself
[1:12:38] you see there is a move
[1:12:42] and has been around for a long time
[1:12:46] where some of our young people
[1:12:50] will cut themselves
[1:12:55] well you see this is not a Godly example
[1:13:00] this is not an example of someone with
[1:13:02] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:04] trying to do this so what influence is
[1:13:06] it from the Devil
[1:13:09] you remember the false prophets upon the
[1:13:11] mountain when they begin to call upon
[1:13:13] their gods and what did they do cut
[1:13:15] themselves
[1:13:18] so it's demonic
[1:13:20] I'm not saying a person who doesn't now
[1:13:22] is full of the devil but the devil is
[1:13:24] certainly anointing them
[1:13:25] now notice this man so he was in the
[1:13:28] tombs what a place to live in a
[1:13:30] graveyard so he was in the tombs and and
[1:13:34] but his his emotions was a mixture of
[1:13:38] power Anointed with demonic influence
[1:13:41] and yet human weakness at the same time
[1:13:44] because the man would displace such
[1:13:47] power that that runner for a close by
[1:13:49] the friend that chain him and put
[1:13:51] Fetters and bonds on him and they'd be
[1:13:53] able to tackle him down and maybe waddle
[1:13:55] him down like a wild animal and just in
[1:13:57] a few minutes he'd be like like Samson
[1:13:59] was he just popped them chains off of
[1:14:01] him and the Fetters and then you would
[1:14:04] carry maybe growling like some sort of
[1:14:06] animal and then he'd weep
[1:14:09] and mourn and cry
[1:14:13] the anointing of the devil would move on
[1:14:16] him and then whenever he would do these
[1:14:19] things it would retract and he would
[1:14:21] kind of come to himself and he was a
[1:14:24] miserable creature oh Lord
[1:14:26] God
[1:14:28] notice this and when Jesus when he saw
[1:14:32] Jesus author off he ran
[1:14:36] and worshiped him
[1:14:42] a demon-possessed man
[1:14:46] and cried with a loud voice and said
[1:14:49] what have I to do with thee
[1:14:53] Jesus
[1:14:55] thou son of the most high God
[1:14:59] first time in the New Testament these
[1:15:02] terms are used most high God
[1:15:06] this is the name he appeared to Abraham
[1:15:09] in elyon
[1:15:12] most high God
[1:15:16] and yes your demons are quoting this
[1:15:20] name of God
[1:15:23] what's his authority now what he says I
[1:15:27] a Jersey
[1:15:29] wow
[1:15:32] so this demon has enough boldness
[1:15:37] to say to the Lord Jesus I assure you
[1:15:44] I challenge you
[1:15:47] I demand an answer of you
[1:15:51] ah you're talking to the wrong one buddy
[1:15:57] I adjure Thee by God
[1:16:05] that thou
[1:16:07] torment
[1:16:09] me not
[1:16:11] ah
[1:16:13] now we see it
[1:16:15] the word torment means pain
[1:16:19] vex
[1:16:21] to question by applying torture
[1:16:26] to be harassed
[1:16:30] that's what I love to do to devils
[1:16:34] I love to apply torture
[1:16:37] by questioning how much longer you think
[1:16:40] you got devil Before You cast into the
[1:16:42] pit how much longer you think you got
[1:16:45] before God's Gonna heal me of this
[1:16:47] Affliction or whatever it is I'm dealing
[1:16:49] with I love to apply pressure you see
[1:16:51] friend we're living so far beneath our
[1:16:53] privilege because we somehow we tend to
[1:16:57] think that the devil is the only one
[1:16:59] that has the right to question and he
[1:17:02] always questions us well what about your
[1:17:05] failure and what about this and what
[1:17:07] about that and then if he goes with that
[1:17:09] then he'll say well how come God ain't
[1:17:11] healed you how come God ain't done that
[1:17:13] how can God you need to understand your
[1:17:15] rights that you've also got a right to
[1:17:18] question him
[1:17:19] well I wonder how much longer devil you
[1:17:22] got before Jesus is going to cast you
[1:17:24] down into the pit I wonder how many more
[1:17:26] days you're going to bother me with that
[1:17:28] headache or that back ache before I'm
[1:17:30] going to come shouting out of that bed
[1:17:32] talking about the power of God I wonder
[1:17:35] how much our devil oh you said that Old
[1:17:37] Devil hangs around me all the time well
[1:17:39] apparently you make it pretty
[1:17:40] comfortable for him so if you go to
[1:17:43] question in him at applying the pressure
[1:17:45] on him you might find out you got a
[1:17:48] little bit more peace and quiet
[1:17:55] oh my
[1:17:57] God he cried with a loud voice what have
[1:18:01] I to do with thee
[1:18:03] Jesus thou son of the most high God I
[1:18:07] maturity
[1:18:09] by God
[1:18:12] torment me not
[1:18:16] to question by applying torture
[1:18:20] to be harassed or distressed
[1:18:24] of those who are at Sea that are
[1:18:28] struggling with the headwind
[1:18:31] so you're at Sea and you're Roar you're
[1:18:35] roaring and you're pulling the oars and
[1:18:37] man you're roaring I'm telling you
[1:18:39] you're doing everything you know to do
[1:18:40] and there's a great big strong headwind
[1:18:43] any of you have ever flown on an
[1:18:44] airplane and you know what that is right
[1:18:46] ahead when and her tailwind and if
[1:18:48] you're meeting a headwind I've flown in
[1:18:50] them before overseas over the Pacific
[1:18:51] and over the Atlantic Ocean that 150 200
[1:18:54] miles an hour headwind so that means
[1:18:57] that the headwind is flying and moving
[1:18:59] at 200 miles an hour and you're flying
[1:19:01] into it at 550 miles an hour and then
[1:19:04] the pilot will tell you because of this
[1:19:07] strong headwind it's going to take us
[1:19:09] longer to get there it's going to take
[1:19:11] us another 45 minutes or another hour
[1:19:13] but the the good part about it is I've
[1:19:16] also had the parties to come on and say
[1:19:18] ladies and gentlemen we have a strong
[1:19:20] 120 mile an air tailwind and because of
[1:19:23] that Tailwind we're going to arrive
[1:19:25] sooner than we thought because that tail
[1:19:28] man instead of pushing against you it's
[1:19:30] pushing for you Oh Glory to God I
[1:19:34] believe friends I am totally convinced
[1:19:36] that you and I fight a lot of headwind
[1:19:38] when we ought to be riding on the
[1:19:40] tailwind and it's because we let the
[1:19:43] devil tell us you've got to do this and
[1:19:45] you've got to do that you need to start
[1:19:47] questioning that's all y'all said and
[1:19:49] said how long does it be for you're
[1:19:51] going to be thrown in the pit oh boy how
[1:19:53] long is it going to be before the Lord
[1:19:55] God delivers me how long is it going to
[1:19:58] be before you're cast into the deep
[1:20:02] [Applause]
[1:20:09] so the next time he wants to have a
[1:20:11] conversation with you but keep having
[1:20:12] one of them cheers our brother
[1:20:17] foreign
[1:20:21] did you well sit down I'm going to
[1:20:24] harass you
[1:20:27] I found out last night I'm a Holy Ghost
[1:20:29] Field son or daughter of God
[1:20:32] I put up as your mouse I put up in your
[1:20:34] lip I've done realize I've done
[1:20:37] listening to a bunch of junk and a bunch
[1:20:39] of lies and a bunch of garbage that I do
[1:20:42] not have to put up with so if you're
[1:20:44] gonna stay in here today sit down and
[1:20:47] shut up because I've got a bunch of
[1:20:50] questions for you
[1:20:51] [Applause]
[1:20:57] as the time arrived I don't know the day
[1:21:00] I don't know the eye but I want to tell
[1:21:03] you your days are numbered you're gonna
[1:21:05] be thrown in the pit you're gonna be
[1:21:07] annihilated you're going to be destroyed
[1:21:10] so a devil I just like to shout around
[1:21:13] you a little bit and just tell you
[1:21:15] you're gonna be cast into the Lake of
[1:21:18] Fire
[1:21:20] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:22] [Applause]
[1:21:31] so I think I'll leave him there and
[1:21:33] preach to him a little bit
[1:21:39] so the Tormentor
[1:21:41] anticipating and dreading torment
[1:21:52] and entreating for exemption
[1:21:56] I surely thee by God
[1:21:58] boy and animation how religious he can
[1:22:00] be
[1:22:02] my
[1:22:05] Otis in Luke chapter 8 verse 20 29.
[1:22:09] he commanded the unclean Spirit to come
[1:22:12] out of the man for often times it called
[1:22:14] him
[1:22:15] and he was kept down with chains
[1:22:18] and in Fetters did he break the bands
[1:22:20] and was driven of the devil Into the
[1:22:22] Wilderness
[1:22:23] and Jesus asked him saying what is thy
[1:22:27] name
[1:22:28] question time
[1:22:30] and he said Legion
[1:22:34] because many devils
[1:22:37] were entered into him
[1:22:40] now the prophet tells us in the little
[1:22:41] sermon prodigal son 19-15 that this guy
[1:22:45] was a good guy married man had kids had
[1:22:49] a family
[1:22:50] but he started with one little thing
[1:22:52] might have been drinking might have been
[1:22:54] lying and then one devil entered and
[1:22:56] another and another and another let me
[1:22:59] tell you something friend I don't care
[1:23:00] who you are how old you are ain't none
[1:23:02] of us can outsmart the devil
[1:23:04] oh you're playing with this sin and that
[1:23:06] same time well I'm good I'm good no
[1:23:08] you're not good they none of us good
[1:23:10] enough and powerful enough to be able to
[1:23:12] withstand this demonic Force especially
[1:23:14] in this last day
[1:23:16] and they noticed they
[1:23:20] they
[1:23:22] now if you notice whenever this comes
[1:23:24] about and Jesus asks what is your name
[1:23:28] and one person answers
[1:23:32] one person answers
[1:23:35] but look how it changes in verse 31. and
[1:23:39] they
[1:23:40] besought him
[1:23:42] that he would not command them
[1:23:45] to go out
[1:23:47] into the deep
[1:23:52] now they're getting scared
[1:23:56] so he said what's your name or my name
[1:23:59] is Legion one spokesman
[1:24:02] and then they all go to get nervous you
[1:24:05] know it's so lots of prophet whenever he
[1:24:07] would under discernment somebody would
[1:24:09] come up in a prayer line they might have
[1:24:10] cancer whatever more
[1:24:12] and he would stand there for a minute
[1:24:14] and get silencing hear it on the tape
[1:24:15] and he would say that person sitting
[1:24:17] right back there you've got the same
[1:24:19] thing and this person over yours got the
[1:24:21] same thing because I can see a dark
[1:24:23] streak going from this one to that one
[1:24:26] now what were they doing they were
[1:24:28] communicating in the fourth dimension
[1:24:31] can't you hear him he said can't you
[1:24:33] hear them this one is crying for help
[1:24:38] and he would all say also say I hear him
[1:24:41] begging for mercy oh my begging for
[1:24:46] mercy Devils begging for mercy or you
[1:24:49] say boy I'll tell you brother what am I
[1:24:51] awesome to bend that Prophet no doubt it
[1:24:53] would have been but let me just bring it
[1:24:54] on down to you in your day when the
[1:24:57] weakest Christian gets down on their
[1:24:59] knees to pray it makes hell turn me you
[1:25:01] imagine a son or daughter of God that
[1:25:03] knows who they are and they go to
[1:25:05] praying for that Wayward boy that
[1:25:07] Wayward girl that Wayward husband or
[1:25:09] wife and they go to believe in God no
[1:25:11] matter what they feel no matter if they
[1:25:13] speak in tongues or not they believe
[1:25:15] God's word in them Devils out of hell go
[1:25:18] to shaken and trembling why because the
[1:25:20] saint of God has more Authority on the
[1:25:23] earth that an archangel in heaven that's
[1:25:25] a quote a child of God down on their
[1:25:29] knees oh Hallelujah believe in the Lord
[1:25:32] is going to set him free and them Devils
[1:25:34] get all tore up
[1:25:37] hmm
[1:25:41] and they basalt begged
[1:25:45] pleaded
[1:25:51] that he would not command
[1:25:57] they recognized his authority
[1:26:04] that he would not command them to go out
[1:26:07] into the deep now this is the same exact
[1:26:12] same word that's used in The Book of
[1:26:14] Revelation
[1:26:15] for the bottomless pit
[1:26:18] the Greek word is abusos
[1:26:21] which means bottomless pit on fathomed
[1:26:26] boundless
[1:26:28] Abyss
[1:26:31] so the demons believe in God
[1:26:35] and they tremble
[1:26:37] they believe they will get a just
[1:26:40] judgment
[1:26:42] and it makes them afraid
[1:26:46] they believe and know they are Beyond
[1:26:48] Redemption
[1:26:51] how can you say that brother Donnie
[1:26:53] because there's no Redemption for an
[1:26:56] angel once it crosses the line
[1:26:59] Once An Angel ever sells out his
[1:27:02] allegiance to Satan and turns against
[1:27:05] the kingdom of God there is no
[1:27:08] Redemption
[1:27:09] Jesus never died for Angels
[1:27:13] he died for sinners
[1:27:16] then God blessed you our friends
[1:27:19] so they know this about God's character
[1:27:23] and they know their Destiny is already
[1:27:26] determined and yet they fight him they
[1:27:29] fight his kingdom they fight his economy
[1:27:32] they fight his people as if though
[1:27:35] somehow they can still win
[1:27:38] but they know they know me on the side
[1:27:41] of the dove he has power ultimate power
[1:27:44] to assign them to their Destiny say why
[1:27:47] you keep saying that if they can believe
[1:27:50] that and their Devils cannot we believe
[1:27:52] the other way we are children of God I
[1:27:56] ask you now well why are you going I ask
[1:28:00] you devil can you get back you can't
[1:28:02] tell the truth can you but I'll tell the
[1:28:04] truth for you you're going to the pit
[1:28:06] you're beyond Redemption you cannot get
[1:28:10] back but guess what I got back
[1:28:13] these people gone by was not going to
[1:28:17] the pen the pit was where I was taken
[1:28:20] from but I'm going back to this head I'm
[1:28:23] going to Paradise
[1:28:24] [Applause]
[1:28:38] they admit
[1:28:40] they have to obey his voice
[1:28:47] I don't want to tell anyone I'm praying
[1:28:50] for our Saints
[1:28:53] whether it's
[1:28:55] folks that are part of our immediate
[1:28:57] church family
[1:28:59] or people on the phone or people around
[1:29:02] the world or whoever it is that I pray
[1:29:04] for them for the sick and this and that
[1:29:05] you know uh
[1:29:08] I'll wait
[1:29:10] I know how Patiently I wish sometimes
[1:29:13] for that unction
[1:29:15] from the Holy One
[1:29:17] to where it is more
[1:29:19] than my words
[1:29:22] and it is more than my voice
[1:29:26] you understand what I'm saying when the
[1:29:27] spirit of God will cry out of you and
[1:29:30] pray out of you how many has ever had it
[1:29:32] happen well of course many of you have
[1:29:33] and we know we can do it and we continue
[1:29:36] to do it of course but there's times
[1:29:38] that he supernaturally will come and he
[1:29:42] will speak out of our human vessel and
[1:29:45] he himself will take our voice and it
[1:29:48] sounds just like our voice but it's not
[1:29:52] so much the first voice that you hear
[1:29:54] but it's the voice behind the voice that
[1:29:57] makes the devil leave
[1:29:59] Oh Glory to God I'll tell you friend as
[1:30:03] a servant of God it's one of the most
[1:30:04] awesome experiences in your entire life
[1:30:07] I've shouted I've spoken tongues I you
[1:30:10] know I had different experiences with
[1:30:11] God but when the Lord God will take your
[1:30:14] voice and actually speak to an unseen
[1:30:17] demon in an Unseen World in an unseen
[1:30:20] realm that you yourself know hardly
[1:30:22] anything about and the spirit of God
[1:30:25] will speak to that devil and that devil
[1:30:27] will turn that person loose whether it's
[1:30:29] drug addiction whether it's alcohol
[1:30:31] whether it's homosexuality whatever it
[1:30:33] is and the spirit of God will set them
[1:30:36] free and you know it's not you all you
[1:30:38] were was just a microphone just like
[1:30:40] this right here but the Holy Ghost took
[1:30:42] care of vocal cords he took your lips he
[1:30:45] transmitted that thought down and that
[1:30:47] devil recognized not your Authority so
[1:30:49] much but the authority of the same Son
[1:30:52] of God don't you understand why that
[1:30:55] Satan hates the Church of the Living God
[1:30:57] because the truth of it is the Lord
[1:30:59] Jesus wants his body to do the exact
[1:31:02] same thing that we read in these
[1:31:04] scriptures that's why the devil wants us
[1:31:07] this message people just to become a
[1:31:09] cold bunch of theologians with no
[1:31:11] Supernatural power of God and we come to
[1:31:14] church and sit there and we just don't
[1:31:15] move we don't worship we don't sing we
[1:31:18] don't do nothing I tell one thing we
[1:31:20] will never get to heaven that's not
[1:31:23] being a dried up Touch of unbelievers or
[1:31:25] a bunch of church members the Lord God
[1:31:28] wants to manifest himself as the same
[1:31:30] yesterday today and forever he still
[1:31:34] heals the sin he still casts off Devils
[1:31:37] he still delivers his children and since
[1:31:40] the cat they're free amen Jesus Christ
[1:31:43] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:31:49] oh Hallelujah
[1:31:50] [Applause]
[1:31:59] demons recognized
[1:32:01] Jesus had authority over them
[1:32:08] They begged
[1:32:10] They begged
[1:32:12] don't send us sir please
[1:32:15] don't send us
[1:32:16] to the abyss
[1:32:19] to the bottomless pit
[1:32:24] it's amazing this story here because you
[1:32:27] have
[1:32:28] three instances
[1:32:32] of people begging
[1:32:35] well the first category when actually
[1:32:37] people is demons
[1:32:39] They begged
[1:32:41] to not be cast into the pit the abyss
[1:32:44] the bottomless pit
[1:32:47] once the people of that area heard this
[1:32:50] man was healed
[1:32:52] They begged Jesus to leave
[1:33:01] can you imagine Jesus Christ does this
[1:33:03] and brother but the people of that
[1:33:05] Community went out there and begged the
[1:33:09] Lord Jesus to leave
[1:33:13] do you know geographically who these
[1:33:15] people were
[1:33:18] they were descendants
[1:33:20] a part of those that did not cross
[1:33:22] Jordan
[1:33:25] and wanted to stay on this side and get
[1:33:28] their inheritance and many generations
[1:33:31] later here's the Lord Jesus himself and
[1:33:34] they're still doing the same thing
[1:33:35] refusing to cross over and get the
[1:33:38] inheritance of the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:40] Ghost
[1:33:41] so can you imagine you'd rather have a
[1:33:43] man out of his mind your wife couldn't
[1:33:45] even go by that vicinity your children
[1:33:47] couldn't even go by that vicinity
[1:33:49] because this man don't you get up you
[1:33:51] sit right there I'm not done preaching
[1:33:53] it's not I forgot about him then you all
[1:33:55] know I want a torment that outfit
[1:33:59] your wife couldn't go by that area your
[1:34:02] children couldn't go by that area and
[1:34:03] the Lord Jesus delivers this man and you
[1:34:06] would rather have him there like he was
[1:34:13] so the demons begged the people begged
[1:34:17] and then this man that the demons left
[1:34:21] the Bible said he Basalt which is to
[1:34:25] mean beg
[1:34:26] his begging was this
[1:34:29] Lord Jesus let me go with you
[1:34:32] let me travel with you
[1:34:35] but the Bible tells us that Jesus told
[1:34:38] him no
[1:34:40] now Jesus answered the petitions of the
[1:34:44] demons and he answered the petition of
[1:34:47] those who didn't want him there
[1:34:49] but he didn't answer the petition of the
[1:34:51] man who asked for something that was
[1:34:53] seemingly good why he was asking for the
[1:34:56] wrong thing and the Lord Jesus told him
[1:34:59] he said no no you're not going it was me
[1:35:01] but what I want you to do is go back to
[1:35:05] your home and your family and tell them
[1:35:08] notice tell them what great things God
[1:35:12] has done for you and the Bible said he
[1:35:16] went back to his home there and told
[1:35:18] them what great things Jesus
[1:35:22] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:25] oh this man must have had an insight
[1:35:28] into the godhead
[1:35:30] Hallelujah don't tell them what God has
[1:35:34] done for you you imagine him getting
[1:35:36] down there whenever you come down that
[1:35:38] old Island and the prophet said his
[1:35:39] little wife was out there and she took
[1:35:42] over and he said oh honey honey I'm
[1:35:43] changed I'm changed his little young and
[1:35:45] sowing and the people of the city saw
[1:35:48] him but he said I'm Different I met a
[1:35:50] man I met a man that he took my life and
[1:35:53] he changed me can't you see why Jesus
[1:35:56] didn't want him traveling around but he
[1:35:58] said go back to your house
[1:36:00] go back to your wife go back to your
[1:36:03] children
[1:36:06] oh
[1:36:08] praise be to God
[1:36:12] look in Revelation chapter 9 verse 1.
[1:36:15] and the fifth angel sounded and I saw a
[1:36:18] star
[1:36:19] from Heaven unto the Earth
[1:36:22] and to him was given
[1:36:24] the key
[1:36:26] of the bottomless pit
[1:36:29] ah now this is Revelation chapter 9 and
[1:36:32] the other is Revelation chapter 20.
[1:36:35] he opened the bottomless pit and there
[1:36:39] arose a smoke
[1:36:41] out of the pit as the smoke of a great
[1:36:44] furnace and the Sun and the air were
[1:36:46] darkened
[1:36:47] by reason of the smoke
[1:36:50] of the pit
[1:36:52] so you see even the pit
[1:36:55] and the key links together with certain
[1:36:58] dispensations of what's released out of
[1:37:01] it
[1:37:03] now no doubt them Devils would have
[1:37:04] loved to come out of there he said you
[1:37:06] said where you are
[1:37:07] don't you come near that door smack you
[1:37:09] down in there you hear me
[1:37:12] so God allowed smoke
[1:37:15] to come out of the very same existence
[1:37:19] but it was not time for the devil to
[1:37:21] come out nor time for these others to go
[1:37:23] in
[1:37:25] and there came out of smoke of locust
[1:37:27] upon the Earth and unto them were given
[1:37:30] power as the Scorpions of the Earth have
[1:37:33] power now notice in verse 11. and I had
[1:37:37] a king over them which is the angel
[1:37:40] Lord have mercy
[1:37:42] you imagine an angel giving a Dominion
[1:37:46] of the bottomless pit
[1:37:50] which is the Angel of the bottomless pit
[1:37:53] whose name in the Hebrew tongue
[1:37:57] is a baton
[1:37:59] but in the Greek tongue hath its name
[1:38:03] apollyon
[1:38:05] chapter 11 verse 7 and when they had
[1:38:07] finished their testimony
[1:38:09] the prophets Moses and Elijah the Beast
[1:38:13] now to send us out
[1:38:16] of the bottomless pit
[1:38:19] shall make war against them
[1:38:23] and overcome them
[1:38:26] and kills them
[1:38:28] now what's amazing is the Bible tells us
[1:38:30] when this happened that they will not
[1:38:31] allow Moses and Elijah's bodies to be
[1:38:34] buried
[1:38:35] so they will lay in the streets of the
[1:38:38] city which spiritually is called Sodom
[1:38:41] and Egypt
[1:38:43] for also our Lord was crucified that's
[1:38:47] what Revelation says which was Jerusalem
[1:38:50] not whenever they would not allow their
[1:38:54] bodies to be buried so what does God do
[1:38:57] when God kills these others he said
[1:39:00] don't bury them don't give them no
[1:39:02] ceremony but leave their carcasses out
[1:39:05] on the face of the Earth that's what
[1:39:07] they've done to my prophets that's what
[1:39:10] I'll do to them
[1:39:12] look for in God has a law whatsoever
[1:39:14] your sow that shall you also read you're
[1:39:18] so trouble guess what you're going to
[1:39:19] reap you're so arrogance guess what
[1:39:22] you're going to reap well come on now
[1:39:23] you saw an attitude that you think
[1:39:26] you're better than other people you
[1:39:27] realize you're going to reap that one
[1:39:29] day
[1:39:29] there's only one person better than all
[1:39:32] people and that's the Lord Jesus and the
[1:39:34] rest of us are dirt bags
[1:39:37] now your dirt bag May cost a little more
[1:39:39] than my dirt bag but you're still a dirt
[1:39:40] bag
[1:39:41] that's right you're a silly human being
[1:39:43] and you still stink under your arms and
[1:39:45] you've got a bad breath of a morning
[1:39:46] well come on now you may put a 500 mink
[1:39:49] coat on the prophet said it that way and
[1:39:51] he said stick your nose up in the iron
[1:39:53] if it rained it drowns you and you may
[1:39:55] think you're really something but you
[1:39:57] know what give yourself about seven to
[1:39:59] two hours after life leaves that body
[1:40:01] that you're making idle out of and see
[1:40:03] what happens to you the most beautiful
[1:40:05] women in the world the most handsome and
[1:40:06] the woman in the world you know what
[1:40:08] happens to them they become like a deer
[1:40:10] that's run over you've seen them and now
[1:40:12] in the last several weeks this time of
[1:40:13] the year it increases of course deer
[1:40:15] laying on the side of the road and yet
[1:40:17] within a few weeks or months whatever
[1:40:19] more what happens to them if it's a big
[1:40:21] buck he's got great big beautiful horns
[1:40:23] and and the bones and all the skin and
[1:40:26] everything there what goes hell what
[1:40:27] happens to that big pile of a deer
[1:40:29] laying there goes right back into the
[1:40:31] nutrients of the earth what happens to a
[1:40:33] human body do whatever you want to with
[1:40:35] it embalm it have you seen some of them
[1:40:37] guys that's been embalmed don't you I'd
[1:40:39] rather wind up looking like a bunch of
[1:40:41] dust and I will their mummies wow that's
[1:40:44] ugliest looking thing you've ever seen
[1:40:45] in your life and they're going to take
[1:40:47] that in the afterlife goodness no Give
[1:40:49] Me Jesus I want that old carcass to go
[1:40:52] over their skin draped over a rack of
[1:40:54] Bones no sir let me have a brand new
[1:40:56] body because I follow his word so
[1:40:59] there's none of us that's better than
[1:41:01] anybody else we all need Jesus we all
[1:41:04] need the Holy Ghost we all need to be
[1:41:06] saved and there's only one great one
[1:41:08] among us and that's this great Lord
[1:41:10] Jesus
[1:41:17] Revelation 17 8 the Beast that thou
[1:41:21] sawest was
[1:41:23] and there's not
[1:41:25] and Shout Ascend out of the bottomless
[1:41:28] pit
[1:41:29] now it's amazing that these other demons
[1:41:32] once they were assigned to the pit
[1:41:35] they couldn't come out
[1:41:38] but the king here apollyon and a baton
[1:41:42] he can still Ascend and descend move in
[1:41:46] and out at leisure
[1:41:50] until the day of his judgment arrives
[1:41:55] notice who's going to go into this
[1:41:58] shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit
[1:42:00] and go into Perdition and they that
[1:42:02] dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose
[1:42:06] names were not written in The Book of
[1:42:09] Life
[1:42:10] from the foundation of the world
[1:42:13] when they behold the Beast that was and
[1:42:17] is not and yet is so a pope then he dies
[1:42:21] then another one is and he dies is and
[1:42:25] is not and yet is what is it the power
[1:42:29] moves from one to another to another
[1:42:30] don't you understand where he got that
[1:42:32] symbol at don't you understand why a
[1:42:34] word that he always impersonates God the
[1:42:36] holy ghost that was on Peter James and
[1:42:38] John and then what did God do the seven
[1:42:40] breaks Menorah what would they do they
[1:42:42] would take one light lit by the Holy
[1:42:44] Fire of God then they would take that
[1:42:46] candle and pull it out and light the
[1:42:48] other and the other and the other and
[1:42:51] the other that's why the prophet of God
[1:42:53] was sent to bring a message of
[1:42:55] restoration that would restore us back
[1:42:58] to the original lighting of the original
[1:43:00] fire that came on the day of Pentecost
[1:43:03] and friends I don't know if you're aware
[1:43:04] of or not but there is a move in and
[1:43:07] around our message that is gaining
[1:43:08] momentum that they don't want that
[1:43:10] old-fashioned fire no more they don't
[1:43:13] want that old-fashioned enlightened from
[1:43:15] that original Pillar of Fire but it's a
[1:43:17] water down mental conception of
[1:43:19] believing that God sent her prophet and
[1:43:21] many of you can live however you want to
[1:43:23] live that's a lie right out of the pits
[1:43:25] of hell
[1:43:26] it'll never change a life it'll never
[1:43:29] produce a new virus we've got to be lit
[1:43:32] little to see it has to be lit by the
[1:43:35] original Pillar of Fire just like Peter
[1:43:37] had
[1:43:39] God wants this church to have the same
[1:43:42] holy ghost that he gave to him on the
[1:43:44] book of Acts chapter 2.
[1:43:50] what's that
[1:43:59] praise be to God
[1:44:02] notice Revelation chapter 20 verse 2.
[1:44:06] now this Angel comes down with the key
[1:44:08] to the bottom of his pit and he has a
[1:44:09] chain in his hand
[1:44:10] then verse 2 says
[1:44:13] and he not they but he
[1:44:16] laid whole
[1:44:18] on the Dragon
[1:44:20] that old serpent
[1:44:22] which is the devil
[1:44:24] and Satan
[1:44:26] isn't it amazing how many different
[1:44:28] titles he has
[1:44:31] notice what he calls him the Dragon
[1:44:34] that old serpent the devil and Satan
[1:44:41] I love this and bound him a thousand
[1:44:46] years
[1:44:48] praise be to God
[1:44:51] aren't you glad that's our Great Mighty
[1:44:54] conqueror the Lord Jesus
[1:44:57] come up
[1:44:59] and put a seal on him not by the log
[1:45:02] chain but a chain of circumstance
[1:45:04] he can't go out no more till the
[1:45:06] thousand years were finished the prophet
[1:45:09] said we know the great day of the last
[1:45:11] rain when Satan will be bound and
[1:45:14] chained with a chain of circumstance he
[1:45:17] cannot come out and deceive the Nations
[1:45:20] no more until the Thousand Years the
[1:45:23] millennial reign will take place on the
[1:45:25] earth while we're here glorifying our
[1:45:28] Lord Jesus and adoring him and crowning
[1:45:31] him the King of Kings and the Lord of
[1:45:34] lords
[1:45:36] praise be to God oh Lord hasten the day
[1:45:40] how many wants to be ready to meet him

[1:46:51] to know tonight dear God
[1:46:53] that we win this war
[1:46:56] Hallelujah
[1:46:58] if these demons could have such
[1:47:00] confidence
[1:47:02] and such faiths in you
[1:47:06] and in your power
[1:47:08] they knew if you would have told them to
[1:47:11] go into the abyss the bottomless pit
[1:47:13] right then
[1:47:15] they would not be able to possess
[1:47:17] another human
[1:47:20] but instead you allowed them to go into
[1:47:23] this swine this herd of pigs
[1:47:28] and it drove those pigs out of their
[1:47:31] mind
[1:47:32] and they ran down a steep place and run
[1:47:35] into the water
[1:47:36] and they were choked
[1:47:39] and of course them demons come out of
[1:47:41] them Hogs
[1:47:43] and they went out looking for other
[1:47:45] places
[1:47:47] to be able to habitate
[1:47:50] Lord God if Devils can beg you for mercy
[1:47:54] oh Lord

[1:48:18] we know there's times that we must fight
[1:48:20] this battle with our faith
[1:48:23] and then those Sublime moments when you
[1:48:26] know that we cannot go any farther
[1:48:29] but it's just our human Faith you

[1:48:33] and you speak out of our lips and anoint
[1:48:36] us with your face Lord God
[1:48:40] father I pray for those tonight maybe
[1:48:43] they're they're at that place that time
[1:48:45] in their life and they need you so much
[1:48:48] Lord
[1:48:49] would you move for him Jesus
[1:48:52] Lord God we don't want you to make it so
[1:48:55] easy for us that we never struggle or
[1:48:57] have any hardships or anything but God
[1:49:00] you know how we are sometimes we get to
[1:49:02] a place that seemed like we can't go any
[1:49:03] farther
[1:49:05] help us tonight Jesus
[1:49:07] Lord God we believe you
[1:49:10] we love you
[1:49:12] we worship you mighty God
[1:49:15] Hallelujah
[1:49:17] we bless your name tonight father
[1:49:21] while we're in your presence
[1:49:24] you have honored Us by coming into this
[1:49:26] place tonight
[1:49:28] Lord every time we've met you on the
[1:49:30] Holiday Inn since we've sold our other
[1:49:33] property there's not been one service
[1:49:36] that you haven't showed up
[1:49:39] not one service that you haven't been
[1:49:42] here with us so it's it's been different
[1:49:44] for us for sure it's not our own and all
[1:49:47] of that but you've not disappointed one
[1:49:50] time
[1:49:51] and we believe tonight will be no
[1:49:53] different Lord
[1:49:55] we call Upon Your Name Lord Jesus
[1:49:58] would you come by this way and bring
[1:50:00] healing father
[1:50:02] would you bring Deliverance Lord
[1:50:05] would you set the captive free
[1:50:08] oh Lord God those that are bound with
[1:50:10] besetting sins and maybe habits that
[1:50:13] they've tried to break on their own and
[1:50:14] they just can't seem to do it May the
[1:50:17] spirit of God pass this way tonight
[1:50:21] if a devil can believe you're a savior
[1:50:24] but yet no you're not his
[1:50:26] and he can have faith in you to believe
[1:50:29] that you will determine and control his
[1:50:32] destiny
[1:50:34] how much more can we as the Sons and
[1:50:36] Daughters of God tonight
[1:50:38] believe that you're not only a savior
[1:50:41] but you're our savior
[1:50:44] not only believe that you control
[1:50:47] and determine our destiny
[1:50:49] but we believe you predetermined our
[1:50:52] destiny to be a part of your word
[1:50:54] before the foundation of the world
[1:50:57] so we don't have to go through this life
[1:50:59] wandering and pondering and hoping maybe
[1:51:01] we'll be saved somehow we we hope that
[1:51:04] we will no Lord we can have an assurance
[1:51:07] because the token brings an assurance
[1:51:10] that we have passed from deaths unto
[1:51:13] life
[1:51:14] we look at what we were and we look at
[1:51:17] what we are and what took place Jesus
[1:51:20] took place in the middle of that and
[1:51:23] that's why we're changed
[1:51:25] and will never be the same again
[1:51:28] hallelujah hallelujah oh it gives us
[1:51:32] Faith about our destiny
[1:51:34] so we're not begging you tonight it's
[1:51:37] demons oh don't cast us into the abyss
[1:51:39] don't cast us into the Lake of Fire no
[1:51:42] we're not even praying such a prayer
[1:51:44] because that's not where we're ordained
[1:51:46] to go that's not our home but you hewed
[1:51:50] us out of the pit that was not the abyss
[1:51:52] it was the pit and the mar of our sin
[1:51:55] and the Maori clay that we found
[1:51:57] ourselves in but you pulled us out of
[1:52:00] the pit you wiped us off you Sanctified
[1:52:02] us you cleanse us you filled us with the
[1:52:04] Holy Ghost you come and lived inside of

[2:05:45] and just say a few words say if you
[2:05:48] would in this Mission Prayer I would
[2:05:50] appreciate brother Mike coming I told
[2:05:52] him yesterday I guess it was that time
[2:05:54] over the church and brother Mike's the
[2:05:56] type of preacher that kind of sneaks in
[2:05:58] because he don't want you to feel
[2:06:00] obligated you know to use him or
[2:06:02] anything like that I really can't
[2:06:03] condemn him for that because I
[2:06:07] we certainly love our brother so I
[2:06:09] appreciate anybody it's been a real
[2:06:11] friend
[2:06:18] greedy would feel like foreign
[2:06:21] just real quick I'm
[2:06:23] thankful that the Lord has blessed us
[2:06:24] with places to worship
[2:06:27] I know you've been in this
[2:06:29] hotel for a few months
[2:06:32] we've been written a seven-day Adventist
[2:06:34] Church for a few years about 25.
[2:06:38] and they just got a new pastor
[2:06:42] and he's not real nice
[2:06:44] that I can tell yet and we need prayer
[2:06:48] to get over this little hunt
[2:06:50] so we can continue worshiping the Lord
[2:06:53] but you know what I was sitting there
[2:06:55] thinking if he needs to put us in a
[2:06:57] hotel I like this
[2:06:59] ain't bad
[2:07:01] so we thank God but you know I was
[2:07:03] thinking our brothers and sisters in
[2:07:04] Ukraine
[2:07:06] we've helped a family
[2:07:08] to get to our area
[2:07:12] and there's a family living with one of
[2:07:15] our brothers in the church
[2:07:16] and their homes back in Ukraine have
[2:07:19] been completely destroyed
[2:07:22] there's no land for them to live on
[2:07:26] and you know we had a prophet that said
[2:07:29] the last Vision he saw
[2:07:31] was the U.S smoldering in Ash
[2:07:35] and I was thinking today Lord you
[2:07:38] blessed us
[2:07:40] we got more junk and storage sheds
[2:07:43] in our yards
[2:07:45] and these people are struggling
[2:07:48] just to survive
[2:07:50] so we had a little a little part of
[2:07:53] helping a couple of families to get over
[2:07:54] here out of that tragedy
[2:07:57] we just know that God's in control and
[2:07:59] we know that we're near the end
[2:08:02] closer than we've ever imagined
[2:08:05] we have nothing to complain about
[2:08:08] it's the blessings of the Lord we're
[2:08:10] here this far he's given us the warning
[2:08:11] signs
[2:08:13] and we should be more than ready
[2:08:16] to go out brother Donnie said it so well
[2:08:18] we should not be afraid of what this
[2:08:20] Devil's saying
[2:08:22] brother Branham acknowledged he said
[2:08:24] what are you afraid of
[2:08:27] we got nothing to be afraid of not when
[2:08:30] we got the greatest gift
[2:08:32] power of the spirit of God to lead us
[2:08:35] and guide us
[2:08:37] let's just give him thanks as a body
[2:08:39] father we do thank you
[2:08:41] Lord that you've watched over us and you
[2:08:43] met our needs
[2:08:45] Lord sometimes we're so unthankful for
[2:08:48] all that we have
[2:08:50] and Lord if we want to give more
[2:08:52] as our brother said earlier we didn't
[2:08:54] praise you enough we didn't honor you
[2:08:56] enough in 22. help us Lord to have a
[2:08:59] stronger urge to Worship You In 23. Lord
[2:09:02] to go out with such a glorious praise to
[2:09:05] your name and Lord to enter into your
[2:09:07] presence Lord we know that we're not
[2:09:09] long here in this earth
[2:09:11] we know that you've watched over us and
[2:09:13] you give us a message Lord that's been
[2:09:15] right on time
[2:09:16] lord the devil doesn't like it but we
[2:09:18] that have received the revelation of the
[2:09:20] word for this day are standing and
[2:09:23] believing God and knowing that no devil
[2:09:25] can take it from us
[2:09:26] Because by the supernatural power you've
[2:09:29] led us this far and if you let us this
[2:09:31] far you will not let us down to make it
[2:09:34] all the way into the end father we thank
[2:09:36] you tonight for the word of life for the
