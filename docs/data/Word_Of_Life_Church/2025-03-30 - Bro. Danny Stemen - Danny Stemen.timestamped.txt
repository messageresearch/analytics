[17:10] night while on life's raging sea, it
[17:15] looked as if I would suffer defeat. As
[17:19] the blackness of night closed off the
[17:23] light, my heart sank with
[17:27] fear. My desperate cry rang out with
[17:32] fright. All I could see was no hope in
[17:37] sight. With faith all but gone, I met
[17:41] the one who came looking for
[17:46] me. He came looking for
[17:50] me. He came looking for
[17:56] me. He made a way. There was no way that
[18:02] I could
[18:05] see when I drifted so far. Jesus was
[18:10] near to rescue my soul and calm all my
[18:17] fears. I met the one who came looking
[18:21] for me.
[18:25] Oh, Satan had already kicked down my
[18:29] grave. His plan and moved forward to put
[18:33] me away. I drifted so far. Would anyone
[18:38] care that I'd soon be
[18:43] lost? Well, I knew my destruction was a
[18:47] matter of time. But Jesus appeared and
[18:51] said, "This one is mine. Now I'm safe
[18:54] with no harm. He walked through my
[18:57] storm. He came looking for
[19:01] me." Oh, he came looking for me. He came
[19:06] looking for me. He came looking for me.
[19:13] He made a way when there was no way that
[19:18] I could
[19:21] see. When I drifted so far, Jesus was
[19:26] near to rescue my soul and calm all my
[19:31] fears. Now I'm safe from all harm. I met
[19:35] the one who came looking for me. Let's
[19:39] sing that second verse again.
[19:41] Well, oh, Satan had already picked out
[19:45] my grave. The planet moved forward to
[19:49] put me away. I drifted so far. Would
[19:54] anyone care? I'd soon be
[20:00] lost. But I knew my destruction was a
[20:04] matter of time. But Jesus appeared and
[20:08] said, "This one is mine. Now I'm safe
[20:11] with no harm." He walked through the
[20:14] storm. He came looking for
[20:18] me. Oh, he came looking for
[20:23] me. He came looking for me.
[20:30] He made a way when there was no way that
[20:35] I could
[20:38] see. When I drifted so far, Jesus was
[20:43] near. Rescue my soul and calm all my
[20:48] fears. Now I'm safe from all harm. I met
[20:52] the one who came looking for me.
[20:57] Oh, he came looking for me. He came
[21:01] looking for me. He came looking for me.
[21:08] He made a way. There was no way that I
[21:14] could see.
[21:17] When I drifted so far, Jesus was near to
[21:23] rescue my soul and calm all my fears.
[21:27] Now I'm safe from all harm. I met the
[21:31] one who came looking for
[21:35] me. When I drifted so far, Jesus was
[21:41] near to rescue my soul and calm all my
[21:45] fears. Now I'm saved from all harm cuz I
[21:49] met the one who came looking for
[21:56] me. Amen. Aren't you so glad he found
[21:59] you this morning? Amen. You can be

[27:33] While Jesse and Bobby get ready to sing,
[27:35] I just wanted to make mention and I
[27:37] don't I might get kicked off platform
[27:39] permanently for this, but there were two
[27:42] local companies uh this is for the local
[27:44] folks that donated a lot of material for
[27:47] us to use for the banquet and it made it
[27:49] really nice for the youth and that was
[27:50] site one landscape supply and yard and
[27:54] garden depot in Hampton. the little
[27:56] nursery there across from the Dunkin
[27:58] Donuts. So, if you would locally, if
[28:01] you'd pray for them that God would bless
[28:03] their businesses and support them, uh I
[28:06] would appreciate it because they gave us
[28:08] uh probably about $20,000 worth of
[28:10] material to use, not knowing if it was
[28:13] going to be damaged when it got back or
[28:14] whatever. But, so I I I just wanted to
[28:17] mention their names this morning and
[28:19] pray that God would bless their
[28:20] businesses for uh letting our youth
[28:23] allowing our youth to use that
[28:26] [Applause]

[32:32] say I fall on my ear.
[32:39] Your
[32:40] grace still amazes
[32:45] me. Your
[32:48] grace still
[32:53] amazes me.
[32:55] [Music]
[33:07] [Music]
[33:13] I'm sure we can all say that today
[33:16] the more we find out about his grace
[33:19] and how much we really really need it
[33:23] every day of our lives. I think from the
[33:25] sermon that we heard the other night
[33:27] that grace is more than just when we
[33:30] first get saved,
[33:32] is it? It's continually ongoing. Grace
[33:35] for healing, grace for trials, grace for
[33:38] difficulties and tests. And we're just
[33:40] so thankful for that. We're going to
[33:42] invite brother Danny to come this
[33:45] morning and the last service in this
[33:48] series. And we just want to say how
[33:50] blessed we've been. Not only for the
[33:53] minister brothers that have come. We so
[33:55] appreciate brother David and brother
[33:56] Danny coming to speak to us, but we've
[33:59] been blessed all the visitors that have
[34:01] been in our gates. the youth that have
[34:03] come and the parents that have come with
[34:05] some of them. And we just thank you so
[34:07] much for bringing your lick of fire to
[34:10] be a part of us. And you have blessed us
[34:13] being here these days. And we trust that
[34:15] you've received something from the Lord
[34:17] yourself, something that you'll be able
[34:19] to take back home with you, make it
[34:21] applicable to your life, make you to be
[34:23] a better person of what the Lord wants
[34:25] you to be. That's the reason we come to
[34:26] church in it. That's the reason we come
[34:28] to to have special meetings together and
[34:31] to be able to see one another. And
[34:32] there's just something about the
[34:33] fellowship that we have together. We're
[34:36] so honored today to have true men of God
[34:39] that desire to bring the truth and not
[34:42] just bring theology. We don't want just
[34:44] doctrine, but we want the spirit of
[34:47] truth.
[34:48] Right? We want this whole gospel of the
[34:52] Lord Jesus. So, if you're here today and
[34:53] you need healing, our God is a healer.
[34:56] Amen. You need a miracle, our God is a
[34:59] miracle worker. You need the Holy Ghost,
[35:02] he still baptizes with the Holy Ghost.
[35:04] So whatever you have need of today, we
[35:06] want to just open our hearts. Hey, maybe
[35:08] we can just sing together. Only believe.
[35:12] No matter how much that we know or how
[35:14] much we think we know about the theology
[35:16] of the Bible and the theology of the
[35:18] Godhead and all of that, when it comes
[35:21] down to our real needs and going through
[35:23] trials, which one of the seven thunders
[35:26] do you use to overcome
[35:29] temptation? Which great dark deep
[35:32] mystery is it whenever oppression's
[35:34] coming against your mind and sadness and
[35:37] forsaken by your friends? Which great
[35:40] mystery is it that you use to overcome?
[35:43] A lot of times it's the simplicity of
[35:45] the word, isn't it? Jesus was the word
[35:48] and he could have used all types of
[35:49] theology when Satan came against him.
[35:52] But he didn't. And he didn't spend all
[35:55] of his time trying to tell I'm the son
[35:57] of God. I'll tell you one thing. I'm the
[35:58] word. I'm this, that, and the other. So
[36:00] when you get done with all that, the
[36:02] devil don't believe it anyway. So just
[36:04] use the word that applies to your needs
[36:07] and that's what God will help you to
[36:08] overcome with. Let's sing it together
[36:10] now, can
[36:12] we?
[36:15] Only believe everybody
[36:19] now.
[36:22] Only
[36:25] believe. Do we still believe this? All
[36:29] things are
[36:31] possible if we
[36:35] only
[36:38] believe. Oh,
[36:42] help us, Lord. Take away any unbelief
[36:45] we'd have today. Father,
[36:51] [Music]
[37:02] Holy. We sing Lord I believe. And
[37:07] Lord I
[37:12] believe.
[37:14] Lord I
[37:18] believe that all
[37:21] things are possible.
[37:23] [Music]
[37:26] Lord,
[37:28] I
[37:30] believe. And
[37:33] Lord, I
[37:37] believe. Oh
[37:40] Lord, I
[37:43] believe that all things are possible.
[37:52] Lord,
[37:54] I believe
[37:56] thee. Amen. How many say that's our
[37:59] desire this morning that we just want to
[38:01] believe him. Amen. He never did ask us
[38:04] to understand everything, but he did ask
[38:06] us to believe him. And that's what I
[38:08] want to do because there's a lot of
[38:10] things I do not understand and and when
[38:12] trials get harder and rough and
[38:14] everything, I just want to believe him
[38:15] and I want to trust him and know that
[38:17] he's going to do the outworking and I
[38:19] just stand still. So, amen. We want to
[38:22] say God bless you. It certainly has
[38:23] been, Amen, a real privilege for me to
[38:26] be here and just to Amen. renew some old
[38:30] friendships and to make some new ones.
[38:32] And I just want to say it's it's been a
[38:35] real honor. And I want to thank brother
[38:37] Donnie and Sister Carol for their
[38:39] hospitality and the fellowship. And I
[38:42] appreciate Brother Donniey's ministry
[38:44] and his stand over the years. And I know
[38:46] it's been a real blessing to you as it
[38:48] is to the bride. Amen. around the world.
[38:51] Amen. I also want to appreciate uh the
[38:54] ministry that God has sent out of this
[38:56] church. Amen. And uh I see brother
[38:59] Jackie, amen, over there. He was the
[39:01] first man that uh I ever traveled with
[39:04] overseas. And I don't think God could
[39:06] have given me a better example of uh
[39:10] humility and um uh grace and love like
[39:13] he did with brother Jackie. And brother
[39:16] Jackie will be forever known in places
[39:18] that you've never heard of. Amen. And
[39:20] and I just I love you, Brother Jackie.
[39:22] And I just appreciate your ministry and
[39:25] what it's meant to me. Amen. And and I
[39:27] think God knows how to put men in front
[39:29] of other men to kind of give them
[39:31] something to look at. And and um you
[39:34] know, I I know Brother Jackie may not
[39:37] remember this, but we had spent many
[39:38] hours going up into the middle of
[39:40] nowhere, and that probably was the name
[39:42] of the place, Nowhere. And and it was in
[39:45] the jungle. We were tired. We were hot.
[39:47] I was exhausted. And it was about 11:00
[39:49] at night. And we was staying in this
[39:51] this platform, had no walls. And I just
[39:55] laid down on the floor and and started
[39:57] to go to sleep. And all these natives
[39:58] come in and gathered around us. And I
[40:00] remember laying there listening to
[40:02] Brother Jackie sing as loud as he could.
[40:05] Amen. So I I admire that because I did
[40:07] not feel like singing. Amen. Amen. But
[40:10] we love you, Brother Jackie. Amen. Sure
[40:12] do. And uh I appreciate brother Daryl,
[40:15] his friendship and his ministry. He's
[40:17] been a great blessing. I know you love
[40:18] brother Daryl. Amen. And his ministry
[40:20] was so effective in our church that we
[40:23] had to literally beg my brother-in-law
[40:26] not to name his son
[40:28] Gonimo. Amen. And that's the truth. I
[40:33] mean it was right down to the wire. We
[40:35] were in the hospital and changed his
[40:37] mind. But thank the Lord. But we
[40:39] appreciate that. And I I I just couldn't
[40:41] imagine a son going through
[40:44] life. What's your name? Geronimo, and
[40:47] start a war. Amen. So, Amen. I don't
[40:50] want to ignore anybody else. I know
[40:52] there's other many ministers here, and
[40:54] we just appreciate the youth leaders,
[40:55] Brother Rob, Brother Joe, and and all
[40:58] that was able to make this weekend what
[40:59] it was. We just want to say God bless
[41:01] you. Amen. We just have Amen. just
[41:03] another part of the body of Christ down
[41:05] in Florida, and we want to bring
[41:06] greetings there from the church. and and
[41:08] I I just look forward to spending
[41:10] eternity together. Amen. Well, you may
[41:11] have to reintroduce yourself because
[41:13] we're all look a little different,
[41:14] younger, but Amen. We appreciate Amen.
[41:17] God and for all that he's done for us.
[41:19] How many love the message that he sent
[41:20] to us? And where would we be without it?
[41:23] We wouldn't know one another. We
[41:24] wouldn't have fellowship like this. We
[41:26] wouldn't have meetings like this. We
[41:27] wouldn't have freedom like this. Amen.
[41:29] And we would probably think, "If you're
[41:31] not a part of my church, you're out of
[41:32] it." But I'm glad that that God Amen.
[41:35] rich in mercy and for his grace. Amen.
[41:37] and he has called us and brought us
[41:39] together. So, God bless you. Let's just
[41:41] bow our heads if we can for a word of
[41:42] prayer. Father, we're so grateful to
[41:45] you. We love you, Lord. And we would ask
[41:48] you, Lord, to take this last service.
[41:50] And we ask you to have the preeminence,
[41:52] Lord, in it. And may you get all the
[41:54] honor and glory. May you anoint my lips,
[41:56] anoint the ears of the hearer. I do not
[41:58] know the people, Father, for the most
[42:00] part, but you do, Lord. And you're still
[42:01] the same yesterday, today, and forever,
[42:04] Father. We believe, Lord. Amen. in the
[42:06] power of your healing and your mercy and
[42:08] your grace. And I just pray as as I've
[42:10] heard the prophet pray and say things
[42:12] like this, I I would like to say the
[42:14] same thing. May I be able to say
[42:16] something that would plant courage,
[42:18] Lord, in the young people's heart. And
[42:20] Lord, and even us older folks, Lord, we
[42:22] we're still on the journey. We're still
[42:24] on our way, Father. We need you more
[42:26] than ever before. Lord, we commit this
[42:29] service to you and all that's said and
[42:30] done in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God
[42:34] bless you. I want you to turn with me if
[42:35] you will to the book of Matthew, the the
[42:38] fifth chapter. I just want to read one
[42:40] verse there and then I'm going to have
[42:41] you turn over to James the first
[42:44] chapter. Yesterday we preached on the
[42:48] true message of grace and and this
[42:51] morning I'm going to just preach on the
[42:53] true message of grace. All right. All
[42:56] right. And if you're counting that's
[42:58] two. All right. Amen. Just one verse.
[43:01] Bless uh Matthew 5 uh verse 4. These are
[43:06] the biatitudes on on the mountain that
[43:09] Jesus is speaking here. Now look at
[43:11] this, brother Donnie. You got a creature
[43:12] up here on the platform. I don't know
[43:14] what to do with it, but Amen. It's a
[43:17] stink bug or something. Did this ever
[43:19] happen before? There you go. It's a Is
[43:22] that what it is? Be glad it's not a
[43:23] wasp. I am glad it's not a wasp. It's
[43:25] still on me. Let me tell you why. Who
[43:28] did that?
[43:30] Yeah.
[43:33] All
[43:35] right. Well, we can't have
[43:39] everything. Amen. Matthew
[43:42] 5:4. And as he's saying, these are the
[43:44] biatitudes. And as I like to tell the
[43:46] church, these are the attitudes you
[43:48] should be in. Amen. And Jesus says here,
[43:51] very familiar, just one verse, blessed
[43:53] are they that mourn, for they shall be
[43:57] comforted. Amen. And of course, we know
[43:59] what mourning is. Mourning is grief.
[44:03] Mourning can be over trial. It can be
[44:05] over loss. Whatever it may be. But Jesus
[44:08] says, "Blessed are they that mourn, for
[44:10] they shall be comforted." Now, uh I I
[44:13] want to to say that that word um is an
[44:18] invitation. Uh that word is an
[44:22] invitation because you have a choice
[44:23] when you're mourning. You have a choice.
[44:26] You can either go the way of the
[44:28] comforter or you can go another way. All
[44:30] right? And and so it's actually it's a
[44:34] reversal and it's an invitation. Blessed
[44:36] are they that mourn. But if you choose
[44:39] me, I'll be your comforter. Yeah. Praise
[44:43] the Lord. So it's an invitation for us.
[44:47] Amen. And so we have an invitation to
[44:50] enter into his care. James 1 verse 2
[44:53] through 4. Very familiar.
[44:58] My
[44:59] brethren, count it all joy when you fall
[45:02] into diverse
[45:03] temptations, knowing this, that the
[45:06] trying of your faith workketh patience.
[45:09] But let patience have her perfect work,
[45:12] that you may be perfect and entire,
[45:15] wanting nothing. So that tells us as
[45:17] believers that trials are not just by
[45:20] chance, but they actually have a
[45:22] purpose. Amen. And it is the purpose is
[45:26] the trying of our faith. Amen. Because
[45:29] God has to try it. You say you believe
[45:31] now he's going to try to see. He already
[45:35] knows. But he's going to show you what
[45:37] you are. Amen. And and so Amen. And and
[45:42] if you Amen. allow it. Faith will work
[45:45] patience. Amen. So we are we are to to
[45:49] grow in what we go through. Amen. God
[45:53] bless you. You can be seated. So, we've
[45:55] been speaking on on true grace. And I I
[45:59] want to repeat a couple of the quotes
[46:01] that I that I read
[46:03] yesterday. And grace is that divine
[46:06] influence upon your heart. And it has a
[46:09] reflection in your life. And it is the
[46:12] joy and it's the favor of God. Amen. And
[46:16] it has an outworking in our life of
[46:18] gratitude. Amen. We're we're to grow in
[46:21] that. We're to grow in grace, the Bible
[46:23] says. We're to be strong in grace, the
[46:25] Bible says. So, and the grace that we're
[46:28] strong in is not the grace of the
[46:29] church. Amen. It is the grace of Jesus
[46:32] Christ. Amen. And and the prophet said,
[46:35] "Grace and love are twin sisters." You
[46:38] cannot have one without the other. So,
[46:41] when you see someone always complaining
[46:42] or always playing the victim card or
[46:45] always having a chip on the shoulder
[46:47] against somebody, they want grace, but
[46:49] they don't give grace. Oh my. Is that
[46:52] right? Amen. But that's not grace. Amen.
[46:54] Grace of God is something that Amen so
[46:57] affects us that it actually lives out
[46:59] through us. It begins to breathe out. I
[47:02] I don't know about you. Uh Amen. But I'm
[47:04] grateful for what God has brought me
[47:06] from. I realize the order I get where I
[47:08] could be.
[47:12] I realize where where I'm at now that I
[47:14] could be in another church.
[47:16] I could be under another understanding.
[47:18] I I I could be in a place where I think
[47:22] my church is salvation and amen the
[47:24] creed of salvation and the the dogma of
[47:27] salvation and and not allowing the Holy
[47:29] Spirit to have amen reign in my life. I
[47:32] could be that way. But God who's rich in
[47:35] mercy. I cannot compare my path to your
[47:39] path because it wouldn't do no good. Our
[47:40] paths are not the same. Our the what we
[47:43] came out of are not the same. But we can
[47:45] all say the same thing. God rich in
[47:48] mercy.
[47:50] So I I I I I want real true grace.
[47:54] Amen. As we read yesterday in the
[47:56] message of grace, he said the message of
[47:58] grace has been tramped under the feet of
[48:01] men until it becomes disgrace.
[48:04] Right? Some of them run out into eternal
[48:06] security. Some run out into everything.
[48:09] But where the but the true message of
[48:11] grace remains the same. And that's what
[48:14] Satan tries to knock it out from the
[48:18] church. So this is something he is going
[48:21] to keep doing. He's going to try to
[48:23] knock grace out of our life. Why? But
[48:26] that must mean grace not only affects
[48:29] us, but it affects others through us.
[48:33] And he does not want us projecting a
[48:35] church, he wants us projecting him.
[48:40] Hallelujah. Amen. And again, as we read
[48:42] yesterday in the sign, is this a sign of
[48:44] the inserve? Amen. Some of the things
[48:46] that the the Holy Spirit, amen, the
[48:48] angel of God, Amen, would finish our or
[48:50] reveal in the ministry of the seventh
[48:53] angel, Amen. And he said, um, he said
[48:56] serpent seed, a hidden mystery all
[48:58] through the years. He said, "Grace, true
[49:00] grace." A grace straightened out, not
[49:02] disgrace, but real true grace. You know,
[49:06] men can turn the grace of God into
[49:09] lasciviousness.
[49:10] Amen. Grace that can cover amen my my my
[49:15] immorals or it can cover amen my habits
[49:18] and all that. That's not the grace God's
[49:20] talking about. Cuz grace is not
[49:23] something weak and neither is it
[49:25] something scared.
[49:27] Come on. Amen. Amen. And he said the ma
[49:30] the mystery another another thing was
[49:32] revealed is the mystery of the baptism
[49:34] of the Holy Ghost without sensation but
[49:36] the person of Christ performing in you
[49:39] the same works that he did. Amen. There
[49:41] had to come a time where God would
[49:43] remove all the obstacles that the church
[49:46] has put in the way of the moving of the
[49:48] Holy Spirit. Amen. And and bring it to
[49:51] the person of Jesus Christ.
[49:56] Amen.
[49:58] So then one more that we read was Amen.
[50:01] the brother Benam and Satan Eden said
[50:03] the Holy Ghost is the action in you.
[50:07] It's a life,
[50:09] not an emotion.
[50:11] How many love emotions? I love emotions.
[50:14] No, nobody in here, as far as I know, is
[50:16] against emotions and and and and
[50:19] shouting and running and and all of
[50:21] that. But I'm telling you, amen.
[50:23] emotions, amen, are not proof of what
[50:26] you have.
[50:28] That's what the prophet is saying. It's
[50:30] not some sort of fleshly evidence. I I
[50:33] had uh some of my young people, they
[50:35] were like, "Well, I I I don't know if I
[50:37] have the Holy Ghost, and I feel like I
[50:38] have to scream or shout or run." And and
[50:40] they come back to me said, "Oh, Brother
[50:42] Danny, we shouted and we ran and we're
[50:44] so thankful for that." I said, "I I'm so
[50:45] glad you did." I said, "Wonderful. I I'm
[50:47] so glad you had that experience." I
[50:49] said, "But I want you to do me a favor
[50:51] now. I want you to go back in the Bible
[50:53] and I want you to anchor that experience
[50:55] in the word. Because if it did not come
[50:58] from the word, it's going to be gone by
[51:00] next week. Because I don't know if
[51:02] you're human like I am, but I have been
[51:04] happy and I've shouted, "Amen." But next
[51:07] week, here comes trouble and I'm just
[51:09] happy to get out of bed.
[51:13] Does anybody know what I'm talking
[51:14] about?
[51:16] Do you think I'm like this all the time?
[51:21] Hey, you're supposed to say, "Hey,
[51:25] amen." But he said, "Now, but but you
[51:27] know what? It doesn't matter up or down.
[51:29] It doesn't matter where I'm at. It does
[51:31] not move anything
[51:34] that's on the inside." Amen. I want to
[51:37] say as a way of testimony, there's
[51:39] something in me that God is anchored
[51:41] that I could not do myself. Amen. But he
[51:44] quickened it. I never put it there and I
[51:46] can't take it out. And if I can't take
[51:48] it out, you can't take it out. You never
[51:52] put me in the message. You can't take me
[51:54] out of the message. You never died for
[51:56] me. Amen. You never shed your blood for
[51:59] me. Therefore, I am who he is. You say,
[52:02] "Brother Daniel, well, this is so
[52:04] simple." Well, then you should amen
[52:05] louder. Cuz you can understand it.
[52:09] Hallelujah. But he said, "It's the word
[52:11] of God." Amen. It's it's a person, Jesus
[52:14] Christ, the word of God established.
[52:17] That's what we want to see. The word of
[52:18] God established in your heart.
[52:25] Amen. He said uh to quicken every word
[52:28] of this age. Watch the Holy Ghost in
[52:30] action. Not so much in
[52:32] demonstration. Not so much in the signs
[52:34] and wonders.
[52:38] Amen. But watch it when it's confronted
[52:41] by the word. Is it able to humble itself
[52:45] to the leadership of the word?
[52:49] That's how you begin to know the
[52:51] characteristic that is there.
[52:55] Amen. We believe as as brother Benham
[52:58] taught that the Holy Ghost is a definite
[53:00] experience you must have. But I'm not
[53:03] here to tell you how it will be.
[53:08] I'm here to tell you you have to have
[53:09] it.
[53:11] Amen. That's what Jesus preached. You
[53:13] must be born again. And born again by
[53:15] how? By the spirit. And I'm not the one
[53:18] to tell you, okay, you're not born
[53:19] again. That's not my job. My job is to
[53:21] preach the word.
[53:25] Cuz I don't know what's behind the
[53:26] fleshly evidence. I mean, there's some
[53:28] things that's pretty obvious to see, but
[53:30] there's other things I don't know. I
[53:31] don't know what you're going through. I
[53:32] don't know where your mind is. I don't
[53:34] know your battles, but I know a God who
[53:35] does know.
[53:37] That's right. 1 Peter 5:5 says,
[53:40] "Likewise, you younger, submit yourself
[53:42] unto the elder, yay, all of you. Subject
[53:45] yourself one to another, and be clothed
[53:48] with
[53:49] humility. For God resists the proud and
[53:54] gives grace to the humble."
[53:58] Amen. God resists the proud and gives
[54:01] grace to the humble. So humble yourself
[54:05] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[54:07] that he may exalt you in due time
[54:10] casting all your cares upon him for he
[54:12] cares for you.
[54:15] Praise the Lord. Now I want you to
[54:17] notice what the word says. The word says
[54:20] God resisteth the proud. It doesn't say
[54:24] he resists the discouraged. It doesn't
[54:27] say he resists the depressed. All right?
[54:29] It doesn't say he resists those who have
[54:31] a besetting sin. It doesn't say he
[54:34] resists those who have habits they can't
[54:35] kick. It doesn't say that. It says he
[54:38] resists the proud because the proud will
[54:41] not acknowledge what they're doing.
[54:43] Amen. But if you can humble yourself
[54:44] under the word of God and say, "God, I I
[54:47] don't want to be that and I don't want
[54:48] to go that way and I don't want to live
[54:50] like that. I don't want to be in this
[54:52] condition." Then God says, "I care for
[54:54] you." Amen. and I will come and I will
[54:57] give you grace.
[55:00] Well, I don't know about you, but Danny
[55:02] Steam needs grace and I need another
[55:05] portion of grace. I need God.
[55:08] [Applause]
[55:12] Amen.
[55:16] I had uh I've had young people come to
[55:19] me and they come up for
[55:21] prayer and they will
[55:24] say, "I I I I want I want God to help
[55:28] me. I I I want to I I don't want I want
[55:30] God to help me. I'm scared to go to
[55:32] hell."
[55:34] I tell him, I say, "You're coming for
[55:35] the wrong reason."
[55:38] We don't come to him because we're
[55:39] scared to go to hell.
[55:43] Because then you're not acknowledging
[55:44] what you're doing. You come to him
[55:46] because you want to serve him.
[55:50] I don't want God to save me from hell
[55:52] just so I can do what I want.
[55:54] [Applause]
[55:56] Preach that. I had another girl come to
[55:58] me and says, "I I need to be delivered
[56:00] of anxiety." And and so we'd pray and
[56:02] she would shake and she'd fall on the
[56:03] floor and then she'd go back to live the
[56:05] way she was.
[56:06] So, I'll tell you something and and you
[56:08] just bear with me, okay? You've done me
[56:10] the favor of making me feel at home. So,
[56:12] that that's and so I'll just act like I
[56:15] am home. Okay? So, I had a problem in my
[56:17] home one time and it was called rats.
[56:19] How many's ever had that problem? Amen.
[56:21] We don't have rats in Tennessee,
[56:23] wherever you're from, but I have big
[56:24] ones back home. They called wood rats.
[56:26] They didn't get in the house, but they
[56:27] got they got up in the attic. And and so
[56:30] I they they be they they become so
[56:32] pervasive that I could actually I'd hear
[56:34] them at 2:00 at night up above in the
[56:37] ceiling and I could actually learn their
[56:39] characteristics. They were all
[56:40] different.
[56:42] I mean I'd hear them squeak. I hear
[56:44] there was one particular he's always
[56:46] squeak. I We need those fellas to come
[56:48] up here and show us how that sounded
[56:49] again. Amen. And and they would squeak
[56:51] and and there's particular once I'm like
[56:53] all right I I had to get in the hunting
[56:56] spirit. And so I'm like, "All right, I
[56:58] I'm going to go hunting. It's time to go
[57:00] hunting." So I I I went, of course, you
[57:03] know what hunters do, they don't need
[57:04] it, but they go buy it anyway. So we we
[57:06] I went to Walmart and I didn't need this
[57:08] cuz I didn't have it. And I bought, you
[57:10] know, the rat killers. All right. It's
[57:11] called Victor
[57:13] Traps and big old traps, you know. So
[57:17] then I crawled up in my attic and I'm
[57:19] putting these traps everywhere and I I
[57:20] started getting one by one one and you
[57:22] know and and um and my sons, they were
[57:25] little at the time and one of them said,
[57:27] "Hey dad," he said, "Next time you get
[57:28] one," he said, "Uh uh" he said, "When
[57:30] can can I go up there with you?" And you
[57:34] know, he wanted to see it. I said,
[57:35] "Yeah." I said, "Sure." So 2 o'clock in
[57:36] the morning. Sure enough. And I got the
[57:37] squeak. I got squeaky and I heard I
[57:40] heard the trap
[57:42] pow. He just started squeaking. I go
[57:45] shake my son Joseph and say, "Hey, let's
[57:47] go, son. We're going
[57:49] hunting." So, it's awesome to go to a
[57:51] blind where the the animal's already
[57:53] there. Amen. And and I we got up there
[57:56] and we're crawling and he's a little boy
[57:59] and he's up there beside him. We're
[58:00] crawling. We get over there and you know
[58:02] trap the trap didn't hurt the rats at
[58:04] all. It just trapped them. They couldn't
[58:07] move. He had pow and it's laying there.
[58:09] And he looked at that thing and it
[58:12] looked
[58:13] cute and it's like and he's like, "Oh,
[58:17] dad. Oh, dad." I said, "Son," I said,
[58:19] "If you don't like
[58:21] this, you sure ain't going to like
[58:23] what's happening next
[58:26] cuz it ain't good enough to trap
[58:28] something.
[58:30] You got to kill it."
[58:33] Amen.
[58:38] So my son left my church and I took
[58:43] the I went and did the
[58:46] deed. Now here's the thing, young
[58:48] people. You want something from God. You
[58:50] want to be delivered of anxiety. You
[58:51] want to be delivered. But you know what?
[58:53] Even killing the rat's not good enough.
[58:57] Cuz then I had a job to do. I had to
[59:00] find out where they were getting in.
[59:04] Uh, and then I had to go where they were
[59:07] getting in. I had to seal everything up.
[59:10] And that would take care of the rat
[59:12] problem. And once I did that, I never
[59:15] heard another rat above me.
[59:19] Anybody understand what I'm talking
[59:21] about?
[59:22] We got some real rats in this age. Amen.
[59:26] That are gnawing at your life and
[59:27] they're talking to you and you're you'll
[59:29] never be born again and you'll never get
[59:31] the Holy Ghost. You never overcome
[59:32] pornography. You're never going It's not
[59:34] good enough to trap it. You got to seal
[59:38] that hole that it'll never get back in
[59:40] again.
[59:43] Hallelujah. Okay. I just want to say
[59:45] something. I could have prayed. I could
[59:48] have prayed 24 hours a day and it would
[59:51] not killed one rat. That's right. Cuz
[59:54] you got something to do.
[59:56] Grace provides the mean. You got to have
[59:58] the energy. All right.
[1:00:01] Don't tell me you want something from
[1:00:02] God and you're not going to go after it.
[1:00:08] Hallelujah. I hope that's all right.
[1:00:10] Yeah. I'll forever be known as the
[1:00:11] ratman from here on. Amen.
[1:00:14] Amen. Ephesians
[1:00:17] 1. Blessed be the God and father, our
[1:00:20] Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us
[1:00:22] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:00:23] places in Christ. Say all. All. Is there
[1:00:26] anything else other than all?
[1:00:29] So, where are you going to get anything?
[1:00:31] In Christ.
[1:00:34] Amen. And when he's saying heavenly,
[1:00:36] he's not talking about up here. He's
[1:00:38] talking about right here.
[1:00:41] Heavenly places is his position. Your
[1:00:44] position in him in the word.
[1:00:49] Amen. Amen. According as he has chosen
[1:00:52] us. When did he choose you? When you
[1:00:54] went to your favorite church.
[1:00:57] Come on. When did he choose you? He
[1:00:59] chose you in him before the foundation
[1:01:03] of the world that we should be holy.
[1:01:06] Amen. And without blame. Amen. Before
[1:01:09] him in love. He already provided the
[1:01:11] means.
[1:01:13] That's good. Having predestinated us
[1:01:16] into the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:01:20] Christ himself according to the good
[1:01:21] pleasure of his will. Brother Brandham
[1:01:23] said, "When what did the Holy Ghost fall
[1:01:25] on at Pentecost?" Sons. What did the
[1:01:27] Holy Ghost fall on at Corinth? Sons.
[1:01:29] They did not become sons. They were
[1:01:31] already sons. The Holy Ghost fell upon
[1:01:33] them and confirmed who they were.
[1:01:39] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:01:42] To the praise of the glory of his grace,
[1:01:45] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[1:01:48] beloved. So, so it's very important for
[1:01:51] you young people to realize it's not so
[1:01:53] important to be accepted by one another,
[1:01:54] but it is most important to be accepted
[1:01:56] in him.
[1:01:59] Amen. To the pray uh uh in whom we have
[1:02:02] redemption through his blood, the
[1:02:04] forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:02:06] riches of his grace. Brother Brandham
[1:02:09] said in Christ the mystery, heavenly
[1:02:10] places. Oh, I I wish I had time. I I've
[1:02:13] got it marked here in my Bible about
[1:02:15] heavenly places. What is heavenly places
[1:02:17] just for a moment? He said it's the
[1:02:18] believer's position in Christ. It's
[1:02:21] where the believer stands in Christ.
[1:02:25] Yes, sir. Amen. You say, "Well, I've
[1:02:27] heard that." But do you stand there? All
[1:02:29] right. You understand what a stand is?
[1:02:32] You make your stand there.
[1:02:39] Amen. Now, notice he said he
[1:02:41] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:02:42] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:02:45] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:02:46] will. He said predestinated. There's the
[1:02:49] mystery. He before Christ or anything
[1:02:51] else was ever on earth. You see his
[1:02:54] great mystery. He chose the bride
[1:02:56] knowing Eve would fall from disbelieving
[1:02:58] the word knowing she would fall. But he
[1:03:00] would choose a bride that would not fall
[1:03:04] that would hold to the word. Watch the
[1:03:06] characteristic. She will hold to the
[1:03:09] word regardless
[1:03:14] of what everybody else what the rest of
[1:03:15] the world has to say about it. They
[1:03:17] would hold. They're predestinated to
[1:03:19] stand at the adoption of children.
[1:03:20] That's where you're predestinated to
[1:03:21] stand. Amen. So, so what is God looking
[1:03:24] for? He's looking for people who will
[1:03:26] not change the word. That's the test of
[1:03:28] the hour. Amen. Do you do you understand
[1:03:30] to be called the bride means that you
[1:03:32] came out of the church to walk with the
[1:03:34] word? That's how you become the bride is
[1:03:36] to walk with the word. Amen. In uh in
[1:03:39] God of this evil age, he said, "Why
[1:03:41] would God choose such an evil time,
[1:03:43] amen, to to bring forth, Amen, a bride?"
[1:03:45] He said, "It's to prove to Satan." He's
[1:03:47] not proven to me. He's proven it to his
[1:03:48] enemy, his archeneemy, whom he kicked
[1:03:50] out of heaven. I'm going to prove to you
[1:03:52] I'll have a people, amen, who will not
[1:03:54] be deceived by your words, and they will
[1:03:56] not follow what you say. And they won't
[1:03:58] believe what you say about them. They'll
[1:04:00] believe. It doesn't matter where they
[1:04:02] came from. It doesn't matter what they
[1:04:04] were in life. Amen. But God rich in
[1:04:06] mercy is able to exalt you out of that
[1:04:08] condition. And they will believe you
[1:04:10] over they will believe me over your lie.
[1:04:14] [Applause]
[1:04:19] That's grace.
[1:04:21] I'm so glad that he is. Brother Brandham
[1:04:24] said grace provided Israel a great
[1:04:26] thing. And the message turning
[1:04:27] northward. He said grace had provided
[1:04:30] them a great thing. It provided them a
[1:04:32] Passover lamb. It provided them a
[1:04:35] prophet. It provided them an angel.
[1:04:39] Every one of them had a direct
[1:04:42] purpose. That's right. Passover lamb was
[1:04:44] for their
[1:04:46] sins. And that was under substitute.
[1:04:48] Now, we know, Amen. Our Passover lamb is
[1:04:50] Christ. Nobody else can do that. Amen.
[1:04:53] Paul said, "I did not come to dominate
[1:04:55] over your faith." That's right. but to
[1:04:58] be helpers of your joy.
[1:05:00] That's what I want to be. I believe
[1:05:02] every minister wants to be that. We
[1:05:04] don't come to dominate your faith. We
[1:05:06] come to be helpers of your joy.
[1:05:09] Strengthen your joy in who you are in
[1:05:11] him. Amen. To take the fear out of your
[1:05:13] life because you understand we deal with
[1:05:16] so much fear in prayer with people.
[1:05:18] Amen. You understand fear. You can
[1:05:20] understand that's not from God. Had a
[1:05:22] sister tell me a while back, I I had a
[1:05:24] dream and I heard a voice. Amen. And
[1:05:26] there's an angry man's voice telling me
[1:05:28] I didn't have the Holy Ghost. And I woke
[1:05:30] up so scared. I'm thinking, "Is that
[1:05:31] God?" And she's asking me in prayer, "Is
[1:05:33] that God?" I said, "No."
[1:05:35] You think God talks like that to his
[1:05:36] children? He's already saying his word.
[1:05:38] I have not come to give you a spirit of
[1:05:40] fear.
[1:05:43] But a peace. Did that give you peace?
[1:05:45] No, it didn't give you peace, but of
[1:05:46] power and of love and of a sound mind.
[1:05:49] It's the will of God for you this
[1:05:51] morning to have a sound mind.
[1:05:58] Oh, hallelujah. Lord, I want your
[1:06:00] soundness of mind,
[1:06:03] not tossed about.
[1:06:06] God gave them all that. The Passover
[1:06:09] lamb was for their sin. The prophet was
[1:06:10] for their instruction.
[1:06:13] And the angel was their guide.
[1:06:17] How can you miss it? Grace provided
[1:06:19] that. But after all of that, they wanted
[1:06:22] the law.
[1:06:24] and we got to the same place again when
[1:06:27] God through his grace has provided us
[1:06:32] he's provided us. There's not another
[1:06:34] generation on earth that has the
[1:06:36] understanding of the lamb of God like
[1:06:38] this generation. When brother Brandham
[1:06:40] said in the seals, he said uh I believe
[1:06:42] it was a seals brother Donnie
[1:06:44] demonstrated yesterday. He's got better
[1:06:45] memory than I do. So, amen. But anyway,
[1:06:48] now I forgot what I was going to say.
[1:06:50] Amen. But uh he said until that last
[1:06:52] name is manifested on that book, that
[1:06:55] lamb is there to take care of that name.
[1:06:57] You understand that the lamb of God, our
[1:06:59] Passover, is right here in this room
[1:07:01] right now taking care of the name. Some
[1:07:03] of them aren't manifested, but he's
[1:07:05] going to wait there until they are
[1:07:07] manifested. He cares for you.
[1:07:13] Aren't you glad, Brother JD?
[1:07:17] I love him.
[1:07:19] Why would we want to add anything to
[1:07:21] that?
[1:07:24] Now let's I want a prophet who's come to
[1:07:27] give instruction. I want his
[1:07:28] understanding of what grace is.
[1:07:32] Uh he said now you say brother Brandham
[1:07:34] this is in the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:36] Spirit. You say brother Brandham I guess
[1:07:37] once in grace always in grace. He said
[1:07:40] that brings a lot of disgrace. But when
[1:07:42] a man or woman has been born of the
[1:07:44] spirit of God old things pass away. All
[1:07:46] things become new and he's been birthed
[1:07:47] and blessed by the eternal God and they
[1:07:50] can no more perish and God himself can
[1:07:51] perish. I mean, why do you think I mean
[1:07:54] Paul was telling Timothy, lay hold of
[1:07:55] eternal life. He wasn't telling, "Hey,
[1:07:57] Paul, you uh Timothy, you don't have it
[1:07:58] yet." He was telling him, "Lay hold of
[1:08:01] of real life and and experience it to
[1:08:04] its fullness."
[1:08:07] Jesus said, "I am come that you might
[1:08:09] have life
[1:08:11] and have it."
[1:08:13] He wants you to get everything out of
[1:08:15] life. Paul said, "Amen. I was h
[1:08:17] apprehended by Christ." He said, "I have
[1:08:19] not apprehended." I said, "I want to
[1:08:20] apprehend him
[1:08:23] for what he apprehended me for."
[1:08:26] You mean God got a hold of my life in
[1:08:28] order for me to apprehend things for
[1:08:32] him? Lay hold of me. He laid hold of me.
[1:08:35] He He converted me. He brought a new
[1:08:37] man, amen, in with me. He quickened me
[1:08:40] from death and life. He laid hold of me
[1:08:42] so that I might be a witness. Amen.
[1:08:43] Acts. Amen. His conversion that he might
[1:08:46] be a witness and through him others
[1:08:48] might be converted. And he has many
[1:08:50] things to suffer
[1:08:52] for my name. We love to talk about
[1:08:54] quickening. We don't like to talk about
[1:08:55] suffering. Amen. But he said, "I may
[1:08:57] know him in the power of his
[1:08:58] resurrection
[1:09:01] and the fellowship
[1:09:04] of his
[1:09:07] and to be conformable." Yeah.
[1:09:10] unto his death.
[1:09:13] He quickened you. And then you go
[1:09:16] through suffering, but it's fellowship.
[1:09:23] You tell me that an infinite God would
[1:09:25] come down and give you eternal life.
[1:09:27] Listen, young people, maybe an elder one
[1:09:29] in here needs this, too. Listen, he
[1:09:31] didn't save you to lose you. That's
[1:09:32] right. We got so much creed. If you
[1:09:35] don't do what I say, if you don't do
[1:09:36] this, you don't, it's come right into
[1:09:37] the message. You don't do it this way,
[1:09:38] you're lost. I mean, I've had people in
[1:09:41] my church say, "See you in the
[1:09:42] millennium." I see you after the
[1:09:43] millennium. What does that mean?
[1:09:48] See you after the millennium.
[1:09:53] Didn't know you didn't like me that
[1:09:57] much. You mean you don't want to spend
[1:09:59] the millennium with me?
[1:10:03] You know,
[1:10:05] you Well, well, I guess because it's a
[1:10:07] thousand years of peace and we hadn't
[1:10:09] had any. So, Amen.
[1:10:15] No.
[1:10:18] Amen. Amen. God did not save you to lose
[1:10:22] you. I want to tell you about the record
[1:10:24] of
[1:10:26] God. You understand?
[1:10:29] In all the ages of the earth, he's never
[1:10:32] lost one.
[1:10:36] His record is unblenmished.
[1:10:39] He has never lost one. Well, you say,
[1:10:41] "My battle is I don't know if I am one."
[1:10:43] Well, you're in the right place. Amen.
[1:10:48] You're in the right place. Praise the
[1:10:49] Lord.
[1:10:51] Brother Bam said, "Now, if he could tell
[1:10:52] the end from the beginning, he saved you
[1:10:54] here this week and he knows next week
[1:10:55] you're going to backslide and lose you."
[1:10:56] What's he doing a work like that for?
[1:10:58] That would be foolish. So, you know what
[1:11:00] that tells me? That God already knew
[1:11:02] you. There's some of you sitting in
[1:11:04] here, you're battling pornography right
[1:11:06] now. Boy, it got quiet.
[1:11:12] That's not that funny.
[1:11:15] So, be a battle on lust. Oh, you know
[1:11:17] what comes with all those things? Shame.
[1:11:21] Oh, I tell you, boy. The devil knows how
[1:11:23] to pour it on to you, don't he?
[1:11:27] Oh, he knows how to, you know, oh, it
[1:11:29] may not be that. It may be something
[1:11:31] else, but he's pouring it on to you and
[1:11:33] you're getting lower and lower. If you
[1:11:34] were a son of God, if you were this, if
[1:11:36] you were that, if you were, and he's
[1:11:38] pouring it on and and here you're
[1:11:40] thinking, "Yep, he's right. He's
[1:11:42] right." But if God saved you, do you not
[1:11:46] think that God measured in every one of
[1:11:48] your faults and your failures into his
[1:11:50] grace?
[1:11:54] He measured every one of my mistakes
[1:11:58] into his grace and said my grace is
[1:12:00] sufficient.
[1:12:02] Now, now you might you might think,
[1:12:05] well, you don't hear my thoughts and
[1:12:07] what he's telling me. He's telling me
[1:12:08] there is no hope and he's telling me I
[1:12:10] don't have the Holy Ghost. When you
[1:12:11] going to learn to fight?
[1:12:13] Do you not realize those thoughts he's
[1:12:15] given you are his own thoughts? Amen.
[1:12:19] Because you know the Bible says about
[1:12:20] him that they lost their first
[1:12:22] habitation. There's no way back. Amen.
[1:12:24] You think about that. There's no way
[1:12:25] back for him. So if he knows what
[1:12:27] hopelessness is, Amen. There's nobody
[1:12:29] like the devil knows what it's like to
[1:12:31] not be able to change.
[1:12:34] He's nobody like the devil to know he
[1:12:36] can never be redeemed.
[1:12:39] So he's going to pour all of his
[1:12:41] anxiety, all of his depression, all of
[1:12:43] his things upon you and then try to make
[1:12:45] you think that's you. That's not you.
[1:12:47] That's his thoughts. You, as a redeemed
[1:12:50] son of God, have a right to stand up and
[1:12:52] say, "Amen. I have been redeemed by the
[1:12:54] blood of the lamb." Amen. He does not
[1:12:56] even see me. Amen. He sees He only sees
[1:13:00] the blood.
[1:13:02] You have a right.
[1:13:08] That's right. Well, now I'm not making
[1:13:10] excuses for lust or anything else like
[1:13:12] that because the blood cleanses us from
[1:13:13] all sin. But I'm just going to try to
[1:13:15] tell you, you got to learn how to fight.
[1:13:18] You can't lay there under something. But
[1:13:20] repentance would do a great work.
[1:13:25] Now, don't get the wrong idea of what
[1:13:26] grace is. Grace isn't weak. Grace is
[1:13:28] bold. Grace isn't scared. He's not
[1:13:32] afraid of your condition.
[1:13:36] I'm glad he's not.
[1:13:39] Amen. Brother Brandham in the in the
[1:13:41] message adoption said that watch that
[1:13:43] master uh teacher Paul the first thing
[1:13:45] he does he's trying to knock out the
[1:13:46] idea of falling
[1:13:50] away you fall away of ever being a
[1:13:53] Christian today and tomorrow I'm
[1:13:55] lost and God condemns me the next day
[1:13:57] and I'm back again. That's nonsense.
[1:14:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:04] Amen. So now I want to tell you
[1:14:06] something about the power of the of of
[1:14:08] his of the word before I start my
[1:14:14] message. I'll quit soon. Amen. But um
[1:14:18] I'd read a story maybe some of you had
[1:14:20] as well in in the period of the
[1:14:22] Holocaust where this
[1:14:25] Jew was arrested him and his wife and he
[1:14:28] was some kind of philosopher or
[1:14:30] something and they was young, they
[1:14:32] didn't have any children. uh he had
[1:14:34] written a
[1:14:35] book and um and when they were arrested,
[1:14:40] lost everything, they were taken into
[1:14:42] the camps and his his testimony
[1:14:45] was and I I want to find it because
[1:14:48] because it's good. Amen. His testimony
[1:14:51] was that they took him into the camps.
[1:14:54] They sent his wife to the ovens. She was
[1:14:57] burnt to death. And he said he said,
[1:15:00] "They stripped me of everything I had.
[1:15:03] They took my clothes. They took my wife.
[1:15:06] They took my identity. They shaved my
[1:15:08] head. They put number on my arm. Now I
[1:15:11] was just a number. He said I had
[1:15:13] smuggled in the book I had written. You
[1:15:15] know, just trying to keep something of
[1:15:17] my possessions. He said they took that.
[1:15:18] He said I lost everything. He said I
[1:15:21] lost my will to live because I had no
[1:15:23] purpose in
[1:15:24] life. Everything was gone. And they came
[1:15:27] and they dressed him in another inmate's
[1:15:29] clothes who'd already went to the ovens
[1:15:31] and and been burnt to death. And he
[1:15:32] said, "I I put these clothes on and this
[1:15:36] ragged coat." He said, "I'm standing
[1:15:38] there and I'm going to give up. I have
[1:15:40] no more purpose to live." And he said,
[1:15:41] "I
[1:15:42] put I I put my hand down in the coat and
[1:15:47] I felt a piece of paper." And he said,
[1:15:50] "I pulled that piece of paper out and it
[1:15:53] said, "Here, O Israel,
[1:15:56] the Lord our God is one Lord." Now
[1:15:59] listen, they had taken his heritage.
[1:16:03] But in his
[1:16:04] pocket was the Sheima Israel. Amen.
[1:16:08] Which means listen
[1:16:10] Israel here. Oh Lord, here o here, O
[1:16:13] Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.
[1:16:15] And you shall love the Lord thy God with
[1:16:17] all thy heart and with all thy soul and
[1:16:19] with all thy might. And these words
[1:16:21] which I commande this day shall be in
[1:16:23] your heart. And you shall teach them
[1:16:25] diligently unto your children, and talk
[1:16:27] of them when you sit in your house, and
[1:16:29] when you walk by the way, and when you
[1:16:30] lie down, and when you rise up, and bind
[1:16:32] them for a sign upon your hand, and they
[1:16:34] shall be frontlets between thy eyes, and
[1:16:37] you shall write them upon the post of
[1:16:38] thy house, and on thy gates. And he
[1:16:40] said, "How could I interpret this any
[1:16:42] other way than that? I have a purpose to
[1:16:45] live." I'm going to tell you, that's
[1:16:47] what the word of God is here to do to
[1:16:49] you this morning is to tell you, you
[1:16:51] have a purpose to live. Amen. The devil
[1:16:53] may have taken everything from you.
[1:16:55] Amen. But the word of God is still here
[1:16:57] and it still has your identity in it and
[1:17:00] the devil can never take it out.
[1:17:06] Praise the name of the Lord. You know
[1:17:09] the problem with Israel is they could
[1:17:11] never figure out God's love. They
[1:17:14] thought his love should be one of
[1:17:15] parental care, of taking care of a baby,
[1:17:18] just giving them everything they want.
[1:17:19] When they cry, he gives it to them and
[1:17:20] does that. He said, "But that," Brother
[1:17:22] Brandham said, "That wasn't Amen. Uh uh
[1:17:24] how God loves his children." His love is
[1:17:27] elective love. His love is that he
[1:17:29] thought of you before the foundation of
[1:17:31] the world and elected you to hear the
[1:17:33] word of your day and to be quickened by.
[1:17:36] He would not call your name Danny. He
[1:17:38] would preach the mysteries of God and it
[1:17:40] would quicken your heart. Amen. And it
[1:17:42] would something in you, a deep calling
[1:17:44] to the deep. Amen. You say, "Well, I
[1:17:46] just want to hear him call my name." He
[1:17:48] has over and over and over. Christ the
[1:17:51] mystery of God revealed. What is the
[1:17:52] attraction on the mountain? A deep
[1:17:54] calling to the deep. He's calling your
[1:17:56] name. And there's something in you say,
[1:17:58] "Amen." We We need the squawkers to
[1:18:00] stand
[1:18:01] up, right? I'm sorry, guys. I tell you
[1:18:05] that some nobody told you, but I have to
[1:18:06] tell you, one of them sound like a pig,
[1:18:08] your sound like a crow. You can figure
[1:18:09] that out. Amen. That's good. But it's
[1:18:12] good try. Praise the
[1:18:14] Lord. Want to tell you this. Amen. as I
[1:18:17] try to come to a place here that I I I
[1:18:19] felt the Lord had want to bring to young
[1:18:21] people is
[1:18:22] this. We become so discouraged because
[1:18:25] God doesn't answer the prayers the way
[1:18:28] we pray them.
[1:18:33] Brother Brandham said, "The thing is
[1:18:34] with people is the way God appears."
[1:18:38] Now, this is this is a hard one to
[1:18:39] understand if you're not careful. He
[1:18:41] says, "Many times we want to make an
[1:18:44] idol out of God." That's right.
[1:18:51] What does that mean?
[1:18:54] You know what that is? He says we ask
[1:18:55] God to do something and then he must do
[1:18:58] it just the way we ask it or we'll say
[1:19:04] he never answered.
[1:19:10] How many's prayed like that? Oh yeah. I
[1:19:13] didn't ask you to raise your hand. I
[1:19:14] just asked you if you done
[1:19:16] it. When we do
[1:19:18] that, we weaken our faith in God. Amen.
[1:19:23] And we weaken our testimony when we do
[1:19:25] not take him at his word. God always
[1:19:28] answered. That's right.
[1:19:31] No. Jesus said, "Ask and you shall
[1:19:34] receive. Seek." Yes, sir. And you shall
[1:19:38] find.
[1:19:40] Everyone that knocks, it'll be open to
[1:19:42] them. Now, that's the only way that I've
[1:19:44] always found it. Then I can get anything
[1:19:46] from God is to take him at his word and
[1:19:49] believe it the way he sends it. And if
[1:19:51] we do not take it just the way that we
[1:19:53] think it is, we have built God as an
[1:19:56] idol.
[1:19:59] That's why people get mad at God. That's
[1:20:01] why people leave God is because they've
[1:20:04] asked for a certain thing and it didn't
[1:20:07] happen the way they prayed. Yeah. Amen.
[1:20:09] Brother Brandham said in another place
[1:20:12] in so many words, he said that a man
[1:20:14] prayed for his mother and he read out of
[1:20:16] his prayer book and everything and when
[1:20:17] it didn't happen when she died, he just
[1:20:18] threw the book in the fire. He said, "Of
[1:20:20] course not." He said, "We're not to ask
[1:20:22] God, Amen. We're not We don't try to
[1:20:25] change God or change his will. We ask
[1:20:27] him to change us to fit his will."
[1:20:30] Now, that's hard for us to understand,
[1:20:35] but it's it's good word. Amen.
[1:20:38] No, if I could just believe it the way
[1:20:40] he sends it. Now, if we do not if we do
[1:20:43] not take it just the way we think it is,
[1:20:44] we've built God as an idol. He's got to
[1:20:46] answer according to our ways or it's no
[1:20:49] good. And we say he didn't answer us.
[1:20:52] But God answers in many ways. He answers
[1:20:55] in peculiar ways and everything is odd.
[1:20:59] That's the message, the unchangeable
[1:21:01] God, 1960.
[1:21:04] I I want to point to a couple places in
[1:21:07] scripture just to bring your mind to
[1:21:09] this that you might understand. Um,
[1:21:14] Brother Brandham says, "When we get in
[1:21:15] pressure and trials, we do things we
[1:21:19] wouldn't do otherwise."
[1:21:21] How many's ever done that?
[1:21:24] It's just getting more honest as we go
[1:21:26] along. This is awesome. I better raise
[1:21:29] mine.
[1:21:31] Amen. So there's an excess pressure
[1:21:33] built up today. I believe before I go
[1:21:36] any further, I might say this. I believe
[1:21:37] it's the enemy coming down and pressing.
[1:21:39] I believe it's the devil. And and we
[1:21:41] know the coming of the Lord is at hand.
[1:21:43] And the Bible said in the last days, the
[1:21:44] devil would go about like a roaring
[1:21:46] line. And if he could get you under
[1:21:47] pressure, hurrying and running over
[1:21:50] something, you'll make decisions you
[1:21:53] wouldn't make if you would sit down and
[1:21:56] think it over. But that's what the devil
[1:21:58] wants you to do. That's true. He wants
[1:22:00] you to get mad, make a decision why
[1:22:02] you're mad. He wants you to get hurt,
[1:22:04] make a decision while you're hurt.
[1:22:08] You get hurt in a church, so you leave
[1:22:10] the church to go to another one. What do
[1:22:11] you do? You just carried all that time
[1:22:13] bomb right over to the next church.
[1:22:17] Amen. Cuz you're making decisions where
[1:22:19] the devil wants you to make them and not
[1:22:21] where God wants you to make them. Amen.
[1:22:24] in uh in um
[1:22:27] uh the scripture tells
[1:22:29] us over in 1st Samuel 27 verse one it
[1:22:34] says David said in my heart I shall now
[1:22:37] perish one day by the hand of Saul there
[1:22:39] is nothing better for
[1:22:41] me than I should speedily escape into
[1:22:44] the land of the Philistines and Saul
[1:22:45] shall despair me to seek me anymore in
[1:22:48] the coast of Israel so I shall escape
[1:22:50] out of his hand and David arose and he
[1:22:52] passed over with the 600 men that were
[1:22:53] with him unto Akish, the son of Mok,
[1:22:56] king of Gath. And David dwelt with Akish
[1:22:58] at Gath. He and his men, every man with
[1:23:00] his household, even David with his two
[1:23:02] wives. Pay attention to these two wives.
[1:23:04] Henam the Jezraelitis and Abigail the
[1:23:07] Carmelitis. Nabal's wife. You You see
[1:23:08] that? I read those fast because I wasn't
[1:23:10] exactly sure if I was pronouncing them
[1:23:13] right. But anyway, they're there. You
[1:23:15] can read it. I I've heard preachers say,
[1:23:17] he says, you see that word right there.
[1:23:19] Amen. So, Amen. But I want you to see
[1:23:22] what did David say under pressure in his
[1:23:25] heart. He never asked God.
[1:23:29] He said in his heart,
[1:23:31] I will now one day perish under the hand
[1:23:34] of Saul. Yet this is the same David who
[1:23:37] was anointed by the prophet under a
[1:23:39] prophet's m anointed to be king. And the
[1:23:41] prophet said it was a type of the Holy
[1:23:43] Ghost being poured out upon him. And it
[1:23:46] wasn't just a little squirt. It was
[1:23:47] liberally poured upon him. Because God
[1:23:49] doesn't do anything halfway. And he
[1:23:52] said, "And when he was anointed, he was
[1:23:54] right there positionally placed as
[1:23:57] king." He wasn't sitting on the throne,
[1:23:59] but he was king in God's eyes.
[1:24:04] Amen. He said, "It's the same way with
[1:24:05] you. You were elected. You were called.
[1:24:07] You were filled with the Holy Ghost. You
[1:24:09] were placed right there in God's eyes."
[1:24:13] But here's this same David. Pressure has
[1:24:16] been on him so long. Caught between two
[1:24:17] fires. He thinks, "Amen. He's killed
[1:24:21] Goliath. Now he's going to go live where
[1:24:23] Goliath did."
[1:24:27] And that's the way people get under
[1:24:28] pressure. You had a testimony and then
[1:24:31] all of a sudden pressure comes and you
[1:24:33] start running around. Next thing you
[1:24:35] know, you're right back where that enemy
[1:24:36] you killed lives.
[1:24:39] You're not in the land of promise.
[1:24:41] You're down in the Philistines cuz you
[1:24:43] said in your heart, "I'm not going to
[1:24:45] make it." Amen.
[1:24:48] How many of us have done that? We become
[1:24:50] discouraged. We start making decisions
[1:24:52] under that discouragement. Well, I give
[1:24:54] up. I I just give up. And and then
[1:24:56] everything starts creeping in. Yeah.
[1:24:59] Bible says he took those two wives down.
[1:25:01] And listen, he moved his family totally
[1:25:04] out of the land of Israel where God is
[1:25:07] and where the promise is and moved it
[1:25:09] down to a kingdom of idols and devil
[1:25:11] worship.
[1:25:16] And we're going to we're going to
[1:25:17] survive here. And and and where he once
[1:25:19] was killing Philistines and killing
[1:25:21] champions, he's now become a chamberlain
[1:25:25] for Akish. Just let me fight for
[1:25:29] you. And David because he was covering
[1:25:32] up sin. And then this period of time
[1:25:34] that he will he will be with Akish and
[1:25:36] and live in Ziglag. When Akish gives him
[1:25:39] Ziglag, he won't write one psalm.
[1:25:43] God doesn't say a thing to him.
[1:25:49] Brother Danny, you know where I'm at
[1:25:50] this morning is not a zip of in
[1:25:52] inspiration. Well, where you at?
[1:25:57] You see, but but when I was in the
[1:25:58] promise, I wasn't feeling good. Join the
[1:26:00] team.
[1:26:04] I didn't have my joy when I was in the
[1:26:06] land of promise. Well, join the team.
[1:26:08] God is going to allow things to strike
[1:26:11] you. Amen. Because a Christian is not a
[1:26:14] bubble dancer. A Christian is a one who
[1:26:17] has endurance and has perseverance. And
[1:26:20] a Christian is one who doesn't give up.
[1:26:22] Amen. When the chips get down, they
[1:26:24] don't get down with it. They get back
[1:26:26] up. When they get knocked down, they get
[1:26:28] back up. You say, "Well, that's so
[1:26:30] simple, Brother Danny." Well, then do
[1:26:36] it. that we come into a place we don't
[1:26:39] have no strength. Amen. To deal with one
[1:26:41] another, forgive one another. We carry
[1:26:43] grudges, carry depression, walk around.
[1:26:45] Are we slaves of the enemy?
[1:26:49] Well, I killed Goliath before. Why am I
[1:26:51] going to go live in his house?
[1:26:58] But that's where David, the anointed
[1:26:59] king, the giant killer,
[1:27:05] taking his wives. I guess we're just
[1:27:06] going to have to live this way. I'll
[1:27:09] still go fight.
[1:27:12] You know, he tells lie after lie while
[1:27:15] he's there. He goes out and he kills the
[1:27:16] Gersianites or whoever they are. Brother
[1:27:18] Donnie, your memor is better than mine.
[1:27:19] You can tell them later,
[1:27:22] right? And and these the people he's
[1:27:24] killing are allies of the Philistines.
[1:27:26] And he's killing their
[1:27:28] allies. And to make sure that they can't
[1:27:31] send word back, he kills them all.
[1:27:34] He kills men, women, children. He kills
[1:27:36] everything so they can't carry word
[1:27:37] back. And then he goes back and tells,
[1:27:38] "I've been fighting Jews."
[1:27:41] So, he's lying. He's hiding things in
[1:27:43] his life. He's deceitful. And he's the
[1:27:46] anointed king. Oh my.
[1:27:50] And it gets so close in his life that
[1:27:52] they're going to fight a great
[1:27:55] battle with Saul. And David said, "I'll
[1:27:58] go." Have we got to the point we got so
[1:28:01] discouraged that we think it's doing God
[1:28:03] a service to kill one another of the
[1:28:06] household of faith? If I can just ruin
[1:28:08] your reputation, if I can just We've got
[1:28:10] real good at putting labels on one
[1:28:12] another.
[1:28:15] Well, this guy here, he's this and this
[1:28:17] guy here, he's that. You know what? When
[1:28:18] I go in the soup aisle and I look on
[1:28:20] there says tomato, I don't go look
[1:28:22] behind the label.
[1:28:24] And if you call one another's names, I
[1:28:26] say, "Well, that's what they are.
[1:28:30] That's not fair.
[1:28:34] We find ourselves acting like
[1:28:37] denominations because Amen. we get
[1:28:40] discouraged and we run over into another
[1:28:43] land, a place we've been delivered from,
[1:28:46] a place who God desires. You don't live
[1:28:48] under their rule, they live under yours.
[1:28:50] Amen.
[1:28:51] [Applause]
[1:28:54] Amen. And come to a point and Achus
[1:28:57] says, "We're going to go. We're gonna go
[1:28:58] fight the Philistines. And David says,
[1:29:01] "I'm sorry. We're gonna Yeah. Well,
[1:29:02] that's good." Yeah. Brother Donnie will
[1:29:04] correct
[1:29:05] me. We're gonna go. Just look at me and
[1:29:08] say, "Pray for Brother Danny."
[1:29:12] Amen. And and and and David says, "Just
[1:29:15] let me go with you and I'll fight
[1:29:17] Israel." The one who's been born to lead
[1:29:20] him
[1:29:21] now wants to kill him. He has got so
[1:29:27] discouraged. God intervened. Now, God
[1:29:29] hadn't spoken to
[1:29:31] him. He ain't want wrote one song. I can
[1:29:35] promise you David was not down in in in
[1:29:37] gas singing, "Ah, can't you see why I'm
[1:29:43] happy? I have left the promised word.
[1:29:50] It's better for me here now. Right, hun?
[1:29:57] He didn't write one thing.
[1:30:01] He's lying. And he's ready to go to war
[1:30:04] with his own people.
[1:30:06] And God intervenes through a heathen
[1:30:08] king and the distrust of his men said
[1:30:12] that I don't think it's a good idea cuz
[1:30:14] we're in that battle. That guy might
[1:30:16] turn on us. Yeah, better send him back
[1:30:18] to Ziglag. But he, David, didn't know
[1:30:20] all of his deceit was getting him ready
[1:30:22] for a big blow,
[1:30:25] a big trial,
[1:30:27] he was going to have a huge trial and he
[1:30:29] didn't know it was already happening.
[1:30:31] And he didn't know it was God.
[1:30:35] So he goes back to
[1:30:43] Ziglag. Blessed are they that mourn.
[1:30:48] for they shall be
[1:30:52] comforted. He goes back to
[1:30:56] Ziglag and when he comes there he finds
[1:30:59] out the Amalachites have
[1:31:02] come and burnt his city with fire and
[1:31:06] taken everything.
[1:31:10] Took the men's wives. And it
[1:31:12] specifically
[1:31:15] says that the people and David that were
[1:31:18] with him lifted up their voice and
[1:31:22] wept till they had no more power to
[1:31:26] weep. They
[1:31:29] mourned. They
[1:31:31] wailed. That word weep in the Hebrew
[1:31:34] means they bewailed with tears. These
[1:31:38] are
[1:31:40] warriors crying,
[1:31:43] screaming cuz they've lost
[1:31:48] everything. It mean they meant they
[1:31:51] complained and they made lamentations.
[1:31:54] And as you can see, it's very
[1:31:57] intense until they're totally drained
[1:32:00] and they can't weep anymore. And now
[1:32:02] they got a choice to make.
[1:32:04] You know what the scripture says
[1:32:08] again? His two wives were taken
[1:32:10] captives. Here they're mentioned again.
[1:32:12] A
[1:32:14] henm and
[1:32:15] Abigail. I think when God puts things
[1:32:18] down, you need to pay attention to him.
[1:32:21] Cuz God is saying
[1:32:23] something. And the Bible says David was
[1:32:25] greatly distressed for the people spake
[1:32:28] of stoning him. He's not hearing from
[1:32:30] God, but he's sure hearing from his
[1:32:32] people. Amen.
[1:32:34] You're the one that brought us here.
[1:32:37] You're the one that brought us to this
[1:32:38] point where we have lost everything. We
[1:32:41] have followed you faithfully. We believe
[1:32:42] the anointing is on you. And you led us
[1:32:44] into a cursed place and accepted gifts
[1:32:48] from kings. You have sworn to kill.
[1:32:51] And now you are dealing. You have taken
[1:32:54] as a gift Ziglag. Amen. Which is
[1:32:57] actually part of Judea or where the
[1:32:59] Judeian kings would stay. But it was he
[1:33:01] who gave it to you.
[1:33:07] And now we've lost everything because we
[1:33:09] followed you. What do you think guys?
[1:33:11] Should we stone him?
[1:33:16] Now if you go research the name aim and
[1:33:19] I just want to say this and and and it
[1:33:22] means in the surface it means brother of
[1:33:26] pleasantness. Isn't that a nice name to
[1:33:27] name your daughter?
[1:33:31] But that's the first part of her name.
[1:33:32] It's you take the ancient Hebrew and it
[1:33:35] takes the first part of her name and it
[1:33:37] means a strong wall. And if you take the
[1:33:39] second part of her name, Noam, it means
[1:33:41] agreeableness and
[1:33:44] grace. Strong wall of grace.
[1:33:48] And if you take Abigail, it means amen.
[1:33:51] Her name means father. That is your
[1:33:54] source. Father of joy. Source of joy.
[1:33:57] David has lost in that time grace and
[1:34:01] joy. Brother Bannam said, "What Satan
[1:34:03] tries to knock out of the church is the
[1:34:05] true message of grace."
[1:34:12] And when you're at that point of being
[1:34:13] killed and
[1:34:14] stoned, where's grace then?
[1:34:18] And maybe somebody's in a tight spot
[1:34:20] this morning. Well, I tell you, David
[1:34:22] said, "I don't have nothing else to
[1:34:25] do but seek God."
[1:34:28] And he turned to the priest. This is the
[1:34:30] first time we read of David turning to
[1:34:32] the pe priest when he's in this
[1:34:34] condition. He was down in Gath. He was
[1:34:36] down there with for 16 months. And then
[1:34:39] however long he's in Ziglag, he's he's
[1:34:41] in the land of the Philistines for 16
[1:34:42] months and then he comes to Ziglag. And
[1:34:44] he's in this condition. We don't hear a
[1:34:46] word of him asking the priest anything.
[1:34:49] I want to ask you, why do you allow the
[1:34:50] situation just to go on and on and on
[1:34:54] without seeking help?
[1:34:57] But he asked for the ephod. Bring the
[1:34:59] heod. And he and he
[1:35:03] asked, you know, you think God would be
[1:35:08] offended. What kind of God do we have,
[1:35:10] brother Donnie? That when David would
[1:35:11] ask, God would answer right
[1:35:13] back. Why didn't God tell him? You know
[1:35:16] what? You're backslid, boy.
[1:35:20] you're backsliding. Let me just take you
[1:35:22] out to the woodshed a little bit and
[1:35:24] just beat you up because I want you to
[1:35:25] know you haven't lived for me the way
[1:35:27] you ought to.
[1:35:29] But you know what David asked? He said,
[1:35:31] "Should I
[1:35:32] go after them?"
[1:35:38] You know what God said?
[1:35:40] God says, "You're not good enough. I've
[1:35:42] already chosen someone else. I'm going
[1:35:45] to get someone else to do the job.
[1:35:46] You're not good. You've been over here
[1:35:47] in this bad city condition. you're not
[1:35:48] good enough. But you know what God said?
[1:35:50] He said go. But God just don't tell you
[1:35:53] to go. He gives you a promise.
[1:35:58] And so I'm sorry. David asked, "Should I
[1:36:01] pursue?" And God says, "Pursue
[1:36:04] and you recover."
[1:36:07] I'm going to go after grace.
[1:36:10] I'm going to go after joy.
[1:36:15] Oh, Satan may have took it out. I might
[1:36:16] have been in a dry place, but I'm going
[1:36:18] to go after it this morning. But I want
[1:36:21] to tell you, you will never get from God
[1:36:23] you're never possessed, which you're
[1:36:25] unwilling to pursue.
[1:36:29] You want to just sit in your seat and do
[1:36:30] nothing about it. Well, I'll just sit
[1:36:32] there and hope he does something. No,
[1:36:33] no. You got to go ask him, should I go
[1:36:35] out? Is it a promise in your word that I
[1:36:37] should receive the Holy Ghost? Is it a
[1:36:39] promise in your word that your grace is
[1:36:41] still for me? Is it promised in your
[1:36:44] learn that joy is part of my
[1:36:45] inheritance?
[1:36:50] Go. Now, that don't mean God made it
[1:36:53] easy. They had to go after him and men
[1:36:55] got tired, gave up, and said, "We're too
[1:36:57] tired to go." Amen. We're going to stay
[1:36:59] here. So, half of them stayed there. The
[1:37:01] others that the Bible calls sons of Bile
[1:37:03] said, "Well, well, we're not going to
[1:37:05] give them any of the spoils."
[1:37:07] But grace was starting to overshadow
[1:37:09] David's life now because he's now
[1:37:11] hearing from God for the first time in
[1:37:13] months.
[1:37:17] And God didn't make it easy on the
[1:37:19] journey. They don't know whether they're
[1:37:20] dead or alive. And they find an
[1:37:23] Egyptian. It's something where sometime
[1:37:26] good news has to come from
[1:37:28] or even
[1:37:30] news because remember it was the
[1:37:33] Amalachites who done that. We part
[1:37:34] preached about Jacob and Esau yesterday
[1:37:36] and and Amal and Amalachites are
[1:37:39] descended of Esau and Esau is a guy who
[1:37:42] don't don't want the the birthright. He
[1:37:44] he despises it. He rejects it and these
[1:37:46] are his descendants. That spirit just
[1:37:49] comes right down to the church.
[1:37:50] Something that despises the birthright
[1:37:52] and tries to destroy the heritage of it.
[1:37:56] And here they find an Egyptian laying
[1:38:00] there and they asked him
[1:38:04] uh some
[1:38:07] questions and he began to give him
[1:38:09] information and he says my master was a
[1:38:11] Malachite and he said I got too tired
[1:38:13] and I I I I couldn't go any further so
[1:38:15] he just left me here. You see
[1:38:18] Amalachite will use you as long as
[1:38:20] you're useful. You get too tired, he'll
[1:38:22] just leave you. That's right. That's
[1:38:24] right.
[1:38:26] Huh? You think your friends in the world
[1:38:29] are really your friends? They're leave
[1:38:31] you when there's no more use for you.
[1:38:33] That's right. But here's a David now
[1:38:36] who's being now he can feel that
[1:38:37] inspiration coming back. Amen. Should I
[1:38:40] pursue and he's gone. I'm not going to
[1:38:42] leave my family behind. I'm going to go
[1:38:44] after him. And the Bible says they went
[1:38:45] after him. And you know what? He
[1:38:47] recovered all. I think it's wonderful
[1:38:49] that God, Amen, was always there just
[1:38:52] waiting to be asked.
[1:38:57] That's good.
[1:39:00] That's real grace. Amen. Grace never
[1:39:03] left you. You didn't feel
[1:39:06] him. You were out of contact with him,
[1:39:09] but when you sought him, he answered.
[1:39:16] That should produce humility.
[1:39:20] He was there all the
[1:39:22] time. Amen.
[1:39:26] Friends, we become people of such
[1:39:28] surface relationships. We only judge by
[1:39:31] surface things. We quickly leave one
[1:39:33] thing and go find another. We judge one
[1:39:35] another by surface. We judge. That's how
[1:39:37] the message is being judged. They just
[1:39:39] throw a quote out here, throw a quote
[1:39:40] out there. Oh, it's wrong. You better
[1:39:42] leave that. You better leave this.
[1:39:46] Do you think the scripture says, "Search
[1:39:47] the internet, for in them you think you
[1:39:49] have eternal life." Come on.
[1:39:52] Come on. Do you think the internet you
[1:39:54] think the Bible says believe the sign
[1:39:56] and No. The Bible doesn't say it search
[1:39:59] the scripture for in them you think you
[1:40:01] have eternal life and they are they that
[1:40:02] testify of me. Amen. Don't you go
[1:40:05] looking for the Amalachites to vindicate
[1:40:06] the word. Amen. The word vindicates the
[1:40:09] word.
[1:40:14] I I Amen.
[1:40:17] I set a timer. I got five minutes.
[1:40:21] Amen. I come out of a Menite
[1:40:24] background. My dad's side. All my family
[1:40:26] Menite. And I remember one day my cousin
[1:40:29] come to me. He goes, "Hey, Danny." He
[1:40:32] said, "Are you still preaching?" I said,
[1:40:33] "Yeah, I'm preaching." He goes, I said,
[1:40:35] "Why do you ask?" He goes, "Are you
[1:40:37] preaching what that Brandon preaches?" I
[1:40:38] said, "Yeah, I'm preaching what that
[1:40:39] Brandon preaches." I says, "Why do you
[1:40:40] ask?" He says, "Well, I just want to
[1:40:42] know." He said, "Because he went."
[1:40:45] I said, "What do you mean?" He said,
[1:40:46] "Well, he went to hell.
[1:40:49] Wow. I said, "You said, "Brother Brandon
[1:40:50] went to hell." And and he said, "Yeah,
[1:40:52] he went." I said, "Well, how do you know
[1:40:53] that?"
[1:40:55] He goes, I said, "I want to tell you
[1:40:57] something." I said, "I want to ask you a
[1:40:59] question. How much do you know about his
[1:41:01] message?" I said, "Have you read
[1:41:03] anything that he has said?"
[1:41:05] He goes, "Well, no." He said, "I
[1:41:06] haven't." But I said, "My dad read one
[1:41:08] book and says it's no good." I said,
[1:41:09] "So, because of one book, you said that
[1:41:11] man's gone to hell. That's good,
[1:41:13] brother." I said, "I want to tell you
[1:41:15] something." I said, "Jimmy," I said, "I
[1:41:18] want to tell you something. I I said,
[1:41:19] I'm" and I I I wasn't mad in an angry
[1:41:22] way,
[1:41:23] whatever that means,
[1:41:30] but I hate when we we think we know
[1:41:33] something.
[1:41:35] Amen. And and I said, I want to prove to
[1:41:36] you. I says, "You don't believe your
[1:41:38] Bible. You only believe what your church
[1:41:40] tells you." He goes, "Well, that ain't
[1:41:41] the truth." Well, man, I used to be a
[1:41:42] man. I know what good trinitarians are.
[1:41:46] I said I said, "Who do you think made
[1:41:49] the earth we're on?" He goes, "Well, God
[1:41:50] did." I said, "But do you know he said
[1:41:52] Jesus did?"
[1:41:55] He goes, "Well, that ain't true." I
[1:41:56] said, "See, you don't believe the
[1:41:58] Bible."
[1:41:59] That's right.
[1:42:02] He made all things and by him all things
[1:42:04] consist.
[1:42:07] Now, I didn't have to explain that. Just
[1:42:09] I just told him that, you know. So, he
[1:42:11] got mad. I said, "Jimmy, you can't you
[1:42:12] don't have a right to get mad. You're
[1:42:13] the one that started it.
[1:42:17] But I said, I never said you were going
[1:42:18] to hell, but you said that man's gone to
[1:42:20] hell, and you hadn't read one thing
[1:42:21] about him. And that's the laziness of
[1:42:23] this age. We believe a friend. We're
[1:42:26] believe a website, but we won't have the
[1:42:28] guts to go in the word and start
[1:42:30] studying what it says about it. If
[1:42:32] there's something in you, if there's
[1:42:34] even a deep call to the deep, amen, the
[1:42:37] ephod will still answer back.
[1:42:40] You better pursue after your soul.
[1:42:45] Amen.
[1:42:47] Or there's nothing there to receive it.
[1:42:50] I say, God, by your grace, you put
[1:42:52] something in me that loves the message.
[1:42:53] I don't understand everything about it.
[1:42:55] And I'm not the most gifted, Amen. guy
[1:42:58] that can stand up and just explain
[1:42:59] everything about it. Amen. But there's
[1:43:01] something in me. Amen. You can try to
[1:43:03] explain it away and I might look at what
[1:43:04] you say. Well, I don't really understand
[1:43:05] what you mean, but I know this. I know
[1:43:07] what called me. I know what it did for
[1:43:09] my family. I know what it did in my
[1:43:11] life. And I want to know this. Nothing
[1:43:13] happened in the Menite church. Nothing
[1:43:15] happened anywhere else but God rich in
[1:43:17] mercy. Amen.
[1:43:22] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:43:29] Amen. Brother Jackie, it's worth it.
[1:43:36] I've quit. I'm just talking now.
[1:43:40] I just want to tell you young people, I
[1:43:41] just want to say this. this works.
[1:43:45] If you will open up open up the message
[1:43:47] and go into the go into uh uh 1964
[1:43:50] question answers. My grandmother asked
[1:43:51] brother Brandon a question said I have
[1:43:53] two daughters married to men and
[1:43:54] denominations. They've received
[1:43:55] opposition. What should they do? Brother
[1:43:57] Bam said just stand fast, show your
[1:43:59] colors. I don't say go with them and and
[1:44:01] and fellowship with them. He says cuz
[1:44:02] you know when it comes to fellowship a
[1:44:04] dove can't eat with a buzzard. He called
[1:44:06] my dad a buzzard. You know my dad went
[1:44:08] to one of brother Brandham's messages.
[1:44:10] It was called How can I overcome? My mom
[1:44:13] my mom took him there and my dad being a
[1:44:15] good Menite did what he does did in the
[1:44:17] Menite church. He sat on the back row
[1:44:18] and he slept the whole time. So he he
[1:44:21] sat and how can I overcome and why
[1:44:23] brother Brandon is preaching about a
[1:44:24] lily. Amen. Pushing through the mud and
[1:44:27] expressing his glory. He's back there.
[1:44:30] Don't remember a word of
[1:44:34] it. Amen. I had a grandfather who could
[1:44:37] quote to you book after book after book.
[1:44:39] Amen. of of of scripture. He wasn't a
[1:44:41] preacher, they'd stand him up and he
[1:44:43] would quote the entire book of Psalms.
[1:44:45] Oh, isn't this great? Isn't this great?
[1:44:46] He he and I remember one day as a young
[1:44:48] man asked, he said, "Grandpa," I said,
[1:44:50] "Do you do you know what Revelations
[1:44:51] 10:7 says?" And he, "Uh uh, no, I
[1:44:54] don't." Said, "Do you know what Malachi
[1:44:55] 4:5 says?" Uh, no. Uh, I don't believe I
[1:44:59] do. You see, because memoration memor
[1:45:01] memorizing something is not revelation.
[1:45:04] You know, if I set Jesus Christ right
[1:45:05] here and the devil right here, both of
[1:45:07] them would know the word just the same.
[1:45:10] The devil knows the word just as good as
[1:45:12] Jesus Christ does. But brother Bam said,
[1:45:14] "You know what the difference between
[1:45:16] the devil and Jesus was? The devil knew
[1:45:18] it by intellects. Jesus knew it by
[1:45:21] experience."
[1:45:25] Hallelujah. It's not good enough to
[1:45:27] throw your quotes out there and condemn
[1:45:30] one another. We must know him in the
[1:45:32] power of his
[1:45:39] resurrection. My dad took my mother all
[1:45:42] over the country trying to get her out
[1:45:43] of the message. Brother Bam D said he
[1:45:45] said, "Praise the Lord, it's all over."
[1:45:46] And he took her back home, found out it
[1:45:47] just got started.
[1:45:50] Amen. And he moved her to Florida, moved
[1:45:52] her to California, bought land in New
[1:45:54] Mexico, but moved her all over the place
[1:45:56] trying to get her out. 10 years of my
[1:45:58] mother gone by herself. And I tell you
[1:45:59] what, we need more people that have
[1:46:01] sacrificed something. Amen. To realize
[1:46:04] what this message means. If you just sit
[1:46:06] here and don't give anything, you don't
[1:46:08] give any effort, you don't know what
[1:46:09] it's worth. It was not cheap to bring
[1:46:12] this message to us.
[1:46:17] It meant something. It meant giving up
[1:46:19] things. It meant our
[1:46:23] life. You know, I keep the letter of my
[1:46:25] mother in my Bible. my other
[1:46:28] one where she was writing someone else
[1:46:31] and encouraging them because their
[1:46:33] husband didn't
[1:46:34] believe and she was talking about how
[1:46:36] weak she was and how many fears she had
[1:46:40] and how she was encouraged by her family
[1:46:42] to leave her
[1:46:44] husband and she
[1:46:46] said I just kept going one day at a time
[1:46:49] I was scared I didn't know this was just
[1:46:51] a 22 year old girl
[1:46:53] being pulled all over the
[1:46:55] country but there had Then something
[1:46:57] said just stand fast, show your
[1:47:00] colors. 10 years later after brother
[1:47:03] Benham said that as I was talking with
[1:47:04] brother JD back in the office, he was
[1:47:06] Vietnam vet. My my uncle was a Vietnam
[1:47:08] vet. He come back. He he was a a hippie.
[1:47:11] Drugs all his life was messed up. But
[1:47:13] then God converted him.
[1:47:18] My mom asked dad, "Can I go? Can I go to
[1:47:22] the baptism?" My My dad says, "I tell
[1:47:24] you what, said you go." He said, "But
[1:47:26] you come back." He said, "I'm gone. The
[1:47:28] kids are gone. I'm finished with it."
[1:47:29] Cuz he would kick her out of the house,
[1:47:30] throw her clothes out, send her back
[1:47:32] home. He did everything he could.
[1:47:33] Thought he was doing something for the
[1:47:37] Lord, being a good
[1:47:39] Menite, and he wasn't a good one
[1:47:43] himself. Amen. My mother, not a
[1:47:47] particularly strong person. She just
[1:47:48] said, "Well, I'm going to go." You know,
[1:47:51] brother Donnie, if I was like many
[1:47:54] people are anymore, I mean, I should be
[1:47:56] offended that my mother was willing to
[1:47:57] give me up.
[1:48:01] You know, I saw on the news some years
[1:48:03] ago where a boy over in India sued his
[1:48:04] parents for being born.
[1:48:08] We're we're I'm sorry, we're stupid.
[1:48:13] But we live in the past. Well, they you
[1:48:15] know, they they did this to me and we
[1:48:17] just live like that.
[1:48:21] But when she made her stand and and then
[1:48:23] my dad, he said later in his testimony,
[1:48:25] he said, "I didn't really mean that. I
[1:48:26] didn't want to lose my family." Amen.
[1:48:28] But I was trying to to to stop her. And
[1:48:31] when when she said, "I'm going to go
[1:48:33] anyhow, she'd done
[1:48:35] enough." You see, you just got to stand
[1:48:39] because there's a promise. Should I
[1:48:42] pursue? Yeah. Amen. Amen. Pursue. And
[1:48:47] I'll give a promise with it. You're not
[1:48:49] running in vain. Amen. You will recover
[1:48:53] everything.
[1:48:54] [Music]
[1:48:57] Oh, the devil's a liar, church. He tries
[1:48:59] to lie on you and tell you.
[1:49:04] Amen. I was telling brother Donnie, but
[1:49:05] I hope this is okay. When my daddy was
[1:49:06] dying and he's laying in the hospital
[1:49:08] and I'm I'm there about 4 in the morning
[1:49:10] and my dad had confessed. He said, "I'm
[1:49:11] going to I'll come back and finish his
[1:49:13] testimony." He he confessed he was going
[1:49:14] to be healed and and everything and and
[1:49:16] he he believed he was and and go back
[1:49:18] and pastor the church. And I'm I'm
[1:49:20] sitting there and the devil moved up
[1:49:21] because he's he's dying. He's suffering.
[1:49:24] And the devil moved up and said he
[1:49:26] preached and he did all of this and he
[1:49:28] you know you know this message isn't
[1:49:30] really true. You know what he stood for
[1:49:31] is not really true. And that fear came
[1:49:34] in me on me like a flood about four
[1:49:36] o'clock in the morning. That's when that
[1:49:37] stuff kind of usually happens. Don't
[1:49:39] usually happen four o'clock in the
[1:49:40] afternoon. Yeah.
[1:49:42] And it was about that time God spoke to
[1:49:44] me and I said, "Do I look like
[1:49:46] Longfellow?" No, I don't look like Long
[1:49:47] Fella. God gave Danny a poem. I didn't
[1:49:49] give it to you. All right? He just gave
[1:49:50] it to me. And I'm not going to tell you
[1:49:51] the whole thing. But what he said was,
[1:49:53] "Amen. This man has fallen, but he's
[1:49:55] only fallen asleep."
[1:50:01] He said, "And he'll rise soon enough."
[1:50:05] He said, "Satan has lost another one."
[1:50:08] Amen.
[1:50:10] You knew see Satan didn't win this
[1:50:11] battle.
[1:50:15] Hallelujah.
[1:50:17] So, amen. Let me go back. When my mother
[1:50:19] stood and said, "I'm going to go." And
[1:50:21] then my dad said he put his hands up,
[1:50:23] began to walk around and cry a little
[1:50:24] bit. You know, that's what good menite.
[1:50:26] I'm sorry, Menites. I didn't mean that.
[1:50:27] Amen. And and so he he said, "I was
[1:50:29] crying a little bit." And then God just
[1:50:31] dropped down in the kitchen. He didn't
[1:50:32] begin to run and shout. He just turned
[1:50:34] around said, "I'll take you." G.
[1:50:38] And my dad showed up at my uncle's
[1:50:40] baptism and everybody got scared because
[1:50:42] he'd been trying to break up their
[1:50:43] meetings and they thought he came to
[1:50:45] break up the baptism. And my daddy
[1:50:49] walked over to my uncle Sam and he put
[1:50:50] his hand out and says, "God bless you,
[1:50:52] Sam." It was just like
[1:50:56] that. And you want to tell me there's no
[1:50:59] power in this?
[1:51:02] My daddy would take me to church. I
[1:51:04] remember sitting beside him in a car
[1:51:05] freezing in Ohio and the door would not
[1:51:06] even be able to shut cuz it's so cold.
[1:51:08] He's taking me to church and he say now
[1:51:09] he said no don't you believe what your
[1:51:11] mama believes she's in a cult. So what
[1:51:13] do you who do you think I listen to?
[1:51:16] Daddy or mama?
[1:51:18] Who had more power in their testimony?
[1:51:20] All right.
[1:51:22] You don't think it'd make effect on me
[1:51:23] when I saw a man who would act the way
[1:51:26] he would and turn just in a moment that
[1:51:28] God Amen. would step down onto the
[1:51:30] scene. Okay, you stood long enough. It's
[1:51:33] been 10 years. Now let me do the work.
[1:51:36] If you
[1:51:38] pursue Amen. You will
[1:51:43] recover. That's my God. I said that's my
[1:51:47] God. If he could do it then, he's got to
[1:51:50] do it now.
[1:51:52] If he could save then, he's got to save
[1:51:54] now.
[1:51:59] Oh, I love him. Don't you love him?
[1:52:02] Sorry to hold you so long. You're such a
[1:52:03] good group to preach to. We love you
[1:52:05] with the love of the Lord. Stand with
[1:52:07] me.
[1:52:09] Amen.
[1:52:16] Amen. I'm so thankful for the word. I'm
[1:52:19] so thankful for what he's given us. He's
[1:52:22] so good to us. Yes, sir. Hasn't he been
[1:52:24] good to you, Brother Harry? You guys
[1:52:27] know the song Goodness of God? Goodness
[1:52:30] of God. Yeah. Let's sing that. You want
[1:52:32] to sing that? Good.
[1:52:34] Amen. I love you, Lord, where your
[1:52:38] mercies never fail.
[1:52:42] [Music]
[1:52:44] Amen. Amen. Go ahead.
[1:52:48] I love you,
[1:52:50] Lord. Bless you, Johnny. For your mercy
[1:52:55] never failed
[1:52:58] me. And all my
[1:53:01] days I've been held in your hand.
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:07] Thank you, Lord. moment that I wake up.
[1:53:11] Oh yes. Until I lay my head,
[1:53:16] let's just worship. I will
[1:53:18] sing of the
[1:53:21] goodness of
[1:53:24] God.
[1:53:27] Hallelujah. All my life you have been
[1:53:31] faithful.
[1:53:36] All my life, you have been so so
[1:53:44] good. With every breath that I am,
[1:53:50] oh yes. Oh, I will sing. Thank you,
[1:53:53] Jesus. Of the
[1:53:55] goodness of
[1:53:59] God. I love your voice. And whatever
[1:54:02] your need is today, think of these words
[1:54:04] you've heard. You have led me through
[1:54:07] the
[1:54:09] fire in darkest night. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:54:14] You were close like no
[1:54:18] other. I've known you as a father.
[1:54:24] I've known you as a
[1:54:27] friend and I have
[1:54:30] lived in the
[1:54:32] goodness of
[1:54:37] God. All my life you have been faithful.
[1:54:47] Heat. Heat.
[1:55:02] [Music]
[1:55:05] I of the
[1:55:08] goodness. Your goodness is running after
[1:55:11] me. Oh, your goodness is running
[1:55:16] after running
[1:55:20] after. Oh,
[1:55:22] hallelujah. Maybe he's chasing you down
[1:55:25] today. His forgiveness, his mercy, his
[1:55:30] [Applause]
[1:55:38] lend. Your goodness is running after.
[1:55:42] Your is running after me.
[1:55:46] Hallelujah. Your goodness is running
[1:55:50] after. You're running after me.
[1:55:55] I go goodness is running after you. It's
[1:55:59] running after
[1:56:01] me. With my life laying down, I
[1:56:05] surrender now. I give you
[1:56:11] everything. Your goodness is running
[1:56:15] out. It's running after me.
[1:56:22] Martin Luther said, "When I look at
[1:56:26] myself, I don't see how I could be
[1:56:30] saved. But when I look at Jesus,
[1:56:34] I don't see how I could be lost."
[1:56:38] The man received an understanding of the
[1:56:40] just shall live by faith.
[1:56:45] No doubt there's many needs among us
[1:56:47] today.
[1:56:49] We want you to just lay hands on one
[1:56:51] another. If you would take a hand, put
[1:56:52] it on their shoulder. If it's a wife,
[1:56:54] you can tuck her by the hand or
[1:56:55] something like that. Family
[1:56:59] member, not only those in the visible
[1:57:01] audience, but those that have streamed
[1:57:03] the service and those that'll go back
[1:57:04] and archive it. Whatever your need is.
[1:57:07] Now, remember, you're not praying for
[1:57:08] yourself, but you're praying for that
[1:57:10] person by you. They're praying for you.
[1:57:14] Heavenly Father, as
[1:57:16] we've been so blessed these days that we
[1:57:19] can be
[1:57:21] together, I believe that we'll look back
[1:57:24] one day and when we all get up yonder
[1:57:27] and there'll be some that'll come up and
[1:57:28] tell brother Danny or brother David, you
[1:57:30] remember me? I I was at that that youth
[1:57:33] service. I I was dealing with this and
[1:57:35] that and I heard Jesus call my name.
[1:57:40] Father, as we stand here today and we
[1:57:43] are praying for one another
[1:57:45] now, we're asking for the sick, the
[1:57:49] afflicted. Lord God, we're asking for
[1:57:51] those that maybe are abound by some
[1:57:54] habit, something that seems to just
[1:57:57] constantly steal their joy and their
[1:58:00] peace. Maybe they're mourning today
[1:58:02] because of victories that are lost. and
[1:58:04] they find themselves down in Ziglag are
[1:58:07] under the domain of the king of
[1:58:10] gas, but they've got Goliath in their
[1:58:12] life. And by the grace of God, you've
[1:58:15] killed them before, but they find
[1:58:16] theirel in bondage
[1:58:18] again. Lord God, I pray in the name of
[1:58:21] Jesus Christ. May the spirit of God
[1:58:23] sweep through this building today. Lord,
[1:58:27] may you bring healing. May you bring
[1:58:29] deliverance. Father, in the name of
[1:58:32] Jesus, I pray that some of these people
[1:58:34] here today will look back and in a day
[1:58:37] or so they realize that arm that was
[1:58:39] bothering them, it ain't bothering them
[1:58:41] no more. Maybe it was lust. Maybe it's a
[1:58:44] temper. Maybe it's pornography. Lord,
[1:58:46] you know, we agree together right now
[1:58:49] and we call on the name of our mighty
[1:58:51] God, our great elabor, the great
[1:58:55] deliverer. Heavenly Father, may your
[1:58:57] presence come and minister healing,
[1:59:00] minister strength, minister to your
[1:59:03] people what they have need of today.
[1:59:05] Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ, we
[1:59:09] not only ask for it, but now we return
[1:59:12] and say, "Thank you. You are our healer.
[1:59:16] You are our deliverer. You're our El
[1:59:19] Shadi. Jehovah Gyra, Jehovah Shalom,
[1:59:23] Jehovah Titskanu. Hallelujah. The first,
[1:59:26] the last, the alpha, the omega, the
[1:59:29] beginning, and the end. I am he that was
[1:59:32] dead, but now I'm alive forever more. We
[1:59:36] worship you today, Lord God.
[1:59:40] Hallelujah. We praise your name, Father.
[1:59:43] Thank you, Lord Jesus. We worship you
[1:59:46] now, Lord. May your presence, Lord,
[1:59:49] saturate each soldier today, Father.
[1:59:53] Thank you, Lord. Thank you. We worship
[1:59:56] you, mighty God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:00:00] Can we just raise our hands now in his
[2:00:02] presence and let's just worship him
[2:00:05] together as the children of God. We were
[2:00:08] lost, but were found. We were without
[2:00:11] hope, but the God of mercy changed our
[2:00:15] lives. It seemed for many of us there
[2:00:18] would be no hope at all. No help but
[2:00:21] mercy rewrote our
[2:00:23] lives. Hallelujah. We worship you today,
[2:00:27] Lord God. We bless your holy name, Lord
[2:00:31] Jesus. Thank you, Father. Thank you,
[2:00:35] Father. Oh, we praise you,
[2:00:39] Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:00:42] Hallelujah. Oh,
[2:00:45] my God bless you, saints.
[2:00:48] I love times like this, but this is part
[2:00:52] of a special meeting I don't
[2:00:55] like of having to say
[2:00:58] goodbye. If the Lord carries and we will
[2:01:01] have another meeting here in July,
[2:01:04] there'll be people gathered from
[2:01:05] different places, but no doubt we'll
[2:01:07] never have another one quite like this
[2:01:09] one.
[2:01:11] If we gather here in July, there may be
[2:01:14] some that's gone on to the Lord and some
[2:01:16] that maybe has went through terrible
[2:01:20] things. But aren't you glad that we're
[2:01:23] living not just for another meeting,
[2:01:26] another youth
[2:01:27] rally, but we're believing that eternity
[2:01:30] is moving closer and closer. We're one
[2:01:32] meeting closer to eternity.
[2:01:36] I'd just like to say that we're so
[2:01:38] grateful for the ministry brothers that
[2:01:40] have come and prayed. And don't you
[2:01:42] appreciate men that'll study and just
[2:01:44] bring something to help the saints of
[2:01:53] God? Praise the Lord.
[2:01:57] We're so so grateful and appreciative
[2:02:00] for the church here, the deacons that
[2:02:03] helped and and all of those that uh put
[2:02:06] all the banquet together. So much went
[2:02:09] on behind the scenes, of course. We're
[2:02:11] just so thankful for each of them. Uh a
[2:02:14] lot of the preparation that took place,
[2:02:16] they were doing it weeks and weeks
[2:02:18] before. We want to say thank you for
[2:02:20] each one of those. All the decoration
[2:02:23] and the trees for those of you that was
[2:02:25] there at the banquet. It was quite
[2:02:26] something to see. And I just like to say
[2:02:29] to all the brothers and those that
[2:02:31] weren't invited to the banquet, there's
[2:02:32] many of them came afterwards and and you
[2:02:35] saw them. They was moving the mulch and
[2:02:37] the trees and the bushes and the
[2:02:38] shrubbery and all that. So, we want to
[2:02:40] say thank you to them. We just want to
[2:02:44] say how much we appreciate it. Once
[2:02:46] again, I'd like to say to our Lord
[2:02:49] Jesus, we've been in our new place here
[2:02:52] now for two years in
[2:02:57] February. And for those of you that
[2:02:59] know, some of you may not, we couldn't
[2:03:02] have a meeting like this in our old
[2:03:04] church because we didn't have room. We
[2:03:06] hadn't had a special meeting in years
[2:03:08] because we didn't have have the room to
[2:03:11] put
[2:03:12] everybody. And I just want to say once
[2:03:14] again today to the
[2:03:16] Lord to the
[2:03:19] Lord how grateful I am that he's given
[2:03:22] us this place where we could be able to
[2:03:25] meet together. And it ain't just for us.
[2:03:28] It's for meetings like this
[2:03:30] too. I just want to say to him today,
[2:03:34] thank
[2:03:35] you. Thank you.
[2:03:37] I've told our church before that for
[2:03:39] years we've been robbed of the blessing
[2:03:42] of hosting a meeting. It's a lot of
[2:03:45] work. It's a lot of stuff that goes with
[2:03:47] it. But there's such blessings. And we
[2:03:50] want to say to you visitors, thank you
[2:03:52] for coming and making this time special
[2:03:55] for
[2:03:56] us. Let's just bow our heads together.
[2:03:58] Heavenly
[2:04:00] Father, we want to just thank you, Lord.
[2:04:02] I believe this will be a hallmark
[2:04:04] meeting for the lives of
[2:04:07] many. Lord God, we know that it was
[2:04:10] directed for the most part to the youth,
[2:04:12] but I certainly don't fit in that
[2:04:15] category
[2:04:16] anymore. But I receive so much from
[2:04:19] being here, Lord. I thank
[2:04:22] you. It lets us know how much you love
[2:04:25] us and how mindful you are of us,
[2:04:27] Father.
[2:04:28] Now, as we get ready to depart and some
[2:04:31] will start driving home today and some
[2:04:33] maybe leave tomorrow, we pray that you'd
[2:04:36] watch over them and keep
[2:04:38] them. What we're longing for, Jesus, is
[2:04:41] that that
[2:04:43] morning whenever all of a sudden we'll
[2:04:46] see our loved ones appear before
[2:04:48] us and we know it won't be long, we'll
[2:04:52] be
[2:04:53] changed. and all the hardships of life
[2:04:55] and all the difficulties that we've been
[2:04:57] through and all the ridicule that we've
[2:04:59] had from those who don't
[2:05:01] understand. It'll all seem as nothing
[2:05:04] when we come to the end of the
[2:05:07] way. May there not be one of these young
[2:05:09] people missing at that day,
[2:05:12] Jesus. Father, may each of us that have
[2:05:14] been touched by your presence here these
[2:05:16] days we've had together be living
[2:05:19] testimonies. No doubt there's people
[2:05:22] alive today that are here that will be
[2:05:25] alive when the rapture takes place. May
[2:05:28] we be faithful. Strengthen us. Give us
[2:05:32] what we have need of Lord as we go from
[2:05:35] this place we ask in the name of
[2:05:38] Jesus. And the saints of God said amen.
[2:05:43] Saints of
[2:05:44] divorce. How many can say it's been good
[2:05:46] to be here. Would you just
[2:05:57] Would you mind just doing one more thing
[2:06:00] before we go? Just turn around and shake
[2:06:02] hands with a few people there with you.
[2:06:03] Just tell them it's good to see you
[2:06:04] today. It's been good to be
[2:06:07] here.
[2:06:11] Amen. Want to say how much we appreciate
[2:06:14] all the musicians as well and all the
[2:06:16] special songs, the practice and all that
[2:06:18] they done. Thank you each of you, the
[2:06:20] sisters that helped with the food and
[2:06:22] served and all of that. I I don't want
[2:06:24] to leave anybody out. Just want you to
[2:06:25] know that we do appreciate it with all
[2:06:27] of our hearts. Until we meet again, may
[2:06:30] God be with you and keep you by his
[2:06:32] grace. And if we don't meet again in
[2:06:34] this life, we'll see you over yonder.
[2:06:40] Brother Rob. All right. Lunch be ready
[2:06:42] for the youth 13 and up. So don't forget
