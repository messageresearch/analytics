[31:34] place if not for
[31:40] [Music]
[31:50] Grace praise the Lord how many knows
[31:53] that is so true
[31:55] tonight if it wasn't for Gra
[31:58] gra let's um turn to the book of 1
[32:02] Corinthians if you would chapter
[32:04] 12 verse
[32:09] 12 let's look at a little bit about this
[32:13] grace shall
[32:14] we 1 Corinthians
[32:19] 12:12 for as the body is one and has
[32:23] many
[32:25] members and all the members of that one
[32:28] body being many are one
[32:34] body so
[32:36] also is
[32:38] Christ now I don't want to shock you
[32:41] just coming out of the
[32:43] gate
[32:44] but I want you to look at this with me
[32:49] and so also those four words so also is
[32:56] Christ
[32:57] if you notice Paul doesn't say so also
[33:01] is
[33:03] Jesus but
[33:06] Christ in this verse he's talking about
[33:09] the body of
[33:12] course and he's talking about the body
[33:16] being with many members and also talking
[33:18] about the mystical body and as strange
[33:21] as it may seem to you Paul is actually
[33:25] calling the true
[33:27] Church
[33:32] Christ you see why that stumbles people
[33:34] is because they're identifying the
[33:38] humanity of the Lord Jesus as being
[33:41] Christ but Christos actually means the
[33:45] anointed
[33:47] one so when he went up into heaven then
[33:51] his church became his anointed
[33:54] one
[33:55] so he says he says being many are one
[33:59] body so also is Christ which is the
[34:05] mystical
[34:07] Christ the
[34:10] church he is the
[34:12] savior of his own body look with me in
[34:15] Ephesians
[34:17] 5:23 for the husband is the head of the
[34:20] wife even as Christ is the head of the
[34:24] church he is the savior
[34:28] of the body the savior of the
[34:33] body he actually accounts
[34:36] himself as not being
[34:39] complete without his
[34:43] church I think you're doing good think
[34:45] think with me he accounts himself as not
[34:49] being
[34:50] complete without his church Ephesians
[34:55] 1:23
[34:57] which is his
[35:00] body the fullness of him that filth all
[35:06] in
[35:07] all so the fullness of him the way he
[35:11] looks at it is the church the fullness
[35:15] of him that filth all and all because
[35:19] you see she is the continued
[35:24] revelation of his Divine Life
[35:27] in human
[35:30] form the continued revelation of his
[35:34] Divine Life in human
[35:38] form look at this quote with me before
[35:40] we
[35:41] pray so you see if you were in the forn
[35:44] knowledge of God then you are becoming a
[35:47] part of God and the only way you can be
[35:50] a Son of God or a daughter of God you
[35:53] had to be a part of God
[35:58] and God
[36:03] isn't
[36:06] complete without
[36:08] you praise God has to be that's right
[36:13] because there's only one only one
[36:15] resource of eternal life and that is God
[36:18] and in him alone has eternal life that
[36:21] you were a part of him in so
[36:25] much that you're an attribute or in his
[36:28] thinking at the beginning and that
[36:32] because he thought of you in the
[36:35] beginning it gives
[36:38] you that
[36:40] little that little
[36:43] tug towards in him that's what has to be
[36:50] quickened don't you see what God did God
[36:54] quickened your tug
[36:59] praise God thank you
[37:02] Lord praise God it gives that little tug
[37:08] towards him and that's what has to be
[37:12] quickened and we'd like to be remembered
[37:14] tonight as we pray me
[37:18] too Lord Jesus these are astounding
[37:23] words to think that there are people
[37:26] standing in this place tonight not only
[37:28] just here but different parts of the
[37:32] world that are in Christ
[37:35] Jesus and they are considered to be part
[37:39] of the mystical Body of Christ
[37:43] himself dear father we struggle to try
[37:48] to look beyond our humanity and our
[37:50] failures and our
[37:52] weaknesses they're with us every day and
[37:56] we know that that we need to be
[37:57] quickened to look beyond our
[37:59] Humanity to be able to see that Divine
[38:02] part that lives in us would you speak to
[38:05] us tonight
[38:06] father remove the
[38:09] veil from our eyes Lord Open the Eyes of
[38:13] our understanding that we can have a
[38:16] greater picture of
[38:17] Grace won't you grant it father in the
[38:20] name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen God
[38:24] bless you you may be
[38:33] seated the teaching of Paul on this
[38:37] great mystery of
[38:39] God coming into the church is one of
[38:42] the greatest
[38:45] Mysteries of the New
[38:48] Testament it was kept hid down through
[38:51] the ages to the even the sages and the
[38:54] prophets of what God
[38:57] allowed them to
[38:59] see occasionally they would catch a
[39:02] little array of light a little Glimpse
[39:06] and the shadows and the
[39:08] types you have to keep in mind that when
[39:11] God had his word written part of it was
[39:15] going to be written out in Genesis
[39:17] Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy
[39:20] Joshua Judges Ruth so on and so on but
[39:25] much of it was written
[39:27] in the lives of people and God hid the
[39:31] mystery of much of what he was going to
[39:33] do in the lives of people and they
[39:36] themselves didn't even know that they
[39:38] were doing that and God didn't make an
[39:41] announcement uh this is an announcement
[39:44] to the
[39:45] world Joseph is going down the land of
[39:48] Egypt he'll be a type of me he's going
[39:51] to marry a gentile which would be a type
[39:54] of my bride God never said none of that
[39:57] must have seemed very unusual and very
[40:00] strange neither did God say that in the
[40:03] life of Esther again would be a written
[40:06] the type of his bride because it would
[40:09] seem as if though the Book of Esther
[40:12] wasn't really even that great of a
[40:15] religious book to some of them the Book
[40:18] of Ruth the same way so God chose to
[40:22] write part of what he was going to do in
[40:25] the lives of individual uals but if he
[40:28] chose to write it that way then it
[40:31] convinces me that he's going to reveal
[40:35] that part in the same way so it would be
[40:38] written in the Bible of course it would
[40:40] be written in the message so people
[40:42] would be able to pick it up and read it
[40:45] but those who look for the manifested
[40:48] word to be only in book form or tape
[40:51] form or Bible form will miss so much of
[40:56] what God is doing because he writes it
[41:00] there so we can see it but many times he
[41:03] will reveal it in flesh
[41:05] form the word oh how we love the word
[41:09] don't we we love our Bibles we love the
[41:11] word of God we love to read it but many
[41:14] people do that and they know it by
[41:17] memory and they have studied it for
[41:19] years and years and still Overlook many
[41:22] of the Great Things notice in 1
[41:25] Corinthians chapter 12: 13 Paul says for
[41:28] by one Spirit we are all
[41:33] baptized into one body now remember this
[41:37] word we've looked at it for years and
[41:39] years it is baptismal and this is where
[41:42] John got the name John the Baptist and
[41:46] it was not that his mom and daddy called
[41:48] him that but actually the people did and
[41:50] it was because John was known by the
[41:53] actions that he was doing so he was
[41:55] taking people down in water and
[41:57] baptizing them so they called him John
[42:00] the Baptist but this word also the
[42:03] further meaning of it is that we looked
[42:06] at it years ago I'm sure you've
[42:07] remembered that it goes from changing a
[42:11] cucumber to a
[42:13] pickle so it is baptized into a solution
[42:19] but it doesn't go down for a dip and
[42:22] then come back up but it's actually back
[42:26] baptized into this solution and there it
[42:30] stays until it is changed then it is
[42:34] pulled from the vat a changed being so a
[42:40] cucumber is stuck into this solution
[42:44] left there long enough it
[42:47] transformed from a cucumber to a pickle
[42:52] and it will never go back to being a
[42:56] cucumber again now many people get
[43:00] baptized they get dipped into water and
[43:03] some of them actually get dipped into
[43:06] the spirit of God but what they do is
[43:09] they go down and they get a little dip
[43:11] and then they come back up and they go
[43:13] ahead and live the way they did before
[43:15] now that's the way Elvis was because
[43:17] Elvis had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[43:20] so in other words Elvis got a dip into
[43:24] the spirit of God and come back up and
[43:27] took his shouting that he learned at the
[43:29] Assemblies of God onto the Rock and Roll
[43:32] concert stage that's where he learned to
[43:35] shake his legs so he did not stay there
[43:39] in the vat and get sealed by the
[43:42] presence of God and change from a
[43:44] cucumber to a pickle I don't know about
[43:47] you I don't want to remain a
[43:50] cc I want to be changed don't you I want
[43:53] to stay in that vet until I am so
[43:56] thoroughly changed that whenever I come
[43:59] out I will be different than what I was
[44:03] when I went in notice how Paul Likens
[44:06] this for he says for by one Spirit we're
[44:09] all baptized into one body whether we be
[44:14] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[44:18] free and have been all made to
[44:23] drink into one spirit
[44:27] how unusual this must have been for the
[44:29] Jews to try to comprehend that the
[44:32] Greeks which Corinth was a a pretty
[44:34] large Greek church that the Jews and the
[44:38] Gentiles were now the same no difference
[44:42] they must have really really struggled
[44:45] so Paul is trying to get them to
[44:48] understand once the Gentiles have been
[44:50] dipped into the Vet of the mercy of God
[44:54] they come out of that vet just as
[44:57] righteous before God as Abraham did and
[45:00] more so because the vet took them back
[45:04] before they ever sinned in the first
[45:07] place and then Paul brings it from Just
[45:11] baptism notice how he Likens it for by
[45:14] one Spirit we're all baptized into one
[45:17] body whether it be Jews or Gentiles
[45:20] whether we be Bond or free and have been
[45:22] made to drink into two one spirit so
[45:26] what we're doing now is we're actually
[45:30] drinking the
[45:32] baptism
[45:34] solution so you're not just dip down
[45:37] into it and then dry yourself off and
[45:40] then you're just like you were before
[45:43] but actually you're drinking the
[45:46] solution which is keeping you constantly
[45:49] Changed by the grace of God so you see
[45:53] we're still being changed how many knows
[45:55] we're still a work can progress so when
[45:57] we reach the end and we say well I can
[45:59] go no further well I feel sorry for you
[46:02] cuz the only people I know that can go
[46:04] no farther as those that's already
[46:05] passed from this life into the next life
[46:08] but those of us that are still alive
[46:10] we're still drinking of the same
[46:13] solution that changed us when we got the
[46:16] new births and then Paul Likens that
[46:19] that we're drinking he says in to this
[46:22] one spirit so now Paul is trying to
[46:26] break down and show not only to the Jews
[46:29] but of course to the Gentiles knowing
[46:31] that this would be read for many many
[46:32] years thereafter one of the most
[46:35] important teachings that would ever be
[46:38] revealed to the human race of what God
[46:42] actually did so it is more than just God
[46:46] saving a people from their sins but God
[46:50] is going to immerse them into this
[46:54] mystical body called the body of Christ
[46:59] and God is going to change them from
[47:02] John and Jane Doe to where they will no
[47:07] longer just be a sinner out there that's
[47:10] trying to be a better person and live a
[47:13] better life and they're they're reading
[47:15] all types of self-help books and they're
[47:18] getting all types of you know web things
[47:20] and they're learning and learning and
[47:22] they're trying to discipline their s but
[47:24] God is going to take them and dip them
[47:27] into Christ and they will come up a new
[47:32] person now whenever this happens to them
[47:36] he is going to totally transform them
[47:39] from John Doe and Jane Doe and whoever
[47:42] they are until they will actually become
[47:47] one of the anointed ones for the cause
[47:50] of Christ in the last day so they will
[47:54] no longer be a person then that is
[47:57] trying to do good deeds and trying their
[48:00] best to be a righteous person but they
[48:04] will lose their old
[48:06] identity and actually
[48:09] become the anointed
[48:13] one you see all the elect members that
[48:17] are baptized into this mystical Body of
[48:21] Christ now remember the body of the Lord
[48:24] Jesus is is there on the throne of God
[48:27] that was the flesh which was
[48:31] glorified but the Christos remember
[48:34] Jesus body never come back into your
[48:37] soul when you receive the Holy Ghost the
[48:41] body of Jesus is not divided in the
[48:45] sense that I've got a little part of his
[48:46] flesh you got a little part of his flesh
[48:49] people in India have a part look he was
[48:51] only a small man there was not enough
[48:54] physical corporate Al flesh for us to
[48:57] take of that when he gave the symbolism
[48:59] except you eat my flesh and drink my
[49:01] blood you have no life it wasn't talking
[49:03] about his Corporal body he was talking
[49:06] about partaking of the sharing of the
[49:08] life and the opening of the mystery
[49:10] don't you see what happened on the cross
[49:11] it was the opening of The Book of the
[49:14] revealed word the Son of God hanging on
[49:16] the cross God opened up the mystery of
[49:19] the book of redemption of the Lord Jesus
[49:23] and the bride came out so there was not
[49:26] enough Humanity not enough flesh to tear
[49:29] off the peace and give to every one of
[49:31] us that we do in symbolism by taking
[49:33] communion but the Christos the Christ
[49:36] the anointing every child of God around
[49:39] the earth tonight that has the baptism
[49:41] of the Holy Ghost has a portion of the
[49:43] spirit of God if there were
[49:46] 95 billion Christians on the face of the
[49:50] Earth tonight and 95 billion people have
[49:54] the Holy Ghost it would not deplete the
[49:57] spirit of Christ at all now that could
[50:01] not be said about the human body of the
[50:04] Lord Jesus Remember When the human body
[50:06] raised from the dead he could only be at
[50:09] one spot at one time by his Corporal
[50:13] presence You Follow Me by his Corporal
[50:15] presence yet by his omnipotence and his
[50:19] omnipresence by that for knowledge he
[50:21] knew all things at one time but by the
[50:24] Corporal body he could only be there
[50:26] with the disciples he would walk through
[50:28] a wall and then he would disappear well
[50:31] they did no longer see him where was he
[50:33] well he was somewhere else and then he
[50:34] would go somewhere else and then he
[50:36] appeared again in a few days and there
[50:38] he was again so when that Corporal body
[50:40] ascended then the angel said this same
[50:42] Jesus that you see going away will come
[50:45] again in like manner so what are we
[50:47] looking for at the coming of the Lord
[50:50] Jesus that Corporal body is that right
[50:53] but what's here with us tonight
[50:56] Christ the son of God the Holy
[51:00] Spirit but the body the human Temple the
[51:05] Tabernacle that God glorified you see
[51:07] God said this is my part of the earth
[51:12] and from this part I will redeem the
[51:16] rest of it so this was God's own part of
[51:20] the earth that become human and tangible
[51:23] then God hid inside of that body use
[51:25] that body as a veil tore the veil open
[51:28] and release Zoe God's eternal life then
[51:32] the Holy Ghost comes back on the day of
[51:34] Pentecost and starts baptizing
[51:37] individuals into the new form of Christ
[51:42] not the new form of Jesus but the new
[51:44] form of Christ which is the mystical
[51:49] body now the mystical body is in a
[51:52] dimensional world to where our eyes
[51:55] cannot just see it we'll say it this way
[51:58] that every person here tonight that has
[52:00] the Holy Ghost every person in Indiana
[52:02] Ohio Guatemala Honduras India New
[52:05] Zealand Africa all over the world every
[52:08] one of them are baptized into one body
[52:11] yet many of them we will never know we
[52:13] will never see them we'll never Shake
[52:15] our hand but they're baptized into a
[52:18] spiritual realm and it's only one body
[52:21] and yet all of us identified with the
[52:24] atonement I want you to notice now that
[52:27] body is not actually identified as Word
[52:30] of Life or even like Tabernacle or you
[52:34] know whatever that the church name would
[52:36] be it's not identified as Word of Life
[52:40] evening light it's not identified as
[52:42] brandom Tabernacle some other Tabernacle
[52:45] it's identified actually as
[52:50] Christ you see this is why he's so
[52:53] selective of who he will
[52:57] baptize into the
[53:01] juice cuz if they stay in there long
[53:03] enough they are his and they are sealed
[53:07] so if they've got lying and rotness and
[53:10] adultery and filth and whatever more and
[53:13] he leaves them in that vat that is
[53:16] sealed in them and will be in them in
[53:19] heaven so it's not everybody that says
[53:22] Lord Lord not even everybody that can do
[53:24] wonders and miracles
[53:25] because they can have a dip into the
[53:28] spirit of God and have even gifts and
[53:30] still not have their soul immersed in
[53:32] changed to a pickle so he's very
[53:36] selective and very precautious of whom
[53:40] he will give this seal too but all of
[53:42] those that get it are baptized into
[53:45] Christ himself so when them Believers
[53:47] come before God In Prayer God is not so
[53:50] much hearing their voice but the voice
[53:53] of the Lamb of God
[53:55] amen cuz your prayers are coming up
[53:58] through the blood of the Lord Jesus so
[54:01] notice in the elect of God being members
[54:04] in that mystical body called Christ are
[54:07] actually identified as Christ body and
[54:11] therefore they are partaking of perfect
[54:15] righteousness so it's not that God takes
[54:18] an element of righteousness out of the
[54:20] Lord Jesus and gives you a little bit
[54:22] and you a little bit and you a little
[54:23] bit me a little bit you brothers and you
[54:25] sisters and those of you that are
[54:27] streaming the service we got that
[54:29] backwards it's not that he's taking a
[54:31] little bit out and giving you a little
[54:33] part what he's doing is taking you out
[54:36] of the world and actually immersing you
[54:40] into the body of righteousness itself
[54:44] which is Christ Jesus that's the only
[54:46] way that we could be sinless enough to
[54:49] be able to go into a Rapture in him we
[54:53] are identified as as blameless because
[54:57] if it's just a deposit put in us then if
[54:59] we had a bad week or a couple of bad
[55:02] weeks and we had one mistake after
[55:04] another another mess up after another
[55:07] before long our righteousness is going
[55:09] to be pretty much watered down don't you
[55:11] think unless he takes your soul and
[55:14] immerses your soul into this great
[55:17] Fountain of ocean of righteousness
[55:20] itself then it's not your little part
[55:22] pulled out from the mystical body you
[55:25] are actually immersed into the body and
[55:27] when God looks at the body he sees what
[55:31] Christ
[55:36] Jesus and God sees the Son of God
[55:41] himself
[55:43] so God actually saves
[55:47] people by
[55:49] transferring
[55:51] them
[55:53] into Christ
[55:58] this is the kind of eternal security I
[56:01] believe
[56:04] in wo so when God Saves them sanctifies
[56:09] them fills them with a holy ghost seals
[56:12] them into the presence of God he
[56:15] releases them from their former identity
[56:19] and transfers them actually into the
[56:22] mystical Body of Christ
[56:25] and from there There Is No
[56:30] Escape and they don't want to
[56:34] anyway and he identifies them as Christ
[56:39] and making them in
[56:43] fact to be
[56:47] Christ that don't get in your mind Jesus
[56:50] now remember that's the human body what
[56:53] is Christ the anointed
[56:57] one so it makes them of a Heavenly
[57:02] nature and this great Heavenly plan man
[57:07] must become truly righteous before God
[57:11] so how in the world can we be standing
[57:13] here on the day of the Rapture and we we
[57:17] got Sinners all around us we got our
[57:19] Humanity we've got failures our mistakes
[57:22] tell me what can God ever do
[57:25] that in a moment in a twinkling of an
[57:27] eye take us out of a place as filthy and
[57:31] rotten as this world is and immediately
[57:35] transfer us into a new body and transfer
[57:39] us into heaven and one minute you're
[57:41] walking down south rone and there's
[57:44] drunks over here and there's homeless
[57:46] over there and there's Liars over there
[57:48] and everywhere around you sin everywhere
[57:51] and then the next step you take you're
[57:53] right there in the presence of of the
[57:55] Lord Jesus how in the world could how in
[57:59] the world could he ever get us all
[58:02] mistake free for five seconds around the
[58:05] whole world at one time in order to say
[58:09] okay I've got everybody perfect angels
[58:11] hold your breath hold your breath one of
[58:13] us would mess up the whole program sure
[58:16] as there's a God in heaven and if it
[58:18] wasn't you all it be me but I imagine
[58:20] some of you would be just as bad as I
[58:22] would don't sit there and look at me
[58:24] like a bu the Holy Angels now but what
[58:27] if God could immerse and dip us into the
[58:31] Vet of Christ
[58:34] himself then in that he does not look at
[58:38] our mistake but brother Bram I have so
[58:41] many things about me that I'm know not
[58:44] right but sister Georgie that's why he
[58:48] died so your mistakes would not be
[58:51] lotted to you he SE your heart and he
[58:56] knows don't you understand if you're
[58:58] sinking you're ever going to get to a
[59:00] spot that you're human flesh you're
[59:03] going to perfect it forget it the word
[59:07] of God nor the message of the hour does
[59:10] not teach human Perfection of your flesh
[59:14] it is your enemy it is an animal it is
[59:19] against the word of God come on somebody
[59:22] you'll never get good enough you'll
[59:24] never stay clean enough you'll never be
[59:27] holy enough on the outside but the key
[59:30] is for God to transfer your being and
[59:34] your identity out of mortality and place
[59:39] you in the mystical body and hide you so
[59:42] deep in Christ the devil can't even find
[59:45] [Music]
[59:45] [Applause]
[59:53] you
[59:56] so by this
[1:00:00] plan God changes you from being John
[1:00:07] Doe to becoming
[1:00:14] Christ everybody still alive you okay
[1:00:18] okay all
[1:00:22] right watch this remember
[1:00:27] remember
[1:00:30] he became
[1:00:33] you that
[1:00:37] you might
[1:00:42] become he became a
[1:00:47] sinner separated from the
[1:00:50] father when he screamed my God why H has
[1:00:54] Thou forsaken
[1:00:56] me he was separated from God in his
[1:01:02] death that you in your
[1:01:05] deaths might have God's
[1:01:09] presence isn't that
[1:01:11] awesome what a loving savior what Grace
[1:01:16] has been given to us so he died alone
[1:01:21] out of the presence of God
[1:01:25] and become a
[1:01:27] curse a serpent hanging on the
[1:01:31] pole out of the presence of God angels
[1:01:34] turning their backs on him the spirit of
[1:01:38] God could not even behold him because he
[1:01:41] could not look upon sin and he become a
[1:01:46] sinner Prophet said the worst sinner
[1:01:50] that ever lived on the
[1:01:52] earth I remember it was not because of
[1:01:55] what he
[1:01:56] did how was this how was this even
[1:01:59] possible he never said one thing wrong
[1:02:03] he never did one thing wrong but he
[1:02:07] became
[1:02:09] me that was all he had to do to become a
[1:02:12] bad sinner was become me then you add me
[1:02:16] and you and you and you and you and
[1:02:19] everybody else on top of that so it
[1:02:22] wasn't what he did
[1:02:24] it's what he
[1:02:26] become oh I hope and pray that God will
[1:02:28] drop that Revelation inside of your
[1:02:30] heart tonight don't you understand that
[1:02:33] he did that Hallelujah because he loved
[1:02:36] us it was not what he did it's what he
[1:02:40] became when are you and I ever going to
[1:02:43] understand it's not what we do it's what
[1:02:46] we become what do we become the very
[1:02:50] righteousness of God in him oh okay

[1:03:54] a
[1:03:55] child of
[1:03:58] obedience a't that awesome there's no
[1:04:01] way we could be children of obedience we
[1:04:04] were born after the fall in the Garden
[1:04:06] of Eden it comes by nature for us to
[1:04:09] disobey God it's just in our flesh we
[1:04:13] cannot help that and he knew that so he
[1:04:16] must come to change us the law could
[1:04:18] never do it the prophets could never do
[1:04:21] it the reading of the law and memorizing
[1:04:23] them could never do it there must be a
[1:04:25] nature change every lamb in the Old
[1:04:27] Testament they could be able to lay
[1:04:29] their hands on the lamb and The Sinner
[1:04:31] would maybe go up to the altar with the
[1:04:33] lamb and put his hands over on it
[1:04:35] knowing that it signified a transferring
[1:04:38] of his sins upon the lamb and they'd
[1:04:40] take the knife and cut the Lamb's throat
[1:04:42] the hot blood would spew out and the
[1:04:44] worshipper would have the blood on his
[1:04:46] hands and he would walk out of there
[1:04:48] maybe the same day do the very same sin
[1:04:51] he' got forgiveness of that morning and
[1:04:54] God knew them Lambs could never replace
[1:04:57] the Fallen nature of man so what did God
[1:05:00] do God bottled up this great Hallelujah
[1:05:03] this great power of forgiveness and
[1:05:06] mercy and righteousness and God put it
[1:05:08] in this vat called Jesus
[1:05:12] Christ and God opened it
[1:05:15] up Hallelujah and said then if you'll
[1:05:18] come to me and be baptized into me and
[1:05:23] drink
[1:05:24] drink I will transform you from a church
[1:05:27] member into a holy ghost filled son or
[1:05:30] daughter of God just drink when do I
[1:05:33] stop brother Donnie don't never stop
[1:05:35] keep on drinking keep on drinking of the
[1:05:37] good Holy Ghost how many knows we need a
[1:05:39] good
[1:05:42] drink
[1:05:44] oh then what does God do then God places
[1:05:48] us into the mystical body and we are
[1:05:53] ready for our position in Christ Jesus I
[1:05:58] know a lot of folks in the message are
[1:05:59] waiting for the adoption time to
[1:06:02] come and some of the things they're
[1:06:04] looking for is actually going to be in
[1:06:06] the
[1:06:07] Millennium forget controlling the clouds
[1:06:10] forget controlling the storms forget all
[1:06:13] that stuff I'm more focused on control
[1:06:15] this 16 elements right here than I am
[1:06:17] the clouds yes sir I don't like riding
[1:06:19] in clouds and I'm flying of course I
[1:06:21] don't like storms any of that sort of
[1:06:23] thing but really it ain't them things
[1:06:25] that get me in that much trouble it's
[1:06:26] this old boy right here I figure if I
[1:06:28] could get to a spot I can control this
[1:06:31] right here I'll be in pretty good shape
[1:06:33] and I believe by the grace of God that's
[1:06:36] what he wants to happen in our lives by
[1:06:38] the word now you see once we're baptized
[1:06:42] in into the mystical body then God also
[1:06:45] places Us by his grace in a a local
[1:06:49] assembly to where we can find also our
[1:06:52] position in that assembly oh aren't you
[1:06:55] glad that it doesn't just start in the
[1:06:58] Supernatural realm now that's why a lot
[1:06:59] of folks tell well I'm in Christ and now
[1:07:02] I'm in there I don't have to do anything
[1:07:03] I don't have to put forth no effort I
[1:07:05] don't really have to go to church or
[1:07:07] anything like that where in the words
[1:07:08] you get that at you don't find that in
[1:07:10] the Bible and you sure don't find the
[1:07:11] message of the hour but God places Us in
[1:07:14] the body that we can minister to others
[1:07:17] and that we also can be ministered too
[1:07:20] look friend I don't care how great the
[1:07:22] preacher is you and preachers need to be
[1:07:25] ministered to as well you understand
[1:07:28] that sometimes when brother Brandon
[1:07:29] would be at home in his own Tabernacle
[1:07:32] that he would let brother Neville preach
[1:07:34] he actually even let brother Lee Vale
[1:07:36] preach and he would let other brothers
[1:07:39] preach and brother Bram I mean time
[1:07:41] after time when brother Neville would
[1:07:44] preach he said I certainly enjoyed that
[1:07:46] this morning I felt led to have brother
[1:07:48] Neville to preach I got so many sermons
[1:07:51] out of what our brother said oh my
[1:07:53] goodness you mean brother Brandon needed
[1:07:55] to hear from another preacher yeah you
[1:07:58] know there's a lot of angelist in their
[1:08:00] message and they say they have a home
[1:08:02] church but they're never home at their
[1:08:03] Church they're constantly gone here gone
[1:08:06] there they never hear nobody else preach
[1:08:08] but themselves but I tell you one thing
[1:08:10] they must like hearing their s a whole
[1:08:12] lot more than I enjoy hearing me I need
[1:08:15] to be preached to myself I ain't talking
[1:08:18] about just from tapes I need to hear
[1:08:20] other men of God preach to me come on
[1:08:23] somebody why because I also need to
[1:08:26] receive as well as give you give and
[1:08:29] give and give but you've also got to
[1:08:32] have an intake from the presence of God
[1:08:34] and that's the thing I'm afraid there's
[1:08:36] so many Miss well you know I don't know
[1:08:38] I don't feel apart well why don't you
[1:08:40] feel apart why don't you feel apart find
[1:08:43] an assembly somewhere where God
[1:08:45] positionally places you under a Ministry
[1:08:47] of the hour that's really preaching the
[1:08:50] word that'll give you a body change and
[1:08:52] find what God want wants you to do but
[1:08:54] brother Donnie I can't sing I ain't
[1:08:56] never spoke in tongues I don't ever
[1:08:58] prophesy well maybe God wants you to
[1:09:00] pray for them that do sing and God wants
[1:09:02] you to pray for them that do prophesy
[1:09:05] and God wants you to pray for them
[1:09:06] preachers that's out on the field
[1:09:08] everybody has something they can do to
[1:09:12] minister to the
[1:09:14] body and everybody
[1:09:17] said watch now in verse 14 for the body
[1:09:21] is not one member but many now can you
[1:09:27] imagine here tonight if I was a six foot
[1:09:31] nose no fingers no eyes no toes no legs
[1:09:37] just one gigantic nose Lord have mercy
[1:09:40] the nostrils would be that big around
[1:09:42] wouldn't he my nose is big and ugly
[1:09:44] enough the way it is I can't imagine
[1:09:45] being a six- foot nose but that's the
[1:09:48] way some folks have it oh I don't need
[1:09:50] to go to church I don't need this I
[1:09:52] don't need that how you doing remember
[1:09:53] the nose so you're just a 5 foot portly
[1:09:57] little uh little nose huh or or you're
[1:10:00] you're a big eyeball or you're you're
[1:10:02] just one you're one finger you're six
[1:10:04] foot one finger and you know I I really
[1:10:06] don't need anybody I'm not sure where
[1:10:08] you get that concept because that's not
[1:10:10] from the Bible Paul never said that it's
[1:10:13] just one member only but it's a whole
[1:10:16] mystical body but has all types of
[1:10:18] different members that are everyone
[1:10:20] essential to the other for the body is
[1:10:23] it's not one member but many so the
[1:10:26] different parts are needed in the body
[1:10:29] for it to be a body to be able to exist
[1:10:32] so no believer should ever look ATS and
[1:10:36] the gift that God gave them as being
[1:10:38] inferior to another remember our gifts
[1:10:41] our abilities and what God has given to
[1:10:43] us they're not d by us they're not even
[1:10:46] asked for okay God I'd like to have this
[1:10:48] I want that I want to make a multiple
[1:10:50] choice I go down through and I'll check
[1:10:51] all the boxes of the things I want
[1:10:53] that's not the way it happens God gives
[1:10:55] them to us so whenever we say well I'm
[1:10:57] useless I'm of no value do you know what
[1:11:00] you're doing you are saying God don't
[1:11:03] know what he was doing when he placed
[1:11:05] you in the
[1:11:08] body so does God make mistakes anybody
[1:11:12] believe that anybody believe that God
[1:11:13] makes mistakes well why should we accuse
[1:11:16] him and say well you know I'm just not
[1:11:18] important ain't hard even nobody knows
[1:11:20] me by name and I don't never sing I
[1:11:23] don't ever get up before everybody I I
[1:11:25] don't know I I I guess I just ain't
[1:11:27] nobody don't never say that if God
[1:11:30] placed you as part of us and God placed
[1:11:34] you as part of this end time message it
[1:11:36] was him that placed you not
[1:11:42] yourself so your gift your position is
[1:11:45] not
[1:11:48] inferior
[1:11:49] Hallelujah to another and therefore we
[1:11:52] should not even be
[1:11:55] jealous if people would look at it in
[1:11:57] the right way it would eliminate
[1:12:00] jealousy there'd be no need for jeal why
[1:12:03] are people jealous they're jealous of
[1:12:06] other singers or other musicians or
[1:12:08] other preachers but if they could just
[1:12:11] be satisfied that God made them to be a
[1:12:14] little pinky oh don't you love that
[1:12:16] little fell oh man ain't he a good
[1:12:18] little thing to have now can you imagine
[1:12:20] if your thumb was out there if you had
[1:12:22] two thumbs wouldn't that really be weird
[1:12:24] wouldn't it be really strange if your
[1:12:25] longest finger was right there wouldn't
[1:12:27] it be really weird if your toe was up
[1:12:29] here and your this finger right here was
[1:12:32] down when your foot goes you talking
[1:12:33] about some of y'all crippling to come to
[1:12:35] church so what's the matter brother doy
[1:12:37] what in the world's going on it's that
[1:12:38] little finger on the foot you say your
[1:12:40] little finger on your foot well that's
[1:12:42] the way some people try to do
[1:12:43] spiritually they want to manipulate the
[1:12:45] body of god let's just leave it the way
[1:12:48] God made it it'll work just fine your
[1:12:51] shoes will fit fine your imagine you go
[1:12:54] to put on a pair of gloves and you got
[1:12:56] five big toes on one hand you going into
[1:12:58] a glove store you go to mahomies you go
[1:13:00] to targets you go to Walmart I'm looking
[1:13:02] for a special pair of gloves okay so
[1:13:03] what do you need I need a pair of gloves
[1:13:05] that has five big toes on one hand and
[1:13:08] then I need another glove on the other
[1:13:10] side that has five noses on one hand
[1:13:13] because I rearranged myself so I did not
[1:13:17] like my toes bend down there're hidden
[1:13:19] do you understand my toes are hidden
[1:13:21] almost all the time I don't go
[1:13:23] barefooted NOP I don't wear sandals I
[1:13:25] don't own a pair of them things I tell
[1:13:28] car it's a good thing I didn't live in
[1:13:29] the days of Jesus cuz I don't never got
[1:13:31] around nowhere having to wear sandals
[1:13:34] this Cowboy don't wear
[1:13:36] sandals so you imagine taking them toes
[1:13:39] and say you know what I think my toes
[1:13:41] are so pretty I I'm going to go to the
[1:13:43] doctor and I'm going to say sir I want
[1:13:45] you to rearrange me I want I want you to
[1:13:47] transfer these fingers down here to my
[1:13:49] foot and I'm getting tired of these here
[1:13:51] toes you see these toes right here I'm
[1:13:53] sick a tired of going to church ain't
[1:13:55] nobody ever sees my toe except the
[1:13:57] brother that washes my feet every now
[1:13:59] and then when we have foot washing it
[1:14:01] Ain it ain't right it just ain't right
[1:14:03] people don't even know if I've got one
[1:14:05] toe two toe three toe five toe they
[1:14:07] don't even know my toes are never even
[1:14:10] seen I'm sick and tired of my
[1:14:12] gallbladder being hid in my body I want
[1:14:14] to have my ear tuck off and my gall
[1:14:17] better stuck on the side of my
[1:14:20] head well I do hope if you do that you
[1:14:23] set in the
[1:14:25] back cuz even the preacher is going to
[1:14:27] have a hard time keep from staring at
[1:14:29] you with that bouncy thing hanging on
[1:14:30] the side of your
[1:14:33] head makes a lot of sense don't well you
[1:14:36] laugh at it naturally but we do it
[1:14:39] spiritually amen yes
[1:14:43] sir God don't have hazly pour out his
[1:14:48] gifts you see if we would seek to please
[1:14:51] God half as much as we would want to
[1:14:55] please
[1:15:00] ourself I guarantee you we'd be a whole
[1:15:02] lot better off wouldn't we now see I
[1:15:05] knew if y'all knew that we was going
[1:15:07] into this part when that other good deep
[1:15:09] part was up I knew y'all really be
[1:15:11] rejoicing you'd really be pulling if you
[1:15:13] knew what was following I knew the Lord
[1:15:16] was just pulling you all in so he could
[1:15:18] pull you in really good and kiss you on
[1:15:19] the forehead and then smack
[1:15:21] you he does that sometimes
[1:15:24] only oh my notice 1 Corinthians
[1:15:28] 12:19 if they were all one
[1:15:33] member
[1:15:35] where were the
[1:15:38] body now remember this setting is the
[1:15:40] Corinthian
[1:15:42] Church and the Christians at Corinth had
[1:15:45] received an
[1:15:47] abundance of spiritual
[1:15:50] gifts but they were lacking in spiritual
[1:15:55] Graces gifts and graces are not the same
[1:15:59] thing the kind of Christian
[1:16:02] character that the holy ghost wanted
[1:16:05] them to
[1:16:07] have now boy you talking about gifted
[1:16:09] these folks were gifted oh yeah but the
[1:16:14] spirit of God kept wanting for them to
[1:16:17] come on up a little higher in their
[1:16:19] character and I imagine some of them you
[1:16:21] know when they got the letter there from
[1:16:23] Paul in Corinth about speaking in
[1:16:25] tongues maybe prophecy and all that no
[1:16:28] don't you imagine as your be as them
[1:16:30] Corinthians were they was some of them
[1:16:31] said I'll tell you one thing I I I don't
[1:16:34] like that I don't like that old church
[1:16:36] order stuff I think maybe our church in
[1:16:39] Corinth is kind of sovereign on its
[1:16:43] own I believe Paul's a prophet all right
[1:16:46] but I don't think we have to do all that
[1:16:49] sort of stuff why who in the world ever
[1:16:51] heard of limiting
[1:16:53] speaking in tongues and all that sort of
[1:16:55] thing but two no more than three in one
[1:16:58] Ser who ever heard of such a
[1:17:00] thing why in the world would you limit
[1:17:03] the spirit of
[1:17:04] God what do you think church what do you
[1:17:07] think Corinthian Believers don't you
[1:17:10] think that we're a sovereign
[1:17:12] body and we will pick out of this letter
[1:17:16] even though it's got our name wrote on
[1:17:18] it but we will pick out what we St Paul
[1:17:25] when he was under the
[1:17:28] anointing we'll go through them verses
[1:17:31] and we'll pick out what he was under the
[1:17:33] anointing and then the other verses
[1:17:36] we'll just say well we're we're
[1:17:38] Sovereign in our
[1:17:40] church and uh we we we just don't think
[1:17:42] we need it we're not going to operate
[1:17:44] here in our church that
[1:17:46] way you see the folks in the message who
[1:17:48] do the message that way they would have
[1:17:50] done the same thing in the days of Paul
[1:17:53] cuz the prophet of God said whenever he
[1:17:55] did all of that he said that's exactly
[1:17:57] the way they did it in the scripture and
[1:17:59] that's exactly the way Paul did
[1:18:02] it come on now well that's what he said
[1:18:07] now they had this m they were so gifted
[1:18:11] and I honestly can't say that I
[1:18:13] understand how gifts and that sort of
[1:18:16] thing work in that God will let the
[1:18:19] gifts be poured out upon a people whose
[1:18:23] character doesn't quite match it you
[1:18:26] know in my thinking I would do something
[1:18:28] totally different I'd wait till
[1:18:29] everybody's perfect which means nobody
[1:18:30] ever have
[1:18:32] any
[1:18:33] right but notice what he said there in
[1:18:36] verse 20 but now are they many members
[1:18:39] get one body so you see when the members
[1:18:43] can recognize that they themselves
[1:18:46] actually promote pray for and desire a
[1:18:50] Unity not only in the mystical body but
[1:18:53] a unity in the local assembly and will
[1:18:56] it be a struggle to have yep and not
[1:18:58] only that a greater struggle to keep
[1:19:00] because they realize their
[1:19:03] dependence on the other people they go
[1:19:05] to church with you see those who don't
[1:19:07] think they need that they miss this from
[1:19:10] the scripture and from the message so
[1:19:12] it's like they gained this Independence
[1:19:15] and they're you know they're totally
[1:19:17] separated from the rest of the body they
[1:19:18] don't need nobody they don't need to go
[1:19:20] to church they don't need to sing well I
[1:19:22] I I I just take my gift of singing and I
[1:19:24] sing to me on the Lord in the shower
[1:19:26] well that's good I mean does the shower
[1:19:29] clap its hands and everything and just
[1:19:31] rejoice when you're singing there to it
[1:19:33] and really so who are you blessing
[1:19:36] besides you who are you benefiting who
[1:19:40] are you ministering to besides yourself
[1:19:43] well go ahead and say it
[1:19:44] nobody so you're going to answer to God
[1:19:47] for an unused gift because you refuse to
[1:19:50] get into a church somewhere and benefit
[1:19:53] the body somebody
[1:19:57] said but those who realize the
[1:20:01] dependence the dependence that they need
[1:20:05] one another they look at it totally
[1:20:07] different they don't look at going to
[1:20:09] church and trying to find you know oh
[1:20:12] I'll tell you one thing our church has
[1:20:13] got so many people and that's got flaws
[1:20:16] of course they do that's why you're so
[1:20:18] welcome here
[1:20:21] honey
[1:20:25] come on now don't sit there and look at
[1:20:26] me like a little bunch of angels I go to
[1:20:29] C and you been one of them kind that
[1:20:30] rides in
[1:20:33] motorcycles but real true mystical
[1:20:36] members of the body promote the
[1:20:40] dependence of one another listen to me
[1:20:43] Church there is no church that is
[1:20:47] complete on its own without even having
[1:20:50] other fellowship with other churches
[1:20:53] and other
[1:20:55] ministers am you become isolated you
[1:20:59] become so self centered everything
[1:21:02] becomes about you and you watch a
[1:21:04] preacher that pulls people off just to
[1:21:06] himself you mark my word and remember it
[1:21:09] he's leaving God's word God never does
[1:21:14] such a thing what but happen to an organ
[1:21:16] in your body if it did that now most of
[1:21:20] you of course are aware of Auto and
[1:21:22] immune diseases are you not and there's
[1:21:25] over a hundred of them that they have
[1:21:28] identified by name and symptoms and so
[1:21:30] on and of course most of them will
[1:21:33] attack the body itself so they begin
[1:21:37] from within something something triggers
[1:21:40] something within the body and the body
[1:21:43] will go to attacking itself and it goes
[1:21:46] to releasing these soldiers and they
[1:21:48] somehow they miscommunicate a message
[1:21:51] inside the body and the body begins to
[1:21:53] see something inside the body and it
[1:21:56] begins to say that's an enemy that's an
[1:21:59] enemy and the body will go to attacking
[1:22:06] itself that ain't just so in the Natural
[1:22:09] Body it's happened for 2,000 years in
[1:22:13] God's spiritual body as well so then
[1:22:16] members of the body will go to attacking
[1:22:20] the body itself
[1:22:23] and then the body will turn against
[1:22:25] itself sometimes it's a rash sometimes
[1:22:28] it's it's the organ it can be so many
[1:22:30] different things and they've got to find
[1:22:33] a medication they've got to find
[1:22:35] something that'll reprogram that attack
[1:22:39] because you have quite a defense system
[1:22:41] built inside of you and there ain't
[1:22:44] nobody can attack you like a message
[1:22:47] preacher believe me I
[1:22:49] know I've been attacked for years I
[1:22:53] actually think that's part of my
[1:22:58] call I think God has to have preachers
[1:23:01] that can be hated run down lied
[1:23:05] on and being able to
[1:23:09] forgive granted Lord if that's what you
[1:23:11] want me for I'm here reporting for Duty
[1:23:13] some of you saying well God only wants
[1:23:15] people to walk on water raise the dead
[1:23:16] and heal the sick well maybe that's your
[1:23:18] call there's other people that's going
[1:23:20] to display the Forgiveness of the Lord
[1:23:22] Lord Jesus the way some miracle workers
[1:23:25] have no
[1:23:26] clue some great shouters that can shout
[1:23:28] their shoels off that's the way the
[1:23:30] Corinthian folks folks were man they
[1:23:32] were so gifted but they had such
[1:23:35] problems with divisions I'm a Paul I'm a
[1:23:38] cus I'm of this I'm of that oh my well
[1:23:43] I'll tell you one thing amen it's about
[1:23:44] like Ken's teeth tonight Ain
[1:23:46] they brother Fred would you please say
[1:23:48] man I'll give you a nickel Life Church
[1:23:50] if you
[1:23:51] will so you see diversity in the
[1:23:55] body is evidence displayed of the wisdom
[1:24:00] of God so every singer every person that
[1:24:03] preaches every Deacon every trustee all
[1:24:06] of that shows the diversity of God in
[1:24:09] the body and it displays his wisdom let
[1:24:13] me have just a little bit more time
[1:24:14] before we St can we now notice in verse
[1:24:16] 21 and the eye cannot say unto the hand
[1:24:20] I have no need
[1:24:23] of
[1:24:24] thee so look
[1:24:33] here now my eyes looking at this orange
[1:24:37] Clementine body
[1:24:40] armor my brain is telling me I'm
[1:24:44] sweating I'm
[1:24:47] thirsty now my hands are limited
[1:24:53] because my eye has said to my hands I
[1:24:56] don't need you oh my so let's see my eye
[1:25:02] pick it
[1:25:15] up you get the
[1:25:18] story now my mouth can pick it
[1:25:21] up
[1:25:24] but I can't drink
[1:25:34] it or I could do this and this is really
[1:25:38] deep everybody with me here we go I'm
[1:25:42] going to release these long
[1:25:46] fingers my eye sees
[1:25:51] it
[1:25:55] now but my eyes says lips I don't need
[1:26:02] you no no no no you big fat lip thing
[1:26:06] you don't don't you dare pull
[1:26:08] it how
[1:26:13] stupid don't you see when God puts us
[1:26:17] together he puts us together to
[1:26:20] accomplish so many
[1:26:23] things and how much more could be done
[1:26:27] if these worked together or I could be
[1:26:30] all
[1:26:33] Al that's why some folks are the only
[1:26:36] aspect of the minist they want are the
[1:26:39] eyes the
[1:26:41] prophet they don't want no Pastor they
[1:26:43] don't want no teacher no evangelist come
[1:26:45] on somebody then you've got other folks
[1:26:47] in the message all they want is just
[1:26:48] their Pastor own it they don't want no
[1:26:50] that well if brother Donnie ain't going
[1:26:52] it's another Dollywood weekend we're
[1:26:55] going out of town they're just as bad as
[1:26:58] the eye people are but you know what if
[1:27:01] God put teachers in the church I'd say
[1:27:03] we need them if God put evangelists in
[1:27:06] the church I say we need them if God
[1:27:09] gave me a hand I need it God gave me an
[1:27:11] eye I need it come on somebody if God
[1:27:14] placed you in a body you are important
[1:27:17] and nobody can take your
[1:27:21] place
[1:27:28] the eye cannot say unto the hand I have
[1:27:31] no need of thee nor again the head to
[1:27:35] the feet I have no need of Thee the
[1:27:38] higher cannot
[1:27:40] dispense of the
[1:27:44] Lord now are there members in our body
[1:27:48] naturally and in our body
[1:27:51] spiritually
[1:27:52] that vary in degree of course they are
[1:27:55] notice Paul says in verse 22 nay much
[1:27:58] more those members of the body which we
[1:28:01] seem to be more
[1:28:03] feeble are
[1:28:07] necessary look at that word more needful
[1:28:10] what one cannot
[1:28:13] do
[1:28:15] without so they seem to be more feeble
[1:28:19] than others so they're not
[1:28:22] they don't consist of a bony
[1:28:28] material so you look at your heart how
[1:28:31] many bones are in
[1:28:34] it how many is in your brain or some of
[1:28:37] you been called bone head before but
[1:28:39] actually there ain't no bones in your
[1:28:42] brain look how vulnerable your brain is
[1:28:46] what if God only surrounded it with
[1:28:48] fatty tissue down here like your belly
[1:28:51] is
[1:28:52] what did God do with that brain the
[1:28:54] control s Center he put it inside of a
[1:29:00] skull why it's so
[1:29:05] vulnerable yet you can't breathe you
[1:29:08] can't blink you can't think you can't
[1:29:11] operate without it and itself is so
[1:29:15] vulnerable God had to put it inside this
[1:29:18] sheath called a skull
[1:29:24] don't you understand no matter how great
[1:29:26] the preacher is how great a Ministry any
[1:29:30] man's got he still has an element of
[1:29:33] vulnerability about him and God may
[1:29:36] choose some of you to try to get around
[1:29:39] that man and try to pray for him and
[1:29:42] nudge him along if there's anybody
[1:29:44] that's going to be discouraged I'll tell
[1:29:45] you one thing it's going to be a
[1:29:47] preacher especially a pastor I left here
[1:29:51] Sunday and I told girl I hope I hope
[1:29:55] I'll be able before too long to be able
[1:29:58] to sit down and quit preaching and quit
[1:30:00] dealing with people's problems and
[1:30:03] people's issues and people's
[1:30:07] complaints she said you think that'll
[1:30:09] ever happen I said no but I can
[1:30:15] hope all L some of you skulls help
[1:30:19] me some of you bone head
[1:30:26] so you see God doesn't put everything in
[1:30:29] behind the
[1:30:31] skull but some things he takes a tissue
[1:30:35] a muscle a senu and he wraps around
[1:30:40] it oh
[1:30:42] my and yet these are
[1:30:47] necessary look at your main
[1:30:50] torso look at at your heart in order to
[1:30:54] do open heart
[1:30:55] surgery what do they do they take a saw
[1:30:59] and cut you right here and open that up
[1:31:03] pull that rib cage
[1:31:05] apart in order to get to your
[1:31:09] heart CA your heart the
[1:31:13] pump but if God would have put your
[1:31:16] heart down here with no bones no caves
[1:31:19] to protect it anybody come up and hit
[1:31:22] you right in the belly and boy your
[1:31:25] heart but
[1:31:27] stop and yet it's so
[1:31:30] important and yet so
[1:31:33] vulnerable I hope somebody is hearing me
[1:31:36] tonight I know some of y'all sitting
[1:31:38] there right now trying to figure out if
[1:31:40] you're a large intestine or a small
[1:31:41] intestine or if you're trying to figure
[1:31:43] out what in the world am I don't make
[1:31:45] yourself sick now let's just let's just
[1:31:47] go on to the spiritual side remember if
[1:31:49] God placed you in the body of Christ
[1:31:51] that there is no one that can take your
[1:31:54] place I'm going to drive that home
[1:31:56] tonight and you may get sick of hearing
[1:31:58] me say it but there ain't nobody in this
[1:32:00] church can take your place you may never
[1:32:02] climb up on this platform and sing a
[1:32:05] song you may never stand up here and
[1:32:07] testify but if God plac you Among Us my
[1:32:10] brother sister you are needed and nobody
[1:32:14] will ever take your place not only here
[1:32:16] but walking down streets of gold he has
[1:32:19] got a place for you he's got a mention
[1:32:22] for you a body waiting and you are
[1:32:24] important to God and if you're important
[1:32:27] to God you're important to
[1:32:30] [Applause]
[1:32:37] us
[1:32:39] actually there's parts of our
[1:32:42] body we can
[1:32:45] live if they were
[1:32:49] removed so if something happen happened
[1:32:51] to my
[1:32:54] arm and I had to have it
[1:32:56] amputated from here
[1:33:01] down I wouldn't like
[1:33:03] it but I could live without
[1:33:06] it
[1:33:08] right you ever had or heard of anybody
[1:33:10] having their brain amputated as many of
[1:33:12] few folks I've talked to that I have
[1:33:14] wondered that before I mean I'm just
[1:33:16] kidding can you imagine having your
[1:33:18] heart
[1:33:20] amputated you can have toes removed you
[1:33:23] can have legs removed I saw a picture of
[1:33:26] the other day of a man who had the
[1:33:28] world's first
[1:33:31] head
[1:33:33] transplant the whole
[1:33:36] head you ever see the picture of the man
[1:33:38] who got the first face
[1:33:42] transplant so there's things you could
[1:33:45] live
[1:33:48] without but there's things about us
[1:33:52] that we cannot
[1:33:53] survive
[1:33:57] without let me ask you this who do we
[1:34:02] pray the most
[1:34:04] for the
[1:34:06] sick or the
[1:34:10] well
[1:34:13] huh that's why some of y'all don't pray
[1:34:15] for me no more you you think I'm well
[1:34:16] all the time you think I'm up on the
[1:34:18] mountain all the time you ought to come
[1:34:20] live with me for four or five
[1:34:22] days you'd realize I ain't on the
[1:34:24] mountain all the time you'd realize a
[1:34:26] little bit of the burden that Carol and
[1:34:28] I pack you'd pray for us a whole lot
[1:34:31] more fervent than you do but you're
[1:34:33] thinking oh brother Donnie has breakfast
[1:34:36] with angels I don't even like
[1:34:38] breakfast oh he must just soar in
[1:34:40] Heavenly places I do do that but you not
[1:34:43] believe the devil's out of hell that I
[1:34:45] have to fight when I come down either
[1:34:46] you know what I'm talking about you all
[1:34:48] do the same thing except I just do it in
[1:34:50] a different degree that's all it's the
[1:34:52] same thing and yet we think well brother
[1:34:54] boy brother Daryl he must be man alive
[1:34:56] these preacher Brothers a must just be
[1:34:58] up on the mountain all the time if you
[1:35:00] only knew so we tend to pray for those
[1:35:02] that would say well poor brother so and
[1:35:04] so you know he's got this bad lumbago
[1:35:06] and got this that other a lot of folks
[1:35:08] that's not just their lomago it's their
[1:35:09] attitude and that's they're always down
[1:35:11] the bot you know always down on the
[1:35:13] bottom never nothing nothing nothing
[1:35:15] ever good everything is always so bad
[1:35:18] and we take that person how are you
[1:35:20] brother glory to God Hallelujah I'm more
[1:35:22] than a conqueror I'm an overcomer in
[1:35:24] Christ Jesus say well I don't need to
[1:35:26] pray for that guy he's on the mountain
[1:35:27] every time I see don't you understand
[1:35:29] whenever you see an actor don't you
[1:35:31] understand whenever you're running into
[1:35:33] somebody whose confession is more
[1:35:35] powerful than the negativity that
[1:35:36] they're in and we will take that but
[1:35:39] sometimes God ever put it on your heart
[1:35:41] to pray for somebody that you think is
[1:35:42] so strong and you think why in the world
[1:35:45] am I praying for that person they are so
[1:35:47] strong well God knows that strong person
[1:35:50] needs a whole lot of extra prayer at the
[1:35:52] time notice Paul said those members of
[1:35:55] the body which we think to be less
[1:35:59] honorable upon these we
[1:36:02] bestow more abundant honor to place
[1:36:05] around to set about to put on a garment
[1:36:09] or to put or bind a thing around another
[1:36:14] so those which we consider to be less
[1:36:17] honorable upon these we bestow more
[1:36:20] abundant honor and honor uncomely Parts
[1:36:24] have more abundant
[1:36:27] comeliness
[1:36:29] huh so in other words we put
[1:36:32] clothes on parts of our
[1:36:35] body that we consider uncomely and not
[1:36:39] supposed to be seen in
[1:36:44] public
[1:36:46] uhhuh
[1:36:48] uhhuh now it's easy to see but the L to
[1:36:51] say AIDS apparently they don't consider
[1:36:53] much of their body uncomely cuz theyve
[1:36:56] just about took everything
[1:36:58] off but you see those who s modest and
[1:37:02] if you're filled with the Holy Ghost you
[1:37:03] are modest but you realize that parts of
[1:37:07] your body are to be
[1:37:10] covered why because of the uncomn but
[1:37:14] when you look at it in the right way you
[1:37:16] put more abundant Honor on those parts
[1:37:21] by putting clothing on it amen so you
[1:37:25] pay $150 for a suit you brothers are
[1:37:28] $29.95 for slacks oh I'm sorry I need to
[1:37:31] update that sh they because of inflation
[1:37:33] now $21 slacks have come from China four
[1:37:36] years ago now it's worth $75 and they're
[1:37:39] they're less
[1:37:41] quality uh and because of that then you
[1:37:43] put that $75 pair of pants or dress
[1:37:46] whatever it is sister and you will cover
[1:37:48] up that part which you consider uncomely
[1:37:52] which should not be seen in public and
[1:37:55] you put and people say what a pretty
[1:37:59] dress well brother that is the nicest
[1:38:02] suit I really like that shirt that tie
[1:38:05] looks so
[1:38:07] nice anybody ever tell you what nice
[1:38:10] skin you've got on your
[1:38:12] finger that is some of the prettiest
[1:38:14] skin I believe I ever seen in my
[1:38:17] life but watch what'll happen in the
[1:38:19] winter time and say you find your a real
[1:38:21] pretty black pair of gloves sisters and
[1:38:23] they got them little fancy pearls on the
[1:38:25] side of it and and sisters will see you
[1:38:27] out there at the door you come in and
[1:38:28] say them the Prest gloves well they
[1:38:31] didn't say nothing about your hands what
[1:38:33] is what's it doing so whenever we put it
[1:38:36] on there what's it for it's we are
[1:38:39] hiding because of modesty something that
[1:38:42] we know feel like needs to be covered up
[1:38:45] and then when we do that it actually
[1:38:47] brings more honor upon the uncom part if
[1:38:51] folks can only get that right about
[1:38:53] dressing right and dressing Godly and
[1:38:55] dressing holy don't you understand when
[1:38:57] you do that look how God looks at it my
[1:39:01] daughters are doing exactly what I want
[1:39:04] them to do and I will give them more
[1:39:07] glory and more
[1:39:13] honor praise the
[1:39:16] Lord
[1:39:17] oh
[1:39:19] Hallelujah so you see by doing that we
[1:39:23] make it that way now remember of course
[1:39:25] this is the first century whenever this
[1:39:26] is being written and the Pagan world was
[1:39:30] awful absolutely
[1:39:33] awful
[1:39:34] especially in the sports
[1:39:39] Arenas now Rome was famous of course and
[1:39:42] I've stood in some of those Arenas
[1:39:44] around the world built by the ancient
[1:39:48] Romans and when they would wrestle many
[1:39:50] times they would take off every Stitch
[1:39:53] of their
[1:39:55] clothes because it was
[1:39:58] heathenism to do it in
[1:40:01] public
[1:40:04] hello testing one two testing one
[1:40:07] to so you imagine then how that some of
[1:40:11] these were former Gentiles these
[1:40:14] Corinthians and Paul is telling them
[1:40:15] about dressing and hair and so on and
[1:40:17] they're thinking what in the world this
[1:40:19] was so different than in the way they
[1:40:21] were raised because they were raised so
[1:40:24] they would go to a Roman Coliseum and
[1:40:26] many of those Gladiators and so on I
[1:40:28] mean they be Stark
[1:40:31] naked out there wrestling and carrying
[1:40:33] on why
[1:40:37] heathenism it was part of the
[1:40:45] entertainment must be some Romans in
[1:40:49] Hollywood well praise the Lord my
[1:40:53] goodness friends you know what I'm
[1:40:54] talking about you can't even hard to
[1:40:55] walk up to a Walmart cash you know to be
[1:40:57] able to pay out in the cash register
[1:40:58] without nudity to being expressed on the
[1:41:00] magazine don't sit there and look at me
[1:41:01] like you don't what I'm talking about
[1:41:04] why it's everywhere it's all around us
[1:41:06] everywhere why a billboard there's only
[1:41:07] one way you can look up where you don't
[1:41:09] see and that's up this way why because
[1:41:13] people don't see it they just don't
[1:41:15] understand there's no modesty there's no
[1:41:18] difference between right and wrong and
[1:41:20] being able to to see it you're so
[1:41:23] blessed if you
[1:41:27] do verse 24 and we'll close for our
[1:41:31] comely
[1:41:33] Parts have no
[1:41:36] need
[1:41:38] huh so our comely
[1:41:40] Parts have no
[1:41:42] need
[1:41:44] so what do you
[1:41:46] think said I start coming out like this
[1:41:53] I tell Carol all the time I've told her
[1:41:55] years ago I need me a mask so whenever I
[1:41:59] go out I don't get seen by everybody you
[1:42:01] don't know what it's like to go through
[1:42:02] a drive-thru and people say I've seen
[1:42:04] you
[1:42:08] before my face is ugly okay but it's the
[1:42:10] only one I've got I'm not handsome like
[1:42:13] some of you
[1:42:14] brothers so I'm just stuck with what I
[1:42:16] have so you pray for my wife for that
[1:42:18] cause of course but apparently there's
[1:42:22] no
[1:42:23] immodesty about me showing this thing
[1:42:26] and you're wondering how
[1:42:28] not how could you not
[1:42:32] be
[1:42:33] but because of that I do not need to
[1:42:37] cover it I know the government said that
[1:42:39] we should wear them mask and they done
[1:42:41] proved it over and over again it's like
[1:42:43] a bumblebee flying through a woen wire
[1:42:45] fence come to find out all it done was
[1:42:48] smothered us all and choked us down real
[1:42:49] bad
[1:42:51] but our Comm Parts have no need for God
[1:42:55] hath
[1:42:57] tempered the body together having give
[1:43:01] more abundant honor to that which
[1:43:05] lacked look at the word tempered to mix
[1:43:10] together
[1:43:11] cingle
[1:43:13] unite call several parts to combine into
[1:43:17] an
[1:43:18] organic structure
[1:43:21] which is the body to unite one thing to
[1:43:28] another wow so God calls us the great
[1:43:32] the
[1:43:34] mighty and those which don't seem very
[1:43:36] important at all God co- mingles them
[1:43:40] together and puts them in one unit
[1:43:42] called the
[1:43:45] ministry God does the same thing in the
[1:43:47] church God does many times the same
[1:43:49] thing in a family look at Abraham great
[1:43:52] Abraham patriarchal face look at
[1:43:56] Isaac son of a great man father of a
[1:44:00] great man but Isaac not so
[1:44:04] much right so here is a man that we
[1:44:08] hardly have enough you ever notice that
[1:44:09] there's no no Hollywood don't even make
[1:44:11] movies about Isaac himself there's not
[1:44:14] much to say about him it'd be about a
[1:44:16] 15minute movie it' be about all this but
[1:44:19] look at Abraham one after another after
[1:44:22] another Jacob Joseph look at all them
[1:44:24] but you know what God has Isaac's slid
[1:44:28] in between Abraham's and Jacob's but was
[1:44:32] Isaac necessary yet God wrote The
[1:44:34] Mystery of his life about him and the
[1:44:37] bride was Isaac and Rebecca praise be to
[1:44:41] God and you may look at yourself and say
[1:44:43] well I'm not a great person I no but you
[1:44:46] might be the mother or the father of a
[1:44:48] great person or the grand mother of a
[1:44:51] grandfather something like that of a
[1:44:53] great person and yet God tied you right
[1:44:55] in that seed line oh I've never really
[1:44:58] done much for God but you might be the
[1:44:59] very one that would testify to somebody
[1:45:02] about the message of the hour and that
[1:45:04] one man would come to God and he' be
[1:45:06] called to preach and maybe lead 10,000
[1:45:09] to Jesus Christ and when he stands there
[1:45:11] that day guess who's going to stand by
[1:45:14] you are because you packed the word to
[1:45:17] him and you God used you to help open
[1:45:21] his eyes and God would incorporate your
[1:45:24] name with those 10,000 that were
[1:45:26] saved somebody that was seemingly
[1:45:30] unnecessary overlooked not really
[1:45:33] important in the body if God put you in
[1:45:37] the body you are
[1:45:47] important let me read one more verse I
[1:45:50] didn't say I was done I just told you to
[1:45:52] stand up that's all for our commy parts
[1:45:54] have no need but God has tempered the
[1:45:57] body together having given more abundant
[1:46:01] honor to that part which
[1:46:05] lacked verse 25 that there should be no
[1:46:12] Schism in the body but that the members
[1:46:15] should have the same care for one
[1:46:19] another look at this powerful powerful
[1:46:22] word
[1:46:23] Schism
[1:46:25] division a
[1:46:28] rent metaphorically it's a division or A
[1:46:37] dissension H how does that work exactly
[1:46:39] why would God why would Paul write that
[1:46:41] after saying that about the body because
[1:46:44] if you got people in the body they feel
[1:46:46] like they're not being used and they're
[1:46:48] don't don't amount to much they become
[1:46:52] Restless then an opportunist will try to
[1:46:55] get among
[1:46:56] them and offer them a
[1:46:59] position don't necessarily mean it's a
[1:47:01] god position but just a
[1:47:04] position I've seen it for
[1:47:06] years people will walk away from the
[1:47:09] word of God from a church that's
[1:47:11] preaching the word and preaching
[1:47:13] rapturing message and will trade off to
[1:47:16] get a position in a church that will not
[1:47:18] get them 6 Ines off the ground
[1:47:22] but position to many people is
[1:47:30] Everything Jesus didn't say man shall
[1:47:32] live by position but man shall not live
[1:47:36] by bread but by every word that
[1:47:38] proceedeth out of the mouth of God now
[1:47:40] for me I'd rather go to church if I was
[1:47:42] in the will of God and I sat there and
[1:47:44] nobody hard even knew my name I wouldn't
[1:47:46] hardly recognized by the Deacon board
[1:47:48] the trustee board or no other board
[1:47:50] but that's where God put me and I
[1:47:52] clapped my hands and I sang and I did
[1:47:54] everything maybe I couldn't even be a
[1:47:55] special singer CU I was off key half the
[1:47:57] time but I'd rather be that than to be
[1:48:00] in the biggest church and the preacher
[1:48:02] calling my name and me his best best
[1:48:04] buddy and best pal to be where God wants
[1:48:08] me to
[1:48:09] be what's it worth my
[1:48:12] friends what's it
[1:48:14] worse don't you love him tonight again
[1:48:18] Romans 16:17 Paul said I beseech you
[1:48:21] Brethren mark them which caus divisions
[1:48:26] and offenses contrary to the doctrine
[1:48:29] which he have learned a lot of people
[1:48:31] have never learned these last three
[1:48:34] words and avoid them you mean that were
[1:48:39] already starting then that actually
[1:48:41] started before Paul ever wrote This Book
[1:48:43] of Romans around 63 ad so it had started
[1:48:46] 30 years prior to that
[1:48:48] already and Satan is still doing the
[1:48:51] same thing today he'll try to do it in
[1:48:53] your home he'll try to do it in your job
[1:48:56] he loves division you notice how it is
[1:48:58] maybe one person in in the section where
[1:49:00] you're working and they just constantly
[1:49:03] have got something going all the time
[1:49:05] you get that settled and they do
[1:49:07] something else some people never live in
[1:49:09] peace I've got the answer
[1:49:12] why because they do not have peace
[1:49:15] within
[1:49:17] themselves and you watch trouble
[1:49:21] people troubled people have one thing in
[1:49:24] common whether red white black yellow
[1:49:27] pink purple polka doted or green and
[1:49:29] white striped they all have one thing in
[1:49:32] common troubled people cause
[1:49:36] trouble they generate it I'm not talking
[1:49:40] about a person that gets into trouble
[1:49:41] and gets out and learns by it but
[1:49:44] troubled people constantly generate
[1:49:49] trouble
[1:49:50] and you get one thing fixed and they
[1:49:52] call something else if you get that
[1:49:53] fixed they call something else it's just
[1:49:55] like they're a Dynamo of
[1:49:59] trouble Jesus said blessed are the
[1:50:03] peacemakers for they shall be
[1:50:06] called children of God you ever find a
[1:50:09] beatitude where He blesses
[1:50:11] troublemakers whether it's in a family
[1:50:13] or a church or a shop or whatever it is
[1:50:16] you never find a beatitude for the
[1:50:19] troublemakers
[1:50:21] wouldn't you love for that to be your
[1:50:23] identity blessed are the peacemakers he
[1:50:27] never did say blessed are the handsome
[1:50:30] blessed are the pretty blessed are the
[1:50:34] wealthy but blessed are the peacemakers
[1:50:38] for they shall be called the children of
[1:50:43] God to me you couldn't be called nothing
[1:50:44] no
[1:50:46] greater oh don't you love him
[1:50:49] tonight
[1:50:50] let bow our it
[1:50:55] together oh Father how we love
[1:50:59] you we thank you Lord for your
[1:51:03] spirit how you've pulled us into the
[1:51:07] body and made us part of that great
[1:51:10] Union the mystical
[1:51:14] Christ then Lord we don't want to just
[1:51:17] focus on that alone but we also want to
[1:51:20] find
[1:51:21] out our position in the local
[1:51:24] body in the local
[1:51:27] assembly May every person here tonight
[1:51:30] and those that have streamed the
[1:51:32] service may they be able to accept and
[1:51:37] realize you have always had
[1:51:41] degrees and your Prophet tells us there
[1:51:43] will be degrees in
[1:51:46] heaven it won't bother people then
[1:51:49] because the part that bothers us now
[1:51:51] will be absent
[1:51:52] there so there will be people that will
[1:51:56] be
[1:51:58] recognized as more beneficial on the
[1:52:02] earth we know
[1:52:05] whenever the rewards are given out it
[1:52:08] will reflect that
[1:52:10] diversity Lord I pray you'd help each of
[1:52:13] us that we can find our spot in the
[1:52:17] body and be happy with it
[1:52:22] Lord Oh Lord God I I ask for every man
[1:52:27] woman boy and
[1:52:30] girl that we can be used by you Lord not
[1:52:35] for our purpose for our
[1:52:38] desire but for the economy of
[1:52:41] God I think Lord if we could all just
[1:52:45] fall more in love with
[1:52:47] you a lot of these things would
[1:52:50] disappear
[1:52:51] anyway because we would just love you so
[1:52:55] much your Prophet tells us in the church
[1:52:58] book Church age book that you may
[1:53:01] appoint some to
[1:53:04] death you appoint others to suffer and
[1:53:07] go through so much
[1:53:10] stuff but that is your prerogative to do
[1:53:14] so there are some that will go through
[1:53:17] such suffering in this life
[1:53:22] some will pray and believe and expect
[1:53:25] miracles but instead you'll take them
[1:53:29] out of this
[1:53:30] life with the sickness or the disease
[1:53:34] that they dealt with for
[1:53:35] years
[1:53:37] others they'll be prayed for you'll
[1:53:40] grant them
[1:53:42] healing but there's got to be
[1:53:46] somebody that can be able to express
[1:53:48] that attribute that you
[1:53:51] expressed when you come to the Earth
[1:53:55] your character was
[1:53:57] perfected by
[1:53:59] suffering not by Miracles not by
[1:54:02] signs not by screaming running and we
[1:54:05] believe in all of that but your
[1:54:08] character was perfected by
[1:54:12] suffering help us Lord
[1:54:15] God that we can find that place you want
[1:54:18] us to be
[1:54:20] and may we stay
[1:54:22] so in the Divine solution of
[1:54:27] God that we don't just get a little dip
[1:54:30] and we go down a dry cucumber and come
[1:54:32] up a wet one but we go down a dry
[1:54:36] cucumber and come up a
