when the life I built Came Crashing to the ground when the friends I had were nowhere to be found I couldn't see it then but I can see it now there was [Music] Jesus in the waiting in the searching in the healing and the hurting like a blessing buried in the broken pieces every minute every moment where I be where I'm going even when I didn't know it or couldn't see it there was [Music] Jesus for this man who needs amazing kind of Grace for forgiveness at a price I couldn't pay oh I'm not perfect so I thank God every day there was Jesus there was Jesus in the waiting in the searching in the healing and the hurting like a blessing bured in the broken pieces [Music] every minute every moment where I've been where I'm going even when I didn't know it I couldn't see it there was Jesus on the mountains in The Valleys there was Jesus in the sh of the alley there was Jesus in the fire the there was Jesus always is and always no I never walk alone walk you're in the waiting in the seing in the heing and the hurting like a blessing bured in the broken pie every minute every moment where I've been and where I'm going even when I didn't know didn't see it there was Jesus there was Jesus there was Jesus there was [Applause] Jesus for on a bony of space stepped a pure and holy God and in awesome Solitude he stood alone not one faint star to give him light just just endless rolling Blackest Night but somehow through all the darkness he could see he saw mountains high and lofty he saw Val is Lush and green babbling Brooks and while flowers growing even her a robin sing but he felt to strange compassion as close to love as pain could be standing out there in tomorrow he saw me he saw me and and his likeness he so me like him Pure Clean and holy spotless white within but he saw me Bound in heavy chains and long to set me free but he knew if I became like him he must become like me [Music] so Jesus Paid It [Laughter] all all to him I ow sin had left a cron stain but he was it wide as [Music] snow oh Jesus Paid It all all to him I ow sin had left a crms sun stain but he was it wi as snow thank you Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord I'm so glad that he paid the debt that I couldn't pay I owed it I was guilty but he took my place standing there that day before Pilate pilate said which shall I release unto you Jesus which is called the Christ or Jesus barabus which shall I release unto you and no doubt Jesus said father let him have barabus because he knew that the only way barabus could ever become him he would have to become barabus the only way that we could ever be like him he had to become one of us and bore our sins aren't you grateful for that yes I'm so happy tonight to know what he's done for us am may the Lord bless you richly if you count of an honor to be with you and to be home and once again we want to say we thank you for all the kindness you showed my family during the loss of my my sister Judy and we certainly appreciate that it's not forgotten even many years ago when the accident of Homer and Rachel and Jessica being hurt so bad and we have never forgot all the kindness and all that you've done for us then and it's just as brother David preached the other night we just need each other so much and I you know we're I'm convinced God created the body that way so that we would depend on one another so thank you so much and we appreciate the opportunity to speak to you this evening if you have your Bibles turn with us to the Book of Revelations want to read from Revelations 3: 20 just this one verse we trust that what we have to say tonight will be a blessing to you it's kind of short knowing it's communion night and so we won't be long at all but yet we want to take our time time too but we just pray the Lord will just speak to our hearts and uh that the things that we say would be more than just words but it would be reality in the heart of every believer amen praise the Lord do you love him yeah Revelations 3:20 the Bible says this behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will suck with him I will come into him and Su with him and he with me now that Su is actually supper we know that and supper is a light meal served late in the evening supper is always an evening meal and notice he didn't say I'll be knocking at the door at breakfast time or at lunchtime but at supper time at supper time let us bow our heads I want to speak to you this even for just a few minutes on a true communion Heavenly Father Lord is with great joy in our hearts that we can call you father for Lord we are so grateful for what you have done for for us in this hour for Lord truly in this time of great Darkness you have shown your light Lord to lead us for this we are most grateful and father we are so thankful tonight for all that you've given us in this hour for you have not left us comfortless for you said you would be with us that you would never leave us nor would you forsake us then Lord we come to realize that no matter what we face in life we do not have to face it alone and for this we are grateful Lord we pray that this evening in this communion service may it be a time of reconsecration a time of rededication may it be a time of Revelation Lord that we could see oursel more clearer through the image the mirror of your word Lord and father God May these things as I said not just be words but may they drop into our hearts Lord and produce Dear God that which you send it to do for it's the evening time and the manifestation of the sons of God and Lord It's the revelation of who we are and what it is you wanted to accomplish and Lord I pray in the communion service we know it's a time of healing father I ask in the name of Jesus that everyone that partakes of this communion tonight may they be healed Lord and those that are unable to come because of the viruses and different things that are going around I pray in the name of Jesus May the Holy Spirit go to them tonight Lord and deliver them for thou art the Creator and sustainer of our lives and Lord we believe you are our healer and we look to you bless your children tonight father receive honor and Glory unto thyself for we ask these things in jesus' name and the bride says amen amen God bless you you may be seated now this scripture that we just read here in Revelations it's the words of Christ himself after his resurrection and he speaking to the last Church age he is speaking to the last Church age so that's telling us that he's actually speaking to us he's speaking to us in this hour so we know that no matter what man has tried to do they have not been able to silence the voice of God they can explain him way scientifically him way but they can never stop that voice amen so after his resurrection now he's speaking to the last Church age now we know there are seven Church ages and at the first church age Jesus was walking among the seven golden candlesticks so we find in the first church ages he's walking among the candlesticks but this church age in this leosa age which is the last Church age he's on the outside trying to get in to his own church and what does it show us it shows us what this age has done this nation this world has become almost to totally a Godless Nation a Godless world but notice in this last age he doesn't come in the morning he doesn't come in the noon time but he comes at supper time he comes in the evening time it's in the evening time that he begins to manifest himself to get back into his church he doesn't want to get back into an organization he doesn't want to get back into a Creed he doesn't want to get back into some man's ideal he doesn't want to get back into some man that wears a a dress come on somebody but what does he wanting to do he's wanting to get back not just into a church not just into a church but he wants to get into his own church oh that's a big difference amen there's churches churches Brides churches Brides but there's got to come one amen and that's the one that he's interested in tonight he wants to get back in his own church amen now tonight we have set aside this service for a communion service now Union as we all know is where we partake of the bread and of the wine and foot washing it's a time that we examine ourselves it's a time that of reconsecration and looking at our lives now we do this because Jesus commanded that we should do this in remembrance of him that's that's right I know it's Saturday but we can Amen on Saturday too it's all right amen now we realize that this bread is not the literal body as some teach but it is a symbolic it represents his body and the wine is not his literal blood but it's symbolic of his blood that he shed for us and in a little while when we partake of this bread and this wine you will become one with it because you will consume it as you take it into your mouth and consume it and swallow it there you and this bread you and this wine will become one and we call this communion but for a few minutes this evening I want to speak to you on not just communion but on a true communion to remind you amen we do this to remind you that that what we do in symbolic form what we do tonight in symbolic form is what God wants to do in reality in each of of Our Lives God just doesn't want us to consume bread and consume wine but he wants to get into us tonight amen he wants to do it in each of Our Lives brother R said that Jacob wrestled all night and he wouldn't turn him loose until he blessed him that's right he battled for life and after the battle is over then God gives you of himself and that is true communion true communion that little bread and that little wafer it just represents it but God gives you of himself and that is true communion God gives you of himself and that is true communion the bread and the wine it just represents that but what God actually wants to give us is himself is himself that's true communion now go with me for a few minutes let's go back in time before there was even time before there was the world before there was a universe before there was a moon but before there were stars there was this being the self-existing one we know him as God but he really wasn't God yet because God is an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him he was God but he wasn't God in that manner as we know that and God had all these attributes that he wanted to express he desired to express them he wanted to express himself as a Healer he wanted to express himself as a savior he wanted to express himself as a redeemer as a father as a husband as a son he wanted to express himself in a body of Believers called his church let me say that again he just didn't want desire to express himself as a Healer but he actually desired to express himself in a body of people called called the church or the bride if you will now the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 6:16 and what agreement with we with with what agreement have the temple of God with Idols what agreement does the temple of God have with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God that's what the Bible says well I don't feel like it he didn't say if you failed it he said did you believe it [Music] what do we have to do with Idols what does the temple of God have to do with Idols ye are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and I will walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people hallelujah hallelujah notice God's desire is not just to be above his people not just to be with his people but his desire is to be in his people amen for he said I will dwell not with them he didn't say I will dwell with them but he said I will dwell in them am he didn't say he'd walk with them but he said he would walk in [Music] them makes you kind of wonder what Enoch's walk really was well Glory I will walk not with them but in them you know brother bosw asked brother B said you know brother B do you know what Fellowship is he said oh I think so brother Bosworth what is fellowship he said fellowships is to fellows in one ship now to Fellowship means commune for commune and fellowship is actually an interchangeable word Two Fellas in one ship Two Fellas in one ship not Two Fellas in two ships in one sea but Two Fellas in one ship God the Creator living and walking in his creation Oh Glory to God I hope we can catch that tonight to see who we are in according to his word not what the world says we are not what we think about ourselves but what God thinks about us it's time we start saying what the word says amen we need to get away from this negative stuff well come on somebody well I don't know if I can make it or not let me tell you according to God we've already made it amen we are his people this was God's desire this is what God desired this is what God wanted to achieve Hallelujah he can create planets but what goods a planet without somebody own it this is what God desired God the Creator living and walking in his creation amen you see when you're born a new by the Holy Spirit he can only look upon you as perfect let me say that again when you're born a new by the Holy Spirit he can only look upon you as perfect cuz he did it himself and you are his workmanship and in case you don't know it God Don't Make No Junk the bride is perfect because she's created by a perfect God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah he did it himself you are his workmanship because God by his Mercy brought you into Christ and to fellowship and to look upon as a perfect work of his own I brought him he said I presented him to the blood and there's nothing wrong with my work he said you are God's workmanship amen you are God's workmanship and all of God's works is perfect what did he say when he created it it's good amen a perfect God walking in his perfect creation amen wow amen maybe it's strange to you I don't know but it sounds good to me well brother Daryl but you don't understand I've got this and I've got that but you see he don't see you he only sees the blood and the blood speaks better things for us than we can ever speak for herself I'm not trusting in my ability I'm not trusting in my education God I'm not even trusting in my gift as an evangelist I'm trusting in the blood of the Lamb of God Amen that speaks for me when I cannot speak for myself he speaks for me amen he sees you as perfect because it was a perfect sacrifice and God looks at our sacrifice said how many Christians are here raise your hand yes sir well there's a few praise the Lord amen he said you're not a Christian by your desire right I know that chokes a lot of people because they think bless God I've done it myself no no you are not a Christian by your desire you're a Christian by God's desire no man can come to me except my father draws him first you was elected by God before the foundation of the world to be a Christian think of that God never thought of me as lost God didn't think one thing of you and then change his mind come on somebody before you was ever born before your grandparents was born God knew the color of your eyes he knew the color of your skin he knew what your name would be he knows everything about you Hallelujah before my great great great great grandparents was ever born God done wrote my name in his book and he waited in love he waited in love till I could manifest on the earth and he said there's my son he was elected by God before the foundation of the world to be a Christian I wouldn't elected to be a drunk uhhuh I wasn't elected to be a Methodist or a Catholic or a presbyterian come on somebody I was elected to be a [Music] Christian amen you see before the foundation of the world God thought of you as an instrument or a Channel or as we used to say in surgery as a conduit a conduit is a channel where something can flow through before the foundation of the world God thought of you as an instrument a channel something that he wanted to do through you something that he wanted to accomplish in you you see he made us a co-partner of his plan well should made me an amen tape tonight I preach an amen too but that's all right amen amen you see brother sister you didn't stagger into this message you didn't have to find this message on know God predestinated you for such a time as this he could have put me in Luther's day he going to put me in Wesley's day he could to put me in the Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts but God said I'm going to put him in that age because it's that age that I will reveal the secrets of my heart to my people that they may know who I am that they may know who they are amen hallelujah hallelujah God predestinated you for such a time this season this hour I want you to understand tonight God came looking for you the Bible says in Isaiah 62:12 and they shall call them the holy people what makes us holy a holy God living in us they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the Lord anybody here like that tonight then who's he talking to he's talking to you they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the Lord and thou shalt be called Thou shalt be called sought out sought out they will be known as a people who are salt out a salt out people a city not forsaken my God ought to make a Baptist shout tonight he's talking about us the redeemed of the Lord Thou shalt be called shout out who do you think's looking for us when the first Sun fell who come looking for him he didn't send an angel God himself came down in the cool of the evening crying Adam where are thou God come looking for his first lost son who comes looking for ever lost son God does he came looking for me Hallelujah he passed over millions to come to you should call him the redeemed of the Lord Lord that Shall be Called sought out a city not forsaken you see a city I've been in all kinds of cities they all have red lights they all have sidewalks they all have stop signs they all have McDonald's so if you just looked at the sidewalk in the McDonald's and the red light they all look the same but what makes Charlotte different from Baltimore what makes Baltimore different from Atlanta what makes Lanta different from hardy hardy different from Johnson City it's not the sidewalks it's not the McDonald's it's the people that are in it for the city takes on the character of the people and he's talking about this city is a not forsaken City it's because there's a people who dwells in this city who is not forsaken by their God Amen he came looking for you he came knocking for you why why was he knocking because he loves you the prophet said that's the reason the knock comes is because he loves you has he knocked on your door why did he knock on your door brother John cuz he loves you cuz he loves you that make you want to sit in the corner and just cry somewhere because he loves you amen amen when he knocks he wants to give you something the best thing that could be given that's eternal life that's the reason of his knocking amen I stand and knock If any man will open I'll come into him he'll I'll suck with him and he with me he wants to heal you he wants to forgive your sins he wants to do something good for you that's God's desire told the story of the Old Violin you don't heard the story St I know but to me it's more than just a story to fill up space on the tape to me he's trying to relay something to us something he wants us to understand and he tells the story of the old vience said there was an auction one time and they got up this old fill on old valin and the auctioner said what am I offered for it who'll give me a price it didn't look like much the prophet said a little crummy Dusty perhaps had a few scars on Out Of Tune kind of sounds like I was when he found me and he couldn't even get a bid on it finally I think he said he might have got a bid of a dollar or something nobody wanted it it was worthless they made fun of it they laughed at it get it off the block we don't want that up here nobody wants that and there was one standing there that didn't think it ought to sell for that so he went and picked it up all right he picked up the violin he struck it in his hands and he picked up the bow and he rosined it and he be to play a tune let's say he played What a Mighty God Jesus is or perhaps there's a fountain filled with blood and when he begin to play everyone started crying they had never heard such music in their life and the auctioner caught the moment and he said now what am I offered 2,000 5,000 10,000 what they thought was worthless what they thought was worthless all of a sudden became Priceless and what the world laughs at and calls a cult a skirt Church trash on the internet they trash it on the internet they do not see the value of it but God says it's Priceless that's my workmanship Hallelujah amen amenu what was it the Master's Hand revealed what was veiled in the old instrument what was the difference the master of the Prophet said the one who knew it the one who built it he knew how to get out of it what was in it the violin was only the expression of the master who built it he had within himself all this music this certain sound the guitar couldn't make it the the drums couldn't make it it was a certain sound so he created a special instrument yeah that he could reflect that sound through amen he created an instrument he could express through that instrument what was in him he designed the violin he knew the sounds that he wanted it to make and when he picked it up and struck the bow across the strings the violin became the very inspiration of the master you see the music wasn't in the violin on the music was in the master the violin only expressed it you see the very heart the very Passion of the violinist was expressed through that violin he built that violin to be an instrument that he could express himself through and the violin of and the violin became one they were in true communion one with the other am I like that oh God Church can't you see tonight can't you see tonight that violin was you yes he just want to express himself through a pastor he just didn't want to express himself through a through a prophet he just didn't want to express himself through Christ but he chose to express himself through his bride amen he's come the evening time to gather you in him that he may Express himself the final voice to the final age God speaking through his bride like the violin when Jesus came on the earth he had no beauty that we should desire him but he was the instrument the means the body that God would Express the fullness of himself through Christ was the very Heart Of God expressed on the earth and Jesus said I and my father are one my father dwelleth in me you don't need know how much pler can that be I my father are one my father dwells in me amen where's your father I just told you I a father one my father dwelleth in me you can't read that any planer they said why don't you show us the father and it'll satisfy us and what did he say have I been with you so long and you don't know me when you see me you see my father true communion that's good true communion Amen brother Bram said a lady once jumped up and said why brother Brenham she said the father and the son are one just like you and your wife are one I said oh no they're not I said do you see me she said yes I said do you see my wife she said no I said then this is not the same kind of one Jesus said when you see me you've seen the Father the father dwelleth in me my wife don't dwell in me see they are one in every way they are one and we're one through agreement wife and I we're one in Fellowship but we're two personalities my wife can do one kind of thinking and me another and we're two persons but not so with God God in Christ is the selfs same person and when do we come to the realization that we can tell this world who wants to know where God is say when you see me you see my father for I am my father all right are one Jesus was God manifested In the Flesh the Bible said that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself the flesh part was man the spirit was God Jesus said I can do nothing except my father shows me first what is that true communion God and man one so would he doesn't even think his own thoughts [Music] let this mind be in let this mind be in you that's also in Christ who thought it not robbery to be equal with God he said let this mind be in you brother darl the world's lost his mind he wants you to lose your mind not to the world but to his word Jesus said I come to do my father's will In The Garden of Gethsemane he cried out not my will let thy will be done you see like the violin had no ability on its own no desire on its own had no thought on its own it was just an instrument and Jesus said I do nothing but that which I see my father do and all my father does I do likewise because we're one God don't tell me to do something and we have a debate he says that I do it the violin is the same way it has no ability on its own I've got a key that opens every door in this church but what good is a key without a hand it's just a key right that's the way the volum was it had no ability on its own it had no desire on its own it had no thought it was just an instrument but when the master picked it up the very life of the master was expressed through the violin and that's what he wants to do with you you take this microphone right here it's an absolute perfect total mute these speakers they are mute they're just speakers without a voice behind them they're just silent the means is there the ability is there but it takes a life amen hallelujah that's what he wants us to do take the microphone take these speakers they're mute they can't speak at all there's the organ all that beautiful music but tell it to play chainbreaker go ahead organ play chainbreaker you got the strings they're in tune you got the power there's no life behind it there has to be a life behind it you know they talk about brother this piano brother Larry can make that piano talk but it can't talk without somebody playing it do you hear what I'm telling you man is just an instrument he's just clay but if Jesus can take that person in full control he can preach through him heal the sick through him cast out Devils through him see Visions through him speak in tongues through him if that person can be like that violin just totally surrendered into the hand of the master and become one with the master god was in Christ true communion now God is in his church in a true communion making him the same yesterday today and forever he Sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he make every promise in the last day be revealed that he could go back and pick up what the other fellas had left off here in the last days and by his holy spirit reveal all the mysteries of the Seven Seals he expressed himself that is his purpose that's why he died that's the second fold of his three-fold manifestation first to express himself in Christ then Express himself through the church not just in Christ but through the church and the same thing Christ was the word and the church becomes the word when lets the word go through them yes sir it's the word becoming flesh and the flesh becoming word in this evil ungodly Godless age insanity is taking over the world plagues and violence and wars and fear and horrible sights and darkness and gross darkness in this time you know I was down in Arkansas just the other day when they had the eclipse and I was looking at it and when the Sun and the Moon and we know the sun is a type of Christ and the Moon is is the type of the church and I noticed that when the moon and the sun became one there was Darkness on the earth and in the darkness of Lea in this evil age of gross Darkness the sun and the moon become one am in this time of such gross Darkness guess what happens there comes a a knock at the door a glorious invitation Jesus said I stand at the door and knock If any man will open but I want you to know he knows who will open If any man will open the door I will come in and suck with him and he with me he's calling for a true communion he wants to be one with you not just when we take communion here but the true communion this is symbols of what he desires in US that day you should know I'm in the father ye and me and I and you the prophet said that's this day this day this Revelation is being made known that my father I am my father my father in me and I in you and you in me true Oneness listen god making himself known we're not supposed to convert Christianity by government regulations but by Revelation Christ in in you as God was in Christ God was in Christ as Christ in you as God was in Christ God is in you amen what God did in Christ is what God will do in you amen what signs God did in Christ is the signs that God will do in you amen amen that makes him that we don't have to go back to 57 we don't have to go back to 65 but in 2024 we can say he's the same yes y today and forever for the things he done in Christ the things he done in the son of man Ministry he is now doing in his blood same God doing the same works with the same anointing oh my the gospel comes by preaching the word god manifests himself God manifests himself through human beings the only eyes God's God is your eyes the only hands God has is your hands amen the only lips God has is your lips think about that friends think about that God working in his people God in the universe God in the word God in his son and God in his people Jesus said in that day at that day when this Revelation is made known you will know when this thing is made known when this secret that God has kept within himself is been revealed when these things are being revealed then you will know that I am in my father and my father in me and I in you and you in me when that Revelation is made manifest when that Revelation comes forth then it's I in you and you and me as the master as the Master Built the violin so has God built his church body the True Church of Jesus Christ the rde is like in the pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he has what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her cuz she is his workmanship she is all glorious within and without from the beginning to the end she is is the work of her Lord all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God Christ is a mystery of God revealed but the Bride is a revelation of who Jesus is amen that's good I stand and I knock If any man will open I will come to him I will s with him sub means to commune or to Fellowship Jesus wants Fellowship that's what God heart longs for tonight think about that think about that The God Who created the heavens and the Earth the God that I saw just I think yesterday that they had found another Universe way out there somewhere the god that created the universes not just one Universe the universes The God Who created billions upon billions trillions of stars that God who knows every Star by name that's the God I'm talking about tonight not a god of somebody's imagination the real God the true God the only god listen the mayor of Johnson City don't know my name I don't know his either the governor of Tennessee governor Lee he don't know me he's up here at Pals the other day I could have been there he still wouldn't have known me think about that we live in this state and yet he knows nothing about you and we pay taxes and yet he knows nothing nothing about you the governor don't know me the mayor don't know me the president of the United States he don't know who I am but the God who created [Music] un he knows my am he knows your name he has got de seed to this age and knocked on your door cuz he was looking for you he Lo the prophet said God Lo tonight to commune to Fellowship Jesus wants Fellowship that's what God's heart longs for tonight he Longs for your fellowship to be one with you think about it as we come come to a close brother Harry Brothers come think about this when Jesus was here he had no coat how many suits do I have in my closet he only had one coat but he never asked the father for a coat true he walked everywhere he went all the Chariots but not one time did he ever ask God for a chariot think about that the Bible said birds have nests and the foxes have burls but I the son of man have no place to lay my hand what does your home look like and yet he never even asked the father for a sleeping bag but the only thing he ever asked the father for yes sir brother was your fellowship said father make them one CU I want to laugh with them laugh with them celebrate victories with them fight battles with them I want to be one with him think about it let's just stand let's just stand tonight I just cut some we'll pick it up some other time but listen to me tonight as we wind this down and get ready for communion can you open your heart tonight can you open every door and say Lord come in I've just went through the motion I you know I just come and sit and then I go out and do but Lord tonight I see you long you're knock on my door and I want to open my door to you tonight I want to open up the doors of my heart tonight you see a lot of people want him as a savior because they don't want to go to hell so they want him as a savior but they don't want him as a Lord amen but you see if he's not Lord of everything then he ain't Lord at all some people that want a savior but he know doesn't want just to be our savior he wants to be our Lord he wants to take us into his hand like the violin like the master he wants to Rosen up the bow of the Holy Spirit he wants to strike Amazing Grace across your heart that your life will sing of the grace of almighty God to be in harmony amen theise the Lord but I say tonight Lord don't just be my savior but be my Lord Be My Ruler my controller take me what I Am Lord just as I am without one ple that blood was shed for me will you sck with him will you make him Lord will you let him rule your life will you let him guide you and direct you if it's against your thoughts will you sacrifice your thoughts if it's against your Ambitions will you sacrifice your bitions you might want to be this but are you willing to say not my will Lord let thy will be done we're at the end time and I say this the prophet said with reverence and respect of the last couple of minutes that's floating by look to what God to my opinion will do and must do and will do in this last day is to find a tool for the Harvest he's got to find a tool to thrash the floor any fer when he goes to Harvest he has to have a tool to do it with certainly he's got to have a sharp sickle or something some instrument to thrash out the Grain and the Harvest is ripe God take us in your hands make us bonder Servants of Your Love use us for tools to bring the realization to the sinful sin cursed Earth that we're living in today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen may they not just see it on the sign maybe they not just see it on a t-shirt may they not just see it on a bumper sticker but may they see it in our life lives that he's the same yesterday today and forever as for myself God help me tonight to turn myself in to be a prisoner to Jesus Christ if everybody turns me down if all my friends turn me down I want to be a prisoner to Jesus Christ the prophet said in this word that I might be harnessed to his word by the Holy Spirit to see the holy Spirit make the word of God be confirmed by the same things he said would be done I want to be a prisoner yes Lord of Jesus Christ amen yolked in feathers of love to be like that Old Violin that he can take into his hand a true communion tonight God in his people making himself the same yesterday today and forever amen do you love him tonight let's bow our heads I know it's a little short T that perhaps but I know we have communion but where you at tonight friend are we just going through the motions have some kind of a church entity Spirit or something or have we really surrendered to God to become a prisoner to True communion that The God Who created the heavens and earth Longs knocking at your door seeking you out saying let me come in that I might have fellowship with you if you invite me in I'll Seck with you and you with me where you at tonight are you ready

ready how about you young brother young sis are you really ready have you really met that commitment to Christ not just to to bread and that these things he commanded us to do it and we'll do it and it's sacred and we should examine ourselves but what he wants is you to take his life into you and if you're here tonight and you say brother Daryl you know that's what I want more than anything I don't want know my thoughts I just want to surrender my thoughts my ambitions my desire everything that I am I just simply want to lay myself at his altar I just wonder if you would just raise your hand tonight and say brother darl that's my desire truly friends that's my desire God bless the hands all over the church oh God you see the world dying around us Lord help us oh God I pray that we l

failures Lord Jesus take us tonight oh God use us For Your Glory pick us up like that Old Violin let us truly become one with you baptize us with thy Spirit oh God once more we pray renew the joy of thy salvation renew in us God if we've grown cold set us on fire again if we drifted anchor us back close to you again Lord we pray Grant it God granted God I pray hear our prayer tonight Lord you see the head that was raised all over the building this night of communion let it be a time of reconsecration a time of rededication a time of recommitment may it be that time Lord that that Revelation truly strikes our heart Hallelujah We Don't Belong To The World We Belong To You Grant it tonight oh God I pray in Jesus name in Jesus name oh Hallelujah I give myself away so you can use me say get

tonight friends if truly that was more than a song but it would be the prayer of every person in this building that it would be the desire of every heart in this building to truly give everything we have to the master that he could take us into his hands that he could have that true communion with us oh my what could happen What could happen in an atmosphere like that lives could be changed change could fall off blinded eyes open the lame walk people filled with the Holy Ghost as we surrender out to God tonight oh do you love him do you believe him tonight aren't you glad he knocked on your door tonight aren't you glad he come looking for you in this untours generation he sought you out because he knew you would believe him he sent his word and he healed us amen he sent his word and restored us amen God bless you Saints tonight isn't it wonderful to be a Christian amen God bless you brother Donnie if you want to come sir amen you can be seated if you like and turn with me to uh 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23 that's certainly what we desire isn't it not just to partake of the symbols tonight but to partake of him that's the great gift for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED remember the word come and SEP with me I'll SEP with you and you with me he's demonstrating this so he takes the cup and when he had sued saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's deaths till he come notice why we do it now wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord and there's a lot of folks that won't come to communion they won't participate in communion and yet they believe the Lord's coming every day and they think they're ready to leave that day doesn't make any sense to me people let the devil Rob them from such a great blessing this gives us but Brother Don I'm not perfect you're not looking at a perfect preacher a perfect preacher didn't preach to you tonight there ain't no perfect people as far as Humanity our perfection is in the Lord Jesus but this is what we're supposed to do but let a man examine himself examine so what do you do you examine you have an examination go to a doctor you get an examination you take an exam as we call it what is it a test to find out okay I'm okay here I'm all right there and you look at your heart oh wait a minute wait a minute I need to fix this I need to fix that so go ahead and do it and then after you do it eat amen you find something wrong fix it and then partake don't find something wrong and say oh I'm leaving whenever they pray I don't want to be hanging around so does that mean if the Lord comes tonight you'll be left now examine yourself fix what needs to be fixed and then eat wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord and worthily shall be guilty of their body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we judge ourselves we shall not be judged praise the Lord so we just bow our heads and you're praying not just for yourself but for those around you just a moment of Silent prayer dear father you know every person every need Lord Jesus help each of us dear God we pray may your presence come Lord de with every heart I pray now father anything in our lives it displeases you cleanse us oh Lord we will do as your word has said we will examine and we will eat granted father in the name of Jesus praise the Lord father de God is cups of wi Lord we know your Propet we should not use gra juice for this because gra juice but to take Vine strength know your blood we thank you for that great s Lord God I pray every heart as already parted of that blood of life I pray you bless and sanctify this wine tonight father for intended purp in Jesus name as we pray over this bread as I watched Carol today she was making this Lord setting at the table tearing it sincerely praying meditating over it it's a great thing father we're so grateful not just so much for this little pieces of bread that we're going to take but for your body you gave your body for us so Lord the way we look at it you're not asking too much to ask for our body back to you yes as we press this to our lips tonight father may we realize the sacredness of we never want this to become calm and not having a special place in our the B is already said we know that there is healing in the community may the saints of God as they come through this line tonight Lord God I pray you grant them than for whatever they have need of in their body bring healing may we hear of great things that happens out of this communion service tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] w [Music] [Applause] [Music] h [Music] I [Music] all [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] o [Music] the [Music] we can imagine in our hearts by the time this portion of the service the last supper was done the disciples were perplexed overwhelmed I don't think they were running jumping shouting hollering and all of that they were just subdued because they had never seen their Master be in this type of attitude that he was and they're trying to comprehend what's going on and they haven't fully comprehended it until he does this St John 132 and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and went to God and he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he pth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel this must have been overwhelming this was a slaves job the lowest of a household staff paid the least looked down on the most of footwash flunky so here Jesus humbles himself and begin to wipe them with a towel where with he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter Sith unto him Lord D thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter Sith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet listen what Jesus answers him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus says unto him he that is washed needeth not to save to wash his feet and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said unto them you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what I've done unto you you call me master and Lord oh my I am your Lord and Master and I've done this to you so I'm making an example for each one of you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if th then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done unto you verely verely I say unto to you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them now this is our first time of course in our our new church and we'll do it similar to to the way that we did it at at the old building the brothers will stay in here because mainly our musicians are men so whenever they get finished they can come back and start playing the music and the sisters will be able to be dismissed here just momentarily quietly reverently of course into the large forer where some sisters will Aid you in getting getting started and uh please remember that this is still part of the service so approach it reverently with no talking sisters needing nursing facilities we ask that you'd use the Overflow Nursery down here in the Sunday School room part so in case any of the brothers need to go to the restrooms they will be able to use the restrooms and the nurses there there will be deacons at the doors to ensure privacy and security and then we will let the sisters know when it's okay for you to come back to the sanctuary may the Lord bless you sisters you are dismissed [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] than than than heart spe than J [Music] thank you thank
