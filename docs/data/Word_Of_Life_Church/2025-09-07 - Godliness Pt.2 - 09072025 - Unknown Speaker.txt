We're going to read that testimony one more time. I want that to sink in on you this morning. My mother has been going through treatments for bladder cancer over the last year and a half. She finished series of treatments in the spring. She went back for routine test in July. The doctors advised her she needed to to do a biopsy, but the treatment was not successful and the cancer was still there, plus a new spot. On the 27th of August, Brother Daryl preached with her prayer cloth on him. My mom received the cloth that night and has hasn't been without it since she had the biopsy on both spots.

You can be seated. [Music] I heard the preacher talking about three wooden crosses upon a hill for everyone to see. Two sinners on the outside couldn't save themselves if they tried. All I could think is man that sounds like me. I've been the one on the left full of guilt and regret long gone on the wrong side of living. I've been the one on the right always looking for a fight thinking I could never be forgiven. I'm standing here today overwhelmed by grace cuz I know paid my cost. Thank God for the man on the middle cross. [Music] He didn't have to do it. But for me, he went through it. A love like that'll never understand. [Music] Lord knows I don't deserve it. And I know I couldn't earn it, but mercy rain down on this desperate man. I've been the one on the left full of guilt and regret. Long gone on the wrong side of living. I've been the one on the right, always looking for I can never be forgiven. Standing here today overwhelmed by grace cuz I know paid my cost. Thank God for the man on the middle cross. The cross is where he went. Oh, but that ain't where he stayed. He brought me back to life when he rose about that grave. Someday I'll stand before him. And I'll see Jesus face to face. I worship and adore him. For a life forever changed. [Music] I've been the one on the left, full of guilt and regret, long gone on the wrong side of living. I've been the one on the right, always looking for a fight, thinking I could never be forgiven. I'm standing here today overwhelmed by grace cuz I know paid my cost. Thank God for the man on the middle cross. Oh, thank God for the man on the middle cross. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Do you ever find yourself asking God where he's been? ever get up out of bed saying, "I can't do this again." Have you ever been afraid of what tomorrow's going to bring? And you're facing it alone. At least that's what you think. I can tell you after going through that valley, even though I couldn't see it at the time, it was in my weakest moments that he held me. And I know you'll find he will carry you when you can't go on. He will be your strength when your strength is gone. He will lift you up. He will be enough to get you through. When the road is long and you want to quit cuz you think you've got nothing left to give. You can fall apart, fall into his arms. He will carry you when you get the kind of news that you hoped you'd never hear. [Music] When you're chasing down a dream just to watch it disappear. When somebody that you love turns and walks away and they leave you standing there with shattered faith. You don't have to pick up all the broken pieces. You don't have to try to cover up the scars. You are loved and you can always run to Jesus just as you are. He will carry you when you can't go on. He will be your strength. When your strength is gone, he will lift you up. He will be enough to get you through. When the road is long and you want to quit, cuz you think you've got nothing left to give, you can fall apart, fall into his arms. He will carry you. His heart is never weary. No, he's never tired. Through the toughest fight, through the longest night, through the flood and through the fire, he will carry you when you can't go on. He will be your strength when your strength is gone. He will lift you up. He will be enough to get you through. When the road is long and you want to quit cuz you think you've got nothing left to give, you can fall apart. Fall into his arms. He will carry you. [Music] He will carry you. [Music] He will carry you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you thankful that he carries us? &gt;&gt; Amen. And if the brothers could pull up, I'd rather have Jesus. Wednesday night, Brother Donnie was talking about this story about the people that got crucified for Jesus. And I thought of this song, and it's an old song. We all know it, and I want you all to sing it with me. But I'd say we'd all say we'd rather have Jesus than anything in this world. [Music] I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold. I'd rather be his than have riches untold. I'd rather have Jesus than housees or lands. I'd rather be led by his nail pierce head than to be the king of the vast oddel in sins I swear I'd rather have Jesus than anything [Music] this world affords. Today [Music] I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause. [Music] I'd rather be faithful to his dear cause. I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide faith. I'd rather be true to his holy name than to be the king of the vast [Music] men. or be held in sway. I' rather have Jesus [Music] than anything. [Music] is a force today. [Music] He's fairer than the leaves of red blue. be sweeter than honey from out the cold. [Music] He's all that my hungry spirit needs. I'd rather have Jesus and let him be than to be the king of beh. dress. I ra have Jesus than anything this world affords today. Hey, course again. and to be the king of the last [Music] sway. [Music] I'd rather have Jesus than him. Anything [Music] this world affords today. All this world affords to death. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Father. Let's pray together. Lord Jesus, we realize it's none man's nature to want that. We're born lost out of your presence. and actually in a state of enemies. You and I at one time were enemies. All the rest of these people were the same way. We're so grateful that you've moved on our hearts and our lives and changed us to we're no longer enemies, but we're friends, children, beloved. Heavenly Father, as we've come today again that we could worship and sing and praise and hear testimonies of the great things that you're doing among us, preaching of the word. We're just asking that you'd help us. You see, our needs, they're many, but Lord God, we know that our God is greater than all of our needs combined. I have my hand, Father, on these prayer calls today. And you see the needs. We've just heard a great testimony of what you've done today of of a prayer cause. And as simple and foolish as it might seem to the world, we know it works. And we're grateful. Would you help us today, Father? Help me to be able to get out of the way to speak something that will be beneficial to your children. In the name of the Lord Jesus, we ask it. Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm just as happy to be a Christian today. &gt;&gt; To be saved and know that the power of God has touched your heart and changed you, &gt;&gt; made you to what he wanted you to be. Let's turn if you would to second Peter chapter 1 verse 2. We greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and that awesome, holy, wonderful name that we all love so well. I want to speak to you again today on godliness. How many once more godliness in your life? &gt;&gt; Amen. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you. Second Peter 1 and2 through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature. How blessed we are. Having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. May the Lord bless his word. You may be seated. I don't mind telling you as I've um been studying on godliness. I've been somewhat surprised to see the different things about godliness that I myself had never quite thought of and the attributes of godliness. And we know that of course godliness means to be like God. And I'll read to you what we read last week where the prophet in dealing with it said if you've got genuine faiths and put genuine virtue to it, genuine knowledge, genuine temperance, then genuine patience, you're moving right on up the line. Fifthly, at godliness, godliness. What does godliness mean? I looked in four or five dictionaries and couldn't even find what it meant. Finally, I was down at brother Jeff there and we found it in a dictionary. Godliness means to be like God. But in what sense? How can we be like God? Well, he goes on further and he reads the scripture of Matthew 48. We'll take this one. He says, jump down a little bit there in the quote. You know, the Bible says you are God's. Jesus said so. All things that's in God is in you. Matthew 5:48 quotes it again. Jesus speaking in the biatitudes be therefore perfect. He spells it. What's that? Perfect. Even as your father in heaven is perfect. You got way up here now. For you have to do that. Notice where this is at. Way up close to the top. All these things to be added first. Then when you get up here, he's asked you to be perfect godliness, sons and daughters of God. How many things I could say along that line. So to be in the attribute of godliness is to be like God and the simple meaning that he give us. But godliness reflects divine character and as Peter said to us also divine nature encompassing reverence for God also devotion for God. It's our ethical conduct our behavior the way we treat people uh the things that we love. Now this may shock you a little bit. Godliness is not just loving what God loves, but godliness is also hating what God hates. &gt;&gt; Now, there are things, many things that God hates. Now, this is where some people would have a very difficult time because they have in their mind that God loves everything. But he can't do that and be God because there's so much darkness and evil and wickedness in the world. And to be like God is more than just not partaking of what God hates, but also hating it with the same passion that he hates it with. So there's some people that would not partake of certain things that would be wrong, but they actually don't hate the thing. Now remember, and I'm talking about hating people. God loves the sinner, but he hates the sin. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So there's things that God absolutely hates. So we want to love what God loves, and we want to hate actually the things that God hates. So that is to be godlike. Let me read this to you again in 1 Timothy 3:16. And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness. So to be like God is a mystery. It's a mystery to be like God. God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. Now this word as with many other Greek words that are used in the New Testament, they may come from one uh Greek root and then out of there like the English language, there'll be other words that'll come with it. So godliness, godly, and several others come from the same thing. Listen to this in 2 Corinthians 1:2. For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience. Listen to the way he said this. The testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity. So there is sincerity that is not godly. There are many people that is just as sincere as they can be, but they're sincerely wrong. &gt;&gt; That type of sincerity is not godly. Now, having traveled around the world and seen many different types of religions myself, and I've shared with you some of the things that I've seen through the years and seen people that would do all kinds of things to their body and how that they would worship idols and so on and so forth. And are they sincere? Yep. Absolutely sincere. But yet, their sincerity is not godly sincerity. So, we don't want to just be sincere, but we want our sincerity to be godly. Is that right? Now, notice this word here. It is theos, the Greek word, and it refers to things of God, his counselss, interest, things due to him. Whatever can in any respect be likened unto God. whatever in any respect that can be likened unto God or resemble him in any way. Now notice in Paul says, "For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly to youward." Now notice again he says that in 2 Corinthians 7:9. Now I rejoice. Now Paul had to say some pretty harsh things to the Corinthian church in 1 Corinthians. And he had to deal with some pretty tough issues. Remember there was adultery, fornication, different things that was going on, misuse of spiritual gifts and things like that. And Paul now a few years later is writing back in 2 Corinthians and he's referring back to what he did. Now notice the heart of a real servant of God when he has to deal with things in a corrective manner. I love the way he writes this. And I rejoice not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance. Now watch. Paul knew that they were made sorry because he had brought to light the sin that was going on in the church and the church was just letting it go right on. And there was other things that he had to deal with. And Paul said, now he said, I rejoice not that you were made sorry. It did not make him happy to make them feel heavy and sorrowful. But it did make him happy that it produced a certain type of sorrow. Now notice he said, "But that you sorrowed to repentance." Now this is the way every true servant of God when he has to preach corrective measures. It's to be able to promote the people that are guilty of doing wrong that he by the grace of God will help them to enter into a state of godly sorrow and they feel so bad for what they've done, what they said, the way they've acted, the way they behaved. Godly sorrow is a great thing to have. I hate to say it, but it's apparent. A lot of people in the age we live in, they don't have a clue what it's all about because they feel it very little, if any, anymore. Now, that's the hardness of this age we're living in. And you and I will have to watch ourselves because we're around Leodyans every day of our life. And I see it in the message that many message people are getting to a spot to where they do not understand godly sorrow. They simply get angry at the man who says anything to them that makes them feel that way because they feel bad and they don't like the way they feel. So what do they do? They take it out on the mailman, the man who delivered the message. So they get angry at him not realizing that you are so blessed to be able to still feel godly sorrow because many people friends just cannot feel it. Now notice but ye were made sorry after a godly manner. So there is a godly sorrow and there is a godly manner. So what we're talking about anything that pertains to God. So it comes from the very heart of God that he would anoint ministry and they would preach things that would actually in the service make people feel repentant and it would make them feel sorry and they would feel an element of anguish and they would feel an element of sadness because the word has exposed something in their life and a shortcoming. Do you understand that? That is a godly manner. That is a godly manner. True, it's only in time. But we all still need that. I don't know about you, I need that in my life. If I'm wrong and I I'm hearing a tape or I'm hearing a preacher preach, I want to be able to receive that from my heart and not wait till it makes an alter call, but right there bow my head while the preaching is going forth and say, "Lord, I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I did not realize I'd done that. Lord, I didn't know that was wrong. Please forgive me. How many happens to you all the time? &gt;&gt; Well, you see what that is? That is a godly sorrow working after a godly manner. Now, anything now remember that pertains to God is godliness. Now look what happens to us as we come to church that we are participating in the mystery of godliness. As preachers are preaching to us and we're feeling our hearts being smitten while we're in the service and people look at it and tell, "Oh man, I was getting into it so good until I begin to feel so sad." Oh no. That's part of the mystery of godliness. You're blessed to be able to feel it. Now notice Paul goes on to say, "For that you were made sorry after a godly manner that you might receive." Notice this. you might receive damage by us in nothing. Now, can you comprehend this? That preachers have the ability to cause the people of God great damage. &gt;&gt; Look at this word that Paul is using now. He said, "I I wanted you all to feel bad and feel sorrow, but I did not want to damage you." Oh, I wish every preacher could realize that. For you were made sorry after a godly manner that you might receive damage by us in nothing. Paul was saying, "I don't want you all to be damaged by me. I don't want what I'm bringing to damage you, but I want it to be able to bring a godly sorrow. And you will enter into this godly manner of repentance, and you'll feel wrong. And what does it do? Then it does not leave a longlasting damage. God gives every God called man something in his gift. It's not traits and characteristics that's in the gift of God, a call of God. Even when you're dealing with corrective things to where you say, "Lord, please help me to know when I've said enough and to shut my mouth up when I've said enough so I don't go too far." Why? It's damage control. And only the spirit of God can help you to know. You're not going to find any, you know, on a rate on a rating of 1 to 10 how far for a preacher to go. When you get up to about five, start slowing down. When you get to six, you're going too far. When you get up higher, you better be careful. But every preacher has this ability to damage the very people he's preaching truth with. What? Truth. &gt;&gt; Truth. But not finding that balance and we're able to encourage them and to be able to tap them when they need to be tapped and to bend them over your knee when they need to be bent over your knee. Now, you see, it takes the Holy Ghost to be able to know how to do that. And Paul was so delicate after this had happened. Now being a preacher, I could relate just a little tiny tiny bit in the way that Paul is saying this. And being a preacher, you hear it a little bit different, I guess. But Paul is now so rejoicing in God. Brother Joel, he must have had some wonderings and some feelings. God, I hope I didn't go too far. I hope I hope I didn't press it too straight and too far. And watch him from his heart. Now he's reiterating this that he had felt and the wonderment about it. Now we said, let me read verse 9 again. I rejoice not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance, but you were made sorry after a godly manner. So a preacher has the ability then to make people feel so sorry, but it's not after a godly manner. And instead of turning them to repentance, a preacher has the ability of making them turn away from the place that they actually need to go to. How? Because he brings them so low and discourages them so much and some of them sitting there were right on the precipice of the brink of turning away. And that preacher actually brought them beyond that place and they made up their mind sitting right there in that service. I'm giving up. I ain't doing it. There's no way I can do it. Oh, God have mercy. Think what a serious thing it is for preachers with the ability that they have to damage people of God. It's such a balance. Oh, friends, pray for preachers like you ain't never prayed for them before. Now notice he said, "You were made sorry after a godly manner that you might receive damage by us, not by the devil, not by demons, but by us in nothing." Notice in verse 10, for godly sorrow, godly sorrow workketh repentance to salvation. Now, here to me is part of the mystery of godliness. What is godliness? So it's to be like God. So a child of God when they hear that they have done something wrong or they've had a wrong attitude or whatever it is then godly sorrow works toward them in a godly manner and the display of godliness is the outcome of them the man of God obeying the word them hearing the word receiving it in the right attitude. Then that godly sorrow works repentance. And the mystery of godliness has been made manifest in the service in several different ways. And them demons was standing there saying, "What in the world just happened? What in the world went on?" I was hoping he'd push them so far that it would discourage them. Who stopped him? What stopped him from going on? And then look at their hearts. Look at the tears running out of their eyes. And instead of getting mad and being angry, look at what it done. Oh no. Oh no. It's done went into that element of godliness which is rendered godly sorrow and brought about a godly manner. And now it's unfolding itself as a bud does in the spring. And it opened up itself and blossomed into a flower of repentance. And they made it right right there in that service. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Notice, for godly sorrow workketh repentance to salvation, not to be repented of, but the sorrow of the world workketh death. Now, what a delicate balance, you see, that a man of God has to bring to the people in that he wants to bring a godly sorrow, but not the sorrow of the world. What is the sorrow of the world? The sorrow of the world is so much heaviness and so much sadness and so much trouble. We feel it all around us every day, don't we? Every day of our life. But notice how Paul contrasts that not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world workketh death. So the sorrow and the heaviness of the world and the disappointments of life and the things that we go through. What does it work? Do you understand that type of sorrow actually aids and abetss the death that is working in your body already? Old age itself starts on you after you're about 20ome years old and you're getting older and old. You become more nervous. you become where you can't take things like you could and Satan keeps on every day of your life accumulating all this sorrow and that sorrow works on the desk in the realm of your mortality and it will add to your nervousness. It will add to your tension. It will add to your oppression. I wish somebody would hear me this morning. It will add to your sadness and that actually works on that sorrow. Works on that death that's in your mortal body. You know what it convinces me? We ought to be more happy. &gt;&gt; We ought to have more of the joy of the Lord in our heart. Turn that frown upside down and smile. You got a whole lot to be happy for, children. &gt;&gt; Now notice this in verse 11. For behold this selfsame thing that you s startled after a godly sort. What carefulness it wrought in you. Now watch the master teacher and how he so selectively and carefully picks the right words and see now he's turning it around. But he couldn't tell them this whenever he was preaching it to them. He had to kind of let it sting and kind of burn a little bit because it could have been taken that he was saying it and then watering it down after he got done preaching it. So he had to leave it in that stern way and that straight way. Now he can come back after he's dealt with some pretty harsh things. And he tell him, "Now this is what I couldn't tell you then because you would have took it wrong. I would have give it to you this way. And if I would have told you this right here, right now, it would have actually watered down the effect of the word." Well, and God loving and so awesome that he would do that to us. Oh my. You sorrowed at a godly sort. So there's some sorrow that is godly. What carefulness it wrought in you. Yay. What clearing? What clearing of yourselves? Clearing of yourselves. What did it goly sorrow which worked repentance? Yay, what indignation? Yay, what fear? Yay, what vehement desire? Yay, what zeal? Yay, what revenge? Oh my goodness. All of that come out of hideburning. &gt;&gt; Wow. So, y'all are getting more out again your hideburn than what you ever thought. If you'll take it right, you'll get zeal. You'll get vehement. I mean, it'll it'll do you so much good. Oh my. Yay. What revenge and all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter. Oh my. Now watch again in 2 Corinthians 11:2. And we all know the scripture. I know. For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy. So you mean there is a jealousy that is godly? Yeah. As a matter of fact, God himself in the book of Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, many places in the Old Testament, God says that he is a jealous God. As a matter of fact, one of those places he said his name is jealous. &gt;&gt; Oh, you didn't know the Bible said that? Yeah, it does. That he said his name is jealous and that I am a jealous God. Now, it's not human jealousy. Human jealousy would make a man if he sees somebody else flirting with his wife, it would make him if he's got a temper, you know, want to roll up his fist and knock out a few of his teeth in his mouth or whatever that he would do. But that's not godly jealousy. That's human jealousy. But there is a godly jealousy. And this is what Paul was expressing to the church in that day that he looked at the church as one who had as a father had betrod them to Christ. And he said, "I'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy." And then he tells him why. Because notice what he said, "I have espoused you to one husband." So Paul sees the devil flirting with the church. He sees Satan and sad to say, but a lot of what he was using was preachers. And them preachers was trying to pull them away from the love of God in the way that Paul had be able to bring it to them. But he said, "I'm jealous over you all." Now, Paul was not jealous as a jealous preacher can get jealous. Now, preachers can be jealous. I don't mind telling you. And if you go preach for them in their church and the church is really blessed, they'll get jealous if the service goes too good. You want to know how I know that, huh? You know, that that's that's awful. That's absolutely terrible. That jealousy is not of God. But there is a godly jealousy that every true servant of God will have. and he'll look at the bride of God, the wife of God, and if he sees temptation and lying, whatever it is that Satan is doing, flirting with that wife of God, then that servant of God, oh my, it just really bothers him. He just said, "That's not right. That's not right." It's not that he's looking, oh, these are my people. These are my sheep. These are mine. These are mine. They're not mine. They're his. &gt;&gt; So, can I have a godly jealousy in a right way? Yes. I can and I do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I do have a godly jealousy. I'm jealous over you. Not your money. I don't want your money. You know that. I'm not asking you for your money. I don't want your things of life. I'm not jealous because well, if somebody preacher comes and he's blessed, the way I look at it, if a man of God steps behind this pull pit and you're blessed, I'm blessed. &gt;&gt; I've said it to you before. If he can preach, praise God, and he's really anointed of the Lord and you get help, it might lighten my load for a day or two. And if he can't preach, you won't be able you you won't be able to stand you can hear me preach again. You know what? So either way, whether can preach or whether that can't preach, I ain't got nothing in my heart. There's not one servant of God that I'm jealous of in this message. Not a one. No, sir. But I do have a godly jealousy over the people of God. Now notice again in 1 Timothy 1:4, Paul said, "Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister." Notice what they do. Minister questions. Questions. Notice the people that are leaving the message. What are they focusing on? Questions. Questions. Questions. Qu I don't understand this. I can't make this fit together now. I can't make that fit together and all my questions. Paul said don't even focus on that rather than godly edifying which is in faith. So here again we come to something that can be done both godly and can be done humanly and demonically. So there is a godly edifying and there is a human edification. And Paul had to deal with this of course in 1 Corinthians and it pertained to the gifts. So the people were speaking in tongues or different things that they were doing and there's no interpreter there and they would just get up in service and speak in tongues and boy they had a time. I'll tell you what they were so blessed. Those of you that have spoke in tongues, you know how awesome that it can be. And Paul had to write to him and say, "No, no, no. That's not the way it's supposed to be done. a person that's does not have an interpreter there. They're edifying themsel and they're feeling so wonderful and so good and so blessed, but everybody else is sitting there looking at them think, "What in the world are they saying? What is going on? What is that?" Self-edification. &gt;&gt; Paul wrote about it, you know, about first Corinthians about prophecies and tongues and interpretation. And the emphasis was that they were missing in 1 Corinthians was edification to the body, but they were focusing on edification to the self. And then there's demonic edification by which demons will try to use us, utilize who we are, what we are that will edify the kingdom of Satan. And in turn, there is a godly edifying. A godly edifying which is in faith. Now look at the mystery of God this morning as it unfolds. So we see that there is a a a feeling in our heart of of when I'm wrong and oh God I need to make that thing right. And you think that's ungodly. That is godly. That is godly. There is a godly jealousy. Then here we find there is a godly edifying. 2 Corinthians or Timothy rather 3:12. Yay. And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. Same English word but a total different Greek word which is piously or godly. So it doesn't come from the root word theos but it's a different word. But all of those that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. Now, this is why that many Christians in the day that we're living are not persecuted for their walk of Christianity. They look no different from the world. They talk no different from the world. They act no different from the world. But yet, they have a profession that they are Christians. Praise the Lord. But those who live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Any y'all ever suffer persecution because you live godly? Uh-huh. What if you know what? If our church, all of our women dressed like all the rest of the so-called Christian women of the world, and all of our young people act like them, listen to the same kind of music. They done everything they did. They smoke, they drink, they they take dope every now and then when they have to to can't make it through life. And all of our brothers, they start doing all the exact same thing. It would be amazing how much of the persecution that we go through would be totally eliminated because they would look at you and see themsel reflected in the way you act and the way you live. You see, it is the way you live, the way you talk, the way you dress, the way you act. It actually, unbeknownst to them, it makes them feel odd. It makes them feel different. Although they'll tell you you're the odd one, it's them that feels really odd about being around you. Why do you do that? Why do you do that? Well, believe it or not, all the Baptist women used to wear dresses like our women do. All the Methodist women, praise the Lord, that's right, they used to be. So, I wonder who is the odd ones then since their grandmothers used to dress the way you do and the grandmothers in the Methodist church and the Baptist. There's still a few primitive Baptists and a few that do. But you realize if we would take away all that, I'd stop reading quotes. I'd stop calling brother Random's name. then a lot of the reproach by which we are reproached by would be eliminated. But I wonder what else would be eliminated. I wonder if the healings and the miracles and the signs and the power of God that we love so much at our church, I wonder if that wouldn't go with the reproach. Let me bear the reproach in order to have Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yay. And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. So my question would be for many of these people who have left the message, has the persecution left with it? When were they persecuted the most? When they were following this message or now in some denominational church somewhere? Come on, somebody. Are they suffering persecution? Are they being ridiculed and laughed at? No. Because that goes with the truth. And when you let go of truth, persecution automatically goes with it. Well, praise God. Notice Titus 2:12, teaching us denying ungodliness. So, here's the opposite of godliness. Ungodliness and worldly lust. We should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world. Now, here it again is the same word you see. So we are to live holy lives righteously and godly in this present world. So we're not supposed to look like the world. So if our message produces the exact same thing that all the rest of Christianity does, I would have to walk away from this message today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? It don't separate. It don't call people out. God has never sent a message that did not call his children out of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice in Hebrews 12 verse 28, here's a different word, same English word. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we serve God. God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. Now this is eucibus not but eczeibus which is devout pious and dut beautiful. So it releases something and the mystery of godliness to the hearts of those who have it. People look at it like the word of prison. They look at it that we can't do this and can't do that. Oh no, we can do the same things that everybody else does, but we just don't want to do it. Well, what is that? It's the godliness that's released in our nature which makes us want to be like God. &gt;&gt; It makes us want to be like that. Now, of course, our flesh is not saved and our flesh is still grammatized naturally like everybody else's flesh and therefore it sets up a great battle. But the stronger of the two will always win. Now, if your flesh is stronger than your spirit, your spiritual walk with God, you're going to constantly be living a life of defeat. You're going to be living a life where you ain't got no happiness and no joy cuz you're living way down beneath your privilege in God. Come on, somebody say amen. But if you can allow it, the spirit of God in you will help you to live godly. Oh my. Second Peter chapter 2:9. The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation. So you mean the godly will face temptations more so than the rest of them out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished. God don't let me be there. Third John 1:6 which have borne witness of thy charity before the church whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort. Now here we come back to the original word theos after a godly sort. So there's godly temperament, godly manner, godly sort, godly jealousy. Wow, this is some of the things I'm just overwhelmed by whenever I got to looking at. So theos is refers to the things of God, his councils and interests, things due to him. Whatever in any respect can be likened unto God. All right. Now, so if we want to be like God, what is God? What is God? So God is what? Well, I mean, Brother Donnie, I mean, he he he's God. I know that. But what is God? So what is God? If I'm want to be like God, I've got to find out what God is. Read remember in Deuteronomy 4:31, "For the Lord thy God is a merciful God." &gt;&gt; So if I want to be like God, I've got to be merciful. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on, godly children. Let's get into the mystery of godliness. For the Lord thy God is a merciful God. He will not forsake thee, neither destroys thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers, which he swear unto them. Now, wait a minute, Brother Donnie, that's God. How in the world can I do that? Matthew 5:7, blessed are the &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Surely not the same word that God is. &gt;&gt; God is merciful and I must be merciful and you must be merciful. &gt;&gt; Now remember these are the biatitudes. Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy. Luke 6:36. Be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful. So, can we expect everybody to obtain this level? Not to this degree. Now, we're moving into the mystery of godliness where the perfection of the godhead is in every attribute, whether it's a man or a woman or Jesus. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. So the attribute of the theos, the godhead, will manifest itself in sinners saved by grace as it did in the Lord Jesus who didn't need any saving. &gt;&gt; Woo! &gt;&gt; Anybody want to go with me? &gt;&gt; Notice again now what else is God? 1 Corinthians chapter 1:9. God is faithful. By whom you were called unto the fellowship of his son. Isn't that beautiful? By whom you were called unto the fellowship of his son, Jesus Christ, our Lord. You're not called to be a slave. You're not called to be a servant. You're called to fellowship with the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Friends, think about it. So we come to church to fellowship and to see the saints of God. That's only one reason we come to church. We come to fellowship with the Lord Jesus. So what do you do when you fellowship with your brothers and sister? You talk to them. You sit down. You eat with them, shake them by the hand, put your arm around the neck or whatever it is, and you fellowship. That's what he wants to do with us. And that's what he wants us to do with him. It ain't just about us coming to church and doing our religion. I've come today to fellowship the Lord Jesus. I've come to talk to him. I've come to praise him. I've come to put my arms around him. But I know how he feels about it. I know he wants to talk to me. I know he wants to put his arms around me. But we get in too big of a hurry. Y'all got too many plans after church today. Y'all, you need to start coming to church and say, "Well, this is what we've got planned at 2:30, but who knows what the Lord might do. We might not even be out of church, be Lord have mercy, Brother Donnie, I can't stay at church 3:00. Why not?" My goodness, you only come twice a week. Oh, hallelujah. You work way more than you come to church. You sleep way more than you come to church. It's evident that all of you eat way more than you come to church. Come on, somebody. This is our time in the presence of the Lord Jesus which we can fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice Ephesians 1:1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the saints which are at Ephesus and to thee. &gt;&gt; Ah, so here they are now taking on the attribute of godliness. They're being like God. God is faithful. &gt;&gt; So, how many of you are faithful in the sense that God was that God said, "I'll never leave you." And yet, some of you have turned away from friends. &gt;&gt; Whenever they didn't treat you right, brother, &gt;&gt; I guess I could take my iPad and finish this back in my office if y'all want me to. Brother Don, they're not deserving of kindness. And you're telling me you were. &gt;&gt; Anybody here deserving of mercy? &gt;&gt; Kindness, forgiveness, love. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm talking about godliness this morning. You see, it's doing for you what no doubt I look like, too, with the deer in the headlight look. Sitting down in my study looking at it. I probably look the same way that y'all are looking at me. You know, I'm sitting up there bugeyed. Really, God? You got to be good. I mean, this is what you want. You want us to actually be like you. You want us to be like you. &gt;&gt; What an awesome honor. &gt;&gt; Notice Colossians chapter 1:2. To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colasse. Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Revelation 17:14. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them. For he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful. &gt;&gt; You mean God wants me to be faithful? Yes. Faithful to what, Brother Donnie? His word, his people. Not just your wife. Come on, somebody. Not just your three or four young ones. God wants you to be faithful in what? In everything he tells you to do. So if God says no to a prayer that you petitioned him about and you breaks your heart, what does God want? Faithfulness. I'll serve him. As Job said, though he slay me, yet I will serve him. This is the bride that's going to come back. My friends, we're talking about the bringing forth of those that's going to make war. And the bride will be released out of heaven and come back and make war. It's not them that shout and they do shout. It's not them that speak in tongues and they do. But notice the attributes of those who's coming back to fight with him. They are called and chosen and faithful. &gt;&gt; How many wants to be faithful? God is light. &gt;&gt; First John 15. This then is the message, the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light &gt;&gt; and in him is no darkness at all. Matthew 5:14, "Ye are a light." &gt;&gt; Do you understand? When you let your light shine, you're expressing godliness. &gt;&gt; You're being like God. &gt;&gt; But Donnie, I I can't I can't quote quotes. I can't quote scripture. You don't have to let your light shine. Just let it shine. Just let it shine. You're in Walmart. Let it shine. God knows Walmart needs it. Well, not so much the building, but everybody that's in there. So, wherever you're at, you're going to college, you're going to school, you're trading, you're buying, you're selling, whatever you're doing, let your light shine as a Christian, and you're breaking darkness. And you have a little element there that you could be dishonest about this, that the other. And there ain't nobody there. I'm not there watching looking over your shoulder and the deacon board ain't there. But you know what? You're a Christian and you're a godly saint of God. So, you're going to let your light shine even in a business transaction when it could make you more money if you go the other way. But you are godly on the job. You're godly at college. You're godly at school. You're godly no matter where you are. Come on, somebody. If you go down to Florida and take a vacation, you're even godly down off the beach. You don't strip down like a lizard pile up under a big pile of umbrellas down there. Come on, somebody. Uh-huh. You go to Pigeon Fort and you don't sneak down there and drink with the, you know, all the sipping places that they've opened up down in Pigeon Ford and come to the whiskey and the this and that and the other. No, you're a child of God. You do drink wine, but it's that new wine that Jesus talked about. It's that kind that makes you so drunk on the presence of God that you don't know who you are and you lose sight of this world that you're in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. But I love the transformation now that Paul speaks about in Ephesians 5:8. For ye were sometimes darkness. &gt;&gt; Now, you were not in darkness. You actually were darkness. from our souls pulsated darkness. &gt;&gt; You ever notice how people will connect? You ever notice there's anybody in the church that's getting cold on God and somebody may come in from the wild blue yonder, you know, they don't even know one another and they'll connect just like with them. Or they go to another church to visit. I've seen it in youth camps for decades &gt;&gt; and youth camps. Cold kids go to, you know, to youth camp and there'll be another cold kid and they'll join together that cold kid. You know why? They don't feel comfortable out on fire kids. &gt;&gt; They're fanatics, man. They don't like them on fire kids. But on fire, kids, keep on fire. We need you in this day we live in. Amen. Now, you see, you were not trying to put on darkness. You were. &gt;&gt; You were. I was. &gt;&gt; We were darkness. &gt;&gt; What happened? What happened that I could be changed from darkness to light? The same Lord God that said, "Let there be light." And there was light. That same spoken word spoke over my soul and said, "Let there be light in his soul." And there is. That same Lord God spoke over you. Let there be light. For ye were sometimes darkness, but now. Oh, I'd like to preach to you sometime on them two words. But now, but now are ye light. You're not in the light. You are &gt;&gt; light. Lord, &gt;&gt; but now are ye light in the Lord. walk as children of light. &gt;&gt; Can I go on a bit? &gt;&gt; God is love. &gt;&gt; Now, let me shock you. I don't want to be able to just love people and I don't want to just be lovable. This is my goal. To become love. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll let you think about it for a minute and then I'll read it to you. First John 4:8, he that loveth not knoweth not God. For God, now God is not just loving, though he is. That's an attribute though. Loving. God isn't just loving. And God isn't just lovable, but God is actually love. And he loved the unlovable. Romans 5:6. For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die. Yet p venture for a good man. Some would even dare to die. But God commendest his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. &gt;&gt; Make me more like you, Jesus. Notice this. And the prophet, he picks us up about love and he said, "Now we're partakers of his divine nature." You get it? Then you become a partaker after coming into his body. A partaker of his divine nature. Christ's nature in you. How can you cheat, &gt;&gt; steal, &gt;&gt; lie, backslide, &gt;&gt; procelitect, &gt;&gt; everything else with the divine nature of Christ in you? It's impossible. Let that soak just a few minutes now cuz it's right. If you be a partaker in Christ and you become a new creature, old things have passed away. All things are become new. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "All of our warings and fussings and stewings and arguings and tempers, &gt;&gt; come on. All these things &gt;&gt; pass away. &gt;&gt; Help us Jesus. &gt;&gt; All our warings and fussings and stewings and arguings and tempers, all these things pass away. Now he goes on down a little bit further in the quote and says, "But the fruit of the spirit is first love." Love who? &gt;&gt; Then is when you love those who are unlovable. &gt;&gt; Have you ever dealt with people that just a stinking rotten and sorry good no good for nothing low down bunch of trash? Oh my &gt;&gt; that ain't even worth loving. I ain't wasting my love. &gt;&gt; But if you're that short, I advise you not to &gt;&gt; until you get this dose. &gt;&gt; Because you get this dose, it makes you love the unlovable. Now, let's just be honest, friends. There's something about us as humans. There are certain people that we can love easier than others. &gt;&gt; Yes. Well, we're certainly glad to have so many angels here with us today. Y'all tricked me there for a minute cuz you're looking like regular people that come into church here and you out on their clothes, I guess. And I I just didn't recognize it. We're going to have to hang up a a special coat rack out there, I guess, for angelic wings so y'all can hang them out there. And you're fluttering me so much up here. Come on. You see, God can love people that would spit in his face. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? Spirit is first love. Love who? Then is when you love those who are unlovable. That's the spirit of Christ. Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, meekness, gentleness, patience. There's the fruit of the spirit. Again, he said, "Love moved a mighty God. God so loved the world, the unlovable, till he came down and made himself flesh here on earth. and dwelt among men to be spit upon and mistreated and be laughed at and made fun of them fun and to redeem us back. What ought we to do tonight? Take our places by the side of the cross and say, "Here I stand, Lord Jesus. I come. I come. I wash all my sins away. Take my malice. Take my difference away from me. Let me love you, Lord, with a fervent love. Then all these little old things will pass away. &gt;&gt; You see, this is something about God that I'll have to say I never I never realized until I came to the message. And as I've been studying this in the last week and a half or so, it's made more real to me why that some of the folks who've pulled away from the message that they really don't want the message and they can't live &gt;&gt; this kind of a lie. &gt;&gt; Now, it's much easier for them to read portions of scripture in the Bible with no preacher really preaching on. So, they just select out certain scriptures and oh yes, I'm a Christian and I'm I'm this that and the other. But a prophet had a way of bringing it down where the, you know, where the rubber meets the road type of thing. And as I begin, look at this, I realized, oh, so this is one of the reasons why I'm leaving the message. I'm getting away from all I'm leaving this and other. So what what part are they leaving? &gt;&gt; They're leaving love and mercy and forgiveness. And &gt;&gt; come on, &gt;&gt; cuz our message is full of love. It's full of mercy. It's full of grace. Yes. &gt;&gt; But I realize, brother Dave, a lot of these folks, it's evident by what they turn into once they leave. They cannot live this word. &gt;&gt; And neither can you and I unless he himself gets in. &gt;&gt; Now notice this attribute about God. God is a lover. Now this is preached the year I was born, 1956. And I want all those years of my life fearing God. Even after I become a preacher, I was scared of God. And I got under a fear even in Pentecost that if I did not fast every week, I was afraid. I was afraid God wouldn't use me. I was afraid of this. I'm afraid of that. So I fast three days, 5 days, 7 days, 10 days. Longest I ever went was 14. Setting up tents, driving tents, stakes, all kinds of things. It's wonder we hadn't died. Ain't Harry? I've seen my wife fast till she's so weak she couldn't hardly get out of the bed. Something wrong with fasting? No, nothing wrong with fasting. But it's the idea that you're doing it under. And it becomes such a bondage and a fear. If I did not fast, God would not use me. And if I made a mistake, he's out to get me. And if I mess up, he's going to get me. You said, "That's crazy, is it?" Brother Brandham said he used to think God hated him, but Jesus loved him. &gt;&gt; But he found out that it's the same person. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, that's what the message done for him. It's no wonder that he could bring love to us like this because that's the way he looked at it, too. &gt;&gt; But look what it does. What the message does to release you from that type of fear. &gt;&gt; God is a lover. God is love. And God so loved the world when they were unlovable that he gave his son to make them lovable. Here it is. God wants to come down and make love to you. Listen at these adjectives and verbs together. He's seeking verb action. Thirsting, hungering, trying to get to some of your starchy hearts to make love to you. Can you imagine that you and I have something that almighty God wants? And you know why he hungers? Cuz we deprive him. &gt;&gt; Now, wouldn't it be so foolish? I get thirsty enough. I'm going to drink this. But wouldn't it be so foolish if I was so thirsty in parts and y'all sitting there thinking, "Brother Donnie, drink it. Son, drink it. What's the matter with you?" What if I go to drink and somebody go, "Oh, no. You can't have the Hey, hey, don't you don't you do that. And God says, "I want to make love to you. I want to pull you up close to me and whisper my secret things to you. I loved you before the world began." And you're mine. But when you ain't working, you're fishing. And when you ain't fishing, you're playing video games. And when you ain't playing video games, you're sleeping. &gt;&gt; And when you ain't sleeping, you're hawking. And when you ain't hucking, you're polishing your car. And when you ain't doing that, you're doing this and doing that and doing that and doing that and doing that. &gt;&gt; And about the only time I get is three times a day. Lord Jesus, bless his food. Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; And then when you lay down 10 seconds before your eyes fall asleep because you're so wore out because you've been so busy. &gt;&gt; Man, I'll tell you one thing. golfing and playing kickball and football and baseball and basketball and soccer and horseback riding and hiking and boating and fishing. That stuff wears you out, don't it? And then at night, Lord God, I forgot to tell you our electric bills passed due and our mortgage. Baby, God help me. Me and my kids, my wife's been fixing me. Throw down the God, I ain't churching over there. Lord God, you see the alternator went out on a car and I had a blowout on my Jeep coming to church today. And God, I've got this and I've got that. I wonder if we make him feel like a JC Penney store or Sears and Robuck catalog. So, we place in our order. No thanks. No appreciation. No, I loved you sir. No, you mean everything to me. And another day you lived your life and your short existence. And let me remind you about your life. Speaking of life, it is as a vapor. David said, "Your days are like the span of a hand. So if a man lives three score in 10 70 years and this is your span 20 30 40 this is your span of your life like a vapor a mist that appears on the earth and it's gone. &gt;&gt; So one day leads to another and another and oh I'm going to do better absolutely I I made up my mind I'm going to do better but I just can't do it today. I've already got all these things going and all this stuff planned. And you know what? The devil will make sure tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day and the next day and then before you know it, you look at yourself and you're 50, 60, 70 years old and you think, "Oh no, I had all these great intentions. Speak to us, Lord. &gt;&gt; He's seeking, thirsting, hungering, trying to get some of your starchy hearts to make love to you as a love affair. Not fear, not bondage, a love affair. Not a law, but a love. It's all love. God so loved. My prayer is for the church that we can have such love till we love people whether they love us or not. &gt;&gt; That's what the church needs today is to express a love even to a man that could spit in your face. Now he's bringing you &gt;&gt; like Jesus. And you could still with not from a hypocritical standpoint, but from your heart pray for that man's soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. If you can just love those who love you while the sinners do the same thing, but we're different. When Christ has come into our heart, we love those who do not love us. Love the unlovable. And when we were unlovable one time too, you know, and Christ loved us until we came to him. Then if we be of Christ and Christ is in us, we have the same spirit of fellowship. Listen to this. And cooperation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And helping to try to move the great load and make life a little easier. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. for your fellow man. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Brothers, let's skip a few and I'll close here. Come over to Thou Knowest All Things in Hammond in Indiana, 1952. Let's stand together. We'll pick it up again, Lord willing. There isn't nothing else that you can do, only believe. And if you believe, then them little immoral things would just drop off like that. As you believe, you become love, &gt;&gt; not loving love. &gt;&gt; So, you love those that hate you. It's strange, I know. You hate the sin, but love the sinner. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You hate the wrong and the wickedness and whatever that people do. But if we're not careful, we'll merge that hatred for their sin over to them and we will look at them. We're calling it zeal. Oh yeah, zeal. Boy, I'm so zealous for God. I wonder if God would call it that. &gt;&gt; Or if God would call it hate, but we're thinking it's our hatred for their sin. Is it really? &gt;&gt; Is it really? Or do we look at them with such pity &gt;&gt; and pray that God can deal with them, &gt;&gt; godliness? Who wants to be more godly? &gt;&gt; Me too. Let's bury it. I was sinking deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore, very deeply stained with sin, sinking to rise. pass no more but the master of oh thank you Lord heard my despairing cry [Music] from the waters lifted me now save and let's sing it together now. Need to change the chords. Love lifted me. Love lifted me. Ain't God where nothing else could help love lifted me. Can we sing it together? Oh, God's love lifted me. [Music] Love lifted near. When nothing else could help, love lifted me. Oh, praise God. all my heart to him I give. Ever to him I will cling. Don't you feel that way today? In his blessed presence live. Thank you Lord God. Ever his praises I'm going to sing. Love so mighty and so true merits my soul's best song. Faithful loving service to to him. Everybody now. Oh, can we just close our eyes and raise our hands and sing it to him now? Love lifted me. Everybody with all your heart. Love lifted me when nothing else. Oh God, help us, Lord. We're so grateful for the love you give to us. Help us, Lord God, to express that gratitude by giving that same love to others. Those that are unlovable, those Lord God that aren't even worthy as we'd say. But Lord God, love through us, Jesus. When nothing else could help, love lifted. Listen to that first verse again. I was sinking. I was sinking so deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore. Thank you, Lord God. Sing it to him now. Very deeply stained within. I had gone down for the last count, sinking to rise no more. Oh, but thank God. But the master of the sea, he heard my despairing cry from the wall that's lifted me now. Save am I. Oh, God's love lifted me. Everybody sing it with all your heart now. Love lifted me. Thank you, Lord. When nothing else could have his love. Oh, his love it lifted me. Thank God it lifted me where nothing else could help. Love lifted [Music] me. Oh, it lifted me. Thank you, Lord God. Hallelujah. Live through me, Holy Spirit. Praise God. Now I realize today I might have preached the first Corinthian phase of this, but hopefully I can come back maybe next week or week after that and preach the second Corinthian phase of this. And maybe I can say I'm so sorry you were made sorry. But I'm just sorry you wasn't made sorry. to worldly sorry because then you'd be sorry like everybody else out here that's sorry but I'm so glad you was made sorry with a godly sorrow. &gt;&gt; And now I can see the smile on your face that that godly sorrow worked repentance and you asked the Lord to help you to be a better person. How I long to preach my last second Corinthian sermon when the people have attained to what God knows is the final mark and the capstone will come down and cap us off. [Music] Let's sing this together now. Oh Jesus, we live through. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit, live through me. &gt;&gt; Live through me, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Don't just preach to me, Lord, but live through me. &gt;&gt; I will be your house to dwell in. through history. Praise the Lord God. Hallelujah. I will be that good Samaritan to some else indeed. Live through me. Holy Spirit come all sing together through me. Same words again. Hol live through me. Holy Spirit lives through me. I will be yours to dwell in live through me. I will be that good Samaritan to some else in need. Live through me. Holy Spirit live through me and love through me. Holy Spirit, love through me. [Applause] I want to be your house to dwell in so you can love through me. Let me be that good Samaritan to some else in need. Love through me. Holy Spirit, love through me. Forgive through me. Holy Spirit, forgive through me [Laughter] [Applause] as I lift my hands in worship. forgive through me. I will be that good Samaritan to some else in need. Forgive through me. Holy Spirit forgive through me. Flow through me. Holy Spirit flow through me. I will be your house willing flow through me. [Applause] I will be that good Samaritan to some else in need. flow through me. Holy Spirit, flow through me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Love through me. &gt;&gt; Love me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit, love me. through me. [Applause] Lord God, I will be your house to dwell in love through help. I will be that good Samaritan return to someone else in love through me. Holy Spirit love. Oh Lord God, help us. Jesus, shine through me. Holy Spirit, shine through me. Let the light of your word, Lord, shine through me. [Applause] Let this dying world around us see that Jesus is still alive. Shine through me. Holy Spirit, shine through me. Flow through me. Holy Spirit flow through me. [Applause] [Music] I will be your house to dwell in. Flow through me. [Music] Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord Jesus. Let me be that good. We worship you today Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh we worship you Lord Jesus. Flow through me. Holy Spirit live through me. Holy Spirit, love through me. Holy Spirit, love through you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Praise your name, Lord. We worship you, Lord. We worship you, Lord. Can we just raise our hands now with just all of our hearts and the sincerity in our hearts? Let's just give Jesus a little bit of loving today until we get there where we physically can put our arms around him. Believe it or not, he wants your loving. He wants you to take time to tell him how you feel about him and what he means to you. Hallelujah. Even angels cannot replace you when it comes to that. So before we go, can we just give Jesus a little bit of our loving which is reserved only for him. We love our children. Us brothers love our wives and sisters love your husbands. We love our grandchildren. We love many, many things of life. But what about Jesus? You get home, your little dog will go to run up in your lap or your cat or whatever you have and you see your grandkids after church and you'll open up your arms and say, "Come here and see Poppy or come and see Grammy." Whatever it is you say. Why? Cuz you want a little bit of loving from them. What if you can magnify that a millions of times the Lord God has his arms opened up to us today saying, "Children, give me a little of your loving." Oh, hallelujah. Jesus, we worship you, great Adonai. We were lost, but you found us. We were wretched. We were blind. And we were naked, but you clothed us. You changed us. You transformed us. And now you've made us your bride. &gt;&gt; So if you are a lover, oh hallelujah, and we're to be godly, then we are to be a lover, too. We know Satan patterns himself the same way. So he wants his children to be lovers of the world and the things of the world and we can see that in them. They love it. Then heavenly father we also are a lover. A lover of God, a lover of purity, of righteousness, of honesty, integrity, character. We love to worship you. We love to praise you. We love to sing. It may seem odd and unusual, but I love to lift my hands when I feel absolutely nothing. I love to lift my voice when I feel nothing cuz I &gt;&gt; am a lover and I don't love the devil and I don't love his world, but I love you &gt;&gt; and your children and your cause and your intention and your purpose and your motives. I love you, my Jesus. Hallelujah. Oh, we worship you, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Can we just worship him now? Just just take a couple of minutes and I'll let you go. I don't mean to wear you out when we get together, but I just love to be in his presence so much myself. I don't know about you, but I have to fight hell every day of my life. And when I get in his presence, I don't get in no hurry to leave. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I want to sit at your feet, &gt;&gt; drink from this cup in your hand, &gt;&gt; Lord God, back against you and breathe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Feel your heartbeat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus. &gt;&gt; This love is so deep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's more than I can understand how you rest in your peace. It's overwhelm. &gt;&gt; That's it. Children, &gt;&gt; just love on him. Just love him. Take him. &gt;&gt; The more I seek you. &gt;&gt; Whisper to him. I love you, Jesus. I love you, Jesus. The more I find you. Oh, the more I find you, [Music] &gt;&gt; my Lord, the more I love you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus. We worship you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to sit at your feet. Drink from this cup in your hands. Lay back again. back against and brea. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Feel your heart be. &gt;&gt; This love is so deep. &gt;&gt; It's more than I can understand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I rest in your peace. It's overwhelming. The more I seek you with all your hearts now. Oh, the more I find you, my Lord. The more I find you, the more it makes me love you. Want to sit at your feet. What an honor to sit at your feet in your hand. Lay back against you and breathe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Feel your heart. This love is more than I can understand. I rest in your peace. It's overwhelming. [Music] Hallelujah Jesus. Hallelujah Jesus. We worship you father. We bless your name Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. How many can say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord, be in his presence. Oh, it's good to be with one another, but that ain't nothing compared to being in his presence. God bless you, saints. I love you in the Lord. I'll see you Wednesday night. Amen. God bless you. You're such an awome God. So mighty. So holy, so wonderful. Jesus, you're an awesome God. So selfless, so generous, so faithful you are. You're such an awesome God. So mighty, so holy, [Applause] so wonderful. You're an awesome God. So selfless, so generous, [Music] so faithful you are.
