road brother frank amen god is certainly providing a wonderful way for us here in this end time and i know tonight if you're a believer in this message it's not because you dread it i don't believe it's because somebody's twisting your arm making you believe it but i believe if you're believing the end time message it's because you rejoice in your heart to be able to believe such a thing oh listen friend if you stop thinking about a minute the day you saw it how many million people was passed over the day you saw it the day i saw it how many million people was passed over so when you stop and think about it you're one in a million maybe one in two million all but what a privilege it is that god would let us believe and see and know the truth for this great hour that we're living in well if it's new to you if you'll stick around long enough you'll hear about it i'm sure because god is certainly moving in the earth in this great end time and to even be a part of it a little significant bunch of people that don't have a lot of wealth to their name a lot of nobodies more than anything but when you come right down to we are the body part of the body so what a great privilege god has bestowed on you and me tonight to get to believe this great and glorious gospel let's sing that little course tonight why don't you stand to your feet let's sing that little course

[Music] in god's words is a wonderful amen we're going to pray again tonight we have some prayer requests we're going to let you know about uh while i've got it handed here we'll just take them in the order that i've got them written out uh peyton our little grandson is sick tonight i don't know if he's trying to the croup's trying to get on he's losing his voice and i'd appreciate if you just remember him in prayer tonight as we go before the lord uh sister aveda collins says please pray for joretta stockton her granddaughter courtney from over in kentucky they're both very sick so we want to pray for that need tonight here's a here's a prayer request to please remember uh melvin and becky lynch they have a very very special unspoken prayer request the lord knows all about that need tonight so we just want to remember them sister ivy blair turns this in to please pray for her father he's in the hospital for extensive tests and he seems partially paralyzed from the waist down more importantly pray for his soul that he would turn to the truth in christ sister ivy blair may god bless that man tonight as we pray here's the testimony you get certainly good to see brother jim gold back in the service tonight i saw him come in amen brother jim god bless you amen brother jim wants to offer this word of testimony says i want to thank the lord for healing me he kept me from having an operation that the doctor said it couldn't be done in other words the doctor said this operation operation had to take place is that right but jesus said no it don't amen so we praise the lord for that tonight amen amen brother gene littleton turns us in please have a prayer request for doris bacon who has cancer and is in very serious condition condition i want to pray for that need tonight sister bonnie turn this in please pray for my neighbor she needs a job also pray for her daughter who has a physical problem in her body so we want to remember all these prayer requests tonight all the unspoken prayer requests in the building tonight i know there's many many needs among us i'm going to tell you something friend as we say so often here and it's not just words coming out of my mouth that god is more than able to meet your need tonight he not only is able he's more than a conqueror to meet the needs whatever you would have in your life tonight why don't you just commit them to the lord brother bill why don't you come tonight if you would take us to the lord in prayer as you pray you just ask god to move on these needs we just seek his his divine will whatever he would will that's what we want to settle for amen god bless you tonight brother bill appreciate you good to see you you know we know we follow a progressive revelation and i believe part of that progressive revelation is the lord progressively revealing to us more and more day by day how really great he is and how each one of these needs he can meet seeing brother jim in the hospital and then see him out ah what a miracle knowing that god has done that he can do it again we just believe that heavenly father we stand here today lord with needs that are written out held between human fingers lord and there's not a bit of power there to be able to change a single situation but lord outside of that and looking over into the other dimension the other realm lord where all is so much more real than what we see here all power is given to us in the name of jesus christ and lord we know that every single need that has been written out everyone that's been testified to by the raising of the hand every one of them is well known in your sight lord jesus and sometimes i picture in my mind you standing there reaching out your hands to us longing for us to believe just a little more and that needle be met because lord we know it's on condition of our faith that you've already provided the way brother branham taught us you couldn't heal us if you were here but you already paid the price and it's up to us to reach out and claim it and to see brother jim lord to realize that he got to a place or maybe the situation was right whatever in your timing but they were able to reach out and claim and we see a manifestation lord we in this church have seen that over and over and over again we know you're alive we know your power is real we know you're here and you're present and you're able and you're willing but oh god help us tonight to to somehow take hold of the faith lord jesus to believe that each one of these needs will be met lord it would do our hearts good to realize that you have moved on the scene that we have reached out to you successfully and there would be testimony after testimony after testimony brought in and read before this congregation of what mighty things the lord god of heaven has done lord we know you're the same that you always were we know that this message has proclaimed that great scripture jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever and we believe that lord we are some in this end time that stand upon that truth may we just claim it tonight for every need lord god move in a mighty way as you do over and over and may we be receptive may that the spirit of god have liberty tonight may you bless our pastor lord open your mouth in him and close his lips lord that we might receive truly and purely from you as you do so often thank you lord in the name of jesus christ and we lift up that name in glory and honor amen and brother amen god bless you can be seated tonight ushers if you'll come at this time we'll receive the evening offering you give us unto the lord while they're doing that tonight just a few announcements that we need to make brother brother daniel nunley and brother alan butcher wants the people

postponed that until uh sunday july the 12th so remember that if you you maybe had got word that this coming sunday they were going to take certain pictures just uh remember that'll be put off until july the 12th brother michael bailey says he wants to wish his wife a very happy 12th wedding anniversary so i want to wish brother michael and sister yody happy anniversary tomorrow morning at nine o'clock there's going to be a work day here at the church for the sisters so you need to remember that if at all possible for you to come at nine o'clock in the morning the the meeting starts of course friday night and all the sisters gonna be here working trying to get things tidied up and looking good for the meeting gonna have a lot of folks coming in and different things so remember that in the morning at nine o'clock please leave your children with somebody don't leave them at home alone but get somebody to watch out after them don't bring any of your small children up here because it would just hinder the the work so please remember that if you can come they need your help please please try to be here in the morning at nine o'clock remember that now the deacons want want me to make these announcements uh please announce that any carpooling for this weekend services would be very much appreciated please make an effort to share rides with family etc to save on the parking spaces also announce that we would like to ask for those who can to park on the hill and leave the lower parking lots for our visitors especially any of the young people that would be driving if you could maybe park in these areas out here do that and let's give the this parking lots to the our senior citizens and and to our visitors please remember that also we would like for any volunteers this is on a volunteer basis only to sit in the fellowship hall with the large monitor to give room for visitors we know we have never asked this before but is only on a volunteer basis and for those who would think they could watch the services on the monitor and not be distracted by it or the location we realize not everyone would be able to go to the fellowship hall and watch the services on a monitor so this is strictly on a personal and volunteer basis even for only one service so if you think you could do that and would be willing to they certainly they certainly would appreciate that because it'll be a quite quite a struggle for everybody to get in this auditorium so let's just kind of work together and and do the best that we can and be uh be christians be good social christians

burdens down i feel like singing just since i'm feeling better so much better since i've laid my burdens down with glory glory hallelujah hallelujah since i'm laying my burdens down you lord jesus praise be to god how many feels better since you laid your burdens down let's turn tonight if you would to romans chapter nine brother michael i took the game down on the top left to probably take the slide up quite a bit more than normal romans chapter 9. instead of going back into the book of revelation tonight i didn't hardly get finished on choices we make so we'll look at that tonight if you don't mind and we're going to if you do so it'd probably just be good if you'd enjoy it because we're going to do it either way i felt felt in my heart that we should look at this while we're here i deem it very important myself when the lord leads us to go a certain direction romans chapter 9 verse 10 not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done good any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that call us it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated believes that's just if you understand it correctly it is [Music] jacob have i loved but esau have i hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god god forbid for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion so then it is not of him that will us nor of him that run us but of god that show us mercy for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised thee up that i might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth let's bow our heads together lord jesus we counted a great privilege once again that we can gather here tonight realizing that we're a blessed people first of all to know you as our savior to be redeemed from the world of sin that we were born in what a privileged lord and then there's so many many more blessings that we could name a church to go to brothers and sisters that love us a message a prophet so many things lord you've done for us and we're grateful we pray tonight father that you would help us in this service may our hearts be enlightened to hear and understand the word of god in jesus name and the saints said may be seated you know it seems uh quite difficult when we go to looking at choices that we make and how much those choices might intervene in our lives and even the lives of other individuals and concerning our our destiny our choice our walk with god in life and so many things that we could look at that our choice is what determines so many things that happen to us and yet we believe that god before the foundation of the world knew every person that would ever be saved every person that would not be saved god knew ever fly ever flee every net every dog and every cat and god knew every human being god just knew it all but still god's providence of his divine sovereignty does not override us as human beings having a choice and as we looked at it this past weekend and realizing that the choices that we make in life can have such an effect on us and our family on our grandchildren on down on down on down because those choices can affect people for generations to come but we realize then that god by his grace could not justly ordain a man to go to hell ordain another man to go to heaven without first being justified in doing so now god could not by his own desire predestinate anyone to be saved or by his own desire predestinate anyone to be lost now don't get caught on me already i just got started but yet we know that god foreknew every creature that would ever have eternal life and we know that the book of life was written when the night you got saved before the foundation of the world so how could we reckon it all together well when we look at at free moral agency and we realize that the first beings that were given what we call free moral agency it was not man it was before man was created actually the first beings that were granted a free moral agency choice the right to choose were angels the first thing of god's creation that brought him into the attributes of being god was angels he was all alone no one there to worship him but the first thing that he made and created was angels and then they began to worship him but now notice god put them on the same basis that you and i are on tonight god did not create sin can you say amen to that sin is not a creation god did not create the devil as we know him tonight in his condition how did satan become from lucifer the original archangel of god the covering cherub of god how did he become from that to becoming the devil by free moral agency god could not have created this being to be the devil to be lucifer to be the originator of sin and then at the end time cause him force him commit him into a lake of fire and be just in doing so because had god created the devil as we know him today in his condition that he is right now then everything that he has done down through the ages would have only been acting out what he was predestinated to do but god by foreign knowledge could put him on the basis of making a choice and knowing what he would choose then god could foreordain and predestinate by his foreknowledge knowing that satan would do this but in order to be just he had to put him on the basis that you're standing on tonight are you hearing me i'm talking about choices that we make in life now before you ever made your choice before i ever made mine before all the mortals that are living here before a free moral agency was ever exercised in the human race it was exercise and angelic beings let me just prove that to you that day on calvary the prophet says that this way sin did not start on the earth sin started in heaven lucifer the devil was a condemned creature for his disobedience before he ever struck the earth sin began in heaven where god put the angels on the same basis that he put the human being now if god could be just and condemning people to hell without giving them a choice amen without giving them a choice around a free moral agency then god could have created satan to be the evil corrupt fallen creature that he is he could have made satan to be evil unrighteous impure degradated all the things that the devil is then god could have done the same thing to the devil and been absolutely justified in doing so but you see god never created satan in the condition that we know him today the very reason that satan is the devil today is because by his own choice he chose to leave the realms of the holy presence of god he chose to leave his position as overshadowing the word and he chose to become an enemy against god amen now watch this he says oh my he said he put the angels on the same basis that he put them on now the tree of knowledge in the tree of life is before every human being and when lucifer was given the preeminence to make his choice he wanted something better than god had and that is where the trouble started now he said how i disagree with the universalists that say satan will be saved he sinned and he is the originator of sin his soul sinned and he will be totally annihilated now it was not that satan was created sin you follow me so far god cannot create sin because whatever comes out of god's being whatever that god creates is a part of his own being now if god could create sin then out of a holy righteous pure god would have to be an attribute inside of him which would be sin if god could create light then in him had to be an attribute of life if god created righteousness and in him had to be the attribute of righteousness so if god created sin then there had to be an attribute inside of god because every man is known by the product the product that he produces so as we look as the creation of god and we see the creation of god is only reflection of the product of the one who produced it so if evil come out of god sin come out of god if god created the devil and the way we know him today then brother sister i want you to look what we have attributed to our heavenly father we have attributed into him to be an attribute of evil an attribute of lying an attribute of death an attribute of sickness but sin is not a creation sin is a perversion and the first one that made the perversion was the devil himself on what basis freeball agency [Applause] choices we make you see it was not god that chose satan in that way he knew he would now foreign simply declares that god knew what would be and by for knowledge god could predestinate now what made satan any different on all the rest of the angels and yet the bible tells us in timothy that there were elect angels but all of those angels were put on the basis to where they could choose to remain with the word remain with christ or leave with lucifer which at that time was not the devil satan actually become the devil after his choice do you realize that people who hear the word of god and choose to go on and cut their hair paint their face live a wicked light don't you realize it is by their own choice expressed and they will get worse and worse and worse look at the devil at one time living in the presence of god and god did not create evil and put it in him and pre-program it as a software as it was on certain certain day in a certain certain month in a certain certain year this thing would kick in if that was created and put in the devil then you have got god being the creator of sin the creator of evil god did not put that in him he put him on the basis of choice and when the devil made his ultimate choice he chose sin he chose unbelief it was not god that chose that for the devil the devil chose it himself now watch his sin is not a christian i'll prove that to you manifested sons of god he said there was never such a thing as the creation of sin oh he said that didn't go down too good he said sin is not a creation no sir sin is a perversion god did not create sin sin was brought on the basis of free moral agency there's only one creator sin is righteous as perverted what is in adultery righteousness perverted truth misrepresented certainly what is a cursed word god's blessings turned around but he said sin is not a creation it is a perversion so if we have god being the author or the creator of sin that friend i don't mind telling you i think i'll stop serving him tonight because how do i know when we get up there at heaven more of that evil won't be expressed again if god created sin and if god created evil how do you know you go through all this life living for god and then you get there to heaven and god decides this evil street's going to come out of it again nonsense god is not evil are you hearing me praise the lord now what she said sin is not a creation there's nothing created but perfection now watch a man is known by his work so when god created lucifer what was he perfection does that bother you it's the truth when god created all the angels what were they perfect holy sinless righteous pure undefiled will you say how in the world have we got all this mess today by the free moral agency of one angel he made his choice oh praise the lord how many believes it's the truth now watch he said there's nothing that was created but perfection god created all things good and sin is not a creation he said god could not create sin because there's nothing in him to make it but now where did it come from the whole earth is filled with unbelief and darkness and all kinds of things that we wouldn't even want to talk about where did it come from did it come from the creation it came from a perversion god gave the original word and then this angel by his choice this angel made a choice down your nurse up there in heaven [Applause] oh my how many believes man is put on the same basis three moral agents oh brother dania i didn't have no choice and you got god being unjust you got god putting the devil on one basis god putting adam and eve on one basis god putting you on another praise the lord but brother donny what about all the seed gene and all that stuff it's still true all that i preached see on all that it's still true but this is true as well [Applause] now what man is on the basis of freedom all agency god could not take a man and say i'm going to make you do this and i'm going to make you be a lost man and i'm gonna make you be a saved man that would be that wouldn't be the nature of god amen you say why is it important i'll tell you why it's important because if you believe that god made a man to be lost and made another man to be a saved man you've got the nature of your father twisted around you're not looking at him right you're believing something about your father that is not the truth and it'll start there and it'll reflect itself on down the road somewhere else keep on going until it becomes a snowball in your life to where you finally get to a place that god will seem evil now listen to this friend if you want to mark this out it's of course it's just up to you but now he said god could not take a man and say i'm going to make you do this i'm going to make you be lost i'm going to make you be saved that wouldn't be the nature of god now he said he's not willing that any should perish he wants all to repent but he knew from the beginning who would perish and who would not bear us hallelujah hallelujah now watch he said he's not willing that it would be that way it was not that god said i hate this man i love this man i hate this woman i love this woman i hate this man i love that man you're my seed you're not my seed amy meany mighty mole no how could a just god do such a thing as that praise the lord he's not willing that it would be that way he wants all to come back to him but he knows who will and who what so by for knowledge he can make everything work according to his plan you understand now was talking about adam and eve he could not what she said he could not make them follow he let them get out there and free moral agency he could not make them do it no more than he could make the devil do it no more than he can make you do it you know why you go to hell because you want to oh the devil made me do it i'll tell you one thing both god and the devil are blamed for a lot of things neither one of them do [Applause] we blame god for a bunch of them when that don't work out we blame the devil as much as i hate that poor old sorry outfit he's blamed for a lot of stuff he just don't do a lot of it comes back to us oh i want to i want to do right i want to do this if you wanted to brother there wouldn't be enough devils out of hell to stop you but the bottom line is people don't want to do it they blame god or there's too many hypocrites in the church i ain't going to see the hypocrites i'm going to see jesus [Applause] [Music] you don't let that stop him from going to walmart do you you sure shouldn't let it stop you from coming to the house of god praise the lord amen now he said he could make him do it and be just but he could put him on free moral agency and let them do it themselves and he knew all the time they would but whose choice was it whose choice whose choice was it that the world got in the condition that it was in the choice of man god foreknew it but god did not make adam do it oh you say i want to go to heaven so bad i love the lord so bad but i'm afraid god won't let me go in you have to be contrary to god's nature if you love god with all your heart all your soul all your mind and your strength i'm not talking about loving god from your spirit now i'm talking about loving god from your soul he saw that in you before the foundation of the world now watch this he says he could not make sin because he's righteous and the father of righteousness could not make sin so you know what he done he made man in his own image knowing that he would fall and he put him on the basis of freemore agency now he said don't touch this tree but he knew that man would fail but yet he couldn't make man do it himself he had to let man do it and then when man did it he was able to pick him up and make himself savior praise be to god but now he could not make the man do it and then dwarven pick him up and say i'm your savior but he put him on the basis and he knew the man would do it choices we make oh praise the lord but brother donnie there's some people foreign to this condemnation that's exactly right that's right how how were they for ordained choices choices god foresaw i know this is tough on some of you but you better listen it's coming from the same message and we get all the other quotes from too in the same scriptures god listen to this he asked a question god make a man sin so he could punish him no he says no god make these people you're in johnson city make them to be perverts make them to be liars make him to be perverted in all sorts of manner so he can have somebody to take out his judgment on friend what kind of god are you serving you need to get the god of john 3 16. for god's so loved the bride they let the godly people look at the word in the original greek god so loved the cosmos oh brother dawning god saw that i was so good yeah right you're good all right you're good for nothing one for the grace of god i'll tell you what we'd be worse than a bunch of hogs walling around and sin that's right no he says god plays the first man adam and eve right here in the freemore agency and he places you the same way we say how does that kind of god's predestinated will right here it is friend and the only way you can ever get this thing fixed is your own self-will you have to will to do his will oh you said the number of the donut listen the scripture tells us god is not willing it is not the will of god that any human being go to hell [Music] who was hell created for who well how's humans going there choices we make in life he's not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance oh why don't they do it they choose not to [Applause] praise the lord saints oh you're saying hey brother don this confuses me it ain't been but probably three four weeks ago that you preached about you're reflecting where you're from that's right you said judas was born the son of perdition that's right you said he come from hell that's right and he went back to hell that's right but what part of judas come from hell the prophet of god tells us that same quote if you'd been listening that i read to you three weeks ago you'd have heard the god's prophet said the spirit that was on judas was what come from hell the spirit of judas was the antichrist it was not the body of judas that come from hell that went back to hell you say judas had a free moral agency if he didn't god was unjust [Music] hallelujah y'all with me okay i just want to make sure y'all want walmart or somewhere shopping donny judas absolutely matthew 27 3 then judas which had betrayed when he saw he was condemned repented himself and brought again the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders saying i have sinned not god made me do this i have sinned amen he once said our god should ever give me a chance he knew he made the choice and god foresaw that choice before the foundation of the world and god needed somebody that would play out that part and he saw what judas would do and when judas built the womb he earned the identification of the son of perdition by god's choice judas what did judas do he says what did he do he doubted christ's claims after he started to walk with him now you see many people get the idea that judas loved god with all of his heart oh he wanted to go to heaven he wanted to be right he wanted to do right but god said jesus i hate you and i'm not going to let you come to my heaven god never said that at all but god did foresee what judas would choose he needed a judas he needed a pharaoh he needed an esau but how could he use them if he pre-programmed him to do it and then them fall and obey exactly look for it look at it and write if a man is ordained of god to be a sinner and a man fulfills that part of being a sinner how can god throw him in hell and then god ordains another man to be a son of god and that man fulfills god's will too have not both of them done it amen then the center man is in the will of god just as much as you holy roller children are praise the lord the longer i preach more confused for some of y'all look [Music] if a man is living this life a sinner in the will of god how can god come up and say you didn't do what i told you yes i did god i drunk i lied i committed adultery i raped women i murdered i robbed banks i stole that's what you ordained me to be [Music] they're going to have to say well come on in you obeyed my word to the letter you feel my you fulfill my word there's so many sons of god over here i mean they complained about doing their will you didn't you got drunk you enjoyed it you lied you enjoyed it you stole you enjoyed it some other sons on this other side they growled and complained and crumbled and carried out is anybody in your sin daylight tonight now watch this judas doubted christ claims how could god say about this man you're the son of perdition he foresaw he said they'll never be nested in him and he actually put him on a basis to where he could follow jesus and from his soul make the choice i don't believe this this man is not right just like people who follow this message many of them start out oh my this is a prophet of god oh my this is the message there and then they go to finding things that don't line up with their old baptist theology or their old pentecostal theology you know what i begin to wonder about this message now i don't know now some of them quotes i tell one thing i can't make it line up with the scripture i didn't know you're supposed to you not head god never sent you to straighten out no prophet of god if i remember right he sent a prophet to god to straighten you out [Applause] everybody hello and judah started out that way but because he had a choice and he made that choice and what those fallen angels christian answers on hebrews 9 those fallen angels that fell from the original the state of god those spirits come and influence people on the earth then those angels that remain in the presence of god those spirits come and influence people and by the choice that you surrender to us which one you're under the influence of [Applause] choices we make well if i'm ordained i'll be there hallelujah i'm going to sin a little bit and smoke a little bit and run around smoke a little dope take a little crack but i'm ordained hallelujah one of these days gotta get a hold of me god don't shake me it ain't no wonder we got so many baptists around this message and presbyterian by the way some of them preach predestination you take the whole choice away and they got it in their mind it's like some kind of time bomb that's clear well if i'm a son god will break my leg break my nose i don't do something [Music] god can't even heal you over your will much less save you that is quotes god wants you to be healed god wants you to prosper and be in health is that the word how come some of you folks sick tonight god's want you to prosper is that the word i wish above all things that thou would has prosper and be in health even as thy soul prosper how come they got sick folks that's god's will your will is you'd rather be sick or you don't take care of yourself one praise the lord brother donny preach i'm gonna come over here one day make me an amen tape and i'm going to set it right back here and i'm going to say it in different voices amen amen amen and about every 10 minutes i'll just turn that thing on [Applause] so the folks that get these tapes we'll think everybody who's dead [Applause] hallelujah my my the prophet said what made judas turn he actually doubted the claims of christ being the word but now see we've got to remind many of us that one day judas is just walking along and his spiritual predestinated condemnation software kicked in one day he says [Music] no maybe there's one little thing jesus started saying and questions started flashing up then another then another it was not that there was some kind of spiritual software pre-programmed in his soul that he had no choice he had a choice just like you do oh at this certain time i just know at this certain time god's ordained a certain time for me to be set free many of you could be set free the very hour you want deliverance but you've got it in your mind that is programmed of god ordained of god i've got to go out here and live a wild life so i can know what it means to be saved that's a lie the prophet of god said i would have given my heart to the lord as a little boy but there was a dark shadow that hung over me [Music] [Applause] choices choices we make now can we go a little farther thank you let's look at this for knowledge now the brother said god actually made creatures and creatures failed then god by his infancy looked down through the stream of time and saw every man that would be saved every man he knew it before knowledge therefore by for knowledge he knew who would be saved and who would not be saved therefore he could pre-destinate by choice no i desire no by foreknowledge [Applause] amen you see he said it's not such a bad word after all is it he could predestinate because he knew who would and who would not god bias for knowledge seen exactly who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved and he sent jesus to save those he had already chosen [Music] praise be to god my brother donnie wait a minute if i had a choice and god had a choice what's the order of the choices who chose first me or god i'm going to answer i'm just going to leave it hanging for you you may get it though now what's that god now listen to this friend this is why it's important you've got the prophet of god making a direct statement something god could not do and yet some of you believe this very thing he said god could not do god could not say i'll take you and send you to hell and i'll take you and send you to heaven now look this ain't my words i'm reading to you statements from the message your message god could not say i'll take and send you to hell and i'll take and send you to heaven and you see why this is important that if you are telling people hey god looked at this man and said you're going to hell you're believing something bad about god you're attributing something evil into god's nature [Music] god wanted you both to go to heaven praise be to god but by for knowledge he knew which one of you would be a shyster and the other one would be a gentleman and a christian therefore he had to send jesus to die to save that man that he foreknew wanted to be saved oh hallelujah hallelujah but brother donnie i i thought you read dustin brother brown told us in 1965 when a little baby was born that little seed was in him yes but how was it there before knowledge that makes it just praise be to god now listen to this he's not willing that and he should perish but he's for knowledge let him know who would and who when this friend there's not just a few quotes on this you'll find this through the entirety of the whole message you'll find it from 47 to 65. the holy spirit come to seal into the body the wife of jesus christ that he foreknew before the foundation of the world you see being god in for knowledge he could receive who would receive him and who would not so the holy spirit come to get that bride amen amen i love this right here he says election looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks to destiny election looks back not to choice not to desire not to will but election looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks to destiny get this out of your mind oh i love god with all of my heart oh i want to go to heaven but god won't let me go get that devil out of your mind if you want to go to heaven and you love god with all your heart there ain't nothing can stop you from going he wants you there where do you think you got that desire he wanted you to have that desire [Applause] praise god a long time ago he says god foresaw that i would love him [Music] hallelujah so he made a perpetuation through his own son that i might become from a cocklebur to a grain of wheat some of you you probably remember when you were younger maybe you ran out here in the world and done many evil things but the lord dealt with you maybe when you as a teenager maybe when you was much younger than when you actually gave your heart to god and now you know many people say well i just wasn't ordained to come in at that time oh friend i'll tell you one thing if you look back now and realize there might have been many many things you would have spared yourself had you come to god when the holy spirit was drawing you many of us have lost precious years in our life because we fooled around on god we played around in this message instead of getting serious and sincere because somehow we think one day my software is going to kick him and i'm going to be delivered to this and this and this nonsense god wants you to be free and delivered by the power of the world he's putting it right in your life [Applause] he's waiting for you to rise and say it's my life victory peace power's mine but satan's got a side tract and we're just sitting around well i'm one of these days i'm ordained huh i'll get it these old cigarettes is killing me but glory to god one of these days i'll get set free i'll get delivered this thing that's bothering me glory to god one of these days god's got away predestinated yeah he's already got it pre-destined he's laying right before you waiting for you to make your choice he's already told you his will whom the son is made free it's free indeed i wish above all things you prosper and build hell my peace i've given to you ask that you might receive joy all these things are as well now he says he looks and says okay lord what about it look friend a real child of god when you know your place there's certain things you don't even have to ask the will of god about i don't have to come to church tonight and say lord do you want me to praise you huh lord now what's your will tonight is it your will for me to clap my hands lord i i want your will i i want to know your will lord should i raise my voice and praise you or should i wait till i hear from you lord should i cut my hands every service they want me to clap my hands lord but i've been thinking maybe i should feel red to clap my hands what psycho ward was you in god's none told you his will god's done told you if your priest come to the house of god to praise him you don't have to feel led to praise him you don't have to feel loud to worship him you don't have to feel led to pray it's his will pray without ceasing and everything he fights it's his will lifting up holy hands without wrath and you don't need the will of god for that he's done told you [Applause] [Music] i didn't have to get down tonight before coming said say lord is it your will that i preached tonight lord i really don't feel led to go to church is it your will that i go to church tonight lord or you want me just at home not lord and maybe rest there's certain things you don't need the will of god and you've already got it written out right here before [Music] praise the lord nah my voice is good and it the holy spirit come to seal into the body the wife of jesus you believe that absolutely now watch this he said now predestinate it isn't i'll choose brother neville and i i i won't choose brother beeler that isn't it [Music] that's not predestination it's for knowledge that knew which one would be right that's predestined well you said brother daniels before the seals well how about one out of the seals first seal page 125 the lamb and the time of intercessory he knew that there was names that was put in that book from the foundation of the world and as long as them names have never been manifested on the earth yet he used to stay there as an intercessor do you get it perfectly predestination all right now by his for knowledge he saw them not by his will his will was that none should perish but by his foreknowledge he knew who would and who would not why christ speak i firmly believe the foreknowledge of god not that god is willing that any should perish but all should come to repentance praise be to god he had to know he knew the end from the beginning and see if he doesn't then he isn't infinite so he wasn't willing that any should perish but he knew who would and who would not now he said the very reason that jesus came to the earth was to save those that god through his foreknowledge saul wanted to be saved how many want to be saved [Applause] now if that was truth when you raised your hand god saw you before the foundation of the word put your name on his book and when you come to this earth there's a seed of representation down inside of you how though by for knowledge now watch this oh praise god he's seen those that wanted to be saved because the whole world was condemned i don't see how you can teach it any other way than the foreknowledge of god now if you teach predestination whether in the four knowledge of god you're teaching it wrong amen by far knowledge he could predestinate superc super sign november 63 not by his desire not by his desire i love this one i hate that one i want this one don't want that one you would have god predestinated by his desire which would mean god was evil god doesn't predestinate by his desire [Music] so all these millions of people that come up before the throne of god that have lived through time billions i should say every one of them will receive a just judgment it will not be that god predetermined their destiny without ever giving them a choice but god foresaw what they would choose god knew exactly what they would do when the gospel was preached to them and they will stand there living their life out as a sinner knowing that they received a one day a call on their heart the spirit of god dealt with them in order to be just he's got to deal with them that way and they turn down that call and justly god can say depart from me you work of iniquity i never knew you you chose where you're going praise the lord saints my my god knows who will and who won't so therefore he can predestinate he's not willing that any should perish well don't you've read some of the same things right and i'm going to read some more too because i want you to realize this is not just something hatched out in one or two quotes and put together there's hundreds of places we must pull it together friends you'll find in any doctrine it's easier to believe it this way or this way the hardest part of any truth is right here the human mind will catch it quicker here or there but it takes revelation to stand here it takes prayer it takes study and sometimes it takes commitment of saying god i just can't tie it together but people who lean over this way they can explain it almost down to the letter people who lean over this way can explain it almost down to the letter but people who stand in the middle they rely on god they can't rely on their own understanding their own knowledge well i don't understand this and don't understand that but somehow it all has got to come together praise god hallelujah we're going to the father all right now watch this he predestinated us this is proving his word in 1964 unto the adoption of children by jesus christ god did not say i'll choose you and don't choose you friends i want to know how come some of y'all believe he did amen god didn't say that but his foreknowledge knowed what you would do hallelujah praise be to god because that's the way he predestinates by for knowledge not that he desired that this person be saved and this one be lost but he knew who would be lost and who would be saved therefore by his foreknowledge he can predestinate harvest time 1964. seeds not here 65. god knew before the foundation of the world who would be saved and who knew would not be saved by predestination by foreknowledge he saw every member and put your name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and jesus come to seek that which was on the book be to god how by foreknowledge amen trying to do god of service but god so has his word said in all ages his foreknowledge has caused him to set it in the church and in the people certain things that he did from the beginning and he only would be revealed to those certain people the rest of them won't see it that's predestination not that he did it you say i'll choose you don't choose you no but by his foreknowledge he know who would and who would not jehovah jireh god by foreknowledge knew who would be saved and he sent jesus amen to catch those that he foresaw wanted to be saved [Applause] now let's go back now to what we open with tonight in romans jacob have i loved and he saw have i hated oh i've stumbled people for centuries since paul said that you notice paul is quoting from malachi 1. and this is where he gets at that and you know it would seem quite confusing if you really didn't didn't have a vindicated message to clarify it for you because paul didn't really clarify it he just said it and let it go with that but yeah the prophet said did you ever read in romans 9 how before either boy was born he saw in jacob god said i hate one and love the other how can he be just and do that here's the answer by foreknowledge he knew what a rascal he saw was praise be to god then he could predestinate and put something down inside of jacob that would make jacob do it but if god predestinated over the top of jacob's will then esau could stand there on the day of judgment and said you gave him something that you didn't give me [Music] praise the lord are you seeing daylight all right some of you praise the lord somebody's still in dark well hang on maybe we'll get you there before we get over now he said but for knowledge he knew what an hour rascal that he saw was so he could predestinate not just say now watch this not just say the word predestination it's not a good word to use he said it's for knowledge because he wouldn't just deliberately turn you away because he wants you to go away he's not willing that any of you would perish but all would all would come to repentance faith of abraham before jacob or esau was either one born god could say he saw if i hated him jacob have i loved because he foreknew what they would be now notice this he never made esau the way he was now hold on friends he never made esau the way he was how come he saw was that way because he saw made choices in life [Music] oh i was predestined to backside i was predestinated this and other nonsense you chosen life god did not make esau that way he chose to be that praise the lord amen i'll tell you what i thank god for this amen he never made he saw the way he was now listen to this he wasn't willing that he saw me that way by but esau by choice was that way choices we make now friends let me tell you who makes these women to this day strip their clothes off and walk around in many skirts and real tight clothes and bob the house and dress like on the what who makes the men of this day put earrings in their noses and earrings in their ears they go around wearing rings ain't on their fingers to our rings so now they start wearing them on their toes my goodness what in the world doesn't matter folks [Music] you mean it was god that makes the young people of this day the young men and i've seen them in airports that if i didn't know no better i think i was in a zoo somewhere come down this side of their their head sticking straight up like they plugged the wrong thing into the electric socket and this will strike down on this side purple up here pink here and yellow that you mean god made people like that god wanted every one of them punks or whatever they call themselves their weirdos god was not willing that they'd be like that they chose that themselves every homosexual every lesbian ever adulterer ever liar god never made them that way oh they say god made us this way that's a lie from the devil [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] they chose it [Applause] god never made the sodomites perverts and then caused an earthquake and caused all the pitch and the tar to explode around sodom and burn them up they chose to be that and god sent judgment on them by their own choice [Applause] amen god never wanted east ought to be that way but esau was that way and god looked way ahead and said i hate esau but i love jacob how about full knowledge choices we make choices we make he saw by choice god knew he would go that way now watch again god's covenant with abraham god being god before the foundation of the world know who would be saved and who would not he could say that he hated esau and loved jacob before either one of them was born for by foreknowledge he knowed what a little shaster that he saw would be and he knew he would save jacob's soul therefore by foreknowledge he knew these things would be he's not willing but for knowledge let him know it he could predestinate according to foreign knowledge now listen to this there is people as bad as we want to say it that were born to eternal destruction not predestination by his will but by his for knowledge so you see friend when we attribute to god god ordained this bunch of tribes out here to go to hell god hates them when we say that and we project that by god's desire look we want what we are putting in god evil hatred that is not in god [Music] now men use evil men you've got hatred all kinds of things by the natural birth sometimes if you're converted that's out of you but god ain't god no such a stuff let me go a bit farther and i'll start you see not that god wanted to condemn esau but he knew god knows everything not because he wanted to but because his foreknowledge let him know who would and who would not he didn't say i'm going to choose you and i'm going to send you to hell i'm going to choose you and i'm going to send you to hell that was not god's idea god said i love jacob and eddie saw his foreknowledge let him know that esau was nothing but a shyster let's stand together we'll pick it up again oh brother donny if we are thoughts of god did god wait till i made my choice before he made his choice and if we're thoughts of god we always were in the mind of god weren't we sure those thoughts were right amen right those thoughts were eternal but not the person [Music] some of you all have got eternal persons in heaven there is no eternal persons in heaven there was an eternal person we don't believe in eternal sonship around here and jesus or us there's no such a thing as eternal sonship it's the eternal elohim now let me close church age book page 154 before i close on this subject i know there is a question in your minds you will want to know if i believe in the doctrine of pre-existence i don't believe in that mormon doctrine or pre-existence of souls any more than i believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of souls but be careful here and see this it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god it is the word or seed it is not the person these people you understand is not these persons here that come eternally predestinated from god but it is the word or the seat how how do we we as human beings repopulate the earth comes from the man right the man carries the seed within himself well god wanted to populate the earth and how would it be by his sea not as the man but his seed was his word so these thoughts were always in the mind of god not the eternal person was in the mind of god but this thought was in the mind of god now in order to project these thoughts into certain human beings and be just because if he deposits a thought in one certain human being and don't put it in another human being at the end of the way that human being will say you gave them a great advantage they had a deposit i didn't that's what made them love you that's what made them serve you i didn't have a fighting chance i was born a sinner i didn't have no representation i didn't have no seed i didn't have nothing so he's got to project them thoughts in the right way how is he going to do it by foreknowledge it does not change your identity with him but it only puts you in the right way as thoughts not as persons praise be to god it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god it is the word of the seed you see way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed jacob have i loved but he saw have i hated neither was born neither had done good or evil but it was the thought of god based how on foreknowledge now here's these thoughts in god's mind i want children children of my own now it wasn't that he said little donny little bill little jim little joe little fred little carol little marshall little so-and-so and so no that there was his thoughts in his mind how am i going to get these thoughts expressed and justly do it so we look down through the stream of time from the very beginning to the end and saw the billions of souls that would live and seeing what every one of them would do what age they would live what choice they would make then he could decree and set such a thing i write their names in my book and when they are born i'll place a deposit inside of them and this way i can do it justly because they would have chosen me anyway now once they get to life as soon as they take that ah that breath of life i place that deposit down inside of them because my foreknowledge declares to me they want to live for me they'll want to serve me they'll want to do right and those others there's no need to put nothing there because they'll never come to me because my foreign tells me they'd never live for me and then that play gives an eternal quality to the elect what what what what made you eternal it was not through the copilation of mother and father it was not through some kind of sexual intercourse that your mom and daddy had it was not that it was not the natural sexual breathing or what gave you equality like that it had to become from an eternal source what was it the mind of god the very thought the very seed word of god that projected down into a body of time but remember keep him just keep him righteous keep him clean when it's all said and done and you bring all your ideas together about predestination election for nation and all that make sure you've got god still being right because if you have one conjecture of any doctrine that changes god's nature you're wrong choices choices we make maybe we'll look at it again but i want to tell you your reward that you receive at that day will be based upon choices that you have made [Music] choices you have made respect that you give to one another phone calls that you make to brothers and sisters when they're down sick discouraged whatever things that you do choices you make you see god don't set you here in pre-programming sets in a pipe just pulls you through on the other side but god has a way here to where you can take his program you are now an heir of the father's business and said here take what will you do with it son what will you do now i'm going to give you a space here in life and i'm going to let you have a lot to do with your reward on the other side what will you do is it choices choices let's pray together choices heavenly father i pray lord you would help us tonight that we can realize what a responsibility that we have as mortals being here in life choices that we have to make all righteous god i pray in the name of jesus you would help each of us that we could make the right choices i must say before these people and be quite honest i've never seen it so clear i knew you had to be just and if they'll remember back when i first came here several years ago one of the first messages i ever preached on on this was predestination by foreknowledge but lord i see it even clearer tonight than it did then father when every one of us stand before you at that day i now realize that the bride will not face the white throne judgment but she will set before the reward throne to be given out but when every mortal walks before you no one will be able to say justly i never had a chance every one of us will stand on the same basis with the same opportunity with the same choice to choose right from wrong heaven or hell good or evil the sorriest man and the sorriest woman or the most righteous saints will stand there on the same basis as far as free moral agency by their own choice god may we realize tonight many of our victories many of our deliverances many of our blessings are as well by our choice you've given us laws to work by you've told us if we give you'd give to us again i don't think that's just limited to money you told us if we'd praise you and worship you you'd bless us back some people wonder why they don't never get blessed and they look around why is someone so blessed so much they come to church and they're so blessed if they would look at the law of god and realize what we put into the service the amount we sow is also going to determine what we reap if we don't put in no worship we don't put in no praise we set her like a bump on a pickle then when the anointing is poured out more than likely that's what we're going to get god help us to realize father that we have choices to make lord as i said earlier we don't have to feel led to worship you we don't have to feel led to sing we don't have to feel led to clap our hands and praise you your word done tells us to do that lord i don't have to feel led to get up and pray tomorrow and say well do i feel led to love my wife today or not lord i'm commanded in the word to love her i i don't have to pray am i going to feel led today to be grouchy or am i going to be kind lord the word tells me what to do help us father to realize lord that the devil has been pulling the wool over much of our eyes lord have been robbing us of many of the blessings that belongs to us and it lays in the law here that you've given to us and we've got to rise as joshua and the people of israel and claim our inheritance not just sit around and wait for it to fall out of heaven and fall in their laps but oh god there are choices that we must make father i pray you would help each one of us lord that we can begin by the grace of god to make the right choices father lord that we wouldn't sit around waiting all of our days waiting for you to do this and waiting for you to do that wait until you're led to do this but oh god we can look in the word and sure we want to make sure it's written in the word that we're supposed to do these things but father after we find it in the word we want to do it with all of our hearts lord god help us to make the right choices i pray lord won't you grant it lord jesus hallelujah where he leads me i lord god where wants to do that by his grace where [Music] [Laughter] lord god [Music] the bride will fall [Music] is [Music] you know how jesus came to the earth and died for your sins free moral agency father not my will but thy will be done watch him as he takes communion with the disciples in a foreshadow he takes it and he bows his head and he prays and gives thanks first corinthians 11. the scripture were used for communion he took the bread and he gave thanks now look what he's doing he was that bread so he's thanking the eternal father which has embodied himself in the son thanking him for the fulfillment of the atonement then he takes the bread and he breaks the bread now what was the bread the bread was him he told them this bread is my body what's he doing displaying free moral agency he takes the bread and he breaks the bread and gives it to the disciples it was not judas that broke the bread it was not the spirit that come down and broke the bread it was not someone else that broke the bread he broke the bread and gave it to the disciples hallelujah hallelujah he could have had a wife right he could physically at the physical anatomy of any ordinary man he could have physically fathered earthly children but he said father i sanctify myself for their sakes he could have been born in a palace or any kind of great royalty but he chose to be born in a manger choices we make choices choices i'll tell you one thing friends this makes me just about fed up to here without lying devil because it makes me realize that he's been pulling some things on me and on you that made us convinced well this is ordained to god and this is ordained to god and this is ordained to god when a lot of it ain't been ordained of god it's been our own choices and satan has pulled it over our eyes well you're suffering for the glory of god you've got a bad headache and
