Family and friends, we've gathered here on the side of God in the face of this company, you witnesses to join together this man and this woman in the holy state of matrimony which is commanded in the scriptures to be entered into in the fear of God reverently and discreetly. There's any person here today who can show a just cause why these two men may not be lawfully joined together. Let them speak now forever hold their peace. Who gives this woman to be married to this man? &gt;&gt; Our mother. Wipe your tears. Take a breath. Lay your head on my chest. [singing] Let me hold you through the night. Yeah. [music] The world can bring us [singing] down. But I still believe somehow it's all going [singing] to be all right. Come what may, [singing] the highs, the lows. Well, this life [singing and music] will be hard, but you and me won't. When the waters rise [singing] and we face the fire, we'll rest in our foundation. [music] Hand in hand on [singing] our knees. Nothing [music] between us. You, me, [singing] and Jesus. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, we'll have a few fights. who's wrong and who's right.

[singing] [music] Oh, and when it's time to say goodbye, we'll rest in [music] our foundation. [singing] Hand in [singing] hand, on our knees, nothing between us. [music] Cuz in the [singing] end, even death could only lead us &gt;&gt; to you, me, and Jesus. [singing] I require and charge you both as you will answer at the day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed. If either of you know of any impediment where you may not belully join together, you do now confess it. If any persons join together otherwise, then God's word doth allow their marriage is not lawful. But believing that you've considered this solemn obligation, I'll present to you the marriage covenant. Judah, will you have this woman to be your lawful witted wife to live together in the holy state of matrimony? You promise to love, cherish, honor, keep her to yourself, forsaking all others as long as you both shall live. McKenzie, will you have this man to be your lawful wedded husband to live together in the holy state of matrimony? Do you promise to love, honor, cherish, obey, support, and sickness or health, riches or poverty? Cleave only unto him so long as you both shall live. &gt;&gt; Repeat these words after me. I, Judah, take you, McKenzie. behind you, taking &gt;&gt; to my wed wife. &gt;&gt; To [snorts] my wed wife, &gt;&gt; to have and to hold. &gt;&gt; To have and to hold. &gt;&gt; From this day forward. &gt;&gt; From this day forward. &gt;&gt; For better, for worse. &gt;&gt; For better, for worse. &gt;&gt; For richer, for poor. &gt;&gt; For richer, for poor. &gt;&gt; In sickness and in health. &gt;&gt; In sickness and in health. &gt;&gt; To love. &gt;&gt; To love. &gt;&gt; To cherish. &gt;&gt; To cherish. &gt;&gt; Till death us depart. &gt;&gt; Till death us depart. &gt;&gt; Repeat these words after me.

If you would, we'll bow our heads now and ask God's blessings on the food. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this occasion. We're so grateful, Lord God, that you are still dealing with men upon the earth to carry out this original institution that you gave to us. We pray, Father, that you would bless Judah and McKenzie. May you be with them. May you help them. May you always be welcome in their home. May you guide them, Lord, and keep them. As we depart from here shortly, we pray that you would bless this food. We're grateful for it. In the name of the Lord Jesus we pray. Amen. Thank you for your attendance. You may be dismissed. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music]
