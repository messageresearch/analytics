we live they hunger was passion for whales for so many different things i'm so glad i hunger for god that way aren't you he's been so good to us why shouldn't we so appreciate you being here today just trust the lord's gonna meet with us a wonderful way let me just share just a brief testimony with you before the andrew comes 18 months ago the doctors did a scan on my heart and they found in my lung a nodule since that time they've been scanning me about every six months whenever i had the episode here at the church in march they took them done all kinds of scans and tests and things like that they found three nodules but i had a scan monday and they found no praise the lord we hear so many negative things and so many sad and difficult things but god is moving in some wonderful ways now they gave me no medication no treatment nothing like that and there was a few folks that i'd made it known to so i just believe our father took care of it just like he took care of his sister becky just like he's taking care of others like he's going to take care of erica darler different needs that are around the world why because he loves his children amen we're going to invite brother andrew to come and speak for us been quite some time since he's been here all this covert thing has messed up everything and at church and our everyday life but actually since brother andrew and sister mariah was here last time they've moved from west virginia up to virginia now they attend brother sean martin's church and working out of that church there and brother sean starting their fine brother it don't seem like it's been that many years ago that brother anderson either here or there one a little bitty old guy come up constantly for prayer you know and uh my has gone into a fine fine warriors across preaching the gospel we so love him and sister mariah and certainly appreciate the lord for them i appreciate the visitors being with us this weekend as well can we just sing as we open our hearts now to the lord i'm sure that you didn't come here today to see or to be seen or you didn't come because necessarily you didn't have any other place to go but you have needs desires in your hearts and we believe our father is so mindful of all of those things and remember brother andrews studied i know him well enough to know that that he studied and he's prepared and put a lot of time into it but a preacher does not bring a meeting on his ipad or in a briefcase but a great deal of that service will be determined by the congregation the prophet tells us if a minister has studied and prayed and he walks out into a congregation that's resentful or they're not in the spirit of god he said the presence of the lord won't move but if you walk out into a congregation that's prayed and they're ready and they understand they have a part to play there's no tent on what the lord will do right here this morning i have needs don't you i have needs i have desires i want to be closer to him than i've ever been before i have friends that are so sick and so many people that i know around the world are so desperate amen let's just open our hearts of the lord jesus come and sing touching jesus hey we'll invite our brother to come and just obey the lord we are so privileged to be able to have him today a woman tried so many physicians [Music] it grew worse so to jesus she came [Music] and when that crowd tried to restrain her she whispered these words through her pain why don't you whisper today touching jesus is all that really matters then your life will never be [Music] [Music] one more time this morning [Music] with all of our hearts oh touching jesus is all that really matters [Music] and then your life never be [Music] there's only one way to touch him just believe when you call his name well do you believe that this morning amen we know the prophet of god taught us that sometimes god uses his gift and sometimes the people use his gift and i believe this morning that he's here to speak to us don't you and i believe he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and what his word said is still true do you believe that today amen let's just borrow our hearts together for a word of prayer this morning and just ask the lord to come as we have felt his presence in the song service this morning and now as we open his word just ask him to come and speak to us heavenly father lord as your believers have gathered themselves together here this morning lord we take it lord not lightly father but we count it such an honor and a privilege lord to be assembled here together and lack precious faith this morning lord knowing that our world is in such turmoil and confusion and chaos lord they don't know which way to turn they don't know who to listen to they don't know what person to follow lord it's in or just a mess but lord out of this mess lord in this chaos you have sent a message in this hour lord and it is a message of direction oh god it is a message of vision it is a clear vision lord and we are thankful for that this morning and lord we are so thankful to be here today lord knowing that you promised were two or three would gather in your name you said that you would come and be in the midst of your children and lord as i look across this building this morning there are more than two or three here lord i believe there is enough here this morning to put every devil and hell to flight lord i believe there is enough believers here this morning that when one lick of fire would begin to come to another lick of fire lord that divine healing would come in the camp lord joy would come in the camp father lord as we take this moment now to open your word i pray o god lord that you would take these thoughts that you've laid up on my heart may you now come lord and lord we've been taught by a prophet that anyone with physical strength can open this book the lord it will take you to come and open it to our hearts and i pray this morning lord that if there would be one here this morning needing joy lord i pray that you would give him that joy if there be one here needing peace lord but you give him that peace that passeth all understanding and father we'll be sure this morning to give you all the honor and all the praise and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen and amen may god rich you bless you this morning you love the lord amen if you have your bibles today we'll invite you to the book of proverbs the 24th chapter and while you're turning there we want to greet you in the name of the lord jesus we surely counted an honor and a privilege to be here with you this morning and i was telling someone the other day after the shutdown and quarantine everything it's a privilege to be anywhere amen but it sure is a privilege to be in the house of god and sure sure appreciate brother donnie and appreciate the church here and sure good to be here have my wife with me and all of our family here this morning we say god bless you and i want to bring ingredients from our pastor brother sean he said to be sure and greet you all and i'm pretty sure i'll step out on a limb and say it i'm pretty sure billy terry would like for me to tell y'all hello as well it's kind of funny about every time we see each other there at church but terry come to me and say now it's hard to believe the little boy that's sitting next to me sitting in church with me again so we we sure love them and i want to bring greetings to you from them as well but here in the book of proverbs the 24th chapter this morning in the third verse i just have a simple thought on my heart this morning pray it'll just be an encouragement to you in the third verse of proverbs 24 the bible here says through wisdom isn't house builded and by understanding it is established through wisdom is in house builded and by understanding it is established also i'd like to look in the book of first corinthians chapter 3 and verse 8 this morning first corinthians 3 and verse 8. the bible here says now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor for we are laborers together with god ye are god's husbandry and i love this paul says ye are god's building according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another build thereon but let every man take heed how he build a therapon for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hey stubble every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try somebody say try the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abide which he hath built up there on he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer lost but he himself shall be saved also now one other place i want to look in the book of second peter the first chapter proverbs there the bible speaking of building and then paul speaking there in first corinthians three a men of building and a master builder and a foundation but if you're going to build a building you've got to have material right and in the book of second peter the first chapter we find the material beginning in the fifth verse peter says and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and the temperance patience and the patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound i love what peter says here they make you you believe that this morning they they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ you believe that this morning we ask the lord to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats this morning from those scriptures i want to by the help of the lord just to speak to you for a few moments here and if i would title this i want to speak to you on thank you brother louie it don't fit so you can't have it this morning amen but from those scriptures this morning i want to speak to you on the map the material that god built his church out of the material that god built his church out of and i was listening to the infallible word of god brotherhood says what kind of material are you built out of methodist baptist catholic presbyterian lutheran pentecostal nazarene pilgrim holiness he said if you're not built out of bible material then the boards drove on by the holy ghost you better tear off the boards he says and get built right so there's there's a right kind of building and then there is a wrong kind of building there is a there is a bible building and then there is an unbible building and another place he said i think every christian ought to take the same attitude that's right we want to know where we are standing amen because we don't want our eternal destination built upon the shifting sands of some church theology amen but on the eternal word of the living god see right because remember every one of you sitting here tonight amen or i could say sitting here this morning amen he says are going to face stormy times stormy times is going to hit that building you're sitting in that's right death is going to strike it and you better know what kind of a sand it's built upon or what kind of a foundation that it has now amen i believe this morning that we are not gathered here as just church members i don't believe we're gathered here amen it's just people that want to be identified with some type of religion or just here as a people that wants to be a part of some church but i believe amen that the reason we're here this morning is because god has ordained us to be here amen and before the foundation of the world god placed a predestinated seed in our hearts to be here this morning now i'll tell you this way amen that the people that are sitting next to you this morning they're not common people amen they're amen you're not normal people you're not just average people this morning sometimes while praying and studying i'll read through the bible and read about paul and peter and matthew and mark and luke and john and all through the bible of how amen they went through things they went through trials and they went through tests and they went through disappointments and they went through losses they went through all kinds of things and then something in my mind they'll say my it would be something to meet those people and to talk to those people and see amen what they went through and how they went through it and can they come out of it amen but then it strikes my heart that actually every time i preach to the bride of jesus christ amen i'm preaching the same caliber people amen amen your mate your name might not be mark or luke or matthew or john amen but you've been through some things you've been through some trials amen you've been through some tests you've been through some great losses amen but then it dawns on me that the only reason why we're still here amen as opposed to other people that went through the same thing it's because we're not built out of what they're built out of amen amen we're not made out of what they're made out of listen amen you've been through things that a baptist church would fall apart at you've been through things ain't been that a pentecostal church would run at but the reason why that you're still sitting here this morning is because you're more than just a church amen but you are a paradox you you are a people this morning amen that have been through some things but what you've been through amen was not greater than the god that was on the inside of you amen because there was a scripture concerning you that said greater is he that is in you amen than he that is in the world there was a scripture concerning you amen that if god be for us amen then who can be against us there was a scripture concerning you amen that all things work together amen for the good to them that love the lord let me just go and make an announcement to the devil this morning amen this is not just a church amen this is not just a gathering of people amen but this is the pride of jesus christ amen that has been through wars but the wars can defeat him amen been through battles but the battles couldn't defeat him and when i begin to think about all the things that the church of the living god has been through and then you wonder why we're praising god amen because we know if it hadn't been for the lord that was on our side amen we wouldn't be standing this morning if it hadn't been for god who was rich in mercy that looked beyond all of our failures look beyond all their faults amen and put a robe of righteousness upon us to be able to stand listen church we've not been called to bow we have been called to stand amen and i would be lying to you this morning to tell you it's going to get easier i'd be lying to you to tell you that trials are going to get less amen but i got courage this morning to tell you amen that just as god was with you then he is with you this morning and there is no test amen there is no war there is no fight there is no battle there is nothing that the devil can tow against this church that'll knock her down hey i feel like preaching this morning i think there's a people here this morning that says go ahead and throw it devil and we'll pick up a bat and knock it out of the park we are not made out of stuff amen that falls apart at the first trial we are not a hybrid church this morning we are a spoken word church by the message of the hour we are a people of paradox this morning we are a mystery to the world amen but we are the church amen that god is built amen amen we are a people of paradox we are a people amen that is more than just people that are guessing amen but we are a church of authority amen we are a people of authority this is a message of authority amen you've got a pastor of authority amen there's a faithful ministry of authority now do you see why the devil hates you amen because we're not here presuming this morning but we've actually got supreme authority by the word amen if you listen the message presuming what is going to tell you to presume actually means to venture without actual authority amen now you find the world is in a presuming state amendment said the church world amen paraphrase in the whole world has moved under presuming amen politics are presuming religion is presuming government is presuming science is presuming education everything around us is presuming but this is not the hour amen to be presuming for a prophet would say we're not presuming anything we see it we know that god is here and the holy spirit the great god of elijah the holy ghost the witness of the last day is pulling his ministry amen right into the church amen the same thing that our lord did the high priest is descending from the throne to the church amen the high priest is descending from the throne into the church and the church is heaping itself up with the word because he can only come to the word and he is the word the word cannot come to an almanac it will not fit so the word has to come to the word amen now do you see why amen that cancers are leaving bodies now do you see why that nodules amen are leaving lungs now do you see why amen that sickness is losing its hold on the church of the living god because the high priest is descending from his throne into the church in this age let me say this morning we ought to make him welcome amen we ought to make it welcome this morning the same high priest that blind bartimaeus touched amen the same high priest that the woman with issue of blood is in this building this morning and you can touch the hymn of this karma and in the moment in the tweaking of an eye everything that's wrong can be made right when the high priest comes in the church that's why we're still here this morning because the high priest is here that's why we don't fear doctors reports because the high priest is still here that's why we don't fear what man can do to us because the mighty conqueror is still in the church of the living god in these last days yes sir the god of abraham isaac and jacob is here therefore when we receive these trials when we receive these situations we don't have to presume we're going to be okay we don't have to presume we're going to overcome we don't have to presume that we're going to get victory we have supreme scriptural authority to stand up and say i'm not going to get the victory but i've already got the victory [Music] [Applause] victory is not coming amen victory is here see you say then what are you talking about i'm talking about a church amen that god called amen not a church that man made but a church that god called and when god calls something he equips what he calls if god calls a man to preach he'll give him something to say if he calls somebody to sing he'll give them something to sing about if he calls somebody to teach he'll give them something to teach about see amen then if god calls him he doesn't expect him to go to a seminary amen and find some material amen to fulfill the call upon his life amen but he's actually born with the material in him that when the quickening power of the holy ghost overshadows what is laying inside of him it'll cause a resurrection in that man and he'll stand there in the face of every unbelieving giant he'll stand there in the face of every philistine he'll stand there in the face of every skeptic and critic and say though you slay me amen yet i'll trust him amen though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh i'll see god i'm talking about the church that god built i'm not talking about something was hatched out of bob jones university i'm talking about something that left the genes of god as an eternal word as an eternal substance my to think this morning when god calls a man to do anything he completely equips him with everything he has need of god always completely equips his man god always somebody shout completely he completely equips his man then in genesis chapter 6 you'll hear of a man named noah amen god actually called noah amen and he called him to do something he called him to build an ark now if you study brethren says god actually give noah amen the word or the order the form and the use of the ark in genesis chapter 6 13 and god said in the noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth notice here in verse 14 make thee an ark amen make me an ark of gopher wood amen room shalt thou make in the ark and shall pitch it within without the pitch and this is the fashion which thou shall make it of the length of the ark shall be 300 cubits the breadth of it fifty cubits and the half of it thirty cubits amen a window shout they'll make to the ark and in a cubit shout they'll finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third story shall they make it and behold i and i speaking of himself here behold i god even i do bring a flood of waters upon the earth and destroy somebody say destroy destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven and everything that is in the earth shall die but with thee amen i ain't got time to preach here all day but with thee amen well i'll establish my covenant and thou shalt come into the ark amen thou shalt come into the ark and then thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy son's wife with thee and of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shall thou bring in the ark to keep them alive from with thee they shall be male and female of fouls after their kind of cattle after their kind of creeping thing of the earth after its kind two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive and take thou unto thee all of the flood that is eat the food that is eaten and shall gather it to thee and shall be for food thee and for them notice here in verse 22 of genesis 6 thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did he amen i want you to catch something here noah's works expressed to man what his faith was in god's promise see god met noah and said no it's going to rain i'm going to destroy the whole earth with water now it never had rain that's the impossibility but said prepare an ark amen of the dimensions that i tell you about and him being a carpenter amen him being i studied the day and i caught this him being a carpenter any carpenters here know that when you get a set of plans the first thing you do is you look at them and then when you look at him you say well maybe we could change this or do this so different amen but notice here noah didn't question nothing he didn't say well god maybe we shouldn't make it so big maybe we should put three stories in it maybe maybe we should just leave this out but god gave noah the instructions amen and noah took those instructions and he went to work and fixed it up there with the of wood and put the pitch in at my i love this put the pitch in it and then he began to put the pitch in it he began to put the foot of dies amen put everything there and the prophet said they come by and said this man is actually crazy because he says it's going to bring waters out of heaven and there's no water up there but you see noah didn't think about that because his works was expressing to the people what his faith was and what god had said that's the reason the genuine christian amen separates himself from everything but the word of god no matter what the people think what anybody else says he isn't just saying that if he is it won't be too long till his works will be made known see had noah changed one thing on the ark amen the flood would have revealed amen what he changed on the ark because that ark wouldn't have been swimming it would have been sinking amen but because noah amen was a god-called man who received a god supernatural commission he went to work and the prophet said see we didn't know this amen but there were other boats in those days we didn't know until a prophet came along that there was other boats there was amen there was a baptist boat there was a pentecostal that was a presbyterian but amen let's bring it around us there was a return ministry boat that was the seven thunderbolt there was a peru there was all kinds of boats amen but there was only one boat amen that god had made a covenant with a man to build it and that man's name was noah and that boat was called the ark and the prophet said when noah went to building on this he was building a boat that would stem the great tides he said see they looked at noah and said noah our boat will float as much as your boat he said oh he said i belong to this church and i joined over here and it's as good as yours he said remember when the floods came amen only the god constructed boat floated when the floods came only the god constructed boat floated amen every other boat sunk to the bottom amen but noah's boat amen went riding across the waves amen why because it was god inspired it was god instructed are y'all hearing me this morning amen let me just ask you happy valley why is this church still standing amen why is this ministry still standing because it's not a man-built church it's not a man-built ministry it's not a man-built mood it's the inspiration of the almighty god that has been released in this generation amen to raise up a church that'll stand when she's surrounded by every devil in hell with every gun pointed at her and she can't find a close place to go and hide from the weapons but she is built by stuff that if you shoot her it won't kill her if you cut her it won't stop her if you hit her it won't defeat her come on church i'm not talking about an invincible army coming i'm saying this morning there is an invincible army here oh brother andrew i'm looking for the invincible army look no further you're looking at it this morning i'm looking for the invincible church look no further behold her this morning i'm looking for the invincible youth group look no further you found it this morning what are you talking about brother andrew i'm talking about the church amen that god has designed and he's raised up a ministry ain't meant to build that church he said see unless that boat is constructed by god it will not stand it's got to be holy ghost material it's got to be holy ghost material and holy ghost material amen makes holy ghost people see a cypress boat material makes a cypress boat a poplar makes a poplar boat see what i mean and a whirly material makes a whirly church amen but a holy ghost material but a holy ghost material makes a holy ghost church amen see this morning we're not a worthy church amen we are not a cypress church we we are not a popular church this morning we are a holy ghost church which has received holy ghost material from the word to build my amen now this is what i love amen his nose construction was according to his instruction see in the face of everything that was against noah he still kept building according to what god had revealed the prophet said he knowed that his construction had been according to his instruction and i wonder if our construction will compare with the instructions we have been given can you imagine how many days noah was out there working and they would come by and see him up there hammering away on that ark and they would laugh at him they would come by and see no out there pitching that thing back and forth with tar and they would make fun of him but it never discouraged him amen it never stopped him amen they never had enough power over him amen to get his eyes off of what god had called him and commissioned him to do now brethren says it this way he said see paraphrase it can you imagine when noah's family amen god in the ark amen now it might have been a bunch of a bunch of laughter in a bunch of hard times but when they got in the ark i guarantee you noah's message amen was more valuable to them then than it was the first day they heard it because they raised the window in the ark when the floods began to fall and they begin to see their friend's boat seeking they begin to see this boat seeking they begin to see that boat seeking and the prophet of god said but they begin to feel the ark arise he said it this way amen she began to rise till she left the ground amen are y'all hearing me this morning that's that's shout material right there amen that's preaching material she left the ground when they opened the windows everything around them was seeking amen but they were rising amen why were they rising because they were not built out of denomination they were not peeled out of creeds they were not built out of stuff that would blow apart but they were built out of the very breath of god himself and i say this morning church let him laugh at this church let him ridicule you brother donny let him blast your name all over the world but one of these mornings hey one of these mornings we're going to open up and we're going to see this seeking and that seeking but we're going to begin to feel amen a charge of the holy ghost coming in our body it'll be the same charge that enoch felt it'll be the same fire that caught elijah up and it'll lift us off the ground and in the moment in the twinkling of an eye there won't be hiding their hair you may think i lost my mind this morning but just go ahead and join me i'm going to leave here one of these days [Applause] [Music] let them laugh at us let them make fun of us but god built us and in the face of every skeptic we'll stem ever tide we'll crest every wave ah the other sink the other saint man you imagine what a you imagine why the heaviness was on noah's heart when he looked out there and saw them boat seeking when he had done everything in his power to tell him build it the way god said and they began to sink he said satan tried him he tried to discourage him he tried to discourage him to the people of that day through the religions of that day through the science of that day but noah delivered somebody shot delivered noah delivered what he received and what he received delivered those who received what god delivered to him that's pretty good right there i thought that up myself amen amen noah delivered what he received and what he received delivered those are y'all hear me this morning amen then what you're hearing coming through your pastor and through brother daryl and these other preachers amen they're not getting this from a seminary they didn't get this material amen from liberty university they didn't get this material amen from oral roberts studio they got this material on the backside of the desert when the pillar of fire amen that meant moses and met paul met william branham and returned in this day to meet a thoughtful ministry and commissioned them preach my word until my church begins to go from faith and to virtue and to knowledge under temperance until the very headstone that the builder is rejected amen returns and it'll be the triumphal entry of the capstone it'll be the capping of the building that god built no i'm not a crazy man i just got some victory ain't been a few days since i've seen y'all so let me just let you in on this little secret right here okay he said but andrew has lost his mind he's up there running around waving a wide handkerchief well actually what happened is i was listening to a tape and the prophet of god said right now the angels of god are in this building he said and they're flying white flags of victory he said all through this building they're flying white flags of victory he said the devil is waving black flags of defeat he said but i see the angels and they're waving white flags of victory brother donnie something come over my heart if the angels amen can wave the white flags of victory and they're not experiencing amen the victory that they're waving about then what about the church by the living god this morning that is not talking about the victory but she is the victory she's not talking about the power but she is the power she's not talking about salvation she is salvation don't you think it's time amen to ring the liberty bell don't you think it's time amen to let the devil know happy valley still got to victory we still got to victory devil you thought you got us but we're still here you thought you'd set us up [Applause] but we're still here i'm talking about a victorious church i'm talking about a victorious people that right in the middle of everything the devil's done to destroy they can still wave the pike [Applause] ah berliner you're just you're just all worked up no you're just jealous you ain't got the liberty i've got [Music] but you can have it this morning hello you can have it this morning hey brother andrew that old devil's done everything to me won't you just stand up and give him a wave this morning devil i'm still here i'm still here you thought you got me with my family but i'm still here you thought you was gonna shut me down but i'm still here you thought she's going to set this man up amen from preaching the message but let me wave the flag and say donny reagan's still here happy valley is still here this bride is still here this message is still here when we go in church we're going to leave here one of these mornings because god has come down in this generation and has built a church that'll stand the pressure she'll stand the persecution she'll stand the trials she'll stand the doctor's reports and right in the middle of it she'll just let go and give god a good old fashion acts 2 4 holy ghost praise in the middle of every devil i'm not a crazy man this morning i'm a believer here this morning there's some believers here today there's some believers here today young man you're a believer this morning amen young lady you're a believer this morning preacher you're a believer god put you here put you here in this age because he sent a message and that message delivered all that god given to that messenger and we received it amen we just we received it somebody shot we received it we didn't question it we received it we didn't argue with it we just said brother branham that ain't nothing but the truth amen can i just preach to you this morning one one of the one of the saddest days of my ministry by larry was when i realized there was people around this message that you could read and what brother brahman said and they'd still argue with it well it got quite there but it's the truth anyhow amen you could tell him a prophet said it and they'd say well let me tell you what he meant and let me let me let me put a little twist on that so you'll understand because you're just a young whippersnapper you don't know very much you're exactly right amen but if our young girls amen and our young people and our church members have got to guts to live this message don't you think it's time some people get the guts to believe what a prophet said well it ain't popular brother freddie i didn't come to talk about popularity that's when the three things will take a preacher down it'll take a church town but when there is a bride standing there that knows who she is she can read what a prophet said and say the same thing mary said be it unto me lord if he said it i believe it i receive it and that settles it oh you gotta you gotta receive it when when paul said there in first corinthians 15 i delivered unto you that which i received the word delivered means amen to verbally instruct another to deliver something verbally now surely received means to pick up the book and get the tape and put the pictures on the wall and get the briefcase and get everything like brother is that what it means no a prophet says it this way or rather the bible says it means not to withhold obedience [Applause] not to withhold obedience amen you can say you receive this message but if you're still disobeying it you didn't receive it because to receive it means you give yourself to it you release your ideas about it you throw aside your traditional views you let the holy ghost tear down amen that traditional veil until what a prophet said become so sure to you that you'll build your home opponent you'll build your marriage opponents you'll build your family opponents you'll even build a church opponent because you know it's going to stand the test of time ah the hallelujah the bible of god said in the church age book he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches see it may be that millions will hear these words or read them but how many will pay heed to them that we do not know but he who will lend his ear he who will lend his ear see when you lend something somebody doesn't beg you for it you willfully lend it you willfully give yourself to it amen and i thank god this morning that we've got a faithful ministry that has willfully lent their ear to these tapes they have willfully lent their ear amen to what a prophet said and they're not mixing it with what a man thinks but they're delivering to the church what the prophet said would deliver that church and by that manifestation of the spirit of god this is not a church that is in darkness this morning but it is a church that the spirit of god has enlightened us by the message of the hour amen y'all hear me this morning anybody here still thank god for the message amen you thank god for the prophet that's the only reason why there's a lot in this building this morning that's the only reason why there's enough power in this church that if a sick person come the altar we can lay our hands upon them it's because somebody amen has received the supernatural message of the hour amen to deliver it to a supernatural people and by that supernatural commission it'll bring a supernatural deliverance right here in this church this morning see in order to accomplish a project hey i can't even teach for preaching this morning i've got a whole foundation laying even later yet in order to accomplish a product a project amen there has to be a master there has to be one raise up in charge there has to be one stand up amen do you realize the ark would have never gotten built had no one left the instructions opened for opinions it would have never got built had noah said now what do you think about this and brother what do you think about this brother now man what do you thinks would change it would have never got built amen he would well let's just preach here this morning that has still been going around the mountain amen waiting on waiting on something to come amen but when they realized this is more than a man when they realize this is more than just a preacher amen but this is a man that god met and this is not a two-headed job this is a hand the prophet said anything that has two hedges deformed he said god never had two heads in his church he never had two heads in his church he said he's always had one amen and he said that one will be the final absolute see then what that tells me is is christ will become the final absolute of the church in the last days amen christ will raise up and be the master builder amen christ will raise up and be the vision to the church amen christ will raise up and be the voice that we all follow come on church i'm not talking about some man somewhere because of the personality's god he thinks we ought to lend our ear to what he's got to say i'm talking about a people amen that knows if anything's got two heads it ain't never going to get done but if one man raises up and says this is the direction we're going and everybody catches the vision see then that vision will become christ and christ is the vision and the bible is christ he said that he will be the principal theme amen he should be the principal theme he should be the principal theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our walks amen he should be the principal theme of our life then he should be the principal theme of everything we do and everything we say should be centered around the master which is christ amen can i preach this morning amen the master which is christ see then let me say it this way only what's done by christ amen will last amen and what's done for christ will last see if you do it apart from christ then you might as well close the doors you might as well turn off the lights you might as well padlock the doors because if christ is not in it it's a meaningless gathering of people with a bunch of ideas and a bunch of fussing and a bunch of cotton and a bunch of this and a bunch of that but if christ comes in our midst oh i tell you this morning church i say come on in christ come on in happy valley come on the pulpits come across the platform come on church if christ comes in here it'll be more than just gathering three times a week if christ comes in here this message will be more than something you was just raised in but it will become the very the very the very pulsation of why you're living will be the reason of the message now i'm just going to buckle down here and preach for a second amen because i've come to place that if christ ain't in it i don't want no part of it i don't care if it is even around this message if christ is not in it andrew glover don't want no part of it because it's only a matter of time before enough pressure comes down upon it that it blows apart and this man reveals who he is and this system reveals what was the motive and objective amen but if christ is in it then we will fulfill the words of the psalmist david when he stood and said except the lord built the house amen they that labor and pain build it except the lord keep the city they that watcheth and wakeeth are in vain amen but can i announce to you happy valley amen 30 years of this ministry amen 30 years of this church all that's been done has been done around christ are y'all hearing me is this okay has been done around christ you say what are you talking about i'm talking about a pastor with a vision of the message i'm talking about church with the this and the message i'm talking about somebody that had one thing in mind that was go find the stones that god fully ordained to be a part of this stature and let's build it up let's forget our ideas let's forget our agendas rather matthew let's forget what we think and remember what a prophet taught in this generation oh you said andrew what are you talking about i'm talking about christ has returned in this age christ is the master of the building now do you realize the bible says there in corinthians that paul was a master builder amen which he's saying here paul was a master builder the reason he was is because christ was in him see this morning amen if you've got a murderer right if you've got a man that's a murderer he's a murderer but if he gets the spirit of john dillinger john dillinger was the master murderer so then he gets that spirit that spirit comes in him he becomes a master murderer because the spirit of the master came in is that okay all right now let's preach here for a second amen if you've got a piano player he's another piano player until the spirit of beethoven which was the master pianist come off of beethoven into him then he becomes a master pianoist see then whatever the spirit of the master comes into it automatically makes that the master over whatever you're talking about see then if paul was a builder because he didn't receive the spirit of gamalia he didn't receive the spirit of the sadducees but he stayed there until he received amen the spirit of christ then when the spirit of christ come in him then paul could say i am a master builder all that let's bring it here this morning church amen paul was not talking about a building he was talking about a surrendered vessel that christ could claim see it was christ building through paul oh church amen can i take some liberty here do you see why you're still here this morning it's not because just to ban brother donnie it's because a man surrendered his vessel to christ and christ came down and claimed that vessel and it's been christ from this pulpit amen year in and year out trial in and trial has been behind this pulpit building the church of the last days not out of worldly material but out of holy ghost material see is christ the master builder returning amen what is a master builder he is an architect he is the superintendent he is the the one that erects a building he is the creator of that building see paul was not talking about a physical building can i preach he was talking about a people see the church was not a building the church was a body of people who truly believed in jesus christ the master builder and god gave paul amen the grace the strength and the power and the ability to reach people for jesus christ and to assemble them together into a body to do one thing that is not worship him or worship what he's doing but worship god that is giving the grace and the strength and the power and the ability to accomplish what is being accomplished are you hearing me this morning see that where they met did not matter oh i got to be careful here because i could catch a second wind and preach all day where they met didn't matter they could meet in a hut and they would have church they could meet in a field and they would have church they could meet in a backyard and they would have church they could meet in a public building or a church building because the building was not the church the church was the building in the building [Applause] we few few months ago when all this shutdown took place our building there at home with with all the people there at the church it was we couldn't we couldn't socially distance in there so we we started out with going over and getting the brother in the church brother chris morris he's got a nice big ol big old field out there and we pulled a trailer up there amen brother brother brother sean all them got out there and they put the music up amen we had drive-in services amen but you know what we had church we had church brother sean said you know what if you want to say amen just honk your horn sean told me one day simply andrew said i've had so many amens in all my life hey man it's amazing what a person will do when they get behind the horn they mean l.a man like they never amen before heard one preacher say they'll sit out there and haunt for an hour and come in church and sleep for an hour well let's preach anyhow we're here we might as well amen but we had church amen it don't matter we're listen i'm talking about a people and if you get them in the middle of lowe's brother jack and they get with another believer and they just begin to reminisce about how good god's been to him and what he's done for him and what he's brought them through brother david they'll begin to say it's my desire amen to serve the lord after all i've been through i still got joy brother i'll tell you what they'll clear the plumbing all out in lowe's because the holy ghost will come wherever he's invited and he'll move wherever he's welcome and i say this morning church let's remember who got us where we are this morning let's remember who got us through that dark night let's remember who got us through that trying time let's remember who god is through that broken heart let's remember who god is through that disappointment that same god brother jim that god is from there to here today is the same god that's gonna take us from here into the future home into the millennium come on church i'm telling you you've not been built by a man you've been built by god the church is not exactly a church building it's a it's a church it's where the people have gathered see the church is not an organization now let me see it this way through seven successive church ages amen god has been building a people remember i said now we already have the stones he said all the way from emphasis to layout to see you we're only waiting for that headstone that the builders rejected 60 i believe this is 60 62. he said for the builders rejected waiting for his coming the captain's tone then he comes the first seal and says the true bride will be made up of a thousand times thousands see of the people but it will be the elect out of every age see there must come a true seed he's coming forward a word vindicated right this bride is going to be made up of all down through that had the word in their age it's not just the last group he said god is going to take the whole thing out of here then let me sit this way amen if this 500 here this morning made you a little uncomfortable when they got to shouting i pray for you when you get there on that day let's preach a while amen if if this few people here this morning when the holy ghost come through and begin to stir something in them caused them to rise up and praise him and it sent cold chills over your body you better get something before you get there amen because you'll freeze to death because when we get there it ain't just going to be me and brother michael and brother john and brother donny brother brad and all these brothers talking there's going to be thousands times thousands come on church y'all never go to a good old-fashioned message holy ghost meeting a good old-fashioned message holy ghost speed and you get a couple preachers together and they get to preaching the message and the holy ghost gets to follow them one of them gets to shouting and running and dancing and having a good time well brother andrew i just don't think that's very nice implied will you just wait till we all get over there and it ain't just me and brother donnie in the building but it's me and brother don and brother tim and brother biscuit amen brother branham and brother ron come on church amen all the men of god now the ancients all get together you all think we're gonna sit there like a bump on a pickle when we get there that day and ron spencer stands up and begins to tell about everything he's been through how he went through fires how he went through strokes how he went through burns and he come through cancer and he still got a testimony come on church brother donny when we get there and paul begins to hear about all that you've been through and he said how did you make it you'll say because i was working for the same builder you work for sister erica when we get over there and all the bright members this battle cancer begins to stand and say cancer couldn't stop me amen cancer couldn't take me i left that world in a rapture i'm talking about a holy ghost i'm talking about a hallelujah meeting well i don't think we got to wait amen can we get there but i think right here this morning we can go ahead and start warming up you say with andrew we're not there yet amen but brother harry god sent a prophet in this generation and said if you're here that's because he was back there and if he was back there you'll be here and if you're here i saw you there come on church that's enough to shout your shoe heels off a prophet has already saw you there he's already seen you with no cancers in your body with no scars in your heart [Applause] got victory church we're gonna be there or y'all hear me we're gonna be there y'all got masks on this morning look at somebody next to you and say we to be there we oh some of y'all's still looking at me they ain't going to hurt you we going to be there we're going to be there brother we're going to be there and we're going to talk about how god brought you through sister becky i don't know where he at but we're going to be there and we're going to talk about how god brought her through brother louie we're going to be there and you know what you won't be walking like you're walking now you'll be shouting amen down the streets and go i've not run out of stuff to say i just come to remind you church he built you he ordained you he might be tealing you that would not be defeated it will not be discouraged it will not be overcome [Applause] we're going to be there church ah brother andrew i don't know if i'm going to make it you're going to make it yeah you're going to make it because john said being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks in the midst of the candlesticks was one like in the son of man then he comes down and says the seven stars are the angels from seven churches see those seven stars were master builders each age messenger was building by christ in the star messenger of that age oh i ain't got time to slow down here but let me just say it this way all those messengers stem the tide everything they went through they weren't swimming downstream they were swimming upstream everybody else was falling for the doctrine of the nicolaitans everybody else was worshiping that little harlot jezebel amen everybody else was by the rock amend the name of jesus christ they were losing their grace they were losing their power to stand against that wicked catholicism system but there were some men [Applause] there were some men let me go a step further and say there was some elected men with an elected message that caught an elected seed and it wasn't just the messenger swimming upstream it was the entire elected group swimming upstream because that messenger was going to cap that age off with a reward but the only way he was going to get from the beginning of the age to the reward was to follow the master builder ah i'm preaching this morning church and let me just go and make the devil mad and say if paul was a master builder if columba was a master builder if wesley was a master builder if luther was a master builder then there's a young man here this morning that's got enough guts to say william marion branham was a master builder as well it may not be popular it may not be fancy but let me just clean tell the devil there are some men in this land today that the only way they'll quit preaching this message is you have to put a bullet in them and kill them because it's the reason they're living you'll never cap them off you'll never set them up it's the position of faith that is calling out a bride church unto the angel amen other church a lot of sins right amen can i read that like a message believer and unto the angel william mary and branham [Applause] write these things oh let me just go ahead and put the devil let me put another nail in the devil's coffin we're not building an organization i'm not here building an organization christ never sent me to build that christ sent me to build individuals to the statue of jesus christ that they might be the powerhouse [Applause] oh don't you see why the devil hates this church it's because he hadn't been able to cut the power off yet [Music] he's tried sister janet but every time there was 150 votes ran in right when he got ready to cut your power off and the holy ghost electrocuted him and knocked him back while the manifested sons of god begin to raise up holy hands begin to lift up their voices because you can't cut the power off when it's an eternal power you can't cut the power off when it's not coming from a man when it's not coming from a system oh come on church let me just preach this morning god told me one time said you keep on preaching like that you'll never preach for me again i said thank you brother but i'll go stand on a rock and preach this message before i compromise and let the power of our holy ghost be cut off and we don't just need preachers with that determination we need church members that'll say devil you ain't cutting my power off not gonna cut it off i'll worship in the time of trouble i'll dance in the rain i'll shout when they're laughing at me i'll preach when they're ridiculing me it's an eternal power church it's coming from the holy ghost [Applause] oh build up the individual that place see every building has to have a foundation let me say it this way there are two foundations there is a foundation which is a rock then there is a foundation which is sand let me just preach to you for a second isaiah 28 16 therefore thus saith the lord god god i just asked you a question y'all are killing me but i'm loving every minute of it brother donnie the way i'm feeling right now i'm about to ask you where you want another door in this church have you ever stopped to wonder out of everything you've been through why are you still here [Music] i know i've been preaching all that this morning but let me just drive this home have you ever just sit and wondered why people you used to go to church with now call what they used to shout at false you ever wondered why you ever wonder why people that you were friends with come on young people we've all been there we ran the aisles at camp with people that ain't even serving god today but but do you wonder young people why are you still here do you ever just wonder young man do you ever just wonder why i'm still hearing this can i tell you why because isaiah prophesied of you he said behold i lay in zion what is zion the bride behold i lay in zion for a foundation stone a tried stone a precious cornerstone are you ready a sure foundation that he that believeth shall not make haste then when the world is building up on popularity building up on education building up on schools building up on political powers when both parties are corrupt [Applause] building up on all these things lay on the sea is building up on something that's miserable miserable brother and right miserable and i'm in laodicea let me tell you what the prophet said they vault of what they have but what they have will not stand the test of time they have built up on quicksand rather than the rock of revelation of god's word see pity them for soon cometh the earthquake and they'll be gone soon cometh the announcement peace at last and then send destruction and they'll be gone but when you build a building you've got to put it on the foundation stone i'm getting to answer that question for you i didn't forget it you build a building and paul says for other foundation can no man lay them that is laid which is jesus christ then he comes along in ephesians 2 and says are built upon the foundation of the apostles of the prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone brother brad i love what timothy says he says laying it up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come [Applause] a sure foundation against the time to come that they lay hold on eternal life the foundation of god timothy says standing sure all right then a prophet comes along and says then a new creation not to the nomination but to the word because he because the foundation stone was laid in you [Music] [Applause] before the foundation of the world then brother harry today i can read isaiah and say behold i lay inside amen a precious stone a cornerstone a tried stone a sure foundation stone and then brad i can step back and behold who is sitting before me and hear a prophet say there was a stone laid in you before the foundation of the world and i can stand and say this day this day this scripture is fulfilled behold i love god i'm about to come and glue behold i lay in time come on church before you was even born he laid that stone in you he saw everything you would go through that you brother jeremy god bless you heard tell people i don't want to call you the wrong name he laid in you a dried stone he laid in you a foundation stone that against the time to come that he was not nervous i'm coming to a close when he saw you on your journey and you would come up against something he didn't see you stop and back up and question what you believe and question what you've been hearing but he's seen you mount up with wings he saw you brother joel square your shoulders back and say i was born for this i was ordained for this i will not bow to this i will not give in to this as a matter of fact i'll walk right through it [Applause] i'll walk right through it whatever we come up against brother donny we're just going to keep on walking just going to keep on walking when we hit a door we'll walk through it when we hit a wall we'll walk through it when we meet a goliath on the field we'll walk through him and one of these days if we keep on walking our next step will be like enoch ah what are you talking about andrew i'm talking about i'm not talking about perishable material no i'm i'm going to close this year because i can't preach all day but i sure feel like it i i'm not talking about perishable material i'm talking about permanent i'm talking about permanent mature i'm talking about god building seven church ages a bride for christ i'm talking about a prophet that said we know there's going to be a bride and there's going to be a wedding supper and we know they have the material on the earth that's going to make them ready they'll be there natural carpenter comes to you what he'll do he'll tell you how to build your natural house right spiritual carpenter tells you how to build your spiritual house and the prophet said i'm going to tell you how to make you like himself now there are two bodies i'm going to tie this up here there are two bodies there's the human body then there's the spiritual body you realize that human body spiritual body you realize the human body is made up of 16 elements calcium petroleum podx cosmic light etc the spiritual body is made up of three elements water blood spirit see is what makes his body now do you realize the human body can only handle so much before it begins to break down because it's perishable it's made out of perishable material you say that i don't believe that because i'm in the message and i'm well let me just preach to you for a second because job was smoked with sore bulls from the soul of his put into his crown you realize job's body began to break down his mind his nerves but it says when god had counted you worthy when you have a test now don't fail to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of god has found you favor with god god had confidence in job he put him to the test he put his trust in him and he would say though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god see job was a part of the spiritual body and let me just go and close by saying this the spiritual body which is the bride can handle whatever is thrown at it and it will not break down [Applause] because it's god inspired it's gone and constructed and it's built by god's instructions see this bride is not handmade she is spoken word created oh this what are you talking about this is the formation of the bride remember said you're made up of the miracle working god i'm talking to you now amen your material is perfect faith a substance faith see do all who go in the bride have to live within 500 miles of the tabernacle i always thought the bride would come out of all parts of the world at the time of the rapture am i wrong no my dear friend you're not but when the trumpet of god shall sound wherever they are no matter where they are see if they're in the jungles of africa when they buried those martyrs the devil said we're done with them they perished but no he said see you're made up of a substance that's an unseen made material and god will give that substance back then when you roll a loved one or you roll a church member out of this church in a casket and you lay him in the graveyard and the devil says i finally got rid of them no you didn't amen they were made of an unseen substance and the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with a voice and with a trumpet come on church i'm talking about people that were that were that were that were done away with through the waste of animals i'm talking about people that was burned in the fire but because they were made out of stuff that don't bluff because they remain out of god material they'll raise up again [Applause] brother andrew what are you talking about i'm talking about god once a time tested church he's got a churches tested went to the trials through the losses through sicknesses through sorrow through death and still stand with a testimony that's the man he's looking for i don't care if you're a pumper i don't care if you're a beggar i don't care if you're a rag picker i've yet to figure out what that is oh my god tell me whatever you are god put the test to you he's looking for a time tested material can i tell you what he said now i feel religious let me tell you brother ram knocks on the pulpit it says that time tested church will come into existence someday knocked on the pulpit once more and then clapped his hand see he even got happy they may be half of them sleeping in the dust of the earth i don't know where they're at but god has got his material all tested and one day he is coming to take the forefront and say follow me right through atmospheres stratospheres spheres and spheres into the presence of almighty god he will go with a time-tested church [Applause] that's a memorial to his grace that's the memorial that god gives him well can i just speak over the bannisterelle of heaven this morning and say brother branham if you're looking over behold she is in existence behold what you prophesied is here this morning behold i really inside amen a sure foundation star brother jerry she is here this morning oh my god i'm done this morning i gotta quit this is not a perishable church this is a permanent church this bride will never pass away because she is the word just as there were boats in the days of noah there have been churches churches churches there has been brides brides brides and they'll everyone seek but a prophet said there has got to come one that's got not only the mechanics but also the dynamics and may i take the liberty to announce to you brother she is not coming amen brother tim she is here this morning she is here behold her look around church the same material that spoke the world into existence is sitting next to you this morning in god form in a body as our musicians come [Applause] testing time will come but only the god-constructed church will stand you know what you got to have got to have the pressure test he said brandon what do you talk about pressure test if something's set up for 65 psi and you put 66 now i may like make myself look plum ignored here this morning but that's okay i've done it before i'm not a plumber but you can correct me after service if you put 70 psi in that thing it's gonna blow apart it's not built to hold that pressure remember you preached that down there brother fred's meeting the pressure of the gun it's not built to hold that pressure not you you can put all that in there see you can you can put the message you can put it in a whirly material church and it'll blow it apart oh god i'm catching the second one preachers amen you can take this message and put it in a hybrid church and they'll say oh yeah god is a pr brother almost a prophet that's right amen malachi 4. but then you go to strike and some cords and he struck like you were not seen in a new birth he was already seated y'all here or like this the third pool is the opening of the word or like this the sword in the hand is the word of the lord blow up but then there's another group of people that when they hear that they don't actually blow up they blow out they they don't blow up they blow out they you'll be in that same church and have one oh one old person over here that can only take about 60 about 47 to 59 that's all they can take and you put that prayer oh this is coming fresh you put that pressure in him and he'll amen amen glory to god but you hit that 62 like spoken words original seed then you hit that 63 like the seven seals then you come over to things are to be and they'll blow up but you could have a word church you could have a holy ghost pipe in the same building brother brad and you go to porn the seventh seal is open you go to pour in the seven thunders awaken the bride out of our sleep you go to pour in the seven church ages and they won't blow apart they'll stand up on their feet they'll shout they'll run the aisles they'll have a holy ghost town you know why because we were built for this we were built for this message oh is there anybody that can raise your hand and say i am not ashamed i am not ashamed to say god built me in this age to carry this message under this anointing oh is there any young people here that can say i'm not ashamed to be identified with this message i was built to carry it brother manually was built to carry it it's who we are some of you all been through church wars and false doctrines but you're still here today glory he was built built to carry this built to go i know this is simple as simple can be but i pray you hear my heart this morning the next thing you go through god don't love me just another trial next thing we go through it's my desire to live for jesus i was built for this god's just showing the world that there's some people in the last days that don't have to be hooked on pills to get through life don't have to be hooked on pornography and dope and alcohol and everything else to get through life there's some people that don't just have to have the the religious blanket wrapped in them there's some people you can put them in the lines then and they'll praise god the pressure test you love him this morning oh before thou came us down the womb i sanctified thee i prepared thee brethren says not only is he up there speaking of eagle but he's built for that position he's got to be pressurized before he goes built to stand the pressure you realize what it is it's in time pressure was up in ohio the other day and we've been out to i think was out brother raising went out to arby's after service and was sitting there with some brothers talking and one brother spoke up i don't know his name but he just spoke up and he was a minister he's a minister there i i wish i knew his name i can't think of right now but he spoke up he said he said hey do you do you brothers ever feel a pressure when you quote the prophet of god behind the pulpit he said man i'm beginning to feel that pressure when you quote the prophet of god behind the pulpit some brothers just sitting there fellowshipping and i i started i thought myself oh yeah feel that pressure all the time thank god i don't feel it here but you feel it out there you know you feel it and i was just sitting there thinking brother brother wayne lawson was sitting over there and he spoke up he said hey sir but andrew said do you remember you come here several years ago and preach the message called the end time pressure i totally forgot about preaching that message he said you preached and he said in that message you actually made the statement there will come a time that you'll be an end time pressure of even quoting the prophet of god i totally forgot about it but brother sister our pressures are here there's going to be a pressure to live this message there's a pressure right now to even say you believe revelation 10 1 was fulfilled in 1963. there's a pressure right now to even hang a picture of a prophet of god up in a church pressure there's a pressure even getting the pulpit and read a quote pressure but isn't harry mary's here today that says i was born to carry this i was born to carry this pressure brother donny my womb was created to carry this message just as mary's wound was claimed by the spoken word of isaiah you'll bring forth the son god have mercy and all the pressure she went through you imagine when she started off walking that day to the whale program said she went down there and said ange lord appeared to her now i don't have time to go through all mary but i'll see it this way she had pressure of people even saying that child was born illegitimate and joseph had been with another man and all kinds of pressures all those pressures brother donnie was building up to one final pressure that right when she was taught to have the baby herod said everybody get to bethlehem you imagine everybody around there crying weeping carrying them we gotta we got to make a long journey to bethlehem and mary nine months pregnant ain't crying she's laughing and rejoicing joseph had got up with newborn faith brother says put her on that mule and sit over the hills and through the deserts and across the valleys and up the mountains they win said the worst time at all the woman could be on the back of a camel carrying a baby and then you imagine that passing by and saying that's that that's that woman that goes up here to happy valley that's that woman that believes that message right there look at her well she's lost her mind i knew it before long she would snap she's that she's on the back of that that camel and she's laughing and rejoicing at what she's going through and maybe she just hunted over and said this ain't nothing to what i've already been through [Music] church are built for it god send a message in this hour to build you for this time can you lift your hands and say thank you god for building me thank you god for the comfort of no one you built me thank you god for the word in revelation this hour heavenly revelation to know that what i'm going through brother john it ain't going to overcome me it ain't going to take me buddy i'll overcome it can i just go and preach to you this morning what is a what is a preacher said a preacher is a prophet a new testament prophet's a preacher you're going to come through it and you're going to stand on the other side of it and give glory to god that he brought you through it brother andrew do you see a vision brother do you see a vision or a prophet no i got the word right here that says and they all overcame him they all by the blood of the lamb glory and by the word their testimony do you love him this morning let's buy our hearts together he said well andrew it's it's really easy to preach these things and hear these things but it's so hard it's so hard to believe that when i'm going through trials it's so hard to believe that when i'm going through that loss it is it is but just as paul said the same god that give me grace we'll give you the grace to get through it i was studying the other day and i read where paul was sitting there getting ready to go off the scene and he was instructing timothy and he told timothy he said timothy hold fast to the words the form of sound words hold fast the form of sound words and i just began to thank young timothy looking at paul as a veteran soldier as a as an elder as a as a prophet of god and all that he had done for god and paul stand there and tell timothy timothy hold fast i began to think maybe timothy will look up at paul and say paul how can you tell me that when you're getting ready to go off the scene and i'm going to go through these things i want to go through a loss of a level and i want to go through a sickness i'm going to go through this and it come to me paul could look at him and say timothy because the same grace that was sufficient for me will be sufficient for you and i want to leave you with this today church the same grace that got them through the same grace that got william branham through taking this message around the world seven times in the witch halls of india in the in the in the the idolatry jungles of africa and all these places witchcraft and stuff but overcome it every time that same grace is in the building today no matter what you're going through would there be one here today could you slip your hand up and say god i need a baptism of that grace today baptize my mind today lord baptize my nerves today god baptize my bap just just just give me a baptism today of that grace lord lord i need a touch from you today god i i don't need somebody to come through and discern me and give me a vision and tell me what i had for breakfast no god i need you just to remind me remind me of these things lord stir up my heart today by the way of remembrance that god is going to get us through heavenly father lord all across this building today stands warriors father lord here stands caliber of people today god lord here stands soldiers lord that have been through wars and been through been through great trials been through great disappointments been through hurts humiliations all kinds of things lord the lord i just remember reminding myself this morning listening to a tape of who i was coming to preach to today i was coming to preach to people that i was privileged to grow up and watch lord i was coming to stand the day in a pulpit of a of a pastor that i was privileged to watch growing up and sit under lord trials and tests and persecutions but never laid the message aside lord a church here today father of people that's been through terrible things but they're still standing today god and lord you heard my heart's prayer this morning i don't come to give some great revelation or something this morning god just helped me some way somehow to get myself out of the way that your people can be encouraged to know why they're still standing and they're going to make it father i pray today for every man woman boy and girl lord the pressures of hell right now is greater than they've ever been lord the guns of satan are pointed at the church like they've never been pointed before lord so much confusion lord seems like every day you wake up and get another bad report of someone a brother or sister somebody's suffering their body somewhere another trouble another this but oh god i am so thankful that you would send a prophet to say but you were built for this kind of pressure you were built to stand right in the middle of all kinds of cancer reports and and and viruses and all kinds of things and stand there and say but god is still a healer god is still a miracle worker god is still a cancer killer god is still a waymaker father i pray today god you would encourage the heart of every one of these people today lord that no matter what they're going through today god may they be able to lift up their hands as job and say though this human body would break down though the skin worms would destroy it yet in my flesh i'll see god i know my redeemer loveth oh hallelujah hallelujah oh can you just raise your hands to him right now wherever you are maybe over in the fellowship hall or at home wherever you're at this morning here in the sanctuary did he just raise your hands to him and say god touch me today lord i'll just come by today god and minister some of that peace that passeth all understanding to my heart i need you today god i'm going to trust you lord i'm going to lay hold of that eternal life oh god friends

sun long enough to let that seed ripen in your heart have you laid there long enough to let the holy ghost reveal to you personally not just by me saying or brother donny or any other preacher but

build the ark out of something hard but something that would be soft and pliable friends don't ever let your heart get hard don't ever let your spirit get hard because the things you're going through in the trials we don't let that happen god built you to be soft to be a receiver to be a receptor of what he's delivered in this age but there he sings something for us god bless you today friends all
