you [Music] Heavenly Father as we bow our heads today and you're awesome we realize that one time being gentiles we could not even come into your courts we certainly could not go in behind the veil or the Shekinah God was but because you loved us so much you come to the Earth to pay a price to redeem us that whoever would want to have life could have it we're grateful thank you for dealing with our hearts Lord Jesus calling us to yourself we're grateful today we're not called to a church to a church system to a political system a religious system but a living resurrected Lord Jesus father you see we've gathered here today that we could sing and worship and pray and give witness to your power and also the hearing and the preaching of the word we're just praying that you'd come Among Us and meet our needs no doubt these hundreds of people that are standing here today there's so many needs and requests and desires plus the thousands of people that will stream this service and those that will go back and archive it later you're mindful of the needs of your children Jesus sometimes our needs become so great and so overwhelming that we don't know what to do but we're so grateful that we have you that we can come to in the time of such need take your word today speak to us father you see this handkerchief that I have your lord your God for this need Heavenly Father brother short we're praying for your mercy to him also Lord God we're asking you for brother Louie's brother brother Bob they're in the hospital and they've done several tests on him and still can't figure out exactly what's going on with him but I'll send you a word today in the name of Jesus May the spirit of God touch him Lord bring him out of that hospital dear God make him well speak to every heart today we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus amen praise the Lord admit an awesome opportunity to be a Christian today to be able to live for the Lord Jesus and this hour of terrible darkness and so much is coming upon the human race and people don't know what to do they don't know which way to turn they don't know which way to look would be the same way if it wasn't for the grace of God we're so grateful for him today remember September 23rd and 24th which will be Saturday night and Sunday morning brother Tim Burdette and his church will be with us and we're looking forward to that turn with me if you would today to the Book of Romans chapter 8 verse 35. how many would like to find out a little bit more about your Bill of Rights today as a believer I'm so grateful that God has given to us as his people so many wonderful things as I study on this and I think well I guess I'm just about done with it but until I find a whole lot more in that I realize I'm not sure you can ever get done with something like this it's so wonderful what is redeemed us from and redeemed us too and the Redemption has two parts going out of and going into many people came out of the world but they never really went into Christ all the way so that's what we desire to do today by his health listen to this profound scripture in Romans chapter 8 Paul of course we know had an understanding unlike any of the rest of the New Testament writers God had called him with a special insight into his word and even Peter wrote about Paul and he said that our beloved brother Paul which writes many things which are hard to be understood and he said that people twist them or rest wrest which was twist as they do the other scriptures so can you imagine that the Apostle Peter was was with the Lord Jesus personally but he recognized there was something in Paul unlike any of the rest of the brothers had and actually called Paul's writings the scriptures that's awesome then so listen to these scriptures today who shall separate us from the love of Christ look at the word separate put asunder divide part to depart to leave a husband or wife of of divorce so who shall separate us from the love of Christ now that's a question how many knows the answer nothing nobody nothing who shall separate us from the love of Christ now he's going to mention some things here I find it odd in the way that he says it because he says who then he identifies Watts notice he doesn't mention any person's name or any Demon's name but what he identifies is who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation I thought he said who tribulation is that a person tribulation which means look at the Greek word philipsis affliction trouble anguish burdened oppressing and make him relate to tribulation oppressing oppressing together oppression Affliction distress now listen to this who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed wow this certainly doesn't sound like the Christianity that's preached today the Christianity that's preached today as everything's going to go easy you you come from the devil and come from the world and first thing you get to Fleet of Cadillacs or whatever more everything's so easy that's not Bible Christianity and the church said as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long so not just once I mean do it once and get me out of this misery we're killed all the day long absolutely all the day long for the cause of the Lord Jesus we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are going to try our best to be able to hold on and maybe we will be able to survive at least one out of ten thousand we are more than conquerors through feelings through emotion through shouting we believe in all of that but this is not the way we conquer we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither deaths nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor Heights nor depths nor any other creature now Paul said just in case I left anything out let me blanket coverage everything from this point on any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord well I'll tell you what that's enough word we could just say the benediction and go home and say it's been good to be in the house of God but let's comment on it a little bit before we go what do you say and the believer said to the word amen God bless you you may be seated so from this let me take another one of your blessed wonderful inalienable rights that are given to you as the Believers in the gospel of the Lord Jesus it is a right that you are inseparable from God's program now all of us I'm sure have had friends and we were so close to them even maybe family members and maybe some of you are sitting here today and you find yourself estranged as we call it from a family member maybe it's a brother maybe it's a father a mother a grandfather a sister a man aunt or an uncle and you at one time were so close and something came between you a little simple misunderstanding maybe it was something about money maybe it was a disagreement about this and that and that person that you felt so close to and they loved you so much and you love them so much and today you all don't even speak and today you find yourself when you think about that person you find yourself feeling a very unusual feeling about them it's it's an estranged feeling that you don't feel the same way you did before and if you truly love that individual I'm sure that you feel sort of sad because you reminisce of the good times you had together and you think of the days you spent together in family gatherings and you think of the things that you talked about and the fellowship that you had oh but it's been six months maybe a year maybe it's five and you sought your by your bind was together was so Inseparable but some little something come between you and now you don't even call you don't text you have no contact whatsoever because for the last how many ever times that you tried to reconcile that that individual it wound up being in an argument and things was worse than they were before he ever tried to fix it and then finally you say you know what I just don't know what else to do but maybe I just need to pull away from my uncle from my aunt from my cousin and just pray that God will work this thing out but no doubt if you really love that individual you don't feel the same in your heart that you did before now what is that that's because something has separated something that was strong now had it not been for the determinant Council of almighty God there would every one of us that are saved and since the cross down through time Satan would have found out a way to most likely separate every one of us from the love of God had it been based on our faithfulness had it been based on our durability had it been based on our pace patients and our faith and so on and so on anything that you base on human beings it's very shaky anything that you base on human beings it's questionable and more than likely there will be a failure now don't misunderstand me when I say it this way there is no preacher there is no human being that I put my ultimate confidence in because they will let you down there is one that I put my ultimate confidence in and I know he will never disappoint me and that's the Lord Jesus now I've had really good close preacher friends and and then we get into a little difference of opinion about a certain Doctrine or something you know whatever it would be and you try to reconcile and you go to sharing quotes and sharing scriptures and then you'll come to a spot where you talk about it and then you try to reconcile with that brother and then you realize you know what we just don't agree on this and seem like every time we talk about it we get further and further apart so I think we're just going to have to let it be but yeah it you don't feel quite the same way because if anyone mentioned that individual's name and in your heart you'd say oh my I I wish that wasn't there between us I wish that wasn't there but God knew that us as humans were totally unreliable to be able to be dependent on to enter into an Everlasting Covenant and are fully us fully keep our part it's totally impossible Moses could not keep his Covenant with God Adam could not keep his Abraham could not keep his there has never been one Covenant that God ever made with man outside of his unconditional Covenant by the Lord Jesus that was ever kept the Torah the mishnah all the great Commandments that God gave to the children of Israel and the there was none of them that ever kept them no as God gave the levitical order and the priesthood and the levitical sacrifices and all that they did and there was never one person that ever kept the levitical order that could ever keep God's covenant without a fault and a failure and the Lord knows even under grace if God did not make this Covenant to where it was totally dependent upon himself and not dependent upon us that wouldn't be a one of us here that's even be saved well come on somebody because every one of us have fallen short I mean it's fallen short of the glory of God how many has made mistakes how many still has to repent Lord I'm sorry so what if God would have made a covenant with you now I will do this and this and this and this as long as you obey every word and as soon as you break one of my Commandments then I break my Covenant and it's finished with you and I and I will never again make another Covenant with you well I can tell you the first one in this assembly today that would have been disqualified it would have been the preacher because I have made countless of mistakes and as bad as I hate to say it I'll probably make a bunch more and I'll go ahead and say it for you more than likely every one of you are going to make them two the only way I figure that none of us will ever make any more mistakes is we have your funeral tomorrow night other than that it's pretty much a given we're all gonna fall short we're gonna make mistakes come on somebody say Amen we are going to trespass against God's law so how is it that we have a right which is inalienable in other words it can never be broken God did not give us the Covenant as it was the original adamic Covenant God did not even give us the Covenant as he did to the children of Israel you can read about it Deuteronomy 14 5 Deuteronomy 6 the Romans 31 Deuteronomy 33 you can read Jeremiah 31 Jeremiah 35 you can read how that God set forth his Covenant and he said if you will do this I'll bless you I'll bless your coming in I'll bless your going out I'll make you the head and not the tail I'll do this and this and this if you will do this and this and this and God kept his part but they didn't keep theirs why were the Jews driven out of the promised land because they did not keep their Covenant if it was not for the grace of God God every one of us sitting here today and not only us but every other Christian that has lived since the cross would have been alienated from the Covenant of God and there wouldn't even be a gentile bride in the last day but God could not make it on the trust or the ability of a human being to keep a covenant now I don't care how righteous you think you are today how much you pray how much you read your Bible how many times you go to church you help the Widow you help the poor you do all of that there's not a person in this building or a person around the world that has the ability in them to keep every one of God's covenant promises and never fall short of the glory of God now here's some of you come to church today and then think you need Grace and I've done hit you right in the face with the awfullest need of Grace of your life you needed to praise God you're going to need Grace to walk out of this building you're going to need Grace to go to work in the morning you're going to need Grace to believe God with all of your heart because it's not in us don't ever get in your mind that it's in me oh I made up my mind glory to God I grabbed the whole of the horns of the altar I'm telling you one thing I made up my mind Oh Glory it wasn't you doing any of that it was the mercy of God how many of you have made up your mind I ain't serving God another day I'm turning back I can't take it no more you done made up your mind you don't pick talk some of your sisters unpicked out the new hairstyle you're just gonna have when you had your hair cut off you don't pick up brothers and pretty short she was going to slip on some of them Bermudas I guess or some of them Hawaiian ones with some pretty pink flowers so you look like what you're portraying a big well preach brother Donnie some of you don't pick out the brand the cigarettes is going to start smoking some of you may have picked out the alcohol you was going to start drinking and all of a sudden some got a hold to you that wasn't you it was bigger than you better than you greater than you more profound than you stronger than you who is it it's the Covenant keeping God and he come by his grace and undergirded you and the time of your greatest trial and gave you the ability to stand there and say Lord I'm so sorry I can't believe I was even thinking about going back to the world I cannot think I was even thinking about such a thing but what was it oh yes I I got a hold to myself you never done no such a thing he got a hold to you if he hadn't got a hold of you you'd have got to hold to yourself and you wouldn't be in church today it wasn't you all but I made up my mind yeah and then tomorrow you'll change it again but we're talking and about a god which made a covenant with Abraham and he did not say Abraham if you'll do this I'll do that and if you'll do this I'll do that but he said as for me my Covenant is with thee it was not upon congestions because Abraham lied Abraham fell short of the glory of God we're going to have church today Abraham lied Joseph oh Jacob look at all of those Patriarchs look at every one of the 12 sons and what they all done look at Peter falling short of the glory of God turned out to be a cussing preacher and denied the Lord Jesus said he even knew him it was not that Peter was a great man Peter was a coward when it come right down to it how was it that Peter could say I'll tell you Lord I'll never deny you no sir John will I know John ain't got the right Spirit about him James will deny you Lord and more solemn you will deny you but I'll tell you one thing Lord God I'll never deny you Hallelujah I'll stand up here praise God watch it Peter you're bragging on your flesh and God's Gonna humble it I wonder how many of us was like Peter I'll tell you one thing I'll be standing when there ain't nobody else and God will let you fall flat on your big face and mash that big mouth of yours and that big nose of yours and then you've got to get up and say oh Jesus I'm so sorry forgive me Lord I thought I was strong but I realize I ain't no come on somebody but God said I'm not gonna make this Covenant with her flesh I'm not going to make this Covenant with their faithfulness but I am going to make this Covenant with my seed which I will place inside of them it will motivate them it will mature them it will drive them it will lift them when they are low I will make this Covenant with myself and place a deposit of myself inside of them and this will be what brings to pass a tremendous victory in the love divine because it's not my determination it's not your determination hey we're going to have church this morning oh glory to God brother Donnie I love him so much I do too but there's times I've questioned that I haven't understood anybody to be honest with the Lord today have you ever questioned Lord I don't understand this and I don't understand that why is this going on and why is that going on but when my questions still don't get answered the seed of God is still there says so what's he going to do I said what you mean what I'm going to do I'm going to keep on serving him of course that's what I'm going to do I'm going to love him I'm going to go to church I'm going to preach I'm going to pray I'm going to do right I'm going to live right I'm going to speak right because there's something in me that's greater than me it ain't me it ain't you it ain't even your great desire it's the spirit of God that says there is nothing that can separate you from the love of God notice this the prophet said God don't want you to be frowning everybody look at the screen please and let your face know you believe this go ahead easy there you go even science will tell you it takes a whole lot less muscle to smile than it does to frail God don't want you to be frowning God wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy worry you know I find so amazing the people are so terrified of cancer they take all types of vitamins they will subscribe to oh my goodness a little green worm not an Amazon that secretes a certain certain thing and that little green worm if we can bottle that little fella and be able to get all this floral carbons and all this out of him how many people take things every day to prevent cancer and worry from the time they get up to the time they go to bed well come on somebody do we believe this or not so worry causes cancer and you're you thought it was just smoking what smoking does and lots of other things do too but so does worry why because you're working against your own human heart you was not made to worry oh Hallelujah you were not made to carry everybody's burdens and try to fix everybody's situation there's only one person that can do that and that's God and I don't see God in this building here today I see portions of him inside of you but the greater we can get ourself out of the way and be able to have a life how many wants to be cancer-free hmm someone how many of y'all worry about the elements in the air and in the water and you've got Culligan water and you've got this some of you make your

Hallelujah to God it stole your dance worry will steal your praise worry will steal your Worship in the presence of God why has no virtue none help me Jesus temper will cause cancer now we won't dwell on that one too long because I do know that some folks in our church who have temper and I don't want them to display it on me this morning they'll never be upset just walk in love amen knowing that you're walking in him enough can harm you there's nothing can harm you there's neither Powers things present things future things can separate nothing can separate us from him we never come in by our own will he by choice elected us and brought glory to God brought into him you didn't come because you wanted to you come cause he wanted you to [Applause] so in other words I'm secure as long as he wants me you're secure as long as he wants you and he don't ever change his mind about his word so if he ever thought of you he can never sink a noose out of you I don't want you no more I don't love you no more oh I'm going to divorce you out of my mind he can never do that because he's God nothing can separate you from the love of God or you say praise God brother daughter if that's the way it is I'm going to go out today after church and I'm going to get drunk and I'm going to do this and that another you don't even know him yet you see once that hits your heart it strikes you with such a reality you don't want to do anything wrong you don't want to do anything wrong you don't want to sin you don't want to see how close you can get to the world you want to see how far you can stay away from it why would you want to hurt a beam like this that knew you could not keep a covenant impossible so he said this is what how to the book of Jeremiah shall come to pass in those days I will write my Covenant upon their hearts they will love me in spite of Mama they will love me in spite of Daddy and most of all in spite of their self you know the bride's going to be Bride In Spite of herself you're going to be saved in spite of you you realize that we're going to be saved in spite of us most of us ain't worth a plug nickel or sorry we're going we're I'll tell you what some of the laziest people people don't pray people don't put forth the effort near put forth the effort that drunks do drunks have to go to a lot of troublesome to get on a drunk they better drive a good distance they got to sell their their car they got to sell their wheels off the car they've got to steal I mean did any of y'all have to steal anything to come to church today did anybody have to hold up somebody on the side of their own side I've got to go to church I've got to get a fix I've got to get it fixed I got to go to church did anybody risk robbing anybody to be able to get gas to come to church the drunks do it drug addicts do it why because they've got to have their fix but not Christians we've got to be pumped all right everybody let's praise the Lord I just don't feel I'm so sad I'm soberden now Neil drunk us up today I don't care if it's an old lady I don't care if it's a little boy I need it you ought to walk through them doors back here and say devil I need a good dose of the Holy Ghost I need a good dose of Joy I need a good dose of just worshiping God so I'm learning you right now devil you better get out of my way because I've come to the house of God I'm going to let all hell know whose side I'm on I'm going to praise him I'm going to love him I'm going to sing to him I'm going to bless his name and I ain't gonna worry one minute cause you see when some folks come to church that's when the religious worry kicks in and then they go to thinking if I raise my hands what will they think I mean what what if I was to really yield myself to the Holy Ghost and the Lord made me act like brother Donnie it ain't so bad I've been doing this my whole life really it ain't that bad well what what would people say cancer causing agents so you're worried about this and worrying about that and worrying about somebody else and you're coming to the house of God to get free of your worry and you worry more once you get your kid than if you stayed home why because you're so concerned about what somebody else thinks I wonder what he thinks about us today is he pleased with the way you worship is he pleased with the amount of times you raise your hands and the amount of times you sing or is he pretty dissatisfied oh my goodness whoo is it just me or is it hot in here today so notice this nothing can separate us from him we're in him we never come our own well he by choice elected us and brought us so it's his business to take care of what he's took his self no man can pluck them from my father's hands because he's the greatest of them all amen it's the father who takes care of it who's got more power than God so what kind of power have you got over to take care of you the whole powers that created the universe is plural amen that took the solar system oh my and blew every Star went to its place he watches over you and the church said that's the kind of father we have how many believes what you just heard read that's the kind of father we have notice again he says God's purpose can never be defeated there is nothing can defeat it so how happy we are to be today resting upon that beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there is neither things present nor things can come nor sickness nor sorrow nor death nor perilous nor anything can separate us from the purpose of the Living God oh my brother down is bad the world is in bad shape I know it is friends but there is nothing that can separate you from the purpose of the Living God it ought not to weight us down in this Troublesome time it ought to give us such a consolation to know the same God that hail Shadrach Meshach Abednego and Daniel in the Lion's Den is the same one that's got to hold to your life today but I'm in the middle of trouble that's right you may be but he will bring you out of that trouble because there is nothing can stop his purpose Hallelujah there is nothing can ever separate God's Great Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God has said notice again Paul in verse 39 nor Heights nor depths nor any other creature shall be able to separate us again I love the way the prophet says it this way he called by election he sent his church in order and he said no man can come except the father draws him you never come to God because you wanted to you come because Christ called you if you're saved today cause you want to be if you change your mind that means you're lost again but if you're saved because he chose you well that means you'll never be lost hey man it is part of my rights that if it is my right why should I fear Why Should I Worry oh I hope I can make it I hope I can make it I've already made it by the grace of God there is nothing that can stand before us that will hinder us over brother Donny the tribulation this is coming that's coming that ain't got no effect on me I'm bride I ain't gonna be your middle tribulation period I'm going home in a Rapture I'm going home at a body shape well what if you get sick he said he'd heal me what if he faced disaster he said he'd Raised Me Up what if you face all kinds of terrible things I have I have my entire walk with god look fast I didn't get saved just yesterday I've been serving them for decades and let me stand right here and tell you today he has never all the years that I've been serving him he has never let me down he has never failed me anybody witness to the same thing I've been pastoring for over 40 years and I'll tell you right now he has never failed me one time he will never fail any of us if we can trust him or of course we can just sit around and worry foreign I told you the so-called prophecy that I heard years ago in Pentecost when someone spoke in tongues and then someone supposedly prophesied he said yeah the times were so troubled even I am Shook Up that's not my Lord God my Lord God ain't never been Shook Up they make no nerve pills for the almighty the almighty does not need any nervous tonic he don't have a restless leg he don't have restless hand he don't have Restless Heart he don't have restless mind as a matter of fact when he come to the Earth and they thought they killed him and he showed up down on Hell's door and he knocked on the devil's door and the devil come to the door and said oh it's you the Lord Jesus was not saying they're shaking while I'm so terrified devil I'm so terrified he said I thought I got you and I got able now he said but I have arrived and my blood is hot on Calvary and I've come for the keys let me tell you something the Lord Jesus reached and grabbed a hole to the keys of death and hell and cancer and TB and oppression and sadness and weariness and he kicked that door shut and the devil don't even have the keys to his own house and you you are free you you are free or you can be like this or you can use reverse psychology on the devil and then when he comes around and of course they're making you you're going to say ah I'm devil I was only acting I'm going to get you close so I could burn your hide with a word so devil instead of me being nervous I've got an idea that you might ought to be the one nervous because the more preaching I'm hearing the more I realize who I am I'm a son and daughter of God I can't be lost I can never perish I can never be counseled out of the mind of God I'm here for a purpose and part of that purpose is to spread on serpents and to be able to stand against you cast out Devils heal the sin and live a life that makes hell tremble or wouldn't it be awesome if our church could make nervous Devils go to doing this [Applause] all right I hope back to this service all of them that's here there's a bunch of them here I can feel them but I hope they go like this down to Hell after church Satan said Lord have mercy amen whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what what what what word for life spit it ever Word of Life Church [Applause] so did you hear what he preached there's a young man on the front they got it this young sister there that got it there was another one back there God I know if they ever see who they are we're in trouble if they ever see who they are if they ever get it they don't have to worry they don't have to friend he loves them he cares for them thank you a person would like to visit hell on the occasion after church services and they're pulling them demons down into the rehab section where was you at this morning up in Virginia well it's you Zimbabwe bad and Satan has this demon psychologist now all together we are save it we are more than them we can conquer these people remember they were former drunks that were former Liars they were former unbelievers I considered oh devil Earth can I say something what you had the right word former pay no more [Applause] technology who they are they watched they're filled with the Holy Ghost he that comes to me I will in no wise cast out Hubble give him everlasting life not just lasting for a week one Revival to another but Everlasting eternal life and we'll raise him up at the last day if that doesn't take the wind out of the out of Satan's sails I love doing that I love taking the wind out of Satan's sails because here we are out on this sea of time and Satan is depending upon the trade winds now those of you that studied Trade Winds understand that that one time in the world before they'd be able to go around the earth and explore it they thought if you could ever get away from what they known as civilization and the winds would carry you that way that proven it that the winds was moving a certain way on the Earth but they thought there'd be no way back so you'll just go in that One Direction and you'll never get back and then someone ventured out and found out that the winds come back another way so out you're out there they have no boat motors they have no other way the only way they can move is the wind so I wonder what kind of people would be here today if the spirit of God is able to take this word and go and blow the wind out of the devil's sails and the devil's sitting out there in the hot ocean what in the world is going on is that pressure what's that person I keep telling you dumb bunch of gnaw heads they get alone and get to praying and some of them go to breaking into some kind of language and talking strange stuff like I never heard in my life I know some of them boys are dumber and dirt daubers why they ain't smart at all how in the world can they speak in so many languages it's more than I understand and they come out of there they go in that study I have everything in the world I can to stop them I have the service to be a little bit tight and the guitar breaks the strain on the PA don't work and this don't work and that don't work and you know what they do they say we're not letting the devil stop this service we're having church here today so they go ahead and they start preaching they start saying and them saints it's like bombs it's like a smart bomb and he'll come over them with a drone and all of a sudden he'll push the trigger and they see it oh my Lord that's me and then he'll fly over another and it drops on that one and that one and that one another one and I I was convinced the majority of one even coming backwards and I I don't have them so down and so to feel they said well I guess this will be my life stay coming to church I ain't never coming back after church they went looking for me and they said all right devil where are you where are you you liar you liar you have defeated me you stole my joy you stole my happiness you caused me to worry from the time I wake up until I go to bed at night and then you even torment my dreams with worrying dreams but guess what today devil after this service I ain't worried now I ain't gonna ask you to raise your hands because I don't want you to lie when I wonder how many of you are Brave and Bold enough in God to make such a statement to hell I will never worry well I guess when close the service because I've done killed in it friends you want I wonder what kind of church we could be if we could believe and take God and his word brother Donnie how can you say such a thing when your daughter has been given up by the doctors one after another after another because my hope and in the doctors I'd rather die if I have no more treatment well I agree with that but Jesus Does but her pain has got worse it has and as it gets worse we just pray more don't we that don't change one thing but brother don't yell aren't you worried aren't you afraid that that the devil is going to take her out of God's hands that devil can never take one out of God's hands he ain't big enough he ain't got enough power come on children I'm just talking about my daughter I'm talking about yours and your sons and your family and your children but instead of believing we worry all right Paul said there's nothing present nothing future neither sickness or peril nothing could ever separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus no bad bodies no UPS no doubs nothing else nothing can ever separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus sickness sorrow hunger Strife differences in the church difference of opinion no matter what it is nothing can ever separate you from the love of God why you have a legal right well I have trouble yes well I have sickness you will what about Satan hit me with everything he can he certainly will but even at that he cannot do it unless God allows him to do it and if God allows him to do it he's doing it for a reason so that he can use you to prove his glory praise the Lord notice this he gives you an abstract title all the way back in the blood of Jesus Christ listen to this devil the blood of Jesus Christ is just as good as it would have been shed 10 minutes ago so if the Lord Jesus would have died right here on this Pulpit 10 minutes ago and y'all would have saw the blood come out of his body and you needed saving you'd run up and touch the blood and you needed healing I'll I'll touch the blood that come out of his body that that's the price of the atonement I'll be healed I'll be saved I'll be delivered can you imagine in your mind it's just as powerful as if he would have died 10 minutes ago instead of over 2 000 years ago but it won't do any good if you and I don't believe it's just as powerful you believe it's just as much God is he as much God as he was whenever he said let there be light and there was like absolutely I said every believer at your profession you're just scared to use your rights scared to use your rights what are we scared of we're scared the devil we'll come back and try to get us that's what we're scared of Brothers just skip that next part that's quite long let's go down to the next one handwriting on the wall paragraph 21 and the devil likes to work on you under pressure you know that's a trick of the devil but when the Christian knows his legal rights when you can quote God's word I'll never leave thee or forsake thee that takes all the oppression away and the clouds begin to clear back if you just know how God has promised God is faithful oh Hallelujah how many can take God at his word but brother Donnie what if I don't feel anything Jesus never did say that if you feel it you're better he said did you believe it notice again oh God what an evil thing Satan is he binds the helpless he comes in by force he puts the children of God into corners but tonight he's exposed and tonight we realize he is just a bluff he has no legal rights so if you go in after church today and while you were going to church somebody moved in your house now brother Philip it took y'all a long time to build that pretty little house y'all got down there in the mountains you know Sister Robin go home and oh there's a man of 14 kids that moved in and three wives 14 donkeys eight cows they turn your horses out nothing really nice fencing Pastor they're out there trotting all over her and you go in of course brother Phillips this nice humble sweet gentle brother and say hope y'all enjoy your new place well if he done that sister Robin would hit him in the mouth and out all the way Philip I'll take care of this there ain't one of us I don't care how humble how loving how gentle if we would go home and someone had moved in our house while we were a church and we said well I guess we'll just have to find us another place to live hope you all enjoy it and they still you get ready to say hey wait a minute don't you think we're going to pay the payments give us your forwarding address because you're still paying the payments you pay the insurance and you pay the upkeep yes yes I'll give you my address as soon as I get a little pup tent on the side of the road and I'll let you know what my mailbox says no we'll never do that when it comes to our natural possession we'd fight we'd take somebody to court don't sit there and look at me like you wouldn't do it why you'd sue somebody in a New York minute if they come out there and they stole your car you might have an old jalopy on the outside and they're sitting out there ain't started in five years and somebody said what's up well you believe that he stole my car that belonged to Great office on so and so on so if you would do that for a car if you would do that for a house what about your health what about your peace what about your joy what about your right to be a son or daughter of God well you need to take the devil to court and say Lord Jesus he's trying to steal my body and he's trying to steal my health but I want to sue the devil so you sisters go in and there they are sitting in the kitchen you got all over your young ones and told them to clean up the orange juice and pick up all the toast and all that stuff and here are these bunch of dead beets have come in they got mud all over their shoes they've ruined your pretty clean floor they went into your closet and they went into your pantry and they vented everything out took what they wanted and they're piled up there in the house and they're they're smoking and they're drinking and they're committing adultery and doing all kinds of evil and you tell me you're going to let them do that what are you going to do nine one one our kids know it I hope I don't know it better than we know j e s u s so Satan moved in your body with a disease moved in between you and your wife at home you can't even have a conversation without arguing you know what's happened Satanist took up residence in your habitation you need to pick up your spiritual phone and say Jesus I'm sick of this this devil has stole my house I don't have any peace in my mind left I'm in constant turmoil Lord I go to church I have no peace I'll lay down at night I had no peace it's unbelievable how many of our small children that I have prayed for in the last few weeks that cannot sleep at night unbelievable how many of your children are fighting oppression and demonic power and won't even let them sleep or torment them with awful dreams I'm sick of it what about parents wherever the dawn I guess that's just that just comes with the end time and I guess you know they ain't really nothing we can do speak for yourself I'm called to cast out devils praise the Lord Satan has no legal rights over our family over our heritage over our body and now brother Donnie you can just expect it now you and sister Carol turned 67 we all know and you're getting to be an old man I didn't need you to tell me that but thank you for the info but show me one scripture in the Bible that tells me I have to be trodden down with blood pressure show me one scripture in the Bible I find in my Bible that my Bible says they loved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in would somebody please tell me the age limit on that verse you're free to sin accept when you get on Medicare you really need a 10. Lord I never thought I'd ever be old enough to sign up on Medicare but believe it or not your pastor is on Medicare but I already had a Medicare it comes from the cross and this one here don't just include scripts it Cleaves Divine health I know you don't hear it preaching Us in the message I never have heard it myself I have never heard a sermon preach on Divine Health even though the prophet uses those terms and the Bible does but it's still in the Bible and it's still in the message a lot of folks emphasize Divine Healing Divine Healing what about Divine Health what about Divine Health well how good is well how old are you 120 well glory to God why not have a little shouting Divine Health when you're 119 or you mean God can do it we are the ones that limit God not God himself [Applause] so we just accept it well high blood runs in my family I guess I might as well go ahead and get on high blood pressure pills lumbago lumbago runs in my family uh and a flat feet yep flat feet if you claim everything every member of your family's got what do you want me to say at your funeral you'll be doing good to live to Wednesday night where do we get all this where does the bible tell us start claiming blood pressure when you get so old where does the bible instruct us where does the message instruct us Alzheimer's kicks in in your family at a certain certain age well I mean I hate that thing but who says I have to run in that same cycle why not let that Alzheimer's cycle break with me or break with you or break with you or break with you or you want to stand in line for Alzheimer's you'll want to stand in line for Parkinson's you want to stay on the line for the rest of this stuff it don't mean he won't try to put it on you but it means you ain't signing for it you look the devil in the face and say that take that box of rattlesnakes right back to hell where you come from we ain't a serpent handling church that's the only way we handle Devils is kick them right back to Hell take your sickness back to hell [Applause] laughs I know some may be thinking I'm wondering about Brother Don he is Alzheimer's kicking in huh it's the mind of Christ actually [Applause] let me find a place to close there's no need for us to live and under privileged people there's no need for us to live in the defeated state because he defeated the devil and took all the principalities and powers and subdued them under his feet and they have no legal rights to rule over you we are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost and we don't have we don't have to have the devil dictate to us Christ delivered us total Deliverance delivered us from evil delivered us from sin delivered us from Habits delivered us from talking you know some of us still need to deliver from that for sure delivered us from blackguard delivered us from all kinds of smutty things pleat total Deliverance praise God praise God it's my right it's my right to walk with an Inseparable attitude toward God even when I don't feel him how many goes through that in your life and you just don't feel the Lord the way you want to people around you feeling it everywhere and it just seemed like you can't feel nothing you think God what's going on what Lord have he left me no that's your right he can never do that let me close with this you see God knew there but have to be a way by which he would project such things as I've talked to you about this morning because to the carnal mind it makes no sense and as much as we love and appreciate all the Medical Science has done to help us but you know yourself in your lifetime most of you that medical science has started identifying more genes and more things that are inherited so if somebody in your family have winds up with a certain thing then they want to check everybody else in the family well have they got it oh that's in your gene pool and if you're not careful you will accept that and science is making it easier for you to believe years ago people didn't know that many of these things run in their gene pool so they didn't expect them but now we do so now you can go get scanned Lord have mercy I wouldn't recommend that you come out there with a list that long well you're prone to this you're prone to that I wonder how many people signed for the whole list before they get to the parking lot to pick up their car [Music] for who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ several New Testament words are used for this word mind this one here is newest understanding judging the capacity for Spiritual truths The Faculty of perceiving Divine things you see this is why some church members can never perceive spiritual things of God a sermon like today they say I visited that church today I believe that's the most strange place I've ever been in my life you know or something like that that was the nuttiest guy I ever heard in my life they said he's talking about all the stuff I never heard no such stuff well you see the natural carnal Church person cannot be able to comprehend because they don't have the mind of Christ the news of Christ notice what it is the faculty of perceiving divine things of recognizing goodness and of hating of evil this is why many church people become involved in something so evil and so wrong in a church body because they don't have the ability to discern between the two so Satan can move right among them with a false Doctrine whatever it is move right among them and it's amazing good people that love the Lord and they'll side with the wrong thing we say how can that be they're missing the mind of Christ they don't have the ability to discern between right and wrong so they will look at something as wrong as it can be by the word and they will look at it and say I don't see nothing wrong with it I think it's okay I think that's a good man that's a good woman I think that's good I think that's okay why they're missing this now watch the Power of considering and judging soberly calmly and impartially but you see a person without the mind of Christ will make judgments based upon how well they like that individual or that individual and if they like that person better than that person they'll take the scriptures and apply it a whole lot more Stern way because they like this one better well they're missing mind of Christ they're not missing scriptures they're missing the ability to judge impartially well it's the same way when it comes to our position in Christ This is why the bride has a different mind than the church so the church just thinks about getting along and just been able to surviving this world but the bride thinks about what should I be what does he want me to be what is my inheritance where am I going what what lays in front of us will you believe whatever you want to believe I just read at this moment where the Prophet said that he was looking for a time to come on the Earth when the anointing of God would come back on the earth and every felon of this church would be a refilling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that would be the Dynamics I'm looking for that myself I'm not sure what you're looking for I peculiar mode of thinking and judging thoughts feelings purposes and desires so he has endowed us with the same disposition so we can read the word and with the mind of Christ if we have that we will read the word and we get out of it the exact same thing that God does ah therefore we're capable of knowing his mind and finding out his will for our lives so these teachings then are handed down to those who are part of the initiated Philippians 2 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus verse 6 who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God so let the mind of self-empting be in you the mind of self emptying self-denial self crucifixion this is the way Jesus came to the Earth this was his mind let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being on the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God and I hope you can take the other verse but made himself of no reputation no reputation so he wasn't a big guy you know I'm the biggest guy among my mama stuff sure top of God I'm the big guy no the mind was self-empting you see when we meet God on these grounds and we empty self God looks at us as a vessel ready to receive more of him [Applause] so the mind of Christ means the attitude exhibited by Christ himself show your attitude should be the same as Christ Jesus and of course your attitude will determine your attitude your altitude will also be determined by your destiny and you will be joined together with the other ones who've received the mind of Christ down through every age listen to this the angel of God it's the mind of Christ the human being has the privilege to enter in I know the mind of Christ hallelujah what a reality to dwell in the channel of Christ we unworthy Mortals we've been brought to be Sons and Daughters of God to be fellow citizens so we're given the opportunity I love it this way when the prophet was sitting in his room and the spirit of God came into the room and said pick up your pen and write you're familiar with it but let us start on down into it a few paragraphs now here is the secret the bride not only has the word but she has the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word but you see what Satan wants to do is mimic and impersonate those around us and they think just because they have the word alone that's all they need but watch what they do with it and they'll tell you whether they're out of their mind or not so what does God do projects to the elect the mind of Christ you see Paul wrote to Timothy and he said I have no other no other now remember there was Philemon that was Titus there was all kinds of other preachers but Paul said there is none other like you who is of the same mind as I am so Timothy was able not only to get Paul's Epistles and Paul's quotes but he got the same mind to know what God wanted done was Paul's word what was it replicate Christ not make a system so I'm asking you then what are you doing with the word God's given you we have this message we have the Bible we have all these things so what are you doing with it what do you think God wants done with the word just memorize it talk it debate about it argument fuss it what do you think God I'm asking you what do you think God wants done with his word nobody's gonna answer okay well I'll tell you what he once done and then you see where you're at he wants this word to be made flesh read it yes listen to it yes say Amen to it yes but don't stop there with the mind of Christ you take that and become a part of that word that when people see you they see an epistle you say that's crazy it is not it's your new testament Paul called them people and they're Believers in his day written Epistles of God read and known of all men I may wants it with all your heart let's bear our heads together if you would you see if God can get us as his people to this place that we not only memorize the word so when we're sick we quote scriptures about sickness when we're fighting battles we quote scriptures about whatever it is but God don't want us just quoting scriptures but God wants us at his time in his season now listen to me carefully to where it won't be you quoting it but the father himself included and you might quote the scripture if you say to this mountain be moved but if God ever says it that mountain is gone praise the Lord how many wants that in your life God can speak his word out of our lips I know it's astounding friends I know it's absolutely be considered idiotic to many people the world but yet the prophet said there's human faith and there's the faith of God and you must have a Godly face to believe now to have that Godly Faith you must have the mind of Christ in you that's how God projects to you Visions Revelations and all these things by Christ's mind being in you so you're right is inseparable and then here's another right you have a right to have the mind of Christ it's your right to have the mind of Christ Heavenly fathers we have our heads about we're asking you today for your help I know Lord that any person that would be physically able to read and

the presence of the king now you just from your heart just let him know how much you love him what it means to you praise the Lord you're inseparable from his presence he wants to lead you and guide you he wants to love you when the minister sent me a quote yesterday and the prophet said the Lord Watches Over You day and night wanting to do things for you watch is over you day and night wanting to do things for you can you imagine God wanted Moses to build a tabernacle and put it in the midst of the congregation God wanted to come down by his Shekinah and live in that holiest of holies God wanted to hear him talk about their children and the problems and their issues and their troubles God said make me a tabernacle Moses suck and dwell among my people how honored we are to feel today that God don't want just to live in this place here and then when we go home here in a few minutes then we leave God behind but we take him with us and our souls because God said I don't want to leave you children when you sit down and talk to your wife about your issues I want you to know them they're listening when you're concerned about your grandkids when you're concerned about your bills and you're concerned about this and that I want you to know I'm in your midst and not be honored to help you if you'd let me praise the Lord praise the Lord God we worship you Lord Jesus forgive us for not making you a bigger part of our lives oh Jesus we want you to be part of our family we want you to be part of our decision making about our children's education about her vocation in life and what we should do I believe you would help us more if we'd only let you but somehow we think we're troubling you too much how many times have I been building something and I just couldn't figure it out or how many times have I been refinishing something and I could not get the stain combination correct and that would stop and pray and all of a sudden a thought would come to me mix this American Cherry number 206. with dark oak number 185. and then mix it together and there was the answer Lord you're concerned about the little things oh if these people only realized how much you want to be a part of their morning coffee when they're sitting there at their table and they're dreading the day and they're dreading the things they've got to face if they just talk to you their dreads would be lifted and the worries would be gone and they could start today with peace instead of worry oh Jesus we worship you We Worship You Holy Father thank you Lord God sing something let's just worship can we just take a few more minutes I know you got your lunch and all that but let's just take a few a few more minutes before we go in his presence oh Father out on the water storms raging High I get waters around them yes the trouble their mind so true for fear in their hearts and they thought they would die all they would die Bill to remember Hallelujah he spoke the word [Music] even though it must obey his will he calmed their storm just like he will mind if I'll just stream in he lives deep inside why should I work hurry why should I feel the very same Jesus he stays always near he lives in my heart and he hears when I cry I call on the master till the storm passes by we read in the Bible how he walked with him brought light with a darkness when the way grew so down how great it would be all of the time when troubles [Music] all I have to do is saying Jesus he stays always [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] standing right near you this morning [Music] in my heart help of yours forgive us on his name till the storm passed thank you Lord oh thank you Jesus we love you so much father We Worship You Lord God praise the lord we worship you Lord Jesus Hallelujah God bless you saints that means that's been good to be in the house of the Lord George I came to somebody tell them God bless you turn and tell somebody it's good to be in the house of the Lord God bless you I'll see you again
