[23:03] to earth.

[24:07] They said I wouldn't make it,
[24:12] that I should give up.
[24:15] [Music]
[24:17] But they didn't know that the God that I
[24:21] serve is more than enough.
[24:27] He can move mountains.
[24:32] He can make broken beautiful.
[24:36] I never run out of hoping. I run to the
[24:41] God of Mirales.
[24:47] I am a living, breathing, walking
[24:52] testimony.
[24:56] I am the living proof of what the Lord

[27:41] Come on.
[27:43] [Music]
[27:45] [Applause]
[27:50] You can't seem to hide
[27:54] the hurt written on your face.
[27:58] You're broken inside.
[28:03] Longing for love's embrace.
[28:07] It might be a while before you smile. I
[28:13] know cuz I fought that fight
[28:17] and weeping may endure for the night,
[28:23] [Music]
[28:25] but it's almost morning.

[29:14] [Music]
[29:15] I can relate with you.
[29:20] And I have prayed to see the sun break
[29:24] free while the storm was still inside.
[29:29] So when your darkness
[29:32] consumes the guiding
[29:35] light,
[29:38] remember

[31:13] [Applause]
[31:32] [Music]
[31:39] Well, aren't you glad it's almost
[31:40] morning?
[31:42] Sometimes I look around and I see the
[31:44] world, the condition it's in. It makes
[31:46] me want to go on home. Sing this old
[31:48] song with me.
[31:51] Somewhere just across the Jordan River
[32:00] is a place of everlasting
[32:05] joy and peace.
[32:08] [Music]
[32:10] where the tree of life is moving there
[32:16] forever.

[32:26] there for me.
[32:28] Sing it with me. That sounds like home
[32:33] to me.
[32:35] Like where I want to be.
[32:40] There'll be no tears
[32:44] to fear lies again.
[32:51] The hills will let go with the story.
[32:57] As we sing of his grace and glory,
[33:02] where the saints of God will be, there
[33:08] sounds like home to me.
[33:12] [Music]
[33:12] [Applause]
[33:15] They say there's mages there
[33:20] inside the city.
[33:25] A crystal river blows right by the tree
[33:31] of life.
[33:35] There no pain,
[33:38] no disappointments
[33:41] can hurt us.
[33:44] is the best part. And Jesus
[33:48] Christ himself
[33:51] will be the light.

[35:20] Love Brother Terry Tidwell. Now, I know
[35:21] a lot of you going to ask me after

[35:26] Linda Ardell to sing? Well, I tried and
[35:29] she's a a poor voice this morning, she
[35:33] said. But she did say that the next time
[35:35] she came through, the Lord willing,
[35:37] she'd give us at least two songs. So,
[35:39] we're going to hold her to that. Amen.
[35:41] Let's stand to our feet this morning.
[35:43] But Joe's going to come bring us the
[35:45] word of the Lord. We certainly want to
[35:47] pray that the Lord just be with our
[35:48] brother and give him words that would
[35:51] feed our soul and give us exactly what
[35:53] we have need of. Amen.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Let's sing a little course this morning.
[36:00] It won't be long.
[36:02] Will you let
[36:04] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that? It won't
[36:05] be long.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; It won't be long.
[36:10] [Music]
[36:14] We'll soon be leaving
[36:18] here.
[36:20] [Music]
[36:21] It won't be long.
[36:28] We'll be going home.
[36:34] No, it won't be long.
[36:39] No, it won't be long till you leave
[36:45] here.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; It won't be long.
[36:51] [Music]
[36:56] We'll be going home.
[37:00] [Music]
[37:02] Count the years as months.
[37:07] Say it to him, church. Count the months
[37:11] as we
[37:14] [Music]
[37:16] count the weeks as days.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Oh yes,
[37:22] &gt;&gt; we'll be going home.
[37:28] Oh, now it won't be long.
[37:33] No, it won't be long.
[37:36] We'll soon be leaving.
[37:40] We're going home.
[37:43] It won't be long.
[37:47] It won't be long.
[37:50] every
[37:52] home
[37:54] [Music]
[37:56] and we shall be like him.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. How many you believe him with
[38:02] all your heart?
[38:03] &gt;&gt; We shall be like him.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; When he comes,
[38:10] we shall be like him. Any day now
[38:17] we'll be going home.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; No,
[38:24] it won't be long,
[38:27] church. It won't be long. We'll soon be
[38:32] leaving
[38:34] here.
[38:37] It won't be long.
[38:41] No, it won't be long.
[38:44] We'll be going home.
[38:50] Oh, it won't be long.
[38:54] No, it won't be long.
[38:58] We'll soon leave
[39:01] here.
[39:05] It won't be long.
[39:09] [Music]
[39:12] We'll be going home.
[39:20] Amen. Pray that's what we're all longing
[39:23] for.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; You know that it's what we're going to
[39:27] talk about this morning is is the way.
[39:30] This place that you we've longed for.
[39:33] God's made a provided way for that this
[39:36] morning. So,
[39:39] if you have your Bibles, you'll turn
[39:40] into the scriptures with me to John 14.
[39:44] It's good to see everybody this morning.
[39:46] It's good to see Brother Ken and Sister
[39:47] Linda. They're like family and brother
[39:51] Terry and Sister Vicki. Brother Terry's
[39:53] probably been one of my best encouragers
[39:56] and supporters since I've started
[39:58] ministering. And um it's it's been a
[40:01] real, you know, struggle sometimes to,
[40:05] you know, feel like you're doing what
[40:07] helping people or doing the what God
[40:09] called you to do. And then you get
[40:11] people like brother Terry just encourage
[40:13] you all the time. And brother Terry, I I
[40:15] appreciate it. So
[40:18] hopefully we give you something this
[40:21] morning that'll be a blessing to you.
[40:22] And nothing new, simple as always. But
[40:26] you know, the Lord put this on my heart
[40:28] in back in July and I've studied all
[40:30] week on it and I've been told several
[40:33] times in my mind that it ain't going to
[40:36] go over good. So
[40:38] &gt;&gt; I'm hoping it does.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; It will.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; So if you read your open your Bibles
[40:44] there, John 14 1-7.
[40:48] Let not your heart be troubled.
[40:51] You believe in God, believe also in me.
[40:56] In my father's house are many mansions.
[40:57] If it were not so, I would have told
[40:59] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[41:03] And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[41:06] I will come again and receive you unto
[41:07] myself, that where I am, there you may
[41:10] be also. And whether I go, ye know, and
[41:14] the way you know. And Thomas said unto
[41:17] him,"Lord, we know not whether thou
[41:19] goest, and how can we know the way?" And
[41:23] Jesus said unto him, "I am the way,
[41:27] the truth, and the life. No man cometh
[41:31] unto the Father but by me." Let's pray.
[41:35] Heavenly Father, we're so grateful,
[41:37] Lord, that you've met us here this
[41:38] morning, Lord. We feel your presence
[41:40] here this morning, Lord. And Lord, we we
[41:43] don't want to grieve that away, Lord. We
[41:46] don't want to do anything, Father, that
[41:47] would grieve the Holy Spirit, Lord, that
[41:49] would, as your prophet said, send him
[41:51] off somewhere to to sit on a a limb or
[41:54] wait for us to make it right. Lord, we
[41:56] want our lives checked up with the word,
[41:58] Lord. We want to lay everything aside,
[42:00] Father, that we can receive. Lord, you
[42:02] know every need here. Lord, if every
[42:05] need in here was different, Lord, you
[42:06] can still bring one message and meet
[42:09] every single need. Father, that's that's
[42:11] how great you are.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, they haven't come here to hear me
[42:14] this morning, Father. They've come in
[42:15] need and and I can't meet one single
[42:17] need here this morning, Father, but you
[42:19] can. I pray that you would set me aside,
[42:21] Lord, cuz Lord, if you don't, I'm going
[42:23] to stand up here and make a mess of
[42:24] this. But Lord, you said that where two
[42:27] or three are gathered in my name, there
[42:29] I would be in the midst, Lord. And
[42:30] that's what we're counting on this
[42:32] morning, Lord. That we could all get out
[42:34] of the way. You could have preeminence.
[42:36] you can walk up and down these aisles,
[42:37] Lord, and touch hearts and touch lives.
[42:39] We're believing you for that. We thank
[42:41] you for it and we welcome you in Jesus
[42:43] name. Amen. God bless you.
[42:48] We're going to read that in also in
[42:50] Matthew 7. Thank you, buddy.
[42:56] 13 and 14.
[43:00] Enter ye in at the straight gate. For
[43:02] wide is the gate, and broad is the way
[43:04] that leadth to destruction, and many
[43:06] there be which go in there,
[43:10] because the straight is the gate, and
[43:12] narrow is the way which leadth unto
[43:14] life, and few there be that find it. And
[43:16] I want to read in the token what brother
[43:18] Brandham says in the token. Israel's
[43:20] slain lamb was was God's requirement.
[43:23] Jehovah required a slain lamb, an
[43:25] innocent substitute. As we've been
[43:27] through in the week gone by, that God
[43:29] when he makes a decision, he never
[43:30] changes it. And he made a way. His first
[43:34] thing that he did when man had fallen,
[43:36] he made a way for him
[43:39] uh back. If he never wanted to redeem
[43:40] him, he made a decision that saved man
[43:42] by the blood of an innocent one. And he
[43:45] has forever done the same thing. He has
[43:48] never changed it. No place will God ever
[43:51] meet any worshipper only under the
[43:54] blood. That's his only place. And what I
[43:56] want to title this this morning is the
[43:59] journey back to fellowship. And we we we
[44:02] look at this, you know, and and
[44:04] we know that God has made a way back. So
[44:06] if God made a way back, there had to be
[44:08] something to go back to. We see we say
[44:10] he made a way back to for for Adam and
[44:12] he made a way back for for mankind. And
[44:15] we look that and but when we look at
[44:17] that and we look at proverbs, you know,
[44:19] in Proverbs um 14:12, it says there's a
[44:22] way that seemth right unto a man that
[44:25] seemth right.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; But he says at the end thereof is the
[44:29] ways of death. So that is the age we're
[44:31] living in. We we we have people that are
[44:33] are going their way because it seems
[44:36] right.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; But it's not the way.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Proverbs says this is a way. It seems
[44:43] right. and and the people, you know, you
[44:45] you you see it even the message. We can
[44:46] say you see it in the denominations. We
[44:48] got so many denominations. Why do we
[44:50] have denominations? Because it seemed
[44:52] right.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; It seemed the way.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; You can't tell these people that they're
[44:57] not sincere in what they believe in. You
[44:59] can't tell these people they're not
[45:00] going to heaven.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; They and in their hearts and their
[45:03] minds, they they feel like they have
[45:04] found the way,
[45:08] &gt;&gt; but the end thereof is death.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Let's bring it on down to the message.
[45:14] They have found a way
[45:16] that seems right.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; It seems right to stay home and push
[45:22] play.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; It seems right to stay home and stream
[45:27] because you worked hard.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; It seems right.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; It's convenient.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Man is always looking for convenience.
[45:38] always looking for for a way to do
[45:40] something that that is convenient for
[45:43] them. That's that's why people live the
[45:45] way they want to believe. They we don't
[45:46] need a prophet nowadays. We we don't we
[45:48] don't need a pastor nowadays. We don't
[45:50] need a way. It's convenient for their
[45:51] life.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; They want a message. They they want a a
[45:54] church and a message and a pastor that
[45:56] will give them what fits their life.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; And it all leads to death.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; It leads to death. This is not the way.
[46:05] Brother Brandham said in the Bible says
[46:06] that God gave one provided way, one and
[46:09] one only.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said in a provided way of
[46:15] approach to fellowship. As soon as man
[46:18] falls, finds that he has fallen,
[46:22] he tries to make himself a way to
[46:26] approach God. Amen.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; In other words, I want to make myself
[46:33] feel good for what I've done wrong.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; They're looking for for peace. They're
[46:38] looking for for something to confirm
[46:41] them that to validate them that even
[46:43] though you're living wrong, I want to be
[46:45] validated that this is not so wrong.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; We we've heard the prophet talking about
[46:50] searing your conscience. People do it so
[46:52] long. They do it so many so many times
[46:56] after they the Satan convinces them over
[46:58] and over you're in the right way. You're
[47:01] you're doing it right
[47:03] &gt;&gt; and they it sears their conscience and
[47:05] and it's no longer there. You can no
[47:08] longer convince them they are going
[47:09] wrong
[47:10] &gt;&gt; because their conscience has been
[47:12] seared,
[47:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:15] &gt;&gt; I don't want I I do not know man no
[47:18] harm, but I feel I'm just about as good
[47:21] as the other man. I keep the golden
[47:23] rule. That wasn't God's program. In
[47:26] order to restore fellowship again, God
[47:28] made a provision right there in the
[47:31] garden that if there would be any other
[47:33] provision better, God would have made
[47:34] it.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; If God said, brother B said, if God said
[47:38] there was something better than this
[47:39] way, what was his way? Something had to
[47:41] die.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Something had to die. An innocent life.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; That was God's provided way. That's why
[47:50] you're all here today. That's why you're
[47:51] filled with the Holy Ghost because you
[47:53] came God's provided way. You accepted
[47:55] the blood of an innocent one.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; This was God's way.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; But God made the other provision, the
[48:06] only basis of restoration to that
[48:08] blessed eternal fellowship that was
[48:10] through the blood of an innocent victim.
[48:11] God made a way back to fellowship.
[48:16] But you have to understand what how God
[48:18] is looking at Adam and Eve in the
[48:20] garden.
[48:22] God's way
[48:24] came about because God had a conditional
[48:26] covenant with Adam and Eve,
[48:30] &gt;&gt; a conditional covenant. This had
[48:31] conditions.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Just like you as parents tell on your
[48:35] you tell your kids, if you do this, I'm
[48:37] going to do this.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ground you. I'm going to do
[48:42] this. I'm going to take this from you.
[48:44] Whipping never worked for my kids. You
[48:47] take their cell phone from them or their
[48:48] video games. They begged you for a
[48:50] whooping.
[48:52] That's when you know it's working.
[48:55] Yes, I did. I did spank my kids a time
[48:57] or two.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; But he told tells Adam and Eve, "This is
[49:02] conditional. If you eat thereof that day
[49:04] you die,
[49:06] &gt;&gt; something had to die. God had to make a
[49:09] provision. If it had not been for you,
[49:12] where where would we be today if God had
[49:14] not made a way of grace for you and I?
[49:16] If you could sit and think of everything
[49:18] you've done, everything in your life,
[49:21] so many things you're ashamed of, if God
[49:24] hadn't made a way of grace, if God
[49:27] hadn't made a provision for you to take
[49:29] that which you had done and placed it on
[49:32] somebody else.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Well, where did he place it? He placed
[49:36] it on the way.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; It's no longer yours.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; It's not yours.
[49:44] That thing you keep reminding yourself
[49:46] of all the time.
[49:48] That thing, Lord, you you repent for it
[49:50] all the time. You repent. Lord, forgive
[49:52] me for this. Forgive me for doing that.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Why are you doing that?
[50:00] &gt;&gt; It's no longer yours.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; It was placed in the way.
[50:07] He was placed and we'll get to in a
[50:10] minute, but if you read the word way in
[50:11] there, the Greek word means one of the
[50:14] words is journey. God became the
[50:18] journey.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the way. I am the
[50:26] highway and I am the journey."
[50:30] &gt;&gt; You're not making this journey.
[50:33] This ain't you.
[50:36] You could never make it.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "But I am the journey.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; I'm making the journey for you."
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Our minds can't comprehend.
[50:50] There was no way that we would be able
[50:52] to live under God with a conditional
[50:55] covenant.
[50:57] So when he makes this, brother Brandon
[50:59] said he makes this unconditional
[51:00] covenant with Abraham. He tells Abraham
[51:03] this includes your royal seed.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Which is you.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; That's you.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; You didn't find the way because God said
[51:16] my condition with you, my my covenant
[51:19] with you is unconditional. The way found
[51:21] you.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; You didn't find the way. You had nothing
[51:24] to do with it.
[51:26] You was happy doing whatever you were
[51:28] doing.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; But the way came across you cuz it's
[51:35] there was something inside of you. You
[51:36] didn't know it. There was something
[51:38] inside of you trying to get back to what
[51:40] you were in in the thoughts of God.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said you were in the thought
[51:44] of God before the foundation of the
[51:45] world. That's what makes you a part of
[51:47] God.
[51:49] Can you you imagine you have a thought
[51:52] and you go out here you think well
[51:53] that's a part of me cuz I thought that
[51:56] our minds can't comprehend that but God
[51:57] says if you were ever in my mind for one
[52:00] split second you are part of me
[52:03] &gt;&gt; you don't brother Ram said you don't
[52:05] remember it but you were there but
[52:07] there's something in here that deep
[52:08] calling to the deep is pulling you out
[52:11] trying to bring you back
[52:16] &gt;&gt; that's the Hey,
[52:18] this is the way to fellowship.
[52:21] God's provided way
[52:25] &gt;&gt; in uncertain sound. You came from where?
[52:28] You go to where? You came out of
[52:30] eternity. You stepped into a little
[52:32] space called time. You go out of time
[52:36] into eternity.
[52:39] What you are in your soul as you go out,
[52:41] the same you'll be.
[52:44] And Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[52:45] today, and forever. This is the ending
[52:47] of time. There will be no more of one of
[52:50] these days. We come out of eternity.
[52:52] Stepped into a little time space here
[52:54] and stepped out of time, back into
[52:57] eternity. We was before there was a
[53:00] world. Then we come into the world and
[53:01] we go out of the world, back into the
[53:03] unknown to us. It's unknown to us. We we
[53:07] we we have a a seventh day messenger
[53:09] come and tell us where you were before
[53:12] time ever was.
[53:15] If you're only a part of time, you can
[53:17] never go back.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; You can never go back. If you wasn't
[53:22] there before, God took that little slot
[53:24] of eternity and he pushed it out.
[53:28] He pushed it out.
[53:30] When did he push it out? Genesis 1. In
[53:34] the beginning,
[53:36] &gt;&gt; because eternity doesn't have a
[53:37] beginning.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have a day it started. It
[53:41] doesn't have a day it ended.
[53:43] But when God said in the beginning when
[53:45] God said let there be
[53:48] he pushed out a little slot of eternity
[53:51] a little loop as it were and pushed it
[53:53] out and called this time.
[54:00] So we we we look at the 146 John 14:6 I
[54:04] am the way the truth and the life. No
[54:06] man cometh unto the father but by me.
[54:08] It's a way, a traveled road, a journey.
[54:15] Everyone has to come this way.
[54:17] All the prophets had to come this way.
[54:20] All the martyrs had to come this way.
[54:22] We're no exception.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter who you related to,
[54:26] whose church you go to.
[54:29] It matters if you was there before God
[54:33] pushed time out
[54:37] &gt;&gt; because time, you're on two journeys. I
[54:41] shared this with brother Rob a couple
[54:42] weeks ago. You're on two journeys.
[54:45] You're on a journey
[54:47] in life
[54:49] and you're on a journey spiritually.
[54:53] If you're true seed, if you came from
[54:56] eternity,
[54:57] the thought of God at some point in your
[55:00] life, it doesn't matter where you're at.
[55:02] You might not even be here this morning.
[55:05] You may be laying drunk somewhere. But
[55:07] if your true seed of God, them journeys
[55:10] will meet up.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; It's impossible not to.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, when when you
[55:16] recognized this this word was eagle
[55:18] food, you heard from your theophony.
[55:21] What was that? That was them two
[55:22] journeys meeting up in the middle of the
[55:24] way
[55:26] &gt;&gt; and it turns you back on your journey to
[55:29] fellowship with him.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; You you you don't have to wait till you
[55:34] get back to on the other side. When I
[55:37] get to heaven, I get to have fellowship
[55:39] with God. The way brought you to
[55:41] fellowship today,
[55:43] &gt;&gt; right now.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had to come
[55:50] this way.
[55:53] though they went under the the to the
[55:55] grave under the the the blood of bulls
[55:58] and goats. That didn't give them eternal
[56:00] life. The the blood of bulls and goats
[56:02] didn't bring them back to God.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; It covered their humanity, their sins
[56:08] that they committed for that time.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; There still had to be a way come for
[56:15] them.
[56:18] Last night, the other other night, I was
[56:20] I was praying because I was battling for
[56:22] for like Monday and Tuesday. I've been
[56:25] studying this and I was really battling
[56:26] it. This is just not going to go over.
[56:28] Lord, just
[56:30] help me. And I know that's the devil. I
[56:33] I I do. and and and I was praying, Lord,
[56:37] help me
[56:39] give me something Wednesday when I go to
[56:41] Wednesday to give me confirmation that
[56:43] this and brother Donnie preached all
[56:45] over some of this and that just settled
[56:48] in my heart. But the things he was
[56:50] talking
[56:51] about there and when he started talking
[56:53] about the the the journey through time
[56:56] and and all that and he started talking
[56:58] about Paul's day and Luther's day and
[57:00] and how things dropped out of eternity
[57:03] into time and I got to thinking about
[57:06] that, you know, he and brother Donnie
[57:07] was talking about how everything didn't
[57:09] drop in in that Paul in Paul's day.
[57:12] Seven seals didn't drop into Paul's day.
[57:15] No,
[57:17] &gt;&gt; what did what what what did he gave? He
[57:19] dropped eternal faith and strength for
[57:21] the for the the people of that day in
[57:24] the in the first church age. God takes
[57:26] it out of out of time. I mean out of
[57:28] eternity and and drops faith, God's
[57:30] faith, God's strength, God's power
[57:33] because what was getting ready to
[57:34] happen? They were getting ready to be
[57:35] martyed. They're getting ready to be
[57:37] hunted and killed for what they believe
[57:38] in. And God drops faith in their in out
[57:41] of eternity into time.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:45] When we look at this journey, each
[57:47] church age, God drops a little bit more
[57:49] of himself, which is his word. God is
[57:52] his word. He drops it out of t out of
[57:54] eternity down into time.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; John West Luther's, he drops
[58:01] sanctification out of eternity and put
[58:03] it into time.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; The just shall live by faith.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Sanctification hadn't come yet.
[58:13] John Wesley comes along. God drops
[58:17] sanctification from eternity into time.
[58:22] You are cleaned. You are washed by the
[58:24] water of the word.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; As if you never done it.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; But God didn't stop there.
[58:33] In this leodysian church age,
[58:37] he takes a seventh angel messenger, the
[58:40] spirit of Elijah out of eternity
[58:44] and drops it into time.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Because that spirit of Elijah is
[58:51] eternal.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; God gave it different ages. Spirit of
[58:56] Elijah,
[58:58] &gt;&gt; it's eternal.
[59:00] If it wasn't,
[59:02] who knows where we'd be today? The
[59:04] spirit of Elijah, what do you come do?
[59:06] Turn the the hearts of the children back
[59:07] to the fathers.
[59:09] God says, "I'm dropping this out of
[59:11] eternity." And what's going to happen is
[59:13] everything that you got in Paul's day,
[59:15] everything you got in Luther's day,
[59:17] everything you got in Wesley's day, I'm
[59:19] going to tie all those loose ends
[59:21] together. This is the way. In 63, the
[59:25] seals were dropped out of eternity into
[59:28] time. Why? You needed him for the way.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; You needed him for the Can I explain the
[59:33] seven seals? I can't even start.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm not a scholar. I don't know
[59:38] stuff. Stuff that that that I I I feel
[59:40] like I I've got to read and study and
[59:41] then after I read it and study it, I
[59:43] forget it.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; I have to trust when I come up here. I
[59:47] have to trust in him because y'all be
[59:49] getting a mess.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Y'all would just get a total mess
[59:53] &gt;&gt; because I I don't have memory retention.
[59:56] Now, I can remember names and and people
[1:00:01] I I arrested 20 years ago. I don't know
[1:00:04] why I remember junk like that.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; I could see him in Walmart. I arrested
[1:00:08] him 15 years ago.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Why? What benefit is that?
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Have no clue.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to this, I I can't
[1:00:18] remember. But I know what's in here.
[1:00:22] And that's that's the deal with God says
[1:00:24] it ain't if you understand it. Do you
[1:00:26] believe it? Brother Donnie preached that
[1:00:29] here a few weeks ago. It's not about you
[1:00:31] got to understand every little word,
[1:00:33] everything that said it's all the
[1:00:34] knowledge you get. Do you believe it? Do
[1:00:36] you have the spirit to believe that
[1:00:38] you're in the way?
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Paul's saying, "I've been on a journey.
[1:00:50] I fought the fight. I fought the a good
[1:00:53] fight. I have finished my course. Paul
[1:00:56] finished his course. We're You're on a
[1:00:58] course.
[1:01:00] That's the term that used a course. This
[1:01:02] is this is a way. This is a direction.
[1:01:04] This is something you have to plug a GPS
[1:01:06] into
[1:01:08] right here. You got a GPS.
[1:01:12] And the and and the pastor that stands
[1:01:14] up here is not a woman with a British
[1:01:16] accent,
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; but he's still telling you directions.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; You go here, when you get up here, you
[1:01:22] take a left turn. And when you go this
[1:01:24] way for about three or four years, you
[1:01:26] take a right turn.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Why? It's directions on the way. God's
[1:01:31] not going to put you on the way and not
[1:01:33] tell you how to go.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; He's not going to put you in a certain
[1:01:36] place and not explain to you this is
[1:01:38] what I need to go. But what he's going
[1:01:40] to say, what is God's directions for you
[1:01:41] and me on this way?
[1:01:44] Follow me.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Let me do it for you.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Don't get out ahead. There's so we we
[1:01:50] get in so much trouble all the time
[1:01:52] because we get so far ahead of God. We
[1:01:54] we we feel like we we need to help God.
[1:01:57] How many's ever helped God before?
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Oh man, I help him so many times. He
[1:02:01] ain't thank me one time.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; I help him all the time.
[1:02:06] And whenever I help him, I end up
[1:02:08] redoing what I had to wanted him to do
[1:02:10] for me.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; That's just the nature, a human nature.
[1:02:14] I can do it. I can do it. I remember so
[1:02:17] many times I've asked God, "God, would
[1:02:19] you fix this? Would you do this? Would
[1:02:20] you do this? And if it ain't done by the
[1:02:22] end of the day, I got this. I don't know
[1:02:26] why I bothered you, God. I've got this."
[1:02:29] That ain't the way God works. God, when
[1:02:31] when you have a need, God says, "You lay
[1:02:34] it down. You give it to me.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; You You can't trust yourself with your
[1:02:40] own needs.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; We You You can't trust humanity. Why did
[1:02:44] Why Why did you have to be filled with
[1:02:45] the Holy Ghost? Because you can't trust
[1:02:48] yourself.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; I can't anyway.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; But look at Paul's journey. We look at
[1:02:58] Paul says, "I have finished my course.
[1:02:59] I' I've fought a good fight." But yet
[1:03:01] when we look at the back end of Paul's
[1:03:03] life
[1:03:05] through human eyes, you say, "No, Paul,
[1:03:07] you you didn't fight a good fight. You
[1:03:10] were killing God's people. You were
[1:03:12] prosecuting them." How could you say
[1:03:15] that? The way found him.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; The the way found him on the road to
[1:03:21] Damascus, the sinful life that he was
[1:03:23] living and his eternal life met up.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; they met up. That was the point of
[1:03:29] intersection for Paul. We and we're all
[1:03:32] going to have it
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; if you're a seed. But that's where Paul
[1:03:37] his his journey through life the time
[1:03:41] and his journey to eternity met up on
[1:03:44] the road to Damascus.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; So why did why does Paul refer to this
[1:03:49] as a fight?
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; If Jesus is the way, this should be so
[1:03:54] easy. He said let there be and a big
[1:03:57] world came.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; He said let he healed cancer.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Why is this so so hard? It's the
[1:04:07] way
[1:04:09] why why did he have to fight?
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; I want to go I'm going to jump. Let me
[1:04:15] read this quote. Now in the beginning
[1:04:18] Christ identified the same in all
[1:04:19] generations. That's when time started
[1:04:21] when eternity broke into time. Now after
[1:04:23] a while time comes back into eternity.
[1:04:25] Of course time is eternity too. It's a
[1:04:28] but time is aotted space.
[1:04:31] That's the way
[1:04:33] only thing we know is inches and yards
[1:04:35] and miles and figures but that's nothing
[1:04:37] to God. He don't have no time.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; So we look at I want to I want to look
[1:04:45] at the I'm going to jump ahead and then
[1:04:47] I'm going to jump back if you'll give me
[1:04:48] a minute.
[1:04:52] But Jesus tells tells them narrow
[1:04:56] is the way.
[1:04:59] Narrow.
[1:05:01] We're we're thinking it's just real. We
[1:05:04] got to turn sideways to get into it.
[1:05:06] That ain't what Jesus mean. Go look up
[1:05:08] the word narrow. Means distressed. It's
[1:05:11] hard. It's tough.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; It's a fight.
[1:05:17] Amen. Th
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; this way is not easy. Why did he say few
[1:05:22] there be that find it?
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Few there be.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; It's it's narrow. You've got to fight.
[1:05:28] You look at the things that you go
[1:05:29] through in your life. You wake up in a
[1:05:32] battle. You go through the day in a
[1:05:34] battle.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; You come home and lay down in a battle.
[1:05:37] Everywhere you go, it's a battle. It's
[1:05:39] either getting on you, it's getting on
[1:05:40] your wife, getting on your kids, and
[1:05:42] it's it's always something.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're seed. You're not
[1:05:47] going to be without those days. You're
[1:05:48] not exempt. You're you're not exempt
[1:05:51] from a fight.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; You're you're not exempt from hard
[1:05:54] times. You're not exempt from from
[1:05:56] mistakes. You're not exempt from from
[1:05:58] failures.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; But one thing that should be reassuring
[1:06:02] to you is while you make them mistakes,
[1:06:04] make them failures. You're in the way.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; You're on your way back to fellowship
[1:06:09] with him with God. And then the way is
[1:06:11] the only thing that will bring you
[1:06:12] there. Yeah.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; And Satan wants you to focus on those
[1:06:16] things. That's why he wants you to
[1:06:17] stumble. He knows where you're at.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; He knows what you believe.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; He watches your life. He knows it needs
[1:06:26] you living it.
[1:06:37] So man has always wanted a way back to
[1:06:39] God,
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; but they've wanted to set their own
[1:06:41] journey.
[1:06:43] This started with Cain,
[1:06:47] right?
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Cain found his own way. He found a way
[1:06:52] that seemed as right.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; How many knows why Cain and Abel were
[1:07:00] making sacrifices? I'll read a quote
[1:07:01] that I never saw before. Maybe y'all
[1:07:03] have
[1:07:05] why they were making sacrifices.
[1:07:08] Brother Bram said Abel had a revelation
[1:07:10] that it required blood. But what was he
[1:07:13] given this sacrifice for? Why was he
[1:07:15] sacrificing?
[1:07:20] Just as Cain and Abel, they also came
[1:07:22] together in a clash. Them being
[1:07:24] brothers, both of them of the same
[1:07:25] mother Eve. We found out they realized
[1:07:28] that they were mortal.
[1:07:30] They realized it.
[1:07:33] We're just human beings.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:36] and they had been put out of life, out
[1:07:39] of the garden of life, and they were
[1:07:41] both trying to find a way to get back in
[1:07:44] there.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; There was something in there that they
[1:07:51] wanted.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; That's the same desire God placed in you
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; that makes you want to get back in
[1:07:59] there.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; What are you offering?
[1:08:05] Are you offering a way that seemth right
[1:08:08] or are you taking the way with all the
[1:08:10] hardships, the trials,
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; the faults, the failures?
[1:08:16] Are you taken that way?
[1:08:24] Brother Bram tells us in fellowship of
[1:08:26] 56. It's not up there, brother. But but
[1:08:28] God turned and saw his children leaving
[1:08:31] the garden and he couldn't stand it.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; This hurt God.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; God God didn't didn't cast him out. Say,
[1:08:41] "Okay, y'all get out. I'm going to make
[1:08:43] a better way.
[1:08:45] I'm I'm going to make a way. This is
[1:08:47] just all part of my plan." God loved
[1:08:49] them. Yeah,
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; God hat God loved the fellowship that he
[1:08:53] had with them.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; This this this was was was God's own
[1:08:58] creation that that he spoke over and now
[1:09:01] they're leaving the garden.
[1:09:04] And God goes on a journey
[1:09:08] to become the journey.
[1:09:11] We look at man leaving the garden and
[1:09:12] and when man leaves the garden, he goes
[1:09:14] on a journey himself further and further
[1:09:17] into sin.
[1:09:21] If you haven't got the hints by now,
[1:09:23] you're on a journey.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; There's not a single person in here
[1:09:27] that's not on a journey.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; You're on a journey to something.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; You're on a journey to one of two
[1:09:34] places.
[1:09:36] And it depends on on your desire.
[1:09:39] Depends on you what's in here.
[1:09:43] So we we look at that God cast him out
[1:09:45] of the garden and and and and we now he
[1:09:48] he offered a substitute for their for
[1:09:50] their sin and and innocent blood and he
[1:09:52] cast him out of the garden and and
[1:09:54] humankind
[1:09:56] mankind goes on a journey.
[1:10:01] And as God watches them on this journey,
[1:10:03] they're getting further and further away
[1:10:05] from God.
[1:10:06] We follow Cain's seed through the Bible
[1:10:08] and and how how the and we even look
[1:10:11] into the children of Israel as they we
[1:10:12] we'll get on that in a minute how they
[1:10:14] got further away from God and and re
[1:10:17] read when you read the Old Testament.
[1:10:19] This king did evil inside of the Lord
[1:10:20] and this king ways were evil and man got
[1:10:24] further and further and further away
[1:10:26] from God. But God's journey never
[1:10:28] stopped.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; God went on a journey to make a way
[1:10:32] back.
[1:10:34] That's what God's desire was was to make
[1:10:36] a way back for man.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; That's God's desire for you to make a
[1:10:41] way back
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Even when you fall, you make mistakes.
[1:10:47] We get cold every we all get cold and
[1:10:49] indifferent in our walk
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; because sometimes we we find ourselves
[1:10:54] leaning on this life journey a little
[1:10:56] more than we do on this eternal journey.
[1:10:59] Yeah,
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; but there had to be a way. And God goes
[1:11:04] on a journey
[1:11:07] because God's greatest desire,
[1:11:10] God had one desire to go on this
[1:11:13] journey.
[1:11:15] Bring man back to fellowship.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; That's God. That's all that's God's ever
[1:11:20] asked from us. That's all that God's
[1:11:22] ever ever ever ever wanted from you.
[1:11:25] Fellowship.
[1:11:27] Now, that is so deep.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; I don't know how we get a recipe for
[1:11:34] that. How we we get a something drawn up
[1:11:37] to how we find what God wants. It's so
[1:11:41] simple. You've missed it.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; God's way that he that he prepared for
[1:11:50] you was back to fellowship.
[1:11:54] He wants to talk to you. He wants to
[1:11:56] spend time with you.
[1:11:59] Sometimes we we do all the talking.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, I found the way. Now I can find out
[1:12:04] everything. I I can I can give him
[1:12:06] everything I need. I have need of this.
[1:12:08] I need a better job. I need more money.
[1:12:10] I need my bills paid. I need healed. All
[1:12:12] those things are good.
[1:12:15] But do we ever let him talk to us?
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; You know, when I was studying this and
[1:12:20] and brother Harry sings that song, stay.
[1:12:23] I don't want you to go.
[1:12:26] When I was studying this, I brother got
[1:12:28] to thinking, does God ever say that to
[1:12:29] us?
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; We we say to God, "God, please stay.
[1:12:34] Don't go.
[1:12:36] Don't leave. I want to worship you a
[1:12:38] little longer.
[1:12:40] I Does God ever say it to us?"
[1:12:45] Does God whenever the minister's done
[1:12:46] and you want to get up and go, you got
[1:12:48] things to do and God just fed you from
[1:12:51] heaven.
[1:12:53] He gave you words of life.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; And you got to hurry and get out.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; He provided a way.
[1:13:04] He's provided a way from the worst thing
[1:13:06] that's ever going to come on this earth.
[1:13:10] This world hasn't seen anything yet.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; And God provided you a way of escaping.
[1:13:16] You got to hurry up and go make sure you
[1:13:18] don't miss kickoff.
[1:13:23] You got things you got to do.
[1:13:26] My shoulder hurts. I don't feel like
[1:13:27] raising my hand. How did his feel?
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; He raised his for you.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; And he was the way.
[1:13:38] This is the way that he prepared for
[1:13:40] you.
[1:13:41] And it hurt a little bit.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Bible says he was in agony. So much
[1:13:48] grief, so much pain. His
[1:13:53] sweat was his drops of blood.
[1:13:59] It's the way
[1:14:02] it ain't It ain't easy. It It It ain't
[1:14:05] attractive. It ain't cool.
[1:14:09] But it's his way.
[1:14:11] It is for a short season.
[1:14:14] You know, I was I was sitting this and
[1:14:16] Jennifer had played the song a few weeks
[1:14:19] ago. Tommy Bates singing, "Heaven will
[1:14:22] be worth the journey when I get home."
[1:14:25] You could take one little just eternity.
[1:14:29] Think of eternity. But Ram says, "You
[1:14:32] you would praise him for for millions of
[1:14:35] years." And he said, "And it's like time
[1:14:38] never moved."
[1:14:40] Time never moved.
[1:14:46] We think of that.
[1:14:48] Look at the journey. You you you look at
[1:14:51] your mistakes. You look at your failures
[1:14:53] and you you get so down and depressed.
[1:14:56] You think nobody likes you.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; You want to move away because these
[1:15:01] people don't like you.
[1:15:04] That little portion of nobody liking you
[1:15:07] is only just a little few seconds
[1:15:09] compared to the time you'll spend with
[1:15:11] him.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; If nobody likes you, so what? Amen.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; He does.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; If people are talking about you and
[1:15:23] things you've done this and that ever,
[1:15:25] who cares?
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Who cares?
[1:15:32] It's only a short
[1:15:35] a short short time
[1:15:39] compared to what you're earning for it.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Is it not worth it? Amen.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; You don't want to be around God's saints
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; because somebody in the church don't
[1:15:50] like you. I I don't know why I'm going
[1:15:51] this way.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; You don't want to fellowship with the
[1:15:56] same people. Believe it or not, you are
[1:15:58] in God's mind with them.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; You were with them. You fellowshipped
[1:16:04] with them in God's mind.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; And God just pushed out a little slot of
[1:16:09] time.
[1:16:11] just a little slot of time
[1:16:15] and put you together in that as well.
[1:16:21] But you don't like them now.
[1:16:26] Help us people.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; you if you can look at the world
[1:16:33] that we're living in, I've had people
[1:16:35] that don't even go to church tell me
[1:16:37] time's about over.
[1:16:41] How much more should we see it that we
[1:16:43] already have our sights on eternity?
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; We see it unfolding.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; You've had you've had a 7th day
[1:16:50] messenger come down here and tell you in
[1:16:52] 65. I don't know how it can get much
[1:16:54] worse.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; But you've been placed in the way.
[1:17:02] You've been placed on a journey. And he
[1:17:04] says, "I'll be your journey.
[1:17:06] Forget about people not liking you.
[1:17:08] Forget about people talking about you.
[1:17:09] Forget about your faults and mis
[1:17:12] mistakes. Those are mine. I take them
[1:17:13] from you.
[1:17:16] Stay in the way. This is the only way
[1:17:18] you'll journey back to fellowship.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; This is God's journey. God goes on a
[1:17:26] journey.
[1:17:28] The only way for God to bring man back
[1:17:30] to fellowship was for God himself
[1:17:33] to step into that little loop of time
[1:17:36] that he pushed out.
[1:17:39] He pushed this this little loop of time
[1:17:41] out
[1:17:43] and God himself steps into it. Brother
[1:17:45] Jackie,
[1:17:46] he stepped into time.
[1:17:50] He had people talk about him. He had
[1:17:52] people make fun of him.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; So anything that you go through on your
[1:17:59] journey through time,
[1:18:02] he's been there.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; He's done it.
[1:18:10] But Brandham said in sign 62, he knows
[1:18:13] that he came from somewhere,
[1:18:15] but he wants to find his way back.
[1:18:19] Adam really expressed that the first man
[1:18:21] on the earth after finding that he had
[1:18:23] fallen from grace. He tried to take his
[1:18:25] own intelligence
[1:18:27] and make a way back to God without
[1:18:30] atonement.
[1:18:32] That's why we we have people nowadays
[1:18:35] that are thinkers.
[1:18:37] They're thinkers.
[1:18:39] That's why they've left this word.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; They got to thinking about it.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; They got to using this portion that was
[1:18:47] created in time.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Instead of the portion that was in the
[1:18:52] mind of God before the foundation of the
[1:18:53] world.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Why? They probably weren't there.
[1:19:00] They're using the only faculty they have
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; to understand this word. The only
[1:19:05] faculty. If they weren't there, you
[1:19:08] can't understand the mind of God if you
[1:19:10] weren't there.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; And you didn't have a messenger come and
[1:19:14] and when he broke open the seals reveal
[1:19:17] it to you.
[1:19:20] If you weren't there, you're not going
[1:19:21] to get it.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; You're not going to understand it.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; I still don't understand it.
[1:19:27] this does.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Only thing I understand about it that
[1:19:31] it's it's a part of me and I'm a part of
[1:19:33] it.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; And when it goes, I'm going with it.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the the word of God will
[1:19:41] not return to God void.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; When that seven the the revelation, the
[1:19:46] seven seals returns back to God in
[1:19:49] eternity, I'll return with it.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you don't understand
[1:19:53] it." It doesn't matter.
[1:19:55] It doesn't matter
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; what I understand.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; What matters is am I a part of it?
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Is it a part of me?
[1:20:06] Because that's the way.
[1:20:09] Is is the seven seals the way? No.
[1:20:13] No.
[1:20:16] You have to understand him by knowledge.
[1:20:18] No. It's the spirit that gave him the
[1:20:20] way.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; The word of God. when God spoke it.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; I want to jump here.
[1:20:38] Brandon says in the unfailing re
[1:20:40] realities of the living God, this is a
[1:20:42] long quote and I apologize. In 60,
[1:20:45] what can you give?
[1:20:48] God re will receive what you'll give.
[1:20:52] But he wants all of you. If you just
[1:20:54] want to give him a couple minutes in the
[1:20:56] morning when you get up, he'll take it.
[1:20:59] If you want to lay your head down on at
[1:21:01] night on the pillow, and I've been
[1:21:02] guilty. I've been guilty laying my head
[1:21:05] down on the pillow. Lord, thank you for
[1:21:07] a day and before you even say, "Amen,
[1:21:08] you're asleep."
[1:21:10] But guess what? He took it.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; He took it. Anything that you give him,
[1:21:17] he'll take. God is not a God that says,
[1:21:20] "Okay, if if you're not going to give me
[1:21:22] everything, if you're not going to pray
[1:21:24] for me 24 pray with 247, because the
[1:21:27] Bible says pray without ceasing, if
[1:21:29] you're not going to do this, if you're
[1:21:30] not going to talk spiritual all the
[1:21:32] time, all this, I don't want nothing.
[1:21:37] That's not our God."
[1:21:40] Understand this. When when when we look
[1:21:42] at how how God came down and became
[1:21:44] flesh,
[1:21:46] God understands every aspect of your
[1:21:48] life.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; The humanity part, he knows you have
[1:21:52] things to do. He know that there's
[1:21:54] there's hobbies and things that you
[1:21:55] enjoy.
[1:21:57] We need those.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet did it. That's
[1:22:00] why he go hunt and fish and and throw
[1:22:03] football with his boy in the in the
[1:22:05] backyard.
[1:22:06] There's things that you do and God
[1:22:08] understands that.
[1:22:11] It's not all about I I can't get in if I
[1:22:13] don't if if I'm not talking about the
[1:22:15] word all the time.
[1:22:19] He wants every bit of you. He wants all.
[1:22:22] He wants everything you are. He wants
[1:22:24] your life. He wants your testimony. He
[1:22:26] wants every minute you live. He wants
[1:22:28] you to live right, act right, talk
[1:22:29] right, do right. He wants everything
[1:22:31] perfectly surrendered to him that he can
[1:22:33] lead you and guide you and put you into
[1:22:36] places where he wants you to go. led of
[1:22:39] the spirit.
[1:22:41] But people today say, "Now wait a
[1:22:43] minute. If my pastor preaches over 20
[1:22:45] minutes,
[1:22:47] ours does.
[1:22:50] We don't mind."
[1:22:53] Brother Bram says, "I've heard that many
[1:22:55] a time. I've seen good pastors turned
[1:22:58] away from churches because the deacon
[1:22:59] board said, "Look here, Reverend. We
[1:23:01] hired you to come here and we never
[1:23:02] hired you to come here and blast us all
[1:23:04] morning.
[1:23:06] We want we've set the time of 20
[1:23:08] minutes. The bell rings, you better be
[1:23:10] through.
[1:23:11] This is one of my favorite quotes in
[1:23:14] this script in this sermon. I like to
[1:23:17] have a church like that once.
[1:23:20] I'd like to have the privilege to tell
[1:23:21] them what I think about them
[1:23:24] and what the word says about them. Why?
[1:23:26] If it took all day, just keep on
[1:23:28] preaching. Y'all know me. I won't be
[1:23:29] here all day. If it took all day, just
[1:23:32] keep on preaching. God wants a complete
[1:23:34] surrender. Do you believe that God wants
[1:23:37] surrender? How can God show you
[1:23:39] realities before you surrender him to
[1:23:41] him? You've got to surrender.
[1:23:45] We looking at the children of Israel.
[1:23:47] Well, you know, it's it's so typical the
[1:23:49] their the children of Israel's journey
[1:23:51] types so much in in our life in the last
[1:23:54] day that how the God called them out.
[1:23:58] There's so many things about the the
[1:23:59] children of Israel that I don't
[1:24:01] understand.
[1:24:03] This is a God that works sa supernatural
[1:24:06] things in their lives and and and God
[1:24:08] sends them out calls them out of Egypt.
[1:24:10] And look at all all the things when they
[1:24:12] were go how they they watched what God
[1:24:14] did in in Egypt all the way down to the
[1:24:17] firstborn. Supernatural things turn the
[1:24:21] river to blood. All the lice, all the
[1:24:23] flies, the frogs, everything.
[1:24:26] They watch supernatural
[1:24:29] things of God and God calls them out of
[1:24:33] of Egypt and now they're on their way to
[1:24:35] the promised land or on their way.
[1:24:40] The problem was
[1:24:42] they didn't stay in the way God provided
[1:24:46] and they come to the Red Sea and the the
[1:24:48] problem that I have with this brother
[1:24:50] Keith is whenever they they come up to
[1:24:51] the Red Sea, they forgot everything God
[1:24:54] did.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; They forgot it.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Everything. They begin to murmur and
[1:25:02] complain,
[1:25:04] "God's brought us here to die.
[1:25:08] God God's" and And they begin to say,
[1:25:10] "How we long to go back and and take the
[1:25:12] leaks and the garlics of of Egypt?" And
[1:25:14] God sends him on a journey, and he feeds
[1:25:16] them mana and quail all the way their
[1:25:19] entire journey.
[1:25:22] But I want you to understand something,
[1:25:24] and I think I mentioned this at brother
[1:25:25] David Solers's church here a few weeks
[1:25:27] ago.
[1:25:29] Every
[1:25:30] firstborn
[1:25:33] that had the token applied
[1:25:37] never made it in the promised land
[1:25:40] when they put the blood over the
[1:25:41] doorpost
[1:25:44] because God's going to save the
[1:25:46] firstborn.
[1:25:48] The daddy could have been a firstborn.
[1:25:49] The mama could have been a firstborn.
[1:25:50] Could have been a firstborn in all the
[1:25:52] firstborn. Bible says all the firstborn
[1:25:57] and they never went in.
[1:26:00] They never went in the promised land.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Just because you got anointed,
[1:26:06] just because you you felt God move in
[1:26:08] your life and you jumped and you
[1:26:10] screamed and you shouted and you run
[1:26:12] around the church and you spun around
[1:26:13] and you did this all this stuff. Just
[1:26:15] because you did all that mean you're
[1:26:17] that don't mean you have the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:18] What was the promised land? It's type of
[1:26:20] our Holy Ghost today. They had to go
[1:26:22] through the river of Jordan to get to
[1:26:24] the promised land. Who took the promised
[1:26:26] land? The new man.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; The new man.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; God raised up another generation.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; That's the same thing in in your life.
[1:26:36] This new man, this man that makes
[1:26:37] mistakes, don't have the Holy Ghost. You
[1:26:40] repent and turn away to God and you you
[1:26:42] come to the River Jordan as a type and
[1:26:44] get baptized and a new man comes out
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; and receives the promised land. Yeah,
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; that's God's provided way. Why did they,
[1:26:53] you know, and they tell us when you look
[1:26:55] at the map, the journey to to the
[1:26:57] promised land from Egypt was three or
[1:26:59] four days.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Their way of doing things took them 40
[1:27:04] years.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; A lot of the times we we the things that
[1:27:09] we find in our life that are hindering
[1:27:10] us, that are holding us back, is because
[1:27:12] we're going our own way.
[1:27:15] because we we we look at the way that we
[1:27:17] feel like God pulling us to do something
[1:27:18] and we won't do it because we think it's
[1:27:20] too hard.
[1:27:23] I challenge you this morning to accept
[1:27:25] God's way one time. I don't care how how
[1:27:27] hard it is. Accept it one time. He'll
[1:27:30] never put you in a way that he won't
[1:27:31] take you through.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; He never will.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; If God says this is the way I'm going to
[1:27:37] go, he'll lead. He'll go first.
[1:27:45] I'm going to start winding down here.
[1:27:51] When I was studying this,
[1:27:54] you know, I got to thinking, what if
[1:27:58] we're on this journey?
[1:28:01] We're on this journey and we're
[1:28:04] going through our everyday life and all
[1:28:06] of a sudden God pushes pause.
[1:28:10] God pushes pause on everyone's life and
[1:28:14] shines a spotlight on where you're at.
[1:28:19] In other words, look at yourself.
[1:28:22] Makes everybody turn and look at you
[1:28:25] as you on your journey.
[1:28:28] Are you where you feel like you should
[1:28:32] be?
[1:28:35] Are you can you honestly take this word?
[1:28:39] take this message and it line up right
[1:28:41] where you're at.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; God's spotlights on you
[1:28:48] or are you off somewhere?
[1:28:52] Cuz on this way there's Satan has laid a
[1:28:55] lot of little exits.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; He's laid a lot of ways for you to get
[1:28:59] off. And you might, well, I'm on the
[1:29:00] way. I'm still on the way. This, you
[1:29:02] know,
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; have you took a little exit to
[1:29:06] unforgiveness overlook?
[1:29:09] Right? Bitterness bypass. We want to
[1:29:13] call it that.
[1:29:16] If you have hard feelings towards
[1:29:18] somebody or you've gotten cold because
[1:29:20] you you you more the more church you
[1:29:23] miss, the easier it gets.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; You're missing
[1:29:30] or are you coming and you're just not
[1:29:33] eating?
[1:29:35] So this is this this God's spotlight is
[1:29:37] on you this morning. And I if we want to
[1:29:40] call this is a checkup time. Are you
[1:29:42] where you need to be? If God says,
[1:29:44] "Okay, I've pushed pause. Tomorrow I'm
[1:29:47] stopping time. We're going to eternity."
[1:29:51] So if if God says it's time for you to
[1:29:54] return back,
[1:29:58] the only way you're going to return back
[1:29:59] is if you're in the way. In the way, not
[1:30:02] a way.
[1:30:05] So will will he find you ready
[1:30:09] or is there things in your life that you
[1:30:11] need to change first?
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Lord help us.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; You know when you read the scripture and
[1:30:15] it says he's even Jesus told the
[1:30:17] disciples Jesus says I don't even know
[1:30:19] when he's coming back.
[1:30:21] It just amazes me that people can give
[1:30:23] dates on when God's coming back when
[1:30:24] Jesus said I don't even know
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; in the twinkling of an eye. And if you
[1:30:31] say, "Well, I'm going to wait for a
[1:30:33] loved one to come back, and as soon as
[1:30:34] I've seen them, it'll be too late."
[1:30:36] Then,
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; The resurrection is already taking
[1:30:39] place, then it's too late.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; So, we we we look at our lives and we
[1:30:45] think, are we ready? Is is our lives
[1:30:47] checked up and where need to be? That's
[1:30:49] why we come in here on Sunday. That's
[1:30:52] that's why we come in on Wednesday.
[1:30:54] That's why we come to upper room and
[1:30:55] brother Robs on on Monday. That's why we
[1:30:58] come to check up.
[1:31:01] You've got too much going on to go to
[1:31:03] youth service anymore.
[1:31:05] You worked a hard day.
[1:31:08] You're not giving that to me and Brother
[1:31:10] Rob. You're giving that to God.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; They're giving that to each other. As
[1:31:14] much as you've done unto the least of
[1:31:16] these, you've done unto me. There's
[1:31:18] there's some people I don't mean to
[1:31:21] they're my kids. They'll forgive me.
[1:31:24] But then there might be somebody that
[1:31:25] that hasn't been in a long time or it's
[1:31:27] never been and and God has ordained you
[1:31:30] to be there to be a testimony
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; and you decide to go to
[1:31:38] eat Japanese with your friends.
[1:31:42] It's checkup time.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; You know, I I was gotten to I love the
[1:31:48] youth. They know I do.
[1:31:51] They're my heart. I when brother Donnie
[1:31:53] asked me to to do that I I was like I
[1:31:55] don't know how that's going to go but
[1:31:56] now I wouldn't trade it for nothing. I
[1:31:59] would I wouldn't trade it. We you talked
[1:32:01] to brother Rob other even the youth you
[1:32:03] you've seen lives changed in our youth.
[1:32:06] Youth get stronger. Yes. Some fall away
[1:32:09] but guess what? They're coming back. You
[1:32:13] know, I was I want to head down to
[1:32:16] closing here, but I was thinking
[1:32:19] when I was studying this and
[1:32:22] I got to thinking about moms
[1:32:26] with the youth and
[1:32:28] there's nobody that prays for her kid to
[1:32:32] get in the way like a mom does.
[1:32:35] It
[1:32:37] father a father can't don't have that
[1:32:40] that certain special something in here
[1:32:44] like a mom does.
[1:32:46] Why do you think she's called the fifth
[1:32:48] gospel?
[1:32:50] She feeds them.
[1:32:53] When they eat this word, they come in on
[1:32:55] Sunday. They're on their cell phone.
[1:32:57] They're thinking about this, that, and
[1:32:58] the other. But when they go home,
[1:33:02] they got a mom that's living it.
[1:33:07] They got a mom that's in the way.
[1:33:10] And I got to thinking about my mom and
[1:33:12] I, you know, we grew up a home where
[1:33:16] my mom would read us Bible stories and
[1:33:19] stuff. We we didn't we had the tapes
[1:33:21] playing in our home. I could never say
[1:33:23] nothing about the the way my parents
[1:33:25] raised me. I had a mom and dad that
[1:33:27] loved me that took care of us and showed
[1:33:29] us the right way.
[1:33:32] But when I was thinking of this, and I
[1:33:34] hope I can get through this,
[1:33:38] I remember we moved around a lot.
[1:33:43] Some of the schools we went to, we got
[1:33:44] free lunches. Other schools
[1:33:47] we went to, we didn't.
[1:33:51] And my mom, Lord, she'd get up every
[1:33:53] morning, pack us up, feed us breakfast,
[1:33:55] pack our lunch. And we were poor.
[1:33:59] We didn't know we were poor because most
[1:34:00] all her friends were poor.
[1:34:03] As a kid, you don't know you're poor.
[1:34:07] But she'd put our lunch in a little
[1:34:10] brown paper bag
[1:34:12] and I might had a peanut butter and
[1:34:15] jelly sandwich, bologoney sandwich,
[1:34:17] maybe a sandwich bag of chips in it.
[1:34:22] Then I'd go to school and I go sit down
[1:34:23] with my friends. They had these Batman
[1:34:27] lunch boxes and not thermoses with soup
[1:34:29] in it, pudding, cake, brownies,
[1:34:33] bacon, lettuce, tomato sandwiches.
[1:34:37] There were times I didn't even bring my
[1:34:39] bag out.
[1:34:41] I was ashamed.
[1:34:44] My little paper bag.
[1:34:48] I didn't throw it away.
[1:34:51] You know why?
[1:34:53] Cuz my mom packed it.
[1:34:57] I wasn't thrown that way.
[1:35:00] You know where I ate it?
[1:35:04] I was hungry.
[1:35:07] When I got on that bus home,
[1:35:12] I got on that bus home. I opened that
[1:35:13] bag
[1:35:15] and I ate what my mom made me.
[1:35:20] You say, "Brother Joe, what do you
[1:35:22] what's why are you saying that?" Because
[1:35:25] I want to talk to you moms a minute.
[1:35:29] You moms that got kids that ain't here.
[1:35:33] And you're praying for them.
[1:35:39] You have fed them for 19 years.
[1:35:42] You've packed their lunch
[1:35:44] for 19 years.
[1:35:49] It ain't cool where they're at. That
[1:35:52] lunch you packed them don't fit in.
[1:35:57] They just don't fit in. But I'll promise
[1:35:59] you this.
[1:36:03] I promise you, they ain't going to throw
[1:36:05] it away.
[1:36:07] They'll never throw it away.
[1:36:10] They're going to eat it on the way back.
[1:36:13] everything you've packed for them for
[1:36:15] 19, 20, 18 years, it doesn't matter.
[1:36:18] They'll eat it on the way back
[1:36:21] because that food's eternal.
[1:36:24] And if there's something in here
[1:36:27] and that son or daughter of yours that
[1:36:29] is eternal
[1:36:32] is going to get hungry for that,
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; it's going to get hungry.
[1:36:39] You can't throw away God's food.
[1:36:42] That's why you entrusted mothers to pack
[1:36:44] it.
[1:36:48] Let's stand together.
[1:37:02] You know, maybe you've gotten to a place
[1:37:03] where you can't find where you're at in
[1:37:06] your journey.
[1:37:08] You can't find joy in your journey.
[1:37:10] can't find peace.
[1:37:12] You know, you you look at the world
[1:37:14] today and there's so much depression, so
[1:37:16] much anxiety, so much everything. People
[1:37:19] are just, you know, in in in in law
[1:37:21] enforcement. I mean, over over at the
[1:37:23] college, we we we have programs that's
[1:37:25] set up to um
[1:37:29] so many mental health programs,
[1:37:32] students get anxiety and depressed over
[1:37:34] grades and over this and and we've got
[1:37:36] to we've got to help them. We've got to
[1:37:37] seek therapy for them and and all this
[1:37:39] and send them here and send them there.
[1:37:43] It's rampant. The mental battle that
[1:37:46] that we fight is is rampant. And and
[1:37:48] sons and daughters of God, you're you're
[1:37:50] not so you're subject to that as well.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Satan puts that thing in our life, too.
[1:37:57] He puts depression there.
[1:38:00] He brings anxiety and and and bitterness
[1:38:02] and all kinds of things in our in our
[1:38:04] life that we we say we can't deal with
[1:38:06] it. There's there's no more joy.
[1:38:10] God never planned destined this journey
[1:38:13] you're on not to have joy in it.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; He never destined anything we do in our
[1:38:18] life to not have peace.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; There's things that you go through. I
[1:38:23] know many of you have lost loved ones
[1:38:27] and you know only it's it's hard if
[1:38:29] you've never been in your shoes. It's
[1:38:30] it's hard for you to say, "Well, I I
[1:38:33] know what you're going through." You
[1:38:34] can't. But what you could do is pray God
[1:38:36] brings peace upon them because Satan
[1:38:38] will use that. Satan will use the
[1:38:40] humanity to bring them down.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; So how do we get joy when the children
[1:38:47] of Israel come out on the other Red Sea?
[1:38:50] They didn't have joy on this side,
[1:38:52] brother Harry. But when they come
[1:38:54] through on the other side, the joy
[1:38:55] returned.
[1:38:57] What God had wished is they had joy on
[1:38:59] this side.
[1:39:02] When they walked up and seen that Red
[1:39:03] Sea, they should have started rejoicing.
[1:39:06] We know what our God can do.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we are in his way. We're on
[1:39:12] our journey to the promised land. We're
[1:39:14] on our journey back to him. How can you
[1:39:16] not find joy in that? Amen.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; How can you not find peace and comfort
[1:39:20] in that? That that that God is bringing
[1:39:22] you someplace that is eternal.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; But we use our our our little human
[1:39:28] brain sometimes just to focus on the
[1:39:30] things that bother us, the things that
[1:39:32] we're going through. And God says, "I
[1:39:33] want to give you joy." As I've I've said
[1:39:35] it here before, you you when you look at
[1:39:37] Job, the greatest thing that I love
[1:39:40] about Job is when the scripture tells
[1:39:42] tells us that he says,"I know that in
[1:39:44] the I know that he is God and he could
[1:39:46] do all things."
[1:39:48] Job was just like halfway through his
[1:39:50] trial. Then he was still on the ash
[1:39:51] heap. He began to praise God because he
[1:39:55] finally realized God opened his eyes not
[1:39:58] to you're on the ash heap, not that
[1:40:00] you're covered in boils, not that you've
[1:40:02] lost everything. He gave him a re
[1:40:03] revelation that brother Brandham said he
[1:40:05] handed Job his binoculars, God's
[1:40:08] binoculars, and let him look ahead 4,000
[1:40:11] years and he saw Calvary.
[1:40:14] So Job says it doesn't matter what I go
[1:40:16] through here. That's I've gained that.
[1:40:19] That is my redeemer.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; That's my journey back to fellowship.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; I think we we would have more worship.
[1:40:28] We would have more praise. We would have
[1:40:30] more joy.
[1:40:32] If
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; we would look at where we're going
[1:40:34] instead of where we're at.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; If we look at he's the way. I'm not the
[1:40:41] way.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[1:40:48] If you have a need this morning,
[1:40:51] I know I do. I I want to be found in the
[1:40:53] way.
[1:40:54] You say you you say, "Brother Joe, I'm I
[1:40:57] find myself off to one side or the other
[1:41:00] so many times.
[1:41:02] If God's put you in the way, if God has
[1:41:05] ordained you and put you in the way, I
[1:41:08] promise you, you're going to make it
[1:41:09] back to fellowship.
[1:41:11] It's impossible not to.
[1:41:14] But sometimes we we we see these side
[1:41:16] exits so many times in our lives, little
[1:41:18] things that Satan puts in there, and
[1:41:20] maybe you took one of them.
[1:41:23] We know besetting sins is a real thing.
[1:41:25] You've got something in your life that
[1:41:26] you can't get rid of or you're trying to
[1:41:28] get rid of.
[1:41:30] Hold that before the Lord.
[1:41:33] Let's pray.
[1:41:35] Heavenly Father,
[1:41:37] Lord, this morning we want you to be
[1:41:39] able to pause, as it were, our journey
[1:41:43] through life. And if the spotlight was
[1:41:46] to shine upon us, Lord, we would be
[1:41:49] right in the middle in our way to
[1:41:50] eternity,
[1:41:52] centered on the word, Lord, lacking
[1:41:54] nothing. Lord, that's our desire. Lord,
[1:41:58] we know that human frailty so many times
[1:42:00] comes into play and we might slip off
[1:42:02] one side or the other, Lord, but you as
[1:42:04] you lead us as you are the way, you are
[1:42:07] the journey, you pull us back into the
[1:42:08] middle. Lord, touch every life here,
[1:42:12] every heart. Father, if there's someone
[1:42:14] here, Lord, that's that that's slipped
[1:42:17] away and got out of sight of this this
[1:42:19] this journey, Lord, I pray that you
[1:42:21] would pull them back. Lord, we know that
[1:42:24] in in as eternity, Lord, in in in this
[1:42:27] last day of Leo, not only did you drop
[1:42:30] your messenger into this age, Lord, you
[1:42:32] didn't only drop a message that would
[1:42:34] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:42:36] the forefathers, Lord, but you also
[1:42:38] dropped healing in this age. You dropped
[1:42:40] deliverance in this age, Lord. You
[1:42:42] dropped redemption. You dropped
[1:42:43] salvation. You dropped joy and praise
[1:42:45] and worship in this age, Lord. Lord, may
[1:42:48] we reach out and grasp a hold of that,
[1:42:49] Father.
[1:42:51] Lord, may we sing praises, Lord, as we
[1:42:53] return back to eternity. Father, may our
[1:42:57] praise not be lacking. May our worship
[1:42:59] not be lacking, Father, in any way.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Touch each heart, Lord. Touch each
[1:43:05] desire here this morning, Father. I pray
[1:43:07] that you would. How we love you and we
[1:43:09] thank you for it, Lord. Thank you for
[1:43:11] being here this morning, Lord. Thank you
[1:43:12] for helping me, Lord. I know I jumped
[1:43:14] around a lot and missed so much stuff,
[1:43:16] Lord, but your will is always perfect.
[1:43:19] We thank you for it in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:43:23] Amen. Let's let's worship him a little
[1:43:25] bit. Brother Harry, go if you want to
[1:43:26] sing something. If you have a need,
[1:43:28] we'll pray for you. Thank you for being
[1:43:31] so attentive this morning. I really
[1:43:32] appreciate it.
[1:43:34] [Music]

[1:43:42] to be in the presence of

[1:51:19] what brother Joe had to say for us.
[1:51:23] [Applause]
[1:51:29] Let's just sing this song.
[1:51:31] I don't want to say we'll sing it as we
[1:51:33] go because it's hard to leave when it's
[1:51:36] when it feels like this. Let's sing uh
[1:51:40] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[1:51:42] Let's just worship him a little bit.
[1:51:44] We're not going to get to come back
[1:51:46] until Wednesday night. Let's just let it
[1:51:49] sink in for a little bit. Amen.
[1:51:52] When the music fades
[1:51:56] and all is stripped away
[1:52:00] and I simply come,
[1:52:08] longing just to bring
[1:52:12] something that's of worth
[1:52:16] that will bless your heart.
[1:52:22] I'll bring you more than a song.
[1:52:27] For a song in itself is not what you
[1:52:32] have required.
[1:52:37] You search much deeper within
[1:52:42] through the way things appear. You're
[1:52:45] looking in to my heart.
[1:52:52] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[1:52:58] And it's all about you.
[1:53:02] It's all about you, Jesus.
[1:53:06] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made
[1:53:12] it. But it's all about you.
[1:53:16] Oh, it's all about you, Jesus.
[1:53:22] King of endless worth.
[1:53:26] No one could express
[1:53:29] how much you deserve.
[1:53:36] Oh, though I'm weak and poor,
[1:53:40] all I have is yours.
[1:53:44] Every single breath.
[1:53:49] Oh, I'll bring you more than a song.
[1:53:54] For a song in itself is not what you
[1:53:59] have required.
[1:54:02] [Applause]
[1:54:03] [Music]
[1:54:04] You search much deeper within
[1:54:09] through the way things appear. You're
[1:54:12] looking in to my heart.
[1:54:19] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[1:54:25] Oh, it's all about you.
[1:54:29] Lord, it's all about you, Jesus.
[1:54:34] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made
[1:54:39] it. Oh, it's all about you.

[1:55:03] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've
[1:55:07] made.
