that was half Caleb sang last [Music] I made this song up few months ago something brother Tony preaching about Paul last week kind of brought it back to me because I was thinking the man that wrote all things worked together for good in them that loved the Lord and our call according to his purpose I wonder when he was at a whipping post or in a bottom of a prison how many times the devil said I thought all things worked together for good to them that loved him and but I believe if we trust him no matter where we are in the journey if we follow our guide he'll bring us through [Music] thank

you are mine and I will be all right [Music] oh [Music] be all right [Music] [Applause] Stand Together turn to the book of job Book of Job chapter 23 verse 1. that job answered and said even today is my complaint better my stroke is heavier than my groaning all that I knew where I might find him listen to this now that I might come even to his seat I would order my cause before him and fill my mouse with arguments wow this is a guy that's not in a good mood is it now he's not talking about me coming to my house or your house or your house or your house he's wanting to go to God's house is wanting to find God and he's wanting to tell God a thing or two he's had some real issues and some real problems and he just don't understand what's going on so it says verse three all that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat I would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments or complaints listen he says I would know the words which he would answer me and understood what he would say unto me will he plead against me with his great power no he would put strength in me I mean a lot to be remembered today as we pray Heavenly Father we thank you today For Your Precious word we thank you for the strength that we gain from it Lord we thank you that there were men like this one job that even when he got in his low place of life he still maintained an element about him that was helping helping him rather not to lose his faith he probably come to spots to where he felt like it wasn't even worth it anymore but we're so thankful Lord that you had a hold of him dear father would you sell the hands of the people there uplifted today when I'm asking you that you'll be mindful of them Lord these prayer calls that I have in my hand father for these brothers you know who they are and you know their needs I'm asking that you'll be mindful of them Lord God should go to their homes and their situations father would you anoint us today that we can be able to receive from you we've come here Lord from different walks of life and from different things that's molded us and shaped us Lord each of us our needs might be a little bit different but we believe that your God and that you can custom fit a sermon to be able to fit every Hungry Heart that's right here today would you grant it Lord in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated turn with me to job Chapter 19 Verse 14. remember we've been looking at one of the bride's rights is the right to be able to rule and reign with him that's all right but it doesn't quite mean we're up to our rights yet rights are like anything else it's given to you a person might be an heir or an heiress from a rich father a rich mother but they're only seven years old so it wouldn't do much different if there was the son or daughter of a poor man because they're not going to get what's been placed on the will to them until they're old enough to be able to know how to use it and our rights are many they are great they are tremendous they are wonderful but alas some of them will not be attained until we as the people of God have been brought into a place to where that we can be able to handle them aren't you glad that God don't give power to just anybody and everybody can you imagine if you had power to speak the spoken word you go out here and you turn right after church is over one of these gray-haired women that lives on this highway over here this blue hair sometimes and gray and pink whatever more she gets up to about 35 miles in there and you're starved to death and you're ready to go you have the power of the spoken word I wonder what you all would do with it I can tell you what some of you dude probably the same thing I would you'd push that button and spread it out your car and go up this way and go right over the top of them and go through the drivester and go home but God doesn't give that kind of power to everyone notice job as he's come into this spot in his life job 19 14. my kinsfolk have failed my familiar friends have forgotten me they that dwell in my house and my Maids count me a stranger I'm an alien in their sight now this is a man that was well thought of well looked up to admired a man that whenever he would have went to the marketplace people would have given anything just to be able to spend a few minutes time with him he was that type of a man but now something had happened to him and he didn't understand it the people didn't understand it so they're looking at it and they're trying to figure out what in the world is going on with this man it looks like he's lost favor with god well you and I go through things that can be similar well there's an oppression or a sickness or a situation in your home whatever it is and people begin to wonder what's going on with brother so-and-so Reagan what's going on with sister so-and-so well I'm beginning to wonder about the mhu all my of you noticed in church they've not been shouting like they used to shout they've not been as happy as they used to be happy all the time I'm on their third a little bit backslid if they're getting a little bit colder and different no it could be the word jobber and they might really need a friend you know I know I'll never amount to much too much in life I know that already I'm done too old to try to convince myself that I'll be much of anything but if I can just simply be a friend to someone in need or to be able to speak something to someone that is dealing with so much stuff and life that they have no clue which way they're going to go wouldn't that be awesome to be able to be that type of an individual now I hate to break the news to most of you all but most of y'all are not going to be the president of the United States or his wife or his grandson or grandson most of you aren't going to be Congress people Senate people most of you never be the mayor of Johnson City most of you will never be a CEO you'll never be a great great person of notoriety that the people of the earth will ever notice you but I'll tell you what an awesome thing it would be we may not be any of that but the Lord Jesus gives us the awesome opportunity to be able to help his children as we go through this journey and when we stand before him that day he will look at us and say thank you for helping me and you'll say Lord I never even saw you oh yes you did whenever you encourage my daughter when you encourage my son when you encourage the person that felt so low whenever you sung a song and you didn't even know why he was even singing it but it was such a blessing to them when you help them you helped me wouldn't that be awesome each of us had that opportunity now I wonder how many people that have been around job that job had helped but now job needs help and it seems as if so nobody will help him I was in a terrible State because by this time his children's gone his riches are gone his health has gone job is suffering from what they believed to be by the way he described what he had elephantiasis which was a swelling in his body that would have affected his muscles it would affected his skin it would affect it beneath the skin and it would it was it was a horrific type of disease and it would cause your flesh to start rottening and then you would put out this stench this odor that nobody wanted to be around you actually your breasts would become polluted with this stuff that you were dealing with in your body and then you would have big balls so the corruption was just oozing out of your body now your legs are swollen and tremendous size which is where it gets his name from The Elephant so your arms are swollen the pus is coming out of your body your face your lips his lips would have been swollen and bursted his mouth his ears his face he wouldn't even look like a human being so said been someone since you'd seen Joe and all of a sudden you hear job is sick and you happen to go near where he lives and you see him sitting on the porch and you smell this horrendous smell and someone from the house comes down and said Don't Go Near him we don't even know what the man's got the man is turned against God somehow and God has turned against him don't even go over there remember when his friends came and they saw job they sat there for seven days and seven nights and never opened their mouth and said one word they were so overwhelmed by what they saw now these men were great men as well and they were men of considerable understanding about life and a lot of things about life and whenever your situation would take the breaths of three great renowned men you're in bad shape now job himself didn't know what had taken place in heaven I love the way brother Branham describes it describes this and the message call I know 417 60 which was a sunrise service if you want to hear it and he says that God and job had had a debate God and job had a debate and they were debating back and forth and God was the one who brought the special attention about job and God said to the devil have you considered my servant job that there's none like him in all the Earth so God goes to bragging on him and telling him what kind of a person that he is and then the devil of course comes back and said well of course you put this hedge around him and you protect him and you don't let him go through this or that or the other I'll tell what you do you let me have him and he I will and I get done with him he will curse you to your face God said you can't do it I know what kind of man he is the prophet said God had confidence in job because he had been fellowshipping with job but you see job was not aware that this debate had went on so he's praying he's asking God he's petitioning God and God ain't saying nothing to job it's just like God is totally silent so when God gets silent when we're in these times the devil goes to talking to us and then we go to talking to ourself and other people going to talking to us and one time all that talking gets done it leaves you about where job was so job says my kin folk have failed my familiar friends have forgotten me they that dwell in my house and my Maids count me a stranger now these these people would have been the people that would have had to answer to job so if he said come here they better not do that they're going to lose their position but he had lost so much respect even in his own house that maids and servants wouldn't even come now you imagine he's thirsting this disease makes you where you are so thirsty because your body is constantly putting out these fluids so your body is just seeping with these fluids and you're running pus and you're running blood and Corruption oh it must have been an absolute terrible thing so job would have been thirsty said was somebody bring me a drink hello will somebody bring me a drink even his wife wouldn't do it notice he says in verse 16 I call my servant and he gave me no answer I entreated him with my mouse prior to this condition if he would have called for his servant he'd come run it what do you want sir oh great Noble Joe what can I do your least desire whatever you wish for your wish is my command what whatever you want but now he's stricken smitten even his servants won't come so you can imagine the man trying to understand what have I done maybe some of you have been there in your life and you say Lord what have I done if I've done something show me and I'll fix it notice he says I call my servant he gave me no answer I entreated him with my mouse my breast is strange to my wife now even his wife wouldn't get around him now I guarantee you if we would have had a weak stomach it would have been a very difficult thing to get around a person like this I've seen some pretty awful things in my life in different parts of the world where I've been and prayed for a lot of people and you may think that our hospitals here are rough you ain't got a clue till you go to some of the third world countries and see what they deal with seen people on the streets with Leprosy nose gone hand gone fingers gone absolutely awful awful things and the stench that would take your breaths now you look at them and say Well they're homeless they're just heathens or this that the other so that helps us to feel better does it so and what would we say about this man would we have been able to maintain our integrity for who he was now remember who he is he's God's prophet of the age so he is the only one in that entire age not job's wife not job's children not anyone else that God could say was a perfect man what in the world is a perfect man doing going through anything like this but you see there's something about character thrown worthy character that does not come with even the new birth it's hard for us to imagine I know but the Lord Jesus when he came to the Earth how many believe he was the sinless son of God perfect creation of God but yet he himself did not have the character that was needed well according to the church age book and we've read it to you over and over again through the years his character was perfected by the things that he suffered now remember he he laid aside the canosis of God he laid aside many of his great qualities and characteristics and traits of deity and he took on a human form a human nature a human temperament but yet there was some of that that he maintained but he could not overcome his God it would be unfair to you and I he could not face Satan as God he had to face Satan as a man filled with the Holy Ghost using God's word as his only defense he could not use the crown of deity to defeat deaths he could not use the crown of deity to defeat Temptation Jesus conquered women in that day my brothers in the same way we will conquer them and that is the sons of God filled with the Holy Ghost if he conquered his deity and then told you and I to do it we could answer him back and say that is not fair you conquered as God and you are telling me to conquer as a man so what did he do he laid that aside and said all right Sons this is what I will do I will step aside from my position in the heavens I will not conquer sickness as God I will not conquer death as God I will not conquer Temptation I will not conquer Pride arrogant selfishness so on and so on as God I will conquer it as one of my brothers I will conquer it as one of my daughters I will humble myself and lay aside who and what I am and yet he when it comes to the Earth he is perfect as he was father did not create in him a perfect human character he come to the Earth like you and I when it come to that a character that must be molded now remember he was not flawed in the sense that we were but he was not in that sense of having that perfect character which was fit to rule so he must be tried he must be tested he must be misunderstood he must be rejected how many of y'all been ever been rejected before by friends family people of course we all have and there's something about being rejected that's hard on all of us rejection has a different reaction to us than acceptance does when we are accepted it's totally different than we are rejected and really what's different it's whatever you're accepted by people for a long time and then the rejected you'd experience that as far as friends so he had to come the same way he could not just be tried in the sense of up on the the great the Pinnacle of the temple he could not just be tried up on the Mountaintop shown the kingdoms of the world but he must be turned down he must be put into a spot to her whatever he said could happen and his human temperament want to be able to raise up and say I'll get you for that I will get you back remember I will get you no he never done that one time but he had to understand that feeling he had to be able to relate I noticed job says my breath is strange to my wife though I am treated for the children's sake of my own body now imagine his personal reputation as far as his wife was concerned now the one that she could point to him in any way of sin Jehovah you've done this and you've done that and you've done that there was not one thing that the woman could say as a matter of fact she turned right around and told him said why don't you just Curse God and die that's the best thing for you that's the best thing for me that's the best thing for the household just go ahead and curse God and die and get out of this wicked wretched measure in you're an embarrassment to me I have to put up with you you smell like I don't know what I've got to deal with you all the time I have to try to bring you some meals every now and then and you stinks about it can't hardly stand it Brothers can you imagine sisters can you imagine being treated that way oh my and yet job did not know that God had said this man is a perfect man you know myself as I get older and as I travel around and been in different parts of the world and I realize that there's many people around the ranks of our message and probably myself just looking at him I think one of the things that I found the lack which would be one of the biggest likes Among Us is a character which is fit to rule maybe you have signs and wonders and can cast out devils and do that sort of thing and sing and do all all types of works but when it comes to being able to have a character that is throne Worthy I'm afraid we're going to be short that day I'm afraid we're going to find out that many have said in our ranks and some that's even said in our church when it comes to dealing with people coming to know how to deal with them that will say thanks against you and treat you wrong and do this and that and the other it's really really hard it's really difficult for us to be able to rise above our Humanity because we tend to lean toward the nature that was given to us by our parents notice job says yay young children despise me now to us for us to read that in this day and in the age of disrespect that we have it ain't no big deal for little kids and whoever to disrespect you but in that day that was so anti-cultural for the way that they were brought up because the way that they would have been in silver remember job is the oldest book of the Bible so for them to have this this ability to treat job in this way they must have been hearing it in their home from their parents so their parents must have been the one that was talking maybe around the table and they were saying have you heard about job have you heard this how many of you heard about Joe yeah man I heard about that I'll tell you what I don't know when I've ever been surprised in my life I thought that was a great man of God didn't you I sure did I thought that man just walked with god well I guess we was wrong because it's easy to see now from what I hear you can't even get in the room or that man is they tell me I was talking down to some of some of the sisters the other day down at the store and they told me that they got kind of close out too though they brought some butter and eggs and things like that and wanted to say Miss Joe might want to buy some and they got right up close to the porch and the stench was so bad one of them sisters told me that she had to just run out there and leave she couldn't even sell her eggs and her batter and her molasses and her sorghum and all that stuff she got so sick and she got behind the Big Bay Tree over there and that poor Saint started vomiting because the smell that was coming out of that house well see right there that's what I'm talking about there ain't no way in the world that that could be a man of God and going through that type of trial come on uh testing one two three am I am I okay am I working I I wonder sometimes if we don't look at people and judge them by what they're going through and begin to sing ah there must be something wrong job's comforters oh my God oh my goodness notice yeah young children to despise me I Rose and they spoke they spake against me all my inward friends now we move into the closest friends that a person can have them I know we all have friends by degrees I have friends around the world my goodness I've been blessed by the grace of God I've got friends around the world but then you have close intimate friends and then you have that inner Inner Circle you know what I'm talking about and you may not have that many in that inner circle but you just feel like they're the ones that will stick with you through sick and sin they'll be right there no matter what you're going through and you can tell them anything and they're the type of friend that whenever you're down you can tell them and they're just brother hang in there I'm right there with him but yet job had tried that so it broke all of the circles of friends that he had those that were acquaintances and they all surely knew them and they knew him and that showed him respect but they were some of the first ones to get go but then it got closer and closer and the circles kept breaking and breaking and now Joe is actually at the inward Circle the very closeness of all friends all my inward friends abhorred me they whom I love are turned against me now over what reason what had the man done the man had not taken somebody else's wife had not molested one of the maids that was in the house he had not robbed anybody did not cheated anybody a man of honor and integrity oh but you see the hand of God have been turned loose on this man isn't it amazing I mean Carol heard the devours that we've known for many many years and we heard this as it was coming back down the road and you know the prophet when he relates to this you know I love to dramatize him how beautiful it was when he would do it his friends had turned against him and job did not know and understand that God was going to bring out of this the greatest thing of his entire life but it certain it didn't seem like it it's higher quoted it to us early when he sung the song and by the way I didn't know Harry was singing that song matter of fact first time I ever heard in my life I didn't know that Harry was singing to her he didn't know what I was preaching but I believe the Lord has us in mind today I love it when God does that don't you you see the real spirit of God I don't have to call Brother Louie and tell Brother Louie he's saying this song but the Lord have that brother sang that song have sister that sang that song but the spirit of God knows how to be able to orchestrate things together doesn't he so it must have been to where that now it has come so close notice that job says my N word all my inward friends abhorred me and they whom I loved are turned against me my bone Cleaves to my skin notice now he says my bone cleave us to my skin so this part of his flesh what's the elephantiasis has not are all swollen out his bones and they're just like glued his skin is glued to his bones and the inflammation must have been absolutely terrible no doubt when it first started there was he could afford some of the best doctors that was in the land of us and the like the doctors would have come in all types of Specialists and maybe he went to clinics and hospitals of that day whatever they were and they tried to diagnose him and they rubbed him with all types of herbs and compounds and this and that and the other I don't care what they would have tried there's absolutely nothing that could have cured this man until it come time time for God to turn the tide now let me tell you today maybe you're in the state and you're praying about a Deliverance of whatever it is now I don't know too much about God but I do know enough about him to know sometimes he has a reason the prophet said that this way when we pray that sometimes God says yes sometimes he says no and sometimes he says wait a while now if God says wait a while then he has a reason for making you wait because a lot of times during that waiting period there's pain involved there's separation involved those anxiety involved God is not doing that without a reason can anybody say Amen but when God does say wait maybe it's for one more doctor to see you and agree with all the rest of them there is no medical hope you'll absolutely be on hell you're beyond science maybe God wants one more rehab therapist or one more nurse or one more specialist to be able to add their name to the ones that's already on the list and say well we feel sorry for them but there's nothing else we can do and then when God turns it around it's one testimony after another after another after another after another of what God did what they could not do so I've learned myself that whenever the Lord delays it's not that he doesn't care and it's not that God gets joy out of watching his children and anxiety God does not enjoy him whenever he sees me and you so burdened down and so trouble and it seemed like that we cannot be able to make it another day and we think Lord what have we done what have we done tell us let us know it's not that God is saying haha I really enjoy watching you all suffer this is so much fun no God is not that type of a god oh my aren't you glad he's a loving father so many says wait a while it's for a reason now notice he said my bone Cleaver to my skin and to My Flesh and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth I don't take a rocket scientist to run your tongue over the top of your teeth right now you can do it if you like you realize you ain't got much there so it's pretty thin is it not job said I'm right down to the very last had pity upon me have pity upon me oh you my friends what's he doing now job is answering back to his comforters who've come down and they said you're a secret sinner you ain't right with God you've got something going on in your life yes that's what it is you've got something going on in your life why look here look that this certain certain woman could have come through a prayer line she come to that said bob hair had on lipstick this and that mother and God absolutely deal and yet look at you you love the Lord and you believe him with all of your heart and you've had a harder time since a prayer line than you had before then there must be something wrong with you no it must be something right with you there must be something about you that God can trust you I hope you understand what I'm fixing to say there are many many Christians in this world that God cannot trust with great trouble there are many message Believers that God cannot trust with great difficulty there are message preachers that God could not trust with a great load of anxiety and trouble he simply could not they could not bear it they could not take it now maybe you're saying Glory Hallelujah I hope I'm one of them well I feel sorry for if that's your attitude I want God to be able to trust me with whatever he knows I can bear don't you I'm not looking for a fiery bed of ease myself now notice he said have pity on me had pity on me oh you're my friends for the hand of God has touched me now you see here in a sense job is wrong hey send me a quote the other day and I'll read it to you momentarily that brother Randall said that if as long as Joe if Satan could convince job that it was God doing this to him he had him defeated but once he understood God was not doing this but God was allowing Satan to if you listen to that message I know you'll hear Brother random say that God will allow those Messengers you remember in the Old Testament when that demon that lying Spirit come and God said how can I get the people to be able to fulfill what I said by Mine by Prophet Elijah remember that an aligned Spirit come up before the Throne of God and bowed down before God and said I'll go down there and be a lying Spirit and the mouse of all them false prophets if you want me to now remember God cannot anoint anybody to lie God cannot anoint any person to ever leave his word that's why the word is our absolute feelings will deceive us that means ever had your feelings to deceive you of course they will dreams are not infallible now a lot of dreams you have is like the ones I have you ate too much sauce and chips before you went to bed that night and you had too much indigestion that caused this weird dream and then you get up thinking oh Lord there was 13 crows and there was three buzzards and there was three turpentine bottles and that was three moon pies one of them Moonpies are doing there I can't figure that out all that it must have been some spiritual I doubt it what did you eat before you went to bed now come on Church don't get quiet on me but yet you realize God will actually tap into that and allow these things to do it God did not touch Joe it was not the hand of God but job thought it was it was actually God bringing him to a state of perfection notice in verse 22 why do you persecute me as God are you not satisfied with my flesh you know in other words he's saying what what you mean you all can't see the pitiful shape that I'm in it must have been horrendous I cannot imagine by the Jack how them friends is even so-called even sat there within hearing distance of this man's voice and they were mesmerized by the state of this man sitting there so much that didn't even say a word for seven days and nights now notice he says all that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book little did he know they would be thank God they were all that my words were printed in a book that they were Graven with an iron pen and led in the rock forever now notice when he comes right down to it look at something he knows for ah no now that was a lot he didn't know Joe why are you going through this I don't know why is your wife forsaken you your servants forsaken you why don't God hear you on your prayer I don't know why don't God heal you as soon as you ask him I don't know why has all of your friends turned away from you I don't know do you know of anything that you have done so I don't know of anything and he could say I don't know I don't know I don't know anybody ever been there besides job oh yeah and you just don't know this and you don't know that but there's one thing left which was very important that he knew I'll tell you a friend I don't care what you're going through here today if all hell is breaking loose against you if you can have this same I know that job had it will shake all hell around you now notice there's one thing left that he knew for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the lighter day upon the earth I do know this I have a redeemer now remember he was abled by the spirit of God to move forward in time under this divine inspiration and be able to say I don't know why I'm sick I don't know why my wife won't even speak to him and my kids this other I don't know what I've done I don't know but I do know this My Redeemer Lives is there anybody here today that can say I know my redeemer lives true I don't know why I'm here I don't know why I'm going through this and that and the other my families have an office time ever was but I know one thing my God's A Healer well I believe we know more than just one thing I believe our God is El Shady eyes I believe he is Redeemer he is our healer he is our deliverer I wish somebody would preach with me this morning you see job come down the way I had one thing left that he knew oh you have got a whole heart full today you have got a whole message full of things that God has given us in the positive affirmation I know this word is right I know there's a Rapture I know he's coming I know I'm going I know you're going with me well somebody say amen I know Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I know he's coming back I know Satan will bow [Applause] I know look at me again in job 23 8. look at the search and the Quest for God in such deep anxiety you know God has such a way of hiding he not only hides from the church orders and a lot of the seminaries but when he wants to he can hide from the elect behold I go forward but he's not there backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he does work I see that's him I know that's him doing this so I go over to be a part of it and he will let me have nothing on the left hand where he does work but I cannot Behold Him so I see his works and I see manifest in himself and I said God please remember me please remember me mississaugi turns away from me he hideths himself on the right hand you imagine almighty God hiding from job well I'll tell you one thing I've never been through on show bad but I have experienced a few of these things myself anybody else in here well glory to God I'm so glad to know the rest y'all just live on Mount sunset or whatever the name of your mountain is wow it must be awesome come see me after church tell me how that is so I looked at him on the left and I looked for him on the right and whenever I just knew he'd be there and when I turned he hid himself from me oh my God he Harvest himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he's still got some hope left but he knows the way that I take when he has tried me I shall come forth as gold and Word of Life said what he has tried me I shall come Force like gold notice this and how can overcome Christ is the ruler's Throne ruler at this time of the complete domain of God so will the church be with him the bride be with him in his throne in his entire domain see not on my throne but in my Throne now remember he's reading the scripture there in Revelation that we will set with him in his throne not on the liberal Throne itself but in his domain in his Dominion notice a throne is over a domain at a domain reaches as far as its boundaries does and this is from eternity to Eternity just think of it now this is what the Lord has given us the right to be but it's a mystery really because he calls us chooses Us by predestination thought of us before the foundation of the world that thought is eternal then when we come to the Earth that thought is deposited in our soul it lays our dormant for years and years then one day we become Born Again by the breast of God and we start changing my things just fall off and other things we have to work on for a long time but we started having or going heavenward and then day by day we go through things and there'll be days that things go good and there'll be times that will lose a little ground but we don't lose it for long we regain it again is that right and then we just keep on pressing and pressing and pressing and we're overcoming this and overcoming that but yet there's still something lacking in us that the baptism of the Holy Ghost did not give and that is a character that is so much like the Lord Jesus that one day Fallen angels and people will walk before us as we sit with him in his throne and we will judge them so was our present character here today I wonder how we would judge if the Judgment were called this morning no doubt there's people that we would judge wrongly in the sense that we are so convinced they are just such wonderful people but you don't know in six months from now they will do this this and this and this and totally turn away from God and leave his word yeah we judge by sight or how much we like them Ain't No Way in the world he'll be a no bride ain't no way she can be an old bride my goodness you know you you heard the latest one him or her done but you know this service might change him or her and they'll never be the same again so that you judge that they were serpent seed and you totally missed him can't you see even the new birth does not give to us that divine nature to be able to judge and have the right type of character or that we know how to deal with people well praise the Lord now it is that part that God must mold and shape in each of us now notice he says in the Sumerian Church age a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even as strong on the same basis that he overcame and has set down on his father's son that we have to overcome the set with him overcome what just drinking smoking lying help all of that too but mainly ourselves ourselves even after you lay aside all them habits you still live in that old stinking rotten body of yours just like I do in mine now notice he says that we have to have this type of character to be able to Reign he wants to share with us what he has then we have to overcome to set with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now it's not worthy to be competitive the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when it comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through shouting jumping so much joy so many blessings that you can't even count them much tribulation how many still wants to go a few lesson when we started long enough I hate that for you but I'm trusting you're gonna be helpful for the service though notice in First Peter chapter 1 verse 6. wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness how many understands heaviness heaviness heaviness through manifold this word is variegated which means many different species through manifold Temptations at the trial of your faith being much more precious than that of gold that parishes though it be tried with fire may be found unto the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ now this is the quota sang about remember the trials the Dusty Rhodes the hot son of persecution but the Loyalty of your heart beats that material until she's ready to go into the mole listen what beats the material now this is an awesome quote thank you for sending this to me Harry remember the trials of Dusty Rhodes the hot son of persecution but the Loyalty of your heart beats that material till she is ready to go into the mold so the Loyalty of your heart beats Christ the word beats Integrity beats strength beats faithfulness it just beats beats beats beats beats love Mercy joy peace happiness beyond all the understanding love sanctification praise God it's just beaten beaten beaten it's beaten in you and it's taking the material and beating and molding something in you and naturally you were born must say a streak of temper and whenever people say anything to you boy you have a hard time ever forgetting it and you want to give them a piece of your mind but your God calls Sanctified heart is beaten turned the other Chief and pray for him don't hold a grudge but forgive when you stand praying say father forgive as always you forgive men so your father will forgive you somebody say Amen if not when somebody walks before you at the white Throne judgment and you know they done you wrong you will judge them and send them to Hell from the memory of the way they wrongs you oh my well Jesus I need help I'll go ahead and say for them too Lord they all need it too and everybody just streaming today we need help oh my notices she said God's children is made up correctly on the word for they are living examples and the word of God living through them see the trial comes to shake you to put you to the very bottom wow to put you to the very bottom to see where you'll stand the tested try every son that comes to God as long as Satan can make Justice I'm about Joe now make him think that his sickness was his God doing it he had job whipped but when job once struck the Revelation it was not God it was only God through trials to make him he was only going through his trials to make him something it wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing it and the same thing today he'll try to tell you these Charleston thing is your God put your punishment upon you It Isn't So no sir it's Satan doing that and God permitting it to temper you oh my help us Lord Jesus to make you see if you're tied to this Earth by the Earth's cares or whether your Treasures are in heaven for whether your Treasures is thyroid your heart also that's right your heart it's where your Treasures are so in the heart is beating in a child of God I'm called I'm chosen but you've asked him and you've asked him you've asked him for this and that and the other as he answered you well no not yet there's your Faith's answer not yet but it's on the way what how long does it take him to get here well it don't take him that long at all but if he's delaying he's just waiting for a reason oh my I told Eric I think it was yesterday me and Carol to stop to pray for it and I told her I said you'd be faithful you hang right there to God's promised word because I believe with all of my heart the angel of God's going to pass through this cul-de-site or this community one day in this neighborhood and you're going to be a hell a heel woman you're going to be a heal Woman by the grace of God let me say the same thing to you today you keep on holding on for your healing you keep holding on for your deliverance if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you keep holding on and the devil says it ain't for you say shut your mouth and get back down where you belong it's for me it's unto you and your children and them that are as far off medium it is the Lord Our God shall call amen it's for you healing is for you Deliverance is for you it's yours but you'll have to fight to get it oh my God though the skin worms eat it up he said it will still come back whom I shall see for myself mine eyes Shall Behold and not another he said it job listen to this I love this why he was a believer and trials he was a Believer a man wants to be a believer in trials that's what gets a lot of people in persecution he was a Believer he was a genuine believer and trouble I want to be a believer and sickness I still want to be a be a believer in delays and circumstances I don't understand I still want to be a believer well that ain't hard because I am a believer so I'm not just a believer in the good times I'm not just a believer or come on somebody I'm not just a believer when things is going good I'm not just a believer when I got friends everywhere I was still a believer in love the message folks turned me down years ago but I'm still a Believer come on somebody I want to be a believer when Satan says he ain't going to move I say yes he is because I'm his son well when's he going to do it I don't know but I know he'll do it I don't know how he's going to change our body I don't know when the rights is coming but I believe with all of my soul it is I believe there's people here today that are going to enter into that rapture notice in this sermon I know it is written in one of the scriptures in the Bible the trials brought upon us are more precious to us than gold itself where does God giving us these trials after we become his property our confession and our baptism and our promise to walk in life for him then every child that comes upon us is to perfect us for his glory I say brother Donnie wait a minute I thought the blood of Jesus perfects us two different words two different words in the New Testament use for perfect one of them is complete adding what is lacking the other one is sinlessness this character of Trials and things you go through does not make you sinless the blood does that but these types of things what do they do they add what's lacking in our walk with God anybody here today be honest with me so I need help brother Tony I've got things missing in my walk of God I need it well you see what brother does that mean that I'm lost absolutely not I'm talking about a separate thing than your soul being sinless in the eyes of God do you understand whenever he hears you pray if you're in Christ Jesus say let me hear your voice it's coming right up through the blood of the Lord Jesus it's the same as the Lord Jesus himself praying and yet our human character can still be flawed oh what a great mystery the new birth is and God absolutely hears us and the angels of God have to stand there while we which were lost without God God would hear our prayer the prophet says it over and over again who has more Authority in heaven a Son of God or an angel you know the answer to that it's a Son of God and yet that Son of God in the earth may be lacking oh my so much in his human character though one he prays Heaven answers whenever he prays have an answers and God will send angels to that son or daughter of God and yet they're missing so much in their character praise God notice this it's to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial came wow so I'm standing at the Carter County Bank a little bit ago and the teller of the lady there they know us go to the banks with them for years and years from the church and stuff every time I walk in she says hello preacher that's why she calls me all the time preacher so there's several things going on there and I need to do a little something there for me she said well you just have to give me a minute I preacher he said patience ain't one of my virtues I've been praying God but give me more I said ma'am the Bible says tribulation workers patience patience experience experience hope hope maketh not a shame because the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us and she said maybe I should not pray that way no more another teller lady was there and she said what was you just quoting to her so I go back through it again nothing like a Bible study right in Carter County Bank right she said but you mind telling me what that scripture is say Yes Man be glad to but there's something about it tribulation workers our patience and it brings something that after the trial is over I heard people and they're going to think I'm crazy but I've heard people so oh my in the last couple of years has had cancer had this and that and the other and one particular person said right here looking at me today said I would take absolutely nothing for what I went through because when I came through on the other side I was closer to God than I had ever been in my life and I've come to your church for years and years and heard you're preaching and this and that but that trial done something for me that all the preaching I heard never done of course the thing of it is all that preaching helped build up their faith and give them the ability to go through that trial and we know that but there's something about trials it does US good oh how many wants one now [Music] one person okay God bless you sis I'll be praying for you oh Bob that's there's something about it it goes more than somebody writing you a check for ten thousand dollars time the IRS gets their part and your grandson gets the other four your wife gets the other party you won't have much left anyhow and trials bring something to us that is more precious than gold or if this building will stop full of gold today we say oh my everybody get what you want get your portion pay your household pay your car off pay your bills off mine we'll come back Wednesday night driving Cadillacs and Escalades and Tahoes and Suburbans and everything else well glory to God I got a house full of gold let me tell you something you have already heard enough this morning that is way more value than this building than full of gold 500 times over because this will keep you when the world is on fire this will keep you in test when you ain't got a Pity to your name [Applause] let me close but the band says I want to join in this morning with job to say I've lived long enough to know that's the truth I've seen it in my own life that every time a great trip situation arouses I can't get around it I can't go under it Oh Glory can't get around it can't go under it can't go over it God makes a way and comes out glorious I just wonder how his grace ever does it but he doesn't how many has been there one is fed so big and you look around well can't go that way I want about this way no can't go that way no can't go that way well what about is it better than maybe we go on the top of you trying you're trying nope it's It's Too Tall can't go over well what if we dig under it you go to digging digging digging sweating digging and you realize I think man it's way bigger than I thought it was so you can't go around to the left you can't go around to the right you can't go if every King oh Lord and how in the world does God ever do it well he comes right through sometimes he just carves a hole right in the middle of it and you walk straight through it on the other side God just perfect in building tunnels he is an absolute Master tunnel Beetle Builder so the greatest trial you've ever faced in your life you may be looking at a mountain today that is solid grounded as we would say and you think there is no way around it it's too tall I've done got binoculars up there and I've done done and we shot down in there 40 feet deep and we can't go below it well maybe the Lord God wants to just open up the Rock and cause you to go right through on the other side and quotes that when you get through and say see their child I was with you the whole time when it looks like everything has gone wrong God's given you a trial listen to this it's got confidence he don't have to baby you around you're not a hot blood plant a hybrid you're a real Christian God has given you a test see what you'll do about it amen no wonder Peter said these fire trials why countic Joy I'm still working on that part sometimes counted Joy it's more precious to you than go to many times we hum and haul Herman Hall how many over homes and Halls that's mule language you know that right humming Hall new language that's the stubbornness still in us wait home and home oh well well that well that something God's give to you to overcome he knows he knows you'll do it he's put his Trust and you maybe I'm crazy okay I would rather have that right there than every gift if I was the greatest preacher in the world if I was the greatest this and another wind up missing it and being lost now a person could be that and have this too but they could also have that and be lost as a matter of fact I sit at the funeral the other day and there was an older brother standing there him and his wife got married and they spent their honeymoon in Bakersfield California at brother Brown's meetings in 1964. so he's an older preacher I'd imagine 80s maybe something like that and somebody come to the message boy just you know just love so much about it but one thing that stumbled him awful women preachers oh you guessed it you had a woman pastor he saw this woman preacher raise the Dead he saw this woman preach or pray for people I have all kinds of Miracles all kinds of healings and he said brother Donnie I never heard a human being preached like that woman could preach said she could preach much better than a lot of men but he said one day the Lord made it real to him that it was against the word and when he did it just lifted him so you see you could cast out Devils you could raise the dead you could do all of those things but can God put his Trust I'm sure you feel like I feel I don't put my trust in everybody no I've been around too long for that there ain't nobody no mortal that I put my ultimate trust in when it comes to as far as a preacher no I've done been dealt too bad by preachers there's one person I put in my ultimate trust in I love you all and I trust you and you'll have to trust me if I can help you but don't put your ultimate trust in me because I'll fail you ever preacher that you've got your ultimate tested faith in I feel sorry for you because you're one closer one preacher closer to not even believing in them because all you got to do is be hurt by that one and then you're finishing person I don't believe in Precious no more got too much trust in him didn't you trust is such a great thing can you imagine almighty God putting trust in you young men your young sisters your brothers your preachers your Deacons God saying Judy I trust you I'm gonna take Junior it's my will but I know you I know you'll still love me Linda I'm gonna take Jimmy it's gonna break your heart you'll think you ain't got nothing else to live for but I trust you can he trust you that's a more value friends than tongues interpretation prophecy if God trusts you know how we are as humans the more I get hurt in life the less people I trust I saw a bumper sticker not long ago said the more I get around humans the more I love animals I'm fixing to have a body wrap done in my vehicle that way you know what I'm saying people that you feel are your closest and dearest friends and they'll stab you in the back and turn on you just like and what do we tend to do I won't trust nobody else I won't trust nobody and you know who you're fixing to hurt the worst yourself if you folks that had done to you what I've had done to me by preachers entering around this message and around the world you wouldn't be at this church today as a matter of fact you'd never Stark on another church door because you think hey no preachers right they'll lie to you for money I've had them to lie to me for money I've had them to lie for me for this and that the other betray your trust use you for what they can get out of you and I still believe in Preachers nobody had been hurt by preachers like brother Branham had but brother Branham hoped both of his boys would be preachers aha well Lewis Lawrence comes to our church here brother Branham dedicated his brother and himself in 1961 and he prayed a prayer over him may God make him a preacher notice the dedication that brother Branham had over little boys pray they're similar to the very same prayer make a preacher out of them make a picture out of him he had been hurt and more hurt by preachers than all of us put together no doubt but it was still God's word I want to trust his word and then he can trust me with Santa got him oh my he knows you'll do it he's put Trust he knew when he took Hope from Brother Branham when he took his little girl although brother Branham would get a gun and try to commit suicide the gun would fail it climb up the electric pole jerky's gloves off lay his hands over on The Wire and the angel of God must have been there to protect him because he come to himself at the bottom of the pole he thought he couldn't take it no more he thought he couldn't take it matter of fact I'll read it maybe in a week or so he said that stumbled me so bad why God would take him he said but then I saw some time after that and I saw my little Sharon beside that broken wagon a star is a beautiful young woman and then I realized if she would have lived something might have happened to her but now she's where nothing can ever happen to her so you see when God does things and we think I just don't understand I don't understand but we trust him even when we don't understand him let me loves him today with all your heart you want to trust him with all you are you want him to trust you it's about history beloved thinketh not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you Heavenly fathers we have our heads bowed today Lord God you know wherever person is today Lord I thought yesterday that I was ready but me and Carol around the house there a bit and doing some things just changed my direction completely and the way I thought I was going to go so I know this is Timely today father we desire that we can be faithful and true we know that Our Redeemer Lives for many of us most of us probably Satan has done come too late to tell us there is no God come too late to tell us that he don't move we've seen enough things among us my goodness we've seen more in our church than what's written in the entire book of Acts as far as things that you have done we thank you for that so it's come too late to tell us you don't move anymore but he tries to tell us you don't love us or you don't care for us as an individual or a man and his wife or a man in his family because they're going through such things some Lords struggles so hard with their finances and they just seem like they struggle and struggle and can never get ahead and if they do get a little bit ahead something will come up and set them back and they just back and forth and back and forth and they look at others around them being so blessed so financial and it just causes them a battle they just can't figure it out some Lord trusts you for healing in their body and they see others and know about others that get healed Lord we know the Hill People right here on the prayer line Lord that don't even believe this word dear God we know of ones that you touched and performed miracles for and yet some of your children come through with the same Faith believe it in the same hands laid on them and nothing's happened yet so it lets us know you're God you control it we don't so apparently you could not try some of these maybe weaker Christians to get Glory out of their life the way you can some of your mature ones father forgive us for complaining Lord and forgive us father whenever we question and doubt oh Lord we love you with all of our hearts as brother skip said it Lord the man said it well Lord I believe but help thou mine unbelief and that's what Satan tries to put on us we

him I know what he'll do I know he'll get low I know he'll get weary he'll curse the day was born he'll say why did it have to be said that there was a man child born why was it not in the morning hours that my mother did not pass me why did I have to come to the earth oh he got so miserable but God looked at the end he said I know my son I'm no job be strong children and the Lord and then the power of his might we will crest every wave we will come through every storm the Lord God will give us what we need he'll help you don't get weary he'll help us he'll be our stay and our strength you ever get that brother Donnie but I do but when it's all said and done and I get by myself and I think you know what Lord I'm just so tired of preaching I've been preaching most all my life pastor over 40 years preaching longer than that I think I'm at the retirement age I guess maybe I could just retire just play the guitar here maybe or sing maybe I'll let me sing every now and then or something I say you labor for people and you pray for them they come to church when they want to come to church and they don't they'll turn their back on you just like that never even come and tell you how much they'll leave and go wherever never even pick up the phone and call you and tell you I appreciate all the labor you prayed me through to the Holy Ghost you prayed for me when I sick it was your prayers that brought me out of the hospital not even enough respect for you and you think you know what forget the whole thing y'all can have his new church if you want it I'm out of here then you say now Donnie it's been a long time since you got a whooping from your daddy my Daddy Don Reagan had a pretty good sized hand I've got walloped with it several times probably not near enough but his hand ain't near as big as my heavenly father's hand oh let me knows what I'm talking about so then I go ahead and get up put my towel on the devil says where are you going some going to burn your hide what do you figure I'm going so when you're saying why should I even come to church why should I do this that the other the devil said we're going sir where you think I'm going I'm going to church I'm going to clap my hands I'm going to sing I'm gonna amen the man of God I'm gonna get what God's got for me get out of my way devil Oh I thought you was discouraged I was but I ain't no more Hallelujah let's sing together hey can we worship him just a little bit while ago I know you got dinner plans you're going here and there and there but oh my let's just love the Lord a little bit before we go let's just love it if God you found favor in his sight Erica told me probably seven eight months ago I sent her a quote from the victory dates tremendous service tape if you haven't listened to it in a while brother Bama said when you go through a trial it shows that you found favor in God's side she said Daddy I wouldn't mind a little bit if I didn't find so much favor I said I understand honey I understand you're praying for her aren't you I know you are every day I so appreciate that I don't know how we would have come through this trial if you all hadn't have helped us thank you for what you've done your prayers your concern I thank you so much I hear from people around the world every week people God will wake people up during the wee hours of the morning this and that and praying for her thank you thank you so much we need one another but I don't want you to think she's the only one we pray for oh no there's many other needs in our church we don't want to just call Erica's name and say well the other a man and no brother the other day they're in Indiana and he said brother we pray for her every day and he said I got to be honest with you sometimes I don't remember her name but I'll say Lord you know who I'm talking about I said yes brother sometimes we have to do like the little boy that he was down praying on his knees praying and he was saying ABC a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p somebody asked himself what are you doing he said well sometimes I don't know what to say so I just say the alphabet and let God put it together I hope we never get so deep and think we know so much that we Overlook those simple things or say but my prayer what would it do it might be your prayer that will climax Erica's healing the Lord laid it on his sister's heart here a few weeks ago she come to Carol out your service said I've got to go pray for sister Carol hope you don't think I'm crazy he said okay she said wash shorts all right I don't care whose prayer God heals hears if I'm going through something I don't care if it's a kid if it's one of these little boys that prays for me and gone answers my prayer do you think I care who it is what difference does it make
