Give them a good hand tonight if you will. Praise the Lord. Amen. We're going to look at our prayer request now. We got a message just a while ago that uh Interstate 26 uh from Gray to Boon Creek or Boon Creek to Gray, whichever way you're going, is at a standstill. So, we may have some people that didn't make it tonight because of that or we'll be running a little bit late, but we just want to pray for traveling mercy for all those on the highways tonight. Uh, Sister Rebecca is asking for continued prayer for her three-year-old grandson whose name is Kanan. Please pray for his safety and well-being as his family and home life are very unsettled at this time. Thank you for your prayers. So, we want to remember that tonight. Sister Ruth Louise Jackson is asking for urgent prayer for her and her entire family. They're very concerned about the unsettling conditions where they are currently dwell dwelling and their desire is to be directed by the Lord for a safer place to live. So let's remember that prayer request tonight. Brother Frank Williams is asking for urgent prayer concerning his grandson John Johnson. Please pray that God will grant him the spiritual guidance and help he needs concerning his needs concerning his children's well-being. Brother Frank also wants everyone to know that he and Sister Jackie love and miss each and every one of you and would love nothing more than to be here to be in service to worship. So, we want to remember those folks tonight, those prayer requests. We love Brother Frank and Sister Jackie, don't we? Amen. Brother Curtis Hunnel wants to thank everyone for their continued prayers as he recovers from his recent fall. The pain has decreased and his strength has improved, allowing him to drive and walk with assistance.

The Lord would would remember him. This is from the Waco family. Dear church family, we sincerely appreciate continued prayers for brother Sam Waco and our family. He still feels pretty good overall other than tiring easily and sorish from this week's procedures. But after going through scans, blood work and laparoscopy has been given a serious diagnosis. He is facing a tremendous surgery possibly in January involving cancer removal and a chemo wash in his abdominal area. The surgery could take 12 hours or more followed by a few days in the intensive care with two weeks hospital stay and a long recovery to follow. The surgical oncologist openly confesses that we have a big God and she is just a vessel for God to use to help people. She said that Sam is a good candidate for this surgery and everyone to keep praying. Also, his job is very physical. He has been has lifting restrictions now. So, he's not able to work at this time, which is a great concern to him. We need God's leadership in all this. Thank you. We love you all. God bless you, the WCO family.

So let's remember that prayer request tonight as we pray that God would be mindful all the unspoken prayer request. I know there's tremendous needs in our group. We just commit all these things unto the Lord. We're serving a God that cares about our needs. You believe that tonight with all your heart? He's a caring God.

We can say no to every tactic that Satan throws against us. God has given us the ability to say no. I don't want that. I'm not doing that. By the grace of God, he has made us free. Are you glad you're free tonight? &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I'm free." I'm free. &gt;&gt; Give him one more good hand clap of praise tonight. Thank God I am free. Free. Free from this world of sin.

All of our streamers, we want to say welcome. Could we give all those folks a good hand tonight along with their singers? Give them a good hand tonight if you will. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It's not what I prayed [singing] for. It's not what I wanted. It's not something [music and singing] I understand. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; My circumstances [singing] seem so confusing. [music] I'm placing it all [singing] in your hands. [music] Your ways [singing] are higher than mine. I want mountains [music and singing] to move. You want me to climb. So I'm going [singing] to trust [music] your work, your will, and your time. [singing] Your [music] ways are higher than mine. One day [singing] I'm sure I will look back [music] and marvel at how you knew best [singing] all along. [music] You see from heaven. [singing] You know it's [music] the hard times that make my faith steady [singing] and strong. Your [music] ways are higher than mine. I want mountains to move. [singing] [music] You want me to climb. So I'm [singing] going to trust [music] your work, your will, [singing] and your time. [music] Your ways [singing] are higher than mine. When I start to [music] doubt, [singing] help me believe in [music] somewhere [singing] so far above me. [music] Your [singing] ways are higher than mine.

[music] [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; going through so [singing] many changes. What's the news for [singing] today? [music] Somebody's hurt. Somebody's [singing] aching. Somebody's [singing] trying to find a way. [singing] A [music] heavy heart can break [singing] your will. [music] A troubled soul leaves time [singing] standing still. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; If [singing] you're hurting, please don't hide. Lift up your head. [singing] I'm on your side. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; But every mountain seems [music] too high. But every [singing] river looks too wide. When my dreams are lost and [singing and music] seen, Jesus rescues me. [singing] My faith is strong and carries me. [singing] Though sometimes [music] we still [singing] believe. My life is built [music] on this desire. Through the flood and through the fire, Jesus [music and singing] rescues me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I know [singing] you're looking for an answer, searching [singing] for some hope to [music] hold. Empty hands leave you waiting and praying [singing] for [music] a miracle. But Jesus hears your every cry. [singing] He sees the walls that you can climb. [singing] And he will heal your hurting soul [singing] and lead you safely to [singing] his home. Every mountain seems [music] too high [singing] and every river looks [music] too wide. [singing] When my dreams are lost and sea, Jesus [singing and music] rescues me. My faith is strong [singing] and carries [music] me. Sometimes [singing] we still believe. My life is [music and singing] built on this desire. Through the flood and through the fire, Jesus [music and singing] rescues me. When every mountain [music] seems too high [singing] and every river looks too [music] wide. [singing] When my dreams are lost [music] at sea, [singing] Jesus rescues me. [singing] My faith is strong and carries [music and singing] me. Though sometimes weak, I still believe. [singing and music] My life is built on his desire. Through the flood and through the fire, Jesus [music and singing] rescues me. My [music] life is [singing] built on this desire. Through the flood and through [music] the fire, Jesus [singing] rescues me. [music] &gt;&gt; Certainly appreciate our singers tonight, don't we? &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; Do we stand together? Let's sing a little chorus before our pastor comes tonight to bring us the word of the Lord. Who am I? Aren't you beginning to see who you are? &gt;&gt; Are you glad for identification? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad I belong to him. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I belong to him. Are you glad you belong to him tonight? Give him one more good hand clap of praise. Amen. [applause and music] Oh, who am I? that [music] the king would [singing] bleed and die for. Who am I that he would pray [music and singing] not my will thine? [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; The answer I'm beginning to [singing] know. [music] Why did you ever love me so [music] that to an old rugged cross it go [singing] for who am I? One more time if you will. Oh, tell me who am I that [music] the king would [singing] bleed and die for? [singing] [music] Yes. Who am I that he would [music] pray not my will thine? The answer we're all beginning to know why [music and singing] rugged [music] cross he would go for who am I? Praise the Lord. [music] Aren't you grateful for God's mercy to you &gt;&gt; and God's grace? Well, I'm sure glad to see y'all. How y'all been? &gt;&gt; Good, good, good, good. Glad to see. I miss you. I know you don't miss me cuz I beat on you all the time, but I miss you all. Heard you had some good services, Brother Pete and Brother Tim. It always does the pastor's heart good to know that the people were blessed and helped, and I'm grateful for that. Amen. Let us uh turn if you would tonight to Genesis chapter 24 verse 1, the bride's diary. And Abraham was old and wellstricken in age, and the Lord had blessed Abraham and all things. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had. So I guess if you wanted to be bride in that day, you had to listen to what this guy had to say. &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm just I'm just thinking that myself, you know, from reading this in the Bible. So he was put over his all of his goods, ruled over all that he had. Put I pray thee, thy hand under my side, and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son, of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell, but thou shalt go unto my country, to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son, the three eyes, my country, my kindred, my son Isaac." And the servant said unto him, "Per adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me into this land. Must thy needs bring thy son again unto the land from which thou camest." Now be careful, preachers. Be careful, preachers. What you going to do with the message of go get a bride? Are you going to bring the bride to him or take him to her and leave him there? You see, that's what a lot of our brothers in the message want to do. They want to include Catholics in the rapture. Baptist, I heard one say that not long ago. When the rapture takes place, there'll be Catholics, Baptist, Assembly of God, Church of God. That man don't even believe the message. &gt;&gt; If you believe that, why you think we need a message? So if a woman who prays to Mary for forgiveness can go in the rapture and you have to tow the line and you can't do this and can't do that and a person can pray to Mary and go in the same rapture you go into &gt;&gt; something wrong somewhere ain't they? [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Must thine needs bring thy son again into the land from which thou camest? And Abraham said unto him, &gt;&gt; "Beware, &gt;&gt; beware, beware that thou bring not my son thither again. the Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that swear unto me, saying unto thy seed, while I give this land, he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from then." So this message from Abraham to this servant to the bride was forran by an angel and it was divine intervention. Thou shalt take a wife unto my son from how many believes our message one dead wasp. Our message is the same way. &gt;&gt; It's not from a Kuckian. It's not from a hillbilly. &gt;&gt; It's not from a denomination. &gt;&gt; It's from God &gt;&gt; and an angel forun it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How many like to be remembered in prayer tonight as we go before the Lord. Heavenly Father, we thank you tonight for your word. Lord Jesus, we're so grateful that we have been given the privilege again this cold, damp, wet, windy night out there. Well, Lord, we're just grateful that we have a warm place where we can come and be able to assemble and pray and sing and just worship you and hear your word. We're just believing you tonight, Father, that you're going to speak to us and give us what we have need of. May the presence of God come and help me to get out of the way, Father, that you can minister through me to your children. I pray that you'd capture every heart. May we bring every thought into obedience to the spirit of God. May you minister to your children. Father, you see these prayer cloths that I have in my hand. You know each of these needs, dear God, and we're believing you to move because we believe you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. Granted, Father, may we be able to leave here tonight and say, "Did not our hearts burn within us as he talked with us along the way?" In the name of the Lord Jesus and the saints of God said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Praise the Lord. We believe that our God is a God of supernatural. We know that angels ever since that God brought them into view, even before the creation of man, they have been great instruments of ministration by which God would con contribute not only to the heavens but to the earth. They have intervened in many things about the human race. They have influenced, they have affected. Actually, there's even angels that the prophet called healing angels. There's angels that bring messages, angels that bring deliverance, angels that move on politicians hearts, &gt;&gt; angels that will move on kings that are absolute heathens and will bend and mold those men into the direct will of God. And when the angel gets done, they're probably wondering why they even did what they did. Now, we know then that God knew that once Satan was able to pull away, how many other angels that it was by his lies that he must also use his angels which are left in paradise to be able to influence man upon the earth. So he could not leave man here totally to just the knowledge of the word. Now the word is wonderful and God knew that he would allow a certain portion of the word to be written down. But he also knew that there would be that which was noted in the scripture according to Daniel chapter 10 noted in the scripture which would not actually be written down. So you see part of the scripture will never be actually written in the pages of the Bible because every word that comes from God is scripture. And there are some word that he never allowed to be written, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Judges, Joshua, on and on and on and on. But he would send it seasonally through a prophet. [laughter] Unlike some people who say they believe this message, I believe that a prophet of God can catch that which is unwritten and bring forth the mandate of the hour. And if you believe the Bible, you believe the same thing. Cuz you see, Paul was used by God to write things that nobody else said in the New Testament. Do you all believe that? Now, wait a minute. I thought you had to have two or three witnesses. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Come on now, Bible theologians. I thought we had to have two or three witnesses to prove every word. You see, if we don't place God's word in the right place, what we do? We make God's word a lie. &gt;&gt; Now, the angel of God is going to go before this messenger. He does not have the ability to be able the messenger to project this supernatural aura which will be necessary to get this woman's attention. He does not have the charisma. He does not have the magnetism, the ability to come and just sweep her off of her feet. He didn't actually need that. He could have been a pretty dumb fellow because the angel of God was going to go before him. We don't know if he's fat, if he's skinny, if he is ugly, if he couldn't hardly say good grammar. In reality, that didn't matter. All he needed to do was to bring the message of what the the prophet Abraham had told him to say. And the angel of God was going to prepare her heart and it would connect the message and the bride and the angelic anointing all in the same thing and it would be a divine response and it would change her life and the life of the rest of those people forever. Now, if we believe our God is doing something, I hope you understand this, even in a greater way now than what he did for Rebecca. Now, listen to me. It was an awesome thing what God did for Rebecca. But actually, it was just one woman. That was all that was affected by it at the time. So, how much greater would it be then if God would send a messenger with a message and there would be thousands times thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands that would hear that message and would respond to that message and would be called out into a sanctified state to be the bride not only for Isaac but for the Lord Jesus. Wouldn't that be greater in the eyes of God than now? Well, all we know is that this great messenger of God, a very simple man, a man that was a gentile, actually, wasn't even a Hebrew, a man that was a slave, this is what he was before Abraham actually redeemed him. So, the the the messenger himself experienced this great thing of redemption through what God had done through Abraham. So the messenger was redeemed. Then he packed the message of redemption down to Rebecca and brought Rebecca out of that land, out of all the sin, nature, and things that was around her and brought her into a land of promise. And remember, it's not because she deserved it. It's not because she was worthy. It's because God ordained her to have it. I want to tell you right here tonight, there ain't a person in this building that's worthy of eternal life, including the preacher preaching to you. There ain't none of us that's good enough. We'll never be good enough. We can never do enough to pay him back. We could never sing enough, pray enough, read the Bible enough, but you know what? If you've got eternal life tonight, God ordains you to have it. There ain't enough devils in hell to take it away from you. your shortcomings, your failures, your family. I don't care how bad your family was. Come on, somebody. It don't have nothing to do with that. IF GOD PUT YOUR name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world, there ain't enough devils in hell to take it all. There ain't enough people in America or in the world. It don't make no difference how many people don't like you. How many people hate you? That ain't got nothing to do with it. It's on the Lamb's Book of Life, which is his personal diary. As far as God's concerned, it's over. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. I said it's over. [applause] &gt;&gt; BUT NOW LOOK, GOD [screaming] KNEW THAT IT would take angelic intervention in so many of his dealings with humanity and God started allowing it to be unfolded here in the book of Genesis. Now we see it as it comes up into even through the last book of the Old Testament Malachi. But something happened in the New Testament in the New Testament is that and angelic appearances. It was like the seals broke loose off of the supernatural realm. And at the coming of the Lord Jesus, that angel started breaking forth in dreams and in visions and even in physical material appearances. THEY WOULD COME WITH MESSAGES. THEY WOULD COME AS ENCOURAGEMENT. They would come with rebukes sometime. So, you know, the people should have known and we realize that all the books were not written at the time and it was not common knowledge because it had not been accumulated yet like you and I could read it tonight. BUT YET, GOD WAS ALLOWING something great and phenomenal to happen. The angelic appearance and manifestation was bringing forth something that the Old Testament could not declare. It was the beginning of a new creation. Now the Lord Jesus of course his birth was announced by many things in his own visitation as well. But read with me if you would in the book of Mark 1:12. And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness. And he was there in the wilderness 40 days tempted of Satan and was with wild beast. Isn't this unusual? So the Lord Jesus was tempted by the devil and wild beasts were around him. I've always thought this is strange that Mark would put this in there. And was with wild beasts and the angels ministered to him. Now notice how low that our Lord Jesus had come into the act of condensation that the great Michael himself. Now remember Christ was Michael of the Old Testament. Now he is the chief prince. As a matter of fact, he is the only archangel that is mentioned by name in the Bible. And yet when he condenses sin from that heavenly angelic position as being the logos, HE COMES TO SUCH A DEGREE that Paul said that he was made lower than the angels. So he allows himself to be able to take on humanity. And when he does, he needs the lower angels to actually minister to him. &gt;&gt; NOW, THERE WAS SOMETHING GONE OUT OF HIM. SO, OKAY, he had not eaten. We don't know for sure if he had drank or not, but he had not eaten. He was weak. He went through temptation. Boy, the devil pounded him. Any of us that's been under heavy trials know what that does. It just leaves you so weak at times. AND THE LORD JESUS FOUND HIMSELF BEING WEAK in human strengths and maybe even skipping his own walk that he was just so depleted of divine energy because of where it condescended to. AND THE ANGELS OF GOD NOW THEY come down and they start ministering. So what did they do? We don't know. Were they giving him food like they did Elijah? Were they coming and touching him like they did Daniel? or were they touching him on the forehead the way they did Elijah? We really don't know. All we KNOW IS THAT MARK used this word as the other authors did as well, ministered to him. And the word is very broad. It's a very, you know, it's a very elaborate word, donos. It's the same word that we get deacon from. So it's a word that you can minister natural sustenance to an individual or you can minister divine strength which can only come from a supernatural being. So he allows himself to be ministered to. Now remember this is the beginning of a new dispensation. So he is opening up something not only for himself but for his seed who are going to follow in the same way. I don't mind telling you, friend, I believe that we need the advent of the angels of God in our lives like never before. &gt;&gt; AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY I BELIEVE THAT. BECAUSE DEMON powers have been released in a way like never before. And it's evident that the world is coming under more demonic control and demonic influence than they have ever been. THEN GOD KNOWS THAT THERE MUST BE on the other side to counterbalance that or we would never be able to stand it. If demonic power would constantly increase, INCREASE AND GOD WOULD keep the same level of angelic power at a very low Lutheran church age level, Wesley and church age level. BUT GOD KNEW IT MUST be an increase that they would come and minister to us strength like we never have had need of it before in our lives. You believe that is true? &gt;&gt; Now watch in Mark 13 26. And they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. THEN HE SHALL SEND his angels. Now watch what the angels are going TO DO. HE SHALL SEND HIS ANGELS AND SHALL GATHER TOGETHER his elect. Now, not non-elect, not foolish virgin, but he shall gather. You won't argue with this, up to you. But the this is the Bible. THAT HE SHALL GATHER HIS elect from the four winds. Now, notice where they're coming from. The four winds, north, south, east, and west. Also, from the outermost part of the earth to the outermost part of the heaven. So that shows us some of them would have already gone on passed away as we said and they are in the uttermost part of heaven waiting on what? Angels to come and get them. So those of us that are here and alive when the RAPTURE TAKES PLACE, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO NEED? Angels to carry us to the other side. Remember our loved ones do not make this journey when they go down the passage of death alone. But the angels of God are there to pack their soul into the presence of God. WE ALSO will need the angels of God when we get our body changed. Oh, praise the Lord. The angels of God. Now, listen. Whenever you recognize the very word of God is eagle food, you left the other thing and you heard from your theophony, which is your angel. IT WAS YOUR ANGEL that ushered you in to a word burst of the evening time. It will be your angel that will consummate the birth of your new body because you're going to have a body that is going to match your soul. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Notice in Luke 22:42 saying, "Father, if thou be willing," now here is in the garden OF GETHSEMANE. IF THOU BE WILLING, let this cup pass from me. Uh, nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done. And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, STRENGTHENING. NOTICE a different word, not ministering. STRENGTHENING, GIVING HIM STRENGTH. WHAT KIND OF STRENGTH? WHAT STRENGTH WAS IT? HE NEEDED strength to be able to accept and do the will of God. NOW, WHAT'S HE DONE? FATHER, PLEASE, IS THERE ANY WAY that somebody else can do this? He knew there wasn't no one that could do it. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S DOING? HE'S ALLOWING himself to feel like he knew his children would decades and and and church AGES ON BEYOND HIM. WHENEVER THEY SAY, "LORD, PLEASE don't make ME GO THROUGH THIS. LORD, PLEASE don't let this happen TO ME. PLEASE, LORD, DON'T DON'T DON'T. BUT IF THIS IS YOUR WILL, THEN LORD, help me and give me strength." SO, WHAT WAS HE DOING? HE'S THE FIRST ONE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. HE'S THE SANCTIFIER AND HE'S making a pattern for the sanctified that are going to come behind him. And he is condescended TO SUCH A LEVEL THAT he needed strength. AND HE ALLOWED a being which was weaker than himself before his incarnation to be able to mentor. Lord children, I wish you could understand what I'M SAYING TONIGHT. YOU IMAGINE WHAT A CONDENSATION THIS WAS. HE MADE THEM ANGELS. HE WAS THE ONE WHO CREATED THEM. AND NOW THEY are ministering back to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. Notice now after his resurrection in Matthew chap 28 2. AND BEHOLD, THERE WAS A GREAT EARTHQUAKE FOR THE ANGEL of the Lord descended from heaven. Now notice the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. THERE WAS AN earthquake and an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled BACK THE STONE. JESUS DIDN'T roll back his own rock. &gt;&gt; Couldn't do it from THE INSIDE. &gt;&gt; SO GOD SENT DOWN an angel and the ANGEL WAS ON THE OUTSIDE and broke the seal. THE ROMAN SEAL WASN'T ON THE INSIDE. The Roman SEAL WAS ON THE OUTSIDE. SO THE ANGEL PULLED BACK THE seal and when he did, he rolled the Oh, glory to God. When he did, HE ROLLED BACK THE STONE AND THAT RELEASED the word to walk out the living word. What did it? An angel of God. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. OH, YOU KNOW, HE COULD HAVE SPOKE IF THAT'S WHAT HE HAD WANTED TO DO. BUT AN ANGEL WAS WHAT OPENED and broke that Roman seal. My my. And the angel answered and said unto the women, "FEAR YE NOT, FOR I KNOW THAT YOU SEEK Jesus which was crucified." Notice now one angel comes down. And here we have where that an angel answered and the women are there seeking for Jesus. And he said, "I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified." AND THE ANGEL IS NOW GIVING THEM A MESSAGE. He's not here. He is risen. ST. JOHN 20:1 BUT MARY stood without at the sepre weeping and as SHE WEPT SHE STOOPED down and looked into the separ [sighs] and seeth two angels. All right. Now, let's let's do to the Bible &gt;&gt; what those who hate the message and have left the message do to the message. Matthew said there was one. &gt;&gt; John said there was two. &gt;&gt; So, reckon which one of them was a liar? &gt;&gt; Testing. One, two, three. Testing. You believe the Bible's perfect, right? &gt;&gt; Without mistake, without fault. &gt;&gt; So she seeth two angels in white, the one sitting at the head and the other at the feet. Matthew didn't say that. where the body of Jesus had lain. I'm glad there's four gospels &gt;&gt; because each of these men wrote in their own way and the way they did it. One of them says the robe is scarred and another said it was purple. Study your BIBLE SOMETIMES. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I'VE SENT some of these to these heathens that have left the message and told them IF YOU DON'T DO THE BIBLE THE same way you do the message, you're a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; Come on. Of course, I've got some emails back from them. They done everything but cuss me, &gt;&gt; call me every name that you can imagine, and then they want me to leave this and follow them. No thanks. I want to be more like Jesus, not more like the devil. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they, not he, THEY SAY UNTO HER, WOMAN, WHY WEEPEST THOU? SHE SAITH unto them. BUT HOW COME MATTHEW DIDN'T SAY THERE WAS A THEM? HOW COME HE SAID THERE'S A HIM? &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, friends. You didn't know this is in your Bible. IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO UNDERSTAND GOD EVEN BY READING YOUR BIBLE, YOU'RE AS CRAZY AS A LUNATIC. YOU CAN KNOW YOUR BIBLE FRONTWARDS AND BACKWARDS. AND WHEN YOU GET DONE REALLY KNOWING IT, YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF FAITH TO still believe there's a God. &gt;&gt; AND YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE FAITH IN HIS BOOK AND KNOW THAT YOUR GOD COULD NOT GIVE YOU A BOOK THAT WAS CORRUPTED AND ROTTEN. YOU DON'T KNOW GOD BY QUOTING HIS BIBLE. YOU DON'T KNOW GOD BY THE GREEK AND THE ARAMAIC AND THE HEBREW. YOU KNOW HIM BY DIVINE REVELATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause] WOO. AND THEY SAY UNTO HER, WOMAN, WHY WEEPEST THOU? SHE SAITH unto them, because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. And when she HAD THUS SAID, SHE turned herself back and saw Jesus standing, &gt;&gt; and knew not that it was Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at the book of Acts. Acts chapter 5:1 18. AND THEY LAID THEIR HANDS ON THE APOSTLES AND PUT THEM IN THE COMMON PRISON. But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors. Praise God. How many believe he can still open them? &gt;&gt; AND BROUGHT THEM FORTH and said, "Go stand in the temple to the people." No, to speak. You got to be KIDDING ME. SO AFTER THEY get arrested and they PUT THEM IN THE PRISON, THE ANGEL OF GOD SETS THEM FREE. SAID, "NOW GO BACK DOWN THERE AND PREACH TO THEM AGAIN. Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life." And when they had heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught. Well, I reckon if an angel of God told you to do it, you'd do it, right? Chapter 8, 26. AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SPAKE UNTO PHILILLIP, SAYING, "ARISE, and go toward the south, unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert." And he arose, and went, and behold, a man of Ethiopia, an Enoch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, had come to Jerusalem for to worship. Well, he went to Jerusalem to worship and left empty-handed. &gt;&gt; HE'D BEEN UP AT ALL THE DDS, ALL THE COLLEGE GUYS, AND ALL THIS, THAT, AND THE OTHER. BUT GOD HAD A MAN that he sent down there. And how did he do? By an angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD LED HIM down there. Now remember, THE ANGEL HIMSELF COULD NOT PREACH THE GOSPEL. THE ANGEL HIMSELF COULD NOT BAPTIZE HIM. BUT THE ANGEL TOLD PHILILLIP, "You get down there to Gaza." Amen. Notice Acts chapter 10 verse one. And there was a certain man in Cesaria called Cornelius, a centurion of the Italian band. THIS IS OUR BROTHERS. THIS IS WHAT THE ALPHA BRIDE STARTED IN THE FOUR GOSPELS AND IN THE BOOK OF ACTS. ONE MANIFESTATION AFTER another of the ANGELS OF GOD. MORE HERE THAN WHAT YOU FIND IN the entire cannon of the Old Testament. A devout man and one that feared God with all his house, WHICH GAVE MUCH ARMS to the people and prayed to God always. He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God. Notice it's just coming at random times. And it's not all to prophets. It's not all TO MESSENGERS, TO GENTILES AS WELL AS JEWS. GOD SAYING SOMETHING. WHAT'S HE SAYING? WHAT'S HE USING TO SAY IT? Angelic manifestation. ANGELIC MANIFESTATION IS CROSSING THE BOUNDARIES WHICH BEFORE THE JEWS SAY, "HEY, we're the holy people of God. We're the only one that gets angels around here. We're the only one that gets this and that." But God said, "I'M DOING SOMETHING NEW. I'M CHANGING. I I'M BRINGING IN SOMETHING. I'M CALLING A BRIDE OUT FOR MY NAME. I'M GOING TO LET THE ANGELS VISIT THE GENTILES. Can you imagine how astounding this was to the Jews? A centurion in the band called the Italian band. A a man and an officer of the Roman army. And he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming into him and saying unto him, Cornelius. And when he looked on him, he was afraid and said, "What is it, Lord?" And he said unto HIM, "THY PRAYERS AND THINE ARMS ARE come up for a memorial before God. NOW SEND A JAPA AND CALL FOR ONE SIMON whose surname IS PETER. HE LODGETH WITH ONE SIMON a tanner, whose house is by the seaside. He shalt tell THEE WHAT THOU OUGHTEST TO DO. ISN'T THIS STRANGE? THE ANGEL OF GOD COULD TELL HIM THE MAN. He could tell him where he was. HE COULD TELL HIM THE NAME OF the man that he was staying with, but he couldn't tell him what to do to get right with God. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHY? [screaming] PETER WAS PART OF THE BODY. THE ANGEL AS HIGH AND HOLY AS HE WAS, HE DID NOT HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HE did not HAVE THE SEED LIFE. [screaming] GOD HAD NOW TRANSMITTED HIS OWN SPERM INTO HIS MYSTICAL BODY ON THE EARTH. AND IN ORDER FOR [screaming] GOD TO BRING FORTH ANOTHER SON, IT HAD TO COME THROUGH HIS WIFE, HIS BODY ON the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise [laughter] be to God. Oh, glory to God. Thank you, Lord. And when THE ANGEL WHICH SPAKE unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually, and they went and declared all these things unto them, and he sent them to Japa. Verse 22. AND THEY SAID, CORNELIUS, THE CENTURION, a just man, and one that fearth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for thee. Now, they get up there to Peter and they've got to relate the same thing. And you imagine, Peter, you mean to tell me God sent you all an angel? Why in the world didn't he tell you what you need to do? WHAT THE ANGEL WOULD HAVE SAID BEEN FAR MORE PERFECT than Peter? any sermon Peter ever preached. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A VOCATION THAT GOD DEFINES YOU AS being foolish &gt;&gt; and what you're doing is foolishness. &gt;&gt; Welcome preachers to one of the most foolish jobs there is in the world, preaching. &gt;&gt; I AIN'T NEVER PREACHED A PERFECT SERMON IN MY LIFE AND NEVER WILL. YOU IMAGINE I PREACHED 51 YEARS AND NEVER ONE PERFECT SERMON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And the older I get, the worse they'll probably get. &gt;&gt; But that's all right. Some of y'all's getting so old you won't know it anyway. You'll say, "What he say, honey? What he say?" I don't know. I COULDN'T HEAR HIM. What he say? Turn the volume. I don't know what he say. At least we're all getting old together. &gt;&gt; You imagine NOW ON THE MARA PETER went away with them and certain brethren from Japa accompanied him. CHAPTER 12 VERSE 6. AND WHAT HEROD WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HIM FORTH the same night Peter was sleeping BETWEEN TWO SOLDIERS BOUND WITH TWO chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison. I mean, they got him locked up good, AIN'T THEY? AND BEHOLD, THE ANGEL OF THE LORD came upon him, and a light shined in the prison, AND HE SMOKED PETER ON THE SIDE. GET UP, PREACHER. SMOTE HIM ON THE SIDE. WHY IN the world could he have been a little bit more gentle? Just kind of rubbed him on the head. Must have been a sound sleeper. &gt;&gt; SO HE SMOTEED HIM ON THE SIDE. WOW, IT MUST BE NICE. SMOTE HIM ON THE SIDE AND RAISE HIM UP, SAYING, "RISE UP QUICKLY." AND HIS CHAINS FELL OFF. GLORY TO GOD. HIS CHAINS FELL OFF FROM HIS HAND. LOOK AT WHAT POWER [screaming] THE ANGELS OF GOD CAN DO. AND MINISTER SAY, "BROTHER D, I WISH YOU'D SEND MY THERE AIN'T NO TELLING how many times IN YOUR LIFE THAT ALMIGHTY GOD HAS SENT ANGELS YOUR WAY, BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM IN A PHYSICAL FORM OR YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM IN A LIGHT, BUT THEY WERE THERE NONETHELESS BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ELECT OF GOD JUST LIKE PETER WAS, JUST LIKE CORNELIUS WAS." AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THE ANGEL SAID UNTO HIM, "GUARD THYSELF, AND BIND ON THY SANDALS." And so he did. And he SAITH UNTO HIM, "CAST THY GARMENT ABOUT THEE, AND FOLLOW ME." AND HE WENT OUT AND FOLLOWED HIM, AND WENT NOT that it was true, which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision. AND WHEN THEY WERE PASSED THE FIRST AND THE SECOND WARD, THEY CAME INTO THE IRON GATE THAT lead us into the city, which opened to them of his own accord. I'll tell you one thing, if I ever get in trouble, I want to have a companion like this in there with me, don't you? &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. I'M TALKING ABOUT the same God that can open gates of their own accord. YOURS MAY NOT BE AN iron gate. It might be a TB gate or a cancer gate or or a sickness or an oppression. I believe the angels of God ARE RIGHT HERE TONIGHT TO PASS BY RIGHT AMONG US. OH, I KNOW IT'S COLD AND WET AND WE GOT FOLKS THAT ARE SICK AND THAT THE OTHER, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ALL GOT READY AND COME TO CHURCH. I'VE BEEN SETTING FOR HOURS AND HOURS ON THIS SERMON. I say we go ahead and have church. I JUST SAY WE CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE IN HERE WHERE THE LORD JESUS CAN SEND OUT ANGELS AND LET THEM WALK UP AND DOWN THESE AISLES AND MINISTER TO US AND OPEN THE GATES FOR US. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh, [laughter] thank you, LORD JESUS. THEY WENT OUT AND PASSED ON THROUGH ONE STREET AND FOR THE ANGEL DEPARTED from him. Well, I reckon he knew where he's at. So, he said, "I'll see you. I'll see him. I'll catch back up sometime later." THOUGH THE ANGEL OF GOD GOT HIM OUT. HE JUST LEFT HIM. AND WHEN PETER WAS COME TO HIMSELF, PRAISE GOD. WHEN PETER WAS COME TO HIMSELF, HE SAID, "NOW I KNOW OF ASSURITYITY THAT THE LORD HATH SENT HIS ANGEL and hath delivered me out of the hand OF HEROD." AND FROM ALL THE expectation of the people of the Jews, oh, I hope AND PRAY TO GOD THAT SOMEBODY WILL BE ABLE TO LEAVE THIS PLACE TONIGHT AND SAY, "I KNOW OF ASSURITYITY THAT THE LORD SENT HIS ANGEL in the service THIS NIGHT, AND I AM HEALED OF THIS. I AM DELIVERED OF THAT. I AM SET FREE FROM THAT. IS HE the same God? &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE SIN, HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF MARY, THE MOTHER OF JOHN, WHOSE SURNAME WAS MARK, where many were gathered together praying. AND AS PETER KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE GATE, A DAMSEL CAME TO HEARKEN named Roa. And when she knew Peter's voice, SHE OPENED NOT THE GATE FOR GLADNESS, but ran in AND TOLD HOW PETER SAID BEFORE THE GATE. Just like Christians, God answered their prayers, but they DON'T BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; OH [screaming] GOD, OH GOD, HAVE MERCY ON PETER. GOD COULDN'T ANSWER THAT PRAYER. HE done answered it. I wonder how many of us have prayed and prayed and prayed and the answer is done THERE AND WE'RE S OH [screaming] GOD WE GET IN THAT VOICE AND HEY GOD I PRAY IN THE NAME OF JESUS OH LORD God saying why don't you put that thing off the answer is at the gate &gt;&gt; and as Peter knocked at the door of the gate The damsel came to hearken named Roa. And when SHE KNEW PETER'S VOICE, SHE OPENED NOT THE GATE FOR GLADNESS. She just so happy and set free. She just left him standing on the outside, BUT RAN IN AND TOLD HOW PETER STOOD BEFORE THE GATE. AND THEY SAID UNTO HER, "THOU ART [screaming] MAD." DON'T YOU TELL ME GOD HAS ANSWERED MY PRAYERS THAT QUICK. THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS WITH ME. IT'S 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS OF LABOR AND INTENSIVE SWEATING AND PERSPIRATION. GOD ALWAYS MAKES ME SYNDROME. I'M TELLING YOU, GOD'S ALREADY ANSWERED IT. THEIR ANSWER IS STANDING AT THE DOOR. [laughter] THE ANSWER IS STANDING AT THE DOOR. THEY SAID, "YOU'RE CRAZY." &gt;&gt; They said unto her, "Thou art mad." But she constantly affirmed it was even so. &gt;&gt; Believe it or not, that's what I'm going to do tonight. I'm going to constantly affirm he's your healer. He's your deliverer. I don't care what you got need of tonight. I don't care what you're dealing with. I don't care how much pain. I I you know, all all that's may be real, but I believe our God is bigger than ever headache. I believe he's bigger than ever pain, every sadness, ever sorrow. Come on, somebody. You may be FACING SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE in your life. AND IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. YOU THINK, "OH, IT'S GOING TO DESTROY ME." OR YOU CAN LOOK AT AND SAY, "WAIT A MINUTE. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MY FAITH TO RISE TO THAT LEVEL AND watch God MOVE ON THE SCENE AND TURN THIS THING RIGHT AROUND. WHAT GOD HALLELUJAH, WHAT SATAN INTENDED FOR A CURSE, GOD TURNED IT RIGHT AROUND INTO A BLESSING. &gt;&gt; BUT SHE CONSTANTLY AFFIRMED it was even so. THEN SAID THEY, "OH GOD, HE'S DIED." It's his angel. Dear God, [gasps] what are we going to do? Roa said, "He's waiting." I SAID, "SHUT UP, [screaming] GIRL. WE GOT TO SEE WHO'S GOING TO PREACH A FUNERAL. Who's going to do the funeral dinner? Who who's going to sing?" She said, "You ain't going to need no funeral or dinner. &gt;&gt; It's Peter out there." &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, it ain't Jesus out there. It's Jesus right in you. [sighs] But Peter continued knocking. They said, "WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE STOP THAT? WE'RE PRAYING. [screaming] WE'RE HAVING A PRAYER week for our brother. Oh God, have mercy on him. Lord God is a saints. Saints, somebody open the door and LET ME IN. COME [screaming] ON, SOMEBODY. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And when they opened the door and saw him, they were. But there was one person there that wasn't astonished. Roa. She had heard, but now she seen. &gt;&gt; She could have said, "I tried to tell you all there's the apostle standing up there. There's the deacon boy. There's the trustees. They're all harmonizing in prayer. They're all going, you know, this and that and the other. She said, I'm telling you, he's out there. GOD, I HEARD YOUR IT DON'T WORK THAT WAY. THERE'S NO WAY THAT HE'S OUT OF THERE. HE'S BEHIND THE FIRST WARD AND THE SECOND WARD AND THE third ward AND THE IRON GATE. HE'S THERE. SHE SAID, I JUST SEEN HIM. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU A CRAZY GIRL? But he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, "Go show these things unto James and to the brethren." And he departed and went into another place. Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers. what was become of Peter. So you imagine them old boys that was sitting in there locked up on one side. One one soldier sitting on this side locked to Peter. Another one sitting on this side locked to Peter. People soldiers sitting here at arm gates are on the other. They got up the next morning said what in the what? He disappeared. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. I LIKE THAT DISAPPEARING ACT. I hope I'm alive one day when THE DEVIL'S GOING TO TRY TO AGGRAVATE ME AND AGGRAVATE YOU AND DO ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO US AND HE'S GOING TO SPRING IT ON THIS CERTAIN CERTAIN DAY AND HE COMES TO MY HOUSE AND RINGS THE DOORBELL. DONNIE AIN'T THERE. CAROL AIN'T THERE. TRIES to get in the house, GET IN THE GARAGE DOOR. HE SAID, "WHAT IN THE WORLD'S HAPPENED TO HIM? TODAY IS MY DAY." AND WHAT HAPPENED? MY MY ONE MORNING I WAS THERE. THE NEXT MOMENT I WAS GONE. SO PETER WAS THERE. THEY KNEW HE WAS THERE. THEY FELT HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE. THEY SAT RIGHT THERE. OH MY HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, CHILDREN. THE DEVIL MAY DONE HAVE YOU GRAVE MARKED OUT. HE MAY DONE HAVE YOUR CASKET PICKED OUT AND YOUR FLOWERS AND THE DRESS YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR. AND THE LORD JESUS SHOWS UP AND SAID, "COME ON, HONEY. COME ON. LET ME TAKE YOU OUT OF THIS SICKNESS. LET ME TAKE YOU OUT OF THIS TROUBLE THAT YOU'RE IN." AND THE DEVIL SAID, "WHAT IN THE WORLD HAPPENED TO HER? WHERE DID HE GO? OH MY GOODNESS. I DONE HAD THIS CASKET MADE AND THERE AIN'T NOBODY IN IT. PUT IN IT WHO YOU WANT, DEVIL. BUT IT AIN'T ME. IT AIN'T ME. YOU AIN'T PUTTING ME IN NO DENOMINATIONAL GRAVE. YOU AIN'T PUT ME IN NO DENOMINATIONAL CASKET. JESUS DONE GRABBED A HOLD OF MY HEAD AND SAID, "COME ON, DONNIE. LET'S GO." HALLELUJAH. Thank you, Lord. There won't be no small stir &gt;&gt; whenever I'm gone. &gt;&gt; There won't be no small stir in Johnson City. When the elect out of word of life are gone and the elect from Germany and the elect from Africa and the elect from all over the world, there won't be no small stir. [gasps] &gt;&gt; Cuz them people that hate us so bad, they're going to say, "Oh Lord have mercy. What in the world have I done? What in the world have I said? I had the opportunity to go there. I call that man a devil. I call that prophet a liar. Lord God, have mercy on my soul. I ain't going to be saying that. I'm saying it now. Lord God, have mercy. Open my eyes. Bring me out of this world, Lord. &gt;&gt; Woo. Acts 27:22. AND HOW I EXHORT YOU TO BE ONE OF GOOD CHEER, for there SHALL BE NO LOSS of any man's life among you, but of the ship. And I remind you, we're talking about Paul now. And he's been on this ship, and they've had this tremendous storm for days and nights. For there stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and whom I serve. Lord children, can't you see why the Lord wants us to know who we are? When we can stand our ground and the raw waves as a rock in the boat and tossing it around and we can look around and say there won't be one lost. Let me tell you right now, there won't be one of God's sheep lost. There won't be one elect member of the BRIDE OF CHRIST LOST. NOT ONE. &gt;&gt; NO, SIR. NOTICE. Oh my. HE SAYS, "THE ANGEL OF GOD WHOSE I AM AND WHOM I serve, SAYING, FEAR NOT, PAUL, THOU MUST BE brought before Caesar, AND LO GOD HATH GIVEN thee all them that sail with thee." I've often said before, it'll be a bad deal if it's my time to go and I'm flying across the Atlantic. I hope all the rest of them people none of that plane's going to be ready. But if IT SO HAPPENS THAT IT'S SOMEBODY I'M FLYING WITH and it's their time to go, I figure God can save one life if he don't save none of the rest of them. Cuz the devil can't take you. All the planes going down, we're crashing. We ain't got no fuel. My God is not going to let the devil outsmart him. He ain't going to let him take me until my life has completed God's purpose. I don't believe that just about me. I believe that about you. &gt;&gt; YOU IMAGINE WHAT CONFIDENCE THIS MAN could have in hearing brother Daryl in his voice. Praise God. Wherefore, sir, be of good cheer. &gt;&gt; Yeah, right. We're all seasick. I mean, the boats taken in water. The the sails have beat all to pieces. And you're TELLING US TO BE of good cheer, sir. I love that real true Christians are so courteous. &gt;&gt; NOTICE HE SAID, "YOU BUNCH OF INFIDELS. IF IT WASN'T FOR ME, YOU WOULD ALL WIND UP IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. YOU OUGHT TO BE SO GRATEFUL FOR ME. I'll tell you one thing." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it hadn't been for Paul, God would have killed every one of them. &gt;&gt; But God gave them to Paul. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet he didn't act like the master. He turns right around and says, "Sers, a lot of message folks could learn a little bit about respect. &gt;&gt; I ain't just talking about the preachers. I'm just talking about the humanity. &gt;&gt; Be nice to them." &gt;&gt; God knows a lot of them. That's all they're going to have. They ain't going to have nothing in this LIFE TO COME. WHEREFORE SERS, BE OF GOOD CHEER. [sighs] LISTEN TO THIS. FOR I believe God. &gt;&gt; Don't misunderstand me. It didn't make no difference where they believed or not. &gt;&gt; He didn't even tell them to be believe. &gt;&gt; He just said, "Be of good cheer. You're saved cuz God gave you to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; For I believe God. Wow. When the bride can come to her PLACE IN SUCH A POSITION, NOT BRAGGING, NOT of her own arrogance, but by revelation from God, that the bride can say SUCH A THING. WHEREFORE, SIR, BE OF GOOD CHEER, FOR I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me. Notice he don't say, "Y'all believe. Y'all believe with me now, right?" Okay. Now, if you don't BELIEVE WITH ME NOW, Y'ALL CAN'T BE SAVED. THAT'S NOT what the angel told him. &gt;&gt; He said, "As long as they b in the ship, everything's going to be good. I give them to you." Revelation 1 verse one. The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass. And he sent and signified it by his angel singular unto his servant John. Now, angels are sent to earth to intervene many times in man's affairs. Sent to the earth to intervene in man's affairs. Watch this. In the healing line, 1953, you believe that he is here. It's a cancerous condition. And that man sitting right there has the same thing. Them demons are screaming one to another. You see, for pity, MERCY, THEY'RE CALLING. So is the angels of God calling. THE BATTLE is [screaming] here. Your faith will determine which way it goes. Now, here in this building, under this discernment, a person standing up there has cancer. That demon screams out for mercy or for pity or help. And there's another man sitting out there that has a cancerous demon as well. And he said, "Them demons are screaming one to another." Now, they might have been demons, but at least they're smart enough to know when they're outnumbered. Amen. &gt;&gt; They like a lot of message people. They just backslide and totally quit coming to church and don't reach out for help for nobody. And then they get in office shape ever was and they pick up the phone and call brother Rob or call brother Joe or call whoever. I I really need help. You should have done that six months ago before he got so cold. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I want you to notice them demons. They knew. They knew THIS GIFT THAT GOD HAD SENT to the earth was so powerful they could not withstand it. I find that so amazing if he's supposed to be a false prophet. &gt;&gt; SO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THE greatest gift from a gentile prophet, never another like it on the face of the earth and never will be. And the greatest prophetic gift next to the Lord Jesus that ever struck the earth was a false prophet and not a true prophet. So you mean the devil outdone God when it come to prophetic gifts? &gt;&gt; Well, if that's so, shouldn't we be serving the devil &gt;&gt; if he's bigger than God? And I mean I mean God God has no other promise that he's going to send a prophet like this anyway. AND AND THE ONE who had the greatest gifts and greatest anointing outside of the Lord Jesus wound up being a false one. Now here's powerful demons. THEY ARE PRINCIPALITIES archo of the principle and original order of the creation of angels. PRINCIPALITIES, POWERS, rulers of the darkness of this world. And here's also the angels OF GOD. SO DEMONS are screaming, "Help me, help me, help me." And the angels of God are also there. Listen to what he says now. So the angels of God are calling. Calling what? Calling who? Well, they're not calling to the demons, right? Who are they calling to? The people who need help. Now, here's demons and HERE'S THE ANGELS OF GOD. Both of them can appear, disappear, travel dimensionally, CAN DO ALL KINDS OF SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS, BOTH demons and angels of God, but they will not determine the outcome. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE ANGELS OF GOD, AS STRONG AS THEY ARE, CANNOT DETERMINE THE OUTCOME. &gt;&gt; THE DEMONS OUT OF HELL, CANNOT determine the outcome. &gt;&gt; But who will determine the outcome? The battle is here. He says, now your faith will determine which way it goes. SO THE ANGELS OF GOD CAN'T DETERMINE IT. THE DEMONS OF HELL. WELL, THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT. NO, the devil can't make you do anything you don't want to do. &gt;&gt; But you want to do it, and you blame it on the devil. &gt;&gt; Preach, Brother Donnie. If you don't want to do wrong, ain't enough devils in hell that can make you do it. You have to surrender. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Notice again now in [clears throat] when it comes to this demonic realm, I have to be the first one to confess to you. No doubt most of us know very very little about it. But let's read if we can in Daniel 10:10. Now sometimes the angels of God can't get to us. They just can't get to us whenever maybe we think they should. Daniel 10:10. And behold, a hand touched me which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. AND HE SAID UNTO ME, OH DANIEL, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright. For unto them I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling. THEN HE SAID UNTO ME, "FEAR NOT, DANIEL, FOR FROM THE FIRST day that thou didest set thine heart to understand and chasen thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words." So the very first words that Gabriel, this is Gabriel, the very first words that Gabriel says to Daniel, it is an explanation of his delay. Are you kidding me? The mighty angel Gabriel comes down here to Daniel and HIS FIRST WORDS BEFORE HE TELLS HIM WHY HE'S THERE, BEFORE HE gives him an understanding of that which is noted in the scripture, the very first thing he says, I want to explain to you why it's been 21 days. Are you kidding me? God owes us anything. But I want you to see what a position a prophet holds in God's eyes. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS ANGEL WHICH HAD NEVER THOUGHT A BAD THOUGHT, NEVER SINNED, [clears throat] sent down to a man called Daniel and he's explaining something to him. I'm late. Sorry. &gt;&gt; I'm late. But I wanted to let you know why he's late. [snorts] Are you kidding me? An angel of God is telling a mortal human being why he's late. Now he SAID, 'THE REASON I'M HERE, notice the last few words there, verse 12, I am come for thy words. Daniel pulled Gabriel out of heaven. I am come for thy words. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withtood me one and 20 days. Now remember who this is. THIS IS NOT A LOWER RANKING devil or a lower ranking angel. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A HIGH PRIEST. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GABRIEL. GABRIEL. And yet a demon of greater hierarchy withstood him and he couldn't get through. Oh my goodness. I'll tell you friends, we need the angels of God to help us. &gt;&gt; If Gabriel couldn't get through, what makes you and I think we can get through without supernatural help from Almighty God? We can't do this on our own. WE CAN'T DO IT BY KNOWING THE BIBLE. WE CAN'T DO IT BY MEMORIZING THE MESSAGE. WE CAN'T DO IT JUST BY PRESSING PLAY. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE DIVINE INTERVENTION IN OUR LIVES OR WE'LL never make the grade. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now explains to him what happened. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia, the prince of the kingdom of Persia withtood me one and 20 DAYS. BUT LO, MICHAEL. MICHAEL, and the word Michael means one like God. One of the chief princes came to help me. Gabriel needs help. If Gabriel needs it, Donnie needs it. One of the chief PRINCES CAME TO HELP ME and I remain there with the kings of Persia. Now remember Gabriel Gabriel's business in the court of Persia was to work on the minds of the king Cyrus and also on the chief leaders there in the province. NOW REMEMBER GOD had a word. Amen. AND IT WAS GETTING time for that word to be fulfilled. AND THAT WORD was the word of Jeremiah WHEN JEREMIAH SAID, "YOU'LL GO down there and you'll be down there for 70 years." And that time was rolling around for them to go back and rebuild the house of God. But the prince, this demon was there in the court and he was trying to stop this word in its season from being fulfilled. So, Michael had to come down and take over and release Gabriel to go down and explain to Daniel [panting and gasps] what was going on. And after he got the message DELIVERED THAT HE TOLD HIM, I SAID, "I'M GOING TO GO back and I'm going to fight." Lord, have mercy, CHILDREN. YOU SEE WHAT HE'S THERE FOR? HE'S THERE TO INFLUENCE THE KING of Persia and his nobles. But while he's there, and they're just talking politics and this and that and the other, and they'd get TO ARGUING AND FUSSING BACK AND FORTH AND BACK AND FORTH, AND THEY'RE JUST THINKING, "OH, I DON'T LIKE HIS POLITICS. I DON'T LIKE WHAT HE SAYS. THEY don't even realize the angels of God are there at the throne of the king. The angels of God are sitting there around the nobles table and they're discussing, "Oh, we're going to do this." DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS AT the White House. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS AT THE UN. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THAT'S WHY THE UN AND MANY OF THESE NATIONS OF THE WORLD, WHY THEY SO HATE ISRAEL? BECAUSE THEM NATIONS, THEY come to the UN. And most of them nations have a demon that'll come there with them. And them demons hate Israel. And they will come and they more more amendments from the UN voted against Israel than ALL THE REST OF THE NATIONS PUT TOGETHER. IT'S NOT JUST A GATHERING OF THE MEN OF THE EMBASSY. IT'S A GATHERING TOGETHER OF DEMONS OUT OF HELL. AND THEY HATE ISRAEL. OH MY. HALLELUJAH. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. THAT'S EXACTLY SOMETIMES WHY YOU HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME PRAYING. WHY YOU HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME COMING TO CHURCH BECAUSE IT'S A GATHERING AROUND THE TABLE OF GOD. AND THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE WANT US TO COME TOGETHER TO FEAST AND TO BE STRENGTHENED AND THE DEMONS ARE FIGHTING YOU AND THEY'LL CAUSE YOU TO STAY HOME WITH A HEADACHE OR A BACKACHCHE OR SOMEBODY HURT YOUR FEELING. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHO'S AT THE COUNSELING TABLE AND WHAT VALUE IT IS TO GATHER TOGETHER, CHILDREN? Oh [laughter] my. [applause] YOU SEE, GABRIEL IS THERE and he's trying to influence the king and the king is getting these thoughts. You know, we we need to do this for these these Jews. I mean, we need to do it. Now, they're said, "What? We don't WHAT THE NO WAY. WHY THEM PEOPLE? THEY'RE THEY'RE THE THEY'RE THE filth of the world. They're just this and that and the other." Don't you understand what got on Hitler? DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S ALREADY HERE RIGHT NOW? ANTI-SEMITISM FRIENDS, IT'S INCREASED MANY, MANY HUNDREDS OF TIMES, JUST SINCE OCTOBER THE 7TH. WHY? That anointing is still here on the earth. &gt;&gt; Them demons that hate them Jews are still here. How much more do they hate the bride? But the feelings are mutual. We hate every one of them, too. Praise be to God. I've done looked at my armament several times. I found a sword. I found a shield. I found a helmet. I found grief. I found ALL KINDS OF THINGS. I'VE LOOKED in the front pocket, the back pocket, the side pocket. I've looked hidden everywhere. I ain't never found a white flag of surrender that I was issued in the army of the Lord. SO APPARENTLY THAT MEANS I AIN'T NEVER SUPPOSED TO SURRENDER. AND I'VE DONE FOUND OUT THERE AIN'T NOTHING ON MY BACK BECAUSE GOD DON'T WANT ME RUNNING FROM THE DEVIL. GOD DON'T WANT YOU RUNNING FROM THE DEVIL. HE WANTS YOU FACING HIM AND SAY, "BACK OFF. GIVE ME MY SON. GIVE ME MY DAUGHTER. GIVE ME MY HUSBAND. TURN THEM LOOSE, DEVIL. I'M COMING AFTER MY MY CHILDREN, MY FAMILY. MEET THEM FACE TO FACE. [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; You see the time, the message of the hour of their hour was a thought from God that it was time to go back and rebuild the temple. And them [clears throat] DEMONS WILL SAY, "NO, NO, NO, NO." SO WHAT WOULD they do? Get on them politicians. And then them politicians, they say, "I'll tell one thing. These bunch of Jews, they're this and that and the other." And them demons would get on this guy and get on that senator and get on that guy and that guy and there's Gabriel in there and he'd find one over here and he'd find the King Cyrus and find one over there and now brethren, brethren, you know, I mean, these people really ain't done anything. We ain't really got no proof of it. Now, I just want to tell you here, I I guess I should just let you know this that that I couldn't find anywhere where the Courier Journal was able to authenticate that Daniel actually saw this angel. And I couldn't find on Snoops nowhere where that actually they have any proof that this angel came to Daniel. And I realize we can only take Daniel's word for it. &gt;&gt; And we're supposed to have two or three witnesses, right? Come on. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I love smelling fried devil hide. &gt;&gt; Come on, children. SO, THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS THERE. IS THERE S AN ANGEL? AND GABRIEL IS THERE IN these intense meetings and Daniel's crying and he's praying. Why didn't God send another one? Because Gabriel is the angel sent about Jewish affairs. So, he's really busy at the temple there. And here's Daniel in the same kingdom. You imagine he's so tied up though in politics because it's so important. And one that Daniel wasn't important. Can't you see why I explained it to him? He said, "Daniel, you're beloved. God loves you so much. &gt;&gt; Now, I wonder why he would say that. Sister, go reckon he was down. He's just kind of weary and says, "The Lord must not love me. I mean, I've been praying for three weeks. I've afflicted my soul. I fasted. I've went through this terrible time. I ain't heard a word from the Lord." And he said, "Oh, Daniel, you're greatly beloved. You're not just loved, but you're beloved. Beloved, &gt;&gt; he loves you with a special love which is even above the rest of the people that are here. But I was just busy. [laughter] Don't you understand? Angels of God are not omnipotent. They're not omnipresent. They cannot be everywhere at the same time. Let me bring it on down, which ought to make somebody shout with me here tonight. Neither is the devil. Hallelujah. The devil can't be HERE AND THERE AND THERE AND SOMEWHERE ELSE ALL AT THE SAME TIME CUZ HE AIN'T LIKE GOD. HALLELUJAH. HE COULD NOT DO ANYTHING IF HE DIDN'T HAVE A BUNCH OF DEVILS. And devils go HERE AND THERE AND THERE. PROBABLY MOST OF US AIN'T NEVER even faced the devil himself anyway. We've got little bitty opons or whatever they are. And they come AGAINST US AND FIGHT US AND DO WHATEVER. BUT THEY REPRESENT THE DEVIL. Same way with the angels OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] I MAY NEVER WALK WHERE GOD'S PROPHET DID THAT THE LORD JESUS WOULD COME DOWN. BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT. HE CAN SEND ME AN ANGEL. IT STILL REPRESENTS HIM. IT'S HIS PRESENCE. HALLELUJAH. TO BE ABLE TO MINISTER to the saints of God. Oh, praise God. So you they're they're trying to they're trying to encourage them with thoughts and that's I think it'd be a good idea to let them go back and you know, don't don't you think it would BE THERE? NO, GREAT KIM. I'VE ALWAYS AGREED WITH YOU. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE THAT WAY. AND then they'll probably go home and say, "What in the world was the matter with him?" You've been around many of these people that's left the message lately and seen how some of them become. I'm telling you friends, I've dealt with a bunch of them. It's absolutely awful. The kind of spirit, the kind of attitude that they get. And you want me to leave this to follow you? No, no, thank you. SO THERE WAS A MAN THERE IN THE COURT NAMED SIMBUSES. So what he was doing, he was courting he was courting these great leaders and giving them gifts and trying to buy their loyalty and saying we we we don't need to do this. The king was wrong on this. And you know who was anointing them? demons. &gt;&gt; To pull them away from the program of God. So here they were battling back and forth and back and forth and gave whatever he was saying to the Lord God. And all of the sudden into that realm walks Michael. And Michael tells Gabriel, "Go to Daniel." Oh, hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Go to Daniel and tell him. I wonder how many times, my precious friends, when we've been laboring and praying and trying to get an answer from God, &gt;&gt; and you thought, "Don't he love me anymore? Haven't you heard me, Lord?" But maybe God would maybe God's got an angel here in this vicinity and he covers pretty good area. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He may not be able to get to you quite as fast as you'd like for him to, &gt;&gt; but don't worry, he's got your address. &gt;&gt; And he ain't like UPS or USPS or FedEx or DHL. He won't deliver your package at the wrong door. &gt;&gt; Won't you love him tonight? &gt;&gt; Can we stand together? &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. This has been so encouraging to me these several weeks that I've been been able to look at this and study it and bring it to you. I mean, I believed, you know, pretty much my whole life since getting saved that there was angels, of course. But not till I come to this message I realize how great the presence was. and then studying it in the last month and a half or so, it has just brought such comfort to my heart, not only with life and the challenges of life, but with death that Satan cannot take them until the Lord God is ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not only the passing of those who are already gone, but for those of us, I believe there's people here tonight will be alive when our Lord Jesus comes. &gt;&gt; We will need the angels of God to help us get in to that other realm. &gt;&gt; I believe they'll be there. &gt;&gt; Can we bow our heads? Hallelujah. Oh, praise the Lord. Heavenly Father, as we ponder over these things, they've been going on around us all of our lives. And yet most of us are not even aware, I'm sure, to this day, even those of us that love you, how true, how real that it is. Things have happened in our lives and we've had divine interventions and people call it luck. I don't need luck. I got Jesus. &gt;&gt; Not only have I got Jesus, I've got his angels. And Lord, I thank you for that. Just like as it was in the days of Daniel, I believe myself that you can allow this person to go into the White House or another one or another one or another one, whoever they would be. For the powers that be are ordained of God. I just wish people could learn and see the nations down through the ages which have attacked Israel and tried to destroy them and they wound up destroying themselves. &gt;&gt; And it's the same way with your message. In every age, Rome tried to kill them. The Catholics tried to kill Martin Luther. on down through the ages, they've tried over and over again. Oh, but Lord God, you've always always had somebody that would stand up for you. And now here we are again. Lord, Satan hates this message now more than when the prophet was here preaching it. And we know a lot of it is to just to divert our attention off of our promised land because this word is our land in this present life. I mean, and if he can get our eyes off of that and we worry about what this one says and what that one thinks and what's this one's going to do and that one's going to do, it's all a great scheme. And it's so sad because there's people that at one time have been part of our church. [cough] They moved out from under the influence of angels of God and moved under the influence of demons. They give their lives, their mouths, their strength to now try to destroy the very thing they once said changed their life. [music] How sad. And it's like for many of them, they have such a hatred for God's prophet and a hatred for this message. And instead of being more like Jesus and praying for those of us that they think are so blind, Lord, they become so vicious and violent. Lord, after studying this, it helps me to realize [music] as it was in the days of Sandbalat, as it's been down through the days of the Assyrians, the Babylonians, now we can see it with the Palestinians. Lord, we can see it with Rome, which once ruled the world, and where are they now? When Carol and I were in Rome several years ago and we saw the statues there and they would every time they change an emperor, they would of course have to carve a new image of the new emperor. But their kingdom became so rotten and so distorted by the very demons that anointed them to conquer. And they was changing emperors so fast [music] that they got to the place that they quit making a brand new total image. So they just made the head where it would sit on top of the shoulders and when a new emperor would come up they just take the head off and put the new head of a new man on there cuz it's replacing them so fast. [music] So their headship has just changed from one year to another, six months to another. [music] Under that demonic anointing, they were able to conquer the known world. I can't imagine how it must be down in hell. Cuz hell is established upon a split of the angelic church in heaven. [music] And them demons, the prophet said, they're spirits. So the spirit of Germany and the spirit of France and the spirit of America, and he said them spirits get jealous of one another and then they cause war. And yet every one of them are under the same head. And brother David was talking about the other day. Brother David s, brother David, can you imagine what hell must be like? them demons fussing, arguing, fighting. Why? That's what their king done. He rebelled against the headship of God and established his own kingdom from a split in heaven. [music] So that's why Satan likes to split families, split homes, and make them where they won't talk to one another, won't even speak to one another. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Who does that? Satan does. &gt;&gt; But oh Jesus, as I read it today, your prophet said, "One day when you come back to the earth again, there'll be no German spirit, no Finnish spirit, no American spirit, but everybody will have the spirit [music] of God. And they'll all speak the same language. and they'll all have the same motives. Hasten the day, Lord Jesus. Granted, Father, Lord, help us as we're the closing hours of the Gentile history. There must be a few more words that's yet to be fulfilled. No doubt the angels of God are here trying to anoint the participants of the anointed word of the hour. Demons of hell are powerless. We know without human beings. &gt;&gt; So them demons need humans to try to afflict us. Them demons need human tongues, human hands [music] in order to go to websites and put all their trash and whatever and write emails and texts and so on and so on. Them demons can't text. Them demons can't email. So they need humans. &gt;&gt; What a terrible thing to think that people are submitting their text to demonic influence. &gt;&gt; Preachers getting in the pullpit preaching against the anointed word of the hour, not knowing they're cutting their own head off [music] as the Assyrians did, as the Babylonians did. Lord, help us that we will never turn our lives over to Satan and his demons. How many will raise your hands with me tonight and say, "Lord, keep me. Keep me from such. Keep me from demonic influence, Lord." Hallelujah. Think of it, children. [music] Them demons cannot do anything on their own. They're powerless. They could not make Cyrus do anything. The angels couldn't make him. So there in that conference room was all this warfare going on. It's been here tonight. Satan trying to make some of you tired, some of you weary, some of you fighting sleep, some of you thinking about the day and you've had bad news about your job or your work or whatever and you fought through hell to try to concentrate [music] and the angels of God have been there trying to nudge you. Listen, listen, pay attention. Your deliverance is here tonight. The war has been raging and the outcome will be determined by us. What if my outcome is going to be determined by me? [music] Then I determine I am victorious. &gt;&gt; I am a winner, [music] not a loser. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am undefeable by the grace of God. I'm more than a conqueror. &gt;&gt; Satan will never be able to wipe me out. He will never be able to take my name from the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; He'll never get me so low that I'll quit. It ain't in me to quit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If it's the outcome is going to be determined by my faith, then that's what my faith says tonight. I'm saying what Jesus says about me. That he loved me before the foundation of the world. And my name was written in the book the same time his was. Hallelujah. Before there's ever one speck of stardust. That's my confession. So my outcome is not going to be determined by demons. It's not going to be determined by people. Oh, glory to God. My faith says I am a believer. I am a Christian. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So what about it friends? What's your outcome going to be? Tell me what's your outcome going to be? Are you defeated? &gt;&gt; Are you victors by the grace OF GOD? ARE YOU OVERCOMERS? IS JESUS your savior? &gt;&gt; Is he your healer? &gt;&gt; AMEN. IS HE MORE than enough? &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, we worship you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We worship you, Lord. The prophet said, "Them demons are here tonight waving their black flags, but the angels of God are waving their white flags of victory." Well, a flag is an end sign. And they're waving to let people know which side is which. Why are they waving? Both sides are wanting us to get on their side. So, I'm going to go join sides with the angels of God. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say to them demons, get away from me. I don't want nothing to do with you. Amen. I didn't come from where you live and I ain't going to where you're from. &gt;&gt; I come from God and I'm going back to God. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. Let that be your confession. Remember, he can only confess. Only confess what you confess that he's already done for you. Let your confession match his in heaven. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's just raise our hands now &gt;&gt; and close our eyes. We say, "Brother Donnie, I don't feel anything." You don't have to. Just let the angels of God walk up and down these aisles. They're here right now, children. How do you know that, Brother Donnie? Cuz his word says they are. The Lord Jesus is here and you are here. And they come together where the saints of God are gathered. We're standing here on hallowed holy ground in the presence of the great king and the angels of God. You need healing, they're here. The healing angels of God are here. You say healing angel? Yeah. That's what came down to the waters there and would trouble the water. The prophet of God called that angel, brother John, a healing angel. So that healing angel would come down and he would trouble the water. Well, we don't have to have no water troubled here tonight. But if he can come and anoint your faith or be able to strengthen you to rise above whatever it is that you're dealing with. Oh, praise the Lord. How many believe you can do it on Wednesday night? I'm glad they're just not limited to Sunday morning. Boy, we'd have been a mess, wouldn't we? Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be in church, but there's just greater chances it can happen to you cuz there more licks of fire here. &gt;&gt; What do you need of children? Tell him. Speak to your husband. Speak to him. Lord, I need encouragement. I need strength. The Lord Jesus can relate to that cuz he was that way. [music] He needed strength, but he wasn't too big to let someone lesser than himself minister to him. Oh, praise be to God. We worship you tonight, Lord Jesus. We magnify your holy name, Lord God. Praise the Lord. Would you just turn and lay your hand on the person standing there near you? Just offer a word of prayer for him, would you? Oh Jesus. Believers to believers, eagles to eagles. Father, we pray for healing. We pray for strength. We pray for encouragement. Lord, I know several sick couldn't be here tonight. Lord, Brother Harvey called me today. And Sister Shirley, Lord, having problems in her back and facing some other things. Lord, Lisa's been sick. Lord, Courtney, come home sick today with a terrible headache. Lord, others that are sick. I I wasn't able to hear the prayer requests, but Lord, you know them all. Father, may the spirit of God go right there to each of their homes tonight. May the angel of God be able to pass to their neighborhoods. Oh Lord, hallelujah. We believe you, Jesus. And if you're so busy that you can't get to him till in the morning, we'll still be waiting on you, Lord. You know our address. You know where we live. Father, hallelujah. We believe you tonight, Lord God. Maybe some they're facing a terrible financial situation. Lord, maybe it's a a legal sort of situation. They don't know what to do. Lord God, I believe you're our great lawyer. Father, you can plead our case in the name of Jesus. Let the angels of God, oh Lord, be able to minister to your believing children. Lord, we don't want to just limit it to those who are in this visible presence and your divine presence that's here. But Lord, those that would be streaming or those that are go back and archive. Father, may the presence of God come in their car. May the presence of God come in their living room, their office, wherever it is they'll be streaming this service. Father, may the presence of the Holy Spirit become so great they just have to pull over on the side of the road. We believe you love your children that much, Lord. Oh lamb of God, touch your children to that. Father, you know I love your people, Lord. I want to see them helped. I want to see them healed. I want to see them delivered. If I do as their pastor, how much more do you do, Father, with divine love? Oh Jesus, touch each one tonight, I pray. Lord God, we love you, Father. We believe we're going to spend eternity together. We thank you for our church. We thank you for our church family. Lord God, be mindful of each one of them, would you? Lord, we worship you tonight, Father. We bless your holy name, Lord God. We worship you, Lord. Oh, hallelujah. We're not here to praise any man. We're not here even to worship angels. We're worship to here to worship you, Lord. I've never bowed my knee. I've never said another being's name. I have never baptized in any other being's name. Oh Lord, I worshiped you and you alone. All these years of my life, I've given no praise to man, no credit to man. I've only worshiped you, Lord. Oh, hallelujah. And I can't wait to be able to stand before you in my real body and be able to worship you like I've never done before. But until I get that body, I'm going to worship you, Lord. And this 69year-old body that I've got, I'm going to praise you. I'm going to lift my hands. I'm going to preach. I'm going to pray. I'm going to study. I'm going to do everything I can, dear Jesus. Hallelujah. To the last day of MY LIFE. OH LORD, HELP ME, FATHER. I pray. I may not have the strength. I may not have the vitality that I had as a younger man, but Lord God, I want to give you everything that I am. I want to live, Lord Jesus, every day of my life for the cause of Christ.
