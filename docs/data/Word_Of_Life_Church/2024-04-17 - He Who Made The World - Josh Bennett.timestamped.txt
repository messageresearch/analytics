[36:09] and over again you get what you
[36:14] expect so if you come and well I don't
[36:17] know I don't know if I get anything well
[36:19] I don't want to be a doomsday guy but
[36:21] you probably won't get much okay because
[36:23] if you don't come expecting but if you
[36:26] come expecting there is no telling what
[36:29] God will do for us while we're gathered
[36:31] together in this time it's a great hour
[36:34] it's a terrible time as far as the world
[36:36] is concerned the darkness that's all
[36:38] around us we can see Israel as they're
[36:41] being surrounded constantly by enemies
[36:44] all the things that are going on there
[36:46] to me they're a perfect parallel of the
[36:49] bride of Christ they're totally
[36:51] surrounded no matter what they do
[36:53] they're the only nation on Earth the
[36:56] only nation
[36:58] that such stringent requirements are
[37:01] laid at their feet they're obligated to
[37:04] feed the people who are trying to
[37:06] destroy them they're obligated to obey
[37:10] other people in the United Nations
[37:12] telling them how to fight a
[37:16] war sort of like we are isn't it amazing
[37:20] how the message folks get under such
[37:22] scrutiny so many videos made about us
[37:26] and so much stuff that's said about us
[37:28] you wonder why well we're the devil's
[37:31] greatest threat that's why it don't take
[37:33] a rocket scientist to figure that out
[37:37] but we come during these days and we
[37:38] trust it'll just be a a holy Time For Us
[37:41] in the presence of God and uh we want
[37:43] you to just come and participate and we
[37:46] just believe in the presence of the Lord
[37:48] will come in such a mighty way maybe we
[37:50] can just sing brother Larry he touched

[38:13] door a few minutes you just go ahead and
[38:14] look at
[38:15] him we'll be done with that he you say
[38:19] is that important I'll tell you how
[38:21] important it is brother B tells us in
[38:25] stport that whenever the resurrection
[38:27] takes
[38:28] place that we will be looking
[38:31] around to see who made
[38:35] it it tell something even in glorified
[38:39] bodies how human that we will be and he
[38:43] said he wants perfect worship he wants
[38:46] no distractions of course so we look
[38:49] around and we see everybody we meet our
[38:52] loved ones and then we focus up toward
[38:56] him to be able to

[41:44] Lord to be gathered in your presence
[41:47] Lord because you said where where that
[41:50] two or three are gathered you'd be in
[41:51] the midst and Lord we believe that

[41:58] earth will pass away but your word will
[42:00] never fail and so God we're just asking
[42:03] tonight as we have gathered now and Lord
[42:06] we have sung the songs of Zion and Lord
[42:11] just exactly in the order of the
[42:13] scripture Lord because we know that in
[42:16] in your scriptural order there that when
[42:18] they would go to battle they would send
[42:21] out the musicians and the singers first
[42:24] and Lord then would come the Ark of the
[42:26] Covenant behind
[42:27] and and Lord we know that that's the
[42:29] word and there that's where we're
[42:31] standing now and then the Army would go
[42:33] forth in battle and defeat the enemy so
[42:36] Lord It's a scriptural order that we
[42:38] follow tonight and Lord the musicians
[42:41] and the singers have went forth now but
[42:43] now we're asking that the word would
[42:44] just come and Lord we know that you said
[42:47] you sent your word and you healed the
[42:49] people and we believe that there's a
[42:51] power in that word that can transform
[42:53] every life Lord it could it I believe
[42:56] Lord that as that word Goes Forth the
[42:58] Lost can be saved and Lord the sick can
[43:01] be healed and Supernatural things can be
[43:04] accomplished we believe that with all of
[43:06] our hearts so Lord we're asking that you
[43:09] would just come the author of the book
[43:11] just step down now and Lord you break
[43:13] the bread of life to us tonight Lord I
[43:16] pray you'll just do the preaching and
[43:18] we'll do the hearing and the receiving
[43:21] Lord that's what we desire more than
[43:22] anything so we're just committing
[43:24] ourselves into your hands we surrender
[43:26] Our Lives to to you Lord take this
[43:28] service and use it for your glory in
[43:30] Jesus name amen amen amen if you take
[43:34] your Bibles this evening we'll turn to
[43:36] the book of
[43:53] Hebrews Hebrews the first chapter I just
[43:56] want to say what what an honor it is to
[43:57] be here and we sure love and appreciate
[44:01] you all and appreciate your pastor very
[44:04] much so um you know
[44:07] um one plants a seed another Waters and
[44:11] God gives the increase and so you know
[44:14] if God uh maybe I could just plant a
[44:16] seed tonight and then uh somebody else
[44:18] will water it and but if God don't give
[44:21] the increase then nothing really
[44:23] happened anyway so we're just depending
[44:25] on him tonight Hebrews chapter one in
[44:27] the first
[44:29] verse God who at sunry times and in
[44:31] diverse manners spake in times past unto
[44:34] the fathers by the prophets hath in
[44:37] these last days spoken unto us by his
[44:40] son whom Heath appointed heir of All
[44:44] Things by whom also he made the worlds
[44:47] who being the brightness of his glory
[44:50] and the expressed image of his person
[44:52] and upholding All Things by the word of
[44:54] his power when he had by himself purged
[44:57] our sins sat down on the right hand of
[45:00] the Majesty on high being made so much
[45:04] better than the angels as Heath by an
[45:06] inheritance obtained a more excellent
[45:08] Name than they For unto which of the
[45:11] Angels said he had anytime Thou Art my
[45:14] son this day have I begotten thee and
[45:17] again I will be to him a father and he
[45:20] shall be to me a son and again when he
[45:23] bringeth in the first begotten into the
[45:26] world he say
[45:27] and let all the angels of God worship
[45:29] Him and of the angels He saith who
[45:32] maketh his angels spirits and his
[45:34] Ministers of flame of fire but unto the
[45:37] son he saith thy Throne oh God is
[45:40] forever and ever and a scepter of
[45:43] righteousness is the uh is the scepter
[45:47] of thy kingdom thou Hast loved
[45:50] righteousness and hated iniquity
[45:53] therefore God even thy God hath anointed
[45:56] thee with the oil of gladness above thy
[45:58] fellows and thou Lord in the beginning
[46:01] Hast laid the foundation of the earth
[46:04] and the heavens are the work of thine
[46:06] hands they Shall Perish but thou
[46:09] remainest and they all shall wax old as
[46:12] th a garment and as a Vestor shalt thou
[46:16] fold them up and they shall be changed
[46:19] but Thou Art the same and thy years
[46:22] shall not fail but to which of the
[46:25] Angels said he at any any time set on my
[46:28] right hand until I make thine enemies
[46:32] thy foot stol are they not all
[46:34] ministering Spirits sent forth to
[46:37] minister for them who shall be Heirs of
[46:40] Salvation may God just add his Blessing
[46:43] to the reading of the word as you're
[46:44] seated this evening I'd like to um speak
[46:49] to you just for a few minutes from that
[46:52] scripture on he who made the
[46:55] worlds and brother brandham said that
[46:59] the book of Hebrews was a very important
[47:01] book he said he actually called it uh
[47:04] Paul's key letter and you know when
[47:07] brother Brown was preaching the Hebrew
[47:09] series there he he uh spoke about how
[47:12] that the Apostle Paul he belied that
[47:14] Paul wrote the book of Hebrews of course
[47:16] there's a lot of debate about that but
[47:18] um but you know as uh Paul was writing
[47:22] this I believe that you'll find in the
[47:25] book of Hebrews that that's where the
[47:27] Shadows of the Old Testament meets the
[47:30] realities of the New Testament because
[47:32] we know that you know every shadow of
[47:35] the Old Testament because before there
[47:37] can be a shadow there has to be first a
[47:40] reality in other words there's got to be
[47:42] something to cast that shadow and and
[47:44] you know sometimes when you see a shadow
[47:47] you you um you may not know exactly what
[47:50] it is although it's uh you know it can
[47:53] resemble the the what's casting the
[47:56] shadow it will have have a resemblance
[47:57] of it but you know the further away the
[48:00] two objects are in other words the the
[48:02] object that is casting the Shadow and
[48:04] the shadow of itself the further away
[48:06] they are it it the you know it may not
[48:09] look exactly the same and you can as
[48:11] you're looking at a shadow you can
[48:13] imagine it to be a lot of things and you
[48:16] know you can come up with a lot of
[48:17] theories of what it might be and even
[48:20] when you're standing in Shadows it can
[48:22] have there can be a lot of fear that
[48:24] goes along with that but theose closer
[48:27] the the object gets to the shadow
[48:29] brother Bram said when it begins to come
[48:31] together see then it becomes to be you
[48:34] you begin to see what it really is and
[48:37] amen because even the shadow will begin
[48:39] to look more like the the actual real
[48:42] object and you know as I look at the Old
[48:45] Testament and you know brother brandom
[48:47] being a prophet uh there he would uh
[48:49] many times he would even take his text
[48:51] out of the Old Testament brother Bram
[48:53] used the Old Testament uh uh you know
[48:55] very uh very much in his ministry
[48:58] because being a prophet he could look at
[49:00] those types and shadows but he could see
[49:03] the reality of the Shadow and the type
[49:06] and and we know that that Christ was the
[49:09] Fulfillment of every shadow and every
[49:12] type every lamb of the Old Testament
[49:14] every sacrifice amen the even the
[49:17] Tabernacle the the furniture in the
[49:19] Tabernacle every bit of that pointed to
[49:21] Jesus Christ amen and he is the
[49:24] Fulfillment of that is that right amen
[49:27] and brother BR would talk about even
[49:29] Hebrews chapter 1 and he said that
[49:30] Hebrews chapter 1 was was uh he said it
[49:34] separated Christ from all the prophets
[49:37] he said it it literally exalted Christ
[49:41] above the angels He said you as you read
[49:44] Hebrews the first chapter which we just
[49:45] read the entire chapter and we see that
[49:48] he was higher than the angels He was
[49:49] given a name above the angels and and
[49:52] and and and Paul would even make a
[49:54] comparison unto which of the Angels ha
[49:57] he set at any time set at my right hand
[49:59] see amen it was separating Christ from
[50:01] the Angels it was and brother Brown said
[50:04] it separated him from all the prophets
[50:06] because God Amen in sunry times and in
[50:09] other words God Amen in sunry times in
[50:13] diverse ways or in various ways spoke
[50:16] unto the fathers by the prophets but in
[50:18] these last days he has spoken unto us by
[50:21] his son amen because see friends I want
[50:24] to tell you there's a lot of people that
[50:25] believe that Jesus was a good man and he
[50:28] was a good man as a matter of fact he
[50:30] was the perfect man amen and many can
[50:32] see him as a good man some believe he
[50:34] was a great teacher he was a great
[50:36] teacher amen some believe that he was a
[50:39] prophet and he was a prophet but I want
[50:41] to tell you he was more than a good man
[50:43] he was more than a good teacher he was
[50:46] more than just a prophet amen he was the
[50:49] god of the prophets amen Amen brother
[50:51] Ram said he was the king of the prophets
[50:54] amen sure he was a prophet but he he
[50:57] amen was more than a prophet amen and so
[51:00] as we look at this we see that that's
[51:02] what's unfolding here in Hebrews chapter
[51:04] 1 it's exalting Christ and I tell you I
[51:07] believe that even this weekend it ought
[51:08] to be the theme of every service should
[51:12] be to exalt Jesus Christ amen not just
[51:14] in special meetings but I believe that
[51:16] every Wednesday night and every time we
[51:19] come together amen the theme of that
[51:21] service would be to lift Jesus up Amen
[51:24] to the highest Place amen it ought to be
[51:27] the theme of our life it ought to be the
[51:29] theme of every song that's sung amen it
[51:31] ought to be to lift Christ up amen above
[51:34] every preacher every Prophet every
[51:37] listen friend every man that's ever
[51:38] lived amen because I tell you amen there
[51:41] is none
[51:42] greater Amen brother Ram said amen it's
[51:45] the greatest of all Revelations is a
[51:47] deity of Christ amen it's the beginning
[51:50] of all Revelations Amen in one place
[51:53] brother B said you can't even get to
[51:54] first base until you get that Revelation
[51:57] see amen so we see that Paul is
[52:00] unfolding this and he says there in the
[52:02] second verse he hath in these last days
[52:06] spoken unto us by his son whom he hath
[52:08] appointed heir of all things notice this
[52:12] amen Paul in unfolding this he says whom
[52:15] Heath appointed heir of all things and
[52:18] how many believes that he's speaking of
[52:19] Christ here that Christ was appointed
[52:23] heir of all things now brother brandham
[52:25] would take that in the Hebrew series and
[52:27] he said what is it he said it was an
[52:29] appointment and listen now he was
[52:32] appointed Christ was heir of all things
[52:35] and he said oh how the devil knowed that
[52:38] from the Garden of Eden sea the devil
[52:40] had heard the word there that day in the
[52:42] Judgment of those people because he said
[52:45] as God be to pronounce the Judgment
[52:47] there because you come from the dust
[52:49] you'll return and the woman's seed shall
[52:51] bruise the Serpent's head see it was a
[52:53] promised seed listen I think this is
[52:55] amazing because only a prophet could do
[52:57] this Amen brother Brandon would take the
[53:00] appointed heir of Hebrews 1 and tie it
[53:03] all the way back to the appointed seed
[53:05] of Genesis 4 amen and he shows that it
[53:08] was an appointment the appointed heir of
[53:11] all things was the same thing as the
[53:13] appointed seed or what we know as the
[53:16] woman's seed which we know a woman don't
[53:18] have a seed but she would be given a
[53:20] seed is that right and brother BR said
[53:22] that's why Satan constantly watched for
[53:25] that seed see amen he was always trying
[53:28] to destroy that seed he said because
[53:30] when Abel was born he said there you are
[53:33] he said that's the seed and then amen
[53:35] when he killed Abel or his son Cain
[53:38] killed Abel as soon as Abel died amen
[53:41] then Satan said I got the seed he slew
[53:44] it see he said I got it but Abel's death
[53:47] amen see Seth's birth was the
[53:49] resurrection again and watch how they
[53:52] come amen watch what brother R is
[53:54] showing here he's showing that when as
[53:56] soon soon as Cain slew uh uh uh Abel
[53:59] there amen Satan thought that he had
[54:02] stopped the promise of God because he
[54:04] had stopped the seed amen but when Seth
[54:07] was born it represented the
[54:11] resurrection amen and proved amen that
[54:14] that seed line would not be stopped is
[54:17] that right and watch it's exactly
[54:19] according to Genesis 4:25 as the Bible
[54:21] said and Adam knew his wife again and
[54:24] she Beed a son and called his name Seth
[54:26] for God said she or or for for God say
[54:30] she hath appointed me another seed
[54:34] instead of Abel whom Cain slew amen
[54:37] listen friends and we know that was that
[54:39] was only a representation of Christ is
[54:42] that right how many believes that he was
[54:44] the woman's
[54:45] seed amen and he would be the one that
[54:48] would bruise the head of the serpent
[54:51] amen but see amen Satan was always
[54:54] watching for that seed and brother B
[54:57] would say it he said he thought he had
[54:59] it when he slew amen Abel there and then
[55:01] he thought surely he had it when he
[55:03] killed the prophets and when they killed
[55:05] amen uh H uh you know Isaiah amen he
[55:08] said well I surely got him now amen when
[55:10] they killed the Prophet Jeremiah and on
[55:12] down through and even come to John the
[55:14] Baptist and brother Brown said when they
[55:16] took John and cut his head off amen he
[55:18] said Satan stood there and he said
[55:20] surely I've got it now amen but then
[55:23] amen there stood Jesus Christ amen and
[55:26] John stood there and and he said listen
[55:28] amen I'm not even worthy to take his
[55:30] shoes off amen it was never me it's
[55:33] always been him amen but then they took
[55:36] Christ and let him up gol's hill and and
[55:38] when they nailed him on calvary's tree
[55:41] amen Satan looked at Jesus hanging on
[55:43] the cross amen and he says surely I got
[55:45] him now amen but listen friends amen
[55:48] what he didn't expect amen was a knock
[55:50] on his door amen and Jesus Christ went
[55:53] down into hell amen and he knocked on
[55:55] the door Satan amen and and he took the
[55:58] keys of death Hell In The Grave amen and
[56:01] then he rose on the third day for your
[56:04] justification hallelujah amen amen to
[56:07] prove to the devil amen you have not
[56:10] stopped amen the appointed seed amen you
[56:13] can't stop this seed amen you can't stop
[56:16] this life Hallelujah and let me just
[56:19] tell the devil tonight he couldn't stop
[56:21] it then and he can't stop it
[56:24] now Hallelujah
[56:26] listen V he thought he had the church
[56:29] whipped at the Nan counsil amen when
[56:33] they sold out and traded amen the name
[56:35] of God for amen for Trinity baptism amen
[56:39] and and and he thought he surely had him
[56:41] Whi right there and it went down into
[56:43] the Dark Ages and the seed went back
[56:45] into the ground again but friends up
[56:47] come a a Luther in a
[56:51] Reformation amen but after just a little
[56:54] while amen they denominated that
[56:56] movement amen and it just amen it begin
[56:58] to go right back again and Satan said
[57:01] well I've stopped it again I've killed
[57:03] the movement amen they've denominated
[57:06] amen they took amen the truth of
[57:08] justification but now it's just become a
[57:10] denomination but just ass sure as he
[57:12] thought he had it stopped UPC come
[57:14] Wesley with sanctification amen and the
[57:17] devil amen so amen just begin to work
[57:20] again and they denominated that movement
[57:22] amen but sure as they thought he had to
[57:24] stop then up come pent
[57:26] cost and the restoration the gifts amen
[57:30] and that went along amen but then they
[57:32] denominated that and Satan stood back
[57:34] and said I got him now I've stopped it
[57:36] now I've killed it now but just as sure
[57:39] as he thought he had stopped it amen
[57:41] Malachi Flo come on the scene and God
[57:44] sent you Elijah the prophet Hallelujah
[57:48] to turn the hearts of the children back

[57:57] restore back the original Bible
[58:02] truth here we are amen 60 something
[58:05] years later amen amen in 2024 and the
[58:09] devil thinks he's got us whipped now but
[58:11] I want to tell you listen friends amen
[58:13] there a devil amen watch preachers walk
[58:16] away from this message and people that
[58:18] serve God for years and follow this
[58:20] message for years walk away from the
[58:22] message and the devil send him back he
[58:23] said well I got them now but forever one
[58:26] of them that's walking away God's got a
[58:28] young person God's got a teenager amen
[58:31] God's got a backslider that's coming
[58:33] back to the house of God why because you
[58:36] can't
[58:41] stop Hallelujah you can't stop this seed
[58:46] life it's an appointed
[58:49] seed and Christ is an appointed
[58:53] Heir oh I like that he's the appointed
[58:57] heir of all things brother Bram said in
[58:58] the Revelation series Revelations
[59:00] chapter 5 when he's preaching there in
[59:03] part two he said Jesus come in four sons
[59:08] names he said he was the son of David
[59:11] the son of
[59:13] Abraham the son of man and the Son of
[59:16] God we know in
[59:18] dispensation it's we we preaching in
[59:21] three sons name and brother Brown is
[59:23] just showing here that he was the son of
[59:26] David and the son of Abraham he said see
[59:29] because son of as son of David he was
[59:31] heir to the
[59:33] throne he said as son of Abraham he fell
[59:36] heir to Palestine and all this belongs
[59:38] with that he said as the son of man he's
[59:41] air to the Earth he said but as Son of
[59:44] God he's air to All
[59:47] Things hallelujah amen amen as Son of
[59:51] God he's heir to all things now so I
[59:53] want to ask you a question tonight how
[59:55] many believes that Jes Jesus Christ is
[59:57] the heir of all
[59:58] things he's heir to the throne he's heir
[1:00:02] to Palestine he's heir to the Earth as a
[1:00:05] son of man amen but as a Son of God he's
[1:00:08] air to all things ain't that beautiful
[1:00:12] amen but I got better news than that cuz
[1:00:15] Paul said in Romans 8 he said as many as
[1:00:18] are led by the spirit of God they are
[1:00:21] the sons of
[1:00:23] God hallelujah for you have not received
[1:00:26] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[1:00:29] you have received the spirit of adoption
[1:00:32] whereby we cry ABA father the spirit
[1:00:35] itself bear it with us witness with our
[1:00:37] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:00:41] and if children then
[1:00:43] HS Hallelujah and if children then HS
[1:00:47] come on church amen how many believe
[1:00:49] that you are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:00:52] Amen how many of you have a revelation
[1:00:54] I'm a Child of God amen if we are
[1:00:57] children of God then we are Heirs of God
[1:01:00] hallelujah amen and listen as an heir of
[1:01:03] God Amen we inherit eternal
[1:01:07] life amen as an heir of God tonight you
[1:01:10] inherit eternal life I tell you what if
[1:01:12] that's all we got that would be enough
[1:01:15] to tear this building
[1:01:17] down amen if that's the only thing I
[1:01:20] inherited was eternal life that's enough
[1:01:23] for me to praise God the rest of my life
[1:01:26] with everything that's within me to have
[1:01:28] a revelation in my heart that I cannot
[1:01:31] die Hallelujah you could listen V if you
[1:01:33] are born again by the spirit of God and
[1:01:36] you're a son or daughter of God tonight
[1:01:38] the prophet of God said you can no more
[1:01:40] die than God
[1:01:43] himself there ain't but one form of
[1:01:45] eternal life and that's Zoe life that's
[1:01:47] God's
[1:01:49] life and as an heir of God you're Heir
[1:01:52] you fall Heir you inherit eternal life
[1:01:56] but that ain't even the best part of it
[1:01:59] cuz we're HS of God and Joint hes with

[1:02:08] suffer with him that we may also be
[1:02:11] glorified together listen re amen we are

[1:12:03] know you're a joint air with
[1:12:07] Christ amen that's why Satan is that's
[1:12:09] why Satan hates this bride listen he's
[1:12:11] still after that seed he was trying to
[1:12:14] kill it when he killed Abel and he ain't
[1:12:16] never stopped and he's still after it
[1:12:18] tonight and I I just want to take this
[1:12:20] opportunity to tell you that if the
[1:12:23] devil's after you you ought to praise
[1:12:28] God if Satan's really amen after you and
[1:12:32] amen and he's and he's on your Trail I
[1:12:34] tell you what you ought to just take the
[1:12:36] moment and just lift your hands say
[1:12:37] thank you
[1:12:38] Jesus because I tell you what that's
[1:12:40] telling you a couple things right there
[1:12:42] one thing he ain't got you yet because
[1:12:46] if the devil had you he wouldn't be
[1:12:47] after you amen but but if he's after you
[1:12:50] amen that's a good testimony he don't
[1:12:53] have me yet and if he's after you
[1:12:56] there's something you
[1:12:59] got Hallelujah that's the reason why
[1:13:02] like brother Donnie was just saying a
[1:13:03] few minutes ago all hell is against this
[1:13:06] bride amen that's exactly right because
[1:13:10] you're on your way to the
[1:13:12] throne that's exactly what he's always
[1:13:17] deserved yes
[1:13:21] sir we try to get a little bit further I
[1:13:24] know it's Wednesday night
[1:13:26] tonight I said well that's all right
[1:13:29] I'll leave that
[1:13:32] off Hebrews chapter 1
[1:13:36] again the Bible
[1:13:40] says by whom also he made the
[1:13:45] worlds I thought that was uh interesting
[1:13:48] that it it
[1:13:51] says worlds plural
[1:13:55] just it don't say by whom he made the
[1:13:57] world but the
[1:13:59] worlds I got to look into that in the
[1:14:01] Greek word there is actually uh Aon
[1:14:05] which is where we get the word Eon or
[1:14:07] eons you know and when we try we're
[1:14:09] expressing something that's uh even like
[1:14:12] a space of time or you know we we might
[1:14:16] would say eons of time which is just
[1:14:18] something that we really can't put a
[1:14:19] number on it or you know we can't it's a
[1:14:21] way of expressing something that is
[1:14:23] beyond measuring
[1:14:26] and and and and this is the the word
[1:14:28] that was used here he made the
[1:14:31] worlds and I I I got to thinking about
[1:14:33] that because you know there's been there
[1:14:37] was the world that
[1:14:39] was in the before the Andel luian
[1:14:42] destruction there was the world that was
[1:14:43] we know that and now there's the world
[1:14:45] that
[1:14:46] is and and how many believe there's a
[1:14:48] world to come oh friends I'm looking
[1:14:51] forward to that amen but but but but see
[1:14:54] when Paul Paul was writing this amen he
[1:14:56] wanted to bring the entire uh uh thing
[1:15:00] into the scope here that that he didn't
[1:15:02] just make what you see around you today
[1:15:05] the Earth you live on and and maybe the
[1:15:07] the the universe that is known to you
[1:15:11] but he made the
[1:15:12] worlds amen by him he made the worlds
[1:15:15] everything everything that you can see
[1:15:17] everything you can't see listen friends
[1:15:20] everything was created by
[1:15:22] God Amen a and listen amen you know I
[1:15:26] know they say today they come along and
[1:15:28] and they're trying to tell us that you
[1:15:29] know there was a big bang one day and
[1:15:31] all this just
[1:15:33] happened listen man I'll tell you what
[1:15:35] they got more faith than I
[1:15:37] got I I believe something like that that
[1:15:40] you know there was just a big explosion
[1:15:42] and then all this just
[1:15:44] happened listen friends I I've told my
[1:15:46] church back home and I told the young
[1:15:47] people I said you you ain't even got to
[1:15:50] read a Bible to to to to have evidence
[1:15:52] that there's a God that there's a
[1:15:54] Creator just watch walk outside and look
[1:15:57] around amen just look at your own body
[1:16:00] amen amen you're amen and and and and
[1:16:03] how it was made and designed listen
[1:16:06] everything around us all of creation is
[1:16:09] screaming to us that there's a
[1:16:15] Creator and he made all these things the
[1:16:18] Bible says amen here that the both seen
[1:16:21] and unseen listen in verse three it says
[1:16:23] who being in the brightness of his glory
[1:16:25] and the express image of his person and
[1:16:28] upholding All Things by the word of his
[1:16:30] power amen not only did he make it he's
[1:16:33] holding it up watch what David said in
[1:16:36] Psalms 24 David said the Earth is the
[1:16:39] Lord's and the fullness thereof the
[1:16:42] world and they that dwell therein for he
[1:16:44] ha founded it upon the Seas and
[1:16:47] established it upon the floods Hebrews
[1:16:49] 11 and3 through faith we understand that
[1:16:51] the worlds were framed by the word of
[1:16:54] God so that things which are seen were
[1:16:56] not made by things which do appear John
[1:16:59] 1 And1 here's the key to it all in the
[1:17:02] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:17:05] with God and the Word was God the same
[1:17:08] was in the beginning with God and all
[1:17:10] things all things were made by him amen
[1:17:14] who's he talking about the word listen
[1:17:17] that's what Paul was saying he was
[1:17:18] speaking of Christ and he was saying who
[1:17:21] made the worlds amen Christ but you get
[1:17:23] in your mind well how did Jesus create
[1:17:26] everything amen listen and some you know
[1:17:28] got the idea the Oneness idea amen of
[1:17:31] the Jesus alone and that you know that
[1:17:34] that he uh you know that that that's all
[1:17:36] they can see friends amen but brother
[1:17:38] Brown said no it couldn't have been that
[1:17:40] way amen listen we know amen that that
[1:17:42] that was God Elohim that created amen
[1:17:45] and it was by his word that he created
[1:17:48] all things and here's the key of it all
[1:17:51] that John said in the beginning was the
[1:17:53] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:17:55] Word was God hallelujah and nothing that
[1:17:58] was made was made without him and then
[1:18:00] in the 14th verse and the Word was made
[1:18:05] flesh and dwelt Among
[1:18:08] Us is that
[1:18:11] right Colossians
[1:18:13] 1
[1:18:16] Paul writes it this way in verse 12
[1:18:19] giving thanks unto the Father which has
[1:18:22] made us meat to be partakers of the
[1:18:25] inheritance of the Saints and light who
[1:18:28] have delivered us from the power of
[1:18:30] darkness and has translated us into the
[1:18:32] kingdom of his dear son in whom we have
[1:18:35] Redemption through his blood even the
[1:18:38] Forgiveness of sins who is the image of
[1:18:40] the invisible God the firstborn of every
[1:18:42] creature for by him amen for by him were
[1:18:46] all things created that are in heaven
[1:18:48] and that are in Earth visible and
[1:18:50] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[1:18:52] dominions principalities Powers all
[1:18:54] things were created by Him and for him
[1:18:57] and he is before all things and by him
[1:18:59] all things consist listen what brother
[1:19:02] Brown said there in the church age book
[1:19:03] he said he is the beginning of the
[1:19:05] creation of God how many knows that that
[1:19:07] was a in every age brother Brown said
[1:19:09] Christ revealed a portion of his deity
[1:19:12] in every age amen that's why amen he
[1:19:15] would he would uh uh come and he would
[1:19:17] give the message Amen to that age and he
[1:19:19] would say amen I am he that holds the
[1:19:22] Seven Stars in my hands and so on and so
[1:19:24] forth and every age he was revealing a
[1:19:26] portion of his deity and in the last age
[1:19:28] he was was revealed as the beginning of
[1:19:31] the creation of
[1:19:33] God he said that's who the Lord Jesus
[1:19:36] says he is but those words don't mean
[1:19:39] exactly as they sound to us just taking
[1:19:41] them the way they sound has made some
[1:19:43] people in fact multitudes of people get
[1:19:45] the idea that Jesus was the first
[1:19:47] creation of God making him lower than
[1:19:49] the godhead then the first creation
[1:19:52] created all the rest of the universe and
[1:19:54] whatsoever it contains but that's not
[1:19:56] right you know that doesn't line up with
[1:19:58] the rest of the Bible the words are he
[1:20:00] is the beginner or the author of the
[1:20:02] creation of God and now we know for
[1:20:04] assurity that Jesus is God very God he
[1:20:07] is the Creator and John 1 and3 all
[1:20:10] things were made by him and without him
[1:20:12] was not anything made that was made he
[1:20:14] is the one of whom it is said in Genesis
[1:20:16] 1:1 in the beginning God created the
[1:20:19] Heaven and the Earth also in Exodus
[1:20:21] 20:11 for in six days God made the the
[1:20:24] Heaven and the Earth the sea and all
[1:20:26] that is in them and the and and rested
[1:20:28] on the seventh day see there is no doubt
[1:20:30] that he is the Creator and he was the
[1:20:33] creator of a finished physical creation
[1:20:36] surely we can see that these words what
[1:20:38] these words mean now to have any other
[1:20:40] interpretation would mean that God
[1:20:42] created God how could God create when he
[1:20:45] himself is the creator but now he
[1:20:48] standing in the midst of the church and
[1:20:51] he stands there revealing who he is to
[1:20:53] this last days he's called himself the
[1:20:56] author of the creation of God this is
[1:20:58] another creation this has to do with the
[1:21:01] church this is a special designation of
[1:21:04] himself he is the creator of that church
[1:21:07] the Heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:21:11] bride Hallelujah listen friends as the
[1:21:14] spirit of God came down and created a
[1:21:16] blood cell and wrapped himself in it and
[1:21:19] deposited in the womb of a virgin amen
[1:21:22] amen the prophet of God said amen he is
[1:21:24] is now creating himself a
[1:21:28] bride oh I just want to say this tonight
[1:21:32] amen I'm talking about the God that
[1:21:34] stepped out on the platform of Eternity
[1:21:37] and he didn't have nothing in his hand
[1:21:39] and he spoke and worlds come amen
[1:21:42] rolling off of his fingertips and he and
[1:21:45] he created the universe and everything
[1:21:48] that you see and know was created by
[1:21:50] this God and he didn't have nothing amen
[1:21:53] amen no material to work with when he
[1:21:55] did
[1:21:57] it brother B said when he created the
[1:21:59] body of Jesus Christ he didn't have to B
[1:22:02] no material from nobody to do
[1:22:05] it he just did it by a spoken word and
[1:22:09] the prophet of God said that same God is
[1:22:12] right now creating himself a
[1:22:15] bride church I tell you this ought to
[1:22:17] encourage you tonight because you feel
[1:22:20] like you ain't
[1:22:22] enough and you think I I just ain't got
[1:22:25] nothing for God to work with he don't
[1:22:27] need
[1:22:29] nothing come on church I said he don't
[1:22:32] need
[1:22:33] nothing say well I just ain't got the
[1:22:36] abilities and I just ain't got the gift
[1:22:38] and I just ain't good enough listen amen
[1:22:40] listen for anybody else if I was trying
[1:22:42] to make something out of you amen that
[1:22:44] would be very important but God don't
[1:22:47] need nothing amen he don't he didn't
[1:22:49] need nothing that you had to
[1:22:51] offer come on Church he's the Creator he
[1:22:55] can create love where there ain't no
[1:22:57] love he can create peace where there
[1:22:59] ain't no peace he can create Joy where
[1:23:02] there ain't no
[1:23:03] joy Hallelujah and he can create a
[1:23:08] bride right out of the middle of
[1:23:17] Le
[1:23:21] hallelujah oh yes sir
[1:23:24] this is a new
[1:23:26] creation and the Bible says if any man
[1:23:29] be in Christ he's a new creation all
[1:23:33] things have passed away behold All
[1:23:35] Things become new you believe it Paul
[1:23:38] said in Ephesians we are his
[1:23:40] workmanship created in Union with Christ
[1:23:43] and the good works amen he says again in
[1:23:45] Ephesians 4:24 and that ye have put on
[1:23:48] the new man which after God is created
[1:23:51] in righteousness and true
[1:23:53] Holiness yes sir
[1:23:57] in whom also we've obtained an
[1:23:59] inheritance Ephesians 2:11 being
[1:24:01] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:24:03] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:24:06] counsel of his own will Hallelujah
[1:24:09] aren't you glad you belong to
[1:24:12] him and the Bible says here again and
[1:24:16] I'm
[1:24:17] trying just give me a couple
[1:24:20] minutes he
[1:24:22] says that
[1:24:24] not only did he create all things but in
[1:24:26] verse
[1:24:27] three and upholding All Things by the
[1:24:32] word of his power brother Brown said
[1:24:35] there's power in his word how many
[1:24:37] believe that listen friends his word is
[1:24:40] holding all things up right even right
[1:24:42] now there's a reason why amen that that
[1:24:45] Destruction has not happened to this
[1:24:47] world to this current time it's because
[1:24:49] you say well you know it's all the peace
[1:24:50] treaties and these these you know our
[1:24:52] governments have got together and and
[1:24:54] they come up with the United Nations and
[1:24:55] NATO and all this stuff is what's held
[1:24:57] everything now I listen friends I want
[1:24:59] to tell you amen there's only one thing
[1:25:01] that's holding it in his place amen and
[1:25:04] that's that's God's
[1:25:06] word amen he keeps the sun in his place
[1:25:09] the moon in his place the ties in their
[1:25:11] place he's holding the worlds up he's
[1:25:12] holding the universe up and I want to
[1:25:14] tell you something friends it ain't as
[1:25:15] if you know some kind of you get us some
[1:25:17] kind of imaginary thing in your mind
[1:25:19] that you know there's some great God
[1:25:21] standing where somewhere a a trillion
[1:25:24] miles away amen and he's standing off
[1:25:26] and and he's just holding out his hand
[1:25:28] and he's holding everything's up that's
[1:25:30] not exactly how it is amen the Bible
[1:25:32] says he holds it up by the word of his
[1:25:35] power see amen God is holding these
[1:25:38] things up listen friends brother Brown
[1:25:39] again in the church his book he would
[1:25:41] say these things sayith the faithful and
[1:25:42] the true witness and I want to show you
[1:25:44] what I find in the thought of of
[1:25:46] faithful here you know that we often
[1:25:49] talk about a great unchanging God whose
[1:25:52] word does not change and when we speak
[1:25:54] of him after that manner we often get a
[1:25:56] view of him that makes him seem very
[1:25:59] impersonal it's as if though God made
[1:26:01] the whole universe and all the laws that
[1:26:04] pertain to it and then stood back and
[1:26:06] become a great impersonal God it's as
[1:26:09] though God made a way of salvation for
[1:26:11] lost mankind a and that way being the
[1:26:15] cross and then when the death of of
[1:26:17] Christ has atoned for our sin and his
[1:26:19] resurrection gave us an Open Door amen
[1:26:22] God just folded his arms and stood back
[1:26:24] amen he said it's like we majored in
[1:26:26] believing in a great Creator who having
[1:26:29] created lost personal interest in his
[1:26:32] creation Now I say that's how too many
[1:26:34] people are are apt to think but that is
[1:26:37] wrong thinking for God is governing in
[1:26:41] the Affairs of men right
[1:26:44] now Hallelujah he is both the Creator
[1:26:48] and the
[1:26:49] sustainer according to he or Colossians
[1:26:52] 1:16 for by him all things were created
[1:26:55] that are in heaven or that are in Earth
[1:26:56] visible invisible whether they be
[1:26:58] Thrones or dominions principalities or
[1:27:00] Powers all things were created by Him
[1:27:02] and for him and he is before all things
[1:27:05] and by him all things consist brother
[1:27:07] Brown said he is a sovereign God and by
[1:27:10] his own counsel he purposed The Plan of
[1:27:12] Salvation of his own elect which he
[1:27:15] fornew come on church I ain't got time
[1:27:17] to preach on it tonight but I just tell
[1:27:19] you this brother BR is saying God didn't
[1:27:21] create all the the whole earth and the
[1:27:23] world in the universe and just stand
[1:27:25] back and then say well I'll just see
[1:27:27] what
[1:27:28] happens and then God didn't look at the
[1:27:31] fall of humanity in the Garden of Eden
[1:27:34] and then make a way back in in a way of
[1:27:37] Salvation through the cross and the
[1:27:39] resurrection of Jesus Christ amen and
[1:27:42] give and then just stand back and say
[1:27:44] well I'll just see who comes and who
[1:27:47] won't God Made A Way and then he come
[1:27:50] and found you and led you to it
[1:27:55] Hallelujah because when he made the way
[1:27:58] you were on his
[1:28:00] mind Hallelujah listen for this he
[1:28:02] didn't leave it up to you I know a lot
[1:28:04] of people don't like this kind of
[1:28:05] preaching but I want to tell you I'm so
[1:28:08] thankful for the grace of God somebody
[1:28:10] come along and said all that
[1:28:11] predestination election y'all preach
[1:28:13] ain't fair I said you got that right it
[1:28:15] ain't fair and I'm so
[1:28:18] glad Hallelujah because if we got what
[1:28:21] was fair we would every one of us die
[1:28:24] and go to hell amen but grace and mercy
[1:28:28] reached down I know what was fair give
[1:28:31] me
[1:28:35] Grace Hallelujah say well I I I want to
[1:28:39] make a decision I want to make a choice
[1:28:41] and listen friends I believe in the forn
[1:28:42] knowledge of God and I believe he saw
[1:28:44] you coming to an altar and I believe if
[1:28:46] you are predestination or predestinated
[1:28:48] or rather you will
[1:28:50] come and you'll
[1:28:52] repent and you'll weep and cry and beg
[1:28:55] God to forgive
[1:28:59] you but the only reason you're doing all
[1:29:01] that is because he predestinated the
[1:29:04] seed down on the inside of you
[1:29:07] Hallelujah he didn't wait until you come
[1:29:10] to the altar to give you that seed he
[1:29:12] gave you the seed and that's why you
[1:29:15] come to the
[1:29:16] [Music]
[1:29:19] altar Hallelujah he didn't just make the
[1:29:22] way and then back up and say I see what
[1:29:24] they going to do
[1:29:25] now oh no he's governing in the Affairs
[1:29:28] of men
[1:29:29] now come on friends I'll tell you
[1:29:31] something tonight God ain't up in heaven
[1:29:33] tonight biting on his
[1:29:34] fingernails worried about the condition

[1:29:48] and and you know and churches are
[1:29:50] falling apart and and and you know and
[1:29:52] brother so and so amen walked away
[1:29:55] and God knew all
[1:29:58] that before he ever created anything
[1:30:01] before he ever spoke anything to his yet
[1:30:03] before the foundation world he already
[1:30:04] knew all that was going to
[1:30:06] happen and allowed
[1:30:08] it I'm on church I ain't saying that
[1:30:11] God's the author of all this and that
[1:30:13] God is doing all this but at the very
[1:30:15] least you got to admit God has stepped
[1:30:17] back and pulled his hands off of it and
[1:30:19] said okay go ahead amen but I tell you
[1:30:22] why he's doing it amen because because
[1:30:24] he's got your perfection in mind amen
[1:30:26] and God knew amen listen friends I want
[1:30:28] to tell you something tonight God is
[1:30:30] proving to the devil right now that I'm

[1:36:28] than what we are and I'm so glad tonight
[1:36:30] that it ain't me holding on to him but
[1:36:31] he is holding on to me and the same one
[1:36:35] that's holding up the Sun and holding
[1:36:36] back the tides and amen the same one
[1:36:38] that's that's keeping the universe in
[1:36:40] his position is the same one that's
[1:36:42] holding me up tonight and I say this in
[1:36:44] closing as a musicians come tonight amen
[1:36:47] I got to thinking about it and I thought
[1:36:48] you know what over there in the Old
[1:36:49] Testament one time Israel amen uh the
[1:36:52] ark of the covenant was taken captive by
[1:36:54] the enemy and the Philistines got a hold
[1:36:56] of it and they took it down there and
[1:36:58] they took it into their Temple and they
[1:36:59] set it before their God and and you know
[1:37:03] and as they they took that Ark in there
[1:37:05] and they set it before their God Amen
[1:37:07] and I thought about this you know there
[1:37:09] wasn't nobody standing around the ark
[1:37:11] brother Donnie Amen in the word and
[1:37:14] there was nobody standing there saying
[1:37:16] amen that's right you know we're we
[1:37:17] we're supporting this and we believe
[1:37:19] this word and we believe this is true
[1:37:21] amen the word was just there all by
[1:37:23] myself there was nobody amening it and
[1:37:26] there was nobody you know jumping up and
[1:37:28] down and there wasn't nobody saying I
[1:37:29] believe it I believe it amen but the
[1:37:31] word all by itself Amen in the presence
[1:37:34] of that false God Amen they set that at
[1:37:37] that Ark down and they left and when
[1:37:38] they come back their God was laying flat
[1:37:41] on his
[1:37:43] face hallelujah amen I feel like
[1:37:45] stopping right there it ain't the point
[1:37:47] I'm trying to make but I'm just going to
[1:37:49] make it tonight amen whether you amen
[1:37:51] the word whether you believe the word
[1:37:53] amen whether you support the word amen
[1:37:55] the word is still the word hallelujah
[1:37:58] whether you believe this message or you
[1:38:00] don't believe the message it's still the
[1:38:05] truth and it'll still do exactly what
[1:38:08] God sent it to
[1:38:11] do but you know what I think so
[1:38:14] crazy that bunks went in there and they
[1:38:17] saw their God laying flat on his
[1:38:20] face and you know what they did they p
[1:38:23] picked him
[1:38:26] up they stood their God back up they
[1:38:30] picked him
[1:38:31] up and they went back the next
[1:38:34] morning and there he was flat on his
[1:38:36] face again his hands broke off in his
[1:38:38] face
[1:38:39] too and I got to thinking about that and
[1:38:42] I thought oh God I am so glad that I do
[1:38:46] not serve a God that I created and I
[1:38:49] want y'all to know something tonight I
[1:38:50] have never one time had to pick my God
[1:38:53] up I have never had to prop him up
[1:38:56] listen friends but I want to tell you
[1:38:58] this my God has many many times reached
[1:39:01] down and pick me up Hallelujah I fall
[1:39:05] down many times but I'm glad I serve a
[1:39:08] God that can reach down and pick me up I
[1:39:12] don't got to hold my God up he holds me
[1:39:15] up Hallelujah because the God that I
[1:39:19] serve is the true and the Living God
[1:39:22] he's not a god of my creation he's my
[1:39:24] Creator Hallelujah he made the worlds
[1:39:28] amen and he created me and listen for is
[1:39:31] one of these days and it ain't going to
[1:39:32] be long that same God by the same way by
[1:39:36] his word is going to change my body and

[2:06:01] God and repair him and fix your God and
[2:06:06] help your God
[2:06:08] along I sang about it one day this week
[2:06:11] and you know we go through a lot of
[2:06:13] things in life that we just don't
[2:06:15] understand and we can't figure it out as
[2:06:17] our brother shared with us some of the
[2:06:19] things that they've gone through and and
[2:06:21] the thought just come across my mind in
[2:06:23] this way a lot of people can't serve a
[2:06:26] god they don't
[2:06:28] understand but I couldn't serve one I
[2:06:34] could I think of it yes sir if you
[2:06:37] understood every move he made and you
[2:06:39] could understand everything he does and
[2:06:42] says you mean you could actually serve a
[2:06:45] god like that that means he's pretty
[2:06:48] puny cuz everybody I'm looking at
[2:06:50] tonight is pretty uny including
[2:06:55] me praise the Lord he is so great and so
[2:06:59] wonderful and so awesome how in the
[2:07:01] world could we ever understand
[2:07:03] everything about him until we get there
[2:07:06] and still through
[2:07:08] eternity he will be revealing
[2:07:11] himself but he lets us understand what
[2:07:14] we need to understand and the rest of it
[2:07:16] he'll take care of by and
[2:07:19] by Praise the Lord oh it's been awesome
[2:07:22] to be here tonight thank you so much for
[2:07:24] coming thank you for participating in
[2:07:26] the
[2:07:27] service um Brother Scott needs as many
[2:07:31] young men that are able to come directly
[2:07:34] to the fellowship hall to help roll out
[2:07:36] carpet and set up tables after service
[2:07:40] so if you young men could do that all
[2:07:43] you old guys are exempt we don't want
