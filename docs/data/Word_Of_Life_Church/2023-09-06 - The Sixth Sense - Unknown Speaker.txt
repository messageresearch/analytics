for us to be able to be gathered together again tonight I understand you all had some wonderful meetings this last weekend what' you think about brother Josh Bennett he's quite a preacher a he amen so appreciate brother Josh and I appreciate his gift to preach some preachers are good preachers and they know it but brother Josh is a good preacher and he's so humble with it I just love a man like that where he just he text me and he said I think I've done the offest job that ever was and I'd already go heard so many compliments and so many wonderful things and he wasn't trying to be fake or false that's just the way he looks at it God can use a man like that can he amen had some good meetings up at brother Ron Spencer brother Timothy and brother Tim did an outstanding job just really good and so enjoyed being able to be there here We Are Tonight night on Wednesday night how many's got needs tonight wow I'd figured there' been more of you I figured everybody have double hands of well I'll raise both mine for you amen but we know the Lord is so mindful of us a he so we've come tonight to open our hearts to him and just see what he'll speak to us and see what he'll do for us I believe he has some wonderful things in store for us Hebrews 11:1 a very wonderful scripture most of you probably could quote it by heart now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen so Faith gives reality or substance to things that we hope for notice verse two for by it by What Faith by it the elders obtained a good report through faith now watch Paul use a different word from verse two to verse three verse two for by it the elders obtained a good report verse three through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God through faith you mean faith and the word is what frames the world well whose Faith walk was it it was God's faith so you mean God had to have faith wow so you see the term the faith of God shouldn't be an unusual thing to us God believed his own word God and you and I will believe his own word too so notice how the worlds are framed through faith we understand that the worlds not one but plural the worlds were framed by the word of God through faith so God spoke it Prophet said it might have been 800 years might have been a million years before anything happened but God believed it and it would happen so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice in Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testified of his gifts and by yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him I want to speak to you tonight on The Sixth Sense the sixth sense I mean lot to be remembered as we pray God bless you let's join together in faith now heavenly father as we have our heads bowed to the dust of the Earth from whence we were taken we've come once again tonight Lord that we might worship fell Fellowship we might clap our hands sing we might hear the word that we might preach the word that we might sayen to the word father we have come here because we're a needy people but we've not only just come for our needs but we believe you have a need to be worshiped and you have a need to be believed you are looking for someone who will believe you you're looking for for someone who will trust you I will be one of those tonight father you're looking for people who will worship you when they feel absolutely nothing they will trust you when they feel no different because they simply take you at your word you see our needs tonight father would you speak to us your word in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you turn around and tell somebody for you're seated glad to see you in the house of God tonight now you can take your seats God bless you so what is Faith what is Faith now we know there's two kinds of it there's a supernatural faith and there's intellectual Faith there's an element of the promises of God and things that we'll get from God that will only come by us taking our human face and appropriating that faith and believing what God Said and God will honor that faith we know the prophet told us the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass but then we also know there's times our faith just won't do it our faith will never be enough to be able to do what we need and the Lord understands that so he gives us his faith now I got to be honest I wish that every time I'm in a very difficult spot the Lord would let me have his faith right off it'd be a lot easier for all of us would it not but he doesn't do that many times he waits till our faith runs out as he waits till our strength runs out as he waits till sometimes our human understanding and many other things runs out and then he will step in because he knows if he stepped in as soon as we got into a little bit of a trial would be more lazy than what we are already and a lot of us are pretty lazy to begin with so God will wait until our faith reaches its end He waited till Abraham's strength had totally run out Abraham could father and ishmail they're still dealing with that trouble today but God had to wait till Abraham's strengths and everything else about him was totally wiped out and when that happened then God intervened and proved it was by his strengths that Isaac would be born I'm convinced every one of us probably here tonight have produced ish mails in our life and you may be still dealing with that after effect and God will allow us to run to our strength's end before our Isaac will be produced now but let me read you a couple things here about what real revelatory Faith actually is what is Faith ano once the end time faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet that's notice it's revealed to you but it's not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God now for instance there's many people who believe that God Is A Healer and they have a real need in their body or maybe in their home somebody in their family has got a real need and they believe that God can but they don't have the Revelation that God will now do they have faith they do they have an element of faith that God can do it maybe they heard that God could do it well as I was sitting in the hospital room today and some people come in to talk to Erica and they was telling her Lance myself and Erica was there and they went through all the different things that they was thinking about and this and that and the other and Lance said well you know we we'll have to pray about this well as soon as Lance said pray about it then this woman totally changed and she started talking about the Lord I'm sure they had to be real careful you know what they say nowadays so she started talking about the Lord and how that God can move and she said let me tell you right now we believe that God can perform Miracles we have seen him and she said our church is having a Revival and she said I go to a certain certain Baptist Church and I saw whoa you mean to tell me that God can perform miracles in a Baptist Church now you're this woman has been in the medical field for years and years and yet believed in Miracles and said she had seen them and she wasn't a message believer but she was a Baptist believer now for those of you who think God is only moving in Bride churches you need to open up your understanding a little bit this is why the only identification of a Believer is not Miracles well praise the Lord to three different nurses since Erica has been in the hospital oh yes the Lord can do this and the Lord can do that bobbed haired makeup wearing pants a whole nine yards as would say so don't get in your mind that Miracles are only happening in message churches the Lord God loves Humanity so much he will heal some people knowing they will never serve him brother Ron Spencer told me the other day one of the greatest profound miracles in ever seen in his own Ministry happened to a person that never served God never gave their heart to God given just a few hours to live and the spirit of God moved for him and brought them out of the hospital the very next day they've never even gave one day to Jesus Christ since then so don't get in your mind that it's bride only you see God loves humanity and he wants them to be healed wants them to be saved but when we're talking about not trying people and God being able to trust people that's not your average Joe out here that's not everybody that goes to church but God wants to be able to try his bride like nobody else now watch how the prophet deals with this again and works as Faith expressed now Faith is a revelation from God faith is a revelation now there's where I want to stay there just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed to you by his grace it's nothing you did now listen about your faith how great it is you didn't work yourself up into Faith you never have faith well Glory you never have faith it's give to you by the grace of God God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built upon the Revelation and the church said so whenever you and I are in need now get in mind it's not just about healing we don't need Revelation just for healing only but maybe you're having family problems maybe you're having marriage problems you need a revelation about the will of God for your family a revelation about the will of God for your marriage did God put you and your wife together did God put you and your husband together then you need a revelation that if God puts you together God wants you to stay together God don't want you arguing and fussing and fighting God wants you to be able to love one another forgive one another and be what he intended for your marriage to be and somebody said amen well I just know somebody was going to say oh me about that but it's not just about Divine Healing Faith involves way more than Divine Healing as a matter of fact we're going to need faith for a Rapture listen this Rapture message now it is a revelation for the Revelation is Faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you now God might drop in your heart tonight that you are going to be healed of a certain certain thing your husband may not know it your daddy may not know it your mama may not know it and it's not real to them yet but it's real to you and everybody else may say honey we believe it with you and we're standing there by you and yes a amen that's the word of God but even if your husband said now wait a minute darl and don't you think you're getting a little bit religious now don't you think you're bringing a little bit of reproach if your mama didn't believe it your husband didn't believe it your wife didn't believe it it wouldn't make no difference to you because God has made it known to you and it is so real if no one else believes it but you you and God are the majority now what it is a revelation Satan cannot talk you out of it let's resume again now in Hebrews 11:7 by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by which he condemned the world and became the heir of righteousness which is by Faith by faith Abraham when he was called out to go into a place which he should receive for an inheritance notice obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went notice the commonality among all of these people they didn't know where they were going they didn't know exactly what it all held they did not know all the particulars they didn't know the battles the tests and the trials that laid before them but all they knew was God had showed them something you see when God makes it known to us he doesn't always show us all the way to the end and every trial and every step of the way we're on a journey how many believes that you know there's stages in this journey that you may go days oh my and weeks and months and there'll be one Victory after another after another and then sometimes God and you don't hear no good news forever it's one bad news one bad report one bad this or that or the other and it may seem like it's getting worse you're praying for your son or your daughter and it seem like they're getting meaner and meaner keep right on praying for him that's a good sign God's heard your prayer and the devil knows the answer is on the way so he trying to discourage you to talk you into to giving up and giving in because he knows his days are numbered and somebody said am amen now watch what God did now by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the hirs with him of the same promise verse 11 through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was the delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised is anybody here tonight like Sarah how many judges God Faithful of what he said in his word now yesterday I was down in the basement at the house and I I was listening to a tape and talking to the Lord and praying and oh my I I was just having myself a time down there me and the Lord and I was listening to brother brand as he was preaching and talking about some great events that had happened in his life and all of a sudden while I was there in the basement assumingly by myself and the presence of God come there where I was and I heard the voice of God say these words is there anything too hard for the Lord and I answered back and said no sir there is is nothing too hard for you now read with me in Genesis 18:13 and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah life saying shall I have assurity bear a child which am old notice now God is the one who said this to Abraham is there anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah Sarah is going to have a son now remember God did not he absolutely did not break his Covenant because of that but God asked Abraham this question is there anything too hard for the Lord so whatever you're dealing with tonight do you honestly believe whatever it is that it's too big for God is there anybody here tonight that has got a problem that in reality you feel like that problem is too big for God is cancer too big for God to heal no is is a wayward son or a Wayward Daughter too far gone that God by his grace cannot reach down to them if you've got a a terrible terrible thing going on in your home or in your finances whatever it is is that bigger than our God is any sickness any disease any heartache any anxiety oh your depression tonight oh you say it's so dark and it's so deep but is it bigger than God cuz somebody going to preach on me tonight is there anything too hard for the Lord is there anything that you and I are facing in this hour that's too big for our God that he cannot move you're at liberty right now to stand and point it out to me but I warn you before you do I will answer you back and say there is nothing too hard for my God there is nothing too great that our God cannot move I don't care how sick you are how much in debt you are how sad you may be our God is a veing and deliverance and happiness and peace and there is nothing greater than our God hallelujah hallelujah Hebrews 11:32 and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of jeepa of David also and Samuel and the prophets notice what happened through faith who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain promises stopped the mouths of lions is there anything too hard for the Lord Abraham's body was dead is that too hard for God answer me Sarah's womb was dead was that too hard for God her her heart could not be able to support giving birth to a baby was that too hard for God her womb was dried up was that too hard for God it seemed like the world was in such darkness and chaos but was it too hard that God could not come down and take on the form of a baby and go to a cross and die and raise himself up from the grave could the Roman seal be too hard for Jesus to not break through come on somebody could Lazarus be so dead that he could not call his voice amen could not the blind man in Matthew could blindness keep him from seeing good Hallelujah Blind barus by the walls of Jericho was he too blind for Jesus to heal it answer me somebody were you too lost that he could not save you were you too sick that he could not heal you were you too bound that he could not deliver you is there anything too hard for the Lord Oh Glory women receive their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection others had trial of crewel mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment how did they overcome it by fa in the promised word think they didn't even have a Bible you understand me people didn't have a bible to read they did not have a Bible Abraham did not have a Bible that he could turn over there when he would get down and weary and discouraged and open up and say well that that's the word of God I I know my name is right there in the promise he didn't even have a Bible Isaac never had a Bible Jacob never had a Bible they did not have a Bible for hundreds and hundreds of years but they took God at his word how could they do it it was revealed to them notice this in Roman Romans 4: 19 now the prophet said whenever he got discouraged he read Romans 4 if you haven't tried that it's a real good antidote for depression whenever you feel like you can't make it notice Romans 4 19 speaking about Abraham and being not weak in FA he considered not he considered not paid no attention to the physical obstacles which were in his way or Sarah's way he didn't even consider now I doubt was that every day every day he was getting up he had his oh oh my these aches and pains and this and that and the other why just say well that that's all right that's no problem with God it'll be a greater Miracle tomorrow than it was today because I know I'm one day older Sarah's one day older I don't even consider glory to God we're going to have that baby in hell why you realize friend a person with this type of faith is an absolute idiot to the eyes of the world what's really sad is this person with this type of faith is almost like that in some of the message churches because they think you're crazy oh my you're bringing reproach no you're not you're giving witness to the word of God Amen notice being not weak in faith he considered not he didn't even look at it he paid absolutely no attention you imagine how hard that would be getting up your Lum bag go bothering you in the morning and your Feet's hurting you and your back is hurting and this and that and the other is hurting said I don't even consider that's fine it ain't no problem at all ain't nothing too big for my God cuz God was the one who told him that so he said there ain't nothing bigger than that say oh Lord oh Lord my back's kill me my loveo my arthritis I've got this and that they said Sarah shut up don't you even talk about it we're healed We're Young we're a young man and Abraham are you out of your mind are you crazy man I went down there to the St I bought a bunch of diapers I bought some pins I bought some booties I bought everything in blue cuz I know it's going to be a boy so we're going to have a son Sarah said Sarah said I can't even hard to get out of bed what in the world you talking about Abraham what have you been drinking son you've been down to the drugstore you found somebody's peel bottle along the way he said no but have met almighty God and he told me is there anything too hard for the Lord so I'm asking you tonight as God asked me yesterday is there anything too hard for the Lord is there anything you're facing tonight too hard for the Lord being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah woman he went inconsiderate and we claim to be his children we get prayed for him boy if we don't feel lightning bolts and Thunderbolts and everything else our shoes knocked off of our feet my the tingling and everything else don't run over I didn't feel nothing I didn't feel nothing it don't get I'm no better you show me one scripture in the word of God where Jesus said when you're prayed for you'll feel it and I'll eat the whole book that's right he never never said that one time as a matter of fact you ain't got a feeling one or a sense that will even declare Fai you can't feel Faith you can't taste it you can't smell it you ain't got one sense in your body that will declare Faith well I quoted it to you and I read it to you and if you minutes and then maybe you'll say Amen notice this he said sir don't you even talk about it okay Abraham whatever you say poor old guy he's crazy how we do we get well how you doing then we go behind the one I don't know what wor about him everybody keep your eye on Abraham P fell I believe his Alzheimer's is kicking in his dementia's acting up a little bit he's told me not to say I was old poor fell look at him he just barely get glory to God careful careful you fall break every bone in your body Hallelujah Sarah glory to God we're going to have that baby yeah right a amen sure amen Abraham just go along with him just go along with him pull fies he won't last much longer really yeah okay Sarah yeah glory to God Amen we're going to have that baby amen we're going to have it that's way some of your family would do yeah glory to God you're here y'all pull say just go along with them you know they say that's the way you have good people like that no People Like Us don't even care if you don't go along with us you don't want to go along that's up to you but we're going along anyhow I'd rather take God at his word than believe ever lie of the devil notice in verse 20 he staggered not and the word staggered is properly made to use of your own judgment and reason and Discerning things by what sort they are so staggering is that you look at it and you use your own reason and your own ability and you try to figure it out on your mind now this just makes perfect sense there's no way God is going to give a an old man 100 years old and his wife old too 90 and they're going to have a baby wife God was going to do anything and do it sensible he get an 18 year old boy and about 18 year old girl something like that and give them a child no he wouldn't God picked a 100y old man and a 90y old woman he staggered not at the promise of God to unbelief but was strong Lord God I hope God can say this about me he was strong in face giv glory to God so he didn't sit around oh me wowy wowy woo well I believe God for about 45 minutes yesterday it didn't come I give God record after 10: and he told me about 9:40 or something like that and I give him record after 10 and if it didn't come I just said well I guess ain't going to come well it may not come today but it might come tomorrow and if it don't come tomorrow if I you I'll be looking forth the next day tell me what other option do we have tell me somebody what other oh oh you say medical science baloney Medical Science oh they run out to their end politics has run to its end World God government is run to its end we only have one real hope and that's the Lord Jesus notice verse 21 and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform and the church said now let's look at this substance Faith see feel smell here is is that right them five senses control the entire human body is that true then taste feel smell and he now there's none of them that declare Faith but why is it that we want to tie feelings to Faith Oh Glory to God I feel Faith I I feel it I feel it if you believe the message you know that's not true that's now you you know me well enough to know I wouldn't make that statement if I didn't have it in front of me and that's why sometimes people are defeated because I didn't feel anything I didn't feel nothing Brother Don he prayed for me and somebody else shouted and they passed out in the spirit and they fell out did that mean they got healed it does not I've seen people shout across the platform and totally miss their healing because they got so emotional so tied up in the emotion and others walk right through and just as dries an old dead Tater and lay right there and say well glory to God I Take God at his word and walk right out for they're healed instantly by the power of God never shouted never jump never sh no we're not against that we believe in that but feeling is no sign that you're healed jumping is no sign that you're Delivered come on somebody you believe God and take God at his word that's the six sense now he said face is the only direct and positive sense it's the sick sense faith is more than sight faith is more than feeling but do we believe that faith is more than feeling you do not feel facei you do not feel facei but is it amazing if we don't feel something then we think we didn't have faith no you're measuring you're trying to measure the super sense by one of the five you're trying to measure the phenomenal super sense by one of the five I didn't feel anything I didn't see anything I didn't taste anything somebody told me when they got prayed for oil run out of their hands and water run out of their hands and they just felt a chill from the top of their head go all over their body Oh Glory to God I felt Faith No you're measuring it by the wrong sense well Glory maybe I need to start a new series watch this faith is the only direct and positive sense it's the six sense faith is more than sight faith is more than feeling you do not feel Faith you don't taste Fai you don't smell face You Don't See see faith faith is the substance of things hope for and the evidence of Things Not Seen again he says God put man in five senses to contact his Earthly home you don't contact god with your five senses you know God by faith which is the Sixth Sense on down and later in this paragraph well you see I don't feel any different you're not supposed to feel any different that's friends I won't you look at what we've done if we're not careful we're going the exact opposite of what the prophet messenger taught us and then if we don't feel something I didn't get nothing I didn't get nothing you go right back through the prayer line again and again and again well what am I waiting for what am I waiting for God to make a better promise how can God make a better promise what what are many people looking for a feeling a sensation well they did Oh Glory to God I know I got it now so you're judging the supernatural by a feeling which can lie to you come on do you know the super sense can never lie how many's ever had your feelings to lie you ever see these drawings and diagrams and things where it'll be certain words or certain pictures and you'll look at it and somebody say you see this and this and you say no and they saidwell turn it this way and look at that and you say oh my goodness somebody showed me one the other day it was a picture of two girls and the way you look at one one was looking one way and one was looking the other and you look right at it depending on how you look at it and the image is so clear once you see it and I held it up to somebody else said you see it I said no I don't see it I don't see it so their sight was not being true to them but it had been revealed to me that there was another image in the photo and whenever I turned it around and pointed it out then they saw it don't you understand that cloud that appeared out there in Arizona in 1963 don't you understand who that was oh they may look at in the Science magazine and call it this and that and the other and it wasn't until 1965 that the prophet held it up before the audience of brandham Tabernacle and turned it to the right held it up like this and then turned it to the right and whenever looked and said who was it Christ in all his glory the scientists look at it preachers looked at it brother Bram even looked at it himself but until God revealed it to him he didn't see who it was but now you and I every time we look at it we know who it is so what our sight then could lie to us our feelings can lie to us praise the Lord notice this and El Shad we've had too much of this here High pressured Latter Day Divine Healing campaigns exactly right people saying I got it in the hand I feel it feel it you feel it no you don't feel it you might feel your hand but that's all you fed that's right Jesus never did say did you feel it he said did you believe it not did you feel it do you believe faith is not feeling faith is something that you don't feel oh my goodness you have no senses that will declare it only that six sense that Faith knows it you don't feel taste smell or hear it but you know it so you don't touch it you don't taste it you don't hear it you don't smell it but you know it and it's more real than your sight it's more real than your feelings glory to God notice this the six sense belongs only to the Christian you cannot have this six sense until you become a Christian wow okay so you cannot have the six sense until you become a Christian notice again same sermon in Jefferson Avail but when the five senses act contrary to the word of God then they are lying how many's had your senses to lie to you I me felt like somebody had something against you boy you just you just know they you know they did and you thought I'm going to go to him or I'm going to go to her and I'm going to ask him about it you go tell them and say well Lord have mercy brother sister goodness no I don't want what you're talking about I don't have nothing against you I love you all my heart and you know what we'll do many times we'll still believe our our senses and our feelings our sight over the word of a consecrated Christian because why because our feelings our sight our emotions whatever more has convinced us that person's got something against us and they'll stand right there and say well brother I don't have nothing against you at all I've always loved you and I thank God for you and all that and you said I don't believe it I don't believe it don't believe it you know what how many times have we been deceived and the devil's learned how dependent we are on our senses and on our feelings and all of that and he'll lie to us oh my goodness and what better person to lie or to use to lie than yourself cuz most of us will believe us over anybody else I just feel like brother Rob don't like me brother Rob I'm GNA pick on you I know you got broad shoulders i' I've just been noticing when I get around brother Rob I go to feeling funny maybe you wore the wrong shoes to church maybe you got an evil spirit on you or I I I feel I feel I feel your feelings will lie to you well I wish somebody preaching don't worry if we don't get done tonight we'll come back tomorrow night and have church again well at least 20 of you will be back anyway we'll see the rest of you on Sunday when the five senses act contrary to the word of God then they are lying now the the six sense cannot lie wow so the sick sense cannot never never has never will lie praise God it's a super sense and the super sense is the Holy Spirit the face of God that dwells in you and if you let the five senses be yielded to the six sense it'll guide you and bring all the other five senses under control so it don't mean that we eradicate feeling it don't mean we eradicate sight and taste and smell but what we do is we run all of them through the super sense so if you're running your faith through the super sense and then God gives you a good feeling well glory to God hallelujah praise the Lord I'm know it so but you know it not from the feeling you know it from the super sense itself and then the feeling is just a little cream on top and you say hallelujah I believe God but without this feeling I still believe him without any emotion I still believe you but when you're control right then God can pour out a lot of feeling on top of you CU he know feeling is not your absolute feeling is just a blessing oh I love that don't you the devil can get into these five senses Lord have mercy and lie to you but listen to this but he cannot touch that super sense don't you see friends how Christians get so mixed up on things it never ceases to amaze me how many Christians feel led to do this and do that and do the other and as a pastor you show them the scripture you'll show them the message and say look the spirit of God would never lead you to break this word you know break this scripture break all of this but I feel led I feel led you see what's happened the devil has got into their senses and lied to them and they are totally convinced it's God but yet it's totally contrary to the word but it's so real because the devil has got in to their senses and their feelings and their emotions and whatever more and they won't check it by the word look the spirit of God is never afraid of the word if the Lord is leading you then don't be afraid of scripture don't be afraid of the message of the hour if it's the Holy Ghost it'll only punctuate scripture and punctuate the message of the hour if if if that Spirit leading you will not receive scripture and the message I'm going go and tell you it's a devil am [Applause] amen notice this but he cannot touch that sup it's far beyond his reach so he reaches and he reaches he just can't get it that come from God it's called facei notice again the super sense if you hasn't haven't listened to this in a while you ought to listen to it Lord I'm going to listen to it again tomorrow the five senses does not control the six sense but the six sense controls the five senses the super sense controls the natural senses and the five senses see taste feel smell here and the super sense is something that'll make you believe God's word for that's the only thing it'll speak about so notice then the super sense does not just well I think and I believe and I feel and I had a dream dreams are good Visions are good but many folks have had dreams and been totally contrary to the word of God people have had visions and been totally contrary to the word of God come on somebody say Amen but the super sense can never leave God's word why it is god notice you walk by the six sense you talk by the six sense you live by the six sense you die by the six sense amen and you raised by the six sense Hallelujah that super sense something that's in you that's different from what the natural man is the six senses come upon the human being to make them deny anything that's contrary to the word of God listen now what it'll do any symptom any symptom that's contrary to God's promise the six sense says right it isn't there so how are you going to deny migraine how will a six sense of someone with terrible horrific pain but the six sense will say it's not there now y'all I know what some of y'all saying and you're saying we're getting into nouse category no actually we're giv into seventh seal third pull rapturing bride category I don't know about you maybe you like this world maybe you like been here with all these bunch of all that's out here I want to get out of here myself it's going to take a rapturing message to get us out of here just preaching the Bible stories over and over and over and over again the same ones that's been preached for a thousand years it preach on those Bible stories that have produced a rapture we should have already had one but we've got to have a rapturing message to produce rapturing Faith that's why God sent us the seventh angel now come on somebody say Amen so people say that they believe the message of the hour I never even preach it in their church I'm sorry they're lying if you believe the message of the hour you will preach the message of the hour you won't be identified hanging around the fringes oh I know we've had them come and go for years and years and years and they don't want to be identified you know with all that sort of thing it's perfectly fine but it ain't going to work with me I'm going to believe the message message I'm going to preach the message I'm going to talk the message and I've seen the message work notice that sick sense denies listen what it'll do it denies all all symptoms all symptoms anything contrary to God's word any feeling emotion somebody say oh well I was prayed for but I just don't feel any better the six sense would never stand still for that the six cense would say it's a lie I feel better how are you I feel better glory to God I feel better say really I said yeah y'all see me yesterday I was really bad yesterday now y'all just sitting there looking at me like I'm from Mars I'm not from Mars I'm from Heaven I want to go back to Heaven do any of you all want to go back with me so the super sense will say that is a lie that pain running in my body it's a lying [Music] devil oh six cents I never stand still for that the six cents would say it's a lot I feel better and you see some of you who don't understand Faith you say a person who says that is lying you got it totally backwards well brother Donnie they're going to the doctor they've got pain the scans showed this the scans showed that yeah and you call that truth and you say poor old sing oh I'm part of their family I hope they don't embarrass me oh goodness oh goodness I hope they're telling everybody they're going to get healed I hope they don't nobody don't find that out at work that that's my daddy that's my grandpa I hope they don't find it out you yell a back Christian you but then when they get healed and go to testifying about it then you will say glory to God hallelujah I knew it would happen why don't you quit lying look friends if this is not going to be a message Church I'm leaving okay let me just give you a heads up if the message ain't welcome here neither am I so either one or two things you all get out or I do or we all get in and go up that's my choice oh my notice he said six cents was say it's a lie I feel better I'm getting well God said so you said they're lying they are not the repeating God's word God said so that settles it the six sense only feeds on the word of God now notice brother man talking about the tree that the Lord Jesus cursed when he was here what did happen the tree had been cursed the face of God listen this placed against that tree's life there was nothing physical you could see but way down beneath the Earth down in the roots of that tree it's when Jesus said cursed be you may no man take fruit from you may you not live and Jesus was doing that for the tree of course because it was a reflecting Israel but he was also doing it for a type and a shadow of of cancer or any other disease from the fourth dimension notice this death was setting in it had been cursed the sick sense had come against it it had to die it started dying from The Roots it's the same thing taking place with the cancer it's the same thing takes place with a tumor the same thing takes place with any disease when the sick sense of power of the Lord God raises up against it and said Satan come out of there you might not see no physical condition happen right away but their faith holds just the same it's been cursed that super sense won't let it go it won't pay no attention to how you feel how you look how you act it won't have one thing to do with it God word's been applied the sick s takes a hold of it that's all she goes to work the CER begins to dwindle away it dies from the roots and it's gone amen and somebody [Applause] said let me share a few testimonies with you super sense up here CAD Tabernacle when we had the meeting that crippled boy that came in there and was prayed for him many of you was there to see him they brought him back in that emergency room Billy led me to him and they had him on the platform three or four nights in the building didn't get a prayer card so they put him in the emergency room and I went in there and prayed for him looked at him and said Mr Brandon can you tell me some consolation I said yes sir son polio got you this way he said that's right your name is such and such you come from a certain place that's right he said what about my healing I said now listen by his stripes you were healed AR you notice he tells him his name tells him where he come from but when it come to the promise of his healing notice where he went back to right to the scripture by his stripes you were healed he went home testifying giv giving God praise he brought such a reproach they claim in the neighborhood until one Sunday a group of ministers come in and set it down by him and said you must stop doing that you're bringing a reproach on the colon boy you talking about knocking the knocking the wind out of your sails a bunch of preachers can you imagine now if that happened here in our church me and brother bent and brother Brown brother Daryl brother Joel all the rest of these brothers here and we'd gather together now look sister you're you're bringing a reproach on our church here you're going around testifying that God's healed you and we all know the doctors have give yet we all know that there ain't no hope for you now sister don't you think you're going to bring some reproach on brother Donnie don't you think that the deacons and everybody else that you're really going away heav you say well Lord have mercy it's it's bad when the devil discourages you but when saints of God discourage you that's really bad or family members I mean knows that the truth now notice he said the young man sitting there he said mister if you were sitting where I am and you were in the chair that I'm sitting in you wouldn't try to rob me of the last hope I got in Christ and said by his stripes I am healed he no more than said that setting there paralyzed feet hands body and back no more than he said it out of the chair he went glorifying God his natural senses said he'll sit there the doctor said he'll be there forever as long as he lives but the six sense said by his stpes I am healed and he wouldn't have nothing to do it's casting away everything contrary to what God Said one day standing back here on top of the hillside at George RS the holy spirit said to me rise to your feet and I looked and there was a light shining onto a dogwood tree and said go by the way of Rights or go by the way of Carter and when I got there the the Lord Jesus had showed her mother a sign that I was coming that's talking about little Georgie Carter walked into that little girl laying on that bed so weak she couldn't even raise her spit and cup her mother would hold it y'all to hear brother Brandon was he impersonates Georgie and she was trying to spit in that little sputum cup with the TB and I said sister Georgy Jesus Christ the son of God met me in the wilderness of about a half hour ago and told me to come and lay hands on you thus sayth the Lord stand on your feet it had been nine years nine years since she' been out of the house didn't Hardy away nothing her limbs he said her legs wasn't much bigger than a broomstick Hallelujah the six sense went to work a power struck that girl for the first time in three years or nine years and 8 months should been on her feet the first time in nine years and eight months she hadd been on her feet glory to God she jumped to her feet right out into the yard blessing the trees and the grass and everything Oh Glory Hallelujah went in and sit down at the piano and begin to play there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emanuel's veins why reasonings would have cast down said she couldn't do it I don't know how I don't know only the power of God held her up her legs wasn't that big around up here at the joints look like Broomsticks that's been some 12 years or 14 years today strong and healthy going on for the Lord Jesus what was it the first time there was it nothing seemed to happen but reasoning would have said it couldn't happen but brother she held on to God's word hallelujah the six sense Hallelujah by this same forceful six sense kingdoms have crumbled like wed one wall against another by the six sense the Red Sea pushed back and dry ground was made for children of God to escape by the same six sense Samson defiled a thousand Philistines what about you tonight are you going by sight you're going by feeling you're going well I didn't feel nothing well I I I've been going to church now for several services and I ain't felt nothing I don't know if it's for me or not you're listening to the LIE of the devil oh my notice this by the six cense the Dead's been raised by the six sense Mighty Miracles has been performed it's the most powerful force that ever hit the earth amen the most powerful force that's ever hit the earth it's that super sense called the six and had nothing to do with this down here if this down here declares it and says Amen to it all right you're moving on but regardless of what this does believe that hallelujah hallelujah the six sense the six sense how many wants it how many believes you've tasted of it by the grace of God how many believes we need more of it in our lives hallelujah hallelujah a prophet was thred into a lion denin and because of that six sense the Lions couldn't eat Daniel they couldn't get near him because the six cense by that same six cense three Hebrew children was thrown into a fiery furnace they defied the Flames of the furnace all reings had proed they'd be burnt to death before they got to it but the six cents stayed him in there two or three hours praise praise be to God praise be to God and when they open the furnace they seen one standing there among them like the Son of God that's the sixth sense it was the six sense that raised Jesus Christ from the dead the six sense raised Jesus Christ from the dead after he laid in the ground because he believed the word word of God said destroy this body in three days I'll raise it up jump on down a little bit to the next paragraph by this same sense God spoke on there was nothing what is that sense that super sense is God the faith of God in you the part of God that comes into you and gives you the super sense now what's absolutely amazing is when he preaches this at the Tabernacle the service before he preaches the super sign and then he comes and preaches a super sense we're living in a day of super super super but I wonder how many of us how many people of the earth want this super I do brothers let's jump over a little bit we'll go to Faith this a six sense in chiako paragraph 42 by that same six sense was working in little Marca when she came to see Jesus raise her brother out of the grave after being dead for 4 days that same six sense cllean the leper that same six sense raiseed up Jesus Christ on the third day that same six sense will Rapture the church amen we'll Rapture the church one of these days and take it out of here to glory is it important is it important this is what will take us out of here here every time we see a Divine Healing every time we see a miracle you know what it is it's a little foretaste of the change of the body so a person comes up with an Affliction the sickness in the body and the spirit of God will change and move it out what was it a foretaste of the body change I mention it tell you I guess last time I preached about John Ryan brother B tells said his story here whenever he talks about this and the super sense and John Ryan was a castle he was a beggar begged on the streets and he come up somebody told him said want you go up prot that meeting so he had some people to bring him up so he come up there and the prophet told him and said your name is John Ryan said that's right said you're a cic that's right so he said you've been blind you're beggar on the street he said that's right so he said what about mahen he said by straps your heel he said all right praise the Lord so he walked off the platform now said happened to it it went back in the back and he started hollering hey hey preacher so he tried to get back up through the brother said hey you can't do that said yes I'm going back up that preacher he prayed for me and I ain't heal so brother R said bring him on so they bring him at he said hey you told me I was healed and he said yes and you told me you believe me well he said I do but you told me still I can't see he said that has not one thing to do with [Music] it so he tells him he's healed and the man just emphatically tells him I can't seee it that has nothing to do with you being healed they see how confusing it can be to the carnal mind because people what the symptoms are still there everything is there as a matter of fact it's getting worse that has nothing to do with it if you have the six sense well I don't understand well he said you look by his stripes you already heal you take him at his word he said look sir I'm a Catholic and he said I'm taught to believe the word of my priest so he said what shall I do he said you go off this platform praising God so he sold newspapers you know the story so we get out to extra extra read all about it I'm Healed I'm Healed extra extra you think God ain't got a sense of humor one day a little boy LED John RH to the barber shop to get a shave and a haircut in two bits God's got such a sense of humor but you know a barber shop I've been to barber shops a lot of them in my life some of the worst memories of my life and some of them dear God you know but when you imagine a barber shop brother SK I'm down at your Barber Shop a lot of times and you're them old guys in there and they talking about politics I mean they're talking about the price of g they're mattering Hornets

hallelujah the six sense the devil was lying to me yesterday about some stuff and I said so let's ask you something devil I want to know when you started working for God cuz you're acting like that God is using you to tell me all these things the best I remember you and God is on different sides amen so I said you just get out of here and leave me alone cuz I'm a Son of God and if God's got something for me he'll tell me little did I know in about 30 minutes after that time I heard his voice say is there anything too hard for the Lorden I ask you T brother Jim is there anything too hard

your bones your skin your eyes your tissue will turn back to acids and gases and there won't be one spoonful of you left is there anything too hard for the Lord that God cannot give you a brand new body well if God can do that to a body that don't even exist cannot God go into a body that has migraines or God go into a body that has a tumor or a grow or TB or whatever it is and be able to heal that body or a person that's just bearing something that's invisible it's just a heavy oppression on their mind and they're under this thing and they just seem like they can't break through is that
