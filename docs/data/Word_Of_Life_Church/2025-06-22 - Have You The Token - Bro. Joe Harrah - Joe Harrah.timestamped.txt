[9:58] if you get ready to pray over these
[9:59] prayer requests here just in a few

[10:24] tear in his knee. So, the Maxwells are
[10:26] asking that we would remember those
[10:28] requests. Chase Hughes, prayers for my
[10:31] family and Aunt Mildred having severe

[11:28] Pray for peace in the world. We just

[12:22] mindful of that situation. The son of
[12:25] brother of one of brother uh Keith

[13:57] requests this morning. I know there's
[13:59] many needs among us today. But I'm glad
[14:01] we're serving a God that's bigger than
[14:03] all our problems, bigger than war,
[14:06] bigger than anything that the devil
[14:08] would bring against you. He's bigger.
[14:10] Somebody say, "It's the truth." Anyhow,
[14:12] give the Lord one more good hand clap of
[14:14] praise. Amen.
[14:17] Let's sing that little course one more

[15:10] There's a lot of prayer requests this
[15:11] morning. I'm sure there's a lot for the
[15:13] people in this congregation as well. But
[15:16] we know one who can meet all these
[15:18] needs. Every single one of them in our
[15:20] heart. Lord, I I know for me with
[15:23] questions about stability in our whole
[15:27] world there a lot of people take it to
[15:32] start to worrying about things, but we
[15:33] know there's one that has it all in
[15:35] control. We have no need no need to
[15:38] worry. So, we're just going to take it
[15:39] to our father and just bow with me and
[15:41] just agree if you would. Heavenly
[15:43] Father, Lord, we know you are the

[16:11] request, Lord, we believe for the best
[16:14] outcome, Lord, because it's what you
[16:17] have in mind, Lord. That's what we're
[16:19] going to request this morning. Not

[16:25] Lord. We pray that you would this
[16:27] morning come down and just wash us with
[16:29] the water of your word, Lord. That you'd

[16:35] in the time that we're in. We know Lord

[19:22] so we're going to have to wait a second.
[19:25] We used to sing it so much. I think uh

[19:31] he was going to school and they was
[19:32] doing music and he asked him if they
[19:34] knew Rising Up.

[19:54] Just like in the days of old. Yes, Lord.

[21:07] They sing and shout while surrounded by
[21:10] God's holy angel band.

[22:29] Lord. Signs and wonders were done by the
[22:32] apostles hands.
[22:35] Demon spirits were cast out in the jail.

[22:42] God's holy angel band. Bless your name,
[22:46] Lord. Well, if you're worried it's all

[23:56] New Testament
[23:59] fully restored by Malachi 4
[24:05] and we're rising up.
[24:10] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise.
[24:13] Hallelujah. Brother Joel Brown, if
[24:15] you'll come on to the platform. Brother
[24:17] Larry's got a song for us this morning.
[24:19] You can be seated. God bless you. Thank
[24:22] you for singing so good this morning.
[24:34] A few years ago, I was in the hospital
[24:37] for a serious surgery and I shouldn't be
[24:40] here today. And Tanya was in another
[24:42] hospital in the COVID ward and they
[24:46] didn't expect her to live either.
[24:49] But we both had a piece. We didn't know
[24:51] what was going to happen, but we knew
[24:53] who Jesus was. And our whole life, we're
[24:57] thankful that we're still here. Though
[24:59] we go through a lot of troubles and
[25:01] trials, the Lord has kept us through a
[25:03] lot of things.
[25:06] And I wanted to say that when we had
[25:08] that total peace,
[25:11] we knew that whatever happened, Jesus
[25:14] would be with us both. And we both had
[25:16] peace through that whole thing. That's
[25:18] what this song is about. It's not about
[25:21] death, but it's about trust. It's about
[25:23] knowing that when and not if we face a
[25:26] crossing in life, whether it's physical
[25:28] or emotional or spiritual or even the
[25:30] final one, we don't cross alone. God
[25:33] meets us at the w's edge.
[25:38] There's a river
[25:41] somewhere
[25:44] called Jordan.
[25:47] [Music]
[25:50] They say
[25:52] that it's teeny.
[25:55] It's why
[26:01] they say
[26:04] the king and
[26:06] the beggar
[26:12] on that shore will
[26:15] stand side
[26:18] by side
[26:19] [Music]
[26:23] at the crossing. King
[26:29] of the Jordan.
[26:31] [Music]
[26:34] Why should I be
[26:38] afraid? There'll be someone
[26:43] there who loves me
[26:46] will guide me
[26:48] [Applause]
[26:51] across the river
[26:54] [Music]
[26:57] to endless
[27:00] joy
[27:03] above
[27:05] [Music]
[27:08] That river
[27:11] is so dark
[27:14] and stormy,
[27:16] [Music]
[27:19] but it'll pass
[27:22] like a dream in
[27:25] the night.
[27:30] But my soul
[27:33] will awaken
[27:36] in that morning
[27:38] [Music]
[27:42] to reach us
[27:45] of endless
[27:47] delight
[27:52] at the crossing
[27:54] [Music]
[27:58] of the
[28:03] Why should I be
[28:06] afraid? There'll be someone
[28:11] there who loves me,
[28:14] will guide me
[28:19] across the river
[28:23] [Music]
[28:25] to endless
[28:28] joy
[28:31] above
[28:36] at the crossing.
[28:38] [Music]
[28:41] of the Jordan.
[28:45] [Music]
[28:46] Why should I be
[28:50] afraid? There'll be someone
[28:55] there who loves me,
[28:58] will guide me
[29:02] across the Jordan.
[29:05] [Music]
[29:08] To endless
[29:11] joys
[29:14] above
[29:16] [Applause]
[29:17] [Music]
[29:19] to endless
[29:22] choice
[29:25] above. Oh,
[29:26] [Music]
[29:32] [Applause]
[29:41] [Music]
[29:44] she was a virgin bride to be.
[29:52] And one night as she lay quietly,
[29:58] the spirit of the Lord over shadowed her
[30:08] and said that you receive this child
[30:15] [Music]
[30:18] not defiled.
[30:20] And she said, "Pead it unto me
[30:26] according to thy word."
[30:30] [Music]
[30:32] And she kept these things
[30:38] and ponder them
[30:42] deep within her heart.
[30:48] She believed in God
[30:54] when he said that something new was
[30:59] going to stop.
[31:03] [Music]
[31:05] How if this word could be born
[31:11] in Mary,
[31:16] then I believe it can be born in you and
[31:22] me.
[31:27] Now we're the virgin bride today. You
[31:32] believe this? Say through the blood of
[31:36] Calary
[31:39] and in this time of darkness we have
[31:44] come
[31:46] [Music]
[31:49] received of indicated
[31:52] word
[31:55] that we all have heard and I be
[32:01] speaking formed
[32:04] in you and me
[32:09] because we can be seen
[32:14] [Applause]
[32:15] and
[32:17] them
[32:19] deep within our heart.
[32:25] He say with this word
[32:29] [Music]
[32:31] never one time felt desires to depart.
[32:41] Now if this word could be born
[32:46] in Mary
[32:51] then I believe it can be formed in you
[32:56] and me.
[32:59] Listen this is what the Lord told me
[33:01] time and time again. I try
[33:06] to understand the reason why.
[33:11] There are those who walk away from this
[33:17] revealed world
[33:21] and say that it's just not for me.
[33:26] [Music]
[33:27] And the light they no longer see.
[33:31] But I only know it's leading me to
[33:37] eternity.
[33:38] [Music]
[33:41] And I'll keep these things
[33:47] and I'll ponder them over and over over
[33:51] deep within mine.
[33:56] I'm going to stay with this world.
[34:02] Never once in my soul desire to part.
[34:09] [Applause]
[34:12] Now if this word could be born
[34:18] in Mary,
[34:22] I believe it can be formed in you and
[34:28] me.
[34:32] And we'll keep these. How about you?
[34:35] You're going to keep this word. Oh, and
[34:38] ponder those words. deep
[34:43] within our hearts.
[34:48] You say with this world
[34:52] never one time feel
[34:56] [Music]
[34:58] I stay with this word because
[35:03] if this word
[35:08] could be formed in Mary
[35:12] then I believe it can be born in you end
[35:18] of me.
[35:22] Now if this word could be formed
[35:28] in Mary
[35:35] I'm silly and small enough to believe it
[35:40] could be born
[35:42] in me.
[35:46] [Music]
[35:48] [Applause]
[35:49] [Music]
[36:03] Yeah.
[36:15] Bibles and you turn to Exodus,
[36:20] chapter 12.
[36:28] We're going to read verse 3 through 7
[36:30] there.
[36:36] Speak ye unto the all the congregation
[36:38] of Israel, saying, In the 10th day of
[36:40] this month, they shall take to them
[36:43] every man a lamb, according to the house
[36:45] of their fathers, a lamb for a house.
[36:48] And if the household be too little for
[36:49] the lamb, let him and his neighbor next
[36:52] unto his house take it according to the
[36:53] number of the souls. Every man according
[36:56] to his eating shall make your count for
[36:59] the lamb. Your lamb shall be without
[37:02] blemish, a male of the first year. You
[37:05] shall take it out from the sheep or from
[37:07] the goats, and you shall keep it until
[37:09] the 14th day of the same month. The
[37:11] whole assembly of the congre of
[37:14] congregation of Israel shall kill it in
[37:16] the evening. And they shall take of the
[37:19] blood and strike it on the two side post
[37:22] and the upper doorpost of the house,
[37:25] wherein they shall eat it. And we'll go
[37:27] down to verse 13. And the blood shall be
[37:30] to you for a token upon the houses where
[37:33] you are. And when I see the blood, I
[37:35] will pass over you. And the plague shall
[37:37] not be unto you or destroy you when I
[37:40] smite the land of Egypt. Let's bow our
[37:43] heads.
[37:45] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful,
[37:47] Lord, for another another morning to
[37:49] come sit around your word, Lord. Lord, I
[37:52] pray, Father, that they didn't come here
[37:54] to hear from me this morning, but Lord,
[37:56] they came to hear from you, Lord. I pray
[37:59] that that you would set me aside, Lord.
[38:01] anything, Father, that would stumble
[38:03] them or, Lord, be a stumbling block,
[38:07] Father, that would hinder them their
[38:09] walk with you. Father, I pray that
[38:11] nothing like that would come out this
[38:13] morning, Father. Lord, may it be just
[38:14] you and you only meet the needs here,
[38:17] Lord. We know there's many needs,
[38:18] sickness, and all kinds of things.
[38:20] Father, I pray that your will would be
[38:22] done, Father. We know in your word, your
[38:24] prophet said that you healing comes
[38:25] through the preaching of the word. Lord,
[38:28] may they reach out and grab a hold of
[38:29] every need that they have, Father, that
[38:30] you pray that you would meet it this
[38:32] morning. We're believing you for it. We
[38:34] welcome you this morning in Jesus name.
[38:37] Amen. You can be seated.
[38:41] I want to speak to you uh a few minutes
[38:44] for uh
[38:47] about a subject that I've titled, have
[38:49] you the token?
[38:52] This is something we know that's been
[38:54] preached
[38:56] in the message quite often and brother
[38:57] Brandham mentioned the token like 480
[39:00] something times.
[39:03] So in 63 I know he preached it in March
[39:06] 63. He pre preached it in September 63
[39:09] and March 64 several times he preached
[39:12] it. But in 63 he says now there's a life
[39:15] a blood a life and a soul in the life.
[39:18] The soul is the nature of the life.
[39:20] Therefore, it had no certain nature. It
[39:22] was an animal. Therefore, the blood
[39:24] stood for a token that the life had been
[39:26] given. But in this glorious place under
[39:29] this covenant, there is a difference
[39:30] between the blood and the life. The
[39:33] token for the believer today is the Holy
[39:35] Ghost. Not a blood, not a chemistry. It
[39:37] is the Holy Spirit of God. That is the
[39:39] token that God requires for the church
[39:41] today. God must see this token. He must
[39:43] see it in every one of us. Brother
[39:46] Brandon was talking about the Holy Ghost
[39:47] in your life. If you have the token,
[39:49] people say they have the token, they
[39:50] have the Holy Ghost. If you say you have
[39:52] the Holy Ghost, you're saying you have
[39:53] the token. You say you have the token,
[39:55] you're saying you have the Holy Ghost.
[39:57] And then in 64, he says, "Now that's a
[40:00] type of today shown as we are also
[40:02] facing another exodus. God bringing
[40:05] Israel out of Egypt to the promised land
[40:06] was a type of Christ bringing the bride
[40:08] out of the church and to the promised
[40:11] land. We are in another exodus." We look
[40:13] at the times that we're in right now. If
[40:15] you ne if you never needed a token,
[40:19] today's the time you need the token. We
[40:21] we look at the the world around us is in
[40:23] chaos. There's no other word for it.
[40:25] It's total chaos. And it you you look at
[40:29] the things you know that the US just
[40:31] recently their actions on Iran has
[40:33] raised the eyebrows of some of the
[40:34] world's strongest powers. Now the whole
[40:37] world's eyes is on Israel. Yeah. But so
[40:40] is God's eyes. Yeah. God gave them a
[40:43] token through Abraham thousands of years
[40:46] ago.
[40:48] Brother said it's unconditional.
[40:51] So whatever they go through, they're
[40:52] going to win.
[40:54] They're going to win. And so are you.
[40:58] So we we we look at this and and you
[41:00] know what we say, what is a token? If
[41:02] you if you look at the what a token is,
[41:04] if you read the the the Hebrew there,
[41:06] it's Brother Brandon preached the
[41:07] message, an insign. That's pretty much
[41:09] another word when one brother Brandham
[41:10] used for preaching the token was the end
[41:12] sign. It's a sign. It's a monument, a
[41:14] beacon. And and if it's something that's
[41:16] in your life, it's shining out.
[41:19] You know, you you you see people want to
[41:21] testify to you how much they they have
[41:22] the token, how much they have the Holy
[41:24] Ghost, and their life never changes.
[41:26] There's no fruits. There's there there's
[41:28] nothing there. You're looking cuz if you
[41:29] have it, it's going to shine out. It's a
[41:32] monument. It's a beacon. It's a sign.
[41:34] You got a big sale going on at your
[41:36] place. You put this big huge sign with
[41:38] flashing things on it. It says it's
[41:40] right here. That's what your life would
[41:42] should be pointing to the token and
[41:43] saying it's right here and we can see
[41:45] the fruits thereof. Amen.
[41:48] You can't have the pe the token and
[41:50] people not know it. You know, God
[41:52] required a lamb without blemish. And
[41:54] that's when we we look at that when God
[41:56] required the token for the children of
[41:59] Israel. It had to be without blemish.
[42:01] This was the type of the lamb that he
[42:03] that was was slain for you. The blood of
[42:06] that lamb was painted upon the doorpost
[42:07] of your heart over the lentil of your
[42:10] soul and that sealed you to your day of
[42:12] redemption.
[42:14] And we we look at that in the way that
[42:16] the type is it's just a perfect type. It
[42:18] had to be a lamb without blemish.
[42:22] But without that token with these the
[42:26] firstborn had no way they couldn't be
[42:27] saved. There was no way they could be
[42:29] saved. You look at other all the other
[42:32] people that was was in there with that
[42:34] firstborn.
[42:36] They weren't firstborn.
[42:38] Yeah. But they were still behind it.
[42:41] Yeah. They didn't that blood wasn't for
[42:43] them.
[42:45] Come on. God put that blood for a
[42:47] specific race of people, a specific
[42:50] class of people. The same thing he's
[42:52] done today in this age. This token was
[42:55] for the bride.
[42:57] Thank you, Lord. And we'll find out
[42:59] later. You know, you look at whosoever
[43:01] will, the Bible says whosoever will, you
[43:03] come unto me. And you got to understand
[43:05] when God gave that covenant to Abraham,
[43:07] he gave it to you as well. Brother Bram
[43:09] said, the covenant he gave to Abraham
[43:11] was to the bride. You are the royal seed
[43:13] of Abraham. And when he said this token
[43:16] that you had to have, look at the
[43:18] conditions that he made with Adam and
[43:20] Eve. It was conditional. If you do this,
[43:22] I'll do that. And so many times we tried
[43:25] to live that way in our life. God, if
[43:27] you'll do this for me, I'll do that. We
[43:30] try to put conditions on the covenant
[43:33] that we have with God.
[43:35] And God says, I can't put a token on
[43:37] that, but I'll do it for you. How many
[43:40] times have we done that for God? Say,
[43:41] God, if you'll do this for me, I'll do
[43:44] this. And God says, okay, I'll do it.
[43:49] And then you go back on your word. And
[43:51] then you're back in the same mess you
[43:52] were in and even worse. And then you
[43:54] said, "God, if you'll help me out of
[43:55] this, I'll do this."
[43:57] And God says, "That's what you said last
[44:00] time, but okay.
[44:03] Why?
[44:04] He would that no man perish." Right?
[44:07] This is a God that just loved mankind so
[44:10] much,
[44:12] even those without the token.
[44:15] God loved those without the token. But
[44:18] on the bride, when he placed that token,
[44:20] it was on an unconditional covenant.
[44:23] unconditional. Why do you think you can
[44:25] f so many times?
[44:28] So many times and God still sees the
[44:31] door on the blood on the doorpost.
[44:33] You have fought why he made an
[44:35] unconditional covenant with you. No
[44:38] matter how many times you fall, you you
[44:40] you you make mistakes.
[44:43] You know how how do you get this token?
[44:45] Brother said it was so simple and he
[44:47] used the the way that they they put the
[44:50] the the blood on the doorpost. this this
[44:52] hipw weed. It's just a a simple common
[44:55] weed. And brother Brandham said it's
[44:56] that simple. It's that that hissip was
[44:58] faith.
[45:00] They used the hissip weed to to put the
[45:03] blood on the doorpost. And he says it
[45:04] just takes simple faith to accept this
[45:08] token.
[45:09] Simple faith.
[45:11] You know, I might might have said here
[45:13] before. I mean many years ago we at
[45:15] brother Rob's house and brother Donnie
[45:16] had some of the the ministers there do
[45:19] question and answers and and you know we
[45:21] took different topics and mine was the
[45:23] Holy Ghost and this one brother
[45:26] I asked him I said he was a young man
[45:28] then he's older and got kids now I said
[45:30] do how the question was how do how do I
[45:34] get the Holy Ghost how do I get the
[45:36] token
[45:38] and I told him I said let me ask you a
[45:40] question do you like cookies he said oh
[45:43] Yeah, I like cookies. I said, "Where do
[45:46] your parents keep them?" "Oh, they keep
[45:48] them in the pantry."
[45:51] So, what do you do if you want one?
[45:54] I go get it.
[45:57] You go get it. It's that simple. We
[46:01] complicate
[46:03] the thing God the things God wants to
[46:05] give to us. We complicate it.
[46:08] You go get it. It's free.
[46:11] It's it's just like on your birthday
[46:13] when you you're the you're the one that
[46:15] that they're celebrating and you get
[46:17] there and this cake it's got your name
[46:19] on it.
[46:21] You got presents with your name on it.
[46:23] No one can open them but you.
[46:26] They belong to you.
[46:29] And so nobody's going to say nothing if
[46:32] you go over start ripping them open. If
[46:33] you go start eating the cake because
[46:35] it's yours. It belongs to you. the token
[46:38] that God had when it came out. The whole
[46:41] brother Ben said it wasn't. The blood
[46:43] wasn't the token.
[46:46] If the blood was the token, our
[46:48] generation would be lost.
[46:51] It's all dried up. It's gone. And the
[46:53] body, human body only holds a certain
[46:55] amount of blood. So, if we had to have
[46:57] the literal blood of Christ to touch our
[47:00] lives, we'd be lost.
[47:03] But the life that was in the blood was
[47:05] eternal.
[47:07] That's the token that the the life that
[47:09] he shed. You you look at whenever the
[47:12] death angel passed, you got to
[47:13] understand something. The death angel's
[47:15] passing here this morning. It's passing
[47:18] in your life every day.
[47:21] And what what did this death angel see
[47:23] when it came past this house with the
[47:26] blood on the door? He had seen a life
[47:28] had already been taken
[47:31] and had to recognize a life was already
[47:34] gone. I have to pass by this. I cannot
[47:36] go in there. Something gave up its life.
[47:40] When the death angel comes to you, looks
[47:42] at you, sees the blood in your life.
[47:49] He has to move on.
[47:53] He has to move on.
[47:55] A life has already been taken for you.
[48:01] It's already been taken. There's nothing
[48:03] There's nothing he can do.
[48:06] And he he wants you more than anybody.
[48:08] That's why he comes in your life so many
[48:11] times. And I don't mean physically.
[48:15] He would rather make you spiritually
[48:17] dead than physically dead.
[48:23] That's why when you got the token,
[48:26] when we you lay you up here, they say
[48:28] words over you, you're not dead.
[48:32] There's no death right there. There's no
[48:35] death
[48:37] because a life was given to take the
[48:40] death from you. Amen.
[48:46] You look at the thief on the cross and
[48:48] if any none of y'all saw the play that
[48:50] the the youth did over here at the youth
[48:52] banquet
[48:55] simply wonderful
[48:57] showing this token.
[49:00] Sister Adessa was what they called a
[49:01] gate agent.
[49:04] And this what kind of got me on this
[49:05] sermon. Brother Robin, some of them
[49:07] asked me if I would talk about it
[49:10] after the play
[49:13] and I got to thinking about that. She's
[49:15] she was the gate agent. And then they
[49:17] would they would come up and you know
[49:19] they would they would say, "Well, I've
[49:20] got this." Sister Allison would say,
[49:22] "Well, you know, I've look how long my
[49:23] hair is. Have never cut it. Look all
[49:26] these beautiful things that that that
[49:28] I've done to my hair. It's God's glory.
[49:31] And she'd do a little bit of this, a
[49:33] little bit of that. You know, Brother
[49:35] Isaac Mardo walked up there, these big
[49:37] muscles,
[49:39] how much he's been taking care of the
[49:41] temple.
[49:44] Brother Timothy walks up there with a
[49:46] bag full of bucks. One of them called
[49:48] the token.
[49:51] You can't get in.
[49:54] You can't get in.
[49:56] You have to have the life to get in. And
[49:59] and I was thinking about that and
[50:01] brother Robinson said, "Would you say
[50:02] something afterwards?" And for for some
[50:04] reason, and I told them, "I have no idea
[50:07] why
[50:09] I thought of the thief on the cross."
[50:12] Yeah.
[50:14] I mean, I was watching the play when
[50:16] they were rehearsing and that thought of
[50:19] the thief on the cross.
[50:23] Do you understand thief on the cross?
[50:27] When that lifeblood
[50:30] was shed on Calvary,
[50:33] he was sinless.
[50:37] Probably never lived one single day of
[50:39] his life for God. Ever.
[50:41] Never lived one day.
[50:45] But G when he said, "Remember me," Jesus
[50:47] didn't have a choice.
[50:50] He had no choice because when he looked
[50:53] at him, he was blameless
[50:55] cuz the life was already poured out.
[50:58] Amen. All mankind at that m that moment
[51:02] on earth if they would have accepted it.
[51:05] Why couldn't Jesus look at this other
[51:07] thief
[51:08] and see him blameless? He never accepted
[51:11] it.
[51:13] He never accepted. If he would have, he
[51:15] would have been found blameless
[51:18] cuz the very token was running down the
[51:20] cross.
[51:24] And this this thief is the first
[51:28] passenger
[51:30] on the flight to paradise.
[51:34] Get on my flight.
[51:39] And you could look at him and you think,
[51:41] "What about all that baggage?
[51:44] What about all that baggage that he's
[51:46] carrying?
[51:48] Murder, theft, probably lived an immoral
[51:51] life. And all this baggage, it can't go
[51:53] to paradise."
[51:55] What he didn't know,
[51:57] this flight was stopping in hell first.
[52:02] This flight was going to hell and was
[52:04] going to dump off his baggage right
[52:06] where it came from.
[52:09] Why? Because he accepted the token.
[52:13] Accepted the token. If you accepted the
[52:16] token, why do you keep looking at the
[52:18] bad things in your life that you're
[52:19] doing now? If you said, "I've got one.
[52:22] I'm getting on this flight. I' I've got
[52:24] the token. I've applied it to my life."
[52:27] Then why you keep bringing up your
[52:29] mistakes and your failures?
[52:32] Why you keep bringing up the things that
[52:33] Satan keeps throwing at you? All you
[52:35] have to do is show him the token. It's a
[52:37] beacon. It's a sign. It's a light. It's
[52:39] a monument.
[52:41] And that's what he's looking at.
[52:46] Brother said, "Then it's yours by faith.
[52:50] As soon as you pick up the hiss of faith
[52:51] and apply the blood, something happens
[52:54] in every man's heart and every woman's
[52:57] heart when they do that.
[53:01] Let's look look back at at the in goan
[53:06] here. God's judgment's coming through
[53:07] Egypt and it's coming through goan.
[53:10] God's judgment is coming in here.
[53:13] It don't matter this is word of life
[53:15] church.
[53:17] God don't look at the token over the
[53:18] church.
[53:20] Death angel's passing this way.
[53:23] He's looking for the blood.
[53:26] Have you got it? Come on. Have you got
[53:29] it?
[53:33] God passed judgment into the world that
[53:35] we live in. It's coming to you where you
[53:37] love you. You live. You have to be
[53:39] behind the token.
[53:44] I got so far ahead of myself. Sorry
[53:46] about that.
[53:49] So what was the token in Egypt for? It
[53:52] was to turn away death.
[53:55] The token life that was shed for yours
[53:56] does the same thing today in Ephesians
[53:59] when when physical death or spiritual
[54:01] death Paul's telling him he says you
[54:03] hath he quickened. Sorry brothers that's
[54:05] not in this this I put this in there
[54:07] while ago. Sorry. Ephesians 2
[54:11] and one he says you hath he quickened
[54:13] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[54:16] even when we were dead in sins and hath
[54:18] quickened us together with Christ by
[54:21] grace are you saved you didn't earn the
[54:24] token
[54:25] you didn't do anything to earn it
[54:29] you might have felt you've lived a
[54:30] blameless life you might have felt like
[54:32] you read your Bible and pray I pay I
[54:34] double my tithes I double my offerings
[54:38] I I I I I there ain't not I in token.
[54:45] It's not about you. It's about him
[54:48] living in you.
[54:50] You want him to live so much in you.
[54:52] This token beyond this place that it
[54:55] shines so bright that it washes all the
[54:57] humanity out when people look at you.
[54:59] There's no humanity for people to see.
[55:03] We get so enamored by by our good works,
[55:06] the things we're doing. We want people
[55:07] to know you. We put it on Facebook. Hey,
[55:09] I I I I gave so and so some money today
[55:12] because this and this and this. I did
[55:14] this. I did this.
[55:16] It's all about God. And that's what the
[55:19] token in your life should be saying this
[55:21] is about him. This is not about me. This
[55:23] is about the life that was was taken in
[55:26] in place of mine. Amen. Yes, sir.
[55:31] And Paul says, "Hath raised us up
[55:33] together and made us sit in heavenly
[55:35] places in Christ Jesus." You were dead
[55:37] in your sins. He's quickened you with
[55:39] the token.
[55:41] That's what quickened you was the token.
[55:43] It brought you from a dead man. You went
[55:45] up here in in the watery grave and come
[55:47] up and then filled with the Holy Ghost.
[55:50] That made you that that's what quickened
[55:52] you.
[55:54] Look at the physical. In Thessalonians,
[55:57] Paul tells him in 1 Thessalonians 4, but
[55:59] I would not have you ignorant, brethren,
[56:01] concerning them that which are asleep.
[56:04] He did not say them that are dead, them
[56:07] that are asleep, that you sorrow not
[56:10] even as others which have no hope. For
[56:13] if we believe that Jesus died and rose
[56:15] again, even so them which sleep in Jesus
[56:17] will God bring with him. Those that
[56:20] sleep in Jesus, right? Amen. That's got
[56:24] no hold.
[56:26] The token took that away from him. The
[56:29] the the the grave grave where's your
[56:31] victory. Death is where is your your
[56:33] sting. This is a revelation that David
[56:35] got in in in the in the Old Testament
[56:39] when this this life becomes becomes you.
[56:43] You become that life. Everything in this
[56:46] world totally changes. It reverses. You
[56:50] have power over the grave. You have
[56:52] power over death. Hell has no hold on
[56:55] you. Sickness has no hold on you.
[56:58] Cancer, depression, anxiety, bitterness,
[57:00] gossip, whatever it is, has no hold on
[57:02] you
[57:03] because you're letting the token live
[57:05] through you. Yes. And for we say, for we
[57:09] say unto you by the word of the Lord
[57:11] that we which are alive and remain unto
[57:14] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[57:16] them which are asleep. Amen.
[57:21] For God only if God only required DNA
[57:24] chemistry, anybody could have died. Huh?
[57:27] God could have picked anybody he want.
[57:31] But this was a created be. This was a
[57:33] created beaten by God. He created the
[57:34] egg. He created the cell. Uh-huh.
[57:42] Getting back to the people there in Gan.
[57:46] You know me, I I chop things up and it's
[57:48] it's a mess. I apologize.
[57:50] But the specific class of people knew
[57:53] they needed the token.
[57:56] When you think of the other people, hey,
[57:58] I'm not a firstborn. I'm only I'm only
[58:01] in in in the the the the class of people
[58:04] by by marriage, they had some of those.
[58:08] You you look at the the ones that were
[58:10] concerned about the token was the
[58:12] firstborn. They knew they had to have
[58:14] it.
[58:16] You you get a young kid that may maybe
[58:18] he was 10, 12 years old, but yet he
[58:21] understood the message that Moses was
[58:23] preaching. He understood, I've got to
[58:25] have that, Dad. I have to have it. I'm
[58:29] your firstborn.
[58:33] You are God's firstborn. Christ, right?
[58:36] Christ was the firstborn and his life
[58:37] came back into you. You became him. He
[58:41] became you. So, you have to have the
[58:43] token applied. You have to if the death
[58:46] comes by, you've got to know that's
[58:48] applied in your life. And so this this
[58:51] firstborn child, whether it be a boy or
[58:53] a girl, they they were old enough to
[58:54] understand what the message that went
[58:56] out that Moses was preaching this
[58:58] message
[59:00] that you have to this is what you got to
[59:02] do. You've got to take this lamb and and
[59:04] it's got to be without blemish.
[59:07] Don't you know he would probably go say,
[59:09] "Dad, let me let me help you find that
[59:11] lamb." He wanted to make sure that his
[59:13] daddy got the right one. Yeah. You
[59:15] wanted to make sure you there wasn't one
[59:17] spot in that lamb when you took it,
[59:20] right?
[59:23] There was all kinds of people
[59:26] that might have been in the household
[59:28] with them.
[59:30] The same kind of people sit with you
[59:31] here today. They're not so much
[59:33] concerned about the token as you are.
[59:36] Brother Brandham, I read a quote
[59:37] yesterday where brother Brandham said,
[59:38] "There always will be always
[59:42] three kinds of believers in the church."
[59:44] always. You're not going to go to a
[59:46] church and and sit in there and
[59:48] everybody believes everything the same
[59:50] way. Right.
[59:53] Right. You got the believer, the
[59:54] unbeliever, and the makebeliever.
[59:58] And so many times the make believer, you
[1:00:00] might think they have the token more
[1:00:01] than anybody else.
[1:00:04] And they'll be held more accountable
[1:00:05] than anybody else because it was offered
[1:00:10] offered time and time again. Listen.
[1:00:14] Y'all, you know if you got the token or
[1:00:16] not.
[1:00:17] You should know if you've got the token
[1:00:19] or not at this late hour. You should
[1:00:21] know if if it's been applied to your
[1:00:24] life. What is your desire?
[1:00:28] Come on. What is your desire from your
[1:00:32] soul?
[1:00:34] That's how you know if you have the
[1:00:35] token. How are you when you're by
[1:00:38] yourself?
[1:00:40] when you or you're in a place where
[1:00:42] there's no believers, do you act the
[1:00:44] same way you you do here? Come on. Do
[1:00:48] you act the same way when you come
[1:00:49] around God's people?
[1:00:53] That's something serious to think about.
[1:00:57] Because the token is the only thing the
[1:01:00] only thing that will get you out of
[1:01:01] here. Pretending you have it will not
[1:01:05] get you out of here. No,
[1:01:08] having a form of worship, a a form of
[1:01:11] godliness will not get you out of here.
[1:01:15] You will be judged at the great white
[1:01:16] throne judgment.
[1:01:19] Because when you you look at what the
[1:01:21] token is, it's God's life in you. And
[1:01:23] God's life will do the same thing it
[1:01:25] done when he was here. Amen. It's the
[1:01:28] same life. Amen.
[1:01:34] They weren't sitting around with their
[1:01:36] arms crossed wondering if Moses and
[1:01:39] Aaron were hurry up and get finished
[1:01:40] with the message.
[1:01:43] They wouldn't come and worrying about
[1:01:45] who was preaching.
[1:01:48] They wanted to hear from Jehovah.
[1:01:50] They wanted to hear from God. It doesn't
[1:01:52] matter who's up here. It doesn't matter.
[1:01:54] And I know human nature. Human nature.
[1:01:57] Everybody's got somebody they enjoy.
[1:02:00] Yeah. But when I have a need, I have a
[1:02:03] need in here. And I'm coming to church.
[1:02:06] I'm praying all the time. I'm not
[1:02:08] thinking who's going to be there. I'm
[1:02:10] thinking, God, what do you have for me?
[1:02:13] What do you have for me? Because I know
[1:02:15] the token will pull on the token from up
[1:02:17] here. If I'm out there and I need
[1:02:21] something, I'm pulling it from right
[1:02:23] here. I'm not pulling it for the guy
[1:02:24] right here. I'm pulling it from God
[1:02:26] himself.
[1:02:28] That's right.
[1:02:32] Brother Ram says token in Mark 64. Now,
[1:02:35] Israel's slain lamb was the requirement
[1:02:37] of Jehovah. The blood was the token that
[1:02:40] the job had been done.
[1:02:42] God required for redemption from Egypt
[1:02:44] to go to the promised land. He required
[1:02:47] a slain animal and that animal must have
[1:02:49] the blood of the dead animal must put on
[1:02:51] the lint and on the door. That stood for
[1:02:54] the token that the thing that Jehovah
[1:02:55] had required had been fulfilled.
[1:02:58] The lamb was not the token. The blood
[1:03:00] was the token. He goes on and says in
[1:03:03] Jehovah Gyra that the life in the blood
[1:03:05] was the token. The blood stood for the
[1:03:07] token that sign and this believer had
[1:03:09] done exactly what the requirement was.
[1:03:11] That was the token. You know, there's
[1:03:13] times in your life when you know, I
[1:03:15] think God gives you a settles it in your
[1:03:17] heart that you're you're living right. I
[1:03:20] think God gives us peace with that
[1:03:22] sometimes. I know we got high mountains,
[1:03:24] we got low valleys and and all this and
[1:03:26] sometimes you're on the mountain and God
[1:03:28] reassures you. You're doing exactly what
[1:03:29] I want you to do. Amen. I believe that
[1:03:31] with all my heart. God settles it.
[1:03:33] You're you're you're doing exactly what
[1:03:35] I want you to do. And and once that
[1:03:37] settles, sometimes he drops you back
[1:03:39] down
[1:03:41] and you you're wondering what what did I
[1:03:44] do that that I've I've applied the token
[1:03:46] to my life. I'm doing this. God, you
[1:03:48] gave me a piece and all of a sudden the
[1:03:50] world's falling down around me.
[1:03:52] Everything's falling apart.
[1:03:54] I don't understand the way things are
[1:03:56] going.
[1:04:00] In desperations in 63, the Bible said in
[1:04:03] Hebrews the 6th chapter, the rain fallth
[1:04:05] on the just and the unjust just the
[1:04:08] same. That's why you sit in service
[1:04:09] sometimes and you think everybody's got
[1:04:11] the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:14] You think everybody's got the Holy Ghost
[1:04:16] cuz everybody's jumping and shouting and
[1:04:18] moving. The rain falls on the just and
[1:04:20] the unjust.
[1:04:21] Amen. You might have been the person
[1:04:24] painting the taking the hissip and
[1:04:27] painting the the blood on the doorpost
[1:04:29] and you might have got some of that
[1:04:30] blood on you.
[1:04:33] You might have got it all over you when
[1:04:34] you was killing the lamb.
[1:04:37] But if you weren't behind that door,
[1:04:41] it don't matter how much blood you got
[1:04:43] on your flesh, right? It don't matter
[1:04:46] how much token you've got on your flesh.
[1:04:48] Yeah. God says it's got to be sealed to
[1:04:51] the day of your redemption in here.
[1:04:53] Right? We we get people all the time in
[1:04:57] every every service. We see it, you
[1:04:59] know, in meetings and and all this, you
[1:05:00] get people the spirit gets to move and
[1:05:02] it's the true spirit. It's the true Holy
[1:05:06] Spirit and it's moving through the
[1:05:07] place.
[1:05:09] And when it's moving through the place,
[1:05:10] you see people jump and shout. You've
[1:05:12] never seen jump and shout ever in your
[1:05:13] life. Oh yeah.
[1:05:16] They got a little blood on them. on
[1:05:18] their flesh.
[1:05:20] They might have helped painted on the
[1:05:22] door.
[1:05:24] They might have they might have just got
[1:05:26] close to somebody and the emotions ran
[1:05:29] over on them. It happens.
[1:05:33] It happens.
[1:05:35] Human emotion
[1:05:37] moved by spirit, the Holy Spirit on the
[1:05:40] flesh.
[1:05:42] That's why you you you see people that
[1:05:43] they get up and they they jump around.
[1:05:45] They run around. They they spin, they do
[1:05:46] this, they do that. Every time a fast
[1:05:49] song comes on
[1:05:51] when that song goes off, they stop.
[1:05:54] That's not the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:57] I'm not going to argue about about it
[1:05:58] with you, but that's not the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:01] Holy Ghost don't say, "Whoop! Brother
[1:06:03] Harry, quit playing the organ. I got to
[1:06:04] leave."
[1:06:06] It doesn't work that way. There was no
[1:06:08] music in the upper room. That's right.
[1:06:11] Amen. There was no music. In the Bible,
[1:06:13] it says there was music in the upper
[1:06:15] room that that they were singing and
[1:06:17] rising up or running my last mile home.
[1:06:21] The Holy Spirit, they were in one
[1:06:24] accord.
[1:06:26] The token came to them because they were
[1:06:29] in one accord with God.
[1:06:32] If this whole congregation would come in
[1:06:35] here on Sundays or Wednesdays, whenever
[1:06:37] it be in one accord, the Holy Spirit
[1:06:39] will move in here every single time
[1:06:42] because his covenant with you is
[1:06:44] unconditional.
[1:06:46] It's unconditional. Fast music is a
[1:06:49] condition, Brother Jimmy. It's a
[1:06:51] condition,
[1:06:53] right?
[1:06:55] Makes you want to dance. Human nature.
[1:06:58] I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm not
[1:07:00] saying that's wrong at all. I'm just
[1:07:02] saying
[1:07:03] the Holy Ghost
[1:07:05] is not one of repetition.
[1:07:11] He likes only believe.
[1:07:13] Prophet said that was his favorite song.
[1:07:16] Only believe.
[1:07:25] Bram said, "You've got to have the
[1:07:26] token." And when the token comes, it
[1:07:29] testifies of Christ. You're going to
[1:07:31] tell me
[1:07:33] that you have the token. So basically,
[1:07:35] you're telling me when I look at you, I
[1:07:38] see the life of Christ.
[1:07:41] And don't do it here this morning, but
[1:07:43] sometime when you're alone and by
[1:07:44] yourself, think about your life through
[1:07:46] the week when you're not at church and
[1:07:48] think,
[1:07:50] is that of Christ?
[1:07:53] Think about the actions that you do. The
[1:07:56] things you say, the little comments you
[1:07:58] make that might be a little off color.
[1:08:02] Things you say about somebody behind
[1:08:03] their back when they're not there. And
[1:08:05] when when you see them at church, you're
[1:08:06] buddy buddy with them.
[1:08:09] Come on. This is real.
[1:08:11] And you think when you're sitting in
[1:08:13] your car at home by yourself or laying
[1:08:15] in bed in the dark, think?
[1:08:20] Would Christ say, "That's my life." All
[1:08:23] right, brother. And I'm talking about
[1:08:25] all of us. All of us. Cuz so many times
[1:08:28] human nature gets in the way of, "Oh,
[1:08:29] Joe, let me tell you, I I I do a lot of
[1:08:33] repenting all the time."
[1:08:35] And you're going to God knows you make
[1:08:38] mistakes. That's why he made the
[1:08:40] covenant unconditional. Amen. Cuz if he
[1:08:43] had conditions, the Garden of Eden would
[1:08:45] happen all over again.
[1:08:48] His condition with Adam and Eve was
[1:08:50] conditional. His covenant, his covenant
[1:08:52] with Noah was conditional.
[1:08:55] But when Abraham come along, he was a
[1:08:57] friend of God.
[1:08:59] This was God's friend.
[1:09:02] He said, "I'm going to make a covenant
[1:09:04] with you."
[1:09:07] Look at look at all look at the children
[1:09:09] of Israel when they went through the
[1:09:10] wilderness for 40 years.
[1:09:12] You would have thought that God would
[1:09:13] have said, "Forget it, Abraham.
[1:09:16] Forget it. I didn't know all this was
[1:09:17] going to happen." He already knew. He
[1:09:20] already told Abraham, "Your your people
[1:09:22] are going to be in a strange land for
[1:09:24] 400 years." He already knew that. He
[1:09:26] said, "But I'm going to bring them out
[1:09:27] with a mighty hand."
[1:09:30] You think when God knew that he was
[1:09:32] going to bring them out with a mighty
[1:09:33] hand that he didn't know they were going
[1:09:35] to murmur, complain, build graven
[1:09:37] images? He knew it all and he still said
[1:09:40] it's unconditional.
[1:09:44] Lord,
[1:09:45] it testifies of Christ. He said it
[1:09:47] would. Christ is the word. How can you
[1:09:49] deny that the Bible is true, part of it,
[1:09:51] and still say that you have the token
[1:09:53] when the token is the testimony of Jesus
[1:09:56] Christ? Your token has a testimony.
[1:10:02] It has a testimony. It's a witness. Your
[1:10:04] token is a witness of the life of
[1:10:07] Christ. Amen.
[1:10:10] You see people have testimony services
[1:10:13] and nobody wants to say nothing.
[1:10:17] That again is human nature.
[1:10:21] Make Daniel boss stand up and see what
[1:10:22] happens.
[1:10:25] See, he spent his head down.
[1:10:28] He always says, "Man, I have no idea how
[1:10:30] you can get up there in front of
[1:10:31] people."
[1:10:33] But that's human nature,
[1:10:35] you know. It It ain't that you ain't got
[1:10:37] something to testify. God says, "I'll
[1:10:39] testify through your life." Yeah. When
[1:10:42] people look at you, they're getting a
[1:10:43] testimony. They're getting a witness.
[1:10:47] Amen.
[1:10:50] So, here's what he tells Abraham.
[1:10:52] Genesis 17. And I will establish my
[1:10:55] covenant between me and thee, and thy
[1:10:57] seed after thee, and the generations for
[1:10:58] an everlasting covenant,
[1:11:00] and to thy seed after thee, the land
[1:11:02] wherein thou art a stranger, all the
[1:11:04] land of Canaan, for an everlasting
[1:11:06] possession. I will be their God. That's
[1:11:08] what they're fighting for right now.
[1:11:10] They're fighting for what God gave
[1:11:12] Abraham. When God told Abraham, Abraham
[1:11:14] was still in a strange land with the
[1:11:16] Chaldans. He said, "Remove yourself.
[1:11:18] Follow me. Come out here. I'll take you
[1:11:19] there." He took him briefly into that
[1:11:21] land. And Abraham built an altar there
[1:11:23] because he knew he was coming back.
[1:11:25] Right? He built an altar that God gave
[1:11:28] him this. If God gives you something,
[1:11:30] you built an altar right there. If God
[1:11:32] gave you healing, you put it there. You
[1:11:35] might not you might not take it today.
[1:11:37] You might not accept it today. You
[1:11:39] think, "Well, patience, you know, I I
[1:11:41] want my healing today." God gave you
[1:11:44] healing. You build an altar on that word
[1:11:46] that God gave you and says, "Right here,
[1:11:48] God said I could have it." Amen. God
[1:11:50] gives you deliverance. He said he could
[1:11:52] have the Holy Ghost. Build you an altar
[1:11:53] on that Holy Ghost. Amen. Cuz God said
[1:11:55] you could have it. That's what Abraham
[1:11:57] did. And unto thee and thy seed after
[1:11:59] thee. Thou are a stranger all the land
[1:12:02] of Canaan for everlasting possession. I
[1:12:04] will be their God. And God said unto
[1:12:06] Abraham, thou shalt keep my covenant be
[1:12:08] therefore thou and thy seed after thee
[1:12:10] in their generations. This is my
[1:12:12] covenant which you shall keep between me
[1:12:15] and you and thy seed after thee. every
[1:12:17] every manchild among you shall be
[1:12:19] circumcised and you shall circum the
[1:12:21] flesh circumcise the flesh of the
[1:12:22] foreskin and it shall be a token of the
[1:12:25] covenant between me and you
[1:12:30] and brother Bram says this covenant that
[1:12:32] he made with Abraham included you right
[1:12:37] Jehovah Gyra 62
[1:12:39] now there's been two covenants
[1:12:42] one of them was the Adam covenant God
[1:12:44] made a covenant with the mans if you
[1:12:46] will I will if you'll do this if you if
[1:12:49] you not eat of that tree then I'll do
[1:12:51] this but if you eat of that tree I'm
[1:12:53] going to do this right that's a
[1:12:55] conditional covenant if you do I will
[1:13:02] he broke it and then God made a covenant
[1:13:04] with Noah that was the Noah covenant and
[1:13:06] it was broke he made the Abrahamic
[1:13:08] covenant and the Abrahamic covenant
[1:13:10] according to Genesis 12th chapter was
[1:13:12] given unconditionally therefore it's
[1:13:15] eternal because it's uncondition
[1:13:16] conditional. Not if you will, I will. He
[1:13:18] said, I have. I've already done it.
[1:13:21] Thank you. He didn't He didn't wait to
[1:13:23] see what Abraham's reaction was going to
[1:13:25] be. He didn't wait to see, I tell you
[1:13:27] what, Abraham, this is going to be
[1:13:28] unconditional, but I need you to do this
[1:13:30] first. He gave you an unconditional
[1:13:33] covenant before you even knew there was
[1:13:34] a message. Amen. Before you ever knew
[1:13:37] there was this word for the last hour,
[1:13:39] he gave it to you in the mind of God.
[1:13:41] Brother Bam said, you received the Holy
[1:13:42] Ghost in the mind of God before the
[1:13:44] foundation of the world. Amen. Thank
[1:13:46] you, Lord. It was yours.
[1:13:49] So when you come into this this this
[1:13:51] earth and you come to the a message
[1:13:53] church or somebody witness to you for
[1:13:54] the first time.
[1:13:56] They was just telling you about the
[1:13:58] covenant God already had with you. Amen.
[1:14:02] This wasn't new to God. Oh, I've got a
[1:14:04] new one. Brother Rob, come out of the
[1:14:06] Catholic church. Oh, I've got me another
[1:14:07] one of the the beast people. God didn't
[1:14:10] say that. God had him before the
[1:14:11] foundation of the world. He already
[1:14:13] knew. He said, "I have everyone in my
[1:14:14] hand. I'll not lose a one. He was
[1:14:16] already in there. Brother Rah, sister
[1:14:17] sisters, Sarah was in the hands of God
[1:14:19] before the foundation of the world.
[1:14:23] And that unconditional covenant followed
[1:14:26] him,
[1:14:27] followed them, kept them safe. Maybe
[1:14:30] they would have heard something that
[1:14:32] would have kept them from coming here.
[1:14:35] But that unconditional covenant followed
[1:14:37] them
[1:14:39] until they they realized there's
[1:14:41] unconditional covenant. There's a token.
[1:14:46] When that comes inside, you don't look
[1:14:47] back, brother Rob. You don't look back
[1:14:49] where you came from. You don't look back
[1:14:51] to Egypt. You don't look back to Goan.
[1:14:53] You look to the promised land. Amen.
[1:14:55] Amen. Now, he's making the Abrahamic
[1:14:59] covenant. The Abrahamic covenant
[1:15:00] according to Genesis 12 chapter was
[1:15:02] given unconditionally. Therefore, it's
[1:15:04] eternal because it's unconditional. If
[1:15:05] you will, I will. I have. I've already
[1:15:08] done it. Not I will do it. I have done
[1:15:10] it. That's the basis of faith. God is
[1:15:13] determined to save a man. He make He
[1:15:17] makes a covenant. If you will, I will.
[1:15:19] He'd break it. Another one. You will, I
[1:15:21] will. He broke it. Man can't keep his
[1:15:23] covenant. So God saves man by his grace
[1:15:27] under a covenant that's unconditional.
[1:15:29] Oh my. Never ending. That's all of it.
[1:15:32] Three perfect. Noah, uh, Adam, Noah, and
[1:15:35] Abraham. That's the reason we are
[1:15:36] Abraham's children. This covenant cannot
[1:15:38] end because it's unconditional. It isn't
[1:15:41] because you do something. It's because
[1:15:43] God did something.
[1:15:46] Not because you chose God, but God chose
[1:15:48] you.
[1:15:51] I'm going to skip here a little bit. I
[1:15:53] want to look at Rahab
[1:15:55] for a little bit.
[1:15:57] We're all familiar with Rahab.
[1:16:05] Look, when you look at Rahab, you you of
[1:16:07] course we understand the story, the
[1:16:08] spies, the messengers that came to Rahab
[1:16:10] and how Rahab accepted them.
[1:16:14] She needed a token. Yeah. She needed a
[1:16:16] token to save her life and the life of
[1:16:18] her family.
[1:16:20] They didn't bring a token with them and
[1:16:22] give it to her.
[1:16:25] They didn't say, "We're bringing this to
[1:16:27] you.
[1:16:28] You hang this out your window."
[1:16:31] They didn't tell her that.
[1:16:33] She had to use what was she already had.
[1:16:36] She had to use what she already had. If
[1:16:39] you're a son, a seed, son and daughter
[1:16:40] of God, you've already got it. You might
[1:16:42] just not know it yet. Amen.
[1:16:46] But God's going to say, "You've already
[1:16:48] got it. That's what you use. You need
[1:16:49] faith, you already got it. You need
[1:16:51] healing, you've already got it, right?
[1:16:53] They didn't give her something new. They
[1:16:55] just and and when they came to her,
[1:16:58] she began to preach to them.
[1:17:02] We know who you you are. She was one of
[1:17:04] the first in the Bible, a gentile
[1:17:08] to use the name Yahweh
[1:17:12] Lord in capital letters.
[1:17:15] We know that your God is Lord
[1:17:19] and we we fear because of him. Now give
[1:17:21] me something to save me and my family.
[1:17:26] And what did they give her?
[1:17:28] Nothing.
[1:17:32] And before they were Joshua 2. And
[1:17:34] before they were laid down, she came up
[1:17:36] upon them on the roof. This is when she
[1:17:38] hides them on the roof. She already
[1:17:39] tells the man of the city that they've
[1:17:40] gone. She lied to them. They're gone.
[1:17:42] She said unto the man, "I know that the
[1:17:44] Lord hath given you the land, and that
[1:17:47] your terror is fallen upon us, and all
[1:17:49] and that all the inhabitants of the land
[1:17:51] faint because of you. For we have heard
[1:17:53] how the Lord dried up the water of the
[1:17:55] Red Sea for you. You come out of the
[1:17:57] Egypt, what he did unto the two kings of
[1:17:59] the Amorites that that on the other side
[1:18:01] of Jordan. God will always have a
[1:18:03] testimony. Amen. This is a God's
[1:18:06] testimony. Amen. And if you have the
[1:18:09] life of God in you, you'll have the same
[1:18:11] testimony.
[1:18:13] Amen. You can't have God in here and not
[1:18:15] have a testimony of battles that you've
[1:18:17] won, things you've overcome, and it
[1:18:19] might have it might have taken years for
[1:18:21] you to win it. It might, but it's still
[1:18:24] God. Amen.
[1:18:27] Now, therefore, I pray
[1:18:30] I pray you swear unto me by the Lord
[1:18:33] since I have shown you kindness that you
[1:18:35] will also show kindness to my father's
[1:18:37] house and give me a true token. She
[1:18:39] said, "Give me one. You give me one. I
[1:18:42] can't give you one. You can't give
[1:18:43] anybody one. Brother Brandham couldn't
[1:18:44] give anybody one. But she didn't
[1:18:46] understand yet. Give me a token.
[1:18:50] Yeah. Wow. And thou will save alive my
[1:18:55] father, my brother, my mother, my
[1:18:56] brethren, my sisters, and all that they
[1:18:58] have. Deliver us from death.
[1:19:01] God's token with Israel carried a
[1:19:04] testimony. And Rahab believed it.
[1:19:07] She didn't she didn't see any of these
[1:19:09] battles. She didn't see anything that
[1:19:11] happened. She heard the message for the
[1:19:13] first time and said, "I believe that. I
[1:19:16] believe that's from God."
[1:19:19] Now give me something to anchor it in
[1:19:21] here.
[1:19:23] I need to anchor it in here. Give me
[1:19:25] something.
[1:19:31] But what they gave her was the same
[1:19:34] thing that saved them. Yeah.
[1:19:38] The scarlet rope, right?
[1:19:40] that saved the spies.
[1:19:43] The scarlet thread. Brother Bram said
[1:19:45] there's a tie of the blood. That's how
[1:19:47] they escaped. The scarlet thread, the
[1:19:49] scarlet rope. And they said, "Take this
[1:19:51] same rope and save yourself."
[1:19:55] The same blood Yeah. that saved us will
[1:19:58] save you. She already had it.
[1:20:03] Brother Bram says this harlot gentile
[1:20:05] watch all all her family. She was a
[1:20:08] believer. All her family had to get
[1:20:10] under the scarlet streak, that token.
[1:20:12] They had to go under and they'd perish.
[1:20:15] I had heard of the wrath of They had
[1:20:16] heard of the wrath of God. They had
[1:20:18] heard of the displaying of signs and
[1:20:19] miracles of God among his people. They
[1:20:21] had to receive it. She had to receive
[1:20:24] it. God's destroying angel was coming.
[1:20:26] They knew it. And Joshua was that angel.
[1:20:31] So, as as she has received his token and
[1:20:34] she puts it on display, she does exactly
[1:20:37] what she's told.
[1:20:39] She puts the scarlet thread on display
[1:20:42] out her window
[1:20:44] because death angel's coming.
[1:20:48] The death angel is coming. And as they
[1:20:50] begin to march,
[1:20:52] they begin to march around her city.
[1:20:56] You understand? There's a gentile, there
[1:20:57] was a gentile bride in there, a gentile
[1:21:00] bride in Jericho. And they begin to
[1:21:03] march around. First church age, they
[1:21:06] march around. second church age, they
[1:21:09] marched around the whole time. There's a
[1:21:10] captain in that army. He's looking for
[1:21:12] that scarlet thread. Amen. Every age,
[1:21:16] Christ was looking for that token. Yeah.
[1:21:19] Every single age. Why? There was a
[1:21:20] gentile bride in there. It might have
[1:21:23] been one people. Well, it might have
[1:21:24] been one person. But here, here, this
[1:21:26] army of the Lord is marching around.
[1:21:29] First church age, second church age,
[1:21:30] third church age. And they're coming to
[1:21:32] the seventh church age. The walls are
[1:21:34] coming down in the seventh church age.
[1:21:37] the walls. There's a bride that's going
[1:21:39] to be called out in the seventh church
[1:21:41] age. Why? Because she displayed the
[1:21:44] token. She put the token on display. She
[1:21:47] followed orders.
[1:21:49] Amen. And there was a captain in that
[1:21:51] army, which we know the story of Salmon.
[1:21:54] You know, historians and theologians say
[1:21:55] that he was one of the spies. We don't
[1:21:57] know. That's not in the Bible.
[1:21:59] But we know he was a captain in this
[1:22:01] army.
[1:22:04] and he went
[1:22:06] straight to where the token was at.
[1:22:09] Yeah. That's how she he knew where she
[1:22:12] was at was a token.
[1:22:16] You got to understand something with
[1:22:18] this covenant. Brother Brandham said
[1:22:23] there is no token when the covenants
[1:22:25] anoldled.
[1:22:28] If you don't have the token, God don't
[1:22:29] have to hold that covenant. Right? Amen.
[1:22:32] If you do, God says this, do what I ask.
[1:22:36] It's unconditional.
[1:22:38] But if you don't, if you don't do God's
[1:22:40] word,
[1:22:42] the covenant's null and void. Oh my.
[1:22:47] We'll wind down here, but look at the
[1:22:50] covenant that you've been given.
[1:22:53] Includes healing, deliverance, grace.
[1:22:56] There's so much that comes with the
[1:22:57] token. Everything that comes with the
[1:22:59] token. You know, we we it's as she come
[1:23:02] out when when she come out of of that
[1:23:05] that city out of the rubble. Here comes
[1:23:07] Rahab that maybe that the captain finds
[1:23:09] out where she was at, sees the token,
[1:23:11] goes to that household and pulls her out
[1:23:13] of there,
[1:23:15] right? Took her to the promised land.
[1:23:17] Yeah.
[1:23:20] And they founded the house of God's
[1:23:21] bread.
[1:23:23] Salmon was the one that built Bethlehem
[1:23:26] and she's the bride in Bethlehem.
[1:23:28] But when you look at this, whenever she
[1:23:30] steps out and goes into the promised
[1:23:32] land, she don't need that scarlet rope
[1:23:34] no more.
[1:23:36] She don't need it no more. She don't
[1:23:38] need grace and mercy from the from the
[1:23:41] Israelite army no more. She don't need
[1:23:44] that from Joshua. Why? Because she she
[1:23:46] married into it. She's into the promised
[1:23:49] land. you step in that on the other
[1:23:50] side, you you cross the river, whether
[1:23:52] it be by the the way of the grave as you
[1:23:54] sleep or if you're raptured up, when you
[1:23:57] cross over, you won't need grace no
[1:23:59] more. You won't need mercy no more. You
[1:24:02] can lay it down on the other side of the
[1:24:04] river.
[1:24:06] God's not going to say, "You don't got
[1:24:08] mercy. You don't got grace. You don't
[1:24:09] come in." God said, "I already gave it
[1:24:10] to you. You can lay it down over here.
[1:24:13] You can lay your token down over here
[1:24:15] because now you have me. Oh, you have
[1:24:18] me. Amen. Right.
[1:24:25] Your token has a testimony.
[1:24:28] We look at the scriptures and the
[1:24:29] scripture tells us we are written
[1:24:30] epistles read of all men. So when people
[1:24:33] in our workplace, in our schools, and
[1:24:35] we're out shopping or whatever, people
[1:24:37] look at our lives, what are they
[1:24:38] reading? When when they look at the way
[1:24:40] you dress, what are they reading? When
[1:24:43] they look at the the the hear the music
[1:24:45] that you listen to, what are they
[1:24:46] reading?
[1:24:48] When they look at what you're looking at
[1:24:49] you on your phone, what are they
[1:24:51] reading?
[1:24:53] You're written epistle. You are the
[1:24:55] Bible to some people.
[1:24:58] You are the B the only Bible some people
[1:25:00] will read.
[1:25:04] I wonder if we if we understand
[1:25:08] I wonder if we we fully understand
[1:25:13] how we're supposed to be with this
[1:25:14] token.
[1:25:16] The impact this token has on the lives
[1:25:19] of others.
[1:25:24] It's the Holy Spirit, right?
[1:25:26] What what what does the Holy Ghost do?
[1:25:29] It it came to save,
[1:25:32] come to heal,
[1:25:34] come to give new life, come to raise the
[1:25:36] dead spiritually. It came to raise the
[1:25:38] dead physically.
[1:25:40] This is the Holy Ghost. And it come to
[1:25:42] lead you into all truth. That's what the
[1:25:44] Bible says. It'll lead you into all
[1:25:46] truth. So people are watching you. Few
[1:25:50] days ago, Brother Donnie had sent us a
[1:25:52] the the ministers a a video an audio
[1:25:55] clip
[1:25:57] somebody had put on Facebook on on uh
[1:26:00] YouTube.
[1:26:01] Brother Brandon and Brother Brandon
[1:26:03] preach if if anybody ever gets a chance,
[1:26:06] go listen to Mother's Day in 59. Just
[1:26:08] listen to it. I just throw that out
[1:26:10] there.
[1:26:13] Brother Brandon was talking about the
[1:26:16] effect that we have on people here when
[1:26:20] we get over there.
[1:26:23] I'm anticipating that great crowning
[1:26:25] hour.
[1:26:27] As the light begins to spread, we will
[1:26:30] know
[1:26:31] as we are known. We'll understand. We'll
[1:26:33] remember our acquaintance and the ones
[1:26:35] that's been there. There'll be many
[1:26:37] there we didn't even think would be
[1:26:40] there. For you know it's at that time I
[1:26:43] believe that he's talking about we cast
[1:26:44] our bread upon the water as human
[1:26:46] beings. You cast your
[1:26:49] you're fishing, you're sewing, you're
[1:26:50] trying to get trying to be a witness,
[1:26:53] brother Jackie, you're trying to bring
[1:26:55] people with you. And when you get there
[1:26:57] on the other side,
[1:27:02] you'll be able to see those that maybe
[1:27:04] you thought didn't make it,
[1:27:07] but they saw your life.
[1:27:11] Your token was a testimony to them and
[1:27:14] they saw your life and maybe they made
[1:27:17] one comment.
[1:27:19] I want to be like them.
[1:27:22] I want to live the way they live. Let me
[1:27:25] I'm going tell you this and
[1:27:29] brother Ryan Kennedy was telling me one
[1:27:31] day that a nurse that he knows came in
[1:27:33] here and sat down in church.
[1:27:37] Said just come down. He knew her. He saw
[1:27:39] her later.
[1:27:41] My wife's going to kill me for this. He
[1:27:44] saw her later.
[1:27:46] He said, "I saw you at the church. What
[1:27:47] were you doing there?"
[1:27:51] He said, she said, "I I knew that's
[1:27:53] where Jennifer Hera wanted go went to
[1:27:55] church." Yeah. Wife don't wife don't
[1:27:59] even know her.
[1:28:03] People are watching you.
[1:28:06] Yes, sir. people,
[1:28:08] they know where you go. They know what
[1:28:11] you believe.
[1:28:14] They know that, you know, they might
[1:28:16] call you a cult, but others are very
[1:28:19] complimentary.
[1:28:21] And for one word of kindness,
[1:28:25] you walk into that city,
[1:28:28] there they are.
[1:28:32] Can you look at your life this morning
[1:28:37] and say that you are where you need to
[1:28:39] be? That if somebody looked at your life
[1:28:41] today, this very minute,
[1:28:44] if they looked at your life,
[1:28:47] would it get them in?
[1:28:52] Are you living a life
[1:28:55] that would pull them in to eternity?
[1:29:00] cuz that's what you're doing.
[1:29:05] Your token is pulling people into
[1:29:08] eternity that you didn't know.
[1:29:11] If you get up in the morning and think
[1:29:13] of that
[1:29:16] today, I can make an impact.
[1:29:19] You may never meet him,
[1:29:22] may never see him,
[1:29:25] but you live a life
[1:29:28] that pulls people into eternity.
[1:29:32] Because the token in your life was sent
[1:29:34] here to save. And it's not going to stop
[1:29:37] because it's in you.
[1:29:41] It'll still save through you. Praise the
[1:29:44] Lord.
[1:29:47] For you know that time I believe that
[1:29:49] bread that we have cast upon the human
[1:29:51] troubled waters returned to us that day.
[1:29:55] When we see the effects of our testimony
[1:29:59] on people that we didn't understand
[1:30:00] their actions towards it. Somebody made
[1:30:03] a comment and you didn't you didn't know
[1:30:05] if it was good or bad.
[1:30:09] You know, I I I lived
[1:30:12] rented for years from this lady
[1:30:15] that for I don't know, nine years.
[1:30:20] I don't know that I've ever had a human
[1:30:22] being message or not in message that was
[1:30:24] as good to us as that woman was.
[1:30:28] I longed to see her again. She never
[1:30:30] said one word about where I went to
[1:30:32] church, what I believed.
[1:30:36] She would bend over backwards to make
[1:30:38] sure we were blessed.
[1:30:41] I'm going to see her again. 100%. I got
[1:30:44] no doubt.
[1:30:47] And the impact that your life will have,
[1:30:51] just understand this. What side of that
[1:30:53] judgment bar do you want to be standing
[1:30:55] on? When people look at you and say,
[1:31:00] "They lived a life in front of me.
[1:31:04] I was having a bad day one day. I was
[1:31:06] thinking about suicide and they they
[1:31:08] walked by me and they said a kind word.
[1:31:11] I was as low as I ever was.
[1:31:16] Never been lower in my life and they
[1:31:18] come by and said a kind word to me
[1:31:21] and that changed my life.
[1:31:24] Or
[1:31:26] are you going to be the one that said,
[1:31:27] "I didn't know you went to church there.
[1:31:31] I I'd never seen you raise your hands.
[1:31:34] I I'd never seen you worship God.
[1:31:38] Is Is what side you going to be on?
[1:31:44] Because I promise you, there's going to
[1:31:45] be one side or the other. That's right.
[1:31:48] You're going to either be the one that
[1:31:50] pulled them in or you're going to be the
[1:31:51] one that blocked them. Oh my. Amen.
[1:31:56] You are not to be a stumbling block to
[1:31:58] anybody else.
[1:31:59] Amen.
[1:32:01] Let's stand together.
[1:32:06] Brother Brandham says, "And also the
[1:32:09] seeds that we sowed,
[1:32:12] not even thinking what they would do,
[1:32:16] but there they are.
[1:32:18] The seeds you sowed
[1:32:20] brought people into eternity."
[1:32:24] That's something to think about.
[1:32:27] the actions that we do in front of
[1:32:28] others.
[1:32:30] That's something to think about that
[1:32:32] your very actions
[1:32:34] is sewing seeds.
[1:32:36] And then it could pull people in.
[1:32:39] They brought forth precious fruits and
[1:32:41] we'll see them on that day. The wayward
[1:32:43] loved ones and relatives.
[1:32:48] Let me tell you something. People, don't
[1:32:49] you worry
[1:32:51] about your loved ones.
[1:32:55] Mamas, don't worry about your kid.
[1:32:58] I'm going to read you something here in
[1:32:59] a minute that if you're a mom and you
[1:33:02] have a backslid son or daughter, if this
[1:33:05] don't make you rejoice,
[1:33:08] I don't know what will.
[1:33:11] In the same message, Mother's Day, like
[1:33:12] I say, if you can, please go listen to
[1:33:15] it.
[1:33:18] Brother Brandon was talking about the
[1:33:19] things in our minds that, you know, we
[1:33:20] never we didn't understand these these
[1:33:22] things, the questions that been in our
[1:33:24] minds. How can how can he do it?
[1:33:26] Somehow mysteriously they'll fade away.
[1:33:28] The knots that have been tied in the
[1:33:30] back of our minds, will it be this? How
[1:33:32] could it be this? Somehow majestic
[1:33:34] fingers will just untangle and unravel
[1:33:36] those knots
[1:33:38] and it'll fade away into one big crown
[1:33:39] of love.
[1:33:46] And then we shall see him. Then we shall
[1:33:49] be like him. Then we should worship him.
[1:33:52] We will see mother
[1:33:55] as God wants her.
[1:33:59] Mother will not be complete there
[1:34:01] without her family. And God knows that.
[1:34:08] Don't worry about your family. Oh yeah.
[1:34:11] We look at them now. We see the
[1:34:12] situation. They're backslid. They're in
[1:34:14] this. They're in that. And human nature
[1:34:16] reminds you have a promise. Amen. Keep
[1:34:20] applying the token. Fifth gospel.
[1:34:23] You keep that token cuz it don't matter
[1:34:25] where he goes. The token that you've
[1:34:27] applied to is to follow him will follow
[1:34:29] him. The fifth gospel you've preached to
[1:34:31] him for years will follow him. Will
[1:34:34] follow her. Thank you. You'll see them
[1:34:37] on that day. Praise the Lord. Cuz the
[1:34:39] greatest time of all of her life is to
[1:34:41] see the children around the table and
[1:34:43] all of them healthy and happy.
[1:34:46] To see her pour the coffee or whatever
[1:34:48] she does and fixes supper and her and
[1:34:49] dad sit down. That's the happiest time
[1:34:51] of God in in mama's life and see your
[1:34:53] kitties. Then God,
[1:34:57] that's how God wants her. Lord, that's
[1:35:00] how God wants to see her.
[1:35:02] Let's bow our heads.
[1:35:08] I pray that something was said that
[1:35:09] would quicken your hearts this morning.
[1:35:13] I know I I jumped back and forth and I
[1:35:15] missed a whole bunch of stuff, but
[1:35:17] that's just what I felt. the Lord had
[1:35:20] first this morning.
[1:35:23] Well, if you could say this morning,
[1:35:25] Brother Joe, I have the token,
[1:35:29] but I need to let it live in my life
[1:35:31] more. I I need it to to I want to be a
[1:35:35] written epistle that people look at me
[1:35:36] and they read the token in my life.
[1:35:39] That's my desire. I I that that's what I
[1:35:42] want. As as the days grow shorter and
[1:35:44] shorter, look at the world. If you if
[1:35:46] you don't understand the Bible, look at
[1:35:47] the world. It's falling apart. Things
[1:35:50] are coming together. Everybody's coming
[1:35:53] against Israel and it's going to come at
[1:35:54] one point. Then America's going to turn
[1:35:56] their back on her as well. But we look
[1:35:59] at the situation that the world is in
[1:36:01] the chaos and all that and God's given
[1:36:04] you peace with the token. We can look at
[1:36:06] it and not worry. We we can look at
[1:36:08] everything that's falling apart and say
[1:36:10] and say, "I have peace." Amen. Because
[1:36:13] in goan, God applied the blood. Amen.
[1:36:18] You have any other needs on your heart,
[1:36:20] you want to bring it before the Lord.
[1:36:22] Heavenly Father,
[1:36:24] Lord, we thank you so much for your word
[1:36:26] this morning, Lord.
[1:36:29] Lord, I I had no idea, Lord, how to
[1:36:31] start this or which direction to go,
[1:36:33] Lord. I thank you so much for your
[1:36:34] leadership,
[1:36:36] Lord. If there ain't but one soul that
[1:36:39] hears this, whether it be streaming or
[1:36:41] sitting here, Lord,

[1:36:47] token this morning and how important it
[1:36:49] is to have that applied to our lives so
[1:36:51] that others might see it. Lord, Lord, it
[1:36:55] behooves us to understand and know what
[1:36:57] our lives are speaking. Father, is it of
[1:36:58] you or is it of flesh?
[1:37:01] Lord, help us this morning, Father, that
[1:37:03] if there's anything in our life that's
[1:37:05] displeasing to you, Father, help us to
[1:37:07] get it out. Lord, just to know and
[1:37:09] understand that your covenant with us is
[1:37:11] unconditional. Despite all of our
[1:37:13] mistakes, despite all of our faults and
[1:37:16] our failures, Lord, and I know I've got
[1:37:17] many,
[1:37:19] but when you look at me, you look at
[1:37:20] that token life. You don't see my
[1:37:23] faults, my failures, Lord. And I'm so
[1:37:26] grateful for that. Meet every need here.
[1:37:29] Touch every heart. Father, I pray that
[1:37:31] you would, Lord. I thank you for, Lord,
[1:37:33] helping them sit and listen. Jesus, we
[1:37:35] thank you for it in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:37:39] Go sing something. Let's worship him
[1:37:41] this morning.

[1:39:48] your kingom
[1:39:51] come
[1:39:55] as we let your will
[1:39:59] be done.
[1:40:04] Lord, you're calling me
[1:40:08] to a higher place
[1:40:13] to walk with you each and every day.
[1:40:22] As I pray and read my Bible,
[1:40:26] you will keep me in revival
[1:40:31] and lead me into a body
[1:40:36] change.

[1:42:25] Though I could pride myself in battles
[1:42:30] won.
[1:42:31] [Music]
[1:42:33] I've been blessed beyond measure
[1:42:38] and by his strength alone I overcome.
[1:42:45] [Music]
[1:42:48] Oh,

[1:42:53] like diamonds in
[1:42:57] my hand.

[1:43:00] For those trophies
[1:43:02] could not equal to the grace
[1:43:08] by which I stand
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:12] in Christ alone.
[1:43:16] I place
[1:43:18] my trust
[1:43:21] and find my glory in the power of the
[1:43:27] cross.
[1:43:30] In every victory,
[1:43:34] let it be said
[1:43:37] of me.

[1:44:42] And only his tender mercy
[1:44:47] could reach beyond my weakness to my
[1:44:52] knee.
[1:44:58] I see no greater honor
[1:45:02] than just to know
[1:45:05] him more
[1:45:08] and to count my gains as losses
[1:45:13] to the glory.
[1:45:16] of my Lord
[1:45:20] in Christ alone.
[1:45:24] I place
[1:45:26] my trust

[1:46:02] and find my glory in the power of the
[1:46:08] cross.
