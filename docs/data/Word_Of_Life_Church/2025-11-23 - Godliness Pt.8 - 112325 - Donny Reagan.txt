What a privilege it is to be in the in the sanctuary of the Lord to we come to worship and to praise the name of the Lord and give him honor, respect him. This is a sacred place, right? And we want to treat it as such. If you're visiting with us today, we want to welcome you to our service. So glad to have each and every one of you. All of our streamers locally and around the world. We want to say God bless those folks as well. trust they'll receive from this service today. Let's give all those folks a good hand if you would this morning. [applause] Praise the Lord. We're going to look at our prayer request uh at this time. Sister Ruth Louise Jax is asking for prayer for the Nixon family that lives near her. She is also asking that the Lord gives her understanding and peace. So, let's remember that prayer request as we pray today. Sister Shirley Robbins is asking that we pray for brother Greg. He was in the hospital from Thursday through Saturday due to low sugar and a very low heart rate. He is at home now and waiting for more answers from the doctors. Well, let's just pray that the doctor Jesus will go by and pay him a visit. We know he's more than able, right? &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Sister April Weisner wants to uh remember her sister Brandy in prayer. She has an inflammation in her back. So, we want to pray for her today. As we pray all the unspoken prayer requests, I know there's many needs in our group, but we'll just commit all these things unto the Lord. Let me make a few announcements before we pray today. Brother John, if you get ready to lead us to the Lord, the library will be closed on Wednesday, November the 26th. So, remember that if you would like to fill a shoe box, you can still bring it back this evening or before 11:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. And there will be no service this coming Wednesday night. So remember that. Want to wish at this time. We'll take this opportunity to wish all of you a very very happy Thanksgiving as you uh travel and and and and host friends and family in your homes. We just pray that uh God will bless you with a real good time. Nothing like family. You know that. &gt;&gt; Well, some of you don't even appreciate your family. I said, "There's nothing like good family." Right? &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Look at your neighbor and ask him, "Are you awake? I'm awake." All right, everybody's awake. Let's Let's stand this morning if you would. We're going to pray. Commit all these things unto the Lord. Just so happy to have each and every one of you. We had a great time here Wednesday night, didn't we? How many of you appreciate the word of the Lord? Don't it get better all the time? Give the Lord one more good hand clap of praise this morning. [applause] We love this guy right here, though. He's just about half the man he used to be. Right. Amen. God bless you. We certainly do love you. We appreciate your prayers. Um I want to something just came to my heart, you know, was I was sitting there thinking about the troubles and trials that we go through and the things. And brother Bham got to talking about that lady who said that she never had anything negative to say and and she said the devil's a good adversary. &gt;&gt; But the thing about a good adversary is if you're smart that adversary will make you think about your tactics, right? &gt;&gt; So that's what our trials are for. Let's think about our tactics. Let's look at how we live. Amen. I'm sorry. That is &gt;&gt; that's what's on my heart. So let's go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, we certainly love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, they say that you don't know what you're missing till you don't have it anymore, Lord. Lord, it's been circumstances have kept me out of church for a while, Lord. And Lord, I miss it so bad. I'm so grateful I could be here today. And Lord, it's not that you don't meet me out there, Lord. It's not that we don't have fellowship out there, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, but Father, there's something about [laughter] being in your presence with saints of like precious faith. Lord, we're so thankful for our brothers and sisters. We're thankful, Lord, that we can come together. We're thankful, Lord Jesus, that you're so mindful of us. That Lord, no matter what we're going through, we know that on the other side, we're going to come out better Christians. Lord, we're so thankful, Father. And Lord Jesus, these prayer requests that I hold in my hand, Father, they represent a need. But Lord Jesus, inside of my heart, I represent the answer, Father. Each one of these people here, Lord, we're we're emissaries, Lord. We're we're people that represent you. And we come to you, Father, and we say by your stripes, they're healed. And and every need is met, Father, under that name, in the name of Jesus. We bring them before you, Lord. We love you. We thank you for it. We thank you, Lord, that we get to hear more about you. We thank you, Father, that we're going to grow closer to you. And I I pray, Father, that we would be able to put aside every weight, every measure, everything that's in our mind, Father, that would hinder us from getting closer to you. &gt;&gt; We love you. We thank you for it, Lord Jesus. Be with us now each and every part of the service. We ask it in your name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, John. God bless you. users, if you want to come at this time, we'll receive the morning tithe and offering you give us unto the Lord. Let's sing an old song that we sung for years, but I I still like it because I believe it's the truth. We're rising up. We're not drying up. We're rising up. Amen. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Give him one more good hand clap of praise this morning. [applause] Play a little bit.

He was supposed to sing, but they they may not be here, but Brother Harry, are they here? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. I They just blend in with everybody. I just &gt;&gt; I couldn't tell where they're at. Where are they? But right back here, they are. God bless them. Praise the Lord. Brother Joel, if you'll come on to the platform and be getting ready to sing, Sister Tamik, how you've got it uh arranged this morning. Who's on the Lord's side among you this morning? Who's on the Lord's side among you this morning? Give him one more good hand clap of praise. [applause] Amen. Who is on the Lord's side among you? [singing] Oh, now who will help us join in the fight? Who is on the Lord's side among [music and singing] you? Who is on the side of the right? Say it again. [music] Oh yes.

[music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; If you would have known me way back then and how I used to [singing] live, it would [music] be easy to see it was all about me. I had [music and singing] nothing to give. But I remember [music] the day [singing] I found grace and a hole in my heart was filled. Now [music] I'm a brand [singing] new man because of nail pierced hands hanging on Calary's hill. [music and singing] I'm just a sign of the cross. [music] Not perfect, just reading. You see, I once was lost, but God's [music] blood was shed for me. Nothing [music] I done, it's all [singing] God's son hanging on Calvary Street. Jesus paid my cost. [music] I'm just a sign of [singing] the cross. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It's easy to see [music] I'm a simple man that fits the glove [music] of a [singing] wondering soul that just didn't know about [music] God's love. But now I've seen the light [singing] because he's opened my eyes from the darkness. [music] I've been set free. Now for the rest of my days, I just [music] want to stay kneeling at [singing] my Savior's feet. I'm just a sign of the cross. [music] Not perfect, just redeemed. You see, I once was lost, [music] but God's blood was shed for me. Nothing I done, [singing] it's all God's son hanging on [music] Calvary Street. Jesus paid my cost. I'm [music] just a sign of the cross. Nothing [music] I done, it's all God's [singing] son hanging on Calvar's tree. Jesus [music] paid my cost. I'm just a sign of the cross. [singing] [music] Yeah, he paid my cost. I'm just a sign of the cross. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Great [singing] is thy faithfulness, oh Lord, [singing] my father. There is [singing] no shadow of turning with [singing] thee. [music] Thou changes not. Thy [singing] compassion [music] it fails not. As [singing] thou has been, thou [singing] forever will be. Great is thy [singing] faithfulness. Great [singing] is thy faithfulness. Morning [singing] by morning, new mercies I see. [singing] All I have needed, thy hands have proided. [singing and music] Great is thy faithfulness, [singing and music] Lord, unto me. [music] Summer [singing] and winter, springtime [singing] and harvest. Sun, [singing] moon, and stars in [music] their courses [singing] above. They join [singing] with all nature in manifold [singing] [music] witness to thy [singing] great faithfulness, mercy and love. Great is [singing] thy faithfulness. [music] Great is thy faithfulness. [singing] Morning by morning, new mercies [singing] I see. All I have needed, thy [singing] hand has proided. [music] Great is thy [singing] faithfulness, [music] Lord, [singing] unto me. [music] Pardon for sin [singing] and a peace that endureth. [singing] Thy own dear presence [singing] [music] to cheer and to guide. Strength [music and singing] for today and bright hope for tomorrow. [singing and music] Blessings all my with [singing and music] him thousand beside. Great [singing] is thy faithfulness. [music] Great is thy [music] faithfulness. Morning. [singing] [music] But morning, new mercies [singing] I see. All I have needed, your hand has provided. [singing] Great is thy faithfulness, [singing] [music] Lord, unto me. [music] Lord, [singing] all I have needed, your [singing] hand has provided. Great is thy [singing] faithfulness. Great is [singing] thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. [screaming] Lord on [singing] to me. [music] [applause and music] How many can say amen to that? Amen. &gt;&gt; I've not been so faithful to him at times. I probably could venture to say the same for everybody else here today. &gt;&gt; Times that we've questioned and wondered and tried to understand and think, Lord, your way is so obscure. the will of God is so obscure sometimes to try to find it. But aren't you glad he keeps us even through that obscurity? &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's happy to be in the house of the Lord today? &gt;&gt; I look so forward to church. &gt;&gt; I know it's the same. I realize it's the same as it's always been as far as days and hours and the days and all that, but from Wednesday to Sunday seems like it's so far to be able to come back to the house of God. I know I'm weird, you know, I admit it. When God saved me, he saved me to go to church. I love going to church. Some folks love to go to a ball game. I'm not saying that they're wrong for doing that, unless they love it more than they love going to church. Some people love doing this, doing that and the other. But to me, my greatest time of refreshment is not, as brother John said earlier, not just being in the presence of God, but being in the presence of the saints of God. So you think when we all get to heaven, there'll be no work as we know it in this life. There'll be no recreation as we know it in this life. What in the world are we going to do for eternity? There'll be no basketball. I'm sorry. No football, no volleyball, you know, none of that sort of thing. No, no golf, your brothers, hang up your clubs. Hang up your guns, hang up your bows, your fishing rods, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What are we going to do? What are we going to do to keep from being so bored? Because the age we're living in, people cannot stand it. Entertainment has become such an addiction &gt;&gt; in people's life. &gt;&gt; You watch it out on the restaurant, Carol, and I was out eating some lunch yesterday at this barbecue place down the road here and you sitting there were very few people in there, but you s look at them. Man was on his phone, woman's on her phone, or the man was looking out that window and she's looking out that window. You think people, many of them have lost the art of communication. &gt;&gt; That's right. to be able to talk. So, what do y'all do? Text your wife when you're sitting at the table? Text your husband? Text your children. Hey kids, straighten up. But you think of what really God wants us to be. He wants us to communicate with him and with each other. It's sad. A doctor told Caroline not long ago, he said, "I know for you all, he's not a religious man." He said, "I know for you all, but y'all talk." He said, "But you'd be surprised what I hear." in this office of people that no longer talk. They no longer communicate. They no longer have the ability. You imagine some of our school kids don't even know how to sign a check. &gt;&gt; Some don't know how to write a letter. &gt;&gt; And if they're mailing a bill, they don't know where the stamp goes. &gt;&gt; Don't laugh at me. I know what I'm talking about. I just heard this the other day. &gt;&gt; But yet, we're in the age of greater education. &gt;&gt; We can go to the moon and do good to get to the post office and back safely. &gt;&gt; My my long for the simple life, &gt;&gt; don't you? Who was that for? &gt;&gt; It was for you, Carol. Okay. Well, y'all blame Carol for that. She just said, she said pointed to her that it was for her. So, God bless you, sister. Amen. Let's turn together to second Peter chapter 1 verse verse two. I hope you don't mind me reading these same verses. I absolutely love them. They're just such awesome verses in God's word. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness. So he's given us all things that pertain unto life. Now remember this is essentials. This is not wants. all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us unto glory and virtue, whereby given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust, and beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue virtue knowledge and to knowledge. Notice now add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance. So you're building one top of the other top of the other. to temperance, patience, and to patience, godliness, and to godliness, brotherly kindness. And to brotherly kindness, charity. May God hasten the day that every believer around the world can look at that top and say, "I have arrived." &gt;&gt; We'll go home. and may like to be remembered today as we pray. You have a need or request on your heart. All right, let's just bow our heads together. Lord Jesus, what a great privilege it is for us, Father, once again to be gathered in your house. And we thank you, Lord God. It's not that this carpet is special, Lord. These walnut boards that I have my hands on that made this pulpit, this altar area. These particular seats could have wound up in a coliseum, an auditorium. The sheetrock could have wound up in a bar. The paint on the walls could have painted school rooms, offices. But yet, it's not the place where they came from that's made it special. It's your presence and the presence of your children. We consider this to be a sacred place. Father, we know that when we come here, we will meet with you and with each other. You saw the hands of your children that were uplifted. Father, you say I have this handkerchief in my hand today as a prayer cloth. Lord, Sister Ruth Garland's great great grandson. You see, Lord, this situation the little fella's in. his mama having to lay flat of her back in the hospital for nine weeks before he was born and just one complication after another. So we pray that you'd be merciful, dear God, in the name of Jesus. This is your enemy that has done this to this child. May the spirit of God move. Heavenly Father, we know that we have many folks among us that have needs, some of them very serious, and we're praying that you'd be mindful of each one of them. Today, we've come together that we might feast at your table, that we might hear more of your principles of what you expect of us as your children. Help us today, Father. Help me to get out of the way. Anoint me with your presence. I pray in the name of Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn around and shake hands with somebody before you're seated and tell them it's good to be in the house of the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. So, we've been looking at it for a couple of um couple of Sundays about godliness to be like God in the sense of what God loves and what God hates. I know that we don't hear much in the age especially that we're living in that God hates much of anything &gt;&gt; because people when they get done with God and they whitewash him and do all that they figure they need to do to uh complement his character, they make him to where that he loves everything and [snorts] detest nothing. There's no more sin in his eyes, no more abomination in his eyes, no more things that bothers him or troubles him. And people can do whatever they want, live any way they want, and he's going to wind up taking us all to heaven after all anyway. But that's not my God. &gt;&gt; I trust that's not your God. That's not the God of the Bible. And truly we are grateful that we know that the Bible tells us that God is love. The Bible does not say that God is hate. But it does say God is love. And we're grateful that he is love. But we also know to be God, there are certain things that God hates. There's things that he dislikes. And then there are things that he actually hates. to be godly. Then you and I want to love what he loves. We want to like what he likes. And we want to hate what he hates. Now, in that, it's a little bit hard because he hates with a godly hatred. And if we're not careful, we will hate with human hatred disguised under what we want people to believe is godly hatred. But godly hatred can only come from a pure regenerated heart that is housing the presence of divinity deity. Now if we try to hate and do it under the guise of it being God, well I hate this. I'll tell you one thing. I'm against this and that. And we know we've had people that's been that way, of course. And they want to hide it behind God. But you always notice the attributes of it, what comes out of it. And it's not too hard to tell that it's not godly. And yet down through the ages, God has hated various things. Now notice and listen to me carefully that God hates the sin that the sinner does. But God does not hate the sinner. God loves the United States of America, but he hates the United States of America's sins. &gt;&gt; God loves every person in this church. this morning. But God hates every sin that every one of us have in our life if we do. &gt;&gt; You see, God's able to separate between the two, knowing then that as long as the blood is still shed, and we know according to the vision that God allowed his prophet to see years and years ago at that little restaurant in Ohio, and he was condemning the woman and the man and all the different ones that was there. And the Lord called him aside and let him see the earth. and the earth was covered over with blood. And he saw his sins, not the sin of the woman, the police officer, the other people that were there, but he saw his sins as they were coming up and hitting the Lord Jesus in the face. And he'd say, "Father, forgive him. He don't know what he's doing." And brother Brandham then realized that he himself also was underneath that canopy of the blood. And had not the blood been there, he himself would have been without mercy. So that's the way that God is able to look at us. And as long as there's life, we know there is hope. But God is ultimately going to bring all of those who continue on in their sin and their unbelief to judgment, which is one place I never want to stand myself because I I've read a little bit about it. Maybe not much as some of you all have, but from what I've read, I do not desire ever to stand before the white throne judgment of God. So, if there's things that God hates, and I desire to be godly, then I want to hate those things. Notice I keep saying that things, not people. Things that people do, things that people get involved in, things that people become a part of. Now you you parents that have had children and whenever your children are young, you can kind of make them do what you want them to do. And as they get older, you try that same thing and well, you know how it is. They're going to do what they want to do. And and yet you you hear and you know they're getting involved in this and that and the other. It breaks your heart. You think, "How could you do that to us? We've taught you better than that." And what are you wanting? You're wanting them to love what you love and hate what you hate. And yet, some of your children have wound up doing some of the things that you hate. So, do you hate your child because they're doing something wrong? Do you still love your child even when they do things wrong? Well, of course you do. If you have real love, well, that's the same way that God is. And yet you detest some of the things that you hear they're doing or some of the things maybe that the youth of our church, you know, this one's doing this and this one's doing that and it breaks your heart and you absolutely hate that. Yet if you would see them, you would not look at them and say, "I hate you. I hate you because you're falling short of the glory of God and I hate you." Well, we know that'll ever help them nor help you. There's only one thing that will do that and that is love. And it takes the spirit of God to be able to help us. Read with me if you would in Revelation 2:6. Uh we read this last week. But this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicicoatans which I also hate. Now God is here complimenting this first church age because of something that they have. Now watch what God says about it. This thou hast. So God is going to compliment something that they have and what they have is hate. &gt;&gt; How unusual. Now we think love, joy, peace, mercy, longsuffering, gentleness, kindness and God compliments that and he wants us to have it. But here, God is actually complimenting his people for something else that they have. And it's a hatred for what he identified as the deeds of the nickelans. Now, if you read that right, you'll note that God did did not say, "You all hate the nickelans because I hate them." &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; God never said he hated them. God never complimented the Ephesian church for hating nickelans. &gt;&gt; God complimented them for hating their deeds. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice how that when God hates something in a church age, the elect must hate the same thing or they're not yet godly where they need to be. But this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicicoatans which I also hate. And word of life said &gt;&gt; now watch in the Ephesians church aids the prophet picks this up and he says but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicicoatans which I also hate. The true vine hated the formal deeds of the nickelans. Now remember what this was doing. They wanted to do away with a spiritfilled church. They wanted to do away with a Holy Ghost move. They wanted to do away with some people that scream and holler and shout and worship God. Is that right? That's what they wanted to do away with. Now God said, "I hate that." Why? Because God wanted his children screaming, hollering and shouting, worshiping God, praising God. He wanted them alive. Is that right? Now, the Ephesian Christians looked at that and they said, "We are not for going to church and setting their dead, lifeless, dry, no worship, no praise, nobody clapping their hands." I wonder how many of our message people hate that to this day. Or is it becoming an accepted norm that actually instead of hating the deeds of a nickelanism, we hate anything with emotion. We hate anybody that cries and anybody that says amen real loud or a preacher that gets real fiery and preaches. Well, we ought to be hating the other thing, not the real genuine thing. The true vine hated the formal deeds of the nickelotans. So did God. But now we find in the third church age, which is the Perameian church age, Revelation 2:15, so hast thou, now notice he uses some of the same words in addressing the Ephesian church age. And he compliments for what they had, which was hate for the wrong thing. error doctrines leading his church to formality. But now God says, "You no longer hate what I hate." But you've actually got some of them people among you. &gt;&gt; Before they had hatred for it, but now they've let down the bar. &gt;&gt; Now there's people among them &gt;&gt; that actually are holding the doctrine. Now watch what has happened. Satan has been able to inner work and come in and intertwine the real vine and try to get them to compromise &gt;&gt; now. Let's love them. Oh, let's love them. And you know, they don't see what we see, but but maybe we'll just we'll quit preaching on this and quit preaching on that and and and we won't let them, you know, we'll let them know that we love them. And we'll have the preachers to quit preaching on holiness. And and we'll have to quit preaching on on altar calls. And we'll just let them sit at their seat and accept Christ as their savior. And and we we'll quit crying and we'll we'll quit worshiping and still clamping our hands, we we'll just all stand there and smile and and instead of saying amen, we'll become the nodding church. So we'll just sit there and nod our head. And if we don't like what's said, we'll do this. And if we do, we'll nod. Aren't you glad? that Hadty Wright didn't nod. &gt;&gt; I guarantee you, Hadty Wright was glad she had the right thing to say back to God. Remember, God's prophet said, "God's waiting to hear what you've got to say." &gt;&gt; God don't want your thumbs up. God don't want your nod. God wants your voice. &gt;&gt; He wants to hear you say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Now watch. Now, something had happened then. So, Satan has already started moving. Now, and he said, "So thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicicoatans, which thing I hate. God is not complimentary at all." Even though there were electaban church age, they had started getting cold. They started getting different. And now they were no longer rebuking that and making them feel uncomfortable. But they could actually come to church now and hold these doctrines and sit there comfortably because the preachers in the pull pit had apparently come to a compromising state. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God hated both their deeds and their doctrine. Now watch this. And his wonders to perform the prophet said God hates sin but he loves the sinner. He loves you so much that he gave his only begotten son that he might drink the bitter cup for you. Remember, he became you that you might become him. I want you to listen to these words, friends. He become a sinner, separated from the father when he screamed, "My God, why hast thou forsaken me?" He was separated from God in his death that you in your death might have God's presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He become a child of sin. He become a child of sin. Your sins, not his own, yours. That you might become a child of obedience. Oh, I love those words. A child of obedience, not a child of threats, not a child of fear, not a child of something that's held over you all the time, but a child that wants to obey God's word. Don't Ain't that what you want in your heart? That you want to be a child of obedience? Well, we we do this and we do that and we can't do this and we can't do that. But we don't do it on the basis of it being a law. We don't do it on the basis of it being legalism. We do it because we want to obey his word. Our obedience not only brings great pleasure to our heavenly father, but our obedience brings great pleasure to us. You see, that's the mystery that the worldly church will never comprehend because they look at the bride the way she's formed and shaped by God's immutable counsel. And they look and think them people must be miserable. We are not miserable. We are some of the happiest people you'll ever meet in your life. Why? They can't go here. They can't drink. They can't smoke. They can't take dope. They can't do this that and the other. Oh, no. We could do all of that, but we simply don't want to. First, we don't want the cancer that comes with it. We We don't want our minds all muddled up by all those things of the world. But first and foremost, we want to keep his word because we love to please our father because we are children of obedience. He took your place as a time creature. Listen, he took your place as a time creature that you might take his place as an eternal son and daughter of God. That ought to make somebody feel like worshiping the Lord. He took your place as a time creature. Amen. That you might take his place as an eternal son and daughter of God. That's how God loved the sinner but hated the sin. So he come on the basis that the sinner might be changed. Will they all? They will not. This is why the judgment will be so horrible for every sinner. Even though they're not bride, EVEN THOUGH MILLIONS ARE NOT BRIDE, God offers them the opportunity to be saved. And they even turn that down. You can see why the judgment will be so horrific for that type of people. God be on the lamb's book of life over into the book of life, spilled his mercy and his grace and said, "Whosoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely." If God would have went by the lamb's book of life, he would have called his elected name only, and that would have been the only one saved. But God said, "I feel so sorry for all the rest of humanity. I'll make a way for them to be saved, too, if they want it. Because it's not his will that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance." Will they? Of course they won't. And then he'll judge them for not doing it. But for you and I, by the grace of God, aren't you glad we've accepted it? Now, let's look at something else that God hates. And I want you to think of this. that if our father hates these attributes and we love them and find ourselves partaking of them, we need to re re-evaluate the stature of godliness in our life. God hates discord. Watch this. Amongst a lot of people we find where emotions and so forth, there becomes tattlings and backbitings and all kinds of ungodly things. Brother, that's a sulfuric acid in the church. It's demon power. &gt;&gt; I want you to listen now. Men, women, boys, girls, deacons, trustees, preachers, all of us together. Now, amongst a lot of people, we find where emotions and so forth, there becomes tattlings, backbitings, and all kinds of ungodly things. You mean backbiting is ungodly? &gt;&gt; Tattling is ungodly. And the church said, titlings and backbitings and all kind of ungodly things. Brother, that sulfuric acid in the church, it's demon power. Oh my goodness. You mean demons get on people and go to causing them to tattlele and backbite and sew discord. Yes, that is not the spirit of God. It is demons. &gt;&gt; Now, it's tough when it's on the leoty. But I'll tell you what's even worse. It's when it's on the preacher. And if it's on the pastor of the church, oh my goodness. And the pastor stirs up more trouble than anybody in the church, that is a bad deal. Because preachers can't hardly be corrected knowhow. They won't take nothing from nobody. Hardly any of them will anyway. So you imagine if the if this kind of a demon can get on a pastor, he keeps his church in total uproar. He keeps that church tore all two pieces and it ain't wrapped up in nothing but him and his flaws and his shortcomings. Oh my preach, brother Donnie. And what is it? Demon power. I don't care how much he's preached. I preached for 40 years. I don't care if you preached for 440 years. Men of God are not to be under the influence of demons. &gt;&gt; Children of God are not to be under the influence of demons. Notice this. HE SAID, "GOD HATES DISCORD among the brethren. Be reverent. BE HOLY. LOVE GOD. Stand by him. And as long as you know your life is divying with the Bible, with purity of heart, purity of thought, love towards my, your brother, trying your best to upill the kingdom of God and doing those things, dressing right, living right, talking right." Look friends, as we go ON IN TIME, I realize why some of the folks have left the message and they want to say, "Well, Brother Brandon was a liar. He was an exaggerator. He's this, that, and the other." But the bottom line, I found out, is a lot of this stuff right here, they cannot live this word. They cannot live it. So, what did they do? They find them a church. It's exactly the appetite of what they want so they can live, you know, the way the church preaches and the way the preachers does. So, you got preachers in the pull pit with smoking problems, lust problems. They got problems in their marriage. They've been married two and three and four times. Preach, brother Donnie. And what do people look? They want a man like that. They don't want a man of God that lives above them. They want a man of God that lives where they are. Well, come on, somebody talk to me. They don't want a man of God that's full of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And when he looks at him sometime, it looks like blazes of fire coming out of his eyes. They'd rather have a man that's get up and say, "Well, y'all pray for me. I'm lusting after women. Y'all pray for me. them having a problem, you know, getting away from drinking. As somebody told one of the brothers at our church not long ago, sitting in one of the local big churches here in Johnson City, they finally had to get rid of their pastor because he was showing up at all the weddings and all the receptions and all the different things. They was having drinking and he got drunk at one of them and they finally decided they going to have to let him go. Well, I don't mind telling you. I hope that I get drunk right here today. But it ain't going to be on old Crow or or Jim this that and the other on the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And I hope I ain't the only one. I hope there's some of our young people get so drunk on the Holy Ghost and some of you mamas and daddies and the prophet said you get so drunk that you don't know what your name is. Oh hallelujah. And we can LEAVE THIS PLACE SET ON FIRE OF THE BAPTISM OF THE Holy Ghost, hating discord, HATING SIN, HATING THE ABOMINATION OF the world, but loving Jesus, LOVING OUR BROTHER, LOVING WORSHIP, LOVING CHURCH, LOVING GODLINESS, loving heaven. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Notice this. HE SAYS, "UP BUILD THE KINGDOM OF GOD, doing those things, dressing right, living right, talking right, going to the right places, then you can have all the emotions you want to, and everybody will believe it." But you know what? If you've got a bunch of emotions and they know you live a different life, who wants to see anybody like that shout? I don't. Come on, somebody. I don't want to see somebody that's all full of emotion and they ain't got enough of the spirit of God to live right and overcome the devil. Oh my. Every day they're addicted to porn on their phone and they want to scream and run and shout. I ain't got no confidence IN THAT. I WISH SOMEBODY would preach WITH ME THIS MORNING. OH MY. GIVE US PEOPLE YOUR WORD OF LIFE THAT LIVE RIGHT, talk right, walk right, ABSOLUTELY WHOLE BEFORE GOD. THEN BROTHER, YOU WANT TO SHOUT, COME ON, I'LL SHOUT WITH YOU. YOU SISTERS WANT TO JUMP HIGH, COME ON, I'LL JUMP WITH YOU. THEN WE'VE GOT SOMETHING TO JUMP ABOUT BECAUSE GOD'S LIVING INSIDE OF US A VICTORIOUS LIFE. WE ARE LIVING NOT IN PARADISE BUT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of hell. EVERYWHERE WE LOOK, WE'VE GOT SIN, UNBELIEF, UNGODLINESS. BUT IN SPITE OF ALL OF THAT, I'M LIKE AN ASTRONAUT. WHEN THE ASTRONAUT GOES UP IN SPACE, THERE AIN'T NO OXYGEN UP THERE. THERE AIN'T NO FOOD UP THERE. THERE AIN'T NO WATER UP THERE. BUT WHAT DOES HE DO? HE PACKS HIS OWN WITH HIM. SO, HE'S GOT A SPECIAL SUIT ON. I'VE GONE ON A SPECIAL SUIT THIS MORNING. IT'S A HELMET. HALLELUJAH. I'VE gone on a SHIELD AND A BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. MY FEET ARE SHAW WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE. I GOT JOY. I GOT PEACE. I GOT HAPPINESS. I GOT SATISFACTION. AMEN. I AIN'T LOOKING FOR ANOTHER MESSAGE. I AIN'T LOOKING FOR ANOTHER MESSIAH. I'M LOOKING TO GET OUT OF THIS WORLD. I SAID, "I'M LOOKING TO GET OUT OF THIS WORLD. AND I WANT TO TAKE AS MANY AS YOU THAT WANTS TO GO WITH ME. I DON'T WANT TO GO FOR MYSELF. I DON'T WANT IT TO BE JUST ME AND MY FOR NO MORE. I WANT TO REACH EVERY SINNER I CAN. EVERY DEAD COLD CHURCH MEMBER, EVERY MEMBER THAT NEEDS TO BE ON FIRE OF THE HOLY GHOST. I WANT TO REACH YOU AND SAY, "COME ON, CHILDREN. LET'S GO. Listen [applause] the way God feels about our nation today. God hates sin and loves the sinner. He hates the sin. He loves America, but he hates her sin. That's right. &gt;&gt; He loves his church, but he hates the sin in the church. &gt;&gt; God loves his church, &gt;&gt; but he hates the sin in the church. And it hasn't changed. Spirits don't die. Same spirits that was in them people was talking about the ages before. And those people today, the devil takes his man but never his spirit. God takes his man but never his spirit. NOTICE HE SAYS ONE THING GOD hates is sowing discord among brethren. I ain't just talking about a church now. I'm talking about in your family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And them organizations is what does it sows discord among brethren. We should be standing in the breach and saying we are brothers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We are not divided. &gt;&gt; Now in this day, of course, there were no message churches hardly. So, Brother Brand was preaching the divisions that the denominations have made. Let's apply it the same way inside the ranks of the message. &gt;&gt; Here's this certain doctrine over here and this certain bunch of people. They got their own man-made title. And if you ain't with them, you ain't the bride. &gt;&gt; Come on, children. &gt;&gt; So, we got this and they're leaning this way. This group's leaning that way. That group's leaning that way. And the farther we go, we just keep narrowing it down, narrowing it down, narrowing it down. Well, is there anybody right besides us there? Our attitude ain't right about that. &gt;&gt; Well, come on, somebody. Let's say amen. I agree. It makes it difficult to know where to stand on certain things and not feel like a compromiser. But I want you to listen. The way God's prophet dealt with this in the days of denominations, them organizations is what does this shows discord among the brethren. We should be standing in the breach saying, "We are brothers. We are not divided. All one body, one in hope and doctrine. The doctrine of the Bible, one in charity. I like that song. Onward, Christian soldiers. Yes, sir. Now, I want you to notice there's some unusual things that maybe to our thinking that he would mention that God hates. Anything that I despise, he says, is a hypocrite. And God hates the same thing. Wow. So, God hates a hypocrite. It would be better. Listen to this. What an outstanding statement. It'd be better for an infidel. A better chance of getting to heaven than a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; Now you know that's the truth. AN INFIDEL SINCERE heart and couldn't see it. SO IF AN INFIDEL WAS JUST TOTALLY BLIND, COULDN'T see it, but a hypocrite sees it and said, "Well, I don't want to do it. I'm putting it off next year, next month, six months from now." &gt;&gt; My notice again, HE SAID, "WE'LL never conquer as long as we're selfish." &gt;&gt; God hates sin. &gt;&gt; Wow. Why in the world would he use the word sin after the word selfish? Because selfishness to the degree that God looks at it in this type is sin. &gt;&gt; And he will not let it triumph OVER WRONG. THEY'RE SELLING THEIR BIRTH RIGHTS for a mess of pottage, A MESS OF DENOMINATION, A MESS of organization that God hates. JUST REMEMBER, YOU SAY ORGANIZATION, God hates it. It's a thing that separated brothers and broke down. Now remember, not the people. MANY OF YOU KNOW AND WORK WITH GOOD PEOPLE THAT GO TO denominational churches right in our area right here. As a matter of fact, some of them might be kinder to you to message people. &gt;&gt; I don't mind. I'm telling you, I've been treated way worse by message people than I ever was in Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I've been lied to way worse with message preachers. I've been treated way worse by message people and and and message preachers than I ever was the years that I was in Pentecost. And to me, that again proves this message is the truth. So where do you find the most sticks when you're in an apple orchard under the best tree? SO YOU'VE GOT ALL THIS DAMAGE AND ALL THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER. And people try to use that to say, "Well, to me it proves it's wrong." Well, I look at it totally different. To me, it proves it's even more right than I thought it was because Satan's trying to use all them to scare me away from the tree. It ain't scaring me away from this tree. Amen. AND YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. And it's hard to rise above the hurts. The church people will hurt you. ministers will hurt you and say, "Well, my goodness, if anybody ought to love me." And remember, preachers, I don't care how godly, how holy, how high they fly. They are still human beings. And every one of them are flawed and every one of them are a work in progress just like you. So don't have mercy just on the leoty. Have mercy on the preachers. God knows they need it. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Notice they'll pay the priests and he'll pay them out of hell. Now he's talking about purgatory or Catholicism and it's nicotin and GOD SAID I HATE THAT. Let me see and say God said he hated it. LET'S SEE. THOU SITH THAT hatest the DEEDS OF THE NICKEL. GOD hates an organization. God hates &gt;&gt; an organization &gt;&gt; whether it's Baptist, Methodist, Church of God, Church of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fuia, &gt;&gt; Seven Thunder, Tape Only. &gt;&gt; Don't you understand what it's doing? &gt;&gt; It's organizing people under a certain thing &gt;&gt; all around the message is being organized. And if you don't come to our group, then you're not part of us. Then you're not going. They're doing exactly the same thing &gt;&gt; of what the prophet stood against and said God hated. Well, how can we love it then? &gt;&gt; How is how can we as message people love it to where we just keep going out going out separating separating separate nobody but I'm not sure if there's anybody preaching the truth or brother Donnie if you got that on you today you need to repent and ask God to forgive you. &gt;&gt; God's got men of God all over the world. Would we all sit down and agree together? We would not. I am not God's standard. Word of life is not God's standard. God's word is God's standard. And there ARE BROTHERS THAT WE DISAGREE WITH, CHURCHES THAT WE DISAGREE. BUT MY GOODNESS, FRIENDS, THERE'S SO FEW OF US LEFT. WE NEED one another. We don't NEED TO GO AROUND DIVIDE AND SEPARATE. WELL, we won't preach for them and they won't preach FOR US. IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE NOBODY LEFT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; I want you to know I'm not now and never have been against the people. It's the denomination, the system of organization that I'm against. I HAVE TO BE AGAINST IT. HE SAID, for God hates it. Now the question is, do you &gt;&gt; do you hate the system of organization? Yes. &gt;&gt; If you do with a godly hatred, then you'll look at those people that are in there with pity &gt;&gt; and you won't carry the same hatred from the organizational system over to them blind individuals. &gt;&gt; But you'll pray for them instead of condemning them. &gt;&gt; You'll pray for them instead of pointing your finger at them. Look at them bunch of Jezebels. Oh yeah, I understand. I understand all the Jezebel quotes. I know all that. But how much do we pray for them Jezebels? How much do we PRAY FOR THEM THAT GOD WILL HELP THEM? And if there's ANYTHING IN THEM, BRING THEM OUT, LORD. BECAUSE IF YOU SISTERS WILL REMEMBER BACK, SOME OF YOU USED TO BE JEZEBELS, TOO. SOME OF YOU BROTHERS USED TO BE CIGARETTE SUCKERS and drinkers and mongers AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AND WHAT WAS IT THAT CHANGED YOUR LIFE? SOMEBODY PRAYED FOR YOU. SOMEBODY DIDN'T THROW YOU OUT THERE AND LEAVE YOU IN THAT MESS OF THE WORLD OR DENOMINATION, BUT SOMEBODY FELT TO GIVE YOU A BOOK OR A TAPE. AND THEY PRAYED THAT GOD WOULD OPEN YOUR EYES. LET'S HATE THE SYSTEM. YES. BUT LOVE them people &gt;&gt; that are in it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Uh, this one right here, it's a little bit different now. All things in shreport. God hates [snorts] a powerless religion. &gt;&gt; A powerless religion. Now, we're not just dealing now with emotion. &gt;&gt; He doesn't say God hates an emotionless religion. I I couldn't find that quote. I looked at every one of them. God hates all several hundred of them and God loves and God loved and God loving. I wanted TO FIND OUT MYSELF WHAT DOES GOD LOVE? What does God hate? I want to be like him. &gt;&gt; So God hates a powerless religion. And any religion today that hasn't got Christ in it is powerless. But any religion that Christ is in under his own blood, it's got power in it. You say, "God hates a religion without power." He said, "Your solemn feast is a stink." I guess he does hate it. He said it makes HIM SICK. GOD HATES POWERLESS RELIGION. IT'S GOT TO HAVE POWER IN IT. IT'S GOT TO HAVE SINCERITY. Sincerity brings power. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. SO IT'S NOT JUST FA FASTING. IT'S NOT JUST PRAYING, reading our Bible, listening to the message, playing the tapes. No, not in this quote anyway. He didn't say that. None of that that I just listened to you above is what actually brings power, but sincerity. &gt;&gt; How many knows in reality we need to be more sincere? &gt;&gt; More sincere. Now sincerity then will bring power. Remember the scripture tells us in Acts 1:8 AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you. Now when I'm talking about power, I'm not meaning power just to run the pews and power to, you know, cast out devils. I'm talking about power to live right. Power to bring our flesh under subjection and control of the Holy Ghost. I'm talking about power that when people will run you down and say bad things against you and SPREAD LIES ON YOU, THAT POWER INSIDE OF you will calm your flesh and it will empower you where you won't get back on Facebook and do the same thing to them that they did to you because you have power. WE NEED MORE POWER IN THE MESSAGE. WE DON'T JUST NEED POWER TO CAST OUT DEVILS AND POWER TO LAY HANDS ON THE SICK, BUT WE NEED POWER TO LEARN HOW TO SHUT OUR MOUTHS AT THE RIGHT TIME. WE NEED POWER TO LEARN HOW TO CONTROL OUR TONGUE AND CONTROL OUR TEMPER AND COME TO CHURCH OVER a little headache and COME TO CHURCH EVEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE TALKING about you. What if staying HOME FROM CHURCH WILL EXEMPT YOU FROM coming to church? I'LL NEVER SEE YOU ALL AGAIN CUZ I'M TALKED ABOUT MORE THAN ALL OF YOU. I'VE GOT MORE LIES SPREAD ON ME THAN ALL OF YOU PUT TOGETHER. BUT I AIN'T STAYING HOME. I'M COMING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND I'M GOING TO PREACH AND I'M GOING TO PRAY AND I'M GOING TO SING AND I'M GOING TO WORSHIP. DOES IT HURT ME? OF COURSE IT HURTS ME. BUT IT LETS ME KNOW HOW MUCH THE DEVIL HATES ME. AND [screaming] YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH HE HATES YOU. HE WANTS YOU TO STAY HOME. HE WOULD RATHER YOU STREAM THAN BE HERE SAYING AMEN. BUT WHAT ABOUT [screaming] IT? WORD OF LIFE. ARE WE GOING TO TURN INTO HOME STREAMERS OR ARE WE GOING TO TURN INTO CHURCH SCREAMERS? WE'RE COMING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND WE'RE SAYING AMEN [screaming] AND PRAISE THE LORD AND PREACH IT. BROTHER DONNIE, WHY? WE ARE NOT LETTING THE DEVIL STOP US. GOD HATES IT. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; NOTICE what sincerity does. It's got to have sincerity. And sincerity brings power. Sincerity brings real worship. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Sincerity brings real worship, not forms. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, having been a Pentecostal previously, some people think forms is just this. You're not pouring a concrete driveway. Okay? So, if you're pouring concrete, you want something that's not going to bend. You don't use jell-o as a form to mold the concrete. You want something that's rigid. But do you understand this can also be a form? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All you got to do is go to YouTube &gt;&gt; and t type in Pentecostals dancing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're trying to identify it as the bride or this is the bride's dance. &gt;&gt; Well, if that's so then a lot of the Bob Jezebels I've been looking at on on YouTube from Pentecostals, that means they're bride, too. cuz they dance a whole lot more and a whole lot faster. &gt;&gt; And their startup time's a lot far faster than ours is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I believe in dancing. Yeah. But I want to live right when I get done dancing, too. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Yes. Sincerity brings real worship, not forms. You know, in the days when Harry and I was back in Pentecost and we played our instruments and we God forgive us, but we probably made the people go whoring, didn't we, Harry? &gt;&gt; YOU STOPPED THE MUSIC. I went to praising. &gt;&gt; I went through hallelujah. I WENT THROUGH GLORY TO GOD'S. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Come on. &gt;&gt; SO, YOU COME TO FIND OUT THEY'RE NOT ALREADY PRAISING GOD BECAUSE THEY got joy. They like that key of G, not J. J O Y. Give me G, brother. GIVE ME G. WOO. GLORY TO GOD. THOSE OF YOU THAT are familiar with snake handlers, you know yourself. THEY DON'T WALK STRAIGHT IN THERE OFF THE STREET AND PICK UP a rattlesnake or a copperhead or a black mamba. What do they do? They get that music going. They go to dancing and jerking around. I SAW THE SAME THING IN DURBAN, South Africa when I was there years and years ago when they're going to put fish hooks in the backs of THESE MEN ABOUT THAT LONG and they're going to take A PIN ABOUT THAT long and hold their tongue out and weave that pin inside their tongue and they're going to pull little carriages on their back with them big grab hooks. And they would not do it immediately until they had a group of men standing around them, little symbols about that big. And they'd stand there and play them. And these others go to chanting AND DANCING AND SHOUTING AROUND. And then whenever the man in the middle, he knew he was right. HE WOULD LET OUT A SCREAM. AND THE PREACHER, BROTHER TOMMY SAID, "NOW WATCH THEM. AS SOON AS THEY SCREAM OUT, it's ready because the demon has now desensitized the feeling in their body." AND I STOOD RIGHT THERE AND VIDEOED IT AND WATCHED THEM TAKE A LONG PIN, LOOK LIKE AN OLDFASHIONED hat pin, and weave that thing inside of their tongue, not one drop of blood. TAKE THEM GRAB HOOKS AND STICK IN THEIR BACKS AND PULL OUT BIG PIECES AND HANG ORANGES AND GRAPEFRUIT AND DIFFERENT THINGS ON THEM HOOKS. NEVER SAY OUCH. NEVER SAY OH NO NOTHING. WAITING TO GET UNDER IT. OH MY. BUT I WANT TO KIND OF DANCE IN MY FEET THAT WHEN ALL HELL IS RAGING AGAINST ME AND HARRY'S 500 MILES AWAY THAT I CAN STILL SAY PRAISE GOD. MY GOD IS A VICTORIOUS GOD. I WANT ENOUGH JOY IN MY HANDS THAT I CAN CLAP AND SAY, "PRAISE THE LORD JESUS. I'VE GOT THE VICTORY TODAY OVER HELL. I'VE GOT THE VICTORY OVER SADNESS AND DEPRESSION." AMEN. COME ON, SOMEBODY. LET'S HAVE CHURCH TODAY. WE WANT THAT KIND OF WORSHIP BEFORE OUR GOD. AND SINCERITY is what brings it, &gt;&gt; not music. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; SINCERITY BRINGS POWER. SINCERITY brings real worship. Not thorns, but genuine power. Worship to know that you've passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Did you know that worship involves that &gt;&gt; worship? To know that you passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Again, God hates a pyrus religion. It's got to HAVE THAT IN IT. GENUINE POWER WORSHIP TO KNOW that you pass from death unto life. Let's jump down here now to First John chapter 2. When Jesus was here, he we know was God in the flesh. 100% God, 100% man. So if he expressed godliness from the aspect alone of deity, he could never be my example. Since I wasn't born of a virgin, he could never be yours. So he must humble himself and become void in the sense of the great power of his godhead. He must change himself and canosis himself and empty out and make void. SO NOW HE WALKS ON THE EARTH THEN for 30 years under this feeling of a man without deity in his body. &gt;&gt; Now when the father comes in him then the FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD bodily is now embodied in God's human temple. Look at 1 John chapter 2:4. He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. BUT WHO SO keepeth his word, not quoteth it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not studyth it, &gt;&gt; but he that keepeth his word. In him verily is the love of GOD PERFECTED. HEREBY KNOW WE THAT we are in him. He that saith, he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked. He that saith he abideth in him ought himself. So those of us that say we abide in the Lord Jesus ought ourselves to walk even as he walked. SO, HOW IS THAT possible if he walked like God alone? I could never do that. You could never do that. But what if he walked as a man filled with God? He would have to battle things. He would have to go through things because remember his hatred FOR THIS ABOMINATION IS SO TO SET YOU FREE. NOT hates you like he hates the bondage you're in. &gt;&gt; Jud, I know you understand this is the way we help people. Oh my goodness. If you could sit with me sometimes and hear the things that I have heard in the lives of individuals, the sin they've got into, oh, the evil that they've overcome with. And as a pastor, as a preacher, IT BREAKS MY HEART. Brother Donnie, I've been doing this. I' I've been doing that. I got involved in this. I've got involved that. Whether whether they come here or not, just in different places around the world that I've heard horrible, horrible stuff. AND IF I WOULD LET HATRED RISE UP IN MY HEART, AND WHEN I LOOK AT THEM, I feel that hatred coming out of me. And I look at them and say, "Dave Johnson, how in the world could you do that? I'm so ashamed OF YOU. YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING that &gt;&gt; Am I treating the sin?" &gt;&gt; Or am I treating the sinner? &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. NOW YOU SEE ONE THING ABOUT JESUS DISPLAYING godliness was that he always took the father's word over fear, anxiety, temptation, tests, trials. Notice in Matthew 4:4, "And he answered and said, it is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." Verse 7, Jesus said unto him to the devil, "It is WRITTEN AGAIN, THOU SHALT NOT tempt the Lord thy God." Verse 10. Then saith Jesus UNTO HIM, "GET THEE HENCE, SATAN, for it is written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve." I want you to notice that he's not overcoming by waiting on A VISION. HE'S NOT OVERCOMING BY SPEAKING in tongues and interpreting. HE'S NOT OVERCOMING BY SAYING, "LET ME get along now. Let me pray and let me get the anointing on me." And when the anointing comes, I'LL MEET YOU, SATAN. YOU WILL NOT DEFEAT ME. But how is he overcoming? Through the attribute of divine godliness. To be LIKE GOD. TO BE like God in a human being IS WHEN YOU AND I ARE tempted and we're going through great times of discouragement. YOU ARE DISPLAYING GODLINESS when you always point the devil and yourself back to his word. He said he'd never leave me. He said he'd never forsake me. Well, how come he ain't answering your prayers? Well, I don't know, but God is not a liar. Well, you're going through this and your family's going through that. You've been through one trial after another. Don't sound like to me God loves you, but you're going to display godliness in your tests. YOU'RE GOING TO DISPLAY GODLINESS. THIS IS WHAT JESUS DONE. HE SHOWED US how God would live if God was a man and he was. WELL, HOW IS GOD'S WIFE GOING TO LIVE? Because they are men, women, boys, and girls. If we have godliness in our life and power through sincerity is going to empower us to overcome, we're going to stand right there on the word. We'll look circumstance in the face. will look all types of negative things in the FACE AND SAY, "GOD IS TRUE AND YOU ARE A LIAR, DEVIL. GET BEHIND ME, SATAN." &gt;&gt; NOTICE PHILIPPIANS 2:3. LET NOTHING BE done through strife or VAIN GLORY, BUT in loneliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves. NOW YOU SEE PAUL captures the very manifestation of Jesus in this verse. &gt;&gt; So he's quoting Jesus life and he rewrites it in the Philippian letter. Now we could not do this prior to his advent. REMEMBER HE BECOME A CREATURE OF TIME. THE CREATURE OF time emptied himself. Well, at least you're listening. Praise the Lord. NOW, WATCH AGAIN. PAUL WHEN HE when he deals with this and he uses these words, I love them. You're talking about powerful. Let nothing be done through strife, which means contentious electioneering or intriguing for office. Now you hear us talk about church politics, &gt;&gt; believe me, it's around this message. &gt;&gt; God have mercy on us and keep it out of our church. &gt;&gt; So people running for an office like somebody would for a mayor or a governor. I want to be the associate pastor. I want to be a deacon. I want to be this. I want to be that. Go to go talk to this brother. Oh, tell brother so and so maybe I could put me on the board. Me or maybe I could be the &gt;&gt; Oh my brother. &gt;&gt; Let nothing be done through elections, &gt;&gt; campaigns. &gt;&gt; OH MY. OR VAIN GLORY, groundless self-esteem, empty pride, a vain opinion &gt;&gt; or error. Let nothing be done through strife OR VAIN GLORY. NOW REMEMBER PAUL IS CATCHING the epitome of the eternal which become a time creature and showed us how the eternal lived because this is the very life of the Lord Jesus we're reading about but in loneliness of mind. What a powerful powerful word. I want you to LOOK AT THIS LONELINESS of mind. Now remember whenever he writes this he's writing it to a people who he believes have achieved the new births. So it's humbleness OF MIND THE HAVING A HUMBLE opinion of oneself. &gt;&gt; Now most of us probably don't have a difficult time having humble opinions of everybody else. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Well, she ain't much of a Christian. &gt;&gt; He ain't much of a singer. He ain't much of this. You see what you're doing? You're having a humble opinion. And I know sometimes we're quoting their track record, but there's always hope for change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want YOU TO NOTICE THAT WHY WOULD PAUL CATCH THIS? THIS COULD NOT BE SAID, AS I said, in the OLD TESTAMENT BECAUSE MAN WOULD not be able to do this. Even Moses couldn't have done this. THE HAVING A HUMBLE OPINION OF ONESELF, A DEEP sense of one's moral littleness. &gt;&gt; But do we have a sense of how little that we are &gt;&gt; or how big &gt;&gt; we think we are? &gt;&gt; Godliness. &gt;&gt; How many still wants it? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, three threequarters of you, half of you. Okay. Well, I'll keep on preaching then. I'll maybe I'll get the other quarter. My my deep sense of one's moral litterness, modesty, humility, humility, loneliness of mind. Now, with the meanings of the words intact, let's read the verse again. Let nothing be done through strife, contentious, electionary, vain glory, groundless self-esteem, or loneliness. Have loneliness of mind, the humble opinion of one's self. LET EACH ESTEEM OTHER better than themsel. So true humility, LISTEN SAINTS, TRUE HUMILITY DOES NOT CON OH, IT DOES NOT CONSIST OF THE LONELINESS of expression of others, but in the loneliness of mind and opinion actually of yourself. MY MY 1 PETER 5:5 LIKEWISE, YE YOUNGER, submit yourselves UNTO THE ELDER. YAY, ALL OF YOU BE SUBJECT ONE TO ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And be clothed with humility. &gt;&gt; Now I'm talking bride material. Not how big I am, how great I am, how important I am, not how big you are, how important we are. &gt;&gt; But our clothing is actually humility. &gt;&gt; Now again, Paul is capturing the epitome of the canosis of God. For he who knew no sin becomes sin that we might become the very righteousness of God in him. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made of himself of no reputation. Oh my. COLOSSIANS 3:12, "PUT ON THEREFORE AS THE ELECT OF GOD, HOLY AND BELOVED, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering." [snorts] Actually, if you get this right, and it's the mind of Christ, it will let you be able to view your brothers of being more devoted to God than you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Which in turn will make your brothers feel the same way about you. &gt;&gt; Now, it's evident that some of our preachers in the message don't have this because they think they're the greatest men that God ever sent upon the earth. They are God's gift to the earth and and you you all are so blessed just to be able to, you know, just walk in the in the tracks where they said, "Uh, need a great lesson in humility." Amen. &gt;&gt; But a true man of God can look around and say, "God, what have I ever done for you? God, what am I going to amount to? Lord God, you've done this." I ain't talking about men who say that and it's vain and empty. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about men who believe it about themsel. That's right. &gt;&gt; Preach, Brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; Amen, Brother Donnie. We're behind you, Brother Donnie. Glory to God, Brother Donnie. I'm making up all these different voices. Y'all should be doing it for me, but since you ain't going to, I guess I'll have to DO IT MYSELF. PREACHER, BROTHER DONNIE. AMEN, BROTHER. GLORY, [screaming] BROTHER DONNIE. AMEN, BROTHER DONNIE. THANK YOU, JESUS. THANK YOU, JESUS. THAT WAS SOME OF YOU SISTERS. Philippians chapter 2:4. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. So in looking at the things that you excel on and that you've achieved, what you actually do is turn your eyes away from yourself and look at others. You see, friends, this is the exact opposite of what the world is telling us. &gt;&gt; They're teaching us how to love oursel. I have never had a problem with that. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to speak for the rest of you. Neither have you. You all don't stand in front of the mirror. Some of you men pimp like a woman. My lord, you stand there and polish them teeth and floss them and rebrush them and refloss them and got them three hairs and boy, you baby them three. Which I guess if I had three, I'd baby them, too. Boy, you look at this and that and the other and you walk in, well, I can't believe so and so. Look at them socks. They don't even matter. Who in the world picked out his britches? I can't believe this or that. OH MY. WE'VE GOT THIS GREAT IMAGE. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, FRIENDS? It's an age when people worship THE HUMAN BODY. DO YOU THINK IT'S JUST HAPPENED IN THIS DAY THAT GYMS ARE POPPING up everywhere and people wanting to go to the gym? Don't you understand? I'm not against exercise, but when you GET TO A SPOT TO WHERE YOUR GOD BECOMES YOUR BODY, YOU'RE HEADING for hell. YOU GET TO A SPOT TO WHERE YOU WANT TO FLEX YOUR MUSCLES AND LOOK AT HOW STRONG YOU ARE AND HOW I AIN'T INTERESTED. CAN YOU BENCH 110 LBS? CAN YOU BRING THAT DEMON OF PORNOGRAPHY UNDER YOUR FEET? DON'T TELL ME HOW BIG YOUR BICEPS ARE AND YOUR TRICEPS AND YOUR BICEPS. I WANT TO SEE, CAN YOU PUT SATAN UNDER YOUR FEET AND LIVE A GODLY LIFE THAT DEMONS IN HELL ARE SCARED OF YOU. [applause and cheering] True humility can look at those you go to church with. Every true man of God who has humility can look at the ministry of others and see where they actually excel him. &gt;&gt; The more I study these things, the more I'm wondering how many there will be in the rapture. &gt;&gt; 30, 35, 40. Philippians 2:5, "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus." In other words, think ye the same things as Jesus Christ. Let the same condescending and humble department appear in you as it did in him. So when he was here, every time a bird would have sung, he could have said, "I composed that song. &gt;&gt; I actually gave that to the birds." And whenever a go, he said, "I made him do that. You like that? That's in the key of C flat." You know, I mean, and the cow. He said, "I own that. That's copyrighted. &gt;&gt; Come on. You looked at the rainbow and you seen the colors. He said, "I I own that. I made that. I could copyright that." &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; He could have preached things that would have totally overwhelmed the greatest theologian that ever lived. &gt;&gt; But instead, he humbled himself and preached about fishing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And a sewer went forth to sew his seed. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You mean that was his depth? Come on. &gt;&gt; That was as deep as Jesus was. &gt;&gt; No, it wasn't as deep as Jesus was. &gt;&gt; He condescended, &gt;&gt; he condenses. &gt;&gt; Oh, he could have preached things NO ONE COULD HAVE EVEN COMPREHENDED. AND WHAT good would that have done? &gt;&gt; Showed that he was a knowit all. &gt;&gt; He's truly the only know-it-all that ever lived. &gt;&gt; That's right. I SAID HE'S THE ONLY KNOW IT ALL THAT EVER LIVED, BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE A KNOW IT ALL ATTITUDE. AND YET HE KNEW IT [screaming] ALL. &gt;&gt; GODLINESS. You see, your attitude and my attitude should be the same as Christ Jesus. After all, outlook determines outcome. Outlook determines outcome. So if the outlook is selfish, the actions will be divisive and destructive. But if it's Christ centered, it will be building up the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. building up the kingdom, not what we can tear down. What can we do to help? Let me close you momentarily. I love this. I preached this around the world. Question answers cood book. Every time I've ever preached them, wherever it's ever been, just reading these quotes, you know, it just really does something to people. Satan was the original archangel of God. He once dwelt in the heaven. He was once the greatest person in the heavens outside of God. He was God's right-hand man to fellowship. So if God wanted to talk to anyone and fellowship with any of his angelic beings precreation of man, he would talk to Lucifer. Now remember, not the devil because at that time he was not the devil. He was Lucifer, day star, lightbringer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So him and Lucifer would fellowship. You imagine what they talked about. &gt;&gt; And God would fellowship with the lightbringer. Isaiah 14, of course, and Ezekiel also tells us, Ezekiel 28, thou was perfect until iniquity was found in me. THOU WAS PERFECT FROM THE DAY THAT THOU was created. And when he's riding my back, sometimes I like to pull it up on my phone and pull out one of my favorite scriptures to him and say, "Come a little closer. Let me remind you, you were created, which means you're going to die. &gt;&gt; You are not eternal. Amen. [laughter] YOU ARE NOT PART OF THAT BLESSED ELOHIM, and I am. You're a creature of time, and I'm not. WHEN THERE IS NO MORE DEVIL, THERE WILL STILL be you and I. &gt;&gt; Listen to what a position, friends. He was God's right-hand man to fellowship. And he smoked a cigarette and found a tobacco plant out there in the Garden of Eden. And he found a hemp plant. And he found corn and made moonshine. &gt;&gt; He got puffed up in his heart. &gt;&gt; And isn't that just the way people get today? LET GOD JUST BLESS A fellow a little bit and put a confidence in him and he gets to be a knowit-all. &gt;&gt; He gets to he's GOT TO START AN organization or he's got to do something. Now friends, don't just limit this Baptist Church of God, Church of Christ. Bring it right on down to our ranks. And what will a man do whenever he feels like he's got something superior to the rest of the brethren? He's saying SOMETHING ELSE NOBODY ELSE IS SAYING. OH, THERE AIN'T NOBODY THAT'S even close. I'd be terrified of such a thought myself. This is a body move. &gt;&gt; It ain't a one-man deal no more. God ain't got one man in the south and one man in the north and one man over in Europe. God's got men everywhere. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; And what do they WANT TO DO? START SOMETHING AND THEN PUT A LITTLE fence around it. And you got to come through our gate &gt;&gt; to get in. &gt;&gt; Well, to be honest with you, I ain't going through that gate in the first place. They may hand me up in there. He's got to start an organization. HE'S GOT TO DO something that's different. Why art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer? Wow. Go from talking about preachers to talking about the devil. Listen to this and I'll close. God has a hard time &gt;&gt; trying to get somebody that he can deal with that'll stay humble. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? He made this universe. He didn't have a hard time. No, &gt;&gt; he made all these things that he's made. He didn't have a hard time. &gt;&gt; Who gives God the hardest time? [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of it. &gt;&gt; I'm sick of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to change my hard times instead of this way to this way. &gt;&gt; I want to give that devil a hard time. &gt;&gt; Anybody else? &gt;&gt; We humble ourselves. [applause] &gt;&gt; Let me close. God has a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that'll stay humble and meek and stay in the place until God calls him to do something. You believe that? &gt;&gt; And a man that God can bless and he'll still keep himself a man &gt;&gt; and not be an angel or a God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I realize, friends, I'm as dumb as a coal bucket, but I don't understand how a cold bucket thinking could ever get to a place that you think you're a god &gt;&gt; or you're an angel. Apparently, people that get there think a lot more of their yourself than I think of mine. Cuz my greatest enemy, it's not women, it's not money, it's not popularity, it's not pornography. My greatest enemy is me. &gt;&gt; I've not one thing to be proud of, not one thing to brag on. &gt;&gt; Everything that I've ever got good has come from God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anything I ever accomplish in this life, &gt;&gt; he will deserve all the credits and all the glory. &gt;&gt; How can I make a god out of me? &gt;&gt; How can I make a god or an angel out of you? Amen. &gt;&gt; But if we will humble oursel, God will transform us into a place of godship. &gt;&gt; Godship. &gt;&gt; You, if you're born again today, must stand. You have a part of heaven in your soul. The prophet calls that deity. When God divided himself way back before there was angels in time and he thought of his attributes of his children, he was going to allocate to them a portion of his deity. That's what's in you. that helps you. That's what in you. Even when your flesh, when you do something wrong, you don't have to wait and just hear me preach it. Wait till next Wednesday, next Sunday, whenever it is, and you'll know you're wrong. If you've got deity in you, your own baptism of deity will convict you for what you've said or done. &gt;&gt; How many knows what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; Can I finish this quote here? As soon as a man gets blessed and has a little something given to him, he wants to become a god. He wants to become an angel. He wants to become some great person. Me and me and mine and I prayed for this person. God showed me that. I've done this and I've done that. And they get up. My goodness. They they talk about themselves 30 minutes and then talk about the Lord 25. But it's all giving glory to God. really is it? Is it? So at the end of that service, does that make people want to get closer to God or does it make them want to get close to that man so we pray for him? &gt;&gt; Do they have same confidence that God without that man could do the great works? It's evident people can't friends. So their faith is not in God's word, but their faith is in that man praying for them and then they'll get well. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what if God takes that man from the earth? &gt;&gt; So if your only way of deliverance and help is through me, then every one of you are lost. &gt;&gt; Cuz if time carries one day, I will leave this world. You want your faith to be in the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Does God use men? Of course. Does God have special gifts? Of course. But never ever put any man before your Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Notice this. He said, "That's the wrong attitude. God's hunting for somebody." God has been on a hunting trip. Ever since man fell, &gt;&gt; he's hunting for trophies. These trophies are men. He said God's hunting for somebody who he could bless and pour out the blessings and the more he blessed, the littleler the man will become. &gt;&gt; But see, that's backwards to us. The way we look at it, the more God uses the man, the bigger he gets, the bigger, the greater, more meetings, famous. &gt;&gt; Someone came [clears throat] before our fall fest is visiting some family here and I was out here working, doing some stuff. This brother came over and he said, "Your brother don't recogn." I said, "Yeah, probably didn't look like it. Had on blue jeans, holes in them, mud. I've been down on them down on my knees filling a ditch up over here and spreading out mulch and sweat. Probably smelt bad. Oh, he said, "I I've seen you hours and hours and hours on on video." "Oh, brother, so glad to meet you." "Oh my, you're you're probably one the most famous preacher in the message." I said, "Brother, Donnie Reagan and the word famous to me don't go together. There's only one famous &gt;&gt; person." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we want to talk about around here. And it sure ain't me. &gt;&gt; And it ain't no other preacher. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's our Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, can we tell God today, I want to be so godly, and I promise you, if you use me, I'll never be exalted. Lord, if you'll take my gift that you gave me and anoint my singing, and whenever I sing, I will bless your people, I promise you, I'll never walk from behind that piano and think, "What a singer I am. I'm so gifted. I'm so talented." &gt;&gt; But walk off here with godliness and bow your head and thank God that he could use you. Don't you love him today? &gt;&gt; How many wants to be godly? &gt;&gt; Godly. You see, Jesus didn't live godliness from the throne. He lived godliness from a dust body. May God help us. You'll never get more of God until you become nothing. You've got to belittle yourself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Belittle yourself. He that will exalt himself, God will abase. He that will humble himself, God will exalt. You've got to get little before you can get big. And you'll never be big in your own self. You'll only be as big as God will be big &gt;&gt; in you. Was it great what God did on our prophet of this age? Yes. Was it tremendous? Yes. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't brother Brandon been big. &gt;&gt; It was God being big in him. &gt;&gt; There's great men of God that's been in this message and they've done great, tremendous works for God. BUT IT WASN'T THAT they were big. It was God that got big in them. &gt;&gt; Grant it to us, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be big myself. I don't I I just want to be whatever. But maybe there's some big people here today. May you stay big as long as you let God be big in you. Let's bow our heads together. Oh Jesus, as we stand in your presence today, Father, these types of quotes, Lord, when I read them and study them, I have to be honest and say, Lord, there's an element of fear that it [music] brings because we've seen preachers and different people that would get big in their eyes. It isn't always preachers. Sometimes leoty get know-it-all attitudes and they've been around the message for how many years ever years it's been and they think they know more than any preacher preaching and they get this knowit all attitude. They don't need nobody to tell me nothing. They don't need to listen no more. Help each one of us. Father, help our song leaders. Help our singers. Help our musicians, our deacons, our trustees. every preacher Lord among us. God help me. I need your help. Lord Jesus, help me. Lord, I'll never be a great person. I don't have the makings of a great person. I just want to be an obedient person. You privileged me to be able to travel around the world and I've met some great men. But I'm reminded brother George Burcham when he told me several times of course down in Kentucky when the prophet came to his cheese plant there in Albany, Kentucky. Brother George said they had antiques in their home. And Brother Brandham came there to their house and he wouldn't even sit on the furniture because he said it was so nice. He he just wanted to sit in the floor. So he sat in the floor in the living room with his legs crossed Indian style. And he said, 'Oh, brother Donnie, he would just talk about you and talk about this brother and that brother and another brother. He said he made you feel like he was the greatest person that ever was. And he lift up this man and that man and just humble himself and never bragged on how he done this or done that or the other. Thank you for such a man, Lord. It's no wonder you could do so much with him. Father, I desire to be godly. You've let me lay my hands on the sick of cancer. You've healed them. I've walked into the med center in the intensive care unit, lay my hand on one of our brothers and a heart attack and watched you stop it. I walked into the nick unit, Lord, when there was a valve messed up in a child and watched you work a miracle in that child. I've seen you do so many awesome, wonderful things, but I can't do none of those. I'm not a miracle worker. I'm not a healer. Anybody that's ever heard me knows I'm not much of a preacher. Really, not much of anything, I guess. But the key is if I could just get myself out of the way. If our church, if we could just each one of us get ourselves out of the way and humble ourselves. Oh, what do you want to do through us, Jesus? And Lord, we promise you today, whatever you do, we will not deprive you of the honor or the glory. We promise we will never venture into that great divine realm of the glory of God. I want to be more like you, Jesus. I want to be more like you. Not just in healing the sick and casting out devils and all that. Yes, I do. I want that, Lord. But I want to be able to turn my cheek, Lord, when people lie on me and fabricate stuff and try to ruin my character. I want to be able just walk right back up in this pull pit and not use the pullpit as a an area to try to get even with people and throw things at people. No, [snorts] I want to believe what your prophet said when he talked about the sacred desk. this being the closest place to heaven on earth. Help all the minister brothers at our church to recognize that when they walk up behind this desk. It's not a place to exalt ourselves. It's not a place for frivolous talk, but it's a place to lift up Jesus, a place to help you, his bride. We worship you today, Lord. Make us more like you, Jesus. Make us more like you, Jesus. Anybody here just raise your hand to the Lord. Just tell him, "Lord, I want to be more godly." More godly, forgiving, loving. Oh, yeah. Stern when I need to be, steady when I need to be, strong when I need to be, unmoving but kind. I want to hate the system, Lord, but love the people in it. And I want to love them so much that I look at them with pity and I don't judge them with a harsh attitude. Help us, dear Jesus. We want to love like you, Father. We want to forgive like you. Mold me, Lord Jesus. If you need a preacher that needs to be run down, run over, pushed, laughed at, ridiculed, it's picture in the paper, it's picture all over international television around the world. I will, Lord. You want a preacher that'll have to be laughed at and even some of his own friends will laugh at him. I will, Lord. Oh, I know most others want signs, wonders, miracles, fame, money, but Jesus, you had to be hated and despised. Who are we to be better than you? Is there any Christians here today that'll say the same? Lord, I'm willing to bear your reproach. Not just your glory, not just your power. I'm willing to bear your reproach, Lord, for the cause of the gospel. Oh, we thank you, Jesus. We thank you, Jesus. We thank you, Jesus. Let's just stand now in this in this divine presence. The angels of God are here this morning, friends. They're here to minister to us, to help us. Oh, how the angels must relay the messages back up to heaven after a service like today. And they're standing near you and they're hearing what you're saying in prayer. They see your attitude that this preaching didn't make you mad and angry and all, you know, bent out of shape at the preacher and all that, but they heard you as you whispered, "Lord, help me.
