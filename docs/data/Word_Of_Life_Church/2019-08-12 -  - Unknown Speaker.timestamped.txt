[0:00] people just get all stressed out of that
[0:03] to go to church once a week
[0:05] oh wow
[0:11] the Redskins will be playing about the
[0:14] time brother Donny's preach wonder if I
[0:17] could stream it on my phone while he's
[0:19] preaching NASCAR will be going on at
[0:25] Bristol about the time he gets in the
[0:26] pulpit you better be worried about the
[0:28] other fire instead of NASCAR but people
[0:34] make so much preparation for their hole
[0:36] and then for the retirement and for what
[0:39] you know I want people to think well of
[0:40] me but what about life what about
[0:43] preparation for eternal I'm not sure I
[0:47] gotta think about it
[0:49] so I'm starving to death tonight okay
[0:52] I'm so thirsty I'm so thirsty I can
[0:56] hardly make it I think I can hardly go
[0:59] and here's this bottle I know somebody
[1:25] didn't post but there did you put
[1:27] something in this no I know this did not
[1:34] come from a faulty factory and there's
[1:38] all kinds of stuff in here oh I might
[1:40] kill me well there's one way to know
[1:47] [Music]
[1:52] but brother Donnie what if you're
[1:54] following a fox perfect
[1:58] well this for the sake of your argument
[2:01] what if I am what if brother branham was
[2:06] a hundred and seventy five percent wrong
[2:07] and a hundred and seventy five percent
[2:09] of his sermons
[2:12] show me where that's brought me to a
[2:14] disadvantage show me you're welcome Stan
[2:24] show me where it has made me corrupt
[2:28] vile
[2:29] show me word has made me a child
[2:32] molester an adulterer a thief a liar
[2:36] show me where it is worked against me
[2:39] and a negative way in society Liberty
[2:42] Stan show me where this made me a vile
[2:45] wretched
[2:46] a wicked type of person but what is this
[2:51] message that we believe in priests is
[2:54] the truth you have lost everything
[2:58] if you stand against it
[3:08] come on Saints Obama Logano what if you
[3:12] lived this way what if there is no
[3:14] heaven you some of you hang on a minute
[3:16] you're not even going to understand what
[3:17] I'm going to say and some of your
[3:18] disagreements perfectly fine that you're
[3:20] right if there was no heaven if the laws
[3:24] no afterlife I'd still choose to be a
[3:27] Christian over being a sinner just for
[3:30] the benefits I have every day in my life
[3:33] as a child of God well now I know you're
[3:36] crazy yeah now you know for sure you
[3:39] heard me say it yourself
[3:41] if there was no heaven if there was no
[3:44] hell I'd still want to be a Christian
[3:46] because I've got joy that the world
[3:49] knows nothing about God peace that the
[3:52] world knows nothing about he heals me
[3:55] what I get sick he encourages me when I
[3:58] get down he helps me when I was somebody
[4:01] with plates was another knife I would
[4:03] live for him
[4:06] no straits of gold from Jesus
[4:16] but I did all Santo
