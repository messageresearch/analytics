more that's good Excuse me while I get dressed all right now maybe we should have brother Kevin come back up and sing that song we'll start all over again God bless you to stand together some of the funniest things can happen in church can't you but we are not defeated today amen First Kings chapter 19 verse 1. last Sunday we closed out with Elijah calling fire down out of heaven killed in a whole bunch of prophets God manifesting himself in such a supernatural way today would like to look at after that great victory First Kings 19 1. an Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done which was calling fire out of Heaven killing the false prophets and then of course he called rain down after the fire it was all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah's saying so let the Gods she believed more than one due to me and more also if I make not thy life as a life of one of them by tomorrow about this time in other words you've got 24 hours to live now once you notice this next verse and when he saw that I find this verse amazing because of the way that the writer writes it when he saw that not when he heard it but when he saw it you see whenever you and I will hear something from the Devil and it becomes so real to us we start seeing it we're in trouble the devil tell you you're defeated you can't make it you go to sin it yourself you better pull back and say Lord help me readjust my vision and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to Beersheba which belonged us to Judah and left his servant there but he himself won a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and requested for himself that he might die which is so peculiar because he run for his life and now he's wanting God to take his life what a state we get in when we get down spiritually and said it is enough now O Lord take away my life for I am not better than my father's now remember there was a total of 850 Prophets there were 450 which was of the male deity that the Canaanites and Ahab worshiped which was Baal b-a-a-l there was another 400 prophets which was of the female deity astarting or Venus she was supposed to be the wife of Baal now Ahab had a divided home because he worshiped Baal which was idolatry of course and his wife Jezebel worshiped Authority or Venus now what's sad about this is Ahab was a Jew but what's easy to see who was the boss of the house Jezebel was just pray together father we love you today we thank you for your grace to us Lord and your mercy and we ask you Lord Jesus that you would help us as we look into your word today father May ever Spirit be captivated by the presence of God we rebuke the devil which is already tried to hinder us but he ain't hindering us Lord God I pray that every heart would be open to your word today may we be arrested as it was in the presence of God May the Holy Ghost come I pray and Minister the word as only you can do help me to get out of the way Lord Jesus to step aside that you can use that part of yourself which you placed in me speak to us father we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated I like the way Spurgeon quoted this situation about Elijah he said that Elijah retreated before a defeated enemy retreated before a defeated enemy when God's servants get out of the will of God they are liable to just about do or say anything it's incredible how that a man like this just a few hours before this morning stood in the presence of God and saw the miraculous like we've never read about it before By Any Man see what God did and yet at the threat of one woman one woman he gets tore all two pieces it's like he forgets everything God has just done and all the other things God has done prior to this and he gets so beside himself that he don't know what to do and he begins to thinking and saying things that don't even make sense now I'm not here so much today to criticize Elijah but to bring Elijah's life sorted down to our own sometimes and it's amazing when the people of God get to this kind of state that they will become so vulnerable in some of their strongest and greatest points now a man like this Elijah of course was a great courageous man a man Fearless with God a man that would stand up against all these prophets and not just stand against them verbally but take a sword and kill 450 of them and one slaying and face the potential of meeting the army of Ahab and do all of that without one shaking or quivering of his faith but yet now Something's Happened you know I found the same thing in the life of Abraham and the life of David and the life of others I'm sure us as well Abraham one of his greatest strong points was his faith but when Abraham got weak in faith and went down in the land of Egypt the very thing that was his strengths became his very stumbling block David which was a man of great songs and all that yet great David's greatest strength was not his singing it was not his musical ability it was his Integrity David was a man of such integrity and yet as we've been looking at the life of Bathsheba it was through this his greatest strengths that David become so vulnerable his Integrity then waned away and vanished he becomes a liar a trickster a deceiver is that right Moses switched the Bible says in the Book of Numbers was the meekest man on the face of the earth a man so Meek and so humble and a man of such a tender Spirit but yet he got into such a state that he turned into a man with such a temper that he lost his temper and actually had to Forfeit his right to going into the Promised Land I wonder sometimes if Satan don't take advantage of us in those times of our strengths and we say oh this will never happen to me I'm so strong my strength is this and this and this and I will never fall to that oh but how Satan loves to hear us brag about such I think of Peter in the New Testament another man of such courage yet his courage failed and he denied that he even knew the Lord Jesus no doubt he felt so strong I will never forsake you it makes no difference oh John he's a weakling and Thaddeus he's this and that and James the great he's this and the others but Lord I'll tell you one thing I'll never do it if anybody will stand by you it will be me and the very thing he bragged about was the very place he fell like Peter Elijah was a bold man a man of great strengths and a man of great courage and yet we see a phenomenon here before us now this happened in the country of Jezreel the valley of Jezreel where the battle of Armageddon will actually take place not too long from today and Elijah has confronted all these false prophets the 400 knew better than to show up the 400 of us starting they never even came but he killed the 450 of Baal and I imagine that there was so much blood shed that it run Plum off the place there when you look down from the valley of Jezreel and you look up the the highest place there facing north you face what is called Elijah's cave it was actually there that Elijah came out and stepped on the top of that high place there and there's where the altar was and where he defeated baal's false prophets but he hears this reply from Jezebel and the Bible tells us there he decided to leave so where does he head he's going to head to Beersheba now Beersheba is the most southern part of the land of Israel it was under a different King if you know your Bible by this time you know that the Kingdom of Israel has become divided in two parts so to have a king over one part of Israel and a king over another part of Israel which is called Judah now it just so happens that Elijah is under the Dominion of Ahab which is the king over Jerusalem and the northern part of the Kingdom so what he decides to do is he's going to run and he's going to leave and go to the southern part bear Sheba is 95 miles 95 miles from Jezreel where he's just obey made God and done this great miracle 95 miles now he knows he has about 24 hours now unlike you and I couldn't pick up his cell phone and call Uber he cannot pick up and get a a plane ticket down there or a bus the only thing that he had basically was his feet now I want you to think this man takes off at such haste that he arrives the next day and runs 95 miles now I want you to think of the anxiety and the fear and the trauma and all that he's going through now he's so nervous he's so beside himself he don't know what to do and the anointing has now left him now you and I can relate to that a little bit we know how it is when we get in the presence of God and wonderful things happen and all boys sometimes it don't even wait till Monday morning sometimes it hits you Sunday afternoon and the spirit of God don't seem like it's nowhere around you and you don't know what to do well it would be even more personified of course than a man like this so he didn't rest on his way so he takes off and he must have been at a very rapid Pace in order to make this journey of 95 miles now Jehoshaphat was the king of Judah Jehoshaphat was a good man he loved the Lord and yet but he knew that there was a weakness about Jehoshaphat and that was that he had made so Lord of an allegiance with Ahab so whenever he gets down there the Bible tells us that what Elijah did was he left his servant so him and his servant take on running and they go heading right toward the South's land and they arrive in Beersheba so when he gets there the Bible says that he leaves his servant there now I want you to notice as he's going along the journey he is deteriorating as he's going in his mind he's deteriorating in his strengths he's deteriorating he's hungry because this is one of the first things that God tells the angels to do is give him something to eat so apparently he took off at such a rapid rate he's running running can you imagine now you're running so fast you run 95 miles 95 miles I've been on this track myself and it's nowhere like Interstate 26 or a lot of our country here but up and down and around and up and down 95 miles from there and they take off in this journey now when they get there he's still he's under this thing and he's entered into a deeper state of this depression so he comes to a spot to where that he realizes now there's only one man that knows where I am and that is my servant so he decides to leave the servant there he doesn't even trust him no longer you know this is something when we get down and we get weary and we go to fight and all kinds of things and one of the first things that Satan wants to do is begin to isolate us from other people people that we love people that love us and convince us really you can't trust anybody now what makes that more real is because we've all been betrayed by people have we not we've been betrayed by friends or have been betrayed by a family member sometimes betrayed by preachers or people that you have confidence in and whenever something like that happens you can't get over it overnight I don't care who you are so Satan then will bring that back whenever you're in a state like Elijah was in so he doesn't feel like that he can even trust his servant so he leaves him there and then the scripture tells us he goes on a little further now actually where he's going to go he's going to go into the Negev Desert now he's going into that spot which you've never been there or never seen places like it it's a very incredible place has its own Beauty but yet it has deaths everywhere you look at it it's absolutely a place of dryness hardly no trees no plants whatsoever and dry there hardly any rain at all hardly nothing to eat and here heads the prophet because now he Ventures 15 more miles so now he's run 95 miles within a 24-hour period and he takes off again I trade gobs his servant and he's got 15 more miles and he just goes deeper and deeper and deeper into this dry Barren spot how many has ever been there spiritually oh yeah we've all had our negative desert have we not now I want you to notice now in verse 4 that he himself went a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree now here he comes and he finally arrives 15 more miles into the Wilderness and he fills up by now he's safe I'm okay they won't be able to find me now and I'll be able to get there so he sees this juniper tree or as it's called in the Hebrew a broom tree now broom tree which would have white types of leaves which would be able to reflect this Mediterranean Sun it was also a place to where he could be able to refresh himself and think but he looks around he has no water he has no food he has no company so he's all by himself now whenever he gets to here I want you to listen now the prophet of God of this day which says the spirit of Elijah on him tells us what happens to Elijah the prophet is that he goes into a nervous breakdown now he he's already feeling all of this threat and all of this pressure and no doubt this had been accumulating for a long time it would be almost impossible for a man to have a nervous breakdown just going from a well State and within 24 hours having a nervous breakdown so more than likely it was the work and the load and the responsibility that was building up on this man and after this he felt like he was a failure because God had come down in a great way and he felt like apparently in his heart that the whole nation would now turn back to God and everybody's going to look around and say oh what God did what a great thing well there's no way anybody else could do that Bale couldn't do it Venus asteroth I thought he could not do that no other gods of the heathens could do such a thing and he must have been sort of like Jonah was when he felt like God is going to do a great thing and when it didn't not happen it must have seemed like a total failure because it was as if though what God had done meant absolutely nothing now we've never seen anything like that since is that right it's never been done quite like that since but it was like the he looked toward the miracle and he had something else in mind that the miracle is going to lead to the Revival of the whole nation but it didn't instead of leading to the Revival of the whole nation it turned them more against him and when Ahab goes home and tells Jezebel and the messenger comes back and tells Elijah now it seems like he's a complete failure which is one of the worst things any of us can feel like now whether you are a preacher whether you are a housewife or a husband or a child whatever you are if you're an electrician if you're a builder to feel like that you are a failure and want your called to do it's one of the greatest disappointments any of us can have so if you're already under the stress of that load your sisters that are Housewives and God bless each of you forgiving of yourself to your husbands and your children and you'll have a great reward one day you are very very very looked over in the day we're living because uh with laodicea the women who are the most I don't you know adored and all that lifted up in this age are those women who have some sort of great you know degree in college and their their women professionals and this and that and the other oh a great achievement is going to be achieved today before the Super Bowl will ever start uh the pilots that are going to fly over over by with the Navy Plains all of them will be women and All America feels like women are finally rising to their place they could have no higher place than what God gave them in the beginning but yet this is the way we think why because our nation is Anointed with that dominant thing that the women will be the leader in the last day this is why they will accept Jezebel spiritual to be their head and yet women then that are Housewives most of you women I don't figure will ever find F-35 or an F-22 or you'll never be out there glory to God throw in your long hair back working on a jet engine no most of you sisters probably the only kind of Grease you're ever going to have between your fingers is not ancient Greece it's going to be from cooking muffins and chicken and fried taters and stuff like that so in the eyes of the world then you all are nobodies you're nothing well let me tell you something that's absolutely alive from the pits of Hell God could give you no greater position than to be a woman and to be a housewife if that's so designed of God's purpose don't you let the feminism of this age make you sinful you are nothing because you will stand there that day of the Lord Jesus will reward you with a great reward is that right well while we're at it let's just go ahead brothers and give our sisters a nice hand I thank God for every daughter of God around the world they're a great treasure but we can see then what one woman in the hands of the devil does so here he's in the Negev Desert he's all by himself no one there around him and he finally goes into this state he feels like a failure his work has been so difficult for years and then the Bible says he requested for himself that he might die now look at where he's at he's just completed this journey of 95 miles overnight and a day and he's run till he's absolutely wore out and now he drops his servant off to anybody Sheba and he heads off another 15 miles he's already exhausted he's warned till he don't know what to do he's nearly beside himself and he was running for what running for death he was running for his life to be saved right then after he gets to Bear Sheba what does he do he said God I don't want to live no longer well what in the world did you just run over a hundred miles for if you don't want to live no longer look at how we can become when we get so stressed out that we don't even make sense well don't sit there and look at me funny y'all know what I'm talking about he said is it enough is it enough now oh Lord take away my life for I am not better than my father's now from this statement it would make you wonder if Elijah began to sink too highly of himself now I want you to notice this statement take away my life oh Lord for he says I am not better than my father so who told him that he was where did he get this idea that he was better than his father's now he's confessing he is not so you see he flees from death and now he prays for death it's the combination of emotional burnout emotional burnout and stress and the pressure of being a man in this office and feeling like that he's a total failure and I'll tell you one thing if we ever get to that spot we are in Dangerous Ground this is why people take their lives because they feel like their what their life is absolutely wasted so look at him he's in he's in total burnout he's feeling and experiencing a weariness which he's never felt before on top of that the man is so hungry he can hardly even go now you can imagine you're running running you don't think they even take no no food with you you got to get out there and you got to run fast and he's burned up all this energy running all night long and all day and then he drops him off his servant in Beersheba and he takes off another 15 miles can you imagine any of us running that far that's a joke I imagine some of us if we run three would be calling McDonald's we'd be called an Uber everybody else bring me some food bring me some food I can't make it no longer is this journey over how far are you I'm a thousand yards from the church come and get me I can't make an old father now you can imagine all of this accumulation of this stuff together so he's got emotional burnout and he's weary he's so exhausted and the man is basically starving to death and he has no no water that we know of and then he has this deep sense of failure deep sense of failure and then he let's just be honest he has a lack of faith something has now happened from that great miracle to where he thinks God will not take care of him now if you look at it really he there's no better place he could be than in the valley of Jezreel in the will of God you're better off in the valley of Jezreel facing the army of Ahab and the army of Jezebel then you are to be under oh my a juniper tree out in the middle of nowhere and not having faith to believe God can move for you so here he is he's also dealing with the lack of faith well let's just go ahead and be honest whenever we hear a bad report from the doctor or we look at something in a negative way and we begin to say oh no oh no will God move for me will it not oh god oh no God what are you going to do what are you dealing with you're dealing with Satan trying to battle your face and convince you that God won't do it this time he's done it before and he's done it for others but he won't do it for you and what are you battling a lack of faith well I'm not sure will he do it well I know he can oh sure if you've seen him do much you know he can't but do you know he will for you you see most of us Satan will not battle us can God do it we've seen him do so much that's even Beyond question is it not we know we can heal the sick we know it can heal cancer we've seen him do it we've seen him perform Miracle after Miracle but what is him when it comes right down to it will he do it for me oh my so here he is and now he has a nervous breakdown notice in verse 5 and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat can you imagine as he lays there and he's shaking and quivering and maybe he can't even talk and he's he's in a terrible terrible state crying lamenting thinking all types of thoughts I I want to die I don't even want to live no more I have nothing to live for I failed God I failed God's people maybe it was about this time he realized by what he had done he had made the situation worse because now he's going to appear to his church as if though he is a running coward oh it must not have hit him near as realistically as it did till he got under the juniper tree and I realized this what did I just do I cannot believe I have done this I have run from Jezebel I I defy the army of Ahab I killed 450 prophets by myself with a sword that had to take Supernatural strength of one man against 450. but then when the anointing leaves him and the only thing that gets on his mind is just run just run don't raise your hands but I wonder how many of you whenever you face trials and things as I said don't raise your hand but I wonder how many of you have contemplating getting in your car and starting it and never coming back never look back and what's amazing is you really have no plan where you're going well where are you going you're going to Estes Park and you know you're going where are you heading you're heading down to uh Florida where are you going I don't know I'm just I'm just out of here don't you see where you are don't you see where you are y'all you just got to leave so the thing is run where do we get that at because that's the way our father felt in the Garden of Eden when he fell and he didn't know what to do so the thing is just run away run away just run and run from your problems but you won't run away from your problems you'll be taking them with you now you might run from your wife from your children from the boss and this and that and the other but all them thoughts and all them issues they're right in here and they're right up here and they're in your spirit and they're in your thought pattern now you imagine what he gets down there and then it hits him and I chose it what have I done my Ministry is ruined well all the church all the elect of God if there's any of them left he even got that low there can't be a saved person left I'm the only one dear God only me it's amazing how we get so self-righteous in it ah even I I'm the only one left oh my but there's one thing I love about our father even though no doubt the light of this was self-inflicted to the Prophet Elijah maybe the Lord warned him over and over again you're getting too tired you're getting too worn you're getting weary better take a break no I'm good I'm good I'm strong look at me Lord I'm strong you better take a break better take a day off no that's a sign of weakness I don't need a day off Hallelujah I'm the mighty Elijah now the mighty Elijah is laying under a tree shaking like a leaf in the Wind no food no water no desire to even live you probably saw it as he felt sleep coming over him I hope I don't even wake up I hope to God I don't even wake up because I do not want to live another day I'm a failure and now I've kept it all off I run how in the world can I ever hold my head up again before God's people I'm a complete ruination I'll never preach again or maybe you're a housewife I'll never make another bed I'll never make another pancake I'll never do I can't stand it no more I'm such a failure all this has been heard in another dimension and father has a great delegation that is being gathered to go down to the Negev and they're being dispatched to meet at the juniper tree father says I want the angel with the softest hand to go down first and I want the best cook that there is among you I mean those God's got angels that know how to cook I want the angel that can cook the best I want this one I want that one I want you to go down and attend my prophet now let me just tell you today the Lord God still has those angels around with a soft touch if you're needing to touch today from his presence and he lay and slept under a juniper champion oh then an angel s so the angel with the softest touch just reaches over and touches him now you imagine father saying don't alarm him he's in such a state it could terrify him it could absolutely send him into a stroke or a heart attack Because he believes he's out here by himself in the middle of nowhere so the angel gently gently wake up Elijah dear beloved one of God wake up what is it it's okay it's okay I'm sent from the presence of God to tell you he's heard your cries Hallelujah then the other Angel is already there the best cook and he comes brings him what looks like something that is so simple and he says arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake bacon on the coals so this Angel also knew had a lot of Fire and you imagine a lie Elijah's laying their soul wound up in this if you notice it I'm sure that many times some people get so depressed they don't feel like getting out of bed many of them don't feel like getting dressed they don't feel like combing their hair Lord God use me this morning father I pray they don't feel like grooming themselves or taking care of themselves they just don't care anymore so while he's there the angel builds a fire and he's right there near him any he sees there was a cake bacon on the coals and a cruise of water at his head and he didn't eat and drink and laid him down again now the angel packs all kinds of vitamins in this corn cake you say how do you know it was corn because Elijah this day said it was corny ought to know so he packed all types of vitamins and nutrients and minerals and protein and carbs and all these things that his body needed because a man wasn't just finding a spiritual battle he was finding a natural body you know what as well as I do that when people get under a great load many times they lose their appetite and you can see it on their face their face speaks volumes that they're just not themself if they had a smile a certain smile they will still put on a certain smile all of us are still actors and we can act to a certain degree that everything was all right but the ACT smile is not the same as the true smile they act laugh and they act giggle it's not the same as the true one come on the ACT amen and the ACT Clapping Your Hands and the acts praising the lord it's not the same as the real one so they wake him up and he finally gets up and he he grabs a cruise of all and he or water rather he just still he just kind of adults in the means of person poor Feller bless his heart look at him I ain't never seen him like this before he's an awful shape that ever was poor guy so maybe they're helping me you just shake it he did here here let me help you so we're going to stick in that corn cake I can't talk I don't I don't feel like talking no no that's okay Elijah you don't need to talk just lay back down just say back down we'll be here with you we'll watch over you you're no longer alone Hallelujah you were no longer alone and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the image of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat I want you to notice the difference in this verse in verse 5. the first verse 5 he just tells him arise and eat but this time he adds a little more to the message and he says because the journey is too great for thee isn't it amazing that an angel of God but only say these words arise and eat three words he didn't want to startle him he didn't want to shake him he's so torn up that he can only comprehend even so much word he can only only comprehend so much love and care I find this so phenomenal that we as human beings can get so tore up and so apart from the reality of the love of God that God gently has to remind us again I love you I care for you I died for you I come to set you free and he knows sometimes if he gives it to you too much we're just going to automatic shutdown emotionally we're so burnt out we just can't even take the good oh Lord but this time the angel says arise and eat and then he says because the journey is too great fuzzy and he rose and did eat and drink and went in the strengths of that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto Horeb the Mount of God from Beersheba to Horeb there's 145 miles walking of course I don't know but this time after he got all these corn cakes he might have been flying a little bit every now and then you might have just been hitting the hot spots on the Negev Desert can you imagine a man being able to eat Glory too little corn cakes and on the strengths of them corn cakes able to go for 40 days and 40 nights I want you to notice here in verse 9 and he came thither into the cave and lodged there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto him what do us thou hear Elijah I'd like to ask you that this morning what are you doing here not in this building but where you are in your walk was God if you're in this depressed state what are you doing there Jesus never purchased just depression for you Jesus never purchased sadness for you and gave you sadness as part of your inheritance as a believer what are you doing here so sad so just but I've failed him I've messed up joined the crowd our church this morning has hundreds and hundreds of people in it who's failed him who's messed up who's let him down who's let down their friends their family well anybody here besides me down there so what do a style here Philip what do us thou here Greg what you notice brother Branham says it this way Elijah had a breakdown when he was under the juniper tree John had a breakdown in the prison he was a high-pitched Prophet them nerves on edge and his Eagle Eye filmed over little Elijah's heart was broke any Minister knows what Monday morning is after a hard day on Sunday compare that you Preachers Wives you know how your husband is on Monday morning after he's preached hard two or three times Sunday so worn out what do you think about Portillo Elijah there he was no one to comfort him and he stopped under this gender petrainian knelt down and he looked up to God and said Lord I'm so tired and so weary why don't you just take my life and let me go my father's all went so let me go men who deal in the Supernatural who stay on the presence of God and when you see God's program turned down and you preach it and you try your best and you do everything that God tells you to do and still they walk away from it it's heartbreaking it's heartbreaking he said a poor little fella skinny laying there gray hair hanging over his shoulder God said my servant needs some rest God's mercy to his servant he just laid him down on a bunch of weeds and he went to sleep I'd imagine there was 10 000 angels watching him sleep there was one Assurance a Believer has though the world turned him down yet God loves him the world may call you a Holy Roller they may call you fanatic but if you're true to God there's one sure thing God loves you and his angels are encamped about those who fear Him oh Hallelujah I'd imagine on every limb all around to the place of swarms of angels and God came down and said not poor little tired servant he's so nervous and so tore up he don't know what to do I want to pick out the angel here that's got the softest hands don't you scare him Hallelujah walk over and stroke his brow write easy and I want the best cook among you you go up there and get all the vitamins you can find and put in this corn meal the world's turned him down oh my but I'm going to treat him right Hallelujah that means praise our God don't get scared of that bring forth the best that we got to cook him a corn cake and set him down some water and this soft handed Angel went over and stroked a little servant of God on the brow remember if you've done your best God's still got those angels in order he loves you just the same as he loved Elijah now either we believe that statement or we don't I choose to believe it I believe God loves me just as much as he did Elijah I believe God loves you but brother Donnie I failed him and so did Elijah and so have I and so did Moses and so did Peter and so did every other person that's ever served him you're going to fall and make mistakes and fall short of the glory of God but the question is what are you going to do when you mess up you're going to lay down there and wallow in yourself pity or are you gonna rise and say Lord forgive me and try me one more time Lord forgive me for my mistakes forgive me for my failures try me once more Lord try me Elijah rubbing his eyes raising up his little frail shaking hands take a hold of the bread needed just the great Angelic choir come down and formed a little panoramic around him like that and begin to sing the Psalms like no mother could cool her baby to sleep let him seep again the father turned around and said you know I love him so much and the Journey's great he's got a lot to go through yet I'm not through with him so I must feed him again so he called the angels and dumped in another big bundle of vitamins I believe God still got that bundle of vitamins today don't you and cooked up another corn cake and set him a cruise of water and stroked his brow and fed him again I'm so glad that there is a juniper tree when we get all war and tore up we can go under that juniper tree and find spiritual vitamins to travel any kind of trip so let me tell you something if you're facing a juniper tree today of a sickness or a disease or a bad diagnosis from the doctor maybe God's got a juniper tree for you and he wants to have an angel of God a messenger a pastor or an evangelist amen that's God's Messengers in this day to cook up a message with your name wrote all over it and it will be a little bit of vitamin C for Christ and a little bit of vitamin A for Alpha and a little bit of vitamin B for born again a little bit of vitamin D for deity a little bit of vitamin E for everything you need a little bit of vitamin A for he is your first a little bit of vitamin G for he is your god a little bit of vitamin H for him a little bit of vitamin I for you and I together a little bit of vitamin K for Jesus a little bit of vitamin K for I know he's going to see me through a little bit of vitamin L for life a little bit of vitamin M for my mama and a little bit of vitamin D in for new new my strength is going to be renewed in the presence of God he's got every vitamin you need in his Divine alphabet to give you the strength for your journey if you're facing a journey with cancer he's got the strength for your journey he's got the vitamins for your depression ah oh you say I wish I had a corn cake like that you do God provided the corn for us to have a corn cake as a matter of fact when the corn was on the earth he said this in Saint John 12 23. Jesus answered them saying they always come that the son of man shall be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die to bite us alone but if it die it bringeth Force much fruit Hallelujah God had everything we would ever need packed in that corn Jesus Christ and he was ground out under the Roman birth and released the healing power the saving power the delivering power for whatever you need right here in this building today those of you that are streaming the service around the world if you're in New Zealand if you're in Australia you're in Africa you're in Greenland you're in Iceland you're in Norway you're in France wherever you are right there you can believe God the healing virtue can go right to you as you're streaming on your phone or streaming on your computer why because he is the same yesterday today and forever and God has provided a corn cake for his people so if you're a thief's facing depression today you can be able to stand and say by the grace of God I'm gonna eat my way through this depression I'm going to eat my way out of this trial of sickness and disease and trouble I'm going to eat God's provided corn cake for the hour and I'm on a drink of the Waters of Life freely [Applause] look at what David said in Psalm 61 1. to the chief musician upon Nagina a Psalm of David You're My Cry Oh God attend unto my prayer from the end of the Earth While I Cry unto thee when my heart this overwhelmed and the word overwhelmed means to turn aside to envelop oneself to be feeble faint or grow weak when my heart is overwhelmed Or Glory somebody Lead Me To The Rock that is higher than ours you notice David didn't say get that by himself hey but he said lead me if I may know sometimes we need to be led sometimes we just gets so weak and so feeble that we don't know what to do and we thank God I don't know I don't know a way out of this situation I don't know what to do I've done everything I know to do and seem like everything I've tried to do has been a failure well somebody lead me out of this place and let me tell you today God don't just use preachers to leave those weak and sick among us sometimes a word from a lay member just an encouraging text and encouraging something on Instagram if you're going to use social media why don't you use it for the benefit and the glory of God instead of a place to hang out your dirty laundry and the trash of your family and all the things that people are going through come on now use it for the glory of God let people know you're a Christian let people know you don't delve and the garbage of this world but you're going to use every means available to witness to somebody about not only this saving power but they encouraging power use your Instagram account as a way to share a corn cake use your Facebook as a way to share a piece of corn cake it might be somebody's sad I'm the problem somebody would preach with me this morning and they are depressed and they are weary use your Facebook as something that will say I'm here to help you I'm here to pray with you I'm here to lead you to that rock that is bigger than you are that is higher than you [Applause] foreign oh David goes on to say for thou has been a shelter for me and the Strong Tower from the enemy I will abide in thy Tabernacle forever I will trust in the comfort of thy wings Salah Psalms 142 2 I poured out my complaint before him I showed him before him I so notice I showed before him my trouble when my spirit was overwhelmed Within Me then thou knowest my path in the way we're in I walked have they privately laid a snare for me I looked on my right hand and beheld and there was no man that would know me Refuge failed me no man cared for my soul I mean it's ever been there oh it's one thing I love about the Psalms they are more one the most powerful books in the Bible as far as victory but when it comes down to just relating to humanity and the things you go through you know some preachers preach Christianity as if though you should never have a trial that's a line preacher a preacher that tells you you're going to be on the Mountaintop all the time it's not telling you the Full Gospel I'm telling you you're going to fight Devils you're going to fight hell you're going to fight disease you're going to fight trouble but the good thing about it is you can win amen you can win by the grace of God you're not going to get a reward if you don't fight and we must fight greater than ever before all hell has broke loose against the people of the last day we can feel it out on the world I just heard it this week on the news that they are so alarmed the psychiatrists and psychologists because the increase of mental illness and sickness has attacked the Young Generation and there's an increase of over one-third compared to what it was two years ago and the doctors are so concerned because suicide has raised but I rebuke that suicide devil from amongst our people in the name of Jesus take your leave from the saints of God we have everything to live for we have everything to fight for we're not survivors but we are more than conquerors than him who gave himself for us we have a corn cake called Christ Jesus and we will win there is oh Hallelujah there is no devil that can defeat us oh Hallelujah [Applause] ah foreign I said Thou Art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living attend unto My Cry for I am brought very low deliver me from my persecutors for they are stronger than I bring my soul out of prison that I may praise thy name the righteous shall Compass me about now watch his Faith's confession you see some people still struggle and trying to understand the balance of talking Faith talk and they seek that if you say well how you doing I'm good I'm fine everything's well that's your faith and language but is there anything wrong with telling them when you get in pain look what you remember I'm sick today I need help I I need prayer today people are afraid to even request prayer on such things because they think they're that's a negative testimony that's not a negative testimony your testimony is by his stripes I'm Healed but I need a little bit of help to get from point A to point B I'm dragging my leg I'm a little bit sad I'm a little bit depressed would you pray for me but what's your confession My Confession is by Stripes I'm already healed My Confession is I am more than a caucus of him that loved him or Hallelujah I am more I'm going to come right out of this Valley and I'm going to lift my hands and praise the Lord but until the manifestation hits me would you pray for me hallelujah hallelujah oh but David says I will be compassed by the righteous I may be feeling low today I may be hungry I may be weary I may be shaken under the juniper tree but I ain't going to stay here alone because Mount Horeb is calling me you remember what Mount Horeb was it's what almighty God met Moses and my whole Hallelujah Elijah had that inkling if he could go back to where the Prophet had his experience maybe he could have his I don't want to point you today to this fine building I don't want to point you to some organization somewhere I want to point you to the man Christ Jesus who come to set you free from a life full of sin go there and have an experience with God and their Devils will bow to the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] Psalm 143 verse 3. for the enemy hath persecuted my soul he have smitten my life down to the ground he hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have long been long dead therefore is my spirit notice what David keeps saying his spirit his Spirit remember what we're dealing with this extended series on Bathsheba all that she must have took with her to the Palace all the trauma all the fear all the bad memories of an adultery all the bad memories of her husband being killed by the man who is now her husband David you imagine trying to fall in love with a man that killed your husband now if you didn't like her husband you might thank him but it's evidence she was in love with him and he was in love with her and then you have to marry the king and you got to fall in love with him wow therefore it's my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate I remember the days of old I meditate on all thy works I Muse on the work of thy hands let me close with this the prophet says that this way we're living in an erotic age if you said this in May of 1962 what would he say in February of 2023. we're living in a neurotic age nervous tension everybody's racing here and there and going there and going nowhere ain't that the truth they will run slap dab over you if you're you know how many ever seconds slow in front of them and what they do is they wow like that and get to the stoplight three seconds before you do which means they get to set they're three seconds longer than you do and they hurried down to the stoplight so they could get there but they feel better because they beat you and they got around you well come on now don't sit there and look at me which are you all the slowpokes are the ones who go around and beat them to the traffic light okay all right we'll not ask that but what does it create a nervous tension people are so nervous they're living you know how it is they're living it's such a thing you pull out in front of somebody I mean they'll shake their fist at you they'll do this and that and the other you get a parking spot at Walmart and somebody else saw it they was on the other side of the parking lot but they wanted that and you're right here and get it they still think you ought to give that to them and yet they'll walk three miles in their neighborhood in the evening for exercise I'm talking about a people that are out of their mind why don't you take part of that exercise and at Walmart it's that kind of an age he said and I know this church has plagued with it as everywhere else the Tabernacle this plate you what the Tabernacle or the prophet of God pastored you mean Elijah's Ministry could not keep nervous tension off of his own church hello Ma it's a day of pressure hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry somebody needs to write a song hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry up and wait drop 90 miles an hour to get home for supper and then wait two hours for it to get ready in that rushing and speeding it gets you to a nervous tension the wives say something a little contrary and you want to fly off temper husband say something you patch your foot and tell him to get in the room or something this is for some of these people to stream the services of course uh-huh now husband I don't want no words with you get out of here oh my God wife oh I'm so nervous wow what's the matter all this together this tension is building up then the results of it is doing something wrong and acting out of place nobody raise your hands don't bat an eye don't move I wonder how many of us are guilty of this tension pressure and you say something to your wife to your husband to your children to your friends y'all done good you can say Amen now so does it make us do something wrong now how many honest people how much ever got under attention and said something you would to God you'd never said wish you would have never acted in such a way yes so you know what we need friends I think I figured out the recipe of what we need to help us deal with tension we need to eat more corn cakes we need to feed more on Christ the word oh my goodness he says it'll make the poor act that way the middle class sacked that way the rich act that way it'll make the wrong act that way it'll make the pretty good act that way that sounds like to me he's covering everybody it'll make the the good act that way because it's tension steam built up got to blow it out somewhere if you don't you'll blow the boiler up and you'll find it builds up as the day goes and you talk to your boss if you're working also and so on you speak to the kid to come in here Mom if you're here oh it builds up oh my you feel like you're gonna the head's gonna come off I know I'm with it every day I know what it means it builds up now you see your hot water heater unless you have on the instant type if you have the one with the tank it has what is called a pop-off valve comes out either at the top or at the bottom depends on which type of water here it is brother Mike could come tell us and explain it to us about how it works better than I could but it's in case the thermostat gets stuck on the inside if I understand it right and it don't turn itself off and it's just sitting there heating oh okay now my search rocks me I tell one thing I wanted that certain sheet sitting right up there and who's sitting in that seat one of them little smarter like boys don't they know why I have a hard time hearing don't they know I wanted that seat so bad I can't understand it I'll tell you one thing I'm going to quit the church if I don't get that table I know you may have your favorite pick of a seat but you ought to be so happy to be in this place if you had to sit in the floor you'd say thank God we're not in the holiday yet you didn't have my seat no takers huh I meant this one not here if we want to love God and go to church we ought to be so happy I'll tell you I don't like them lights what do you think about them panel I don't think I'm going back because I don't want them panels I don't I just we ought to be so happy to be in the house of God that we say Lord have mercy do you notice this I've never even noticed I'm so happy I just are grateful to have our own church back I was just so happy to be in the house of God did you notice it nope didn't notice it what I noticed was that word in the presence of God and the singing the Clapping the hand glory to God I'm so happy I'm so God well I just believe I'll fulfill what David said happy is the people whose God is the Lord I'm going to go and I'm going to clap my hands all you people I'm on a shout by the voice of Triumph I'm going to praise him I'm going to bless his name I'm just happy to be in church or You're Building pressure well all our hope is I'm not around when you blow look friends from the rich to the poor everyone it crosses every racial barrier every cultural barrier everybody is under pressure America the Great great nation of America and we just allowed a Chinese balloon to fly across our military spots our silos and Montana uh-huh we're great aren't we can't you see it our nation is weakening our image before the world is weakening why would they do that they wouldn't dare do that on certain presidents we've had before they certainly wouldn't have done that on one of my favorite Mr Ronald Reagan uh-huh you imagine them send nothing over Ronnie oh Ronnie would have took care of them Hollywood style he'd have blowed them Plum to Smithereens but what does it do it's a weakness everywhere and what's it create more pressure for us hey we ain't got access to them bombs thank God we don't we we're trusting our government to take care of us well I don't mind telling you I don't feel too comfortable with the job they're doing well come on now what's it do it creates more pressure I'm glad my trust is not in our president I'm glad our trust is not in the army or the defense or the Congress or the Senate my trust is in the Lord God Almighty my confidence is in him I found a place where we can relieve the pressure in Christ Jesus let me read one more to you I look at the world today what attention the whole world lives in and you go down the street and it's not even safe to drive this is 1964. not even safe to drive it's not even safe to be on a four-lane highway everybody's at attention snapping what's the matter quieten down where are you going what was it's making the world insane and the incident insane institutions are filling up that's what's the church in such a turmoil they're so they're so head bound on a certain thing they won't stop and consider God's word in the hour We're living all under a strain tension listen the church age book in the thyatitis are changed each age had its pressures for example a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in did that say it or not an age like we live in soft living nervous tension in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in every day we're here it seems less Like Home to me I want to be ready to leave you see the precious building greater and greater and greater and one of these days we're going to be squeezed right out because the pressure will come and the squeeze will come against us and we leave this place in a moment in the twinkling of an eye this barriers if you have praise the Lord Jesus I'm wondering before we pray today how many of you would like to be remembered maybe you're just feeling such pressure such strength maybe you don't feel so much like Elijah the prophet but just a believer a housewife a husband a layperson that loves God and you feel so much pressure just of life every day living I can't imagine how the people who are the world leaders how they must feel they can feel it too but friends in spite of your failures don't you let the devil tell you there's no need to try anymore you've failed him you've let him down so many times why would he ever reach out to you again well I can answer that for you because he loves you so much he loves you so much he loves you beyond your failures your mistakes your shortcomings Hallelujah pick up your pieces bring them to Jesus but brother Donnie I came well I'll tell you what then I'll make you an offer I'll help you pick them up if you can't call me if you can't come up and let me pray for you myself these other brothers many of these Saints in this building today will do everything we can to help you deal with the precious of life if I could I would take much of it off have you but the lord loves you more than that you see he loves you so much he knows that when you deal with pressure helps make you stronger I look at you as your pastor and I think oh God take it off of him please Lord but he sees what he's going to make out of you I mean let's be remembered today as we pray God bless each of you oh my goodness those of you out streaming the service those of you that'll archive it you just raise your hand though where you are as well Heavenly Father we more than likely cannot relate to exactly the scope of the pressure that Elijah felt because we don't have that office and that responsibility that he had but each of us in our own calling in her own position we can relate maybe the person here today that would feel like they are the least Among Us they feel like they're the most insignificant person that you ever saved but if they could only believe you love them just as much as you did Elijah you don't love Moses any better than you love me you don't love Peter James or John anymore than you love me and you love Peter so much when he messed up terribly denied you in his strength he felt like he could stand but it turned against him and he was so weak imagine he must have felt so embarrassed and so ashamed how could he ever face you again how could he ever face the rest of the disciples that never think the same about him that always talk about him behind his back say he was a coward but in spite of all of that you loved him so much you sent word Hallelujah tell my disciples and Peter that I have risen from the dead Hallelujah you knew me but struggle you knew he would have a hard time so you called him by name oh Jesus would you do something similar here today father in the name of Jesus Christ May the spirit of God deal with everyone here today who needs this strength this courage Lord We Worship You Lord God
