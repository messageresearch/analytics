[19:55] brother Gary's thanking me for knowing
[19:57] what Kia sing is in which I don't
[19:59] [Laughter]
[20:02] I've did it a couple times lately and be
[20:04] honest I don't remember what key what
[20:06] the key was
[20:07] [Music]
[20:13] but I'm so glad
[20:17] that this voice that speaks to you is a
[20:19] piece of Kentucky
[20:23] dirt and I am such a blessed piece of
[20:26] Kentucky dirt
[20:29] because in my
[20:30] soul is a thought that came from
[20:34] eternity
[20:36] that's somehow
[20:39] someday is going to get to be in
[20:42] eternity with a body from this Earth and
[20:44] I don't know if it's any chemicals
[20:46] elements left of this 16 elements that
[20:48] came from Kentucky but today as a
[20:52] hillbilly I'm a very blessed man I feel
[20:56] like on the back
[21:00] bony of
[21:03] space step to
[21:07] pure and
[21:09] holy
[21:12] God and an
[21:15] awesome
[21:17] Solitude he
[21:19] stood
[21:23] alone I think I messed up let's do it
[21:25] inde D Brothers
[21:29] I'm
[21:30] sorry on a
[21:34] balcony of
[21:37] space step to
[21:41] pure and
[21:43] holy
[21:45] God and in
[21:49] awesome
[21:51] Solitude he
[21:53] stood alone
[21:59] not one faint
[22:02] star to give him
[22:06] light just endless
[22:11] rolling Blackest
[22:15] Night but
[22:17] somehow through all the
[22:21] darkness he could see
[22:29] he saw
[22:31] mountains high and
[22:35] lofty he saw
[22:38] vales Lush and
[22:42] green babbling Brooks and wild flowers
[22:48] growing even
[22:51] heard a robin
[22:56] sing but he fell
[22:59] to
[23:00] strange
[23:02] compassion as close to
[23:06] love as pain could
[23:10] be standing out there
[23:15] in
[23:19] tomorrow
[23:21] he
[23:23] saw me
[23:29] he saw
[23:32] me
[23:33] in his
[23:36] likeness he saw
[23:40] me like
[23:44] him
[23:46] Pure
[23:47] Clean and
[23:51] holy spotless
[23:55] white Within
[23:59] but he saw me
[24:03] Bound in heavy
[24:05] chains and
[24:08] long to set me
[24:13] free but he
[24:15] knew if
[24:18] I
[24:20] became like
[24:22] him
[24:24] he
[24:26] must become like
[24:29] like

[27:08] SM
[27:12] Hallelujah dear God through the
[27:14] ceaseless
[27:16] ages we will be praising you for
[27:20] that we've seen many miracles that
[27:23] you've done you healed
[27:26] cancer straight out crooked
[27:30] eyes fixed torn up
[27:34] marriages but I wonder if we realize yet
[27:36] to this day one of the greatest Miracles
[27:41] we will
[27:42] see is a sinner
[27:45] Changed by the power of
[27:48] God thank you Lord we love you so much
[27:53] thank you for your Miracle working power
[27:56] in us today Lord Jesus
[27:59] speak to us from your word father we ask
[28:02] in the name of
[28:05] Jesus praise the
[28:07] Lord isn't he
[28:10] wonderful praise
[28:13] God well if you're changed today by his
[28:16] power you are a miracle
[28:19] yourself amen truly to think of what God
[28:23] can do to be able to transform sinners
[28:28] and change them into accepted people in
[28:32] God's presence it's a wonderful
[28:35] thing turn with me to Luke chapter 9
[28:38] verse 23 if you would today I've got a
[28:40] few
[28:42] announcements question answers again on
[28:44] Thursday um
[28:46] 7:00 and also we've been trying to plan
[28:50] for a a communion service here in our
[28:53] new place and um we're looking at June
[28:57] the 1st which will be on a Saturday
[29:00] night we'll probably start the service
[29:04] maybe about 6:00 so we can be able to
[29:07] have service and then communion and then
[29:10] everybody be back for Sunday and I've
[29:12] asked brother Daryl if you'll preach for
[29:14] us on that service that'll be June the
[29:17] 1st also of course I'd like to wish all
[29:20] the mothers of Happy Happy Mother's Day
[29:24] to each one of your mothers God bless
[29:26] you thank you for your your of sacrifice
[29:29] and raising your children and trying to
[29:32] influence them in a in a Godly
[29:36] way I've been speaking to you on the the
[29:38] bride's Bill of Rights and um I want to
[29:42] speak to you today on another one of
[29:43] those rights and it's the right to
[29:48] Die
[29:50] daily the right to Die
[29:54] daily I'm not sure if you understand it
[29:56] yet or not but actually the right to Die
[30:01] daily is such an awesome
[30:04] right because you realize everybody out
[30:07] here cannot do that there's only one
[30:10] class of people that can actually Die
[30:15] daily that's those who've already
[30:18] died and then were raised in a new
[30:24] body something in their soul quickened
[30:27] and there's another man or woman inside
[30:29] of you we can't see it now but there's
[30:33] someone inside of us that's being formed
[30:36] as we're feeding on the word it's like a
[30:39] body and a body it's a soul and a
[30:43] body and as you're feeding and maturing
[30:46] on the word that something inside of you
[30:50] is growing started from a little thing
[30:52] about the size of a button on your shirt
[30:55] growing into what God wants to be that's
[30:59] an awesome thing a
[31:00] it Luke 9:
[31:04] 23 and he said to them all if any man
[31:08] will come after
[31:10] me let him deny
[31:14] himself and take up his cross How
[31:19] often
[31:20] daily and follow
[31:23] me so each one must deny himself that is
[31:27] not think about about his own good well
[31:30] I like I want this is the way my life's
[31:33] going to be I choose I want I decide I
[31:36] this that but he must take up his cross
[31:40] him or her daily and follow the lord
[31:43] Jesus you say but brother Donnie what
[31:45] all does that involve really it's quite
[31:47] simple it's not complicated at all it is
[31:50] that you
[31:51] admit that the one who has called you
[31:55] and what he allows you to go through and
[31:57] what
[31:59] allows you to be Tried by that you'll
[32:02] take that cross on a daily basis and
[32:05] admit that he is right and letting you
[32:08] bear
[32:09] it it may change from one day to the
[32:12] other but if you have that attitude no
[32:14] matter what you face you'll always be
[32:17] bearing a cross and we must follow Jesus
[32:21] unto death which in this case is daily
[32:24] death for whosoever will save his
[32:29] life shall lose it and you realize this
[32:32] is where the leodan church is doing
[32:35] every day they're saving their life
[32:40] preserving their desires their Ambitions
[32:43] their
[32:44] goals they preserve it so Jesus says
[32:47] whosoever shall will save his life shall
[32:50] lose it but whosoever will lose his life
[32:55] for my sake in other words you give it
[32:57] up for him
[32:58] him the same shall save it it's actually
[33:03] odd people look at us and think y'all
[33:06] are losing so much actually we're saving
[33:10] so
[33:12] much and they think they're saving so
[33:15] much but they're actually losing so much
[33:17] so you actually save by
[33:20] loss and you lose by
[33:24] saving a't that
[33:26] peculiar you see this is why it's so odd
[33:29] even today among Christian
[33:31] churches whosoever will save his life
[33:33] shall lose it but whosoever will lose
[33:36] his life for my sake the same shall save
[33:39] it now we're not talking about being a
[33:40] martyr now Jesus is not talking about
[33:43] going to Mar them he just set up this
[33:45] precedent that you will give yourself
[33:48] every day on your cross so every day you
[33:52] give that you're saving your life for
[33:55] what is a man advant aged if he gained
[33:59] the whole
[34:01] world and
[34:03] lose
[34:07] himself lose himself so a life lived for
[34:12] self is an absolute guarantee you will
[34:18] lose
[34:21] yourself there's only one way to make
[34:23] sure that we won't be lost and that is
[34:26] we commit our life into the only one who
[34:29] can save us amen and may want that with
[34:32] all your heart can we just pray together
[34:34] again over the word and I've got some
[34:37] prayer calls here that the Lord knows
[34:40] what they what they need father once
[34:43] again we bow our heads before we begin
[34:46] to speak and I pray that you would take
[34:49] each of our hearts today make our hearts
[34:52] fertile ground Lord that the word seed
[34:55] can be able to go down deep and bring
[34:58] forth an abundance of the crop of the
[35:01] end time we believe we have the moisture
[35:05] the Holy Spirit we believe we have the
[35:07] seed which is the word we believe we
[35:09] have the light which is the light
[35:11] shining in the last days so there's no
[35:14] reason that it will not produce a great
[35:17] crop that'll be pleasing to you all the
[35:20] elements are here if we can just obey
[35:23] them in the right way father you see
[35:26] these prayer calls Lord you know these
[35:28] needs I'm asking you in the name of
[35:30] Jesus be mindful of them Father help me
[35:33] today Lord to be able to get out of the
[35:35] way speak to each one of our hearts we
[35:38] ask in the name of Jesus and the Saints
[35:41] said amen God bless you you may be
[35:49] seated I've got it be honest there's an
[35:51] ele element about the soul which I find
[35:56] mysterious
[35:59] we've never seen our souls of course and
[36:02] we've never seen our spirit all we've
[36:04] known about each other is is the body
[36:08] that's what we Conta but yet we also can
[36:11] see by the attributes of the life that's
[36:13] in every one of us that there's
[36:16] something there that influences us
[36:19] something that sets us in a certain
[36:22] pattern in a certain way we believe it's
[36:25] a supernatural element which of course
[36:27] we call the soul when we were born into
[36:31] this world we were born with a lost soul
[36:35] as we say it a nature which was not
[36:39] regenerated a nature which God never
[36:42] intended for us to have what Adam did
[36:46] that day whenever he forfeited his
[36:48] rights he also forfeited yours your
[36:52] right to health you were supposed to
[36:55] have the right to live in the Garden of
[36:56] Eden
[36:58] never have one gray hair in your head
[37:01] none of us would ever experience deaths
[37:04] sickness pain sorrow so when Adam
[37:08] forfeited his right he forfeited mine he
[37:12] forfeited yours so there must be a
[37:15] second Adam that will come and reconcile
[37:20] us back into the presence of God and yet
[37:23] when we're born from that time on the
[37:26] first two B boys born outside the garden
[37:31] gate there was a need to come before the
[37:35] presence of God to try to make peace to
[37:39] make
[37:40] reconciliation to where you could be
[37:42] accepted in his presence we just been
[37:45] looking at at both Cain and Abel and how
[37:47] that one was right and the other one
[37:49] wasn't and since that time man is still
[37:53] on this Quest this search to all the
[37:56] religions are in the world today so a
[38:00] Founder gets some sort of idea that he
[38:03] feels like this would be the right way
[38:06] so you've got to find the proper zen zen
[38:11] so you've got to be able to find the
[38:13] right Zen or you've got to get into the
[38:17] the thing of meditation and you begin to
[38:20] get in so far and you know you let go of
[38:24] this and you let go of that if I did
[38:26] that long I'd be asleep myself I don't
[38:28] know about you uh but but the reason
[38:32] that all of these religions they're out
[38:34] there is because there's something in
[38:36] man that he's searching for something
[38:40] and I hope you understand that actually
[38:42] the soul of man that's lost tends to be
[38:46] religious so it even though he's lost it
[38:49] doesn't mean that he doesn't have an
[38:51] inclination towards some sort of
[38:54] religion but most of them will will
[38:57] accept something that is contrary of
[39:00] course to God's way of
[39:02] reconciliation and God's way is that the
[39:05] the nature that we were born with must
[39:09] be changed the soul has to be
[39:13] different and how will that Soul ever be
[39:17] different what can God do to ever bring
[39:20] that sinful nature to a spot now for
[39:23] some even in
[39:25] Christianity they believe
[39:28] that that nature then will come to God
[39:32] and you will repent and you will go to
[39:35] an alter maybe come and shake the
[39:37] preacher's hand and God will go inside
[39:40] of you and God will change that soul
[39:46] that soul will be different it'll be the
[39:49] same one but somehow you went in to that
[39:53] presence of God and you come out a
[39:55] different person changed and then you
[39:59] will struggle basically the rest of your
[40:01] life to try to please God you'll fall
[40:06] you'll make mistakes of course the way
[40:08] most of them preach it you cannot live
[40:10] above sin ever live above it but is that
[40:14] really
[40:16] true is that really God's way of looking
[40:19] at it or is that man's way of looking at
[40:22] it so is the sinful nature actually
[40:27] brought into the presence of God and
[40:30] then the sinful nature is somehow
[40:33] changed and then that's what we
[40:36] classify as the new birth but is that
[40:40] really the
[40:41] truth
[40:43] or is there to be a
[40:47] death an absolute death yes sir and an
[40:54] Annihilation and then there will be some
[40:57] something
[40:58] reborn but will it be that old
[41:03] nature or will it be something that
[41:06] father himself
[41:08] deposited there which Mom and Daddy of
[41:11] course couldn't give you the sinful
[41:14] nature can only die once but to the
[41:20] flesh We Must Die daily amen I I believe
[41:25] that even for some of you you that are
[41:27] truly born again and filled with the
[41:29] Holy Ghost there's something in you that
[41:32] longs every day that you're on this
[41:35] Earth no matter how close you are to God
[41:37] and how much Holy Ghost you've got it's
[41:39] like there's something in you you're
[41:41] never satisfied with what you've got how
[41:44] many feels that way and if you're not
[41:46] careful the devil will try to convince
[41:49] you when you hear somebody preaching
[41:51] about the Holy Ghost and the token and
[41:53] you know you want to make sure that
[41:55] you've got it if you're not careful the
[41:57] devil will try to convince you that you
[41:59] don't have it because there's a longing
[42:02] in you but it's not that you're longing
[42:05] to be born you're longing for more of
[42:09] the payments of what he gave you
[42:12] initially and Satan will convince many
[42:16] people and if he can do that it stops us
[42:19] from coming to the fullness of our
[42:22] position read with me if you would here
[42:24] in the in the Hebrews where the prophet
[42:27] deals with this about the nature and he
[42:29] said your old nature died the nature of
[42:34] the world and you become a new creation
[42:38] and your desires that old life that had
[42:41] a beginning when God breathe the breath
[42:44] of life into your nostrils when you were
[42:47] born now listen to what happened when
[42:49] you were born so that old life that had
[42:52] a beginning when God breathes the breast
[42:56] of life into your no so that old nature
[42:59] had a beginning so when God breathes a
[43:01] breath of life into every one of us then
[43:04] that old nature had a
[43:08] beginning and it had an
[43:12] end Now list at the difference the way a
[43:15] prophet
[43:16] preaches the new
[43:18] birth than the way most Christians
[43:21] believe
[43:23] it that we were born when we took the
[43:26] breath of life is just a small small
[43:31] infant the Midwife the doctor spanked
[43:36] you and you took the Breath of Life God
[43:39] gave you the breath of
[43:42] life then that nature that was there had
[43:47] a
[43:48] beginning but it must also have an end
[43:52] now he says and it died and was done
[43:56] away away
[43:58] with forever so that old
[44:01] nature is not born
[44:09] again you see if Satan can't stop you
[44:12] from believing in the new births he'll
[44:15] try to mess up your perception of what
[44:18] it truly
[44:19] is and then you will come and you'll say
[44:22] well I I I'll give God this and then God
[44:25] will take it and and God will reverse
[44:29] that the the nature will be more like a
[44:32] it'll be like a
[44:34] phoenix that will happen to that own
[44:38] nature and that's why people keep on
[44:41] sinning after they say they're born
[44:45] again because actually that old nature
[44:49] never
[44:50] died but they did quit doing some things
[44:54] and they started maybe going to church
[44:56] they started reading the Bible which
[44:58] they' never done before maybe they had
[45:01] some religious inclinations and things
[45:04] they started doing but I want you to
[45:06] notice how a prophet brings this now so
[45:10] when God breathed into the breaths of
[45:12] life into your Noles when you were born
[45:14] that life of that carnal nature died it
[45:18] had a beginning and it had an end and it
[45:21] died and was done away with forever
[45:27] the old
[45:28] nature and God came
[45:31] in with the new
[45:36] nature so notice in the old nature dies
[45:41] and God comes in with a new
[45:46] nature now with
[45:49] everybody that says they are a Christian
[45:53] and said they were born again if this
[45:57] happened to them how could they ever go
[46:01] back to a life of sin amen Carol and I
[46:06] were talking just this week about about
[46:10] the conditions of time and what a state
[46:12] the world is in and what a state that
[46:15] many so-called Christians are in and
[46:19] while we were talking about it the
[46:23] spirit of God just moved right over me
[46:26] while while we were
[46:29] there and he spoke these words out of my
[46:35] mouth it overwhelmed me when it
[46:38] happened and I told her I
[46:41] said what the majority of people
[46:44] are is they are
[46:48] christless
[46:52] Christians remember
[46:54] car christless
[46:58] brother Jim it just about overwhelmed
[47:02] me christless Christians what a
[47:06] deception that a person would be a
[47:12] christless Christian yes so what are
[47:15] they Christian by
[47:18] name and by
[47:21] title I want you to listen now how the
[47:25] prophet when he goes in into this and he
[47:27] said it died and was done away with
[47:30] forever that on nature and God came in
[47:34] with the new nature again he says every
[47:38] man's got to be born again this sinful
[47:42] nature
[47:45] killed in
[47:47] him I want you to listen to this new
[47:49] birth blue John and a new man born in
[47:55] him
[47:58] which is Christ Jesus am the Son of
[48:05] God now you see this new
[48:08] birth is a Christ
[48:12] full
[48:13] Christian not a
[48:16] christless
[48:18] Christian so look what Satan wants to do
[48:21] he wants to convince people then they
[48:22] give their life to the Lord the Lord
[48:24] comes in modifies changes red does you
[48:28] know refurbishes that old nature can you
[48:31] see why he would want them to have that
[48:35] instead of
[48:37] this so you get modified a little you
[48:40] get changed a little you get religious
[48:44] you get you know something that actually
[48:47] makes you a better person and you go to
[48:50] feeling better and you think wow I I'm
[48:52] really different this is
[48:54] awesome and you think that's what What
[48:56] It Takes no Satan is deceiving
[49:02] Millions by change happening to them
[49:05] which they
[49:06] think is a new
[49:08] Burst when actually the new birst is
[49:12] your own nature
[49:16] dying and the man Christ
[49:19] Jesus being born in
[49:22] you I don't care how good you would ever
[49:25] be you'll never be able to compare to
[49:29] Christ Jesus in you no matter how good
[49:32] I'd ever be any of us we are lost and
[49:35] were born with that poor decrepit nature
[49:38] is that right now listen this to me I I
[49:42] just find this so awesome every man's
[49:44] got to be born again this sinful nature
[49:47] killed in him and a new man born in him
[49:54] which is Christ Jesus
[49:56] the Son of
[49:59] God then you surrender yourself
[50:04] completely to
[50:06] Christ Christ comes
[50:09] in and
[50:11] writes a book of
[50:14] Acts through
[50:18] you if is that awesome or what praise
[50:23] God it ain't no wonder that don't want
[50:27] this to happen it's no wonder that he
[50:31] wants to mess with theologians thinking
[50:35] and they would preach the new birth in
[50:38] an opposite way from what I just read to
[50:41] you because what will it produce in the
[50:45] majority it will produce
[50:48] christless
[50:51] Christians but if we can come by this
[50:55] process here that then every man that is
[50:58] born in order to be born again his old
[51:02] nature the sinful nature the prophet
[51:04] said killed in him and a new man born in
[51:08] him which is Christ Jesus notice again
[51:13] he says and you must be born again our
[51:16] nature to begin with is sinful to start
[51:20] with we're no good can anybody say Amen
[51:23] to that we are no good question and
[51:26] answers
[51:28] 1961 so the
[51:30] soul is the
[51:32] nature of your
[51:35] spirit now notice what you were when you
[51:39] were born so your soul was the nature
[51:43] that was on your spirit so you got a
[51:47] soul a spirit and a body first you were
[51:51] mean and evil and hatred and Malice and
[51:55] strife now now you're loving sweet kind
[52:01] see the
[52:02] difference it's your nature we could all
[52:08] call it that it's your soul that's been
[52:14] changed now listen carefully don't take
[52:17] the word change and go back to your
[52:20] concept of what you think the new birth
[52:24] is it's been changed change but notice
[52:28] how he
[52:29] describes what happened in the
[52:32] change the old
[52:35] soul
[52:40] died so it got changed not that the old
[52:46] nature was changed into the new right
[52:50] amen but it died and God put his soul
[52:56] in you Chang it out not Chang it from
[53:02] Lost to save not change it from bad to
[53:06] good but got rid of it he changed it and
[53:10] put himself inside
[53:13] of praise be to God the old soul died I
[53:20] know people get scared to death and you
[53:22] go to reading this quot look when God
[53:23] called me to preach this message he
[53:25] called me to PR preach at all I'm not
[53:27] afraid of none of these quotes I'm not
[53:30] scared because people went this way and
[53:32] went that way and that way that's only a
[53:35] scarecrow to keep you an eye away from
[53:37] the
[53:39] truths that's right scarecrow shouldn't
[53:43] work on Eagles just
[53:46] crows notice the old soul died and the
[53:51] new Soul which is the new nature
[53:57] Was
[53:58] Born Into You right the old soul died
[54:03] and the new Soul which is the new nature
[54:08] don't you understand what the new birth
[54:11] is the new birth is the new nature which
[54:15] is born in you that's your
[54:20] birth so your birth isn't I've done this
[54:23] and i' done that and you done that and
[54:25] you done that no not what you done
[54:28] anyway the birst Oh Glory to God the
[54:31] birst was him being born in us don't you
[54:36] to understand what the new birth is it's
[54:38] not while I run I jump I shouted I spoke
[54:41] in tongues you may do all of that but
[54:44] yet the new birth is him being born in
[54:49] you a
[54:51] new praise be to
[54:55] God the old soul died and the new Soul
[54:59] which is the new nature Was Born Into
[55:05] You Now whatever that happens in so how
[55:09] can we make sense out of what Jesus says
[55:12] in our opening scripture that we must
[55:15] take up our cross
[55:17] daily H how can we die once and then
[55:21] turn right around and have to die every
[55:24] day thereafter
[55:27] because once we are born again then that
[55:30] nature can never die again there is no
[55:34] resurrection and you know brother
[55:36] brandham said it several times ever he
[55:38] referred to it and said well you know
[55:40] brother brandham I had the Holy Ghost
[55:41] and I was born again and this and that
[55:43] but you know the the devil the devil
[55:45] made me to it made me do it he said no
[55:47] the devil didn't make you do it you just
[55:50] wasn't sealed
[55:51] in now let me tell you something now the
[55:54] devil can can not make a holy ghost feel
[55:59] child of God do one thing
[56:03] wrong never he does not have power over
[56:09] you the only way the devil can make you
[56:12] do things that are wrong is that you are
[56:16] demon
[56:19] possessed
[56:22] W brother Donnie what about my mistakes
[56:25] he don't make make you do them you
[56:28] choose to do them come on somebody say
[56:32] Amen once you and I are born again the
[56:36] devil has no more power over our soul
[56:42] because our soul is a gene of God and
[56:46] Christ himself is born a new in our own
[56:52] nature and he cannot make the Lord Jesus
[56:57] sin I wish somebody would preach with me
[57:00] this morning it's not you and I it's not
[57:04] our determination it's not our strength
[57:07] glory to God I grabbed a hold of the
[57:09] horns of the altar i' done this and i'
[57:12] done that oh come on you ain't nothing
[57:14] but a weakling you ain't nothing but a
[57:17] Lost Sinner when you come to God it
[57:19] wasn't you that grabbed a hold of the
[57:21] horns of the elders it's more like God
[57:23] grabbed a hold of your horns and Drug
[57:25] you up to the Altar and made you willing
[57:28] to die and when you were able to do that
[57:32] that old nature died right there and
[57:35] Christ Jesus was born again in
[57:45] you once that
[57:49] happens it is an
[57:52] impossibility for it to ever happen
[57:58] again don't you see what a miracle you
[58:01] are that are sitting here today that are
[58:03] truly born again you will never be able
[58:07] to be anything else other than born
[58:12] again no matter how old you get how how
[58:15] sick you get how many problems you have
[58:18] no matter what goes on you will never
[58:21] ever be able to revert back to being a
[58:24] sinner again because there is no more
[58:27] Fallen nature for you as a son or
[58:30] daughter of God and you all are looking
[58:32] for miracles why don't you look around
[58:34] at somebody you're looking at one look
[58:36] up this way you're looking at another
[58:39] I'm looking out here looking at hundreds
[58:41] of Miracles lives that have been changed
[58:43] of previous Sinners that's why I say
[58:46] well I'm just an old sinner saved by
[58:48] grace no I'm not I was an old sinner but
[58:51] I ain't one no more I am not a person
[58:54] that's living a life of sin come on
[58:56] children I don't believe we as Sons and
[58:59] Daughters of God had to live under the
[59:01] Dominion of the devil as a matter of
[59:04] fact I want to say to hell today I was
[59:07] born I was born ordained of God to
[59:10] torment the devil I was ordained of God
[59:13] to torment hell every son and daughter
[59:16] of God was ordained before the
[59:19] foundation of the world to be born again
[59:22] and you can never be anything else but
[59:25] born again
[59:27] think of it you can never be lost
[59:34] again
[59:40] Lord so we're
[59:43] dead but yet
[59:46] alive so the old nature is no longer
[59:50] there in Christ the new
[59:54] man the new man
[59:57] is not you made
[59:58] over it's not you sisters made over the
[1:00:02] new
[1:00:03] man is
[1:00:07] him watch this the prophet again says
[1:00:09] Abel died on this same altar his
[1:00:11] sacrificed lamb died and every believer
[1:00:15] that comes to Christ must die on the
[1:00:18] same altar with his dying lamb Christ
[1:00:20] and die in
[1:00:23] Christ to be a new creature
[1:00:26] die out to the things of the world and
[1:00:29] become Born Again a new creature in
[1:00:32] Christ Jesus die on the same altar of
[1:00:36] self
[1:00:38] sacrifice again he says what people need
[1:00:41] today is get back on that self
[1:00:45] sacrifice lay your all on the altar
[1:00:48] forget who you are but the Son of God or
[1:00:51] the daughter of God forget who you are
[1:00:55] but the son of God or the daughter of
[1:00:57] God forget who you are but the Son of
[1:01:00] God or the daughter of God we are too
[1:01:03] well aware of who we are in the Reagans
[1:01:07] we're too aware of who we are as a
[1:01:09] witson or an orff or a Smith or whatever
[1:01:12] your name is you need to lay the Reagan
[1:01:15] part aside you need to lay the Smith's
[1:01:17] part aside or whatever you are in the
[1:01:20] natural birst and realize I was a
[1:01:23] thought of God before I was ever a
[1:01:26] Reagan I'm only a Reagan temporarily
[1:01:29] that was the family he ordained me to be
[1:01:31] in in this life but before I was a
[1:01:34] Reagan I was a thought in the mind of
[1:01:37] God and when I leave this place I won't
[1:01:40] be a Reagan no more I will go back into
[1:01:44] that original creation he already has a
[1:01:48] body prepared for me Hallelujah I'll go
[1:01:51] back to my true and original family
[1:02:04] I want you to listen to this how he goes
[1:02:05] into this he says walk forward claim
[1:02:08] every promise God's got for
[1:02:10] you there will be a Revival that'll
[1:02:13] Shake New York like it never shook
[1:02:16] before men come back men and women come
[1:02:19] back to God come back to the place I
[1:02:21] don't mean come back to church I mean
[1:02:23] come back to God
[1:02:25] let every home come on start a
[1:02:32] Revival praise be to God our church is
[1:02:36] no stronger than the homes that make up
[1:02:38] our church our church is no more uh you
[1:02:42] know on on the the opes of God's
[1:02:44] presence and the H that make up this
[1:02:47] church because if we want Revival over
[1:02:49] brother da there ain't no Revival in the
[1:02:51] world I agree with you but that don't
[1:02:53] mean we can't have one a Word of Life
[1:02:55] well God ain't moving out yonder I agree
[1:02:57] he may not be doing a whole lot out
[1:02:59] yonder because of their unbelief but

[1:04:56] come it's individuals and it will be
[1:04:58] churches that believe it we're as
[1:05:00] divided as the denominations
[1:05:03] are I am not one to just be identified
[1:05:07] say well I'm a message believer all
[1:05:09] that's well and good I want to be a holy
[1:05:11] ghost F Sanctified on fire Son of God
[1:05:15] don't you I want our church yes we
[1:05:18] identified as a message church but I
[1:05:20] want more than the term I want more than
[1:05:23] the title I want the living
[1:05:29] god notice in Romans
[1:05:33] 6:4 Paul says therefore we're
[1:05:37] buried with him by
[1:05:41] baptism into
[1:05:43] death that like as Christ was raised
[1:05:46] from the dead by the glory of the
[1:05:49] father even so we also should walk in
[1:05:54] newness of life newness look at the
[1:05:58] meaning of the word in the new state of
[1:06:01] life and which the Holy Spirit places a
[1:06:05] soul as to produce a new
[1:06:09] state which is eternal
[1:06:13] life that's the newness thank you Lord
[1:06:16] of life for we if we have been planted
[1:06:20] together in the likeness of his death we
[1:06:25] shall also be also in the likess of his
[1:06:30] resurrection knowing this that our old
[1:06:36] man listen now our old man is
[1:06:42] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:06:47] might be destroyed that
[1:06:50] henceforth we should not serve sin amen
[1:06:55] amen oh so the old man is dead and
[1:06:59] there's a new man and we are not to
[1:07:03] serve sin and the church said you see
[1:07:07] the Christians who still serve sin are
[1:07:12] christless
[1:07:14] Christians Ephesians
[1:07:17] 4:22 that you put off concerning the
[1:07:20] former
[1:07:24] conversation amen
[1:07:26] the old man which is corrupt according
[1:07:30] to the deceitful lust and be renewed in
[1:07:33] the spirit of your mind and that ye put
[1:07:39] on the new man which after God is
[1:07:44] created in righteousness and true
[1:07:47] Holiness notice what the new man
[1:07:50] is it is a new
[1:07:53] creation created after God so it's not
[1:07:57] us while I pray I read my Bible three
[1:07:59] times a day I fast every now and then I
[1:08:01] pay my TI and I give offerings and I do
[1:08:03] and I do that's good that's really good
[1:08:05] that's that's wonderful that that life
[1:08:07] has changed you to make you want to do
[1:08:09] for others but that within itself is not
[1:08:11] what I'm talking about I'm talking about
[1:08:13] you actually receive the new
[1:08:16] man Christ
[1:08:19] Jesus look friends when're in the
[1:08:20] evening time God wants us to have more
[1:08:24] than just a
[1:08:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost in our
[1:08:30] spirit now I know many of you didn't
[1:08:32] have come from
[1:08:33] Pentecost you never saw what myself and
[1:08:36] some of the others some of the older
[1:08:38] ones here seen in Pentecost how the
[1:08:41] people could run scream shout holler
[1:08:44] prophesy true prophecy speaking tongues
[1:08:47] with true tongues and true
[1:08:50] interpretation hit it right on and other
[1:08:53] times miss it just as wrong as it could
[1:08:55] be
[1:08:55] off on off on live lives that was
[1:08:59] contrary to the word of God I want more
[1:09:02] than that for us I want more than just a
[1:09:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost in our spirit
[1:09:08] the token must move into the soul it
[1:09:13] must be more than manifestations of the
[1:09:15] spirit of God and we lay hands on other
[1:09:18] yes and we're going to continue to do so
[1:09:20] but I don't want it for us to just stop
[1:09:23] there I want it to be that when we go
[1:09:25] before God In Prayer we can present the
[1:09:28] token what is the token it is your own
[1:09:31] personal uh possession that God gave you
[1:09:34] of himself it's your right to the Life
[1:09:38] of Christ more than a gift more than
[1:09:41] tongues more than speaking around Oh
[1:09:43] Glory to God hallelujah I love you Jesus
[1:09:45] that's wonderful but when you pray you
[1:09:49] present your token what is that token
[1:09:52] it's not a sensation it's not an emotion
[1:09:54] it is the personal life of Christ the
[1:09:57] man Christ Jesus in you no wonder the
[1:10:03] prophet said that he don't hear your
[1:10:05] voice he don't even see you it's your
[1:10:08] voice coming up through the blood of the
[1:10:10] Lord Jesus and it's the Son of God
[1:10:15] himself lord
[1:10:18] god notice that you put on the new man
[1:10:21] which after God has created and
[1:10:24] righteousness and true Holiness so if
[1:10:27] there's a true Holiness it lets us know
[1:10:29] there's a false
[1:10:31] one oh come on now we're not the only
[1:10:33] people that wear long skirts and long
[1:10:35] dresses and long hair and all that sort
[1:10:37] of thing the the men andite Hutterites
[1:10:39] many of them do exactly the same thing
[1:10:41] there's still some of the apostolic down
[1:10:43] in Mississippi and in Louisiana and
[1:10:45] Alabama and they've got just as much
[1:10:47] outward Holiness as we do and we believe
[1:10:50] in that but we also believe there is a
[1:10:53] true Holiness that generat itself from
[1:10:56] the soul out and if it's from the soul
[1:10:59] it will reflect itself on the way you
[1:11:02] dress and the way you act in the world
[1:11:04] notice now Paul in Colossians 3:9 he
[1:11:07] says lie not one to another seeing that
[1:11:10] ye have put
[1:11:13] off the old man with his deeds and have
[1:11:17] put
[1:11:18] on the new man which is renewed in
[1:11:23] knowledge after the image of him that
[1:11:27] created
[1:11:30] him now remember knowledge to the Greeks
[1:11:34] was just being able to know Thing by
[1:11:36] facts but knowledge to the Jews nosis
[1:11:40] was not just knowing the factual side of
[1:11:42] it but knowing it by experience right
[1:11:47] Romans 6:11 likewise reckon ye also
[1:11:51] yourselves to be dead indeed into sin
[1:11:55] be alive unto God through Jesus Christ
[1:11:58] Our Lord let not sin
[1:12:02] therefore
[1:12:04] rain in your mortal
[1:12:09] body don't you notice how Paul separates
[1:12:12] you from your
[1:12:15] house now Paul is
[1:12:18] addressing the newborn part the
[1:12:22] soul let not sin
[1:12:25] therefore reign in your mortal B so he
[1:12:29] separates
[1:12:31] you and he's telling you don't let sin
[1:12:34] be a king over you he gives a
[1:12:38] personification a very strange
[1:12:40] personification to sin as if though sin
[1:12:45] was a
[1:12:47] king as if though sin was an
[1:12:52] individual ah here we go
[1:12:56] so if sin is an
[1:12:59] individual then righteousness must also
[1:13:02] be an
[1:13:03] individual Tree of Life tree of
[1:13:06] knowledge of Good and
[1:13:08] Evil let not sin therefore Reign the
[1:13:11] word Reign the Greek is bilios which
[1:13:14] means to be king over so Paul is writing
[1:13:20] to a part of
[1:13:21] us that is different from the Mortal
[1:13:24] body so that's that's who Romans 6 is
[1:13:26] addressed to is the soul of the
[1:13:29] regenerate let not sin therefore reign
[1:13:32] in your mortal body that ye should obey
[1:13:36] it in the lust thereof why because sin
[1:13:40] ens slaves making a person subject to
[1:13:46] sin's desires so sin is actually a
[1:13:50] master sin is a characterization
[1:13:55] of a spiritual being which has desires
[1:13:59] and passions and wants and longings but
[1:14:04] in order for him to fully Express them
[1:14:06] the way he wants he wants to do it
[1:14:09] through human beings you see Satan will
[1:14:12] never achieve everything that he wants
[1:14:15] just by him and how many other angels
[1:14:18] that he took in the beginning we don't
[1:14:20] know exactly how many there were but
[1:14:22] there must have been quite a few one of
[1:14:24] the words is used there in the Book of
[1:14:26] Genesis is Myriad that describes those
[1:14:30] also in the Book of Revelation when he
[1:14:31] talks about those that had fallen so it
[1:14:34] was Myriad one of the meanings of the
[1:14:36] word Myriad is a number which you cannot
[1:14:39] number so we don't know exactly but it's
[1:14:42] like he does not want to stop
[1:14:45] there he wants it in
[1:14:48] you he wants said an Ever Sinner and
[1:14:51] whenever we were born in sin he was king
[1:14:56] of our
[1:14:58] life his nature we partook of it by
[1:15:03] natural birth and when you got the holy
[1:15:06] ghost in your soul it turned hell upside
[1:15:10] down amen so he lost control every son
[1:15:15] and daughter of God sitting in this
[1:15:17] building today was taken away from the
[1:15:20] devil just out the Earth is fixing to be
[1:15:23] taken away from it thank you Lord and
[1:15:25] boy you know how he is with his
[1:15:27] possession he don't love you he does not
[1:15:29] love you the prophet said Satan is not
[1:15:31] love and he cannot love so he doesn't
[1:15:33] love you but he's very jealous of what's
[1:15:36] his so God slipped down and wooed you to
[1:15:40] himself and pulled you to an altar
[1:15:42] somewhere and you and God made an
[1:15:45] agreement together and there you laid
[1:15:47] down that old nature on the Altar and
[1:15:49] that old nature died which was your
[1:15:52] first husband that I wish somebody would
[1:15:54] hear me this morning that first nature
[1:15:56] which had a rule over you was your first
[1:15:59] husband and you were married to that
[1:16:01] don't get in your mind now that well the
[1:16:04] Lord's going to just save me you know
[1:16:06] he's going to divorce that that old
[1:16:07] thing and that you know I I'll be able
[1:16:09] to take that same old nature and Remar
[1:16:12] that nature to the Lord Jesus oh no you
[1:16:14] can't remember the high priest must
[1:16:17] marry a virgin Only The Lord Oh Glory to
[1:16:21] God the Lord Jesus is not going to Remar
[1:16:24] what was formerly the devil's wife he's
[1:16:27] not going to take you and you and you
[1:16:29] and you and you and then he'll stand
[1:16:31] there well I that's okay that don't
[1:16:33] bother me I I I'll I'll marry the
[1:16:35] devil's wife he said no I ain't doing
[1:16:37] that but I will give her a new birth
[1:16:41] amen and it will be as if though she
[1:16:44] never done it in the first place I will
[1:16:46] remove the devil's nature the devil's
[1:16:49] power I will be born in her and I will
[1:16:54] marry myself in her because it will be
[1:16:59] me living out my own
[1:17:03] life W glory to
[1:17:05] [Applause]
[1:17:10] God so the nature the command center the
[1:17:15] control tower and the Soul
[1:17:19] amen when you got born
[1:17:22] again you walked up to that alar and all
[1:17:24] all the demons out of hell they're
[1:17:26] they're shaking they're quivering
[1:17:27] they're trembling oh no don't let him
[1:17:29] get it don't let him get it don't let
[1:17:30] her get it don't let her get it do
[1:17:32] everything again whisper now for it
[1:17:34] whisper she cross the line don't let her
[1:17:36] get it don't let her get it you imagine
[1:17:38] these demons hang around these meetings
[1:17:40] and whenever they sees people coming up
[1:17:42] and getting the Holy Ghost and they say
[1:17:43] oh no oh no if they ever get it they'll
[1:17:46] never be ours again if they ever get it
[1:17:48] oh my and we're going to have to answer
[1:17:50] to the big man downstairs you imagine
[1:17:52] how it is when them Devils go down in
[1:17:54] hell after some meetings glory to God on
[1:17:56] Sunday morning question answers on
[1:17:58] Thursday night and on Wednesday night
[1:18:00] and then Devil's have to report and say
[1:18:02] all right what happened up there there
[1:18:03] another young person got the Holy
[1:18:05] Ghost what do you mean allowing them to
[1:18:08] get the Holy Ghost I've done everything
[1:18:10] I could I told I tried to get them from
[1:18:12] going to church I made them have a flat
[1:18:14] tar I made them had a headache and you
[1:18:17] know what they done they went in there
[1:18:18] and said down anyway I thought I had him
[1:18:20] convinced cuz I got there real
[1:18:22] comfortable and I made him real sleepy
[1:18:24] but all all of a sudden something come
[1:18:26] down and struck their soul I don't know
[1:18:28] how to explain it devil it got a hold to
[1:18:30] them oh glory to God that got a hold to
[1:18:33] them and change their and you imagine
[1:18:36] the devil saying why did you do
[1:18:45] that well if he'd be honest he'd have to
[1:18:47] say I didn't have no power over
[1:18:50] it I hate to admit it but I just
[1:18:52] couldn't hold him back
[1:18:55] let me tell you something if we start
[1:18:56] putting harnesses in these seats and
[1:18:58] seat belts and tying your feet to the
[1:19:01] chair some of you jump up and come like
[1:19:03] this to the altar if you have to why
[1:19:05] because it's a holy ghost it's the
[1:19:07] spirit of God drawing you there's not
[1:19:10] enough gravity on the earth there's not
[1:19:12] enough powers in hell to keep an elect
[1:19:16] child of God in darkness
[1:19:28] notice in Romans 8:13 or 6:13 rather
[1:19:32] neither yield
[1:19:34] [Music]
[1:19:36] ye your
[1:19:40] members so Paul is speaking to a
[1:19:43] resident that's living in the house and
[1:19:46] saying don't let your
[1:19:48] doors don't let you windows don't let
[1:19:52] you
[1:19:53] attics don't let let your porch don't
[1:19:56] let your living room your kitchen or
[1:19:58] your
[1:19:58] bedroom don't let them be members to the
[1:20:03] devil you're the boss of this
[1:20:07] house Christ the new
[1:20:12] man so Paul eradicates the idea that the
[1:20:16] devil made me do I didn't have no power
[1:20:19] over
[1:20:21] him that is a lie amen amen
[1:20:25] amen neither yield ye
[1:20:30] your members as instruments of
[1:20:32] unrighteousness under sin but
[1:20:34] yield
[1:20:36] yourselves unto God as those that are
[1:20:41] alive from the dead and your
[1:20:46] members
[1:20:48] as now notice he doesn't say they are
[1:20:50] members of
[1:20:52] righteousness but they're as
[1:20:59] my body don't like to be used by the
[1:21:00] Holy
[1:21:02] Ghost my body don't like to praise the
[1:21:04] Lord right you've heard me preach it
[1:21:06] before about Paul being chained to a
[1:21:08] Roman guard and whenever Paul would have
[1:21:10] to go preach that Roman guard standing
[1:21:13] there by him in the Pulpit you imagine
[1:21:14] that was an odd
[1:21:16] situation Paul wanted to praise the lord
[1:21:18] well he's changed that Roman Guard Paul
[1:21:21] put his hands up that Roman guard put
[1:21:22] his hands up too Paul said I'm going to
[1:21:25] pray and that Roman said I I I I don't I
[1:21:27] don't pray to your God he said well I'm
[1:21:28] going to pray I'm not sure who you're
[1:21:29] praying to but I know who I'm praying to
[1:21:32] Paul go to prayer meeting that Roman
[1:21:33] guard was with him well that's the way
[1:21:35] you are you're trained to a dead man
[1:21:37] what is that dead man this old body
[1:21:39] right here is this still does this still
[1:21:42] lean toward the world and the things of
[1:21:44] the world absolutely it does notice how
[1:21:47] Paul differentiates between the New
[1:21:49] Birth part in the soul and this part
[1:21:51] right here and he identifies this as
[1:21:53] your members he doesn't say it's you
[1:21:57] amen he doesn't say it's you he says
[1:22:00] it's your members of your house that
[1:22:02] you're living in can't you see children
[1:22:04] that when we are born again all a saint
[1:22:07] of God passes beyond the curtain of time
[1:22:09] and we weep and we cry yes we do because
[1:22:12] we love them and we miss them but they
[1:22:14] are not dead that was simply an old cult
[1:22:17] the prophet said but the Lord had a
[1:22:20] brand new one for them glory to God Amen
[1:22:23] there's a brand new body weight and so
[1:22:25] what do we do I'm doing the very best
[1:22:28] thing I can do for This Old House of
[1:22:29] mine I take it to church I'll make it
[1:22:32] pray I'll make it study well glory to
[1:22:35] God I'll make it sing I'll make it bend
[1:22:37] down on its knees and pray and one of
[1:22:40] these days this old body is going to
[1:22:42] thank me for making it go to church it's
[1:22:44] going to thank me for M making me turn
[1:22:47] my head it's going to thank me because
[1:22:50] the king in my body say hey hey hey
[1:22:53] don't you do that
[1:22:54] [Applause]
[1:23:00] I kind of hope on that
[1:23:02] morning I'm standing in front of the
[1:23:06] mirror I know there's a lot of men in
[1:23:09] the message are jealous of me not
[1:23:11] because of my preaching or because of my
[1:23:13] gift but because of my
[1:23:21] hair you ought to see it sometimes and
[1:23:24] I've had sleepless night though worrying
[1:23:26] about
[1:23:29] Saints I get up the next morning it
[1:23:32] don't look like just one rooster tail it
[1:23:34] looks like a hen house I mean they're
[1:23:37] sticking up all over my head and there's
[1:23:39] a witness sitting right there smiling

[1:27:01] closer than we've ever been before Oh
[1:27:04] friend what could we do what would be
[1:27:06] worse missing it for to satisfy the
[1:27:09] desires of this flesh and if you can
[1:27:12] crucify your Humanity right now it will
[1:27:15] be worth it through eternity we do not
[1:27:18] want sin to be the king of our life but
[1:27:22] we bring our body subject to the Holy
[1:27:24] Ghost I'd rather let the power of God
[1:27:27] use my hands I'd rather let the power of
[1:27:30] God use my mouth and my eyes and my ears
[1:27:33] instead of let my eyes let the devil use
[1:27:36] it why would I want to exchange that
[1:27:38] when almighty God wants to use us God
[1:27:43] wants to use you young
[1:27:51] people verse 14 for sin
[1:27:55] shall not have
[1:27:58] dominion over
[1:28:00] you for ye are not under the
[1:28:03] law but under
[1:28:07] grace verse 22 but now being made
[1:28:11] free from sin and become servants to God
[1:28:15] you have your fruit on
[1:28:19] Holiness and the
[1:28:21] end everlasting life amen thank you
[1:28:26] praise
[1:28:31] God I love the way a
[1:28:33] prophet is so gifted by God to look into
[1:28:38] things that all the rest of us would
[1:28:41] never
[1:28:42] see the prophet preaches a message about
[1:28:46] the Widow from
[1:28:49] zarapas and be certain of God you're
[1:28:52] familiar with it
[1:28:54] she only has just enough
[1:28:57] oil and enough
[1:28:59] meal for one more little hake of
[1:29:05] bread then after she and her son eats
[1:29:08] this they will
[1:29:11] die they're at their end they don't know
[1:29:14] anything else to
[1:29:15] do listen at him daylight
[1:29:19] broke she said the little fella had
[1:29:22] cried all night long
[1:29:25] for something to
[1:29:26] eat what will I do with one little
[1:29:29] handful of
[1:29:30] meal maybe just putting it off and
[1:29:33] putting it off before fixing the L that
[1:29:35] she
[1:29:37] had you know that meal was
[1:29:41] Christ any a Bible student knows that
[1:29:43] Christ was the meal
[1:29:45] offering and the oil means the
[1:29:49] spirit as we know according to Ezekiel 4
[1:29:51] and so forth that's the reason we anoint
[1:29:54] it says with oil it's the spirit what is
[1:29:58] it as St John 4 the father seeketh such
[1:30:00] to worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:30:03] and Jesus was the truth so he was the
[1:30:05] meal offering and this oil was the
[1:30:09] spirit and the spirit mixed with the
[1:30:13] truth has got to bring something you put
[1:30:17] it
[1:30:18] together and it makes a
[1:30:22] cake wow
[1:30:26] that's what we wanted our church
[1:30:28] a
[1:30:30] cake Holy Ghost
[1:30:34] cake meal's good but not by
[1:30:38] itself oil is good mix them together
[1:30:42] what do you get a
[1:30:44] cake now
[1:30:46] watch now it's what's it ready
[1:30:49] for it's ready for the cross
[1:30:54] it's ready for self-sacrifice that's
[1:30:56] what you have to do is if the word's
[1:30:59] been preached and you've got the spirit
[1:31:00] mixing it together it's self- sacrifice
[1:31:03] to deny every
[1:31:06] pain praise God to deny every sickness
[1:31:10] to deny everything that's contrary to
[1:31:13] God's word isin't that awesome way to
[1:31:14] look at
[1:31:15] it the doctor says this that or the
[1:31:18] other that don't make a bitter
[1:31:19] difference you stand on it because God
[1:31:21] said so the meal comes you got got the
[1:31:24] oil you mix it
[1:31:26] together now I hear a voice it's a
[1:31:30] little like your daylight a voice speaks
[1:31:32] and says go out in the
[1:31:35] yard and get two
[1:31:37] sticks did you notice the scripture said
[1:31:40] two
[1:31:41] sticks the
[1:31:44] cross the meal and the oil but she's
[1:31:47] going to be called on to act now act
[1:31:53] with it
[1:31:55] so the meal and the oil and now she's
[1:31:59] going to have to
[1:32:00] act she don't know where the sticks will
[1:32:03] be laying but there's two
[1:32:05] sticks in the yard
[1:32:07] somewhere she starts off and she goes
[1:32:09] out in the yard and she looks around oh
[1:32:11] how hot the screams from the city the
[1:32:14] night prowers coming in scrambling along
[1:32:17] drinking their wines and so forth she
[1:32:19] looks down the street and she sees
[1:32:21] nothing she finds one stick part of the
[1:32:26] Cross
[1:32:27] self-sacrifice she gets another piece of
[1:32:30] a stick and when she picked up that
[1:32:33] second stick oh how gloomy it must have
[1:32:36] been death lying at the door her and her
[1:32:39] son had to eat the one little piece of
[1:32:42] the whole cake and die that's all there
[1:32:44] was of it and sometimes right in the
[1:32:47] midst of
[1:32:48] Gloom we hear the
[1:32:50] voice and when she picked up the second
[1:32:53] stick and started
[1:32:56] back there was a voice came over the
[1:32:59] gate fetch me a little
[1:33:02] water in a
[1:33:05] vessel so she's got the spirit she's got
[1:33:09] the
[1:33:10] word now she's got the
[1:33:15] cross and then this voice comes right
[1:33:19] exactly when she picks up the cross
[1:33:24] oh Lord God she turned to look with
[1:33:27] those two sticks in her hand with some
[1:33:30] meal and the allil mixed and
[1:33:32] ready and she said she addressed it and
[1:33:35] mixed it together that's what the word
[1:33:37] and spirit has to mix together and lay
[1:33:40] it upon the cross of self-
[1:33:44] sacrifice to deny anything that's
[1:33:47] contrary to what you've
[1:33:49] asked I hope somebody's hear me today
[1:33:54] I mixed it now I'm going to get the six
[1:33:56] and the voice said bring me a drink of
[1:33:57] water in the vestel and she looks and
[1:33:59] sees a man sending there leaning across
[1:34:02] the gate thin cheek bearded baldheaded
[1:34:06] looking across the gate with an old
[1:34:08] piece of sheep skin wrapped around him
[1:34:10] look like he was a kind kind of a
[1:34:12] looking Old Gentleman she said I'll
[1:34:14] share my water with
[1:34:16] him Waters of life you're willing to
[1:34:19] give it to
[1:34:22] anybody and then when she starts with
[1:34:25] the
[1:34:26] cross with some
[1:34:29] mixture now another word
[1:34:32] comes bring
[1:34:34] me a little morsel
[1:34:38] tee now see she had picked up the
[1:34:41] cross what's the prophet's message going
[1:34:44] to have her
[1:34:46] do she will now have to use that
[1:34:50] cross if you'll notice he never promised
[1:34:53] now that what you give me a hook cake
[1:34:54] first and God woman I'm telling you
[1:34:57] God's fixing to explode your meal Barrel
[1:34:59] God's fixing to explode your vessels she
[1:35:03] got no
[1:35:06] promise right what she
[1:35:08] said how can I do
[1:35:11] that I've only got just a handful of
[1:35:13] meal and a little bit of oil and I've
[1:35:15] mixed it together don't you understand
[1:35:17] I've got this cross here me my son I'm
[1:35:20] fixing to bake this and we're going to
[1:35:21] die
[1:35:23] but he said bake me one
[1:35:27] first little did she know when she
[1:35:29] picked up that
[1:35:30] cross she would have to lay her meal and
[1:35:34] her oil on the cross that she picked
[1:35:42] up and of course you know the end of the
[1:35:52] story so so let me ask you as I
[1:35:57] close what will God demand of you and
[1:36:02] I one day it might be one thing the next
[1:36:05] day it might be something else
[1:36:07] ultimately taking our
[1:36:10] cross is for whatever he chooses before
[1:36:14] us I don't mind telling you
[1:36:17] friends I believe the bride of Christ
[1:36:19] has been tried like never before I'm in
[1:36:22] contact with people all over this world
[1:36:24] I have never heard of the people of God
[1:36:27] going through so much
[1:36:29] stuff preachers churches individuals
[1:36:34] what people are going through is just
[1:36:36] unbelievable incredible the things that
[1:36:39] people are having to deal
[1:36:42] with all hell is against you as the
[1:36:46] people of
[1:36:49] God don't misunder understand what I'm
[1:36:51] going to say I can handle
[1:36:55] that but I'll tell you what becomes so
[1:36:59] difficult is when it seems
[1:37:02] like he turns against
[1:37:07] you I can't handle
[1:37:11] that anybody ever been there where you
[1:37:13] felt like Lord where are you where are
[1:37:16] you Lord if you forgot my name if you
[1:37:19] forgot where I live Lord why why are you
[1:37:22] why are you letting this happen
[1:37:26] I found the quote years and years ago
[1:37:27] where the Prophet said God you broke my
[1:37:32] heart over and over
[1:37:36] again and I thank you for
[1:37:39] it and I thought man that that was that
[1:37:43] was from a man that had been through so
[1:37:47] much and yet he was able to view it from
[1:37:50] a
[1:37:51] perspective that it had entered into
[1:37:54] Thanksgiving instead of resentment and
[1:37:58] an
[1:38:00] attitude what will
[1:38:02] God ask of you some of you say oh my we
[1:38:07] got the word we got the message of that
[1:38:08] we got a move of God we've got a church
[1:38:10] to go to praise God we got good Ministry
[1:38:12] Brothers there we got a place for our
[1:38:14] young people my what what could happen
[1:38:17] What could happen after we mix together
[1:38:19] the word and the
[1:38:21] oil the cross
[1:38:26] the cross brother
[1:38:28] Phillip two sticks one laying over here
[1:38:32] one laying over
[1:38:37] there but when you put them
[1:38:42] together and then you embrace
[1:38:45] it oh Jesus thank you thank you thank
[1:38:48] you so much thank you for letting me see
[1:38:51] this cross oh Jesus thank you thank you
[1:38:53] for dying on that cross and he said no
[1:38:56] [Music]
[1:38:57] child that's
[1:39:03] yours Oh you mean that that that that
[1:39:06] that's not yours I've done died on
[1:39:09] mine this one that you just picked up in
[1:39:12] the yard that's
[1:39:19] yours how much easier it would be
[1:39:24] brother Jim Woodson was sing in this my
[1:39:27] office there Sunday after
[1:39:29] church thanking me for just obeying the
[1:39:32] Lord there about the
[1:39:38] service the Lord dropped this Sal here
[1:39:40] in my heart as he and I were talking I
[1:39:43] told him then brother Jim people get it
[1:39:45] confused they
[1:39:46] think after they die one time why do I
[1:39:50] have to die again I said I don't think
[1:39:52] we realize that
[1:39:53] our nature dieses once but our flesh
[1:39:57] does every
[1:40:02] day praise the
[1:40:05] Lord don't you want to be
[1:40:09] willing to
[1:40:12] die so you mix your word and your spirit
[1:40:15] your oil together and then the Lord
[1:40:17] Jesus says I climb upon the
[1:40:21] cross and give it back to to
[1:40:24] me oh
[1:40:26] my how how
[1:40:31] reassuring it must have been when she
[1:40:33] hears that voice Thunder back across
[1:40:35] that gate for thus saith the
[1:40:39] Lord your meal Barrel will not
[1:40:44] R nor will your cruise of
[1:40:47] oil until the day the Lord God visits
[1:40:51] his people
[1:40:55] let's spow heads together shall
[1:41:03] we I wonder how many of you with
[1:41:07] me want to be
[1:41:09] willing help me Lord help me I love the
[1:41:14] word I love the spirit oh
[1:41:18] my but whoever
[1:41:20] thought would have to take it to that
[1:41:23] place place of the
[1:41:25] Cross where we trust him even when we
[1:41:29] don't feel him where we pray even when
[1:41:31] we don't feel nothing when we do pray
[1:41:34] will we come to
[1:41:35] church even though we may not feel it he
[1:41:38] say but yet his word says forsake not
[1:41:41] the assembling of yourselves together
[1:41:43] what are you doing you're taking that
[1:41:45] word laying it on the cross I'm going to
[1:41:47] church whether I feel it or not when I
[1:41:49] get there I'm going to worship I'm going
[1:41:51] to sing I'm going to clap my hands I'm
[1:41:53] going to or praise the Lord because
[1:41:54] that's what the word tells me to do what
[1:41:57] are you doing then you were laying that
[1:42:00] word that you've heard and that spirit
[1:42:02] that you have within you upon the cross
[1:42:06] of self-denial I don't feel you Lord
[1:42:09] I've been going to a low spot remember
[1:42:10] the prophet After the Storm was calmed
[1:42:12] out in
[1:42:14] Colorado and he said he'd been going
[1:42:16] through a spot in his life and he began
[1:42:18] to question himself and wonder if he'd
[1:42:20] done something wrong you remember the
[1:42:22] story
[1:42:24] and he said after the Lord calmed the
[1:42:26] storm there was snow laying on the
[1:42:29] leaves a little bit prior to
[1:42:31] that and as he bowed his head and
[1:42:34] started
[1:42:35] crying the tears is falling off out of
[1:42:38] his eyes down his cheeks landing on
[1:42:40] those leaves which were now dry which
[1:42:44] had been covered with snow just a little
[1:42:46] while
[1:42:47] before and said Lord you know what's
[1:42:50] wrong I don't understand
[1:42:54] have I done this have I done something
[1:42:56] wrong I was talking to someone the other
[1:42:58] day I've never found where brother brand
[1:42:59] actually ever said that he ever found
[1:43:01] what was going on during that trial but
[1:43:04] the Lord spoke to him and said why don't
[1:43:06] you come and walk with me and he said
[1:43:09] it's the greatest privilege of my life
[1:43:12] and he said that burden just left
[1:43:15] him and be certain of God in 1959
[1:43:19] especially the one in Jeffersonville he
[1:43:20] preached it several times but that when
[1:43:21] there's always been my favorite
[1:43:25] when he said he'd come to a time in his
[1:43:26] life to where you'd uncover every stone
[1:43:29] and you search everything in your life
[1:43:30] and seemed like he can't find nothing
[1:43:33] wrong you'd make it right if you could
[1:43:37] and he said you don't know what else to
[1:43:39] do he said then what do you do you be
[1:43:42] certain of
[1:43:45] God so maybe you've got your word today
[1:43:48] and your spirit and you're looking for a
[1:43:51] move
[1:43:53] you're not sure exactly what the outcome
[1:43:55] will
[1:43:56] be take it and you and it come upon that
[1:44:01] cross and Jesus will honor
[1:44:06] you praise the
[1:44:09] Lord heavenly
[1:44:12] father thank you for the service today I
[1:44:14] actually
[1:44:16] thought last Sunday I was done with
[1:44:18] dealing with this
[1:44:20] but I've done figured out a long time
[1:44:23] ago it's a whole lot better off for me
[1:44:24] to you me to follow you than me to
[1:44:26] follow what I think
[1:44:29] anyway I pray Lord that you would make
[1:44:31] us sensitive father to the spirit of
[1:44:36] God I don't know if they can say it yet
[1:44:39] truthfully but what an honor it is how
[1:44:43] blessed we
[1:44:44] are to be able to die one more
[1:44:50] day because there's billions of people
[1:44:53] people on the face of the Earth
[1:44:55] today they cannot take that scripture
[1:44:57] that Paul read wrote in 1
[1:45:00] Corinthians and say I Die
[1:45:04] daily because they still have that
[1:45:07] nature in them that's
[1:45:09] sinful that scripture can only apply to
[1:45:12] a son or daughter of God which has been
[1:45:15] filled with the Holy
[1:45:17] Ghost and their nature has been changed
[1:45:20] and separates them from the Mortal body
[1:45:24] in the sense of two different
[1:45:28] dominions because when we were Sinners
[1:45:30] we couldn't say that
[1:45:32] truthfully but after we're born again we
[1:45:35] can say I Die
[1:45:39] daily help us Lord
[1:45:43] Jesus how may like to be remember today
[1:45:45] before the
[1:45:48] Lord God bless
[1:45:50] you raise your heads if you would
[1:45:54] read this with me in that day on Calvary
[1:45:57] he was just one man the perfect man he
[1:45:58] gave his life and made an example for
[1:46:01] you now what must we do now the first
[1:46:04] thing I want to say
[1:46:06] is Jesus never lived for
[1:46:10] himself his life was spent for others
[1:46:13] that's
[1:46:15] perfectly eternal
[1:46:17] life when you say you go to church and
[1:46:20] you do good things that's fine but when
[1:46:23] you live your
[1:46:25] life to
[1:46:29] yourself do you understand one of the
[1:46:31] worst
[1:46:33] mistakes that many of the message people
[1:46:36] are making in this
[1:46:37] day they feel like they're following the
[1:46:40] plan of God they don't go to church they
[1:46:43] don't attend church they stay home and
[1:46:45] play tapes and yet there's churches and
[1:46:47] driving distance of where they live and
[1:46:49] they feel like they're fulfilling the
[1:46:50] will of God do you understand what
[1:46:52] they're doing they're fulfilling the
[1:46:54] very epitome of a selfish
[1:46:59] life I don't need to go to church it's
[1:47:02] not just about what you
[1:47:04] need we might need you amen but do
[1:47:09] people like that think about others they
[1:47:12] don't I don't need to go I get
[1:47:15] everything I need I don't need to
[1:47:17] worship I don't I
[1:47:21] don't that's not eternal
[1:47:26] life how sad it's going to be one day
[1:47:28] when the Rapture takes place and all
[1:47:30] over the world yes sir people are just
[1:47:33] getting ready to stream and stay home
[1:47:35] yes sir and if the Rapture takes place
[1:47:37] on that Sunday
[1:47:39] morning they'll still be able to stream
[1:47:42] because they'll be
[1:47:45] left they will be
[1:47:48] left because they are living a selfish
[1:47:51] life amen they can get up and listen to
[1:47:54] the tape with their pajamas on they can
[1:47:57] have a cup of coffee in their hand and a
[1:47:59] donut if they
[1:48:04] wish when some of youve do two hours one
[1:48:07] way to come to church today what time
[1:48:09] you have to get up early to get that
[1:48:11] start some of you drove further than
[1:48:13] that why because you wanted to be here
[1:48:17] not just so you could get something but
[1:48:19] you could bring your little lick of fire
[1:48:22] with the rest of us you being here helps
[1:48:26] me you being here helps others and
[1:48:29] people who live that life I don't need
[1:48:32] to go to
[1:48:36] church they're not living the life of
[1:48:39] the Lord
[1:48:42] Jesus oh I know some of you have family
[1:48:44] members that do it pray for them cuz
[1:48:47] don't you understand they will hang
[1:48:48] around this message with their long hair
[1:48:50] and their long dress and they will miss
[1:48:53] the
[1:48:54] Rapture if the Lord Jesus marries one
[1:48:57] selfish person I
[1:49:00] quit if he marries one cigarette sucking
[1:49:03] man and one cigarette sucker is allowed
[1:49:05] to go in the Rapture I quit
[1:49:08] today for all he's demanded out of many
[1:49:11] of us and he will let somebody go on the
[1:49:14] Rapture that is so self centered that
[1:49:17] they have their very epitome of Satan's
[1:49:19] nature and he allows one to go like that
[1:49:22] oh my he's been unjust to
[1:49:25] me he has been so unjust to many of
[1:49:29] us he demanded our lives he demanded
[1:49:33] that we be separated from our families I
[1:49:35] was
[1:49:36] disowned by my family years ago for this
[1:49:39] word for years my family wouldn't even
[1:49:42] speak to me I wasn't allowed to dinners
[1:49:45] I wasn't allowed to
[1:49:47] nothing and then God's going to let some
[1:49:49] of his message people go in that's as
[1:49:50] backslid as they can be and they're
[1:49:53] going to go on the Rapture
[1:49:57] no Word of Life there's one way we will
[1:50:00] go in this rapture we must be filled
[1:50:03] with the Holy Ghost and we must be
[1:50:05] living a life which is worthy of the
[1:50:08] Gospel of Jesus
[1:50:14] Christ was that for you are you are you
[1:50:17] is that for you brother John it was okay
[1:50:19] all right I was wondering who I was
[1:50:20] saying that for all right brother John
[1:50:23] when you live your life to
[1:50:26] yourself you
[1:50:29] haven't eternal
[1:50:33] life eternal life is living for others
[1:50:36] it proved it when he come in the Lamb of
[1:50:38] God he lived and had eternal life
[1:50:40] because he did not live for himself he
[1:50:42] lived for others and you receive eternal
[1:50:45] life by receiving that day and you don't
[1:50:49] live for yourself no more
[1:50:53] you live for
[1:50:56] others someone said how can you stand
[1:50:58] and let anyone call you such bad
[1:51:01] names you don't live for yourself you
[1:51:03] live for
[1:51:05] others that you might redeem that
[1:51:08] man you become sons and the trouble of
[1:51:11] it is the church has forgot their sons
[1:51:13] your sons you're taking Christ's
[1:51:17] place so you don't live for yourself you
[1:51:19] live for others well brother brandom I
[1:51:20] can live for the brother oh that brother
[1:51:22] because he's a really nice man that's
[1:51:24] not
[1:51:26] it live for that man who hates
[1:51:30] you live for that
[1:51:33] person who kill
[1:51:38] you if they
[1:51:42] could well now we're separating the men
[1:51:44] from the boys ain't we now we're
[1:51:46] separating the bride from the church now
[1:51:48] we're separating message people from
[1:51:50] bride people cuz all message people
[1:51:53] ain't bride
[1:51:55] people can you imagine live for that
[1:51:58] person who would kill you if they could
[1:52:01] that's what they done to him yes they
[1:52:06] killed him and he died that he might
[1:52:10] save them listen to this church let's
[1:52:12] stand
[1:52:13] together that's eternal
[1:52:16] life when
[1:52:19] that's in your bosom
[1:52:22] you're
[1:52:23] facing heaven
[1:52:30] then notice where he said it
[1:52:32] was
[1:52:34] here not
[1:52:38] here when every one of us get
[1:52:42] that we're Rapture
[1:52:46] Ready praise
[1:52:49] God let me read one more a person who
[1:52:53] lives their life for their
[1:52:56] s lives a
[1:52:59] selfish
[1:53:02] life praise the
[1:53:04] Lord don't you love him
[1:53:07] today don't you love one another it
[1:53:11] ain't enough to love him and it ain't
[1:53:14] enough to love those that like you it
[1:53:17] ain't enough to be able to oh yes I
[1:53:19] would gladly brother Donnie there's
[1:53:20] people here today I know I I know beyond
[1:53:23] a shadow of a
[1:53:24] doubt if it come between my life and
[1:53:27] your life some of you would give your
[1:53:29] life so that I could
[1:53:33] live because you think what I do is more
[1:53:36] beneficial than what you do and you
[1:53:39] would give your life for me that I could
[1:53:43] live that's wonderful that's
[1:53:46] notable but when we get to the place
[1:53:48] that we could do it for the person that
[1:53:51] tells things on us it's not true that
[1:53:54] lies on us that hurts
[1:53:57] us you're even closer to looking heaven
[1:54:01] in the face than whenever you do it for
[1:54:06] me you see I know whenever Erica went
[1:54:08] through her hard time especially the
[1:54:10] last six months or so I know that y'all
[1:54:13] kept your birds from

[1:54:21] much stuff ourselves
[1:54:23] Carol said you reckon the church people
[1:54:26] ain't going through a whole lot of stuff
[1:54:27] I said you know that you know what
[1:54:29] they're doing they're keeping it from
[1:54:32] us once Erica graduated moved on up into
[1:54:36] that sixth Dimension boy did you all let
[1:54:39] the gates fly
[1:54:45] open but you know what that done to
[1:54:48] me you'll never know what that done to
[1:54:50] me Carol
[1:54:53] because it let us know you was having
[1:54:54] such hard
[1:54:56] times but you felt so for us you didn't

[1:55:03] bless you for
[1:55:04] that I want to live with you all for
[1:55:09] eternity you hear
