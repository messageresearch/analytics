[42:24] Testament
[42:26] the days of Moses Joshua the judges
[42:30] Prophets The Patriarchs
[42:34] and you would have
[42:35] heard their prophecies and tried to
[42:38] understand that there would come a day
[42:40] when God would move out of a house
[42:46] and live in human bodies
[42:49] it would have been just you think really
[42:51] you've got to be kid
[42:53] God would want to do that yes
[42:56] he actually did want to do that
[42:59] think what a privileged people We Are

[43:20] amen praise the Lord
[43:28] let's turn to one of those prophets of
[43:31] the Old Testament Zechariah
[43:33] chapter 6 verse 11.
[43:37] now this is one of those that we was
[43:39] speaking about a week or so ago that God
[43:42] would take
[43:43] a scenario in that day
[43:47] and would speak it in a prophetic way
[43:52] this is one of those situations it's the
[43:54] rebuilding of course of the temple and
[43:57] God did it in different phases Nehemiah
[44:00] had a part
[44:01] Zachariah Malachi haggai were Minor
[44:06] Prophets as they were called they were
[44:08] prophets of this rebuilding time
[44:11] zerubbabel which is another great man
[44:14] that God used Nehemiah the cut Bearer
[44:16] now we've moved over into another phase
[44:19] of that whenever God is going to have
[44:22] them to make a crown for Joshua and this
[44:26] is not Joshua course in the time of
[44:28] Moses but it's another one which was a
[44:31] lineage of a priest and God is going to
[44:33] have the prophet Zechariah to make this
[44:37] crown but yet God is going to have
[44:40] Zechariah to speak Words which will come
[44:43] into existence hundreds and hundreds of
[44:46] years after this actually takes place
[44:51] now this is our setting
[44:53] then take silver and gold and make
[44:55] crowns and set them upon the head
[44:59] of Joshua the son of Jose deck the high
[45:04] priest
[45:06] and speak unto him
[45:09] now notice what he's going to tell
[45:10] Joshua
[45:13] thus speaketh the Lord of hosts
[45:16] saying behold the man
[45:19] whose name is the branch
[45:24] he shall grow up out of his place
[45:28] and he shall build the temple
[45:31] of the Lord
[45:33] now what would you would have said if
[45:35] you'd have been living in that day
[45:37] and you would have heard this prophecy
[45:40] you said okay now that's a Vindicated
[45:43] prophet of God he can only speak when he
[45:46] says thus saith the Lord he can only
[45:48] speak at the divine inspiration
[45:51] so
[45:53] Joshua dies
[45:56] he lives his life
[45:58] and he dies and people's thinking oh my
[46:02] goodness
[46:03] this Vindicated Prophet how could he not
[46:07] be anointed of God how could this be
[46:12] but you're just there as a Believer
[46:14] you're just holding on to the word and
[46:16] you're thinking
[46:17] I don't understand exactly how it could
[46:19] be but that man
[46:21] was a Vindicated prophet
[46:24] now what he said was exactly right but
[46:27] it was veiled
[46:28] veiled
[46:30] away from those that were not quickened
[46:32] to life
[46:34] now look in verse 13. even he shall
[46:38] build
[46:39] the Temple of the Lord
[46:42] the temple
[46:43] of the Lord now this is in the time when
[46:46] the house of God is being rebuilt and
[46:50] yet the prophet is speaking of the
[46:52] future building imagine the people
[46:54] saying the poor guy I mean he you know
[46:57] he's he's been alone out there by
[46:59] himself he's just lost it that's all he
[47:01] can say we're we're rejoicing because we
[47:04] got a new house to worship God and here
[47:06] this man is talking about some other
[47:09] time he was talking about some other
[47:12] time
[47:13] and he shall bear the glory and he shall
[47:17] sit and Rule
[47:19] upon his throne
[47:21] and he shall be a priest
[47:25] upon his throne now according to the law
[47:28] this cannot happen
[47:32] God never you hear me never
[47:36] ordain one man of the levitical order to
[47:39] be both priest and King
[47:42] so now if we would check him by the word
[47:46] where would we find in his scriptures
[47:48] to prove this could happen
[47:52] well I got you all listening anyway
[47:56] now we're looking back at it of course
[47:58] from This Way backwards and to us I said
[48:00] well sure that makes perfect sense he
[48:02] was talking about another dispensation
[48:04] but they didn't know that
[48:06] they didn't know what was going on
[48:09] he shall be a priest upon his throne and
[48:12] the Council of Peace shall be between
[48:15] them boast between what office of King
[48:20] office of priest or reconciliation shall
[48:24] be brought together in a Unity of peace
[48:28] that mean a lot to be remembered to
[48:30] notice we pray you want your heart open
[48:32] tonight to the word wedding comes just
[48:35] to sing right when he just come to see
[48:37] one another and just well you know it's
[48:39] Wednesday night I think we'll go to
[48:41] church oh I want to hear from him so bad
[48:43] tonight
[48:45] amen
[48:47] Heavenly Father
[48:49] we thank you so much
[48:51] we're so grateful that we have
[48:54] our place back
[48:56] where we can worship
[48:58] how thankful we were able to have
[49:01] the holiday and when we had it but Lord
[49:04] how grateful we are
[49:06] to have our place back
[49:08] where we can meet with you and we can
[49:11] meet with each other
[49:12] father there's just something about
[49:14] having your own place
[49:17] father God we're looking for you to
[49:20] speak to us and looking for you to
[49:23] anoint us it wouldn't do much good Lord
[49:26] if you just anoint me I would be blessed
[49:29] and I would receive and I would be able
[49:32] to speak your anointed word but what
[49:35] good would that do if you don't anoint
[49:38] them
[49:39] and give them the ability to hear not
[49:42] only with their ears on the side of
[49:44] their head but to be able to hear with
[49:47] their heart
[49:49] so we pray tonight that you would come
[49:51] anoint the speaker anoint the hearers
[49:55] anoint your word that it might be made
[49:58] and manifest in each of Our Lives for
[50:01] it's in the name of the house of God
[50:06] in the name of the house of God
[50:10] the Lord Jesus that we ask it
[50:14] and the Saints said
[50:16] amen you may be seated
[50:23] you see you put
[50:25] your name
[50:28] on the door
[50:29] or the doorpost
[50:32] or the lentil
[50:34] so when people come up a stranger
[50:37] and they're looking for your house
[50:41] they can be able to see it on the
[50:43] mailbox on the outside or see it on the
[50:46] door
[50:46] see it somewhere that identifies who
[50:51] lives inside of that house
[50:54] well the house of God
[50:57] started out being very vague
[51:00] it was obscure it wasn't really plain
[51:04] for them to understand where does God
[51:07] dwell
[51:09] Moses had seen him in different forms
[51:13] and he had developed this curious desire
[51:16] to see him
[51:18] and he asked the Lord if he could see
[51:22] his face
[51:23] and he said no man
[51:25] can see my face and live
[51:29] but I will set you in a place
[51:33] and I will put my hand over this place
[51:36] and when I pass by
[51:39] I'll let you see a part of me
[51:42] so Moses gets into the cleft of The Rock
[51:46] and God in the form of Christ which was
[51:50] a theophany that this is pre-human
[51:53] existence
[51:55] then Christ moves back his hand and as
[52:00] he walks past Moses said it looked like
[52:04] the back part of a man
[52:08] so that didn't satisfy Moses he only
[52:13] wanted to see more
[52:15] well God
[52:16] decided he wanted to live among them
[52:20] so instead of one man seeing him and him
[52:24] telling others God said
[52:27] I will improvise
[52:29] and I'll make a way where that I will
[52:32] come down in a house
[52:35] attempt a temporary dwelling
[52:39] because I want to dwell with you all
[52:43] I want to hear you laugh
[52:45] I want to hear you talk about your
[52:47] problems and your issues
[52:50] and your troubles
[52:52] I want to hear you talk about the
[52:54] weather
[52:55] I want to hear you talk about
[52:58] the things that concern you I want to I
[53:01] want to dwell among you
[53:03] so he gives Moses the pattern by which
[53:07] he lays it out now Moses doesn't just
[53:10] pick his own desire and say you know
[53:12] what I've always thought to rectangular
[53:13] type of structure myself or maybe maybe
[53:16] Moses preferred a circle or maybe Moses
[53:18] locked a hexagon Moses from the land of
[53:21] Egypt maybe he wanted a pyramid but you
[53:24] know God never even asked Moses what his
[53:26] particular taste was God never asked him
[53:29] even what material that he preferred now
[53:32] no doubt Moses being from the lineage
[53:35] natural speaking and raised up among the
[53:37] Pharaohs they wanted something of a more
[53:40] permanent residence so they use Stone
[53:43] I've stood there several several years
[53:45] ago still able to see the Sphinx which
[53:49] was carved thousands of years ago the
[53:52] Pyramids of Giza the step pyramids
[53:55] seeing many of the Great statues of the
[53:59] Pharaohs that were carved thousands of
[54:02] years ago and still so perfectly that
[54:06] you could see the Contour of where their
[54:08] eyes were and see the wrinkles in the
[54:12] the knuckles on their hands carved out a
[54:15] solid Stone
[54:16] so maybe Moses would have had a idea now
[54:19] God I think really that stone ought to
[54:22] be what we built this out of you know
[54:24] Stone would be all right if you're going
[54:26] to leave this place of worship in one
[54:29] place
[54:30] but since you're going to be a traveling
[54:32] people you definitely don't want to Rock
[54:35] Church do you so God told them what to
[54:39] build it out of now how many beliefs God
[54:42] knows what he ought to build his church
[54:44] out of
[54:45] now I want you to think with me tonight
[54:47] that the institutions that God chose in
[54:51] the beginning and those that God
[54:53] ordained but of course before the
[54:55] foundation of the world are the ones
[54:58] that Satan hates so much
[55:00] now since God never ordained
[55:03] organization since God never ordained
[55:07] lots of the things that man does God
[55:09] never ordained a banking system God
[55:13] never ordained many of the things that
[55:15] men do much of what our society is made
[55:19] out of and much of what our desire our
[55:21] society depends upon but isn't it
[55:23] amazing that Satan doesn't fight that
[55:26] near as much as he does the original
[55:29] ones that are thousands of years old
[55:32] wonder why Satan hates marriage so much
[55:37] wonder why he hates the family so much
[55:41] wonder why he hates the church so much
[55:46] because it's God's original institutions
[55:50] so Satan if he cannot destroy it he will
[55:54] try to mock it so what does he do he
[55:58] mocks marriage now he knows he'll never
[56:01] annihilate marriage so what's he do he
[56:04] mocks marriage so he has a man to marry
[56:07] a man a woman to marry a woman a man to
[56:10] marry a pizza a man to marry a dog a
[56:14] woman to marry a cat well you know what
[56:16] some of the dumb people I've met that
[56:18] could be a perfect mate for him I don't
[56:20] know
[56:21] you know they might ought to marry a
[56:23] donkey that's about the I accuse him of
[56:25] them of God
[56:26] so why does Satan do that because he
[56:30] hates God's institution now God of
[56:33] course chose marriage first before the
[56:37] prevalence of family notice the order so
[56:40] God could have made a father and a
[56:43] daughter God could have made a father
[56:44] and a son and placed them in the garden
[56:47] of Ed just created both of them in that
[56:49] image God could have created a mother
[56:52] and a daughter a mother and a son but
[56:55] what did God do but Divine protocol God
[56:58] put the order and divine order was what
[57:01] a man and his wife no children yet so
[57:05] this was the divine order that God chose
[57:08] then what did God do God's plan was to
[57:11] further expand that family that man and
[57:14] woman through the mixing together of
[57:16] their genes and their DNA then there
[57:19] would be a family on the earth so what
[57:22] did Satan do Satan come to the very
[57:25] first Union him that God had on the
[57:27] earth which was marriage now it wasn't
[57:30] like Adam had a whole bunch of choices
[57:32] there was only one man and one woman so
[57:35] Satan attacked the very first design of
[57:39] God that he placed upon the Earth in
[57:42] that he pulled the woman out of her
[57:44] position but first he had to pull an
[57:48] instrument out of its position that
[57:51] instrument was a very curious instrument
[57:53] it was an animal which was the closest
[57:57] one to the human being now we know that
[58:00] man is a warm-blooded animal which makes
[58:02] him a mammal but yet here was the the
[58:04] one that was closest to the man now he
[58:08] had a a place for a soul but he didn't
[58:11] have a soul but he had blood that was so
[58:14] close to the human being he could think
[58:17] he could reason he could talk he had an
[58:20] ability about him that he was not like a
[58:23] donkey or like a horse or a cat or cow
[58:26] but he was something so similar and God
[58:30] made him of course that way as the
[58:32] missing way so Satan's Next Step was to
[58:36] get to what God's next unfolding stage
[58:39] was the family God was not satisfied
[58:42] with just the man and his wife so God
[58:44] was going to unfold it further into a
[58:47] family so Satan thought he beat God to
[58:50] the program
[58:52] so what does he do he goes to the woman
[58:54] through which God was going to bring
[58:57] forth she was the channel by which God
[58:59] was going to expand this creation on the
[59:02] earth and use her as to propagate the
[59:05] family so Satan beat Adam to this woman
[59:09] then Satan becomes as we know the father
[59:13] of Cain is this right according to the
[59:15] Bible he was of the wicked one the Bible
[59:18] never cause Cain the son of Adam
[59:22] and the church said he was of the wicked
[59:26] one which in case you don't know it was
[59:28] not Adam so what did Satan want to do he
[59:32] wanted to interrupt God's program so
[59:35] every institution then that God chose
[59:38] Satan hates it and despises it he knows
[59:42] he can never stop the real Church of the
[59:45] Living God he knew you know whenever he
[59:47] was there for the first few years in the
[59:48] book of Acts it's like he was learning
[59:51] because God was bringing forth something
[59:53] totally new he could see the type in the
[59:56] Old Testament he could see God choosing
[59:57] Israel and saw that God had was was
[1:00:00] going to do something special with a
[1:00:02] group of people and and a type of that
[1:00:05] they were a church for sure but coming
[1:00:07] on the day of Pentecost God started
[1:00:09] something that was relatively new and
[1:00:12] that God had come down and unveiled
[1:00:14] himself in human beings and then Jesus
[1:00:16] had begun to give little excerpts of the
[1:00:19] identity of this new move when Jesus was
[1:00:22] the first one one to say in Matthew Upon
[1:00:24] This Rock I will build my Church okay so
[1:00:29] Satan hears this for the first time now
[1:00:32] the New Testament is where he begins to
[1:00:34] hear this reiterated over and over again
[1:00:36] so Satan you'll imagine he don't even
[1:00:38] know what a church is because he's never
[1:00:40] exactly seen one there was no New
[1:00:43] Testament Church so he hears Jesus say
[1:00:45] church he hears Jesus say it again he
[1:00:48] hears the disciples as they begin to
[1:00:50] discuss it so he doesn't yet really know
[1:00:52] what it is so he sees the Lord Jesus as
[1:00:55] he ascends up into heaven and he sees
[1:00:57] the disciples as they're trying to
[1:00:59] figure out what do we do where do we go
[1:01:00] we don't know what to do so he sees them
[1:01:03] as they go to the upper room and they
[1:01:05] begin to tear they begin to wait he's
[1:01:07] not even sure how long they don't know
[1:01:08] how long they're praying they're waiting
[1:01:10] they begin to discuss maybe we've got it
[1:01:13] maybe we've already got it we just don't
[1:01:15] know it yet but then he began to hear a
[1:01:18] sound Come From Heaven
[1:01:20] and it come on a certain day a certain
[1:01:23] day that was absolutely prophetic and
[1:01:26] the Bible tells us when the day of
[1:01:28] Pentecost was fully come now remember
[1:01:31] this was named not after the Pentecostal
[1:01:34] experience it was already called
[1:01:37] Pentecost before they got the Holy Ghost
[1:01:39] so the Feast of Pentecost had been
[1:01:42] celebrated for hundreds and hundreds and
[1:01:45] hundreds of years before acts 2. so it
[1:01:49] was the Feast of the in gathering and it
[1:01:52] was of course seven sabbaths after the
[1:01:54] waving of the sheep that happened upon
[1:01:57] the day of atonement or Yom Kippur so
[1:01:59] here the spirit of God descends on this
[1:02:02] certain day and they begin to stagger
[1:02:05] around like drunk people and they were
[1:02:07] speaking in tongues and it was tongues
[1:02:09] that they never heard before they never
[1:02:11] knew and the miracle was not only them
[1:02:14] speaking in tongues but say I would have
[1:02:16] been there you would have been there you
[1:02:18] would have been there and there was
[1:02:19] Parsons and Greeks and all the rest of
[1:02:22] these people and they were outside and
[1:02:24] they heard us and we stagger out and
[1:02:27] we're just going on and on and speaking
[1:02:29] and speaking and we'll say brother Jim
[1:02:31] was a Greek and I I'm you know I'm Simon
[1:02:35] Peter I didn't know one word of Greek
[1:02:37] and I'm standing up I'm praising God
[1:02:39] worshiping God and what am I doing I'm
[1:02:42] speaking Greek and brother Jim Hughes
[1:02:44] hears me say my Lord that's my language
[1:02:48] well here was another guy from Syria and
[1:02:50] another from Lebanon and another one
[1:02:53] from here there there now they knew that
[1:02:56] these guys were ignorant and unlearned
[1:02:58] they knew they wasn't a theologian among
[1:03:01] them they knew they barely knew Hebrew
[1:03:03] much less any other languages can't you
[1:03:06] see why God will use sometimes people
[1:03:08] that are ignorant and unlearned I'm glad
[1:03:11] he's still using this the same kind
[1:03:13] so Satan you imagine on the day of
[1:03:15] Pentecost he didn't know what to make of
[1:03:17] it all he's trying to figure out what in
[1:03:19] the world is this now he didn't know
[1:03:21] that God had already sowed invisible
[1:03:25] predestinated seeds inside the hearts of
[1:03:28] these individuals that started out with
[1:03:30] 120 and then it starts multiplying
[1:03:33] getting greater and greater but as it
[1:03:36] starts we see a number that comes up
[1:03:39] right along side by side with these
[1:03:42] which was the original ones that
[1:03:44] received the Holy Ghost but what you
[1:03:46] find is the Bible says that there was
[1:03:48] added to the church so many but the
[1:03:51] Bible doesn't say they got the Holy
[1:03:53] Ghost
[1:03:54] now Wayne oh that there were others at
[1:03:56] the house of Cornelius and others and
[1:03:59] whenever they went there and the
[1:04:01] apostolic way of receiving the Holy
[1:04:03] Ghost was by the hands of the Apostles
[1:04:06] is that right so whenever they went
[1:04:08] there some of them would speak in
[1:04:10] tongues some of them would prophesy but
[1:04:13] they took note about every one of these
[1:04:15] people that they all had a life change
[1:04:18] now and then Satan as he was watching
[1:04:21] because he's trying to pick up the
[1:04:24] methodology of God he don't understand
[1:04:26] it we imagine he heard them guys speak
[1:04:29] in tongues and they were shagging around
[1:04:31] like drunk men well we go to the house
[1:04:33] of Cornelius and we see them and their
[1:04:36] experience was a little bit different
[1:04:38] and no doubt the devil's taught what in
[1:04:40] the world is going on well whenever we
[1:04:43] come to Acts chapter 10 and we come to
[1:04:46] some of the other examples in the word
[1:04:48] you don't see to where it was exactly
[1:04:50] the same every time that they spoke in
[1:04:53] Greek or Aramaic or Hebrew or Syrian or
[1:04:57] whatever it was but it was a little bit
[1:04:59] different I wish somebody would hear me
[1:05:02] tonight
[1:05:02] now you know that's what really bothers
[1:05:05] me sometimes is that people want
[1:05:07] everybody to act just like them or they
[1:05:11] think their church is the model Church
[1:05:14] in the message and everybody
[1:05:16] ought to act like their Church well I
[1:05:18] don't even want you to act like me much
[1:05:21] less some other Church to be honest with
[1:05:23] you friends every church has its
[1:05:26] personality and the people who come to
[1:05:28] that church is what makes up the
[1:05:30] personality of that church just like
[1:05:32] your family so when it was you and your
[1:05:35] husband then you was a certain
[1:05:37] personality in your home that was the
[1:05:40] congenial mixing together of you and him
[1:05:42] he come from a certain normal in his
[1:05:45] family you come from a certain normal in
[1:05:47] your family then what did you all do you
[1:05:50] came together in one household one
[1:05:51] apartment one trailer whatever it was
[1:05:54] and you started creating a new normal
[1:05:57] for you well your mom and dad started
[1:05:59] noticing those things you all done the
[1:06:01] way you eat supper what time you ate
[1:06:03] supper everything they noticed it wasn't
[1:06:05] the way they raised you well no because
[1:06:08] you've got another person over there
[1:06:10] that also has another normal too so then
[1:06:13] you all start creating your new normal
[1:06:15] now that new normal will exist until a
[1:06:19] little one comes along then when that
[1:06:21] little one comes along he turns your
[1:06:23] normal or she upside down
[1:06:26] how many of your parents can say Amen to
[1:06:29] that
[1:06:30] then whenever another one comes along
[1:06:32] then that one kind of changes your Norm
[1:06:34] well it's the same way with churches
[1:06:36] well somebody will move here from there
[1:06:38] and somebody will get saved and they've
[1:06:40] got their background under this and that
[1:06:42] and the other you know and a lot of
[1:06:43] times people think the way they are they
[1:06:46] attribute it to how spiritual they are
[1:06:48] but if you would have seen them on this
[1:06:50] out there in the world you would see a
[1:06:52] lot of the very same things you see
[1:06:54] about them now they used to do that same
[1:06:57] thing for the devil now some of y'all
[1:06:59] used to ride them old hog motorcycles
[1:07:01] and you wore them leather jackets man
[1:07:03] you're a higher blue in the wind so when
[1:07:06] you come to church you know they don't
[1:07:07] have a leather jacket or a
[1:07:09] Harley-Davidson but you're one of the
[1:07:10] wildest people in church and yet some of
[1:07:13] you totally attribute all of that to the
[1:07:15] Holy Ghost you need not to take a little
[1:07:18] walk down memory lane and think back to
[1:07:20] where you were back then now you see the
[1:07:22] problem is when we want to take
[1:07:24] ourselves as the example and judge
[1:07:27] everybody else by us well I I'm the only
[1:07:30] spiritual one and Word of Life everybody
[1:07:33] else is dead compared to who
[1:07:37] I said compared to who well praise the
[1:07:41] lord well then other people over there
[1:07:43] is Pentecostal compared to who you see
[1:07:46] whenever we go to using ourself as the
[1:07:49] example instead of using God's word as
[1:07:52] the example that's what we do we create
[1:07:54] our own little organization
[1:07:58] and that everybody that acts like us
[1:08:00] belongs in our little organization well
[1:08:02] I didn't know I was going to go this way
[1:08:04] tonight but apparently the Lord knew
[1:08:06] that we needed it
[1:08:08] amen
[1:08:10] now you see the thing that God wanted
[1:08:12] was to be able to have a place among his
[1:08:15] people so God begins to give Moses all
[1:08:18] the design of the Tabernacle and he
[1:08:20] begins to declare the particulars of
[1:08:23] what size he wants it to be he wants it
[1:08:26] to be three-dimensional outer Court
[1:08:27] inner quote and the holiest of holies
[1:08:30] but he doesn't tell him just to bring
[1:08:31] whatever they want to whatever type of
[1:08:34] wood whatever type of material but God
[1:08:36] designates certain material God
[1:08:39] designates certain colors now God did
[1:08:43] not want them to pick whatever color
[1:08:45] they like now maybe somebody there
[1:08:47] didn't like blue God didn't ask their
[1:08:50] opinion if they like blue or not God
[1:08:53] designated blue and God designated
[1:08:56] scarlet and God designated of the
[1:08:59] metallurgical family what that is is
[1:09:01] different types of metals so God said I
[1:09:04] want you to use silver for the sockets
[1:09:07] now the sockets were set so when the
[1:09:09] posts come up on on the side and that
[1:09:11] have a little thing on the top and there
[1:09:13] was a socket so the socket was the place
[1:09:15] by which the ball on the Mast standing
[1:09:18] up on the side would fit into it so you
[1:09:20] watch then what Redemption does
[1:09:22] Redemption is the recipient to be able
[1:09:25] to join the two together they were not
[1:09:27] made of gold but they were made of
[1:09:30] silver they were not made of brass they
[1:09:32] were made of silver so then silver
[1:09:34] speaks of redemption but then the altar
[1:09:38] was not to be made out of silver and the
[1:09:41] holy of holies the cherubims were not to
[1:09:43] be made out of brass but they were to be
[1:09:46] made out of gold so what if Moses said
[1:09:48] you know you know what God I really
[1:09:50] think you could use a little bit of help
[1:09:51] with interior design work now it just so
[1:09:55] happens that we've got a few ladies that
[1:09:57] used to decorate the palace down in
[1:09:59] Egypt and they decorate they come from
[1:10:02] egyptology I mean they are some of the
[1:10:04] best in all the land of Egypt so I have
[1:10:07] appointed them to help us decorate the
[1:10:10] Tabernacle of God now they honestly
[1:10:13] think that instead of using blue it
[1:10:15] would be more pleasant if he went with
[1:10:18] some more neutral color because in their
[1:10:21] view God this blue is only a Time color
[1:10:25] it will go out in time God never asked
[1:10:29] for their opinion
[1:10:30] now you're what I find amazing is a lot
[1:10:33] of people would say Amen to the
[1:10:34] statements that I just made but yet when
[1:10:37] it comes to the Church of the Living God
[1:10:38] in the New Testament they want to assume
[1:10:41] that they have the right to tell God in
[1:10:44] the New Testament what to make his
[1:10:46] church out of in the New Testament well
[1:10:49] you know what I ain't too smart but I
[1:10:51] figure if God didn't want their opinion
[1:10:52] in the old he don't want ours in the new
[1:10:55] so God don't want membership God don't
[1:10:57] want denomination God don't want shaken
[1:11:00] the preacher's hand put your name on the
[1:11:02] church book what does God want Holy
[1:11:04] Ghost fill people
[1:11:07] Born Again experience now notice then so
[1:11:11] the mother and the father don't have an
[1:11:13] experience with God and then it's handed
[1:11:16] down by heredity to their children so
[1:11:19] your daddy's got the Holy Ghost your
[1:11:20] mama's got the Holy Ghost and you come
[1:11:22] in automatically because Mom and Daddy
[1:11:24] said no the way it's designed by God the
[1:11:27] master builder is that every person in
[1:11:30] the body must be born again well why is
[1:11:33] that necessary it's because the material
[1:11:36] that he is gathering comes from a
[1:11:40] converted Soul you see it's not coming
[1:11:43] from an intellectual conception of the
[1:11:45] Gospel well I come up to the Altar and I
[1:11:48] had the minister to pray for me and I
[1:11:50] give my life to Christ now that means so
[1:11:53] many things to so many different people
[1:11:55] and that is a story but that is not what
[1:11:58] God is looking for for the material God
[1:12:00] does not just want confessions now when
[1:12:03] a person comes I confess I am a sinner I
[1:12:06] am lost without God Lord Jesus say me
[1:12:08] that is a confession stone that is a
[1:12:11] storm but what is that a lot of people
[1:12:13] all they amount to and they gather them
[1:12:16] together in churches by the hundreds of
[1:12:17] heaps so it's one that saved here one
[1:12:20] saved there one saved there but the
[1:12:22] prophet likened that to stones and their
[1:12:24] power and a big pile but they don't want
[1:12:27] to be shaped by a stonemason so a stone
[1:12:31] Mason now for those of you that's got a
[1:12:33] good eye you'll be able to look at these
[1:12:35] pillars right here and this one up here
[1:12:37] behind me and you'll be able to see that
[1:12:39] all of these Stones didn't just fall
[1:12:41] into place like that so whenever you go
[1:12:44] to land I'm according to your style you
[1:12:46] will lay a certain pattern you're going
[1:12:48] to land out you're going to create holes
[1:12:50] you're going to create holes and you
[1:12:52] know it might be that four inch square
[1:12:54] one there might be that five inch one on
[1:12:56] the bottom but you're going to lay it
[1:12:58] out through there and you've got to keep
[1:12:59] an eye on it make sure it don't go do
[1:13:01] this that on you because it'll get
[1:13:03] crooked and then you're going to leave
[1:13:05] some holes somewhere and you can look
[1:13:07] and look and look all you want to but
[1:13:09] you ain't going to find no Rock that's
[1:13:11] going to fit every one of them holds so
[1:13:13] you know what you're gonna have to do
[1:13:14] you're gonna have to cut that raw now
[1:13:16] you're going to take a diamond side
[1:13:18] cutter or you can get a wet saw which
[1:13:20] mother David hair let us use and you run
[1:13:22] that saw now that stone through that saw
[1:13:24] and you can put it up if you wish with
[1:13:27] that straight edge that you just cut but
[1:13:30] if you'll notice these Stones they are
[1:13:32] made to where they have accents and dips
[1:13:35] and adjacent points that stick out on
[1:13:37] the side and a trained eye will go right
[1:13:39] to that stone and say that stone is cut
[1:13:42] so when brother Dave and I were laying
[1:13:44] these Stones whenever we weren't doing
[1:13:46] it the horrible God of course we had to
[1:13:47] get up and have brothers to do it for us
[1:13:49] so they would cut the stone and we would
[1:13:52] call down I need a four inch or three
[1:13:54] and a half inches long I need a five
[1:13:56] inch or seven inches long well maybe
[1:13:58] they come in nine inches or ten inches
[1:14:00] or 12 inches well we ain't got one well
[1:14:03] cut me one well they cut it they run it
[1:14:06] through the saw and then they take a
[1:14:08] little chisel and then they go to
[1:14:10] chipping on the end of that so when you
[1:14:13] look at it most of you won't be able to
[1:14:15] know which one was cut and it'll look
[1:14:18] like a positive say how did they get
[1:14:20] that all together Blood Sweat and Tears
[1:14:25] had a wet saw now to make it look that
[1:14:28] way so it it looks does it not look
[1:14:30] beautiful yeah it looks really nice well
[1:14:33] you think wow man Dave about David how
[1:14:35] did they do that that looks like it all
[1:14:37] just fit well it looks that way but that
[1:14:39] wasn't quite the way it happened and
[1:14:41] it's the same way with the body of God
[1:14:43] which is the habitation of the Holy
[1:14:46] Ghost now people look and say oh my look
[1:14:48] at them Believers praise the lord lord
[1:14:51] they are good strong people they love
[1:14:53] the Lord they trust him oh you ought to
[1:14:55] seen this when he found us you ought to
[1:14:57] see this when he first got a hold of us
[1:14:59] you ought to seen us a year actually got
[1:15:02] saved or maybe five years after we got
[1:15:04] saved you ought to seen us 20 years
[1:15:06] people look at a preacher and say wow my
[1:15:09] goodness look how God's blessed them
[1:15:11] look at this and that and the other yeah
[1:15:13] you ought to been with me and my wife
[1:15:17] y'all have been with us years ago when
[1:15:19] was traveling around in a tent and
[1:15:22] staying in a pup tent
[1:15:25] in the rain in the storms
[1:15:28] didn't have enough money to buy food so
[1:15:31] we waited on people who visited the tent
[1:15:34] meetings to bring us food
[1:15:37] and if they didn't bring us much we
[1:15:40] didn't have much did we Harry
[1:15:43] I preached in places before and you
[1:15:45] didn't have the money for a hotel and if
[1:15:48] people didn't put you up well you
[1:15:51] sweating your vehicle you just done what
[1:15:52] you had to do
[1:15:55] and people look oh my my look at them
[1:15:57] now look at them now take a trip with me
[1:16:00] down the road though
[1:16:01] and then people look at you and they get
[1:16:04] jealous of what you are now and they
[1:16:06] don't want to look back at all the years
[1:16:08] of the chipping and the and the saw and
[1:16:11] same way with you not just a preacher
[1:16:12] now but the same way of you as a child
[1:16:15] of God those of you that are talented to
[1:16:18] sing or play music or whatever it is and
[1:16:20] God's called you and placed you in the
[1:16:22] body people say oh I'd love to sing like
[1:16:24] that I love to be able to play the piano
[1:16:26] like brother laying out but you love to
[1:16:28] be able to be here on all the hours that
[1:16:30] he comes and practices with the people
[1:16:32] would you love to be here with all the
[1:16:34] brothers that do the sound equipment and
[1:16:36] the lights and this and that and the
[1:16:38] other people saw I'd love to be this and
[1:16:41] that a lot of times what we want is the
[1:16:43] glory we don't want the chipping part
[1:16:47] oh praise the Lord
[1:16:49] now if you would have been in here and
[1:16:51] some of you were because I saw you as
[1:16:54] you visited and I had a machine over
[1:16:56] here and brother Dave had one over here
[1:16:58] and there's rocks laid around us
[1:17:00] everywhere and you would have seen bits
[1:17:03] and pieces of rock and shattered pieces
[1:17:05] and when you go to chipping it all it's
[1:17:07] it's without doubt some of it you're
[1:17:10] absolutely going to break them and hey
[1:17:11] and when you do and yet you look at it
[1:17:14] say wow what a finish work oh everything
[1:17:16] just come together wow did they have
[1:17:18] something to go by not really no some of
[1:17:21] it just come together as it did but you
[1:17:24] see God had something to go by and it
[1:17:27] was a master plan so it started
[1:17:30] unfolding that plan in the Old Testament
[1:17:32] in the book of Exodus in order to start
[1:17:35] making a house a tabernacle a tent I
[1:17:38] want you to notice what God called that
[1:17:40] tent he called it a tent of the
[1:17:44] congregation wait a minute I thought God
[1:17:46] is going to live in there why would God
[1:17:48] call it a 10 event of the congregation
[1:17:51] or a tabernacle of the congregation I
[1:17:54] thought it was supposed to be the
[1:17:55] Tabernacle of the Lord why would God
[1:17:58] name it after his people now remember it
[1:18:02] never was given a human name in order to
[1:18:05] personify to make it a living thing they
[1:18:07] they leaned too much toward idolatry
[1:18:09] anyway and the Shekinah Glory of God
[1:18:12] came down into this place and there they
[1:18:15] knew God was there and he was there for
[1:18:18] it many many years but God of course
[1:18:20] this was not ultimately where he wanted
[1:18:23] to go notice with me in Isaiah 57 15 for
[1:18:27] thus saith the high and lofty one that
[1:18:29] inhabiteth eternity whose name is Holy I
[1:18:33] dwell in the high and holy place with
[1:18:36] him also that is of a contrite and a
[1:18:40] humble spirit all my to revive the
[1:18:43] spirit of the humble to revive the heart
[1:18:46] of the contrite ones so God God wanted
[1:18:50] to even in this shadow in the book of
[1:18:53] Isaiah God wanted to let them know now
[1:18:55] they probably tried to read this and
[1:18:57] think what is God meaning what is God
[1:19:00] actually getting that notice he says
[1:19:02] that I dwell in the high and lofty place
[1:19:05] with him that is of a contrite and
[1:19:08] humble Spirit God dwells in the high and
[1:19:11] lofty place with him that is of a humble
[1:19:14] and contrite spirit to revive the heart
[1:19:18] of the contrite once so as the
[1:19:21] Tabernacle was made of different
[1:19:24] material
[1:19:25] of Timber some of shittim wood some of
[1:19:29] gold some of silver some of purple some
[1:19:32] of blue different colors reflecting
[1:19:34] different things the blue of the
[1:19:36] Heavenly of course the Royal being that
[1:19:38] of divinity and the kingly
[1:19:40] representation and so when we come to
[1:19:43] the New Testament then that the Lord
[1:19:45] Jesus also purposed to make a body now
[1:19:49] it's not this this is not the place
[1:19:52] where when we walk out of here that God
[1:19:54] dwells in here if you come in here and
[1:19:56] you're here you can hear him tall and
[1:19:59] you can hear God say things oh sure come
[1:20:01] in here and pray if you wish to but yet
[1:20:03] this is not the house that has made God
[1:20:06] house in the book of Acts chapter 7 it
[1:20:08] says the most high does not dwell in
[1:20:11] buildings which are made by hands the
[1:20:14] reason he's here tonight is because you
[1:20:16] were here
[1:20:17] so do we consecrate this place yes
[1:20:20] should we respect it absolutely but I
[1:20:23] want you to notice in Saint John 14 23
[1:20:26] Jesus answered and said unto him if a
[1:20:29] man loved me almost up to the topic guys
[1:20:32] sorry I skipped on you a little he will
[1:20:34] keep my words and my father will love
[1:20:36] him and we will come unto him and make
[1:20:41] our Abode with him now listen to the
[1:20:44] words of the Lord Jesus when we're
[1:20:46] talking about we and us we're not
[1:20:49] talking about two Gods but we're talking
[1:20:52] about Father and Son in other words word
[1:20:56] and spirit father and son is not an old
[1:21:00] man and a young man but father is Spirit
[1:21:04] light and sun is spoken word
[1:21:09] so father God wants to indwell our
[1:21:13] bodies with both him and the sonship
[1:21:16] which his father Spirit word son he that
[1:21:21] does this has both Father and Son
[1:21:25] theologians lean more toward the logos
[1:21:28] this is why they preach mainly Christ
[1:21:31] Christ Christ Christ
[1:21:33] New Testament cross cross cross cross
[1:21:37] why they haven't gone any farther than
[1:21:40] where they're preaching just keep that
[1:21:41] in mind when you're listening to a man
[1:21:43] listen to where he preaches and see if
[1:21:45] he can lead you to a Rapture if he
[1:21:48] preaches only about the cross you better
[1:21:50] be hung you another preacher
[1:21:52] we got to hear Rapture stuff friends not
[1:21:55] just the cross
[1:21:57] now notice he that will abide in me
[1:22:01] notice the Lord Jesus as he says this if
[1:22:04] a man loved me he will keep my words and
[1:22:07] my father will love him and we will come
[1:22:11] unto him I may believe she has the
[1:22:12] spirit of God in you tonight
[1:22:14] any of y'all got the human body of the
[1:22:16] Lord Jesus in you
[1:22:21] anybody
[1:22:24] so what do you have
[1:22:27] Jesus is speaking and saying if any man
[1:22:30] will keep my words me and my father will
[1:22:33] come into him
[1:22:34] so is it two gods
[1:22:37] one of them that sits on the big throne
[1:22:39] and the other one a little God sits on
[1:22:41] the other Throne you believe in arianism
[1:22:45] he was a theologian in the first century
[1:22:48] that started coming up with this idea of
[1:22:51] messing with the godhead
[1:22:53] preaching that Jesus was less than God
[1:22:56] if for around the nazia council
[1:22:59] uh-huh but he became God now no he was
[1:23:04] God and became man
[1:23:07] and somebody said
[1:23:09] amen my Lord Jesus did not become God he
[1:23:14] was God
[1:23:15] but he become man that he might take my
[1:23:18] sins upon him
[1:23:21] so notice that he said we will make our
[1:23:24] Abode with him so we're looking at you
[1:23:27] agree with me that we is more than one
[1:23:31] we is more than one so is it two beings
[1:23:35] is it two Gods is it two separate
[1:23:39] entities one is older than the other one
[1:23:43] or is it not what Jesus said the words
[1:23:47] that I speak unto you they are spirit
[1:23:49] and life is it not what Jesus said in
[1:23:52] Saint John 4 God is a spirit and they
[1:23:57] that worship Him must worship Him in
[1:24:00] spirit and in truth in other words
[1:24:03] father and son
[1:24:06] so he that comes this way receives both
[1:24:10] father spirit and Son which is worth
[1:24:14] theologians will only come toward the
[1:24:17] logos which is the son the fanatical
[1:24:20] emotional type only one the spirit but
[1:24:23] we want both I want both Father and Son
[1:24:27] now I hope you understand what I'm
[1:24:28] saying I have both Father and Son living
[1:24:32] in me tonight you say what are you
[1:24:34] talking about I've got the Father which
[1:24:37] is the spirit I have the son which is
[1:24:41] the word which is quickened by the power
[1:24:45] of the father so all glory to God both
[1:24:49] Father and Son spirit and quick and word
[1:24:52] is what will take the Rapture now this
[1:24:56] is what he is looking for to build his
[1:24:59] house out of in this day he started it
[1:25:02] in the book of Acts out of the material
[1:25:05] that he wanted so they did not take cold
[1:25:07] dead theologians he did not take people
[1:25:09] that just run and shout and jumped all
[1:25:11] the time and didn't want no teaching of
[1:25:13] the word but we realized from the book
[1:25:16] of Acts 2 they jumped they shouted they
[1:25:18] hollered they spoke in tongues but they
[1:25:20] also knew about the doctrines of the
[1:25:22] word of God I find this so amazing that
[1:25:25] Peter started out to be an ignorant and
[1:25:27] an unlearned man the prophet of God
[1:25:29] tells us he couldn't even sign his name
[1:25:31] but when you get time I'd like for you
[1:25:34] to read the Epistle of Peter
[1:25:37] and when you do you are truly going to
[1:25:40] read a miracle because you're going to
[1:25:43] read and you're going to say where did
[1:25:45] this man get this understanding where
[1:25:48] did this man learn how to write where
[1:25:50] did this man get the ability to use some
[1:25:53] of these words every time you hear
[1:25:55] Brother Joel Farney preach you say
[1:25:57] another miracle because only first God
[1:26:00] saved he couldn't read either he
[1:26:02] couldn't even read the Bible and how did
[1:26:05] he learn to read by preaching God's word
[1:26:08] so what'd he get both father and son I
[1:26:11] don't want just the son the dead cold
[1:26:14] letter I don't want your spirit I want
[1:26:16] Father and Son Spirit now down to him
[1:26:20] which is invisible Immortal the only
[1:26:23] wise God the Dominion power and Glory
[1:26:26] forever remember father God is not a man
[1:26:30] when will we ever grasp this God is not
[1:26:34] a man he is not a human being God is a
[1:26:40] spirit
[1:26:43] oh what a Unity that Jesus Promised in
[1:26:47] this notice so both Father and Son again
[1:26:51] in Saint John 17 23 I and them and thou
[1:26:55] and me that they may be made perfect in
[1:26:59] one and that the world may know that
[1:27:02] thou Hast sent me so how is the world
[1:27:05] going to know that God the spirit sent
[1:27:09] Jesus The Living Word when we become in
[1:27:12] perfect Oneness you see it's not just
[1:27:15] handing out tracks it's not just saying
[1:27:17] well I I believe every word of the Bible
[1:27:19] I believe every bit of it no that's not
[1:27:21] the way they will know how many of them
[1:27:23] still don't know to this very night it's
[1:27:25] when the Oneness of God Is So made
[1:27:28] manifest and Perfection well then if you
[1:27:30] were the devil and you heard this what
[1:27:33] would you try to do what would you try
[1:27:35] to do you would try to stop that church
[1:27:38] which you're not from being that perfect
[1:27:41] Oneness and then if you saw a body if
[1:27:44] you saw a family if you saw a group that
[1:27:48] was heading toward that Oneness what
[1:27:51] would you do you would do everything in
[1:27:54] your power to try to divide them
[1:27:57] that's what he does to families they
[1:27:59] don't just get a church in mind but
[1:28:01] that's what he does to families Satan
[1:28:03] can't stand it when husbands love their
[1:28:05] wives and wives loves their husbands and
[1:28:07] children love their parents and they
[1:28:09] have a unit and they come to the house
[1:28:11] of God and they worship and they love
[1:28:13] and they serve the Lord you watch The
[1:28:15] Devil he will set his sights on them he
[1:28:18] will attack them like no other family in
[1:28:20] the same community
[1:28:22] if all hell will break loose it'll
[1:28:24] attack that family like nobody else why
[1:28:27] he hates God's original choice and when
[1:28:31] he sees the family whether you're rich
[1:28:33] whether you're poor whether you've got
[1:28:35] land or ain't got no land if you've read
[1:28:37] every day of your life for 75 years of
[1:28:40] your life you can have this Oneness with
[1:28:42] God which makes you more wealthy than
[1:28:45] the greatest man on the Earth
[1:28:48] praise be to God
[1:28:53] notice this
[1:28:54] in verse 26 and I had declared unto them
[1:28:58] thy name
[1:28:59] and will declare it
[1:29:03] so what name did Jesus say
[1:29:08] so did Jesus go around and saying I
[1:29:10] declare the name of Adonai
[1:29:13] I declare the name of that or him
[1:29:16] El Shaddai Jehovah Jehovah Shalom
[1:29:19] Jehovah Rapha Jehovah Nissi Jesus never
[1:29:23] quoted any of those
[1:29:25] but yet according to him we believe what
[1:29:27] he said right I have declared thy name
[1:29:31] but remember name to the Hebrews meant
[1:29:33] more than saying Donnie or Joe or Fred
[1:29:36] the word name comes from the Hebrew word
[1:29:38] in the Old Testament and it means your
[1:29:41] reputation or your character
[1:29:44] so Jesus declared the reputation of God
[1:29:48] the character of God
[1:29:52] amen and he bore the human Redemptive
[1:29:55] name of God which was Yeshua or Jesus
[1:30:00] notice I have declared unto them thy
[1:30:03] name and will declare that the love
[1:30:05] we're with thou Hast loved me may be in
[1:30:10] them you mean the Lord Jesus wants the
[1:30:14] father God to love us in the way he
[1:30:17] loved the sonship
[1:30:21] that love may be in them and I in them
[1:30:25] now watch Ephesians chapter 2 verse 22
[1:30:28] and whom ye also are building together
[1:30:32] for a habitation of God through the
[1:30:36] father
[1:30:37] the spirit
[1:30:39] whom you are built so what is the
[1:30:42] mechanics then what is the building
[1:30:44] material
[1:30:47] what's the material
[1:30:49] what's the material in this carpet
[1:30:52] Walnut the fur all different types of
[1:30:56] wood carpet metal in the chairs foam on
[1:31:00] the padding all types of different
[1:31:02] material steel aluminum concrete paint
[1:31:06] all over this whole building it's all
[1:31:10] types of different materials would it be
[1:31:13] good to put the steel here
[1:31:16] would it be good for me to try to stand
[1:31:18] up and preach on a steel beam
[1:31:22] now I can remember when I was a young
[1:31:24] fella many years ago the anointing hit
[1:31:27] me one night brother hell and the
[1:31:29] Holiness Church I went to and I took off
[1:31:32] running they had pews
[1:31:34] I walked the backs of them
[1:31:41] don't try this at home
[1:31:46] now like a streak alive
[1:31:49] jump off the back and jumped up and run
[1:31:52] back
[1:31:54] dare say it better be the Lord now if I
[1:31:56] do it
[1:32:03] and God takes material
[1:32:08] and he gives some one way and some
[1:32:11] another way
[1:32:12] and sometimes things that we think are
[1:32:15] so contrasting but yet I'm really glad
[1:32:18] those beams up there are made of steel
[1:32:21] instead of marshmallows
[1:32:25] wouldn't that be scary
[1:32:27] are you all glad with me
[1:32:29] I'm glad that's some real strong being
[1:32:32] boys some of them great or big things
[1:32:34] great big ones right there and you think
[1:32:36] they're pretty Decor you think that's
[1:32:37] just there for pretty that's there to
[1:32:39] hide them great big steel beams that's
[1:32:42] holding this thing up I'm glad we've got
[1:32:45] an architecture that that architect God
[1:32:47] that went through all of it in the
[1:32:49] stress load check this and check that
[1:32:51] and he'll have to sign off on this thing
[1:32:53] when we finally get our final uh
[1:32:55] completion of it all and say that yet
[1:32:57] everyone was tested every Speck of
[1:33:00] concrete that we poured we had to have
[1:33:02] the city's approval so they come out and
[1:33:05] take so much of the concrete and take it
[1:33:07] back to the laboratory and test to make
[1:33:10] sure that it meets the right kind of
[1:33:12] pressure well that's kind of the way God
[1:33:14] is doing his bride God takes his bride
[1:33:17] back to the laboratory the word God
[1:33:19] sometimes really cranks down on the
[1:33:22] pressure I've got a receipt for every
[1:33:24] check that I wrote plus the ones brother
[1:33:26] John babbro whenever he was taken care
[1:33:28] of all of that and I made I don't know
[1:33:30] how many out to this company so they
[1:33:32] could test every load of concrete I'm
[1:33:35] thinking they're ripping us off I don't
[1:33:37] like paying them much money so I asked
[1:33:40] that God one day why am I having a pass
[1:33:43] he said because I don't want you to get
[1:33:45] bad concrete he said because if you'd
[1:33:48] seen some of the concrete that I've seen
[1:33:50] poured in buildings and in floors and
[1:33:52] for Footers you'd be glad I said I'm so
[1:33:55] glad I'm writing these checks for this
[1:33:57] concrete
[1:33:59] I don't like trials no more than you do
[1:34:02] I don't like trying times I don't like
[1:34:05] tests that you go through there are
[1:34:07] sometimes you don't know if you're going
[1:34:08] to make it or not come on somebody
[1:34:09] preach with me but oh brother I want my
[1:34:13] life to be so God can put a sticker as
[1:34:16] it were on my life and say he passed the
[1:34:19] test amen he passed the test I want to
[1:34:23] tell you friends the floor you're
[1:34:25] setting on past the test the mezzanine
[1:34:28] passed the test the foundation passed
[1:34:31] the test the sidewalk past the test well
[1:34:34] that's real good for the building but I
[1:34:37] want to pass the test to but I've tried
[1:34:40] when I'm testing when I go through
[1:34:42] things I don't understand I want God to
[1:34:46] be able to put that stick around and say
[1:34:48] Donnie you passed
[1:34:51] daddy you passed
[1:35:00] oh I love this one Paul
[1:35:03] must have been astounding
[1:35:06] to the Believers of that day
[1:35:08] now you imagine by now the book of
[1:35:11] Ephesians is written around 58.
[1:35:15] 58 to 60 A.D so the church is not even
[1:35:19] 30 years old yet
[1:35:21] so they're they're hearing these things
[1:35:23] and Satan Harry is still learning now
[1:35:25] but now he's already got himself a
[1:35:27] church too so God wanted a church if he
[1:35:30] can't stop the church what he's got to
[1:35:32] do is name him one
[1:35:34] except just keep them from getting the
[1:35:37] Holy Ghost
[1:35:39] well as a matter of fact the prophet
[1:35:41] said they started on the day of
[1:35:42] Pentecost the Catholic Church said
[1:35:44] well every time I say that people look
[1:35:45] at me like I don't know what
[1:35:49] start on the day Pentecost yeah not the
[1:35:51] ones in the upper room the others that
[1:35:53] didn't get the Holy Ghost
[1:35:58] so God wanted to make a habitation for
[1:36:00] the spirit of God and it would be a
[1:36:03] building
[1:36:04] that would grow all over the world
[1:36:06] all over the world it's unbelievable
[1:36:09] some of the Nations that I've been to in
[1:36:11] the world they don't have electricity
[1:36:12] they don't have toilets in their house
[1:36:15] some of them don't have running water
[1:36:18] but they have books
[1:36:20] tapes
[1:36:22] Bibles
[1:36:23] healing in the sick
[1:36:25] casting out devils
[1:36:28] even lepers getting healed
[1:36:31] and it ain't just the preachers
[1:36:33] a lot of them don't do like some of the
[1:36:35] lazy Americans to think well we pay the
[1:36:38] preacher to do our praying for us we pay
[1:36:41] the preacher to heal the same we pay the
[1:36:43] preacher to do all that and all they do
[1:36:44] is come in and Nod every now and then
[1:36:49] I met the little sister in India who run
[1:36:51] out of flower
[1:36:53] I met the little sister who run out of
[1:36:55] oil and didn't have nothing to eat and
[1:36:58] the Lord God come in her house as he did
[1:37:01] the Widow of Zara pass and flourish this
[1:37:05] little sister's Cruise of oil and her
[1:37:08] flower meal until the Lord God sent rain
[1:37:11] in her province in India you see I
[1:37:14] believe he can do the same thing right
[1:37:16] here in America if we ever get to that
[1:37:19] spot oh brother Donny but we've got the
[1:37:21] welfare we've got food stamps and we've
[1:37:23] got I'm nothing against any of that at
[1:37:25] all but what if we run out of that one
[1:37:27] day our nation is busted we are bankrupt
[1:37:31] oh my remember faith is like muscles and
[1:37:35] if you don't use the muscles in your
[1:37:37] body and they will start getting so soft
[1:37:40] and you get to where you can't lift
[1:37:42] nothing you can't do nothing is that
[1:37:44] right you all know that you've dealt
[1:37:46] with people in your family or friends
[1:37:48] and they become bedridden and they get
[1:37:50] to where they can't hardly walk they can
[1:37:52] hardly lift nothing why because her
[1:37:55] muscles and their body are losing that
[1:37:57] ability to live and then the doctors
[1:37:59] will tell them well we've got to put you
[1:38:00] in therapy we've got to give you therapy
[1:38:02] what do they do well they go to lift and
[1:38:04] they go to moving around that's the way
[1:38:06] faith is sometimes our Faith's muscle we
[1:38:09] just turn into a Big Blob of fat oh my
[1:38:12] goodness we just turned into a blob of
[1:38:14] fat I don't want Faith fat I want Faith
[1:38:17] muscles
[1:38:18] Hallelujah I don't want to look like a
[1:38:21] polar bear where I'm just a girl around
[1:38:23] with fat all over me but I want my
[1:38:26] muscles whenever they tense up that the
[1:38:28] devil says watch out boys that dude is
[1:38:30] bad I'm telling you that dude has been
[1:38:33] lifting them barbells watching Hebrews
[1:38:35] 13 8 Saint John 15 7 Psalms 37 1-4
[1:38:39] Psalms 103 verse 3. oh yeah it ain't
[1:38:43] easy and it makes us really difficult
[1:38:46] and really tired when we're going
[1:38:48] through it but brother sister whenever
[1:38:50] we need God in a hurry I don't want
[1:38:52] somebody praying for me that's got to go
[1:38:55] through Mary and Joseph and Saint
[1:38:57] Cecilia and somebody else I want
[1:38:59] somebody that can talk directly to the
[1:39:01] man himself and I want to know they've
[1:39:04] done it before and I want to see some
[1:39:06] muscles on their arms
[1:39:08] [Applause]
[1:39:13] so just imagine you're in a hard spot an

[1:39:37] I want somebody that's got some Faith
[1:39:40] muscles

[1:39:45] ain't nothing good within themselves but

[1:39:48] odd they'll stand with you brother

[1:41:17] [Applause]
[1:41:26] oh
[1:41:28] notice Ephesians 4 15. but speaking the
[1:41:31] truth and love
[1:41:33] May grow up
[1:41:36] grow up
[1:41:38] into him
[1:41:40] now not grow up to him
[1:41:43] but grow up
[1:41:45] into him
[1:41:49] glory to God
[1:41:51] you imagine if Satan read this he
[1:41:54] thought
[1:41:55] what in the world
[1:41:58] What could that preacher mean
[1:42:02] they're going to grow
[1:42:04] into him
[1:42:06] how is that possible
[1:42:09] I can hear them down in the hill
[1:42:12] as they called
[1:42:14] a demonic conference
[1:42:18] and he began to tell him look guys
[1:42:21] we've got our work cut out for us
[1:42:25] I thought when Jesus left
[1:42:27] we had this thing
[1:42:29] well you know how they were Peter James
[1:42:31] and John well I'll be jealous of one
[1:42:32] another wonder who had the most people
[1:42:34] streaming their services
[1:42:36] wondering who had the biggest Search
[1:42:38] Wonder this and that and the other that
[1:42:40] was going on you realize on the early
[1:42:41] days of Pentecost man those men started
[1:42:42] out really anointed they started out
[1:42:44] really anointed and you know what some
[1:42:46] of them guys will do whenever Jack Coe
[1:42:48] would get a certain size tent then some
[1:42:50] of the guys from work from some of the
[1:42:52] other big name preachers would go in the
[1:42:54] night and measure Jack Coast Tent and
[1:42:57] then order one bigger so they could say
[1:42:59] they had the biggest gospel tent in the
[1:43:00] world and then whenever they would get
[1:43:02] it it didn't last long because somebody
[1:43:03] else from or Roberts University they'd
[1:43:06] come over and measure them then they
[1:43:07] wanted the biggest gospel town in the
[1:43:09] world oh my that was what it turned into
[1:43:12] then it turned into colleges and who was
[1:43:14] the biggest and who was the greatest I
[1:43:16] look at what they produce now come on
[1:43:18] children oh I'm so glad God sent us a
[1:43:21] man that did not have an agenda I'm glad
[1:43:24] God sent us a Prophet by the day that
[1:43:27] did not want to compete with man he was
[1:43:29] not worried about him no as a matter of
[1:43:31] fact somebody stole his little gospel
[1:43:33] tent right off from under him and he let
[1:43:35] him get away with it that's a real man
[1:43:38] that's got character that don't take all
[1:43:40] of his sermons and stand up there and
[1:43:42] defend himself preach the word preach
[1:43:45] the word and God will fight for you live
[1:43:49] the word Saints and God will fight for
[1:43:52] you believe the word and God will fight
[1:43:56] your cancer for you
[1:43:58] how will he do it in your body he will
[1:44:02] fight it
[1:44:12] but speaking the truth
[1:44:15] and love
[1:44:17] May grow up into him
[1:44:20] grow up into him
[1:44:22] in all things which is the head even
[1:44:25] Christ
[1:44:27] from whom the whole body
[1:44:30] fitly joined together
[1:44:34] fitly joined together
[1:44:37] Paul hears using Carpenter's terms in
[1:44:39] the Greek
[1:44:43] so you look at this handrail here
[1:44:45] tonight
[1:44:47] cut by real fancy machine one of the
[1:44:49] brothers at the church has
[1:44:53] but we could have pile that Lumber up
[1:44:54] there this beautiful Walnut Lumber and
[1:44:57] said machine go after it
[1:44:59] but that machine couldn't
[1:45:02] but there had to be the mind of a man
[1:45:06] that programmed that machine
[1:45:08] to make these cuts
[1:45:10] these here and these here exactly the
[1:45:13] same
[1:45:14] they had to be the mind of a man same
[1:45:16] man that programmed that machine
[1:45:19] to make fish cuts
[1:45:21] now I could have made them
[1:45:24] but I'd use the jigsaw
[1:45:28] and I'd have been sanding for the rest
[1:45:29] of my life trying to get all the cuts
[1:45:30] out of it
[1:45:33] so God had it in his mind
[1:45:36] well I like this design I like this you
[1:45:40] know this radius to it
[1:45:42] and then I thought well if it got that I
[1:45:44] don't think that a square Pulpit would
[1:45:46] look right
[1:45:47] I've been pretty Square all my life you
[1:45:49] know never fit here and never fit that
[1:45:50] so I thought why not get a Pulpit that
[1:45:53] will sort of match that
[1:45:55] hey man
[1:45:57] so God thought I wanted people
[1:46:00] that'll match me
[1:46:03] I want a house
[1:46:05] I want a place to worship that'll match
[1:46:07] my house
[1:46:09] so what did God do God made him a human
[1:46:12] house on the earth and he called that
[1:46:15] human house his son amen and he called
[1:46:18] his son the logos the way and gave him
[1:46:22] the human name of redemption Jesus
[1:46:25] Christ
[1:46:26] and God said this is my first son but
[1:46:29] this ain't my last one oh Glory
[1:46:32] this is my first one but I'm going to
[1:46:35] make another at another and another and
[1:46:37] another and I'm here to tell you tonight
[1:46:39] he's still making them he's still making
[1:46:42] them he's working on me he's working on
[1:46:45] you and we're growing up into him
[1:46:51] the more we grow
[1:46:53] we grow into His Image until finally
[1:46:57] we disappear
[1:47:02] in His image
[1:47:09] completely gone
[1:47:11] [Applause]
[1:47:12] Hallelujah
[1:47:14] [Applause]
[1:47:16] let me find a place to close notice this
[1:47:19] verse 16 from whom the whole body
[1:47:23] fitly joined together
[1:47:27] now the brother who cut all this
[1:47:31] and cut all this
[1:47:33] oh I like them seems
[1:47:37] I like that
[1:47:39] tight tight
[1:47:42] several years ago this brother
[1:47:44] made a Pulpit in a certain church I was
[1:47:47] preaching
[1:47:48] it was a temporary Pulpit that was only
[1:47:50] going to last for a while
[1:47:51] but I was preaching about eternity where
[1:47:53] brother Bram said the sixteenth of an
[1:47:55] inch once they break into that 150
[1:47:57] million years of life space sixteenth of
[1:48:00] an inch he said it's about like you know
[1:48:02] just a sixteenth of an inch in eternity
[1:48:04] so I looked down that pulpit and there's
[1:48:06] some pretty good sized little cracks in
[1:48:07] there and had some filler in it and I
[1:48:09] said whoever it was built this that's
[1:48:11] about 150 million years of life space
[1:48:13] right there
[1:48:19] nobody look around
[1:48:24] oh whenever he started making this stuff
[1:48:27] I'd come in and
[1:48:30] they said what are you doing there what
[1:48:31] are you doing
[1:48:33] he didn't want me to call his name
[1:48:39] why it's it's
[1:48:45] Joy so don't you see what Satan wants to
[1:48:48] do he wants us to have a big old gap
[1:48:50] between us
[1:48:52] he wants us in our Theology and our love
[1:48:54] for one another and our forgiveness for
[1:48:56] one another oh my we got our gaps are so
[1:48:59] big we have to buy government issue
[1:49:01] caulk
[1:49:03] yeah we got about a big old caulking my
[1:49:06] goodness we may have to get that spray
[1:49:08] foam stuff that expandable kind because
[1:49:11] we're so far apart in love and we're so
[1:49:14] part of going don't get quiet on me in
[1:49:15] hell but the body of God has not made
[1:49:18] that way
[1:49:19] [Applause]
[1:49:21] if a man can make a structure like this
[1:49:24] where it's so tight you can't even
[1:49:26] hardly tell we're two separate pieces
[1:49:28] joined together
[1:49:30] right right
[1:49:32] but I was adjoined by biscuits
[1:49:38] you don't know what biscuits are
[1:49:40] not the kind you eat no no no not jelly
[1:49:44] it's a piece of wood
[1:49:46] you take a biscuit cutter and it cuts
[1:49:48] indentions in this wood and you slide
[1:49:50] that biscuit and get it wet with glue
[1:49:52] and you put it inside both parts and
[1:49:54] then you clap
[1:49:59] that's where the Lord does US sometimes
[1:50:01] he'll clamp us right next to somebody in
[1:50:03] the church we don't like
[1:50:09] and you think they have ruined my
[1:50:12] favorite seat
[1:50:14] all right
[1:50:18] now this couldn't be for the internet
[1:50:19] streamers because all of them don't go
[1:50:20] to church so it must be for somebody
[1:50:22] here tonight
[1:50:23] [Music]
[1:50:27] For Whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:50:30] together and compacted
[1:50:33] knit together
[1:50:35] to cause
[1:50:37] to coalesce
[1:50:41] let me all know what finger joints are
[1:50:44] and lumber and drawers and stuff like
[1:50:45] that
[1:50:46] just cut so fine
[1:50:49] yeah
[1:50:51] colonize together
[1:50:54] according to the effects you're working
[1:50:56] in the measure of every part so every
[1:51:00] part
[1:51:01] some little teen any parts
[1:51:04] and some bigger parts
[1:51:06] some fat parts
[1:51:08] some bikini part
[1:51:11] but in the body God
[1:51:15] hasn't put together
[1:51:17] like a car
[1:51:25] now what gets all the glory all the
[1:51:27] visual stuff the hands
[1:51:31] y'all want to know what time it is time
[1:51:32] around look
[1:51:34] the hands and the numbers
[1:51:39] but where's the power come from
[1:51:43] I don't care what name you put on them
[1:51:44] anymore most of them is battery operated
[1:51:46] from China anyway so you can call them
[1:51:48] whatever you want to
[1:51:50] many of us want the glory well I've got
[1:51:52] to be visible I've got to be out here I
[1:51:54] want that is there anybody willing to go
[1:51:56] behind the scene of the clock
[1:51:58] to go on the back part of the clock
[1:52:02] be the one who
[1:52:09] I will Lord
[1:52:13] Jesus use me
[1:52:16] you need somebody that'll be in in the
[1:52:19] low light I'd much rather be there than
[1:52:21] where I am
[1:52:24] I would that God had never called me to
[1:52:26] preach
[1:52:28] I want to go
[1:52:30] I could have been an ordinary person
[1:52:32] I went to God no one
[1:52:35] a name
[1:52:37] I would to God know Africans no Indians
[1:52:41] no one
[1:52:43] ever even heard the name Donnie Reagan
[1:52:46] me humanly I wish you'd left me alone
[1:52:50] just leave me in Kentucky
[1:52:53] alone
[1:52:57] I don't want to come here in the first
[1:52:58] place
[1:52:59] I told him so
[1:53:02] he wore me out
[1:53:04] I regretted it
[1:53:08] people who want some great big something
[1:53:11] you just keep in mind those who want it
[1:53:13] more than likely ain't called to have it
[1:53:17] it's the god that's running from it
[1:53:19] brother Dan Davis they told me years ago
[1:53:21] he said if you ever hear that brother
[1:53:24] Henry green passed away and I said
[1:53:25] where's brother Dan they said he left
[1:53:27] two days ago
[1:53:28] because he did not want that position
[1:53:30] and he was the one who got it why that's
[1:53:33] the way God's man is
[1:53:35] most of us if I'm so I wish I didn't
[1:53:38] have to go through this I wish I didn't
[1:53:39] have to go there most of the parts
[1:53:41] feel that way
[1:53:44] but look at what they turn into
[1:53:49] this well it's nice yeah it's nice but
[1:53:52] one of these days this will be turned
[1:53:55] into a nuclear
[1:53:57] Heap
[1:53:59] there'll be nothing left
[1:54:02] all of our labor all of our sweating all
[1:54:05] that we've done
[1:54:07] I'm so glad our hope
[1:54:10] is not this if this is our hope friends
[1:54:13] we're lost
[1:54:15] but I'm so glad what we're building
[1:54:17] tonight ain't this
[1:54:20] but it's this right here
[1:54:34] thank you
[1:54:36] from whom the whole body
[1:54:38] fitly joined together compacted
[1:54:41] by that which every joint
[1:54:44] Supply us
[1:54:46] do you notice the way now that Paul now
[1:54:48] he's using
[1:54:49] about construction terms but also the
[1:54:51] body
[1:54:52] so every joint supplies
[1:54:55] according to the effects you're working
[1:54:57] in the measure of every part maketh
[1:55:01] increase of the body
[1:55:03] unto the edifying of itself in love
[1:55:08] so the word compact it is to call us to
[1:55:10] coalesce join together
[1:55:13] to cause a person to unite was one
[1:55:17] in a conclusion
[1:55:20] or come to the same
[1:55:22] opinion
[1:55:25] wow
[1:55:27] so we come together in a conclusion now
[1:55:30] will all the bright people ever believe
[1:55:33] exactly the same things no they will not
[1:55:35] not before the Rapture anyway we will
[1:55:38] have our differences we will have our
[1:55:39] little ideas of this and that but that's
[1:55:42] not what we're coalesing on
[1:55:44] we're collacing on the essential parts
[1:55:46] for the rapture
[1:55:49] what is needful to get us out of this
[1:55:52] place I've been in churches all over
[1:55:54] this world Latin America Africa India
[1:55:59] Europe I have never never
[1:56:03] seen two of them
[1:56:05] that were exactly alike
[1:56:07] now you'll see similarities in the Latin
[1:56:09] America similarities in Venezuelan
[1:56:12] churches similarities in the Mexico
[1:56:14] churches similarities in the southwest
[1:56:16] churches similarities in the north
[1:56:18] similarities in Africa but if you're
[1:56:21] around them long enough you realize the
[1:56:23] personality of that church is unique to
[1:56:26] that church itself
[1:56:30] God loves variety
[1:56:34] have you been watching Venus in Jupiter
[1:56:38] no
[1:56:39] you didn't know that meant out okay well
[1:56:41] let me update you a little bit
[1:56:44] it only happens every so many hundred
[1:56:46] years
[1:56:47] so it started with the quarter moon
[1:56:50] then Venus and Jupiter Allied like this
[1:56:55] I saw them all ago I was at walking
[1:56:56] praying before I come in
[1:56:58] and they're just like this right above
[1:57:00] each other
[1:57:03] God made them that way they only get in
[1:57:05] that past ever so many hundred years
[1:57:10] certain constellations have passed by
[1:57:12] and the way you see it I said well not
[1:57:13] long ago and it hadn't been that way
[1:57:15] since 5 700 years ago
[1:57:20] so it was right after Adam
[1:57:23] and yet they go through this big pattern
[1:57:25] out there and they find their spot and
[1:57:29] every now and then they get to this
[1:57:31] certain place to where you can look up
[1:57:33] and say oh my goodness
[1:57:38] I mean Carol was out here a month and a
[1:57:40] half ago two months ago after Dark I
[1:57:43] stopped up here
[1:57:44] to take a picture of our church three
[1:57:46] crosses lights on top
[1:57:49] sent to Carol she pulled it up
[1:57:53] there was two blue lights hanging right
[1:57:55] over it one of those Comet things
[1:57:58] that it passed right over the top of
[1:58:01] where the cross was
[1:58:03] huh
[1:58:04] I like those things
[1:58:07] now you think they've been doing that
[1:58:09] for who knows how long but it just so
[1:58:11] happened we just got this lined up
[1:58:14] that's the way we are you see this thing
[1:58:16] has been going on for so long and God's
[1:58:19] waiting and waiting on us to get lined
[1:58:21] up and it ain't how great we are ready
[1:58:23] to end how big we are it's actually who
[1:58:25] we fellowship with
[1:58:27] yeah so you see that's what happened
[1:58:28] with Venus and Jupiter it's been going
[1:58:30] on the last little bit is Venus and
[1:58:32] Jupiter has caught the moon here in this
[1:58:33] Crescent this quarter Crescent so as
[1:58:35] it's done now they're identified right
[1:58:37] there in our star
[1:58:40] same with us we battled this we battle
[1:58:42] that and it may be that God will put you
[1:58:44] in alignment and you're there for just a
[1:58:46] short span I'll live if the Lord tears
[1:58:49] in a few years I'll be gone another
[1:58:51] preacher will step here and take over if
[1:58:53] the Rapture don't come I'll live my life
[1:58:55] in a few years after I'm gone folks I
[1:58:57] never remember me no more I'll never
[1:58:59] remember hardly nothing I'd done I'll
[1:59:01] just be you know an old coat and I turn
[1:59:03] the ground the church Will Go On
[1:59:06] but I've lived my life and I've declared
[1:59:09] myself according to the Creator who put
[1:59:12] me in the heavens
[1:59:13] isn't that what you want to do
[1:59:16] can you imagine just being a meteorite
[1:59:19] just floating around
[1:59:21] falling stars people call it you never
[1:59:25] accomplish anything you never leave a
[1:59:27] mark behind you you never influence
[1:59:30] people in the right way wouldn't it be
[1:59:32] awful for your life to be known as a
[1:59:35] tale Bearer or a troublemaker or one who
[1:59:39] you know just afflicts the body of God
[1:59:42] how many have you noticed in the Old
[1:59:43] Testament of the Kings and the Nations
[1:59:46] their identity is only on the negative
[1:59:49] side the only reason they even found
[1:59:51] their place in the Bible was because
[1:59:53] they stood against the people of Israel
[1:59:57] what a reason to exist
[2:00:00] God don't never let me be there
[2:00:02] God don't never let me be
[2:00:05] be a burden to some man of God
[2:00:08] cause some servant of God to spend night
[2:00:11] after night
[2:00:12] awake tormented
[2:00:15] God help me take me off the Earth Lord
[2:00:18] before I do such a thing
[2:00:22] how many wants your place in the body
[2:00:25] correlates together
[2:00:27] to be compacted
[2:00:32] with our heads bowed I wonder
[2:00:34] each of us from the front to the back
[2:00:36] and the mezzanine those of you that are
[2:00:38] streaming tonight
[2:00:40] we said brother Donnie I've never spoken
[2:00:42] tongues in my life and you know what you
[2:00:44] may never
[2:00:46] well I I've never shouted like others do
[2:00:48] I wish I could I believe in it but I've
[2:00:51] never done it
[2:00:52] yeah you may never know I don't know
[2:00:56] but the important thing is if you do
[2:00:58] what God wants you to do
[2:01:02] you have completed your journey
[2:01:05] and when you do you'll hear those most
[2:01:07] wonderful words well done
[2:01:10] by good and faithful servant
[2:01:13] oh that'll be worth it all
[2:01:16] how many that's what you want you don't
[2:01:18] want to be like your sister don't want
[2:01:19] to be like your brother well I wish I
[2:01:21] could be like that person maybe you've
[2:01:23] got your goals sent on the wrong person
[2:01:25] maybe what you need to do is realign and
[2:01:28] say Lord what do you want me to be
[2:01:31] what do you want
[2:01:34] Heavenly Father
[2:01:38] we know our life takes all types of
[2:01:40] twists and turns
[2:01:43] Lord whenever we built the church down
[2:01:45] in Kentucky and the fall of 1982 and
[2:01:49] finished step in the spring of 83.
[2:01:53] then Lord whenever we started having
[2:01:54] services and
[2:01:56] but then Harry and Carol was already
[2:01:59] listened to the message
[2:02:01] trying to tell their old hard-headed
[2:02:03] brother and husband
[2:02:07] Lord little did we know
[2:02:09] little did we see and understand
[2:02:13] what you had laid in front of us
[2:02:16] Lord we thought by then we was probably
[2:02:18] some of the last ones
[2:02:20] you had taken your Prophet 1965 so we
[2:02:24] thought oh there could be no no time
[2:02:26] already left
[2:02:29] but Lord I'm glad I was born under that
[2:02:31] urgency
[2:02:32] if I would have known that would still
[2:02:34] been here in 2023
[2:02:36] I'm out of come in a lot slower
[2:02:38] because you know me I don't like change
[2:02:42] Donnie don't like chains especially big
[2:02:45] change
[2:02:47] I'm so glad you put a fire under me Lord
[2:02:51] so here we are tonight Whoever thought
[2:02:54] that we would be alive in this earth
[2:02:56] March the 1st 20 23.
[2:03:01] we never thought we'd ever be here
[2:03:03] tonight
[2:03:04] and yet Lord we don't know how much
[2:03:06] longer we have
[2:03:07] but we want to be faithful as long as
[2:03:10] we're here
[2:03:11] I hope we get to live to see the rapture
[2:03:15] but if we don't we want to leave
[2:03:18] something behind us
[2:03:21] that can point to those who were
[2:03:23] following
[2:03:24] may I leave Footprints Lord
[2:03:27] may I leave an impression
[2:03:31] a good one
[2:03:32] May these parents
[2:03:34] maybe these grandparents may we leave an
[2:03:37] impression on our children
[2:03:39] our grandchildren
[2:03:42] that they can be inspired by the life we
[2:03:46] live
[2:03:47] the determination we have
[2:03:49] by our face muscles in Christ Jesus
[2:03:54] take each man woman boy and girl father
[2:03:59] may you just mold each of us
[2:04:02] that we can be compactly joined together
[2:04:06] fitly joined
[2:04:08] Lord we don't want no caulk put between
[2:04:12] us as it were
[2:04:15] we've all been around construction
[2:04:17] enough to know
[2:04:20] the painters can have a pretty tough job
[2:04:23] depending on the Carpenters
[2:04:25] and how well they cut them cuts
[2:04:28] the painter have to go back and try to
[2:04:30] make it look good
[2:04:33] I don't want that in my life father
[2:04:36] I don't want a bunch of caulk in me and
[2:04:39] a bunch of filler and a bunch of
[2:04:41] expandable foam
[2:04:43] or it has to be expanded out to fill up
[2:04:45] the lacks in my life
[2:04:48] oh Jesus compact me together Lord
[2:04:52] I see this as an individual I see it as
[2:04:55] a family I see it as the body of God
[2:04:59] if we're built this same way as an
[2:05:02] individual and our families built that
[2:05:04] way
[2:05:06] that we come together in the house of
[2:05:08] God our church will be built the same
[2:05:10] way
[2:05:12] so we're compacted as individuals our
[2:05:15] experiences fitly joined together
[2:05:18] Faith virtue knowledge
[2:05:22] Temperance all these things fitly joined
[2:05:25] together
[2:05:27] then we take them individuals and they
[2:05:29] have a family and their families are
[2:05:31] raised that way then we bring together
[2:05:32] in a church and our church is that way
[2:05:36] that's the type of church that you claim
[2:05:38] is your own
[2:05:39] that you said Upon This Rock I will
[2:05:43] build my church
[2:05:46] and the gates of hell
[2:05:48] shall not Prevail against it
[2:05:52] now Lord if I have built this church
[2:05:55] it's puny and it'll never stand the test
[2:05:59] of time
[2:06:01] if brother Tim Pruitt brother Ron
[2:06:03] Spencer
[2:06:05] brother Mike wall senior brother Lloyd
[2:06:07] on and on and on I could go Naaman
[2:06:10] Servants of God
[2:06:11] if it's by the Lord's Church brother
[2:06:14] Donny's Church brother Tim's church if
[2:06:18] that's all it is it'll never stand the
[2:06:21] test of time
[2:06:22] but if it's your church there ain't
[2:06:25] enough powers in hell
[2:06:27] to shake it down
[2:06:29] troubles will come and the devil will
[2:06:31] try it but when it's all said and done
[2:06:34] the church still holds together
[2:06:38] shall stand upon the Rock of Ages
[2:06:41] sickness can't tear apart distress can't
[2:06:45] tear apart tribulation can't tear apart
[2:06:48] nothing will Lord
[2:06:50] because it's your church
[2:06:52] Hallelujah
[2:06:54] oh we love you tonight father
[2:06:57] We Worship You Lord God
[2:07:01] can we just raise our hands now in the
[2:07:03] presence of the king
[2:07:05] I want you to think now friends as we
[2:07:08] come to the close of this
[2:07:12] I'm not sure that all of us will ever
[2:07:15] know
[2:07:16] all the intricacy of our spiritual walk
[2:07:19] with God you say well God's coming to be
[2:07:21] a preacher but what kind of preacher
[2:07:23] well God's called me to be a pastor well
[2:07:25] he may have and that may be seasonal
[2:07:27] God's called me to be an evangelist well
[2:07:29] it may have and that may be seasonal too
[2:07:32] but the thing you want is God where you
[2:07:34] want me when you want me how you want me
[2:07:37] that's what I want Lord
[2:07:39] same with lay Fox
[2:07:41] God calls you to fit in the body
[2:07:43] some of you move up you move up you get
[2:07:46] more experience then you're given more
[2:07:49] responsibility in the body from the
[2:07:51] charge of what God wants you to be but
[2:07:54] every step
[2:07:55] you want it to be led of the spirit of
[2:07:57] God do we not
[2:07:59] and remember what you do affects others
[2:08:03] what you do affects others
[2:08:06] so we're not here tonight on our own
[2:08:08] well I want to do this and I want to do
[2:08:11] that do you understand when you make
[2:08:13] that decision your decision may be
[2:08:15] affecting me it may be affecting your
[2:08:17] mother your child your grandson your
[2:08:20] granddaughter or people that you come to
[2:08:22] church with
[2:08:23] this is why we need to pray
[2:08:26] before we do this or that or the other
[2:08:28] and the church said why because we're
[2:08:31] fitly joined together
[2:08:34] so how can I take this part of this all
[2:08:37] to rail off
[2:08:39] without splintering and busting
[2:08:42] and dividing this joint right here I saw
[2:08:45] how it was put together
[2:08:47] you're not going to get it apart easy
[2:08:50] so what if I take it apart here here's
[2:08:52] another scene
[2:08:53] here's another scene
[2:08:55] I'm not going to get it apart easy
[2:08:58] it'll Splinter it'll bust it'll Shred
[2:09:04] what you do what I do affects those that
[2:09:08] were glued to
[2:09:11] oh praise the Lord
[2:09:14] how many loves him with all your heart
[2:09:17] how many loves each other
[2:09:19] I hope this brings us to a conscious
[2:09:22] level of responsibility that you're not
[2:09:25] just responsible for you or you and your
[2:09:29] family
[2:09:30] but for those that God puts us together
[2:09:32] with amen
[2:09:34] amen oh my
[2:09:36] let's sing something together
[2:09:37] let's just worship him a little bit

[2:34:05] they put the color
[2:34:06] through and through
[2:34:09] now there's some Stone manufacturers
[2:34:10] that only make the color about skin deep
[2:34:15] so when you go to cutting on them you
[2:34:17] cut it off and then you try to chip it
[2:34:19] you ain't got no color
[2:34:21] but these stones
[2:34:23] are colored from the soul out
[2:34:30] Hallelujah
[2:34:34] so when some Christians go to being
[2:34:36] chipped on
[2:34:37] you go to see them things about him and
[2:34:39] say I didn't know they had that man I
[2:34:42] didn't know this that way I'm gonna be
[2:34:43] that kind of rock don't you I mean all
[2:34:46] the way from the soul out
[2:34:48] it's sort of like I've noticed yesterday
[2:34:50] I've seen it before but at the funeral
[2:34:52] service of brother Bill Wiggins and I
[2:34:55] got ready for the military part to do
[2:34:57] their parts and many of you have seen it
[2:34:59] before as well but the guy stands down
[2:35:01] there and he gets that trumpet and he
[2:35:03] holds it up in the air that Feller ain't
[2:35:05] playing that trumpet a bit more than a
[2:35:06] man in the moon
[2:35:08] y'all didn't know that no that's a
[2:35:10] recording
[2:35:11] he ain't moving his fingers on him I
[2:35:13] used to play a trumpet when I was a kid
[2:35:14] so I know a little bit about him
[2:35:16] he ain't moving his fingers he ain't
[2:35:20] he ain't moving his Mouse he ain't
[2:35:21] moving his lungs he's acting like he's
[2:35:25] playing taps
[2:35:27] I don't want to act like I'm being a
[2:35:30] Christian I don't want to act like I'm
[2:35:32] bride I want to be bride
[2:35:36] amen I want my mouth smoothing I don't
[2:35:39] want my hands moving I want my feet
[2:35:41] moving I want my life moving
