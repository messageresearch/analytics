richly and and the coming year be my prayer and we're one year closer to going home and his promises are just as true in 25 as it was in 65 so we just amen we're just going to keep believing keep trusting God Amen it's been a hard year a lot of Trials and but there's been a lot of Victories and we're still pressing on May the Lord richly bless you so I'd like to introduce to you congregation today our precious Brother David Myers from Philly France is that right Philly amen let's make him welcome this morning God bless you Sint thank you brother NL amen hallelujah well God bless you sor for that sorry BR Donnie it's good to be back I was here last year at the dedication services and I remember we had Mighty services and it ought to be every service like that amen I remember when we we went there was a prayer line we went back to the office of brother Donnie and and there was brother Ron brother Donnie they had to be taken care of and and remember the words of Brother Don he said you should have seen all the casualties from the enemy amen so what about this morning this is the last service of 2024 amen but let's give a good knockout once again to Satan and Satan's kingdom amen Satan has fought many have stayed home because of sickness but we still serve a living God Amen he is still the same yesterday today and forever amen so I certainly count it a great honor to be standing here amen before the redeemed of the Lord and it's a great blessing to be standing here amen and it's always good when the saints come together because I always remind and I'm just quoting the word we were together before the found of the world Amen so maybe this is the first time you see me you hear me that doesn't matter I have no new doctrine I have one Doctrine that's Jesus Christ amen and I certainly appreciate your pastor brother Donnie his precious wife the family and as the word says uh speaking in Corinthians about the foolishness of preaching how I love and I thank God for be standing with true Servants of God to be on the battlefield that don't bend don't bow but that stand on the pure word of God Amen and we can be thankful for that because it's really God's grace Amen to have uh and and I want to thank you all because you have to share your pastor share the ministry and and so I want to do it live and thank you from the bottom of my heart for sharing your pastor with the rest of the Bride overseas you know sometimes we stay and we we stay focused on our little that's my little area but thousands many people have been tremendously blessed amen by the the the ministry of brother Donnie Reagan and so we I want to thank you from the depths of my heart for sharing him amen and Lord willing he will be back at Easter in in our Easter meetings so thank you amen and and we're not ashamed of the Gospel you know when the word talks about foolishness of preaching amen I love when the word is being preached in power in manifestation amen because that's what God gave us the most powerful weapon which is his word so even though I can feel weak you can feel weak the word is still an atomic power do you believe that amen and to think that we live in such a a tremendous time where we see Israel is in in in its Homeland we see what's going on and and and we live in a special time amen really when when you think about how God chose us for such a time as this amen and and we are standing here amen and and watching the word being manifested before our eyes like the prophet said we need to pinch oursel once in a while whether we're young whether we're old and and and and oh I've heard it preached before yes but now my eyes can see amen what's going on the King of the North to see Israel amen so it's a glor glorious time amen and it's a glorious time just to to end the the the year 2024 and to start a new one and and the Lord put something on my heart and I pray it will be a blessing amen but we have so much to Rejoice about because we live in this season of light and that's not because it's Christmas there's a lot of decoration or I'm not talking about that light we walk in the light amen God gave us his light the only light that you can receive is his word amen and God came down and gave us an open book amen revealed himself the word so by God's grace amen we can walk in the light so this morning I say like we heard it behold I bring you good tidings of great joy that's the gospel wonderful news amen so we certainly glad and to see brother brandham he had seven Visions how many remember that amen and and people try to put God in boxes you know we we we try to limit God six already has been has been done away with there's one left and I saw ashes Saints to be living in such a glorious time where in a twinkling of an eye think of it amen I have some back pain I have some pain here think of it in a twinkling of an eye I shall be changed amen mortality will take on immortality amen and that's for young for old because often young people they think oh we are still strong and uh I'm looking to say young people here and then we're in good health no no that's for all of us we will be changed amen and we have a glorious body awaiting for us amen so may God be uh worshiped and adored because he is worthy amen and as we go to the word so once again thank you from the depths of my heart and it's a great uh I'm so glad my wife is here sister an and my two daughters amen I bring you greetings from the church back home in France so Philly yeah that's where we live brother Daryl amen and he's been a great blessing also Through The Years amen so God bless you we love you dearly and we all love you dearly amen with the love of the Lord if can open the bibl our Bibles to John 14 and if I may ask you preach with me please it's not because it's the last final service preach with me you know the word of God tells us that we have to water the word with our Praises not what Brother David says what God tells us amen with our praises and the more we water the word the the seed the more it will grow amen and have the preeminence in this amen so if we can read the word in John 14: 18 I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you just this verse we can Rejoice amen yet a little while and the world see me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also and at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you amen two more portions Revelation 19 verse 7 starting with verse 7 and I know you have the King James version but I I'm going to read the Amplified because we know the King James probably can quote It Off by heart but I want to make a a point here so verse seven let us rejoice and Shout for joy exalting and triumphant let us celebrate and ascribe to him glory and honor for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his bride has prepared herself and verse 8 she has been permitted to dress in fine radiant linen dazzling and white for the linen the fine linen amen is a righteousness the living upright The Godly living and the conduct and right standing with god of the Saints God's holy people and verse n and then the angel said unto me write this down blessed or to be envied H are those who who are summoned or invited or are called to the marriage supper of the lamb and he said to me these are the true words of God so blessed are this people that are called summoned to the wedding supper my let it be a reality that we realize because the prophet tells us amen when the brides know her position then the Rapture will take place we are a blessed people hallelujah amen revelation 22 verse 20 say Amen when you're there he which testify these things sayth surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen and these are the final words of the Bible amen and we are ending a year so I could say May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with us all amen amen may God have the blessing to the reading of his word let's bow our heads for a word of prayer dear heavenly father Lord God we count it such a great honor to be standing on Holy Ground this morning Father we know Satan has been fighting and Lord no matter what he has tried to put on us we still are here by God's grace and we believe father that your word your your blood has never lost its power so I pray Lord those that couldn't make it may you touch them as we pray father may you make them whole Lord as the word is being spoken father may you go and renew them Lord and Lord those that are present father may you speak to us Lord we read your word and I pray father may you the author of your word come down father and break the bread of life to us this morning Lord I hide behind the cross and I pray father speak through the vessel Lord God and Lord may we be encouraged Lord and as we hear your word father Lord may we we receive more faith because Faith come by hearing hearing of the word of God lord and Lord as we end this year 2024 certainly Lord we want to give you all the glory we want to thank you Father for all your goodness Lord and knowing when we start this New Year by God's grace it will be another glorious year father and Lord we speak the word now when we lay everything into your hands father we pray these things in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen so for a title this morning I'd like to take thank you brother let us rejoice with exceeding great joy amen the Bible we read it let us be glad and rejoice amen that's where I draw my title amen let us rejoice with a exceeding great joy amen when you look up the word exce exceeding it means extreme great extraordinary to go past a certain limit so we always put ourselves we put the prophet says we limit God Amen but when we receive like David he he he said restore unto me the joy of my salvation he didn't Lo he didn't lose his salvation but he lost his Joy so with the word that we have received if we can see there's so much to Rejoice about we live in a world if we look to 2024 I don't know your situation you have I've had many hardships but here we are here we are amen we are here to show Satan that we are on The Winning Side amen no matter how I came in I know God has never failed me and he will never fail me amen so 2024 no matter amen I put it here no matter what we've been through let us rejoice greatly Rejoice Oh Brother David you don't know my situ I don't need to know because I know somebody that is watching over us amen and he's still The Great I Am he is still the same one that is working today all things can we say all things for my good we don't see it necessarily amen many times amen whether it's in in in in brother Donnie's life in brother bram's life in brother's life in my life we don't see the things we think oh this is chaos this is how is how I'm going to get out of this trial but God works all things for my good amen so let us be exceedingly to go past a certain limit amen we ought to be the happiest people on the Earth have a smiling face whether it's the right or the wrong president amen I'm not concern I can say it I'm not from America don't throw something at me now amen I don't care what president is I know one thing that God's word will manifest itself whether it's the right or the wrong I hey God will never fail and his word can never fail so he said let us be glad and rejoice and he said I'm quoting his word there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle amen amen so let us go amen and get in the spirit of worship says a prophet amen he says our spirit is clean it's fresh it's real it's sober and serious amen full of the joy of the Lord the Christian how many Christians do we have this morning good now here the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it Savers and delights in its Pleasures so we can see we can walk and I know it's it's it's probably the same we see in Europe people they are not ashamed to have purple hair to have green hair to work man working in scour hey maybe I get I will offend somebody but hey I'm standing for the word of God Amen they are not ashamed to walk amen and to give glory to Satan so why should I be ashamed if the word of God tells me I can be as exuberant even more why because God's word will never fail me I pray it may be an encouragement for you amen we hear what's going on Wars rumors of War amen turmoil there where amen but nature is groaning amen for what the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God Amen so we can Rejoice because everything is indicating the coming of the Lord everything is indicating the coming of the Lord he says we're right at the door and before one bomb think of it people are living In Fear And The Prophet tells us fear is the worst thing that Satan can put on you I'm afraid I'm going to get this I'm afraid I'm going to get this I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid and the word of God tell us let us rejoice exceedingly Rejoice amen and brother brother Daryl was telling me how he preached on Amen the weapons that God gave us if we can Rejoice even in the trial if we can worship even in the trial even if I can kneel down and and pray Lord I need you you will see the walls will come trembling down amen amen so before one bomb can strike oh the church will be gone home in glory think of it people that live under fear and wey we can be at peace amen a peace Beyond any understanding tell me brother tell me sister how comes you can have this Joy well this joy that I have the world didn't give it to me and the world can't take it away the holy ghost that I have the world didn't give it and the world can't take it away I don't know if you know that song but I love that song just telling Satan boo devil amen amen the prophet he tells us a story about this Cowboy you know the story amen the armor company how he was looking for a wife a bride amen and as he goes and he he sees all these women amen but there's one he says I've been watching you I have found and I I see that you are a virtuous woman woo the bride amen that is a part of himself amen is a virtuous spoken word bride amen so this man he says you're a virtuous woman amen I'm here amen for to find a wife and you meet that specification think of it you meet that specification how we're going to see bear with me amen so we see the as Brandon bam tells a story this lady she said but I'm not worthy that's what I say I am not worthy but then the prophet goes on to tell H there's the law of redemption amen and he takes the example of this mule you know the story amen has his ears down his knees all like sometimes we are like we feel amen but then Mama tells don't you worry it ain't know how you look where you come from because there is a perfect lamb that has been sacrificed for you and I amen so by God's grace amen Satan tries to remember where we come from he tries to remember our past but Saints let us talk him about his future his future is in the Lake of Fire And even this morning his place is under my feet come on Saints amen it's we should when we come to church no matter how we feel Amen brother brand he talks about amen how we are kicked around like a ball like a football that's how we go through sometimes but then when the word is being preached you say amen and something is happening deep inside because something greater is in you than all those that are against you amen and that ain't a fairy tale it's a reality amen amen so she says I'm not worthy but you mean that specification and amen a man of that caliber she says oh hey that's the way I felt says a prophet one night when I got the invitation to come to the wedding supper Hallelujah the prophet saying that's how I felt unworthy I'm a sinner but saved by God's grace but he invited me he chose me he elected me he loved me and he wrote my name in the book before the foundation of the world and when he invited me am think of it let me I have often asked the question have you ever gone to a wedding with a sad face let me pull on my glasses I see you better like anybody I hope it's not a bride and the groom because then they need counseling so to go to a wedding it's a party it's a feast it's a celebration and the prophet tells us when I got got this invitation not to any wedding my wedding and I got invited to the wedding supper I could but Rejoice amen unworthy I am but by God's grace he said I was worthy hallelujah amen amen amen and he goes on to say Amen when the man he replied when she said I'm not worthy I'm looking for virtue my you know what virtue says the prophets it's obedience to the word of God virtue is strength and when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says I'm quoting amen I have no message of my own we can only be a echo of the pure word not add and not take away that's why God bless my precious brother Donnie and brother Dar and the ministry that stand for the purity of the word amen cuz remember Satan is also there amen and it would be so close till it would deceive the very elect if it is possible but it ain't because the bride is part of the word amen so he's looking for virtue amen and when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have the virtue seal in you amen come on now Lord so blessed is the man says Jeremiah that trusted in the the Lord and whose hope the Lord is how many want to trust in the Lord for 2025 oh I have no job I don't care that's right I have no home I don't care because Satan can try to put a lot of things on us but what God has given us goes beyond that's why I can Rejoice exceedingly Rejoice Brother Lou s I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them that should be the hym of of the Church of the Living God because I'm the one that got elected Hallelujah isn't he wonderful amen because we know we live in a Time amen Matthew 24 says for the then shall be Great Tribulation such as as was not since the beginning of the world to this time nor ever shall be so for the bride it's a rejoicing time but for the others there can be much joy even though they act like they are rejoicing they think many people think I'm free since I'm out of the message I'm free they are more changed than ever some people in their lives live in such a mess it's about time you get in the message and you will see that you will have rejoicing exceeding rejoy because God when he reveals himself to you come on church amen the Rapture is unique yes sir there won't be many raptures several raptures if I miss that Rapture I'll take the next one like a plane or like a bus or like a train no he Rapture his bride and the prophet goes on to say that others they will be still preaching about the Rapture think of it amen hallelujah so he came first to redeem his bride then he comes to catch her away and then he comes with his bride amen and when he Comes This Time hardly none but those who are ready will know when he comes amen think of it yes sir Nobody Knows the time the day the hour so forget about all these theories but nevertheless the prophet tells us we should be ready at any time and expecting him here in the next minute the next hour any time so what should be our expectation even ending 2024 and beginning 2025 what should be our rejoicing just in service just when we come no day after day after day amen because it's in the hardest trials amen that he comes on the scene where he says this is a man-sized job amen when those three Hebrew boys they were in the F they were in the have you ever been in that condition thank you neither have I but the prophet tells us they were rejoicing hours after hours after hours rejoicing my what were they rejoicing about because the I am came down and they were having Fellowship they were having oh a glorious time amen when he comes down think of it the natural attributes laws have no impact right that's right the only thing that got burned were the ropes their clothes didn't even smell how great is my god yes we can sing it all together my How Great Is Our God amen amen and he's still the same for us amen so only those that know him amen that already will know when he comes so we read Revelation 19 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath excuse my English I'm not perfect in English but I know that half it's done it's not future do we have any any any teachers here I'm simple but simple fate moves mountains had made herself ready amen and the lexican uses the word excuse my pronunciation HTO Mao amen which is the necessary preparation and it says also to prepare the minds of men to give the Messiah a fit reception that's why we have to be transformed by the renewing of our mind that's why we don't need knowledge in the head but Born Again experience Moses had to get rid of all his knowledge many people can quote the word can quote from Genesis to Revelation can quote every every message quote and it's only head knowledge amen but that doesn't move God but when somebody with simple faith can start claiming God's given promises amen he comes on the scene not sometimes every time [Music] Hallelujah so God is uniting his bright there's a uniting time and that's what is going on right now are you hearing me it's going on right now what is she uniting for the Rapture amen what is she uniting with the word she's uniting herself with what thus sayith the Lord regardless of what any did denomination what anybody can else what can say about it why because she is the chosen one the bride the elected lady she is she's United herself with her bridegroom see and the bridegroom is the word think of the privilege yes sir like a prophet spoke one in a million yes sir yeah that we can sit here on holy ground hearing God's voice telling us You Are My Chosen you are my elected I've chose you even before you were born maybe a little baby has been born right now a few few days ago but God knew already before he even breathed his first breath amen amen are you with me he says the wedding band of predestinated unmar Grace is already on your finger brother darl that once hey I'm simple I told you but when I hear God telling me that he put the wedding band of unmar Grace already on my finger from before the foundation of the world that makes me want to shout hallelujah an exceedingly Rejoice amen because I'm getting ready we are getting ready for the wedding supper the uniting time is going on right now some miss it it goes way above their head but others it's a reality and every day every day is a day closer to the coming of the Lord mhm amen he says the prophet what a Thanksgiving praise our Lord Jesus what a Thanksgiving amen he says all the angels are standing in order I love the word of God yes sir all the angels are standing in order Hallelujah he screams the great corridors of Heaven crowded full the harps are all in tune the great bands are already practiced up there's a homecoming time pretty soon for the Church of the Living God who has been waiting for his coming coming everything is in order in this world of chaos everything is in order no matter how bad how good 2024 was everything is in order that's not brother David's word that's God telling us fear not little flock come on on fear not amen amen amen we have 600 and some promises 600 and more promises directly for the church in the last days wow am and these things that will take place and his power is just the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them if you abide in me and my word in you ask what you will and it will be done unto you the things that I do you shall do greater than this when I go to my father Lord I'm I'm with you always I'm with you always even to the end of the world there were two or three are gathered in my name I am with you he says forget about it brother it's God's will to do it and that's God's will for us this morning and tomorrow and the next day amen yes sir it's only Satan Satan robbing you aren't you sick and tired of Satan robbing us since when do winners lose winners listen to Losers come on if we are on the Lord's Side then who can be against us I'm quoting the word Saints so since when amen Satan bombards us day after day after day after day and night and night and night but since when there's the elect lady listen to the nonsense of Satan which is a loser you know sometimes it's good to tell Satan what his position is Satan you're a [Music] [Applause] loser Oh Brother David I don't dare well that good thank you I'm going to ask you how many dare to say Satan you're a loser Satan thinks he can but Bluff but greater is he that is in you than he that is against you amen this is a reality amen amen amen amen so 600 and somewhat promises that's at least well close to two per day and we have legal possession by Jesus Christ every believer in here I asked already how many believers do we have and you raised your hand every believer in here has a bang book from the deposit that was made at Calvary for me for us amen and and that's where he beat Satan to Pieces that's why I'm saying he's but a loser 600 somewhat and he says Promises of Divine Healing and we sat here slumbering oh my we claim to be his children rise and believe him amen amen maybe 20 and sometimes we will fall yes the just can fall but he seven times even but he raises up again don't stay on the floor you say I can do all things through Christ Jesus which strengthens me don't depend on your strength don't depend on your knowledge amen only depend on our Lord Jesus amen hallelujah he is still so believe in him he is still a mighty God time cannot change him right amen ages do not time him come on church he is still the Mighty God he is still the I am Brother David I heard that over yes but it has to become a reality where I know that my redeemer liveth I know in who I believe if the prophet tells us we ought to be the happiest people on the Earth the happiest people on the Earth yes sir and it's not just putting on a smiling face and brother on ask how are you doing I'm fine right the happiest people why because I've got an invitation yes oh yeah there's a marriage going on right now it's a reality and I got the invitation to the wedding supper and in one moment in a twinkling of an eye I shall be caught up amen together with those that were asleep before they will rise first and then together we will be raptured that's oh that's enough material for me to shout and rejoice I think brother Daryl one time in a church back home he says that ought to make the Pope shout well he doesn't have the Revelation brother Daryl but I see the point but what about the bride what about the elected lady we can't but exceedingly Rejoice because God is so good to us amen his coming is so imminent he is gathering his elect together amen oh he says he's calling his elect together in Oneness with himself with the same kind of ministry that he had the prophet says great is the mystery of godliness what is godliness to be like God Luke 24 speaks we all know how they received the promise T ye in the city let's not limit it because the promise was not just for a city I will send you the comforter I will send you and I will guide you he also says I will restore amen so until you be endued with power if you look to the Lexicon it means to put on to be clothed to be arrayed woo to be [Music] arrayed with fine needle work he uses yes sir the word of God you know many people they try to change the word to their condition you know the wedding dress I needed a little bit more and a little more this and a little bit more like that no no no I need to be changed shaped according to the word are you with me amen so many people come and my situation is different the word is the word word it doesn't change no matter what I think no matter what brother darl brother Donnie it's God's word and he will not change it that's why I can Rejoice because you know why because when he reveals himself to you personally then you rejoice because I can see my name in the book I have an invitation I know I'm going to the wedding supper amen and that's a reality amen that nobody it's not an interpretation that somebody can give you amen that Brother David brother Donnie whoever gives you no it's God personal dealing personally with you that's why amen it will be so close but thank God you know God he doesn't make mistakes boo Satan amen so we have to be unded dressed PR with this word and that's what is going on now the prophet says where the word becomes you and you become the word me yes you yes hallelujah amen those who he called he justified those who he justified amen he already glorified and every redeemed person in the world this morning that's under the blood of Jesus Christ filled with the Holy Ghost has everlasting life and cannot perish and is already in heavenly places with Christ Jesus yes sir and shall never come into condemnation yes sir so if we are filled with the Holy Ghost the Lord our fibers and beings has already been preserved in God and there is a glorified body Hallelujah there is a glorified body already waiting and you have to go to it as soon as it is over how does your future look Brother David glorious yes sir hey I can say happy New Year even the prophet says the best thing we say God bless you but my future our future the bride's future is glorious we we'll we'll go a little deeper because as long as we are on earth no B Ms can fall okay 1 John 3 beloved now are we the sons of God and it do not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is you know the story about that little lad who was walking in the house and he comes by a mirror the mirror is the word of God and he goes in front of the mirror that's me that's why God came down with an open book no one was worthy it ain't a man it's God himself taking the book opening the seals thereof so we can see our true identity that's me Hallelujah I'm the pure virtuous bride of Jesus [Music] Christ amen that goes a trillion times above whoever can be soall important I'm the son of Mr President I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah greatly exceedingly Rejoice amen we see amen Jesus said in John 10 I and my father are one yes have you been so long with Me That You Don't See you see this Antichrist spirit that still tries Amen to bring in Trinity we're talking in the office with brother darl amen and it would be so close till it deceive the very elect if a trinitarian Doctrine comes in we know that it's wrong so we know so that the same it will be so close it will be even in the message we don't like to hear it yeah but it's still the truth that's why you pray for your pastor you pray for the ministry amen Jesus said at that day that's this day I'm quoting a prophet at that day that's this day when this Revelation is made known you will know that I am in the father and the father in me and I in you and you in me when the Revelation is made manifest and that that day you shall know that I am the father and the father are one I am in the father and the father is in me I like this mathematics very simple am told you I'm simple and then when the Revelation comes forth then it's I in you and you in me there you are I love how the prophet makes it so easy yes s there you are can somebody write a thesis on it or a doct doctorate or in PhD and explain me how I don't need any explanation because God himself used some vocal cords to tell me there we are that's God's plan God had attributes amen and way he had amen attributes and we are his attributes amen so God's desire way from the beginning was to manifest to become tangible and how thankful we can be when we see Israel in his is in the in the Homeland amen they reject it but how thankful we can be that we have seven Church ages yes sir they rejected thank God and the prophet says there's a limited time so don't play with time I'll do it tomorrow I'll do it next week oh maybe next year no now is the day of your salvation now is the day when you give it all to the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] amen he says at first it is a thought a thought and then a word and a word and when a thought Express is a word than it's spoken it has to happen Therefore your name was in his thinking that's how you have eternal life if you got eternal life you always was hallelujah oh yes I can exceedingly Rejoice about thaten amen thank you Lord and then it's spoken it has to happen amen oh anything that was eternal never did begin and cannot end so you are only in his thinking your name who you are and what you are that's the only way you could ever have eternal life CA you always was Lord people are looking not going to give names but invest trillions of dollars to go to Mars sorry it's your money your taxes there's probably some life out there Satan was cast down here on the earth and God had such a perfect plan that he placed us here on the earth and God wants to show his Glory we're going to come to that in a moment yes he does even on this Earth amen so let them look for Life here's real life and the real life is his word hallelujah he says you actually know nothing about it but yet science and God's word proves that you were in your father and you know nothing about it that's why we have spiritual Amnesia and the word of God brings us back to our original condition not what you think not what you can see not what you can feel what God says about it amen every Son of God and every daughter of God was in God at the beginning he knowed it and he wanted you to become so he could contact you thank you amen he desires Fellowship he desires this communion with you and he wanted you to become so he could contact you speak with you and love you and Shake Your Hands think of it shaking your hands I'm shaking the hands of God a Son of God a part of God in you it's a reality amen God bless you Brothers I'm not going to do the whole church because but that's God Amen that's why he says amen now when the Holy Spirit was sent amen he divided himself and now is in a many membered body on Earth hallelujah amen that's why he says and Shake Your Hands how can I show you I just showed you when the two were on the way to EMAs amen Jesus appears to them and he goes what straight to the scriptures that's the best thing that we can give you brother Donnie I need some advice I need some counseling nothing against counseling but if you seek me you shall find me the problem is we have it's easy now we we went with with our kids we went to Pigeon forest and and there was an old phone that I still use so don't call me old now you know the one some younger ones here have never seen something like that they don't even know how to use it so and it's the same today oh we have a mobile phone and we can text and we can amen right seek ye first the kingdom of God amen amen and you will see if you knock with all your heart he will open that's right thank you Lord if if you seek with all your heart you shall find yes so when Jesus appears to them he goes to the scripture and he says don't you know that the scripture must be fulfilled Hallelujah screams brother Branham I feel awful good right now how many feel awful good this morning don't you know the scripture has got to be fulfilled yes now we can believe that for those two on their way to em but now what about the scripture concerning the bride that's right I'm asking you Saints scripture has got to be fulfilled don't you know that God's word will not return to me void and it will accomplish what why it has been given there's not one promise not one are you hearing me not one promise that God will not manifest that's righten even if Satan with all his power all his demons assembl thems not one listen Joshua savior we see he gets instructions from the angel clear instructions and God has ways of doing like I said before amen our thoughts are not his thoughts that's that's why he let thy will be done Lord yeah so Joshua gets clear instructions Amen to go into to conquer the land and we see how Jesus comes from a lineage that why would he choose that lineage to confuse all the intellectuals so we know that boas comes from the lineage of Salon Salon was married to Rahab we can read that in Ruth 42 21 and Salomon beg boas boas be Obed and Obed be Jesse and Jesse be got Avid and then in Matthew 1 we see all the lineage and beg Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ so out of a lineage why would he do that now when Joshua he had to take the Land There was a Rahab somebody unworthy like me but she believed the word she believed independently of what the people could tell her yes sir you're no good good at nothing you're your life is is miserable your life is evil yeah she believed because she even testified you know all this big army here are shaking in our boots think of it we are afraid because we know how God is with you so she believed amen and bringing it back because the word is filled with types just like Rebecca the word the message was sufficient for her she believed it amen many people say I want to I want to see first no I believe it amen so we see Rahab she believed the word she applied the token to her house and her household yes sir come on Mom and Dad no matter how far away he may be God still brings back prodigals so Joshua gave clear instructions in Joshua 6 he says utterly destroy all that is in the city both man woman young old Ox sheep ass with the edge of the sword why would he give that much information or Direction an ox we're going to need the meat a sheep we're going to need the meat because God's plan is perfect I can see a few years later the high priest standing before Rahab and Salomon saying into this holy State these two persons present come to be joined and if there's any person here that can show a Just Cause why they should not be lawfully joined together in this holy matrimony do you now speak or from Hereafter forever hold your peace so Joshua gave instructions received from God so that there could be no witness whatsoever that could say yes Rahab she's not worthy amen now I had we had our Lord and savior come down to pay the price for me think of it you know when somebody is kidnapped they ask for a ransom he has millions or whatever God put himself the price he said this is the price that is required and there is no one nobody but God himself that could pay that price that's how valuable you are amen think of it that's why his blood washes away all of my sins Hallelujah and if Satan comes the accuser of the Brethren when he comes to accuse you you've done this you've done that you're not worthy pardoned forgiven you've never done it in the first place where's that first place in God's thoughts before the foundation of the world Amen that's why I can greatly extremely Rejoice amen amen amen isn't he wonderful amen we can see amen when omnipotence speak then the miraculous takes place that's why in John 14 he says the works that I do shall you do also and God he came in our generation think of it God came down in our generation to pick up all the Loose Ends amen amen so the bride can see her identity so there is not an eight messenger coming are you hearing me there's not somebody coming no God did it very well at the voice of the seven Angel when he shall become be when he when he shall sound the mystery shall be revealed thank you Jesus Jesus so we see the Bible is full of types Rahab Ruth Ruth and boas Esther but you know they are the types but we are the true Bride on the earth yes Lord that which is in type is now a reality a manifestation of God's word yes sir as I said before while the bride is still here we still have a work to do yes sir Satan can boast but let let us put him back in his rightful position amen Romans 8 says for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US Lord remember the wedding dress arrayed indued with God's word yes sir now Isaiah 60 speaks of the time we're living says arise Shine for thy light has come amen and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and grows Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee when the Lord in the beginning he said let there be light remember that he made the sun to shine during the day and the moon to reflect the sunlight during the night stay with me a while now God Will Shine for his light says a prophet and he is doing it just before the coming of the lord it's not man man is out of it it's God God does it because he promised it so we see the moon is a type yes sir the prophet picks it up amen and the moon has no light by herself that's why we have no glory of ourselves I have a great Revelation you should listen to me and all this nonsense on God uses what surrendered vessels and the prophet says as soon as somebody thinks he has something God withdraws himself amen God bless the ministry true Ministry true five-fold Ministry Hallelujah so the Moon is the wife of the Sun and when when the Sun goes away the Moon reflects the light of the sun is that right on Earth and when Jesus was taken away we are the bride which is the Moon to reflect the light of the gospel and we can't reflect it until he Shines on us that's why when he said be my Witnesses you can be a witness unless you have a real lifechanging Born Again experience many people can talk about the word but there's no reality behind amen amen Hallelujah so God said to the Moon to watch the boundaries of the sea and when the Moon Turns its head the tide goes out how many knows that that the moon has an effect on the tide the tide goes out and when it turns its head back the tides follows my the moon if it would ever move out of its place and I love how brother Donnie and there's only yeah brother Donnie can bring space beyond space to such a reality as I said he's been such a tremendous blessing to us and the bride all over the world and we love him dearly and here the prophet says yes yes we're not worshiping man but we truly it's an honor to have him as a real friend amen and I love him dearly amen so we see if if that Moon would go just a little out of its its position see what happened if it move out it would move out of its place the waters would cover the Earth like it was when God started it in Genesis 1 wow but the moon set there and when it just even turns its head the ties start running in now Isaiah 59 tells us that so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come come to Zion which is a type of the Bride amen and unto him that turned from transgressions and Jacob sayeth the Lord so you see the moon in the night time the word of God tells that there will be light in the evening time the moon reflects the light of the sun and the Rapture will take place the church will be taken home and then the tribulation will set in so I said there's not one bomb and I'm quoting the prophet there's not one bomb can that can drop unless we're taken out raptured away so it seems that the enemy comes in like a flood trying to take over our lives to bring depression to bring sickness to bring all kinds of things to say I'm going to pull and get you children but there's a bride on the earth that has received the open book and that can draw a limit because the moon when it turns its side the tie has to go in or out come on now we see even when Moses when they were between the sea and Pharaoh you know how the prophet says when oh Moses we're lost often some people they scream oh 2025 is going to be horrible no no not for me does that mean I will have no trials no sir no brother no sister but even in the trial in the deepest trial we can give glory to God because I know I have a wedding supper to attend and there's the uniting time going on right now sir amen so when the sea got in their way on the road to the promised land god looked down from the pillar of fire with Angry Eyes the pillar of fire hasn't left us people think the prophet has left so the pillar of no he's still present he's still a very present help in time of trouble amen now we see that in Revelation 10 we see verse one and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire Hallelujah M and we know we have seen the prophet says headship is here now we have seen the cloud appear now if headship is here now where is his body we are his body Ephesians 1:22 and had put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that fill it all in all and when he says hup is here you know what he says after that's the devil's answer you have any question head is here that's the devil's answer oh think of it Saints so what happened we read the angel come down feed as pillars of fire plural what happened in the upper room bear with me a moment when did I start what was God doing in the upper room he was separating them tongues of fire was separating that big pillar of fire and dividing himself among the people the Holy Ghost separated itself on the day of Pentecost God separating himself that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father in me and I in you and you in me amen thank you God was in one man Christ Jesus in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily now when the pillar of fire came down and Pentecost notice tongues of fire set upon each of them that was God separating himself self or dividing himself from the pillar of fire into each member of his church amen now God could be universally all over everywhere at one time praise the Lord hallelujah and on the day of Pentecost when this great light that's why I said we're living in the season of light right amen we walk in the light amen when the great light came in there God divided himself we become God's own life in us the Holy Ghost God dividing himself making him Sons and Daughters yes you've heard it I know you've heard it I'm preaching to oh yes a word founded church but it's good to refresh our memory amen because Satan bombards es us so we we answer when he comes in with reasoning with doubt we answer him by the word with faith in the word of God and Revelation 10:2 says and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth now we see there two beasts Rising bear with me a moment I'm trying to wind up here but it's a symbolic the Beast cannot come into power unless he lifts his feet from the earth until I Rapture my bride and my bride has her feet on your hates on your head Satan a beast comes out of the land you can read it and that's what is so amazing that people they and triy to explain many things but God himself came down with an open book that's why when John saw that no one was worthy he wept but then a bloody lamb came forward and could take the book and open the seals thereof why who was it for think about the privileged Saints think about the the honor we have think about what a beloved people we are am that's why I can yes exceedingly Rejoice Amen in the good and in the bad times because his word will never fail amen so the Beast that comes out the lamb there's this American Spirit sorry Saints I'm quite the prophet explains it very clearly all Fashions all things that come from Hollywood and all these things but oh we have received the light the open book and we can put our feet upon it head and even though we are living in L that's right lukewarm lah has no effect on me because in this lapse of time of laa we're living in the bride a because we have been called out of so L this here has no impact on me I can put my feet on Satan's head Brother David you're oldfashioned give me that old time religion give me that old time religion it was good for brother random it was good for brother Paul and it's good enough for me Hallelujah amen amen so then there's a beast that comes out of the sea Rome amen and we are not bound by any doctrine of Trinity we're not bound by popes we're not bound by Bishops we're not bound by headquarters amen come on Saints amen we're not bound by the Antichrist Spirits amen but they are under our feet as long as the bride is on the earth amen this Beast cannot come in into power thank the Lord cu the Holy Spirit In Our Lives makes us Spillers of fire plural Glory praise the Lord and we put him under our feet Yes s why cuz greater is he that is in us than he that is against us let me tell you we are not a defeated people we are not a defeated bride that's right we're an overcoming people we are a chosen people for such a time as this amen amen we can rise above every trial every Temptation amen and the prophet says and let them know that they can possess the Gate of every enemy because every enemy has been put under the feet of Christ and every enemy is under your feet you see how he makes it personal is under your feet as long as you are in Christ because everything is under his feet how do we get into him by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body and we've been made partakers right partakers that means we have a partall of the same blessing the same power yes s so we did not receive just a little message a boohoo hooo message yeah we have received a sure certain word of God coming from God himself to his bride and that's what is going on now as he reveals himself service after service day after day amen every member of the Bride receive not all at the same time but at God's appointed time and when the last one will come in and realizes receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when we realize who we are amen then the Rapture will take place Lord so when you realize the power the moon has not by itself but by reflecting that's why he says you have to go to the angel and eat the go take the open book eat the open book yes sir representing what so you become the book the word becomes you and you become the word amen and although many people can say well and when the seventh seal opens there was a silence for half an hour many people think sh there has to be silence please don't Worship in church what if you don't cry out these Stones no that's what these stones will cry out and what happens during the lapse of silence for about a half an hour what is he doing as the headship is here he's revealing his secrets to his bride and as she receives the word as she receives her true identity amen she rejoices she gives Glory when the seals are open amen the prophet says that John which is a type of the Bride when he saw his name amen when first it was crying but then when he saw that he opened the book he shouted he rejoiced everything in heaven everything on Earth and everything under the Earth shouted Hallelujah glory be to God and you know why I love how the prophet says he says he must have looked beyond the curtain of time and say there's John and there's another quote maybe I'm sure you know and I love it and I take it for me where the Prophet says and I've seen you all over there talking about ex exceeding extreme enjoying my I know where I come from by God's grace and I know where I'm going I'm not from this Earth I come from God and I go back to God amen amen amen isn't he wonderful Glory let me wind up amen so we see that God gave his voice to us amen so she's already united we go to the wedding supper we're not going to the wedding we're going to the wedding supper the wedding is here yes he says not the marriage we're going to the wedding Supper The Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and the two become one and then what does it do it manifests the son of man again and whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing amen the church does the same thing I'm not going to go into but Esther which is a glorious type of the bride and the bridegroom there's so many I'm not going to call them nuggets because they're atomic bombs that shows us that God's word cannot fail and whatever that he has sealed like amen he says Amen in Esther 8 whatever the king is whatever write ye also for the Jews as it like at you in the king's name and seal it with the king's ring for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's Ring May no man reverse the book God wrote it yes he wrote my name we heard it in the beginning my name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he sealed it thank you Lord Satan would have but Satan is out of the picture he's but a bluff the prophet says he's but a stump on the side of the road but it's our duty to put him under our feet to put him in his rightful position amen so thank God for a sealed word and God himself comes down and in our generation to open the seals thereof and to reveal you are my precious you are my beloved and we are uniting here and getting ready for the wedding supper and nobody can reverse nobody can revoke it can change it can can take my name away think of it nobody can erase my name that's why when he the prophet speaks about Oneness about the deity he says that's makes Satan mad how many here love to make Satan mad we shouldn't be afraid and we should act according to the word that's what shakes him he says I am the word and if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word deity is not in heaven it's in you when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost thank you so I'd like to take wind up with this and I'm sure you heard a story about a painting how how Satan I just go to I said Satan is but a bluff yeah and there's a painting that is hanging or used to hang in Lou in Paris maybe some of you have visited beautiful place and if you go there please visit us but there's this painting that hangs in Paris it's painted by Frederick Moritz August wretch that doesn't sound it's not famous name but that doesn't matter and this painting has somewhat two names the official name is Checkmate and the other name is the King has one more move so we see here on one side there's Satan that plays this check this game this game and and he his opponent he he Satan is very confident you can see he's confident and on the other side there's this man and it's his life that is at stake and he sees and and it looks like it's Checkmate and Satan comes around and 2024 or even 2025 and he tries to tell us you're not going to make it why should you rejoice exceedingly Rejoice not just Rejoice exceedingly Rejoice awesome you know I've got you cornered you've done this you've done that and again and again so here Satan is confident yeah but let me tell you on this painting one famous chess player came by visited in the Lou and as he was looking at the painting he says but this man the King has one more move Amen Let Me Tell You Saints the King has one more move the Rapture so don't let Satan Bluff you don't let Satan play you around because the king is still Mighty the King has still everything under control and we have been invited to the wedding supper amen so I can Rejoice even this morning even tomorrow even 1 of January 2025 because that's the prophet says I can't see anything else that is left but the Rapture glise Lord blessed new year or blessed end of the year cuz Rapture could come before the end of the r but may God bless you above and beyond amen rejoice in the lord always again I said rejoice in the lord always amen the the Lord wants us to Rejoice why cuz you have been given the invitation to the wedding supper yes sir and the wedding band of unmerited Amazing Grace has been given to us why don't we stand so let's not look let's not look on how we see things the king the king of kings has one more move isn't that wonderful you can check it up on on Google in the painting you see and that's how Satan is he is so confident when he hung my savior Our Savior on the cross he was having a party until somebody knocked at the door and the prophet says I thought I had you to the prophets I thought I had you I thought I had you when I hung you Satan you're defeated I'm in control he took the keys of hell that the grave everything every sickness no matter what you name it covid-19 20 21 22 23 24 25 no matter how many CS there may be no matter how many demon names we give them we send them back to where they come from amen yes sir but let us rejoice Saints exceedingly rejoice because we serve a mighty God and the union is going on now think of it Saints in a twinkling of an eye we will be raptured the prophet says we're even bumping into angels and all of a sudden Time and Eternity will blend together the King has it all under control can we s can you play that song How Great Is Our God how many believe we serve a great God even if you don't have your life under control cuz sometimes it seems like we lose [Music] control my Lord and Savior has it all under [Music] control that's why it's such a great honor honor and privilege to serve the Lord and when I say to serve him not just as a minister but all of us as a body to serve God to be written Epistles read of all these men maybe there's one maybe there's your neighbor maybe
