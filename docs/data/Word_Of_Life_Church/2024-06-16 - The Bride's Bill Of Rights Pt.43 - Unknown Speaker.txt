do want to one thing about Vacation Bible School I thought was different this year we hadn't done it in a while and Michael's vision is just amazing and it was really impressive if you got to see it but one thing I noticed this year that was very it was wonderful was to see a lot of the young people and a lot of people in general pouring in and it was it was like the body ministering unto itself like to into the younger children and they were the games were taken care of by the upper roomies and the and thank God for that and it was just fun it wasn't worked by one person it was worked by many people no one individual could do that so uh we're very blessed and to have so many people involved was a blessing to me so let's pray dear Lord thank you for your grace to us I thank you so much for the body of Jesus Christ on the earth I thank you Lord for leading us into that way with perfect love I thank you for the opportunity to bring prayer requests before you in faith believing that it's it's okay and that it will be okay and we can rest and Trust in what it is your Divine Purpose and will is in our lives I thank you for the balance of the Gospel to know that there is such a a wonderful side of you and and how you pull those things out of us and also to know that we have to go ahead and follow you there's no other option we cannot stay here the balance of those two things I thank you Lord for your spirit the love of God in our hearts and I pray these blessings and testimonies come forth as we brought so many testimonies this week of various people it's so rich to see how each person ended up here one of the richnesses of the the richness of the body is to see how all the individuals come together in the collective Body of Christ and we're so thankful to be a part in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you ushers if you want to come at this time we receive the morning tithe and offering you give us unto the Lord let's sing an old song We sung it a lot

he wants to be [Music] [Applause] like Stand Together what a great example of fatherhood that our Lord has given to us that being said we certainly want to wish every father here today and those that are streaming a Happy Father's Day I'm sure most of your fathers feel the way that I do and um many fathers that I've spoken to through the years they feel like I've made a lot of mistakes along the way wish they could redo some things undo some things change some things but yet aren't you glad the Lord doesn't toss us when we mess up he gives us a chance to try over and over again we're so grateful for that um want to just say how much I appreciate the um all the effort and the work for our vacation bible school heard a lot of good reports about it want to thank all the brothers and sisters of all the world work preparation those of you that served of course the food and the children Sunday school teachers brother Michael all of those that help put everything up those that'll help take it down all of that together it would be totally impossible to do such an undertaking with just one person of course trying to do it so always so many people behind the scenes that are doing things thank you for that I trust our kids enjoyed it the visitors that were here and hope you keep in mind that all of that has done for you to be able to help you along the way and give you a little bit more insight into the Lord and his mercy and give you a little bit of time together amen let's uh turn today if you would to the book of Isaiah chapter 54 Isaiah 54 verse one sing O baren thou that did is not bear Break Forth into singing and crying out loud thou that didst not travail with child for more other children of the desolate than the children of the married wife saith the Lord enlarge the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations spare not lengthen thy cords and strength thy Stakes for Thou shalt Break Forth on the right hand and on the left and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited fear not for Thou shalt not be ashamed neither shalt thou be confounded for Thou shalt not be put to shame for Thou shalt forget the shame of thy use and shall sh not remember the reproach of thy widowhood anymore the reproach of thy widowhood for thy maker read it with me is thine oh wow for thy maker is thine husband so there must be going to be a way made by which people can marry God praise the Lord amen for thy maker is thine husband the Lord of hosts is his name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole Earth shall he be called for the Lord has called thee as a woman woman forsaken notice now as a woman Forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of Youth when thou was refused saith thy God what a wonderful thing how many ought you been remembered today as we pray I want to also thank you for praying for Carol during her surgery she's doing doing better still not feeling great but the doctor told her probably take her a couple weeks maybe to get over to pretty extensive dental surgery and we certainly thank you for praying for her ask you to continue to do so so let's just uh go before the Lord and ask him to bless the word and all the needs and requests father as we've gathered here today in this place Lord Jesus we count it such an honor Lord we're asking you that you'd help us our needs are so many Lord Lord and we're here to be able to sing and worship and pray and praise and hear the word and respond back to the word father we just want to see you move among us our needs are so many and so great Lord there may be some here today that don't know you as father maybe there's some that's been saved but they've not receed the Holy Ghost others that need healing others that need Deliverance whatever the needs are we believe that you're mindful of every one of us then father for those that are streaming today that are sick and Afflicted and whatever their not needs might be we bring them before you as well help us all Lord Jesus as I stand before this people today no doubt the most needy person in here to try to say something that would help a mortal how can I do such Lord God I need you I pray that you'd help me to shut my mouth to anything that would displease you father would you just come and take charge of the service help us Lord each one that we can be able to put forth our very best to make this service everything you want it to be in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated for thy maker is thine husband thy maker is thine husband well we can all say we didn't start out that way for our maker certainly was not our husband when we were born born lost born without seemingly a hope until God and His Mercy reached out to us and then after we become saved and then we start moving and growing and moving toward what we believe God has for our lives then we start hearing that there's more to this than just salvation that a person can start laying aside things being cleansed of certain things Sanctified then we learn there's this indwelling of the spirit where you move Beyond justification and sanctification and God actually gives you a portion of himself and his Spirit starts living in you and then you move into a state to where that you're hearing that there's a message in the land and that God has done a great work in that he's bringing a people to be his wife or his bride and hearing that there's different degrees of people in the economy of God as there were in the Old Testament so are there in the new and then you go to wondering and you're puzzled about it you're trying to figure it out okay so everybody everybody comes to Salvation in the same sense and then some never move beyond that they just keep going to church and keep living their same old sinful life basically and they believe that that's pretty much acceptable in the eyes of God and then others seem to grab a hold to something that makes them different and they're able to overcome things that you think was totally impossible for them to do and it was because something had to help them of a greater power than what they had to do it and then you see others and it seemed like they move into a little deeper place even than that with God and they have such a love for him and it seems as if though he is their very life and they can't live live without him they can't be really motivated without him and then others they still go to church they love God they don't want to be lost they don't want to go to hell but they just don't seem to love Jesus in the same degree and then we hear it of course preach that everybody's going to heaven at the same time uh those that live good those that don't live so good you just try to do the best you can and God will help you you know and then we understand that those types do not answer back from the Shadows that we see in the Old Testament so we see people like Abraham that walked with God in such a sphere that God became his friend so not just an acquaintance not just his judge to be in the future but actually a friend what kind of man would God ever call his friend well he didn't call lought that he didn't call aimc that he never called Pharaoh that there's many great people of the Old Testament that God never called him friend I wonder why he would call this one particular man his friend I'll tell you that's quite awesome isn't it to be called the friend of God if the president of the United States would call you friend or the mayor or the governor or something like that and would say oh M what a great honor and I'm not saying that it wouldn't be but can you imagine that God himself would call you his friend yet others he would call them servants others he would call them his people but never his friend so it shows us that there are categories truly in the kingdom of God I guess the question then would be what makes the difference can we Elevate our our El and get to the different categories the higher category where Abraham was is it something that we actually do ourself is it something that we learn is it something that say the more faithful we are and the more that we do the more we help the poor the more that we reach out to others and we give of our substance is that what does it is it that we pray more we read our Bible more we go to church more often are is it is it those things that makes it different or are we looking at something that is not just what we do but it's actually his choice himself you see I would not wanted any of you to have chosen my wife for me as much as I love my mom and my daddy I would not want them to have chosen my wife for me I don't think any of you brothers that are married today would have wanted me as your pastor or your mother your grandfather some Aunt some uncle that you really love and respect but you would have wanted them to chose your wife for you you felt like you had a right is that true you felt like you had a right and you were the one that was going to live this woman for the rest of your life so you feel like you would have a say and what kind of woman that you would going to live with well I feel the same way today about God myself don't you that I I don't feel like I have a right to say this one's bride this one isn't that one is that one isn't that one is I I believe that God has the right himself to choose who he's going to be married to through eternity then if God does have that right then truly he will give those people whom he has chosen to be that a particular something that will respond to him and as we looked at it there's been last Sunday there's been special occasions when the Lord would manifest himself in a way that's quite unusual it wouldn't be uh something that everybody would even know it wouldn't be something that he would do just every week or even every year it would be something that he would do only on special occasions and special times times when it was needed because say the darkness was so severe it would take a special presence in order for the elect to even break through it and we believe that we are living in such a special time but we know we're not the only ones because he's done it before now the times have been scarce and they've been few really in comparison to Angelic visitations alone but this one that we like to look at today is the visitation of the son of man through the administration of the son of man the bridegroom call will come through that visit now it's different than just an angel of the Lord coming down and visiting manoah an angel of the Lord coming down and visiting different people this would be not an angel of the Lord but the angel of the Lord so it will be a theophonic appearance of God himself in a visible form he will come in such a way and release a power that will help the people of the Day become what they need to be let me read to you again the quote that we read last Sunday improving his word Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church not no more as a church but the bride is called in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Lamb the bridegroom call will come right through this now remember the bridegroom call will come through this manifestation of the son of man now notice it's not going to be called Son of God what was Son of God the spirit had a son and it was called Son of God that would that would last for many many hundreds of years 2,000 years actually that would be a great time for the church ages but it will not be able to consummate the end time for the finishing up of the bride and a resurrection so it must be something that will go beyond what Luther had what Wesley had what Pentecost had a restoration of gifts was wonderful but it never produced a Rapture from ausa Street on it certainly W produce one today and the church said so under the church ages the anointing that was being released was not son of man but Son of God now the Lord Jesus referred to himself through the gospels over and over and over again as son of man this is one reason the Pharisees and the Jews got so angry at him because he referred to himself as son of man now they knew that was a title that God gave to Ezekiel they knew that was a title that God gave to Daniel and then here the Lord Jesus is referring to himself as son of man so they got all bent out of shape well let me just tell you in advance people still do today so when a preacher really preaches about the manif estation of what the son of man has been in our day they still get all bent out of shape again first of all they don't understand it and they if they do try to look at it they St it through tradition but watch now he says the bridegroom call will come right through this one the son of man will come down and come in human flesh and unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man so pastors is not enough preachers is not enough going to church is not enough praise the Lord somebody reading your Bible is not enough but it would take something beyond all of that so it will be the revealing of of the son of man not a clergyman he says now do you see what I mean it's the son of man now notice who the son of man is Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride then shall go home to the wedding supper amen she's already United okay so now if we're going to take this order or this sequence of events the son of man will come down in human flesh and make his word so real it will unite him and the church together and he says it think of it she's already United so apparently something had already happened when he says this improving his word you following me so far now I want you to notice when this is preached August the 16th 1964 so something has happened she's already united we go to the wedding supper not the marriage fill your flesh as you quot in Revelation 13 of the Flesh of Mighty Men cause the marriage of the Lamb has come but the rapture is going to the wedding supper now this breaks all tradition of theology this breaks all the teaching of the majority of the catechisms of the church who believe in the Rapture because they preach that the Rapture is going to the wedding not so the Rapture is going to the marriage supper cuz the bride is already United now how could that be but brother Donnie how can the bride be United to the groom and him not here H oh but you see he is but you see people are looking for the corporal uniting they're waiting for the coming in the clouds but this coming was not a coming in the clouds but a coming in the cloud you see Jesus himself identifying his coming and he talks about it in two ways that he will be coming in clouds then he says he will be coming in a cloud surely he knows the difference between clouds and Cloud unless of course he's talking about two advents when the word here unites with a person and they two become one then what does it do it manifests the son of man again oh my not the church theologians the son of man the word in the church become one whatever the son of man done he was the word and the church does the same thing now turn with if you would to Genesis 18 verse1 and let's look at one of these Earthly manifestations of the son of man on the earth and the Lord appeared unto him in the Plaines of mamory now I want you to notice the way the Lord is spelled capital L capital O capital r capital D and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day so now Abraham has been accustomed now for many years to the divine presence and quickly he recognizes the divine presence and from his initial reaction he's sharing the same behavior that he's done done in Prior events when the divine presence has come down so he recognized him now I find it amazing that no matter what form the Lord comes in the elect will always know him now it's sad to say about the carnal people because they've got this certain mindset and they can only recognize the Lord Jesus when he appears according to their traditional concept I hope we ain't that way today here in church some people only recognize the Lord whenever he's moving in the form of shouting and running and jumping and screaming and hollering and he might move in a way of a still Small Voice and they sit right there and said well I'll tell you one thing I didn't get nothing out of church today maybe it's because you had your traditional idea in mind of the way you thought he ought to move I want to recognize him no matter how he chooses to move today anybody else here I believe in the running I believe in the jumping and the shouting absolutely I love all of that but I want to recognize him no matter what form that he appears in or what form he chooses to reveal himself in now notice in verse two so he lift up his eyes and he looked and lo three men three men stood by him so the Lord visited him in the plains of mamory and then he lifted up his eyes and whenever he does it's just like they appeared he lift up his eyes and he looked and lo three men notice how Moses writes this now three men so it's God and two angels and they look like men they talk like like men maybe sweating dust on their feet and they look like ordinary men but Abraham has this special way of knowing god that others would see a man but he saw God I guess the question is what do you see when you look three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent and bowed himself toward the ground now the Son of God this is the the pre- incarnated form of him as he's going to be in the Virgin form of course of the Virgin born body this is the pre-incarnate word in the beginning was the word so God gave birth to the word which was the son of God so he's the central figure of what we want to look at and there's always something special about this attribute of God because the Son of God wanted to wanted to live among humans there's always been something about him that he wanted to come into humans homes and be around them that's that's mindblowing right he he wanted to come down and live among human beings this is why even had them to make the Tabernacle in the wilderness God wanted to hear him talk about farming and raising goats and raising cows you imagine God want to come down and live among these people and hear them talk about the hardships and the battles and things that they went through so he he did not go to a synagogue somewhere or some Temple but he comes in the plains of mamory and he comes right up to Abraham's tent door so it shows us a tray you know what this tells me friends the Lord Jesus wants to come to your house he wants to come to my do we have the type of homes that the Lord Jesus not only comes to but feels comfortable in staying now what so his desire then is to visit the homes and the hearts of those who love him so Abraham's communion with Christ now remember Christ was the pre-existing form of him before he was later called Jesus Christ the anointed one so Abraham's communion with Christ so these verses give us an Insight that Abraham and memory mamory means fatness so it's the largess of God so he's enjoying the fullness of God's blessing now notice where he's fellowshipping with Christ he's fellowshipping with Christ in fatness in the blessings of God in great things that God gives him where is he at he's in a tent which signifies he is a pilgrim so he's not living in a house with a foundation notice his journey now typified by the symbols and the types where he is so he lives in a tent there the presence of God meets him and when do these visitors come the Bible tells us They Come In the Heat of the day so they don't come at midnight or in the we hours of the morning when it still dust they don't come then but they come in the heat of the day when the Sun or the light is in its brightest Eminence as it's coming forth again in his walk with God it's showing that Abraham is walking in the fullness of the light of the day now others are totally oblivious to this they don't have a clue what's even going on notice again what he does his response to them is his haste Abraham's haste so it proves that he has this loving desire to be able to reach out to God now no doubt he had never seen him quite this way before remember whenever he had saw God in different forms but he had never seen him quite like this so he he spares nothing from the presence of the Lord he wants the Lord to feel totally at home you know Paul tells us in the book of Ephesians chapter 3 verse 17 that Christ May dwell in your hearts I love those words cuz it literally means this that Christ May settle down and feel at home in our hearts that Christ May settle down oh my and feel at home in our hearts so how important is it that you and I make our home and our heart such an important place for the Lord Jesus to feel comfortable because he yearns to have communion or fellowship with us now notice verse three and he said my my Lord my Lord now there's three that walk up but he only addresses one of them and he said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant now notice what he has the ability to perceive it's his Divine friend he's not sure why he's gone on a different costume he's not sure why he's looking different this time but he knows him that's right brother Joel he knows him and he addresses him as my Lord not the Lord but my Lord my Lord look in verse four let a little water now wait a minute we're talking about God are we not Elohim let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet watch how that he changes with the time and he talks the talk that matches the manifestation so he's not asking for the Adoration of angels he's not asking for a throne he's not asking for you know some great heaven something but he's talking to God in the way Hallelujah that manifests the form that God's in I hope we can be as spiritual in the hour that we're living in a lot of people can praise that God that's millions of miles away they can adore that invisible being that's so far away and he can be right in their very midst and they don't even recognize and honor him for being there I hope you understand today that almighty God is right here in this church this morning it's good to be able to acknowledge that great Throne of God I don't know about you I've got needs here today I need a Healer I need a Deliverance I need one that'll encourage me anybody else so I want to be able to dress him in the way that is suited for this occasion this morning when I get to heaven I'll talk to him in heavenly language but like you I'm not in heaven yet so what am I going to talk about water feet food trees why cuz that's where he is I want to talk to him about my everyday life I wish somebody would hear me this morning I want to talk to him about your needs and those of you that are sick and those of you that are weary I don't want to be so Heavenly minded and got my head stuck in the clouds that I look beyond your needs and the things that are pressing you this very day that you have need of in your life with God oh my let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree water feet rest tree all natural things why is he talking such because God had manifested himself in a natural form and he has no problem you see he's not looking at this as not being spiritual we try so hard sometimes to be so spiritual and we look right over the top of the very things that God wants us to recognize can you imagine a man talking to God about feet water rest and trees that's a man that knew the hour he was living in let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of you're talking to God and you are going to offer God a ve sandwich and a glass of milk you see how this category of people are so strange they are so weird because they are allowed by God to break into that realm to see where he is and they can talk to him where he is and it makes him so happy that they can I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your heart so water feet rest trees bread and comfort that sounds like a total human language to me why cuz God had become a man and we don't know how long it lasted maybe a few hours I'm not sure that you understand it yet but I'll go ahead and tell you this is a manifestation of the son of man it was for only a few moments and after that you shall pass on for therefore are you come to your servant I know why you're here Lord you're here for me to do this for you oh my would it be awesome if every one of us here today could have that attitude God I know why you're here you're not just here for brother Donnie you're not just here for brother bent you're not just here for Brother Scott you come by today for me you come by not only for me to get something for you but this is something I can do back for you notice Abraham was not asking God for anything it's what he can do for God oh children we come to church over and over and over again if we're not careful it's all about us it's all about well I need this I want that I need this I want and we bring our big old long list to God I'll tell you sometimes I think we need to leave that list at the house and come and say Lord I left my list at home but I've come to worship you I've come to praise you I've come to see what can I I give you what can I do for you on this Sunday morning Hallelujah therefore are you come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said and Abraham hastened to the tent unto Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of find meal again another carnal human thing you're telling your wife if you ever break bread for God I want you to make this sandwich I mean I want it to be better than paneria or anybody else could ever make Sarah I want you to make well who is it who is it it's God God Abraham if you lost your mind I'm telling you it's him remember she was always slow imagine a man that sah it's God I'm telling you how do you know it looks just like an ordinary man to me I know it may look like a man but it's the son of man it's not just a man it is allmighty God himself you mean I'm cooking for God yep you're fixing to make a sandwich for God so I want you to need it oh my make ready quickly three measures of fine meal and needed and make cakes trees feet water cakes meal hallelujah oh glory to God and Abraham ran uh-huh Abraham Ran So he didn't just kind of okay well I guess I'll go out there oh well I'll go over here and he got sidetracked and went over there and whatever three hours later he come back but Abraham took off running he said man I got to get down there I ain't going to find I I'll give God this one this one here's got a spot on it it ain't worth very much anyway though that's the way sometimes we do God we give everything else we give Instagram we give YouTube we give Facebook all of our time and then we lay down at night and 3 seconds before we go to sleep God help me oh Jesus and there we go and we give God our leftover come on don't sit there and look at me that way oh I'm so glad that God is merciful to us not just when we're lost but after we got saved my if some of your friends if you treated them the way you did the Lord they wouldn't be your friend long but I'm glad that our God is a faithful friend even when we ain't good I don't know about you I ain't always treated him right I ain't always give him everything that he wanted and yet he loves us the same you ought to be grateful for that today and Abraham ran unto the herd and fetched Hallelujah now remember who this is for it ain't for Brother Don it ain't for you God God and fetched a calf tender and good now for you vegetarians he didn't pick up an eggplant or broccoli God is a meat eater Abraham ran into the herd and fetched the Cal tender and good and gave it Lord God unto a young man you young men here today brother take the words that you're hearing under the ministry of this hour take the word of what you're getting out of your Sunday school take the word that you're getting when you come to church look Abraham was not going to do it alone it was going to be Abraham it was going to be Sarah it was going to be a young man don't you understand I can only give so much to God God wants what you can give him what you can give him what you can give him when we all get done here today we will present to almighty God a meal that is Fit For A King don't don't think I can do it all don't think Brother Louie can do it all God have something for you to contribute I ain't talking about your money oh my and he gave it unto a young man and he hasted he hasted also to dress it and he took butter and milk trees rest Comfort meal cakes milk butter you mean God likes butter on his bread well apparently he did I don't figure Abraham would have brought him something he didn't like I wish somebody would preach to me today let me tell you something brother this is knowing your friend if any of y'all invite me to your house and you've got broccoli for the first course and broccoli for the second and the third and the fourth and you made a broccoli dessert I'm telling you one thing you don't know me very well at all do you you know your husband don't like this or that or the other and you bring it to him you don't know him very well you imagine whenever God didn't have to send down his menu this is what I want he said he God you reckon we need to send it down he said men Abraham have Fellowship he knows what I like he knows oh I hope we do I hope I our father knows that we understand he loves praise he loves adoration he loves for his people to do what they do in haste give him their all give him [Applause] everything so he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed want you notice every one of these things that he's given to God signifies work preparation he didn't throw the milk at God and said God turn your own butter here God here's the calf kill it yourself cut it to way you want do whatever you want to do with it God but everything he gave signified his work his effort for what purpose to make God feel comfortable in his tent now you see it was In the Heat of the day that these Mediterranean people would sit in their tents the temperature sore very few trees there so they would set in the tent door because when the temperature would start Rising God in his Mercy would start allowing a little bit of a breeze to sweep across the desert SE so they would set in the door and the breeze coming off the desert sand and the door was the coolest place place to be so if you want to be cool in this age you better find the door friend you want to be accepted this age you better find the door and it was in the heat when the light was the brightest In the Heat of the Day In the Heat of the battle we can find fellowship if we know where to look and he took butter and milk and the C which he had dressed and set it before them and stood by them under the tree and they did eat now you imagine almighty God he picks up this sandwich you ain't never eaten nothing at Longhorn that's even going to come close to tasting this good there's butter there's milk there's the meat bread there's the calf everything you imagine God saying that is some kind of good eating thank you Abraham oh you're welcome sir boy children how we to feel today if church is over right here in in a little bit and then the Lord says thank you all thank you all for that meal that was so wonderful you all praised me you prayed and and you believed you didn't just pray but you believed when you prayed and you put forth an effort in the ministry studied and applied thems and then at the end of the service you worshiped and you adored me thank you all for that fine meal it was truly Fit For A King Hallelujah so here it's all gathered around him and set right before him Abraham with a fly bush so he's standing there waving the Flies off of God I don't imagine God likes flies any better than we do I don't understand why he ever made them things in the first place and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent this is the kind of tent meeting I'm looking for and he said notice they all three asked the question where is Sarah thy wife they said and he said amen I notice they didn't say it but he said it I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him so Sarah sitting in the congregation I I mean in the tent door behind him where he said now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah I to the man or women therefore Sarah lighted within herself saying am I wax old and shall I have pleasure my Lord being also old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I have assur to bear a child which I'm old oh my goodness I want you to keep the timeline in mind Isaac the interpretation of his name is laughter Sarah actually conceives during the same time frame that Sodom and Gomorrah is destroyed now watch The Blessing of the elect and the cursed of the Damned how they run side by side so Sarah conceives after this visitation was God hallelujah hallelujah it will come to pass I will visit you he said and the baby will be born now God's not saying I'm going to visit you and you're going to conceive she's fix to conceive after this revelation of the son of man his presence brought a supernatural strength and power that Sarah had not yet been able to attain to until he revealed himself as son of man verse 14 is there anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I not we I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I life not now you're going to call God a liar to his face you're going to tell God he's a liar thank God for Grace children that's all I can say come on don't sit down and look at me like you know what I'm talking about there probably ain't one of us sitting here today that ain't question the Lord and doubted the Lord Lord how come this and why that come on anybody brave enough to say Amen but you know what God done God said Sarah because you're a part of Abraham I cannot destroy you I cannot touch you without touching Abraham that's the reason we're sitting here today saved by the grace of God why God didn't already wipe us out because of our unbelief because our husband the Lord Jesus has a covenant an Everlasting Covenant then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou dest live listen this if God be with us in 1961 Gideon certainly had it was a scriptural man when the angel of the Lord said unto him if you notice it wasn't the angel of the Lord here it said the Lord kep capital L O R D it was not an angel it was God it was a theophany in a man in the form of God like appeared to Abraham back in the wilderness and look like a man so you mean a theophany could come into a man and use a man's body praise the Lord what's the last sign to the Seed of Abraham God coming down Discerning the secret of the heart not a dozen men one I'm not talking about one of the nine gifts of the Spirit I'm talking about the revealing of the son of man I realize this ain't for everybody I realize this ain't for everybody that claims they believe the message some of them will never go any farther than God sent a prophet and they'll go around and around and around and around this mountain and the bride will be gone and they'll still be going around and around and around this mountain but to the seat of Abraham God is calling watch this Christ you his own word now let us take St Luke 17:30 and watch what Jesus prophesied there saying as it was in the days of Sodom it'll be the same remember notice at this time the son of man would be revealed the revealing of the son of man now the son of man was actually revealed potentially for a few moments there just before Sodom was burned now that man was Elohim that was God and Jesus Is God and God was revealed potentially right there for a few moments and talked to Abraham in the investigation judgment just for a little bit the son of man was revealed the son of man Elohim do you see it church congregation says the son of man Elohim was revealed just for a few minutes if you believe God could reveal himself in human dust that he spoke into existence why would it be hard for you to believe that he could reveal himself in a prophet's body that has been washed claimed Sanctified by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ watch's this again in Abraham's Covenant show me one thing more that Abraham did show me one more sign he gave him than that sign there that was the last sign all knows that's the Bible readers amen the last sign was given this is the last sign Church Hear Me In The Name Of The Lord amen look friend and I believe God is moving among his people saving sanctifying filling with the Holy Ghost healing doing wonderful things but as one Bible believer and one message believer I am not looking for no world shaking Revival to where some mighty preacher is going to raise up and everybody in the message is going to follow him that is a lie there is no promise in the Bible there is no promise in the message of the hour according to what God's Vindicated Prophet said we have already received our last sign last sign remember thus saith the holy spirit this is your last sign write it in your Bible if something Rises beside this and greater than this call me a false prophet that's quite a statement I watch what I say I'm in contact with better than 10 million people around the world see so I have to say that and I know I didn't say that myself again Jesus Christ is saying now this Messiah was to have a sign and that sign was a god prophet he was not only a prophet but he was a god prophet he was the god of the prophets but his Messianic sign was to do the sign of a prophet now remember the Lord showed Peter whenever ananas and Safara had sold their place and they kept back a part of the property you remember that in the book of Acts and the Lord showed Peter what they had done and the Lord told him about it so he called him out and then called his wife out later that was not the Messiah son can God show people things sh can but the Messiah sign is one to a generation amen as I said it's not one of the gifts of the Spirit watch he has brought through you through every one those elements like he did Abraham with the confirmation of the Covenant give you the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues as the spirit gave atance and these different things like he's promised and now brought you right up and send his Spirit among you giving you divine discernment just before to prepare you for the coming son amen it's the last sign the church will receive can I go on the next thing to the Seed of Abraham they're getting their life sign of discernment just like it was in Jesus day that's the last sign to the church again Feast of the trumpets the last sign that Abraham ever seen before the promised sign came the promised son was what God in the form of a human being that could discern the thoughts of the people one man not a dozen one man no matter how many impersonations they had one and he deser the thoughts that was in there the next thing happened Abraham and Sarah were turned back to a young man and a young woman now notice after this revealing of the son of man in the plains of memory Abraham and Sarah were turned back to a young man and a young woman and she conceived and brought forth laughter praise be to God in Moses time in Exodus 3:7 and the Lord said I've surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their taskmasters and I know their sorrows and I am come down notice again now God didn't do this every time the people were in a mess only in certain occasion so God said I heard it and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that to a land good land large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry the children of Israel is coming unto me and I've also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians press oppressed them come now therefore and I will send thee that's right oh you mean so God come down but God did not go in that same form before Pharaoh how did he go in the form of Moses W praise the Lord boy y'all ain't had many amens this morning no they're fixing to get scarcer than the H teeth ain't they do we believe our Bible or not do we believe the message to the hour so God came down but he did not go visibly to where the people but oh I know that's God I know that's God but he anointed a prophet in his stead I'm going to go ahead and choke you God told Moses you will be a God to pharaoh and Aaron will be your Prophet oh I know that scares people to death look at your spelling of the word little small letter g o d little small letter g o d Look up the word this afternoon when you get time look at the word Elohim Elohim is plurality of God it shows that there's not three Gods but God has many attributes in his being some are revealed with lesser Glory some are revealed with lesser dignity and honor but it still comes from Elohim I'm going to go ahead and say it you was part of Elohim from the beginning or you'll never be part of that bride that's something inside of you is not something that you done it is part of Elohim it's not L you it's not L me it's loh him and if we are his elected we are part of Elohim [Applause] Hallelujah and I will send thee Hallelujah unto Pharaoh that thou mightest bring forth my people Exodus 23:20 behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way to bring thee into the place which I have prepared now remember this is not a created angel some angels had a beginning remember Paul talking about the elect Angels there son that's not elect there's some that had a day they began that's the ones the devil has access to you see actually your identity according to what the prophet taught us you was a part of them angels that didn't fall before the foundation of the world those angels which could fall had a day that they begin oh I like to remind the devil now and then and if you don't you should you need to wish him a happy birthday every now and then just to let him know you know he had a beginning and he will have an End Amen somebody say amen he had a day he started thou was created perfect until iniquity was found in thee he had a day he started he'll have a day he'll end he'll be the liest one no doubt in that Lake which burns with fire and brimstone all the rest of will die maybe some of them after 10,000 years some after a million years but no doubt he will be the very last one that will be annihilated I said annihilated for he will be no more praise be to God hallelujah but listen friend if you are part of Jesus Christ you never had a day you started and you don't have a day that you will end you are part of [Applause] God now watch this uncreated Angel it's the angel of God's presence watch an exodus 23:21 beware of him listen what God says I'm going to send an angel before you beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgression for my name is in him the angel sent by God is an extension of himself the angel of his presence you see to them names had much more of a significance than it does to us so if this angel had his name Yahweh had invested his name in this Angel then it's the same is God he's to be honored like God revered like God cuz it is God in a condescended form he's to be trusted obeyed and listened to it's not a creation Now something that spine off of God the angel is Jehovah himself in a temporary descent in a visible form God himself and a temporary descent invisibility in the sphere of visibility notice but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary to thine adversaries for mine Angel mine Angel what is this God's theophany Lord God my angel shall go before thee and bring thee into the amorites and the Hittites and the perizzites and the perizzites and the Canaanites and the hivites and the jebusites and I will cut them off Isaiah 63:9 and all their Affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence look at this Hebrew word paum the angel of his face person presence this is the exact same Hebrew word that God told Moses make you a table and make some bread and put on there call it the table of shoe bread the word shoe bread comes from this same Hebrew word the bread of his face the bread of his face upon them no wonder Jesus said I am that bread which came down from heaven that if a man eat of me he will never die don't you understand them 12 loaves placed upon the table all o represented the 12 tribes of the children of Israel so as the priest by representation ate the bread it was as of though the Jews themselves were eating the bread every age God has had a loaf of bread in every Church age what was it the message of the hour that came from God and the people of the age got a hold to the bread of the hour don't you understand why we live eating on the message of the hour it is the bread of his face and as we eat we are partaking of communion we're not feeding on the failing words of a man we're not feeding on the words of a Kian we are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man our message friends is the bread of this hour the bread of his face and if you eat it it changes you so what will the Rapture and the resurrection be Gathering all the loaves Gathering all the loaves to bring them up before his face Lord God act 7:37 this is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you from your brethren liken unto me him shall you hear this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake unto him in the Mount Si with our fathers who received the Lively oracles to give unto us who was it pre-incarnate Christ 1 Corinthians 10:9 neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents you mean Christ was in the wilderness Christ was actually back there they tempted Christ and they were bitten by serpents people that refuse the anointed Christ of this day still get by serpents Matthew 16:28 verily I say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste deaths till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom oh wow so there be some of you standing here that will not die until you see the son of man coming in his Kingdom ah the son of man and of course there was John let me close with this Luke 17:28 last likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot one out of Sodom it rain fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed revealed Apocalypto to uncover lay open what has been veiled or covered up ah disclose make bear disclose what was before unknown so it's not a parusia which is another Greek word used for comes come and coming so it's not a visible return it's simply taking the cover off of something that's been there so the people can be able to look at it don't you see why it's so dangerous when people walk away from this message and call this message false prophecy and call this Prophet a false prophet don't you understand how dangerous it is now remember these are the words of Jesus Luke 17:32 remember Lot's wife Luke 2127 then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud coming to come from one place to another metaphorically to come into being arise come forth find place or influence so there's going to be some people that's going to see the son of man not come in clouds as he said in Matthew 24 but will come in a cloud praise the Lord wonder what that cloud will look like head of a man no doubt the wigged one how blessed you are how blessed you are don't you understand friend this is not a bunch of preachers that got together this is not some man from down the hills of Kentucky got together and decided I'm going to be a prophet I want to I want to I want to make up a message and I I'm going to make people believe I'm this great person I'm that's not the type of man he was it was not him that called himself it was not him that imagined the angel walking in the floor at Green Mill it was not him that Vindicated himself an Ohio River it was not him that did all of these signs wonders and miracles TL osbor TL osbor daughter Sid Ross on and on and on and on of these Pentecostal people that are still making videos and programs and talking about the miraculous the supernatural I just saw one this week of TL Osborne's daughter and she was talking about the things that she saw as a young girl going there of her mother and father under the ministry of brother brand and the things that they told her that they saw they steal and she said he was the most anointed man that ever lived on the earth next to Jesus Christ I thought my goodness I she said with bobbed hair lipstick on and earrings and she can say it and get by with it if I say it they say I'm in a c but I say it with the understanding it wasn't just anointed to pray for the sick but God sent him with a message to call the bride out to what to call her to Jesus Christ that we could be United together not only to quote the this message but to live [Applause] it hallelujah hallelujah word [Applause] hallelujah St John 12:34 the people answered him we have heard out of the law that Christ abideth forever how sayest thou the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man then Jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you walk while you have the light ah so you're asking who someone is and that someone you're asking is the someone you're asking about and this is the answer that that someone gives back walk in the light yes sir while you have light lest the darkness come upon you for he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whether he goeth so he won't know if he's a woman or a man he won't know if he's a Baptist or a Methodist but I hope there's some people here today that know who you are Sons and Daughters of Goden and you know where you're going when Jesus comes you're going with him why we've been married to Christ don't you understand friend it well I'm going to jump over here Brothers Let's jump over to the very last quote that you have now we've had Elijah's and Elijah's coats and Elijah's manels and Elijah's everything but the Elijah of this day sir is the Lord Jesus Christ so you see that Elijah is not brother brandham it's the anointing of the son of man what is it he tells us in 1965 you know the anointing was in time it seems to be so hard for you to get it separated now he said the seventh angel is not the son of man but he's revealing to the public the son of man the son of man is Christ but have we recognized him I wonder when we hear these things do we recognize it was the Lord Jesus using his prophet's human instrumentality I don't think some of the preachers would do with the message what they do if they believe this today well I don't like that I don't believe this I don't like that I don't want that I don't take that I don't take that this is not a cafeteria okay this is not where you walk through and you get your plate God dished it out to you so he didn't do without amen this is not a cafeteria I don't like that I don't like this I don't like that I don't like this is not a cafeteria the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ he's to come according to Luke 17:30 says the son of man is to reveal himself among his people not a man God but it will come through it will come through notice God is not the prophet but it will come through you understand friend that ought to be so simple it will come through so how in the work could he tell those people your name is Mary you live on 22nd 32nd Street so and so I see you walking up three steps to your house you went to a doctor portly s heavy set man got glasses on he told you this that and other is that the truth is that the truth I don't know I don't know what I even said is that right is that right what was it it was the Lord Jesus revealing himself oh they love the signs I love the Wonders and then they say well it got off at the end where they say he got off is where we actually got on Amen they love the signs and the Wonders and the Miracles but we love the message I said we love the message he goes to North Carolina you find interstates named after Billy Graham you go through different states here and this bridge is named after this state trooper and this Road's named after this man and that man and that man and we have no Bridge is named after him we have no roads named after him because he didn't come to leave a legacy of prophet worship but he said his desire was to be able to lead people that they could have a relationship with Jesus Christ look friends as message people if we do not have that we have not took what he said he don't want to be a bunch of prophet worshippers or Pastor worshippers he wants us to worship God amen have we recognized the son of man has come Among Us the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus himself I hear him say what was it Topeka 1964 June now the time has come that we must recognize who's in our SE city today the Lord Jesus himself Hallelujah if you can separate the two you're so blessed if you can hear the voice coming through the human instrumentality not idolize the human instrumentality but you're the bridegroom's call you're so blessed don't idolize your pastor no evangelist no other great man I just read it this week God's Prophet said when you go to lifting a man higher than you're supposed to God will allow that man to fall in front of you so you will get your eyes off of him don't do preachers that way there's one we should worship amen that's the Lord Jesus thank God for every man of God pray for him we love him we honor him but don't make Idols out of kn men friends you do yourself and them a great dishonor oh Hallelujah don't you love him how blessed are we sister Judy brother Harvey and sister Shirley was there some of those meetings got married and went to the service that night then you'all brother Harvey no doubt they could share some real stories with us of what they saw and what they heard and must have just been overwhelming but I guarantee you he'd be the first one to say he sees more now about the message and what it was than he did actually sitting there under the man himself right sister Judy why it's the time we're sitting in the tent Door In the Heat of the day friends when he was here the fullness of the light was shining on him brother Rob now it's shining on us on us God bless you I love you so much B together oh Jesus thank you thank you Lord I don't know that I'll ever forget as long as I'm in my right mind when I stood there on March the 27th of 1983 that little church in Kentucky and I preached that you had sent a prophet to the Earth the people could tell I was leading up to something but they didn't know what I laid out in the scripture and laid out the Old Testament and the new and then I brought it right up to pointing them to a prophet in this day so that was in March in May I preached about the revealing of the son of man in May of 83 so here I am June of 24 I'm still preaching about the same son of man Christ Jesus Oh Glory to God it was your call that we heard father like that eagle come out that barnyard so we coming out of our religion coming out of our sin I trust today they've not just heard the voice of another Kentucky preacher but they also have heard the Holy Ghost crying out this is why Lord we'll not turn to the left nor to the right we've had all kinds of men rais up in this message and how many brides revivals have we had and every one of them points back to some man somewhere claiming he's the one doing it Lord Jesus we're so close to the end we will not sell out we know the bride's Revival is not following some spectacular man somewhere some great super church somewhere it's us as individuals being so filled with the Holy Ghost that the prophet said every fiber of our being being filled with the presence of God and we'll be so full of deity that one morning somewhere between 7 and 9 our cells will start changing our bones our brain matter our toenails our toes our hair
