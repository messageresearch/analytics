it such a privilege for us to be gathered together Let's uh read this question and then we'll read a couple of scriptures here it was one that I didn't get finished with um last time and it was so good that I hated to cut it short now I've already heard that from some of our young people that they said the only downside about brother Donnie answering questions is he preaches a sermon with every question and one of the reasons I do that is because I had a an excellent teacher his name was William Maran random so I never had course and an when I was a a youth whenever I gave my heart to the Lord as a matter of fact I never attended a youth service the first youth service I ever attended I preached so having Youth Services we never had it whenever I went we never had nothing for the use at all so you'll have to kind of forgive me if I don't know what I'm doing here cuz this is my first go around at this you know question for brother Donnie if you haven't gone through a great trial does that mean you don't have the Holy Ghost Philippians chapter 3 verse 8 yeah doubtless I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord whom I have suffered the loss of all things the loss of all things and do count them but Dum that I may win Christ well all of us probably have to say that same thing that he said more than likely not he goes on in verse n and say we may be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ that the the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings and this is what makes it so astounding to me that actually the things that the Lord lets us go through not things we bring on ourself but the things that the Lord allows us to go through he actually attributes it to his sufferings and that we are suffering with with him so we enter into his sufferings and the fellowship now most of us don't want this kind of Fellowship do we the human part but it's a great honor really and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death let's just pray over the word now father we love you so much tonight we thank you for once again giving us this privilege Lord Jesus that we could stand before your people I love them so much I thank you Lord they have a desire to come together again we were just here last night but they wanted together again tonight and I'm so thankful that have this burden and this desire and this pull to come to the house of God I pray that you'd help me to be able to get out of the way father and if there's a need here that lays outside of these question and answers make me sensitive to the holy ghost that I can be able to follow you bless us now as we sit together father in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated because a person has not went through a great trial does that mean that they don't have the Holy Ghost no it certainly does not as our journey of God With God rather is ordained of him our our experiences um our great experiences is in him so also are our trials that he sends us our way they also are ordained of God each one of us will go through the things that will be necessary and essential in order to complement what he has called us to be as we looked at it last week about Paul that none of the rest of the Apostles that we could read about in the book of Acts or and the rest of the Epistles in the New Testament or if I found and set in the N fathers the an father and hups to babblin many of the church uh records and things that I've been able to read about did any of them ever go through the same thing that Paul did but it didn't mean that they didn't suffer they did and all of us will suffer but that doesn't mean that we will suffer in our body it doesn't mean that you'll be a martyr for the Lord Jesus uh if we were living in the days of polycarp and the days of those type of people then we would have an anointing that would help us to be able to give our lives um as they did yet we know that we're called into a different age we're not called to an age of martyrdom and we know that martyrdom for the most part will not happen in this day there's still some no doubt I mean I've been to China and I know what they go through there and they're arrested as you know I was there when brother biscop was arrested many years ago and it was a very scary type of thing because they were looking for me and they were searching their database and looking for my entry and brother Bisal had my itinerary uh with him so we separated once we got there and I went One Direction he went another and he had my itinerary in his briefcase and when they arrested him he started tearing it up in pieces and started swallowing that so they wouldn't be able to locate where I was and find out the city that I was in he was a Canadian they thought I was a Canadian so they come in and ask him again Donnie Reagan is he Canadian and he had to tell him the truth no he's an American well for me um you know it was a frightening thing I'd never dealt with anything like that before so my brother Bisal when he was able to make a phone call he called his wife and said it would be a great time to be in Happy Valley so he was knowing that he was monitored by the Chinese police and the government so then sister Bisal called brother Tom Ray brother Tom Ray called me in China brother Donnie you need to leave us I'm not leaving I'm not leaving our brother here in jail I'm not a coward so brother Murphy was with me he said brother Donnie you don't understand it's not that you're a coward you can get out of here but for these people they live here they'll be the ones that'll be arrested and thrown in jail and they may never get out and I thought that puts it in a total different thing I couldn't keep from thinking you know if that were to be said about us in America you wonder how many people would come to our church if there was a risk that we could be be arrested we could be thrown in jail but will that be every one of our lot it will not but it does not mean that we will not suffer for him some of you will suffer uh because of the leot toan spirit you sisters no doubt you've already suffered an element of persecution by the way that you dress and the way that you look and there's a reproach that comes with that we know that and you will suffer in that way some of you Brothers you may suffer because you will be honest in your line of work and if if you would be dishonest you'd be able to maybe do a few other things and you know might do a little things underhanded under the table as we would say and yet you will suffer an element of reproach oh yeah he's a goody to shoes he will never do this you know he's Mr Golden Boy W think brother Joe he's this and that and the other well you're suffering for the cause of the Lord Jesus now compared to a martyr is that suffering well no we'd probably look at and think that's not much of anything but if that's what God allocated for you to go through the thing is that we want to do is be pleasing to him one of the worst things we can do is compare ourselves to other people I want you to notice that Paul again he picks this up in Colossians 1:23 if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereof I Paul and made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you so Paul was able to make a division here between the sufferings that was only for the cause of Christ and actually some of them were for the people of God every true God call in will do suffering for the saints of God a pastor will suffer in one way for the people an evangelist will suffer in a total different way I can't I I cannot wait until we're able to get there that day and we see God's Prophet as he walks up up there and God will reward him for all he went through for us to bring us this great message I thank God for it don't you every every Minister God call Minister will go through so much and it will be of course at at the alotment of God and they will suffer because of being called of God so were their wives so were their children so here Paul says now in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church now if a preacher gets caught being a liar he's not suffering for the cause of Christ if he gets caught running around with somebody else's wife guess what that's not for the cause of Christ if he gets caus caught because he's stealing money or something like that that's not for the cause of the Lord Jesus that's because the man's a deceiver and he's not living what he's preaching is that right but there's an element of suffering then that goes with the ministry this is why person should never preach unless they are genuinely called of God because this type of thing right here will drive you out of your minds this is why people cannot take it they think they want to be a preacher and then they enter into the suffering for the body's sake and they realize I cannot handle this so he says it for for in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church now James wrote about it in a little different way James chapter 5: 10 and my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffer Affliction and of patience again in verse 11 behold we count them happy which endure you have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy and yet there's not a man like job in the entire Old Testament I mean Jesus himself come and said have you not heard or read of the patience of Job he never said that even about Abraham he never said that about Isaac Jacob Joseph any of the Patriarchs but job had this one trial Which history tells us last it about the span of a year so a year could be quite a lengthy time depending on what you're going through but you think of the years that he spent before that trial and the years that he spent after that trial and yet what comes to our mind whenever we think of the man job it's what all he went through and yet looking at it it was a very short Span in comparison to all the other lengths of days that God give him but has he been a blessing to you yeah he's been a b blessing to countless millions of people down Through the Ages but remember remember he didn't ask for that it was not him saying hey God you need somebody to go through a trial it wasn't job that wanted that but God knew he needed a man like job I'm glad I'm not a job I'll tell you one thing I'm so grateful that God had him because he's been such a blessing to us notice again in 1 Peter chap 2: 19 for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief suffering wrongfully now see in a a situation like this this is not even speaking just necessarily about a preacher notice how Peter writes this for this is thankworthy if a man or a woman of course in in this case whichever it would be for conscience toward God so just for conscience sake toward God so you as a young person you're placed in a situation and your your conscience by the spirit of God taught by the word now I shouldn't do this this is not right for me to do this I I cannot do it maybe the school wants you to do this or your employer wants you to do that but yet the spirit of God within you says no this is not right and because you won't do it you know that your your boss might kind of frown on you a little bit and you're you're somebody you're going to school with oh come on you're just too oldfashioned but why are you doing that because there's something in you that your conscience is toward God and James says that if you'll suffer or Peter rather suffer wrongfully for what Glory is it when you be buffeted for your faults boy we've all got enough of them don't we but there's no glory when we're buffeted for our faults but he said You shall take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it so this is a category that absolutely every person that you're tonight and there's hundreds that'll be streaming the service and archive it later so those of you that are not in this visible audience whenever you you suffer for the cause of the Lord Jesus so don't get it in your mind that you've got to be you know you've got to be a a martyr you've got to be somebody that God will allow you to go through some horrible terrific trial and you'll be there for years and years well you I've never been through any of that you don't have to but what you will do is you will be faithful to whatever God and his wisdom allows you to go through and when you stand before him that day he will reward you for every one of those times that you would be honest and true and you would suffer for being a child of God how many knows what I'm talking about no doubt every one of you went through it already so he said when you do well and suffer for it if you take it patiently that is acceptable with God and 1 Peter 4:1 16 notice this is strange because to us the term Christian is used very very often this one of the few times in the New Testament that you'll find it the only time actually that you'll find it being phrased as an identification of a term Christian because Christian was a term that was actually a term of ridicule and it was not actually the Believers that started using it first but it was the infidels and they started calling them Christians which was means Christos which was Christlike but here Peter adapts this term because by now in this stage in the first century that accepted it that they were being called Christians yet if any man suffer not as a preacher not as a prophet not as a pastor but as a Christian how many of you all have suffered as a Christian just as a Christian your hair your dress you won't do this you won't do that see you have already suffered as a Christian if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed and let me not to add to the word but let me say not just a man now but you Sisters You Suffer as a daughter of God and we all know we're conscious of it and we know that in the natural sense the sisters in the message will suffer more by their appearance than will the men because the hair most of the men I mean they don't have their hair hanging down their back you know you don't see any of our men going around in many skirt although Carolyn I saw a guy the other day and it was one of the most bizarre things I ever seen in my life the man had a beard and he had on a pair of glistening high heel shoes and had on a dress I mean it just about make you vomit and people just looking at him and looking at him it was just absolutely bizarre but and I thought you know there that man is actually suffering reproach for this image I'm not sure what he was trying to prove but had on uh you know these glistening silver high heel shoes and a dress and a beard of all things and a woman's hat now you talking about weird I don't know if the man didn't have time to shave before he went out looking like a woman I I don't know but you think that the the people laughing at him people looking at him turning around the corner and I thought he's bearing reproach for a sin that unless you get delivered from will take him to hell and you be reproach for what is right so don't be ashamed don't be ashamed let's look at the church age book now about this about suffering page 116 now the Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not unmindful at all of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer now he reads this scripture here in Malachi this is why they ask in Malachi 1 1:3 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel about Malachi I have loved you sayith the Lord yet we say wherein hast thou loved us now God said I've Loved You Israel and Israel said what you're telling us you've loved us I have loved you sayith the Lord yet we say wherein has thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother sayith the Lord and yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau I laid his mountains and his Heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness is you see they could not figure out God's love and I'm going to tell every one of you tonight including me I can't either we'll never figure out God's love it will not make sense at times God will be doing things out of love and the prophet mentions the term in the Third Exodus I believe it's June latter part of June 63 and he uses the ter term the tender hand of Jehovah the only place I've ever found it that he uses it quite that way and he's talking about the Jews been driven back into the Homeland and it was the tender hand of Jehovah and we can see that same tender hand in our lives but it sure don't seem very tender it didn't seem like to me it was very tender when my daddy would take his hand I never got a whole lot of weapons from my daddy but I can still still remember them so they were pretty outstanding and whenever he got done I ain't never beat me or none of that sort of thing but he would whoop me now Mama whooped me too as a matter of fact Mama whooped me about a month before I got married my mama stood about that tall and I knew in about a month I was going to get married so I had something I wanted to say to my mama and after I said it I wish I hadn't cuz my little mama grabbed me and got grabbed the switch and I mean she let me have it and I deserved it too because I was disrespectful to her and I should have never said it I would to God I could take it back and never say that to her so I didn't understand it but once I started H being a father and having children myself I realized how painful that parental love really was you hear the common term today tough love and we know what it means it means that sometimes that real love you have to be tough and you've got to say no I'm not supply buying you any more money to support your drinking habit or your you know your habit of addiction of this and that they use it all the time you know dealing with addictions and it is a tough love and God is the author of real genuine tough love and God knows sometimes he has to be tough on his kids I'm glad he is don't you but notice now what they thought love meant they thought that love meant no suffering you'd be surprised that the Christians that think the same thing they thought that love meant a baby was parental care but God said his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that we were chosen unto salvation because God had chosen to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth which he's quoting the scripture there he may commit you to death you mean God out of love may commit our loved ones to death all of us have seen that have we not parents grandparents siblings children and God commit them to death and then people look at it there's people that have left our church that no longer serve God because God took their mother God took their father God took a child and and they just build this attitude against God I I I've never understood that myself I don't understand why he always does it but I've never understood getting an attitude against the only source that will help you ever understand it so you cut yourself off from the source and the resource of everything that you have need of but some people look at it that way God if you love me you would have let this happen they don't understand the love of God the love of God has nothing to do with the ups and the downs and the ends and the outs of life it has to do with God elected you before the foundation of the world and we have a promise that all things all things all things don't come from God but even the things that come from the devil he will M make those things work together for our good aren't you glad for that so his proof was a ction he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job so God may choose people I think of my friend brother Ron Spencer and all that he's been through you didn't know it and I wasn't going to say anything about it till after he had made it public today but the doctors had told brother Ron that he had cancer in both eyes he went to the doctor on Tuesday and before the main visit they told him you're probably going to have to have a treatment in the one eye and possibly the other eyeball removed so this is the way they start out their day all day Tuesday was one scan after another and doctors and this and that and another reading of the scans so when they got to the eye specialist the oncologist of the eye he said there is no cancer in your eyes the doctors themself called it a miracle that's our God that's our God but then you look at it and you think they've done showed it in the scan that it was there and they had called him several times because they' really really concerned about the situation and you think the same God that could have touched that could not he went through the entire body and took every bit of it out at one time could he not have done that of course he could we know that he could so why didn't he he must have a reason that's beyond what we know and what we understand is that right how many times did we pray for Erica and we saw God move for her over and over again and the same God that moved for her could not he went inside of her body and took every bit of that out and annihilated that thing could he not have done it I'm sure he could have we've seen him do it before so he had a apparently he had a reason do I understand do you understand it brother Donnie I don't understand it a bit more than you do but I trust him and I believe him whether whether I ever understand it in this life or not I've already heard one testimony after another after another we got one from a sister in the church just a few days ago she was telling Carol she said I felt like I should share this with you and brother Donnie she said I've been going through this thing and this situation in her life and she said every time I get so low and so discouraged she said I think about sister Erica and I think about how she would press through it and she said that that's how I get so encouraged I've heard that from preachers in different part of the world that little girl is gone to meet her reward but her testimony is still living on this very night so you see what God's doing God allowed her to go through that thing and you know what God took her her reward she's gone there no more suffering no more sickness but ask her her daughters are they suffering uing they are ask me I'm still crying I'm still lamenting my heart is still broken Lance and I had to go to the cemetery yesterday for some things to finish up there that was all I could do to pull in there I'm still suffering she's not but his will to end her suffering brought her deeper suffering to me to her husband to her children to her mother and to many of you I know many of you are I can see it on your face tonight you're suffering you're suffering because the will of God to take her added a suffering that will never be lifted from our hearts totally we will never get over it ain't that right so you think it must be for a greater cause it must be for his will so how am I going to react like a Son of God ought to react because she got there by being faithful in her suffering I'm going to get there the same way I'm going to be faithful in mine I'm suffering different I suffered I suffered when she was here I suffered every time I had to take her to the doctor every time I had to take her with a chemo and I'd have to lead her in because she'd be so sick she could hardly walk I took her more than anybody did I saw those times I'd pray with her every time I would lay my hands on her and pray for her I'd be there when she couldn't hard even walk and get out of there I suffered for several years and now my suffering has changed I'm not suffering cause she's sick I'm suffering cause she's gone but am I going to get mad at God are you kidding me I need him now more than ever before and his proof of his love to me is in his election oh but Brother Don you're a preacher you understand these things no I'm telling you I don't understand I don't understand but I believe him anyway he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as it did job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose let's skip on down there just a little bit there talking about the Lord Jesus in Hebrews 589 though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered maybe God needs to teach me something during this type of suffering I buried 144 people since I've been the pastor of this church 13 or 14 in 20 2023 I cried for every one of them a piece of my heart I've walked in front of caskets a portion of my life has been filled with death a huge portion of death over my life weeping and crying and seeing people suffer oh it's I I hate it I hate that part but God called me for that purpose he had to equip me to be able to deal with that I'm I'm a tenderhearted person by Nature so it it breaks my heart every sick person I see I'm out at Walmart and I see a little crippled up mama you know what I want to do I want to lay hands on her I was talking to a car salesman the other day he was telling me about his granddaughter went that day she was that very day getting her a treatment for can answer and I got ready I was talking to him for just a few minutes he reached over and shook my hand I said can I pray for you he said yes so he and I sit there in that business one of the business here in Johnson City the presence of God come in that little booth where we were as I offered prayer for that man for his granddaughter Mia her mother had donated her stem celles we prayed for her the Lord Jesus apparently didn't care that it wasn't in church because his presence come down in that little booth where we were you know why I could do that cuz I told him I said my daughter passed away some months ago said so I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I could have prayed for the man if ER had still been alive but I could pray for him and his granddaughter because you could see the pain that he was dealing with so my suffering brought the presence of God I plan on going back to talk to that man again and find out how Mia is today you see our lord Jesus could not suffer as being Spirit but as we looked at it last night he suffered so much and become a goat on that cross I've been studying it even more today and brother renam said that he died the death of a sinner so that we could sit here tonight and be saved he died alone in his death so if we have to die we won't be alone in ours look what suffering done to him it made him a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities look what suffering will do to us it will make us more compatible to people around us and help us to feel and mean knows what I'm talking about in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering according to Paul he's left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did he want this James 1 2 to4 my brethren countered all joy when you fall un to diverse Temptation knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing Romans 8:17 and if children then heirs Heirs of God joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together I hope that answers your question on that part let me close that with this quote here when you're sick and tired of this whole life and you love the appearing of the Lord Jesus better than you love your food at the table your wife or your children then there's a crown laid up for you not a crown a gold crown that they put upon your head but a body free from Pain crowned in the glory of God crowned in the immortality of Jesus Christ can't you see what awaits you young people this is what awaits you not that they're going to put a star crown on top of our head but we will have a body that will be a body liken to his own glorious body that's what's laid up for you that the Lord the righteous judge will give it at that day that's the day we look forward to all the suffering that you and I go through in this life it won't even be worthy to be compared to the glory that's revealed thank you Lord another question because the Lord is supreme and Sovereign and rules all why will Jesus need to be crowned if the Lord is supreme because the Lord is supreme and Sovereign and rules all why will Jesus need to be crowned that's a very good question I really enjoy enjoyed studying this one Psalms 110:1 David prophesying and he said a Psalm of David the Lord said unto my Lord the Lord capital L capital O capital r capital D said unto my capital L little o little r Little D the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol now when Jesus came on the earth this is not just something that a person can read up or open up and read rather like a newspaper and be able to understand Paul says great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles received up into Glory God was so God preached unto the Gentiles so whenever the scribes the lawyers and the educated people come to Jesus to ask him questions Jesus would ask them questions many times and he would ask it in such a way that it intentionally would cause them to stumble because they were trying to approach it from here instead of here so Jesus now asked them this question and he refers to this Psalm what think ye of Christ so now the the scribes had asked him a question and Jesus says saying what think ye of Christ whose son is he they say unto him the son of David he saith unto them how does David in the spirit called him Lord saying the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand till I make thine enemies thy foottoo if David then called him Lord how is he his son so lordship and sunship has to be looked at in the right way or you'll come out with two every time and it can be so confusing now Jesus said this on purpose and it absolutely just set these guys Minds in a WHL now notice what it done and no man was able to answer him a word neither does any man from that day forth ask him any more questions now it befuddled them they just didn't know what to say and it must have embarrassed them and they said I'll never do that again that was the end of question and answers so now why will Jesus have to be crowned when he's Lord of all now he is but as we looked at it last night now watch in Hebrews 2:9 but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of deaths crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste deaths for every man but now remember Jesus the man was what become the goat Jesus the man was what become the serpent on the pole the Father which Liv lived in him which was Spirit now keep in your mind that you are a trinity as well you have a soul a spirit and a body and when you see my body you have seen me in one way in another way I've never seen you and you have never seen me you have never seen my soul I've never seen it I've never seen yours you've never seen your spirit or my spirit but yet you kind of have an idea of what my spirit is and what my soul is by the way my body acts is that right so when you think about the godhead don't think about God being this old man in heaven and then God looked over and heaven and that was this younger man and God said son I need somebody to go down and die on the cross now would you do that for me would you be willing to do that for me and the little boy said you know what Daddy I believe I would will that's not the way the Bible projects it at all in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God now God Paul says it this way that God is that one who dwelt in the realm of immortality Jesus says in St John 4 God is a spirit God is a spirit not a man so God is a spirit but God wanted to become man and he did in Jesus Christ so what was that it was an extension of himself now notice my spirit my soul my body all three of those are me so what happens at deaths that Spirit goes back to God who gave it your spirit actually breaks up the prophet tells us when you die and in the resurrection you will not have a human spirit anymore you will have a soul a theophany and a glorified body you were never intended to have a human spirit because he was intended to have the theophany but you bypass it the aony that you could be tested what is the human Spirit made of five inlets imagination conscience memory reason and affection that's what gets us in so much trouble but in the glorified body we'll have the seed which is the soul and we'll have the theophany and the glorified body all three again in to make the one unit so father son Holy Ghost very same God all along but manifested himself in those three attributes so the body of Jesus Christ has never yet been crowned now remember he is a high priest whenever appeared remember the prophet uses the example whenever he appeared to one of the church A's Messengers and St Martin was his name and this angel appears and he looks like Jesus and he appears to him and said Martin don't you know me worship me and he St Martin kept looking at him had on a a brilliant looking robe and all that sort of thing but he had a crown on his head so he said Martin don't you know me don't you know me worship me and Martin looked at him and said get behind me Satan you have got a crown on your head Jesus has not yet been crowned his Saints will crown him there was never a king in the Old Testament or a priest which was able to carry both offices merged together in one now there was one in the Old Testament by the name of Uzziah and Uzziah tried to enter into a position of being a priest and God smot him with Leprosy because that was saved for himself to be King prophet and priest Trinity of offices manifested in that one body so the body of the Lord Jesus was brought to the Earth in order that God might have a permanent human Temple let's read it again there in verse 10 of chapter 2 of Hebrews for it became him for of whom are all things and by whom are all things that in bringing many sons unto Glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings again sufferings verse 11 for both he that sanctifies and they who are Sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashame to call them Brethren saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church shall I sing praise unto thee and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I am the children which which God has given me now watch Paul as he's taking the priesthood of the Lord Jesus and showing that like Aaron Aaron the high priest was taken from among his Brethren God told the people of Israel in the Old Testament the book of Exodus I will make you a kingdom of priests now this was God's original will that God wanted all of Israel to be a priesthood but they sinned of course and then God accepted the tribe of Levi and Levi then would be the called out ones and they would be the ones that would Minister for the rest of the tribes and then there was an order of the priests there were The Men Who tore down the Tabernacle they could not actually offer sacrifices so there was several different orders the average everyday person could not carry the tent they could not carry the manora they could not carry the furniture but even all of those were a branch of the cheras sites and all of that that carried the Temple of the Lord and then Aaron was the high priest so he was called out separate from among the rest of his Brethren he typified our lord Jesus so our lord Jesus is the high priest but yet we are priests as well you believe that the Lord one in Sunday will be looking at that we are priests which makes us intercessors and we can also offer sacrifices to the Lord except not for the atonement of sin sacrifice of praise our bodies a Living Sacrifice and so on but the Lord Jesus become one of us that he might become our high priest now look at what Paul goes on to say for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that have power of death which which is the devil so the Lord Jesus when he was raised from the dead he was given this glorified body but no no time in the Revelation or no time as far as the natural appearance when he raised from the dead and the disciples saw him did they ever note that there was a crown on his head now remember right now he's the high priest this is why it's important for you to understand the difference between high priest and kingship he is in the office of high priest and as long as there's one member on the earth of the elect that's not been yet fully redeemed he must be in that office of high priest but he cannot have on Bloody garments and be crowned it would be Unbecoming for his wife to see him with these bloody garments on so once he redeems that last one let me just say it to you like this that he will step in behind the curtain as it were and change his garments and when he comes out even John sees him with a different apparel on from the book as we looked at it last night of Revelation chap 5 that's whenever he sees him coming riding on a white horse then he's G about the paps the chest area here with a different type of a of a an attire because the garments that he wears display the office that he's in so if I would have come in here tonight and I would have been dressed like a hippie okay I'd have come in with sandals y'all know I don't like sandals anyway but if I had on sandals and I had on you know baggy breaches and I looked like on a hippie and I'd have on a hippie looking shirt and you say I can't believe brother Donnie look like that W that's not like brother Donnie my goodness that's not fitting you know what you'll never see me nothing like that cuz I don't dress that way I ain't a hippie or a yippie or a nothing like else like that I am who I am but we all know that what we dress like has a reflection of the way we really are well it's the same way with the Lord Jesus so he is not yet been crowned his Humanity now in that he's received a glorified body part of the shakina of he's he's going to come into has already been there I hope you understand any of our loved ones that have gone on and entered into the sixth Dimension my daughter Erica has already been crowned in the sense that she has received that glorified or that theophany body rather but she will be fully crowned when she receives a glorified body in the resurrection notice how brother Ram deals with this in the future home when he went up out of the water now that's talking about the Lord Jesus being baptized he said I saw the heavens open the prophet saw it and he saw the heavens open here come descending Out of Heaven form of a dove a voice saying this is my part of the earth that I have redeemed you mean God wanted to be a part of the earth wow why in the world would he want that why wouldn't he just create himself one well he did whenever he went to peer to Abraham him and two angels the prophet said he just went took some dust up off the Earth and and he stepped into a body two angels stepped into a body and he him went walking down the road with a staff in his hand dress like a man look like a man talk like a man Abraham killed a calf or had a servant too Sarah went in and fixed him a sandwich brought him some meal milk out and he sat down and eat a sandwich almighty God in a body that he'd breathed life into but what happened to that body he stepped right out of that body after his visitation to Abraham and went right back to the dust of the earth that was not in intended to be his permanent dwelling he could appear in a bush he could appear in a fire why he's a spirit so he could get inside a bush he could get inside of whatever he wanted to because he did not yet have a permanent body but when Mary conceived by the spoken word God said this is my part of the earth it will be mine forever I'll live in it I'll look out of it I'll talk out of it I'll heal out of it I'll raise the dead out of it and one day I'll set it on the throne and I'll hang above it and I'll call it my son for it is me in another form I've just reading to Carol before I came this evening someone had sent me a video and they were it was talking about that when a woman conceives a child and she carries that child even after that child is birthed by that woman some of those child that that child's cells remain in that woman's body I thought I thought wow that that is absolutely amazing so I sent it to Carol she's looking at it and she said you think it's really the truth I said well there's one way to find out let's Dr Google and we'll just see so sure enough I found one after another scientific news and Ma and one after another after another and they have scientifically proven that when a woman carries a child and gives birth to that child decad after that child leaves her body they have found cells from that child in women's Brains liver lungs they actually found the Y chromosome listen this the Y chromosome which is the male chromosome in females bodies of course and it come by them giving birth to Sons and even though them Sons had been long gone from their mother's womb that woman was still carrying that male chromosome in her body I told Carol I said Glory I said If a woman can do that it shouldn't be hard for us to believe that we were a cell if you please or a gene that would come from the very mind of God and even though we're down here he still carries a part of Us in him tonight praise the Lord so God said this is my part of the earth and from this part of the earth I will redeem the rest of it so God in the Plan of Redemption had to have his own humanity and he would call it his son so there's things that I could say about my flesh that I can't say about my spirit My Flesh has five inlets see taste feel smelling here my spirit has five I just quoted them to you my soul has one so people try to make a trinity and they'll say well there's things that you can say about the son that you can't say about the father I totally agree with that but I can also say things about my soul that I can't say about my spirit that don't mean I'm three people that means all three of them make me one complete unit so God said this is my part of the earth oh my I will redeem the rest of it for he is my word made manifest the whole world I spoke into existence by my word Hebrews 11 and Satan has held it to this time but I've come to redeem it and so much of it has made his body and I'm coming to dwell in it and John said I I saw the holy city the New Jerusalem descending from God out of heaven now watch brother random goes straight from the Lord Jesus to the city coming down from heaven as a bride adorned for it husband where did it settle on just like it did on there so he brings this now the spirit of God came and settled down on the Lord Jesus in The River Jordan and he jumps way over here on the eth day to when John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem descending from God out of heaven and he said where did it settle on just like EXA that it did there upon the Earth Jesus was a part of that Earth that the Holy Ghost descended on do you all understand the difference between Jesus and Christ you understand the difference Jesus is the flesh use yourself as an example your flesh through a mixing together of your mother's chromosomes 23 from her and 23 from your father your flesh started being formed from the coming together of those chromosomes but your spirit was not formed by them your soul was not formed by them so you took on their DNA is that right then you begin to Interchange the said to you the cells in your mother's body some of you young ladies sitting here tonight that are married now you've got your own family yet have sign should be able to do it they could still show some of your cells inside of your mother's body though you are a separate individual being and God still has every one of his seed a part of them inside of him this very night in his thinking part of his being and God said I want to be a human I want to be a human so I'll make myself a body that's Jesus so John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem descending like a comet or of Dove coming down out of heaven and settling on an entire redeemed Earth to do what to claim every attribute that he made the Earth for every man that was ready represented in eternity every woman is redeemed in she's been scoured and burned by fire watch him now go straight from the earth back to Jesus Jesus and his fiery Temptations in the wilderness for 40 days notice then his ministry think of it the Holy Ghost descending upon Earth Jesus and that Holy Blood now watch I hope I don't go too deep for you that Holy Blood that was created by God the blood the life the creation of God Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God and the creation of God will be crowned now when will it be at the resurrection at the resurrection you see he could not get his crown yet until the work of high priest is completed when the Rapture takes place there will be no more Gentiles saved on the earth that'll be it Mercy Seat is closed he will then turn and deal with the Jews 144,000 as a nation and they will come back to him then what will happen we in the resurrection will Crown our lord Jesus praise be to God you see it was like the Song of Solomon when you read it and you understand the way they did it that whenever they would spend an entire week seven days an entire week of celebrating the nuptials the marriage both the groom and the bride would be crowned in those seven days the people would eat they would drink it was just one festivity after another for a whole entire week and both the bridegroom and the bride wore a crown and Solomon says that his mother was the one who crowned him with many crowns so in the symbol in the marriage supper of the Lamb oh think of it the prophet said that great table was spread down through there for thousands of miles long the resurrection will take place first the day and Christ shall rise first and they'll go appearing to us but I'll tell you one thing I'm looking forward to that hour I'm going to have a lot of saints appear to me praise God glory to God and the prophet said once you start seeing them you know it won't be long that you're going to be changed and he said think of it missing people you come up together missing on the earth they can't find you no more but you're missing what what's happened you've moved into another dimension why he's changed garments and he says he knows how we are in streetport 1965 or 63 rather he knows how we are that we'll be looking around for one another did brother so and so make it the brother so and so make it sister so and so so he allows us to get together first so we all get together you imagine we turn totally invisible to the people that's living on the earth we will come up missing on the earth now do you understand that Erica brother Jim bab all of our loved ones that have gone on they're no more than 20 feet from where we are right now they're not that far away but they simply stepped into another dimension and so that Dimension is just a little farther back than what you are setting right there Hallelujah and we will step into that Dimension we'll still be here for a bit and we will step into that Dimension missing on the earth and we all greet one another oh how you been oh it's so good to see you oh it's so good to see you and then he will call for us to come up and we'll all begin to transcend and go beyond this world following him as we move out of this real here in the first four that we know and then we would have moved into this other dimension our bodies would have been changed and we'll gather together I I know it may seem very strange to you but we will still be so human that when we sit down at that table tears will come from our eyes as we take our seats at that table brother B said we'll reach across the table and Shake one another's hands them battle scarred veterans he'll let us all be seated and the angels will be the ones that'll be seatless and we'll all sat down there imagine there'll be a great hush that'll take place and here he comes and he steps out and we go to look at him and he comes up near you and near you and you all of you and you feel his hand as it goes to PCH touching your shoulder and you raise up and look at him the tears running down out of your eyes may be the last time you'll ever cry again and he reaches down and gets his robe and he says don't cry don't cry no more it's all over I love you child you're mine I'm yours it's all over your suffering your tests your trials oh I don't know exactly what the order of it will be well somehow there will be a this great place where we would be walking up to and he will be there it will not be the Judgment seat but more the reward seat and then we will be rewarded each of us and we will take our crowns as it were cast him as his feet so it was the shulamite Solomon's mother Bas Sheba made his crown but it was the shulamite who said it upon his head shulamite is the feminist form of Solomon who better to give the Lord Jesus his crown than his wife now remember Peter has been in the sixth dimension for over 2,000 years he still has not seen the Lord Jesus yet neither has Paul neither has any of the Saints in any of the church ages it would be Unbecoming for them to see him in his Priestly office they are all waiting can't you understand why all the ages are waiting on us every age is waiting on us if we do not come to completion and maturity there will never be a resurrection Jesus will never be crowned but I'm not worried about that not happening or you it will happen because we will come to maturity the crowning of the king of kings is waiting on us it praise the Lord let me let me find a place to stop the city was a throne in the top Revelation 21:23 and they had no need for the light for the lamb the Lord God is the light thereof the Lord God is that Pillar of Fire that followed the children of Israel through the winters and listen in the eighth day it's not like you're going to see an old man on one throne and a younger guy on another Throne what you will see as the father is this light this Pillar of Fire this Brilliance that's around the throne but there will be a human body sitting on the throne that is glorified that's the Lord Jesus he ascended up on the throne in that perfect Kingdom when the kingdom that Jesus is to surrender to the father that God may be all in all Jesus sets upon his throne here as our Joseph and the king is that light that will be on top of the Mount Zion and His Holy Light will flood the entire city now remember John said that the city will have no need of the Sun but it didn't say anything about the rest of the Earth the city is the only place that will have the privilege to live for eternity in the light of the king you know why cuz they were the ones that walked in the light on the earth if you walk in the light now you get to live in the light for eternity there was no need of the Sun for there is no night there do you ever notice John never mentioned nothing about there not being no night on the earth out there where the rest of the people lived but where you live there'll be no night we are so privileged on top of Mount Zion will set the lamb and the city will need no light for the lamb is the light thereof and above the lamb will be the father which is the logos God that great light Eternal Light that'll shine just above the throne and Jesus will not be on the father's throne but it'll be on his throne and the father will hover over the son which the father and son will be one and while they're yet speaking I'll answer and before they can think I'm thinking for them that's right and Jesus will commit a perfect perfect age to a perfect Living God that he has redeemed and give over to the father let me close with this God became material in a man called Jesus which was his son this son gave his life that he might bring other sons that God might become tangible working all in all in that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father in me I and you what a day and we will Crown our husband the angels won't crown him they're not married to him but it will be you shulamite that will Crown your Solomon and you will be able to reverberate the words in eternity that he anointed Solomon to WR so many years ago I am my beloved and my Bel beloveds is mine I am my beloveds and my beloved is mine let's bow our is together oh Lord Jesus we sense your presence here Among Us father it's the the light of the word of the hour that helps us to see our journey it's the light of the word of the hour that shines on why we should dress different act different talk different the reason that the people of the church church anity and organizations and so on don't see it is it because the light they're living under doesn't show it but our light does our light tells us why we should live a certain way and behave a certain way so then when we move from this world we will be privileged to live in that city where the lamb is the light Lord God then we want you to be the light of our church we want you to be the light of Our Lives the light of our marriages the light of our homes oh Jesus come shine upon us with all your Brilliance Our Father overshadow Us in this life as you will overshadow your human body in the Eighth Day overshadow Shadow our Humanity that our Humanity might be glorified Lord Jesus by what you have done help each young person here tonight father encourage them strengthen them give them what they need Lord for this life's journey thank you for this time we were able to spend together tonight Lord your presence has been so wonderful we thank you Lord for speaking to us I pray that we're blessed together oh Jesus how we long to be together I know it may sound strange to us but when the change comes if I'm 70 or 68 or 69 or whatever I will be I'll be changed to a young man 18 to 20 some of them sitting here tonight may be 16 or 17 and they'll just be changed up a year or two some of them maybe 25 and they'll go backwards a few years but we'll all be the same age and we'll stay that age for eternity will never grow old Lord Jesus we thank you for these promises in your word we love you father how many of you here tonight I just raise your hand say Lord I want to be there so bad I want to be there with all my heart help me Lord would you just raise your hand to him maybe you got a KNE in your life maybe going through a challenge a trial maybe you're a little bit indifferent right now you've lost a little bit of your joy a little bit of your desire you want to be remembered you don't want to miss it oh young person what in this world could this world ever offer you compared just to what a little bit that we've looked at right here tonight the devil has no heaven for you he has no eternal life he has no body that he can offer you which will be free from pain if you miss Heaven you will go to a a realm in the outer darkness when the prophet went went there as a boy 14 years old he said that A Burning Flame would have been a pleasure compared to what he saw he was just falling falling falling in an endless eternity he said there was no mama there there was no Daddy there just falling falling and he couldn't stop hearing the moaning and the voices Oh My but on the other hand the Lord Jesus has a new body endless Joy endless peace happiness Beyond week and even imagine tonight is waiting for us bear his reproach on this life and he promises you he will say these words to you well done thou good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord which were prepared for you from before the foundation of the world Lord Jesus I pray you'd be mindful of each of them that raise their hands tonight father would you minister to them Lord I know from hearing from other people around the world that these questions aren't just being listening to to by youth but they're being listened to by ministers and by people from all over the world so I pray tonight Lord God that you'd reach out to each one may they WR there sitting in their living room sense the spirit of God just the way we do in this Sanctuary tonight father we s you here and we're so grateful you're here Lord to heal you're here to fill with the Holy Ghost you're here to encourage I believe Lord God your same presence can go

God Hallelujah Lord God I praise your living savior found a quote before I came to church I shared it with brother Donnie and brother rob you know you always wonder about the question and answers and you know I always like to look at what the prophet said about [Music] it so he was getting ready to do question answers in 53 talking about people turning in questions he said we we want to find out the reason we do this is to find out what's on people's mind what they're thinking about that that's what makes a good strong Church [Music] you know what I I was thinking is he was talking there when when you've turned in a you write it down you give it to me brother BR on a piece of paper your question or you send it a WhatsApp or a text and say can you ask brother Donnie this for me you're not just wanting to find out something intellect ual you're asking for more of him what does the word say the Bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God so you're wanting to know more about God it's just not it's not just intellectual if we leave it up here somebody can explain it to you somebody can explain it away from you but when it gets here when it becomes revelation your questions you know I can imagine that one day you might not even know what prompts you to turn the question in but one day you might be on the other side and you see somebody fighting through a crowd pushing to get to you on that other side and they're going to tell you somebody from Australia or somebody from Norway might say well you were 14 years old at Word of Life Church you wrote a question and one Thursday night your pastor answered that question that's when I felt the pull because you wrote a question there's people all over the world listening to the questions that you're asking so I I hope we don't we don't take this lightly I hope that we understand when you write a question in Lord tell me more about yourself that I don't understand yet tell me more reveal yourself more to me I I don't want it to stay intellectual you might think something as simple as do I have the Holy Ghost there's no telling how many people when you get on the other side because you wrote that question down receive the Holy Ghost as simple as it is why because it's more of him it's his word you've inquired of his word so you've inquired of him and he imparted himself to you tonight that's why I like I like the little sermons I don't I don't like just a straight answer tell me how I do this take me through the word take me through God I love it I'm I'm so thankful for for you all the the questions that you've written have helped me it helped me so much few things that I I I thought I told brother Donnie I've realized how little I know when you see these questions that come out from teenagers and and young adults you you think Lord I was missing in that spot too so I'm I'm so thankful for that I'm thankful for you and I'm so thankful for brother Donnie there's nobody will ever say brother Donnie gives less to the youth than he does the on Sunday he gives gives everything he has and I'm so thankful that he cares enough about our youth group to give everything he has and I pray that you continue to to pray for him and lift him up so we're going to worship a little bit if if you want to stay a while um but we're so thankful for y'all thank you God bless Mighty you are great and do Mar [Music] things Mighty You Are Holy you are your mercy endure it forever more righteous you are great you are I will exalt you oh Lord my God my king Lord
