[21:41] to do the verse because it was if we
[21:44] just sing it the way we send the course
[21:46] of the verse would have been screaming
[21:48] and if we tried to sing it the way we
[21:51] normally would have seen it would have
[21:52] been slow you couldn't hurt us so we
[21:54] asked her to do the verse she's not here

[21:57] course let's do the course of shine

[24:20] praise the Lord Amen god bless you what
[24:25] you give brother Brandon a nice hand as
[24:26] he comes to sing tonight you can be
[24:28] seated god bless you
[24:44] we're gonna try I don't I don't normally
[24:55] like to talk it's not my job to talk
[24:59] just sing I feel like this song needs a
[25:02] little bit of just a tiny bit of
[25:04] background in the Old Testament how many
[25:08] was heard of Miss Phoebus chef I can't
[25:10] even pronounce his name and that's what
[25:12] this song is about him being carried to
[25:14] the table and you know the to me the
[25:17] song means that we can't see our
[25:20] brokenness when we're at God's table and
[25:22] to me that's sitting under the word and
[25:25] somehow I feel normal
[25:28] when I'm under the word and I feel like
[25:30] I'm not broken and I know that's the
[25:32] inner part this flesh is broken and
[25:35] we're flawed but I thank God for his
[25:37] table that we pull out two every week I
[25:40] think God for it so y'all pray for me
[25:43] try to get through this one
[25:45] [Music]
[25:58] [Applause]
[26:03] wounded and forsaken I was shattered by
[26:07] the fall broken and forgotten feeling
[26:13] lost and
[26:15] summoned by the king into the Masters
[26:20] courts lifted by the Saviour and
[26:25] cradling his own scary to the table
[26:35] seated where I don't belong
[26:41] carry to the table swept away by his
[26:50] [Music]
[26:56] and I don't see my brokenness anymore
[27:01] when I've seated at the table
[27:08] [Music]
[27:13] the table
[27:18] fighting thoughts of fear wondering why
[27:22] he called my name am I good enough to
[27:27] share this cup this world is left me
[27:29] lying
[27:31] but even in our weakness Jesus calls our
[27:36] name
[27:38] his whole presence we are healed and on
[27:42] a shame
[27:44] [Music]
[27:46] maybe to do the table
[27:51] seated where we
[27:54] [Music]

[30:11] [Applause]
[30:20] capable of the Lord tonight I'll tell
[30:24] you we ain't good this weekend didn't we
[30:26] hey man so appreciate it brother Matt
[30:29] appreciate you fine young men that
[30:31] commit themself to the Lord and take the
[30:35] gift that God's giving them
[30:36] let's turn if you would to night to the
[30:38] book of Acts chapter 20 begin reading
[30:42] verse 28 take heed therefore unto
[30:52] yourselves and to all the flock over
[30:57] which the Holy Ghost has made you
[30:59] overseers to feed the Church of God
[31:02] which he has purchased with his own
[31:07] blood for I know this which must have
[31:12] been a sad thing to know some things you
[31:16] know were good things to know some
[31:19] things you know aren't painful some
[31:22] things you know were heartbreaking for I
[31:26] know this that after my departing shall
[31:29] Grievous wolves enter in among you not
[31:34] sparing the flock also of your own
[31:38] selves shall men arise speaking perverse
[31:43] things to draw away disciples after them
[31:52] who is it Kingdom builders now they'll
[31:56] come in the name of Jesus they'll come
[31:58] speaking about the cross but really the
[32:01] theme of what they're wanting is you me
[32:06] to follow them they are the focal points
[32:11] that's why everything comes right back
[32:13] to them it's how great they are how
[32:15] gifted they are
[32:17] annointed they are they're the only ones
[32:20] going and the closer you become to part
[32:22] of that inner circle everybody else is
[32:24] all the way out
[32:26] this is prophecy it was said 2,000 years
[32:30] ago it's still coming to pass this very
[32:32] day hey man let's bow our heads together
[32:35] Lord Jesus how we thank you for your
[32:38] word tonight father we're so grateful
[32:39] that we believe tonight dear God that we
[32:43] are part of your church we realize Lord
[32:46] being a part of that it's it's as if
[32:49] though a target is on our back or the
[32:52] word preacher or a lay member or
[32:54] whatever we are Satan hates us because
[32:58] of your love toward us we're grateful
[33:01] Lord Jesus that we are part of this
[33:03] great Church of the Living God we ask
[33:06] you to take a word tonight Lord and just
[33:08] speak to us help us father that we can
[33:10] be benefitted by your word and we know
[33:13] that we shall be if we open our hearts
[33:15] tonight Lord you see this prayer cost
[33:18] that I have in my hand that I want to
[33:19] wear tonight as a speak Lord this
[33:23] situation your father for brother Dave
[33:25] Swanson you know all about it Lord and
[33:28] his family and passing of sister Lydia's
[33:31] father which is pray for your mercy your
[33:33] grace that should help the family during
[33:35] this loss during this time Lord speak to
[33:39] us tonight your word in Jesus name and
[33:41] the Saint said god bless you may be
[33:44] seated
[33:48] Paul says for I know this some things we
[33:54] know by knowledge some things in oba
[33:55] pattern we know about the way that they
[34:00] repeat himself down through time no
[34:03] doubt this was so illuminating to this
[34:06] prophet by the Spirit of God that he
[34:08] knew it the young pattern he knew it
[34:11] beyond type he knew it beyond historical
[34:15] value but he knew it by revelation he
[34:19] knew that by his prayer
[34:22] being there and I hope you can take this
[34:25] right then the presence of of a strong
[34:29] anointed gifted servant of God that
[34:32] within itself has a great ability of
[34:35] keeping much evil away from a flock by
[34:39] Paul's presence being among the people
[34:42] he knew that much was held at bay it did
[34:46] not stop at all but much was kept bad
[34:49] because he was such a strong gifted
[34:52] anointed person he knew when that
[34:55] presence was no longer there that these
[34:59] men who had been waiting who had been
[35:02] watching for the opportunity that they
[35:05] would arise and he said for I know this
[35:08] that after my departing shall Grievous
[35:12] wolves enter in among you not sparing
[35:16] the flock now his ability by the Spirit
[35:19] of God no doubt a very strong leader
[35:21] because you didn't play with Paul
[35:23] because if you done something he would
[35:26] rebuke you it didn't make a difference
[35:27] if your name was Peter or whoever you
[35:30] was it made no difference to this man is
[35:33] their eye so that would then itself will
[35:36] kind of hold people back a little bit
[35:38] and he knew that and he knew whenever
[35:41] his presence was gone that some of them
[35:44] were waiting for that very opportunity
[35:46] now whether he would actually ever come
[35:50] back this way again at a historically he
[35:53] never come back in this direction again
[35:55] from Meletis and on down through the
[35:57] vicinity where he had been and some of
[36:00] them was waiting for the very time that
[36:03] he would not return some of them no
[36:05] doubt waiting when he would leave the
[36:07] earth and whatever he did this was their
[36:09] opportunity Timothy was a strong man but
[36:13] not quite as strong as Paul was and I
[36:16] realized some folks resent a strong man
[36:19] they won a weak man they want a man
[36:22] which tries to butter up everything and
[36:24] you know make everything gentle and
[36:25] brother branham talked about himself and
[36:28] he talked about brother Neville and he
[36:30] talked about the church order and the
[36:32] tabernacle
[36:32] some of the things which needed to be
[36:34] said and he said it brother Neville was
[36:37] a gentle person an easy person easy type
[36:40] of gone and he said sometimes too gentle
[36:44] but he said it just so happens that I
[36:47] can say it now most people don't like a
[36:51] man like that they would much rather
[36:54] have a man that's easy gentle one they
[36:58] can push so they'll turn a man like that
[37:05] hard harsh mean militant yeah well this
[37:13] is the kind of man that Paul was Timothy
[37:16] historically wasn't like that even in
[37:20] the scripture he wasn't that way because
[37:22] really he didn't need to be but yet Paul
[37:26] because of this Jesus was the type of
[37:29] individual that he could look at people
[37:31] with such compassion and such love and
[37:35] you look at others and call them dogs oh
[37:39] my goodness and I've scared y'all to
[37:42] death now you're afraid to breathe go
[37:43] ahead and match your eyes your eyeballs
[37:45] will fall out if you don't so go ahead
[37:47] and bat your eyes now Paul could be this
[37:49] way I dare say there was not a more
[37:52] loving man in the New Testament and Paul
[37:56] was other than the Lord Jesus because of
[37:59] what he done but people misunderstand
[38:02] law they think that love is always
[38:05] letting people get what they want and
[38:07] letting them get by with whatever more
[38:10] that's not love at all that's a pushover
[38:12] but yet not only do the sheep read that
[38:16] but also the wolves read it as well now
[38:20] Paul identified these and he called them
[38:24] Grievous wolves and the Greek word here
[38:26] is heavy strong mighty or dangerous
[38:31] wolves but it's also a compound word
[38:33] which means fat wolves now these wolves
[38:38] were going to become
[38:40] fact on the blood and the fleece of the
[38:46] sheep so they're gonna be fat wolves not
[38:52] from eating other wolves not from eating
[38:55] bears but from eating sheep so they will
[39:00] fatten themselves on the blood of the
[39:04] Sheep now the sheath themselves don't
[39:07] have the ability to resist this type of
[39:10] a force they don't have the ability to
[39:14] fight you know a dog can buy a horse can
[39:18] kick a cow can butt and kick as well
[39:21] a donkey all kinds of animals have all
[39:24] type of self-protection mode but a sheep
[39:27] has none so if you see folks in our
[39:32] shirts that know how to fight they know
[39:34] how to gossip they know how to talk they
[39:36] know how to run down you know right
[39:38] they're gonna eat dinner with a sheep at
[39:40] all you're dealing with a goat that's
[39:44] right folks that know how to defend
[39:46] themselves you know right there they're
[39:47] not truly surrendered sheep to God
[39:50] well I should have had brother Matt to
[39:55] preach the nice my notice this they the
[39:59] sheep themselves need strong leadership
[40:04] now you'll find out one of these days if
[40:06] you don't know it already that the thing
[40:09] that some of you despise in strong
[40:12] leaders has been some of the very things
[40:15] that has kept your soul from Hale it has
[40:19] kept our church from many things that
[40:23] other churches deal with because of a
[40:26] strong leader and if you could have
[40:29] changed me and changed other men that
[40:32] we've had no doubts some of the very
[40:34] things you would have changed you'll
[40:36] find out in time has been the very
[40:39] things that God has used to keep us from
[40:42] a lot of trash so if you would have
[40:45] manipulated me or manipulated the men
[40:48] that have come in here or the associate
[40:50] men the
[40:51] here you'll find out that some of the
[40:53] things that we you would have desired to
[40:55] change was the very things that have
[40:58] kept you and your family from going
[41:00] through a lot of things that other folks
[41:03] have went through and if God would have
[41:05] granted you what you thought was your
[41:07] best you would have been cutting your
[41:09] head off
[41:11] that's right now Paul recognized of
[41:15] course that these wolves would be the
[41:17] enemy of the fog and we know that the
[41:20] Lord established this new saying what's
[41:23] he called the church and was so beloved
[41:26] eeeh and because he loved it so much
[41:29] that made it an absolute enemy for Satan
[41:34] himself anything that God loves Satan
[41:38] hates anything that God calls by the
[41:42] tail term of endearment as beloved now a
[41:47] person can be loved of God but it isn't
[41:51] the same as being beloved of God we know
[41:54] that the Lord had 12 disciples and he
[41:58] had other preachers that went along with
[42:00] him but we know that out of those 12
[42:03] that he had three that were very special
[42:07] praise the Lord now I add 12 us were
[42:10] called apostles but he had three which
[42:12] were very special to him no doubt those
[42:16] three carried a great load because you
[42:19] know how people are they're always
[42:20] jealous if they think somebody has some
[42:22] loco sort of Jesus and they aren't or
[42:25] little closer to the pastor
[42:26] so Jesus had Peter James and John he
[42:29] never took Bartholomew and ever took
[42:31] Matthew he never took a lot these other
[42:34] guys up to experience the great
[42:36] experiences with him Peter James and
[42:39] John three out of the twelve and then
[42:41] John was even more beloved it appears
[42:45] than the other two were now do you think
[42:48] Jesus had that kind of relationship well
[42:51] if you know your Bible you know that he
[42:53] did well it all sewn comes that was the
[42:56] most types of relationship many people
[42:59] envy that from people because they see
[43:02] special something that God gives certain
[43:05] ones whether it's a preacher or a singer
[43:07] a musician a song leader and they have a
[43:09] special touch others will envy that they
[43:13] almost despise that and they want that
[43:16] so much but if they only knew the
[43:19] consequences that come was being in that
[43:23] position now Paul was that type of a man
[43:26] he was called by God yet special
[43:29] revelatory position that God gave him
[43:31] special understanding about mercy grace
[43:34] the law of the types of shadows the
[43:36] Gentiles that none of the rest of the
[43:38] brothers had none of them absolutely
[43:40] none of them in the New Testament walked
[43:43] in the sphere that Paul did but yet the
[43:45] man went through more than many of the
[43:48] other apostles put together because with
[43:51] that comes a great tremendous price then
[43:54] on the other hand Satan and his demons
[43:57] also they measure these men of God the
[44:00] same way now you've heard me said on
[44:02] many many times and I'll probably
[44:04] continue to say so I not only want to
[44:06] have a testimony among you and among my
[44:08] contemporaries and my brothers that I
[44:10] minister with in the message but I want
[44:12] my testimony to reign beyond these four
[44:14] walls
[44:15] I want it to ring beyond just my friends
[44:18] by the 10 brother my price for the wrong
[44:20] Spencer
[44:20] or you know all these brothers I want it
[44:22] to go beyond that I wanted also to ring
[44:25] down inhale now I know that Satan does
[44:28] not like any of us if we're sons and
[44:30] daughters of God is that true but you
[44:32] can also watch the opposition that men
[44:35] of God give a preacher I don't care how
[44:38] great people think he is if the devil
[44:41] don't give him much flack that tells me
[44:43] a lot about the man if that man is
[44:46] really called of God and chosen of God
[44:49] and really accomplishing as much as he
[44:52] lets on that he is you better believe
[44:55] he'll hates that man it's the same with
[44:58] any Christian whether it's a man woman
[45:00] boy or girl they might Myles and say
[45:03] there this and there that in the other
[45:05] you know talk is cheap but if Satan
[45:08] pretty much does not bother them and
[45:10] most of their trials
[45:12] self-inflicted if I was you I'd watch
[45:14] that person because more than likely
[45:16] there are a whole lot of hot air and not
[45:18] a whole lot else that goes with it and
[45:20] it's the same way in every ministry that
[45:23] God calls you don't just look at how
[45:25] many people's following the manga don't
[45:27] look at well they've got so many
[45:29] contacts from this side all that really
[45:31] doesn't have any relevance when it comes
[45:33] to how demons fear the individual but
[45:35] you watch the church who watched the man
[45:37] you watch the people that absolutely
[45:39] Satan hates them and that will give you
[45:42] a pretty good idea of how their
[45:44] testimony reflects down in the pits of
[45:47] darkness which lead to me has a great
[45:49] relevance and how God looks at that
[45:51] individual now no doubt was Paul Peter
[45:54] was hated James was hated all the rest
[45:57] the Apostles were hated but can you
[45:59] imagine how this man was hated this man
[46:01] had such an insight on predestination
[46:04] Peter couldn't even touch it
[46:06] James couldn't even touch Paul's
[46:09] understanding of the election and the
[46:12] predestination of God he wrote about
[46:15] election and predestination in the
[46:17] mystery of the bride and the mystery of
[46:19] God he wrote things that even Simon
[46:22] Peter himself said our beloved brother
[46:24] Paul writes Saints it's hard to be
[46:26] understood you imagine Peter sitting
[46:29] down reading Timothy and reading Titus
[46:32] and reading Philemon and Philippians and
[46:34] first and second Corinthians and
[46:35] Ephesians tehsil and I couldn't know
[46:37] through the Thessalonians rather and
[46:39] Timothy and all that and Peter just
[46:41] shaken he something and where did he get
[46:43] this understanding my goodness what
[46:46] great revelation this brother had praise
[46:49] the Lord so you know then also in hell
[46:52] this whenever they knew that this man
[46:55] was under the Roman why they was
[46:57] watching him to bring him to Rome they
[46:59] let him go for a season they reached him
[47:02] again you imagine that the demons down
[47:04] in hell were waiting for the day when
[47:07] this man's life could be taken from it
[47:10] no no no they was thinking in a
[47:12] multiplied form that if this man stops
[47:15] the revelation oh stop if he stops the
[47:18] clear understanding will stop if he
[47:20] stops it will give us more leeway into
[47:22] the flock because
[47:24] looking at it in a total different way
[47:26] than the sheep are looking at the
[47:28] cheaper thing oh my poles gone we'll
[47:31] have no more letters than and we'll get
[47:33] no more of his great understanding which
[47:35] is true but yeah the demons were looking
[47:37] at it in a total total different
[47:39] perspective because this gift was so
[47:42] strong it was so powerful oma and
[47:45] whenever they would do things others you
[47:48] know others said come against others
[47:50] they wouldn't say a whole lot they
[47:52] wouldn't do a whole lot whole even the
[47:54] beloved John got so pressed that even
[47:56] calls somebody's name on time and John
[47:58] had went into a bathhouse now remember
[48:00] John was the disciple of Lord so on and
[48:05] the societal of that don't cause
[48:07] people's name in public does so yeah
[48:09] John did he called a man's name in the
[48:12] name of dr. fees John went into a public
[48:15] bathhouse and he found out there's a
[48:17] false teacher in there and he said may
[48:19] God give us mercy to bring the others
[48:21] bathhouse for it falls down on us the
[48:23] disciple of love you see friends folks
[48:26] don't understand love they find love
[48:29] it's a little tea detail oh the little
[48:32] Ginny can agree love can be a kitty cat
[48:38] but love can also be a full-grown black
[48:42] mane lion
[48:44] [Applause]
[48:48] [Music]
[48:49] but people want a passer that's a beauty
[49:01] communicator Camellia patches
[49:10] [Applause]
[49:11] now when Paul was riding where Luke was
[49:15] riding actually what Paul was saying he
[49:17] wanted to identify what's going to come
[49:21] against the church now if God has got
[49:24] pastors Satan's going to have them if
[49:29] God's got your apostles Satan's going to
[49:32] happen everything that God has Satan's
[49:35] gonna have some that'll mimic what God
[49:38] has so God's got a true pastor Satan
[49:41] Ohio false pastors now they won't stand
[49:43] up and draw pentagrams on the wall take
[49:46] a golden slice of goats neck and say oh
[49:49] we're doing this in the name of the Lord
[49:51] Jesus no no that wouldn't scare anybody
[49:53] well it would scare people but that
[49:55] would never deceive anybody end up
[49:57] believing this man is leading them
[49:59] deeper into the riches of Christ so what
[50:03] do you send up do we believe in the
[50:04] cross we believe in mercy we believe in
[50:07] salvation we believe in Christ Christ
[50:10] Christ Christ well folks so scared to
[50:13] death the name of the Lord Jesus never
[50:17] knows how many denominations were
[50:18] preachers it's always Christ Christ
[50:20] Christ Christ what's wrong with the name
[50:22] Jesus the angel said thou shalt call his
[50:26] name Jesus and he shall save his people
[50:29] from their sins
[50:32] now if Satan is going to mimic what God
[50:36] has God has two teachers Satan has false
[50:39] teachers God has true prophets God has
[50:43] Satan had goddess true ones God has true
[50:46] ones Satanists fossils but he'll try to
[50:49] do this he'll try to convince you
[50:52] Satan's false ones are the true ones and
[50:55] God's true ones other fossils and both
[51:02] of them are pointer fingers the other
[51:03] and say that house where the truant
[51:10] and they'll both use the quote to say
[51:12] don't gonna bring the press against us
[51:16] they're bringing the press against us
[51:18] and they're saying no no the ones ready
[51:20] to give something you're saying who's
[51:22] who what's not so much it's done that
[51:28] way on purpose to confuse you now don't
[51:34] misunderstand it the true leaders know
[51:36] they are true leaders the false leaders
[51:39] know they are false so the whole scheme
[51:43] is not to convince to true that they're
[51:45] true or to convince the false that
[51:48] they're false the whole scheme is to try
[51:51] to confuse you of who's true and false
[51:55] [Applause]
[51:57] that's where you got to have the Holy
[51:59] Ghost
[52:00] having the message on your phone is not
[52:03] your seal bless God I'll tell you one
[52:06] thing I'll go in and I'll type in the
[52:08] message that's well and good and I did
[52:09] nearly every day of my life but you can
[52:12] still be deceived by having the message
[52:14] half on your fault you're not see or by
[52:17] having the message that you're not see
[52:19] or by listen to tapes
[52:21] you're not sealed by coming to church
[52:22] you're sealed by the Holy Ghost
[52:25] oh my notice this
[52:30] Jesus in Matthew chapter 7 verse 15 he
[52:34] himself sets this force of course before
[52:36] even mentions about the founding of the
[52:39] church beware of false prophets which
[52:42] come to you in sheep's clothing but
[52:49] inwardly they are ravening wolves
[52:54] beware of notice now what they are
[52:58] they're not witches they're not wizards
[53:01] they're false prophets so what will they
[53:05] be doing they will be acting like to
[53:08] prophesy that's what a prophet does
[53:15] well praise the Lord
[53:17] [Applause]
[53:18] Amy and they'll come to you in sheep's
[53:23] clothing but inwardly so you can look at
[53:26] them on the outside and they'll look the
[53:28] part and talked apart but inwardly
[53:31] they're a wolf on the inside you shall
[53:36] know them by their ah two men gather
[53:42] grapes of thorns or figs of thistles so
[53:48] you won't know him by their shout you
[53:50] won't know much just ability to quote
[53:52] the word or the message but what's the
[53:55] fruit of their life and the Prophet also
[53:58] tells us the fruit is their teaching so
[54:02] what do they teach is the Sun the
[54:06] summation of all their teaching is that
[54:09] how great they are
[54:10] how gifted they are how wonderful they
[54:13] are and how do you need them so
[54:16] desperately or is it about you and
[54:19] Christ and the church and the millennium
[54:22] and what he's trying to do or does it
[54:24] always come back to them one of the
[54:28] first signs of a false prophet and the
[54:31] second one is if you don't hear him who
[54:33] try to scare you to death now I'll tell
[54:35] you one thing so-and-so wouldn't listen
[54:36] to me and a tree fell on so-and-so I'll
[54:39] tell you one thing they didn't listen
[54:41] the man their car run off the road
[54:43] so-and-so I'll tell your friends should
[54:45] not believe how many times I've been
[54:46] approached for such stuff people trying
[54:50] to scare me you forgot I was in
[54:52] Pentecost for many years I was in
[54:55] Pentecost and would see men call people
[54:57] out I had a man to call me out one day
[54:59] and tell me what I prayed that day word
[55:04] for word and a woman come up in the
[55:10] unbuttoned her blouse and stuck his hand
[55:12] in on her breast
[55:19] don't come to me with your isms and your
[55:22] feelings your Quivers and your shakes
[55:25] [Applause]
[55:28] raise the Lord well well no the second
[55:36] Peter chapter 2 verse 1 but there were
[55:40] false prophets which were among the
[55:43] people talking about the children of
[55:44] Israel even as there shall be false
[55:46] teachers among you who privily shall
[55:51] bring in damnable heresies even denying
[55:58] the Lord that bought them and bringing
[56:01] upon themselves Swift destruction and
[56:07] many this is the sad horn and many shall
[56:11] follow their pernicious ways why because
[56:18] she can be easily deceived well I didn't
[56:23] get many amens on that and many shall
[56:28] follow their pernicious ways by reason
[56:32] of whom the way of truth shall be evil
[56:35] spoken of so these guys will actually
[56:38] come in and they will deny the Lord God
[56:42] that bought them Jesus and they will
[56:45] begin to speak evil of the way of truth
[56:48] and sometimes genuine sincere people
[56:51] will follow them and they'll actually
[56:55] leave a true pastor a true prophets
[56:58] message and follow a false prophet
[57:03] praise the Lord
[57:05] is this the truth absolutely notice Paul
[57:10] again acts 20:29 for I know this that
[57:14] after my departing shall Grievous wolves
[57:16] enter in among you not sparing the flock
[57:19] I notice it's not that the false
[57:21] prophets are just gathering goats
[57:24] they're actually affecting sheep
[57:31] there's not a person sitting in this
[57:33] place than that no matter how
[57:34] predestinate you're and how elected you
[57:36] are that has not been deceived one time
[57:39] another in your life some of you made it
[57:44] be deceived about something tonight
[57:45] about something that you believe or
[57:47] somebody you've got such confidence in
[57:48] or whatever more but it doesn't if
[57:51] you've got to hold a ghost you won't
[57:53] stay deceived he will straighten me out
[57:56] that's right now so these type of people
[58:00] they're not interested in the unity of
[58:03] the flock they're not interested in the
[58:06] unison of the body they are interested
[58:09] in fleecing the flock and said have
[58:13] actually take care of the flock so they
[58:16] are Pharisees under the pretense Jesus
[58:21] rebuked him sharply when he was here and
[58:23] rebuked him for you know taking
[58:26] advantage of the widows and of the poor
[58:28] and he said you stand there you
[58:30] Pharisees and you will not go in the
[58:32] gate yourself and you won't let others
[58:34] go in and yet you're saying you're
[58:37] really sincere love God notice this in
[58:40] verse 30 now Paul is going to categorize
[58:41] these groups also of your own selves
[58:45] shall men arise speaking perverse things
[58:48] to draw away disciples after them now
[58:54] there's always be a two-fold type of
[58:55] saying to crises of the coming enemy and
[58:59] one of them is what men of your own self
[59:03] so this will be men of your own ranks
[59:05] men of your own message can we say of
[59:08] the same move the same mother the same
[59:12] doctrine theoretically they'll start out
[59:14] with the same doctor but the problem is
[59:16] to have two different fathers
[59:19] you see it's coming back to the thing as
[59:22] it was in the Garden of Eden it's Eve
[59:24] again I said it's Eve again Eve had the
[59:29] potential I've given birth to Cain
[59:32] Abel but Adam could only father Abel Eve
[59:37] could give verse to both praise the Lord
[59:40] the prophet messenger did not bring to
[59:43] us a message from God which was mixed up
[59:46] with denominational a carrion he brought
[59:49] to us the word but as the church we had
[59:53] the potential as the female of giving
[59:56] birth to most Cain and Abel it's your
[59:59] choice oh ma praise the Lord
[1:00:04] now these are very difficult times we
[1:00:09] know that but we also know that we're
[1:00:11] not the only ones to deal with such
[1:00:13] things these type of people are actually
[1:00:16] bred in the very community of the church
[1:00:20] itself so they will be men that will
[1:00:25] come among you and they may sit there
[1:00:28] for years they may set under the
[1:00:30] auspices of the message of the hour and
[1:00:32] then all of a sudden of sight their
[1:00:34] software kicks in and they start
[1:00:36] displaying their agenda now may I say
[1:00:41] this tonight my little brother Darrel
[1:00:43] brother the West but the Terry all the
[1:00:44] recipes minister brothers here but as
[1:00:46] much as I love brother Darrell if I ever
[1:00:48] saw brother Darrell raised up in this
[1:00:50] church and try to start a split in this
[1:00:52] church I'll call his name out I'll
[1:00:55] rebuke him and he knows me well enough
[1:00:59] to know I will brother horn I'm warning
[1:01:02] you buddy by the last some warning
[1:01:04] letter gene
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:10] oh you scared for your position no I'm
[1:01:15] watching over a flock
[1:01:23] a flock this is my heart ah my
[1:01:31] position and you think this is the only
[1:01:33] place I converge I've got more
[1:01:36] invitations in the last 10 years and
[1:01:38] I've had in decades in my life if I
[1:01:40] accept that every invitation I'd you'd
[1:01:42] never see me for six months
[1:01:45] but I don't what I want I'm going to
[1:01:48] don't worry this is my heart right here
[1:01:52] this is my burden which should be with
[1:01:55] every true God commented Sebastian so in
[1:01:59] that this is where Paul takes this
[1:02:02] disincentive and he says that there will
[1:02:04] be some that will come up from your own
[1:02:07] community and they will make a prey of
[1:02:11] the flaw they will actually make
[1:02:14] themselves fat on the on the necessities
[1:02:18] of setting around there but the whole
[1:02:21] thing is to promote themselves to
[1:02:24] sources of apostasy that will try to
[1:02:28] invade you one from within and one from
[1:02:32] without and they will be diverse why
[1:02:35] because the sheep are diverse some sheep
[1:02:39] would never follow you know we could
[1:02:42] call men's names or certain doctrines or
[1:02:44] whatever more but they would never
[1:02:45] follow a certain certain move or
[1:02:47] orchestrated or began by a certain man
[1:02:50] it just would have no appeals to them
[1:02:51] but other things will come around that
[1:02:54] do you know if they're very quiet and
[1:02:56] way back and they're not very you know
[1:02:58] Pentecostal this would say more than
[1:03:00] likely a real Pentecostal God that would
[1:03:02] come in around the message and try to
[1:03:04] pull people off to follow him no simcha
[1:03:06] people will never listen to him because
[1:03:08] that's of the way their nature but if
[1:03:10] their nature more scholarly and lore you
[1:03:13] know they really like deep so-called
[1:03:14] stuff Noah that'll be the thing then
[1:03:17] Satan will have won exactly for the
[1:03:19] palate of their taste and that's a whole
[1:03:21] mob never heard such preaching in my
[1:03:23] life no Lorelai this this is
[1:03:26] unbelievable
[1:03:26] this is the only man and the message you
[1:03:28] know right there when they say that you
[1:03:30] better get away from it
[1:03:32] this is not a one-man message in the
[1:03:35] sense of one pastor and one evangelist I
[1:03:39] agree
[1:03:40] one man brought this message one prophet
[1:03:44] of God brought this message but it is no
[1:03:46] longer one man one pastor one grade of
[1:03:50] engine Asst that the bride is flopping
[1:03:52] around it is a ministry that God has
[1:03:55] around the world OMA right that's why I
[1:04:06] rebuke you they try to do that to me
[1:04:08] don't do that
[1:04:11] whether you come to church or whether
[1:04:14] you stream the service don't get that
[1:04:15] devil on you to think our church and I'm
[1:04:18] this and that we're nothing only by the
[1:04:22] grace of God are we even saved tonight
[1:04:25] him feel where the Holy Ghost and can
[1:04:27] see life don't never make nothing out of
[1:04:29] me or no other man Jesus is the great
[1:04:33] one among us all the rest of us are
[1:04:36] servants
[1:04:41] what's this in 2nd Corinthians chapter
[1:04:43] 11 verse 13 Paul says for such are false
[1:04:48] apostles deceitful workers you see these
[1:04:54] guys are not all preachers but they're
[1:04:58] workers that get among the people like
[1:05:01] maggots on a gut wagon and they work oh
[1:05:10] boy they work well if God's got good
[1:05:19] workers Satan's got deceitful workers
[1:05:22] he ain't just impersonating preachers
[1:05:24] you've got good workers and her church
[1:05:27] that are good and you've got some that
[1:05:28] stick their nose and everybody else's
[1:05:30] business we don't believe in Deaconess
[1:05:34] this year at the church but we've got
[1:05:36] something even though they're not
[1:05:37] ordained well thank you Jesus come out
[1:05:46] or - hold on some of them invitations I
[1:05:48] might be needing them uh Hector tonight
[1:05:50] for such are false apostles deceitful
[1:05:54] workers friends you think this is not
[1:05:57] powerful transforming themselves into
[1:06:16] transforming themselves by the way you
[1:06:19] mean they have a power and ability to
[1:06:25] change themselves to transform
[1:06:29] themselves when they're evil too rotten
[1:06:33] their kingdom builders but they had the
[1:06:36] ability to transform themselves as if
[1:06:39] though they are so sincere so genuine
[1:06:49] who said scares away well that's the
[1:06:51] negative side to transforming power but
[1:06:53] the good part is if they've got the
[1:06:55] power to transform themselves into that
[1:06:57] you ain't gonna tell me you ain't got
[1:06:59] the power to transform yourself into
[1:07:01] it's a love God that can live an
[1:07:03] overcoming victorious life if they can
[1:07:07] do that for their friend for false
[1:07:08] pretense for error then cannot lead by
[1:07:11] the divine impartation of eternal life
[1:07:13] let God transform us into creatures that
[1:07:17] reflect his glory
[1:07:18] [Applause]
[1:07:22] notice in verse 14 the high parallels
[1:07:25] these guys and no Marvel for Satan
[1:07:29] himself is transformed into an angel of
[1:07:38] darkness really Wow now Satan really
[1:07:51] wanted to deceive you he would never
[1:07:55] appear to you the way he did to me when
[1:07:57] I was a young Pentecostal preacher
[1:07:59] laying upstairs and that brothers at
[1:08:03] room at builders from upstairs where I
[1:08:05] was sleeping by myself after I preached
[1:08:08] war out drove several days preached come
[1:08:13] heroin with me the Intel was at home for
[1:08:16] whatever reason I'm so tired that night
[1:08:19] I just exhausted but in the early way
[1:08:23] hours of the morning brother Wesley I
[1:08:27] felt something shaped my bed and it was
[1:08:32] enough to where it woke me up so I just
[1:08:35] kind of turned around and as I stood as
[1:08:37] I laid there rather I've seen this
[1:08:40] creature about 6 foot tall draped in
[1:08:44] black standing at the foot of my bed and
[1:08:47] he took his body and bumped against that
[1:08:50] bed and the headboard hit the wall well
[1:08:54] when I saw that I didn't have time to
[1:08:58] pick up the phone and dial nine-one-one
[1:08:59] I called somebody close to the 9-1-1
[1:09:04] I got up in their bed I started coming
[1:09:08] up keeping my eyes right on him but the
[1:09:10] lane again he'd come right against the
[1:09:11] bed and the headboard hit the wall and
[1:09:14] he spoke to me out of there and said
[1:09:16] I've come took his finger like this long
[1:09:18] finger with his thumb stretched out just
[1:09:20] like this I've come to take your life
[1:09:24] low gravely terrifying voice
[1:09:29] I've come to take your life so I took my
[1:09:34] hands and push myself up in the bed a
[1:09:36] little bit higher on now I'm almost
[1:09:37] looking at him straight on and now he
[1:09:40] comes and he bumps right against the bed
[1:09:42] and he's pushing the bed against the
[1:09:44] wall like that and he said it again I've
[1:09:46] come to take your life well I wasn't in
[1:09:52] the message then don't don't be mad
[1:09:55] don't misunderstand me but I met Jesus
[1:09:57] for a header row Brenham I met Jesus
[1:10:04] forever listen to it take that's a lot
[1:10:08] of folks problem they come to the
[1:10:09] message to that ever meeting Jesus first
[1:10:12] all my goodness
[1:10:14] we witness to him and bring him from the
[1:10:16] Baptist Church of the Methodist Church
[1:10:18] of the Church of Christ and we simply
[1:10:20] change their doctor and we never produce
[1:10:21] a word verse and abemolik I for I knew
[1:10:26] enough about the word to know that is
[1:10:28] the son of God I had authority over
[1:10:30] devils and I ain't lost that knowledge
[1:10:34] so I raised up in the bed I thought big
[1:10:37] boy if you're gonna point your finger to
[1:10:38] me I'm gonna point mine back at you so
[1:10:42] I'm pointing my finger back at him and I
[1:10:44] said I rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[1:10:47] he stood right there and just to taunt
[1:10:52] me at the bed again I said did you hear
[1:10:57] me I rebuke you in the name of Jesus go
[1:11:02] back to Hell where you come from God
[1:11:07] being my witness I'll answer for it the
[1:11:09] day of judgment I saw this being as a
[1:11:12] head come back into this into this cape
[1:11:16] that it was dressed in and he backed up
[1:11:18] not taking his eyes off he took his hand
[1:11:20] down like this shaking glory to God and
[1:11:25] he backed off and he backed into the
[1:11:27] darkness there tell me how that happened
[1:11:29] the darkness I have no idea cuz there's
[1:11:31] a window right behind him the darkness
[1:11:33] was so black where he was but you know
[1:11:36] what he wasn't comin trying to deceive
[1:11:38] me that's really who he is
[1:11:40] but if he was coming trying to deceive
[1:11:43] me with the doctrine or a theory he had
[1:11:45] never appeared like this he'd never come
[1:11:47] that way because I'd say I rebuke you in
[1:11:50] the name of Jesus so what will he do
[1:11:52] he'll come dressed up like an angel or
[1:11:55] dressed up with this quote on in this
[1:11:57] scripture that's cut up and hacked up
[1:11:59] come on children he'll never come to you
[1:12:02] like that for trying to deceive you but
[1:12:04] when he comes to deceive you he puts on
[1:12:17] those wings on his back and you fly
[1:12:21] around for you and say yay as God said
[1:12:29] [Applause]
[1:12:34] well praise the Lord Satan himself is
[1:12:39] transformed into an angel of light
[1:12:42] therefore it is no great thing if Satan
[1:12:53] has preachers their acts even called his
[1:13:02] aren't you glad you ain't one of the
[1:13:05] whom truth if it is better he wouldn't
[1:13:12] any more than us
[1:13:14] hey Widmore aren't you glad aren't you
[1:13:17] guys aren't you go ahead he wouldn't
[1:13:19] want you the way you are say yeah devil
[1:13:21] come on answer I don't want you the way
[1:13:22] you are ain't nobody you tie up hell you
[1:13:25] wouldn't be down you're two hours you'd
[1:13:26] be preaching Hellfire and brimstone
[1:13:28] you'd be preaching infection hide oh
[1:13:29] won't you that's right he don't want us
[1:13:32] and we don't want him so what's he
[1:13:34] trying to do torment us and aggravators
[1:13:36] and everything in the world can do I'm
[1:13:38] glad Satan hates me because the feelings
[1:13:42] are totally mutual
[1:13:43] [Applause]
[1:13:51] therefore it is no great thing if his
[1:13:57] ministers also be transformed as the
[1:14:03] ministers of righteousness praise God
[1:14:08] for the message praise God for Malachi 4
[1:14:12] oh thank God for sending us a prophet
[1:14:15] but of course we all know that prophet
[1:14:18] you know he only preached part
[1:14:20] Revelation and you know when he had his
[1:14:23] dream hit only went two-thirds of the
[1:14:25] way and brother Ram could only lead us
[1:14:27] two-thirds of the way and the other
[1:14:29] third has a row you need to be on
[1:14:35] Dollywood or Hollywood or someone like
[1:14:37] that we got no room for you come out
[1:14:40] Church what they do so there are always
[1:14:43] laying it out brother Branham was a good
[1:14:45] man why he had so many wonderful things
[1:14:46] to say but AHA goat so they transform
[1:14:55] themselves so they say the prophets and
[1:15:01] to us with it he believed the message
[1:15:04] new it's a shame how gullible we are
[1:15:15] well praise the Lord
[1:15:18] galatians chapter 2 verse 3 but neither
[1:15:20] titus who was with me being a greek was
[1:15:23] compelled to be circumcised and that
[1:15:27] because of false brethren so i got false
[1:15:31] pastures false preachers false apostles
[1:15:33] false teachers false workers and i got
[1:15:37] false brothers how you doing brother hey
[1:15:39] i don't brother i doing such that so
[1:15:43] won't just try to come in from the
[1:15:44] ministry level it'll come from every
[1:15:47] level in the body false brethren
[1:15:51] unawares unawares brought in my question
[1:15:56] about this verse is wonder who brought
[1:15:58] them
[1:16:01] sometimes good sincere people are trying
[1:16:04] to add to our church try to add to the
[1:16:06] flock of God and if you're not later the
[1:16:08] Holy Ghost you will be bringing in a
[1:16:11] false yeah a false brother that'll set
[1:16:15] in among us and because of your zeal not
[1:16:18] no knowledge but you'll see oh you are
[1:16:21] inviting pale mamas well hallelujah my
[1:16:30] Bible tells me the Lord had it dated to
[1:16:32] the church such as should be saved no
[1:16:35] friends this is not I'm Way or Avon
[1:16:38] we're not going around not well why
[1:16:40] don't you out get out you do a community
[1:16:42] outreach we are the community outreach
[1:16:44] well why don't you set up a booth i Gert
[1:16:47] the grey Fairgrounds a face on my face
[1:16:49] that throw me under the fairgrounds
[1:16:53] we're not selling pumpkins
[1:16:56] we're not giving away watermelons this
[1:16:59] is the gospel
[1:17:00] oh man that because the false brethren
[1:17:09] unawares brought in who came in privily
[1:17:12] to spy out our Liberty which we have in
[1:17:16] Christ Jesus that they might bring us
[1:17:20] into bondage
[1:17:22] so they come in as spies so if somebody
[1:17:27] come in here tonight and they wanted to
[1:17:29] be a spy among us and this dress like
[1:17:31] Bozo the Clown now would you think they
[1:17:35] were very inconspicuous what if they
[1:17:38] come in looking like on the head on a
[1:17:40] Carter County Jail outfit what color
[1:17:42] they aren't orange or something like
[1:17:44] that and they had on a change you know
[1:17:46] chains on their legs and chains on their
[1:17:48] arms and I mean this has hi for the
[1:17:50] church that said over here we're brother
[1:17:51] Wayne is this high for the church at
[1:17:53] empty out they said lord have mercy a
[1:17:54] convicts got out somebody called the
[1:17:57] police call it but that's not very keen
[1:17:58] speakers but what if somebody come in
[1:18:00] and they dress like everybody else they
[1:18:02] look like everybody else on this had a
[1:18:04] man ever now
[1:18:05] and they want a book and they want a
[1:18:06] table as a whole we've got to convert
[1:18:08] happily or I'll be babying a serpent
[1:18:16] brother don't you say we shouldn't speak
[1:18:18] to people I'm saying you should speak to
[1:18:20] those the Holy Ghost leads you to and
[1:18:22] not your own zeal oh my good to whom we
[1:18:31] gave place by subjection no not for an
[1:18:41] hour that the truth of the gospel might
[1:18:47] continue with you you believe Paul had
[1:18:50] love recipes what do you think he had
[1:18:57] but of these who seemed to be somewhat
[1:19:01] whatsoever they were it make us no
[1:19:04] matter to me whew rough sort of a guy
[1:19:10] wasn't he God accepteth no man's person
[1:19:15] does happy Valley Church believe them no
[1:19:18] matter what your last name is first name
[1:19:20] is middle name is Bo they who seemed to
[1:19:24] be somewhat in conference added nothing
[1:19:28] to me Philippians chapter 3 verse 2 this
[1:19:37] is this love as it oozes out of this
[1:19:39] man's heart beware of dogs these ain't
[1:19:46] poodles Rottweilers and pit bulls look
[1:19:51] at the word dog on a man of impure
[1:19:57] mind an impudent man you mean to tell me
[1:20:03] a man whose heart was full of love
[1:20:06] referred to people people
[1:20:11] ass dog huh now what's cool if you go to
[1:20:21] now they should have never taught him in
[1:20:25] that Theological Cemetery I mean the
[1:20:28] seminary he must have missed that day
[1:20:32] that's what it was he had to flume he
[1:20:36] was out that whole week on pulpit
[1:20:39] manners on how to rebuke people in such
[1:20:44] a way that they don't even know you're
[1:20:46] doing it that your Sojin to you and
[1:20:49] you're so loving that you're just like a
[1:20:52] honey in the honeycomb it just oozes out
[1:20:55] of you and when people are done they
[1:20:58] can't even hardly get to the car they're
[1:21:00] covered in gooey honey and molasses and
[1:21:04] they stick to the steering wheel and
[1:21:06] they gotta be pried out of the front
[1:21:08] seat when they go to the car because
[1:21:10] your pastor is just so chocolaty and
[1:21:12] butterscotchy and marshmallowy that
[1:21:17] sounds yucky
[1:21:24] beware of dogs beware of evil workers
[1:21:29] beware of the concision now you know to
[1:21:34] us a dog that doesn't mean at all what
[1:21:37] it did to these folks the dog was a
[1:21:39] reproachful term designating arrogant
[1:21:43] and dangerous men so if a man raises up
[1:21:54] in this church or raises up in the
[1:21:55] message and I would refer to him as a
[1:21:58] dog would I be considered to be a word
[1:22:02] preacher by most people who say they
[1:22:07] believe this word and believe the Bible
[1:22:09] and believe the message no I would why
[1:22:12] because people are ignorant our senses
[1:22:16] are becoming Laodicea Thais tolerance
[1:22:20] tolerance tolerance tolerant you think
[1:22:24] it's not affecting you but it is it's
[1:22:26] affecting you every day we hear it
[1:22:29] tolerance tolerance and I get sick of
[1:22:31] hearing it because I want to tolerate
[1:22:34] everybody about us they want to tolerate
[1:22:37] everybody for do anything they want to
[1:22:40] do but they have no tolerance for choice
[1:22:44] [Applause]
[1:22:53] so you see unlike today where people
[1:22:56] would have all kinds of dogs if you have
[1:22:58] dogs I'm not against it if you have dogs
[1:23:00] in your house I'm not against it but you
[1:23:03] have to take this mindset of what this
[1:23:05] was written in the way they thought
[1:23:06] about it and this day dogs mainly
[1:23:10] wandered the streets they were not in
[1:23:13] people's homes they wandered the streets
[1:23:17] without a master
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:22] so when Paul compared people to those he
[1:23:26] said you can't come subject you don't
[1:23:29] have a master you're here and you're
[1:23:31] there and you're somewhere else and
[1:23:33] you're ravenous and you rip and tear and
[1:23:35] you can't be subject you do understand
[1:23:45] what dogs hate you understand Purina
[1:23:47] what's not terrible and Paul wrote this
[1:23:49] there was no job shall you do understand
[1:23:54] what they ate you don't corpses they
[1:24:02] hung around crucified bodies and this
[1:24:07] being a rocky place when they would dig
[1:24:08] them in the in the graves many of them
[1:24:10] couldn't afford a great tumor of the
[1:24:12] frame so they dig very shallow graves
[1:24:15] and the dogs would follow the funeral
[1:24:17] procession and they would dig up Uncle
[1:24:21] Joe and eat Uncle Joe so Paul said you
[1:24:28] men you can't be controlled you can't be
[1:24:31] taught you can't be brought subject and
[1:24:33] you're feeding on a dead carcass you
[1:24:38] know send friends when you're feeding on
[1:24:39] yourself your pride your vanity how
[1:24:43] wonderful how great oh my you're the
[1:24:45] greatest singer in the message you're
[1:24:46] the greatest songwriter in the message
[1:24:48] you're the greatest preacher oh that
[1:24:50] ain't nobody the message can play the
[1:24:51] organ like you're the guitar like you or
[1:24:53] whatever more you understand what you're
[1:24:54] doing you are feeding on your dead
[1:24:57] corpse
[1:24:58] [Applause]
[1:25:10] malignant dissatisfied beware of dogs
[1:25:18] beware of evil workers teachers who
[1:25:22] endeavor to pervert the gospel and of
[1:25:26] the concision and you know preachers can
[1:25:29] be sarcastic they can be extremists when
[1:25:33] they preach this is what Paul is
[1:25:36] actually doing here the word concision
[1:25:38] is katha Tomi which is to cut up or to
[1:25:42] mutilate so he's using a sarcastic term
[1:25:46] to refer to the Jews which are
[1:25:50] emphasizing circumcision circumcision
[1:25:55] was an act given by God a holy righteous
[1:26:00] thing for thousands of years but now God
[1:26:04] had moved beyond it as a sign of the
[1:26:06] seal in your flesh and Paul refers to as
[1:26:10] somebody cutting themselves and just
[1:26:12] move mutilating themselves come on now
[1:26:15] why because when God moved out of it
[1:26:18] that's what it becomes Lord of Mercy
[1:26:20] children can't you see with the move of
[1:26:23] John Smith and the Lord moved in the
[1:26:25] Baptist Church it was a great move of
[1:26:26] God and when they made an organization
[1:26:29] God moved right Oliver God moved out of
[1:26:32] the Methodist Church them for the
[1:26:33] message people that refused to go on
[1:26:35] with a move of God
[1:26:36] God will move right out of their message
[1:26:39] churches their message people and move
[1:26:41] right over the bride will be no more
[1:26:45] than any other denomination or name
[1:26:48] [Applause]
[1:26:52] oh my goodness
[1:26:55] Oh Lord Jesus let me give you the
[1:27:00] meaning of this word that Peter refers
[1:27:02] to here again second Peter chapter 2
[1:27:06] verse 2 to skip verse 1 but they and
[1:27:08] many shall follow their pernicious ways
[1:27:11] pernicious is damnable other destruction
[1:27:15] of perishing ruin in verse 3 says
[1:27:20] through covetousness shall they with
[1:27:22] feigned words molded formed as from clay
[1:27:30] wax or stone so they take their words
[1:27:36] and they move and they cut them and they
[1:27:40] shaped them and they put their words
[1:27:43] together to try to make you believe
[1:27:46] Allah so you'll be damned now notice
[1:27:54] what they will do then with their
[1:27:55] feigned words they will make merchandise
[1:27:58] of you whose judgment now the longtime
[1:28:03] linguist not and their damnation
[1:28:06] I wonder if folks would allow this
[1:28:09] Prichard here Peter what if he'd be
[1:28:11] allowed to come preach these big fine
[1:28:13] faint sea churches around here what if
[1:28:17] that lamb come up to the First Baptist I
[1:28:18] reckon he could go downtown Kingsport
[1:28:20] and all them big nice churches down in
[1:28:22] Church circle they can Peter be invited
[1:28:27] one of the suckers resume I walked with
[1:28:30] the Lord Jesus I've walked on water only
[1:28:32] man in history that's ever done I failed
[1:28:34] but it didn't walk on for a while I was
[1:28:36] with him when he raised up I've done
[1:28:38] this and that in the other son I
[1:28:39] couldn't water resume of a guy who is
[1:28:41] this guy Peter oh lord have mercy
[1:28:43] your motto to read first things first
[1:28:44] and second Peter for you said you wanted
[1:28:46] his pulpit cuz whenever he went down he
[1:28:47] believed that if you raise the wrecks
[1:28:49] you'll believe the same thing so Peter
[1:28:51] come in you're denied you saying I'm
[1:28:53] preaching hard I'm like a Cub Scout
[1:28:55] compared to what these guys will do
[1:28:57] you're
[1:28:58] you know Paul walked out walk down to
[1:29:00] Walmart in Elizabeth and tomorrow and
[1:29:02] went to Johnson City and then went to
[1:29:03] the Johnson City Mall tomorrow night
[1:29:05] lord have mercy not have him in jail by
[1:29:07] the weekend goddess chapter 1 verse 9
[1:29:17] holding fast the faithful word as he has
[1:29:20] been taught that he may be able by sound
[1:29:21] doctrine both to exhort and to convince
[1:29:23] the gainsayers for there are many unruly
[1:29:27] and vain talkers and deceivers specially
[1:29:31] they of the circumcision whose mouths
[1:29:35] must be stopped who subvert whole houses
[1:29:40] teaching things which they ought not for
[1:29:42] filthy lucre sake one of themselves even
[1:29:46] a prophet of their own said the cretians
[1:29:48] are always laurs
[1:29:50] evil beasts slow bellies whoa this
[1:29:58] witness is true
[1:30:01] wherefore oh we've got to lay it aside
[1:30:08] there's these words
[1:30:09] wherefore can you condemn anybody
[1:30:20] well I can't condemn me anyone Who am I
[1:30:24] to say
[1:30:25] if a man wants to marry
[1:30:31] you perfect claimed the name of God
[1:30:38] [Applause]
[1:30:44] rebuke them sharply that they may be
[1:30:48] sound in face revelation 2 - I know thy
[1:30:52] works and thy labour in thy patience and
[1:30:54] how thou canst not bear them which are
[1:30:56] evil and thou has tried them which say
[1:31:00] they are apostles and are not and has
[1:31:03] found their lives
[1:31:09] whoa geez in church age I know that they
[1:31:14] are there no this is now these apostles
[1:31:16] or rather who called themselves prophets
[1:31:18] and apostles and found that their lives
[1:31:20] oh that's pretty flat isn't it
[1:31:22] I'm not responsible for that he is he
[1:31:25] said they were liars but the Bible said
[1:31:27] try man and if there be a man among your
[1:31:33] spiritual or prophet or says here's how
[1:31:35] the Lord will make myself known to him
[1:31:38] I'll speak to him in visions and in
[1:31:41] dreams and if what he says comes to pass
[1:31:46] then then and then only this is what
[1:31:59] William Marion Branham said I don't care
[1:32:03] what somebody else said who has the same
[1:32:04] wife's name
[1:32:13] or if his last name is McGillicuddy or
[1:32:16] Bryant or a Reagan or nut makes no
[1:32:18] difference I said to me it makes no
[1:32:22] difference if they're not saying what
[1:32:23] the word said they're liars beasts iron
[1:32:29] Ellison if what he says comes to pass
[1:32:34] then hear it don't be afraid of him
[1:32:38] because I'm with him oh but here's the
[1:32:43] catch phrase but if it doesn't come to
[1:32:45] pass then don't hear he hasn't got my
[1:32:55] word then once he got alive from the
[1:32:59] devil see if it's his word
[1:33:05] it happens now they found out these
[1:33:07] fellers wasn't carrying on according to
[1:33:09] the Bible see that we're trying to get
[1:33:11] something else now let's try him that
[1:33:14] say they are apostles in or not and has
[1:33:16] found them life
[1:33:17] now that is a blunt statement thou has
[1:33:20] tried them who called themselves Oh
[1:33:21] apostle isn't that presumptuous what
[1:33:26] right has a people to try those who call
[1:33:29] themselves apostle how do they try them
[1:33:33] oh I love this here it is in Galatians 1
[1:33:37] at 8 but though we or an angel from
[1:33:39] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[1:33:42] than that which we have already preached
[1:33:44] unto you let him be our curse it was the
[1:33:49] apostles who brought the original word
[1:33:51] to the people the original word could
[1:33:53] not change
[1:33:55] not even a dot or a dash now it's being
[1:34:03] said from headquarters if there's two
[1:34:05] types of fivefold ministries today there
[1:34:08] is a false fivefold ministry and there's
[1:34:10] a true faithful ministry and the true
[1:34:12] faithful ministry will play tapes
[1:34:16] I say that is damnable doctrine from
[1:34:21] Hale the Bible never taught that brother
[1:34:26] branham never taught that come on church

[1:40:47] them back fine but many of you they feel
[1:40:49] like you're gonna bring them back oh I
[1:40:50] know I can do it I know I can do it it's
[1:40:52] a trap of the devil for you if you
[1:40:55] believe mr. Shepherd it's a trap of the
[1:40:57] devil for you do you see all these
[1:40:58] ministers going out here and doing all
[1:41:00] that you know why a lot of it it's a
[1:41:02] waste of time these people want to argue
[1:41:05] with you they want to debate with you
[1:41:07] then what to pull you into something or
[1:41:08] so a little bit of a doubt in your mind
[1:41:13] so you go over to this website well what
[1:41:15] about this and what about that and what
[1:41:16] about that you can't prove this and you
[1:41:18] came through then said I don't know why
[1:41:21] so all this stuff in your mind why not
[1:41:23] spend time studying the original
[1:41:34] you'll never find me a quote or a
[1:41:37] scripture or the Holy Ghost feeds on
[1:41:39] false doctrine the Holy Ghost feeds on
[1:41:43] the word praise God
[1:41:47] don't you love them at all your heart
[1:41:50] may God keep us may God protect us we've
[1:41:57] had things come and go since I've been
[1:41:58] here as you pass through and brother
[1:42:00] Phillips to share as your pastor years
[1:42:02] ago and whoever mole wherever you've
[1:42:03] come from you know we're never going to
[1:42:06] be exempt from church troubles never you
[1:42:11] got too many targets here every
[1:42:14] individual from this pulpit back to the
[1:42:17] nurseries every individual here is a
[1:42:20] potential instrument to cause trouble in
[1:42:24] this church why would Satan not want to
[1:42:27] come in here you've got hundreds and
[1:42:31] hundreds and hundreds of people there
[1:42:35] can be a potential instrument just sow
[1:42:38] discord let two young people in the
[1:42:41] church getting a spat don't think it's
[1:42:44] just about that boy and his friend
[1:42:46] Satan's got a bigger target in the
[1:42:49] matter mind he wants to get their moms
[1:42:51] and dads involved and then the
[1:42:54] grandparents involved and then their
[1:42:55] closest friends involved and then and
[1:42:59] ultimately you know where he wants to go
[1:43:01] to right here
[1:43:09] but the horn told me the other day that
[1:43:11] vertigo they say can be caused by stress
[1:43:14] told me that in the office and I said I
[1:43:16] don't know why I would be straight that
[1:43:21] deer in the headlight look you know me a
[1:43:26] stress-free life my friends what he
[1:43:38] hates truce and he hates promoters after
[1:43:43] the jesus said it well on this robbery i
[1:43:48] will build my church and the gates of
[1:43:52] Hell will not prevail against it
[1:43:58] aren't you glad you're part of that go
[1:44:02] ahead and hit in the head he's worth it
[1:44:08] this our heads together god bless you
[1:44:15] lord I imagine it Peter and Paul James
[1:44:21] even Luke as they wrote basically the
[1:44:25] three main writers of the New Testament
[1:44:28] it must have been so sad for them to
[1:44:30] have to take up space and the Holy Writ
[1:44:36] to write of discord and trouble and
[1:44:39] false prophets and false apostles and
[1:44:43] false workers but yet they felt it was
[1:44:47] needful they couldn't just write about
[1:44:51] the good things that was going on in the
[1:44:53] church they also needed to write about
[1:44:57] the difficulty and the hardships of the
[1:44:59] trouble it's the same in our message
[1:45:03] Lord it would be nice we could just
[1:45:06] stand up and just constantly deal with
[1:45:09] this mystery in that mystery and go from
[1:45:11] one great great thing into another but
[1:45:13] in reality services aren't two-niner
[1:45:17] just a simple
[1:45:20] sometimes even more so that we Heavenly
[1:45:25] Father can be alarmed and Paul I'm not
[1:45:28] sure if the counter D but and this one
[1:45:31] verse he said the word
[1:45:32] beware three times in that short voice
[1:45:36] verse beware beware beware I don't think
[1:45:43] that was just for that day but I believe
[1:45:46] it's for this day as well
[1:45:48] help us Lord Jesus may our hearts always
[1:45:52] be so sensitive to the Holy Ghost each
[1:45:56] of us just find our place and be what
[1:45:59] you've made us to be and be happy I know
[1:46:03] it'll be one of the greatest
[1:46:04] achievements of the elect down through
[1:46:06] the ages is to be satisfied with the
[1:46:09] predestinated allotment that you've
[1:46:12] given to us in reality that's what led
[1:46:15] Eve to her fall the serpent to his fall
[1:46:18] Satan to his fall
[1:46:20] on and on and on and on talking people
[1:46:24] out of their position offering them a
[1:46:27] higher one than their called to do and
[1:46:30] then they fall Lord if we could only
[1:46:34] find what you've made us and be happy
[1:46:37] for Aaron help us Lord Jesus help us not
[1:46:43] to be satisfied for less than what
[1:46:45] you've made us or constantly reaching
[1:46:48] for more but to find exactly what you've
[1:46:51] made us and I love the way the Prophet
[1:46:53] deals with it whenever they ask him in
[1:46:54] question answers how can a person find
[1:46:58] the will of God and find what they're
[1:47:00] supposed to be doing and he answers it
[1:47:03] in such simplistic terms generally a
[1:47:06] person's position is known something
[1:47:08] like this he says about whether they can
[1:47:11] do it or not so if a person claims are
[1:47:15] called to preach and they can't preach
[1:47:17] after 30 years they ought to accept the
[1:47:21] fact a person who claims are called to
[1:47:24] do whatever be a sunday-school teacher
[1:47:27] be a deacon be whatever they're thinking
[1:47:29] they're called to be if you did not gift
[1:47:32] them
[1:47:32] with the ability to do it then
[1:47:35] apparently they've misunderstood
[1:47:37] something even people who get involved
[1:47:41] in the church workers in the church that
[1:47:43] try to straighten out this and
[1:47:44] straighten out that and wind up making a
[1:47:46] bigger mess and what the mess was before
[1:47:49] Lord made they begin to look up about
[1:47:52] and realize maybe I'm not called to do
[1:47:55] this what a great revelation it'll be
[1:48:00] for all of us when we can find that spot
[1:48:02] and we're just happy we're just happy
[1:48:06] being what you've made us a lot of the
[1:48:09] jealousy will subside the anxiety the
[1:48:13] pressure that we feel of trying to sing
[1:48:15] like this one or preach like that one or
[1:48:16] jump like that one or shout like that
[1:48:18] one would just be what you've made us to
[1:48:21] be and go on lord help us out pray
[1:48:25] father Lord may you speak to every heart
[1:48:28] here tonight and those it has trained
[1:48:29] this service may our ears be open to the
[1:48:34] Holy Ghost and Lord when we go to hear a
[1:48:40] sheep looking wolf though it may smell
[1:48:47] like a sheep though initially it may be
[1:48:51] like a sheep but when that inside of the
[1:48:55] inside goes to speaking the main motive
[1:48:58] and objective may the Holy Ghost within
[1:49:00] us recognize the voice of a wolf well
[1:49:06] that's a preacher or a lay member or a
[1:49:08] gossiper or whoever it is wolves ain't
[1:49:11] just preachers sometimes it can be a
[1:49:14] woman that seems so humble and ain't
[1:49:17] nothing but a busybody just meddling and
[1:49:21] meddling into one thing into another her
[1:49:24] name's attached to fifty seven things
[1:49:26] going on the church at the same time
[1:49:28] help us lord help us to realize we are
[1:49:32] not rapture ready when we are doing such
[1:49:35] things and we are not rapture ready when
[1:49:38] we are listening to such things
[1:49:40] it proves we're not being led of the
[1:49:43] Holy Ghost
[1:49:45] help us Lord God we love you Jesus with
[1:49:50] all of our hearts I thank you for this
