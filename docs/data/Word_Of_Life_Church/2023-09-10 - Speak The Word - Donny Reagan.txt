about brother Tim Burdette and his church is going to come over and be with us on September the 23rd and the 24th which will be Saturday night and Sunday morning we're looking forward to that great time of Fellowship together and just see what the Lord will do for us also wanted to share with you brother Wade Altman maybe many of you knew that he'd gotten sick this week and had to take him to the hospital and according to the doctors once it got there he made it in the nick of time because his Widowmaker was trying to make a widow out of his wife sister Hannah so they were able to do a couple of stands and she text me earlier this morning and she was on her way to the hospital to pick him up and bring him home so we're grateful for the mercy of the Lord to our brother we appreciate everything doctors can do for us we're thankful for that so I know they would appreciate your prayers and calls and whatever more to just to let them know that we love him and and we appreciate him let's turn today if you would to the Book of Mark chapter 11 verse 23. we've been looking at the bride's rights for several services and I'm not sure I'll ever get done with it but we'll enjoy dealing with as long as we have time but I'd like to speak on one this morning that's very very powerful wonderful yet so simple and yet we wonder how in the world should we be given this right Mark 11 23. for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith what scripture him early we'll read it again I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever you saith therefore I say unto you that whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them Mark 7 25. for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean Spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet the woman was a Greek a sorrow Phoenician by Nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter but Jesus said unto her that the children first be filled for it is not meat to take the children's bread to cast it to dogs I wonder how many of us would have been left standing to ask the other part of this and Jesus said that to us would have got so offended we would have been so mad we'd have walked out of there would have said that guy's a learn a false prophet why he ain't the love of God he was the very epitome of love but Jesus knows who he can try he's going to use this woman as an example she's been preached on for thousands of years we don't even know her name now notice but Jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not me to take the children's bread and cast it unto the dogs she answered and said unto him yes Lord yes Lord yep the dogs under listen notices under the table eat of the children's crumbs I imagine the Lord Jesus was as we would say Blown Away now there were a few people in the New Testament that astonished him which is quite impressive when you can astonish God and he said unto her for this logos for this logos saying English but the Greek is logos for this logos go thy way the devil is gone out of thy daughter wow can you imagine just that woman saying the right thing for this saying go thy way the devil is gone out of thy daughter and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out that's Jubilee time ain't it when you find the devil's done been made to leave but it was not notice Jesus didn't say because of my saying but because of your saying she found the devil gone out and her daughter laid up on the bed and we'd love to be remembered today as we pray it's if you would Heavenly Father we have an awesome portion of your word laying before us today this was one of the things that stumped your prophet because he said you didn't say if I say but if you see so we know there must be an understanding to this I dare say that every Christian that's been saved in here very long at all have tried to speak the word and many of them would say the same thing I would have to say well it didn't work or I said it wrong or something but yet we know you cannot speak anything that is not true so there must be an understanding to this word I pray you'd help us today speak to every heart Lord God those that can't be here because of sickness or whatever more they're streaming May the presence of God go in their living room their bedroom and their office wherever they are father we believe this will be a notable day for us as the children of God you saw every hand that was uplifted minister to the needs of your people we pray today in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated so what does speak the word actually mean that's what I want to speak to you about speak the word probably every Christian here today in your daily walk before the Lord you speak the word you quote scripture you talk about the things of God and if you don't you should but is that the same thing that Jesus was referring to that just by quoting the written word the logos that you would have whatsoever you said I guess for me I could understand it understood it a lot easier and better had Jesus said if you will just say what I say and then you won't doubt what I say then you can have what I say but that wasn't the way he said it it said if you'll take my word and you'll say to this mountain and you don't doubt what you've said not what I've said if you won't doubt what you have said then you can actually have what you said so every child of God apparently has a right and an ability to be inspired by God himself and to not just repeat scripture and repeat quotes and we should do that we should fill our spirit our minds our memory with the word of God so that whenever we're in a battle that we can quote that to the devil but that's not the same thing as this here this is something that it takes divine inspiration to be able to strike our hearts and make it work now this something that's going to happen every day of Our Lives no it ain't would it happen because we have the ability to do it we don't have the ability it'll be when father chooses to use your mouth to say his word so what might must I do then brother Donnie until the Lord chooses for that time or what you must do is you say his word every day of your life you got a need to confess his word he's my deliverer he's my healer is everything that I need and you're saying his word but then there come a time when you will need it most that he will take your mouth and he will speak his word then it's no longer you it's no longer you saying it but it's the father saying it now there are examples of course in the Old Testament and the new and we'll look at a few of them As We Lay this Foundation a little bit and Exodus chapter 14 verse 13 and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward now I want you to notice there's a combination in these verses and how they tie together in order to make this successful so Moses tells the children that God is going to smack the Egyptians they've they've dealt with them for years and years they've been under their bondage and their slavery now he says the gypsums that you see now you'll never see them again because the Lord is going to fight for you but apparently Moses is still tore up you know the Moses of course writes this book of Exodus and he doesn't tell us what actually transpired between verse 14 and verse 15 but it would lead you to believe that Moses either one than his Spirit or he turns away from whether people can hear him and Moses is still really in this dilemma and he don't know what to say and he's asking God because notice the response of God and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me but neither one of these verses actually notes that he cried to the Lord so it must have been a cry that was not either it was not either audible or it was something that he turned away from then and then God responds back and said Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward now remember the Red Sea is before them Pharaoh's Army behind them they've got a mountain range to the right and mountain range to the left and they're in a tiny opening there just big enough for them to fit in it and here they are they're facing this big dilemma now I want you to notice the way God addressed this because God doesn't tell him to speak to the water God doesn't tell him to speak to the mountains God doesn't tell him to speak to the Egyptians but God tells him speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward now women how in the world are we going to get the water to roll back well they're speaking and then there's action that's coupled together with word talking now speak unto the children of Israel that they may go forward but notice the reaction to this voice of God but lift up thou thy rod now remember that I thought he's supposed to talk I thought he's supposed to speak lift up thou thou Rod out then stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel Quran dry ground through the midst of the sea so here Moses is told to speak to the children of Israel how many believes that actions speak louder than words sometimes now what's amazing is as far as Moses standing goes all right children glory to God the Lord told me to tell you all something I'm going to stand up here today and I'm going to preach to you a message about we're going to open the Red Sea we don't have any example where Moses acts even stood there and said one thing that yet God told him to speak speak and then God tells him an action to couple with his speaking now you know we can quote the word to word blue in the face but there are certain actions of faith that we've got to take and if we don't take them your Mountain Will Never Move in other words there's things that you and I must put forth and we have to operate sometimes on the spur of the moment of that pulsation of faith when God drops it now this is what's happened of course to this setting when they are at the Red Sea and you know the end of the story there that the spirit of God moved upon the Water where the speaking was at we don't know what did he say we don't know but all we know is God said quit crying unto me okay I'm sick of it I want you to quit acting like a cry baby Moses I commission you to deliver this people talk to him and tell them let's go forward and then Moses instead of standing up and preaching Moses puts his words into action and then God tells him to lift up his rod and Moses obeys what God Said and he believes it's the truth Joshua chapter 10 verse 12. we have another man total different of course calling than Moses he wasn't even deemed by many to be in the office of Moses yep we see that God called him to stand in Moses place and take the children of God all into the land of promise now this man's got a different Administration altogether God's going to use him in a way that he's never used another human being since that time then Joshua spake to the Lord in that day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel I want you to notice how peculiar that the words of God are sometimes then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel but he's speaking to God Joshua said unto the Lord capital L capital O capital r capital D then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel son but he said this to the Lord is this what your Bible says I'm sorry you had never read this before and then speak Joshua to the Lord and this is what he says son stand still thou upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of agilon and the sun Stood Still and the moon stayed until the people at events themselves upon their enemies is this not written in the book of jasher so the sun Stood Still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like it before or after it listen now that the Lord not the son not the Moon that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man so Joshua speaks to the Lord and he says son still and moon don't you move and it obeyed his voice and then the Bible said there'd never been a day like it before another day after it since that the Lord not the son not the Moon the Lord hearkened to The Voice of a man not in Joshua ever do this again never as anyone down through time ever done this again not that we know but isn't it peculiar that it would say he spoke to the Lord but he's addressing the son now maybe that's what you need to do with the situation you're in today that you need to speak to the Lord but address your disease and address your sickness or your oppression or the enemy that is taking your victory and reminding your father that you are a son and daughter and you're sick and tired of the devil beating you to death amen and stealing from you what is your right and somebody said [Applause] notice again in Matthew chapter 8 verse 5 and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lies at home to sick with a palsy grievously tormented Jesus says unto him I will come and heal him the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority now there's something this Gentile Centurion sees that the Jews at this time did not see the Jews were taught laying on of hands and yes we believe in laying on of hands in case any of you get nervous we believe in laying on of hands but the Gentile way of receiving was recognizing power and authority now watch this speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me so now watch this man he wants Jesus to know I understand who you are I know that you have power over all sickness and disease and I recognize that because I can see myself now being a centurion he is over a hundred men but he also has men that are over him so they could tell him you go there you go this you go do this and he would say yes sir I will but he also could speak to those hundred men which were under him and he could tell them we are going to such and such and we're leaving at 12 o'clock and we'll be there so many days and we're going to do this so he recognized Jesus position in this amazing I wonder if Peter and some of the Apostles even wreck the way this man did I say to this man go when he goes and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he does it when Jesus heard it he marveled wow can you imagine a gentile a Roman calls the Lord Jesus to Marvel wouldn't that be awesome for somebody in this building today to be able to cause the Lord Jesus to Marvel and say that's my son that's my daughter listen Angels listen at them how they're taking my word and they're standing in their position and they realize Satan is not all powerful Satan cannot manipulate them and do this with them and that with them they realize I am the one who brought them on the earth they realize I am the one that controls their life not Satan now notice this then the Bible said when Jesus heard it he marveled and he said to them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so great face no not in Israel Lord Jesus you name the whole nation so this Roman which was not even saved as we would say so Marvel the Lord Jesus and Jesus sort of come back now Pharisees Sadducees the scenes herodians all them sent in our glory to God I'll tell you one thing my daddy was so and so my grandpa was so and so and Jesus said I found such faith in all of Israel like this the Lord Jesus identifies this Faith as great faith I hope and pray to God that some of us will be able to be identified by the Lord Jesus of having great faith how many wants it verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel now this actually astonishes the Lord Jesus now I'm going to talk about you know some hit like me or some hillbilly like you all we're talking about the Lord God in flesh but this statement so astounded the Lord Jesus that it actually astonished him and he marveled was it marveling of the source where did this man get this how did he know how did he understand this how could this man being a gentile surpass the faith of those that knew the law they knew the Torah they knew the mishnah they knew all the things that the prophet said and they could quote it upside down sideways backwards forwards and every other way and here was a gentile that probably couldn't quote one much less Ten Commandments and he his understanding astonished the Lord Jesus amen he understood that there was such Authority by speaking the word so he knew that the bodily presence of the Lord Jesus did not need to go to his home and lay hands on the Centurion now Jesus offers I'll go there I'll pray for him I'll go there now heal him they said no that's fine that's not necessary if you would just speak the word my servant will be healed amen now follow along with me if you will this morning what's the prophet he said Lord I'm not worthy for you to speak under under my roof I was talking about this man come under my roof rather but just speak the word there you are the authority he knew that Jesus had all power who told him this who told him how did he know Jesus had all power he had all power over sickness over all diseases over death hell he knew that all Jesus had to do is speak the word that settles it now Jesus was come willing to come and lay hands on the boy and rebuke the fever so it astonished him he said why I'm not found so fast so much Faith No not in Israel now the prophet uses this man as an example for many years in his ministry again he says that you noticed when he was going to pray for jariah's daughter to be raised zariah's a Jew he had been trained to lay hands on people giraffe said come lay your hands on my daughter and she'll live he had been taught that laying on of hands but to the Gentile he had been taught power and Authority now please understand me I'm not against lying on his hands and I will right here today if somebody needs it but a lot of it is where your faith is laying on of hands wrong absolutely not it's speaking the word wrong no well you'll find out here in a minute it's where your face is some people just have faith if a servant of God will touch them that something will happen and most unlikely it will but others could set or be at home or wherever and maybe they're 500 miles or a thousand miles or ten thousand miles away from where a servant of God is but if they can get you on the phone if they can send you an email or a text or whatever they believe if you pray God will do it why they recognize power and authority what's this it's according to what you believe both her faith was in Christ now watch your brother Branham captures Jarius he was a Jew so he believed in laying on a fence now he captures the Roman Centurion and he says both of them believed on the same person the Lord Jesus and both of them got what they needed but both of them got it in a different Channel what determined the channel their face in the way they believed it so jariah said come and lay your hands on my daughter and she'll be well and I realize there's an element of folks in the message that say well we should be Beyond laying off hands we don't need lay hands on the sick well I can understand that to a degree but if that's where people's faith is I'm going to pray for him and I'll do it to the long the last day of my life if that's what they need but I also know there are other people that know if they can hear that word and the inspiration falls on them they don't even need hands laid on them is that right brother Brad the Lord did for our brothers just a few weeks ago and he called me one day this week and he'd been shooting some nails and he had the reading a little small mailbox and he was able to read the tiny letters on the side of the mailbox because the Lord touched him sitting right here and corrected his eyes and then I repeated that one brother Joel was here of course and a sister from their church God healed their eyes I talked to her brother yesterday on the phone he'd been dealing with all kinds of things in his body swelling in his feet swelling in his legs couldn't even walk a matter of fact the last time I saw him I had to help him walk into a building the same time that I said that to Brother Brad the word that I mentioned diabetes the spirit of God struck our brother at home streaming the service the swelling is gone the inflammation is gone he went back to his Doctrine the doctor told him come back in a year I didn't lay hands on him I didn't lay hands under the bed I didn't lay hands on the sister from Brother Jules church but it was the spirit of God that struck them and they received it I don't know how you feel about it I wanted however God wants to send it to me amen I I personally believe if a man of God prays for me I don't necessarily need his hands on me but if he feels need to touch me go ahead and touch me rub me if you want to do whatever you need to do I need help I don't care how I've got to do it but I realize there's an element of people in the message always should be beyond that we don't need prayer for the sick no more I'll tell you one thing I think we need more prayer for the sick we've ever had it we've got more sick folks and we ain't the only church that's got sick folks everybody I've talked to has got sick folks and if they're sick folk everywhere Our God Specializes in healing the sin [Applause] now I want you to notice this he said it's according to what you believe both of their faith was in Christ one said speak the word and it'll be done the other one said lay your hands and it'll be done see it's according to what you believe well now that is the way it is here tonight many people has got the idea when people pray for the sick that there's something in the person that's praying for the sick that heals the sick now if you believe that today listen what you're believing that is an error so if you believe one certain man has something inside of him that's Healing The Sick you're believing wrong well Hallelujah y'all going to preach with me today that is an error it's in Christ that heals the sin his death at Calvary he paid the price for all the sins and all the sickness of the world and whosoever believeth upon that atonement that he made can never or can have whatsoever they ask the trouble lays in the people it's a lack of faith now watch again how it goes into this about gravitating toward a man I've heard so many of them say brother Branham if you'll touch me I'd get well well you know what that is that's Faith that's what it is it's it's what you believe you see the woman who come to the Tabernacle and she was sick and had a great need from God and she thought brother Brandon would be there she wasn't there brother Brown was out going somewhere else she said just show me where the man walked and let me walk in the footsteps that he walked and I'll be healed wow now if she would have had to had his hands laid on her then she would have totally left there defeated but her faith was not just in his hands her faith was he was a servant of God now can you imagine in the days of Peter that people may be sick crippled blind halt lame whatever they were and Peter would just walk on his way to the grocery store down to fish or do whatever and his shadow would go right across him and they would jump uphill by the power of God why their faith did not need for him to stop along and touch him and yet he did do that but how would God Minister according to people's face so you see if people believe that the only way they will get healed is for the pastor to lay hands on them then you know what I'm going to honor their face I'm going to do it but if they believe that they're in need and sickness and they believe what that same Faith they can call me on the phone or they can walk right up here and say you don't need to lay your hands on me speak the word and I'll be delivered if they believe that it will happen and the church said [Applause] oh my the Jews believed in laying on of hands the Gentile believed in say the word Lord my son will be healed is that right the Jews drives come lay your hand on my daughter and she'll live but the Romans said just speak the word and my servant will live that's right now listen what he says that's a higher that's a higher higher we people here in America has been taught you got to lay hands on them lay your hands well that's a Jewish idea that's not a gentile Doctrine by the Bible well praise the Lord some of y'all are tore all two pieces ain't you well no need to be the prophet was a great balancer you see where the schools of thought come from and those that don't believe in prayer lines and laying hands on the sick sure they can capitalize on these quotes but read the rest of them read the rest of them oh it just it just turns my stomach I can't hardly stand to hear a preacher that ain't balanced it just makes me sick it just makes me sick to my stomach I actually get physically nauseated when a preacher will just isolate certain quotes you know and just cabbage down on that and make it a Doctrine and I'm sitting there knowing he's leaving now 57 more that say something else also come on let's preach the whole thing amen church if we're going to believe it let's believe it all if we're going to accept the word of God let's accept all of it and that's let's not look down on people maybe people need their hands laid on them let's not look down on them and belittle them and make them less of a Christian May let's just ask God God's you minister to your people as they have need of according to where their faith is but I personally believe we're coming to A Time when the higher plane will be reached notice he said that's not a gentile Doctrine by the Bible of remembrance where I said come lay your hands on my daughter and she'll live at the Roman Centurion said I'm not worthy that you come under my house just speak the word Jesus said that's the greatest I never saw that in Israel now listen how sad but we just don't seem to be able to comprehend it in America well I personally want to be an exception to that quote praise the Lord now this is sad this is 1957. surely the goodness haven't we Advanced any since 1957. so we would still fit in a category that the prophet said we in America cannot seem to comprehend it God help us I want to comprehend it but what is it you see it shows how the tradition now to me what's wrong when you look at people having to have hands laid on them it becomes it it it must be it just has to be if brother Tim don't touch me brother Ron don't touch me brother Donnie brother Daryl don't oh brother Daryl so gifted he is but don't you understand it's not just how giftable the Daryl is it's the faith you have in God's promise again he said that Jesus always laying hands on everything as laying on his hands but what's the Gentile it wasn't so I'm not worried that you come under my roof just speak the word and my servant will live he turned around and said I never seen Faith like that in Israel there it is we're supposed to be on a go ahead and say it come on higher level than that was we're living on a closer to the World's End than we were then the Gentile way is believe the word Hallelujah I don't know I'm telling you there's been times in my life when I prefer to God the skin on it how many knows what I'm talking about oh sure yeah pray for me on the phone but if you feel Ed come by and just kind of hold my hand in the room you know just go ahead and lay your hands on me now come on I'm just being honest you might as well be honest too but yet is that where God wants us to stay what even to a spot you're a thousand some miles away from somebody that can lay hands on you I want the kind of faith that I can call him down right there if nobody is there to touch me I want to be able to call him down myself you see that's what the Roman Centurion did it's absolutely this is one of the most phenomenal things to me in the entire example of the New Testament Canon of scripture how did this man not even have the Holy Ghost this man not even confessing Jesus as his savior was not baptized by the Lord Jesus this man did not even embraced the reality of who he was as far as Redeemer and savior but yet he understood power and authority power and authority and he believed that what Jesus said would come to pass oh my notice he said what did Jesus say he turned around and said I never found Faith like this in Israel well that's the kind of things that we want here in California well let me not just limit it to the big state of California I say I want it here how many says with me we want it in Tennessee we want it in our church we want it in our families we want it in our homes Hallelujah I don't want this just to be an example in the Bible that was written 2 000 years ago I believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever well that's the kind of faith we want here in California that kind of Faith speak the word I don't think I'll ever forget it as long as I live and I'm in my right mind brother George Smith come up several several years ago and was still at the old place brother George has gone through some different things in his life and really just needed prayer needed Direction and all that from the Lord he come up and stood about in this position right here in the old church on that right hand side of the altar he come up to me and said something like this brother Donnie I believe you were God's gift to this area and I believe what you asked God God will do wow wouldn't it be something if we would be able to speak God's word in such a way that you don't have to have a gallon of oil or you don't even have to feel anything well it didn't feel no different that don't make any difference at all if a servant of God is Anointed to speak the word of God you walk away with absolutely no feeling whatsoever but if you believe it it will happen in your life and let me just tell you in case you're wondering so brother Donnie so so how is this going to work then the church that the prophet saw was coming and just in case you're wondering I have quotes before me that I'll get to momentarily this is not a my imagination this is something that brother Branham said was in the making and was coming a church that they would speak the word and it would flash like lightning so will it be just two or three special preachers and everybody in the message will go to them or everybody in the message will have to leave their church and and move to them to Three Special men you don't even believe the apostolic form of the Gospel if you believe that God is Not pointing to two or three special men God is Not pointing to one special man here in another special man God is pointing to his special people this ain't going to just be one preacher on another preacher and everybody's going to have to relocate brother that's not what they've done in the New Testament but Paul went up and down the islands of Crete over a hundred cities there and Paul spoke to Titus and said that had a great Revival imprete over a hundred cities and that visited every one of those cities and Villages and Paul run out of time and Paul left Titus there and he said I left you here to be able to ordain elders and ever cities so you see that's the way the Apostolic Church grew in the New Testament a church was not started to give a preacher a place to preach a church was started because a Revival come and people got saved and people got stirred it was the church that gave birth to the preacher not the preacher that gave birth to the church well come on somebody read your Bible read your Bible it was not that a man went out and done this and that and the other but it was the spirit of God sending a Revival and whenever the Revival come it demanded a preacher you see a church that's founded around a preacher they've got to have him the function they've got to have him to do this and that and the other but when the preacher has called on the scene because of the people it helps him to realize they don't need me near as much as I need them well come on somebody but if we're not careful we're getting out of our mind oh this great big God this great big guy everybody that's the move of God that's the only move of God in the last days that is the spirit of organization that is still around this message and I'm going to condemn it to my last breath God don't call a man in Tennessee or a man in Louisiana or a man in Virginia or West Virginia or in Germany and everybody around the world is supposed to move there God wants you to stay where he put you God wants you to stay and give your lives out to be able to progress Jesus Christ and let people see in your little place that he's the same yesterday today and forever foreign well here I go getting in trouble again notice this in Christ identified the same now what we try to do is try to get the people to believe the Lord Jesus and just accept him without being hands laid on now we know there's a scripture that says that lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and we don't try to belittle that scripture you see men who tried to belittle that are not operating in the channel of the anointing of Malachi 4. because the messenger Malachi 4 did not belittle one scripture to exalt another one you see it stumbled me years and years ago because I got saved in the trinitarian church and I was baptized in titles but there was people that would try to enlighten me on Acts 2 38 but one of the reasons I could never accept it was was their approach to it because it's like they took Acts 2 38 and tried to make it fight Matthew 28-19 but when a man talked to me one day and he didn't preach to me water baptism out of Acts 2 38 in the name of the Lord Jesus he actually talked to me about it out of Matthew 28 19 I thought now that man I can listen to because that man didn't take this scripture to fight this scripture I'll tell you I have a hard time with preachers that get up and take this quote to fight that quote and this quote to fight cut what kind of message have we got if that's what the message is come on somebody what kind of Bible have we got if this scripture finds that scripture and this and fights that there's got to be an understanding and that's where the problem lays it's not not the Bible fights the Bible it's not the message fights the message no the message fights the Bible it's knuckle-headed preacher someone made him call in the first place and they ain't got the Holy Ghost you watch how a man interprets the word and that'll tell you what he's called to preach or not God don't call no preacher that cannot preach itself out of a paper box come on somebody when God calls a man he's got the ability to rightly divide the word of Truth All a lot of preachers divide it but they don't rightly divide it but when a man is called of God he can take Matthew 28 19 compared to Acts 2 38 and say they say the same thing he can say yes sir the Bible says lay hands on the sick and the Bible also says speak the word that's a man that's called of God these are the kind of men that God wants in the last day that are not Kingdom Builders they're not looking to build a reputation all a following the they are interested in getting Jesus Christ to the people and the people can be so filled with the Holy Ghost if they have an accident out and they're by themselves they can believe the spirit of God can use their lips to speak his word [Applause] we don't try to belittle that scripture because that was the commission Jesus Christ gave to the church to lay hands on the sick but if you'll bear with me that was more like a Jewish tradition remember the girl and sick she died your eyes down to come lay your hands upon my child she'll get well but the Roman Center and the Gentile said I'm not worthy you come unto my roof just speak the word and my servant will live Jesus turned around and said I never sing Faith like that in Israel see the Gentile way I mean Gentiles have gone in your day home again it's unrealist the restaurant was Jews my Lord see the Gentile way is to believe him just absolutely believe him now we lay hands on the sick of course we do but we try to bring the reality by the scriptures of Jesus Christ being present because if I can ever get that over to you that he is here we have a musician's chat here at the church watch out we share songs quotes you know just testimonies things like that and we'll share different things that the Lord is doing in our church and not only our church but other churches of course and I always notice Harry and Harry will say this every now and then I hope we realize who's Among Us I hope we recognize his presence Among Us and it don't become common to us do you realize how blessed you are friends you understand there's people in the Tri-Cities that have never seen a miracle they've never even seen a Divine Healing they have never seen anyone raised from the dead and it's happened in your church don't let it become common Lord just the way it is no this is not the normal this is not the normal for the world out here they don't experience such things and this is only the beginning if we can keep ourselves small on our sight and see what the Lord God will do Among Us he don't want to prove us he wants to prove himself Among Us there's only one great one in the message and it just so happens to be it's the only great one that's ever been that's the Lord God from heaven somebody say Amen Hallelujah but we try to bring the reality by the scriptures of Jesus Christ being present then when you by faith reach up and touch him what see like the woman with the blood issue touched His Garment well you say if he was here I would touch him the Bible says Hebrews 3 that he's now a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he can be touched just as well tonight as he was then now we will say Amen to that quote but in reality do we really believe that do we really believe right here today that the Lord Jesus is just as accessible as it was that day when that woman reached out and touched the Hem of His Garment without a scripture without a quote without a promise that he would even do it but somehow it was revealed to her Oh Glory to God she believed that if she would touch him that he would change her life notice usually somebody said well you know brother so and so some Minister evangelist laid hands upon man all the Lord Heal Me that brother so-and-so laid hands on me that makes everybody want to see that brother lay hands on somebody oh testing one two three testing uh testing uh one two three uh testing one two three one two three one two three we haven't changed much have we now this quote is 1964. here we are in 2023 and people are still doing the exact same thing somebody actually at your brother's hands that that it's your faith but your face was if that brother prays for me I'll be well if that brother does it if that brother lays his hands on me and if your face would have been Lord Jesus I need you come by here Lord come by here Lord I need you won't you come by here but I would you do it for me yeah do you want me to do all the praying don't you you want me to Live 24 7. so close to God that at any time you need me you can call me and you have confidence that I do that you know why because some of us got more confidence in me than you got yourself and if you're living a life like that you ought to be ashamed of yourself we're right at the end time friends oh you may not be a preacher you don't have to be a preacher to believe God that woman that touched his grandma was not even saved she did not have the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] oh my now watch what happens then when a certain certain preacher and evangelist or whatever lays hands on everybody so then when the Evangelist leaves town the pastor is just a little bitty fellow and the side of the congregation usually some things happen in healings and so forth and they think they have to have the evangelists back in town before anybody can be healed well you know what I figure the one we need back in town is Jesus praise the Lord thank God for the brothers that come through my God's blessed us we've been having some wonderful meetings have we not we're brothers outside coming in and we're so grateful but you know what if none of them's within phone call distance this morning I believe the king himself is here I believe the healer is here after all by the Aaron Oliver is not the heater by the wrong Spencers not the hitter but the Doubt's not the Healer there's only one Healer the I said there's only one Healer and that's the Lord Jesus and according to his word if two or three well Gather in my name I'll be in their midst now listen to The Prophet's advice they seem to have to have the evangelists back in town before anybody can be healed listen don't you never believe that it's your face in God that does the healing You Must Believe God now if you can touch him then nobody laid hands on you was your him and your faith your faith brought to reality just don't even realize that it's our faith how can I lay hands on you and God stop heart attacks how can I lay hands on you and great things happen because I'm a great person I'm not but you have faith that if I do God will do it but yeah you look at yourself I ain't nobody I ain't got no faith if you didn't believe God wouldn't answer my prayer it's not me it's me and you together it's not this famous preacher that famous preacher it's us as the body of God and we have needs and we call on God and God performs Supernatural Among Us don't think you don't have faith and you're not believing it's you you it's just happened it was your faith that touched him in your faith brought the reality so then it wasn't no one touched you but your faith touched him and so that brings real genuine testimony to him but what do we tend to do well glory to God I want to testify today Hallelujah I want this certain certain meaning and this certain preacher prayed for me glory to God I want someone so I had something else and I went down and I followed him down there and so and so on he laid hands on me and he he prayed for me and God healed me and if we're not careful we're building a following and then what do many people do they want to sell everything they've got and go follow that preacher hey I'm going to preach today if you get mad at me and throw me out on my head I'll move somewhere just because a man prayed for you and you got healed you need to find the will of God for your life what if God ordains you to sit there well brother Donnie in our church it's cold there maybe God wanted to set you on fire and have you to help bring Revival to that cold church maybe God wanted you to be one of them that was shot clap in your hands and worshiping God my goodness friend where did the prophet ever tell us such stuff where did Brother Brown ever stand up and tell people to leave their church and move to the random Tabernacle we're doing things and preaching things that are not the message of the hour [Applause] ouch on me help me Jesus you know how I feel about that I don't want nobody here at this church unless God sends them if God sends them come if God don't send you stay where you are well glory to God you got a new building I hear God's doing this that another what's that got to do is you unless the Lord God lays it on your heart to be a part of our family if God lays it on your heart then leaves the right way obey it because God will never lead you to leave a church in a way that's contrary to his word and if you do you're on the wrong Foundation to begin with but if God says you're here we want you here but I'm going to tell you before you move you're going to fight hell because Satan hates this ministry Satan hates this church Satan hates you as the people of God why because we interrupt hell we deliver the sick we cast out Devils Hallelujah to God and Satan hates a church that believes God's word and that's what we believe hallelujah hallelujah foreign listen this I believe there's a church on its Road tonight a power of the Living God that men will speak the word here and there it's amazing how a lot of preachers leave out that there I want that quote to end there's something selfish in a man's heart when he feels that way why would I not want every church that really preaches this message I have Revival why would we not want healings and miracles and signs and wonder my goodness I can rejoice when I hear signs of one it don't have to just be at our church it don't have just to be among our people I thank God for every person that gets healed I thank God forever one of them come on children they don't have to just get saved in our church and healed in our church I'm just glad we're part of it oh this is your Prophet you did what you wish with it I believe there's a church on the road tonight a power of the Living God notice how he relates this a church tonight in the making a power of the Living God and Associates that church with the power of the Living God that man will speak the word here and there it will Flash like lightning and a church is coming out not a psychologist not some of this put on make-believe but a real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost called out Church and Word of Life Church said [Applause] [Music] this in Chautauqua I would sure hope that I live to see the day when we Americans will have that kind of Faith talking about the Roman Centurion to speak the word Lord and my servant will live oh it will be but this is 1959. the prophet never lived to see it see it we did the forerunners in this message never lived to see it but I believe before we leave this world we will see it as a matter of fact it's going on right now here you him 1960 there will be a power put into the church and now is coming in that the Holy Spirit was so anoint the people so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there I mean Carol was talking about it yesterday she didn't know what I was going to preach them but I was about to blow up I was like a helium balloon oh my goodness look at all these things and I told her I said you know I shared a few quotes with her and I said I I really don't care who it is I don't even care who it is that might speak the word and my daughter is delivered that don't matter to me it don't have to be a preacher as a matter of fact I'm one of the sisters of our church not long ago came to Carol left to church and said sister Carol I don't want you to think I'm crazy and think listen maybe she said I've just got such a burden on my heart to go pray for sister Erica Good Sister loved the Lord and you had never been in the world even guess who in the world to leave it is and Carol said absolutely honey absolutely you go on so her and Carol went over there in the presence of God come into the room that's where Erica was wouldn't it be just like God to use a woman would it be just like God not to use some dignified Hallelujah glory to God I've been on the field for 397 years and I've won this many people to the Lord and I've done this and I've done that and God sends some little housewife over and said sister in the name of Jesus get up and Erica jumps up out of the bed oh brother sister foreign ourselves right away from the presence of God because we tend to Rally around personalities and we tend to Rally around this Gifted Man or that Gifted Man but there is only one person we should rally around that ain't a preacher that ain't a singer that ain't a musician come on somebody but that's the Lord Jesus Christ he's our healer he's our deliverer he is our King Hallelujah he is a devil stop her he is a cancer killer he is a giant slayer that's my God I said that's my God thank you they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen Powers locks coming into the church now I know it for a fact say unto this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass and you can have what you've said the placing in position or the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then critics mouths will be shut hmm it'll be a short time Jesus come right off the mountain and went straight to Calvary notice it won't last long but it'll be here I'm gonna take some church if it ain't gonna last long we better get in while the getting's good unless it passes right in front of us and we're left waiting for it you understand clean up your lives get your hearts right get your spirits clean before God forgive trespasses quit holding grudges enter into the power of Jesus Christ forgive those that trespass against but brother Donnie I'm waiting on them to come and ask me I've been a pitiful shape today as much as I've been run down hurt lied on and everything else around the world I don't wait for people to come and ask me to forgive them I forgive him and the person of Christ himself I ain't waiting for him to come back and harbor an old heart feeling you want me to hold a grudge you want me to hold a heart feeling and you have a wreck and I've got to call somebody in Tanzania I've got to call somebody and Mount Kilimanjaro and make it right do you want me to live right every day do you expect me to live right to be in contact with God come on somebody well let me tell you what I expect is your pastor I expect you to live the same kind of life that you require of me don't just require me to live right and be in contact with God it might be your wife that needs you it might be your husband that needs you thank you foreign the Oneness of unity he's talking to the devil and this is what it tells him I just taught this people that God is in them [Music] but I'd like to say the same thing though sloofa I just taught these people God's in them you're ruined hahaha I just talked this people God is in them and if God is in them they speak they speak to that disease and say be away from me they do it foreign they speak to that disease and say be away from me and don't doubt in their heart right then that disease Lance and Erica went to the cancer doctor on Friday he walks in the door he first thing he says is you're too young to give up you're gonna fight we're gonna fight with you I was glad he felt that way but if you'd said the exact opposite it wouldn't change nothing come on Shane said y'all right the doctors well there ain't no hope but there's still hope in Jesus there ain't no hope for you to be set free of that that's a lie as long as you believe that you'll never move but if you believe that well the Holy Ghost I'm a daughter of God I've been telling Erica tell him why you want to live tell him I want to be a wife to my husband I want to be a mother to my daughters I want to be a daughter to my family I want to come back to church she cries she cries nearly weekly because she can't come to church and be of the house of God and some of you stay home because of a headache I say shame on you you imagine brother Ron Spencer getting up preaching fighting cancer every day of his life the people he will condemn at the day of judgment and they stay home for the least little saying I'll tell your friends this time that we arise and realize who we are we are part of the army of God you are important you are important you are important Hallelujah I cannot do this on my own I need you we need one another and Together We Will Conquer hell let me close I may find a place to stop the Lord put this sermon together for me well for me it takes me days [Laughter] I knew we was going to have a time today when he started pouring this out on me I thought Jesus Oh Glory to God I can't wait to get to church tomorrow I can't wait because I believe we're going to see a great manifestation and because I don't care what it is if you say to the mountain be moved listen carefully if you've got to go over the mountain for a purpose somebody would say oh I'm a great man of Faith I'll move that mountain it'll never move but if there's something over the mountain that you've got to get over there to do the will of God and you can't get over it under it or around it and yet something in your heart is telling you to go you speak the word don't you doubt and maybe when you speak the word only one little grain of sand we'll fall but it's on its Road and the next day maybe a spoonful may drop the next day a teacup full you'll never notice it but if you'll just hold steady Hallelujah knowing that it's being done after a while the whole thing will fall in That's the Way It Is by Divine Healing when you see the working of the Holy Spirit the word laid on the Holy Spirit anointing that word proving it that he's here in our midst to vindicate himself to give you the promise then you accept your healing the standard the Holy Ghost is deity God tabernacled in men it's more than a sensation more than speaking in tongues more than shoutings in the spirit it's more than weeping more than joining the church it's guilty God himself tabernacled in that person and when he can speak same just the same it's gone that's the church of Jesus Christ that's the way the First Apostolic Church forth praise the Lord praise the Lord you imagine a little insignificant ignorant woman sitting there hearing the prophet talk about the great things that God had done brother George Wright you've hunted squirrels all these years have you ever seen one in the thicket if you ever this no brother random I I ain't never seen it well the only thing I know is it must have been Jehovah Jireh and that was little Hattie that ain't nothing but the truth so sisters don't worry don't get you an iPad and start sending to preach the sermon to preach the word you're a part to contribute to the body may not be but a half a dozen words or it may not be but one amen and when you say Amen healing flows through your body Oh Glory to God maybe the spirit of God but inspire me or some other minister to say God's going to bring your children back God hallelujah you believe what you want to believe I believe we're in an hour when God is calling back the backsliders don't give up on your children don't give up on your family don't give up on your loved ones come on somebody Do You Realize by you saying amen and agreeing to that it might be your very word that will punctuate and release the holy ghost out of this service and go start dealing with that boy you're yours sitting over the beer in his hand today sitting there hiring a kite on dope and that amen from your heart why because you said what had you right said be it unto me Lord yes Lord that's right that's your word that ain't nothing but the truth except you condensed it in that little four-letter word amen being unto me Lord be it unto my son be it unto my daughter bring them back God Hallelujah as a certain young man away from God told his parents not long ago you all quit praying for me this is your all's fault I ain't got no peace I ain't got this thank God I ain't got no money y'all quit praying for me how can we Hallelujah [Applause] thank you Lord let me read you one more Kenneth before we pray purging me in churches that when a spirit-born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips well that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man how many knows we got some moving up to do let's bow our head shall we how many beliefs what you've heard today now you may not understand it but you believe you believe God can do it you believe we're living in that hour amen praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus how many wants to be apart of what our God is doing friends can you imagine for hundreds and thousands of years the church has longed for this hour that you live in how loose it would have traded his place Brother Louis to be a part of Word of Life how Wesley how many of the Saints in that day would have loved to live here in this day this is the crescendo this is the crowning of all the ages that God allowed you to live I had confidence in you brother Jack he had confidence in your brother Byron that should stand that confidence in you young people young men young women that you'll be able to resist Satan and all of his powers in this

head he's at Franklin Woods I don't want you to hold your knee now on this one as well in our hearts Heavenly Father I'll be the first to admit I don't understand all that I preached today it's so profound it's so wonderful and yet so simple but yeah Lord I believe I believe how can a human speak words a miraculous happen Lord I've thought about it in the last several weeks when you had me to pray that prayer and I just mentioned the word diabetes and one Miracle after another I could say that word every day from now on to the rapture and it don't mean the same thing would ever happen again I didn't pre-plant it I didn't pick the word I didn't choose it but it was just following the leading of the spirit help us to see we don't want to leave here today Fred and worried oh oh no oh no how am I going to know how I'm Gonna Know your father will give you the words to say amen many times we may not even be conscious of it ourself but it's him speaking out of us generally the more we put thought into it the more we get in the way so Lord the thing of it is if we can just get out of the way oh Jesus oh Jesus we worship you today Father I pray for all these hundreds of people Lord God I believe with all of my heart and many of them were sincere and they love you with all of their heart they want to be a part of what you're doing Lord Lord Jesus we pray for brother Caleb Dixon

hands in the presence of the Lord let's just worship him now you know worship creates a a love atmosphere between the bride and the bridegroom that you just kind of move yourself aside for just a little bit and forget the person that sent him by you and behind you in front of you around you just close off everybody else for just a little and go to worship and him and tell him what he means to you how good he's been to you how you're long and deceive it Hallelujah Hallelujah we worship you today Lord Jesus we're not interested in praising any man are not interested O Lord and adoring any man any preacher any person we're here to worship you oh God we bless your name we worship you Lord Jesus I was born to serve you father Hallelujah it reverberated in my soul last week every time I'd hear the prophet say it when he talked about little Georgie Carter laying there in that bed for all of those years nine years and so many months she was that little lamb Hallelujah that the prophet heard screaming out hallelujah hallelujah and he said she was born to serve God or it was like it was like he called my name in there Hallelujah may we hear our name called today Father that we won't just hear Georgie Carter or William Branham or Paul or Luther or some great person that we have such admiration for but may we hear our name call from there it's Harry several years ago was listened to the invisible Union and the prophet talks about the old violinist as he picked up the violin and there was auctioning off who gave me a dollar who give me five who give me this and that but all of a sudden someone stepped out of the audience and put rosin on the bow and began to tune the violin Hallelujah and then the bids went from a dollar or five to a thousand five thousand ten thousand what was it the touch of the master and then the prophet changes over from the violin and to say I called you and I'll ordained you and so on and so on and Harry said it just so punctuated it was like the Lord God was speaking to him himself that's when the word is so real father oh Jesus we love you today Lord we don't want to just be churchgoers we don't want to just be pure warmers father we want to be holy ghost Fields Sons and Daughters of God that you can use in the army of the Lord we worship you today Father we bless your name we bless your name Lord Jesus friends as Esther of old was
