[31:48] that we know the inspired words to the
[31:52] song it's more than just a Melody it's
[31:56] more than harmonic Voices That Could
[31:59] blend together but it's the message that
[32:02] it carries that Rings true to us

[32:09] true and we believe Lord that you're

[32:36] to be you that does it so we are no more
[32:40] than just instruments that we present
[32:42] ourselves here today no more than this
[32:45] microphone or this organ or piano or
[32:48] guitar which are mutes within themselves

[32:58] make such beautiful music come out of it
[33:01] so today oh great father would you take
[33:04] our lives our bodies Our Minds our souls
[33:08] into your hands May something beautiful

[34:41] going to uh take a little bit of a
[34:44] sabatical from it and he's not resigning
[34:45] we're not getting nobody to replace him
[34:47] and there ain't no sin so don't get your
[34:49] old mind wondering about something like
[34:50] that but he just going to be on a little
[34:52] bit of a rest and then we'll re-evaluate
[34:54] it after a while as a matter of fact and
[34:56] I got to thinking about taking sabatical
[34:58] I thought man I've been preaching most
[34:59] of my life maybe I deserve
[35:02] one turned 57 last week and been
[35:05] preaching since I was 18 so that's a
[35:07] long time isn't it amen I'd like to say
[35:10] we appreciate all of our deacons our
[35:12] trustees all the officers here at the
[35:14] church and you know go ahead get my
[35:25] out there's much more to making a Church
[35:28] worked in the
[35:29] preacher that's right there's so much
[35:31] that goes on behind the scenes that so
[35:33] many people do and uh I'd like to say
[35:35] that we appreciate everybody that does
[35:37] what they do here 1 John chap 3: 11 now
[35:42] listen what I want to speak to you today
[35:45] how
[35:45] terrible is
[35:48] hate how
[35:50] terrible is
[35:51] hate 1 John 3:
[35:55] 11 for this is the the message that you
[35:58] have heard from the beginning that we
[36:01] should love one
[36:02] another not as Cain who was of that
[36:06] Wicked one and slew his brother
[36:09] wherefore slew he him because his own
[36:12] Works were evil and his brothers
[36:16] righteous Marvel not Brethren if the
[36:19] world hate you we know that we have
[36:22] passed from Death unto life because we
[36:25] love the brethren
[36:27] he that loveth not his brother abideth
[36:31] in
[36:32] death and whosoever hateth his brother
[36:35] is a
[36:36] murderer and you know that no murderer
[36:40] has eternal life abiding in him now this
[36:44] does not mean now a person who has
[36:46] murdered someone in sin that this is an
[36:48] unpardonable sin but John is saying that
[36:51] no murder with hate in his heart
[36:53] currently can have eternal life living
[36:56] in him may God bless his words you may
[36:58] be
[37:08] seated hate is one of the invisible sins
[37:12] of the
[37:14] heart that sometimes people can keep for
[37:16] years and
[37:17] years sometimes it can be there for
[37:21] decades and it can hide there are many
[37:23] sins of the heart of course some sins
[37:26] are more visible to the outside and
[37:29] people do them and other people notice
[37:33] them and see them or hear them if
[37:35] they're words that they say actions that
[37:37] they do but there are some sins that are
[37:40] actually sins of the heart and a person
[37:44] could keep it so disclosed for such a
[37:47] long time and hardly nobody but them and
[37:51] God maybe they're real close intimate
[37:53] family or friends would ever know that
[37:56] it's there now hate tends to be one of
[37:59] those types of sins yet there will be
[38:02] things that will for those who have the
[38:05] extreme cases of it that will be able to
[38:08] Manifest this hate it's sad to say but
[38:11] we're living in a world that is full of
[38:13] hate we have racial hatred we have
[38:16] cultural hatred we have all kinds of
[38:18] hatred and no matter how much that we
[38:20] would try to educate the people into
[38:23] loving one another and to being
[38:25] understanding and don't you know don't
[38:27] hate people because we're of A different
[38:29] race or of a different color or even of
[38:31] a different Creed we will never
[38:33] accomplish that there will be no real
[38:35] peace until the Prince of Peace comes
[38:38] back to the Earth in spite of all the
[38:41] education we've got more educated people
[38:43] on the Earth than we've ever had we've
[38:45] got more millionaires and more
[38:47] billionaires than has ever been and yet
[38:49] there is more hatred there is more
[38:52] despising of people because of you know
[38:54] all these different things than there's
[38:56] ever been no doubt on the earth because
[38:57] because there's more people on the Earth
[38:58] and yet we're we're making more sense
[39:00] this is not right we shouldn't do this
[39:02] we shouldn't do this we shouldn't do and
[39:04] the more we talk about it the more
[39:05] people do it because the power to
[39:08] release people from hate is not just
[39:10] convincing them that they shouldn't do
[39:12] it they must be another life which will
[39:16] come into them to release them from the
[39:18] hold that hate has on their life cuz it
[39:21] is a powerful emotion it is a very
[39:24] powerful thing that has been on the
[39:26] human race since after the fall of Man
[39:28] in the very beginning now Adam was not
[39:31] the originator of hate even after the
[39:33] fall it was not in Adam to hate it was
[39:36] not in Adam to murder it was not in Adam
[39:39] to do many of the vile things that we
[39:41] see that are being done in this day it
[39:43] was just not in him even after the fall
[39:46] but yet hate is a thing that can lay uh
[39:49] so embedded in a person's life people
[39:51] can hate preachers they can hate Church
[39:53] they can hate family members they can
[39:55] hate all kinds of different things and
[39:57] yet it can lay there and they can be so
[39:59] quiet about it because they learn to a
[40:02] degree to control it and they learn to
[40:04] make it almost expressionless with on
[40:06] the outside just in themsel it's not
[40:09] they Maul over it constantly but
[40:12] eventually it will come out because it
[40:14] is the type of thing that requires
[40:17] manifestation now what we' like to look
[40:19] at today is how that this can be inside
[40:21] of a person's heart for some people it's
[40:23] very visible depending on how agitated
[40:26] they become notice notice the words of
[40:28] the Lord Jesus in Matthew 5: 21 ye have
[40:31] heard that it was said by them of old
[40:33] time Thou shalt not kill and whosoever
[40:37] shall kill will be in danger of the
[40:40] Judgment now this is actually emerging
[40:43] of The Commandments that God gave to the
[40:45] children of Israel but it's merged with
[40:47] an oral tradition by the Jews now the
[40:50] latter part of this is actually the
[40:51] merging of that tradition because the
[40:53] Ten Commandments says one of The
[40:54] Commandments Thou shalt not kill but the
[40:56] merging of the Jewish fathers and their
[40:58] Traditions was whosoever shall kill
[41:01] shall be in danger of the Judgment now
[41:03] Moses never said that the Torah never
[41:05] says it but yet they merg that into with
[41:09] the teaching of the law but now watch
[41:11] Jesus he's going to go a step further
[41:14] than that but I say unto you that
[41:17] whosoever is angry with his brother
[41:20] without a cause shall be in danger of
[41:23] the Judgment now he has the authority
[41:27] because he is God God gave the Ten
[41:30] Commandments but here is Christ which is
[41:32] God's representative on the earth the
[41:34] Son of God as we call it and he was the
[41:37] one that was given Authority so he makes
[41:40] an amendment as it was to what God had
[41:43] said now why because Grace is going to
[41:46] magnify many things that were in the law
[41:49] and we know that many times people
[41:50] certainly of the wrong conception of
[41:52] Grace because they think Grace accept
[41:54] Grace well Grace only let you get by
[41:56] with more grace Grace magnifies many
[41:59] things now watch jesus takes it now a
[42:02] step further he's going to bring it to
[42:05] the inside of man where the law dealt
[42:07] more on the outside that if a man killed
[42:10] a man and we know of course by the uh
[42:12] the Avenger of blood and all that the
[42:14] Cities of Refuge that if a person killed
[42:16] another person and they did not
[42:18] intentionally do it then there were
[42:19] cities set up all over Israel and they
[42:21] could flee to that and there they would
[42:23] be able to hide but they must stay there
[42:26] the rest of their life life or until the
[42:28] death of the high priest then they would
[42:30] be released to go from that City of
[42:32] Refuge or until the Avenger of blood had
[42:34] died and yet it was all set up because
[42:37] of innocent people and to protect those
[42:39] that accidentally killed a man if they
[42:41] were working together and your axe head
[42:43] flew off and hit another man in the head
[42:45] and yet there was no grief there was no
[42:47] Strife between you it was proven hey
[42:49] this man didn't do it wrong but still he
[42:52] was not relieved from that he had to go
[42:54] to be able to live in this other city
[42:56] but now then it must have been actual
[42:58] Murder by which a person was held
[43:00] responsible but Grace is now coming in
[43:03] and with Grace is coming a magnification
[43:06] of the heart the intent of the heart
[43:09] what lays in the heart and things that
[43:11] can be hid in the heart that would never
[43:14] come out the truth of it is there are
[43:16] multiplied thousands times thousands of
[43:20] murderers that are alive in the Earth
[43:22] today but they've never murdered anybody
[43:25] because they're afraid of the law amen
[43:28] or they wouldn't want their name in the
[43:30] paper but the spirit of hatred is so
[43:34] firm in their hearts that in the eyes of
[43:37] God God would accredit murder to them
[43:41] now I hope you're going to listen to me
[43:42] and you're going to say Amen every now
[43:44] and then now watch the Lord Jesus he
[43:46] brings it he Compares verse 21 you've
[43:48] heard that was said by them of old time
[43:50] Thou shalt not killed whosoever shall
[43:52] kill shall be in danger of the Judgment
[43:54] now the New Covenant what's it what it's
[43:56] going to do but I say unto you that
[43:59] whosoever is angry with his brother
[44:03] without a cause shall be in danger of
[44:07] the judgment and whosoever shall say to
[44:10] his brother raaka shall be in danger of
[44:13] the counsel but whosoever shall say thou
[44:17] fool shall be in danger of Hell
[44:22] Fire now even if you murdered a man in
[44:25] the Old Testament it did not NE
[44:27] necessarily mean that you were in danger
[44:29] of hail fire that you was going to go to
[44:31] the gehenna but here the law is now
[44:34] ending and Grace is coming on the earth
[44:37] and Grace actually brings a
[44:40] magnification to many of these things
[44:41] now you imagine this must have been
[44:43] overwhelming as they're hearing this so
[44:45] Jesus actually goes back to the
[44:48] murderous act being carried out from the
[44:50] secret which was the intent of the heart
[44:54] now for those that would just be moved
[44:56] upon in a rage you know even our law
[44:58] looks at the same thing whether it's
[45:00] homicide first degree murder second
[45:01] degree murder whatever it is they look
[45:03] at it according was it a rage of anger
[45:05] was it premeditated did you plan into it
[45:07] was it something that happened and out
[45:09] of a rage you just did it according if
[45:11] they can prove it one way or the other
[45:12] will be your judgment but here the Lord
[45:15] Jesus says for a man just to be mad at
[45:17] his brother without a cause and the
[45:19] Greek word there is very explicit and
[45:21] how that it says a justifiable cause not
[45:23] just something you get mad at somebody
[45:25] but if you actually get angry with your
[45:27] brother and if if it's over a trivial
[45:30] matter that really you have no right to
[45:32] get angry over Jesus says that you're in
[45:34] danger that you come in Conflict to
[45:37] where you can be judged now you know
[45:38] there was two tribunal judges given to
[45:40] the children of Israel and that was
[45:42] three rather there was three and then
[45:44] there was 21 and then there was 72
[45:47] according to the how severe the thing
[45:49] was that you had done if it was a minor
[45:51] type thing You' go before three judges
[45:52] if it was more severe he'd go before 21
[45:55] if it was the severest of all you'd go
[45:57] before the Sanhedrin which was 72 but
[46:00] now here Jesus brings the intent of the
[46:02] heart and showing that with this new
[46:05] covenant with Grace with Mercy with love
[46:07] with forgiveness with pardon with all of
[46:09] these things that we are required of
[46:11] more God does not let us get by with
[46:14] more because we're under grace he
[46:16] requires more of us but it's not more
[46:19] under legalism it's more from the heart
[46:22] because the heart is to have a new King
[46:25] on its throne that's right now watch he
[46:28] says if a man would be angry with his
[46:31] brother which is of course in the heart
[46:33] where God looks now most people may not
[46:36] even know that you would be angry with
[46:38] this man or this woman or this boy or
[46:40] girl but it would be what it would be a
[46:42] secret sin of the heart and maybe you
[46:44] would walk away and you'd never say
[46:46] anything you wouldn't lose your temper
[46:48] nobody would even know but yet from that
[46:51] it become the bursting point from that
[46:53] anger they hurt you feelings embarrass
[46:55] you they humiliated you whatever but you
[46:57] begin to think over it and think over it
[46:59] and Maul over it and on and on and on
[47:01] until that turn into a hatred and then
[47:04] you find yourself having very ill
[47:06] feelings and very ill thoughts toward
[47:08] that individual and thoughts that
[47:10] actually frighten you and yet nobody may
[47:13] not know it but you see God knows it so
[47:15] he looks on the very intent of the heart
[47:18] and that's where many problems I'm
[47:20] afraid friends lay and we realize that
[47:23] many people get overcome and they'll
[47:25] kill somebody or do bodily damage or
[47:26] injury to them and then they you know
[47:28] the truth is find out well really I've
[47:30] harbored this thing for a long long time
[47:32] I should have let it go I should have
[47:33] let it go let me tell you today do not
[47:35] let hate build up in your life it is
[47:38] contrary to God God hates sin but God
[47:42] loves The Sinner God it's not God's will
[47:45] that any should perish but that all
[47:47] should come to repentance no matter how
[47:49] mean they are how Wicked they are how
[47:51] vile they are that's how much he loves
[47:53] humanity and if we are his offspring
[47:56] should not we love them in the same
[47:58] perspective we cannot love them of
[48:00] course in the same quantity because he
[48:02] is the whole volume of eternal love but
[48:04] you take what measure of love that you
[48:06] and I have oh I want to love like God I
[48:08] do too but I don't have all of the
[48:11] Eternal realm of God's love but if
[48:14] you'll take my love when it buts and
[48:16] you'll be able to put it under a
[48:17] microscope and take it into a spiritual
[48:19] laboratory it'll have the same
[48:21] characteristics that Father's Love does
[48:23] it just won't be the same amount
[48:27] now so Jesus says that if a man is angry
[48:30] with his brother without a cause or if a
[48:32] man says Raa now to us this word means
[48:35] absolutely nothing but to the Jews now
[48:37] look what it means Rea is empty
[48:39] senseless empty-headed man a term of
[48:42] reproach used among the Jews in the time
[48:45] of Christ that was a Syriac word that
[48:47] came from the Syria that begin to merge
[48:49] into the Jewish language so it was a
[48:51] word that they would use to one another
[48:54] and there are several different examples
[48:55] in the historical writings of Joseph and
[48:57] other Jewish writers where that puts it
[48:58] in a setting where you can understand a
[49:00] little better but they would look at
[49:02] someone they would call them a senseless
[49:03] fool a blockhead you ain't got no sense
[49:06] you're stupid you're an idiot and yet
[49:07] they were not saying the truth so this
[49:09] is not a foolish man of course is one
[49:11] that we know that would lack wisdom this
[49:13] is not the setting by which Jesus is
[49:15] youing using this but it is someone out
[49:18] of anger someone out of hatred someone
[49:20] out of Vengeance that is calling people
[49:23] names amen well y'all sure are C
[49:28] already my I wonder how much name
[49:31] calling we doing this message that we'd
[49:32] be better off to stop most of
[49:36] it praise the lord well Glory y'all
[49:39] going to get quiet on me Ain you it's
[49:41] all right we're going to we're going to
[49:42] preach anyway now notice Jesus goes a
[49:45] step further he said I say unto you that
[49:46] whosoever is angry with this brother
[49:48] without a cause shall be in danger of
[49:50] the Judgment now notice in danger of the
[49:52] Judgment whosoever shall say to his
[49:55] brother Reika shall be in danger of the
[49:58] counsel but whosoever shall say thou
[50:01] fool shall be in danger of Hellfire now
[50:05] look at this this is not saying to a
[50:07] people because Jesus said to those even
[50:09] of his disciples thou fools and slow of
[50:12] heart why are you so of heart to believe
[50:14] but Jesus is using the same word in a
[50:17] total different application now notice
[50:20] what the word would mean in in this day
[50:22] if you were there and hear Jesus say
[50:24] that so it comes from the Greek word
[50:26] nabal which is a wicked reprobate
[50:29] destitute of all spiritual or Divine
[50:32] knowledge in other words it would be a
[50:34] name that we would attach to people that
[50:36] we don't like or people that we disagree
[50:39] with and we strip them of absolutely all
[50:42] Christianity we take away from them
[50:45] they're not even Justified they're not
[50:46] even saved they don't even know nothing
[50:49] about
[50:54] God and when we do that to individual we
[50:57] are in danger of Hell
[51:01] ourselves why we're moving in the place
[51:05] of God Amen now just because a person's
[51:08] an error or they would disagree with you
[51:10] or I it doesn't mean you're not a
[51:12] Christian it doesn't mean that God
[51:14] hasn't done a work in their heart but
[51:16] Jesus is showing they showing that the
[51:18] extremity by which people can grow in
[51:20] hatred and the extremity that they would
[51:23] Express this and become so vinant that
[51:27] they would actually deny any work of God
[51:29] in this individual's life in other words
[51:32] God has not done one thing for you
[51:34] you're nothing you are worthless God's
[51:37] never saved you God's never Sanctified
[51:39] you now what you're doing you're taking
[51:41] into your hands and you're becoming God
[51:44] and now you're judging God himself and
[51:47] you're saying God has done nothing for
[51:49] that individual When God says yes I have
[51:53] too
[51:55] woo oh my for a man any man to decide
[52:00] and say you are worthless don't you see
[52:02] friend whenever we would move to this
[52:04] degree then we are presuming to look at
[52:07] this person's soul and say you are not
[52:11] savable you are not even worth fooling
[52:14] with there's only one being that knows
[52:16] that and that's
[52:17] God now we might say if people continue
[52:20] to go on as they are they're going to
[52:22] wind up in hell that's one thing but for
[52:24] you to say this individual that IND
[52:26] indidual or me to say that individual is
[52:28] serpent see there ain't none of us know
[52:30] that there's one person that knows and
[52:33] we get in trouble when we go to
[52:35] attaching names and certain things to
[52:37] people and speaking out their Destiny
[52:40] when we don't even know our own we
[52:42] believe by faith by grace through faith
[52:45] we're saved you sure don't know anybody
[52:53] else's oh my
[52:57] Jesus says under the law you had to
[53:00] literally kill a man but in my
[53:03] kingdom anger in the heart to such a
[53:07] severity I will judge it as
[53:15] murder now look at the letter part of
[53:17] this verse I say unto you that whosoever
[53:19] is angry with his brother without a
[53:20] cause shall be in danger of the Judgment
[53:22] whosoever shall teach his brother Rea
[53:25] shall be in danger of the counsel but
[53:27] whosoever shall say thou fool shall be
[53:29] in danger of Hell
[53:31] Fire now look at this Hellfire the Greek
[53:34] is the gehenna of fire the term gehenna
[53:39] arose from the valley of henm which is
[53:42] south of Jerusalem where the Canaanites
[53:44] burned human sacrifices to
[53:47] molok after the return of the Jews from
[53:50] the Captivity they made it a place of
[53:52] defilement where they The Refuge of the
[53:54] city was strong and burnt bur garbage
[53:57] done now up to this time when the the
[54:00] ancient he Heathen Canaanites they
[54:03] offered human sacrifice in the valley of
[54:06] geham or hen so it become this word of
[54:09] gehen so Jesus says that whenever a
[54:12] person would say this and go to this
[54:14] degree with her brother I can't you see
[54:17] he is identifying that the two are in
[54:19] the same move this is a brother so
[54:22] they're in the same move and they're
[54:23] confessing the same thing but one gets
[54:26] it odds with the other and then that one
[54:28] which is at such odds will totally strip
[54:31] the other one of anything toward God at
[54:34] all they're lost they're a devil they're
[54:37] a Judas they're a serpent seed friends
[54:39] we're walking on Dangerous Ground when
[54:40] we do
[54:41] that now you know have to raise your
[54:43] hand but I want you to look back and
[54:44] think about your lives when folks have
[54:46] crossed you how many times have we been
[54:48] guilty of doing such
[54:52] things now there is a place to where you
[54:54] move from attacking that individual to
[54:57] where you are attacking the work of God
[55:00] in that individual's life and when
[55:02] you're saying they are serpent seed and
[55:04] yet their name might be on the Lamb's
[55:06] Book of Life so you're saying one thing
[55:08] and God's saying something else just
[55:10] because they're living this way now
[55:13] don't mean they'll be doing that
[55:14] tomorrow in 24 hours they could be
[55:17] repented of everything they
[55:19] said and then what about you said about
[55:22] them the day
[55:24] before well praise the Lord now watch
[55:28] this Jesus turns and speaks to the Jews
[55:31] in St John 8: 38 I speak that which I
[55:36] have seen with my father and you do that
[55:39] which you have seen with your father now
[55:42] keep this in mind now he's the only one
[55:45] that could be able to speak words so
[55:47] personal not generic now I could say
[55:50] that in a generic way but when I go to
[55:53] putting names and you are your father
[55:55] the devil you're of your father of the
[55:56] devil you're your I have no right to do
[55:59] any such thing unless the spirit of God
[56:02] would reveal to man I hope he never does
[56:04] cuz I don't want to know who's saved and
[56:05] who is lost but preaching it in generic
[56:09] terms so where it would be if people
[56:10] continue on this way and if they do this
[56:13] and this and this they're going to be
[56:14] lost we can say it that way but to say
[56:17] that any of us know another's individual
[56:20] Destiny we are lying
[56:26] right but it just so happened Jesus
[56:29] knew I speak that which I have seen with
[56:32] my father and you do that which you have
[56:33] seen with your father uhoh here we go
[56:38] now I realize this would could be
[56:39] considered hate speech today but you and
[56:41] I believe it's the anointed words of God
[56:44] they answered and said unto him Abraham
[56:47] is our
[56:48] father Jesus said unto them if Abra if
[56:51] you were Abraham's children you would do
[56:53] the works of Abraham but now ye seek to
[56:59] kill
[57:01] me now who are these people robbers
[57:05] Bandits
[57:06] Highwaymen
[57:08] priests
[57:10] Levites Jews praise the
[57:13] Lord you seek to kill me a man that has
[57:19] told you the truth which I have heard of
[57:21] God this did not Abraham if y'all are
[57:23] Abraham's kids you sure are acting a lot
[57:25] different than him now if we claim to be
[57:28] the progeny of this message are we
[57:30] acting the same way the messenger
[57:32] brought in the same Spirit he brought it
[57:35] in now you see this thing of murdering
[57:39] and killing did not just surface itself
[57:41] here in St John 8 it was something that
[57:43] be to brood among the Pharisees and the
[57:46] scribes and all of them for quite some
[57:48] time it was something that might have
[57:50] been very very secret in their hearts
[57:52] but then it became very vocal now watch
[57:54] they're going to prove who their father
[57:57] is by the manifestation of the direction
[57:59] that they're going watch this in Matthew
[58:01] chapter 26 verse 59 now the chief
[58:04] priests and elders and all the councel
[58:07] sought false witness against Jesus to
[58:10] put him to death now remember no
[58:13] murderer has eternal life abiding in him
[58:16] now it was not the radicals it was not
[58:19] the because Jesus was tur up all
[58:21] the prostitute houses it was not all the
[58:23] beer makers and all the scotch makers
[58:25] and they're against Jesus cuz Jesus is
[58:27] preaching against whiskey and alcohol
[58:29] but it was the chief priest and the
[58:31] Sanhedrin and the
[58:34] counsel all the great religious leaders
[58:36] of the day but now their hate for Jesus
[58:39] has moved into this open vicious cycle
[58:43] that they are seeking to kill
[58:48] him I don't want to alarm you don't want
[58:50] to shock you there's folks in the
[58:51] message it's exactly the same
[58:54] way Matthew 271 and when the morning was
[58:57] come all the chief priests and Elders of
[58:59] the people took counsel against
[59:02] Jesus to put him to
[59:05] death now if the leaders is doing that
[59:08] you can imagine what the L folks is
[59:10] going to do Mark 14:1 after two days and
[59:13] the Feast of Passover of unle bread and
[59:15] the chief priest and the scribes sought
[59:17] how they might take him by
[59:19] Craft remember the word
[59:22] subtlety the serpent was the most subtle
[59:25] of all the Beast of the
[59:27] field part of the characteristics of the
[59:30] word subtle is
[59:32] craftiness now hear the nature of their
[59:35] father is being reflected into them by
[59:38] the way they're going about doing it and
[59:40] the ultimate goal is to kill Jesus
[59:44] Christ
[59:45] amen why
[59:48] hatred hatred St John 12:10 but the
[59:52] chief priest consulted that they might
[59:54] put Lazarus
[59:56] also to death now Lazarus is a walking
[1:00:01] Miracle right Jesus raised him from the
[1:00:04] dead and there's a lot of folks around
[1:00:06] in the community that knew
[1:00:08] it he was a walking miracle and now they
[1:00:12] want to kill a walking Miracle not only
[1:00:15] the miracle
[1:00:16] maker can't you understand why the devil
[1:00:18] hates you if you're a child of God he
[1:00:20] not only hates the miracle maker he
[1:00:22] hates the miracle he hates the
[1:00:24] supernatural that God Is Right in your
[1:00:26] life oh my you might question me on this
[1:00:29] Theology and I might not have the answer
[1:00:31] you might question me on this point of
[1:00:32] Doctrine I might not have the answer but
[1:00:34] if you want to know am I a miracle I
[1:00:37] have the answer yes sir I may not be
[1:00:39] able to explain this date and line this
[1:00:41] up with this and that up with that but I
[1:00:43] know one thing I have been changed by
[1:00:46] the power of God I have been changed and
[1:00:49] I not only me but there's hundreds
[1:00:52] sitting here this morning that are
[1:00:54] Miracles that have been changed by the
[1:00:56] power of
[1:00:57] [Applause]
[1:01:03] God all poor old Lazarus done was just
[1:01:06] got
[1:01:11] up he wasn't trying to cause no Revolt
[1:01:13] he wasn't doing nothing I mean he just
[1:01:15] laying under the grave
[1:01:18] rotten nose done fell in him and he
[1:01:21] wouldn't bother nobody just causing a
[1:01:22] stink was all but yet here they are
[1:01:25] they're hat it is so grown now notice
[1:01:27] starts out with Jesus and now it goes
[1:01:29] beyond Jesus and it goes to those that
[1:01:32] are recipients of his miracles remember
[1:01:34] in St John nine when the man that was
[1:01:36] healed had been blind for all those
[1:01:37] years and they come and said hey get
[1:01:39] away from Jesus don't have nothing to do
[1:01:40] with him said this man's a sinner he
[1:01:42] said this is a marvelous thing whether
[1:01:43] he's a sinner or not I don't know but
[1:01:45] this one thing I do know whereas I was
[1:01:47] buying now I see now I save and they
[1:01:51] said any man that confesses that Jesus
[1:01:53] is a prophet or whatever more will show
[1:01:56] out so they asked his mom and daddy hey
[1:01:57] your son's in the message what do you
[1:01:59] think about it I'm afraid he's messed
[1:02:02] up I don't know what to think about him
[1:02:04] anymore you know why they feared the
[1:02:06] Jews they saw they saw how this anger
[1:02:10] was vented toward anybody this St but
[1:02:12] Jesus Christ friends let me tell you
[1:02:15] something I thank God for a coming
[1:02:17] Rapture because I realize if it wasn't
[1:02:19] for the rapture we would be the very
[1:02:21] first ones killed in the tribulation
[1:02:23] period my goodness if the wants to get
[1:02:26] out to the foolish virgin and there's
[1:02:28] nothing compared to the elect bride can
[1:02:30] you imagine the anger he would vent
[1:02:33] towards you oh my but the Lord Jesus
[1:02:36] won't allow him Hallelujah he'll catch
[1:02:39] away his bride this able will not be
[1:02:42] killed at K's
[1:02:45] [Applause]
[1:02:47] [Music]
[1:02:50] alar watch this back to St John 8:41
[1:02:53] Jesus says you do the deed
[1:02:56] of your father yes
[1:02:58] sir then said they to
[1:03:01] him they kind of agreed together and
[1:03:03] know we'll burn his
[1:03:06] head we be not born of
[1:03:12] fornication your mother was with with
[1:03:14] child with you for her and Joseph was
[1:03:18] ever married we know your
[1:03:21] background you illegitimate thing you
[1:03:24] born in forn he only married her to save
[1:03:27] her hi she was a rotten
[1:03:30] that means you're an illegitimate
[1:03:32] excuse me for saying this way
[1:03:35] bastard that's what the Bible calls it
[1:03:38] and you out here trying to tell us
[1:03:40] something we're not born in fornication
[1:03:43] like you
[1:03:50] are we have one
[1:03:52] father even God
[1:03:57] Jesus said unto them if God were your
[1:04:02] father you would love
[1:04:04] [Applause]
[1:04:09] me may I take the words of Jesus and say
[1:04:12] that to you if God is your father no
[1:04:14] matter how much you differ with me you
[1:04:16] will love
[1:04:18] me you can't hate me and be a Christian
[1:04:21] no way now you might not agree with my
[1:04:23] ways you might not agree way I bring
[1:04:24] this that that is nothing to do with me
[1:04:27] if I'm wrong then your great love will
[1:04:29] love me and pray for
[1:04:31] me that you cannot hate me or anyone
[1:04:34] else if God is your
[1:04:36] [Applause]
[1:04:40] father if God were your father you would
[1:04:43] love me for I proceeded force and came
[1:04:46] from God neither came I of myself but he
[1:04:48] sent me why do you not understand my
[1:04:53] speech even because you cannot hear my
[1:04:56] word now Jesus is very politically
[1:05:01] correct right Jesus didn't want to hurt
[1:05:04] nobody's feelings
[1:05:08] right ye are of your
[1:05:12] father the
[1:05:14] devil oh my
[1:05:17] Lord now remember he could say that as
[1:05:21] an individual personalization of this
[1:05:24] and look right done inside of their soul
[1:05:26] and know this Truth for you and I to say
[1:05:28] this as an individual generically in a
[1:05:31] group we might can say people that do
[1:05:33] this and this and this and this but for
[1:05:35] us to look at people's soul and their
[1:05:37] Destiny and say they're of the devil
[1:05:39] none of us have that right to do
[1:05:42] so well praise the Lord now in all
[1:05:45] reality if you would have looked at me
[1:05:48] before I got saved and I would look at
[1:05:49] you before you got saved I can in all
[1:05:52] reality say your nature is of the your
[1:05:54] father the devil
[1:05:58] your body might been of a dire or Reagan
[1:06:00] or a walker or whatever more but your
[1:06:02] nature was contaminated and evil and you
[1:06:06] were by Nature children of wraths even
[1:06:09] as
[1:06:14] others I'd love if I could have been to
[1:06:16] stand there and watching the
[1:06:18] disciples you imagine how embarrassing
[1:06:21] that some of Jesus sermons must have
[1:06:22] been for
[1:06:23] them and one place Jesus said said some
[1:06:25] pretty strong words and J and then they
[1:06:27] come and said Lord don't you know you
[1:06:29] offended
[1:06:32] them and Jesus said oh I'm so sorry I
[1:06:36] probably shouldn't have said that cuz
[1:06:37] we' have got a bigger offering forgive
[1:06:39] me Jesus said ever plant my father is I
[1:06:42] planted will be rooted
[1:06:49] up now watch you are of your
[1:06:53] father the devil
[1:06:56] now Jesus is going to teach us that in
[1:06:59] this that Satan is a fallen
[1:07:03] being he will show us two great points
[1:07:07] of this about Satan in that originally
[1:07:11] he was in the
[1:07:12] truth and then he fell from the truth
[1:07:15] which is how he became a fallen being in
[1:07:18] that he went from one extreme to another
[1:07:22] Isaiah says Thou Art the anointed cherub
[1:07:25] and I have set thee so he was the
[1:07:28] protector through the Throne of God if
[1:07:31] any other inferior angel came to
[1:07:34] approach the throne of God they must
[1:07:36] come through the protector the original
[1:07:40] Archangel of God so he was the one who
[1:07:43] protected the Cherub he protected God's
[1:07:46] presence and God's Throne this was his
[1:07:49] original position but he fell from that
[1:07:52] as the protector of Truth unto the the
[1:07:55] very opposite to become the father of
[1:08:00] Lies now this is how far he went friends
[1:08:03] don't be amazed when folks backside away
[1:08:04] from the word and how in 6 months time
[1:08:06] or even less they can turn from one
[1:08:08] going this way to go that way the very
[1:08:10] thing they loved and would give their
[1:08:12] life for now they hate it vinant can't
[1:08:14] you say
[1:08:16] why now notice Jesus says you're of your
[1:08:19] father the devil you have the temper the
[1:08:22] disposition the nature the maker
[1:08:29] now not this not seed wise as far as
[1:08:32] genetic reproduction if they' have had
[1:08:35] DNA in that day they could have took
[1:08:37] their DNA and rent it all the way back
[1:08:40] to
[1:08:42] Abraham of course so could
[1:08:47] Ishmael so could
[1:08:52] Esau you are influenced by him you
[1:08:56] imitate
[1:08:59] him you are therefore his
[1:09:03] children my my I wonder what Peter was
[1:09:06] doing about
[1:09:09] now bomu you know the others that were
[1:09:12] more tender and gentle looking for a
[1:09:14] place to
[1:09:16] run these are the main men of the move
[1:09:18] of the
[1:09:19] day be like going to the religious
[1:09:22] headquarters and just saying y'all are
[1:09:23] the devil
[1:09:26] y'all doing the lust of your daddy the
[1:09:31] devil notice in St John 838 Jesus
[1:09:34] verifies it again I speak that which I
[1:09:35] have seen with my father you do that
[1:09:37] which you have seen with your father now
[1:09:39] then in verse 44 it says you're of your
[1:09:41] father the devil and the lust of your
[1:09:43] father the desires or the Wishes the
[1:09:47] lust notice how one they were you know
[1:09:49] what makes this so amazing to me if
[1:09:51] people can be so in unison with the
[1:09:53] devil that they fulfill his lusts cannot
[1:09:57] the people of God be in such Unison with
[1:10:00] the Lord God that they do his wants not
[1:10:03] lust cuz he don't have lust but if
[1:10:06] people can be in such harmony with God
[1:10:08] that what Satan lust for people actually
[1:10:12] carry out they're living out his
[1:10:16] lusts my if Sinners can do that and
[1:10:19] church people can do that to the devil I
[1:10:21] want to turn around and be the opposite
[1:10:23] and say my father let me do do your will
[1:10:26] let me do what you want me to
[1:10:32] do oh my the lust of your father notice
[1:10:37] Jesus now having the ability to look at
[1:10:39] their Destiny and their soul and see
[1:10:41] where they come from and say it
[1:10:43] prophetically the lust of your father
[1:10:46] you will
[1:10:49] do there's no question about it you're
[1:10:52] going to do
[1:10:54] it you're going to kill
[1:11:00] me as Cain killed Abel at his altar so
[1:11:05] will you kill
[1:11:07] me at my
[1:11:09] altar amen Lord
[1:11:13] Jesus you're of your father the devil
[1:11:16] and the lust of your father you will
[1:11:18] do he was a
[1:11:21] murderer from the beginning amen now who
[1:11:25] was it that he
[1:11:29] killed who did Satan kill whenever he
[1:11:33] failed and we know that the battle in
[1:11:34] heaven with the angels took place
[1:11:36] actually before the foundation of the
[1:11:37] world before the Earth was ever created
[1:11:40] the universe it expanded into the
[1:11:42] universe Satan made his fall then but he
[1:11:46] didn't kill
[1:11:48] Angels but yet Jesus calls him here and
[1:11:50] says that he was a murderer from the
[1:11:53] beginning how who who did he kill what
[1:11:56] did he do now look at this in the sense
[1:11:59] of through his son he murdered Abel but
[1:12:03] yet he was a murderer before
[1:12:05] then he was a murderer in the beginning
[1:12:09] when time had broke down out of Eternity
[1:12:13] and come down on this planet called
[1:12:15] Earth and when God had placed his
[1:12:18] children in the Garden of Eden to walk
[1:12:19] by his provision of his love and grace
[1:12:21] then Satan's desire was to be able to
[1:12:25] receive them and lead them into what
[1:12:28] death how would you like to stand before
[1:12:31] God at the white Throne judgment and
[1:12:33] answer for the death of every human
[1:12:36] being that ever lived on this
[1:12:44] Earth there was no death until Satan
[1:12:48] introduced it right now watch Jesus
[1:12:51] calls him a
[1:12:52] murderer from the beginning
[1:12:56] a murder so his first work on the earth
[1:12:59] to try to
[1:13:01] intercept Adam and Eve's position and
[1:13:04] bring them to a spot of what death not
[1:13:07] only inject himself into the human race
[1:13:09] and we know that was one of his plans
[1:13:10] but he wants to bring death he's the
[1:13:13] only one that can Institute it death is
[1:13:15] not what God wanted for
[1:13:18] anyone but Satan is the one who wanted
[1:13:21] to bring death so God actually he the
[1:13:23] Lord Jesus and he attribut Satan to
[1:13:26] being a murderer from the
[1:13:31] beginning Lord
[1:13:34] Jesus God had said in Genesis
[1:13:38] 2:7 and the day you eat thereof that day
[1:13:41] you shall
[1:13:42] die but God did not give the channel God
[1:13:45] did not give the means was not necessary
[1:13:48] all God needed to do is give a
[1:13:51] warning notice the devil deceived them
[1:13:55] first parents and they became subject to
[1:13:58] death now Jesus said he was a murderer
[1:14:01] from the beginning and Abode not in the
[1:14:04] truth now he was in the truth he Abode
[1:14:06] not in the truth so he was in the truth
[1:14:08] and chose to leave the
[1:14:12] truth God didn't make him stay no more
[1:14:15] than a will me or you if we want to
[1:14:17] leave that's entirely up to us but we
[1:14:19] will suffer the consequences if we do
[1:14:21] now he Abode not in the truth so then
[1:14:24] once he left the truth he became
[1:14:27] deprived of all of the good and godly
[1:14:30] attributes which were in him in the
[1:14:32] beginning now the the book of Isaiah
[1:14:35] tells us again that thou was created
[1:14:37] perfect till iniquity was found in thee
[1:14:39] now iniquity is not a seed of creation
[1:14:42] that God planted in him like a virus on
[1:14:44] a computer that on a certain day at
[1:14:46] 12:01 in the morning you know that thing
[1:14:48] would kick in it is not that way that
[1:14:50] would make God the author or the creator
[1:14:52] of sin but he placed Satan on on the
[1:14:55] ability of having a soul where he could
[1:14:57] choose right from wrong what he wanted
[1:14:59] to do and Satan by his own choice
[1:15:02] decided to leave the truth he decided to
[1:15:06] leave the Pavilion of God's headship he
[1:15:09] decided to leave his most noble great
[1:15:11] position and remember he was the great
[1:15:13] outstanding cherub and him and Michael
[1:15:16] broke out in a war in heaven and when he
[1:15:19] fell away from the truth and he changed
[1:15:21] from being this Godly character of a
[1:15:24] creative being which was not given to
[1:15:26] him of course by by by labor and all
[1:15:29] that that you and I have but it was
[1:15:30] given to him by creation so his power
[1:15:33] his Persona his everything that he was
[1:15:35] that God had created in him but it was
[1:15:38] created for a season created to have a
[1:15:41] terminating Point by which that point
[1:15:43] could turn and he could go the other way
[1:15:45] it was not
[1:15:47] Eternal it was not Eternal yet thou was
[1:15:51] created perfect until iniquity was found
[1:15:54] in thee oh anointed cheriff I have set
[1:15:57] thee so and yet one day he makes up in
[1:15:59] his mind this is the origination of sin
[1:16:02] it did not began in the Garden of Eden
[1:16:04] it did not begin with a serpent but sin
[1:16:06] actually began in heaven in the heart of
[1:16:09] a great
[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:15] Angel and it began with what television
[1:16:18] station was it what television station
[1:16:21] did Satan have in his heart what
[1:16:22] cigarette what fifth of whiskey uh
[1:16:25] unbelief Pride
[1:16:28] arrogance that's the base root of sin
[1:16:32] friends oh my and he had all these Godly
[1:16:36] holy things but once he chose to not
[1:16:39] abide in the truth and he moves over
[1:16:41] here into another realm the beginning or
[1:16:43] the establishment of a new kingdom than
[1:16:46] all of these good holy Godly things that
[1:16:48] were created in him for a season now
[1:16:51] they are all
[1:16:53] forfeited amen now he becomes a
[1:16:57] murderer amen now at one time he
[1:17:00] worshiped oh ad elov all these wonderful
[1:17:04] things that he did now he looks at God
[1:17:06] and say I hate
[1:17:09] you I hate
[1:17:13] you I'll get
[1:17:16] you I'll destroy you and if I can't get
[1:17:20] you I'll get your
[1:17:22] kids I hate you come on isin't it
[1:17:25] amazing people that can love you so much
[1:17:27] this week hate you so much next
[1:17:32] week you see where that Spirit comes
[1:17:34] from amen God Don't Love You hat hate
[1:17:37] you this week and then love you next
[1:17:38] week and love you next week and hate you
[1:17:39] next week as a matter of fact God don't
[1:17:41] hate God hates sin but God does not hate
[1:17:44] individuals praise the
[1:17:46] Lord now watch it then Satan Abode not
[1:17:50] in the truth so he was deprived of all
[1:17:53] good which was given to him by the
[1:17:55] creative hand of God now Jesus says he
[1:17:58] Abode not in the truth because there is
[1:18:00] no truth in him now notice though he's
[1:18:04] in the truth while he's there in the
[1:18:06] presence of God but he has a created
[1:18:08] position it's not that the allocation of
[1:18:11] that position was given to him by virtue
[1:18:14] of his own character but it was created
[1:18:17] in him we may vote a person into to be a
[1:18:19] politician of being this and that and
[1:18:20] the other and we have you know we have
[1:18:23] confidence in them that they will do
[1:18:24] this and so and thus and so but we
[1:18:26] really don't know what they'll do till
[1:18:27] they get in the position and then once
[1:18:29] they get in the position then they turn
[1:18:31] why because many of them never had that
[1:18:33] character in the first place of honesty
[1:18:35] and integrity or if they did have it
[1:18:37] they thought it was better to be corrupt
[1:18:38] instead of really being a true
[1:18:40] politician now Satan never had that
[1:18:43] Godly character within himself but
[1:18:45] Michael is different whoa glory to God
[1:18:48] many of these other angels of God the
[1:18:50] elect angels of God they were totally
[1:18:52] different they did not just have a
[1:18:54] created position and that was subject to
[1:18:56] loss don't you see how people can be
[1:18:58] saved and they can be saved for many
[1:19:00] years and wind up going to hell why
[1:19:02] because they was given something that
[1:19:04] was not part of who they were but the
[1:19:07] elect of God they're not giv something
[1:19:09] that's separate from who they are
[1:19:11] they're giving themselves Hallelujah
[1:19:13] they are giv what they are the
[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:19] word if you're given something that is
[1:19:22] not you you can lose it if you're giv
[1:19:24] something something that is not part of
[1:19:25] who you are you can lose it but if you
[1:19:27] are giv yourself how can you ever lose
[1:19:29] yourself if you're given part of your
[1:19:31] identity and the word how can that ever
[1:19:33] be taken from
[1:19:35] you
[1:19:37] Lord Now watch how Jesus strips him down
[1:19:40] I'm imagine the devil must have been
[1:19:41] fighting mad about in the middle of this
[1:19:43] verse he had never been disclosed like
[1:19:46] this
[1:19:47] before Jesus says it was a murder from
[1:19:51] the beginning and ab bod not in the
[1:19:53] truth
[1:19:54] because there is no truth in
[1:19:57] him when he speaketh a
[1:20:00] lie he speaketh of his
[1:20:04] own oh my goodness
[1:20:07] own the word own is plural and it means
[1:20:10] of the things that appropriate to him or
[1:20:13] belong to his nature so when he speaketh
[1:20:17] of a lie he speaketh of his own
[1:20:20] nature God don't deceive God Don't Lie
[1:20:24] God don't doing those things but Satan
[1:20:25] loves to why that's what he is a
[1:20:29] liar I want you to think now who is it
[1:20:31] that ties to talk you out of all your
[1:20:33] Victory a liar who is that tries to tell
[1:20:36] you God don't love you a liar who is
[1:20:38] that tried to tell you you ain't going
[1:20:39] to make the Rapture a liar and a
[1:20:40] murderer why do you even listen to him I
[1:20:43] don't understand why in the world we
[1:20:45] even give him the time of day he is a
[1:20:47] liar he is a murderer he is a deceiver
[1:20:50] he don't care for you he hates you and
[1:20:53] it's all right for you to hate the
[1:20:55] [Applause]
[1:21:03] devil oh my goodness you imagine these
[1:21:06] priests are standing there oh Lord they
[1:21:08] didn't even have blood pressure pill in
[1:21:10] them days I can't imagine how they were
[1:21:12] so
[1:21:14] upset you're of your father the devil
[1:21:17] and the lust of your father you'll do he
[1:21:19] was a murderer from the beginning and
[1:21:21] Abode not in the truth now remember he
[1:21:23] ain't just talking about the devil but
[1:21:24] is epitomizing them by describing their
[1:21:28] father you understand this is what made
[1:21:31] him so mad oh
[1:21:33] my oh he said because there's no truth
[1:21:36] in him when he speaketh a lie speaketh
[1:21:37] of his own for he is a
[1:21:46] liar a
[1:21:48] liar every lie that was ever told ow it
[1:21:51] owes its origination to Satan
[1:21:57] amen I challenge every person that's in
[1:21:59] under the sound of my voice today if you
[1:22:02] get absolutely nothing else out of what
[1:22:05] I
[1:22:06] speak get this one simple principle in
[1:22:08] your mind
[1:22:10] Satan is a
[1:22:15] liar his credibility has been known for
[1:22:18] thousands of years to be a liar walk out
[1:22:21] of these doors today with one simple
[1:22:22] thing in your heart Satan is is a
[1:22:25] liar but God is
[1:22:29] truth so why listen to a liar and not
[1:22:32] listen to
[1:22:38] truths now watch Jesus he is a liar and
[1:22:41] the father of it the first lie that was
[1:22:44] ever told was told by him every lie
[1:22:46] that's ever been told since comes from
[1:22:48] his
[1:22:49] alarp now once then as John picks this
[1:22:51] up in 1 John 3:12 he said not his
[1:22:55] Kain who was of that Wicked
[1:22:58] one and slew his brother and remember
[1:23:01] John was standing there when Jesus was
[1:23:03] preaching these words to the scribes and
[1:23:05] the Pharisees and Sadducees it was
[1:23:08] already believed among the Jews before
[1:23:10] Jesus ever preached it that Cain was of
[1:23:13] the
[1:23:16] serpent but probably the understanding
[1:23:19] wasn't quite as clear till Jesus came
[1:23:21] and really took the cover off now here
[1:23:23] John is going to go a step further as
[1:23:26] Cain who was of the wicked one and slew
[1:23:29] his brother now let's look at this word
[1:23:32] slw it means to slay Slaughter
[1:23:36] butcher to put to death by violence
[1:23:39] mortally wounded the word John used in
[1:23:41] this place properly means slaughtered
[1:23:43] and butchered by cutting the throat or
[1:23:47] the
[1:23:48] jugler notice the
[1:23:51] violence notice how he moves into this
[1:23:54] it's as if though another being has got
[1:23:57] a hold of him that's right he's not just
[1:24:00] killing him to get rid of him he is
[1:24:02] butchering him yes he is and where did
[1:24:05] this hatred start in
[1:24:10] church let's catch the setting of
[1:24:14] it they were taught by their mother and
[1:24:16] father when they come out of the Garden
[1:24:18] of Eden that it was fruit Prophet tells
[1:24:21] us that several places
[1:24:24] maybe one day Abel was out there and he
[1:24:27] was thinking about going to church and
[1:24:28] offering a sacrifice to
[1:24:30] God and he thought what should I take
[1:24:33] should I take blueberries or raspberries
[1:24:35] or apples or pomegranates or what should
[1:24:38] I take I love God was all in my heart
[1:24:42] and I want to please him amen and all of
[1:24:45] a sudden Abel was Smoked by divine
[1:24:51] revelation and the voice of God either
[1:24:53] spoke to him or showed it time en Vision
[1:24:56] abble it wasn't
[1:25:00] apples you were born in your mother's
[1:25:03] Blood by your father's
[1:25:06] blood it was sex
[1:25:12] able but that's not what they've taught
[1:25:15] you
[1:25:17] wrong they haven't told you all the
[1:25:19] truth
[1:25:20] Abel boy you folks are quiet
[1:25:24] don't you remember that sermon I
[1:25:25] preached many many years ago my father
[1:25:27] taught me
[1:25:33] wrong oh
[1:25:36] God but Lord
[1:25:38] if so you me I I've got I've got to take
[1:25:42] this this lamb to
[1:25:46] church but when I want past my
[1:25:49] mama and my daddy they'll know I know
[1:25:54] yeah
[1:25:59] so you imagine imagine Adam and Eve in
[1:26:02] church and they're
[1:26:03] worshiping praising
[1:26:07] God here
[1:26:09] comes
[1:26:11] Abel which Eve named him
[1:26:17] Abel and a lesser name that she named
[1:26:19] Cain she named Cain acquisition
[1:26:23] appointed one I've got from the Lord an
[1:26:26] able as
[1:26:27] worthless or one of not as much
[1:26:30] value so naturally he wouldn't have much
[1:26:32] sway
[1:26:34] anyhow but here he comes to church yes
[1:26:39] and God revealed to him get a grape vine
[1:26:41] and tie around its neck so he gets the
[1:26:45] grap Vine and he ties around the Lamb's
[1:26:47] neck and Yuri comes dragging it to
[1:26:50] church and Eve looks at Adam and Adam
[1:26:52] looks at did you tell him no I never
[1:26:54] told
[1:26:56] him how did he know to get a
[1:27:00] lamb he wasn't there that day when God
[1:27:02] come down and kill a lamb and but are
[1:27:04] you sure you didn't tell him I promise I
[1:27:06] never told him
[1:27:08] nothing God says I told
[1:27:11] [Applause]
[1:27:16] him I told him he's mine I'm obligated
[1:27:21] to tell him
[1:27:28] so here he comes that little
[1:27:31] [Music]
[1:27:36] L here's Kane waiting his
[1:27:39] turn he has all of his fruits his
[1:27:41] vegetables he's labored he's sincerely
[1:27:44] labored over and worked over here comes
[1:27:47] Abel tears out of his
[1:27:50] eyes oh
[1:27:52] Jehovah Jehovah
[1:27:57] Adam and Eve stand there mix
[1:27:59] emotions how are we going to explain
[1:28:01] this I don't have no idea how did he
[1:28:05] found out I don't know it must have been
[1:28:07] God told
[1:28:10] him Lord since it was only me and you
[1:28:13] and God there had to be
[1:28:18] God but Abel was so caught up in the
[1:28:21] Revelation he didn't pay no attention to
[1:28:22] the whispers
[1:28:24] [Applause]
[1:28:29] so by Revelation he reaches down builds
[1:28:33] his alar grabs a little
[1:28:35] lamp lays it down on the
[1:28:38] alar I
[1:28:41] don't
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:45] eloh
[1:28:48] eloh yah oh yah
[1:28:55] takes the sharp
[1:29:04] [Music]
[1:29:07] Rock the hot blood spewing out of his
[1:29:10] neck all over his hands yeah his
[1:29:14] arms the Lamb's wo bathed in
[1:29:20] Blood and over here stands his half
[1:29:23] brother
[1:29:24] yes you smart
[1:29:28] ell no you think you're something don't
[1:29:32] you why can't you just be like everybody
[1:29:35] else why do you always have to be so
[1:29:44] different he stands there and say I
[1:29:47] don't
[1:29:48] know Elohim
[1:29:51] ad and all of a sudden
[1:29:54] inspiration strikes him and he feels to
[1:29:56] move back and give a little space and
[1:30:00] when he
[1:30:04] does a pillar of fire comes down and
[1:30:07] Strikes the altar burns up the
[1:30:13] sacrifice goes back up into
[1:30:16] heaven I don't I I don't
[1:30:20] I I don't I hallu
[1:30:26] he just backs over and sits down weeps
[1:30:31] shakes Quivers
[1:30:34] amen he heard his lamb dying speaking in
[1:30:37] tongues he still got that blood on him
[1:30:40] he smells it physically it's almost
[1:30:41] making him
[1:30:42] sick but it isn't that that makes him
[1:30:45] sick it's the acknowledgement of his sin
[1:30:48] he was born after the fall
[1:30:55] but now it's kan's
[1:30:57] turn and he comes to church with an
[1:31:00] attitude he don't like the music this is
[1:31:03] too loud he don't like this he don't
[1:31:04] like that bless God I'm they fixing to
[1:31:06] run the church my way I'm fixing to bust
[1:31:08] it
[1:31:09] [Music]
[1:31:14] up but you imagine he's anger he's hat
[1:31:17] hated hating
[1:31:19] able but he comes and he brings all of
[1:31:22] his fruits
[1:31:24] he comes down he kind of has a change
[1:31:26] you know like a hypocrite does kind of
[1:31:28] changes and oh he's mow sincere and so
[1:31:32] much
[1:31:34] drama lays the cantaloupes here and the
[1:31:36] Watermelons there and the pomegranates
[1:31:38] and the apples and the lies and the
[1:31:41] flowers and my just takes so much time
[1:31:45] able
[1:31:51] still God
[1:31:54] thank
[1:31:54] [Music]
[1:31:56] you thank
[1:31:58] you praise the
[1:32:00] Lord but that Revelation also showed him
[1:32:03] who his half brother
[1:32:06] was for the first time in his life now
[1:32:09] he understands why he looks so different
[1:32:12] and acts so different and has a
[1:32:14] different
[1:32:16] temperament
[1:32:19] amen but Cain just kind of lays it aside
[1:32:22] for a little bit goes his ritual do all
[1:32:25] the things that he
[1:32:27] does praise calls on adoni Elohim
[1:32:30] Jehovah all these great terms that he
[1:32:33] was taught since a
[1:32:34] child and he waits for the pit of fire
[1:32:38] but there's no
[1:32:40] move no move of
[1:32:42] God no peep from Heaven no matter no
[1:32:46] sound no wind
[1:32:49] nothing so he has to walk away from
[1:32:51] church without divine
[1:32:56] Vindication what he
[1:32:58] does you imagine looking at Abel
[1:33:03] you you had to show off didn't you
[1:33:06] little smart
[1:33:10] Alec God come to him later and said Cain
[1:33:14] what's wrong yes right if thou doest
[1:33:17] well will not thou be
[1:33:19] accepted if not sin crouth at the door
[1:33:24] yes that's a wild Savage
[1:33:29] Beast the Jews say that Cain spoke to
[1:33:32] Abel a few weeks
[1:33:35] thereafter and said he said let's go out
[1:33:37] into the field that we may
[1:33:41] talk and as he pulled him out into the
[1:33:43] field then his Vengeance begin to grow
[1:33:46] and his hatred begin to
[1:33:49] boil and he picks up a rock first and
[1:33:53] hits him in the
[1:33:54] head addles him then he takes another
[1:33:59] and he takes one with a sharp edge and
[1:34:02] cuts his throat acting out what he saw
[1:34:05] able do to his
[1:34:09] lamb he
[1:34:11] butchered he butchered his
[1:34:15] brother I hope you can receive it right
[1:34:18] the butcher already started on his altar
[1:34:25] in
[1:34:28] church Lord Jesus let me close not as
[1:34:33] Cain who was of the wicked one and slew
[1:34:35] his brother and wherefore slew he him
[1:34:39] what was the cause what was the reason
[1:34:40] what was the
[1:34:43] occasion John answers
[1:34:45] himself because his own
[1:34:48] Works were
[1:34:50] evil and his brothers
[1:34:55] righteous let me read to you a couple of
[1:34:57] commentators so you'll see we're not the
[1:34:59] only strange ones down through time that
[1:35:01] have believe some of these things his
[1:35:03] work the sacrifice which he offered up
[1:35:05] which though it was not evil to the
[1:35:07] matter and substance yet was so being
[1:35:09] being offered by an evil mind with a
[1:35:11] hypocritical heart and without faith in
[1:35:14] the sacrifice of Christ was unacceptable
[1:35:16] to God John Gil
[1:35:21] 1684 and wherefor slew he him what could
[1:35:24] induce a brother to dip his hands into
[1:35:26] his brother's blood when his brother was
[1:35:28] righteous and he was wicked and the seed
[1:35:30] of the wicked one which was in him and
[1:35:32] induced him to destroy his brother
[1:35:35] because the seed of God the divine
[1:35:38] nature was found in
[1:35:41] him Adam
[1:35:43] Clark the difference between Cain's
[1:35:45] offering and Abel's offering was faith
[1:35:47] and faith is always based on the
[1:35:50] revelation of God it seems clear that
[1:35:53] God God must have given definite
[1:35:55] instructions concerning how he was to be
[1:35:57] worshiped and Cain rejected God's word
[1:36:00] and decided to Worship in his own way
[1:36:03] that shows his relationship to Satan for
[1:36:08] Satan is always interested in turning
[1:36:10] people away from the revealed will of
[1:36:12] God the devil's ye hath God said Genesis
[1:36:15] 3:1 was the beginning of trouble for
[1:36:17] king's
[1:36:18] parents yeah and all of mankind we are
[1:36:22] not told by what out sign the Lord
[1:36:24] accepted Abel's sacrifice and rejected
[1:36:26] Caines it may be that he sent fire from
[1:36:29] heaven to consume Abel's sacrifice of an
[1:36:33] animal and its blood but we are told the
[1:36:37] results Abel went away from the altar
[1:36:39] with God's witness of Acceptance in his
[1:36:42] heart Lord Jesus this is what we want
[1:36:45] but Cain went away angry and
[1:36:46] disappointed but God warned Kain that
[1:36:49] sin was crouching at the door like a
[1:36:51] dangerous beast but promise if Cain
[1:36:53] would obey God like Abel did he would
[1:36:55] enjoy peace instead of heeding God's
[1:36:58] warning Cain listen to Satan's voice and
[1:37:01] plotted to kill his brother out of what
[1:37:05] hatred his Envy was turned to anger and
[1:37:08] hatred he knew that he was evil and that
[1:37:10] his brother was righteous rather than
[1:37:12] repent as God commanded him to do he
[1:37:14] decided to destroy his brother centuries
[1:37:16] later the Pharisees did the same thing
[1:37:19] to Jesus and Jesus called them two
[1:37:21] children of the devil Satan is the
[1:37:24] prince of this world and he controls it
[1:37:26] through murder and lies how horrible to
[1:37:29] live on the same level as Satan the
[1:37:31] Bible Exposition
[1:37:34] commentary Matthew pool 1600s and when
[1:37:37] he was more devil likee than such a
[1:37:40] temper as C's was whose hatred was of
[1:37:43] his brother break out into actual murder
[1:37:45] upon no other account because his
[1:37:47] brother was better than he which showed
[1:37:49] him to be of the wicked one of the
[1:37:52] serpent seed
[1:37:58] I plan on seeing brother Matthew P in
[1:38:00] the
[1:38:09] Rapture
[1:38:11] Cain love not as
[1:38:13] Cain who s he could love God but he
[1:38:17] could hate his brother yes sir and be
[1:38:21] acceptable how can a man say he loves
[1:38:24] God whom he has not seen and hate his
[1:38:29] brother whom he has
[1:38:31] seen Stand
[1:38:46] Together 1 John
[1:38:49] 3:14 we
[1:38:51] know that we have pass pass from Death
[1:38:54] un
[1:38:55] life because we love the
[1:38:59] Brethren he that loveth not his brother
[1:39:03] Abid
[1:39:05] Us in
[1:39:07] death he that love us not his
[1:39:10] brother abideth in
[1:39:13] death this is my affirmation out of this
[1:39:16] I will not hate
[1:39:21] people I will hate sin I will hate wrong
[1:39:24] and I will stand against it till the day
[1:39:25] I die but I will hate no
[1:39:31] individuals though they differ with me
[1:39:33] as far as the East is from the West I
[1:39:36] will even watch and
[1:39:38] guard the way I turn my
[1:39:41] dislike you know brother R said it this
[1:39:43] way said you might say I sure don't like
[1:39:47] brother Neville I sure don't like this
[1:39:49] brother or that brother he said but you
[1:39:51] let something happen to that brother
[1:39:53] amen and he said it breaks your
[1:39:56] heart right cuz you stood at the table
[1:39:59] of the Lord together he said here and
[1:40:01] took communion and broke bread and that
[1:40:03] is your brother right to me that is the
[1:40:06] balance perfect love will never make all
[1:40:08] of us love one another's ways I don't
[1:40:11] even like all my own ways how am I going
[1:40:13] to like
[1:40:14] yours come on be honest you're deceived
[1:40:16] if you like all your
[1:40:18] ways if you think everything about you
[1:40:21] is so Crist out you need to you need to
[1:40:22] come back up and let let me pray for
[1:40:24] you we don't like our own ways many of
[1:40:26] them much less other people's
[1:40:28] ways but perfect love helps us to look
[1:40:32] beyond that and look at what God is
[1:40:34] doing and not say Reika to that brother
[1:40:37] or thou fool you're not even saved you
[1:40:39] don't even have the Holy GH you're not
[1:40:40] even part of this message friend we're
[1:40:42] saying dangerous stuff amen and the
[1:40:45] sarcasm that goes into and that that
[1:40:47] spirit that can get on us can do just
[1:40:49] like it did John it'll go right back to
[1:40:50] the word you want us to call fire down
[1:40:51] to Heaven that's what Elijah done
[1:40:54] uhoh what have we
[1:40:56] done we've done some of the same things
[1:40:58] Jesus
[1:40:59] did we've turned and called people
[1:41:01] you're your father the
[1:41:03] devil that's what Jesus said bless God I
[1:41:05] can do the same thing not unless you
[1:41:07] know exactly that they
[1:41:10] are you see what we've
[1:41:13] done and enmity and anger and hatred and
[1:41:16] we've hid behind scriptural
[1:41:22] examples for TR to call a man a
[1:41:24] senseless fool and say God has done
[1:41:27] nothing in your life you know nothing
[1:41:29] about
[1:41:31] God but I wonder what God would say
[1:41:33] about that
[1:41:35] man God might have up a construction
[1:41:37] sign on the outside under
[1:41:41] construction Chief Architect God chief
[1:41:43] designer God Chief Builder
[1:41:46] God you're ripping down the under
[1:41:48] construction sign you say you're going
[1:41:49] to hell and God said no he ain't he's
[1:41:52] mine he may not be where I want him to
[1:41:54] be but he's on his way and I'm going to
[1:41:56] fulfill
[1:42:00] it I'm convinced most of us would be so
[1:42:02] much better off if we'd do probably
[1:42:05] about 98% less
[1:42:09] talking be swift to hear slow to speak
[1:42:12] and slow to
[1:42:13] rest I'm figuring out more and more and
[1:42:16] more why brother B said the apostles
[1:42:17] were men a few
[1:42:20] words how many foolish things have I
[1:42:23] said said how many foolish things have
[1:42:25] you
[1:42:26] said well some of you nodded I guess the
[1:42:28] rest of you thought all of yours was
[1:42:31] okay God help us am God help
[1:42:35] us how many wants help
[1:42:38] today me
[1:42:40] too let's pray
[1:42:44] together Lord
[1:42:47] Jesus these are serious matters
[1:42:50] Lord It's matters of the heart
[1:42:55] it's even more serious Lord than
[1:42:57] physical
[1:42:58] needs a person may be here today with
[1:43:00] something devastating going on their
[1:43:02] body and we could pray for them they
[1:43:03] could be healed and yet next week Satan
[1:43:05] would attack them in another way so they
[1:43:08] can get healed and get sick and get
[1:43:09] healed and get sick but if we can ever
[1:43:12] move into that realm of
[1:43:14] Eternity there's no turning back we're
[1:43:17] yours
[1:43:19] forever doesn't mean that we
[1:43:21] automatically go into that full statue
[1:43:24] but it means we're on our way and
[1:43:26] there'll be no turning
[1:43:28] back lord I pray you'd forgive me
[1:43:32] today no doubt I have said in
[1:43:34] my short span of life that I've been
[1:43:37] allowed to live on this
[1:43:39] Earth no doubt I have said some very
[1:43:42] foolish
[1:43:43] things no doubt I have charged people
[1:43:46] wrong no doubt I've presented truths
[1:43:49] even in the wrong
[1:43:51] way I ask you to forgive
[1:43:55] me for anything that I have
[1:43:58] misrepresented or said about any
[1:44:01] person forgive me
[1:44:04] Lord help us I pray Lord Jesus each of
[1:44:08] us to be
[1:44:10] more more aware of what we say how we
[1:44:15] say it how it comes out of our
[1:44:18] mouths and to know that out of the heart
[1:44:20] you said out of the heart precedes
[1:44:24] murder and
[1:44:26] adultery
[1:44:28] fornications all these things it begins
[1:44:31] in the secrets of the
[1:44:34] Heart Lord search each of us from the
[1:44:37] front to the
[1:44:39] back may your Holy Spirit I
[1:44:42] pray bring us face to face with
[1:44:46] ourselves if there's anybody here today
[1:44:48] that hates
[1:44:49] anyone deliver them Lord
[1:44:55] but I know in order for us to be
[1:44:57] delivered we have to be willing to be
[1:45:00] delivered help us to understand maybe
[1:45:03] the mere conception of what we think
[1:45:05] hatred is many of us would think it'd be
[1:45:08] a man going in somebody else's house and
[1:45:10] killing them or a man raping a woman or
[1:45:12] killing a child or running over someone
[1:45:14] that that's the extremity of
[1:45:16] it but yet whenever John chose the Greek
[1:45:19] word to use for hatred a man that
[1:45:21] doesn't love his brother
[1:45:23] he chose a compound word which meant
[1:45:26] just didn't love them and then the
[1:45:29] extremity of that one that would try to
[1:45:31] do them character damage or bodily
[1:45:35] damage help us to see Lord God when we
[1:45:38] don't love someone that is put under the
[1:45:41] same category as
[1:45:43] hate and we know love has degrees
[1:45:47] there's no way we're going to look at
[1:45:48] the world out here and the way they live
[1:45:50] and act and do and love them with the
[1:45:52] same degree of love that we will love
[1:45:55] saints of
[1:45:57] God and yet Lord I took car as I was
[1:45:59] going home last
[1:46:00] night it's amazing that sometimes we can
[1:46:03] get
[1:46:04] along better was people of the world
[1:46:06] than we people of the
[1:46:09] faith and she said yeah I can see
[1:46:12] that cuz them we saying well they don't
[1:46:16] know no difference they hurt us they do
[1:46:17] us wrong whatever and we're more
[1:46:18] forgiving sometimes of them than we are
[1:46:20] our
[1:46:21] brothers but Lord Jesus we know the real
[1:46:24] test of
[1:46:25] Christianity is herein shall men know
[1:46:27] that you are my
[1:46:29] disciples not because you love the world
[1:46:32] not because you're understanding with
[1:46:33] Sinners but because you love your
[1:46:36] brothers you knew what you were saying
[1:46:39] you knew that'd be one of the greatest
[1:46:41] challenges that would face us as human
[1:46:43] beings totally impossible for us to
[1:46:45] achieve to it but what's impossible with
[1:46:48] us is possible with
[1:46:51] you help each of us today
[1:46:54] Lord can we just raise our hands
[1:46:57] children we have our hands raised Lord
[1:46:59] God in your
[1:47:00] presence I say to you today Lord and I'm
[1:47:03] not ashamed to say it before these
[1:47:04] people and people that are hear this
[1:47:06] service all different parts of the world
[1:47:08] I'm not ashamed to say I need a greater
[1:47:11] depth of Love Lord I need to grow I need
[1:47:14] to grow I don't want to just grow and
[1:47:16] understanding of deep things I want to
[1:47:18] grow in love
[1:47:20] Lord I don't want to hate I've never
[1:47:23] been a violent mean type of a person
[1:47:25] anyway but Lord a person can be a very
[1:47:28] humble so-called thought to be person
[1:47:31] and still Harbor hatred in their heart
[1:47:33] which is the beding ground or the cradle
[1:47:35] for murder help us Lord Jesus if a man
[1:47:38] can look on a woman and lust after her
[1:47:40] and commit adultery in her heart yet
[1:47:42] never touch her his wife may never know
[1:47:44] it the woman's husband may never know it
[1:47:46] nobody ever know it but you know it and
[1:47:50] you attribute it to being adultery in
[1:47:51] his heart then a person can hate from
[1:47:54] their heart and really have the same
[1:47:56] influence to murder in their heart
[1:48:00] nobody might not know it but you know it
[1:48:02] Lord search our hearts search our hearts
[1:48:06] for anything that's contrary Lord no
[1:48:09] wonder David said it so many many years
[1:48:11] ago his prayer and Psalms about his
[1:48:14] secret
[1:48:15] sins Lord Jesus it's not all the time
[1:48:18] conniving and sneaking around and hiding
[1:48:20] behind closed doors necessarily but it's
[1:48:22] those things that's there that nobody
[1:48:24] knows but us and you Lord
[1:48:28] Jesus no wonder this is the
[1:48:31] Capstone no wonder this is the finale of
[1:48:34] the whole
[1:48:36] thing love Hallelujah Lord

[1:52:42] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:52:43] perish but should have everlasting
[1:52:46] life 1 John
[1:52:49] 3:16 hereby perceive we the love of God
[1:52:52] because laid down his life for us we
[1:52:55] ought to lay down our lives for the
[1:52:58] Brethren John 3:16 was said before the

[1:53:56] when they might be contaminated
[1:53:58] themselves and they risk their own life
[1:54:00] to try to save
[1:54:01] Humanity why they really called to do
[1:54:04] that a captain it is part of his
[1:54:07] endowment and his responsibility that he
[1:54:10] will stay on that ship if he's the very
