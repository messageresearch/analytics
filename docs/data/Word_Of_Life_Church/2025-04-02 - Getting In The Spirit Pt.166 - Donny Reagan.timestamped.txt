[34:59] somebody um I'm still growing of course
[35:02] and hope one day man I just listen to
[35:05] God's gifts and I think it isn't God
[35:08] amazing how he gifts people and
[35:10] preachers and it's just um it's just
[35:14] awesome to me the way that the Lord does
[35:16] and preachers will study something and
[35:18] you think I just read that yeah so I
[35:22] realize there's preachers around the
[35:23] message that feel like they have the
[35:25] ultimate understanding of everything
[35:28] um and apparently they never listen to
[35:29] nobody else other than their s you know
[35:33] but it's just it's just absolutely
[35:35] amazes me brother Dan daa used to say
[35:37] that God's gifts are like Lifesavers
[35:41] they come in all different
[35:43] flavors and whenever you hear the
[35:45] diversity of the way that God uses men
[35:47] you just realize it's amazing what he
[35:49] does and you know why he does it for
[35:52] us for us we're blessed aren't we and I
[35:57] can I can tell you right now brother
[35:58] David and brother Danny both enjoyed
[36:00] being here brother Danny told me several
[36:02] times and so did Brother David how they
[36:05] sort of enjoyed being here at the church
[36:07] of course brother David's been here
[36:09] different times through the years but
[36:10] this is Brother Danny's first time and
[36:13] he just said over and over again how
[36:16] much he enjoyed being here and thank you
[36:20] for that I told him I said well I've
[36:21] tried my best to convey it to the people
[36:25] that they have a great part to play and
[36:27] how any service goes and he said you
[36:30] have done it well so I hope I
[36:35] have Genesis
[36:40] 24:17 and the servant ran to meet
[36:44] her and said let me I pray
[36:47] thee drink a little water of thy
[36:51] picture and she said drink my
[36:56] Lord and she she hasted and let down her
[36:59] picture upon her hand so now it was upon
[37:04] her shoulder and she lets it down upon
[37:07] her hand as a form of custom
[37:11] complimentary custom not set it on the
[37:14] ground well if you want it get it but it
[37:16] was a mannerism in the way that she
[37:19] actually even gave him to drink now
[37:22] remember he's watching every
[37:24] move listening to every word
[37:28] how would you like to have had this
[37:30] responsibility to pick a bride for the
[37:34] prince
[37:38] Isaac and when you took her home it made
[37:40] no difference what she looked like 382
[37:44] lb or 28 lbs whatever you took home was
[37:49] who he's going to
[37:51] marry that's a tough responsibility so
[37:54] he's watching he's waiting he's
[37:58] listening every little move he'd watch
[38:00] her
[38:02] mannerism now
[38:04] watch in verse
[38:06] 19 and when she had done giving him
[38:10] drink she said I will draw water for thy
[38:15] camels
[38:16] also until they have done drinking now
[38:19] remember this is what he told the Lord
[38:20] in
[38:21] prayer and she
[38:24] hasted and emptied her picture into the
[38:28] trough and ran again onto the well to
[38:33] draw water and Drew for all his camels
[38:39] remember how many trips it was
[38:45] 60
[38:47] 60 not to a whale with a garden hose
[38:50] there but a well that was dug down in
[38:53] the earth going down
[38:55] steps up and down the them steps for at
[38:59] least 60 times with haste now remember
[39:04] he's
[39:05] watching you understand that the Lord is
[39:08] watching
[39:10] us he watches us when we come to church
[39:13] the angels of God watch how we
[39:16] participate they watch how we live they
[39:19] watch how we treat people whether good
[39:21] or bad they're
[39:23] watching she hasted and emptied her
[39:26] picture into the trough and ran again
[39:27] into the well to draw water and Drew for
[39:30] all his camels now listen what he does
[39:35] and the man
[39:38] wondering
[39:40] wondering at her held his
[39:44] peace so he's wondering and
[39:48] pondering is this
[39:50] her is this the answer to my
[39:54] prayer to Whit whether the Lord
[39:57] had made his journey prosperous or
[40:02] not I mean do that to be remembered
[40:04] tonight as we
[40:07] pray Harry and I have a family member
[40:12] back in Kentucky that would' like for
[40:14] you to remember tonight you don't need
[40:16] to know all the details necessarily but
[40:19] just that God God will move we um
[40:23] certainly have different ones in our
[40:25] church that are sick and still dealing
[40:26] with different things so we want to pray
[40:28] for them and let's pray for the word
[40:31] pray for me tonight if you would the
[40:32] Lord will help

[40:42] soul as the angel of
[40:45] God spoke to Rebecca that day every
[40:52] member of the bride of Christ around the
[40:55] world
[40:57] will hear from the angel of
[41:02] God they will feel a
[41:05] pull from another
[41:08] world they will hear a voice they will
[41:11] hear the
[41:12] word they will identify with something
[41:17] that's even beyond their Earthly
[41:20] family they will be misunderstood by the
[41:23] reaction to that voice it will change
[41:27] their
[41:28] lives and one day their
[41:31] bodies we are privileged blessed people

[42:05] just want to thank you tonight we want
[42:08] to Rejoice Lord Jesus that our brother
[42:11] Ron father heard this great report and
[42:16] the the first word that he said that the
[42:18] doctor was saying as he walked through
[42:20] the door was Miracle it's a
[42:25] miracle well that's our God he's a
[42:28] miracle working God so father take the
[42:32] service tonight you see our needs our
[42:35] desires speak to us I pray father in the
[42:39] name of Jesus and the Saints said amen
[42:43] amen God bless you you may be seated
[42:45] let's let's read again there verse verse
[42:49] 21 and the man wondering at her held his
[42:55] peace
[42:57] so he doesn't say
[42:59] anything he doesn't give her any
[43:03] hints any clues moving this way do this
[43:09] go that way do this in order to be
[43:13] chosen respond like this and act this
[43:17] certain way he's not saying any of that
[43:21] but what he's doing is watching and
[43:24] observing you know that's a very good
[43:26] thing for all all of us to do in life
[43:28] you're looking for a mate that's what
[43:30] you need to do you need to watch them
[43:33] see how they do about the word see how
[43:36] they do in church see how they respond
[43:39] to the things of God how they respond to
[43:42] other people you don't have to really
[43:43] say a whole lot a lot of times all you
[43:45] got to do is just watch people and we
[43:48] are creatures of habit we do habitual
[43:51] things over and over again and it's the
[43:54] unconscious things that I watch that
[43:58] tells me about people really who they
[44:02] are not whenever they're you know
[44:04] they're watching their p's and q's as we
[44:06] say and they know you're watching them
[44:09] then most all of us are going to be on
[44:11] our best behavior then that's not really
[44:13] what I want to see I want to see what
[44:16] they are under stress I want to see what
[44:19] they are just by their natural reaction
[44:23] whenever they don't think anybody else
[44:25] is watching them now this is what he's
[44:28] doing now he knows that Abraham has
[44:32] given him this great sacred charge but
[44:36] he cannot tell her yet so the mystery
[44:41] must be acted out on her part and the
[44:45] angel of God wants her to act it out but
[44:50] he wants it to be by natural behavior so
[44:54] he didn't give her a book and just say
[44:56] now look do this way dress that way act
[44:59] this Bend this way curtsy bow your head
[45:02] do a certain certain thing but he wants
[45:04] her just to be as she is the type of
[45:08] person that she is so the man wondering
[45:12] at her so what what do you think that he
[45:16] observed her courteous Behavior now she
[45:20] didn't know him from The Man in the Moon
[45:22] as we say first time she had ever seen
[45:24] him he could have been a robber he could
[45:26] have been a see she could tell by the
[45:29] camels by the substance that she could
[45:31] see slave servants there with him that
[45:34] at least he represented someone of great
[45:38] importance of someone of substance that
[45:41] she could tell but she didn't know
[45:44] whether he was a good man sincere man
[45:46] honest man but she treated him and that
[45:50] which was natural to her and her
[45:53] behavior which was what not curious I
[45:57] not mean not evil spirited but courteous
[46:01] and kind you know myself I I think that
[46:04] courteous can be handed down to people
[46:07] that don't even deserve it I think
[46:09] kindness can be handed to people that in
[46:12] reality we think they don't even deserve
[46:14] my kindness but you know what the way I
[46:16] look at it if I'm kind and I'm I'm
[46:19] mild-tempered and whatever more I'm not
[46:21] just going to express that to kind
[46:23] people that's who I am so that's what
[46:26] I'm I'm going to be was no matter who I
[46:28] deal with you understand now watch what
[46:31] he's looking for and remember this great
[46:34] charge now that Abraham is sending him
[46:37] out there and he's prayed a prayer and
[46:40] he's waiting to see if God has made the
[46:43] prayer manifest cuz he doesn't know just
[46:47] yet now she's reacted to what he prayed
[46:51] but he still wants to see that her
[46:53] character matches what he else had as
[46:57] for so he watches her kindness her
[47:01] courteousness and to a stranger her
[47:04] humility in the way that she would go
[47:07] down and get the water the way she would
[47:09] come back up excuse me and the way that
[47:12] she would bow down like this and hand
[47:15] the man on her hand so she'd take the
[47:17] bottom of the picture in this part of
[47:20] her hand like this and take the other
[47:22] end over this way and make it instead of
[47:24] setting it down on the ground and say
[47:26] you get if you want against yourself but
[47:28] she would actually serve him the water
[47:32] as if though he was a great person a
[47:36] person of renown because little did she
[47:40] know he really was so her condens now
[47:45] watch her condens that she took upon
[47:49] herself her Readiness and her ability to
[47:54] be able to serve someone that that she
[47:57] did not know as I read about a certain
[48:01] black man that went into a hotel and he
[48:05] went up to the front desk and he asked
[48:08] this lady behind the desk if she had any
[48:12] rooms and she said um no sir we don't
[48:14] and I don't have time for you and she
[48:17] was quite rude to the man and uh he he
[48:20] gave her a little bit of Grace and said
[48:22] well would you mind checking again just
[48:24] to make sure I told you we do not have
[48:28] any
[48:29] rooms so the man pulls out his ID and
[48:33] shows her he's the owner of the
[48:39] hotel now he did not come in on a
[48:42] limousine he was just dressed in casual
[48:45] looking clothes you know it's no wonder
[48:48] that the Bible tells us to be careful
[48:51] how we treat people because sometimes
[48:54] we're Entertaining Angels
[48:58] unawares now notice how this comes
[49:02] natural to Rebecca and elaser must have
[49:06] been a pretty good reader of human
[49:08] character so he he sees her Readiness
[49:12] and her diligence and all this now is
[49:16] taking I want you to notice that nothing
[49:18] about her shape her form her figure how
[49:24] pretty she was her hair was either
[49:27] blonde or black her eyes were blue or
[49:30] brown or Hazel none of that is even
[49:34] mentioned now wouldn't he want the most
[49:37] beautiful woman in the land the most
[49:39] beautiful woman in the land might not be
[49:42] the best woman in the land come on but
[49:45] what is he noticing he's noticing these
[49:49] attitudes that she has and would she
[49:53] make his master an ID ideal wife now
[49:59] that's the thing that true men of God
[50:02] are really called for to minister to the
[50:05] bride now listen to me children and
[50:07] don't misunderstand what I'm going to
[50:08] say I feel like it is very important for
[50:12] us as the people of God to listen to the
[50:15] tapes of the Prophet messenger for us to
[50:18] read the books for us to study and I
[50:21] believe if you really believe the
[50:22] message of the hour that there's
[50:24] something in you that you want to to do
[50:27] that but you realize also reading and
[50:30] listening to tapes is not enough you
[50:33] must have your own walk with God going
[50:37] to church is not enough saying brother
[50:40] Donnie is my pastor brother Danny is my
[50:43] pastor Brother David that's not enough
[50:46] we want to have a character and traits
[50:50] about our Behavior s days a week when
[50:54] we're out of church in Church on the
[50:57] parking lot you know wherever we are at
[50:59] Walmart to where the Holy Ghost can
[51:02] watch us where we are and when we are by
[51:06] ourself we act exactly the same way we
[51:09] don't take our phone out and go to
[51:11] places we shouldn't go on that phone
[51:14] when we're by oursel and act totally
[51:16] different when our wife is around or
[51:19] brother Donnie would be there or you
[51:21] know one of the deacons would be there
[51:23] because that's not Who We Are oh my I'm
[51:27] going to have the type of behavior that
[51:30] the spirit of God can make the report
[51:34] about me daily that I have behaved
[51:38] myself since the special meetings now
[51:41] and the last one when we close out on
[51:43] Sunday that whenever we got back to our
[51:45] regular routine on Monday as probably a
[51:47] lot of us did and then on Tuesday and on
[51:50] on today that the spirit of God could
[51:53] report the same thing about me Monday
[51:56] Tuesday and Wednesday as he did while
[51:58] the special meetings were going on
[52:01] because I'm not going to act more
[52:04] special when special meetings are going
[52:06] on because I believe I'm a special
[52:09] person anyway so if I believe that I'm
[52:13] specially called of God you believe you
[52:15] are then you know what I believe I
[52:18] should act special every day of my life
[52:21] I'm not just going to act special when
[52:23] special meetings are going on I'm going
[52:25] to act special every day that I live
[52:28] well praise the Lord now watch notice
[52:31] that he must have noticed something
[52:34] about how quick she was you notice how
[52:37] that when Moses writes this many years
[52:40] later that he talks about the adjectives
[52:43] and the adverbs that describes how fast
[52:46] she moved quickly she hastened she ran
[52:51] notice this about her behavior so this
[52:55] is what is also sticking out so she
[52:59] didn't do a Google search on this guy
[53:02] and see if there was some type of a scam
[53:05] warning that a guy with a bunch of
[53:07] camels is going from whale to wh and
[53:10] trying to dke people so everybody watch
[53:13] your virgin daughters because there's a
[53:16] scam they're tell telling that this
[53:19] guy's going around well she had no way
[53:20] of checking that out she did know you
[53:23] know okay let me pray about this and
[53:24] I'll come back in three days and I'll
[53:26] let you know but immediately she
[53:29] responded now we know why that she did
[53:33] this it was not because that she so much
[53:38] had a great discernment of character it
[53:40] was not so much that she had the word to
[53:43] go by remember there was no written word
[53:48] there was not even an oracle from God
[53:53] given to them in padan har there was no
[53:57] message book that had been sent over
[54:00] there for her to identify with this is
[54:03] why God sent her an
[54:05] angel now he was trying to identify by
[54:09] her
[54:11] expressions and that because he had
[54:13] placed a token before God and what he
[54:17] wants to see is the counterpart of that
[54:21] token the identification of those traits
[54:25] to see was it in her before he said
[54:30] anything about it now he's trusting the
[54:32] Providence of God so the servant was
[54:37] evaluating Rebecca just very nonchalant
[54:40] no doubt and just watching and beholding
[54:42] not saying anything to see if she would
[54:45] make his master a good wife now notice
[54:49] in verse 22 and it came to pass as the
[54:52] camels had done drinking now watch that
[54:56] that the man took a golden
[54:59] earring of half a shekele
[55:03] weight and two
[55:05] bracelets for her hands of 10 shackles
[55:10] weight of
[55:12] gold now no preaching has been done no
[55:17] signs have been done but the gift goes
[55:22] to working on
[55:24] her after she has displayed her female
[55:29] counterpart of the
[55:30] token now he doesn't say anything yet so
[55:34] he doesn't preach a sign message he
[55:37] doesn't preach anything but he gives her
[55:42] the gifts and the gifts amen are
[55:46] displayed on her by her actions listen I
[55:51] love the way the prophet explains this
[55:53] so why did Rebecca make that sudden move
[55:57] why did she go to the Waters of life so
[56:01] quickly why could the angel speak to her
[56:06] glory to God because she was blood
[56:10] relation to Isaac and that's who the
[56:14] angel can speak to tonight is a blood
[56:19] relation now do you realize out of all
[56:22] the billions of people that are on the
[56:24] face of the Earth today that the angel
[56:27] of God if you are bride if you are bride
[56:31] predestinated and your name is on that
[56:34] Lamb's Book of Life and it hasn't
[56:36] happened to you yet it will but for many
[56:39] of you it has already happened the angel
[56:42] of God has spoken to you and called your
[56:47] name and draw your attention to this
[56:51] Elie eer call in the last
[56:54] days now you might be the only one in
[56:57] your family you may suffer great
[57:00] persecution because of the word and you
[57:03] may be asked to leave all and go and
[57:06] follow something that seems heretical to
[57:10] the world but all you know is there's
[57:12] something down on the inside of you and
[57:15] it's like you have no other
[57:17] alternative praise be to God now the
[57:21] reason is it's the exact same reason
[57:24] that the angel of God went to to her now
[57:27] remember it was at the evening time that
[57:30] the virgins went out to get well water
[57:33] from the well so no doubt there was many
[57:35] different ones that maybe had come
[57:37] before her maybe after her one church
[57:40] after another one move after another
[57:42] after another but the angel of God only
[57:46] went to her and it went to her before
[57:50] she ever met
[57:52] elaser now think of it why did he go to
[57:55] her she was blood relation to Isaac but
[58:00] the thing of it is she didn't even know
[58:02] it yet praise be to God now watch by the
[58:06] blood we are born into the body of
[58:10] Christ re Rebecca and Isaac amen own
[58:14] cousin by both fathers which made them
[58:18] blood relation and the bride of Christ
[58:21] is Sanctified through the blood of
[58:24] Christ and an open vessel for the Holy
[58:28] Spirit to speak to he goes on to say she
[58:32] made her decisions quick watch her real
[58:37] quick then in the meeting
[58:41] quickly if they're ordained to eternal
[58:44] life they'll know it there's something
[58:48] in the message that stirs them there's
[58:53] something in the message that stirs them
[58:56] how many knows what I'm talking about
[58:58] tonight something in the message that
[59:01] stirs them that's what stirred Rebeca
[59:04] the message stirred her the angel was
[59:10] leading her Oh Glory to God can't you
[59:14] see her picture the angel of the Lord
[59:17] leading her then she was stirred and
[59:21] immediately when she watered the camel
[59:25] the gift
[59:26] went on
[59:28] her so when she Waters the camel the
[59:32] Holy Spirit then the gift went on her
[59:37] now want you to notice that she does not
[59:39] stop elaser and begin to explain to him
[59:45] how the gifts should be operated but she
[59:49] actually let him put the gifts in order
[59:54] where they needed to be
[59:56] she didn't take the gift off of her ear
[59:59] and put it around her leg which they did
[1:00:02] wear them right above their ankle she
[1:00:05] did not take the bracelets off of her
[1:00:08] wrist and wire one on this ear and one
[1:00:11] on that ear and say you know what I like
[1:00:13] them better out of the room I like them
[1:00:15] out here where everybody can see them so
[1:00:18] I I'm going to rearrange these gifts H
[1:00:21] well glory to God you're quiet on me
[1:00:22] tonight but you know what she apparently
[1:00:26] she just believed that if this man had
[1:00:29] the order of the gifts he would not tell
[1:00:32] her the wrong way for her to use them
[1:00:36] now remember Rebecca believed in the
[1:00:42] gifts well I believe God's Rebecca today
[1:00:45] still believes in the gifts I hope with
[1:00:48] all of my heart we see the real genuine
[1:00:51] gifts of the Holy Ghost manifested in
[1:00:53] our church before we go on the rapture
[1:00:56] and the bride said I ain't talking about
[1:00:59] just the three vocal ones I'm talking
[1:01:01] about the other six which probably L the
[1:01:03] message people don't even what they are
[1:01:05] but I figure that all nine gifts are
[1:01:08] important not just tongues
[1:01:09] interpretation and prophecy come on
[1:01:12] somebody say Amen with me tonight now
[1:01:15] you know the gift of God the messenger
[1:01:18] restores and with this comes this
[1:01:22] restoration and it was not the gifts
[1:01:25] remaining only on him or in his
[1:01:28] possession but he come bearing gifts and
[1:01:33] the gifts was not actually for the
[1:01:36] foolish virgin type so they're not for
[1:01:39] her Maids but the gifts were for Rebecca
[1:01:44] praise the Lord now even though her
[1:01:46] mother and her brother received gifts
[1:01:50] they did not receive the wedding gifts
[1:01:54] now listen to me me I don't just want oh
[1:01:58] my I don't want just gifts that are
[1:02:02] shouting and jumping and running and so
[1:02:04] on all you got to do is tap in on
[1:02:06] YouTube and you'll see Pentecost running
[1:02:09] jumping shouting carrying on all of that
[1:02:12] I ain't got nothing against that but if
[1:02:14] that's a sign of bride Revival what
[1:02:15] about all them with all their earbobs
[1:02:17] and their ears and bobbed hair and
[1:02:19] everything else you be to tell me that's
[1:02:21] a bride's Revival in the UPC Church and
[1:02:23] they hate this message come on on
[1:02:26] somebody I don't just want what the
[1:02:29] Pentecostals God I want that
[1:02:32] plus
[1:02:34] plus amen I believe that God has a
[1:02:38] people on the Earth that the angel of
[1:02:41] God can speak to now notice he said the
[1:02:45] gift went on her he be to take out the
[1:02:49] earrings and notice what the earrings
[1:02:51] represented he begin to take out the
[1:02:54] earrings which means face cometh by
[1:02:58] hearing you see and put the bracelet on
[1:03:02] which is the work of your hands so what
[1:03:06] were the bracelet it was the crowning or
[1:03:11] the identification that the works that
[1:03:13] she had done 60 trips up and down that
[1:03:17] well watering him watering the camels
[1:03:20] gold has now come upon them and crowned
[1:03:24] The Works of her hands and then faith
[1:03:27] comes by hearing and hearing by the word
[1:03:29] of God so Faith don't come by hearing
[1:03:32] and then questioning well I don't
[1:03:34] understand that and I don't think it
[1:03:35] should be done that way I I I don't I
[1:03:37] don't agree with that that's not what
[1:03:39] Rebecca done and Rebecca did not have a
[1:03:42] theological debate with elzer and S out
[1:03:45] why why are you doing this because you
[1:03:46] was a Baptist I don't understand why you
[1:03:49] preach that how come you preach that
[1:03:50] seed of the serpent stuff how come you
[1:03:52] to come up of that ill e or have to come
[1:03:54] back and say I never come up of the
[1:03:56] serpent seat it was actually the serpent
[1:03:57] himself that fathered the seat it wasn't
[1:03:59] me so it had to point back and say
[1:04:02] that's right in the Bible Rebecca
[1:04:04] imagine Rebecca debating with him well
[1:04:05] I'll tell you one thing I was baptized
[1:04:07] in titles I don't understand why in the
[1:04:09] world I've got to be baptized in the
[1:04:10] name of Isaac I don't see what in the
[1:04:12] world I've got to get rid of my britches
[1:04:14] for what in the world I have to get rid
[1:04:16] of my my makeup and my mascara and us
[1:04:18] men why do we have to get quck wearing
[1:04:20] our shorts and why do men have to get
[1:04:22] cut the locks off of their hair and
[1:04:24] we're not living in the days of abson
[1:04:26] some of your brothers but Men supposed
[1:04:28] to have their hair
[1:04:30] cut well praise the Lord I don't imagine
[1:04:33] Rebecca got into a big theological
[1:04:35] debate over to her daddy's house and
[1:04:37] said I'll tell you one thing I want to
[1:04:38] know how you part your hair and I want
[1:04:40] to know where your home church is and I
[1:04:42] want to know how you baptize and I'm
[1:04:44] going to sort through but what my daddy
[1:04:46] said my grandpa said and if you don't
[1:04:48] say what they say I ain't taking what
[1:04:50] you said he'd have left her right there
[1:04:52] with her water pot in her
[1:04:54] hand well
[1:04:57] Glory now notice put the bracelets on
[1:05:00] the works of your hands he got her ready
[1:05:03] and as soon as she begin to water give
[1:05:06] the Waters of Life testify tell others
[1:05:09] get the message out tell them what has
[1:05:12] happened to you now I want you to notice
[1:05:15] now he's moving from one stage to
[1:05:18] another from Faith to Faith as it was
[1:05:22] and with each thing that is asked and
[1:05:24] each thing that is going on it's opening
[1:05:28] up for us a type in the end time watch
[1:05:31] verse 23 and he said who daughter art
[1:05:37] thou whose daughter art thou tell me I
[1:05:43] Praise Him is there room in thy father's
[1:05:48] house for us to Lodge in can we come and
[1:05:53] have a few days meetings cuz there might
[1:05:56] be some seed in there that we want to
[1:05:58] pull out that denominational
[1:06:00] mess well praise the Lord uh is there
[1:06:04] room in your church where maybe we could
[1:06:06] come in and have a meeting Oh Glory
[1:06:11] who's daughter art thou now all of these
[1:06:15] are very pertinent to his mission of
[1:06:18] coming for all of this distance now and
[1:06:21] he's got to find out who she is now he
[1:06:25] SE this sign yeah she said Amen to that
[1:06:28] he's seen that amen amen she said but
[1:06:30] he's got to now come to her lineage Oh
[1:06:35] Glory whose daughter art thou now the
[1:06:40] reason of this question is by the answer
[1:06:44] that he would know whether she was of
[1:06:48] the family related to Abraham or not now
[1:06:52] he's not using discernment to tell her
[1:06:56] but he wants her to tell him who are
[1:07:01] you where do you come from what's your
[1:07:05] paternal side and I also want to know
[1:07:09] your maternal
[1:07:11] side so she she's got to
[1:07:15] identify who she is to be identified as
[1:07:19] being a wife for Isaac now this is going
[1:07:22] to bring a greater measure of
[1:07:24] satisfaction tell me I praise it is a
[1:07:27] room in thy father's house this also is
[1:07:31] going to tell him what kind of a father
[1:07:35] she has is he a man of means now
[1:07:38] remember the way that they looked at
[1:07:39] marriage it was a joining together and a
[1:07:43] merging together of families so they
[1:07:45] wouldn't want to marry one family to
[1:07:47] another family that would not seem F
[1:07:50] fitting and comely so by her answer he
[1:07:54] will know further if she is the one and
[1:07:58] the connection will be more pure and
[1:08:01] divine she said unto him I am the
[1:08:07] daughter of
[1:08:10] bethuel the son of
[1:08:14] Mila which she bore unto
[1:08:19] nahor I want you to notice he does not
[1:08:22] tell her how to answer
[1:08:26] he does not tell her in which order to
[1:08:30] answer in the paternal side or the
[1:08:33] maternal side or the grandfather's side
[1:08:36] but now she's speaking Glory out of the
[1:08:41] value of her patronage listen carefully
[1:08:45] and she said unto him I am the daughter
[1:08:49] of bethuel the son of Mila which she be
[1:08:56] unto nahor now it's not just important
[1:09:01] that she identifies who her daddy is but
[1:09:05] she wants her maternal side also to be
[1:09:10] identified with the wife of high
[1:09:14] order you see for many of these men they
[1:09:17] practice polygamy or they would take
[1:09:21] concubines and she wanted to trace her
[1:09:25] ID idty even back on the maternal order
[1:09:29] that she was of the church which was of
[1:09:33] the highest order in the land so you
[1:09:36] couldn't just believe whatever you
[1:09:38] wanted to believe and go ahead and go in
[1:09:39] the Rapture and be in the bride and just
[1:09:42] pick any mother any church that you
[1:09:44] wanted well they're all the same well a
[1:09:46] lot of them out there may be the same
[1:09:48] but the brides is not I am the daughter
[1:09:51] of Betha so she noticed her first
[1:09:54] identif ation is who her father is I am
[1:09:59] the daughter of bethuel the son of milka
[1:10:03] so she doesn't mention her mother first
[1:10:06] but she mentions his mother so I am the
[1:10:11] daughter of bethuel the son of Mila
[1:10:15] which she bear unto nahor Mila was my
[1:10:20] grandmother and nahor was my grandfather
[1:10:25] and Oh Glory bethuel was my father so
[1:10:30] Rebecca mentions her father's mother to
[1:10:33] show that she had descended from a
[1:10:38] Highborn wife so she was not of a
[1:10:42] concubine lineage in other words she
[1:10:45] wasn't foolish
[1:10:47] virgin she didn't just belong to a
[1:10:49] church and said well I'm in the message
[1:10:51] and I listen to tapes every day that
[1:10:53] ain't no more than just man a concubine
[1:10:55] if you ain't born again so the servant
[1:10:58] now listen he's listening to her reply
[1:11:03] of her patronage he's listening what
[1:11:07] value does she put upon her birth and
[1:11:11] where she come from so looks at her
[1:11:15] father's side traces him back to the
[1:11:17] Highborn wife and then traces him right
[1:11:21] over to the very kin to Abraham on what
[1:11:25] side the father's side but also on the
[1:11:29] mother's side so she's identifying
[1:11:32] herself as Isaac's cousin so milka being
[1:11:36] the daughter of
[1:11:38] harand which is Abraham's
[1:11:42] brother so milka was actually glory to
[1:11:47] God friends can't you see the real bride
[1:11:50] the bride is in direct lineage from the
[1:11:54] Lion of God so it's not like that the
[1:11:58] Bride is a church prostitute that's
[1:12:01] taken out and God's trying to bring
[1:12:03] children by by bonds made don't you see
[1:12:06] why we are so against man-made religion
[1:12:09] and man-made ideology that God wants
[1:12:13] every one of us to have our own births
[1:12:15] we are more than Reagans we are more
[1:12:18] than Wards we're more than Perry's we're
[1:12:21] more than Swanson's and bentons we God
[1:12:24] wants us to be able to take our identity
[1:12:27] back I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of
[1:12:30] God I'll have the Holy Ghost I've been
[1:12:33] Sanctified I'm a born again child of God
[1:12:36] I'm born of the word of God by Malachi 4
[1:12:40] that's who I am I belong to the right
[1:12:44] church I go to the right Church
[1:12:46] Hallelujah and she is my mother
[1:12:50] Hallelujah to God I belong to the right
[1:12:53] bunch
[1:12:55] am
[1:12:57] amen Mila being the daughter of
[1:13:00] haran
[1:13:02] Abraham's brother now when he knew that
[1:13:06] she fulfilled all these
[1:13:11] conditions Oh
[1:13:12] Glory then he now identifies her to go
[1:13:18] to her
[1:13:19] house now watch the servant is now
[1:13:23] interested in her her family but the the
[1:13:27] the question has a broader application
[1:13:31] to us as Believers so now I want to move
[1:13:35] from
[1:13:36] Rebecca and I want to ask you who are
[1:13:44] you who are
[1:13:47] you are you just a human or just a
[1:13:50] mortal that's down here trying to
[1:13:52] struggle for life and and trying to go
[1:13:54] to a place that you've never been and
[1:13:56] and maybe God somehow will have mercy on
[1:13:59] you and you'll be able to find the way
[1:14:01] and you'll stumble around here in this
[1:14:03] darkness is that what you think you
[1:14:05] are who are
[1:14:09] you and St John
[1:14:12] 3 verse
[1:14:14] three Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:14:17] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[1:14:21] man be born again
[1:14:25] he cannot see the kingdom of God look at
[1:14:28] the word again it means from
[1:14:32] above from the
[1:14:35] first from the first from a higher
[1:14:41] place from the
[1:14:44] beginning now brother sister this is the
[1:14:47] way the true Rebecca believes the new
[1:14:51] birth you're born from the beginning
[1:14:54] from a higher place from the first don't
[1:14:58] have remember this is Jesus the first
[1:15:01] one to mention this Doctrine this is his
[1:15:03] first Doctrine the prophet said that he
[1:15:05] mentioned in the New Testament was being
[1:15:08] born again so being born again is from
[1:15:12] above from the first from a higher place
[1:15:16] from the beginning now I realize that
[1:15:19] we're living in a great world and
[1:15:21] especially usse year in the Bible Belt
[1:15:23] word being born again or so called being
[1:15:25] born again Christian belonging to church
[1:15:27] it's it's a big thing for people to say
[1:15:29] it oh yeah I'm born again I go to church
[1:15:32] I'm born again I'm a Christian and yet
[1:15:35] you get around some of them that say
[1:15:36] that they drink I was talking to someone
[1:15:39] just last week and they were they were
[1:15:41] supposedly born again and yet living
[1:15:44] with their girlfriend now there would
[1:15:45] nobody of course that comes to our
[1:15:47] church but yet living with their
[1:15:48] girlfriend and claiming to be born again
[1:15:51] or a Christian and you realize that's
[1:15:54] where the church has come to and they
[1:15:56] think nothing about it and and and
[1:15:59] Christians drink as a matter of fact I
[1:16:01] seen a former a picture of a former
[1:16:03] message preacher some time ago and sat
[1:16:05] there with shorts on and a beer can in
[1:16:07] his hand a man that is stood in the pull
[1:16:09] pit around the world and preach the
[1:16:11] message of the hour well you know the
[1:16:13] problem was he never was born
[1:16:15] again well come on following the message
[1:16:18] and being born again is not always the
[1:16:21] same thing that's exactly right now
[1:16:24] Jesus Jesus said you must be born from
[1:16:27] the first or from the beginning now
[1:16:30] let's Trace then our patronage from the
[1:16:34] word of God are we just here as
[1:16:37] creatures of time and we're trying to do
[1:16:40] the very best we can and we really don't
[1:16:41] know if we're saved or not and we really
[1:16:43] don't know if we'll even make it or not
[1:16:45] and then somehow at the end of the way
[1:16:47] we wait till we get over Yonder uh-uh
[1:16:49] that's not the Plan of Salvation my God
[1:16:51] has we can know beyond the shadow of a
[1:16:54] doubt that we have passed from Death un
[1:16:57] life look in Luke
[1:17:00] 22:31 and the Lord said Simon Simon
[1:17:03] behold Satan hath desired to have you
[1:17:05] that he may sift you as wheat but I have
[1:17:09] prayed for thee that thy face notice
[1:17:13] this thy face fail not now Peter failed
[1:17:18] Peter's bragging fail Jesus didn't pray
[1:17:21] his bragging wouldn't fail he prayed his
[1:17:24] face would fail is that right now listen
[1:17:27] what he tells this preacher which had
[1:17:30] preached the message cast out Devils
[1:17:33] heal the sick had great signs and
[1:17:36] wonders listen and when thou art
[1:17:41] converted so Peter had accepted the Lord
[1:17:44] Jesus as his savior he was one of the
[1:17:46] very few people that ever lived on the
[1:17:49] earth that the Lord Jesus personally
[1:17:51] baptized him in
[1:17:53] water and he still still wasn't
[1:17:55] converted why you don't get converted
[1:17:57] you get the Holy
[1:17:58] Ghost well praise the Lord now so Jesus
[1:18:02] tells him when you are converted when
[1:18:04] you turn around I want you to strengthen
[1:18:08] your brethren watch acts 19:1 and it
[1:18:11] came to pass while Apollos was at
[1:18:13] Corinth Paul having passed through the
[1:18:16] upper Coast came to Ephesus finding
[1:18:19] certain disciples now listen to this
[1:18:21] carefully finding certain disciples now
[1:18:25] these people are being disciplined to
[1:18:28] follow a message of a prophet of God
[1:18:33] they are disciples and the word
[1:18:35] Disciples of course comes from the Greek
[1:18:38] word word which is disciplined so they
[1:18:41] were walking a certain walk talking a
[1:18:43] certain talk behaving a certain way now
[1:18:47] listen this finding certain disciples
[1:18:50] and he said unto them have you received
[1:18:52] the Holy Ghost since
[1:18:56] sins ye
[1:19:00] believed it's amazing when the prophet
[1:19:02] quotes this scripture reads it he says
[1:19:04] these were good Baptists and they
[1:19:06] thought they got it when they
[1:19:08] believed well a lot the message folks
[1:19:10] believe the same thing now want you
[1:19:13] notice how Paul separated believing from
[1:19:17] receiving the Holy
[1:19:19] Ghost now these false preachers in this
[1:19:22] day that's telling their church members
[1:19:24] that when you you come up and accept
[1:19:25] Christ as your savior and you're born
[1:19:28] again that's a lie amen according to the
[1:19:32] Bible I said according to the Bible come
[1:19:35] on Rebecca can you say Amen
[1:19:38] am have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:19:41] since you believe and they said unto him
[1:19:45] we've not so much as heard whether there
[1:19:49] be any Holy
[1:19:52] Ghost now you know who they were
[1:19:54] following
[1:19:55] the teaching of John the
[1:19:57] Baptist the man who forrun the coming of
[1:20:00] the Lord Jesus but they were two
[1:20:02] dispensations
[1:20:04] behind John had come introduced the Lord
[1:20:07] Jesus another dispensation the Lord
[1:20:10] Jesus lived and died went up into heaven
[1:20:13] the Holy Ghost come back which is
[1:20:15] another dispensation and they were two
[1:20:17] dispensations
[1:20:19] behind they hadn't even heard I find
[1:20:22] this so amazing to me because the
[1:20:24] Prophet they were following had the Holy
[1:20:27] Ghost before he was even born amen yes
[1:20:32] he did and they hadn't even heard about
[1:20:33] it apparently they had not listened to
[1:20:36] the Holy Ghost series had
[1:20:40] they praise the Lord they hadn't even
[1:20:43] heard about the Holy Ghost and their
[1:20:46] Prophet had it before he was born oh my
[1:20:51] now watch and he said unto them andto
[1:20:53] what then were you back baptize them
[1:20:55] they said under John's baptism and then
[1:20:57] Paul John verily baptized with the
[1:21:00] baptism of repentance saying unto the
[1:21:02] people they should believe on him which
[1:21:04] should after come on him that is on
[1:21:06] Christ Jesus so John did not baptize
[1:21:09] using a name he didn't say Jesus he
[1:21:13] didn't say Christ Christos and only one
[1:21:15] he just said you now I'm baptizing you
[1:21:18] and you're going to believe on him that
[1:21:20] is to come he didn't even know what his
[1:21:22] name was yet so they just all got
[1:21:25] baptized with no
[1:21:29] name oh
[1:21:31] my and when they heard this they were
[1:21:34] baptized in the name of father son Holy
[1:21:44] Ghost In The Name Of The Lord
[1:21:49] Jesus and Rebecca
[1:21:52] said okay so they were baptized in the
[1:21:55] name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had
[1:21:58] laid his hands upon them the Holy
[1:22:03] Ghost the Holy Ghost came on them and
[1:22:07] they spake with
[1:22:08] tongues and
[1:22:12] prophesy which is to foretell future
[1:22:15] events or reveals the
[1:22:18] secrets of people's hearts in the
[1:22:23] assembly praise the Lord so when they
[1:22:27] receive the Holy Ghost then look what
[1:22:30] happened to them so the Holy Ghost came
[1:22:32] on them and they spake with tongues how
[1:22:35] many of you people here tonight still
[1:22:36] believe the Holy Ghost can do the same
[1:22:38] thing but speaking in tongues is not the
[1:22:41] evidence of the Holy Ghost praise the
[1:22:44] Lord some may speak in tongues and they
[1:22:46] may not some may shout and they may not
[1:22:49] but there's one thing about it they'll
[1:22:50] all be
[1:22:51] changed and you will amen the word of
[1:22:54] God now let's read in Ephesians 1:3 in
[1:22:59] whom ye also
[1:23:01] trusted after that you heard the word of
[1:23:05] Truth The Gospel of your salvation
[1:23:09] notice again separating the gospel
[1:23:12] message from the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:15] Ghost these lying preachers down Through
[1:23:18] the Ages that have told people it's one
[1:23:20] and the same are going to answer at the
[1:23:23] day of judgment and they're going to
[1:23:24] look in the Angry Eyes of almighty
[1:23:29] God let me bring it on down because we
[1:23:32] got message preachers is saying the same
[1:23:34] thing that you can't believe the message
[1:23:37] of the hour without the Holy Ghost so if
[1:23:38] you believe God sent a prophet you've
[1:23:39] got the Holy Ghost that's as big a lie
[1:23:41] as a
[1:23:42] Baptist well come on if you really get
[1:23:45] the true Holy Ghost in This Day on your
[1:23:47] soul you will believe the message of the
[1:23:49] hour but I think we've all been around
[1:23:51] long enough to know we've had all kinds
[1:23:53] Among Us this said they believe the
[1:23:55] message of the hour but it's sure
[1:23:57] evident they didn't have the Holy
[1:24:00] Ghost in whom y'all so trusted after
[1:24:03] that you heard the word of Truth so
[1:24:05] after you heard the word of Truth which
[1:24:08] is the gospel then you trusted on Jesus
[1:24:11] as your savior the gospel of your
[1:24:14] salvation in whom also
[1:24:18] after after that ye
[1:24:23] believe ye you were sealed with that
[1:24:26] Holy Spirit of promise not when you
[1:24:32] believed oh thank you Lord oh my look
[1:24:36] friends I preached it for years and
[1:24:37] years I believe one of the greatest laes
[1:24:40] Among Us in our own ranks is the true
[1:24:43] baptism of the Holy
[1:24:46] Ghost ye were sealed with that Holy
[1:24:49] Spirit of promise I ain't just talking
[1:24:51] about Leon either it's evident a bunch
[1:24:53] of preachers and our ranks ain't had it
[1:24:56] either it's evident preachers that have
[1:24:58] studied and preached the message a lot
[1:25:00] of them ain't had the Holy Ghost that's
[1:25:01] why they go after this move and that
[1:25:03] move and that move some of them after
[1:25:05] they preach for 20 and 30 years and then
[1:25:07] deny the message and the messenger how
[1:25:09] in the world could you have the Holy
[1:25:13] Ghost which is the earnest of our
[1:25:16] inheritance
[1:25:18] salvation is not your
[1:25:21] earnest accepting Jesus as your savior
[1:25:26] is not your earnest I'm asking you
[1:25:28] tonight who are
[1:25:31] you are you just
[1:25:33] saved are you just people that I believe
[1:25:37] I believe God sent his son I

[1:28:03] inheritance until the Redemption of the

[1:28:09] possession unto the praise of his
[1:28:16] glory listen this John
[1:28:19] 1:1 he
[1:28:21] came unto his own
[1:28:25] and his
[1:28:27] own received him
[1:28:30] not but to as
[1:28:33] many as received
[1:28:36] him to them gave he
[1:28:42] power to
[1:28:45] become I know I've shared the meaning of
[1:28:47] this word with you before but it's such
[1:28:49] a good and I'm going to keep on saying
[1:28:51] it till the Millennium I
[1:28:52] reckon he gave them power to
[1:28:58] become look at the meaning of it come to
[1:29:02] pass be
[1:29:04] fulfilled be
[1:29:06] preferred don't you understand every son
[1:29:09] and daughter of God is a
[1:29:13] prophecy it's no wonder that we identify
[1:29:17] brother Daryl with a prophetic
[1:29:20] message I
[1:29:22] myself am a prophetic word from
[1:29:26] God you if you're a member of the bride
[1:29:29] of Christ you are a prophetic word from
[1:29:34] God and the Lord Jesus only come to the
[1:29:38] Earth so you could come to
[1:29:44] pass so he come he came to his own and
[1:29:47] his own receiv received him not but to
[1:29:49] as many as received him to them gave he
[1:29:51] the power to become or come to pass he
[1:29:56] gave you the power to come to pass thank
[1:30:02] you Lord Jesus the sons of God even to
[1:30:05] them that believe on his name do you
[1:30:08] understand what we're doing we're coming
[1:30:10] to pass we are a prophetic utterance
[1:30:15] from God we started as a thought in his
[1:30:19] mind and he spoke us before the
[1:30:21] foundation of the worlden
[1:30:24] this is our our time frame this is our
[1:30:29] hour notice which we born not of blood
[1:30:35] nor of the will of the
[1:30:37] flesh nor of the will of
[1:30:40] man but of
[1:30:43] God I know that boy the Free Will
[1:30:46] Baptist have a hard time with that
[1:30:47] scripture oh my they think they're
[1:30:50] counterbalancing John Calvin because
[1:30:52] John Calvin broke into some of this
[1:30:53] stuff and he said good Lord have mercy
[1:30:55] then I wouldn't say because I wanted to
[1:30:57] be I wouldn't say because my mama wanted
[1:31:00] me to be I would say because God wanted
[1:31:02] me to be I quoted it to you here I guess
[1:31:04] it was Sunday after the service that
[1:31:06] Martin Luther said when I look at myself
[1:31:09] I don't see how I could be saved but
[1:31:11] when I look at Jesus I don't see how I
[1:31:13] could be lost well I hope that's the way
[1:31:15] you're looking at yourself tonight if a
[1:31:18] man just under the influence of
[1:31:20] justification would see that what about
[1:31:22] us with a token in the last day
[1:31:27] which were born not of blood nor the
[1:31:30] will of fresh glory to God I'll tell you
[1:31:33] one thing I heard that preacher preach
[1:31:35] that sermon I grabbed the hold of the
[1:31:37] horns of the altar I wouldn't let go I'm
[1:31:40] telling you I went down there I beat and
[1:31:43] banged on that altar I prayed her
[1:31:45] through brother I made up my mind I done
[1:31:48] this I done that you done
[1:31:51] nothing the biggest problem in our life
[1:31:54] as us thinking what we've done
[1:31:57] anyhow you're not born by your own will
[1:32:00] you're not born by your own choice
[1:32:03] you're born by the will of God who are
[1:32:09] you who are we are we people that's born
[1:32:13] by our determination is that what keeps
[1:32:17] us I am born by the Breath of God
[1:32:24] couldn't have made it this far on my own
[1:32:27] I don't have the strength to do
[1:32:29] it he's proven that time and time again
[1:32:32] and I'm going to say it for a bunch of
[1:32:34] the rest of you you couldn't either you
[1:32:36] ain't here tonight because you're so
[1:32:38] stable and you're so great you're a
[1:32:40] bunch of puny weaklings all of us are if
[1:32:44] it wasn't for the grace of God we' have
[1:32:46] fell flat on our face and would have
[1:32:47] never got up again but the grace of God
[1:32:50] grabs a hold of us and we fall flat on
[1:32:53] our face and he reachs down and jerks us
[1:32:55] up
[1:32:56] again Hallelujah it don't mean because
[1:33:00] you belong to him you won't fall flat on
[1:33:03] your face you will but he'll grab a hold
[1:33:05] of you and say come on boy come on
[1:33:08] daughter of God get up dust yourself off
[1:33:11] your
[1:33:13] mind
[1:33:14] [Applause]
[1:33:20] amen who are you
[1:33:26] James
[1:33:27] 1:18 of his own
[1:33:31] will begat he
[1:33:34] us with the word of
[1:33:37] truth that we should be a kind of first
[1:33:41] fruits of his
[1:33:44] creatures that's who I
[1:33:47] am not by my will not by my
[1:33:51] determination not by your strength
[1:33:54] strength but by his own will he called
[1:33:59] you Romans 8:8 so then they that are in
[1:34:04] the
[1:34:06] flesh cannot please
[1:34:09] God how many Still In the
[1:34:14] Flesh oh dear God there must be some
[1:34:16] people in here that
[1:34:18] ain't they didn't raise their
[1:34:20] hands wow I mean I I I I I'm tot
[1:34:23] surprised I never thought theopen would
[1:34:25] have ugly faces the way some of y'all
[1:34:26] didn't raise your hands as God some of
[1:34:28] y'all got gray head and you got glasses
[1:34:29] on you got contacts on oh man I need to
[1:34:32] go back and reread it don't
[1:34:34] I how many sell In the Flesh ah so some
[1:34:38] of you ain't your theophanies after all
[1:34:40] well because you are that's definite
[1:34:43] proof you cannot please
[1:34:46] God by the will of your flesh that
[1:34:52] is so then they that are in the flesh
[1:34:55] cannot please
[1:34:59] God but ye are not in the
[1:35:03] flesh but in the
[1:35:05] spirit good
[1:35:08] Lord so you mean if I'm born again I'm
[1:35:11] Not In the
[1:35:12] Flesh that's a yes and no question well
[1:35:15] which one is it brother Donnie it's
[1:35:16] actually
[1:35:19] both because the new birth wants to
[1:35:22] dominate the
[1:35:25] flesh control
[1:35:28] selfishness temper anger malice
[1:35:34] Strife but you're not in the flesh but
[1:35:37] in the spirit now notice capital S not
[1:35:40] the human Spirit if so be the spirit of
[1:35:44] God dwell in you now if any man have not
[1:35:48] the spirit of
[1:35:50] Christ he is none of his
[1:35:56] so the Lord Jesus does not yet claim you
[1:35:59] as
[1:36:00] his until you're filled with the Holy
[1:36:03] Ghost you're a work in progress for
[1:36:06] sure and if Christ be in
[1:36:11] you the body is dead because of
[1:36:15] sin but the spirit is life because of
[1:36:20] righteousness but if the spirit amen of
[1:36:24] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:36:29] boy this is one of my favorite
[1:36:30] scriptures in Pentecost and this is one
[1:36:33] I use to back up
[1:36:38] shouting it will Quicken your mortal
[1:36:41] body so that's what I preach glory to
[1:36:43] God if you got the Holy Ghost the spirit
[1:36:46] of God in you will Quicken your mortal
[1:36:47] body here we' take off a running and a
[1:36:49] shouting and some of them would go to
[1:36:51] running and a shouting and the
[1:36:52] cigarettes would fall out of their
[1:36:56] pockets and the picture of their
[1:36:58] brother's wife that they was packing
[1:36:59] around that fall out of their pockets
[1:37:01] and all kinds of things that fall out of
[1:37:03] their pocket but glory to God our body
[1:37:05] was being quickened I'm not against that
[1:37:08] but that ain't even what Paul's talking
[1:37:10] about it will actually Quicken our
[1:37:14] bodies to complete obedience to the word
[1:37:25] now watch this new
[1:37:27] man/ old man Romans
[1:37:31] 66 knowing this that our old man is
[1:37:36] crucified with
[1:37:38] him that the body of sin might be
[1:37:42] destroyed that hence Force we should not
[1:37:46] serve sin which we did do of course
[1:37:48] before we were born again Ephesians 4:21
[1:37:52] if so be that ye have heard him and have
[1:37:56] been taught by him as the truth is in
[1:38:01] Jesus that you put off concerning the
[1:38:06] former conversation now watch how he
[1:38:08] identifies your talk and he calls your
[1:38:12] talk and manner of Life the old
[1:38:16] man which is corrupt according to the
[1:38:19] deceitful
[1:38:21] lust well I'm just an sinner saved by
[1:38:26] grace I sin a little bit more or less
[1:38:29] every day and not of it's so perfect and
[1:38:33] uh you know that's what the blood is for
[1:38:36] the blood is there because we can never
[1:38:39] bring this flesh subject to the spirit
[1:38:41] of God and we just kind of struggle
[1:38:45] along is that who you
[1:38:50] are do you understand that's the
[1:38:52] testimony of the majority of Christians
[1:38:55] on the face of the Earth well this just
[1:38:58] runs in my family it runs in my family
[1:39:02] to not be able to forgive people and to
[1:39:05] hold
[1:39:06] grudges it runs in my family it's just
[1:39:10] hard for me to say I'm
[1:39:14] wrong you need to be a part of Jesus
[1:39:17] family cause the Cry of this hour is
[1:39:22] repent and if you can't repent it means
[1:39:25] you ain't got the Holy Ghost yet
[1:39:29] amen woo got a lot of Rebeccas by name
[1:39:32] we're thinning them down by Nature
[1:39:34] though ain't we now come on the former
[1:39:37] conversation the old man which is uh
[1:39:40] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[1:39:43] and be renewed in the spirit the Numa
[1:39:47] the Numa the spirit of your mind FAL
[1:39:53] that which gives you the ability to
[1:39:56] think like he thinks so let this mind
[1:40:01] for Neil being in you which was also in
[1:40:04] Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[1:40:07] God thought it not Roby to be equal with
[1:40:10] God but was in made in like fashion as
[1:40:13] we are and took upon himself so he
[1:40:17] didn't think of himself as being some
[1:40:19] great something some great this or that
[1:40:22] or the other and let us have this same
[1:40:25] mind that we're not this great this and
[1:40:27] that we're just a speck that's all we
[1:40:31] are that you put on the new man which
[1:40:35] after God is
[1:40:38] created in righteousness and true
[1:40:42] Holiness Colossians 3:9 lie not one to
[1:40:46] another seeing that you have put off the
[1:40:50] old man with his deed
[1:40:54] and have put
[1:40:56] on the new man which is renewed in
[1:41:01] knowledge after the image of
[1:41:04] him that created him oh my
[1:41:09] goodness who are
[1:41:13] you who are
[1:41:15] you so are you still the old man or are
[1:41:19] you a new one which has been created
[1:41:23] after the image of him that created him
[1:41:27] him who the new man the new man is in
[1:41:32] the image of the Creator this is in the
[1:41:35] image of mother and father and Grandma
[1:41:37] and Grandpa and aunt and
[1:41:41] uncle praise God 2 Corinthians 5:17
[1:41:46] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[1:41:51] a all things are passed away behold
[1:41:55] three or three to five things or maybe
[1:41:59] six even let's stretch it on out to
[1:42:01] seven seven things will become
[1:42:08] new
[1:42:10] what I wonder sometimes friends if we
[1:42:12] don't need need to have some good
[1:42:13] oldfashioned Bible studies not just for
[1:42:16] the young people
[1:42:18] either all things are become new
[1:42:21] Galatians 6:15 for in Christ Jesus
[1:42:25] neither circumcision Avil us anything
[1:42:28] nor uncircumcision but a new creature
[1:42:31] who are
[1:42:35] you where did you come
[1:42:38] from who is your
[1:42:42] father what is your
[1:42:46] lineage are you identified as a Baptist
[1:42:49] a Methodist a Church of God let me bring
[1:42:51] it on down or just a message
[1:42:54] follower or are you identified as a new
[1:42:57] man a new woman a new person a new
[1:43:02] creature old things are passed away and
[1:43:05] all things are new who are
[1:43:14] you Jesus is the firstborn can I have a
[1:43:18] few more minutes before we
[1:43:20] close Romans 8
[1:43:24] 29 for whom he did for
[1:43:29] no brother Donnie here you go you
[1:43:33] started this back in 1987 and 88 when
[1:43:36] you first come here and you caused a
[1:43:39] vision among the church in Happy Valley
[1:43:41] it needed to cause
[1:43:42] division you started preaching that old
[1:43:45] predestination seed stuff and Lord have
[1:43:47] mercy it tore people all to pieces well
[1:43:50] I'm kind of glad cuz some of them that
[1:43:51] got all tore up really got turned around
[1:43:54] and got set on the straight path well
[1:43:56] Hallelujah I was kind of ignorant
[1:43:58] because I hadn't been to the message
[1:43:59] that long and I thought everybody
[1:44:01] believe what the prophet taught and what
[1:44:03] Paul taught about predestination but
[1:44:04] Happy Valley was one of my first run-ins
[1:44:07] with a lot of people that didn't believe
[1:44:08] in predestination so I had my to myself
[1:44:12] an absolute gastronomical Jubilee of
[1:44:15] pulling up all these quotes and putting
[1:44:16] them together my goodness and preaching
[1:44:19] it over at the other church and me and a
[1:44:21] few more had a Revival other had a
[1:44:23] battlefield but the rest of us had a
[1:44:25] Revival and I'll tell you it still
[1:44:27] brings Revival to my soul this day you
[1:44:29] know why this is who I am I'm not base
[1:44:33] while I Choice I'm a Free Will Baptist I
[1:44:35] ain't no Free Will Baptist I ain't no
[1:44:38] free will Pentecostal I'm a gene seed of
[1:44:41] God I was ordained before the foundation
[1:44:44] of the world he made his choice before I
[1:44:47] ever had the Breath of Life to make my
[1:44:49] choice he chose me I didn't choose him
[1:44:53] he give me the grace of God oh
[1:44:55] Hallelujah to choose him if I make it
[1:44:58] it'll be him if you make it it'll be him
[1:45:02] if there is a Rapture it will be
[1:45:12] him for whom he did for know he also did
[1:45:18] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:45:20] image of his son
[1:45:23] that he might be the
[1:45:27] firstborn among many
[1:45:33] Brethren so Jesus is the oldest son of
[1:45:37] the
[1:45:39] family as a matter of
[1:45:41] fact he is the choir
[1:45:47] leader I'm going to let you ponder over
[1:45:49] it a little
[1:45:50] bit the first born of many
[1:45:55] Brethren not him and all the rest of
[1:45:58] these slaves down there and he snaps his
[1:46:00] fingers and they're terrified
[1:46:02] oh sir that's not who you are you may
[1:46:07] still be an Egypt in your mind but you
[1:46:09] need to come to the land of promise in
[1:46:12] mind and in Soul I was a slave but no
[1:46:15] more I told you he the other night one
[1:46:17] thing that changed me when I come to the
[1:46:19] message of the hour it done away with
[1:46:22] that Pentecost also fear that I had that
[1:46:24] I was terrified of God I was scared to
[1:46:27] death of God but when I heard this
[1:46:29] Prophet talk to God and the way he
[1:46:31] talked to it and the mercy that he
[1:46:33] presented it totally transformed me and
[1:46:38] Chang the way I talk to Papa god well
[1:46:43] the truth of it was I got a word birth
[1:46:45] of Malachi 4 wo I got saved back in
[1:46:49] Pentecost I got a baptism of the Holy
[1:46:52] Ghost my spirit and Pentecost I got
[1:46:55] gifts and Pentecost I spoke in tongues I
[1:46:59] prophesied I preached but I couldn't
[1:47:01] have a word verse of Malachi 4 until I
[1:47:05] come under the influence of Malachi
[1:47:13] 4 that he might be the first born among
[1:47:17] many
[1:47:20] Brethren Hebrews 210
[1:47:24] for it
[1:47:25] became him for whom are all things and
[1:47:31] by whom are all things and bringing many
[1:47:37] sons unto
[1:47:39] glory to make the
[1:47:43] captain of their salvation I want you to
[1:47:47] notice Paul does not give him the rank
[1:47:51] of General
[1:47:55] look at the
[1:47:56] condensation of his
[1:47:59] love the captain he had to condens sin
[1:48:04] and step down from being General
[1:48:07] commander of the battalions of
[1:48:10] angels and took on the rank of
[1:48:14] Captain and them would even condens
[1:48:17] lower to that and become a snake on the
[1:48:21] pole the make the captain of
[1:48:25] their who
[1:48:28] Brothers Lord
[1:48:31] God do you understand why he took on
[1:48:38] Humanity do you understand what made him
[1:48:41] do
[1:48:45] it I'll tell you in a
[1:48:50] minute for it became him for whom are
[1:48:52] all all things and by whom are all
[1:48:55] things and bringing many sons into glory
[1:48:58] to make the captain of their salvation
[1:49:01] perfect
[1:49:02] through
[1:49:05] sufferings is there anybody in Word of
[1:49:08] Life
[1:49:09] Church that is willing to join the army
[1:49:12] of the
[1:49:14] Lord and in this Army you may
[1:49:18] suffer tremendous
[1:49:21] things some he will appoint to
[1:49:24] sickness as he tells us in the church

[1:49:31] appoint some to
[1:49:36] death will we say yes sir and we'll
[1:49:39] salute his

[1:52:03] by him in the
[1:52:06] choir and he's going to lead
[1:52:09] us in the family
[1:52:18] anthem for which cause he is not ashamed
[1:52:21] to call their brethren

[1:55:44] both of them
[1:55:45] yesterday and then it just took my
[1:55:47] finger and I slid it across the top
[1:55:54] and the next
[1:55:58] picture was my precious little
[1:56:02] girl that smile left my
[1:56:05] face and it started
[1:56:09] weeping I didn't feel happy no
[1:56:14] more and I looked at that picture and I
[1:56:16] said Lord God you see how much we love
[1:56:18] her how much we miss
[1:56:21] her but this is what I told
[1:56:24] him but I trust
[1:56:27] you you are
[1:56:30] perfect you don't make
[1:56:34] mistakes it runs in his
[1:56:37] family among his brothers and his
[1:56:42] sisters what they don't understand
[1:56:45] others will turn and walk
[1:56:48] away but it's a family trade in our
[1:56:51] family
[1:56:52] to say as our elder brother said I trust
[1:56:57] you even when I don't
[1:57:01] understand cuz he knows how much
[1:57:05] broken is
[1:57:08] enough you and I look at oursel and we
[1:57:10] say Lord don't hurt me don't hurt me now
[1:57:13] just just just you know maybe don't
[1:57:16] don't break me all together just maybe
[1:57:18] scratch me a little you know maybe just
[1:57:20] kind of handle me a little bit rough
[1:57:22] don't break me Lord don't don't break
[1:57:24] me I heard it years ago when I first
[1:57:26] started listening to tapes and brother B
[1:57:27] said
[1:57:29] father you've broken my heart over and
[1:57:32] over
[1:57:33] again and I thank you for
[1:57:36] it I
[1:57:39] wow I'm starting to understand more
[1:57:42] about it aren't
[1:57:45] you
[1:57:47] oh I will put my trust in him and again
[1:57:50] I
[1:57:52] and the children which God has given me
[1:57:55] listen this this is why I became flesh
[1:57:58] for as
[1:58:00] much as the
[1:58:04] children are partakers of Flesh and
[1:58:09] Blood he also himself likewise took part
[1:58:13] of the same the word translated took
[1:58:17] part is not the same as
[1:58:20] partakers but it implies
[1:58:23] partaking of something
[1:58:26] outside of
[1:58:30] oneself so he partook took part of
[1:58:34] something that was outside of himself
[1:58:37] for me it was normal to be a human
[1:58:40] normal to hurt normal for anxiety I was
[1:58:42] born this way but he wasn't born the
[1:58:46] word that way so he had to take part of
[1:58:50] something which was outside of himself
[1:58:53] do you understand he didn't do this
[1:58:56] children for the foolish
[1:58:59] virgin don't make the Bible
[1:59:02] lie this was not done for fallen
[1:59:05] angels according to
[1:59:08] Paul the whole work of
[1:59:11] incarnation was for the family's
[1:59:15] sake amen but remember if you go into a
[1:59:19] pawn shop and you've got a buggy
[1:59:23] you've got a whole pocket full of
[1:59:25] receipts item 22 item 37 item 45 it's in
[1:59:30] B three item 89 and B
[1:59:33] five and you've got them receipts right
[1:59:36] there and you're there to
[1:59:37] claim and then you walk by something
[1:59:40] else and you say whosoever will let him
[1:59:44] come and a pyol jumps in your buggy and
[1:59:47] a drill jumps in your buggy and a
[1:59:49] curling Aron jumps in your buggy and you
[1:59:52] go up to the cash reg and you say I'll
[1:59:55] take them
[1:59:56] all but the reason you came was for
[1:59:59] those names you had on those
[2:00:02] receipts but to as many as received him
[2:00:05] gave he power to come to pass the others
[2:00:09] don't even have eternal life
[2:00:12] yet you
[2:00:14] do you've come to pass you've come this
[2:00:18] far the others will be granted life
[2:00:21] because they don't want to be lost they
[2:00:23] don't want to perish so he says okay
[2:00:27] whosoever will let them come come on
[2:00:29] y'all want to come you don't want to go
[2:00:30] to hell well come on come on I'll save
[2:00:35] you but he says to the brothers
[2:00:39] Brothers I've got a family
[2:00:42] choir even the angels can't sing in
[2:00:46] it y'all
[2:00:48] ready come on
[2:00:50] brothers sisters
[2:00:53] Lord
[2:00:55] God for as much as the children are
[2:00:58] partakers of Flesh and Blood you mean to
[2:01:00] tell
[2:01:01] me they were already
[2:01:06] children if you believe your Bible
[2:01:08] that's what your Bible
[2:01:11] says for as much as the children are
[2:01:15] partakers of flesh and blood so they did
[2:01:17] not become children after they were in
[2:01:20] flesh and blood
[2:01:23] they were children before they partook
[2:01:25] of Flesh and Blood that's what your
[2:01:26] Bible
[2:01:29] says who are
[2:01:32] you that's so you are
[2:01:36] children before you was ever
[2:01:45] this SP
[2:01:50] it it was the will of
[2:01:54] God that salvation should be bought by
[2:01:59] the
[2:02:00] son for
[2:02:04] sons the will of God that salvation
[2:02:08] should be bought by the
[2:02:12] son for
[2:02:16] Sons even as some of the Egyptians came
[2:02:19] out of Egypt
[2:02:22] with
[2:02:23] Israel the
[2:02:25] handmaids that protected their children
[2:02:28] and the Bible says God built for them a
[2:02:31] house in other words gave them a
[2:02:33] posterity they never become
[2:02:36] Jews and they was never a part of the
[2:02:39] tribes but God gave them an inheritance
[2:02:43] so is it with the whosoever Will Group
[2:02:45] thank God for it we offer salvation yes
[2:02:48] praise God we're not trying to stand in
[2:02:50] nobody's way come one come
[2:02:53] on but listen friends only the children
[2:02:57] will ever be able to grasp this only
[2:03:04] children anybody here tonight beside me
[2:03:08] say Lord I want to see more clearly who
[2:03:11] I
[2:03:12] am I want to see
[2:03:15] it father as we have our hands raised up
[2:03:18] before you
[2:03:20] Lord oh Jesus thank you for this word
[2:03:23] tonight
[2:03:25] Lord as I've sat studying Lord God in
[2:03:28] the last week or so preparing this it's
[2:03:30] been burning in my
[2:03:34] heart oh Lord help
[2:03:38] us may we be able to answer who we
[2:03:43] are praise God may we be able to
[2:03:47] answer as the prophet said I am not the
[2:03:50] son of Charles and El
[2:03:52] Bram what was it he said it was another
[2:03:56] person a spot of eternal life down
[2:04:01] inside of me crying
[2:04:03] out
[2:04:06] hallelujah oh Jesus I pray that I'm
[2:04:09] speaking to a building full tonight of
[2:04:12] the same way Lord not only just the
[2:04:14] people that CH but those are streaming
[2:04:18] tonight Lord some of them maybe tonight
[2:04:21] May may be the first time that they've
[2:04:23] heard the angel and I ain't talking
[2:04:24] about me neither I'm talking about the
[2:04:26] angel of the Lord that's going around
[2:04:29] the world and calling the
[2:04:30] bride giving her the ability to
[2:04:34] hear it's evident people can listen to
[2:04:37] tapes and do it feverishly and not hear
[2:04:41] tapes because they listen to tapes and
[2:04:43] make fun of preachers which the tapes
[2:04:45] say preachers should
[2:04:47] preach so it's evident just because you
[2:04:50] hear them don't mean you hear them so we
[2:04:54] don't want to just play them we don't
[2:04:55] want to just listen to them we want to

[2:08:32] to use or which Fork but I knew which
[2:08:34] one to use tonight Carol made it simple
[2:08:37] she put one on the table well we're just
[2:08:40] kind of home folk here tonight and we're
[2:08:43] pulled up to the table so just get you
[2:08:45] one fork and your one spoon and your
[2:08:48] knife let's just cut on this lamb that's
[2:08:50] been prepared for us tonight and let's
[2:08:53] just eat and eat and
[2:08:55] eat until we eat ourselves into a body
[2:09:01] change
[2:09:04] Hallelujah I want to be more like you
[2:09:09] Lord I want to be more like
[2:09:12] you help me Lord
[2:09:15] Jesus that I can die more and more every
[2:09:19] day that I can be more more like
[2:09:22] you help these sheep father men women
[2:09:25] boys
[2:09:27] girls oh Father God that we can
[2:09:30] die that the spirit of God within our
[2:09:33] soul can become the preeminent Master
[2:09:36] the leader oh this flesh will battle us
[2:09:39] until we die or or it's changed and
[2:09:42] that's the ultimate victory Of course
[2:09:44] that we're reaching for but what you
[2:09:46] want us to do is have a victory every
[2:09:48] day leading up to the ultimate one
[2:09:51] that the first reaction when Trouble
[2:09:53] Comes is not our flesh with fear and
[2:09:55] anger and frustration but within the
[2:09:57] soul by Nature it's our natural reaction
[2:10:01] for the flesh to react first but you're
[2:10:05] trying to change us from that to where
[2:10:08] our first reaction will not be the
[2:10:10] natural man but the spirit man so
[2:10:12] instead of fearing it'll be Faith
[2:10:16] instead of anger it'll be calm instead
[2:10:19] of frustration and raise s our voice and
[2:10:22] it'll be a soft answer turn us away
[2:10:27] wrath oh
[2:10:29] Jesus We Worship You Lord
[2:10:32] God we bless you we're part of the

[2:11:09] delicate balance that we can be so
[2:11:12] hungering and thirsting after you and
[2:11:14] Satan will turn that against us and Rob
[2:11:17] us of the joy of where we currently
[2:11:19] are help us to realize we will never
[2:11:23] have that complete
[2:11:24] satisfaction until we're in that new

[2:13:57] setting us free more free service after
[2:14:02] service that we can realize who we
[2:14:06] are praise the Lord I heard the Prophet
[2:14:09] this week talking about sister shakaron
[2:14:12] and he said she had just passed that
[2:14:15] week some of the different Brothers was
[2:14:18] prophesying that she was going to live
[2:14:21] the Lord had showed brother brandom a
[2:14:23] vision years before that he saw her and
[2:14:27] she was running reaching out to him for
[2:14:31] help but he couldn't get to her and he
[2:14:34] saw the hands on the clock and he
[2:14:37] couldn't make out exactly the time but
[2:14:39] he said the voice said say between 2 and
[2:14:43] 3:00 in the morning so he saw her in the
[2:14:46] vision and she was running running
[2:14:48] trying to get to him but she couldn't
[2:14:51] couldn't reach him in time so sister
[2:14:53] shakaryan
[2:14:55] passed brother bradam is going to preach
[2:14:58] our power of
[2:15:00] transformation and he said we want to
[2:15:02] pray of course for brother Deus and and
[2:15:05] all of them that what they're going
[2:15:07] through and he said I know how to relate
[2:15:10] I lost my brother my father my wife my
[2:15:15] mother or my baby rather he said in just
[2:15:19] a few days apart and then he said these
[2:15:22] words you don't know how to relate to
[2:15:26] people unless you've gone through it
[2:15:33] yourself can y'all say that's the truth
[2:15:35] as as a as a
[2:15:37] mortal but can you imagine the Lord God
[2:15:40] saying that
[2:15:41] too I'm God and I know
[2:15:44] everything but I can't relate to them by
[2:15:48] my omnisense I can't relate to them by
[2:15:51] my
[2:15:53] omnipotence the only way I can really
[2:15:55] relate to
