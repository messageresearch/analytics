I'd like to say thank you to everyone that came out today to be with the family. offer condolences and just to be there. Sometimes you don't know what words to say and sometimes words aren't really necessary, but just showing up and taking somebody by the hand, putting your arm around them, tell them you love them, you're thinking about them, that that really does more than all the words could say. Daniel Morgan Hatton, age 43, passed away on Tuesday, November 25th, 2025 at his home in Saltville, Virginia. He was preceded in death by Bailis and Janice Counts and Paul and Bula Hatton grandparents who loved him and loved the Lord and are reunited today. I just wanted to say that Daniel Daniel was a sweetheart. He was my buddy. He was uh he had such a sense of humor. And um he'll be greatly missed. I I did want to say this when I said he was a sweetheart. He also had a sweet tooth. And uh one time he his his mom and dad was he had such a sweet tooth they had to keep him away from candy a lot of times. and and uh he came over to the to Paul and Bulas one time and and Paul he would buy candy. He would find it on sale after Halloween or whatever and he'd have bags of candy. One time Daniel got missing and uh and when they found him he was under the bed with a bag of candy and he just about ate that whole bag of candy. And uh but his mom and dad tried to keep him away from all that sugar which was a good thing. I'm going to try to sing a song this morning or this afternoon. Crossing the calm sea with Jesus, the disciples were [singing] getting concerned. [music] The wind started violently blowing, [singing] yet he was asleep at the stern. Oh, does he not care that we perish? We're helpless and we're so afraid. But Jesus arose when they called him and said to them, "Where is your faith? [singing] Because you've prayed all night. [music] And you've held on with all your might. And child, your cries [music] have awoken. [singing] the master. Oh, he knows your voice. Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice. And child, your Christ have awoken [singing] the master. It hit you without any warning. [singing] Oh, the storm of your life had begun and seeing no hope in the distance. You're frightened to know [singing] where to run. Oh, by now your vessel is filling and you're thinking that you'll surely drown. You cried out for help from the Savior and you know you can't give up now because you've prayed all night and you've held on with all your might and child your cries have awoken the master. Oh, he knows your voice. Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice and child. Oh Christ have awoken the master [music] because ye you've prayed [singing] all night and you've held on with all your might. [singing] Child your cries [music] have awoken [singing] the master. Oh, he knows your voice. Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice. And child, your cries have awoken. The master certainly wish to extend our condolences to family and friends. I know it's such a difficult time whenever we think of an untimely death of what it seems to us as we look at it. uh told brother Bobby the other day and his wife that it's not natural in the course of natural life for a parent to lose a child. For those of you that haven't experienced that, it's it's quite a a different thing. We see our parents as they age and they've lived their life and we think, well, we can kind of accept that it's time for them to go. But when we see a child or a younger person that seemingly doesn't get to live out their three score and 10 and we wonder why and we try to contemplate and understand it all. But I'm so glad when we don't understand to know that our father does understand and to know that our prayers are certainly with you all your family members. I'd like to read to you today from the book of Matthew chapter 16 25. Jesus said, "Whosoever will save his life shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" I find the words of the Lord Jesus in dealing with u the passing of this life and deaths and the value of a soul that he would go this way in looking at it in almost a terms of buying and selling. And so I'd like to speak to you for a few moments today on the economy of God. And we know in any economy, whether it's the economy of our government, the economy of Europe, the economy of Africa, we have all different classes and categories of people that live in that economy. We have the poor, we have the really poor, we have the middle class, we have the rich, we have the ultra rich. Most of us probably are born and raised and lived in that lower part of it. So hard for us to relate to the ultra rich, the way they live and the things they go through. But yet I wonder if sometimes the kingdom of God is not closer to that than what we would think ourself. And when the Lord Jesus said this, he said, "What has a man profited?" So there again, he's talking about gaining something. What does it profit you if a man would gain the whole world and lose his own soul? or what would a man give in exchange for his soul? So, every one of you here today, whenever you see something you want, a suit, a dress, your sisters, a meal, you look at it and what do you do? You evaluate the price for what you're going to get back for it. You think, "No, no, it's it's not worth it. I'm not going to pay that for that. I'm not going to do it. I'm I want to go with this. I'd rather have my money than I would have that." which is basically what we are doing with our soul. So we look at the things of the world that's around us and the value of what they can give us and then we look at our our own souls and it's it's tendency among Christians for us to look and think everybody that serves the Lord, every Christian is going to be a David. They're all going to be lion killers. They're going to be giant killers. But actually from the scriptural account, David only killed one lion in his life, one bear and one giant. So he had a whole lot more non-giant killing days than he did giant killing days. We have people like Saul, a man that was God's choice to be the first king of Israel. And yet he was a man that dealt with stubbornness. He dealt with hard-headedness. He'd struggled with trying to keep God's word and God's program. And the prophet gives to us a beautiful analogy of such. And he says, "Lot wanted the world and God separated him up his world and separated Abraham and Lot." Lot being a type of a carnal believer who didn't think these things were true. He just went on down into Sodom. didn't have spunk as he called it to be able to what would call do what was right and wrong. And I love the way he says this. All these believers, as we could go on for hours, all these were like a bunch of change in your pocket. So I just pulled out of my pocket a penny, a nickel, a dime, a quarter. All of us are familiar with this. So now I want you to get in your mind that all these believers, he said, are like change out of your pocket in God's hands. So you pull out a bunch of change. There's pennies. There's nickels, dimes, quarters, half dollars, all in coins. Now, we know that our government has determined that they're no longer going to make pennies. Yet, all of us were raised using pennies. And the last ones that they made, they actually put certain marks on them from the mint. And I'm told that in a matter of time that those pennies will be worth millions of dollars because they are special pennies. Now, it won't be long. You've already seen it probably as I have when you go through drive-throughs and whatever, we're running a shortage of pennies. So, your price will be rounded up to the next nickel, which is going to cost you more money. So, then they'll come to a spot, of course, that nickels won't be worth doing it. then they're rounded up to the next dime. Now, I wonder if sometimes believers aren't this way. We look and we think, "Oh my, every real Christian, every real believer, there'll be a David. They'll be this, that, and the other." Friends, I hate to disappoint you, but heaven is going to have all kinds of people that struggle with all kinds of things in life. [snorts] Some of them the Lord I believe even has to take them early in life when he can catch them ready. You see Saul leaving in the type of legacy that he left behind. You could never say about Saul that he was a man after God's own heart. You could never say about Omry. You could never say about Rioam. You could never say about many of the kings of Israel. You couldn't even say that about King Solomon. A man who built the house of God. A man who had such a legacy that we think was so tremendous. And yet the Bible says in his old age that he he catered of course to strange women. What the Bible called him. Married the daughter of Pharaoh, the daughter of this one, the daughter of that one. And the Bible says that his heart was not like the heart of his father David which was perfect. Wow. And yet God when this man was born, when this baby boy was born, his name was Solomon. Great name, means peace, wonderful name. But God renamed him. And God called him Jedadiah. One of the very few people in the Bible that God ever renamed and said, "He'll be my son. He'll be mine." But yet his heart was not perfect like David. So what do you think? Should we just take him out of the passages of scripture and say, "Well, because he was not like David, there's no way he's going to be saved." Oh, but he will be. So, when we look at people that we know, maybe people in our families, people in our church, people in our friends, and we look at them and said, "My, you know, they struggle with this and they struggle with that, and will they ever be a David?" More than likely not. To be honest with you, I wonder if there's any of us here today that even be a David. I'm not talking about what your mama calls you. I'm talking about what God calls you. &gt;&gt; Or would most of us be more like this little copper guy I've got in my hand. &gt;&gt; Now, it takes five of these to make this. 10 of those to make this. Takes 25 of those to make this. Anybody know off the top of your head how many it takes to make a $100? 10,000 10,000 pennies to make a $100 bill. So, what do you say? Let's just start picketing and banning all coins cuz after all, 10,000. Can you imagine if you had to buy something for $100 and you was carrying 10,000 pennies in your pocket? But are they worthless? No. You see, the grace of God is extended in so many ways in various people's lives. I myself have never been a great person. Have never had any desire to be one. What I mainly want to be is just a Christian that serves the Lord. And when my life is done and I'm rolled up like this, that hopefully the preachers can find something good to say about me. I really don't have a goal, a desire that congressmen, senators, the president, the flag would be flown at half mass. It's not your desire, is it? But when we stand before the Lord that he'll be able to look us in the face and say, "Well done." If I would measure myself by you, I'd probably be greatly disappointed. If I'd measure myself by great men, I'd be greatly disappointed. But even if I'm no more than this little copper guy right here. Now, some of y'all have probably got them in a little tin can at home or whatever it is. You better cash them in before they get of no value. But think what they've bought. Now, I'm not really that old. Not yet. But I can remember when this could buy several things. When I used to go to the store as a kid and if we took all these types of Christians out of our church and we wanted only the perfect ones, the faultless ones, the ones that man, they was constantly victorious. Every time you seen them, there's on the mountain. Mag Christians, I call them mag Christians. I've always wanted a church with mate Christians, but I get the Chinesemade ones. They got faults, they got flaws, they got troubles, they got issues, but actually I can relate to them better because I have problems. I have faults. I have issues. God bless you, brother Copper. Sister Copper, my name is Copper, too. But what I've been able to do with these the 69 years of my life when I used to go to the store at Happy Top, the little community where I lived, and I'd walk up there about a mile or so from my house and get a big thick cut baloney sandwich, with tomato, mayonnaise. I'd give $5 for one of them things right now. And I'd reach down in my pockets, me and my brother, and would pick up pop bottles along the way. You remember the pop bottles? no deposit, no return, and would trade them out and come up there. If bologoney sandwiches would been $100, I'd been an old man for I never even got one. So I wonder whenever we look at people's lives and we think well this this he he he struggled with that and this one struggle with that and but I love the analogy that the coins you pull a bunch of chains pennies nickels dimes quarters out of your pockets and you put them in God's man. So God could take a penny, a nickel, a dime, a quarter. Ignorant, unlearned people, people that struggle with all kinds of things. And yet God says, "I'll take them. I'll take them." So what should we do? Should we keep all this in our pocket? And you say, "But but it's not that much." Really? It's not that much. I understand. Yeah, I understand. Because I read about a little boy in the Bible that um he skipped out school one day and he heard about a big meeting that was going on and he went over and there was Jesus and he was doing all kinds of wonderful things and this little boy just had just enough lunch for himself just a few fishes and few loaves and as long as he had kept that in his hands that's all it would have been but he gave it to the disciples and they in turn brought it to Jesus. Jesus and Jes in his hands just lunch for hungry little boy. But in the hands of Jesus, it could feed 5,000 with all types of leftovers. So I'm asking you today, not just for Daniel now. He's lived his life and he's gone. And I believe with all of my heart we will see him again. But I'm asking you, what are you going to do with your life? Your penny, your nickel, your dime. Man, I mean, you might be great here today. You might be a $5 bill. Wow, that must be awesome to be a $5 bill. Most of my life has been in pockets of people, pockets. But if I can give this one little penny right here to the Lord Jesus of my life and let him do something with it to help others and I walk up before him that day and I long to hear these words, "Well done, my good and faithful servant." Is that what you want? I was able by the grace of God to baptize Daniel some time back when he gave his heart to the Lord, rededicate his life. Boy, he knew the word. He was around church and stuff. But Daniel, like others, struggle with this and that. Was he ever a giant killer? He may have killed more than what I knew, what his daddy mama knew. Maybe compared to some of you that live consecrated your entire life. That's wonderful. That's a wonderful testimony. I gave my heart to the Lord when I was 12. never spoke, never drank, never committed adultery, been married once. Um, don't have none of them things to deal with. But I was as lost as loss could be. None of those things that I mentioned to you wins me any merit. None of those things makes me holy. None of those things makes me pure. It's the grace of almighty God. I'm glad it didn't go that way. That means I have less scars to deal with and less in my mind. But I am no more holy or no more righteous than those of you who lived a horrible, terrible life. Because in reality, it's what winds up in his hands. I'm just so glad today that Daniel, he might not have been more than a penny. That don't sound like much. I agree. in my pocket and Daniel's pocket, it wouldn't have been much. But if Daniel could take that penny and give it over to the Lord Jesus, let me read to you what the prophet said. 100 carnal believers will never stand in the presence of a genuine Christian that's separated living in Christ Jesus. He can only take a penny's worth. That's all he's got. But see, people say, "Well, I don't believe in healing. I don't believe in these things." It's just a penny. That's a penny's worth. That's all they can buy. But I love this part. Don't stop him. Just let him alone. Just let him alone. Just a penny. That's all there'll ever be. But say, "Lord bless you, my brother." &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Can you imagine a $100 bill looking at a penny and say, "God bless you, my brother." But we tend to look down on them if they don't have the same value printed across them that we do. God help us. &gt;&gt; What are you today, friend? May God strengthen, encourage, and help your family members. I know as the days go by, you will start drawing from what I call the vault of memories. You will categorize those memories. Some will be so painful they will hurt so bad. My daughter Erica has been gone now for two years. I still can't hardly stand to look at a picture of her. She's on my phone on my text every day it comes up. Carol, Erica, and Lis. Just for me to look at a picture of her, it tears my heart out. But I know what she gave to God. It's there waiting. Each one of you have something that he's put in your hand. Couple loaves, few fishes. God may have given some of the more the rest of you a boatload. That's wonderful. But as we go along life's journey, let's see what we can do. Maybe instead of looking down on those that struggle with this and struggle with that, think, "Oh man, I don't know. I hope they'll be there. I hope they'll be there. I'm just kind of hoping I will. When you look around, you think, "Oh, boy. I'm not sure about him." Well, I don't know about this guy. Boy, that lady there, man alive. One of the greatest surprises when you get there. It ain't going to be that this one, that, and the other made it. It'll probably be that you did. &gt;&gt; That by the grace of God, he helped you with all the things you had and you were stamped a penny and you gave that to God. But with it, he made change. He helped people. You'll realize after a while how important these little pennies are. When you start paying more for your Big Mac, you're going to start paying more for your Diet Coke. You're going to start paying more for a lot of stuff. Cuz they ain't going to round it down. They're going to round it up. Why? Cuz the pennies are no longer here. We're waiting for the last elect seed to come in. So we can leave this place. But I wonder if the last one might even be a foolish virgin. A penny's worth in the economy of God. I just want to be there, don't you? We commit our brethren into the care and great fornowledge of our God. Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, as we stand here today and Lord, it's a sadness certainly, but yet Lord God, we're so grateful. Many of us pennies sitting here together and we can be thankful for what you've done for us. And we will stand beside great people on that day and think, "What have we done? What have we accomplished?" But yet you love pennies and nickels and dimes and quarters. And though it would take 10,000 pennies to make a $100 bill, yet they have their place in the economy of God. I pray father for the family, parents, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, all the loved ones, friends that are here today to say goodbye, Lord Jesus. We believe that we're looking and it's very close to us at that great day of resurrection. May there not be a one of us missing. Father, may we take the penny value out of our lives and put it in your hands and see what you can do with it. Lord, bless the family and friends, Father, as they go shortly and we place this body as a seed down into the dust of the earth. Grant it, Father, in Jesus name we pray. Amen. When we get to the verse of this song, I'd like everybody to just join in and help &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; There's [singing] a land beyond [music] the river that [singing] we call the sweet forever. [music] And [singing] we only reach that shore by face degree. [music] One by one [singing] we'll gain the portals [music] there to dwell with the immortals. [singing] And they [music] ring those golden bells for you [singing] and me. Don't you [music and singing] hear the bells now ringing? Don't you [singing] hear [music] the angels singing? Is a glory hallelujah. [singing and music] You believe in that far [music and singing] off sweet forever just beyond the shining [music] river [singing] when they ring those golden bells for [music] you and me. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; We [singing] shall [music] know no sin or sorrow in the haven of tomorrow when our mark [singing and music] shall sail beyond. on the silver sea. [music and singing] We shall only [music] know the blessing of our father's sweet [singing and music] when they ring those golden bells [music] for you [singing] and me. Don't you [music and singing] hear the bells now ringing? Don't you [singing and music] hear the angels singing tears [singing] a glory hallelujah [music] jubile [singing] [music] in that coral sweet [singing] forever [music] just beyond the shining [singing] river when [music] they ring those golden bells for you [singing] and me. [singing and music] When [singing] our [music] days shall know their number, when in [singing] death we sweetly slumber. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; And the king [music] commands the spirit to be free. [music] Never [singing] more in anguish laden we shall reach that [music and singing] lovely when they ring those [music] golden bells for you [singing] and me. Don't you hear [music] the bells now ringing? &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Don't you [music] hear the angel singing is [singing] a glory hallelujah [music] to [singing] believe in [singing and music] that for sweet forever just [singing] beyond the shining [music] river when [singing] they ring those golden [music] bells for you and me. [music] When [singing] they ring those golden bells [music] for you [singing] and me. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; There's a river somewhere called [music] Jordan. They say that [music] [music] I don't know what he's saying. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; There's a river somewhere called Jordan. They say that it's deep and [music] it's wide. [music] They say that the king and [singing] [music] the beggar on that shore will stand side by side [music] at the crossing [music] of the Jordan. Why should I be afraid? [singing] There will be someone there who loves me, will guide me [music] across the river [music] to endless joys [music] above. That river [music] is so dark and stormy. [music] It will pass like a [singing] dream in the night. [music] My soul will awaken [music] in that morning. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; to regions of endless [singing] delight at the crossing [music] of the Jordan. [music] Why should I be afraid? [singing] There'll be someone there who loves me to guide [music] me across the river [music] to endless [music] choice above. [singing] [music] You endless joy above. [music] Brother Joe, he was a little nervous and he said he forgot to read the rest of the obituary. So, he asked me to do it before I close in prayer. If you've ever stood here, you understand how nerve-wracking it can be. So, we'll give him a little bit of grace uh in those things. Daniel was survived by his son Patrick Hayden and his wife Alexis and of course his parents Bobby and Sherry Counts Hayden, his brothers Jonathan Hayden and his wife Cara, David Hayden and his wife Jordan James or Jamie Hatton and Philip Hayden, his sisters are Grace, husband Matthew Carter and Shannon Riley and several ne nieces and of course several nephews as well. I'll say this before I pray. I thought about brother Donnie as he was preaching and how accurate it is. And you know, as a pastor myself, you go for a while and and God just expands your vision into the scriptures and sometimes you think you you've got it figured out. But there's one thing I've come to understand. I think the grace of God is so far be [clears throat] vast and so beyond what we can actually see and fully understand. You know, we like to see somebody who spends 20 or 30 years serving the Lord and and in our mind we we understand and we say, "Okay, well, they made it." But the thief on the cross, as he was preaching, that come to my mind that the thief on the cross, all he said is, "Remember me, Lord." And that was it. He said, "Today you'll be with me in paradise." Because it's when the heart is ready, and that's what counts. And the beautiful part is only God knows when the heart's ready. So we just have to say, you know what, the grace of God is the grace of God. I need it as much in my life as you need it in yours. Thought this morning about 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 where Paul said he would not have us ignorant, not have us understanding, that we have no sorrow as those or we we sorrow not as those who have no hope. And I thought, Lord, how beautiful it is that just beyond the veil where our eyes cannot see it, there's more of them than there are of us. just beyond the veil. If God would open your eyes, even in this building right now, there's far more than what you realize. It looks like there's just a few, but there's so much more of us. And we've got more to look forward on that side than we do on this side. Let's bow our heads and have a word of prayer. Lord Jesus, we come to you, Father, and we just want to say thank you for this day. It's a day, Lord, that's um difficult. We really at times don't have the words Lord to put into our feelings. But yet you see our tears. It's a language that you understand. We sew Lord in tears and we reap in joy. We're asking you, Father, that you would come, Lord, that you would bring a comfort. Lord, we hear these words in theory. We read them from the scripture and we say how good they are. But until you live through it, Lord, until you have to ask for you to be the comforter, when there seems to be no comfort, when the days go and it gets hard, we're asking that you would come and comfort the near family here, Lord. And it's a [snorts] loss, Lord. I'm sure it was a loss to to Daniel's friends, those who knew him, probably knew him and where he lived in a way that we didn't. And I'm sure you had a heart of compassion for them as well, as we all do. Lord, we in our own way, we have our hearts of compassion. We ask you, Father, as you have chosen to take him from this life, but not from your presence. We ask, Lord, that you would bring a comfort to all those who know him, a comfort to the family. Lord, we just commit him, Lord, as our brother said, as a seed into the ground that one day we might see in a resurrection. We'll see that, Lord. We believe around the corner will be so soon, Father. How can it be with the signs of the times that we're seeing, Lord? Well, whenever that would be, Lord, we're choosing with by faith, Lord. Our Christian walk is a complete walk of faith. We we believe when what we cannot understand, we just by faith believe you and your word. So we're asking for mercy and grace and help for the family today. In Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. God bless you. The funeral directors will come.
