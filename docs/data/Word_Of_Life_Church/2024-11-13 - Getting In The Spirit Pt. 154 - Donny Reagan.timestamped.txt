[38:32] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[38:36] every man to profit and it's not p r o p
[38:39] h t but profit and that is to make
[38:42] something grow or as you understand in a
[38:46] business you don't start a business so
[38:47] you can do it for charity you don't
[38:49] start a business so you can lose money
[38:52] you start it so you can make money well
[38:55] when God gives spiritual ual gifts
[38:58] they're to be a
[39:00] profitable
[39:02] spiritual
[39:04] endowment so God wants it to profit very
[39:07] first verse but the manifestation of the
[39:09] spirit is given to every man to profit
[39:12] with all for to one is given by the
[39:17] spirit the word of wisdom now this is
[39:21] not Rama but logos the word of wisdom to

[39:41] gifts plural of healing so there's not
[39:45] just one there's multiple Gifts of
[39:49] healing by The Same Spirit to another
[39:54] the working of Miracles now not
[39:57] believing in Miracles but actually the
[40:00] working of Miracles is given to some
[40:04] people so God in them will have them to
[40:08] lay their hands on people or sometimes
[40:10] just to speak to them and tell them be
[40:13] healed receive your healing whatever it
[40:15] is and that is a working of Miracles now
[40:20] notice how that he identifies every one
[40:22] of these is given by the spirit of God
[40:25] they're not man-made we don't learn them
[40:27] we don't wish we had them and try to get
[40:30] them ourselves to another the working of
[40:33] Miracles to another prophecy to another
[40:39] Discerning of spirits notice now it's
[40:42] not the word commonly used
[40:46] discernment but Discerning of spirits
[40:51] keep it in its proper connotation and it
[40:54] brings a whole new meaning to it to
[40:56] another the
[40:58] Discerning of
[41:00] spirits to another diverse kinds of
[41:06] tongues now diverse means variegated
[41:10] it's many different kinds so it would be
[41:14] languages both human and
[41:17] Angelic so it's diverse kinds of tongues
[41:20] so that's given to People by the spirit
[41:23] of God to another the interpretation
[41:27] of tongues I love verse 11 but all these
[41:33] workers that one and the self-same
[41:38] spirit dividing to every
[41:42] man
[41:44] severally as he will so it's not
[41:46] according to the people who receive them
[41:49] by their will but according to the
[41:51] spirit of
[41:53] God and the church said amen praise the
[41:56] Lord I wonder how many's got a request
[41:58] on your heart tonight that you'd like to
[42:00] signify or i' hold that request on your
[42:03] heart also like to remember brother
[42:06] Michael Carter in prayer and uh heard
[42:09] from him today and he's having to take
[42:11] some treatments some radiation in his
[42:14] back it took some last week and some
[42:16] more this week so we want to remember
[42:18] our brother that our father would just
[42:20] move for him and his great time of need
[42:23] also have some prayer claes here tonight
[42:25] as
[42:25] well Lord Jesus we count it such an
[42:28] honor that we could be assembled here
[42:30] tonight father in your presence and not
[42:34] only just with you because we could have
[42:36] actually gathered in your presence in
[42:38] our bedroom or in our closet at home or
[42:42] in our living room but there's something
[42:45] about us being able to gather together
[42:48] with people of like Precious face and
[42:52] we're grateful that we have that
[42:53] opportunity Lord that we can do so we
[42:56] pray father that we would take advantage
[42:58] of it every time that we can to be able
[43:01] to come and may we cherish it may we
[43:04] love it and just the prophet said that
[43:07] his people at his church loved one
[43:09] another so much at a certain time frame
[43:11] there that they went through at the
[43:13] brandham Tabernacle and when it would
[43:15] come to closing out the service and them
[43:18] leaving they would just grab one another
[43:20] and
[43:21] weep after the Sunday service because it
[43:25] would be till Wednesday before they'd be
[43:27] able to see one another again they had
[43:30] such love for each other I pray father
[43:34] that you'd help us Lord that we could
[43:37] feel that way about one another father
[43:40] that we could so love each other and
[43:42] realize that we are not complete without
[43:46] our brothers and sisters not only in our
[43:48] local assembly but of those of like
[43:50] Precious Faith around the world even
[43:53] those that are in the sixth Dimension as
[43:55] well father you saw the hands that were
[43:57] uplifted the request what they had on
[44:00] their heart Lord I pray over them I pray
[44:02] over these prayer claws dear God you see
[44:06] what they're going for in the name of
[44:07] Jesus would you move and meet these
[44:10] needs help me tonight Lord as I look
[44:12] into your word help me to be able to
[44:15] move aside and speak through me the
[44:16] words of life I ask in the name of the
[44:19] Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you
[44:22] Saints you may be
[44:25] seated and believes in the gifts of the
[44:32] Spirit oh my mic must have cut out on me
[44:36] how many believes in the gifts of the
[44:39] Spirit I do oh okay all right that's
[44:43] that's I thought that's what yall should
[44:44] be doing raising your
[44:47] hands you know the gifts are a
[44:51] very
[44:53] difficult and touchy thing sometimes
[44:59] really in some ways it shouldn't be and
[45:02] then in other ways you think that it's
[45:05] pretty inevitable that it's going to be
[45:09] there's very few things given to us by
[45:12] God that have been so controversial down
[45:16] Through the Ages Grace has been argued
[45:20] about uh Mercy has been argued about who
[45:24] would get it and how far could you go or
[45:26] you couldn't get any more of it you know
[45:28] and all that uh but when it really comes
[45:31] down to a lot of the um Charisma type of
[45:35] things which is where the Greek word
[45:37] comes from the word gift Charisma which
[45:39] is
[45:40] charismatic it's been one of the most
[45:43] controversial things that God gave to
[45:46] the New Testament Church sad in one way
[45:51] yet you can see why that Satan would
[45:54] want to attack them now these gifts that
[45:57] we're that we've just read about tonight
[45:59] are different than the ministerial gifts
[46:02] which are offices which is not the same
[46:06] thing as the gifts of the Spirit the
[46:08] word here spirit is Numa Numa and it's a
[46:13] word that we get those of you that are
[46:15] familiar with pneumatic
[46:18] tools this is the Greek word that it
[46:21] comes from Numa so pneumatic it's a tool
[46:26] that is used for for something and the
[46:27] Greek word there is a gift as God gives
[46:31] to people to minister inside the body so
[46:35] we know of course that the five full
[46:36] ministry that's what they are but they
[46:39] too are a gift and it's no wonder why
[46:43] then really that Satan of all the
[46:45] messages that have been down through
[46:47] time that Satan in the last greatest
[46:50] message would try to attack the use the
[46:54] benefit whether it's even needed or not
[46:57] of the fivefold ministry and it would be
[46:59] the message of restoration that he wants
[47:01] to do it well to me that proves that
[47:04] it's very very much needful and yet
[47:07] Satan any of God's gifts Satan hates
[47:10] them you have to understand that in the
[47:14] very beginning when God started this New
[47:16] Testament Church that Satan was unclear
[47:20] of what God was going to do the Lord
[47:23] Jesus had given a little bit of word
[47:26] about it but it was still unclear as to
[47:30] what it was going to be now he saw the
[47:33] Lord as he called these Apostles that
[47:37] was a new word entirely new in the New
[47:40] Testament never used in the Old
[47:42] Testament so he called them Apostles and
[47:46] he called them disciples the word
[47:49] disciple was not so much a new one uh
[47:51] because some of the rabbis had also used
[47:54] a similar word in the Greek language in
[47:55] the Aramaic so so it was a similar word
[47:58] but Satan was totally caught off guard
[48:02] that the Lord Jesus had said I've chosen
[48:05] you and you are to be my Apostles and
[48:08] Satan thought wow Apostles I like it so
[48:13] what what's this all mean I don't know
[48:15] exactly what he's doing here this is
[48:16] something totally new and he could see
[48:20] then that when Jesus sent him out in
[48:23] Matthew 10 and he sent him out by twos
[48:26] and that Jesus had given them power and
[48:29] authority to be able to heal the sick
[48:32] cast out devils and Satan saw that there
[48:36] was something different about this power
[48:39] that were given to these men now you've
[48:41] heard it preached before and it's in the
[48:44] in the New Testament the word the Greek
[48:46] word exusia and then also dunamus now
[48:50] dunamus is something that you have by
[48:53] inherit nature but exusia is something
[48:57] that's given to you by someone who is
[49:00] above you and they delegate to you an
[49:03] element of of authority to do these
[49:06] certain things so you're not doing it
[49:09] because you have an inherit nature
[49:12] you're doing it because your boss said
[49:15] you could do it so that's exactly what
[49:18] Jesus did in Matthew 10 so Jesus gives
[49:21] them exusia Authority and said go heal
[49:25] the sick go cast out Devils they were
[49:28] not born again now they did not have the
[49:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's under the
[49:33] exusia order that false anointed ones
[49:36] are able to do the same thing in this
[49:39] day not that it is an inherit Nature by
[49:43] a new birth or a nature change so Jesus
[49:47] sent them out and they did it now Satan
[49:50] was learning so he thought my this this
[49:52] is incredible so they can go out and
[49:55] actually do the same things that he did
[49:59] but they don't have the same thing he
[50:02] has how can that work excuse you
[50:06] delegated authority so he could see that
[50:09] the the apostles were gifted above the
[50:13] other people now remember in that
[50:15] original 12 was Judas es scariot Simon's
[50:19] son and Jesus said have not I chose 12
[50:22] of you and one of you is a devil but
[50:25] remember in the church book The Prophet
[50:27] lays it out for us that Judas Ministry
[50:30] was not weaker nor was it inferior to
[50:35] the other 11 so one's a devil and 11
[50:38] more are elected but yet looking at them
[50:42] and judging them by miraculous maybe
[50:45] even by understanding because Judas
[50:48] shared a certain knowledge of the
[50:51] message of the day so no doubt Judas
[50:54] could preach and talk talk about
[50:57] reconciliation Redemption Grace you know
[51:00] whatever more that the rest of the
[51:01] Apostles preach Judas could preach it
[51:04] and he wouldn't have to take a backseat
[51:06] to none of them he could heal the sick
[51:10] cast out Devils whatever they would do
[51:13] and the Devils Jesus said I beheld Satan
[51:16] as Lightning cast down out of heaven and
[51:20] the disciples come back and rejoice in
[51:22] Matthew 10 because the Devils were
[51:25] subject to them Judas was rejoicing
[51:28] right along with him so there was a
[51:30] devil casting out
[51:33] Devils but he didn't do it under the
[51:37] anointing or under his nature he done it
[51:40] under exusia
[51:43] Authority oh you're quiet on me that but
[51:47] now think Judas rejoiced as well because
[51:51] he had spoke to them devils and them
[51:54] Devils had left people but he didn't do
[51:56] it because of his nature he did it
[51:59] because Jesus gave him the the authority
[52:02] to do so so he was gifted he was called
[52:06] he was anointed and he was a
[52:09] devil he shared knowledge of the
[52:12] Mysteries of the kingdom of God and he
[52:16] was still a
[52:17] devil but the Lord chose to start out
[52:21] the New Testament was something totally
[52:23] different than the old now remember he
[52:26] chose a priesthood in the beginning
[52:28] actually it was to be under the
[52:31] abrahamic Covenant that God would allow
[52:34] the firstborn son and he would be the
[52:39] priest inherit he would be the one that
[52:41] would go to God then it would be the
[52:45] father and then of course God
[52:48] substituted the tribe of Levi and let
[52:51] them be the ones that would be the
[52:53] priest so it was automatic if you daddy
[52:56] was a priest you're going to be one your
[52:59] son's going to be one it was handed down
[53:01] from one generation to another to
[53:03] another but God said I'm not doing that
[53:06] in the New Testament in the New
[53:08] Testament all of my men will receive a
[53:12] personal call from
[53:16] me cuz your daddy's a preacher don't
[53:18] mean you're supposed to be one right
[53:21] that's right because every God call man
[53:25] now some people think their preachers
[53:27] when they're not every preacher is not a
[53:31] godall man amen that's right but God
[53:35] calls every individual that's going to
[53:38] preach the gospel God himself calls them
[53:41] they don't go by a feeling they don't go
[53:44] by a dream they don't go by well I've
[53:47] had this told to me my goodness I don't
[53:49] know how many times over the decades
[53:51] brother Donnie I I I I was reading my
[53:53] Bible before church and you or or My
[53:56] Pastor got up and preached for the same
[53:58] thing I felt like I'm called to preach
[54:00] and I tell them all the same story that
[54:02] same situation happens to my wife and I
[54:05] know she ain't called although she was
[54:08] called out in Pentecost by preachers who
[54:11] had discernment and told her she was
[54:13] called to
[54:16] preach she was also called out by
[54:19] another preacher in Pentecost who
[54:21] supposedly had discernment and he told
[54:23] her she had cancer
[54:27] I'll tell you what that preacher was
[54:29] anointed with
[54:31] demons no doubt that man was sincere but
[54:35] he was anointed with a demon out of hell
[54:39] to try to get my wife to accept that but
[54:43] she refused it that's what you need to
[54:46] do when preachers call you out and tell
[54:48] you things that are contrary to the word
[54:51] amen praise the Lord would stop some of
[54:54] this stuff if we' do it
[54:56] well how in the world will I get off on
[54:58] that oh my now watch what God is going
[55:02] to do is going to be totally different
[55:05] than the levitical order totally
[55:08] different than what God had done for
[55:10] thousands of years dealing with Abraham
[55:13] Isaac Jacob Joseph then on down then it
[55:16] would come to the patriarchal Avenue
[55:18] then it would come to the levitical
[55:20] order but God interrupted all of that
[55:23] now he called Peter and Peter was
[55:25] married we don't know if Peter had
[55:27] children or not but if they were there's
[55:29] none of them by name that's been given
[55:32] that after Peter passed away then his
[55:34] son got the keys that wasn't the way God
[55:37] done it so Paul was not even a married
[55:39] man so there was no Apostolic succession
[55:44] in the way that it was in the Old
[55:46] Testament so God now is going to do the
[55:49] ministration of the New Testament
[55:52] totally by Divine gifts now those Divine
[55:57] gifts will not come by mother wanting
[56:00] her son to be a preacher it will not
[56:04] come by a grandfather and he has this
[56:07] certain special favorite grandson and he
[56:11] just knows beyond a shadow of a doubt
[56:13] that that grandson's going to be a
[56:15] preacher and he starts telling him from
[56:17] the time he's five or six years old
[56:19] you're going to be a preacher you're
[56:21] going to be a preacher you're going to
[56:22] be a preacher you're going to be a
[56:24] preacher there's been many a person that
[56:26] has put their grandson or their son
[56:30] under a absolute torment for years of
[56:33] their life when God never called them
[56:35] but mama daddy grandpa grandma told them
[56:39] there's going to be a preacher come on
[56:41] now don't get quiet on me but you know
[56:43] what if God himself don't call you
[56:45] forget
[56:47] it for those of you that attended
[56:49] brother Lewis La Funeral Service you
[56:52] heard a little excerpt of a clip that
[56:55] was played in
[56:57] 1961 that was whenever his parents took
[57:00] him and his brother Johnny to the
[57:02] Tabernacle and brother brandham prayed
[57:05] over them and referred to them as little
[57:08] preachers or something like that you
[57:11] know brother Lewis that that taunted our
[57:14] brother tormented him for
[57:19] years and he come to me and said brother
[57:21] Donnie if I fail God if I miss god
[57:24] brother Brandon prayed over me or said
[57:26] those words over me that I miss somehow
[57:30] God I said brother Lewis if you would
[57:33] study dedications the way I have over
[57:35] the years you would find out nine times
[57:38] out of 10 when a boy was coming up to be
[57:41] dedicated brother Brandon would pray or
[57:44] hope or ask God to make him a preacher
[57:47] you know why ca to him that could be one
[57:50] of the greatest things that God could do
[57:52] for a man so that lets you know these
[57:55] anti- preachers belong that say they
[57:57] believe the message don't brother random
[58:00] wanted his own boys to be called to be
[58:03] preachers cuz to him that was the
[58:05] highest order that there was pressing
[58:08] play is
[58:10] Antichrist to say that replaces God's
[58:14] gifts well you might as well go ahead
[58:15] and get with me now I'm going to have
[58:17] church with or without you to say that
[58:20] pressing play does away with God's
[58:22] Ministry is
[58:24] Antichrist you show me where God's
[58:26] Prophet taught it and I'll preach the
[58:28] same thing but until you do I'm going to
[58:31] blast that demonic devil out of the pits
[58:35] of hell because that's where it comes
[58:38] from it's not Apostolic it's not
[58:41] according to the message it's from hell
[58:45] I'll tell you the devil would like
[58:47] nothing better for every God called
[58:49] preacher to sat down and stop preaching
[58:53] and press play and Press Play service I
[58:56] your service if I feel led to play a
[58:59] tape I will feel led by the spirit of
[59:02] God I don't have a headquarters that
[59:04] tells me what tape to play I don't have
[59:07] a headquarters or a bishop over our
[59:09] church come on somebody a nicolate and
[59:13] spirit that sends out a text and says
[59:15] we're playing this at a certain certain
[59:17] time I don't get those texts I get my
[59:21] inspiration from the Holy Ghost the same
[59:24] holy ghost that hears you cry and pray
[59:27] and here's you and your wife discussing
[59:29] certain things and the same Holy Ghost
[59:32] will anoint me to get up and preach the
[59:35] very same thing you all talked
[59:37] about well come on somebody that's the
[59:41] God I'm serving tonight and I believe
[59:44] he's the same yesterday today and
[59:48] forever well praise the Lord now the
[59:51] Lord Jesus was the one who decided to
[59:54] set the order of of the church and he
[59:57] chose the apostolic order the apostolic
[1:00:02] order so he would choose the apostles
[1:00:05] first he did not choose pastors first he
[1:00:09] did not choose evangelists he did not
[1:00:11] even choose prophets first as far as
[1:00:14] major Church AIDS Messengers he could
[1:00:17] have chose Paul first if he had wanted
[1:00:19] to Paul was on the earth that was not
[1:00:21] the order the order is going to be
[1:00:25] Apostolic order which is what Satan is
[1:00:28] against in and around this message so
[1:00:31] what Satan wants to do is replace Jesus
[1:00:34] on choice and I remember the people
[1:00:36] around the message who fight preachers
[1:00:39] they're not they're not fighting me
[1:00:41] they're not fighting these preachers
[1:00:42] here in the church they're actually
[1:00:44] fighting the Lord Jesus himself well
[1:00:48] good luck with that is all I can say he
[1:00:52] was the one who chose to make it this
[1:00:55] way if you don't like him go to him and
[1:00:58] complain about him and get off of my
[1:01:01] back about it okay just go to the man
[1:01:04] himself and say Jesus I don't like it
[1:01:06] because you chose preachers I just don't
[1:01:08] like it well that's what he chose and
[1:01:11] others might say I don't like speaking
[1:01:13] in tongues and I don't like that well
[1:01:14] that's your problem the Lord Jesus is
[1:01:17] the one who said these things in the
[1:01:21] church and Word of Life said oh my
[1:01:24] brother Donnie I've had a lot our
[1:01:26] problems with the gift and I've seen a
[1:01:27] lot of this that and the other so have I
[1:01:30] but that don't change God's word come on
[1:01:33] somebody there ain't no need for us to
[1:01:35] hide behind scarecrows and say well this
[1:01:37] and your claim that they spoke in
[1:01:39] tongues and this and said this and that
[1:01:40] I'll tell you one thing I don't even
[1:01:42] want nothing to do why in the world
[1:01:43] would we not want anything to do with
[1:01:46] God's
[1:01:48] word praise the Lord now in this in the
[1:01:52] office calls a person the prophet tells
[1:01:56] us could actually have more than one
[1:01:58] call in his life well it's the same way
[1:02:02] with the spiritual dispensing now what
[1:02:05] it is it's like the seven rainbow colors
[1:02:08] the seven Church AG Messengers all
[1:02:10] dealing with the church comes through
[1:02:11] sevens and fives and it's like the
[1:02:13] spirit of God can give a man like Paul
[1:02:16] dealt with him when he said that if
[1:02:18] there's someone that speaks in tongues
[1:02:20] and the church if there is no
[1:02:22] interpreter then let them hold their
[1:02:24] peace so it would be as if though you
[1:02:26] know I get done preaching here tonight
[1:02:28] and someone would stand up and start
[1:02:29] speaking in tongues and oh my it might
[1:02:32] really genuin be the Holy Ghost and they
[1:02:34] are so fired up and so charged up you
[1:02:38] know but there's nobody to interpret so
[1:02:41] people just leave and you know it kind
[1:02:42] of gets really quiet and creates that
[1:02:44] odd something that it always does and
[1:02:47] then you think okay what what's supposed
[1:02:49] to happen here well according to what
[1:02:50] Paul said that individual unless there
[1:02:53] be an interpreter is to hold her peace
[1:02:55] amen
[1:02:56] is that right now unless Paul said that
[1:03:00] they should pray that they could
[1:03:02] interpret themselves so then a person
[1:03:05] could have speaking in tongues and they
[1:03:08] could also have the ability to interpret
[1:03:12] their tongues but if they only have
[1:03:15] speaking in tongues then their speaking
[1:03:18] in tongues must be coupled together in
[1:03:21] order to be used by God in the ministry
[1:03:25] of the Church they need another person
[1:03:29] to work together with them to make their
[1:03:32] gift complete you that you understand
[1:03:35] that so speaking in tongues it's awesome
[1:03:38] it's wonderful so you're alone with God
[1:03:40] you're praying you know you're going
[1:03:42] down the road or whatever it is you
[1:03:43] might even come up around the Altar and
[1:03:45] you're just praying and boy you're just
[1:03:47] having a blessed wonderful time but you
[1:03:49] know what those tongues are not for
[1:03:51] interpretation if there's no interpreter
[1:03:54] there or you yourself do not interpret
[1:03:57] now watch let's go back through this
[1:03:59] again in verse 7 but the manifestation
[1:04:01] of the spirit is given to every man to
[1:04:04] profit with all so the manifestation of
[1:04:08] the gifts are not to make some uh more
[1:04:12] known than others the manifestation of
[1:04:15] the gifts are not to make some more
[1:04:17] popular more famous it has nothing to do
[1:04:21] with making you and I anything but
[1:04:25] subject Ive servants to the will of
[1:04:27] God now this is one thing I look for in
[1:04:31] gifted people is what do they do with
[1:04:35] these gifts do they use them in such a
[1:04:39] way that always points these fingers
[1:04:43] right like
[1:04:47] this praise the
[1:04:50] Lord do they have a problem with
[1:04:53] pointing to other gifted people people
[1:04:56] as well as thems or are their gifts
[1:04:59] always superior their miracles are more
[1:05:02] miraculous which I'm not sure how that
[1:05:04] works exactly their Divine healings are
[1:05:06] more
[1:05:10] Divine now you see I have a problem with
[1:05:14] that attitude now I know some of the
[1:05:16] message people don't want to hear it but
[1:05:18] that's a straight up Pentecostal that's
[1:05:19] all it is it's just outright flesh that
[1:05:23] is contrary to the Bible we do believe
[1:05:26] the Bible around in here right but the
[1:05:29] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[1:05:31] every man to profit with all for to one
[1:05:35] is given by the Spirit by the spirit the
[1:05:40] word of wisdom the word of
[1:05:44] wisdom now notice this is the most
[1:05:48] Superior
[1:05:50] gift of all nine
[1:05:59] huh I mean I kind of thought that it'd
[1:06:01] be a little bit quiet in here tonight
[1:06:02] but I didn't realize you could hear a
[1:06:04] mouse walking across cotton
[1:06:07] balls notice this the prophet said love
[1:06:10] God's love it'll take to place of
[1:06:14] speaking in
[1:06:15] tongues and that's all right he said
[1:06:18] it'll take to place of gifts wonders and
[1:06:21] signs and everything else and if you
[1:06:23] haven't got love to accompanies that
[1:06:27] what good do the signs do you God tries
[1:06:30] to do it across the nation but it
[1:06:33] wouldn't work the greatest of all the
[1:06:37] gifts is
[1:06:39] wisdom the
[1:06:41] second is
[1:06:44] knowledge well it's
[1:06:47] apparent from a lot of what I've seen
[1:06:50] not only just in Pentecost but in the
[1:06:52] ranks of the message that the three on
[1:06:55] the the bottom of the
[1:06:57] list are the ones that so many people
[1:07:00] want which shows they don't have number
[1:07:03] one
[1:07:08] yet now you can do whatever you want to
[1:07:11] with my words okay just you know just do
[1:07:13] whatever you want to with my words but
[1:07:15] if I were you I would be careful when
[1:07:17] I'm reading scripture and reading from a
[1:07:20] Vindicated prophet's
[1:07:22] message now what so the greatest one
[1:07:26] then is wisdom the greatest of all the
[1:07:28] gifts is wisdom the second is knowledge
[1:07:33] if you haven't got knowledge you haven't
[1:07:36] got wisdom how to control your
[1:07:42] knowledge what Good's your knowledge
[1:07:44] going to
[1:07:45] do you see what I mean seek the first
[1:07:50] things
[1:07:52] first wow so we're at the bottom
[1:07:56] seeking for the bottom
[1:07:59] first or the ones on the bottom the last
[1:08:02] of the
[1:08:03] list are the things that are deemed so
[1:08:06] super
[1:08:07] spiritual and wisdom the
[1:08:10] first how many sermons you ever heard
[1:08:13] preached on
[1:08:19] it oh it's getting warm in here ain't it
[1:08:22] man
[1:08:26] oh my we've gone after gifts we've gone
[1:08:30] after this we've gone after that because
[1:08:32] the supernatural was done but
[1:08:39] brother don't seek
[1:08:44] gifts don't seek favor with denomination
[1:08:47] you imagine putting that in the same
[1:08:50] sentence seek the love of God do it
[1:08:57] Brethren now brother Donnie are you
[1:08:59] saying then that we should not
[1:09:01] absolutely have no gifts no I'm not
[1:09:04] saying that at all I'm saying there's a
[1:09:07] proper order by which we seek them I
[1:09:12] believe if we would have perfect
[1:09:15] love perfect love would produce perfect
[1:09:19] gifts as a matter of fact I just quoted
[1:09:22] to you a quote I didn't give you the
[1:09:24] city in the day
[1:09:26] but perfect love would produce perfect
[1:09:29] gifts so what then will we have if we
[1:09:33] have imperfect
[1:09:37] love nine times out of 10 imperfect
[1:09:41] gifts which the prophet said can be
[1:09:45] questioned which will cause
[1:09:48] problems which is probably what a lot of
[1:09:50] us have seen through the years that's
[1:09:52] why somebody quiet on my that you've
[1:09:53] been burnt by them now if you'll notice
[1:09:56] the routine of the gifts again he says
[1:09:58] the first is a gift of
[1:10:01] wisdom thank you the first is the gift
[1:10:04] of wisdom that is the best
[1:10:07] gift of the
[1:10:10] group anybody here tonight know what the
[1:10:13] gift of wisdom
[1:10:20] is if we don't have wisdom we don't know
[1:10:24] how to use knowledge now watch he goes
[1:10:26] again in this same thinking is the
[1:10:28] second gift and we can't use the second
[1:10:31] gift without wisdom how we going to use
[1:10:33] the last gift interpretation or next to
[1:10:37] the last speaking in tongues our Zeal
[1:10:41] has eat
[1:10:43] up our
[1:10:48] wisdom so our Zeal for the
[1:10:52] gifts has eat up our wisdom
[1:10:55] wiom which is the best one of
[1:11:00] all praise the Lord now I've heard it
[1:11:04] through the years and I'm sure we'll
[1:11:06] continue to hear it that Brothers have
[1:11:09] said well you know brother brandham
[1:11:11] taught those things and that was for his
[1:11:13] church only and all of that and our
[1:11:15] church is
[1:11:18] Sovereign and at our church we're going
[1:11:21] to do it this way and that way I I want
[1:11:24] someone
[1:11:26] here or someone that'll hear
[1:11:28] this to show me where any church in this
[1:11:33] message has the right to claim
[1:11:36] sovereignty over God's
[1:11:41] word if you are saying you are sovereign
[1:11:45] over God's word you are a
[1:11:52] you are a prosper
[1:11:57] stitute you are committing fornication
[1:12:00] with the
[1:12:03] devil you show me where God's Prophet
[1:12:06] ever said any church including his own
[1:12:10] had sovereignty over the word of God
[1:12:14] friends that's what the Catholic Church
[1:12:15] does they say the Bible don't matter the
[1:12:18] denomination say it don't matter don't
[1:12:20] you understand where the message people
[1:12:22] are going many of them they're claiming
[1:12:24] sovereignty over scripture or
[1:12:26] sovereignty over the teaching of the
[1:12:28] message of the hour well we know the
[1:12:30] prophet we know the prophet Tau that we
[1:12:32] know he Tau it but this is the way we do
[1:12:34] it at our church but it ain't the way
[1:12:36] we're going to do it at ours not as long
[1:12:39] as I'm the pastor anyhow our sovereignty
[1:12:43] comes in under the headship of the word
[1:12:46] of God not against
[1:12:52] it well praise the Lord
[1:12:57] oh Jesus here we go y'all going to stand
[1:12:59] with me now right hey I'm taking my stem
[1:13:02] of the word will you taken
[1:13:05] yours now notice he says our Zeal has
[1:13:09] eat up our wisdom and our Zeal for our
[1:13:12] denominations and our enthusiasm has eat
[1:13:16] up the wisdom off the vine Brotherly
[1:13:20] Love now let's go back to where Paul
[1:13:23] says this in verse 8 for to one is given
[1:13:25] by the spirit the word the logos of
[1:13:30] wisdom let's look at the meaning of this
[1:13:33] word
[1:13:35] Sophia
[1:13:37] Sophia
[1:13:38] Supreme
[1:13:41] intelligence such as
[1:13:44] belongs to
[1:13:46] God it ain't no wonder that takes
[1:13:49] precedence over speaking in
[1:13:53] tongues so would the Supreme
[1:13:55] intelligence of God ever lead any of us
[1:14:00] to step over the top of the word of God
[1:14:04] or the word of the message of the hour
[1:14:06] it proves we're lacking wisdom when we
[1:14:10] think that we are superior and our
[1:14:14] understanding to the seventh Church age
[1:14:17] messenger we
[1:14:19] lack wisdom
[1:14:22] amen we need more Sophia
[1:14:27] praise the
[1:14:28] Lord Supreme
[1:14:30] intelligence such as belongs to God the
[1:14:34] wisdom of God as events in forming and
[1:14:38] executing counsels in the formation and
[1:14:42] government of the world and the
[1:14:47] scriptures so the first thing Paul said
[1:14:50] now before you all start focusing on
[1:14:52] tongues interpretation
[1:14:55] prophecy all that first get wisdom so
[1:14:58] you'll understand how in the formation
[1:15:02] of these gifts disciplinary action how
[1:15:05] you going to deal with them this is why
[1:15:08] we've got a lot of the stuff we've got
[1:15:10] people hit Miss hit Miss hit
[1:15:14] Miss and if you call them on the carpet
[1:15:16] they get mad and leave oh
[1:15:20] my don't tell me I dealt with that when
[1:15:22] I first came to Happy Valley years ago
[1:15:25] some of You original people that was
[1:15:27] there when I came there things that was
[1:15:28] going on things being said thus sayith
[1:15:30] the Lord this thus sayith the Lord that
[1:15:32] well whenever I was visiting as a
[1:15:34] visiting Minister I didn't say nothing
[1:15:36] about it but when you all voted me in
[1:15:39] and the deacons told you all brother
[1:15:41] Donnie will not be able to be run
[1:15:43] brother Donnie will not be able to be
[1:15:45] controlled so they give you a heads up
[1:15:47] for you newcomers is come in well you
[1:15:49] come in after the ship done already
[1:15:51] sailed so that was the oses that I took
[1:15:54] this church I could be led by the spirit
[1:15:57] of God preach the word of God is that
[1:15:59] right some of You original ones is that
[1:16:02] right is that what you were told and
[1:16:04] look do we want to change from that now
[1:16:06] because we're all these years later down
[1:16:08] the road do we want to say well look at
[1:16:10] what is goddess it's brought us a lot of
[1:16:12] trouble it has caused us trouble but
[1:16:14] it's brought us a lot of Supernatural
[1:16:16] too it's brought us a lot of Miracles
[1:16:18] and it's brought us a lot of healing
[1:16:20] it's brought us a lot of Joy it's done a
[1:16:22] lot of great things for us I'll choose
[1:16:24] that that way
[1:16:27] myself now notice the importance and the
[1:16:30] value of wisdom so this now it's not
[1:16:34] man-made wisdom and it's not the wisdom
[1:16:37] that comes with old age by being around
[1:16:41] a long time you know and you get you get
[1:16:43] wisdom and there's there's some folks in
[1:16:45] I took the church years and years ago
[1:16:47] and they come and they sat there for a
[1:16:49] while but I was way too Pentecostal for
[1:16:51] him and too fiery and this and that and
[1:16:53] the other so a couple of them come to me
[1:16:54] and say brother Donnie we love you and
[1:16:56] you're really anointed and we I I knew
[1:16:59] exactly I always wait for that one word
[1:17:02] But but so they lay all the butter on
[1:17:05] then they drag out the butcher knife you
[1:17:07] know and well you're this and you're
[1:17:09] that but you know but brother Donnie you
[1:17:12] know you're you're young and and we like
[1:17:14] a man with a with gray in his hair oh if
[1:17:17] they' waited around a little while that
[1:17:18] would have showed up too oh but you know
[1:17:21] we want this and man with wisdom and
[1:17:24] people think because somebody's old that
[1:17:26] they got wisdom some of the dumbest
[1:17:28] people I ever dealt with in my life is
[1:17:30] old people well Hallelujah you you young
[1:17:34] people can say amen for a few years
[1:17:35] can't you come on brother Malachi say
[1:17:37] amen for me buddy you know a lot of time
[1:17:39] people think glory to God I tell one
[1:17:41] thing I've been around forever in a day
[1:17:43] we can tell it too don't mean they got a
[1:17:45] lick of wisdom this wisdom is not
[1:17:48] brought on by age God gives this in his
[1:17:52] body I think we need more more men of
[1:17:55] God to seek God for this gift right here
[1:17:58] our churches would be run different some
[1:18:00] of our meetings would be run different
[1:18:03] oh come on I feel like having church
[1:18:05] tonight preachers need wisdom pastors
[1:18:08] need wisdom evangelists need wisdom the
[1:18:11] ministry needs wisdom to know how to run
[1:18:14] special meetings to know how to run
[1:18:16] youth camps to know how to counsel
[1:18:18] people to know how to lead the people of
[1:18:21] God oh you don't know how much I pray
[1:18:24] for it
[1:18:25] constantly because sometimes I get hit
[1:18:28] with situations and I get caught right
[1:18:30] in the middle of situations and I've
[1:18:31] seen it so many times that de the devil
[1:18:34] loves to slam my back against the wall
[1:18:36] and if I go this way he's caught me if I
[1:18:39] go this way and say well it's this way
[1:18:41] or that way and the devil loves to stand
[1:18:43] right thr he poin his finger at me say
[1:18:44] ahuh I've got you now you know I always
[1:18:47] tell him uhuh devil I'd like to remind
[1:18:50] you of this situation and that situation
[1:18:53] and that situation and you know what he
[1:18:55] has to do stick his tail between his
[1:18:57] legs and go back down to Hell like a
[1:18:59] little beat down pup why because wisdom
[1:19:02] is here among us if we will only ask
[1:19:05] almighty God for it I don't need just
[1:19:08] knowledge knowledge I thank God for
[1:19:10] knowledge and I still got a pretty good
[1:19:11] memory I thank God for the ability to
[1:19:14] study but I do not just need knowledge I
[1:19:17] need Divine wisdom I need the wisdom of
[1:19:20] God to know how to run this church I've
[1:19:23] been pastoring for decades but my
[1:19:25] experience alone will not get us out of
[1:19:28] here I need the wisdom of God to know
[1:19:30] what to preach how intensely to say it
[1:19:33] when to preach this and when to preach
[1:19:35] that I need the wisdom of God every day
[1:19:39] of my life to be able to live a life
[1:19:42] that is pleasing to the
[1:19:47] Lord I know you pray for me for strength
[1:19:50] and I appreciate it but add one more
[1:19:53] thing if you don't mind to that
[1:19:55] request
[1:19:58] wisdom
[1:20:01] wisdom oh
[1:20:03] my Lord Jesus can you
[1:20:06] imagine what God would be able to do
[1:20:10] among us if we would get in the divine
[1:20:14] order of what he really wants us to
[1:20:18] have wisdom again let's look at it
[1:20:20] Supreme
[1:20:21] intelligence such as belongs to God this
[1:20:24] B passes our flesh this bypasses Satan
[1:20:27] can you imagine a Son of God filled with
[1:20:30] the Holy Ghost has the ability to
[1:20:32] receive a thought from God a rainbow
[1:20:35] word from God bypasses his flesh
[1:20:38] bypasses his Spirit bypasses demons a
[1:20:42] direct thought from the mind of God on
[1:20:44] how to do this and how to do that I've
[1:20:46] seen him do it so many times I always
[1:20:49] Marvel at it sir oh what a blessed thing
[1:20:52] it is do we need it friends
[1:20:56] am notice so the first one
[1:21:00] wisdom the
[1:21:03] second notice how it's given for to one
[1:21:06] by the spirit the word of wisdom to
[1:21:09] another the word of knowledge look at
[1:21:13] knowledge now we use this a lot because
[1:21:15] it's a word that's used a whole lot in
[1:21:16] the New Testament Noti this the general
[1:21:18] knowledge of Christian religion the
[1:21:21] deeper more perfect and enlarged
[1:21:25] knowledge of this religion but remember
[1:21:27] this is not by
[1:21:30] studying it's not by studying this is a
[1:21:33] gift of the
[1:21:38] spirit watch this I found this amazing
[1:21:41] and how the prophet tapped into this
[1:21:44] about a word of knowledge or I think
[1:21:48] Pentecost
[1:21:51] failed well if Pentecost failed how do
[1:21:54] we figure we're going to better it if we
[1:21:56] go the same way they
[1:21:57] did you know what if if we're not
[1:22:00] careful in 10 or 15 years we're going to
[1:22:01] say where I think message people
[1:22:04] failed I don't want them saying that
[1:22:06] about us friends I don't want them
[1:22:08] saying that about our church I don't
[1:22:10] want them saying about that about me
[1:22:11] brother Dave as a minister as a pastor
[1:22:13] the of the word of God do you want that
[1:22:15] said about you I
[1:22:17] don't he could take the
[1:22:20] prophets with the gift of
[1:22:22] knowledge and for show them what was
[1:22:26] going to be and they can speak it
[1:22:30] because it's a word of
[1:22:34] knowledge that God gives to his
[1:22:37] prophet and he foretells it before it
[1:22:40] comes to pass because God knows all
[1:22:44] things I want you to notice how he
[1:22:46] catches this then that God would bring
[1:22:50] this gift into the prophets of the Old
[1:22:52] Testament of course and they were able
[1:22:54] to
[1:22:56] foree or for
[1:22:59] know events that was going to happen
[1:23:01] thousands of years down the road what
[1:23:04] was it a word of knowledge now that
[1:23:08] would have been limited only to the
[1:23:10] prophets who were so designed that their
[1:23:13] first conscience and their subconscious
[1:23:16] was side by
[1:23:17] side so they could have a dream as we
[1:23:20] would say with their eyes wide open so
[1:23:22] they could stand right there and travel
[1:23:26] dimensionally just like the prophet I
[1:23:28] see you I see you coming home from
[1:23:31] school you got on a yellow chicken dress
[1:23:34] there's a dog at you I see you come up
[1:23:36] on the porch you fill through the
[1:23:39] door he could go from where they were
[1:23:42] backwards he could come to present time
[1:23:45] and go to the Future and cover a span of
[1:23:48] 60 70 80 90 years just like that and it
[1:23:53] was a word of nosis a word of
[1:23:57] knowledge you see what was it that Peter
[1:24:01] manifested that day the spirit of God
[1:24:04] when ananas and Safara had
[1:24:06] lied and Peter when they come up and
[1:24:10] Peter said why is Satan putting your
[1:24:11] heart to lie to the Holy
[1:24:14] Ghost God dropped that word down inside
[1:24:17] of Peter now Peter wasn't even a prophet
[1:24:19] right but he had the Holy Ghost now
[1:24:22] watch the prophet goes on to say here in
[1:24:24] person nature of Christianity so God had
[1:24:26] took Ezekiel high and far up to see
[1:24:28] round about
[1:24:30] 2600 years remember Ezekiel Saw the
[1:24:34] Millennium things that he saw still has
[1:24:37] not yet happened think of it a prophet
[1:24:42] is also a gift of
[1:24:45] knowledge a knowledge like an attorney
[1:24:50] who
[1:24:50] studies the books and when you go to
[1:24:54] hire an attorney to plead your case he's
[1:24:56] only taking what he knows and you're
[1:24:58] playing paying for what he knows to
[1:25:00] present your case before the
[1:25:03] judge wow what a way to explain it a
[1:25:06] gift of knowledge in the Bible is
[1:25:08] prophecy which goes up and find out
[1:25:11] these things that are to come and brings
[1:25:14] them back down but they must compare
[1:25:17] with the Bible That's What We believe
[1:25:20] a't it notice jump on down there a bit
[1:25:22] and the prophet goes up and sees sees
[1:25:24] the time coming see it's only a gift of
[1:25:28] knowledge that he brings down and puts
[1:25:31] it on
[1:25:33] paper so God can allow in the
[1:25:38] body now remember there's only one for
[1:25:41] an
[1:25:42] age a prophet with the
[1:25:45] sign praise the
[1:25:47] Lord can God allow people in his body
[1:25:52] remember this is not just now to to the
[1:25:54] office Ministry but this is to the body
[1:25:57] as well my Ministry to lay hands on the
[1:26:00] sick it's been by Divine gift to bring
[1:26:02] the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:26:05] Presence by discernment of spirit which
[1:26:07] is called in the Bible a gift of
[1:26:10] knowledge in doing so makes him
[1:26:13] manifested before the people then they
[1:26:16] receive him as their healer and that
[1:26:19] settles
[1:26:21] it I've seen Lots called discernment I
[1:26:24] do not believe in but I know there's
[1:26:27] truly a Discerning spirit of God the
[1:26:31] gift of knowledge that calls and
[1:26:35] speaks and it's
[1:26:41] perfect five out of
[1:26:44] five five out of 10
[1:26:47] NOP it's perfect every time if it's a
[1:26:51] gift from
[1:26:52] God so wisdom is first knowledge is
[1:26:58] second notice the third to
[1:27:02] another pistus
[1:27:05] Faith a conviction or belief respecting
[1:27:10] man's relationship to God and divine
[1:27:13] things generally with the included idea
[1:27:16] of trust and holy
[1:27:20] fervor the conviction that God exists
[1:27:22] and is the Creator and ruler of of all
[1:27:24] things the provider and bestower of
[1:27:27] Eternal salvation through
[1:27:30] Christ now God gives to every man that
[1:27:33] believes a Measure of Faith but some
[1:27:37] have this gift of
[1:27:39] faith which is above the average
[1:27:42] believer's Measure of Faith to believe
[1:27:45] that there is a God and that God can
[1:27:47] heal and God can save and there's a
[1:27:49] heaven and there's a hell to every
[1:27:51] believer is given this Measure of Faith
[1:27:52] to be able to believe God for certain
[1:27:55] things but to some is given the gift of
[1:27:59] faith and they by that gift can pray and
[1:28:03] they can bring the presence of God right
[1:28:06] down around people other preachers other
[1:28:08] people may be standing around and
[1:28:10] praying too but if they don't have that
[1:28:13] gift that one individual that's got that
[1:28:15] gift with that fervor and that something
[1:28:17] and then what does that do it creates
[1:28:20] more faith because people know God God
[1:28:23] God mov moves for that man God moves for
[1:28:26] that man we've all seen it have we
[1:28:28] not so faith of course this is substance
[1:28:32] of things hope for the evidence of
[1:28:33] Things Not Seen but here is a special
[1:28:36] endowment which is what the gifts are a
[1:28:40] special endowment which is separate from
[1:28:43] your salvation separate from your new
[1:28:45] births it is an endowment given by the
[1:28:49] spirit of God the Charisma given for
[1:28:51] what purpose to profit the body now
[1:28:55] where do these gifts belong they don't
[1:28:57] belong in the White House White House
[1:28:59] don't want this they don't belong in in
[1:29:01] the Senate house down in in Nashville
[1:29:03] where do they belong in the church but
[1:29:06] let me tell you something we cannot
[1:29:08] produce these gifts on our own it takes
[1:29:10] the Holy Ghost to produce them and I
[1:29:12] want every one of these gifts in our
[1:29:14] church but we're not going to get them
[1:29:16] because we are desire spiritual gifts
[1:29:19] we're going to get them whenever we say
[1:29:21] God pour out your presence Among Us let
[1:29:23] it be real Let It Be genuine Lord we
[1:29:26] don't want no fake we don't want this
[1:29:27] and that and the other we want the real
[1:29:29] thing I don't know about you I would
[1:29:30] like to see all nine manifested in a
[1:29:33] true right way before God before I leave
[1:29:36] this
[1:29:38] world praise the Lord is that asking too
[1:29:41] much I don't think so this is a portion
[1:29:43] of the word like Malachi 4 other portion
[1:29:45] of the word of God to another by The
[1:29:48] Same Spirit to face to another by The
[1:29:51] Same Spirit then the gifts of of healing
[1:29:55] now we know that God loves humanity and
[1:29:57] he wants people to be healed so much
[1:29:59] that the prophet said that God heals by
[1:30:01] love God heals by music God heals by
[1:30:05] medicine God heals by surgery this is
[1:30:08] why the prophet prayed for doctors every
[1:30:10] day that they would find a cure for
[1:30:13] cancer well praise the Lord if he did
[1:30:15] that as message followers shouldn't we
[1:30:16] be doing the same he prayed constantly
[1:30:20] that God would help him he did not
[1:30:22] reprimand and rebuke on a Sal for coming
[1:30:25] up with the polio vaccine he was
[1:30:28] grateful to God that he let that come
[1:30:31] upon the Earth is that right but yet
[1:30:33] here we're talking about an endowment
[1:30:36] and any of you that's ever been to a
[1:30:38] doctor or you've ever had a stay in a
[1:30:40] hospital you know that there are some
[1:30:42] nurses no doubt that are called to be
[1:30:45] nurses and they come in and they've just
[1:30:47] got something about them and they don't
[1:30:50] just push that needle in your arm they
[1:30:52] push it in your arm in a different way
[1:30:54] you know what I'm saying they're just
[1:30:56] something about it and it's the same
[1:30:58] about doctors you know as soon as you go
[1:31:00] in and sit down and you talk to some
[1:31:02] doctors you know why they are there it's
[1:31:04] because they've got that big house in
[1:31:06] the ridges and they know they've got a
[1:31:08] Porsche car and that their child's got a
[1:31:10] BMW and they've got this big bank
[1:31:12] account they've also got a vacation home
[1:31:14] on Blowing Rock and they've got another
[1:31:16] vacation home down in Tampa and that's
[1:31:18] the reason they're a doctor to make all
[1:31:20] that money and you can tell by their
[1:31:22] attitude so you're number three 85 get
[1:31:25] in sit down shut up next one 386 387 the
[1:31:29] more they get the more payment I get but
[1:31:31] then you've got others and they are so
[1:31:34] concerned about you and they're asking
[1:31:37] how are you and you tell me which is
[1:31:39] very rare doctors is like preachers they
[1:31:41] don't want you to tell them nothing but
[1:31:43] they ask well you tell me how are you
[1:31:45] doing both carolly and I went to a
[1:31:47] Cardiologist yesterday well how are you
[1:31:49] all doing what's going on with y'all how
[1:31:51] are you been well you tell me if you got
[1:31:53] any problem s anything going on no no
[1:31:55] we're doing good we're doing well that's
[1:31:57] awesome to Carol said you don't even
[1:31:59] need a cardiologist you don't even need
[1:32:00] to be here but he was a man that was
[1:32:03] very caring and you see what that is a
[1:32:05] person that's called to do it they do
[1:32:08] some of the same stuff got access to the
[1:32:10] same scripts and they can write the
[1:32:12] language you know and all that but
[1:32:14] there's an attitude that comes with it
[1:32:16] that you cannot learn at ETSU you've
[1:32:19] seen nurses and they didn't care a bit
[1:32:20] more about you they've shown more
[1:32:22] affection toward a donke than they would
[1:32:24] a human being and budy they go to
[1:32:26] drawing blood out of you and it's like
[1:32:28] they're drawing out of a turnip cuz they
[1:32:30] slam your arm down there dear God help
[1:32:33] and that they don't care a bit for you
[1:32:35] because it's become so common and so
[1:32:37] cold there're so Pat on you now calm
[1:32:40] down honey you okay how in the world can
[1:32:42] they tell we're nervous just because
[1:32:44] we've got the beads of sweat that big
[1:32:46] coming out all over our face how do they
[1:32:48] have that discernment but there is a
[1:32:50] call it's the same way when it comes to
[1:32:53] the spirit of God and the way he gives
[1:32:56] out these gifts so God is looking for
[1:32:58] people that he can give special
[1:33:01] endowment to that he knows are not going
[1:33:04] to take it and lift themsel higher above
[1:33:07] their Brethren because it's not to
[1:33:09] profit you it's not to profit me it's
[1:33:13] not to profit the individual that's got
[1:33:15] it it's to profit the Church of the
[1:33:17] Living
[1:33:19] God God give us people that he can be
[1:33:22] able to give such things and it'll not
[1:33:24] go to their
[1:33:29] head
[1:33:31] Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to
[1:33:36] another
[1:33:37] working of Miracles Bo I tell you one
[1:33:41] thing there's something about the gifts
[1:33:42] of healing and the work of Miracles now
[1:33:44] let's just be honest in face facts some
[1:33:46] of these things are going to be more
[1:33:49] Visual and they will be more talked
[1:33:51] about and they will be more
[1:33:54] desired than the greatest
[1:33:58] ones which are wisdom and
[1:34:01] knowledge but yet whenever you look at
[1:34:04] it if we don't tap into that Avenue
[1:34:06] first from the top and work our way from
[1:34:09] the top down to what God wants us to
[1:34:11] have it's no wonder that we have the
[1:34:14] stuff that we
[1:34:16] have working of
[1:34:18] Miracles to
[1:34:20] another prophecy
[1:34:25] prophecy which means
[1:34:28] what repeating
[1:34:32] scripture yeah the Lord say I'm here
[1:34:36] yeah the Lord say I'm going to bless
[1:34:39] you so what if Moses in Deuteronomy
[1:34:43] 18:15 would have
[1:34:45] said yeah the Lord say I'm going to
[1:34:48] bless
[1:34:51] y'all I'm so glad Moses didn't believe
[1:34:53] the Pentecostal version and some of the
[1:34:55] message version of Prophecy right that's
[1:34:58] why Moses said behold the Lord your God
[1:35:00] shall raise up a prophet liken unto me
[1:35:02] from among your brethren and he goes on
[1:35:04] to Define and Define that's
[1:35:09] prophecy Oh Glory to God y'all get
[1:35:12] nervous tonight don't be nervous it's
[1:35:14] good it's
[1:35:15] good till another Discerning of
[1:35:21] spirits Discerning of SP
[1:35:24] Spirits
[1:35:28] deis
[1:35:30] discern
[1:35:32] distinguishing
[1:35:34] judging I want you to notice what this
[1:35:40] precedes notice what this proceedes
[1:35:44] Discerning of
[1:35:47] spirits then
[1:35:49] tongues interpretation and prophecy oh
[1:35:53] my
[1:35:54] so that's why we need Discerning of
[1:35:56] spirits is
[1:35:58] it okay all right now watch the prophet
[1:36:01] of God is he takes this and he said now
[1:36:05] question answer say for instance I'm
[1:36:07] going to say we spoke in tongue somebody
[1:36:09] that is a gifted bunch of men Leo raised
[1:36:11] up spoken tongues and a brother here
[1:36:13] brother Willard give the interpretation
[1:36:15] all right now I want to say brother
[1:36:17] Neville and brother juny and brother
[1:36:19] Willard Collins was the discerners
[1:36:25] the
[1:36:27] discerners so does that mean then that
[1:36:29] brother juny Junior
[1:36:32] Jackson brother Willard
[1:36:36] Collins and brother Neville are standing
[1:36:39] in the church Discerning
[1:36:45] people you see friend this just
[1:36:47] absolutely blows me
[1:36:48] away that we have got message preachers
[1:36:50] that are putting their own
[1:36:51] interpretation
[1:36:54] on this
[1:36:56] word and will take their own opinion
[1:36:59] above a Vindicated
[1:37:01] prophet and if you think brother Bram
[1:37:04] taught this on in his church I say shame
[1:37:06] on
[1:37:07] you for not taking time to sit down and
[1:37:10] get your computer in your lab and typing
[1:37:13] it in and find out that he preached It
[1:37:14] All Over
[1:37:16] America cuz he was sent to correct the
[1:37:19] Pentecostals and they refused Elijah's
[1:37:22] meal offering and now some of the
[1:37:24] message preachers are refusing Elijah's
[1:37:26] meal offering
[1:37:28] too but I want Elijah's meal offering
[1:37:31] myself cuz God knows I mixed up enough
[1:37:34] poisonous porridge in my life anybody
[1:37:38] else say Amen to that I've got enough
[1:37:40] wild Gorge brother Steve and mixed in a
[1:37:42] little bit of this and a little bit of
[1:37:43] that I'm just going to be frank and
[1:37:45] honest with you tonight I'll be
[1:37:46] something a lot of preachers won't be
[1:37:47] I'll be honest I mixed up a lot of
[1:37:50] pottage and I pulled a lot of gourds and
[1:37:52] mix this that and the other but thank
[1:37:54] God for a prophet with enough meal to
[1:37:56] pour down inside my understanding of
[1:37:59] predestination and my inside of
[1:38:01] predestination got healed praise God my
[1:38:05] insight on women preachers brother Larry
[1:38:08] got healed yeah cuz I used to preach for
[1:38:10] women preachers when I was back there in
[1:38:12] Pentecost I preached eternal hell back
[1:38:14] there in Pentecost I preached tongues as
[1:38:17] the evidence back in Pentecost I preach
[1:38:19] a lot of them things and I did have a
[1:38:21] little bit of Truth not very much it's
[1:38:23] very little but once I found Elijah's
[1:38:26] meal stored up in the last day and begin
[1:38:28] to pour that on my election it brought
[1:38:31] my election to a Divine Healing it
[1:38:33] brought my predestination it brought my
[1:38:36] my ideology of the godhead oh I tell you
[1:38:38] friends if you haven't tried it you
[1:38:40] ought to try it you ought to tried every
[1:38:42] aspect of your life it'll heal your
[1:38:44] resentment attitude it'll heal your
[1:38:46] inability to forgive and love and just
[1:38:49] have joy in your life every day some of
[1:38:52] you let the devil Rob you your joy of
[1:38:54] per of serving God you need to take some
[1:38:56] of Elijah's meal and pour it in that Joy
[1:39:00] praise God get up in the morning with a
[1:39:02] smile on your face with a song in your
[1:39:05] heart saying out of my way devil I'm
[1:39:07] serving God today I don't care what's in
[1:39:10] my path greater is he that is in me than
[1:39:13] he that is in the
[1:39:16] world Glory
[1:39:24] so brother Neville brother juny and
[1:39:26] brother Willard Collins are the
[1:39:28] discerners so what and who are they
[1:39:33] Discerning they are Discerning the
[1:39:35] tongues and the interpretation which
[1:39:37] came
[1:39:38] forth so someone spoke in tongues
[1:39:41] someone
[1:39:42] interpreted so you've got discerner
[1:39:44] setting there two or three and they are
[1:39:48] Discerning that
[1:39:51] Spirit yes
[1:39:54] amen then if they agree and said that
[1:39:56] was the Lord that was the Lord that was
[1:39:58] the
[1:40:01] Lord now of course this would make it
[1:40:03] quite
[1:40:04] sticky yeah because a prophet would have
[1:40:07] them to write down this
[1:40:09] prophecy and bring it to the pull pit
[1:40:11] and he would read
[1:40:13] it and then brother Neville's name would
[1:40:16] be on
[1:40:18] it brother Collin's name would be
[1:40:20] honored and whoever someone spoke thus
[1:40:22] sayith the Lord the tongues
[1:40:24] interpretation and the discerners all
[1:40:26] three said it was thus sayith the
[1:40:29] Lord then of course if it didn't
[1:40:33] happen public
[1:40:38] embarrassment a now we want to claim
[1:40:40] sovereignty don't
[1:40:43] we our church is above this
[1:40:47] really so I wonder where what else
[1:40:50] you'll start being above you see all it
[1:40:52] takes for a preacher on one little bitty
[1:40:55] tiny thing to start saying well we don't
[1:40:57] want that in our church that's not the
[1:40:59] way we're going to do it you just opened
[1:41:01] up the floodgates of
[1:41:04] hell cuz you'll start with one little
[1:41:07] thing that you think is insignificant
[1:41:09] then another then another then another
[1:41:12] and three years from now five years from
[1:41:14] now what where you going to be at then
[1:41:16] friends it is so
[1:41:18] dangerous amen amen oh my right God help
[1:41:22] us amen now watch the example that a
[1:41:27] prophet gave describing
[1:41:34] prophecy Leo spoke and Willard gave the
[1:41:36] interpretation here and said thus sayeth
[1:41:38] the
[1:41:39] Lord Wednesday
[1:41:42] night there's coming a woman in here
[1:41:45] she's going to be violent tell brother
[1:41:48] brandham not to rebuke her because she's
[1:41:52] insane but but tell him to take her over
[1:41:55] to the
[1:41:56] corner because it was in a corner where
[1:41:59] she did a wicked thing on one time and a
[1:42:01] certain thing taking place now that
[1:42:03] sounds very good doesn't it now but the
[1:42:06] first thing you know in the old
[1:42:07] scripture no matter what the prophet
[1:42:08] said or what anybody else said it was
[1:42:10] tested by the urum Thum first you see
[1:42:14] where brother random is going with this
[1:42:16] straight back to the
[1:42:20] Scriptures it went to the word and if
[1:42:22] them Li didn't flash then let it alone
[1:42:25] first thing you know now watch let's
[1:42:27] take it back to the word this man spoke
[1:42:29] in tongues sound it all right this one
[1:42:31] interpret it sounded all right but the
[1:42:34] word said let it be judged by two or
[1:42:37] three judges
[1:42:40] First Take It to the urum Thum now the
[1:42:43] first thing Willard colins says it was
[1:42:45] of the Lord juny says it was of the Lord
[1:42:49] two out of three all right it's put on a
[1:42:52] piece of paper spoke right out here in
[1:42:54] the church then when the people who sees
[1:42:56] it read it notice before it ever
[1:43:01] happens and then see it happen and they
[1:43:03] say
[1:43:05] brother that's
[1:43:11] God that's what I want in our
[1:43:17] church yes sir so the spirit of God
[1:43:21] could speak and say Sunday morning
[1:43:24] there'll be a man come in dressed like
[1:43:27] so and so and so and so tell brother
[1:43:29] Donnie to pray for him he'll have this
[1:43:31] certain thing his name will be so and
[1:43:34] so oh you can see why people don't want
[1:43:36] to do
[1:43:38] that cuz if they're wrong everybody's
[1:43:42] going to know they're wrong so what are
[1:43:43] a lot of our prophecies and our
[1:43:45] discernments they're so
[1:43:47] generic that's right even if you miss it
[1:43:50] you can't prove it wrong cuz I wouldn't
[1:43:52] want I said no I didn't say it that way
[1:43:54] no you misunderstood what I
[1:43:58] said well glory
[1:44:01] amen hallelujah somebody dial 911 get
[1:44:05] the ambulances lined up for after
[1:44:08] church now listen this is the way the
[1:44:10] prophet the same Prophet that we want to
[1:44:13] study his quotes and prove without a
[1:44:17] shadow of doubt that the gifts are
[1:44:19] supposed to be restored in the last days
[1:44:24] and yet we won't take his same message
[1:44:26] and prove how they ought to be restored
[1:44:27] and how what they ought to be restored
[1:44:34] to well thank you
[1:44:36] Jesus but what if it don't happen yes
[1:44:41] now we're going to get to another thing
[1:44:43] I could hit right here is all prophecy
[1:44:45] and interpretations and message prophecy
[1:44:47] now just a minute now what if it don't
[1:44:50] happen then Leo has spoken a false
[1:44:52] spirit
[1:44:54] Spirit he gave a false
[1:44:57] interpretation and you gave a false
[1:45:00] judgment then get that thing out of you
[1:45:03] that's wrong leave it alone
[1:45:08] that's it's not just a
[1:45:14] mistake
[1:45:17] sir I said it's not just a mistake
[1:45:23] amen the one who's the author of so many
[1:45:25] of these hit and misses around our
[1:45:27] message ranks it's not just
[1:45:30] mistakes it's
[1:45:33] demons amen yes sir praise the Lord
[1:45:37] thank you
[1:45:38] Lord everybody that gets mad at me now
[1:45:41] you can line up in line to buy me and
[1:45:43] Carol steak
[1:45:45] supper we'll take your name and address
[1:45:48] after church
[1:45:49] okay even you online too i' be getting a
[1:45:52] bunch of gift cards after that woo
[1:45:54] praise the Lord now watch see that's a
[1:45:58] regular Saints
[1:46:00] meeting I think that's what's in the
[1:46:03] Bible because Paul said if one
[1:46:06] prophesies and something someone bring
[1:46:08] prophesied something be revealed to one
[1:46:11] that's sitting there let him first hold
[1:46:12] his peace until this one speaks first
[1:46:15] you may all prophesy one by one that
[1:46:18] couldn't
[1:46:20] be in a regular meeting
[1:46:26] now I find it amazing that preachers
[1:46:28] will stand up and defy the prophet of
[1:46:31] God on this
[1:46:36] teaching I don't care how long you've
[1:46:38] been
[1:46:39] preaching what are you want a ribbon a
[1:46:41] star a
[1:46:44] button the spirit of Christ is subject
[1:46:49] to Christ teaching
[1:46:52] amen
[1:47:00] am don't smell that is it just me I me I
[1:47:04] took a shower before I come to
[1:47:08] church friends let me just tell you as
[1:47:12] we go on in time we are going to be
[1:47:18] shocked at people that will turn from
[1:47:21] this word
[1:47:23] but don't believe it'll be a total
[1:47:26] repudiation it will not be a total
[1:47:29] denial it will be a
[1:47:32] dissecting that's right come on I want I
[1:47:35] don't want I want I don't want I want I
[1:47:39] don't
[1:47:44] want may God help
[1:47:47] us amen do you realize when reding in
[1:47:50] the realm of spiritual gifts the realm
[1:47:52] realm of demonology lays right
[1:47:56] there listen to it Harvest
[1:47:59] Time December
[1:48:02] 1964 Satan can hand out those
[1:48:05] Supernatural
[1:48:06] gifts by the
[1:48:10] handfuls why because the realm of gifts
[1:48:13] lays so close to the realm of
[1:48:19] demonology this is why we needed this
[1:48:22] kind of te teaching that's right people
[1:48:24] think brother R was trying to take our
[1:48:26] Liberty are you kidding me he was sent
[1:48:29] by God to break them denominational
[1:48:31] bounds and then he would lead us back
[1:48:32] into another bondage he's not trying to
[1:48:35] take our freedom he's trying to keep us
[1:48:38] from evil
[1:48:42] spirits now I ask
[1:48:44] you what was on the preacher that told
[1:48:47] Carol she was called to
[1:48:50] preach yes sir what the Holy Ghost
[1:48:54] what was on the other preacher that told
[1:48:56] her she had
[1:48:57] cancer God Don't
[1:49:03] Lie oh
[1:49:04] my argue do whatever you want to do but
[1:49:07] listen Brothers those of you that
[1:49:09] disagree with me let me just let you
[1:49:11] know tonight you are not disagreeing
[1:49:13] with
[1:49:14] me you are disagreeing with God's
[1:49:18] Prophet any you in our church that
[1:49:21] disagree you're not disagreeing with
[1:49:22] your your pastor you're disagreeing with
[1:49:25] your Prophet
[1:49:26] messenger but this is the issue God
[1:49:29] being misunderstood brother REM says if
[1:49:31] you Brothers will trust my understanding
[1:49:35] of the
[1:49:37] scriptures I'd like to come down and
[1:49:39] meet with you and we could set these
[1:49:41] things in
[1:49:42] order that's the sad part brother
[1:49:45] Smith some of the preachers in this
[1:49:47] message have been preaching so long now
[1:49:51] and they've got so much you know know
[1:49:53] years behind
[1:49:55] them that they can question brother
[1:49:57] brenham's understanding of the
[1:50:04] scriptures well I hope I don't never
[1:50:06] live that
[1:50:08] long I hope if I you know it's
[1:50:13] amazing a lot of preachers don't mess up
[1:50:15] in their 30s brother Ron spencon I was
[1:50:17] telling about it last week lot of
[1:50:19] preachers don't mess up in their 40s and
[1:50:20] 50s some do but it's amazing how many
[1:50:24] preachers it's when they get up in their
[1:50:26] 60s and
[1:50:29] 70s when they get their Kingdom secure
[1:50:31] and they become you know where they can
[1:50:34] handle the word and they can Venture
[1:50:36] without Authority and
[1:50:39] purum I hope and pray to God that if God
[1:50:43] ever sees I would do such a thing he
[1:50:46] would take my life
[1:50:50] amen yes sir and put me in a free mature
[1:50:56] grave before I would bring reproach on
[1:50:59] the Lord Jesus amen and his word am and
[1:51:04] this
[1:51:05] message and you amen yes
[1:51:12] people let's stand
[1:51:16] together now that couldn't be in a
[1:51:18] regular meeting you know that the gifts
[1:51:21] now to be sure that it's of God CU if
[1:51:24] it's just
[1:51:27] foolishness it ain't of God you mean to
[1:51:30] tell me there could be tongues and
[1:51:32] interpretation and even so-called
[1:51:35] Discerning of spirits that would be
[1:51:37] nothing but
[1:51:41] foolishness poor brother Donnie that's
[1:51:43] scary stuff I know it's scary it's scary
[1:51:46] both
[1:51:47] ways it's scary to call something
[1:51:50] foolish that's God
[1:51:53] it's just as scary to call something God
[1:51:56] that's
[1:52:00] foolishness right brother
[1:52:03] Rob oh my
[1:52:06] goodness if it doesn't come to
[1:52:09] pass it's not of
[1:52:11] God it's got to come to pass and
[1:52:14] therefore in our
[1:52:16] churches oh
[1:52:18] no oh no
[1:52:22] oh
[1:52:24] no not just in my church but in our
[1:52:31] churches who's
[1:52:33] here question answer
[1:52:36] 61 message
[1:52:39] preachers message
[1:52:44] churches oh my goodness so brother
[1:52:46] brandom intended for this to be more
[1:52:49] than eth in pen Street oh no how
[1:52:51] terrible how traumatic it that's not the
[1:52:53] way I look at it I look at it as keeping
[1:52:56] demons out of our
[1:52:59] ranks brother Donnie what if it don't
[1:53:01] happen but four or five times a year by
[1:53:03] putting them back there I'd rather for
[1:53:05] it to be real and be four or five times
[1:53:07] a year than every time we come to church
[1:53:10] and'll be nothing but
[1:53:13] flesh yes sir cuz it's only a matter of
[1:53:17] time that an evil spirit will start
[1:53:20] saying things
[1:53:23] initially it'll start out you can't
[1:53:25] really pinpoint it initially nothing
[1:53:28] that you can really say is really
[1:53:30] missing it so generic demons know how to
[1:53:33] be generic remember each demon has its
[1:53:35] own personality all of them have it
[1:53:38] Blended in that personality an element
[1:53:41] of genericism where they can remain very
[1:53:43] neutral remember they're the kings of
[1:53:46] deceivers they know better than to give
[1:53:48] the very first one to be so far out and
[1:53:50] so false nobody else that even want to
[1:53:52] hear it anymore so what do they do it
[1:53:55] very generic and remember you are
[1:53:57] dealing with beings that know how to say
[1:53:59] things in such a way that you can't say
[1:54:02] it's right or you can't say it's wrong
[1:54:05] neutral just all
[1:54:07] neutral and then when he gets the people
[1:54:10] caught up in it then this will be wrong
[1:54:13] that'll be wrong oh my goodness friends
[1:54:15] there's people in our church that have
[1:54:17] come from churches and told me just a
[1:54:19] few years ago and people man man that
[1:54:22] even said under brother brandham himself
[1:54:24] and yet people getting up and speaking
[1:54:26] in tongues and prophesying and telling
[1:54:28] them you've got married the wrong person
[1:54:29] you need to leave your husband you need
[1:54:31] to leave your wife telling people to cut
[1:54:33] their hair you cannot believe all the
[1:54:35] nonsense and the
[1:54:37] trash a so-called Message Church of a
[1:54:41] preacher that brother brandham calls his
[1:54:43] name on
[1:54:44] tape that don't mean
[1:54:47] nothing come
[1:54:49] on but it starts out oh yes generic
[1:54:55] generic may God help
[1:54:58] us as I said I'd rather have it five
[1:55:02] times a year and it be right than every
[1:55:05] service hit Miss hit miss a lot of name
[1:55:08] Prophecy in the first place brother
[1:55:10] Donnie how can you say that I judge it
[1:55:11] by the
[1:55:13] word if it don't tell you what you
[1:55:15] prayed if it don't tell you what you was
[1:55:17] thinking about if it don't tell you
[1:55:19] things that's going to be forget it
[1:55:22] that's right I said forget
[1:55:26] it her and I knew a woman Carol knew her
[1:55:29] well as well an angel of
[1:55:33] God walked into her room one night
[1:55:36] handed her a
[1:55:38] Bible and told her she was called to
[1:55:41] preach she didn't even know where the
[1:55:43] Bible come from it was not her Bible it
[1:55:46] was not her husband's Bible they'd never
[1:55:48] even seen the Bible
[1:55:55] and I say angel of God in the sense that
[1:55:58] it was a created angel of God in the
[1:56:01] beginning which sold his Birthright and
[1:56:03] become a
[1:56:04] demon and this woman started preaching
[1:56:08] because an
[1:56:09] angel appeared into her room and called
[1:56:13] her to
[1:56:17] preach woo thank God for mercy
[1:56:22] don't you love him with all your
[1:56:24] heart how many wants the
[1:56:28] real me too
[1:56:30] Church well he said Brother D you think
[1:56:33] that's going to encourage us to seek
[1:56:34] after the real if it'll encourage you to
[1:56:36] seek after anything it'll encourage you
[1:56:38] to seek after the
[1:56:39] real there's too much heaven's just full
[1:56:42] of the real and genuine why do we want
[1:56:44] to
[1:56:45] fake we don't want
[1:56:47] it we want
[1:56:49] real hey and I was talking about it one
[1:56:52] time he said you know brother Donnie
[1:56:53] I've thought about
[1:56:55] it he said what if the gifted people met
[1:56:57] in our church and other message churches
[1:57:00] and that meet Sunday nothing happened
[1:57:03] then meet Wednesday nothing happened
[1:57:04] they meet Sunday nothing happened that
[1:57:06] meet Wednesday nothing happened how many
[1:57:09] of them would be faithful just to keep
[1:57:11] on meeting and waiting and
[1:57:14] praying or whether it say well the Lord
[1:57:16] don't want us to do it so I guess we'll
[1:57:18] just be out there in the church we'll
[1:57:20] just do it this way
[1:57:22] God will try Us by his
[1:57:26] word oh I want to be faithful to it
[1:57:28] don't
[1:57:30] youen let's bow our heads
[1:57:35] together praise the
[1:57:40] Lord oh Lord
[1:57:46] Jesus Lord I remember when my poor heart
[1:57:52] finally saw this message of what it
[1:57:57] was and once I begin to acknowledge and
[1:58:00] accept brother randam as the seventh
[1:58:01] angel and a Vindicated messenger of the
[1:58:05] last
[1:58:06] day and I listen to the anointed ones at
[1:58:09] the end
[1:58:10] time it answered so many questions for
[1:58:16] me I'd seen men and all the things that
[1:58:19] they had done and the way that they had
[1:58:21] lived
[1:58:24] I just could not
[1:58:28] understand and Lord I sought when I left
[1:58:30] Pentecost that I would be free from
[1:58:33] that but as I was communicating with a
[1:58:36] brother today from another
[1:58:40] state and he had a relative in his
[1:58:43] family that was
[1:58:48] dying and he told me today that several
[1:58:51] famous
[1:58:52] message
[1:58:54] preachers told him several things
[1:58:57] concerning this
[1:59:00] relative and every one of them was
[1:59:04] wrong even a member of brother Ram's
[1:59:08] family give him a cloth a
[1:59:13] blanket to take and lay on this
[1:59:16] individual and told him that if he'd lay
[1:59:19] that on him prove for him
[1:59:22] that'd be
[1:59:25] well but they
[1:59:30] died I felt so sorry for the brother and
[1:59:33] I apologized to him in the
[1:59:37] text cuz I could just hear it even
[1:59:40] though it was words I could hear his
[1:59:43] hurt and I could feel his pain because I
[1:59:45] know the disappointment that I
[1:59:48] had and even though we try our best to
[1:59:50] spare message people of the same
[1:59:52] disappointment some of them are going
[1:59:54] headlong right into it and I've done
[1:59:56] seen it some of them are going to be so
[1:59:58] stubborn and so hard-headed
[2:00:01] they will not stop until they make the
[2:00:04] office mess that ever
[2:00:08] was and there have to be public
[2:00:10] acknowledgement there'll have to be
[2:00:11] public shame and
[2:00:14] humiliation and they've been El of
[2:00:16] people that'll be hurt and
[2:00:19] scarred and then the preachers going to
[2:00:21] have to answer for
[2:00:23] all because we step over the
[2:00:25] teaching of this
[2:00:29] word forgive us human beings for our
[2:00:33] hard-headed ways our
[2:00:35] stubbornness forgive us
[2:00:39] Lord sometimes I don't know why you even
[2:00:42] fool with
[2:00:43] us not just when we're Sinners but after
[2:00:47] we become saved and even after we've
[2:00:49] preached for decades and we can get so
[2:00:52] set in our ways and so
[2:00:55] stubborn people would just listen to the
[2:00:58] Harvest Time real well and they'll
[2:01:00] listen to it very carefully how that
[2:01:02] Satan moves in that Realm of the
[2:01:05] supernatural Satan will get a man so
[2:01:08] caught up and people calling for him to
[2:01:10] come here and go there and he won't even
[2:01:13] stop and pray no more they want him so
[2:01:16] much and he's in such
[2:01:20] demand Lord God help help
[2:01:22] me help me
[2:01:25] Jesus help me to stay
[2:01:29] true I pray tonight before my

[2:04:27] afraid I get afraid oh
[2:04:31] God my
[2:04:33] flesh becomes
[2:04:36] weary I need you Lord
[2:04:39] Jesus these are a great people I'm
[2:04:43] referring to
[2:04:45] tonight your
[2:04:47] people help me Lord God
[2:04:52] we worship you tonight
[2:04:54] Jesus we bless your
[2:04:58] name oh
[2:05:00] hallelujah how many of you tonight love
[2:05:02] him with all your heart you want God to
[2:05:05] help
[2:05:06] you maybe some of you feel like you're
[2:05:09] gifted in your life what I'll tell you
[2:05:11] what you want to do is check your motive
[2:05:14] your objective if you'll listen to a
[2:05:17] little simple tape very simple but very
[2:05:20] profound at the same time called
[2:05:23] discernment of spirit in
[2:05:27] 1960 it'll unveil a lot about motive and
[2:05:32] objective and of people that are gifted
[2:05:35] and what you can look for and what you
[2:05:37] can watch about
[2:05:40] people oh I pray that God will let his
[2:05:44] great Supernatural fall Among Us like
[2:05:47] never
[2:05:48] before and if we will pray and be
[2:05:51] sincere
[2:05:52] here what will happen before we leave
[2:05:56] this world remember the prophet told us
[2:05:59] that he believed there would be missing
[2:06:04] limbs that would be
[2:06:06] restored remember I told you that years
[2:06:09] ago when I was a Pentecostal preacher
[2:06:12] that God told me the dead would be
[2:06:16] raised in my
[2:06:19] Ministry I've seen it twice since I've
[2:06:21] been
[2:06:22] here I believe we will see such
[2:06:25] phenomenal
[2:06:27] things if we can just keep our hearts
[2:06:30] our
[2:06:31] attitudes and let's seek the
[2:06:34] gifts in their proper
[2:06:37] order let's start with
[2:06:40] wisdom with knowledge then when we get
[2:06:44] tongues we'll run its manifestation
[2:06:47] Lance through the gift on top wisdom
[2:06:51] which will always put God's word first
[2:06:54] we run interpretation through knowledge
[2:06:57] nosis the proper understanding of the
[2:07:00] word which includes also the word of the
[2:07:03] hour so tongues an interpretation of
[2:07:06] that wisdom it's easy to see why you get
[2:07:08] Bible saying almost anything it don't
[2:07:10] even have to be prophetic and people
[2:07:12] just accept it oh my I seen something
[2:07:15] not not long ago and a preacher had
[2:07:17] preached and my you know the people had
[2:07:19] said amen and Hallelujah and that sort
[2:07:21] of saying while the preacher was
[2:07:22] preaching then somebody got up spok in
[2:07:24] tongues and somebody supposedly
[2:07:26] interpreted people went wild they was
[2:07:30] screaming they was holling they was
[2:07:33] running they nearly knocked the chairs
[2:07:35] over in the
[2:07:37] church and what was said was not even
[2:07:42] prophetic there was nothing said that
[2:07:44] was even prophetic at
[2:07:47] all and yet a preacher had labored and
[2:07:50] labored and labored in the word and they
[2:07:52] sat there and said amen praise the Lord
[2:07:55] you can see the camera on some of them
[2:07:56] you know they're twiddling with their
[2:07:58] thumbs and they're doing this and that
[2:08:00] and as soon as tongues and
[2:08:01] interpretation come they went
[2:08:07] wild and then people wonder why I worry
[2:08:10] about stuff cuz I saw the same thing
[2:08:13] when I was a Pentecostal
[2:08:17] preacher now you show me that where that
[2:08:19] carried on in the Tabernacle and that
[2:08:21] was the brother brandham had the example
[2:08:23] and I'll stand up Sunday morning and
[2:08:26] apologize but until you do I'm going to
[2:08:29] keep on preaching
[2:08:40] it well praise the Lord I got my name
[2:08:43] embraced from some context tonight I
[2:08:44] guess off the phones and I lost some
[2:08:46] friends and buddies and Pals but that's
[2:08:49] all right I'm going to stand for this
[2:08:51] word if I have to stand by myself I
[2:08:55] won't have to because God's got people
[2:08:57] everywhere that believes the message of
[2:08:59] the hour right down to the gifts and
[2:09:01] right down to the election and all the
[2:09:02] rest of it and I'll tell you friends
