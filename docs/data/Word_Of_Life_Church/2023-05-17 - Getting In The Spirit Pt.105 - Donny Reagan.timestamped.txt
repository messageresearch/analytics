[29:41] those tears thing does
[29:45] still see the scars in those hands
[29:54] [Music]
[29:56] just you keep this in mind when hope
[30:03] seems so hard to find but surely
[30:09] that you've not reached the end
[30:17] and when the whole world has led you
[30:22] down
[30:23] [Music]

[31:36] but then
[31:40] you know I know someone
[31:43] and he knows it at all
[31:46] as I see even that little Sparrow fall
[31:52] and he can hold back the Seas with just
[31:57] one hand
[32:00] [Music]
[32:02] and he's so piggy rides all the breeze

[32:40] [Music]
[32:56] [Music]
[33:00] and the night clothes

[33:28] [Applause]
[33:29] [Music]
[33:35] [Music]
[33:48] [Music]
[33:52] so
[33:54] how will it end
[33:58] Look to Him
[34:08] [Applause]
[34:08] [Music]
[34:25] folks are looking in lots of different
[34:27] directions
[34:28] and that they were living in of course
[34:31] it's been man's nature too look in all
[34:33] kinds of directions
[34:35] most generally man always looks in the
[34:37] wrong direction doesn't he
[34:39] most of us should be able to say men to
[34:41] the X that's what we did most of my life
[34:43] before the Lord got a hold of us and the
[34:45] sad part about it is we're still looking
[34:47] wrong direction sometimes after we get
[34:49] saved don't we
[34:51] let's turn tonight if it would the First
[34:53] Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11.
[34:56] we'll go back again tonight and uh
[34:59] consult
[35:02] the master builder
[35:04] on this scripture that we've looked at
[35:06] for a couple of services
[35:08] it's basically dealing with the works of
[35:12] ministers but we don't want to just
[35:14] focus on
[35:15] preachers alone how many believes it
[35:17] works are important for all of us every
[35:19] child of God
[35:22] First Corinthians 3 11 for other
[35:25] Foundation can no man lay then that is
[35:28] laid which is Jesus Christ
[35:31] now if any man build upon this
[35:33] Foundation gold silver precious stones
[35:37] wood hay stubble
[35:39] Every Man's work shall be made manifest
[35:43] for the day shall declare it so that's
[35:46] not just me now or every preacher that's
[35:48] in here but every one of you individuals
[35:51] the day will declare
[35:54] your works
[35:56] whether they've been good or where
[35:58] they've been selfish or whatever they
[36:01] are the day now that's all of us young
[36:03] middle-aged teenagers 20 whatever you
[36:06] are
[36:06] now what's going to try the fire
[36:09] because it shall be revealed by fire and
[36:12] the fire shall try every man's work as
[36:15] what sort that it is
[36:18] if any man's work abides which he hath
[36:22] built thereupon
[36:24] he shall receive a reward if any man's
[36:27] work shall be burned
[36:30] you shall suffer loss
[36:33] but he himself shall be saved
[36:36] yet so is by fire
[36:38] now this separates works
[36:41] from your salvation
[36:43] I'm sure glad God does it that way too
[36:46] so you can imagine now there'll be all
[36:48] kinds of people that will come up
[36:50] live down through time like lot foolish
[36:53] virgin type there's been in every age
[36:56] and they themself the work will not
[36:59] stand a lot of these good people that we
[37:02] know
[37:03] the work will be destroyed absolutely
[37:07] annihilated and destroyed they'll have
[37:11] nothing nothing
[37:14] to be rewarded for
[37:16] but saved
[37:17] that's by far
[37:19] but what a wasted life
[37:22] what a wasted life
[37:24] to have lived 30 40 50 60 70 80 years
[37:27] and think you've done this and this and
[37:29] this and this for God but because it was
[37:32] off the wrong Foundation
[37:34] and then when you stand before him
[37:37] and when you stand there there's nothing
[37:39] with you or you're praying all your
[37:42] preaching if you're as a preacher all
[37:45] that you've done and you stand there
[37:47] with absolutely nothing
[37:50] they're standing there by yourself so
[37:52] you look around and say what in the
[37:54] world
[37:55] so each of us want to be careful doing
[37:57] that how many has a need to that
[38:01] let's just told that in our hearts as we
[38:03] go before the Lord Heavenly Father we
[38:06] counted such an awesome
[38:08] opportunity to be gathered together
[38:10] tonight we thank you so much for your
[38:13] presence we thank you for your word
[38:15] thank you for everything that you mean
[38:17] to us
[38:18] Lord Jesus as we Endeavor to look into
[38:21] your word tonight I pray that you'd help
[38:23] all of us
[38:24] begin with me father
[38:26] help me Lord God because I know that the
[38:28] sword Cuts two ways most coming and
[38:32] going
[38:33] so I pray that you'd begin with me and
[38:35] work on me and work on these people
[38:39] not only the visible but the invisible
[38:41] audience may we look at things somewhat
[38:44] different after tonight Lord
[38:47] help us to realize that if we live to
[38:50] ourself
[38:51] we live a selfish life
[38:54] then father we're not reflecting your
[38:57] life
[38:58] because eternal life is living for
[39:01] others
[39:03] and it's not living for those who love
[39:05] us
[39:06] it's actually living for those who hate
[39:08] us
[39:10] that's what you did
[39:11] so help us father as we look into your
[39:14] word that we can see we need to move
[39:16] higher
[39:17] we need to pray more we need to seek you
[39:20] more we need to get ourselves and our
[39:22] feelings and what we think about us so
[39:25] much our selfishness out of the way so
[39:28] the spirit of God can live through us
[39:30] granted to not father we pray in Jesus
[39:33] name amen God bless you you may be
[39:36] seated
[39:38] now most of you have been saved long
[39:40] enough to know that we are not saved by
[39:43] works and the church said
[39:46] we are not saved by works we're not
[39:49] saved by anything that we do but works
[39:53] are important
[39:55] our works required
[39:58] for every individual that has eternal
[40:00] life well yes and no because
[40:03] eternal life
[40:04] will live itself out of us and express
[40:08] itself in the right types of Works once
[40:11] we understand that we become the channel
[40:14] by which eternal life can live out of
[40:17] in that works can be helping the poor it
[40:21] can be helping people at church it can
[40:24] be helping your neighbor as we would say
[40:27] that was a reference used quite a bit in
[40:28] the Bible about your neighbor and Jesus
[40:31] used that in the parable several times
[40:33] of course and yet it can go beyond those
[40:36] that live in your neighborhood it can go
[40:38] beyond those that live and you're
[40:40] cul-de-sac it can go for us say helping
[40:44] our brothers and sisters in Uganda
[40:46] Tanzania Zimbabwe India Philippines
[40:49] which we have by God's grace over the
[40:52] years but yet it's not even just those
[40:55] who agree with us because Jesus said the
[40:59] Publican and The Sinner can do that they
[41:02] love those that love them but eternal
[41:05] life goes beyond human life so eternal
[41:08] life enables us to love those that would
[41:12] absolutely kill us
[41:15] if they had a chance
[41:17] now how many have eternal life
[41:21] wow
[41:23] so eternal life is living for the man
[41:26] that would pull his 9mm out of his
[41:29] pocket pull back the hammer put it right
[41:31] up to the side of your head and blow
[41:34] your brains all over the pew
[41:37] but yet you would do something for him
[41:40] before he did that to you
[41:45] well I guess I'm also making all the
[41:47] call First shouldn't I now think about
[41:50] it eternal life is so easy to say it's
[41:54] so easy well I went up to the Altar and
[41:56] I got eternal life I accepted the Lord
[41:58] and I got eternal life I believe I have
[42:00] eternal life but eternal life has
[42:02] attributes and eternal life will Express
[42:05] Itself by works now one of those works
[42:10] is fasting now I've been asked in the
[42:13] last
[42:14] probably at least two months or so
[42:17] several times by people wanting to know
[42:20] about fasting and one of the reasons
[42:24] that I've been asked about it is several
[42:26] people has asked me about going on a
[42:28] fast for Erica for her healing
[42:32] and others have asked about fasting when
[42:35] should we fast how should we fast and I
[42:38] thought since we were dealing with this
[42:39] about works that we would look at this
[42:42] part tonight so instead of answering one
[42:44] person's question then another and then
[42:46] another and then another I'll answer
[42:48] them all from right here hopefully
[42:49] sometimes I make more than I answer
[42:51] which goes with that too but fasting of
[42:55] course is not a new thing in the New
[42:57] Testament it was something that the Jews
[42:59] did in the Old Testament it was
[43:01] something all through the law that they
[43:04] did but it does somewhat change in the
[43:06] New Testament and you remember the
[43:08] Republicans and the Pharisees they
[43:10] fasted often and they asked the Lord
[43:12] Jesus why is it that your disciples do
[43:15] not fast well he said while the
[43:17] bridegroom is with them there's no need
[43:19] for them to fast but do we fast
[43:23] for healing
[43:25] do we fast for faith
[43:29] now listen carefully you're doing good
[43:31] don't answer me so you won't get trapped
[43:34] do we fast for to please God do we fast
[43:39] to get God's attention
[43:41] turn with me to Matthew chapter 17 verse
[43:44] 14. and when they were come to the
[43:47] multitude there came to him a man a
[43:49] certain man kneeling down to him and
[43:51] saying Lord have mercy on my son for he
[43:54] is a lunatic
[43:56] and sorvax for off times he falls into
[44:00] the fire and off into the water and I
[44:03] brought him to thy disciples and they
[44:05] could not cure him now listen carefully
[44:07] remember Jesus had sent them out seven
[44:12] chapters prior to this and Matthew 10.
[44:16] and he gave them power to cast out
[44:18] Devils heal the sick do many great
[44:22] things and they come back rejoicing and
[44:25] Jesus said I beheld Satan as Lightning
[44:29] cast down out of heaven
[44:32] so these apostles were sent forth under
[44:35] a power and it was that power that we
[44:39] looked at Sunday which is called
[44:40] excusion
[44:42] now it's nothing that they had within
[44:45] themselves by virtue of their own life
[44:49] but it was a jurisdiction and an
[44:52] authority that was given to them so they
[44:56] were sent out like a State Trooper like
[44:58] a magistrate like a judge somebody like
[45:01] that you go there you do this you do
[45:03] that that's how they operated and cast
[45:07] out Devils but now they run across one
[45:10] that this excusia Authority did not
[45:15] cover
[45:16] now I don't know if you understand this
[45:17] or not but I'll make it as simple as I
[45:19] can but demons are in different degrees
[45:24] now I don't understand myself why that
[45:28] somebody with epilepsy that that one is
[45:31] so hard
[45:33] but that Devil is a hard devil to get
[45:36] rid of
[45:37] as a matter of fact the prophet said it
[45:40] was the only one that ever got away from
[45:44] him
[45:45] so that tells you now this is why of
[45:48] course that he would tell the people to
[45:50] keep their children there if they didn't
[45:52] believe leave because that Spirit was
[45:55] going to leave and it was going to look
[45:57] not for a hog not for a bird not for a
[45:59] horse it's going to look for a human
[46:01] being to get into
[46:03] so the Lord Jesus watch now he's going
[46:06] to address this and the disciples no
[46:08] doubt they were shocked because they had
[46:10] just went out and they'd cast out all
[46:13] kinds of devils they had cleansed the
[46:15] leper they had healed all kinds of
[46:17] Affliction well this man brings his boy
[46:20] and he was a lunatic so he was of a
[46:24] further degree into this sickness and
[46:28] this possession then apparently anything
[46:30] they had run across when they were sent
[46:33] out prior to this now notice what the
[46:36] man says I brought him to thy disciples
[46:38] and they could not cure him then Jesus
[46:41] answered and said o faithless and
[46:43] perverse generation how long shall I be
[46:46] with you how long shall I suffer you
[46:48] bring him hither to me and Jesus rebuked
[46:53] the devil and he departed out of him and
[46:56] the child was cured from that very hour
[46:59] now watch the apostles then came the
[47:01] disciples to Jesus apart and said why
[47:04] could not we cast him out now they're
[47:08] they're perplexed they just did not
[47:11] understand why couldn't we do this you
[47:14] sent us out in Matthew 10 to do this and
[47:17] we tried it we done exactly what we've
[47:20] done on all the others and it worked for
[47:22] them but it didn't work through him for
[47:24] this guy what was the problem now listen
[47:27] two aspects and Jesus said unto them
[47:31] because of your unbelief well because of
[47:37] your unbelief for verily I say unto you
[47:41] if you have faith as of a grain of
[47:43] mustard seed you shall say unto this
[47:46] mountain remove hints to Yonder place
[47:49] and it shall remove and nothing I know
[47:53] we quote it all the time that nothing is
[47:56] impossible with God but God said nothing
[48:00] is impossible to you
[48:04] now can anybody say been to that
[48:06] scripture
[48:07] now notice this is our God himself
[48:10] saying this
[48:12] if you'll say to this mountain remove
[48:14] him hence To Yonder place and it shall
[48:17] remove and nothing shall be impossible
[48:21] unto you but now what so Jesus deals
[48:25] with first part of verse 20 an aspect
[48:28] the reason they could not do this and he
[48:31] crucified it as unbelief
[48:34] then Jesus comes down in verse 21 how be
[48:38] it this kind
[48:41] this kind now this was a different kind
[48:46] than what they had run into
[48:49] in Matthew 10. now the kind they had run
[48:53] into in Matthew 10 did not require
[48:57] require prayer and fasting the way this
[49:02] one did
[49:03] how could they do it under excusia
[49:06] Authority now remember there's two Greek
[49:10] words used for power one of them is
[49:12] excusio which is an authority the other
[49:15] is dunamis which is a power that's in
[49:18] You by Nature so it's something living
[49:21] in you the apostles didn't have that
[49:23] because it didn't have the Holy Ghost
[49:24] yet but what the Hat was a jurisdiction
[49:27] now once Jesus shows them how this kind
[49:31] goeth not out but by prayer and fasting
[49:36] prayer and fasting by whom
[49:39] now Jesus did not say well that the
[49:43] person that's sick this is not actually
[49:46] for the sick person
[49:49] it's actually for the person who's going
[49:52] to cast out the devil
[49:56] oh you didn't know that well you've
[49:58] learned something new tonight now watch
[50:00] Jesus is not dealing with the lunatic
[50:03] boy
[50:04] he's not dealing with the boy's father
[50:07] he's answering the apostles and they're
[50:12] they ask him the question why couldn't
[50:13] we do this and Jesus in verse 20 and
[50:16] verse 21 it said well the first phase of
[50:19] this was your unbelief and then secondly
[50:23] it's tied that you must pray and you
[50:27] must fast to get yourself out of the way
[50:31] now apparently because this power was
[50:34] not of an inward virtue and nature they
[50:37] were not connected from their soul to
[50:40] this excuse you because it could come
[50:42] and leave that's the way the prophets of
[50:44] the Old Testament worked under the
[50:46] anointing so it would come into prophesy
[50:48] visions and that it would leave it might
[50:50] leave him for weeks might leave them for
[50:52] months and then it would come back on
[50:54] them again but God didn't want that to
[50:56] be so in the New Testament age he wanted
[50:58] the Holy Ghost to be ever present every
[51:00] day of your life from the time you get
[51:02] it to the day you die it's yours
[51:05] but notice now the Lord Jesus then
[51:07] separates a certain degree of demonic
[51:11] warfare and he says that this particular
[51:14] kind can only come forth by prayer and
[51:19] fasting now again I say it is not so
[51:24] much the person that is sick
[51:27] and it is not so much other people that
[51:31] are fasting for the person that is sick
[51:35] now there's one thing that will tell you
[51:39] if you should fast or not
[51:43] I'm going to keep you wondering for a
[51:44] few minutes before I tell you what it is
[51:45] now what's the
[51:47] what's them says many times in these
[51:49] meetings
[51:52] sometimes fast
[51:54] for several days I've been fasting then
[51:57] three or four days and I do that because
[52:00] the Bible said these come out only by
[52:06] fast and prayer so once you notice now
[52:09] how the prophet applies this scripture
[52:12] of the Lord Jesus so it was not to the
[52:16] sick necessarily it was not even to
[52:19] other members of the body unless God
[52:22] would burden them to do so but the
[52:25] scripture was actually to be applied to
[52:28] the ministers that's going to Endeavor
[52:31] to cast out these evil spirits
[52:34] watch him again I usually like to fast
[52:38] about three days before the healing
[52:42] service so I told him I'd speak speaking
[52:45] to about a pastor there and if anyone
[52:48] there would pray for them just like a
[52:50] regular prayer line now what I found
[52:52] over and over again when the prophet
[52:55] would use the word fast fasting fasted
[52:59] all the forms of it that it would be
[53:01] making reference to either himself or
[53:05] other ministers that would fast to be
[53:08] able to get themselves out of the way
[53:10] now there were a few references as well
[53:13] to where that some people had fasted and
[53:16] they were fasting for brother Branham
[53:18] going out in the meetings and he
[53:20] actually called their name and said this
[53:23] brother setting right here and this
[53:25] sister right over here they have been
[53:27] fasting for several days for these
[53:30] services and he said that's why you see
[53:32] God moving the way he has ass but it's
[53:36] not that we fast in order to find favor
[53:41] with God now me my prior uh before
[53:45] coming to the message my prior
[53:48] understanding of being a Pentecostal and
[53:51] I was very legalistic so I fasted often
[53:56] three days five days seven days ten days
[54:01] 14 days not a week went by in my life
[54:07] that I did not fast
[54:09] some of those would be on a seven day
[54:12] fast we would be driving I'd be driving
[54:14] a tent truck setting up a tent 90 in the
[54:18] shade
[54:19] absolutely every week of your life
[54:22] sometimes going being Louisiana one
[54:25] night closed out be in Indiana the next
[54:29] night 21 days in a row
[54:31] and yet naughty one bite of food
[54:34] and I got to the spot if I did not do
[54:38] that I felt like God would not use me so
[54:42] I got under this legalistic view now God
[54:46] does not want us to do works even good
[54:50] works because of legalism you understand
[54:54] that he wants us to do it because we
[54:57] love him and we love his people
[55:01] now notice again the prophet said
[55:03] usually before I start in the prayer
[55:06] line I take three days of fasting and
[55:11] praying but notice he doesn't send a
[55:13] message to say to Minneapolis Saint Paul
[55:16] or or Duluth Minnesota or wherever he
[55:19] would go and say have the sick people to
[55:21] fast three days or have the local people
[55:25] to fast three days but it was something
[55:28] that he did himself why to get himself
[55:33] out of the way now even though no doubt
[55:37] a lot of My fasting was in vain I'm
[55:41] totally convinced of that in vain just
[55:44] legalism that's all but in my mind it
[55:49] made me feel better
[55:51] no because I done something and I felt
[55:55] like God but honor my face that is one
[55:58] pitiful situation
[56:00] because God does not move for us because
[56:04] we are so righteous and so good
[56:06] now sure we've got to live right there's
[56:08] things we have to do but notice when you
[56:11] come into this aspect of the ministry
[56:13] now for those of you that have never
[56:14] fasted very long time has ever fasted
[56:16] three days
[56:17] five
[56:19] Seven Ten fourteen
[56:22] gets fewer and fear and fewer and the
[56:24] thing of it is most of you will never
[56:27] need to
[56:28] so don't feel bad don't leave your not
[56:30] thinking oh my goodness I'm I've never
[56:32] done nothing for god well first of all
[56:34] there's nothing in the Bible that even
[56:37] requires you to do that 14 days
[56:40] as a matter of fact the prophet deals
[56:42] with an enticing Spirits it was a big
[56:45] thing in Pentecost everybody wanting to
[56:48] fast 40 days
[56:50] and the prophet dealt with it and said
[56:52] for some people it was demons getting on
[56:56] them to fast for 40 days not the Holy
[56:59] Ghost
[57:00] now let me just go ahead and blow you
[57:02] away right now if God ever leads you to
[57:06] fast you will not get hungry
[57:12] yup y'all like me you realize you've
[57:14] wasted a lot of good food ain't you
[57:16] you will not get hungry until it's time
[57:21] for you to end that fast
[57:23] that's what I said I'm convinced I've
[57:25] totally ruined most of mine because I
[57:27] was hungry from day one because whenever
[57:30] I know that I'm on the fast and I miss
[57:32] my 10 o'clock snap my little guts eating
[57:34] my big gut and in my big gut eats my
[57:36] little one and by lunchtime and by by
[57:39] supper time we think Lord I'll never
[57:40] make it I might as well have went ahead
[57:42] and eat because it's a good sign God
[57:44] never put me on the fast
[57:47] there's a supernatural element that
[57:50] comes with God leading you to fast and
[57:53] one of those Supernatural elements is
[57:55] you will not be hungry
[57:58] I'll go ahead and look at me funny and
[58:00] I'll prove it to you in a minute now
[58:02] watch this again the prophet said this
[58:04] has been a fast day fasting and praying
[58:07] that God would Grant his prayer His
[58:09] blessings upon you people tonight now I
[58:13] don't expect you to understand this but
[58:15] I found it myself that whenever somehow
[58:19] you get weaker and you get less of
[58:23] yourself and you get more out of the way
[58:27] the more that he can move through you
[58:30] and yet it's only like you've got a
[58:33] small
[58:34] margin of error to where you get out of
[58:38] the way and then you're so weak that you
[58:41] can't even be used does that make sense
[58:43] to you it's like you've got to get out
[58:45] of the way and the more you deny
[58:47] yourself and the more you know the more
[58:49] God lets you go through something and
[58:51] say Lord have mercy I I can't take
[58:53] another day I can't I can't get through
[58:55] another day with all this pressure and
[58:57] yet I've seen it myself that when you
[58:59] get to that spot God will do some of the
[59:01] greatest things he's ever done in your
[59:03] life when you're right there but yet if
[59:06] you go just a little bit too far the
[59:09] other way you'll have a breakdown it's
[59:13] it's absolutely phenomenal look at
[59:15] Elijah when he had come to that very
[59:17] spot and it's like he was there in that
[59:20] that margin but he went just a little
[59:23] bit farther over the other way and had a
[59:26] nervous breakdown under of course the
[59:28] junior portrayed where God found it so
[59:31] there's something about fasting and
[59:33] you're giving of yourself well and the
[59:36] anointing coming on you and you're
[59:37] you're dealing with demons of course and
[59:40] you're dealing with God's people at the
[59:41] same time and you've got to be so
[59:43] careful when you're there in that realm
[59:45] and yet you'll get so far out of
[59:48] yourself it's always been with me even
[59:51] when I was a Pentecostal preacher it
[59:54] will start in my fingers the tips of my
[59:57] fingers my fingers I'll start losing
[59:59] feeling it'll start working its way up
[1:00:02] you'll notice me sometimes when I'm
[1:00:04] praying for people and I'll I'll do this
[1:00:06] because I'm starting to lose feeling in
[1:00:09] my hands at the same times it reaches up
[1:00:12] about here I start losing it in my lips
[1:00:15] it'll work out of my lips and come up
[1:00:18] around my mouth and I get to where I
[1:00:20] can't hardly talk I can't hardly say
[1:00:23] anything whenever I'm preaching it's
[1:00:25] been since I was a boy preacher I'll
[1:00:28] start seeing spots before me I'll see it
[1:00:31] to the right I'll see it to the left
[1:00:33] it'll be dark star much like this in my
[1:00:36] peripheral vision and then it'll start
[1:00:38] coming closer and closer when it moves
[1:00:40] here I better stop or I'm fixing to get
[1:00:43] in trouble now God gives you those
[1:00:45] things as just a warning remember the
[1:00:48] man that was with brother Branham they
[1:00:49] would watch him in the visions and
[1:00:51] Bennett Paul or whoever the manager of
[1:00:53] the campaign they would come up and they
[1:00:56] would put their hands on brother random
[1:00:58] side like this and if brother Branham
[1:01:01] would take his arms and put down on
[1:01:04] their hands it was a sign to them so it
[1:01:07] would let them know he's all right or
[1:01:10] he's not all right and if he one sign
[1:01:13] was he wasn't all right take him off
[1:01:15] take him off so they would take him off
[1:01:18] the platform if the other one was there
[1:01:20] then he would be able to let them know
[1:01:22] he's all right for a little while longer
[1:01:24] now what is he he's in that margin that
[1:01:28] fine margin to where the most will be
[1:01:31] done when you're right there but you're
[1:01:34] almost close to the spot yourself that
[1:01:37] you're about to lose Consciousness
[1:01:39] you're about to lose from the realm
[1:01:42] that's all around you and you're getting
[1:01:44] I hope ain't hoping you know maybe not
[1:01:46] you don't think I'm a Nut tonight but
[1:01:48] it's to where you're just in that spot
[1:01:51] now this is of course what fasting does
[1:01:53] and it helps to be able to get yourself
[1:01:56] out of the way to where you're getting
[1:01:59] weaker and weaker it's like the weaker
[1:02:01] you get the stronger the anointing will
[1:02:04] get and you've seen the long prayer
[1:02:06] lines down the youth camp and places
[1:02:08] like that and whenever you get so weak
[1:02:10] and the brothers will watch in they can
[1:02:12] see your knees buckling and this and
[1:02:14] that and they'll grab you but you know
[1:02:16] yourself you hate to sit down worse than
[1:02:19] anything because the anointing is at its
[1:02:22] peak and you want to be right there in
[1:02:25] the middle of it you want to stay right
[1:02:27] there as long as you can and yet the
[1:02:31] spirit of God is always there to help us
[1:02:34] but it's like the more he can get us out
[1:02:36] of the way the more he can use us so
[1:02:39] here the Lord Jesus is speaking
[1:02:41] something to the to the disciples
[1:02:43] pre-holy ghost of course and no doubt
[1:02:46] they pondered about how in the world
[1:02:47] could that be but after the Holy Ghost
[1:02:50] come you imagine brother John he brought
[1:02:52] this back to their memory now I know
[1:02:54] what he meant now I understand now I've
[1:02:58] got dunamis inside of me which will help
[1:03:01] me to get out of the way and I will fast
[1:03:04] or I will pray I will be in that
[1:03:06] presence of God and it will help me now
[1:03:10] once again the prophet said usually in a
[1:03:13] fast I never
[1:03:15] feel hungry
[1:03:17] if you feel hungry it's time to eat
[1:03:24] Jesus afterwards was hungry now he's
[1:03:27] based on this on the scripture whether
[1:03:29] Jesus fasted 40 days and nights and then
[1:03:31] the Bible says and afterward he was a
[1:03:34] hunger it doesn't say he was hungry on
[1:03:36] day two day three 38 but the hunger
[1:03:39] returned to him so it was a sign that he
[1:03:43] was to eat but you see tradition what
[1:03:46] tradition does tradition is so far away
[1:03:49] so many times from the word notice again
[1:03:52] an enticing spirit says nothing in the
[1:03:53] word that tells you to have a 40-day
[1:03:56] fast not a thing there's nothing in the
[1:03:58] world telling you to fast lest God would
[1:04:01] tell you and if you fast you ain't going
[1:04:04] to get hungry and go all these things
[1:04:07] after your fasting brother you will be
[1:04:10] joy and happy all the time and that's
[1:04:14] why I'm telling you a lot of my fashion
[1:04:16] was an absolute waste because I become
[1:04:18] one hungry Grouch
[1:04:21] [Music]
[1:04:23] yeah I did I mean I didn't feel good I
[1:04:27] was wore out you're putting up a tent
[1:04:29] whatever more you can't already go you
[1:04:31] drag yourself in you're aching and
[1:04:33] hurting all over and you're as weak as I
[1:04:35] don't know what you ain't got enough
[1:04:36] strength or to do anything I didn't have
[1:04:39] no happiness I wasn't joyful well that's
[1:04:41] what I say if it's a real fast from God
[1:04:44] it's going to go but the direction God
[1:04:46] says but yet this is a work which could
[1:04:50] be done that's not laying in harmony
[1:04:53] with the scripture many times so people
[1:04:56] because of old Pentecostal ideas or
[1:04:59] whatever more just their own conception
[1:05:01] of it well I'm going to do this and I'm
[1:05:03] going to fast for so and so to be healed
[1:05:05] and I'm going to fast for Faith and I'm
[1:05:07] going to fast for that fasting is to get
[1:05:09] ourself out of the way amen now notice
[1:05:12] after your fasting brother you'll be joy
[1:05:15] and happy all the time it said don't
[1:05:17] appear before men like Hypocrites with a
[1:05:20] long sad face I'm on a 40-day fast my
[1:05:23] plates won't fit me anymore now he's
[1:05:24] talking about Dentures my plates won't
[1:05:27] fit me no more I've lost 30 pounds and
[1:05:29] they told me I looked better after this
[1:05:31] is over oh nonsense it's enticing
[1:05:34] spirits of the devil amen and the church
[1:05:37] said
[1:05:38] no so you know I know it's maybe hard
[1:05:41] for you to believe but why in the world
[1:05:42] would anybody want to go on a 40-day
[1:05:45] fashion to be of the devil well some of
[1:05:47] them it's amazing what Pride they get
[1:05:49] it's amazing how they have to tell
[1:05:52] everybody they just come off of a 40-day
[1:05:54] fast and there was such uh listen I've
[1:05:56] heard it over and over again I know this
[1:05:59] is not something that I've read about
[1:06:01] I've heard it over and over again and
[1:06:04] yet you realize and you know even back
[1:06:06] then there's something wrong about the
[1:06:08] whole thing but you didn't know what it
[1:06:10] was thank God for the truth
[1:06:12] notice again it says Christianity is not
[1:06:15] something God's not one you have to beg
[1:06:19] and cry and plead
[1:06:23] and fast and starve
[1:06:26] so when we fast we are not doing it to
[1:06:30] plead with God and beg God look friends
[1:06:33] we are not Beggars we are sons and
[1:06:37] daughters and how are we supposed to
[1:06:40] come the Throne of God what's boldness
[1:06:42] not as a beggar my goodness we don't
[1:06:45] come like what we're we live in the you
[1:06:48] know the South Side of Heaven and we
[1:06:50] ain't got no blessings and oh Lord just
[1:06:52] give me a calm from the table and I I
[1:06:54] don't need nothing else God's Prophet
[1:06:56] said if you're a child of God everything
[1:06:58] he purchased is yours you've got to
[1:07:01] bring them quotes and them scriptures
[1:07:03] together you live under that mentality
[1:07:05] well I'm just an old dog well you might
[1:07:07] have been an old dog but if you've got
[1:07:09] the Holy Ghost you'll end the dog no
[1:07:11] more you're a child of God filled with
[1:07:13] eternal life and the Holy Ghost so we
[1:07:16] don't have to come to God it's so easy
[1:07:18] for us if we're not careful and the time
[1:07:20] of distress and trouble we get back into
[1:07:23] the begging notion the begging and the
[1:07:27] pleading notion as if though that
[1:07:30] somehow we lose our status as children
[1:07:32] of God we don't have to do that notice
[1:07:35] God's not one you have to beg and cry
[1:07:38] and plead and fast and starve and
[1:07:40] everything like that to get to certainly
[1:07:43] not I'm not degrading a fast now I'm
[1:07:47] down in the quote it says I believe in
[1:07:49] fasting certainly but when you fast you
[1:07:51] don't hunger Jesus after he got through
[1:07:54] fasting the Bible said he was hungry God
[1:07:58] puts a fast on you you don't put it on
[1:08:02] yourself
[1:08:04] God puts a fast on you you don't put it
[1:08:09] on yourself and the church said
[1:08:12] amen so then if people could get in this
[1:08:16] and they oh I'm doing this for God I'm
[1:08:18] doing this I'm doing that but if it
[1:08:20] doesn't line up to the teaching of the
[1:08:22] message it works and sacrifices that
[1:08:25] they have done but there won't be no
[1:08:28] reward for it why it's not based on the
[1:08:31] scripture or the message look friends if
[1:08:34] we're going to be rewarded for what we
[1:08:36] do it must match God's protocol or God's
[1:08:41] requirement or they don't get rewarded
[1:08:43] for it my goodness why would we want to
[1:08:46] waste our time I don't want to waste
[1:08:47] mine to you my goodness why waste some
[1:08:50] good beans and maters and taters if God
[1:08:52] don't put it on me why should I feel bad
[1:08:54] I'm going to enjoy my wife's good
[1:08:56] cooking if God puts a fast on me then I
[1:08:59] trust God will lead me to do it and
[1:09:01] he'll let me know whenever it's time for
[1:09:03] me to quit but I am not going to fast
[1:09:05] well I don't want to fast because I need
[1:09:07] to be closer to God where's that in the
[1:09:08] Bible
[1:09:09] or is that in the message well Amen
[1:09:12] Brother Don notice down in Beaumont he
[1:09:14] said so I've been fasting for about two
[1:09:16] three days and I was going to go preach
[1:09:18] that afternoon I thought well it seems
[1:09:21] like he said you never want to fast
[1:09:23] until you're led to fast then if you get
[1:09:26] hungry it's time to eat again he says
[1:09:30] when God puts a fast on you you don't
[1:09:33] get hungry so if you start fasting it's
[1:09:36] quarter to seven and by nine your big
[1:09:39] guts eating your little gut well you
[1:09:40] just know right there you don't miss God
[1:09:44] a brother Donnie the word did you figure
[1:09:46] out won't get hungry well because this
[1:09:48] is the teaching of the message to start
[1:09:49] serpent eat water baptism and it's also
[1:09:52] the scripture that's how I figure
[1:09:54] because if God puts it on us to fast
[1:09:57] there is a supernatural element in the
[1:10:01] fast it won't let you get hungry
[1:10:03] [Applause]
[1:10:05] thank you Jesus I see everybody's going
[1:10:08] out after supper and need a Big Mac huh
[1:10:10] after church
[1:10:11] so he said when God puts a fast on you
[1:10:14] you don't get hungry it's God dealing
[1:10:17] with you Jesus was afterwards and hunger
[1:10:20] see after his fast was over now notice
[1:10:24] again in fundamental Foundation of Faith
[1:10:26] as I've said Faith doesn't come by
[1:10:30] fasting Faith doesn't come but what I'm
[1:10:34] fasting for more faith you're wrong
[1:10:37] you don't fast for more faith
[1:10:41] oh my goodness well I guess I should
[1:10:42] have preached this 20 years ago and said
[1:10:44] it tonight huh Faith doesn't come by
[1:10:47] praying
[1:10:48] reading a book all of that's good
[1:10:51] fasting praying reading reading a book
[1:10:54] but faith comes by a saddle something
[1:10:57] that's in the human heart that tells you
[1:11:01] just as sure as you come to this church
[1:11:04] tonight
[1:11:06] so if God lays on your heart to fast
[1:11:09] fast my brother fast my sister and if
[1:11:14] you go to the end of the day and all of
[1:11:17] a sudden you get hungry that's the time
[1:11:19] to break your fast
[1:11:20] if you go all day long and you don't
[1:11:23] feel hungry you get up the next day you
[1:11:26] don't feel hungry How will I know
[1:11:28] brother Donnie you've got to let you
[1:11:30] know the supernatural will move off of
[1:11:32] your belly and the belly will go to
[1:11:34] talking to you it's that simple it's not
[1:11:37] complicated if it's a day a half a day
[1:11:40] do you understand or if you've ever said
[1:11:42] to this or not brother Brennan acts of
[1:11:44] the days that it would go totally
[1:11:45] without food three to four days before
[1:11:48] prayer lines that would also be days
[1:11:50] that he would eat what he called soft
[1:11:54] foods not pleasant Foods
[1:11:58] Pleasant Foods now it did not give us a
[1:12:02] list so I don't know what they were but
[1:12:04] apparently it was something that he
[1:12:07] deprived himself of something that was
[1:12:11] pleasant something else he would eat for
[1:12:14] energy strength and so on but it was
[1:12:16] something what's the whole thing about
[1:12:18] it's to deny ourselves you see God knows
[1:12:21] that as long as we're here and these
[1:12:24] bodies we're going to wrestle we're
[1:12:26] going to wrestle against our old flesh
[1:12:28] and it'll be our constant enemy now how
[1:12:31] many beliefs tonight by God's word that
[1:12:34] works are absolutely something that
[1:12:37] every child of God will have in their
[1:12:39] life every child of God now whether
[1:12:41] you're a teenager tonight or you've been
[1:12:43] saved for 40 or 50 years it doesn't
[1:12:45] really matter every child of God when we
[1:12:48] stand before the Lord you young people
[1:12:50] here it will not be you and your mom and
[1:12:53] your dad and God will stand and look at
[1:12:56] you all as a family unit and say okay I
[1:13:00] see that you are Joel's son so you all
[1:13:03] Stand Together your mom Tamika your two
[1:13:05] brothers y'all stand there together no
[1:13:07] it won't be that you'll stand together
[1:13:09] so much as a family but we will walk
[1:13:12] before this great Throne of our Lord
[1:13:15] Jesus not the white Judgment of
[1:13:16] Revelation 21 but word rewards are given
[1:13:20] out every young person that if the
[1:13:23] Rapture takes place in their 15 16 17
[1:13:26] years old they will stand before the
[1:13:28] Lord and they will give an account for
[1:13:31] what they have done the works that they
[1:13:33] have done for the kingdom of God
[1:13:37] Acts chapter 9 verse 36.
[1:13:40] now there was that japa a certain
[1:13:43] disciple named Tabitha
[1:13:47] wow
[1:13:49] a woman called a disciple
[1:13:52] a certain disciple Now read your Bible
[1:13:55] and you'll notice most of the time it
[1:13:57] was in reference to men but this woman
[1:14:00] she must have been a very outstanding
[1:14:03] sister now there was that Joppa a
[1:14:05] certain disciple called named Tabitha
[1:14:08] which is by interpretation it's called
[1:14:11] Dorcas
[1:14:13] this woman was full
[1:14:17] full I love this word filled up as
[1:14:21] opposed to empty this woman was full
[1:14:26] thoroughly permeated
[1:14:29] thoroughly permeated with
[1:14:32] complete like nothing so this woman was
[1:14:36] full of good works and alms Deeds look
[1:14:41] at this word mercy pity especially is
[1:14:45] exhibited and giving alms charity or
[1:14:48] donations to the poor so this woman had
[1:14:52] all kinds of good works and yet we know
[1:14:56] that she was not a woman preacher we
[1:14:58] know that as far as the Bible it does
[1:15:01] not record that she prophesied spoke in
[1:15:04] tongues had Visions dreams anything like
[1:15:08] that but the Bible is going to tell us
[1:15:10] what she did now listen carefully and it
[1:15:13] came to pass in those days that she was
[1:15:15] sick and died human they had washed they
[1:15:18] later in an upper chamber for as much as
[1:15:20] lit up was nigh unto Joppa and the
[1:15:23] disciples had heard that Peter was there
[1:15:25] they sent unto him two men Desiring him
[1:15:29] that he would not delay to come to them
[1:15:30] then Peter arose and went to them when
[1:15:33] he was come they brought him to him into
[1:15:35] the upper chamber now notice he's right
[1:15:37] here they took the sister straight up
[1:15:39] there and they laid her down all the
[1:15:41] widows stood by him weeping and showing
[1:15:45] the coats and garments which Dorcas had
[1:15:49] made while she was with them
[1:15:54] now notice what a lot of her Works
[1:15:57] consisted of no casting out Devils no
[1:16:01] heat in the sick no raising the dead but
[1:16:04] this sister had the ability to sow
[1:16:08] so here was these people and they were
[1:16:11] even either wearing them or had had them
[1:16:14] in their hands and they were showing
[1:16:16] Peter look what their sister did for me
[1:16:19] I want you to look at the shawl look at
[1:16:21] this sweater uh look at this dress look
[1:16:24] at this you know cloak whatever it was I
[1:16:27] want you to look and that was just all
[1:16:29] kinds of them that was around and no
[1:16:31] doubt some of the other people that did
[1:16:33] not have sown Goods by which Tabitha had
[1:16:36] made them they would say well she gave
[1:16:39] me an armstein now an arms deeper is not
[1:16:41] a tangible piece of material but it was
[1:16:43] something that she did for them a little
[1:16:46] pity a little Mercy maybe she walked by
[1:16:49] them one day and they were begging on
[1:16:50] the street or she saw them as they went
[1:16:52] to get some fruits and vegetables at the
[1:16:55] market that day and she saw that when
[1:16:57] they come up to pay for it and they
[1:16:59] counted the little money and they didn't
[1:17:00] have enough to pay for it so she sneaked
[1:17:03] up there and said how much does she like
[1:17:05] well she likes uh three shekels okay
[1:17:07] well legit let me take care of that and
[1:17:10] you know that they was and they said
[1:17:11] that she'd done this for me and she done
[1:17:13] that for me now keep in mind what is
[1:17:16] fixing to happen in her life is not
[1:17:20] based upon her works
[1:17:22] but neither did it go against her
[1:17:26] she's fixing to be raised from the dead
[1:17:31] now I've often wondered about reading of
[1:17:34] this woman
[1:17:35] if she would have been a Christian
[1:17:39] that never really did anything for
[1:17:42] anybody else
[1:17:44] but she lived what I call a Lone Ranger
[1:17:48] Christian Life
[1:17:50] now we've got a lot of them around the
[1:17:51] message they feel like they don't have
[1:17:54] to go to church they can stay home and
[1:17:57] be just as good a Christian as they can
[1:17:59] a church if you believe God's prophet he
[1:18:02] told you you cannot do such a thing
[1:18:05] and besides that you are robbing
[1:18:07] yourself and robbing the saints of God
[1:18:10] by staying home there are no such a
[1:18:13] thing in the New Testament as a Lone
[1:18:15] Ranger Christian well praise the Lord
[1:18:18] that ain't even you and Tonto either
[1:18:20] it's a body and we're supposed to help
[1:18:23] one another and minister to one another
[1:18:26] Now The Lone Ranger type Christians if
[1:18:30] they're died like this nobody stands
[1:18:32] there and brings any coats nobody brings
[1:18:35] any arms Deeds why they stayed at home
[1:18:37] they never helped nobody they never done
[1:18:40] nothing for nobody they stayed at home
[1:18:42] and they stayed away from church they
[1:18:44] stayed away from fellowship well I'll
[1:18:47] tell you one thing if I ever do die and
[1:18:48] I hope I do get to be raised from the
[1:18:51] dead I want so many folks flocking in
[1:18:53] this church they stand Plum outside
[1:18:54] there said he done this for man he done
[1:18:57] that for many done that for me well come
[1:18:59] on do something look at me that way I
[1:19:01] don't want it done just for rewards sake
[1:19:03] that's the kind of Christian I want to
[1:19:05] be I want to live my life every day for
[1:19:09] others now I want you to sing if you and
[1:19:12] I would start keeping a record of how
[1:19:15] much time daily that we spend for
[1:19:18] ourself how much of our thoughts are for
[1:19:21] ourselves how much of what we do is for
[1:19:25] ourselves I wonder we would do that for
[1:19:27] a couple of weeks if we would be
[1:19:30] absolutely surprised at how much of our
[1:19:33] time how much of our things of life that
[1:19:36] we have that we would wind up seeing was
[1:19:39] entirely for us
[1:19:42] come on now
[1:19:43] and yet the Lord keeps no record of any
[1:19:47] of that
[1:19:47] [Music]
[1:19:49] according to the Bible there is a book
[1:19:51] of remembrance that God is having
[1:19:55] written on your account
[1:19:57] but none of that involves things you do
[1:19:59] for yourself
[1:20:01] I bought myself this and I've done this
[1:20:04] for myself and I've done that for myself
[1:20:06] and I bragged on myself too and I looked
[1:20:09] in the mirror for 45 minutes I tell you
[1:20:11] what I've seen some man that's just
[1:20:12] about a primpers as women are
[1:20:15] what are you doing worshiping
[1:20:17] you're worshiping that bald head of
[1:20:20] yours and you worshiping the 14 strands
[1:20:22] of hair that you got left you think
[1:20:24] they're so handsome and so cute that you
[1:20:26] can stand there before him here or
[1:20:27] brother let me just tell you need to
[1:20:29] look in my Mary it tells the truth
[1:20:31] some of y'all must have a line mirror
[1:20:33] where'd you get that thing send it back
[1:20:34] to Amazon get you one of them
[1:20:36] truth-telling beers it'll show every
[1:20:38] wrinkle ever gray half amen so this
[1:20:42] sister nothing is mentioned about
[1:20:44] herself but it's mentioned about others
[1:20:47] now remember Luke was the author of the
[1:20:50] book of Acts Luke wasn't even around
[1:20:52] when Jesus was here Matthew Mark and
[1:20:55] John Ward were but Luke was not even
[1:20:58] there but Luke came years later and went
[1:21:01] around from Community to community City
[1:21:04] to city and interviewing Witnesses live
[1:21:08] Witnesses so he would be able to write
[1:21:11] down the gospel of the Book of Luke and
[1:21:14] also the book of Acts so no doubt Luke
[1:21:17] went to the city of Joppa and he must
[1:21:20] have went to lit up and he went there
[1:21:23] asking because this was the mannerism of
[1:21:25] Luke so he wants to ask you anybody here
[1:21:27] know of sister Tabitha anybody know
[1:21:30] about that account I've heard about it
[1:21:32] but Matthew didn't write about it some
[1:21:35] of the others I I want to write this I
[1:21:37] want to write about this Paul never
[1:21:39] mentioned it none the rest of the other
[1:21:41] was written I want to know about this so
[1:21:43] Luke went around and getting
[1:21:45] eyewitnesses what was you there yes I
[1:21:48] was I was one of them sisters our glory
[1:21:50] to call I'll never forget that that day
[1:21:52] I'll tell you one thing we're standing
[1:21:54] there weeping and all of a sudden she
[1:21:55] jumped up running around there clap in
[1:21:57] her hands and worshiping God you'll
[1:21:59] imagine Luke say yes sister tell me how
[1:22:01] I was I'll tell you what no sister
[1:22:02] so-and-so down the street there she was
[1:22:04] there too and that guy down there
[1:22:06] selling pumpkins on the side of the road
[1:22:07] he was down there too and you imagine
[1:22:09] Luke going from one to the other to the
[1:22:11] other in order to write this down aren't
[1:22:13] you glad they done that aren't you glad
[1:22:15] these were men of vision where would we
[1:22:18] be today if these men had not wanted to
[1:22:20] write down these very acts of the Holy
[1:22:23] Ghost
[1:22:24] so here they began to cry no doubt and
[1:22:28] they lament and whenever they do they
[1:22:30] sin and get Peter and then all the
[1:22:32] witness said by him weeping and showing
[1:22:34] the coat and the garments which Dorcas
[1:22:36] had made while she was with sin but
[1:22:39] Peter put them all for us and kneeled
[1:22:42] down and prayed and turning him to the
[1:22:45] body
[1:22:46] I want you to notice
[1:22:48] he turned to the body
[1:22:50] but he calls her name
[1:22:53] he didn't call her body by this name
[1:22:56] notice how Luke separates the body from
[1:23:00] the person
[1:23:01] turning him to the body and said Tabitha
[1:23:07] so he turns to the body the house where
[1:23:11] she lived but he called her name she was
[1:23:14] out there in another dimension somewhere
[1:23:16] her spirit had to be brought back into
[1:23:20] the body so the human name was still
[1:23:23] identified with that soul in those
[1:23:26] Realms somewhere where they went to so
[1:23:29] he turns to the body the empty house and
[1:23:33] he calls her I wonder why he didn't call
[1:23:35] her Dorcas but he calls her apparently
[1:23:38] by her preferred spiritual name
[1:23:42] now he calls her name and watch what
[1:23:45] happens and turning him to the body said
[1:23:49] Tabitha arise and sheep
[1:23:53] opened her eyes
[1:23:55] and when she saw Peter she set up
[1:24:00] so here is a response but I find it so
[1:24:04] amazing now that these works and the
[1:24:06] identification of works and arms Deeds
[1:24:10] are identified with this woman and being
[1:24:13] the type of woman that she was oh don't
[1:24:16] you want to be this type of woman now
[1:24:18] who would ever think that making
[1:24:21] somebody a coat or a cloak or giving
[1:24:24] them a garment or showing them a little
[1:24:27] bit of pity or a little bit of mercy and
[1:24:29] you bought them a meal or you know just
[1:24:31] just something like that that was so
[1:24:33] simple who would ever think that would
[1:24:36] make the pages of the New Testament what
[1:24:39] if it made the pages of the New
[1:24:41] Testament here in this that we've just
[1:24:44] read and we are another book of Acts
[1:24:47] don't you figure there'll be people in
[1:24:50] this second book of Acts that it'll be
[1:24:52] wrote in their life as well
[1:24:55] amen notice Acts chapter 10 verse 34
[1:24:58] then Peter opened his mouth and said of
[1:25:01] a truth now this is after the Gentiles
[1:25:03] had received the Holy Ghost I perceive
[1:25:06] that God is no respecter of persons but
[1:25:08] in every nation he that feareth him and
[1:25:12] work us righteousness
[1:25:14] workers righteousness so we cannot make
[1:25:19] righteousness but we work it so when we
[1:25:24] become righteous which is right standing
[1:25:26] with God we work in the form of
[1:25:31] righteousness and we live that out that
[1:25:35] every nation he that feareth God and
[1:25:37] work us righteousness is accepted with
[1:25:40] him Romans 2 9. tribulation and anguish
[1:25:44] upon every soul of man that do us evil
[1:25:48] of the Jew first and of also the Gentile
[1:25:50] but glory honor and peace to every man
[1:25:54] that worketh good now notice what you
[1:25:59] will get in this life
[1:26:01] if you do good works
[1:26:04] oh my glory honor and peace to every man
[1:26:10] that work us good to the Jew first also
[1:26:13] to the Gentiles and what will you get if
[1:26:15] you don't tribulation and anguish
[1:26:18] second Corinthians 9 8 and God is able
[1:26:22] to make all Grace I love this word it is
[1:26:25] absolutely astounding to make all Grace
[1:26:29] So God's grace
[1:26:31] is like an ocean
[1:26:34] at full time
[1:26:36] so what's how Paul ties this together so
[1:26:39] God is able to make all grace abound
[1:26:42] towards you now the word abound is like
[1:26:46] a plant or that'll put out a flower and
[1:26:49] it's right at the budding stage and then
[1:26:53] the abounding of that means it opens a
[1:26:56] little farther and a little farther and
[1:26:58] a little farther and it keeps on opening
[1:27:01] and opening until it reaches its
[1:27:04] pristine fullness and that's when the
[1:27:07] bloom is fully open so your power is
[1:27:10] saying that the grace of God will abound
[1:27:12] to you towards you that ye always having
[1:27:16] all
[1:27:17] sufficiency you see all Grace leads to
[1:27:22] all the other alls you'll ever need in
[1:27:25] life
[1:27:27] oh my so if you have oh Grace I don't
[1:27:30] want just Grace to just get saved by I
[1:27:34] want this right here
[1:27:36] all Grace
[1:27:38] make all grace abound towards you that
[1:27:41] you always have all sufficiency in all
[1:27:47] things so if you have all Grace you will
[1:27:51] have all sufficiency in all say I don't
[1:27:54] care what you're going through I don't
[1:27:56] care how low it is God will not leave
[1:27:59] you God will not forsake you somebody
[1:28:02] say Amen
[1:28:04] you always having all sufficiency in all
[1:28:09] things may abound to every good work
[1:28:15] all praise God so you'll have
[1:28:18] sufficiency for every good work notice
[1:28:22] again Ephesians 2 10. for we are his
[1:28:25] workmanship
[1:28:27] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:28:33] so we are God's workmanship his building
[1:28:36] and we are actually created which is
[1:28:40] schizo to make habitable to completely
[1:28:44] change or transform so where is
[1:28:47] workmanship created in Christ Jesus and
[1:28:51] this is what you created for not to just
[1:28:53] come to church not to be a pretty good
[1:28:55] Christian but we're created unto good
[1:28:58] works praise the Lord which God has
[1:29:02] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:29:06] them and the Saints said first Timothy 2
[1:29:10] 9 and like manner also that the women
[1:29:13] shall Adorn themselves and modest
[1:29:15] apparel with shame facingness and
[1:29:18] sobriety not with boarded hair or gold
[1:29:22] or pearls or costly array but which
[1:29:25] become us women professing godliness
[1:29:28] with good works so now here we come
[1:29:31] again to Sisters of what they can do now
[1:29:35] Paul does not go through there and so
[1:29:37] they'll cook somebody a pie make
[1:29:38] somebody a pound of cornbread do this or
[1:29:40] that but they should be able to find by
[1:29:43] their vocation that what God would want
[1:29:46] them to do so good works is not limited
[1:29:48] just to preachers it's not just limited
[1:29:51] to the deacons and the other ministers
[1:29:53] but God wants every member of his body
[1:29:56] to be up and about the father's business
[1:29:59] doing something to further Advance the
[1:30:02] kingdom of God which are the people of
[1:30:05] God now you remember whenever the
[1:30:07] prophecy came forth in Clifton's
[1:30:09] Cafeteria in 1961 and Danny Henry had
[1:30:13] come up and he could put his arms around
[1:30:15] brother Branham and he started speaking
[1:30:17] in French well he said he did not know
[1:30:19] French of course a couple of people
[1:30:21] stood up Anisha and then a third one
[1:30:23] stood up and they wrote down what was
[1:30:26] said and it was French so it was turned
[1:30:29] around and interpreted womans to
[1:30:31] interpret the U.N and did you remember
[1:30:33] the story and the prophecy that came
[1:30:35] forth was you had chose the harder past
[1:30:38] the harder way and it was my way and
[1:30:42] because of this a huge portion of Heaven
[1:30:48] awaits they
[1:30:50] a huge portion
[1:30:52] now and I would come into the the side
[1:30:55] of rewards everyone in Heaven will not
[1:30:59] get the same reward
[1:31:01] not according to the Bible
[1:31:04] as a matter of fact Jesus said some
[1:31:06] would lose their reward
[1:31:08] some would have a great reward but not
[1:31:11] everybody
[1:31:13] what will determine that works
[1:31:16] Works what you do for God what God calls
[1:31:20] you to do and your desire to be able to
[1:31:23] help others that's why the Bible also
[1:31:26] tells us in the New Testament but that
[1:31:27] we're supposed to do good and treat
[1:31:30] people good especially them of the
[1:31:33] household of faith because there's
[1:31:36] something about being good to God's
[1:31:38] people now how many if you were here in
[1:31:40] the days of the Lord Jesus you would
[1:31:42] have loved about Jesus a pair of shoes
[1:31:45] if you to walk by Jesus on the way to
[1:31:48] Damascus or Jericho and the Lord Jesus
[1:31:51] was barefooted if you had to put it on a
[1:31:54] credit card if you would have had to sow
[1:31:56] something another to buy Jesus a pair of
[1:31:59] shoes how many of us would have done it
[1:32:00] why nearly every one of us would happen
[1:32:02] well why did Jesus needed a change of
[1:32:04] garment if Jesus needed a meal if Jesus
[1:32:08] needed some bread and he was hungry
[1:32:09] would we do the same thing of course we
[1:32:12] would well now we have the opportunity
[1:32:15] to do the same thing for his body no I'm
[1:32:19] not fixing to lift an offer but we
[1:32:22] should feel the same way that we would
[1:32:25] be able to do something to a member of
[1:32:28] his body
[1:32:29] praise the Lord
[1:32:31] and you realize the Lord Jesus the way
[1:32:34] he looks at it he would rather you do it
[1:32:37] for his body than you would for him
[1:32:40] notice this Paul goes on to say in first
[1:32:43] Timothy 5 9 about a widow
[1:32:46] let not a widow be taken into the number
[1:32:50] under three score years old now here
[1:32:53] this is whenever the church is starting
[1:32:55] to do a little bit of a spiritual
[1:32:58] welfare type of the thing to wear that
[1:33:00] the widows that were did not have social
[1:33:03] security and things the way we do today
[1:33:05] so whenever their husbands would die uh
[1:33:07] many of them did not have any way of
[1:33:09] provision their dollar was already gone
[1:33:11] they had no way of making a living but
[1:33:13] they even at that had restrictions and
[1:33:16] requirements that must be met so a woman
[1:33:19] could not be taken under the care of the
[1:33:21] church the local body unless of course
[1:33:23] she was at this age three school years
[1:33:25] old which was 60 and having been the
[1:33:28] wife of one man which is odd I find well
[1:33:32] reported of for good works now notice if
[1:33:37] the woman never done good works she
[1:33:40] would actually be disqualified from
[1:33:44] being taken care of by the church
[1:33:48] I'm sorry y'all didn't know this is in
[1:33:49] your Bible
[1:33:51] now you see many many people feel like
[1:33:55] that the church
[1:33:57] ought to take care of them and whatever
[1:33:58] they need and whatever they need it we
[1:34:01] have people all the time I don't even
[1:34:03] know how much money I give away whenever
[1:34:05] we were here building this church
[1:34:07] because people drop in I need ten
[1:34:09] dollars for gas I need twenty dollars
[1:34:11] for this I need five dollars for that
[1:34:13] and I need 10 for something else brother
[1:34:15] Donna they might have been Angels not
[1:34:17] with the smell of cigarette smoke on
[1:34:19] them
[1:34:20] no but the smell is marijuana smoke on
[1:34:22] them no Angels don't smoke they don't
[1:34:25] they just don't do that but yet the best
[1:34:28] way the people look at it well the
[1:34:30] church my goodness the deacons have to
[1:34:31] turn people away all the time because
[1:34:33] people have it in their mind that the
[1:34:36] church should just do this and do that
[1:34:37] in the other but if you read your Bible
[1:34:39] you realize that there was requirements
[1:34:42] and qualifications that must be met so
[1:34:45] this woman might have been a good woman
[1:34:47] she might have been the wife of one man
[1:34:48] but yet nobody could really say much
[1:34:51] about the sisters she's 60 years old and
[1:34:55] she hasn't really done a lot for anybody
[1:34:57] else and we know that we have people
[1:34:59] like that in the church that they want
[1:35:01] and they want and they want and they
[1:35:03] want from the church but when it comes
[1:35:06] for them ever giving back to help others
[1:35:08] they don't ever do it
[1:35:11] oh dear Jesus I'll be standing on the
[1:35:13] side of the road tomorrow with a sign in
[1:35:16] my hand and your brother's hiring
[1:35:19] notice well reported for good works if
[1:35:23] she are brought up children if she had
[1:35:25] large strangers if she have washed the
[1:35:29] Saints feet if she have relieved
[1:35:34] The Afflicted why in the world are we
[1:35:36] asking things like this because this
[1:35:39] woman is expecting to be serviced by the
[1:35:43] church
[1:35:44] what if she's going to be serviced by
[1:35:46] the church she's got to have a life of
[1:35:48] service that proves she's worthy of such
[1:35:50] service
[1:35:52] and the church said ouch amen oh me or
[1:35:55] something all right thank you you're
[1:35:56] still with me notice so she got the Lord
[1:35:59] strangers washed the Saints feet what's
[1:36:02] it was a sign of humility of course now
[1:36:04] this was not just in church remember
[1:36:05] foot washing basically the only time we
[1:36:07] do it's in church but this was a custom
[1:36:09] among them so when a stranger would come
[1:36:12] in this was their Hospitality even if
[1:36:14] they lived in a tent and they were more
[1:36:16] like a bed one they would still bring
[1:36:18] you in and they would wash your feet and
[1:36:20] they would give you something cool to
[1:36:22] drink and they would offer you food so
[1:36:24] you know this was a requirement for this
[1:36:27] type of a person if she had diligently
[1:36:30] followed every good work my goodness you
[1:36:34] mean this was required just to help a
[1:36:37] sister financially praise the Lord again
[1:36:41] First Timothy 6 17 charge them that are
[1:36:45] rich in this world that they be not
[1:36:49] high-minded
[1:36:50] nor trust in uncertain riches but in the
[1:36:55] Living God who give us us notice give us
[1:37:00] us richly all things to enjoy
[1:37:05] that they do good that they be rich
[1:37:10] and good works wow what a strange thing
[1:37:12] to say to Rich folks
[1:37:14] now if you're rich
[1:37:16] then the Bible tells you to be rich in
[1:37:19] Good Works
[1:37:21] and no it don't count to you
[1:37:24] it's got to be out of your house
[1:37:27] oh shoot
[1:37:30] now all you say oh my goodness brother
[1:37:32] Donnie I'm not rich oh
[1:37:35] there's not a person here tonight that's
[1:37:37] not rich but I only draw 400 a month but
[1:37:41] you're a rich person compared to the
[1:37:43] people I've seen in India and Uganda and
[1:37:46] Tanzania and Kenya and Zimbabwe and
[1:37:49] different parts of the world Robert yes
[1:37:51] every person here is a rich person
[1:37:54] compared to them but you see we compare
[1:37:56] ourselves to people that are richer than
[1:37:59] we are and we say well I I I can't do
[1:38:02] that am I going to let all so and so let
[1:38:04] them do they drive these big fancy
[1:38:06] Vehicles right and I see them pull in
[1:38:08] the church parking lot with them
[1:38:09] Vehicles my fingers tired on with
[1:38:11] bailing wire my my tires just a thing
[1:38:13] you could read the newspaper sir well I
[1:38:15] ain't got nothing glory to God that
[1:38:17] little widow woman come right up there
[1:38:19] and was going to cast her two mites into
[1:38:21] it and the Lord Jesus did not stop her
[1:38:23] because the prophet said he knew it had
[1:38:25] a greater blessing for her
[1:38:27] we can give and also many times we give
[1:38:31] out of our need not out of our abundance
[1:38:34] you see the Lord does not just look at
[1:38:38] always how much a person gives but he
[1:38:41] looks at how much they got left
[1:38:43] now a rich person might be able to give
[1:38:45] ten thousand dollars and somebody says
[1:38:48] Lord have mercy I could never do nothing
[1:38:51] like that ten thousand dollars to a rich
[1:38:53] man wouldn't be a bit more than 500 to
[1:38:55] those of you that are average type
[1:38:58] person
[1:38:59] so God wouldn't just say man what an
[1:39:01] offering but God looks and said that God
[1:39:03] had 12 million left
[1:39:07] they ain't give that much
[1:39:09] well dear Jesus I'm leaving while the
[1:39:12] getting is good
[1:39:15] look friends what do we once said about
[1:39:17] us
[1:39:19] when we stand before him
[1:39:22] from the books are open
[1:39:27] oh my
[1:39:30] God that they do good that they be rich
[1:39:32] and good works ready to distribute
[1:39:35] willing to communicate
[1:39:39] second Timothy 3 16 all scriptures given
[1:39:42] by inspiration of God and is profitable
[1:39:45] for Doctrine for reproof for correction
[1:39:47] for instruction and righteousness that
[1:39:50] the man of God now here we're talking to
[1:39:52] preachers may be perfect
[1:39:54] throughly furnished
[1:39:57] unto all
[1:39:59] good works
[1:40:01] so it's not just required
[1:40:04] that the lay people do good works it's
[1:40:07] required even more of preachers
[1:40:10] praise the Lord
[1:40:12] notice again Titus 2 7. in all things
[1:40:16] showing thyself a pattern of Good Works
[1:40:20] in Doctrine showing uncorruptness
[1:40:23] gravity sincerity verse 14 talking about
[1:40:27] Christ who gave himself for us that he
[1:40:30] might redeem us from all iniquity and
[1:40:34] purify unto himself a peculiar people

[1:41:41] into doing it
[1:41:43] you're chomping at the bits
[1:41:45] what can I do
[1:41:47] what can I do is there anything I can do
[1:41:49] for the church
[1:41:52] a lot of us ain't going to ask that

[1:44:37] helping a little insignificant nameless
[1:44:41] individual
[1:44:44] that the Lord Jesus died for
[1:44:49] I know you think I'm crazy already
[1:44:51] but I try to shower my kindness and my

[1:45:11] Wendy's the other day and ordered
[1:45:13] something to drink coming from Home
[1:45:14] Depot the woman thought she recognized
[1:45:16] my voice black lady I gotta pray front
[1:45:19] she smile said oh it's you good to see
[1:45:21] you all and she reaches over to Carol
[1:45:23] and looked at her

[1:45:27] kind to people
[1:45:29] she said you come at the right time
[1:45:31] because apparently the person in front
[1:45:32] of her and I just thought I hope it
[1:45:35] ain't somebody I go to church with
[1:45:38] they let her have it and she said you
[1:45:42] come right at the right time
[1:45:45] you'd be surprised what a smile

[1:46:06] than when you come in here tonight
[1:46:08] I do
[1:46:10] praise the Lord
[1:46:13] I figure that
[1:46:15] my guardian angels bless their hearts
[1:46:19] they have Alpha's time ever was with me
[1:46:21] because
[1:46:22] I beat and thrash I turn skin off I hit
[1:46:25] myself I do I'm just finishing up a
[1:46:28] pretty good sized project that I had to
[1:46:30] do and I told Carol I said probably when
[1:46:33] the guardian angel heard me say I was
[1:46:35] fixing to do that they said oh dear God
[1:46:37] no
[1:46:39] I told her the other day I said probably
[1:46:41] when I stand before the Lord the Lord
[1:46:43] will give them my reward
[1:46:46] I won't even get one
[1:46:48] they had such a time watching over me
[1:46:54] but not on one thing when I stand before
[1:46:56] God I'm not sending an empty-handed
[1:47:00] I'm going to do what I can not for
[1:47:02] reward's sake
[1:47:04] because I'm zealous of good works
[1:47:08] I'm zealous anybody else in here zealous
[1:47:11] you just want what Can I Do Lord what
[1:47:13] can I do what what can I do for the body
[1:47:17] you don't want I do I walked outside my

[1:47:30] back over in there I picked up a few
[1:47:32] sprigs of green grass I don't like green
[1:47:34] grass going on in them gravel
[1:47:37] nobody's seen me nobody knowed it
[1:47:40] but I knowed it
[1:47:42] I'd rather pick up piece of paper around
[1:47:44] the house of God David said to be able
[1:47:47] to just be a door bat at the house of
[1:47:50] God I'd rather do that than enjoy the
[1:47:52] pleasures of sin for a season
[1:47:54] oh my I'll tell you one thing if we
[1:47:56] could get a building High full
[1:47:59] of Word of Life people that have that
[1:48:01] attitude you're talking about changing
[1:48:03] us
[1:48:04] but brother don't want Revival uh-huh
[1:48:06] and this is on the way to it
[1:48:09] yeah I
[1:48:10] would get something that when the
[1:48:12] emotions died down and the screamings
[1:48:14] died down that this is the kind of life
[1:48:16] you live when you hit the road out here
[1:48:18] I don't want something that'll just get
[1:48:20] you all pumped up and all cranked up

[1:49:12] of how much time we've spent for us

[1:49:21] we don't think of others
[1:49:23] contemplate what we can do for others or
[1:49:26] zealous about ourself
[1:49:29] some of us will move Beyond ourselves
[1:49:30] and move over into our immediate family

[1:49:36] when you came
[1:49:38] you love those that hated you
[1:49:41] those that despised you

[1:50:34] help me
[1:50:36] Lord Jesus I don't desire a reward
[1:50:40] you know the way I've done things for
[1:50:42] decades

[1:51:26] this was something I could do to help
[1:51:27] brother Donnie what about the other
[1:51:29] ministers Lord
[1:51:31] maybe I could start sending people just
[1:51:35] cards and tell them that I love them and

[1:51:39] could just drop a note every now and
[1:51:41] then to those that are homebound

[1:51:46] to the nursing homes we could do

[2:01:43] little update on Erica before we go
[2:01:45] they just got her in a room this evening
[2:01:48] maybe about six o'clock something like
[2:01:50] that been been in the ER for the last
[2:01:53] two days waiting to get get into a room
[2:01:55] you'd not believe how many people are
[2:01:58] lined up and down the hallways of the ER
[2:02:00] just people everywhere people so sick
[2:02:02] just just breaks your heart
[2:02:05] but she has a
[2:02:07] pretty pretty acute pancreatitis
[2:02:11] also I mentioned to you that
[2:02:13] had found some lesions in her brain and
[2:02:16] the
[2:02:17] Radiologists came today Carol was there
[2:02:19] with her and they mapped her brain and
[2:02:23] they're going to give her some
[2:02:25] treatments for that
[2:02:26] they have a 80 percent success rate
[2:02:31] and even if they had two we're still
[2:02:35] believing for better
[2:02:37] amen aren't we so while she is in the
[2:02:41] hospital recover recuperating rather
[2:02:43] from the pancreatitis it might even
[2:02:45] possibly start the treatment tomorrow
[2:02:47] they said she'd probably have to have 10
[2:02:50] of those that'll be Monday through
[2:02:52] Friday and not on the weekend so if you
[2:02:56] would help us pray about that I know
[2:02:58] we've asked you so much for prayer but I
[2:03:00] know that you want to know which is why
[2:03:02] that I tell you and we're encouraged
[2:03:04] we're encouraged in the Lord
[2:03:06] amen because our god reigns amen amen
[2:03:09] until God tells us
[2:03:12] any different we're going to keep right
[2:03:14] on applying his word and get claiming
[2:03:16] his promise and believing that he is a
[2:03:19] Healer amen is that right
[2:03:21] amen that's exactly right oh yeah the
[2:03:24] devil talks to you oh yeah yeah he talks
[2:03:27] to you
[2:03:28] let me just tell you what he told me
[2:03:30] yesterday
[2:03:32] he said if you will let up on me
[2:03:36] I'll roll that up on her
[2:03:42] now can you imagine how that makes you
[2:03:44] feel
[2:03:45] so in other words
[2:03:47] he wants to blame me
[2:03:52] but I saw his hand on Sunday
[2:03:55] he don't have a one in hand
[2:03:58] he's a liar
[2:04:01] praise the Lord amen
[2:04:10] and he ain't calling the shots no way
[2:04:13] my Lord's still in charge of all this
[2:04:16] don't you appreciate the Lord God bless
[2:04:18] you
[2:04:19] I miss glad brother Louie's back with us
[2:04:22] and able to sing and
[2:04:31] [Music]
[2:04:41] did you enjoy the word of the Lord
[2:04:43] tonight
[2:04:46] need help
[2:04:49] if you don't raise both hands something
[2:04:51] wrong with every one of you I needed
[2:04:53] help tonight don't you the Lord Jesus
[2:04:57] uses for your glory brother Mike Walsh
[2:04:59] slipped in just a while ago and didn't
[2:05:01] even know it until somebody told me
[2:05:03] brother Mike would you come here just
[2:05:05] one second buddy
[2:05:07] brother Mike where's he at
[2:05:10] we love you buddy we sure appreciate you
[2:05:13] I want you to offer a word of prayer for
[2:05:15] us tonight that God will help us
[2:05:18] to do what our pastor just told us to do
[2:05:22] pray for us we'll pray for you
[2:05:24] God bless you little brother Mike don't
[2:05:26] we amen today
[2:05:33] when I'll tell you
[2:05:36] I woke up at
[2:05:39] around seven this morning
[2:05:42] first thing on my mind
[2:05:45] with sister Erica
[2:05:48] and the Holy Spirit dealt with my heart
[2:05:52] [Music]
[2:05:54] I always like to know that he's in
[2:05:56] control amen
[2:05:58] amen I made sure to try to
[2:06:00] slip in where I couldn't be seen too
[2:06:01] easily
[2:06:04] I don't like to make a show
[2:06:06] but when God speaks
[2:06:11] he's going to do something
[2:06:14] and I was standing Lord
[2:06:16] if you want me to say something you just
[2:06:18] you just make the way I I don't want to
[2:06:20] do anything
[2:06:22] and I figured brother Louie's just going
[2:06:24] to go ahead and close the service
[2:06:26] I didn't even know he noticed me
[2:06:29] but the whole the whole Spirit just
[2:06:31] poked in my heart and I want you to
[2:06:32] remind you
[2:06:33] that sister Erica
[2:06:36] the faith that she's had through all
[2:06:39] that she's been through
[2:06:42] that's nothing but God
[2:06:44] watching over her and I know y'all know
[2:06:46] that
[2:06:48] but in my heart the Lord wanted me to
[2:06:51] tell you
[2:06:55] we love her
[2:06:57] we pray for her every service at our
[2:07:00] church
[2:07:02] and we know that God's a Healer
[2:07:05] and he's used this trial for some reason
[2:07:08] but God the devil can't win no matter
[2:07:11] what happens the devil don't win
[2:07:13] we're winners no matter what
[2:07:17] but the Holy Spirit dealt with my heart
[2:07:20] that the whole church not just my voice
[2:07:24] but this whole church tonight should
[2:07:26] pray
[2:07:28] when brother Donnie started that message
[2:07:30] about fasting
[2:07:33] I knew where he was going with that
[2:07:35] [Music]
[2:07:37] in my heart I know you can't just do
[2:07:39] this
[2:07:40] but what you can do
[2:07:42] is pray
[2:07:44] whether you fasted or not
[2:07:47] it's by faith
[2:07:50] that we believe this
[2:07:53] and I don't believe he would open me up
