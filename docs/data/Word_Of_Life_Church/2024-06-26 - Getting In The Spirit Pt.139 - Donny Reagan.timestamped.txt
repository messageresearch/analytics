[35:52] tonight physical spiritual mental
[35:56] Financial maybe it's in your your family
[35:58] on your
[36:00] job I think the
[36:02] Lord showed us so many things whenever
[36:05] he was here and in his prophet's
[36:09] ministry as well about how God is
[36:13] concerned about little
[36:15] things most of us that never give a
[36:18] possum the time of
[36:21] day if it was out on the road a lot of
[36:24] us would try to run over it probably if
[36:26] it was in our yard eating cat food or
[36:29] dog food or something like that we try
[36:31] to run it
[36:32] off but yet God showed us he was so
[36:36] concerned one day about an OP possum
[36:39] yeah sent her to Elijah's
[36:41] house so if
[36:43] Elijah was to be able to pray for that
[36:47] op possum and if God could send an
[36:50] Elijah aosome to pray for what about
[36:54] your needs tonight are they not more
[36:56] important than aosome or a little bitty
[36:59] old fish and God gave it back its life
[37:04] so what about your troubles your
[37:06] heartbreaks your issues in your life
[37:10] let's just hold our petitions in our
[37:11] hearts as we approach
[37:14] him father it's through your own bidding
[37:18] that we come
[37:20] tonight we would not venture to do
[37:23] so if you had not gave
[37:26] us your
[37:28] scriptures and your own desires telling
[37:32] us to cast all of our cares upon
[37:36] you you knew Lord especially in this
[37:39] last day that there would be so many
[37:43] many
[37:44] cares sometimes I get
[37:46] overwhelmed just trying to remember all
[37:50] the people and all the needs that I'm
[37:54] asked to pray
[37:55] for Lord by phone call by email by text
[37:59] by WhatsApp by all the rest of the
[38:01] channels of communication that we all
[38:04] have and this one needing prayer for one
[38:06] thing someone else needing prayer for
[38:08] something else and then there's always
[38:11] those that don't ask for prayer but we
[38:14] can sense there's a little something not
[38:18] quite right with them where they are
[38:20] they're developing an attitude and
[38:23] they're kind of drawing back in church
[38:25] and they used to sit on the front row
[38:28] now they sit on the back row or they
[38:30] used to sit in the middle and they used
[38:32] to clap their hands and praise the Lord
[38:34] and now that it's set up high in the
[38:37] mine and they don't say Amen no more and
[38:40] they kind of got a look on their
[38:43] face so Lord every one of our needs
[38:45] tonight we bring them before you we
[38:49] realize that we are so
[38:51] needy I have to be honest with you
[38:54] sir I don't I don't know how you put put
[38:57] up with
[38:58] us I don't know why you'd even give us
[39:01] the time of
[39:02] day especially us Christians not just
[39:06] the lost people their pigs eating
[39:08] slop but us who have kissed Heaven's cup
[39:14] of
[39:15] blessings and sometimes we're the ones
[39:18] that have a worse attitude than just a
[39:20] poal wretched
[39:22] siner and you don't give up on us when
[39:25] we get in a wrong mindset or when we go
[39:27] to getting all kinds of things going on
[39:29] in our head that ain't even true you put
[39:32] up with us in our failures you put up
[39:34] with us in our shortcomings and you love
[39:37] us the same thank you for doing that
[39:41] Lord as we approach you tonight we're
[39:43] asking for this service and praying that
[39:45] you'd be mindful of us Lord help me that
[39:48] I can get out of the way and submit
[39:50] myself to you Lord may you help the
[39:52] people to be able to pull and we believe
[39:55] we'll be blessed together as we as we've
[39:58] joined in this place tonight in the name
[40:01] of Jesus we ask amen praise the Lord
[40:05] ain't it wonderful to be in church on
[40:07] Wednesday night I love Wednesday night
[40:09] church of course I'm kind of weird I
[40:12] like church on Monday night Tuesday
[40:14] night Wednesday night Thursday night
[40:15] Friday night Saturday night Sunday night
[40:17] I just like going to church I'm so glad
[40:19] when the Lord saved me so many many many
[40:21] many many years ago that he gave me a
[40:25] desire in my heart to go to church
[40:29] Someone told me that they had um some
[40:32] time ago I heard a minister talking
[40:34] about it as well that he went up to the
[40:36] brandham Tabernacle to visit it just to
[40:38] go there and as I heard the brothers uh
[40:42] testimony talking about it and whenever
[40:45] they took him in him and his wife and
[40:47] they opened the door and when they
[40:50] allowed them to come in and it smelled
[40:53] like an old musty vacant building
[40:59] and I
[41:01] saw from there went forth some of the
[41:04] greatest
[41:05] messages that have ever struck the
[41:09] Earth and brother Daryl's probably never
[41:11] told most of you but brother Daryl had a
[41:13] dream many many years
[41:15] ago and he saw the brandom Tabernacle
[41:18] and it was turned into a
[41:22] museum and when I heard this brother
[41:24] which this brother is not aware of I'm
[41:25] sure brother Daryl's dream but he was
[41:27] talking about going in there and he said
[41:29] it was just a
[41:32] museum and I was reminded of what I
[41:34] heard brother Bram say this Tabernacle
[41:38] will
[41:39] lose its
[41:43] strength so you can go pray there but
[41:46] you can't pray out loud you have to pray
[41:51] silently so if the Lord would carry
[41:53] another 15 20 years 30 years what what
[41:57] do you all want this to
[42:01] be a
[42:03] museum should we bring in some of my
[42:06] coats or some of brother randam suits or
[42:09] uh maybe it's Bible or something like
[42:11] that and make
[42:14] relics is that what we
[42:16] want we see no doubt the people who were
[42:19] part of the brandham
[42:21] Tabernacle if a preacher would have
[42:23] asked them that years ago they said are
[42:25] you crazy are you of your mind we'll
[42:29] never turn this into a
[42:31] museum oh but you see
[42:34] time time has a way of working on
[42:39] people you go to letting up this and
[42:41] swapping off that Letting Go your prayer
[42:44] life and letting go believing in this
[42:47] and believing in that the next thing you
[42:49] know you don't even believe in going to
[42:51] church you don't think it's even
[42:54] necessary so one of the men who took
[42:56] this G coming through the voice of God
[43:00] he told him he said you know I feel
[43:01] sorry for you people who go to
[43:03] church cuz you only go to church twice a
[43:06] week maybe two hours on Wednesday two
[43:11] hours on
[43:12] Sunday but we go to church every day
[43:16] because we've turned our
[43:17] homes into our
[43:20] churches I thought how ignorant can
[43:24] anybody be they don't even know the
[43:26] meaning
[43:28] of the New Testament word
[43:31] church for it's a place that people
[43:34] leave their
[43:35] homes and gather in one
[43:41] place so friends no matter what we think
[43:44] we know about the Lord and how think
[43:46] we're good we think we're doing let's
[43:49] never
[43:50] forget let's never
[43:52] forget the mighty have fallen all down
[43:55] Through the Ages
[43:57] right don't let that be said about us
[44:01] may our church always be a Saving
[44:04] Station a place of healing or the Melvin
[44:08] Deliverance or the presence of God can
[44:10] move God forbid that our place would be
[44:14] turned into a
[44:18] museum well was that for
[44:21] you I don't know who that was for but
[44:24] there you go
[44:27] thank you Revelation
[44:29] 5:7 now we'll H to the
[44:33] notes Revelation 5: 7 through um verses
[44:40] 10 and he came and took the book out of
[44:42] the right hand of him that sat upon the
[44:45] throne and when he had taken the book
[44:48] The Four beasts four and 20 Elders fell
[44:51] down before the lamb having every one of
[44:53] them Harps and golden vials full of
[44:55] odors which are the pray prayers of the
[44:57] Saints and they sung a new song now
[45:01] remember their so they so in relation to
[45:05] what's going on on the earth I know I've
[45:07] been saying it a lot lately but I want
[45:09] you to know that heaven is not that far
[45:13] away from where we are when the prophet
[45:16] was carried beyond the curtain of time
[45:18] in the sixth Dimension he looked back at
[45:19] his body and he wasn't 20 ft from where
[45:23] he was at so it's not like you know
[45:26] miles millions and millions of miles
[45:28] it's in another dimension that's moving
[45:31] faster than this one so whenever things
[45:35] are correlating on the earth many times
[45:37] are correlating in heaven together which
[45:40] this is what's happened here when he had
[45:42] taken the book The Four beasts and 4 and
[45:44] 20 Elders fell down before the lamb
[45:46] having every one of them Harps and
[45:48] golden vows full of odors which are the
[45:50] prayers of the Saints and they sung a
[45:53] new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take
[45:56] the book
[45:57] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[46:00] was slain and H has redeemed us now
[46:03] these people beings are evidently people
[46:07] creatures that were at one time
[46:11] lost cuz they were saying thou Hast
[46:14] redeemed us to God so this can't be
[46:17] Angels can't be cherubim can't be
[46:19] seraphim zoons cannot be any Angelic
[46:22] order but it was human beings that had
[46:25] already went beyond the curtain of time
[46:27] H has redeemed us to God by thy blood
[46:29] out of every Kindred and tongue and
[46:32] people and Nation notice how they're
[46:34] talking they're in heaven they're in a
[46:37] Heavenly realm but they're still talking
[46:41] une Earthly language notice how they
[46:45] speak about Redemption thou has redeemed
[46:48] us to God by thy blood out of every
[46:51] Kindred and tongue and people and Nation
[46:57] now here they are up in that Heavenly
[46:59] realm but they're still acknowledging
[47:02] that there would be blacks whites
[47:05] Chinese you know Aborigines all types of
[47:08] people that'll be in the work of
[47:10] redemption and these redeemed Saints are
[47:13] Reckoning that in heaven and has made us
[47:18] unto our God Kings and Priests and we
[47:22] shall reign upon the Earth may the Lord
[47:25] bless his words you may be seated now
[47:26] let run a a parallel tonight in the book
[47:29] of ruths 4: 11 I love the way that God
[47:34] foreshadows so many things in the New
[47:37] Testament by types and things that he
[47:40] reflected in the Old Testament of course
[47:41] we know the Book of Ruth is a book of
[47:44] redemption a book of redemption Ruth 4:1
[47:49] and all the people that were in the gate
[47:51] and the elders said we Are Witnesses the
[47:54] Lord make the woman that is com to thine
[47:58] house like Rachel and like Leah which
[48:02] too did build the house of Israel now
[48:07] want you notice how that the elders and
[48:10] the people their voices is coming
[48:13] together they probably don't even
[48:15] realize what they're saying but they're
[48:17] inspired by the presence of God which
[48:21] too did build the house of Israel and do
[48:24] thou worthily in
[48:27] ephata and be famous in Bethlehem now
[48:31] Ephrata is another word for bethleem and
[48:35] I quoted to you last Wednesday night I
[48:37] believe it's Micah maybe chapter 5 verse
[48:39] 2 that whenever he talked about that
[48:42] there would come a great Prince oh thou
[48:46] Bethlehem ephata Thou Art the least
[48:49] among the children of my people yet out
[48:52] of the shall come a great Prince which
[48:55] shall rule over my people so here they
[48:59] are many many hundreds of years prior to
[49:05] that thing taking place but the spirit
[49:07] of God was moving on them and they were
[49:10] speaking prophetic utters and be famous
[49:13] in Bethlehem now I mentioned to you that
[49:17] the Book of Ruth is the book of
[49:19] redemption and I found this amazing when
[49:21] you go to look at this Redemption is the
[49:24] theme of this book because 15 times the
[49:29] word Redemption is found in the 12
[49:32] verses of this text the words redeem is
[49:37] found eight times redeeming is found
[49:41] once by is found three biased is found
[49:46] once bought once purchased once so truly
[49:52] it is a book of redemption yeah the name
[49:57] of the book is not redeemed or the name
[50:01] of the book is not the book of
[50:03] redemption but the name of the book is a
[50:07] gentile bride so the very name of the
[50:11] book shows us the opom of redemption
[50:14] that God is foreshadowing a great thing
[50:17] that he's going to do in Redemption now
[50:20] notice in verse 12 as they go on with
[50:23] this utterance and let thy house be like
[50:26] the house
[50:27] of Fes whom Tamar bear unto Judah of the
[50:33] seed which the Lord shall give thee of
[50:37] this young woman now remember as we
[50:40] looked at it last Wednesday night that
[50:42] Judah
[50:44] unwittingly actually gave Tamar a seed
[50:48] which would become the heir of the
[50:51] kingly tribe of Judah now David knew of
[50:56] course he's going to come later after
[50:59] this but he knew that God was going to
[51:02] bring the king out of the house of Judah
[51:06] but they didn't know which family in
[51:10] particular now remember there were 12
[51:12] tribes but then there were particular
[51:15] families that was going to be born out
[51:17] of the tribes now let me give you
[51:18] another example of that which would be
[51:20] the tribe of Levi but there were many
[51:24] families in the tribe of Levi and they
[51:27] didn't know which one is going to be
[51:30] this order or that order but God had to
[51:33] particularly pick a certain family which
[51:36] would come down through abinadab of
[51:38] course then come right on down through
[51:40] Moses come down through Aaron so even
[51:43] though they were of the right tribe
[51:45] there had to be a particular family so
[51:48] Judah is going to have many families
[51:52] that will come out of him but only God
[51:55] can pick the particular family which
[51:58] will be the kingly domain so Judah
[52:03] unwillingly gave unto Tamar the leverate
[52:08] obligation which would fulfill the
[52:10] leverate law that was that he should
[52:14] have give her her the the youngest son
[52:17] but he refused to do it so God had
[52:20] allowed this to work out now remember
[52:23] God never had her to do evil God never
[52:26] had her to do wrong but God took even in
[52:31] their mistakes and in their error and
[52:34] the wrong approach Grace
[52:38] overshadowed their error and God did
[52:41] something marvelous out of it so let me
[52:44] just give you a little bit of a warning
[52:47] tonight there there tends to be this
[52:50] thing that you know wants to move Among
[52:52] Us sometimes especially those that have
[52:55] maybe never committed to
[52:57] those that have never had a child out of
[53:00] wedlock or those that have never done
[53:01] some horrific sins and then you know it
[53:05] it it can kind of be a thing a stigma
[53:07] for not careful that we will tend to
[53:09] look down our noses at those who do such
[53:12] and we think well they certainly cannot
[53:14] be elected well I'll tell you right now
[53:16] you are excluding several women of the
[53:20] lineal inheritance of the Lord Jesus
[53:25] himself so what we need to do is be
[53:28] really careful and let God pick the ones
[53:31] he wants and thank God for his
[53:34] grace because whether or not you've
[53:37] committed adultery physically I dare say
[53:39] there's not many people here tonight
[53:41] that haven't committed it in your mind
[53:43] by using your eyes preach brother Donnie
[53:47] I doubt there's a person sitting in this
[53:49] building tonight that hasn't fallen
[53:51] short of the glory of God this very week
[53:55] Amen brother Donnie preach we're with
[53:57] you that's right so you realize it's
[54:00] going to be the grace of God that's
[54:02] going to get us all there in the first
[54:04] place so this child that's actually
[54:07] going to be produced from Judah himself
[54:11] will step into the leverate law of the
[54:14] firstborn because the others now of
[54:16] course have died so Judah is going to be
[54:20] the one that will be the king of tribes
[54:22] so go so far God has blessed that his
[54:26] family would be one of the five families
[54:29] notice five Grace so here FZ will be one
[54:34] of the five families of Judah but out of
[54:38] him will come the kingly line now we
[54:41] would look at it naturally and think
[54:44] that the one that put his hand out of
[54:47] his mother's womb and they tied the
[54:49] carded cord around him we would think he
[54:51] would be the one because he had the
[54:54] scared cord and scared was the sign of
[54:56] redemption but that wasn't the way God
[54:59] went in this particular case but what
[55:02] God did was he bypassed the one that put
[55:05] out his hand first and he pulled it back
[55:07] in and his brother which broke the
[55:10] breach which went beyond his brother
[55:14] which tuck his hand out so it was in the
[55:17] breaking of the breach that God types
[55:21] his own Humanity coming to the earth now
[55:25] we would look at it natur and say well
[55:27] it's got to be zero there ain't no way
[55:28] in the world God is going to use FIS but
[55:31] you see God is foreshadowing even the
[55:33] elect that will come many many Millennia
[55:37] after that do you understand that that
[55:39] Tamar carrying this and giving birth to
[55:41] these two sons it was a very reflection
[55:44] of me it was a reflection of you I
[55:48] should have come forth that original one
[55:51] from the mind of God I should have come
[55:53] forth that very seed of God but instead
[55:56] of me coming forth which one the one who
[55:59] broke the breach which is Donnie Reagan
[56:03] the human being not Donnie Reagan the
[56:05] seed of God I should have been the one
[56:08] Eve actually should have been my mother
[56:12] not Betty Jane Reagan Betty Jane Reagan
[56:16] should have never been my mother it
[56:18] should have been Eve that should have
[56:20] been all of our mothers and my father
[56:23] should have never been Don Reagan my
[56:25] father should have been Adam that Adam
[56:28] would have took the book of life and he
[56:31] would read those names pronounce those
[56:33] names and spoke us into existence and we
[56:37] would have come to her one by one by one
[56:40] by one but instead of going that way
[56:43] then we broke the natural path so we
[56:46] bypass the theophany and then we come to
[56:49] the order of Fes and God said all right
[56:52] because of that me knowing that I will
[56:55] come come the same way so instead of me
[56:59] coming on the earth now God the spirit
[57:02] God could have made him another second
[57:06] Adam the exact same way he made the
[57:08] first one so the Lord God could have
[57:10] went in the in the Garden of Gethsemane
[57:13] he could have went over on Mount hermod
[57:16] he could have went in you know the down
[57:17] the valley of Jehoshaphat he could have
[57:19] went wherever he wanted he could have
[57:21] stooped down as it were and created
[57:24] another human being that never come
[57:26] forth from a virgin and he could have
[57:28] breathed into him the Breath of Life
[57:30] just like it did the first Adam and he
[57:32] could say now you are the second Adam
[57:34] you are the Son of God you will die for
[57:37] my people but he wanted to come through
[57:40] the same way the phz come which was how
[57:44] breaking the womb so the Lord God chose
[57:47] the same path for his own Humanity now
[57:50] want you notice that phz in actually
[57:53] being the son of Judah by Tamar which
[57:57] was a questionable Affair in the first
[58:00] place but remember Tamar is not doing
[58:03] this because of lust she is not doing
[58:07] this because she wants to be with a man
[58:10] but there is something inside of her
[58:13] that is calling for a son from Judah
[58:18] himself from Judah himself not from
[58:22] Sheila not from a not from the other
[58:25] that was something down inside of her
[58:28] remember her womb had not been broken
[58:31] from her first husband or the second but
[58:34] it was from the kingly line that it
[58:38] brought forth and it was something
[58:40] inside of her that she was longing for
[58:42] she didn't even have a scripture to back
[58:44] it up but there was something there
[58:46] drawing her to fulfill it she just
[58:49] couldn't let it go how many understands
[58:51] that feeling tonight you just can't let
[58:53] it go now what you notice then in verse
[58:55] 13
[58:56] so Boaz took Ruth and she was his wife
[59:01] and when he went in unto her the lord
[59:04] gave her conception and she be a son I
[59:09] want you to notice the hypocrisy of our
[59:11] government not only our government but
[59:14] many of the governments of the world
[59:17] that if you any of you tonight was a a
[59:20] small child and you put your child in
[59:24] the wrong type of car SE or if a
[59:27] policeman goes by and sees that your
[59:30] child is underage and your child is not
[59:33] even in a car seat and they stop you
[59:36] they pull you over they can write you a
[59:39] ticket depending on the attitude of the
[59:40] cck Ain no tell Wonder World they do to
[59:42] you yet yet a woman can take the life of
[59:49] that child before it's
[59:51] born and it's her
[59:54] rights I heard the other day of a man
[59:57] that they found him guilty several years
[59:59] ago Scott Peterson was his name and the
[1:00:01] man has been trying to get his trial
[1:00:03] redone you know it's been many many
[1:00:05] years but he killed his wife and she was
[1:00:08] pregnant with her child well when they
[1:00:11] found this man guilty they found him
[1:00:14] guilty on two accounts of
[1:00:16] murder and yet this baby had not been
[1:00:20] born and I'm trying to wrap my hillbilly
[1:00:24] mind around this okay so we're going to
[1:00:28] charge this man with murder because he
[1:00:32] kills this unborn child in the mother
[1:00:36] and yet women do it every day and they
[1:00:39] say it's their rights whatever I want to
[1:00:43] do with my body don't tell me what to do
[1:00:48] with my body keep your hands off of my
[1:00:51] body come on Happy Valley or Word of
[1:00:54] Life excuse me but you realize now with
[1:00:57] the law of the land how hypocritical
[1:01:00] that it is that a baby has more rights
[1:01:04] in a car seat than it does in his
[1:01:07] mother's room it has been said it is one
[1:01:11] of the most deadly places for a child to
[1:01:16] be in its mother's
[1:01:20] womb what a
[1:01:22] shame oh my but aren't you glad that God
[1:01:26] has women on the earth and down through
[1:01:30] time that felt it their charge it was so
[1:01:34] something within these women that they
[1:01:36] wanted to do it I'll tell you one thing
[1:01:38] I'm certainly glad that my mama never
[1:01:41] had no abortion whenever she found out
[1:01:43] she's pregnant with me I'm glad my mama
[1:01:47] didn't have no abortion when she found
[1:01:49] out that she was pregnant with my
[1:01:51] brother and my other brother and my
[1:01:54] sisters I'm so glad that your mama
[1:01:57] didn't have an abortion with you and you
[1:01:59] and you and you are you all glad are you
[1:02:02] glad your mama didn't do such a thing
[1:02:05] aren't we glad that Abraham Lincoln's
[1:02:07] Mama didn't have an abortion with him
[1:02:09] come on somebody what about brother
[1:02:12] Brandon's Mama aren't you glad she
[1:02:13] didn't have no abortion on and on and on
[1:02:17] we could go don't you see how that God
[1:02:20] is the one who gives conception and God
[1:02:24] is the one that gives what the Bible
[1:02:27] calls children as a Heritage from the
[1:02:30] Lord don't we appreciate our mothers
[1:02:33] don't we appreciate women thank God go
[1:02:35] ahead give them a hand that's all
[1:02:39] right now you find I find this amazing
[1:02:41] because Boaz was now an old man
[1:02:44] according to history between 80 and 80
[1:02:46] and 90 years old something like that and
[1:02:48] Rose here at the state to where she's at
[1:02:51] whenever we look at him going into her
[1:02:54] she had married her husband over in the
[1:02:56] land of Moab he was a young man she was
[1:02:59] a young woman and yet there was no Union
[1:03:01] between them that produced a child so
[1:03:05] Boaz goes in unto her and the lord gave
[1:03:09] her conception so it was a singular Act
[1:03:12] of God's divine blessing so she bear a
[1:03:15] son and the women said unto Naomi
[1:03:19] blessed be the Lord which hath not left
[1:03:23] thee this day
[1:03:26] without a
[1:03:27] Kinsman now here the women are talking
[1:03:31] to Naomi and they say that God has given
[1:03:36] Naomi a
[1:03:38] Kinsman and they aren't talking about
[1:03:42] Boaz but they calling
[1:03:46] oit
[1:03:48] oit was
[1:03:50] Naomi's Kinsman also and her Redeemer
[1:03:57] he is going to be a
[1:04:00] restorer of her youth now keep in mind
[1:04:04] the 144,000 in the Millennium now all
[1:04:08] this time a lot of the focus has been on
[1:04:11] Ruth the more about us but watch after
[1:04:15] Ruth and Boaz come together and that
[1:04:19] Union Oh Glory that Union she begins to
[1:04:23] bring forth now the focus again changes
[1:04:27] alone from Ruth back on Naomi now Naomi
[1:04:32] is being blessed Naomi is being showered
[1:04:36] the blessings of God but look at one of
[1:04:38] the reasons why because Naomi focused
[1:04:42] everything she did not on herself she
[1:04:47] focused it on who
[1:04:49] Ruth her Focus was RSE and RSE is going
[1:04:55] to be the very one that God is going to
[1:04:58] use to pull Naomi back in to the Blessed
[1:05:02] state of God's approval again now what's
[1:05:05] so unselfish see don't ever think
[1:05:08] friends that living for others is not
[1:05:11] rewarding I'm here to tell you tonight
[1:05:13] it is eternal life when you're living
[1:05:16] for others oh I get so sick of dealing
[1:05:18] with people that's so self-centered it's
[1:05:21] all about them you know it's people in
[1:05:22] church the same way they don't like the
[1:05:24] heat they don't like this they don't
[1:05:26] like the air they don't like the music
[1:05:28] they don't like the color of the carpet
[1:05:30] why in the world did y'all use one color
[1:05:32] of carpet there and another one up here
[1:05:35] calls I wanted it
[1:05:37] thus that's why when you donate as much
[1:05:41] as I did then I'll let you make the
[1:05:43] votes okay and when you become pastor
[1:05:47] and you start your own church then you
[1:05:49] can do whatever you want to but until
[1:05:52] you do you're coming to mine and you
[1:05:56] ain't the boss
[1:05:58] here well Glory who in the world was
[1:06:02] that
[1:06:03] for my my so you see God had Naomi this
[1:06:08] is like a burden that she could not find
[1:06:12] rest herself somehow until she found
[1:06:15] rest for Ruth so she's instilling in
[1:06:18] Ruth Al light the rights and the laws of
[1:06:20] the lever law and the rights of
[1:06:22] redemption and trying to educate her and
[1:06:24] bring her to that spot to where Ruth
[1:06:26] don't know what to do she tells Ruth to
[1:06:28] go up to the threshing floor she tells
[1:06:30] her how to dress she tells her to get
[1:06:32] off her garments of widowhood and put on
[1:06:34] the garments fit for a bride and she's
[1:06:37] instructing her all of her whole focus
[1:06:40] is about
[1:06:42] Ru now God said because your attitude
[1:06:45] has been that way now I'm going to
[1:06:47] redeem
[1:06:49] you and the woman said unto Naomi
[1:06:53] blessed be the Lord Lord which hath not
[1:06:57] left thee this day without a Kinsman
[1:07:03] that his name may be famous in Israel
[1:07:07] now watch notice again Naomi moves to
[1:07:11] the cner of the theme so they witnessed
[1:07:15] now remember they were some of the same
[1:07:17] women no doubt that saw Naomi come to to
[1:07:20] the water and there was a well there of
[1:07:22] course in Bethlehem as they would build
[1:07:24] their cities around either Springs or
[1:07:26] Hidden Springs or they would dig a well
[1:07:28] there and the people at all of them
[1:07:29] didn't have water wells in their home so
[1:07:31] they would come to the city they live
[1:07:33] outside in the areas we've been there
[1:07:35] and seen how they still do that and they
[1:07:37] would come and bring their buckets so
[1:07:39] they would see her as she come in and
[1:07:41] they saw the weariness on her face and
[1:07:44] they ask her how is everybody how's El
[1:07:46] melik how's it always dead what about
[1:07:49] meon he's dead oh my they saw how
[1:07:52] distraught she was and how sad and they
[1:07:54] thought oh I I wish there was something
[1:07:57] we could do for the 144,000 I I mean the
[1:08:00] me I wish there's something that we
[1:08:02] could do for them poor old Jews you know
[1:08:04] they killed them they burned them they
[1:08:06] done everything in the world to them I
[1:08:08] wish there was something we could do but
[1:08:10] the Lord saying don't worry I'll take
[1:08:13] care of them I'll get them back the
[1:08:16] light is fixing to change again
[1:08:20] Ruth when we come to our fullness our
[1:08:24] Union with Christ Jesus will lead into
[1:08:29] the Millennium and produce the son of
[1:08:35] David and when the son of David sits on
[1:08:38] his throne the Millennium Temple will be
[1:08:42] built in Ezekiel 44 the tribes will set
[1:08:47] outside and they will have their entry
[1:08:50] points and all the worship and all this
[1:08:52] that they will do why brother Donnie why
[1:08:54] do we need in the Millennium Naomi has
[1:08:58] got to be
[1:08:59] appeased you see in the Eighth Day in
[1:09:03] the city John said I saw no Temple but
[1:09:07] he didn't say that in the Millennium now
[1:09:09] I know that the Third Temple is going to
[1:09:11] be rebuilt under the administration of
[1:09:14] the Antichrist and Satan will incarnate
[1:09:16] himself Jews Gentiles alike will go
[1:09:19] there to worship and they'll think it's
[1:09:21] God but we as Believers are not waiting
[1:09:24] for that Third Temple we're waiting for
[1:09:27] the Millennium
[1:09:28] Temple now they saw her as she entered
[1:09:31] in the city with such sadness and the
[1:09:34] burden and once they found out that Ruth
[1:09:36] was a mbius they knew oh why did Naomi
[1:09:39] do this why didn't she leave that
[1:09:41] Gentile back there poor saying it's
[1:09:43] going to bring so much of a burden on
[1:09:45] her because there was such a strain
[1:09:47] between them the moabites were
[1:09:49] constantly running over the border of
[1:09:51] Israel and they were raiding them and
[1:09:53] they would steal their cattle and steal
[1:09:55] livestock as so says Josephus and some
[1:09:57] of the other historians and they would
[1:09:59] go in their Conant so there was this
[1:10:01] constant Rift between them and here
[1:10:03] comes Naomi back and she's already
[1:10:05] burdened and heavy laden and she brings
[1:10:08] with her a gentile a gentile oh my what
[1:10:12] in the world was she thinking what did
[1:10:14] she have in her mind well it probably
[1:10:16] was beyond her because God wanted her
[1:10:19] back into the Homeland you see us
[1:10:22] Gentiles also have a Homeland and the
[1:10:25] prophet of God identified what it was
[1:10:27] our homeland is the message of the hour
[1:10:30] the word of God that's been restored
[1:10:32] back to the bride that's why we are not
[1:10:35] giving up our homeland they can fight
[1:10:38] they can do what they want to call us
[1:10:40] all kinds of names whatever we will
[1:10:42] stand and fight cuz we have been
[1:10:44] restored to our
[1:10:47] homeland now notice in verse 15 and he
[1:10:51] shall be unto
[1:10:53] thee a
[1:10:56] restorer of
[1:10:58] life and a
[1:11:01] nourisher of thine old
[1:11:04] age
[1:11:06] grandchildren actually have this
[1:11:10] ability brother Fred Mullen says they
[1:11:12] don't call him grand for
[1:11:15] nothing brother Homer Longoria says it's
[1:11:18] wonderful to see them head lights coming
[1:11:20] and them tail lights
[1:11:23] going you can love on them and send them
[1:11:25] home to their parents of course SPO them
[1:11:28] up oh my and he notice now what they're
[1:11:32] saying that OED OED in this line of
[1:11:37] David will be a
[1:11:40] restorer of her life what's he going to
[1:11:43] do he's going to make her feel young
[1:11:47] again you ever notice people when they
[1:11:50] get around a baby how most all of them
[1:11:53] go to talking baby talk
[1:11:57] D D D D and the little baby said m
[1:12:02] m oh yeah and you I wonder what them
[1:12:07] babies are thinking what are you all
[1:12:08] doing to my chin what this is weird why
[1:12:11] are you all doing that to me there's
[1:12:14] wonder why that is Wonder Why when we
[1:12:17] get around children and we watch them
[1:12:19] and oh they'll bring a smile to the
[1:12:21] grumpiest of people they're just
[1:12:23] something about it oh I seen Harry as he
[1:12:26] saw how smitten I was with our first set
[1:12:29] of twins as Courtney and they were
[1:12:32] smitten too I've seen how he watched Us
[1:12:35] and how we were smitten with both sets
[1:12:37] of the Parker twins but now Harry is
[1:12:40] nothing but a soft Doty oh grandpa Karen
[1:12:45] don't you laugh you're a soft o doie
[1:12:47] Grandma so you know what there's
[1:12:49] something about it ask Jude when he gets
[1:12:52] to the place if he can talk is there
[1:12:55] anything that he wants that Mom and Pops
[1:12:58] and Lala and Daddy and Grandpa and uncle
[1:13:01] Donnie and everybody else want get for
[1:13:03] him because there's something about it
[1:13:06] oh my you realize what it will do when
[1:13:09] the son of David comes back in the
[1:13:12] Millennium and sets up the Kingdom on
[1:13:15] the earth and Israel as a nation as
[1:13:19] Gentiles we won't be separated by
[1:13:21] nationality that won't be an American
[1:13:24] section and a and a German section and
[1:13:26] an Italian section we will all just live
[1:13:29] all mingled together like we do now but
[1:13:32] in the Millennium Israel will be a
[1:13:35] nation under the administration of the
[1:13:38] son of David Naomi will come back to her
[1:13:42] use
[1:13:44] again praise God he shall be unto thee a
[1:13:49] restorer of thy life and a
[1:13:52] nourisher of thine old age for thy
[1:13:56] daughter-in-law which loveth
[1:13:58] thee which is better to
[1:14:02] thee
[1:14:04] ah seven
[1:14:08] sons this is not Seven Brides for Seven
[1:14:11] Brothers but his seven bride ages for
[1:14:15] one son of man Son of God Son of
[1:14:20] David now what these women said to us it
[1:14:23] doesn't mean that much to them for them
[1:14:27] to compare one
[1:14:30] woman to Seven Sons Sons meant seed seed
[1:14:35] meant hirs hirs meant potential priest
[1:14:40] potential priests potential
[1:14:42] Kings but yet these women saw something
[1:14:47] in this Gentile
[1:14:49] moritis that was greater than seven sons
[1:14:55] praise be to God Amen which hath borne
[1:15:02] him so OED was a restorer of Naomi's
[1:15:08] life her youth bringing her back to a
[1:15:13] place imagine whenever she'd come to the
[1:15:16] well and she'd have them all wrapped up
[1:15:19] some of you that seen pictures of of the
[1:15:20] way they do in Africa and India and
[1:15:22] different parts of the world how they
[1:15:24] wrap them babies on the front here of
[1:15:25] the back boy they go out there and pick
[1:15:27] cotton or beans or whatever it is
[1:15:28] they're doing and then babies just slung
[1:15:30] around everywhere out there then Mama's
[1:15:32] out there working they'll bend over you
[1:15:34] know they just keep it going you imagine
[1:15:36] whenever Naomi come I mean she was proud
[1:15:39] as I don't know what she walked in there
[1:15:41] said oh oh let me see him little s let
[1:15:44] me see him what's his name we called him
[1:15:49] worshipper oh bad we called him
[1:15:52] worshipper they didn't call him all dry
[1:15:55] they didn't call him oh old old pucker
[1:15:58] you know sit down with your lips all po
[1:16:00] a nobody told me how to worship God but
[1:16:03] we called him worshipper because we had
[1:16:06] an Insight that by his birth worship
[1:16:10] would be restored back in your life now
[1:16:14] remember she had a lot of sadness she
[1:16:16] had a lot of GL we all know how it is
[1:16:19] it's hard sometimes to praise God when
[1:16:21] you feel all down in the mouth isn't it
[1:16:24] it's hard to praise God when things are
[1:16:26] going against you it's hard to praise
[1:16:28] God when the Lord has took a loved one
[1:16:31] out of your life and you felt like you
[1:16:33] couldn't live without him it's still
[1:16:35] hard to say Lord I love you Lord I
[1:16:37] praise you but what happened God had
[1:16:40] sent one that's going to be a restorer
[1:16:43] and they gave him the right name
[1:16:47] worshiper you imagine all the way from
[1:16:50] her house to the well Lord God I want to
[1:16:54] thank
[1:16:56] I want to thank you for this
[1:16:58] baby I never thought I'd ever feel this
[1:17:00] way I felt like God I felt like I was at
[1:17:03] the end of my road I felt like I'd never
[1:17:05] be happy again don't you accept that if
[1:17:09] God is our let me tell you
[1:17:11] friends if you haven't experienced it
[1:17:14] yet you probably
[1:17:17] will sometimes the will of God in our
[1:17:20] lives can be so
[1:17:23] painful amen it can exact such a
[1:17:27] price from our lives because this
[1:17:31] pleases him to do thus and so and we're
[1:17:35] looking we're trying to understand it
[1:17:37] we're trying to figure it out you
[1:17:39] imagine the loss of losing her husband
[1:17:42] the loss of losing two sons going back
[1:17:45] finding her property all run down no
[1:17:48] money no social security no way to get
[1:17:50] along no way to do
[1:17:52] anything yes and she said go God has
[1:17:55] made me bitter boy she had an attitude

[1:18:24] might have said but I have got a reason
[1:18:26] to live I've got a promise with a name
[1:18:30] I've got a promise with a name her
[1:18:34] unselfishness is
[1:18:38] rewarded oh praise God and hereby
[1:18:42] thinking more of Roose than herself God
[1:18:46] brings her from the sidelines and puts
[1:18:49] her right in the middle of the screen

[1:22:40] got time for you it's amazing to me how
[1:22:43] when people get old they get so selfish
[1:22:45] so course some of them are selfish and
[1:22:46] they young and they just carried on over
[1:22:48] in their old age but they saying well
[1:22:50] I'll tell you one thing I deserve peace
[1:22:52] and rest where in the word you get that
[1:22:53] at
[1:22:55] do you understand even though Abraham
[1:22:57] was not mentioned after the light began
[1:22:59] to focus on Isaac you know where Abraham
[1:23:01] was he wasn't in the grave he was
[1:23:03] sitting back there in the tent you know
[1:23:05] where Isaac was when the light changed
[1:23:07] to Jacob he was still
[1:23:10] alive what for what was he doing no
[1:23:13] doubt giving them some training boys
[1:23:15] this is how you pray this is how you
[1:23:17] walk with God it wasn't like that they
[1:23:19] were just sitting back there and nobody
[1:23:21] ever knew they was there but it was in
[1:23:23] them silent years of life the Bible
[1:23:25] don't even mention their names until
[1:23:27] they die the next time that it's
[1:23:29] mentioned what was going on entering
[1:23:31] into this phase of their life don't live
[1:23:33] it
[1:23:35] [Music]
[1:23:38] selfishly and Naomi took the
[1:23:42] child and laid it in her
[1:23:46] Blossom and became
[1:23:52] nurse this is a form Al
[1:23:55] Act of
[1:24:02] adoption so she
[1:24:04] adopts
[1:24:07] worship as her
[1:24:12] child it's a lot better than
[1:24:16] grouchiness it's a lot better than
[1:24:19] complaining you ever find God blessing
[1:24:21] anybody for complaining constantly you
[1:24:24] ever find God mentioning anything
[1:24:26] reputable in the Bible about people
[1:24:28] that's all the time growling and
[1:24:29] complaining and grappling about this and
[1:24:31] other you ever find any blessings where
[1:24:32] Jesus said blessed are the gers for they
[1:24:35] that grath shall grap us even more and I
[1:24:38] will give them more years to grap us
[1:24:40] about so that they can grip us through
[1:24:42] eternity and they will live on gpus
[1:24:44] Avenue because their Crown is a gpus
[1:24:47] crown there's no blessings for griping
[1:24:51] there's no blessings for being contous
[1:24:55] oh the joy of the Lord is our strength
[1:24:59] not
[1:25:01] griping you imagine it didn't cross her
[1:25:04] mind God have you forgotten me God why'd
[1:25:08] you let my husband die you let both my
[1:25:11] boys die God why you let my place go to
[1:25:15] nothing I ain't got nothing to be happy
[1:25:17] about but somehow brother Paul she found
[1:25:20] it in her well the only thing I've got
[1:25:23] left
[1:25:24] is this
[1:25:26] Gentile wow what a thing to have
[1:25:30] left but I'm going to love her I'm going
[1:25:33] to take care of her Oh Glory to God and
[1:25:38] God said now me because you've done that
[1:25:42] I'm going to give you a reason to
[1:25:43] worship
[1:25:48] again so
[1:25:50] Naomi accepted the name now remember
[1:25:54] naom never named him Ruth never named
[1:25:57] him or Boaz never named him which is odd
[1:26:00] yes sir generally the parents the father
[1:26:04] would name them on occasion the mother
[1:26:07] but here it was the people who named
[1:26:13] him and they accepted the name oh so
[1:26:18] Naomi adopts him and remember she's too
[1:26:22] old to be able to him in the physical
[1:26:25] sense so it's not like that she's
[1:26:27] providing the milk you understand what
[1:26:29] I'm saying but she was the
[1:26:33] caregiver
[1:26:35] amen she's going to be real close right
[1:26:38] around where his thrown is and around
[1:26:41] where that Millennium Temple is amen so
[1:26:45] Naomi Naomi accepted the name let
[1:26:50] said Naomi accepted the name the empty
[1:26:55] one was now full again the sad one was
[1:27:00] now
[1:27:01] happy
[1:27:03] hallelujah
[1:27:05] hallelujah the bitter one was now
[1:27:09] blessed
[1:27:10] Naomi had a
[1:27:13] son how was that even
[1:27:16] possible
[1:27:19] Naomi had a son and Roose the Gentile br
[1:27:25] shared the birth of her
[1:27:28] Christus with
[1:27:30] [Applause]
[1:27:33] Naomi the Jews brought it to us we take
[1:27:36] it back to
[1:27:38] them how was all that work I don't know
[1:27:40] but I know God will figure it all out
[1:27:42] know exactly what to do now actually
[1:27:44] whenever it says son which is the word
[1:27:47] Ben B it also means grandson or
[1:27:51] great-grandson so in other words it
[1:27:53] means that you are a descendant from so
[1:27:56] this child became the
[1:28:00] grandfather of
[1:28:02] King
[1:28:07] David you imagine when little Naomi was
[1:28:09] packing little worshipper around and
[1:28:11] he'd go to dancing a little bit little
[1:28:14] worshipper you know she'd stand him up
[1:28:15] by the well there in Bethlehem and maybe
[1:28:17] they'd come around with the music you
[1:28:18] know go to singing them Jewish songs and
[1:28:20] little olded would get down there and
[1:28:22] dancing Oh my he was packing his
[1:28:25] grandson he was in him in seed form no
[1:28:29] wonder he loved to dance and worship God
[1:28:31] that was his Granddaddy's name worshiper
[1:28:34] I wonder what if we as Grandparents
[1:28:36] could be able to impart to our
[1:28:38] children well glory to God I wonder if
[1:28:41] we'd have more Worship in grandparents
[1:28:44] if we might have more Worship in young
[1:28:46] people if we'd have more Worship in
[1:28:48] parents if we might have more Worship in
[1:28:50] young people look young people worship
[1:28:53] is not just for oldtimers it's for every
[1:28:56] son and daughter of God every young man
[1:28:59] every young woman every old man every
[1:29:02] old woman ought to worship
[1:29:05] [Applause]
[1:29:12] God and the women her
[1:29:17] neighbors gave it a
[1:29:19] name now to me this within itself is a
[1:29:22] miracle that they could all agree on one
[1:29:26] name think of it you mean tell some want
[1:29:29] Ben some of them want Fred some of them
[1:29:31] want Malachi some want Elijah some say
[1:29:33] Elijah ain't a good name go Elisha
[1:29:34] others say jeroboam others say zephani
[1:29:37] other say hay but all of a sudden the
[1:29:39] spirit of God came down on them and they
[1:29:41] all begin to say worshiper worshiper
[1:29:45] that's what he needs to be called OED
[1:29:47] worshipper why he's the very epitome of
[1:29:50] his grandmother he's the very epitome of
[1:29:53] his mother mother don't you think that
[1:29:55] Ruth was a worshipper after all that God
[1:29:58] did for that woman I imagine she was one
[1:30:00] of the shoust Gentile women in the Old
[1:30:02] Testament she could shout and praise God
[1:30:05] because God had mercy on her and God let
[1:30:08] her H upon the field of Boaz and God let
[1:30:10] her marry boad and not only that but
[1:30:13] she's in the very natural lineage of the
[1:30:16] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:18] him one of these days you'll look down
[1:30:20] the streets of gold and there come this
[1:30:21] beautiful young woman she'll be running
[1:30:23] n miles an hour shouting and praising
[1:30:26] God said who in the world was that they
[1:30:28] said Ruth some more about us said she
[1:30:30] ain't calm down since the Lord got a
[1:30:32] hold of her back in the Old Testament
[1:30:33] that woman runs down through these
[1:30:35] streets shouting and praising God I
[1:30:37] guess I'll take off right behind her
[1:30:38] Carol honey I'll grab you by the hand
[1:30:40] and here we'll go glory to God glory to
[1:30:42] God Ruth I preached on you I preached on
[1:30:45] you over and over and over again God
[1:30:47] bless you Ruth God bless you I'm still
[1:30:49] trying to catch up with her she's still
[1:30:50] going oh glory to God glory to God I was
[1:30:53] so about us I was
[1:31:03] lost and of course I guess some of you
[1:31:05] will be doing the same thing then that
[1:31:06] you do
[1:31:13] now I see somebody sometimes you just
[1:31:15] sit there and shake your head you just
[1:31:18] that I thought I thought when he got so
[1:31:21] old he would finally slow down who lied
[1:31:24] to
[1:31:27] you if I get old y'all have to push me
[1:31:29] out in the wheelchair I'll be one the
[1:31:31] flying his preachers in a wheelchair you
[1:31:33] ever seen in your life I'll be going
[1:31:34] back and forth across this platform and
[1:31:35] this pull pit Hallelujah brother Greg
[1:31:39] Park sent me a little video clip not
[1:31:40] long ago of a of a black preacher how
[1:31:42] old was he brother Greg 100 101
[1:31:44] something like that man that old God was
[1:31:46] up there just a preaching in a jumping
[1:31:48] and a shouting he said this is you at
[1:31:50] 101 I said glory to God Amen that's me
[1:31:53] I've got something to praise him for
[1:31:55] I've got something to worship him
[1:32:04] for and the women her
[1:32:07] neighbors gave it a
[1:32:09] name my neighbors give me one too but
[1:32:12] they worship
[1:32:15] her
[1:32:17] saying there is a
[1:32:20] son
[1:32:22] born to
[1:32:28] me it was a
[1:32:34] miracle but brother Donnie I mean
[1:32:37] genetically I
[1:32:38] mean DNA and I well you see the
[1:32:42] difference between her and us is she
[1:32:44] didn't understand
[1:32:46] DNA she wasn't worried about SS all she
[1:32:49] knew was she was miserable and now she
[1:32:51] was happy all she knew was she was so
[1:32:54] sad and felt like her days was gone but
[1:32:56] now God had restored her joy and she be
[1:32:58] to see more about the will of God so
[1:33:00] what if Mayon would have lived what if
[1:33:02] elik would have lived and they would
[1:33:04] have come back from the land of MOA and
[1:33:06] and Ruth would have been married to that
[1:33:08] other man you know what God knew exactly
[1:33:10] the whole story I don't know how I got
[1:33:12] to be honest I don't know how but I
[1:33:15] believe that b Sheba was ordained to be
[1:33:17] David's wife from the foundation of the
[1:33:18] world and maybe your RI would have got
[1:33:21] killed in the exact same battle that he
[1:33:24] died in and David got a held of the plan
[1:33:26] of God and run ahead of it and messed up
[1:33:28] the program of his own life but God
[1:33:31] cannot be outdone and he will take
[1:33:34] things that look sometime horrible and
[1:33:36] he'll make it fit in his will and his
[1:33:46] glory I told Carol the other day I got a
[1:33:49] certain text from just dealing with a
[1:33:51] certain situation here in the church I
[1:33:54] told Carol I ready turn said you
[1:33:56] know I said Satan loves to put me in
[1:33:59] these
[1:34:00] spots where it seems like there's no way
[1:34:03] out yeah that no matter what decision I
[1:34:07] make and what I
[1:34:09] do there is no
[1:34:12] answer so I'm killed either
[1:34:15] way there ain't no El she kind of paded
[1:34:19] me on the shoulder I said but you know
[1:34:20] what also is awesome because I have seen
[1:34:23] Our God come in those situations time
[1:34:26] and time and time again and when it
[1:34:29] looked like there was no way out he said
[1:34:30] step out of the way Donny I'm good at
[1:34:32] making way out of places when there
[1:34:34] ain't no way out come on Saints you know
[1:34:36] what I'm talking about you've seen the
[1:34:38] same thing in your life what does God do
[1:34:41] he drops you an old bed in your arm and
[1:34:43] then you can say praise the Lord I
[1:34:45] didn't know how in the world I was going
[1:34:47] to get out of this and God moov some of
[1:34:49] you sisters here tonight you want a baby
[1:34:51] you want a baby and you not been able to
[1:34:53] receive in the name of Jesus receive
[1:34:56] your promise you're needing healing oh
[1:34:59] my goodness I read today where the
[1:35:00] prophet of God said that the men of God
[1:35:03] in this last day will stop cancer they
[1:35:06] will stop diseases I believe that's the
[1:35:09] hour we're living in what God will drop
[1:35:12] an O bed into our arms
[1:35:15] [Applause]
[1:35:28] let me get my breath I'm
[1:35:30] good there is a son born to
[1:35:35] Naomi and they called his name
[1:35:39] H he is the
[1:35:41] father of
[1:35:44] Jesse the
[1:35:46] father of David
[1:35:54] so out of worship comes Jesse I don't
[1:35:58] know if Jesse was a shouting man or not
[1:36:00] but I know as it come on down they
[1:36:02] produced
[1:36:05] One OED would not only bring a blessing
[1:36:09] to Naomi to Ruth to
[1:36:12] boas he would bless the entire city of
[1:36:18] Bethlehem he would bring Fame to the
[1:36:22] tribe
[1:36:24] to the
[1:36:25] city and it seemed like El's
[1:36:30] name would disappear out the
[1:36:34] genealogies but since Judah had come
[1:36:37] down with Tamar and it comes right on
[1:36:39] down now as the seed passes right on
[1:36:41] down to where Boaz takes
[1:36:44] Ru Hallelujah under the leverate
[1:36:47] marage you understand who he was who
[1:36:50] Obed was he's reckon down
[1:36:54] identified as
[1:36:56] El's
[1:36:59] seed so he's
[1:37:01] identified as the
[1:37:04] firstborn Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[1:37:08] don't you understand every one of you is
[1:37:09] got the Holy Ghost tonight you're
[1:37:11] standing right there as if though you
[1:37:13] was with the original 120 on the day of
[1:37:16] Pentecost you've got the same Holy Ghost
[1:37:18] they got you've got the same Birthright
[1:37:26] my Lord
[1:37:30] Jesus here it
[1:37:33] comes
[1:37:34] open
[1:37:36] Jesse
[1:37:38] David
[1:37:44] Jesus whether he had a slang in his hand
[1:37:47] or a song book or a Psalm
[1:37:52] book David was is a servant of
[1:37:56] God now remember according to the book
[1:37:58] of Deuteronomy a
[1:38:01] moit could not come into the
[1:38:03] congregation of the Lord for 10
[1:38:05] Generations I wonder what some of us
[1:38:07] legalists would have done we would have
[1:38:09] stood right there in the Old Testament
[1:38:11] said it's an
[1:38:12] abomination in the eyes of
[1:38:16] God is anybody
[1:38:19] counted how many generations it was up
[1:38:21] to David
[1:38:28] they were not to enter into the
[1:38:29] congregation of the Lord but the little
[1:38:32] book of Ruth closes with a 10
[1:38:38] generation genology
[1:38:41] and
[1:38:42] climaxes with the
[1:38:45] name
[1:38:50] David is the r or defined
[1:38:53] Deuteronomy no but he's showing when the
[1:38:57] law is against you don't ever
[1:39:00] underestimate
[1:39:05] Grace glory to
[1:39:09] God Ruth 4:18 now these are the
[1:39:12] generations of
[1:39:14] phz phz beget hron hazon begat ram ram

[1:39:39] David so the 10th
[1:39:43] Generation by the book of
[1:39:45] Deuteronomy David was left
[1:39:51] out right amen good
[1:39:55] Grace said come on in
[1:39:58] David and ain't no wonder that man
[1:40:00] shouted and ain't no one of that man
[1:40:02] Shang sang and worship God it ain't no
[1:40:04] one of that man praise the Lord like
[1:40:05] none
[1:40:08] other one of the writers said it this
[1:40:11] way I thought this is so beautiful I
[1:40:12] just wanted to share it with you we have
[1:40:14] a delightful ending to the book of Ruth
[1:40:16] which contrast greatly with its
[1:40:20] beginning it began with remorse but it
[1:40:23] ends with
[1:40:25] rejoicing it began with death but it
[1:40:28] ends with life it began with dishonor
[1:40:32] for God but it ends with honor for God
[1:40:36] it began as a cloudy stormy day
[1:40:40] threatening to Devour the people
[1:40:42] involved in the book but it ends with
[1:40:45] the sun shining brightly we like books
[1:40:49] that end this way don't you like the end
[1:40:52] of that book and all lived happily every
[1:40:54] after we know in reality life ain't that
[1:40:57] way but let me tell you something
[1:40:59] tonight you are part of a book little
[1:41:02] Roose that you can read your end of your
[1:41:06] story and I'm telling you tonight you
[1:41:09] are going to live happily ever after you
[1:41:12] will never die there will be no more
[1:41:15] pain no more sickness no more heartache
[1:41:24] but we need to note that the good
[1:41:27] conclusion of the Book of
[1:41:29] Ruth was to do with the Good Conduct of
[1:41:32] some of the people in The Book of
[1:41:37] Ruth Matthew 1:1 and I'll close the book
[1:41:39] of the generation of Jesus Christ the
[1:41:42] son of
[1:41:43] David the son of
[1:41:47] Abraham you mean to tell me the Lord
[1:41:50] Jesus was not ashamed
[1:41:55] for his next of kin in the Book of
[1:41:57] Matthew now if you understand the
[1:41:58] genealogies you know many times they
[1:42:01] would not list each generation but they
[1:42:03] would skip some which is exactly what
[1:42:05] Matthew did it was just his style of
[1:42:07] writing so it didn't go down through all
[1:42:10] of them but he said the book of the
[1:42:11] generation of Jesus Christ so here's
[1:42:14] Jesus Christ and he jumped to the son of
[1:42:17] David and the son of
[1:42:19] Abraham Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac
[1:42:22] begat Jacob and Jacob they got Judas and
[1:42:24] his Brethren want you to notice who's
[1:42:27] named first and the only one named in
[1:42:30] the chronology of Matthew
[1:42:34] Judah Judas Greek for Judah Hebrew the
[1:42:37] Old Testament why kingly
[1:42:41] tribe children don't you understand this
[1:42:44] is what separates the bride from the
[1:42:48] church the bride
[1:42:50] comes from the King tribe
[1:42:57] Lord
[1:42:59] God it's not our goodness it's not any
[1:43:02] good thing that we've done he chose us
[1:43:05] to be part of the king
[1:43:09] tribe glory to
[1:43:12] God and Judas beg ferah and Zarah of
[1:43:18] famar and farz begat Isam and Isam begat
[1:43:22] AMR and amram begat ababab and ababab
[1:43:26] begat Nan and Nan begat salon and Salon
[1:43:30] begat booze Boaz of RA and Boaz began
[1:43:35] open of
[1:43:39] Ru Lord
[1:43:42] God should I say
[1:43:50] it the end of the book
[1:43:54] will declare it
[1:43:56] thus I'm the Lord
[1:44:00] Jesus big act to
[1:44:02] Millennium of his
[1:44:06] wife the Gent
[1:44:13] briad I read it last night where brother
[1:44:15] R said before Jesus can come there's got
[1:44:19] to be a Ministry on the earth that will
[1:44:22] be so like the Ministry of the Lord
[1:44:24] Jesus that it will cause the
[1:44:27] resurrection of the
[1:44:31] Dead it ain't no wonder the devil hates
[1:44:33] a Ministry in this
[1:44:35] message you ever thought about it he
[1:44:37] hates a Ministry in this message worse
[1:44:39] than any message it's been since the
[1:44:40] church ages have been going on there's
[1:44:42] only one one body that ever thought the
[1:44:44] ministry is hard that's why the lot of
[1:44:46] the message people do you who that is
[1:44:49] Catholics Catholics
[1:44:53] let Satan fight the Lord Jesus will
[1:44:57] produce a Ministry on the earth that'll
[1:45:00] be some much like him don't you
[1:45:02] understand what it is it's the
[1:45:05] continuation of his
[1:45:07] ministry every God called man no matter
[1:45:09] where he preaches fast slow medium speed
[1:45:12] every God called man that's called by
[1:45:14] God is carrying on the ministry of the
[1:45:19] Lord Jesus
[1:45:21] himself don't you understand this is why
[1:45:24] the administration of the son of man the
[1:45:26] son of man is still
[1:45:39] here and someon beet Boaz of raob and
[1:45:43] Raab and Boaz be opit of
[1:45:49] Roose but do you understand that Rahab
[1:45:52] lived
[1:45:54] between 250 and 300 years before this in
[1:45:59] the Book of
[1:46:02] Ruth you didn't know that you need to
[1:46:05] spend more time in your Bible and said
[1:46:06] on
[1:46:08] Facebook you mean Rahab lived 250 to 300
[1:46:13] years and yet it identifies
[1:46:17] her as boaz's
[1:46:21] mother well Bo I got some of y'all's
[1:46:23] attention this a first time tonight but
[1:46:25] glory to God I done her didn't
[1:46:28] [Laughter]
[1:46:30] I but you see in the way they would
[1:46:33] write the genealogy it doesn't mean that
[1:46:35] it was his direct mother but a
[1:46:39] descendant boy when I found this I
[1:46:41] thought now I get
[1:46:44] it now I get it I heard brother Brandon
[1:46:47] preaching the other day 90 mil an hour
[1:46:50] on the Mighty God unveil before us in
[1:46:52] philadelph
[1:46:53] Pennsylvania and he was preaching about
[1:46:55] Benjamin Franklin preaching about you
[1:46:58] know all these great men in America and
[1:47:00] they said I was there with Paul River I
[1:47:03] was there with George Washington I I I I
[1:47:05] waved that icy River there then he went
[1:47:08] back and said I was with Abraham when he
[1:47:10] went up on top of that mountain and I
[1:47:12] thought that's it that's it not that I
[1:47:15] was there literally but by
[1:47:17] identification it's in my genealogy I
[1:47:20] was there with David when he reached
[1:47:22] down and up them five smooth stones out
[1:47:25] of that rock glory to God when I stood
[1:47:27] over there five or six years ago in that
[1:47:30] same dry bed and I reach down there and
[1:47:32] F my pockets full of them rocks I used
[1:47:35] one the other night over at brother Josh
[1:47:36] benach you ought have seen them people's
[1:47:38] eyes when I drug that out of my pocket
[1:47:40] and I said this Little Rock right here
[1:47:43] come from the same branch of water oh my
[1:47:45] iot packing that rock of land you never
[1:47:47] know when you run into a giant that
[1:47:49] might need to be slain I realize why I
[1:47:52] identify with David I realized I wasn't
[1:47:55] there when them Seven Seals was open
[1:47:58] when the angels of the Lord made his wig
[1:48:00] but by seed by genealogy I was there
[1:48:06] Hallelujah I was not there physically
[1:48:09] when he raised from the dead but by
[1:48:12] representation I was
[1:48:14] there you were there
[1:48:26] [Applause]
[1:48:40] there was
[1:48:45] sinfulness and four out of
[1:48:48] five of the women
[1:48:52] that Matthew
[1:48:54] mentions
[1:48:56] Gentiles
[1:48:58] Tamar
[1:49:00] Rahab
[1:49:05] Canaanites
[1:49:07] Ruth
[1:49:09] moabitas Beth
[1:49:11] Sheba a
[1:49:15] Canaanite all blocks and
[1:49:20] marks on the lineage
[1:49:24] how many of you would want to tell
[1:49:25] that's where you come from naturally any
[1:49:28] of y'all want to tell there's a
[1:49:29] prostitute in your
[1:49:34] line yeah y'all want to tell this a
[1:49:36] harlot back up one or
[1:49:40] two but can you imagine Matthew as he's
[1:49:44] sitting there writing Lord should I say
[1:49:46] it should I not should I hide it from
[1:49:49] him you imagine Jesus said don't hide it
[1:49:53] I'm going to save some just like
[1:49:59] it glory to
[1:50:06] God oh
[1:50:09] God
[1:50:13] Roose
[1:50:16] Tamar whatever your name
[1:50:21] is this Jo Jo the
[1:50:23] ranks of the
[1:50:30] redeemed let us find our
[1:50:33] position we don't hear it preach much in
[1:50:35] our message I
[1:50:37] know but in the Book of Joel there's a
[1:50:39] great prophecy that speaks about this
[1:50:42] brow in the last days and Joel
[1:50:45] identifies her as an
[1:50:47] army and Jo all says there's one
[1:50:49] identification that she'll have she will
[1:50:52] not
[1:50:53] break
[1:50:55] ranks in other words if God called her
[1:50:58] to be a sergeant or a tater Peter or a
[1:51:02] tater
[1:51:03] washer she don't have to be in charge
[1:51:06] and let everybody acknowledge her same
[1:51:08] with men so if God called a man to be an
[1:51:11] associate to another man he will not
[1:51:15] break
[1:51:16] ranks in order to do his own thing which
[1:51:19] is very hard to do it's very hard to do
[1:51:22] cuz some men get to thinking I I'm
[1:51:23] greater than this I I'm bigger than this
[1:51:25] I've got more gifts but in this Army
[1:51:29] there'll be no breaking of rank and if
[1:51:30] they do break they will come back and
[1:51:34] find their
[1:51:36] position cuz we're going to present to
[1:51:38] our lord
[1:51:39] Jesus the host on the
[1:51:43] earth yeah the prophet was out there
[1:51:47] what was it
[1:51:51] 1961 him and some of the brothers is
[1:51:53] looking up at the
[1:51:55] sky at night and he said they tell me he
[1:51:58] said I've Len I've never been able to
[1:51:59] find it but they say there's all kinds
[1:52:01] of different things up
[1:52:03] there he said later we went to bed that
[1:52:06] night I got to lay in there I got to
[1:52:08] thinking about all that order in that
[1:52:11] heavenly host and I got to thinking
[1:52:13] about the
[1:52:14] disarray in the Earthly
[1:52:18] Host this one getting out of their spot
[1:52:20] and that one out of their spot and that
[1:52:22] one
[1:52:23] don't you want to just get in your spot
[1:52:25] and stay there just be whatever God's
[1:52:27] called you to be brother brother the Don
[1:52:29] I've got so many more gifts but remember
[1:52:31] if God knows you've got more gifts he
[1:52:33] will place
[1:52:35] you I wish preachers could understand
[1:52:38] this I wish preachers could to
[1:52:41] understand you don't make doors for
[1:52:45] yourself I've dealt with so many through
[1:52:47] the years and you try to advise them and
[1:52:50] try to help them
[1:52:53] and it's like oh I've got to go oh man I
[1:52:56] want to you know and you know what a lot
[1:52:57] of them do they will call other
[1:52:59] preachers to preach for them I I'm
[1:53:02] passing through I want to preach for you
[1:53:05] that's one of the worst things a
[1:53:06] preacher can do to
[1:53:10] me I think God deals on both
[1:53:14] ends I'd rather have three doors that
[1:53:17] God opened up for me then 30 I opened up
[1:53:21] for myself
[1:53:23] amen sir I'll be able to accomplish more
[1:53:27] with them three doors that God gave me
[1:53:29] but I'm telling you friends I know you
[1:53:30] don't deal with a Ministry that much
[1:53:32] person many of you don't me brother darl
[1:53:34] talk about it all the time it's it's
[1:53:35] just pitiful some of the young preachers
[1:53:37] in this message they're wanting to be
[1:53:40] seen so bad and heard so bad and they're
[1:53:43] willing to ride on the coat tail of that
[1:53:44] preacher that preacher that preacher
[1:53:46] that preacher show up at this meeting
[1:53:47] and that meeting and that meeting and
[1:53:49] and let everybody know they're a
[1:53:50] preacher cuz they're looking for a door
[1:53:52] and you think what good is it going to
[1:53:54] accomplish come on now God has to give
[1:53:57] men their
[1:53:59] favor come on somebody don't sit there
[1:54:01] and look at me and be
[1:54:02] quiet if God gives you three songs to
[1:54:05] sing sing them with all your heart
[1:54:09] brother my if you clap your hands and
[1:54:11] every now and then you miss a beat well
[1:54:13] clap them sing with all your heart sing
[1:54:16] with all your might do I well I wish I
[1:54:18] could sing like brother Harry well I do
[1:54:20] too but I can't
[1:54:24] I was never jealous of Harry in any way
[1:54:26] except one
[1:54:28] way he was Erica's favorite singer and I
[1:54:30] never did like
[1:54:38] that I got to say I don't blame
[1:54:41] her but what we want set me Lord set me
[1:54:47] in my
[1:54:49] rank and if we all in this church
[1:54:51] will'll find our
[1:54:53] place and be
[1:54:56] there but I'll give you a good little
[1:54:58] clue okay you watch people that's always
[1:55:01] want to do this that and the other watch
[1:55:03] and see how they treat the leaders above
[1:55:06] them that'll tell you if they're called
[1:55:08] of God to lead or not cuz a real leader
[1:55:11] can be led but a stubborn hard-headed
[1:55:16] goat that will not take advice from the
[1:55:18] pastor counsel from the Deacon always
[1:55:21] bucking against I don't care what you
[1:55:23] decide they're always against it that
[1:55:25] shows you right there they're not a
[1:55:27] godall leader on they are a

[1:56:51] expectation and me loves him with all
[1:56:53] your
[1:56:54] heart God bless you Saints I thought
[1:56:57] about not having church tonight I
[1:56:59] thought well you know what we're going
[1:57:00] to have church Friday night and Saturday
[1:57:02] night and Sunday morning but then I
[1:57:04] thought man why in the world would we
[1:57:06] want not want to have Wednesday night
[1:57:07] let's just go and have another know W
[1:57:09] Out Boy am I glad we did praise the
[1:57:17] Lord I know you've been praying about
[1:57:19] our meetings and I want you to continue
[1:57:21] to do so and the Lord puts it on your
[1:57:23] heart you know these next few days
[1:57:24] before the meeting start please let's
[1:57:26] just keep them in prayer praying for the
[1:57:28] ministering brothers that God will lead
[1:57:30] them I I mentioned this here brother
[1:57:32] Daryl and I have been praying about a
[1:57:33] prayer line whether or not to have it um
[1:57:36] and he's he text me the other day and
[1:57:38] said he felt felt like it wouldd be a
[1:57:40] good thing for us so Lord willing will
[1:57:41] be having that on on uh Saturday night
[1:57:43] we'll start the service at 6 o'clock on
[1:57:45] Saturday so we can be able to
[1:57:47] accommodate the people and all so let's
[1:57:50] just come expecting the Lord to move hey
[1:57:52] you know he drunks liers horners thieves
[1:57:55] invite
[1:57:57] them invite them you understand friends
[1:58:01] where we are since we've been here in
[1:58:02] our church we have had the office bunch
[1:58:04] of visitors ever was I was told Sunday
[1:58:06] we had the office bunch of visitors it
[1:58:08] was unbelievable how many visitors would
[1:58:09] hear now you know what a lot of
[1:58:11] preachers do when they see that they
[1:58:13] start
[1:58:15] compromising they go to cutting back on
[1:58:17] what they say on Sunday morning and
[1:58:19] they'll say that for Wednesday night
[1:58:23] and they quit preaching to the mature
[1:58:25] bride hopefully to get more well the way
[1:58:28] I look at it if they're a seed they may
[1:58:30] be dressed up like a jezebel but this
[1:58:33] may be the very thing they're looking
[1:58:34] for so if I water it down and and you
[1:58:38] know just make it where I sound like
[1:58:39] everybody else they say well just
[1:58:41] another church but if they hear stuff
[1:58:43] from Plum across the horizontal rainbow
[1:58:45] and they're thinking Lord have mercy
[1:58:47] what in the world was they talking about
[1:58:49] and they leave just bum Fogle they don't
[1:58:51] think what to even say but then they
[1:58:53] think wow Lord I think I'm going back I
[1:58:55] think why it may be exactly the very
[1:58:58] thing they're looking for don't expect
[1:59:00] me to compromise because we're having
[1:59:02] visitors to show up be nice to them you
[1:59:05] may have to cover your eyes on some of
[1:59:08] them but they might be the last
[1:59:11] one what if it's a last one and she
[1:59:14] looks like a
[1:59:16] jezebel oh
[1:59:18] my let's expect God to do great things

[2:12:07] like this one that we had
[2:12:09] tonight probably never the same people
[2:12:13] gathered in quite the same
[2:12:16] way before long it'll be
[2:12:19] history the B the pages will be closed
[2:12:22] upon this service the way we did what we
[2:12:25] thought our participation level whether
[2:12:29] we just looked whether we acted whether
[2:12:32] we clapped our hands or didn't clap our
[2:12:34] hands Lord God I trust
[2:12:37] father that what I said the way I said
[2:12:40] it was pleasing to you you're the one I
[2:12:44] Look to as a violinist that
[2:12:48] stood on the platform and played so many
[2:12:51] years ago as the prophet tells us the
[2:12:53] story and he played so beautifully tears
[2:12:57] are brought to the eyes of p and cheers
[2:13:00] to others and they clapped and they
[2:13:02] applauded and again and again and he
[2:13:06] just stood there but he was looking for
[2:13:10] his
[2:13:11] teacher cuz he wanted his
[2:13:14] approval so he scans the audience until
[2:13:17] he can find the Mastro that taught him
[2:13:21] Lord God I I love to hear that the
[2:13:23] people were blessed and they were helped
[2:13:26] but after each service I
[2:13:28] preach I want to know that the master
[2:13:31] himself could say Donnie I was
[2:13:36] pleased I pray that each of us father
[2:13:39] would get that understanding in our
[2:13:41] heart every service we attend every
[2:13:43] singer every
[2:13:45] musician that they'll place that
[2:13:48] first then when they leave that service
[2:13:51] that you can say to them I was so
[2:13:54] pleased by the way you participated in
[2:13:57] church tonight I was so pleased the way
[2:14:00] you amened the word I was so pleased
[2:14:03] that you clapped your
[2:14:05] hands I pray Lord God I'll never leave a
[2:14:09] service whether I'm preaching or
[2:14:11] not that you'll ever say to me I was so
[2:14:15] displeased with you
[2:14:17] Donnie you just did not have a good
[2:14:20] attitude
[2:14:21] you didn't get in you didn't
[2:14:25] worship Lord I pray if I've
[2:14:28] ever in my years of serving you if
[2:14:32] there's one of them just
[2:14:34] one on my
[2:14:36] record I pray the blood of Jesus would
[2:14:39] blot that out
[2:14:41] tonight I never want you to ever have to
[2:14:44] record that I never gave my
[2:14:48] all oh Grant it Lord as we come back on
