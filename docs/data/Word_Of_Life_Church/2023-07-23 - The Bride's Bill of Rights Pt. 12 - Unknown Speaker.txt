stand I start to fall and on those lonely roads that I have traveled on there was Jesus when the life I built Came Crashing to the ground when the friends I had were nowhere to be found I couldn't see it then but I can see it now there was Jesus [Music] in The Waiting [Music] buried in the broken pieces every man and every moment where I've been or where I'm going even when I didn't know it I couldn't see it there was Jesus [Music] for this man who needs amazing kind of Grace for forgiveness at a price I couldn't pay perfect so I thank God every day there was Jesus [Music] in the waiting in the searching in the healing and the hurting like a blessing buried in the broken pieces every minute every moment where I've been or where I'm going even when I didn't know it I couldn't see it there was Jesus on the mountains in The Valleys in the shadows of the alleys in the fire in the flood [Music] always is and always [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] like a blessing buried in the broken pieces every minute every moment where I've been or where I'm going even when I didn't know it I couldn't see it and there was Jesus there was Jesus there Jesus Jesus [Music] [Applause] where would we be without him today and he's glad you know it I mean this guy who knew you before you knew him that's what really matters isn't it let's turn to the Book of Romans today if you would Romans chapter 8. verse 16. I Mendoza living in a great time I mean those are living in an awful time terrible time sickness trouble despair sadness heartache we know all that right if you'll keep up with the news just the news of all the nuclear threats and all the things that are going on I took care of this week I don't know how people out here without the hope of the Lord in their heart I don't know how they get up every day if you just watch just a few YouTube videos on the nuclear war between America and Russia you watch it for about 10 to 15 minutes it's a whole it'll take and it'll about put you on your knees when you realize what lays ahead for our nation and for the world I guess I never really thought about it before at the end of the Millennium there will be such nuclear fallout or the tribulation period rather before going into the millennium the Lord God will have to perform such an absolute miracle because once the nuclear fallout starts the atoms start dividing dividing it keeps going going then the onset of the nuclear winter comes Darkness covers the earth no sunlight can penetrate so at the end of the tribulation period the Earth is going to be hanging out here like this darkened star that what will our Lord do he'll speak his word and clear it all back and Break Forth in a millennium I'm grateful for that aren't you he done us the same way we was in a nuclear fallout with the devil when it comes to sin instead of London the Lord spoke his word Over Us Praise the Lord Romans chapter 8 verse 16. but until we get there we've got a few more trials maybe a few more tests along the way the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God join heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in US for the earnest expectation of the creature way this listen now the earnest expectation of the creature weigh this for the manifestation of the sons of God oh Lord how many lots of people remember today as we pray some of our youth gone today down to Brother David sellers service they have there this weekend certainly wants to remember them trust you've been praying for them so there's many that are sick Afflicted going with different things in their bodies and their homes so let's just pray together father we love you so much today we thank you Lord Jesus for loving us caring for us providing for us Lord everything that we have need of we're asking Lord that you would help us take your word once again father and speak to us those things which will be beneficial we've not come together just to see one another though we like that we've not come to just speak to one another but Lord we've come to hear from you and we've not only come just to receive but we've come to give Lord I want to give my very best in this service so when I stand before you that day that you'll not shame me and say you want to get half you only gave a third I want to give everything that I have to give today but I pray not just me have that attitude but everyone here the same attitude Lord and if we do then we know that you'll move you know the needs that are among us different ones sick Afflicted and we know that you're mindful of that we thank you for the healings Lord that we've been experiencing several instantly healed Sunday several instantly healed Wednesday Lord You're a mighty God moving Among Us we shall thank you speak to us today Father in Jesus name we pray God bless you Saints you may be seated I'll keep it for a minute anybody guess what size this is anybody want to guess thank you but you're so wrong 40 regular I like a lot of moving room anybody guess what size shirt I wear 17. 17 here but 15 here so I wonder why that's important maybe some of your sisters I could guess what size dress you are you better not brother die some of your brothers what size shirt you wear not the size matter well yeah on some things it does we think of size the way that we compare to one another and the way that we compare preachers in the way that we compare churches and size whether it's by gift or by knowledge or by years of experience it's a way we look at a lot of things but yet the Lord looks at it in a total different way than what we do now no doubt I would look very very odd today if I walked out of the office and I had on a say a 48 coat and I had on a waist instead of being a 34 of a 44. and I had a belt that was also a 44 and instead of wearing size 10 shoes I had on either size five or it's not brother Andrews size 13 or 14. so size is relevant according to our needs and I'm not sure that we will ever understand why we're here in time why that we go through various things and we tend to measure what we go through well how come I have to go through so much of this and this again we're comparing size the size of what the size of our burden the size of our load the size of our reproach the size of what we have to deal with so because we deal with so much size and say if you've got 14 kids and you pull up on a Volkswagen lot and you tell that guy I want one of them little bugs they say so you're not taking your wife and your kids with you say yeah we're all going to ride in this Volkswagen Beetle well he's going to think there's something a little bit wrong with you because there's no way according to the size of your family you're all going to be able to get in that little Volkswagen car so he will say more than likely sir maybe you might need an SUV or you might need a minivan I don't like them minivans I don't like the look of that suvid I probably couldn't afford one anyway they begin around 85 000 so there ain't around the world I can afford one of them but this Volkswagen but sir I'm trying to get it over to you you'll not be able to fit all of your family inside this car you said this is a family car yes this is a family car well whenever you talk to that man that way he's going to sing there's something wrong with this guy because he cannot relate size so he's looking at you looking at your stair-step children looking at your wife and thinking how am I going to be able to get it over to this man that he's going to need a larger vehicle well you know most of us would say well that's right Common Sense would tell you that ah it's amazing how much we lack common sense though sometimes when it comes to spiritual things so the Lord looks at us at the size that we are now and he looks at the size he wants us to be when we're done with our journey our spiritual walk and for a lot of us it's not that we are smaller but it's that we're too big so we've got so much attached to us that we think is spiritual that is a great attribute to have and yet the Lord looks at us and he sees that there's so much has got to be shaved off and more taken off and more taken off because there's way too much of us so how does God do that how does God take off of us what is too excessive trials test failures disappointments I know we don't like to think of it in this way but in reality we tend to pray more when money's tight and said when we have a whole lot more than what we need we tend to pray more if we sink in all that that God has somehow displeased with this or we've not felt his presence or something just doesn't seem right between us and him we tend to become more serious than if every time we go to the house of God the blessings are just being rained down on us and we can't even contain ourself and that's a lot of times when people tend to get more loose with God because we read blessings as approval but don't you think for one minute in your life blessings is the only sign of God's approval because the children of Israel were forbidden to go into the land of promise God pronounced the Judgment over on this side of the inheritance they died in the wilderness by the thousands yet they didn't have to have new shoes they didn't need new clothes they didn't have to go to the grocery store God blessed them every day of their life and they didn't have one inch of ground in the Promised Land but no doubt they were convinced because God blessed them everything was okay you see that's a typical layout of sin God blesses me I've got this and I've got that that must mean God loves me actually it doesn't come on the greatest sign of his love for any of us is his approval of us in Christ Jesus and then we also know that one of his signs of approval and that we are children is because he corrects us and spanks us real good when we get wrong and when we get into error you know God ain't like a lot of parents today a lot of parents see absolutely no fault in their children so their children can do whatever and you know it's always somebody else's fault if their kids get into a you know an issue with other church kids or whatever it's never their kids fault and some parents think that is an ideal parent that is not a realistic parent that is not a truthful parent but God is the ultimate parent and he loves his children so much that he will always correct them when they're wrong because he does love them so look at it this way then that the size of cross that God allows to each of us is God measuring us for our crown and our reward that we will get hereafter now a lot of what we go through in life is not God's fault it's not God even testing us it's us things that we've done some of what we go through is stuff we inherited from our parents grandparents Aunts Uncles has nothing to do with God but yet the things that he allows to come our way is totally different and the things that he allows to come our way is the things that He blesses us for and when we come through them now let me share some of these things with you today turn and second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 3 and I want you to notice one of the greatest men of God that ever lived on the earth at any given time Paul the Apostle now I want you to listen now I was going to go through this morning by the help of the Lord some of the things that this great man went through now I realized a lot of message folks they don't really think about Paul that much they don't think about Peter James John they pretty much think about our messenger only but let me just remind you that when brother Branham went beyond the curtain of time he referred to Paul he referred to what Paul talked why because in that place he knew Paul had a great place in heaven so it we do ourselves a great disadvantage by taking the apostolic fathers and putting them over here on the minority side and thinking they're really nobody you need to re-read your Bible as a matter of fact the foundations of the city are going to contain the names of the Apostles you show me one scripture where brother branham's name will be on that Foundation now don't get mad at me just read your Bible praise the Lord you show me where my name will be there you show me where brother Tim Pruitt brother Ron Spencer any of the great men that we know and love where their names are going to be in the foundation of the city if we're not careful we will lose sight of what God has done because we're so caught up in what he's doing and we're failing to put in priority what he did the city is already built Paul's name is done there the foundation of that great thing is already there Paul's name is there I don't think we ought to put these brothers on the sideline and say Well they're not really that important we've got Elijah in our day Elijah himself compared his own message and judged his own message by Paul I preached what Paul preached and Word of Life Church said so brother and then sat up and say I didn't need what Paul had to say I was a prophet of that day and I didn't need that no brother Branham did not believe that it's only people in error around the message that believes that now I want you to notice then this man went through more in his life than any other Gentile preacher he experienced more well to me if he did then you look at the word God was measuring that brother for a large position in heaven notice second Corinthians 6 3 giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed but in all things approving ourselves as the Ministers of God in much patience in afflictions and Necessities in distresses notice he says in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labors in watchings which means he couldn't sleep so night after night after night he had insomnia now there's somewhat he went through in stripes you know of any Gentile preacher that's been beat 39 stripes you know then he Gentile preacher in America that's been thrown in prison seven times it imprisonments Thomas and labors and watchings and fasting by pureness by knowledge by long-suffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by love unfamed by the word of Truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by Honor and dishonor by evil report and good report look at what he's going back and forth between the contrast of what this made me through and what was most of it brought on what was the cause because he stood for the Lord Jesus and he bore this cross why because he was a Jew because he was an educated man because he was a gospel preacher so all of this was brought on him because of the sake of Christ and you keep in your mind the Lord will not be beholding to any man by Honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers yet true so they were they were blasted they were ridiculed they were run down I know yeah by the way I ain't just talking about the Jews but I'm talking about some of the so-called message people of the first century you see even those that Paul led to Christ when it come right down at the end of his life even some of them turned on him when Paul stands before the judicial system for his first preliminary hearing under so-called Roman Justice no one from Ephesus no one from Rome not one Christian not one preacher not one teacher not one Apostle no one stood with him and yet Ephesus wasn't that far away and the Ephesian church was one of the deepest churches in the message there was hundreds of Believers in the Roman church but not one Christian he had not one witness that was willing to come and say I will stand for this man's credibility he's a man of great honor a man of great Integrity not one believer not one Holy Ghost Field child of God stood for Paul he actually prayed for them that God would not lay that sin to their charge do you realize what they've done when they treated Paul that way they sinned Lord God as unknown and yet well known as dying behold we live as chastened and not killed that's sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing yet possessing all things this man when he come down when he writes Timothy just a few months from his death and he writes Timothy he says make haste and come and he tells them in another place to come before winter time now the reason was because they shut down the sailing of the ships to the Aegean and the Mediterranean parts of the Mediterranean because it was so rough in the winter season it was not worth the risk to sail boats so Paul told Timothy hurry if you don't come you won't see me alive hurry please come why because every Christian in Rome forsooking so he tells Timothy when you come through troas would you bring that cloak I forgot my coat there and this man was so poor he had one cup so what would have been your view of this man where would some of you stood if you was an Ephesian Christian any of your brothers any of your sisters any of your young people any preachers been willing to show up in the judicial court of Rome and said I will stand for this man of God or would we stayed at the house and said well I I prayed about it and I I didn't feel that and yet he begot them to the Lord he prayed with them so they were filled with the Holy Ghost he led them through the darkest sins LED them back to Christ when they backslid and when he needed a friend he had this many I pray God will honor Paul's prayer and forgive all them people why would God I think sometimes you know you go through a Lawton whenever you do you get to feeling sorry for yourself you know how we are I'll go to reading about some of this stuff right here what some of these men of God went through it I think I ain't been through nothing I ain't hardly been through Nothing in life notice this is what God tells Paul about the city of Corinth Acts chapter 18 verse 10. for I am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for I have much people in this city and remember this is a wicked terrible place but God says he has a lot of people a lot of elect they're in Corinth and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of God now Paul Had A peculiar way about him well look at it Wednesday night I don't want to Sidetrack today but Paul would not go in and start a work in an area where there was already one no you don't find that that's totally contrary to the scripture Paul went hundreds and hundreds of miles away from where there was any works of God going on so here he goes to this horrible Wicked sinful City because God told him to go now once it gets there and he stays for 18 months the longest historical record that we have where he stayed in any given city of all of his trips now remember this man traveled thousands of miles by feet by Ox cart by ship a real missionary he didn't go down the road and start another word I wonder why he'd done it it was contrary to what God gave him you see so he would travel for hundreds and hundreds of miles well so I want scripture for that I've got it but I'd say I'm gonna give it to you now now whenever he goes there then and then he establishes the church and then he goes to colossi goes to Philippi he goes to thessalonica and then false prophets and apostles they start coming in from Jerusalem and from other places and they go to sowing Discord in the church and causing all kinds of problems in the church I know you might find it hard to believe but some of the Corinthian believers which are actually saved under Paul's Ministry started siding with some of these false Apostles he called them different titles but false Apostles and false evil workers and they started blasting Paul and Saint Paul was off the word and some of these people that had come from the world under Paul's Ministry and got converted and got the Holy Ghost and they actually turned against Paul and started taking sides with these false prophets not what they started claiming was of course that they were the true prophets and they were the true Apostles and you remember the judaizer has done the same thing to the church in galatia but keep in mind that Satan is not the originator of true missionaries but God is God is the one who sends forth the true missionaries and then after they go in and establish a work then Satan will send his preachers in afterwards and cause them of course Ministers of like and they will come in afterwards and then sow in Discord and so on and so on it's always been the same pattern and it always will be so if you've ever wondered why that Paul wrote this in second Corinthians 11 whenever he goes to talking about it seems like he's bragging about himself and it seems like that he's just going on and on and talking about what God did through him and how God did this and did that and basically what Paul is having to do that because the false prophets have come through into the church at Corinth and they have run him down to no end and there were real children of God sitting there and they took sides with these false prophets against their own church AIDS messenger well Mama second Corinthians chapter 11 verse 22. Now watch how he approaches this are they Hebrews they who these false Apostles false prophets false teachers so he said are they Hebrews so it lets us know they were are they Hebrews so am I are they Israelites so am I are they Seed of Abraham so am I now no doubt this is what they were telling the the people that are in Koreans which were a mixture of Gentiles and Jews mainly Gentiles and they were telling them look we are the certain certain tribe and we belong to so and so on my grandpa was in the prophet's meetings and my uncle was there in the prayer line and this and that and the other as if though that gives them some type of credentials well I'll tell you one thing I was this and that and the other one Paul said well what they are I'm that too and even more now I don't doubt someone said Lord have mercy what in the world is he bragging about it's a shame really and one sense that Paul would have to be able to incorporate this into the scripture into the Holy Bible because you had men there that were so running and down and absolutely tinging his credibility among the church he had founded isn't it amazing how people are are the Hebrews so am I or the Israelites so am I or the Seed of Abraham so am I are they Ministers of Christ I speak as a fool notice what his response was I am more and labors more abundant in Stripes above measure in prisons more frequent Clement one of the early writers of the first century who wrote at the end of the first century said that Paul is imprisoned seven times seven times so he said so they claim they're this and that and the other he said everything they are I'm more wow what a shame that a preacher has to get up and say such things or write in the passage of the New Testament and this to be read for two thousand years and people trying to figure out why in the world was Paul saying that it was because them false the prophets and false Apostles and false workers were coming in and attacking the very church that God led him to start well praise the Lord amen so he says he was in labors more often more abundant and Stripes above master in prisons more frequent and deaths often isn't it amazing that he didn't mention how many more Devils he cast out how many more sick did he heal how many more dead that he raised it's not something which is the way a lot of times that we compare preachers you know that we say well how many discernments does he have or how many miracles does he have and I'll tell you if he's a man of God or not you need to read Matthew 24 and you'll find out there'll be all kinds of miracle workers that'll have a whole lot more miracles maybe than even some of our message preachers do and they'll be lost and go to hell because you can have Miracles and it still don't mean you're a son of God well praise the Lord notice verse 24. of the Jews five times received our 40 Stripes save one so five times brother Jack he was beaten with 39 stripes so I find it so amazing that his credentials now of what he's identifying himself as being a true servant of God is that it's not healings signs wonders Miracles death to the understanding of the word he's Allowing God to separate him from the false by how God is measuring him for his crown because those false guys are not being measured for their crown because everybody loves them now they were politicians you see so they knew what to say how to say it at the right time so here Paul is identifying himself as a true man of God by what he went through and not just how many folks he prayed for instance is this your Bible or not you do believe this right am I in the right place this morning I thought I was the pastor of this church I remember laying some Miss Stone I remember staining all this stuff here I remember am I in the wrong place this morning really okay I just want to make sure because y'all y'all look at me really strange so why would a preacher want to separate himself by identity and not just sign to sign well I cast out a devil one time well that ain't nothing I've cast out five well that ain't nothing I cast out ten but Paul didn't even go that way but he went by the size of the Cross measuring him for the crown because he knew unless these guys got converted they had no Crown anyway notice he says of the Jews five times received die 40 Stripes save one Thrice was I beaten with rods Lord God once was I stoned so if I die tomorrow and you guys are looking for another pastor and a guy like this sends in his resume all this is listed on his resume would he get off the ground which I'll even consider a guy like this think about it Thrice was I beaten with rods once was I Stone Thrice I suffered shipwreck a night and a day have I been in the Deep in journeyings often in pales of waters and Perils of robbers of course it didn't take them old boys long enough to realize they'd wasted their time with this guy he didn't have nothing you know they'd probably give him money by the day to buy him some lunch when he got down the road because this man didn't have nothing he only had one coat and left it by control us and he left his scripts in another place and said would you get my books because I want to say that the message a little more I forgot him over that night I left and bring my books back and bring my coat and he'd get among Perils of robbers and which they producer Saudi Arabia in them places and still do to the day and he would go through that all right hold it up buddy hold it up he said boys I'm telling you once I ain't got nothing y'all right we've heard that before well that robbed him and said what do you do for a living and said I'm a Holiness preacher I'm a holy ghost fail preacher well come on somebody preached with me this morning well you imagine them old robber said don't bother him I don't try to hold him up before round it'll cost me fifty dollars I bought the boy a room I bought her a pair of shoes I bought him this and the other man I ain't never seen a preacher so poor and yet hear a Paul separates himself from those guys that are false prophets by what the size of his cross because God makes number state mistake in Perils of robbers and perils by my own countrymen and perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness a man of God a prophet of God went through all of this stuff perils in the wilderness pills and the Sea perils among false brethren and weariness painfulness in watching soften in hunger they ain't talking between breakfast and lunch I wonder how many days he went that he didn't have nothing to eat I thought David said I was all young and now I'm old and I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor is seed beg in prayer I thought David said Delight thyself falls on the Lord let me give you the desires of your heart why is God making the most important man on the earth at that time goes through hunger he's in the measuring room hold your arms out Paul stand normally now whenever I bought this suit on sale 79 maybe 99 something like that what we paid for it been hung in the closet for a bit Carol's just been so busy hadn't been able to cuff the trousers for me so I had to go down in their sewing room and to be able to try them on and then stand there I'll move around I'm you know kind of a moving sort of evolution stand still I'm on a poke this pen if you don't stand still she wasn't going to do it intentionally she isn't going to do it by mistake because I was moving so I had to get in her room I've got one leg shorter than the other one so she has to do them according to that but I had to be there and stand long enough and she wanted to change this and modify that so women have done any good for her to call Brother Adam without him come over and and try on Donnie's suit were not the same size it wasn't any good for her to call Harry Harry skinny is a bean Pole always has been bless his heart out if he does I get his tapeworm so it has to be me oh children if God's handed out gifts we're all standing to learn if God's handed out this and that and how they're all standing in life but how many wants to stand in line when he calls you into his tailoring room and then we say oh no oh no oh no not me not me no God no may God give us the courage when he calls us into his room and says try it on home Paul says in awareness and painfulness and watching's often in hunger and thirst and fast things often in cold what's the next one you need a prophet of God would set and shiver in the cold nights or the cold mornings and he didn't even have enough money to buy another coat you see why I'm reading these scriptures whenever I get down and kind of worry because I think I ain't never been through a whole lot in my life I don't even want to stand beside people like this put me way way back away from people like this how in the world by the way can we walk before them people that have gone through what they've gone through and we bellyache and cry over a little this and that and the other oh my goodness and fast things often in cold and nakedness besides those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches you see I was an apostle and a prophet in that first church age he was not in charge of one particular congregation but he was over the entire church of the Lord Jesus Christ water responsibility so all the churches in that first century he was at the oversight of them all notice it says in second Corinthians 10 verse 8 for though I should boast somewhat more of our Authority which the Lord has given us for edification and not for your destruction I should not be ashamed that I may not seem as if I would terrify You by letters now if you've read very many of his letters you know he could be pretty terrified for his lighters and I want you to listen to some of the things that was being said about this church AIDS messenger for his letters say they always felt sorry for them I don't know who them are but they are they and they are them we've got some of their kin still alive today I'm afraid for his letters say they are weighty and Powerful but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible damnable was out basis of Truth so you mean some of the Corinthian people were saying this about their churches messenger some of the very ones that he said you were this and you were that but now are you clean and now are you washed and they had got among some false teachers and they begin to sway them away from the truth dear Lord a Roman historian called naciferous says about Paul hey on a small and a contracted body somewhat crooked and bowed a pale face looked old I had a little head and had a sharp eye and his eyebrows hung downwards so he definitely wasn't an Elvis his nose was bent somewhat long his beard thick and pretty long and that as the hair of his head had a sprinkling of gray hairs do you imagine when he stood up there he did not come in a three-piece suit the way I am today he did not look even like some of these brothers sitting here now find handsome young men and older brothers but he would have been a pretty pitiful excuse of a Preacher kind of bent over bowled a little bit and a sprinkling of gray in his beard quite long almost bald-headed sharp looking eyes type of guy that you just got the creeps you know just the Willies just look at he sends chills all over me just look at that guy who who in the world is that first church AIDS messenger the angel of the Lord to the church at Ephesus follow paper which was another historian Roman historian scoff English says of Paul when the bald-headed Galilean met me now this Roman historian actually met him when the bald-headed Galilee and met me with his hook nose which went through the air to the third heaven that is a nose ain't it this was the type of a man that God chose would we have been okay with that type of a man second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 11. now Paul says they're saying boy his way his little words is really powerful but when he comes he's a puny looking feller but verse 11 he said let's not just wanted to think this that such as we are in Word by letters when we are absent such will we be also indeed when we are present oh my goodness for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves of ourselves with them that command themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves which is what most of us do we are the measuring tape and we measure ourselves by ourselves so we are the measuring tape and we measure ourselves that's why there's hardly any self-condemnation the age that we're living in because the self-examination is wrong the self-examination uses us well I think and I believe and this is my opinion and I don't like and I I there's your measuring tape and City you should be saying well what does the word say what does the Bible say what does the message say what do we talk why don't we talk from the scripture why do we talk but instead we have at our handy little measuring tape and I think and I believe and this is what my daddy said and my grandma said this and Aunt Matilda said this and ain't juicy Bell said this and Uncle so-and-so said that yep see there they are they're all them little numbers on your tape Uncle Fred and Uncle Joe and so and so and grandpa so and so on your little great uncle so and so that's all them little marks right there well I've always been this way and I plan to be this way the rest of my life where you'll be that way when you go to hell except it won't matter then will you you see God don't he accepts a show we can come to God a liar we can come to God a prostitute we can come to God all kinds of evil but if you ever get to God you won't say like you were when you got there you will be different but lay it a seal said Oh Come As You Are and y'all they want you to stay as you are but the Gospel of Jesus Christ changes us from what we are to what he wants us to be not what we want to be well I think we have no thought coming oh my goodness let me share this with you in 1961 it's tremendous quote mother man said God demands respect for his servants his servants you know how you know they are his servants because he vindicates his servants by his word he takes these servants and makes them Servants of God and proves that they are servants by making his word work through them servants then as you respect that servant you respect God but now it's heaven and a lot of them Corinthian Christians did not have this principle so they felt like that God maybe had used Paul and yeah I touched him and all that sort of thing but yet Paul somehow they had been affected in their thinking toward him and now they believed that somehow he was a lesser man of God or he's a lesser Prophet or the Seer to the age they didn't realize that by not showing up at Paul's trial they done it to Jesus I wonder today France or yourself I've been there well I'll tell you what you can do you can judge the way you do now and the way you treat God's servants now and it will tell you exactly what you would have done in the days of Paul because I'm his little brother Daryl is his little brother these other preachers here were his little brothers so the way you treat us in our age is the way you would have treated Paul as you lived in his age the people that have embraced the message for years and years and turn away now blessed the prophet and all this that and the other they would have done the exact same thing to Paul oh if I'd been in the days of Paul you had done him exactly the same way you did the messenger of Malachi 4. now watch brother man goes on to say so when I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other then we're respecting God that ought to help every one of us want to respect one another it don't mean we go along with one another on everything but we still respect one another as children of the Living God and the church said now kind of go on a few more minutes watch I'm going to be if you would in Galatians chapter 1 verse 6. look at some of the troubles that Paul was demon down the galatian church so here God is actually letting him go through fast things through trials through all this sort of thing and then he's got all the churches Lord have mercy I cannot imagine the only thing I'm grateful for in the days that Paul was they didn't have phones instant messaging texting emails and all that it might have took weeks and months for Paul to heard about something going on in the galatian church if it happened this morning he'd heard it by noon as soon as he got done preaching if they live in this modern day as a technology so God knows exactly where to place a man don't he but you imagine every church now that he founded this man in one of his missionary trust won over 700 miles one way show me where Paul ever established a church in Jerusalem look where Peter went James went Bartholomew John show me where Paul followed in their steps and started another church he didn't well I'm sorry y'all didn't know that's in the Bible now watch what had happened in the galatian church now remember these were Jews and they were called judaizers they were apostate judaizers so they come to the church in galatia was mainly Gentiles and they so tell them you all got to be circumcised why you all can't believe the Holy Ghost why you ain't got no Holy Ghost you're if you're going to be in the seat of Abraham you've got to become a gentile convert oh they said well we're already converted Oh no you're not you're eating sausage for breakfast you about your heathens you got a Baconator for lunch and sauces for breakfast and pork chops for supper why no other matter but you bunch of heathens y'all ain't Believers while there ain't no way in the world and a bunch of them Galatians start saying oh okay why there was legalizers among the Galatians and their nature was legalistic so they said Okay okay so what do we need to do Thou shalt not and thou shalt not and thou shalt not yes so that's what we'll do so here a poor old brother Paul bless his heart if he didn't have enough his already demon with notice how he writes to him in chapter 1 verse 6. I Marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you unto the grace of Christ unto another gospel to be honest with you friends when I read these things especially when they're accumulative like this this morning when I read all this I'm thinking my mind how was this man even able to put up with all of this how could he do it and no doubt they were spread apart they didn't happen you know one day after another one week after another he couldn't have took it by the Paul it would have just wiped him out and they were sped over a period of months and years and he would get one thing resolved and something else would come up and he'd get that church sort of straightened out and another thing would come up he says which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ chapter 3 verse 1. oh oh foolish Galatians who has Bewitched you now what was it judaizers what were they doing come outside you can't believe that Paul oh you can't believe that why have you ever really checked his stories well I'll tell woman you get time now you read in the book of Acts well they talk about that Pillar of Fire and all that stuff coming down and then see where Paul told about it himself and you'll find there's two different Tales there how can you trust a man like that that ain't got a hundred percent recall well you'd never trust one thing because ain't nobody got that well how in the world could you believe Paul was a man of God and he packs a doctor around with him Luke was a physician and Paul left trophemus one of his Faithful Servants back in one of the Cities sick and carries a doctor around with him and supposedly lays hands on the sick and they recover and left his body back there on the city sick don't sound like no man of God to me friends don't you understand what they've done to them they've done the same thing to them men of God that people are trying to do today to our Prophet until our pastors and our genuine evangelists come on Church why because Satan knows the vulnerability of humanity we're not first century we're not Greeks we're not cynthians we're not many of those but they're so much like us about exactly the same as it was within people same as it was in The Book of Numbers Chapter 14. humans are humans that's why they all got to be saved it will perish oh my all foolish Galatians how this must have broke his heart to say this who hath Bewitched you so they were Bewitched but by whom preachers now this was not a wizard this was not a witch it was somebody preaching another gospel another Jesus that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you in galatia Jesus was not crucified in galatia he was crucified in Jerusalem what Paul is saying God allowed him to preach the cross in such a real way that they were sitting at the cross he allowed Paul to step into an anointing in such a real way my goodness brother Daryl preached it for us a few years ago on an Easter Sermon I was sitting on the platform behind him I thought I was going to get up and leave it was so real to me I could see the blood going out of his body I could see his muscles twitching on the cross I could see the agony it was so that's my makeup I'm a dramatic preacher anyway and when I hear drama tears me all the pieces as I sat there and I was in pain you may think I'm nuts I felt pain running through my body and Paul said God allowed me to preach Jesus Christ to you in such a way that you walked away from there as if though you had been at the cross oh and he says this only what I learned of you receives you the Spirit by The Works of the law or the hearing of Faith are you so foolish mama having begun in the spirit now made perfect by the flesh these poor Galatians so what did they do you mean brother Donnie they had an effect on real genuine Believers yes I'm going to shock some of you Plumb down to your socks brother Charlie Cox told me years ago there was a woman preacher in Jeffersonville my brother Branham was here and it was amazing the effect that woman preacher had on some of the people from The Tabernacle right brother Paul and some of the people from the Branham Tabernacle left to follow a woman preacher I'll tell you one thing friends we better if we have ever been in our life better make sure our foundation is on Jesus Christ the word of God [Applause] can you imagine when the prophet set the church in order about gifts you know while other people done left the Branham Tabernacle went to other churches but they didn't go along with the prophet's teaching on it they thought they knew more about it than he did and if you listen to what he said he said a lot of us prophesying things that didn't even come to pass well come on don't sit there and look at me I'll bug God now if God if God anoints you or me or whoever it is to say thus saith the Lord that ain't you saying that that's God that says it well if God says Thou saith the Lord there's going to be a hurricane come through Tennessee and say there ain't never been one in their life if God said there's going to be one he'll make one come to Tennessee and if God says that there won't be no excuse well the winds changed and there was an upper draft that come down on the high Dome and the high pressure come on say it admit it you lied you missed God but God says something God Don't Lie When God Says something it will come to pass amen somebody say Amen because God don't make mistakes and the prophet said they were prophesying things that never happened saying things that never come to pass someone who said in order he said the spirit of Christ is subject to Christ's teaching so what some of them do they got mad and left the opportunity to set in the church where Elijah was the pastor mama Galatians 4 12. can I go a few more minutes Brethren I beseech you be as I am for I am as you are you have not injured me at all well you know house or infirmity of the flesh I'll preach the gospel unto you at first in my Temptation which was in my flesh you despise not nor rejected but receive me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus but notice how people can change on you where is then the blessedness that you spake of for our bear record that had been possible you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me why because they would see his eyes running brothers that they would see his his letters and he made him in big letters because he couldn't hardly see and he said you all love me so much you would have pulled your own eyes out and gave them to me they said where's the blessedness that you spoke of me but now notice what it says am I therefore become your enemy because I'll tell you the truth the zealously affects you but not well they would exclude you that you might affect them in other words they won't listen to you your side of it so that you'll change them but they want their the other way around oh my goodness what is God doing measuring now Paul what are you going to do you're going to get an attitude against these people are you going to get hateful you're God's chosen messenger now Paul anointed of the Holy Ghost you Smit a man blind because he crossed you what are you going to do Paul second Timothy chapter 4 verse 9. Paul writing to Timothy now this is after the judicial thing that I told you about a while ago do thy diligence to come shortly unto me hurry and get here in other words oh my goodness he's only got a few more months left and in the closing days of his life he wants a dear trusted friend by his side for Demas have forsaken me having loved this present world and is departed into thessalonica Christians to galatia Titus unto Dalmatia that's amazing because Demas was a preacher a message preacher will call it and Paul mentions him first in Colossians chapter 4 verse 4 when Paul's in Rome the first time Luke the Beloved verse 14 rather Luke the Beloved Physician and Demas greet you Philemon chapter 1 verse 24 Marcus aristocritus Demas Lucas my fellow laborers so Demas was a close friend and a fellow laborer with Paul but when it come right down to it it was too risky being identified with Paul so Demas returned back and I do say back because historians say he was from thessalonica from a rich family Prophet tells us that present say to my Ministry he was from a rich family and wealthy and thessalonica was the capital of the Empire during part of this time period before Constantinople so it was a great Mega Center a lot of merchandise and Mercantile was very big there and when Paul really needed a friend what did Demas do slipped out Lord God so he chose those rich for his friends over this poor guy um I found this so amazing I actually sat yesterday as I was studying this and it took my breath listen to me it took my breath physically as I sat in the chair the patron saint of the city of thessalonica was Demetrius which is the extended form of the word Demas so under Catholicism Demas became the patron saint of thessalonica he was martyred in 290 A.D or somewhere up in through there you know or that's when they set it up Rather that's when they made him the patron saint martyred sometime after Paul and 290 A.D they make the Declaration a man that betrayed God's prophet a man that turned his back on God's prophet and the church lifts him to sainthood and calls him the patron saint of our city God have mercy listen to astounding things that brother Branham says about him now I imagine Demas didn't forsake Him and start off tonight clubs I don't imagine Demons did that because Demas was a spirit filled man wow you understand you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour of your life and die lost and go to hell don't look at me funny I just quoted to your quote the baptism is your spirit how many people have we baptized up here and what do I do and the other brothers do put her hand over the mouth what for and their nose to put over like this to keep the water from going in their nose and their mouths a person can have the baptism in their Spirit every day and still not be regenerated from the soul I don't want it in my spirit alone I don't want it on my flesh I want that in my soul in my soul that'll Quicken me to every word of God and I will be willing to give my life if not I will forsake God's servants if I don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and my soul I'll not be able to stand the pressure that's coming amen demos was a Spirit-filled man he was a great helper if you ever took the history of demons he was a notable preacher a fine cultured man Holly polished educated smart man I believe bema saw a failing seemingly in Paul's Ministry I think he thought that old fellow was washed up before God demon said I ain't associating with a guy like that he's just a low class person let me tell you something Word of Life we think because of our new building and our fine carpet and this that and other and we look down at people that's poorer than us and maybe have to meet in a storefront and we're saying they ain't got what we got we won't have what we got long I'll tell you one thing I'd rather have the Holy Ghost in This big building don't you understand that's the Demon's anointing to go to looking at the real message people and looking down your nose at them somehow you're better tell me how 150 pound of Georgia dirt is better than a hundred and fifty pound of Kentucky dirt especially if it's all red clay tell me how 175 pound bag of Illinois dirt or Arizona dirt or Mississippi dirt is any better than Virginia dirt I don't know too much but I do know enough about dirt to know dirt is dirt I've seen dirt in Asia I've seen dirt in Africa I've seen dirt all over the world it's dirt everywhere I've been [Music] but this is what Dean must begin to say he's just a low class can you imagine a preacher looking at the men of God the church AIDS messenger children and send that guy he's just a low-class don't don't hang around him he says fetch ain't told you mark it down and you remember that an idiot from Kentucky told you one day it'll come to pass that the educated and the intellectual will become so dominant in and around our message they will be ashamed to quote God's prophet we're heading more that way every day I know you don't know it but we're heading more that way all the time that's why they've got to polish up the quotes they've got to change this and change that God chose a Kentuckian God chose a hillbilly for a reason God didn't choose a man from Harvard he chose a man from Mark's fall Hallelujah God did not choose an educated preacher he chose a preacher that couldn't even hardly fill out his notes we've got a glass case over in the library if you haven't seen it you need to go put your eyes on it and it shows you the handwritten notes of our Prophet you will stand there and see one word after another misspell the pronunciation in the wrong place not even using the right verb an adverb an adjective and now he might not have noticed his nouns and pronouns that he knowed almighty God he might not have been a great speaker like we think that he spoke in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ he spoke anointed by deity so demon said I'll go up for the denominational Brethren I'll go up or I'll be somebody brother Brown mentions about brother Baxter before he mentions this quote and he said by the Baxter Thomas said brother Brown you know what I'm gonna do first thing I get to heaven he said what Ern he said I'm going to walk right up to Demas and smack him right in the face he said now Aaron why are you going to that he said because I'm going to say why did you leave Paul down there why did you forsake Him for leaving that poor little guy in that shape he ought to man standing by him Paul was the one that led him to Christ Lord Jesus paragraph 91 now think of that how true servant that will stand true to the word sooner or later just remember the people are going to forsake Him and let me say not only is it preacher some of your deepest wounds and deepest hurts will be from Friends since I've dealt with Christians most of my entire life not deepest scars that I pack in my heart today are definitely inflicted by Christians many of them by preachers because I found some preachers to be Liars thieves adulterers pornography Watchers um that don't change the truth God still got some man of God that are true and faithful let me find a place to close here brother Ram said goes on to say oh my an identification the world loving demons forsaken him first Christian so-called Brethren of the popular opinion but Paul said on the word Demas left him loving this present World left him because he was true to the word it was too straight for him or he says who would you go with Demas I've often wondered how many people that left the message or left Paul because they got saved under Demas or they followed demas's influence what if Brother Davis is leaving there's got to be a reason there was he wasn't a seed of God oh my goodness God help me today Paul said all men have forsaken me notice brother Ram's words poor little God now watch he's going to tell this story about Dr Baxter and he's going to end it a little bit different than he did two years prior to this always as alarm that Dr Ern Baxter said you know when I get to heaven first thing I'm going to do I said what is it brother Ern he said I'm going to walk right up to demons and slap him in the face as hard as I can I said now earn and he said I'm going to say why did you leave Paul down there like that I said read it you really think God have mercy on the people that will walk away from Servants of God when they themselves are under such a strain and if they ever needed them and they turn and go then I'll tell you a friend it's going to be terrible one day it would be an Abomination a sin for me to turn my back on you in your time of need I find it amazing that people don't look at it the same way when their Pastor needs them or when their Prophet needed them and not one preacher not one saint showed up for Paul's sake why they were afraid what happened to all the great teachings of predestination the Ephesians Church on the deepest churches look at the book of Romans now what great things Paul was able to write to the Roman Christians and where was one of them Lord God notice brother Brennan says all right I said are you really think he'll be there Ern you better be careful your desire to slap him in the face I wouldn't want to be where he was at maybe can you imagine when he stands before God Demas and there stands Paul over looking at him and he looks at him and said why why did you leave he was in such a strain he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown and look at how you respected him I wonder what Bemis will think that Jose I tell you one thing Lord of God if it had been me look at yourself now and it'll tell you what you would have done in Paul's day so if it would have been Word of Life Church that Paul did wrote to and even like Tabernacle down in Minden and either of our churches were close to the Judiciary trial that Paul is going to have how many of our jumper shelters Runners screaming hollering preachers our deacons our trustees our laity how many of us from Word of Life would have showed up with Paul and said I'll stand with him now you know if you walk in there you may not walk out free so demon said no I'll lose my Ministry I can't do it I just can't do it ain't worth it there's something wrong with him anyway leaving trophemus back there carrying a doctor around with him all the time while the other day they ran them out of the city Alexander the copper Smith brought all that persecution against him did you hear what happened to Paul they had to let Paul down the wall in a basket during the midnight hours and he run like a chicken there's something wrong with him no they wouldn't he was just standing in the Taylor's parlor stretch out your arms Paul steady lord they're calling me names on Paul release your fist release your fear lord they're telling lies of me Lord they're really my influence in the Corinthians say Lord look what they're doing in the galatian church Paul that is my church not yours I didn't say on this rock I'll build your church but on this rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail you imagine how hard it must have been with him standing there in the Taylor's office and they're running them down and this and that and the other stand still Paul when Paul tells Timothy to come and see him he says all men forsook me Timothy didn't even know until he receives this epistle it just happened a week or so prior to this you imagine when Timothy got it he said oh dear God where was the Saints where was the you mean there's no sisters the ones he prayed through to the Holy Ghost the ones that used to be harlots the ones that used to be drunks and Liars none of them let's bury it [Applause] Hallelujah oh Lord God father I'm sure a lot of these people here today is like me they don't like standing in that room and you tell them to hold out their arms just relax and say hell right relax holding them arms I know what this means I'm fixing to be measured oh Lord I pray help us Jesus lord it's not just when things are going good that we prove Who We Are it's when things are turning against us when we're sick and we're in despair as I say Lord I've never been where Paul was and I I'm sure that I won't be because I don't think that I I'm the type of man that could take it more than likely this was a man that was so unique or I can't wait to see him I can't wait to see the reward he'll have at that day your Prophet said about Paul his ministry was greater than all of the rest of the Apostles put together all of the rest of them put together I wonder why Peter didn't write about all this stuff because Peter didn't go through what Paul did Jameson go through what Paul did nobody else did Lord I pray you would help each of us maybe we're sitting here today and we're still trying to find out who we are and where we are and what we are in Christ maybe this is kind of frightening for us because we think oh no what if that's what if I don't wind up going there but each of us can have the Assurance today you'll never put us through more than what we're able to bear you'll help us and make a way I pray for every man woman boy and girl Lord that should help each of us that if it were to come down to life and death I remember several years ago being in China when brother Biscoe was arrested and they were looking for me and they called brother biscal back into interrogating me had my schedule of the Cities I was going to be preaching in and so on in his briefcase and he tore it up into little bitty tiny pieces and swallowed them so they wouldn't know where I was at and I'm not one bit embarrassed to say before this congregation today when I heard what had went on as a man I was afraid I was afraid from my brother I was afraid for those others who were arrested with him and I knew they'd come looking for me brother Murphy said brother Donnie we'll go if you want to go I said I'm not I ain't leaving I ain't running ain't no chicken they said well it's not so much being a chicken he said but I used to work for the police and I know how they think he said you can't just think about yourself if they arrest us in a place of the meeting they'll send you home but they'll throw these Believers in prison Lord when I was there and I saw a woman come into the hotel room where we had the meeting they rolled her in in a wheelchair and I'd rendered a suite A large size Suite so we could have two rooms to be able to hold the crowd and what I was preaching someone knocked on the door I thought oh my goodness here I go Lord I felt my face flush one of the brothers went to the door and it was just simply the maid just checking to see if we needed anything I'll never forget the look on that woman's face and she opened that door and saw them people but Lord that little woman that I saw push that wheelchair in or roll in that wheelchair at the end of that service after I preached and we prayed for the sick I saw that same woman roll that wheelchair out of that room because you raised her up out of that wheelchair so Lord May no under strain and difficulty you love to prove yourself oh Jesus help each one of us Lord oh we want to jump yes we want to shout we want to worship we want to praise God absolutely but we want something so deep in our souls and when it comes down if it took our very life we would say I'm willing to stand oh Lord help us I wonder what some of these people would do lord it's easy to see by what some have done which way they would have gone the way some of them have stood with me showed exactly how they would have stood with Paul better than Paul the same way the way they've stood with your seventh angel messenger proves they would have done Paul exactly the same way because it ain't me it ain't brother Branham it ain't no other preacher it's you in your body I want to stand with you Lord Jesus and when I say you I ain't meaning an image that's sitting on a throne in another dimension I'm talking about you in the form of your body all every preachers had him to say it I'll stand with you I'll stand with you brother I'm behind you I'm behind you yeah we've seen that and then when the hard times comes they're behind you all right about two miles out of sight where nobody can see him Lord God help us not to be cowards help us to stand for what's right Lord Jesus forgive those Lord I pray dear God that stood against your servant Paul forgive those O Lord of your children might have stood against your Elijah Prophet there's anything in them drawn back lord draw them back lord we love you today Jesus can we stand together so before long the tailor calls you back into the room try it on perfect fit slacks are the right things waste is exactly right vest fits perfectly the coat then the crowning of your life you'll stand there and you'll exchange and trade your old cross foreign I want to be near don't you when Paul stands there and he's given the martyr's crown and he's given a reward for all these things that he did for the cause of Christ let me tell you something we would not be where we are today if it had not been for a man called Paul the Apostle we would not bet where we are today had it not been for a man by the name of William Mary and Branham that was willing to suffer reproach could have been a multi-millionaire could have been a denominational speaker could have been whatever but he would not do it aren't you glad he would not do it now the question is will we do it or will we not I don't think there's a persecution coming against the bride let the first church aides know it's contrary to scripture what would be hated and despise yes I believe much greater than we have been will we be persecuted somewhat we've done been through that we know yes we can be they don't have to have laws all they have to have a society's pressure and it can pressure you a great deal yeah and let me tell you something after our pressure several years ago some of the message preachers went silent on certain things and won't preach it no more why I couldn't take the pressure but if they cut my tongue out of my mouth if they remove my fingers one by one God let me have the boldness and the courage to stand for this message if I have to give my life for it oh some of you would die for a book and a tape some of you have died maybe for a cross oh yes yes my Lord Jesus died on our cross what you have to be willing to die for is those who are bearing that cross and that image as well you see the Ephesian Believers did not stop being Christians I wonder how brother Nathan they must have felt horrible I wonder how they felt after they they denied this messenger a testimony someone brother Paul Pub and never got over their entire life no wonder Paul's prayed for them and said I pray God will not lay it to their charge oh my God that man wants to stand for Jesus and let the world go by oh praise the Lord just let the Lord Search Your Heart there now this morning friends I know this not been a very shout and type service but let's let's really get right with

night a requested prayer for him he's down on his hands and knees because he couldn't walk he's in church with us today praise the Lord still a little bit sore still dealing with a few things but I believe God's Not only able to touch our brother I believe he's able to make him well but you believe the same thing the Lord Jesus suffered stripes in his back so our brother could be healed in his let's continue to remember that the Lord will just be with him have many needs them on the church you're underwear many many of them so let's just keep the saints of God before the Lord remember there's power in you sharing the burdens of your brothers and sisters let's pray together Heavenly Father we love you Lord we thank you for the word today I know it's somber it's serious Lord God more than anything I want to hear those words well done I've never done much I know that I'll never I'll never be able to compare with a lot of these brothers but Jesus if I have one soul that my name will be associated with others through eternity what a thing that will be Lord God we're not laboring so that we can get more we're laboring so we can get them in and get out of this place Lord we're not designing a reward anyway we just want to be there if I can be there with you and your children that'll be all the reward I would want but keep us true Lord Jesus no doubt some of us said here today and we thought oh Lord what would I do if I would have been an Ephesus what I would have went without some of this sisters thought that I've been brave enough somebody's Brothers thought but I've been brave enough to gone Lord God I pray that should help each of us Lord God that we can stand for your truth no matter what comes our way we love you Jesus forgive us of our failures our shortcomings make us strong help us to love one another father forgive our sins as we forgive those that trespass against us we ask today our God in the name of Jesus Christ and the Saints said amen God bless you Saints I searched all over and couldn't find nobody but sing this song together as we go God bless you come back Lord willing wins and I'm expecting the Lord to speak to us again Hemmings has been good to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord amen thank God for his Mercy thank God for his Mercy look I know some of you've got families and friends and they've turned against the message and you think oh Lord there's no hope for him there's no mercy for them none of us know that I wouldn't want to be in some of the shoes of the people and saying the things that they've said but God Alone knows when a person has crossed that line between mercy and judgment pray for him pray that God will open their eyes and open their hearts to bring them back to the truth and remember whenever lot left Abraham you and I would have cut him off Abraham didn't Abraham risk his own life on the life of 318 servants to go down there and bring lot back did he make him a silver dollar sure never he went right back down there to Sodom and we know the end of him but God wouldn't even destroy it until he come down and talked to Abraham so your prayer might be the very one we our prayers ain't going to make them bride but our prayers might bring them to where they'll be saved and they won't wind up being lost wouldn't that be worth your prayer it's from it thinking maybe food poisoning Lord but I pray the spirit of God would move every symptom and I say to the devil you're a liar in the name of Jesus May It Go for my brother right now in Jesus name may he be made well praise be to God thank
