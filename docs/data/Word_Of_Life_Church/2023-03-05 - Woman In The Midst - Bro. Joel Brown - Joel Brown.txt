[Music] my soul [Music] out of here [Music] amen God bless you am I on am I good we'll just do it anyway how's that or is it what am I good okay I can't really see but praise the lord it's good to be in the house of the Lord once again the question is with that song how big is your cup is that right how big of a cup did you bring I got a green light it's on there but the Lord how big of a cup did you bring you might have a Bubba cup or you may have get you one of those big cups but it is good to be here once again and uh it's following my lot to be here and to uh to bring the word in to be honest with you Saints I'm excited about what God is going to do today not so much because it's me but because it's him if you have your adoption papers turn with me to The Book of John can't hear me can't hear me can you now there we go okay all right good praise the Lord that what my fault was it that wasn't their fault either everything's new so give the nudeness a time to to get settled there is that all right thank you brother Melvin for being bold enough to do that some people just sit and look at you [Laughter] God bless you it's important to hear what God has to say today amen Saint John chapter 8 we want to get our inspiration from verses 9 in particular but I want to read nine and ten and then we'll I'll come back and and pick some things up and while I'm here saying incidentally that there is no way this word is inexhaustible the things that we've heard the things that's been given unto us there's no way that you can say it in a few matter of just a few hours or just a lifetime even to be to be quite Frank so so I I do have a lot and this has been bubbling in in my spirit for quite some time but but I'll try to hurry through because it's something that I think that will be very poignant and as I began to think on on this little thought I I thought about the days when I was younger and hearing those old fire and brimstone sermons and and just being reminded oh boy you better get it straight because hell is real We Believe heaven and we we know that the realities of heaven but hell is real the devil is real the devil is possible as well but I just was was captured in in those thoughts of um and thinking of this thing so if it gets a little tight the Bible says once you converted strengthen your brethren how many converted folks we have in the house all right I'm gonna be counting on you because we know there's three types of Believers that Gather in every service the believer the unbeliever and the make-believer I'm after the unbelievers I'm after the make-believers so you Believers you all help me and you how can I help you brother Joel strengthen your brother the Bible says you can say an amen because there may be somebody sitting on the chair beside that's going through hell that's going through something that's about to destroy them as a whole completely but when you saw him coming of course they had a smile on their face they said God bless you how are you doing I'm doing fine but so will y'all help me out today yeah the Sanctified folks helped me out today the saved folks will you help me out today let me hear an amen all right let's Saint John chapter 8 verse 9 and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience because of guilty conscience needs no accuser we know this went out one by one beginning at the eldest even to the last and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst verse 10 when Jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers Half Men condemned thee let us in our heads Heavenly Father we thank you your word we know that your word is light your word is life your word is eternal so Lord you want to be captured by light today we want to be illuminated by life today we want to be reminded of something that's Eternal today because as we look around this whole crazy world in which we live Lord things are getting so dark so bleaks hopeless there's no source of of inspiration out there so Lord we have to attach ourselves to this word so may you come and do what you have already intended to do in this service through every vessel that you intended to use this day and may you magnify yourself through your people and it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen have your seats if we could just for for a moment for a while I just I really want to be conscious of my time because I don't want to go over I don't want to wear out your patients because I want to be invited back praise the Lord God is good this is broken by the way this is this is what I got from brother Donnie he mentioned and and when he was preaching about Rahab and I just keep it in my Bible just as a reminder keep it on display oh boy keep it on display so I'll just hang it right here I'll just keep it right here during the service so the two can be reminded amen you got to have that token on display you life evident amen even in your own home even when you're looking at yourself in the mirror nobody else is around but you you have to have it on display amen but I want to to draw today to the the simple thought of woman in the midst woman in the midst and it's a very striking scene this this scenario is always captivated me at times here lately for the past few months it's just been stirring really quite longer than that I should say just the the thought of it but we understand in looking at this woman and we're familiar with the story and we we know maybe if I have time and read some more of the scriptures on it as we go through this the service today but we we realize that this one was caught in a situation and she was being brought before some accusers and they were taking her to a man that they were trying to put him into position to be a judge over this situation and but the reality for her was is that her today had changed and her tomorrow was about to be oh so different everything about who she was was about to change everything that she had done everything that she had allowed herself to be captivated and inspired by was about to be changed forever and some of you no doubt are sitting here looking at me and listening to me today I'm here to tell you by the inspiration of God your tomorrow is about to be radically different because your today is about to change I promise you I promise you say I don't have any hope brother Joe I know I don't have any other on the source but your today is about to be changed because we have to realize that where we're going is a lot better than where we've been if brother Terry Horn was up here right now I can hear him say did you hear what I said because where you are going is a is a lot different it's better than where you've been I guarantee that her whole world was about to change Psalm 106 and once Praise You the Lord oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord who can show forth all his praise blessed are they the judgment and he that doeth righteousness at all times Remember Me O Lord with the favor that thou embarrassed unto thy people oh listen to this oh visit me with thy salvation salvation today is a visitor to you to me David says oh visit me with thy salvation Salvation becomes a guest nation is an opportunity for deliverance for victory for overcoming from welfare for prosperity it's going to be okay because salvation has come and made itself a visitor today for you it's gonna be okay Psalm 106 and 5 says that I may see the good of thy chosen that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation that I make Glory With Thine inheritance may see the good of thy chosen to give attention to to be able to see to to regard the chosen ones the choice ones that that Patron has given me the opportunity to see what it means to be chosen and also salvation has become this visitor to allow us to be able to rejoice in the gladness of thy Nation Rejoice means to to to to to worship to praise around God's people that I make Glory With Thine inheritance think about that that I make Glory With Thine inheritance salvation and opportunity that you who think that you aren't anything you that think that you can't you that think that that you're a nobody salvation Has Come Today to visit you to let you know that you can have the opportunity to Glory with the inheritance of God that word Glory means to shine to be bright to shine so you can have an opportunity to shine with the inheritance of God with God's portion with God's Property with good possession you are somebody because salvation has come to you you say you don't know my circle I don't need to know your circumstance I don't need to know what you've been through because where you're going is a lot better than where you've been just let all that go today is a new day for you you're listening out by way of the internet today is a new day for you I believe this that I may see the good of My Chosen the rejoice in the gladness of thy nation that I make Glory With Thine inheritance because in looking at this scripture in particular we can say it this way when I see it then what I saw will cause me to rejoice and my rejoicing will bring about changing me that I too will begin to shine because you have to see it before you see it so when you see it you can't see it so what I'm wanting you to do today is see it so you can see it when you see it I'm not confused open up your understanding verse 7 says our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt they remember not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even at the Red Sea nevertheless I love this word nevertheless in all of their forgetting and all their grumbling and all they're complaining nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake that he might make his mighty power to be known for the sake of or on account or because of his reputation because of his Fame because of his glory he did these things because of his name his reputation his glory that's why he's wanting to change radically your entire world today because all of heaven and all of eternity is backing what he says and what he's going to do why because his name is upon his people his people bear his identity who held the possession even the Devil Himself it doesn't matter who held the possession it had to go back to him free [Music] no matter what's binding you today you have a right to go back free nothing standing in the way listen he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't have to do a thing but just stop what he was doing did you hear that just stop what you're doing it's that simple click it off shut it down hello is that right my goodness is it really that simple it's really that simple just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance that inheritance hasn't left that Heritage is wherever you've left it it's still there it's still your possession free Oh my he had a right to it it was a god-given right because he by Grace had inherited and had been given to his fathers and handed down year after year no matter what had taken place if he lost it it must go free it meant Grace is is a way provided for every individual to return to the rightful inheritance Grace is the means through which we have that way back to our inheritance he's given it to us hmm being concerned about that you're you you you you you can't come you know and I've heard I'm gonna go and say this I've heard even comments just in in general talking about now that we're in a new church and and people are are seem to think that they can't no longer come here because it's new I leave that alone that's for my pastor but it's real nonetheless you have a right thinking that you're nothing Prophet says God who is rich in Mercy I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are I just told you about an inheritance some people don't even know what they possess some people don't even know what's in it already been given to them I'm here to let you know there is a way made there there is a portion of Eternity that's for you you have a place in the economy of God you don't know who you are you are not going to you're not going to be but now you are the sons of God it does not yet appear what we are who we shall be what we shall be but right now this day we're not going to be we already are because he's already made it so that we can be sometimes we need to shake off the weights and just get back in step and catch up with everybody else you say That's mighty arrogant brother Joel yes you better catch up because we're about to take we're about to leave here Saints it ain't time to lag behind it ain't time to let things weigh us down my woman in the midst your life that's in you the prophet says now your life that's in you now now somebody say now somebody say today at this moment the life that's in you now had to be with God before you were even become material here on Earth before there was anything but God you were one of his attributes hmm how in the world a woman in the midst of confusion of chaos of of of of of of of the railing work of words of the world she was still being called back to who she really was is that true woman in the midst now if what this woman had done was so bad according to the law listen if what she had done was so bad according to the law which they knew the the scribes and the Pharisees that they knew so well why didn't they take her to the courthouse or to the courtroom and bring conviction and render judgment there why didn't they do that huh these guys knew the law they were Experts of the law they were great expositors of the law of Moses they can tell you where he was what dated was what church he preached in what the title of the sermon was what paragraph what line and can't live a Victorious life at all they're just scribes and Pharisees message scribes message Pharisees Word of Life scribe oh yeah they're here Word of Life Pharisees hmm you gonna get yourself in trouble hmm I've been given away of Escape my but why didn't they do that they in all reality they did not care about this woman and and and and incidentally they probably didn't even really care about what she had done because they themselves have probably done some of those very same things right hello but it was an attempt to bring more shame it was an opportunity for them to have an audience hmm and you know there's there's something about having an audience that in boldings emboldens a person's purpose you get them by themselves and they won't be as bold but you get them in a little crowd huh where they can begin to make a name for themselves and you know but it's something about that atmosphere These Guys these scribes in these Pharisees the Pharisees in particular they they were crafty guys because you know they they held to the traditions of Moses of the fathers of of of of the Torah but they didn't so much hold on to the word you know what I mean they they they they held the traditions and and they would they would uh they would bring my Newt and and and vexatious uh uh uh extensions to the message of the hour they they bring extensions well let me tell you what he meant your Pharisee I don't care to hear what he meant I heard what he said and that's what I'm called to do is say what what and not say what said he meant so shut up Pharisee shut up scribe chatter chatter chatter chatter Ma so these two these two groups the Pharisees and the scribes though distinct in their expertise and what they did they had a United ambition they they they they had a United anointing even upon them and it was to scrutinize Jesus the manifested word of the hour to bring accusation against the message of the day hear me they wanted to entrap him in some way and these these folk with this anointing upon them they're always around to frustrate the purpose is that true they were always there to challenge truth and to bring up a question they were always there to challenge present day truth because the present day light was not in them they didn't fully understand it they couldn't understand it because it wasn't a part of who they were but yet they were religious and in that ambition to tear down and to destroy the manifested word there was a casualty of no concern to them you think about it all that's going on now around the the this this this is the message today there are a lot of casualties all because some Pharisee all because some scribe huh Shipwrecked lives let me tell you something brother you have something to answer for um who are you brother Joel brother Joel that's who I am better watch it brother Joel I am I'm watching me walk on my way out of here and I want to take as many as I can as I go I want to encourage as many as I can to shake yourself from these things I gotta hurry I got a lot to get to because knowing the law they were crying for judgment upon this sister because of her unlawful act they knew the law they knew every dot every Tittle they knew everything and here they were Earthly was blocking the way to the heavenly preventing someone from getting into heaven here she was being judged and condemned because of her past but the reality for her that day her judgment was standing right in front of her did you hear that today judgment is standing right before you not me but but the word judgment was standing right in front of her she was in the midst of her judgment greater than Solomon is here in 1961 but remember there wasn't a drop of rain fell to Noah got in the ark there was no fire fell at all till lot came out of solvent Jesus said it was it was in them days so it will be in the coming of the son of man the church it don't have to be judged it's already been judged for it judged Christ and Christ stood its judgment for the church when we are in him we are free from judgment and see what this sister did not realize is that she was in him because he comes to his own brother he's come to you today sister he's come to you today we are free from judgment if God judges you then he's unjust so if there are those outside of him who are bringing judgment upon you then they're being unjust they're uncredible they have no credibility they have no value they have no worth they have no ability they have no anointing they have no calling they have no place don't even give them the opportunity to land in your ear shut up you Pharisee that's impolite well sometimes you know I found out this I get in trouble with my wife so many times but sometimes being rude is the only thing some people will hear that's true you try to be nice you try to be diplomatic you're trying to be decent but the only thing that they will hear you just got to be down straight and just flat out and then they're going to have the audacity and nerve to get upset at you I've been trying to tell you but you won't listen my as we go on if God judges you then he's unjust Christ took our judgment for us praise the Lord and by one Spirit we're baptizing that body he that believeth on me has everlasting life and shall not come into judgment so today we find out that Society the the church world even they would rather have their theology they they they and instead of the the engrafted word the realities of the word the manifested word they would rather have their own theology they'd rather have their science they'd rather have their technology they would rather have their modern perspective is that right they would rather follow under the indoctrination of their boss of the company for which they work it's a powerful thing when you're in a powerful position in a powerful company you've got to march to their beat and not just when you're on the clock they watching you when you're off the clock they're hearing things you say when you're off the clock hmm but these things they'd rather have but for me in all of this modern things that are taking place today just give me Jesus just give me the Simplicity of this word manifested in this age because he took our judgment for us that we don't have to be bombarded and cower down to this Modern Age is that true we no longer have to wear the rags of sin we no longer have to to March to the beat of that drum we we have been given Royal attire we dress different huh I'm not talking about Justice we dress different we eat different things we're simply different we have to accept that fact that we are different now if you are trying to live a life that that says you should be different and you're cowering down to this Modern Age and you're living another way no no no no no no no no no that's not what I'm talking about you need to grab a hold of this word today and realize that you have been called you have been given at inheritance that will cause you to walk in that way of aristocracy I'm not talking about you anglophiles I ain't talking about all that's a British and the monarchy and all I'm talking about this Royal thing this Royal thing from eternity we've been given the Garb and everything to dress us properly this bride has made herself ready huh that's the Bible amen this scene Saint John 8 and 2. watch this Jesus consequently had just come from the Mount of Olives he'd been uh the day before ministering and doing everything that he was doing that day and he went to the Mount of Olives to pray and we find out that that was a place that he would go to a lot it's believed I believe I will not believe that in fact Mary and Martha's home was on I think the East Side of the Mountain The Garden of Gethsemane was on the west side but this was a place that he resorted to to get away from all of the all the nonsense and the craziness and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them here we go and the scribes and Pharisees of Saint John 8 and 2 and the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst that's what captivates my mind and my spirit so much with this story they set her in the midst in the middle of here this woman was in the middle here was her past and here was her future and something was about to happen that day that was going to change who she was where she had been what she had done and let her realize that this is who you've always been Lord she may have even had the stench of the ACT even upon her body come on now y'all know but yet he came to her they put her in the midst to do some damage to her not realizing that judgment was standing right that consequently right before them too and they say unto him master this Word of Life person they've done this they've done that and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and they go on and on and on was taken in adultery in the very act I saw them do it I heard the words come out of their mouth they can't be saved ain't no way did you pray for her did you put your arm around him and say brother you shouldn't have said that there's a better way [Music] that's meddling but it's true anyhow now Moses here they go now brother Branham said um the modern day Pharisees in the law commanded us that such should be stoned we've been given occasion to to get rid of this person bless God paragraph 10 1961 . huh it's the same spirit it's the same anointing it's the same devil I don't want to talk too loud I don't want to scare him just yet I want them to think he's got some Edge on this service to him that they might have to have to accuse him but Jesus stooped down so here this woman was and what strikes me so profoundly in this unfolding is that they were in church now you would think this would be the one place for her to find Refuge not that people would talk about her I'm gonna sit down for a little bit come to church to get help and out in the vestibule we're in the Sunday School room come on kids huh don't include them talk about them Church Folk should be in a position and a condition always to be of help it's not just the job of the man standing in this pulpit and no disrespect to the way I'm gonna say this it is not dependent upon Donnie Reagan solely huh there are people that come through those doors visitors that he may never date lay eyes on did you shake oh Lord let me shut up did you shake their hand did you tell them welcome I don't know who they are and I tell my kids I was telling them just the other day you better position yourself to be kind to the young people young people hear me huh well they're not a part of our group what is that [Applause] we're part of the body are we not yeah I wonder if I can find a place to hide got a lot of room a lot of places here now we find a lot of places to hide but let me let me go on I'm like oh that's so much I want to get to my praise the Lord but the woman in the midst so in church the eyes weren't compassionate the eyes were glaring at this little lady church folk glaring at somebody that needed help Brother JD she needed help the sermon hadn't even yet started she needed help the words were critical when they should have been loving and welcoming and the pronouncement that was that were coming that was riding on those words was killer she ain't worth two cents she ain't worth half a penny she ain't worth nothing church folk Sanctified Folk message Folk some of the honors meanest people on the face of the Earth yeah I said it where's my camera where whichever huh message Folk s because being called into this Royal thing there's some fish that's in that net that's not Royal but they think that they are huh people get a little money and they go to you know but let that stock market crash criticism there is a voice that's greater than criticism there are eyes that are more penetrating which see deeper than the situation and there is a verdict that's greater than that of the jury woman in the midst both the preachers and the congregation we're bringing judgment on this girl no hope for her in church maybe you're visiting today you you you you currently go to a church maybe and you just don't fit in there's room for you here at Word of Life Church that's a little weak but I'll take it that's enough fuel for me they might get my Pew they might get my seat Well they might need you a seat you ain't doing nothing with it ah so no doubt this was a very low day for this woman Micah is that out of pocket he talks about me all the time you say in the out-of-pocket stuff I try to make it truth though son just so you know he'll explain that you ask him talk about talk to him he'll tell you what I'm talking about no doubt this was a very low day for this woman and in fact it could have been that she was getting ready to surrender to her fate what she thought was the accumulation of degradation and the weight of her past and she was just saying I can't take it anymore I've come to church and I thought I was going to get some help but they didn't even shake my hand when I came through the door nobody talks to me anyway anymore when I come to church I'm in this situation a divorce all of these things my mama did this and I'm just coming with my Grandmama and all the people know it and nobody welcomes me hear me can I be real don't act like you don't know these things go on but she may have been about ready to surrender to her fate and watch this verse 6 and they said tempting him that they might have occasion to accuse him but Jesus stooped down I pray to God that there are situations in this church today and I want you to know that Jesus is here and he's coming by right by where you are and he's stooping down come on one signification of that act is that he is willing to go your your situation may be low so low so very low brother Joel you don't know how low but Jesus is stooping down lower than where you are lower than the mess that you're in he's willing to take on that identification for you he's willing to do that I can imagine that this is this seems beginning to unfold and and and and and the clamor and everything that's happening and the noise killer Stoners send her away all of this noise and Jesus is there and he's watching the crowd he's looking back at her he's looking at them not saying a word not breathing anything but he's watching this scene unfold and just as about sis was about to break about to give in he Stoops down he's stooping down again today here in 2023 over 2 000 years since this event took place he's still in the business of stooping because he knows he knows that his wife his little bride his his lady elect his woman his main squeeze his cocoa in his puffs she sometimes gets in trouble she sometimes does things she ought not to have done because she somehow loses her identity she she has amnesia I'm talking to somebody today now you that are do you know that are that are converted strength in your brother and say Amen to these things [Applause] just as she's about to break Jesus Stoops and this very action in addition to him being willing to go low was also it also signified to the the individuals that that in in this scene he was sending a message to them I'm not even regarding what you're saying I'm not even paying I'm not even listening to what you're saying so we have the power the ability and the calling and the opportunity today to not even listen to what the devil says to to not even be caught up in his environment huh is that true instead of coming in and and bickering and fighting he says in the message of token we're not to come together to talk about the message just while I'm here I'm gonna read this it don't really fit in but I thought of this we are to come together to get in the message hmm and the message is Christ he is the word that's right we're to get into it get beneath it yes sir he says that's what we're supposed to do so to get in it to get beneath it now if you're underneath something huh you're underneath something that no longer makes you the big man on top um well the dominating female on the top hmm witchcraft why'd I say that sis you need to shake that thing I'll leave a note for brother Donnie he might want to follow up on these things though but he was sending a message to them I'm not listening to you it was intentional it was purposeful in that he was saying I give you no regard I give you no place I'm not even hearing what you're saying and as I was saying you may think your situation is low it's bad let me tell you Jesus went lower than that Galatians 1 and 4 who gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our father where deliver means to pluck out to choose out for oneself so let one person from many I don't know particularly what your situation may be but you've been given an opportunity to get out of that situation and there are others who are in the same situation but have not been given the same opportunity you've been given so take your tents take your opportunity today fully Embrace this word today that's coming to you you've been plucked out of your situation this lady was being plucked out and she didn't even realize it she was being plucked out of her situation out of that evil world that she was in evil means full of laborers annoyances hardships pressured and harassed by laborers Galatians 1 and 5 to whom be glory forever and ever amen Philippians 2 and 6 who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God so you think your situation is low he went lower than that but he made himself of no reputation he deprived himself of the force and the ability that he had he emptied himself out the great canosis that brother Donnie has been speaking about so so so wonderfully and and to make he made himself void of who he was all for you he stripped himself of his deity in order to do that for you to do that for me Colossians 1 12 given thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light there's that word inheritance again Colossians 1 and 13 who have delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son we have been snatched out of Darkness think about that Saints we have been taken out of our conditions as much room as we have now in as high as these ceilings are there should be nothing to hold us back not one thing when we realized what he did for us what how he transformed who we were sure the rafters up there are no chandeliers to swing from and I found something to swing from ma when you get to thinking about what God has done what and not only what God has done but what God is doing and then you Captivate that and you bottle that up and then you begin to think about what God is going to do my who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature an image it's not a resemblance but it's the exact image huh the fullness and Jesus was the body that carried the name of God and there stood that name of God before this woman this woman was about to be awakened to the realities of who she was we could run off a list of conditions of circumstances of anointings on people's lives here and listening to to me by way of the internet and pick it up archive later a thief a liar a chief a a doubter a whoremonger a self-abuser an idolater an alcoholic a lesbian a homosexual abusers of mankind an addict a gossiper caught up in the occult huh now I'm not giving place to the devil I'm not opening things up because the spirit of the Prophet that's subject to the prophet I'm calling attention to these things to make you aware that these are conditions in people's lives and they've come to church to get help huh because he oftentimes will go way beyond our problem that we're in he'll go Way Beyond the circumstance he'll go Way Beyond the condition and what he will do is he will strike something that's a part of himself within us in order to release that part of us that is him in order to bring healing and deliverance so what are you saying brother Joel Victory is already in you is that right because the problem that you're going through the problem that you have it's just temporary but yet so many times we want to cabbage down on our current situation and we get trapped in that thing and it's over and over and repetition is the same old thing same old thing over and over and that's exactly where the devil wants you to be so God will take that situation and instead of dealing specifically with that situation he'll go way beyond that thing and he'll strike something deep down within you that you didn't even know was there a moment he strikes out with that word it will Quicken something within you and what is it it's a part of himself because only he the strength that he has the only thing that can withstand a punch from eternity is eternity itself because if he punched you exactly where you were it would take you out of here so he has to go down through the Avenues of your life maybe you come to church today going down through those Avenues of your life and he'll strike something that's so deep within who you are because it's a part of himself and the moment that connection is made there's something released in The Believer it gives him that overcoming power it gives them Victory because it's already in you healing is already in you is that right the Sabbath that's needed for grief is already in you I know when my precious mom died and you all probably heard me say it but I had to learn to lean on God in a different way because this was a new thing in my life I only have one mama and she left this world it broke my heart I was there and I I heard literally the last breath leave her body and I couldn't help but think at that time here I was being there on the day that I was born and here I was on the day that she left it was a beautiful thing and it's helped me so much during that time to to because you know just having a hard time and and and and and and the the knowing that as Josiah walked in the room that day at that particular time and she had her hand up and she was saying oh wow my family we helped to get her to that place huh it's not an easy thing to have two women in your house excuse me that's just a reality Saints that's just so but knowing that we helped her to get to that place to where she could have that oh wow moment who is it in your life that you can help get to that moment not so much as they're going to die but that they can realize you know because you were kind to me when I came to Word of Life Church oh wow I didn't know all of this was mine I didn't know I possessed all of these things because it just takes a voice greater than that of your circumstance to make you aware of these things he wants to connect you to himself which is really connecting you to the real you is that right because when this happens it's not about him but it's about you what did he say you shall do the Greater Works not I shall do the Greater Works so it's finally all about you It's All About You in Christ knowing who you are releases the power of God Saint John 8 9 back to our scene and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even to the to the last and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst and when Jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee and I love this she said no man Lord you can't tell me those ears were not still ringing with those bitter hurtful words you can't tell me that something within her wasn't being reminded of who she was because of that clamor was there reminding her of who she was but yet her testimony was this no man Lord and Jesus said unto her neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more everyone else was gone it was just her and Jesus the atmosphere in the room shifted something happened it didn't matter who was sitting beside her didn't matter who was on the right or on the left she was there because a word had just been given to her and it was hers and hers alone she knew from that moment something was different so when she said no man Lord she realized that not only had the physical appearance and the physical presence of her accusers had been deleted bloop delete that's a powerful button isn't it huh but all of this had been deleted but not only that but also her guilt her shame it had been totally eradicated there was no more need for her to hold on to these things because he said where are they I don't see them so why should you if God doesn't see the accusers in your life why should you still harp on these things is that all right and even the acceptance of what they had said she was it was deleted bloop it was all gone praise God my sins are gone because no doubt she herself would probably even prepared to die well this is it they're gonna Stone me I got called huh she'd prepared herself to be taken under to be taken over because this this this was a major step she'd been accused of saints huh it wasn't like she'd snuck out after curfew uh oh but Joel where are you going what do you know I don't know you tell me why'd I say that it wasn't that she was somewhere right behind the building puffing on a cigarette um is that all right she didn't steal a candy bar this was some big stuff is that right her sin was so great but Saints her forgiveness was greater than her seed the opportunity of forgiveness at the beginning greater than any you have done all that you have to do is just hit delete it's gone it's gone and it's not in a cash file it's not in the junk mail folder it's gone there ain't no I.T guy anywhere that can recover these things it's gone did you hear me it's gone because when the master hits that button you can rest assured no man Lord she could have held on to that guilt and that shame and it would have led to her demise she would have been taken out of here it should have been gone she was a prisoner Bound by the circumstances and in her mind but her confession you've been hearing about confession lately in the services but her confession and her response was nobody nobody not even the Devil Himself I don't care who you are I don't care how much money you have I don't care how much money you don't I don't care where you've been I don't care where you're going I don't care where you are I'm just letting you know that there is an opportunity for you to be free from these things woman in the midst and the Lord God said unto the woman Genesis 3 and 13 we find another woman because see this woman that we read about she was holding on to what was going to kill her thank you brother Terry did you hear what I just said she was holding on to the very thing that was going to kill her the thing that you're holding on to it will destroy you hear the word of the Lord today Let It Go Genesis 3 and 13 and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done one question one and the woman said I well you see what happened was and when you hear that somebody's about ready to make a big old lie well they gonna try to remove themselves from that situation see what happened was that that serpent beguiled me and I did eat she began playing the blame game so Eve was asked a specific question and this woman was also asked a specific question actually too where are your accusers and hath no man condemned thee two questions but only one answer why because when you have truth you don't need to talk a lot you can say what you got to say and move on you don't have to explain you don't have to give reason why because your memory has been deleted huh there's power in few words you are not defined by what you've done hear me we're closing you are not defined by what others say that you are you say who do you think you are but Joel who gives you that Authority this word right here I stand sure-footed I stand firm what does brother Andrew say I I I I I I said what I meant and I said it I believe it so I say it whatever he says that but there's no need to back up when you speak in truth people are going to come against you people are going to question it sure but you are not defined by the things that you've done because the reality is God defines Who You Are sinner insane alike so so don't worry about what you've done so much yes it might be bad yes it might be embarrassing it might even be shameful but remember Jesus made his reputation among people who did these types of things hmm that's who he hung out with is that right now again not to not to stir up anything on the negative side but I want I want just do something for me just a moment I want you to take just a second and think about maybe a bad thing that's captivating you now think about it I'll give you a second you know what he died for that now think about something else he died for that too Jesus Christ died for that Jesus Christ gave his life so that you no longer have to struggle with that whatever that was here he's real he wants to give us these things more than we even realize that we need them is that true First Corinthians 6 and 10. I said tight book those Corinthian characters they were some they were some bad dudes because Paul when he's addressing them he talks about them being fornicators you're gonna come back to this list again there were idolaters there were adulterers there were those who were effeminate come on Saints the sodomites they were thieves they were Covetous they were drunkards they were revilers they were extortioners they were abusers of themselves with mankind men laying with men women laying with women if we ain't here saying huh but even in all of that Paul says and such were some of you calling sin sin not excusing it by no means but it's looking at dead in the face and said you are that you were that you did that but that's what you were but you are washed ye are Sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God because he does his best work in some of these situations to take somebody and wash them and clean them and make them a person different than what they used to be as the musicians come the woman in the midst caught in a circumstance caught in a situation she didn't realize it but there was another life on the inside of her that had to be in a condition to receive the life that was to come if I can take just a second this one's just for me okay just for me I love this quote I love this one it's again she didn't realize that that that she had to have a change before the change could come so Jesus had to find her in that condition Jesus came to where she was Jesus come to your situation he come into the filth and the mire and the muck and everything to find you the question is asked please explain the mystery of the translation of the Bride wow again excuse me for a moment I'm at home I'm gonna kick my feet up all right he says just to change see our bodies let's say you know what I mean when I say that I don't mean to be sacrilegious I don't mean to say hours I don't mean to say this church I mean to say every believer Abraham he was looking for a promised son that was promised him is that right and the church is looking for a promised son the bride is that right the bride is looking for the promised son she better be you better be looking for the promised son huh because before the promised son could come to Sarah and Abraham their bodies had to be changed the condition that their bodies were in there was no way that they were going to bring forth a child the condition that you're in there's no way that you're going to take a rapture where my safe Folks at y'all supposed to be strengthening your brethren huh I thought y'all don't want that on me she was too old to have a baby she had no milk veins in her breasts her breasts was dried up her womb wasn't fertile she was sterile she could not have the baby her heart was too old to stand labor if the power of God would drop on you right now in your condition you would not be able to withstand that rapture hmm I gotta clean up what I messed up hmm so what happened God changed her back to a young woman and he did Abraham the same thing because he said his body was as good as Dead Sea and he had to change their body in order to receive the promised son and we cannot receive the promised son that's promised us today in these bodies that we live in these bodies are sin amen now you cute folk that's a quote for you your body is sin the first conscience controls the body we see field taste of all here and it's just got us all scrupled up well I thought well I felt led that you scrupled up that's what your Prophet said you're scrupled up anytime you go to relying on the these these these Avenues we reason and everything else but that new body that comes from this Born Again it'll pass away it's that inside something that lives everybody understand and say Amen it's not this outside see tasteful smell here it isn't it's subject to death and will die but the inside part of you down in here inside that is the person that cannot die woman in the midst here she is about to die that body that old dusty devilish frame that we so dress up and Doctor up and take care of we brush his hair brush his teeth praise God you do that as brother Donnie says for the sake of those sitting around you please do that but we'll go to the Fine Mall the stores and we'll buy fancy clothes and put on this old body it's just death it's subject to death and will die and that's the person that the New Life Starts from listen to how he places this that's the person that the New Life Starts from from this new birth you got to be born again because the new life that's coming that he's promised that's where it begins that's what it comes to and it builds another person listen it builds another person in the image of this person you are so he has to have some material to work with and he can't use this old dusty devilish thing he can't use your opinion he can't use your thoughts you must be born again so potentially it's in here and what is it the word promised before the foundation of the world and around there this only reflects the negative talking about this body that will reflect the positive the word see and the same thing or the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word as the same thing did to Sarah so the body the word that is in you becoming born again praise God my sins are gone I've been born again and the word that's already in you that body that's coming will material our eyes around that word so it is imperative read your Bible pray every day to strengthen that inner word to feed that inner word because there is a word coming to that word there's a body coming to that new changed body and that's the only way it can materialize something that he's created he's coming to that that deposit of Eternity that he put in you put in me put in every believer that's what he's coming back for that's the only thing that can be quickened woman what are you in the midst of today little bride what's your circumstances today you've been presented with a word today that will totally change who you are because you cannot you cannot I assure you of this you cannot base your Forever on what you see right now hear me if you try to base your Forever on what you're seeing right now you're going to be resentful nobody's going to want to be around you because there has to be something more to take place let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we love you and we thank you for your word we thank you for the change that's come in our lives we thank you for the illumination that you've given to us that you showed us and Lord with that you've created within us a desire to continue to keep going over and over and over your
