[47:33] way your healing is on the
[47:41] [Music]
[47:44] [Applause]
[47:45] [Music]
[47:53] way I believe that
[47:58] your healing was done brother brand said
[48:00] before the foundation of the
[48:03] world you know we we look at that
[48:05] sometimes we look at our human feelings
[48:08] our human
[48:09] emotions sometimes it clouds the the
[48:12] revelation of what's actually
[48:14] ours you know I was thinking and I was
[48:17] thinking this past weekend too
[48:19] how growing up you know you I grew up
[48:22] with the tapes in the home you know
[48:25] Wednesday night we listen to tape
[48:27] service my dad had you know the big real
[48:29] to real we you know I've heard
[48:32] the profit on my
[48:36] life then you get situations in your
[48:39] life and
[48:40] you we've all thought if brother Brandon
[48:43] was
[48:45] here you have we all have if brother
[48:48] Brandon was here he'd go to my
[48:53] house he he'd pray over me discern my
[48:56] thoughts and tell me to go my way I'm
[49:00] Healed you know when there a lot of
[49:03] people left this
[49:05] message one that human form
[49:11] left when he left they couldn't see the
[49:13] healing anymore they couldn't see the
[49:16] Deliverance
[49:18] anymore but this morning if I can convey
[49:21] one thought to
[49:23] you the same God
[49:26] that stood there beside
[49:28] him when he discerned of thoughts some
[49:32] of the people he would just lay their
[49:33] hands on never say a word they'd walk
[49:36] off
[49:38] healed he's here
[49:41] today he hasn't changed he hasn't left
[49:44] hasn't
[49:45] diminished you know that's just the way
[49:47] our thinking is you know
[49:50] they we have to have a revelation of who
[49:52] we are you know so this morning if if we
[49:57] could keep that thought of who who who
[50:00] we really are and who God is to
[50:04] us let's pray this morning before we go
[50:06] to the
[50:08] word Heavenly
[50:10] Father Lord I have so many emotions
[50:14] going through my
[50:15] mind My
[50:18] Heart Lord
[50:21] nervous Lord in my human
[50:24] brain keeps throwing up doubt and worry
[50:28] and
[50:31] fear but Lord may I channel that part in
[50:34] my heart in my soul that your Prophet
[50:37] said there was the Throne of God lord
[50:40] and if we can put
[50:42] aside ourself this
[50:45] morning lay our human feelings aside and
[50:48] look to a
[50:49] promise you said I'll be with you even
[50:52] in you to the end of the world yes
[50:56] Lord we're in a spot to this morning
[50:58] that is one of the greatest positions to
[51:01] be in it is to feed your
[51:04] bride Lord as a human I don't want this
[51:09] spot Lord I've got nothing to
[51:13] say that would be a benefit with my own
[51:24] words
[51:28] but Lord you promis that if
[51:31] we let you have your
[51:34] way if we set ourselves
[51:38] aside we would see your
[51:43] glory there's many needs
[51:46] Lord there's so many
[51:50] needs all of hell has opened up on this
[51:54] bride
[51:55] Lord we see our sister Erica in a
[51:57] position this morning where she needs
[51:59] your
[52:00] touch Lord I was sitting in the back and
[52:02] I was thinking of those four
[52:05] friends that took their
[52:09] budy to say You
[52:12] Lord he didn't have the power to get
[52:14] himself there he didn't have the power
[52:17] to climb up on the top of the house he
[52:19] didn't have the power to tear the roof
[52:22] off but they did
[52:26] Lord let us to be those friends this
[52:31] morning Lord if we have to tear the roof
[52:34] off of Heaven for our sister this
[52:35] morning
[52:37] Lord and set her at your
[52:42] feet Lord you put that power in
[52:46] us I pray that you anoint our hearts
[52:49] this morning to receive Lord may they
[52:52] look past who I am I am one of their own
[52:54] Lord
[52:55] I'm just a friend a
[52:58] relative Lord if they would pull on
[53:01] Heaven this morning they could hear from
[53:02] you Lord if I get out of the
[53:05] way speak to your children this morning
[53:08] Lord we love you we invite you Lord we
[53:10] feel your wonderful presence here this
[53:13] morning we're so
[53:15] grateful Lord that you would honor us
[53:18] with your wonderful presence Lord thank
[53:19] you for the songs that are sung the
[53:22] worship Lord we thank you for
[53:24] deliverance from the requests that been
[53:26] made this morning Lord we pray that you
[53:28] would have your way in Jesus name amen
[53:32] if you have your Bibles you'll turn to
[53:35] Romans chapter
[53:41] 8 we'll start it I'll read a
[53:44] couple scriptures after this you can sit
[53:47] after we read
[53:48] this 8:1 14-1
[53:54] 17 for as many as are led by the spirit
[53:57] of God they are the sons of
[54:00] God for you have not received the spirit
[54:03] of bondage again to fear but you have
[54:06] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[54:08] we cry Abba Father the spirit itself
[54:11] Bears
[54:13] witness with our spirit that we are the
[54:15] children of God and if the if children
[54:17] then heirs HS of God and Joint HS with
[54:20] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[54:23] that we may also
[54:26] be also glorified together may the Lord
[54:29] bless his word you can be
[54:33] seated i' like to speak this morning on
[54:35] what belongs to God belongs to
[54:42] you I think so many times we we get to
[54:46] the place where we don't understand what
[54:48] really belongs to us what we really
[54:52] have and if you're a join there with
[54:54] Christ if if you're an heir of God you
[54:56] know you we hear how a wheel is read
[54:58] when somebody passes the wheel is read
[55:01] and you know and sometimes it's a long
[55:05] lost uncle and you get
[55:08] everything or or you get
[55:11] nothing but we look at when the wheel
[55:14] was
[55:15] read the wheel that God wrote concerning
[55:19] you the deal is with with
[55:22] him he died the whe was ready and when
[55:26] he died he gave you everything
[55:29] everything anything you have need of he
[55:33] gave it to you but then he rose again so
[55:35] he can share it with
[55:37] you he gave you everything and then Rose
[55:41] so you can have it
[55:43] together that's the perfect kind of will
[55:47] that's the you know we would all love
[55:50] say if our our Granddad our grandmother
[55:51] passed away left us something in wheel
[55:53] that you would you would want the what
[55:55] what they give you would want to share
[55:56] that with them but you
[55:59] can't but God says I'll share with
[56:01] everything that I have I've give to
[56:03] you in John 1:12 it says but as many
[56:06] received him to them gave you power to
[56:08] become sons of God even to them that
[56:11] believe on his name gave them power to
[56:13] become sons of God there has to be an
[56:16] adoption the old man has to die and then
[56:18] you become a Son of God even to them
[56:22] that believe in his name which were born
[56:23] not of the blood nor the will of the
[56:25] flesh nor the will of man but of
[56:28] God brother Bram said God who's rich in
[56:31] Mercy now we are a part of God you
[56:33] always was you don't remember it because
[56:35] you're only an attribute of God you were
[56:36] only in his thinking your very name if
[56:39] it were on the book of life it was put
[56:41] there before the foundation of of the
[56:43] world he knew you were
[56:45] there I'm only saying this not to mix up
[56:48] Doctrine but to straighten it out that
[56:51] we might get away from this fear and
[56:53] this scare you don't know who you are
[56:56] you're not going to be you are now you
[57:00] now are the sons of God you always were
[57:03] the sons of God you know we can identify
[57:07] ourselves with our family our people we
[57:09] work with our loved ones on our
[57:11] jobs you know there's nothing wrong with
[57:13] that it's human nature but God wants us
[57:15] to see past this Humanity God wants us
[57:18] to see past the the troubles in our
[57:20] lives the things that we're going
[57:21] through the battles that we Face the
[57:23] sickness in our lives the our loved ones
[57:25] the things they're going through God
[57:27] wants us to look past that with you like
[57:29] I I was at brother Homer's last week
[57:32] last weekend and I was talking so many
[57:33] times we look at the issues in our lives
[57:36] with our human
[57:38] eyes and then when we look at it with
[57:41] our human human eyes our human Minds we
[57:43] we we we we tend to just blow it up and
[57:45] it's so big and it's so
[57:48] bad and he tells us look at it through
[57:51] God's eyes look at your problem through
[57:54] God's eyes
[57:55] eyes because God says I have given you
[57:58] through my will I have given you
[58:00] everything you need for that problem
[58:03] everything that you need to get over
[58:05] this issue that's in your life
[58:06] everything you need for healing of
[58:08] cancer for healing of TB or whatever it
[58:10] is in your life he says I've already
[58:12] given you that you just need to look at
[58:14] it through my
[58:15] eyes it's so hard to do with human
[58:19] nature especially when it's our problem
[58:22] when we're the ones it's our doctors's
[58:25] report when it's our symptoms when it's
[58:27] our
[58:29] child as I've said before it's so hard
[58:32] to have faith when you're the one
[58:36] grieving you're the one grieving you
[58:38] need me to have faith for you I need you
[58:41] to have faith for
[58:42] me brother Donnie and sister Carol and
[58:45] the family they need us to have faith
[58:46] for them you know it's like I I told
[58:49] Brother Jimmy a while ago sometimes a
[58:51] bad report makes a a good report report
[58:54] even
[58:56] better it makes a good report
[58:59] greater we don't look at the symptoms we
[59:01] don't look at the circumstances we don't
[59:03] look at what is right before human eyes
[59:06] because when you were wrode in the
[59:10] wheel he said healing belongs to
[59:13] you he didn't throw a formula in there
[59:16] he didn't throw some way to work it up
[59:18] and say you have to do this I want you
[59:19] to pray three times a day I want you to
[59:21] read your Bible four times a day I want
[59:23] to make sure you you you you pay 15 and
[59:27] a half%
[59:28] ties there's no formula for healing it's
[59:32] the children's bread it belongs to you
[59:35] when he wrote in the wheel Deliverance
[59:37] for the besetting sin in your life
[59:39] there's no special
[59:41] formula there's nothing that says you
[59:43] got to work it
[59:45] up it's
[59:51] free sometimes you know brother BR made
[59:54] this statement you when when when the
[59:55] bride recognized her position that the
[59:58] Rapture would go and so many times we
[1:00:00] use that as a cliche when the bride sees
[1:00:03] who she is she'll leave we hear that
[1:00:05] often and often but do we ever really
[1:00:07] recognize the reality of it that that
[1:00:09] actually has to happen before we leave
[1:00:12] yeah that has to actually happen before
[1:00:15] you can receive everything God has for
[1:00:17] you you have to recognize who you are
[1:00:21] you have to recognize your position in
[1:00:23] God you were in God's mind before the
[1:00:24] foundation of the world yes you always
[1:00:27] was you always will
[1:00:31] be God sees the perfect
[1:00:35] you but Satan makes sure he clouds that
[1:00:38] view from
[1:00:40] you he don't want you to feel like an
[1:00:42] heir he don't want to feel you to feel
[1:00:44] like a son or daughter of God he wants
[1:00:47] you to question so much God why is this
[1:00:49] happening in my life I thought I was
[1:00:51] your son I thought I was your daughter
[1:00:53] why is this happening to me
[1:00:55] yeah and so many times God says because
[1:00:58] that's my perfect
[1:01:00] will that's the part we don't want we
[1:01:02] don't understand if this is God's
[1:01:04] perfect will for
[1:01:06] me he said I can have healing he said I
[1:01:09] can have Deliverance he said I can have
[1:01:10] joy he said I can have peace he said I
[1:01:13] can have healing why am I going through
[1:01:16] this sometimes you have to get through
[1:01:18] that to get that
[1:01:21] amen sometimes you have to go through
[1:01:23] valleys
[1:01:25] sometimes you have to go over mountains
[1:01:26] it's not all straight interstates all
[1:01:28] the way
[1:01:30] through cuz like I said last last time I
[1:01:33] preached here sometimes that's the only
[1:01:36] time that God has fellowship with us is
[1:01:39] when we go through something that's the
[1:01:41] only time we talk to him that's the only
[1:01:43] time we pray to him is whenever things
[1:01:45] are so hard in our life we don't know
[1:01:47] how we're going to make it from one day
[1:01:48] to the next and then we decide to cry
[1:01:51] out from God after we tried everything
[1:01:53] else when are we going to get to the
[1:01:55] spot when we try him first right when we
[1:01:58] try God first as soon as it comes upon
[1:02:01] I'm not saying nothing wrong with
[1:02:02] doctors we have to have
[1:02:05] them we have to have them brother
[1:02:08] brandham said you had
[1:02:12] to but we wait till it's so
[1:02:15] dark we don't know which way to turn we
[1:02:18] don't know what we're going to do from
[1:02:20] one day to the next before we ever call
[1:02:22] out to God do we ever get to the spot
[1:02:25] when we're on top of the mountain and
[1:02:27] everything is peace and love and joy and
[1:02:29] we sit down and just have fellowship
[1:02:31] with God where are those days gone where
[1:02:33] have they gone come on come your bank
[1:02:37] account is as big as it's ever
[1:02:45] been I know it was
[1:02:47] quite listen I had an hour and a half
[1:02:49] for no I was coming here so it is what
[1:02:53] it is
[1:03:00] it's so often human nature will we get
[1:03:03] our best
[1:03:05] life is when we leave God out of
[1:03:08] it you're living your best life and the
[1:03:12] one who gave it to you you haven't
[1:03:14] included
[1:03:16] him you haven't included him you want
[1:03:20] all the
[1:03:21] healing you want everything he has to
[1:03:23] offer
[1:03:25] when he gives it to you you haven't
[1:03:26] included him come on that's
[1:03:30] right I promise you you can leave here
[1:03:32] today healed amen because he promised it
[1:03:36] yes you can leave here richer
[1:03:39] today naturally richer financially
[1:03:42] richer you can leave richer here
[1:03:46] today but if you did would you include
[1:03:49] him in
[1:03:53] it you could could leave here happier
[1:03:55] than you've ever been in your life walk
[1:03:56] out the doors to something just overcome
[1:03:58] you and I can't believe I'm just happy
[1:04:00] everything's going good would you
[1:04:02] include him on
[1:04:04] now would you give him the praise for it
[1:04:07] would you give him the glory I I ain't
[1:04:10] even turn the page and I don't know why
[1:04:11] I'm going this
[1:04:17] way God wants to be part of your
[1:04:22] life more than you want him part of your
[1:04:25] life God wants to give you joy
[1:04:29] peace money yes healing happiness
[1:04:35] overcoming power Deliverance
[1:04:38] salvation the list goes on and on and on
[1:04:41] he wants to give all of that to you more
[1:04:44] than you want
[1:04:46] it your human mind cannot want it
[1:04:49] enough your human heart can't want it
[1:04:53] enough
[1:04:55] yeah thank you
[1:04:58] Lord we have to find our position
[1:05:03] right future
[1:05:06] home if you are the bride the bride is
[1:05:09] part of the
[1:05:10] husband if the only place you the only
[1:05:14] place you'll recognize it is recognize
[1:05:15] what part of that husband brother B says
[1:05:19] in pareses that word the husband is the
[1:05:23] word
[1:05:24] what part of that word that you
[1:05:27] are are you fulfilling the part of the
[1:05:30] word that you
[1:05:32] are come on now is your life fulfilling
[1:05:34] the
[1:05:36] word are you living the part of the word
[1:05:39] that is
[1:05:41] you there's the word says you can have
[1:05:44] healing right so many times we we we
[1:05:48] want to work the word to fit
[1:05:50] us we we want it to fit us instead of us
[1:05:54] fitting the word we want our life to we
[1:05:58] want the word to adjust to our
[1:06:01] life and God says you need to conform to
[1:06:05] the word yeah because that's who the
[1:06:07] husband
[1:06:09] is am you know we we got people nowadays
[1:06:13] that that that you know they try to fit
[1:06:15] the word to fit them and they they talk
[1:06:18] about these you know well brother
[1:06:20] brandom said this about about this you
[1:06:23] know
[1:06:24] and but he didn't say anything about
[1:06:26] this this is the gray
[1:06:28] area when he talked about makeup and
[1:06:30] stuff but he didn't say what color and
[1:06:32] stuff this a grayer and fingernail
[1:06:34] polish and this but he he talked about
[1:06:37] red fingernail polish he talked about
[1:06:39] these kind of clothes but he didn't talk
[1:06:40] that's a gray
[1:06:42] area a gray
[1:06:44] area oh the word says the bride will be
[1:06:47] in Pure White okay there will be no gray
[1:06:50] areas she will not put on anything Gray
[1:06:58] why why would we want to try to get so
[1:07:01] close people want to fit in they want to
[1:07:04] fit in they want to be part of the
[1:07:06] message but they want to fit in at work
[1:07:08] they want to fit in at
[1:07:11] school I'm going to I'm going to say
[1:07:14] this if if he didn't say anything about
[1:07:15] it it's a gray area you might ought to
[1:07:17] stay away from
[1:07:19] it dress yourself in what you know is
[1:07:22] pure white and that is the
[1:07:25] word and with that becomes everything
[1:07:29] that you
[1:07:30] own everything you possess is pure
[1:07:37] white you're not going to find healing
[1:07:39] in a gray
[1:07:40] area you're not going to find
[1:07:42] Deliverance in a gray
[1:07:45] area you have to put on the word and the
[1:07:48] word the Bible says she will be without
[1:07:49] spot or
[1:07:51] wrinkle because she possesses him
[1:07:54] everything that he is she
[1:08:00] possesses it's not enough just
[1:08:03] to agree that hey I'm a member of the
[1:08:05] pride I go to Word of Life it doesn't
[1:08:08] God doesn't mean it matters what church
[1:08:11] you go to what congregation you belong
[1:08:15] to knowing you and knowing God and God
[1:08:18] knowing you is
[1:08:19] wonderful but if you end up if God
[1:08:21] allows you to go through a hard trial
[1:08:23] and a hard
[1:08:26] test if you don't know who you
[1:08:29] are yeah you say I know God but do you
[1:08:32] know who you
[1:08:37] are we begin to recognize what he has
[1:08:40] for us Satan's not going to tell you
[1:08:43] Satan's not going to tell you that this
[1:08:45] word is wrong this message is wrong
[1:08:47] we've already you've already been that
[1:08:48] you're predestinated you have the Holy
[1:08:50] Ghost listen just because you have the
[1:08:52] Holy Ghost doesn't doesn't mean that
[1:08:54] you're not going to battle things it
[1:08:56] doesn't mean you're not going to that
[1:08:57] probably means you are that means you're
[1:09:00] going to go through things in your life
[1:09:02] if you have the Holy Ghost you're the
[1:09:03] one that's got going to have a lot of
[1:09:05] Trials you're the one that's going to
[1:09:06] have a lot of tests you why because God
[1:09:08] loves you that seems like a paradox
[1:09:10] don't
[1:09:11] it God thinks so highly of us he's going
[1:09:15] to put us through a
[1:09:17] trial he loves you so much amen he's
[1:09:20] going to give you some hard
[1:09:22] times
[1:09:27] why because he knows what's in you he
[1:09:31] knows what you possess he will not put
[1:09:33] more on you than you can bear sometimes
[1:09:36] it looks dark it looks
[1:09:38] bleak and you say I didn't ask for this
[1:09:41] there ain't a single one in here raise
[1:09:42] your hand said Lord give me a trial I
[1:09:44] want to I want to test this thing that
[1:09:46] you've given me I want to test this Holy
[1:09:48] Ghost to make sure it's the real thing
[1:09:49] nobody's here raised their hand and said
[1:09:51] give me a trial give me a test
[1:09:54] it's God's Sovereign
[1:09:57] Grace he need sometimes he needs you to
[1:09:59] come up
[1:10:00] higher sometimes he needs you to get out
[1:10:02] of that rut that you're in right amen
[1:10:05] but remember this if he gives you a
[1:10:08] trial he already knew ahead of time that
[1:10:10] you would go through it you might not go
[1:10:13] through it the first time you might not
[1:10:14] go through it the first 20 times but if
[1:10:18] God give you a trial you're going to get
[1:10:20] through it that's a promise he'll never
[1:10:23] put more you can
[1:10:24] bear your trial I can't handle your
[1:10:26] trial God looked at your shoulders look
[1:10:28] at mine said hey yours are wider than
[1:10:32] mine now I can try to get you on a roof
[1:10:35] and I can help you tear a roof off and I
[1:10:38] can help drop you
[1:10:41] down sometimes that that's our
[1:10:44] position that's what God wants us
[1:10:47] for to have the power for somebody
[1:10:50] else because you possess that power
[1:10:55] amen my wife gave me a quote while ago
[1:11:00] her
[1:11:01] and Came Upon her
[1:11:05] text brother brandom said your own power
[1:11:07] of faith has pulled from the
[1:11:10] supernatural
[1:11:12] God the desire of your
[1:11:17] heart your own power of faith has pulled
[1:11:23] the desire of your heart from
[1:11:28] God the desire of your heart do you
[1:11:31] desire to be healed yes do you desire to
[1:11:34] be to have joy peace Deliverance yes we
[1:11:41] all
[1:11:42] do brother BR said your own faith pulls
[1:11:46] that out of
[1:11:50] God are we using
[1:11:52] it
[1:11:56] Satan's job is to keep you from
[1:11:57] recognizing who not only who you are but
[1:11:59] who you belong
[1:12:01] to in thy
[1:12:03] house sometimes we we don't look at the
[1:12:06] realize the power that we
[1:12:09] have we don't realize
[1:12:13] it you have the same
[1:12:15] power laying in here in you that God had
[1:12:19] when he said let there be
[1:12:22] light same power
[1:12:24] it hasn't
[1:12:25] changed but bandom said in thy
[1:12:28] house you're talking about Jupiter and
[1:12:31] Mars and these stars that you see now
[1:12:33] think about 100 light travels he said
[1:12:36] about
[1:12:37] 186,000 m per
[1:12:39] second take 120 million years by 1
[1:12:44] second
[1:12:45] 186,000 it will break down to 120
[1:12:48] million years that's what you get that's
[1:12:50] miles it just makes you feel like you're
[1:12:54] you're just but now then beyond that
[1:12:57] there's many just as many moon and stars
[1:13:00] and he holds them in the power of his
[1:13:01] own word that's the very same thing that
[1:13:04] holds them in you as a
[1:13:10] Christian see there you
[1:13:12] are in Leviticus 20:24 he said but I
[1:13:16] said unto you you shall inherit their
[1:13:18] land I will give it unto you to possess
[1:13:21] it a land that floweth with milk and
[1:13:22] honey I am the Lord your God which hath
[1:13:25] separated you from other people God says
[1:13:28] you're different you're different than
[1:13:30] everybody else You Are My People you
[1:13:32] shall therefore put difference between
[1:13:35] clean beasts and unclean between unclean
[1:13:36] fouls and clean you shall not make your
[1:13:38] souls abominal by Beast or by foul by
[1:13:42] any living manner that creepeth on the
[1:13:44] ground which I have separated from you
[1:13:47] as unclean and you should be holy unto
[1:13:49] me for I the Lord am Holy and ser
[1:13:51] severed you from other people and you
[1:13:55] should be mine God said I've severed you
[1:13:57] from other people I've divided you I've
[1:13:59] separated
[1:14:00] you other people see who you
[1:14:05] are when God separates you from other
[1:14:09] people it leaves a
[1:14:11] mark people recognize you yes sir you
[1:14:15] you look you look at look at Rahab in
[1:14:17] the Bible when them spies come in there
[1:14:19] what does she tell them we know who you
[1:14:21] are we know who your God is we know the
[1:14:25] things that he's
[1:14:27] done you a lot of you have probably had
[1:14:30] experiences at work or somewhere else or
[1:14:32] even sisters come up to you and say
[1:14:33] there's something different about you
[1:14:35] where do you go to church sometimes
[1:14:37] people ask where you go to church just
[1:14:39] by what you look
[1:14:41] like sometimes I'll ask you where you go
[1:14:43] to church because the way you treat
[1:14:45] others there's something special about
[1:14:48] you amen but God has separated you why
[1:14:51] because you are his own
[1:14:56] but the children of Israel failed to get
[1:14:57] a revelation of that you know the land
[1:14:59] that that that God told him he said to
[1:15:01] push it push it out all the everything
[1:15:03] that's in your land push it out all the
[1:15:06] people kill them
[1:15:08] all kill doubt kill worry everything in
[1:15:12] your land that hinders you from getting
[1:15:13] the promise God said to kill it if you
[1:15:16] got fear in your life you need to kill
[1:15:18] it if you got worry if you got doubt in
[1:15:20] your life you need to you need to kill
[1:15:21] it amen don't let it stay in there
[1:15:24] that's what happened got the children of
[1:15:26] Israel what got them later is they said
[1:15:28] well we'll let give you this little
[1:15:29] corner over here well let you sit over
[1:15:32] here you can work for us
[1:15:35] sometimes and then what God Said do God
[1:15:37] said kill it yeah get it out of our
[1:15:40] lives so we get things in our life and
[1:15:41] we push them in a corner and with a
[1:15:43] little pill bottle and we accept it we
[1:15:46] accept the doctor says well you're going
[1:15:48] to probably have this all your life well
[1:15:50] okay is there something I can take for
[1:15:52] it that ain't God's promise to you God's
[1:15:56] promis that you could be
[1:15:57] delivered of everything you have need
[1:16:01] of we rely on ourselves we rely on our
[1:16:05] own abilities we we rely on doctors more
[1:16:07] than we do God come on if you've been to
[1:16:11] doctors around here and enough you know
[1:16:12] some of the doctors around will tell you
[1:16:13] I can't heal you but God can they will
[1:16:16] tell you when I had back surgery right
[1:16:19] before he put me under Dr Duncan told me
[1:16:21] he said I cannot heal you but God can
[1:16:23] heal you they put me under and when they
[1:16:25] put me under they all got around me and
[1:16:27] prayed the those
[1:16:30] staff because he realized he wasn't a
[1:16:35] Healer and I got healed that
[1:16:38] way I got healed that
[1:16:41] way but I refuse God God that's the way
[1:16:45] God chose for me to push him out of my
[1:16:49] land but don't let anybody any doctor
[1:16:51] any person anybody ever tell you you
[1:16:54] have to live with this
[1:16:56] now you don't have to live with anything
[1:16:58] that's not of God you can have
[1:17:01] deliverance from anything that's not of
[1:17:03] that's not of
[1:17:08] God in Exodus 23:30 by little and little
[1:17:12] I drive them out from before thee until
[1:17:14] thou be increased and inherit the land
[1:17:16] God says I will drive them
[1:17:19] out why are we not getting things driven
[1:17:22] out of our life because because we're
[1:17:23] not allowing God to do
[1:17:25] it he said the battle is not yours it's
[1:17:28] mine sayeth the Lord
[1:17:30] amen he tells them drive them out but he
[1:17:33] says I will drive them
[1:17:36] out all you got to do is ask amen God I
[1:17:40] don't want this in my
[1:17:41] life you put the Power in me you put the
[1:17:44] faith in me brother bam said your faith
[1:17:45] will only go so far but then God's faith
[1:17:48] takes
[1:17:49] over why because it's him anyway it
[1:17:51] ain't you right
[1:17:54] amen and I will set thy bounds from the
[1:17:57] Red Sea even unto the Sea of the
[1:17:58] Philistines from the desert unto the
[1:18:00] river I will deliver the inhabitants of
[1:18:03] the land into your hand and thou shalt
[1:18:05] drive them out before thee first he says
[1:18:07] I will drive them out then he says you
[1:18:09] will drive them out come on now why he
[1:18:13] is
[1:18:15] you yes he is you you are him you are
[1:18:20] one amen I sure hope that there was a
[1:18:23] marriage that took place yes I sure
[1:18:27] hope we when we sing the song he became
[1:18:30] me that I might become him by
[1:18:32] Grace you have there that has to be a
[1:18:34] revelation amen if not it's just words
[1:18:37] fit together with music there has to be
[1:18:40] a revelation that he becomes you you're
[1:18:43] joint HS with Christ joint HS you're
[1:18:47] together everything that he possesses
[1:18:49] you
[1:18:51] possess thou shall make make no Covenant
[1:18:53] with them with their gods they shall not
[1:18:55] dwell in thy land lest they make uh they
[1:18:59] make the sin against me and that's what
[1:19:00] they did and if thou serve their gods
[1:19:03] ass surely will be a snare unto
[1:19:08] thee you know when you
[1:19:10] recognize who you are promises become
[1:19:14] different yes they become different when
[1:19:17] you have a full revelation of who you
[1:19:19] are in the
[1:19:21] word promises that God Made You just
[1:19:24] have a different look about them they
[1:19:26] have a different meaning yes sir faith
[1:19:29] when real Faith drops in
[1:19:31] here have you ever had the God just
[1:19:34] reveal something to you that you prayed
[1:19:37] for and prayed for and then God settled
[1:19:39] it in your
[1:19:41] heart God settles that in your heart and
[1:19:43] you have something in your heart that
[1:19:45] just grounds you in faith and you won't
[1:19:48] budge that's when you realize who you
[1:19:51] are that's when you realize that it's
[1:19:53] really not you anyway that's God's faith
[1:19:56] taken over that's God's faith that
[1:19:58] anchors
[1:20:00] it Jehovah
[1:20:03] Gyra you don't know what you own until
[1:20:06] you go looking through the
[1:20:08] Bible to find out the
[1:20:10] promises they'll keep you from them if
[1:20:13] they can but they're yours every promise
[1:20:16] is to Abraham and his seed after him
[1:20:18] every Divine promise in the word belongs
[1:20:20] to Abraham and his seed and you're an
[1:20:22] heir to it
[1:20:23] I like to look through see what I
[1:20:29] got you got it
[1:20:32] all I like to see what I got I like to
[1:20:34] see what belongs to me
[1:20:36] too and so many times you might have to
[1:20:38] remind the
[1:20:40] devil that's true you might have to
[1:20:42] remind the devil what belongs to you
[1:20:44] because sometimes he's got his dirty
[1:20:45] filthy hands all over it you might have
[1:20:47] to grab it back and tell him that
[1:20:50] belongs to me that don't belong to you
[1:20:52] that Joy belongs to me that peace
[1:20:55] belongs to me amen that wayward son or
[1:20:59] daughter belongs to
[1:21:02] me a well body belongs to me
[1:21:07] amen thank
[1:21:11] you I like to look it over I like to
[1:21:14] look through the Bible and see what
[1:21:15] belongs to me every Seed of Abraham
[1:21:18] ought to do that when you become Born
[1:21:21] Again filled with the spirit of God God
[1:21:22] and the Holy Spirit unto you you're an
[1:21:24] heir to every one of them promises you
[1:21:27] know I I was when you read that reading
[1:21:30] that that quote you know everything that
[1:21:33] and I had wrote down here children's
[1:21:35] bread healing was the children's bread
[1:21:36] and every time I I hear that phrased the
[1:21:39] children's bread I think of the saraph
[1:21:41] phenician woman which we spoke on her
[1:21:42] last time we was
[1:21:45] here it wasn't to
[1:21:49] her Jesus told her that's not for you
[1:21:53] she refused to accept
[1:21:55] that she refused to accept healing
[1:21:59] didn't belong to
[1:22:02] her Jesus told her no it's not yours I'm
[1:22:05] not giving it to you that
[1:22:07] belongs to the that's the children's
[1:22:11] bread like I said last time if God tells
[1:22:15] you
[1:22:16] no ask him
[1:22:19] again ask
[1:22:21] him God might be trying your faith come
[1:22:24] on what what what did he say here no Fai
[1:22:27] greater Faith have I seen in Israel than
[1:22:29] this woman even the crumbs that fall
[1:22:33] from the master's table I'll take a
[1:22:35] piece of that you don't want to give me
[1:22:37] the bread Lord give me a
[1:22:39] crumb just give me a crumb Lord just

[1:22:51] bit
[1:22:55] amen you have the right to Healing you

[1:23:00] Joy if you can't overcome small things
[1:23:02] in your life the little battles in your
[1:23:05] life if you can't overcome them because

[1:23:13] overcome your trials your test your
[1:23:16] besetting sins things in your life you
[1:23:18] know a lot of times when people would
[1:23:20] come up to get pray prayed for they
[1:23:22] would have things in their life and
[1:23:23] brother Brandon would would tell them

[1:23:40] hindrance there that's might be why you
[1:23:42] can't
[1:23:44] overcome that might be why you're not
[1:23:46] getting delivered because there's
[1:23:48] something between you and somebody else

[1:25:15] but you cannot have it until you fight
[1:25:17] for it you got to be willing to fight
[1:25:19] for
[1:25:20] it you got to be willing to lay aside
[1:25:23] everything that keeps you between you
[1:25:25] and God say God this is what you got to
[1:25:27] want it more than anything you got to
[1:25:29] have a
[1:25:31] desire and sometimes that's what keeps
[1:25:33] you from getting it is because we don't
[1:25:34] want it bad
[1:25:36] enough if we wanted something so bad we
[1:25:39] would let God deal deal with it instead
[1:25:41] of us doing it
[1:25:43] ourselves because so many times we try
[1:25:45] to do it ourselves and we make a bigger
[1:25:47] mess than it already is that's right
[1:25:49] when God says you have when when Prophet
[1:25:51] said you have to fight for it yes sir he
[1:25:54] didn't mean your human
[1:25:56] nature get on your knees and fight for
[1:25:58] it believe for it possess it it's yours
[1:26:02] claim it that's what he told the the the
[1:26:04] children of Israel everywhere your feet
[1:26:06] go wherever your feet step is is
[1:26:08] possession it belongs to
[1:26:10] you you can't step on in anything if
[1:26:12] you're not
[1:26:13] moving you can't possess anything if
[1:26:15] you're standing in one
[1:26:17] spot you got to start moving your
[1:26:19] boundaries out you know I might have
[1:26:21] told this
[1:26:23] here before years ago but brother Danny
[1:26:25] Williams most of y'all remember brother
[1:26:26] Danny
[1:26:27] Williams he come to our church in
[1:26:29] Kentucky one time and he's was preaching
[1:26:30] about boundaries setting boundaries and
[1:26:33] he would use the microphone stands I
[1:26:34] might have told this before he would
[1:26:35] take these and during his sermon he
[1:26:37] started with both microphone stands
[1:26:39] right here beside the pull Pit by the
[1:26:40] time he got done they were on the sides
[1:26:42] of the
[1:26:44] church he was talking about how clay the
[1:26:46] children of Israel God says wherever
[1:26:47] your footsteps go wherever you walk
[1:26:50] wherever you trod that belongs to you
[1:26:53] and he started making examples how you
[1:26:55] know you've got you've got joy in on the
[1:26:58] other side of that boundary and you
[1:26:59] haven't possessed it yet and you have to
[1:27:01] fight for it you've got to pick up that
[1:27:03] boundary and you've got to move it right
[1:27:06] amen you've got to set that boundary on
[1:27:08] the other side of Joy you've got to set
[1:27:11] it on the other side of Happiness of
[1:27:13] Peace you don't possess it unless you
[1:27:15] got a boundary marker on the other side
[1:27:16] of it it's not yours until you get your
[1:27:19] feet and you move and you walk to it
[1:27:21] healing is not yours until you place a
[1:27:23] boundary on the other side of
[1:27:25] it and that boundary Mark is is a
[1:27:29] Cornerstone of your
[1:27:32] property this is
[1:27:35] mine whenever they would put boundary
[1:27:37] markers they would put these tall Stone
[1:27:41] pillars and that sign signified that
[1:27:43] anything in
[1:27:45] between anything between these boundary
[1:27:47] markers belongs to
[1:27:49] me and if they saw something on the
[1:27:51] other side side of that that God gave
[1:27:53] them they would move that thing even
[1:27:56] further well God gave me that too I'm
[1:27:58] going to go get it God give me
[1:28:00] Deliverance I'm going to go get it God
[1:28:02] delivered me from depression he gave me
[1:28:04] peace I'm going to go get it God
[1:28:06] delivered me from anxiety I'm going to
[1:28:07] go get it you can stand in one spot all
[1:28:10] you want but you'll never possess
[1:28:12] anything when you're standing in one
[1:28:13] spot you'll never possess one one
[1:28:16] promise of God if you're not
[1:28:18] walking your feet have to stand on your
[1:28:21] promise
[1:28:27] sometimes you got to go
[1:28:29] stand on somebody else's promise to give
[1:28:32] them
[1:28:33] Faith you have to have faith for them
[1:28:36] they might not be able to
[1:28:37] walk they might be hurting so bad and
[1:28:40] grieving so bad they can't possess
[1:28:43] [Music]
[1:28:49] amen we got to possess what's ours
[1:28:53] you know I like that story about
[1:28:55] David David said I want to drink of
[1:28:58] water from that well in
[1:29:04] Bethlehem he didn't go possess
[1:29:07] it but as men said we'll go possess
[1:29:12] it sometimes you got to
[1:29:14] fight through a lot of demons for
[1:29:17] someone else yeah you have to
[1:29:20] fight we're in a battle right now for
[1:29:22] sister Erica amen we're in a battle
[1:29:25] we're going to get to the well we're
[1:29:27] going to bring her a drink of water
[1:29:30] amen you might have to kill a lot of
[1:29:32] demons on the way brother Jimmy you
[1:29:34] going to have to slay a lot of
[1:29:36] demons don't ever think that that fight
[1:29:38] for her is not
[1:29:41] yours we're all part of the Bride we are
[1:29:45] one body and we're fighting
[1:29:50] together
[1:29:56] I like I like Caleb in the Bible numbers
[1:29:59] 13 that amalekites dwell in the land of
[1:30:02] the South and the Hittites and the
[1:30:03] jebusites and the amorites dwell in the
[1:30:04] mountains and the Canaanites dwelt by
[1:30:06] the Sea and by the coast and Caleb steal
[1:30:08] the people before God and said let us go
[1:30:10] up at once and possess it for we are
[1:30:12] well able to overcome it but when the
[1:30:15] men went up with him we be not able to
[1:30:18] go against the people for they are
[1:30:19] stronger than we the men were looking at
[1:30:22] the doctor's
[1:30:25] report the men were looking at the trial
[1:30:29] they were looking at the test they were
[1:30:31] looking at the mountain and everything
[1:30:32] was on it Caleb was looking at the
[1:30:36] promise God said he could have it yes
[1:30:39] sir you can't you can't you you can't
[1:30:42] just God when God gives you a mountain
[1:30:44] he ain't going to say well the mountains
[1:30:46] I cleared it out off for you
[1:30:48] already there's nothing on it there's no
[1:30:51] no enemies on the Mountain all you got
[1:30:52] to do is go up there and build your
[1:30:53] house and live peacefully for the rest
[1:30:54] of your life God gives you a possession
[1:30:56] now he tells you to go get it you might
[1:30:58] have to fight for
[1:31:00] it does it belong to you absolutely it
[1:31:03] does cuz God said it
[1:31:06] does as Satan going to let you have it
[1:31:09] more than likely
[1:31:10] not so you're going to have to fight him
[1:31:13] every inch of that mountain you're going
[1:31:15] to have to
[1:31:16] fight you know I probably 8 nine 10
[1:31:20] years ago I did this sermon
[1:31:22] um climbing the right mountains
[1:31:25] sometimes it ain't speaking the
[1:31:26] mountains sometimes God puts that
[1:31:27] mountain there not so much as you can
[1:31:29] speak and have it removed and cast into
[1:31:30] the sea sometimes he puts it there so
[1:31:32] you'll climb it
[1:31:34] okay how you going to get stronger as a
[1:31:36] Christian if you're not fighting how you
[1:31:38] going to get stronger as a Christian if
[1:31:39] you're not if you're not climbing if
[1:31:41] you're not possessing the things that
[1:31:43] God's put in your life and says this is
[1:31:45] yours go get it yes sir what he told
[1:31:48] Caleb this Mountain's yours go get it
[1:31:50] had am malachit jebusites amorites some
[1:31:53] of the the the worst enemy in Canaan
[1:31:56] were on Caleb's
[1:31:59] Mountain Caleb says I'm more than
[1:32:02] able more than able let me have
[1:32:06] it he was excited to go he wanted to
[1:32:10] show them people on that mountain this
[1:32:11] is mine you can't have it not only am I
[1:32:14] going to move you off this mountain I'm
[1:32:16] going to move you off in a dead body I'm
[1:32:19] going to kill you I'm not going to leave

[1:32:46] there'll be no lust on it no pornography
[1:32:48] on it I'm going to clean it off yeah cuz
[1:32:52] God gave it to
[1:32:57] me but BR said question ansers 59 before
[1:33:00] there was a world you were in God's
[1:33:02] thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:33:04] because he knew you'd be wanting it God
[1:33:07] knew you want it before you knew you'd
[1:33:10] want it God knew you'd want
[1:33:14] it and he chose you himself because you
[1:33:18] desired he chose you in Christ before
[1:33:21] you or Jesus any of you was on the earth
[1:33:23] He sent Jesus die to prepare the way to
[1:33:26] send the Holy
[1:33:28] Ghost he knew you'd want the Holy
[1:33:31] Ghost he knew you'd want something to be
[1:33:34] able to fight
[1:33:35] with he knew you would have a
[1:33:38] desire and the prophet said he killed
[1:33:40] Jesus to make a way so you can have
[1:33:45] it does that ever hit us there's one
[1:33:49] place he said he murdered his own son
[1:33:53] why so you could have everything he
[1:33:56] had so you could possess everything that
[1:34:00] he
[1:34:03] possessed I'm going to move quickly
[1:34:12] here are we fighting for our
[1:34:15] kids are we fighting for our loved
[1:34:20] ones when you get to pray for your loved
[1:34:23] ones or your needs or whatever it
[1:34:25] is does Satan recognize
[1:34:30] you if you possess everything God
[1:34:33] does Satan knows who you are right if
[1:34:37] you
[1:34:39] don't if you don't you're you're in a
[1:34:41] tough
[1:34:42] battle because if you don't possess what
[1:34:44] he gave you if you haven't taken
[1:34:47] possession of that
[1:34:49] yet you're fighting on your own
[1:34:53] if you don't possess what he gave you in
[1:34:55] here you're fighting on your
[1:34:58] own you know look at the sons of St in

[1:35:31] knees all hell is totally
[1:35:34] confused they have no clue what to
[1:35:37] do yes sir because they're looking at
[1:35:39] the possession that you have in here
[1:35:42] they're looking at the power that you
[1:35:44] have in here they ain't looking at your
[1:35:46] flesh when God took his abod in here
[1:35:49] when you get down to pray and it's God
[1:35:51] speaking that's all satan sees is God
[1:35:55] speaking that's all he
[1:35:57] hears he cannot stand against the
[1:36:01] name it's in that name by all men are
[1:36:03] saved and it's in that name that he
[1:36:05] placed the Holy Ghost in you that's what
[1:36:08] lives in you that's what fights your
[1:36:10] battles that's what you possess that
[1:36:12] gives you everything that God that God
[1:36:14] has and when you get on your knees to
[1:36:16] pray you might be driving down the road

[1:36:41] that hell sees amen when you
[1:36:44] speak
[1:36:45] [Music]
[1:36:47] amen it's the power in here that moves
[1:36:50] cancer yes it's not the power in

[1:36:56] this is going to worry we're going to
[1:36:57] hear a bad report and you're going to
[1:36:59] it's just going to move you to sadness
[1:37:02] to fear to doubt to
[1:37:06] worry but when you possess that Holy
[1:37:09] Ghost and that fear and that doubt and
[1:37:12] worry forces you on your
[1:37:16] knees you can have fear and doubt and
[1:37:19] worry you might ought to have a chain
[1:37:20] around their neck and say I'm going to
[1:37:21] use

[1:37:27] going to call out to
[1:37:29] God you can't help human
[1:37:31] nature that's why this body is not

[1:39:47] said in Hebrews chapter 6
[1:39:52] it's got to be something happened by a
[1:39:53] birth which comes from God and God
[1:39:55] brings the new birth into you and gives
[1:39:57] you a part of
[1:39:59] himself then the these things are you

[1:40:09] one eternity we find out that you
[1:40:12] receive eternal life the word in the
[1:40:14] Greek is Zoe which means God's life and
[1:40:16] you receive part of God's life which
[1:40:18] makes you a spiritual Son of God you're
[1:40:21] just as Everlasting as God is
[1:40:26] Everlasting you have no end no place to

[1:40:39] earth you in an eternal thought of
[1:40:43] God you're you will be with God in
[1:40:46] through eternity you have no beginning
[1:40:47] and no ending hallu
[1:40:54] Abraham's
[1:40:55] seed your heir to it heir of Salvation
[1:40:59] heir of Divine Healing heir of every
[1:41:02] Redemptive blessing Jesus died for you
[1:41:04] are the heir to it for you are Abraham's
[1:41:07] seed you are the heir of the whole thing
[1:41:08] he says I feel religious knowing I'm an
[1:41:11] heir you may think I'm just a little
[1:41:14] crazy but if I am just leave me alone
[1:41:16] I'm more happier this way than I was the
[1:41:18] other way I like this way the best
[1:41:23] but I know that I'm heir of Salvation
[1:41:24] heir of every promise when you
[1:41:26] Pentecostal sing uh you sing every
[1:41:28] promise in the book is mine every
[1:41:30] chapter every verse every line then act
[1:41:32] like

[1:41:36] it if you said God delivered you show
[1:41:39] the
[1:41:42] fruits if you say you're a new person in
[1:41:44] Christ bear the fruits act like it
[1:41:49] right one of the first things you can
[1:41:51] tell if somebody gets the Holy Ghost is
[1:41:53] their love for other
[1:41:55] people love for other
[1:41:58] people you know don't don't uh think
[1:42:02] that when you get the Holy Ghost you
[1:42:03] still can't stand certain people makees
[1:42:05] sure you love
[1:42:08] everybody brother BR said when God's
[1:42:10] faith when God's faith drops in here
[1:42:12] when he that same quote when he said
[1:42:14] your faith will only go so far God's
[1:42:15] faith drops in so when you get that
[1:42:17] Faith he said it makes you love
[1:42:19] everybody he didn't say
[1:42:21] you can have healing that's where I
[1:42:23] thought he was going with it anything
[1:42:25] you want you can have but he didn't he
[1:42:26] said it makes you love
[1:42:31] everybody says then act like it walk
[1:42:33] around and see what see what you got in
[1:42:36] here it's all yours your heir to it so

[1:42:40] to you God gave it to you what a
[1:42:42] beautiful promise there let's Stand
[1:42:49] Together
[1:42:52] you know we still go back to the
[1:42:54] scripture in in James
[1:42:57] 4 you were fighting in a
[1:43:00] battle you know so many times we we try
[1:43:02] to take that battle on
[1:43:05] ourselves and then we we always recite
[1:43:07] that scripture resist the devil in to
[1:43:10] flee from
[1:43:11] you but first it says submit yourself to
[1:43:14] God you're not going to do much
[1:43:16] resisting until you've submitted
[1:43:17] yourself to
[1:43:18] God and when you submit yourself to God
[1:43:21] everything you need to resist the
[1:43:24] devil God's given you prise the Lord
[1:43:28] everything you need for for healing for
[1:43:32] deliverance resisting the devil in your
[1:43:35] flesh the Bible says he's a worthy
[1:43:37] worthy
[1:43:39] adversary he's a worthy
[1:43:41] adversary for this human
[1:43:44] flesh but against God he's no match and
[1:43:48] if you and God have become one amen
[1:43:51] there's no match amen the
[1:43:54] Lord let's bow our
[1:44:02] heads I know I jumped around a lot on
