[29:22] [Music]
[29:27] then I heard a little verse like this

[29:46] more but jesus whole anyway last man

[30:26] a little time Daniel may take 21 days
[30:29] but the very first day you prayed I
[30:30] heard your prayer praise be to God
[30:34] my understanding this events go to the
[30:35] Book of Psalms chapter 23 with me god
[30:38] bless you
[30:38] certainly an honor to be in the house
[30:40] Lord with you tonight three let's start
[30:47] with verse 1 we'll read down to verse 6
[30:50] and then we want to go to the Book of
[30:51] Revelation chapter 12
[30:53] just a little evangelistic thought
[30:55] tonight on our heart we'd like to give
[30:57] to you
[30:58] Psalms chapter 23 verse 1 of course it's
[31:01] been preached on read on many different
[31:03] times but maybe from a little different
[31:06] angle tonight the Lord to help us and
[31:08] he's glad to be in the house of God amen
[31:11] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[31:14] he maketh me to lie down in green
[31:18] pastures he leadeth me beside the still
[31:22] waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth
[31:28] me in the paths of righteousness for his
[31:30] name's sake and the scripture tells us
[31:32] that God's going to have a people for
[31:34] his namesake
[31:35] but yea though I walk through the valley
[31:38] of the shadow of death when there is no
[31:40] light I will not fear for thou art with
[31:44] me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[31:47] thou prepares a table before me in the
[31:51] presence of mine enemies thou anointest
[31:55] my head with oil and we should all be
[31:58] able to confess that my cup it surely
[32:02] runneth over
[32:03] for surely goodness and mercy shall
[32:05] follow me that word follow means to
[32:08] chase after
[32:09] hunting down until it acquires you and
[32:12] brings you back surely goodness and
[32:14] mercy will bring me back all the days of
[32:18] my life and I'm going to dwell in the
[32:20] house of the Lord forever
[32:22] Revelation chapter 12 verse 10 and 11 of
[32:26] course this is coming just before the
[32:29] Tribulation Period and I heard a loud
[32:32] voice saying in heaven now is come
[32:34] salvation and strength and the Kingdom
[32:37] of our God and the power of his Christ
[32:41] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[32:45] down which accused them before our God
[32:49] day and night and they overcame him by
[32:54] the blood of the Lamb and by the word of
[32:58] their testimony and they loved not their
[33:01] lives unto death I like to speak to you
[33:04] tonight at verse 5 of Psalms 23 and I
[33:07] just look at the anointed in the
[33:11] presence of your enemy anointed in the
[33:14] presence of your enemy let's just by our
[33:16] hearts Heavenly Father we are so
[33:19] thankful Lord to be gathered here in
[33:20] this place tonight Lord as we stand here
[33:24] we're asking that you would just come
[33:26] Lord and use us for your glory Lord you
[33:29] know every persons here you know every
[33:31] need that is represented among us
[33:33] tonight and we're asking that you would
[33:34] just come have Liberty in this place
[33:37] Lord we ask that the word would just
[33:39] come among us Lord may the light just
[33:41] drive the enemy from this place and Lord
[33:44] may you just have Liberty to be able to
[33:46] move upon our hearts and Lord we ask
[33:48] Lord that if something would be there
[33:50] Lord a need or whatever it might be and
[33:52] maybe it's a sickness we ask Lord that
[33:55] you would just move them those needs to
[33:57] not Lord might you take them from us we
[33:59] know that deliverance can come even by
[34:01] the preaching of the words for David
[34:03] said it Lord that you sent your word and
[34:05] healed them and we believe that too not
[34:07] Lord and we know that tonight that
[34:09] you're a present tense God and we
[34:10] believe that you're the same Lord we're
[34:12] not looking for some historical figure
[34:14] what we believe you're the same tonight
[34:16] may you come speak to us by your word
[34:19] Lord as we yield Lord in your presence
[34:21] nobility our own
[34:22] father but only what you would give us
[34:24] help us tonight as we look into your
[34:26] word and everybody said they may God
[34:28] bless you tonight you may have your
[34:30] seats for a few minutes we'll certainly
[34:31] try to not be before you very long we'll
[34:34] watch our time very closely I want to
[34:37] just start tonight and read as we read
[34:40] the book of Revelation how that the
[34:42] scripture is implying to us that they
[34:45] overcame by the blood of the Lamb and by
[34:47] the word of their testimony
[34:50] here according to John is telling us
[34:53] he's letting us know by prophecy for you
[34:57] and I that there's going to be a group
[34:59] of people who is absolutely going to
[35:01] overcome this age but he doesn't just
[35:04] tell us that there's going to be
[35:06] overcomers though we know that there is
[35:08] but he tells us what they're going to
[35:11] overcome and we know what they have to
[35:13] overcome is the same battle that you and
[35:16] I fought on a day-to-day basis we're
[35:19] fighting against the accuser of the
[35:20] Brethren and we know that even today
[35:23] that he is still the accuser but I have
[35:26] to say he can accuse but we have an
[35:29] atonement which has been made and that
[35:31] atonement stands between us and every
[35:33] accusation of the enemy and we know that
[35:36] he doesn't just tell us exactly not just
[35:39] that we're going to overcome he doesn't
[35:41] just tell us that that we're going to
[35:43] what we're going to overcome but he also
[35:44] tells us how we're going to overcome now
[35:48] it doesn't really matter what you face
[35:50] it doesn't really matter what you come
[35:52] against if you know how to overcome it
[35:55] doesn't matter really what you have to
[35:57] overcome if you know how to overcome and
[36:01] then John tells us how has the implies
[36:04] it to you and I'm we can look back upon
[36:06] that Scripture and John tells us that
[36:08] they had overcome him who the accuser of
[36:10] the Brethren they had overcome him by
[36:13] the blood of the Lamb and by the word of
[36:16] their testimony now we know that a
[36:19] testimony is it's a powerful thing to
[36:22] have a testimony we can look back even
[36:24] through the message and we can take many
[36:26] different quotes and so that even my
[36:28] testimony many times when persons
[36:30] testimony it's a key to somebody else's
[36:33] life they
[36:34] here a testimony that have God done that
[36:36] for them and they take that same key and
[36:38] they use that key upon their life that
[36:40] if God would move for the earth and he
[36:42] would have respect into that faith if
[36:43] you can apply that same kind of a faith
[36:45] that God's going to move on your behalf
[36:47] and many kinds of many of people they
[36:50] look to those type of testimonies to be
[36:52] able to bring confidence within God that
[36:54] if God's done it it not that that God
[36:56] can do it but that God's done it before
[36:58] and then God sent it to somebody that
[37:00] you know it continues to build your
[37:02] faith and so there's something about it
[37:04] testimony that means something to us
[37:06] because or something about it can have a
[37:08] tremendous effect the testimony can have
[37:11] an impact upon your life but that being
[37:12] said if a true testimony of a true
[37:15] witness can have at an impact upon our
[37:18] life what about a negative testimony a
[37:20] negative testimony that would be around
[37:23] us now but our picks this thought up in
[37:25] the in the in the Psalms 23 and he's
[37:27] quoting verse 5
[37:28] and he said oh how marvelous it is he
[37:31] said that this Shepherd knows beginning
[37:33] and ending Gentile dispensation
[37:34] he said no wonder David said that the
[37:36] Lord is my shepherd watch David begin to
[37:39] testify he said the Lord is my shepherd
[37:42] I shall not want how he leads us beside
[37:45] the still waters and he restores my soul
[37:48] and our enraged are cuts over and he
[37:51] anoints us in the presence of our enemy
[37:54] did you ever get anointed in the
[37:56] presence of your enemy just to testify
[37:59] what's what it means just to testify to
[38:02] feel your cut just bowled over you know
[38:05] and you just how marvelous it is to be
[38:09] anointed in the presence of your enemy
[38:12] so being anointed gives us a testimony
[38:15] in this testimony is it so for that our
[38:18] lives are so full of what God has done
[38:20] we've been left with that excuse but he
[38:23] tells us that there's so much good
[38:25] things of God that he's done for us that
[38:27] simply our cup begins to run over now we
[38:30] know that's because God's provided these
[38:33] things and God has showed himself on our
[38:35] behalf maybe cos he's been so merciful
[38:37] to us but you realize down through
[38:40] biblical history you'll find that not
[38:42] everybody even though that was around
[38:44] the message of the hour those
[38:46] been enlightened to the truth even those
[38:48] that had been witnessed even delivered
[38:50] and seen great miracles and not always
[38:52] kept a positive testimony and we can
[38:55] look back and look at the top and see
[38:57] how that whenever the children of Israel
[38:59] had had come out of Egypt and then they
[39:01] come from the Red Sea or many of the
[39:02] people I think I do great things
[39:05] but did they come down to the wilderness
[39:07] so they come to a place of tennis Barnea
[39:09] and it caters for Nia there's going to
[39:11] be a lot of wasted years in California
[39:14] and I have to say I've wasted some years
[39:16] in caters for Nia and if you was honest
[39:18] you could say that you've wasted some
[39:20] years at caters for Nia
[39:22] but then sooner or later God's divine
[39:24] order begins to come upon our lives
[39:27] and somewhere along the line somebody
[39:29] says it's time to quit circling this
[39:31] mountain
[39:31] we've got to turn northward and get on
[39:33] to that promise I don't know about you
[39:35] but that's exactly what this message has
[39:37] done for us we had circled the mountain
[39:40] for a lot of years a lot of people had
[39:42] circled the message for a lot of years
[39:43] but eventually the revelation the son of
[39:46] man and the opening of the seals in the
[39:48] book coming open and a mighty angel
[39:49] descending it begins to protect our
[39:52] forces but more than just caters for Nia
[39:54] we begin to turn northward to find out
[39:57] what promises lays within it for a long
[39:59] time we rallied around Moses and my
[40:01] Moses had done a lot of great things
[40:03] that were thankful for that but there
[40:05] come a time that we had to move from the
[40:07] messenger to his message and realize
[40:09] he's trying to get us to have other
[40:11] experience with God to bring our feet to
[40:13] a higher plateau to bring us her house
[40:16] table and what we ever had been before
[40:18] now here they come back to us and I
[40:21] spent 40 years since on our forty years
[40:23] since our is see 40 years since God done
[40:26] these things and now they begin to look
[40:28] around and many people they start
[40:29] getting bored and they begin to look to
[40:31] other paints and people has in their
[40:33] mind well why don't we just go back to
[40:35] Egypt it really wasn't that bad neva it
[40:37] really wasn't that bad all I they pennis
[40:40] it was nice yeah we took a beating every
[40:42] now in the end yeah it was hard every
[40:44] now and then you see when deliverance
[40:46] cuz if we're not careful our minds begin
[40:49] to project that until thinkin that that
[40:51] was a custom Ozone paralyzed when it
[40:53] wasn't it was
[40:54] more than mortgage they cap immensely
[40:57] but I would have taken us God got some
[40:59] people who are not going back to Angel
[41:01] they don't have it on their mind to go
[41:03] back to Egypt
[41:04] we've got people who's ready tomorrow
[41:06] and we're going to take every promise of
[41:09] the land that belongs to us hallelujah
[41:13] now we come to caters for Nia and the
[41:16] people had gotten to the place where
[41:18] they are wondering about this land and
[41:20] they begin to think is the land really
[41:23] there is the land really true Dharma is
[41:26] the promises that Moses the prophet has
[41:29] made is these promises are they are they
[41:32] are they valid are they true and so they
[41:35] begin to wonder and always when time
[41:38] comes give a little time between the
[41:41] promise and fulfillment that's when
[41:43] people begin to wonder the time between
[41:46] the prophecy and the fulfillment of that
[41:48] prophecy is where people's minds begin
[41:51] to get last and they begin to go back
[41:53] and do things that you start to do and
[41:55] their eye begins to go back in before
[41:57] law slavery starts looking good before
[42:00] long go whip up the old past master
[42:02] begins to look do it hey Rose Horner's
[42:05] begin to look good but brother if you've
[42:07] got the spirit of pain of opponent you
[42:09] can we ain't going back under that
[42:11] dictatorship we've been under that old
[42:13] shoes for the better prolong time but we
[42:16] endured back to his ways how easy it is
[42:22] for spirits begin to roam around us and
[42:25] people begin to wonder and unbelief
[42:28] begins to stir because Satan's never
[42:31] going to leave you alone
[42:33] Satan's never going to quit bitin they'd
[42:36] never going to quit accusing you until
[42:39] he's passed into the lake of fire he
[42:41] stands before the Father day and night
[42:43] oh I don't know about you but I'm glad
[42:45] I've been through the red atonement I'm
[42:47] glad I post over that Red Sea I'm glad
[42:50] I've got something standing between me
[42:52] how about you tonight
[42:54] now they begin to wonder if the promise
[42:57] was really there Moses is going to send
[43:00] spies into the land so that the people
[43:04] to have an evidence that the land is
[43:07] there but remember for you in our faith
[43:12] is the substance of things hoped for I
[43:18] don't have to have listen friend I don't
[43:20] have to have the loaf of bread as long
[43:23] as I got the quarters because the
[43:25] quarter is just as good as the loaf of
[43:28] bread and faith is as it were but I need
[43:31] something tangible I need something I
[43:33] can put my feet on well you do got
[43:35] something you've got paid don't you
[43:37] realize abrin tells us the first person
[43:39] to believe God's Word was God himself he
[43:42] said let there be light but if he
[43:44] believed his old Worth and life come
[43:47] into existence why he stood on this pay
[43:50] pay every son and daughter iPods with a
[43:52] standoff we must stand my faith tonight
[43:55] oh yeah now here they come and God's
[44:01] going to send them into the land and he
[44:04] tells these Mia because it happens to be
[44:07] the time of the ripening of the fruit
[44:12] Jory's it happens to be the hour of
[44:16] fruit coming to harvest and he tells in
[44:21] this picture going into the land the
[44:23] grapes are coming to harvest they should
[44:26] be rotting on hell I want you to take
[44:28] and cut down a cluster of these grapes
[44:31] and I want you to bring an evidence back
[44:33] from the land so these 12 spies as they
[44:37] choose out one from each of these men
[44:39] that goes over but here's the problem
[44:41] every man that's going into the land is
[44:44] not looking to the eyes approach every
[44:48] man that is going into the land does not
[44:51] have eyes a face so when they get there
[44:54] they cannot deny that what the prophet
[44:57] has already said I hope you hear me
[44:58] tonight what the prophet has all
[45:00] blow us up what the prophet has already
[45:02] said lady in the land man it doesn't
[45:06] matter what they look like yes I had a
[45:08] negative confession it didn't matter
[45:10] what they look like God's promise was
[45:12] true and the Prophet message was true
[45:16] they come into the valley of s cool and
[45:19] there they find these grapes and because
[45:23] the Prophet is warmer than evidence
[45:25] hallelujah they cut down these grapes
[45:28] and they put the staff in between it in
[45:30] so much wear to me of the Bible says has
[45:33] to pass them back now they're under the
[45:38] load of the grapes they got the grapes
[45:41] over their shoulders they feel the
[45:44] weight of the grapes they feel the
[45:46] weight of the prophecy they feel the
[45:48] weight of what Moses has said I was in
[45:50] sit at the Landers for with new can
[45:52] honey and now they're under the load
[45:54] carrying back to promise back to the
[45:56] children of Israel don't you see when
[45:58] you pack this word today we are under
[46:01] the load of the word I caught we are
[46:03] under the load of opposites we're in it
[46:05] back as evidence they get a pretty good
[46:15] spectrum of what ladies in the land but
[46:18] all Caleb and Joshua has on their mind
[46:20] is war belongs to them they're tired of
[46:25] talking about a gospel they're tired
[46:27] talking about a job it was their partner
[46:30] talking about it God it used to be they
[46:32] are ready to achieve the promise but I
[46:35] don't know about you I do not want to be
[46:38] stuck in haters fornia I want to make
[46:40] sure I've got my eyes with the promise
[46:43] of God I am not satisfied in the desert
[46:46] I am not satisfied out here I'm not
[46:48] satisfied being a desert baby I want to
[46:51] be a child of Canaan I want to be the
[46:53] children of God children of promise
[46:55] who's able to march into the land
[46:58] ever got given right there belongs to me
[47:00] [Applause]
[47:06] these men passed these grapes back how
[47:12] can imagine if they come walking back
[47:15] into the camp no doubt the minds of the
[47:18] people wondering is it true what has
[47:20] been said until they see these two men
[47:23] with the staves over their cellars
[47:26] packing back these great big old grapes
[47:30] their men
[47:31] now maybe some of the same people who
[47:35] had talked about how nice it would be to
[47:38] go back and have you brought it out here
[47:40] into this desert to die maybe as they
[47:43] begin to look at them grapes they can
[47:45] manage them grapes look good I mean
[47:47] their breaks was pretty good I'd like to
[47:49] have one of them rate I'm is just one of
[47:51] would be me and my whole family and my
[47:53] uncle my great-great uncle it Pete
[47:56] everybody my families I just have one of
[47:57] them well why would you want to sit
[48:01] around and enjoy the blessings of God
[48:03] just with one grapes when you've got a
[48:07] promise that all of them belongs to you
[48:09] why would we want to sit around the
[48:11] message and just take pieces and parts
[48:13] of it when God has promised at the land
[48:16] that is full of them where you can build
[48:18] your house right the size a very harvest
[48:21] for the great and not only you all
[48:23] listen Prius but every son and daughter
[48:25] of God can enjoy the benefits of the
[48:27] land I do not want to be guilty but just
[48:30] hanging around the promises I want to
[48:32] testimony within me that not only in
[48:35] those grace goods but I'm going to get
[48:37] my own bit you're going days you come
[48:44] back here often is already total by the
[48:47] words nobody said if the land is good
[48:50] but now we're going to have a testimony
[48:54] service
[48:57] testimony services can't just be real
[49:00] good now I was raised up in a smaller
[49:02] church and we had popcorn services but
[49:06] people was able to testify we start
[49:08] testifying this building tonight will be
[49:09] here the same time next week but it
[49:13] always amazed me the testimony service
[49:15] that when you call on people's names
[49:18] sometimes they just freeze up they just
[49:22] lock up but you let people volunteer to
[49:26] testify and you let somebody start
[49:29] testify about what God did for them that
[49:32] testimony triggers a positive response
[49:35] in the mind of others come on somebody
[49:38] and he begins to remind them that God
[49:41] did something similar for me he almost
[49:43] did the very same thing for me and
[49:45] before long that positive testimony has
[49:47] attracted another positive testimony and
[49:50] the fire begins to spread through the
[49:51] church and compile and you got yourself
[49:53] search going on no doubt Moses is
[50:01] expecting these men to say something
[50:04] good he was expecting the Prophet listen
[50:07] Moses had no doubt were laid in the land
[50:10] Moses didn't wonder what was running in
[50:13] the land it was those who had unbelief
[50:15] on their hearts was wondering what's in
[50:17] the land Moses had already said that not
[50:21] only are they going to have a testimony
[50:25] service they've got the spoken word of
[50:28] Moses but now not only do they have the
[50:33] spoken word of Moses they got the
[50:36] manifested words of Moses
[50:40] they've got physical evidence that the
[50:44] land is good they've never seen graves
[50:47] like this in it in each of you know why
[50:49] they can't grow grapes like this in
[50:51] Egypt Greylock death only flows in the
[50:55] land of promise
[50:57] so not only do they have the spoken word
[50:59] they are standing upon the manifested
[51:02] word of their day he's expecting
[51:09] testimonies of joy he's expecting to
[51:12] hear testimonies of milk and honey
[51:15] testimony of power testimonies of
[51:17] overcoming expecting to hear great
[51:20] things that God has done the people has
[51:23] gotten doubt in their hearts don't have
[51:25] ears to hear what the Spirit is saying
[51:29] it is some of the preachers that come
[51:33] around the message they begin to fall
[51:36] back light on their own hearts they met
[51:40] somebody and they're not convinced and
[51:43] that means they're not concerned and
[51:45] because they're not convinced and
[51:46] concern they're not looking at the
[51:47] positive God's word all they can see is
[51:49] how big this any time how big the walls
[51:52] are helping the Giants on how big the
[51:54] chariots are they are not looking what
[51:56] the pump is there to look at and so here
[51:58] they come back and fill up more matter
[52:00] than Hornets they come in there they are
[52:02] so discouraged they are so down pull out
[52:10] their hankies like it's a funeral
[52:14] because they fit they fail to recognize
[52:18] what the Prophet had already said I said
[52:22] they failed to catch the revelation of
[52:24] the land they went there with unbelief
[52:27] in their hearts and because of unbelief
[52:30] being in their heart the unbelief in
[52:32] their heart has limited their vision to
[52:35] the promises of God's Word don't you see
[52:38] when you read the word day in and day
[52:40] out
[52:40] if there is an unbelieving your heart
[52:42] somewhere it will limit you from seeing
[52:45] the promises of God that belongs to you
[52:47] as a child of God if we are reading all
[52:49] that we must read it by faith we must
[52:52] read it by believing God's word that
[52:54] that promise belongs to me it may not
[52:56] just be my brother or my sister
[52:58] but it's me O Lord standing in the
[53:01] prayer that promise is a personal
[53:03] promise to me we come back and they get
[53:09] a negative testimony and their fix they
[53:11] have a testimony service I failed to
[53:15] recognize what Moses had been doing
[53:18] which was established in a relationship
[53:21] between them and God again I said he was
[53:25] restoring the relationship a man Church
[53:29] he's restoring the relationship that
[53:32] Abraham had had with God baby all my
[53:35] Moses was resembling the relationship
[53:38] between them and God again because they
[53:40] didn't have the right kind of
[53:41] relationship in Egypt and you can't have
[53:44] the right kind relationship and even you
[53:46] can't tell me these people that live in
[53:48] Egypt in our part of Asia or feeding on
[53:50] the same thing that you and I are
[53:52] feeding on that's not the right kind of
[53:54] fellowship that's not the right kind of
[53:56] worship but brother you get out here in
[53:57] the land and you start taking your feet
[53:59] up and putting them down but the promise
[54:01] of God's Word that's real testimony to
[54:04] me hallelujah he wants us to know him he
[54:12] wants us to know him not in just sermon
[54:15] form not in just past reform not in just
[54:19] book form not in just hate form he wants
[54:23] us to know him in a living reality he
[54:26] wants us to recognize he's not a God of
[54:28] just yesterday he's the same God right
[54:31] now don't you see princess what Moses
[54:33] his ministry was to do was to bring the
[54:35] people back to a personal relationship
[54:37] with God
[54:38] [Music]
[54:42] that's why I say attach this message
[54:45] that's why you text the validity of this
[54:47] message that's why I attach the promises
[54:50] of this message amen I had been anointed

[58:42] I needed to see when I seen how big
[58:45] Jericho was that was it just something
[58:47] up in my mind when I seen the size of
[58:49] the walls were big enough to have
[58:50] chariot races around the top of it that
[58:52] summed it all up in my mind I thought we
[58:54] might as well find somewhere else to go
[58:55] in because it's ain't core to work you

[59:03] thing around this message and you're

[1:07:19] something fearful oh I seen something
[1:07:22] fearless well you have to admit we need
[1:07:28] a little bit more than this message to
[1:07:30] do it don't worry now everything I had
[1:07:32] needed lays right in this message but we
[1:07:35] need more than the Bible all know
[1:07:37] everything I need is right here don't
[1:07:40] you see what these men are doing for
[1:07:42] planting seeds in the minds of these
[1:07:46] other people their testimony is so
[1:07:49] negative that a negative testimony will
[1:07:52] impact your life the prophet calls them
[1:07:57] borderline believers they had enough
[1:08:00] faith to get to the border but they
[1:08:01] could not go over I want never to be
[1:08:04] found guilty of being a borderlines
[1:08:07] believer I know he got a lot of them
[1:08:11] around the message but I don't want to
[1:08:13] be one the Evangelist is just trying to
[1:08:18] pull out of me about borderline things
[1:08:21] god help me but I say we got rights this
[1:08:28] message is more than enough matter of
[1:08:31] fact I don't need 49 to 65
[1:08:35] just give me one quote
[1:08:38] well that's all David needed to fight a
[1:08:41] giant I don't need 5,000 scriptures so
[1:08:46] he given to me I'll need a hundred
[1:08:48] thousand posts will he give it to us
[1:08:49] all I need is warm hey man when you
[1:08:53] recognize this messages eagle food when
[1:08:56] the bride recognizes who she is near the
[1:08:59] rapture is going to go brother we have
[1:09:01] got God his confident in his word he's
[1:09:04] confident in what he's promised he's
[1:09:06] confident in his blessings
[1:09:09] [Applause]
[1:09:12] but sometimes we look at our enemy
[1:09:17] completely different than what our enemy
[1:09:19] looks at us look at tonight we can break
[1:09:23] into the enemy's camp and find out what
[1:09:26] the enemy has to say about children of
[1:09:28] promise it may change our thinking a
[1:09:31] little bit I like to go across Jordan I
[1:09:35] like to go behind the laws of this great
[1:09:39] city called Jericho and the Bible says
[1:09:43] in John 4 to 8
[1:09:45] before they were lay down she came up to
[1:09:48] them on the roof
[1:09:49] speaking about Rahab she said to them I
[1:09:53] know what some of those folks over there
[1:09:57] across the way needs to the left I know
[1:10:00] that the Lord has given you the land she
[1:10:07] ain't been around the message of two
[1:10:08] days and she's got more revelation and
[1:10:11] most of them
[1:10:12] oh yeah I've heard it ever since I was a
[1:10:18] kid preacher sellout when I was really a
[1:10:20] kid preacher 17 you know what's wrong
[1:10:22] with these young whippersnappers coming

[1:10:41] waiting I don't care if you minute in 10
[1:10:44] years 20 years 50 years the gospel
[1:10:47] revelation is not waiting a minute or a
[1:10:49] minute coming into the message in two
[1:10:51] years no more and some people never
[1:10:53] heard it 30 get me so more leave here
[1:11:01] Lord I know the Lord's giving you the
[1:11:05] land and that's your terror has fallen
[1:11:07] on us and then all the inhabitants of
[1:11:10] the land are throwing birthday parties
[1:11:16] they got balloons and little hats and
[1:11:18] little if you listen to these negative
[1:11:25] testimonies that's the way it looks the
[1:11:29] inhabitants of the land not just the
[1:11:31] finish
[1:11:32] not just the city she's heard some
[1:11:36] rumors that the inhabitants of the land
[1:11:40] faint because and you thought that you
[1:11:47] was just another message believe worship
[1:11:50] if you thought she was just another
[1:11:52] person's will come and sit on the pews
[1:11:53] and then go back home you didn't realize
[1:11:56] the inhabitants of the land are scared
[1:12:03] how do you know this one but we have
[1:12:07] hired and faith cometh by we have hired
[1:12:12] and how the Lord dried up part of the
[1:12:15] Red Sea for you when you came out of
[1:12:16] Egypt I love it when they start quoting
[1:12:20] our history
[1:12:21] [Applause]
[1:12:23] now listen most of these peoples was
[1:12:27] born right out there in that desert they
[1:12:30] were desert babies they've been raised
[1:12:33] around the message hey my dad heard
[1:12:38] babies but because they're falling the
[1:12:41] same pillar fire in the same cloud their
[1:12:44] identification runs back before their
[1:12:47] birth
[1:12:48] [Applause]
[1:12:54] that's good I said my identification run
[1:12:59] my previous Oh God my testimony runs
[1:13:02] previous to my birth it's because I am
[1:13:05] identified with this method I'm identify
[1:13:08] with all it is how identified in all of
[1:13:10] its glory we had heard how the Lord
[1:13:16] comes lo Rd try that the one of the Red
[1:13:18] Sea for you when you come out of Egypt
[1:13:19] and what you did why you here
[1:13:24] God did it but they're getting the
[1:13:27] credit that would help us right there
[1:13:32] the next devil you fight God's going to
[1:13:35] do it come on somebody he's just going
[1:13:37] to you use her to the through he needs a
[1:13:39] hand he needs you feet he need eyes what
[1:13:46] you did in two - two kings of the a
[1:13:47] mirage that were on the other side of
[1:13:49] Jordans
[1:13:50] he said sound and all whom you utterly
[1:13:53] destroyed I love to give you that
[1:13:56] definition is just too good verse 11 and
[1:13:59] as soon as we heard these things our
[1:14:03] hearts melted hot butter on a hot fire
[1:14:09] you see just milk
[1:14:20] and so much neither did that remain any
[1:14:23] more courage in any man because because
[1:14:29] I hope this helps you tonight because
[1:14:34] for the Lord your God amen my cup
[1:14:43] runneth over right now hang on for the
[1:14:46] larger God He is God in heaven above and
[1:14:52] in in now nurse a nurse but I'm gonna
[1:15:07] need a little bit more I'm glad you
[1:15:08] asked
[1:15:09] Joshua 5:1 they came to pass one of the
[1:15:12] kings of the am rats were thrown this
[1:15:13] side of Jordan westward all the kings of
[1:15:15] the cane that's which we're about to see
[1:15:17] hurt that the Lord had dried up the
[1:15:20] waters of Jordan from before the
[1:15:21] children of Israel until until we were
[1:15:26] passed over their heart did not neither
[1:15:32] was there any spirit in them anymore
[1:15:35] because think about it because of the
[1:15:42] children
[1:15:47] just was six one their first battle and
[1:15:52] Jericho was straightly shut up because
[1:15:55] of the children of Israel none went out
[1:15:58] and none came in they locked the doors
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:05] remember on the cartoons years ago when
[1:16:08] they would lock a door they locked they
[1:16:14] kept they have flat locks the door I'm
[1:16:19] talking about they put boards on it they
[1:16:21] nailed it shut they put the dresser
[1:16:23] against it they put the refrigerator you
[1:16:25] see they put the stove against that we
[1:16:26] want nobody coming through these doors
[1:16:28] and the puppet said the reason why is
[1:16:31] because they felt like they would secure
[1:16:32] behind their loss mother walls can't
[1:16:35] keep you from the hand to God I've got
[1:16:37] to walk through walls he can walk
[1:16:39] through soul a man he can walk no one
[1:16:41] writes about our gods scared to death
[1:16:49] Israel but will you listen to this
[1:16:53] testimony service this don't match up
[1:16:57] unless you get some believers among Jews
[1:17:02] and all I can say is these believers was
[1:17:05] carrying the whole bunch in it's sad
[1:17:08] when a few people's got to carry a whole
[1:17:10] church wouldn't it be said that a Donny
[1:17:13] Reagan had to carry this whole church
[1:17:15] come on somebody he our refusal let him
[1:17:19] preach by herself I refuse to just sit
[1:17:22] and be a watcher in a gator I'm called
[1:17:24] to be a participator
[1:17:26] I am here to get something from God and
[1:17:29] ain't nothing standing in my way oh let
[1:17:31] me just tell you I wanna pull from what
[1:17:33] I got need
[1:17:35] in this place 50 headed if Donny Reagan
[1:17:37] hola can we gonna pull his gas out
[1:17:45] shouldn't that be the way it is when a
[1:17:47] man of God stands behind the pulpit you
[1:17:49] you ain't standing between me and my
[1:17:51] promise brother you might as well get
[1:17:53] ready I'm getting what I have need of
[1:17:56] [Applause]
[1:17:59] these people are scared to death of
[1:18:02] interest because they had heard what
[1:18:05] your hova had done I love you they'd
[1:18:07] heard how god it opened up earthly they
[1:18:09] heard how God had fought kings and Kings
[1:18:12] had been demolished and trampled under
[1:18:14] their feet so they locked the door both
[1:18:20] ladies if I could just know that the
[1:18:23] devil looks at me that way it would
[1:18:24] really help me it just so happened I
[1:18:29] found a quote for you if you can see to
[1:18:34] the eyes of this testimony
[1:18:37] perhaps this Jesus cost the same not
[1:18:40] with I believe don't like this that the
[1:18:43] devil tramples when the weakest of
[1:18:48] thanks goes to their knees and I'll put
[1:18:51] my name right there for most of the time
[1:18:54] but I am a saint no oh no I'm not a
[1:19:01] sinner I was one not now what a power
[1:19:07] and privilege has been given to the
[1:19:08] Church of the Living God
[1:19:10] when you fall to your knees in prayer
[1:19:12] even the Devils tremble to the weakest
[1:19:15] of the only they're scared to death
[1:19:18] because they heard what God was doing
[1:19:21] they hear that God can clear the way no
[1:19:24] matter how big the opposition is they
[1:19:26] heard that God can feed them when there
[1:19:28] was no food nowhere around out a mill of
[1:19:30] a desert
[1:19:31] they heard that God fed them
[1:19:33] miraculously they heard that their
[1:19:36] clothes and never wore out and they
[1:19:40] heard that no enemy can stand before
[1:19:42] them
[1:19:43] I've got ahold of that tonight amen and
[1:19:47] we as the Church of the Living God has
[1:19:49] got the same thing right in the presence
[1:19:52] of your enemy the enemy has to testify
[1:19:55] that God is with you there's things that
[1:19:58] he cannot even figure out that he has to
[1:20:01] say God has to be with them you may not
[1:20:04] realize it but you are recognized in him
[1:20:09] you are recognized in health program
[1:20:13] says let alone in the other night they
[1:20:16] was talking about here from the may hope
[1:20:18] so completely go that she was laying on
[1:20:22] a stretcher and the Holy Spirit got
[1:20:25] ahold of her and healed her right there
[1:20:28] she got up and was so happy she couldn't
[1:20:34] even sleep all night when the Mayo
[1:20:37] Clinic had given her up just a few
[1:20:38] nights ago what is that
[1:20:42] that's yielding and this man when he
[1:20:45] seen Jesus coming perhaps the devil tore
[1:20:48] his my to run out there and to get Jesus
[1:20:51] because no one could pass by but when
[1:20:53] the demon got close to the Lord Jesus
[1:20:55] Christ he recognized who it was now say
[1:21:01] they don't recognize you because they do
[1:21:08] they do do you believe that Devils
[1:21:12] recognize Christians man these folks
[1:21:20] behind the walls and recognized and your
[1:21:24] enemy recognizes who you are sometimes
[1:21:28] it takes somebody God give us somebody
[1:21:32] who can stand in the midst and be a
[1:21:35] voice against all others and it takes
[1:21:38] place
[1:21:38] if we have to stand let us stand David's
[1:21:45] a man that knew something about fighting
[1:21:46] battles he knew what it was to go
[1:21:47] through hard trials David would have
[1:21:49] been killed immediate hurts but David in
[1:21:54] Psalm 23 wrote some powerful words the
[1:21:59] David would have to recognize my
[1:22:01] testimony but he begin to confess and he
[1:22:04] said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[1:22:09] want he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:22:12] pastures he leadeth me beside still
[1:22:15] waters the psalmist is letting us know
[1:22:17] that he like a sheep
[1:22:19] the Lord has condescended and he's
[1:22:23] become my shepherd David has recognized
[1:22:27] the condensation of God to be a shepherd
[1:22:29] over every sheep David is telling us
[1:22:32] think of that David had been exiled and
[1:22:35] David represents Israel did you know one
[1:22:39] man can represent a whole church
[1:22:40] [Music]
[1:22:42] did you know one man in battle can
[1:22:44] represent a whole nation whenever when
[1:22:46] David went to fight a lot he was one man
[1:22:48] but if David overcome every time Israel
[1:22:51] overcome with David because what person
[1:22:53] can represent everybody else one person
[1:22:56] can top everybody else and David said
[1:23:00] the Lord is my shepherd yes what could
[1:23:03] say the Lord is our Shepherd for Israel
[1:23:08] had been bound in Babylonian captivity
[1:23:10] preached somebody and one man like David
[1:23:14] represents all of Israel and as the
[1:23:17] Israel was in Babylon they got let out
[1:23:20] and they could say the Lord is my
[1:23:22] shepherd think about it
[1:23:26] then verse 3/5 not only have they come
[1:23:31] out of her
[1:23:33] they got restored for David said he
[1:23:37] restoreth my soul he lead him in the
[1:23:40] path of righteousness for his name's
[1:23:42] sake in other words God has brought me
[1:23:46] back from the grave he's brought me back
[1:23:49] to life many a days I should have been
[1:23:51] gold should have been way
[1:23:52] so the way but he took my soul and he
[1:23:55] raised me up and he kept me I should
[1:23:59] have been cast down I should have been
[1:24:00] destroyed that he restored me back he's
[1:24:04] letting me know God is a restorer of the
[1:24:07] dead can you say the same thing tonight
[1:24:11] David say yea though I walk through the
[1:24:13] valley of the shadow now remember they
[1:24:15] can't be a shadow less there's a lot
[1:24:18] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:24:20] shadow of death I don't have to fear
[1:24:23] nothing though I walk beside Jericho I
[1:24:26] have nothing to fear though I walk among
[1:24:28] Giants I have nothing to fear no I
[1:24:30] walked through layana's here I have
[1:24:32] nothing to fear because thou art with me
[1:24:38] hallelujah David is telling us he's a
[1:24:41] present it's God with me right now that
[1:24:44] no matter what our through he's a
[1:24:46] present-tense god man look what
[1:24:51] deliverance has done for the testimony
[1:24:53] of David if he can keep me in the valley
[1:24:56] if he can keep me in despair if he can
[1:24:58] keep me in trouble tell me what he can't
[1:25:00] keep me from if he can keep me from
[1:25:02] those pain he's kept me from death tell
[1:25:04] me why my God can't do if you got the
[1:25:10] Holy Ghost you possess the same shepherd
[1:25:13] David did and therefore I will not fear
[1:25:16] for thou art with me and then David
[1:25:20] comes to this you told my partner
[1:25:22] because thou prepares to a table before
[1:25:26] me in the presence of mine enemies
[1:25:30] I like that he's topping this table with
[1:25:35] a feast and David is telling them this
[1:25:40] ain't no ordinary meal this is a feast
[1:25:44] he's brought me out he kept me he's
[1:25:48] raised me for his namesake he's restored
[1:25:50] me amen
[1:25:51] and then he's put a banqueting table in
[1:25:54] front of me I'm sitting at the feast of
[1:25:56] our God
[1:25:58] Prison ain't just some little meal
[1:26:00] something's just got pulled together
[1:26:01] it ain't some little piece of food this
[1:26:03] ain't mac knodel troffers this is a
[1:26:06] piece for king of beasts fit for a king
[1:26:12] may I say to you tonight God has not
[1:26:16] given the bride just a little bread and
[1:26:18] water to make it for next week and maybe
[1:26:19] the next week and maybe the next month
[1:26:22] we've not been just given enough to
[1:26:24] survive we've said it a feast he's
[1:26:29] prepared before me a feast from 49 to 65
[1:26:35] he set before me on this table a feast
[1:26:39] row after row after row of heavenly
[1:26:42] delights of reveal words sent from
[1:26:44] Almighty God himself he has sent me
[1:26:47] heavenly the last and so I can feed upon
[1:26:49] and I can take him when I begin to eat
[1:26:51] my strength comes back yes I've had to
[1:26:54] fight but I got enough food to restore
[1:26:56] my straight back and notice where it's
[1:27:01] all happening at not in the presence at
[1:27:05] the enemy so the enemy could just sit on
[1:27:08] the outskirt lord who needs that much
[1:27:12] food anyway who really needs all that I
[1:27:17] do what some other is going to go away
[1:27:21] that's a good he wants to make sure I
[1:27:23] got funny ways are you kidding me
[1:27:26] this is the manna that under this iconic
[1:27:28] lorry it's just as good in 49 and it is
[1:27:31] it's what he is giving me he'll be the
[1:27:33] same good as funny in 80 because it's
[1:27:36] under the Secada light but in front of
[1:27:42] your enemies you're eating feast feast
[1:27:47] brings laughter face was a cup of a
[1:27:51] celebration
[1:27:53] remember year after they come out of eat
[1:27:55] that they held the feast to remind them
[1:27:58] of what God had done I think it's good
[1:28:01] to be reminded what God has done it
[1:28:04] helps your testimony
[1:28:07] what the brains are unspeakable look at
[1:28:13] the things that's been given to bash and
[1:28:16] they overcome by the blood of lamb
[1:28:19] another word of their testimony and
[1:28:25] bring celebration because revelation
[1:28:28] 12:12 says therefore rejoice after they
[1:28:36] overcomes F to the battle come milk is
[1:28:40] Nick ask to the battles after the battle
[1:28:43] they rejoiced after the battle their joy
[1:28:47] until John has some say that far fix you
[1:28:51] overcome therefore rejoice you heavens
[1:28:53] and ye that twelve give them and then he
[1:28:58] gives a warning to the tribulation
[1:29:00] Saints whoa into the inhabitants of the
[1:29:03] earth so just before the tribulation
[1:29:06] just after the battle they somebody
[1:29:09] overcoming Peleliu you is justifying
[1:29:15] what are you doing celebration
[1:29:17] testifying what God is done testifying
[1:29:19] how great he is God prepared a feast he
[1:29:24] makes the enemy sit around and watches
[1:29:25] god feed you with blessings and mercy
[1:29:28] and love he accuses you day and night
[1:29:32] and got violent he tries to make you
[1:29:35] feel guilty tries to condemn you every
[1:29:38] every time you hear Judas you think oh
[1:29:40] god that's me that's what the devil does
[1:29:43] to you makes you think of a negative
[1:29:46] report but the enemy has to sit around
[1:29:49] and he watches you after your mistake
[1:29:52] after your fault
[1:29:53] he watches God give you a big spoon full
[1:29:56] of grace says open up here it comes
[1:30:01] but I don't understand I know they did
[1:30:04] this I know they was given I know the
[1:30:05] history of that we never said was
[1:30:08] deserving hey man listen for him to say
[1:30:11] something you work for this ain't
[1:30:13] something you achieved grace is a gift
[1:30:17] he gives you grace he gives you mercy he
[1:30:20] gives you love a man because you're his
[1:30:25] child something you merited you got
[1:30:31] children at home you don't feed them
[1:30:33] because do you want something back from
[1:30:35] you feed them because you love them and
[1:30:38] right in the presence of our accuser God
[1:30:41] provides us unmerited favors a man
[1:30:48] then the president's your enemy he
[1:30:50] watches every bit of it amen
[1:30:54] and God didn't just provide the feast
[1:30:56] when everything is going good but he
[1:30:58] still gives me a feast when everything's
[1:31:00] going wrong you remember the prodigal
[1:31:02] after everything he went wrong the
[1:31:04] father met him I said the father met him
[1:31:07] he ran and met him and when you do
[1:31:11] something wrong when they choose her
[1:31:12] pounces you like a lion he starts your
[1:31:15] money of your past reminding your
[1:31:16] mistakes
[1:31:17] amen but it's been you can testify in
[1:31:21] the presence of your enemies that the
[1:31:25] Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[1:31:29] that's when you can testify how great
[1:31:32] God's love is how great God's mercy is
[1:31:34] but to be Kyser desiring now even when
[1:31:38] I'm not deserving he loves me anyway
[1:31:44] hallelujah hidden their wonderful
[1:31:47] friends now prepares the table before me
[1:31:50] and the presence of my enemies must
[1:31:52] enter feast hence the scripture says
[1:31:58] and the scripture says thou anointest my
[1:32:01] head with all which we know by the
[1:32:03] message of course that's the custom
[1:32:05] they take the oil and it's mixed for the
[1:32:08] perfume and it's a sign to make them
[1:32:11] welcome that they anoint you with this
[1:32:12] all glory and David said when I come to
[1:32:18] his table
[1:32:19] he was there ready to anoint me with you
[1:32:22] and David the man that knows something
[1:32:25] about being anointed with all David
[1:32:27] remembers how it felt when the prophet
[1:32:29] Samuel had anointed him as a king and
[1:32:31] poorly all from the top of his head to
[1:32:33] the bottom of his feet and David said
[1:32:36] he's prepared me a feast in the mister -
[1:32:38] and he anointed me withal and I say Amen
[1:32:42] and David says but I ain't done yet
[1:32:46] because my god which is an Eastern
[1:32:54] custom that when you would come in they
[1:32:58] put a cup in your hand and they begin to
[1:33:01] pour the wine and they wouldn't just
[1:33:04] fill it all the way up they would fill
[1:33:07] it until it runs over the top of it and
[1:33:10] starts pouring down the ground to let
[1:33:13] you know there's plenty there's plenty
[1:33:17] of this oh there's there's vast full of
[1:33:21] drink all you want you're so welcome to
[1:33:24] come and to eat at my table I want you
[1:33:27] to know that you could eat in plenty you
[1:33:29] can rest in peace and you can have all
[1:33:31] you need to drink and David says having
[1:33:36] to come to his table he refreshed me
[1:33:39] with the oil that re-energized me until
[1:33:42] finally I have to say like the cup
[1:33:45] bearer bringing me the cup overflows
[1:33:51] if you can't say that tonight some drunk
[1:33:56] if you can't testify that tonight
[1:34:02] whether you sin right no troubles you
[1:34:04] say no battles I'm saying it because
[1:34:06] there is and look who's the one fighting
[1:34:09] Mossad you that's got the rod and the
[1:34:12] staff to lead you and us in the ride two
[1:34:14] guys our feet and say dollar with me
[1:34:20] aspire heart so now if you look up and
[1:34:23] mercy all praise be to God
[1:34:26] and the presence of your enemy you've
[1:34:30] been anointed enemy look at your life
[1:34:35] maybe can't figure it out because he
[1:34:38] knows you're not deserving and the
[1:34:40] mystery is you know you're not either
[1:34:42] but why does God keep giving mercy and
[1:34:45] grace and love and showing favor and
[1:34:48] partiality why does he keep doing it
[1:34:51] because he's my shepherd David knew
[1:34:56] something about tending sheep and David
[1:34:58] know that when the Sheep would go astray
[1:35:00] he'd leave the ninety and nine and go
[1:35:02] get the one and bring it back into the
[1:35:04] thought it's because David was
[1:35:06] commissioned to watch over daddy's sheep
[1:35:09] what kind of a shepherd would David have
[1:35:11] been if David would have come back to
[1:35:13] his daddy they saw son house all the
[1:35:15] sheep there were dead they're all dead
[1:35:16] but everything's good oh no David knew
[1:35:20] if I had to give my own life amen
[1:35:22] these are my sheep hallelujah so our
[1:35:27] heads are bowed our eyes is closed
[1:35:29] maybe you've not been able to testify
