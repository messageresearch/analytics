1. I mean those are being in his presence can change us forever and we will allow it to second Samuel chapter 12 verse 1. and the Lord sent Nathan unto David and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing say one little you lamb which he had bought and nourished up and it grew together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter and there came a traveler unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own hurt to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor mans lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him I mean Dr B remembered today as we pray just hold your need in your heart heavenly father as we come into your great presence we are so thankful that you're mindful of us Lord Jesus we're asking you take your word and speak to us open our hearts we are very grateful that you have allowed your book called The Bible to be written of true stories most happy and sad both the types of stories that make us rejoice and the type that make us repent we're thankful that it is not fictitious or made up of some people's imagination but it was you who inspired the authors to write it we love it we thank you for it we ask you to be mindful of the needs today of those that are present we know we have many that are sick flu and flu symptoms and viruses and things like that that are going around but we pray you'd be mindful of your children today Father helped me to get out of the way in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask amen God bless you you may be seated the year is 10 35 BC David is now a middle-aged man rich powerful influential has at least three wives many children flocks herds quite a Palace that he lived in he has political ties with Egypt with many of the Great Kings during this time he was totally taken off guard you can imagine as the prophet Nathan comes to bring this story to him I don't know how but somehow he had been able to convince himself for about a year now that he will still okay with God which is more than I can comprehend I trust it is you that a man that loved the Lord so much a man the only man that we have recorded in the scripture that says he was a man after God's Own Heart very beautiful and yet unusual title for any Immortal to have but in this stage of his life is not that same man in one way we look back in retrospect and you're able to see that it was through this LAX type of condition in his life the time when the Kings go out to war and David had not done that so he was trusting maybe too overconfident too much looking to the blessing of God and thinking well you know I'm in a good state right now nothing can happen to me I'm so blessed the lord loves me so much so he enters into this very dangerous time we know that trials can be so difficult and trials can be devastating but after looking at when people get into the lacks time of their life they aren't going through trials I think I prefer trials most of the time the people of God it was not when they were going through such tests and such trials that they fell away but it was when they got lacks when they got cold and different when they were so blessed as we would say they were so happy and you know they become a little bit loose with sir walk with the Lord and this is where we can see that David was now as we pick up where we were last week I'm sure that most of you were quite shocked as I was and I've talked to several this week and um by by text by email by what's out by all types of communication from different people around the world I've come to find out I wasn't the only one that was shocked about David and Bathsheba now in my thinking I've always thought such Grace such Mercy to Bathsheba but after Sunday my view has changed somewhat now I'm thinking such Grace such Mercy to David and we know that God has no problem in identifying women in sin and calling them out so it's not that God had some sort of issue in identifying Bathsheba and her wrong and in her sin but as we read the parable again here this morning if you notice and I'm sure you did that God never blamed Bathsheba for any of this but God identifies her as a few lamb a lamb so you would not call a prostitute a lamb you would not call even Tamar a lamb you would not identify someone like Rahab and I hope it doesn't stumble you but even in the New Testament of carrying over the story of Rahab both in the book of Hebrews and in the Book of James Rahab is still called a prostitute now it's not that the blood coming through the cross did not wipe away her old identity and why the authors chose to still identify her under that name I can't say that I rightly know but all I know is that God allowed these women to be part of the genealogy of the human birth of our savior and for those of you who study genealogy I'm sure you know that it was through the son Solomon that God bought part of the genealogy but not all you see God had also pronounced judgment against one of the seed of David because of his idolatry and God said not one of his seed was set on my throne that one was through the lineage of Solomon but remember David and Bathsheba had another son his name was Nathan Nathan begat children the genealogy kept coming till we come down to the Book of Matthew Joseph come through Solomon's lineage but Mary came through Nathan's both Joseph and Mary were of the seed of David had Mary been of the seed of Solomon the Lord Jesus could have never been the heir to David's throne David remember God promised him friends this is when sovereignty steps in and overshadows man's ignorance I'm so glad he's had to do it he's done it for me is he done it for you so God allowed both Joseph and Mary to be of the genealogy but yet it was through Mary read it when you get time when you read the genealogy there in the Book of Matthew and how that Matthew pins it and writes it down of each one of those women and he changes the terminology when he comes to Mary and he says of whom of whom Jesus was born which is called the Christ God in his sovereignty stepped in and allowed Mary also to come of the genealogy of David that it might be fulfilled he would fulfill and be of the tribe of David even call the son of David can you imagine God allowing himself to come through a man like David all before like Sunday we all had no problem with that I mentioned that for many of you it was the same as it was with me that to be honest with you David was one of my favorite Heroes of the Old Testament and I think Hollywood helped shape all of this in us that we can find it easier to forgive the man than we can the woman [Music] y'all going to preach on there look at me so for David to be forgiven and David to be you know the great Giant Killer and David the mighty a psalmist of Israel and David the harpist and David all of this and that but to accept the fact that David was a sheep stealer and David was a premeditated murderer that's hard on our iconic view isn't it now watch in Genesis chapter 3 verse 11. when Adam and Eve had done wrong notice how God addresses the woman in this wrongdoing and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to be with me now notice man after the fall he doesn't take the blame but in one sense of the word he blames God forgiving her to him the woman whom thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman the knitted amazing when God sends Nathan the prophet he does not send her to both David and Bathsheba we have no record that Nason ever even addresses Bathsheba in this wrong wonder why she was not the aggressor I hope you can understand it she was actually innocent overpowered by a strong aggressive leader well praise the Lord and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou Hast done so God has no problem in addressing women when they aren't wrong right God has no problem in communicating and even indicting them so God personally indicted Adam God personally indicted Eve and God could speak directly to her and yet why does not God do that in the case of David and Bathsheba unless the scenario is different what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat of course as we say both of them are passing the buck until it comes to the serpent and he asked nobody to pass it on to Ahab and Jezebel in First Kings 21 17. and the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tish by saying arise go down to meet Ahab king of Israel which is in Samaria behold he's in the vineyard of nabos whether he has gone down to possess it you remember the story but to save time you read it when you get time and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the Lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the Lord in the place where the dogs licked the blood of nabos shall the dogs lick thy blood even thine verse 23 and of Jezebel also spoke the spake the Lord saying the dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel so God has no problem addressing women as well as men you agree so why doesn't God do that in this case notice again Paul in the New Testament first Timothy 5 6 addressing not a woman just by name but women in general but she that liveth and pleasure is dead while she liveth again Revelation 17 16 and the ten horns which thou solest upon the Beast these shall hate the which what we've been dealing with on Wednesday night and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire so God has no issues no qualms whatsoever in addressing either individual women or women as a category or women as it was here which is wrong so God surely would have had no problem in addressing Bathsheba had Bathsheba been guilty but in the parable the mystery that lays in the parable that Nathan gives to David shows both guilt and innocence now unlike today to where that women are getting more and more of their rights of course and I agree that some of them did need more even coming in the New Testament we find that Paul even though many of the people want to call Paul a woman hater yet Paul actually placed the women of the New Testament in a higher category in Christ Jesus than they ever had in the Old Testament he wrote more about their Liberty in Christ more about their Liberty and the baptism of the Holy Ghost so where these women get that Paul was a woman hater I don't understand it at all he was one of the greatest liberators of the New Testament but not liberators in the sense of sin but liberators in the sense of the Gospel like so God then would have no problem because he's the same one that anointed Paul so he gives Nathan this Parable and he identifies Bathsheba as well he calls back again to second Samuel 12 3 the poor man had nothing saved one little you lamb so he identifies Uriah the hittite as being the pastor now notice this God is going to take a pastoral synetting a setting rather which was something David would have been able to relate to and I hope you understand this that brother Branham makes this comment and how can overcome when he was talking about lot and lot's why and he said your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking now I want you to think of this in this light then that in the Old Testament scenario it was in a similar sense that Uriah the hittite which was her husband would have also been her pastor he would have been the one that would have been leading the flaw now he had a small flock it consisted of his young wife and it all so consisted of children that were still in the home that had been brought to the Earth in between Uriah and his first wife so he raised up Bathsheba along with these children I want you to think of the consequences now that Bathsheba is going to have taken from her so Bathsheba was not asked did she want to come to the King's house she was not asked did she want to leave her home her husband she's now the stepmother of these children but David is looking at it through eyes of what compassion Mercy servitude to God he's looking at it through eyes of lust and selfishness he does not love Bathsheba he does not love Uriah or love the children that are going to be involved now seek of it all that the great amount of pain and anxiety and remember each one of these women brings something into the Kaleidoscope of the Gentile bride when we look at Tamar she brought something totally different than did Rahab and did ruse and yet we look at Bathsheba and I hope the Lord will help me to be able to bring it to you that Bathsheba was not just a one woman individual alone but she represented a spectrum of those that would make up the Gentile bride and she brings something into this genealogical equation that is totally different than the other four women so she's bringing something into this equation as a person with all types of hurt and all types of anxiety and all types of disappointments in life and thrown into a situation that she did not ask to be and yet also an individual that would not let her hurts dominate her life Bathsheba learned to love again Bathsheba learned to trust again that Sheba had to learn can you imagine now she's forced into this situation she becomes with the child of the king she did not ask for that she was taken from her husband forced into the king's bed she was forced from those step children that she had been taken care of right by whom a man of great Authority a man that had she resisted him he could have had her killed just like he did look at the power this man had writing my goodness uriah's own death warrant and he carried it back to the commander-in-chief look what Authority as I've said before God never intended for man to have such power in the first place so the relationship that Nason conveys to David look at the words that he uses which he bought and nourished it and it grew together with him and with his children it did deed of his own meat drink of his own cup laying his own bosom and was unto him as a daughter so every one of these attributes are attributes of deep kindness and affection so what's he doing is contrasting what David did versus what Uriah did so everything your eye did was love it was tenderness it was generaless it was affection and what did David do David come to feed his passion and his lust which was the stranger that come through and he did it out of selfishness out of his own lust praise the Lord which was the exact opposite sip of everything that Uriah had done notice in verse 4 and he said there came a traveler under the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock now here again he's identifying David as being this rich man which has many many flocks and he identifies the other guy as only having one little small you lamb he says of his own flock and of his own herd now to us you know this wouldn't mean very much but David spent many many years of his life as a Shepherd he's supposed to be doing the same thing now that he is King he is a Shepherd over God's people and he said to dress for the wayfaring man that was coming to him but took took the poor man's land and dressed it for the man that was to come now what is David fixing to do David is fixing to divide uriah's flock he's fixing to separate uriah's flock now they were happy they were just a simple family in Israel not a great renowned people who knows if we even know that much about Uriah had this story not come into view I personally believed it must have been the will of God in time for David and Bathsheba to be together how that would have come about I don't have a clue because there was a genetic pool that Bathsheba would have added to the lineage of David that was necessary for Solomon and for Nason and for the other two sons to come through it was through these four sons that the greatest children that David whatever father would come true notice a lot of the other Renegades and you see the mother church that they were born from and you see what a difference they were from Bathsheba now Bathsheba was not the type of woman the natural she was abused by all of this actually some of the Hebrew writers say David basically raped her it was not it was nothing on her own part she did not want to do it and yet a woman that was brought into the economy of God your first time to be beckoned into the Palace of the king it's against your will you're talked into doing something which is against the law of God against your husband against your own conscience and yet the king the greatest man in all of Israel is the one that forces you to do it how terrible now I guess my question to some of you today is this had you been living in the days of King David would you all had enough courage to stand for God and to say David is a sheep stealer and David is a murderer or would we have said well now you know um well now well now what well now some of you would have took up for me you know why because you take up for people now that do the same thing if it's one of your kids or one of your friends or somebody that you like shame on us for having respect a person the Bible calls it sin friends [Applause] now you imagine there were people in that day that heard about because the word got out that what David had done and some of them they were disappointed they were let down and no doubt people ain't changed one bit of what they were right then and some people took up for him said well you know you're right he's just an old dog and he ain't nothing but an old Gentile sorry outfit like King David he's loved to the Lord he's blessed of the Lord I may not totally go along with the way to do but I'll tell you what the blessing of God's on that man's life I ain't never heard nobody play that harp like he can play it I ain't heard nobody ever heard nobody sing like that man can sing have you ever heard anybody write a Psalm the way David Bob that man's a man of God he but God said he was wrong I want you to listen what kind of impression that Uriah made on your prophet brother REM says it this way when I get to Glory I want to walk up to Uriah and shake his hands and say God be praised for your testimony meant something to me in my Earthly Journey is that something a what Elijah is going to walk up and shake hands with Uriah the hittite and say your testimony meant something to me that's quite a man to me is it not to you now notice David then being the aggressor and as he moves into this spot as being the Predator I hate sexual predators I don't care if they're a preacher I don't care if they're a king I don't care if they claim to be a prophet I don't hate their soul but I hate that conniving low-down evil thing that gets on and let me tell your parents something in this age of social intercommunication that we have you better watch your children you better watch your daughters because we've got prayers oh my that love to pray on our teenage daughters and our teenage Sons well come on somebody say Amen some of you are too trusting in the first place and you know everything's all right my boy goes to church I don't mean one thing to God your boy ain't got the Holy Ghost he ain't no different than David was your girl ain't got the Holy Ghost ain't no different than anybody else was [Applause] now whenever we look at this scenario you know to be honest with you I don't like preaching this about David man he's one of my favorite Heroes I mean that you know this is a giant killer this is the bear killer this is the lion killer but I've got to add to his resume he's a Uriah killer can great people do stupid things great people can much less us ignoramuses hahaha and it ain't too astounding to me that crazy people can do crazy things but what have we done to a lot of these people we've bleached them out we bleached them out and made them where they were just almost faultless and without fault we need to take another read in our Bible I'll tell you every person that ever steps their feet down the streets ago you know how they're going to get there the grace of God oh my so David divides this flock this loving wonderful simple little home oh my goodness notice David the murderer second Samuel 11 14 and it came to pass in the morning that David wrote a letter to Joe I've been sent by the hand of Uriah and he wrote in the letter saying set you your ride in the Forefront of the hottest battle and retire you from him that he may be smitten and dying it came to pass what joab observed the city that he has signed Iran to a place where he knew the Valiant men were and the men of the city went out and fought with job and therefore some of the people of the Servants of David Uriah the hittite died also yet when he hears this in parabolic form he gets so mad why it was a nameless story so if you and I look at scenarios and we don't know who it is but we just show that ain't right go ahead of God I'll tell you one thing and then we attach a name and all of a sudden totally changed you need a closer walk with God remember friends the bride is going to be part of the judgment we are going to judge angels now let me just paint this soil say where I'm going with this God will not tolerate a sheep stealing King he will not tolerate a sheep stealing preacher neither will God tolerate a sheep stealing disease do you understand every child of God that deals with cancer with TB with pneumonia with all these diseases do you understand one day them demons that caused that are going to stand before us and they are going to give an account for trying to steal our life on this Earth I don't want to be no part of them demonic warfare to you because they're going to stand before God every devil that's tried to talk you out of your place every devil that's trying to talk you away from the word of God one day they're going to stand before you and they are going to be judged and condemned now watch David's response in verse 5 and David's anger was greatly kindled against the man hmm because the prophet does such a wonderful job in setting this Force he still don't realize it's him so David passes judgment and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that has done this thing shall surely die of all the blindness this is the worst kind because it makes us blind to ourselves how many has ever been there and done that and then all of a sudden the Lord by his Mercy opens your eyes and you say Lord have mercy it's so easy for us to see the blindness I wish brother so and so could I wish brother Paul could see how faulty I wish brother Aaron could say boy I'll tell you one thing I wish he could see how far glory to God I wish he could be like me I just wish everybody in the church could be like me well as the pastor I wish they ate I hope he ain't watched David render the Judgment in verse six he shall restore the lamb Thor full because he did this thing because he had no pity where did he get this now because of the way Nathan conveyed it the rich man was merciless no pity on this poor man and David picked it up Nathan said to David thou art the man you can imagine where he hears these words anybody ever done that besides me when that old heart goes and you feel the flush in your cheeks you can feel your blood pressure as it's going up and all of a sudden thou thus saith the Lord God of Israel I Anointed The King over Israel are not delivered thee out of the hand of Saul by coveting committing adultery bearing false witness and killing he trespasses for of the Ten Commandments yeah it Still Remains righteous enough to pronounce the judgment on some nameless character I could not imagine the anxiety and the trauma but this man now enters into him David sunk so low that he used the sword of the enemy to kill Uriah you see those who have left this message and it blessed the prophet and blast the bride that but then itself is condemnation enough but by using the sword of CNN ABC CBS Fox YouTube Google by using the sword of social media to try to kill this bride they add damnation to their judgment it would have been bad enough had they done it on their own but to bring it out as I saw one of them a few years ago that said in a local television station there in Louisville and was going to give a little essay of this message and how rotten it was in him formally setting at the Tabernacle and and he asked that his identity would be hid and asked that he would sit behind a screen and his face would not be seen because he feared for his life and I saw that I saw you coward you traitor you better fear for your soul not your life there ain't nobody in the mess is going to kill a person like that ain't nobody in the message going to get out for him and yet to do that to bring all of this on the prophet and his message come on saying so sit there and look at me like that don't you see what David done this is why God he just kept adding more and more to this sin notice in verse 9 wherefore thou Hast despised the Commandment of the Lord to do evil and thy sight now once again how God is going to lay the blame thou has killed Uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and assign him with the sword of the children family so after he forces himself on her then he takes her to be his wife he does not even allow her the 30 days of mourning why he's worried about his own height she's going to start showing so here David as he's sharing these words by now his soul is opened the sword has penetrated his soul let's just say Nathan can see he's so distraught his heart rate his blood pressure is affecting him physically Nathan looks at him and says Thou shalt not die that soon the mercy of God turns David's judgment and God forgives him and releases him from his own penalty of death Amazing Grace how sweet is him God's grace could forgive him but God's government demands you see this is something I'm not sure a lot of message folks understand that whenever they do wrong that God can forgive him yes he will and he wants to but you see when we do wrong we are sowing seeds and our repentance does not go out there and dig up all them seeds out of the ground but it simply pardons us and we won't have to answer on the other side of the veil for them but we planted that crop and the crop will come up that's God's government now God's mercy can forgive him and God right there the display of Grace come on the scene and he said Thou shalt not die but the sword will never leave your house so God accepted the sentence of the four-fold punishment now watch this I put this down so and skip over it so the baby died Absalom killed amnon joab killed Absalom I donate you was killed by Ben and I so David reaped fourfold and that's just Tamar was forced by her half-brother Absalom tries to take to Kingdom goes into David's concubines out on the roof in public View of everybody Tamar's life was ruined David sowed lust he ripped lust David sowed murder he reaped murder notice in verse 10 now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou Hast despised me and has taken the wife of Uriah the hittype to be thy one now my little friend David's adultery was a sin of passion and we know if you know the law you know even today that many times defense attorneys will try to defend a client that has done things and that even the judges and the you know all the law understand that there is Crimes of Passion a rage a fit of anger and someone loses their temper and they kill someone and a defense attorney will try to plead the case that way and even God in his love understood that David's adultery was a crime a passion but his murder of Uriah was premeditated murder Lord God oh Jesus notice verse 11 thus saith the Lord behold I will raise up evil against thee notice God does not say against thee and Bathsheba I will take thy wives die notice all of this is personally directed now to King David I will take thy wives from before thine eyes and give them unto Thy Neighbor Absalom lived in a house right next door to David he shall lie with thy wives and the sight of this son for thou didst it in secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the son and David said unto Nathan I notice the difference between David and Adam I just read to you just a few moments ago what Adam said the woman that thou gave us to me this is why God conspire David the death penalty brother sister when you do wrong the thing is do you know how to repent and there's one thing about David you have to give him credit the man knew how to repent Saul did not know how he blamed this one he blamed that but he blames somebody else true repentance is a great gift from God don't blame your wife don't blame the pastor don't blame the children don't blame the church assume you're on and ask God to forgive you repentance and so moves the heart of God oh my Lord God David said unto Nathan ah not her what if she hadn't been out there taking the mcval I would have never said it ain't my fault don't blame me oh I love the way he grabs a whole to the heart of God and that in that moment the heart of God was moved against a sheep stealing murdering King praise the Lord hmm I have sinned against the Lord Nathan said unto David the Lord also you imagine that quick the Lord also has put away thy sin Thou shalt not die how be it because by this deed thou has given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die Nathan departed into his house and the Lord struck the child that uriah's wife notice how God is still calling her uriah's wife but Uriah is dead and David is now married to her but God's still calling her uriah's wife now this is a bad scenario whether it's a wife or a car or a house or spiritual sheep God's calling them belonging to another man and you've got them uh-huh come on now notice in verse 18 that it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died as I said earlier I believe from the genetic makeup and the DNA that bathsheeta Bathsheba would have attributed into mixing with David God somehow in his plan must have had it that they would be together with your eye fulfill this life and David would have met her in a uh the right kind of way and they would have been joined together maybe that was the will of God and you know Satan is so cunning that if he can get a little bit of insight about the program of God and let me just be honest with you and say I don't know how much Satan can always see ahead of time but apparently he can see some things ahead of time brother Brown tells us about Brother Richard Blair from Arkansas and he said that brother Blair the devil tried to make brother Blair doubt brother Branham and question him now there was a scenario happened that brother Brown got very very sick at the point of death and sister Blair call Brother Branham on the phone and brother Brandon but prayed for him and the Lord spared his life and brother Branham relates this scenario on tape and you can hear it and he said that the devil knew that brother Blair was going to need him now how did the devil know that I don't know exactly but it sounds like there are some things that Satan can be able to see in the making and he will try to mess it up as if though it will foil the whole program of God does that make sense to you so then when you look at this it would have seemed as if though there's no way God would have ever blessed any Union between David and Bathsheba why because Satan messed up the time it was the right people but the wrong time in the wrong place which is just as much out of the will of God as if it's the wrong people now watch this the prophet and believer's position in Christ he said the main thing is if we can find where God's word belongs in our life God sets times and God sets limits then it works all to that time now notice he said God set time and God sets limits then it all works to that time so it's not just the will of God Alone that we're looking for but we're looking at the right time and he said people tried to do it within themselves and they try to make God's word fit in their program but you've got it vice versa you've got to fit in God's program and we find that that's true now Moses when he was there knowing that God had made him a promise he was going to deliver the children of Israel Moses knowing he was called for that purpose now when you have a call from God that doesn't altogether a name that you just jump right out and you're doing the will of God now listen carefully you have to find the will of God and the time of God to do it I may believe Moses is called to be the liver he was called to be the deliverer that God had ordained for send him down there but Moses jumps ahead of the program of God now remember God told them I told Abraham that they would go down and sojourn into a land and be a stranger for 400 years how many knows how many years they stayed 430. God said 400. well where did the 30 years come will it come by Moses and also the people Moses missed the time of God that means every missed the time of God well I sure have now people think because they're called to do this or that the other whatever it is as soon as they feel the call and feel God calling them to do something they feel that's the time to jump right out and go after it and if you're not careful you'll get in more trouble than the man who don't even move because you may have found the will of God for you as an individual but you missed the timeline now notice he said Moses thought the children of Israel will understand I said you have to find the will of God and the time of God to do it and Moses thought well the children of Israel will understand now that I'm to be the deliverer so he starts out and he killed him that in other there's no way in the world that you and I believe that God was the one who called Moses to kill the Egyptian so Moses starts out on his resume a lot like David so he's a murderer now did God want that on Moses resume there ain't no way how did that come about he got out of the will of God he missed the time how long was it I don't have a clue but there must have been an element of time and Satan messed him up on the time frame and caused all of this mess and chaos cause the children of God to suffer for 30 more years than necessary well I wish somebody preached with me this morning now notice so he starts out to do it he killed a man and he found out the children of Israel did not understand yet Moses thought they would understand what was missing in this whole scenario the time of God the time of God Moses was the right man and the church said he was the right man for the hour but the hour had not yet synchronized quite where it was right and it enters into a complete mess then Moses lost all hopes can you imagine Moses lost all hopes the power that he had thinking that the freedom wasn't for the children of Israel now Moses gets all discouraged and gets all down on the mouth as we'd say and he lost all hope that it was even for the children of Israel what God even going to do it well God must not love him God don't care for him and no doubt the devil was turning it around and blaming God in Moses mind when it wasn't God's fault at all it was Moses fault he lost all thoughts of Freedom so God met him one day in a burning bush and then when God season came along just exactly then he revealed his plans to Moses now the reason that Moses had forgot about Freedom God's promised that he would free them but God hadn't forgot about it Moses tried in himself and failed so what happened here with David David got in himself and committed adultery so David takes Bathsheba to himself not in love but in lust I firmly believe that David and Bathsheba fell in love later but God never intended for them to be joined together in the birthing Canal of lust oh my Moses tried it himself and failed that's what the church has done many times we've tried in ourselves to do things and we failed to find God's element of time God has times for a season he has seasons for his word he has times in the scripture where it said in the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick you talking about mind-blowing I want you to listen to this there was times when the Lord was there to heal the sick that's where when Jesus was ministering too you imagine when the Lord Jesus was here ministering to Jesus had to operate in the season the Bible says in certain places Jesus went in and healed them all and then he went into another place and he couldn't do any Mighty Miracles because of their unbelief and the angel would trouble the water when when the people were ready at the Lord God's pleasure in his season maybe that other times the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick wow the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sin I'll tell you a friend I love to sing I love to shout I love to have prayer lines I love all that but if we're not careful we're creating another repeat to where we feel like if we don't have a prayer line God can't move we feel like every special meeting's got to have a prayer line or God don't move come on don't get quiet on me if we're not careful we're going right back around the mountain that we come away from years and years ago our God is not going to be told what to do he's not going to be told how to move God wants us to follow him not him follow us [Applause] we find out that God works everything seasonally seasonally and now when Moses when he failed to find what he failed to find was the time limit of God and many times we try to do the program ourselves and fail to direct what was in the burning bush the direct revelation of the will and the time of God so now here stands David indicted by God's David's sin was so rotten so vile David could be restored to Fellowship but the Judgment must be lived out now let me let us look at Bathsheba for a few moments can we try if you can to be able to let her be the sister that she really is she is the one that they say Proverbs 31 was written about who can find the virtuous ah so if your mother was a harlot would you write that about her if your mother was a prostitute would you write that she was a model of a virtuous woman but let's look at her realistically now Bathsheba was a victim who suffered from many life-changing situations after that invitation to the Palace she was separated from her husband as being a military wife so she's already dealing with that whenever David beckons her to the Palace so she's already suffering with loneliness and trying to raise the children she then deals with being forced upon by the king the king taken advantage of her then she deals with grieving over a murdered spouse then she deals with dealing with being pregnant with the king's baby and being pregnant as a widow I wonder why we ain't thought of these things before but we've bleached out King David and made him the Great Mighty conqueror and then just put this rotten sorry woman back there in the Hog Pen where she belongs I think we need to move her from the Hog Pen now if this wasn't bad enough now she is called into the king and the King takes her to be his wife and by the way the Bible does not tell us that she even wanted to be and oh my goodness so she makes this transition how can you imagine your your marriage to this man one day and then a week from now this man here marriage and you're married to him now what happened to those children those step children your eye was dead she is now brought out of that house into the Palace of the king what happens to those children do you honestly think David even cared the epitome of selfishness how rotten how devastating selfishness is come on now Saints can we dare to look at David as he was some of you can some of you can well I'm going to be real Brave this morning and I'm going to look at him the way he was because I want to see the grace of God the way I've never seen it in my life hmm so she now becomes his fourth wife she loses this baby oh my God not only that now she starts a new future she is King David's wife her children I put these things down let me just read them off to you her future children will be raised within a context of sexual misconduct manipulation competition cover-up and violence welcome to the family of King David let me read them to you again sexual misconda manipulation competition cover-up and violence now can you imagine you got four wives they've all got youngins and every one of them thinks hers is you know it's the very best this needs to be the king this needs to be in charge of the music this needs to be the service leader this one year needs to be the Deacon that's why folks want to run a church you know this is the way it ought to be and this is an honor to that can you imagine Four Women and they're all telling you that their son is the greatest he's the brightest he is the most brilliant and we can see as they grow older that they go Divine for the competition of who's going to be king and you remember the story of adonija of course before David is now old and before David ever declares who the heir is after Niger begins to pull men away and he begins to start in saying that he is the king the Revolt has started so her her little life that she had back there by herself was her and her little your husband that she loves so much and he loved her look what woman would not want that kind of a husband when you read all your life the way he loved this woman and the way he treated her putting her up on a pedestal as it was he nourished her he loved her he cared for her so much what woman should have to be out of her mind to not love such a man there's no way that this woman broke off all that love all that feelings all that emotion that she had for this husband which was her hero and now she's supposed to fall in love with a man who forced himself on her but we just read through the Bible sometimes and we omit so much pain we read to the Bible and admit so much suffering oh I'm telling you friend nobody is so tried as the bride of Christ there's so much suffering there's so much anxiety there's so much pain that's hidden between the verses of these Bible characters and we read right over the top of them because we all prefer the slang stories oh we prefer the sword cutting the head off and the glory blood and all that sort of thing what about the people setting back crying because they're called in situations they never asked for some of you sitting right here today are still dealing with trauma and things in your life that happen to you when you were children things that you have dealt with things that people did to you I know my what are we gonna do it Bathsheba is such an example of one that dealt with so much pain so much trauma so much anxiety so much that was forced upon her by others not by her own choice to let it move huh in a negative way I hope you understand this her husband had the reputation of being a man after God's Own Heart that's what I've been studying about her for the last several weeks I just kind of renamed her for my own sake this morning and called her a woman after God's read about her in Proverbs 31 and see what a woman she became read what a woman she was in so much someone King Solomon come in and he sat down on his throne and his mother come into the court and she said she had a petition to lay before him and the king of Israel gets up off of his throne and bows Hazel basins to his mother causes for a throne to be made for his mother and sets her at his own right a woman who refused to let her negative circumstances make her negative all her life but allowed God to mold in her about chapter Bible chapter in the Bible rather that many of you sisters have read and desire to be your model is from there that I took my text when I preach sister Karen pure's funeral and oh my the women the daughters of God when many of you ever sought that that was Bathsheba if I was you I wouldn't let Satan ride off your life I wouldn't let your parents write it up know your friends and last and most important of all I wouldn't let you write it off but if you knew my track record so you want to compare it to David's today and you want to stand and say I've done this bad or worse and yet the Lord God chose when he come to the Earth to come down through that and be called the son of David remember also the New Testament son of David have mercy on me son of David Henry he's like Tara don't call me an old daughter son don't call me the even in the Millennium when he sat on the throne he will be called the son of David Amazing Grace how sweet to sound Hallelujah so the other women of David now one that was so hurt one that had so many scars so many issues she refused to let those things shape her and Stitch he became a woman after God's Own Heart so notable that Solomon mentions his mother over and over and over again through the Book of Proverbs forget not the instruction of thy mother of the instruction of thy father and the wisdom and the teaching of thy mother how could you do that if your mother was a a prostitute so the world let him look down at us let him make fun but one day when they walked Before the Throne of the Lord God they will see surrounding that throne is the makeup of a roof a Rahab ath Sheba a Tamar and the fifth for Mary hallelujah hallelujah let's Stand Together I can imagine that Bathsheba like many of us myself having dealt with many people who've dealt with abuse whether it's sexual abuse or psychological abuse verbal abuse there's many types of abuse many times the innocent person is the one who feels so guilty though they were the one preyed upon huh many times them sorry outfits that Prey Upon them will scare them you better not do this you better not tell nobody you better not this that the other and somehow they feel themself that it's their fault I wonder if Bathsheba put it over her mind over and over again oh if I hadn't have taken that Mikvah that ceremonial basket maybe if I'd have done it earlier maybe if I'd have done it later maybe if I'd had done it the day before the day after that's generally the mentality of a victim that they look at themselves what did I do which works on what their self-esteem and they look at themself it's unworthy and worthy of favor Unworthy of Grace Unworthy of Mercy so to get around good people what they call good people people that wasn't like they were and they said well I'm not good I'm not as good as them I'm not as good as them people I'll never be nothing I'll never amount to anything I'm worried that it'll be treated bad I'm no you're not the Lord Jesus loves you so much having been a victim myself of abuse abuse I can tell you some pain I can tell you some anxiety having been a victim of being abused by preachers lied on used made fun of I went and preached meetings for preachers and them ask me for the offering so what'd you do I give it to him of course and went and preached other meetings and when I get home the preacher would write me a letter and say my wife said I'm worth about a thousand dollars a month so could you care to send me part of the offer preachers um so when people come to me with their little big flimsy excuse they got hurt by one and they don't want to believe in Preachers no more I'm sorry it takes a little bit more than that to be able to excuse you for me because believe me I've been lied to I've been treated I've been used abused but I still believe God's gotten in that are sincere that love him that love his people right don't you that's right I refuse mother don't you still dealing with some of my stuff ah I sure do I'll probably have to deal with it until one day The Sweep comes over me yeah but I refuse to allow it to dominate me do I fight the thing that the only reason brother Donnie that people call you and contact is you because they want money I get it all the time sometimes daily we need help with this we need ten thousand dollars we need twenty thousand dollars we need this we need a new car we need a new microphone we need a new PA system and I think if I didn't help people with anybody even know my name would they even care a thing about me sure that's stuff we have to deal with I'm just being honest with you who's next but I refuse to let that dominate me so does that stop you from giving huh what do you think no well I've been hurt I can't trust somebody I can't so you're going to let that dominate you are you if you ever get to heaven it'll be because you were led by men you were encouraged by men you were helped by men you were preached to a New Birth by men you were preached to the baptism of the Holy Ghost by men you were preached into rapturing Faith by men you reached a body Changed by men you say why because that's God's way that's God's way Hallelujah [Applause] sebastshiba you can take your hurts you're paying your anxiety go way back in a little room have nothing to do with nobody have no confidence in nobody and just stay home the rest of your life and play tapes I'll never be hurt by a preacher can I'll never be her I'm just going to stay home and play tapes the rest of my life and the person that's being hurt the worst by that is you or you can venture out and love again Trust Carolyn I said at a funeral a few years ago of my aunt in Kentucky out of the corner of my eye I saw a man coming up on a walker as I looked at the side of his face I realized who it was the preacher that molested me cold sweat popped out on my face I felt my face Flushing Carol could feel it she's sitting right by me she grabbed me by the hand you okay humanly I wanted to grab up walk up to that man and grab that Walker and beat him over the head with that time why still the scars pain but Jesus inside of me raised up and I felt the sweat stop and I felt the color of my skin changing my ears were burning and they got cooled off and Brother David I looked at him and what I felt sorry for him and it wasn't a Fitting Place or I would have danced most of the people there knew me anyway that had already been eyeing me you know I can't I just can't describe to you how I felt because but Joel I realized the Lord Jesus had helped me I was glad I was able to see that man because they've been years and years since I'd seen him I wasn't quite sure how I would react but I was so happy the way the King of Kings reacted him no doubt I would have been ashamed of the way Otto acted but I was not ashamed of the way my king acted what about it today friends we come in our lives to make up the Kaleidoscope for the making of the Gentile bride some of you will like rehab some of you maybe like Tamar there may be a few of you that's like Mary they say oh I'd personally like to be able to shake your hand after church since since apparently I don't know any of you all that make up our church but I wonder how many of us will be like Bathsheba so hurt so scarred so wounded but we refuse to let our past dictate to us our future you remember when the prophet went overseas and he missed God and listen to preachers instead of listening to the Lord and he picked up the amoeba and he come back and he thought he was going to die he got up early one morning run a bathtub full of water running a fever and going to all these different signs of the amoeba and he saw a vision appeared before him and a Heavenly being took pieces of paper like sheets of paper in his hand and he threw those pieces of paper up toward the sky and it made a pass up into the sky and he said you'll pass or your future before you it's clear you said friends you cannot imagine how I felt why because the Lord had forgiven him scared to death oh he always wanted to go back to Africa again got to go in 65 couldn't preach he always wanted to redeem himself from that that's the way we are our mistakes our failures our shortcomings somehow we want to go back and do it again but you know what I'm also face facts some of it will never be able to do all we knew is David did committed into the hams of God so God takes the first child and the Bible says Nathan come to David and said go into your wife and comfort her so David comforted his wife and she brought forth a son and called his name peace Solomon but the Lord sent Nathan the prophet to them and called his name Jedediah beloved of the Lord and put his own name yah in that name Jedediah from the same woman that was so broken-hearted so maybe it's time for you to be comforted by your husband the Lord Jesus to woo away your anxiety and all your burdens and all your trauma of your past and let you and him be able to produce a man of peace Solomon you already know it but the name shulamite from The Song of Solomon it's the feminist form of Solomon so the Song of Solomon is about Mr and mistress Solomon Mr and mistress Jesus Christ can we bow our heads together I wonder how many today would like to be remembered as we go before the Lord God bless you your need your past your present maybe some of it's not so much your past that you're dealing with things it's just where you are now things got a hotel and you hate it you've tried your best to shake it but you just can't you can't stand yourself you can't stand where you are let him be the god of your present tense what about it Bathsheba you bring all the hurt the anxiety the pain can't trust David you can't trust the man that's sent to get him you can't trust this one that one the other one and yet this man asks you to be a part of him with the Union takes you to yourself don't even let you grieve for your child or your husband you're a widow and you're with child how you're going to raise that child who's going to be there to help you Hallelujah or can you cast all of that in the hands of the Lord Jesus those of you that in preacher hurt those of you have been hurt by this and that and the other bring it all to God look friends don't make me or any other man don't put no man to be your idol all men will fail you there's only one that you can look at as your ultimate example and that's the Lord Jesus he's the only one that will not fail you Heavenly fathers we open up ourselves to you today oh Jesus it's painful for me to mention some of these things Lord there's no doubt some of them stand there and I see it on their faces their expression as they mince a frown in their corners of mouths will twist up and a wrinkle will come on it it's because the very salt of their past es the dendrites in their brain to release hormones oh God we all carry our baggage we need you Jesus we need you oh Father we bring all we are today all our hurts all our anxieties some self-inflicted some inflicted by others we bring them all to you Lord God I pray may we become the type of woman spiritually speaking that as your bride the bride of Christ can spiritually reflect proverbs 31. unlike the woman of Revelation 17. help us Lord to see that woman is so different but who can find a virtuous woman and there are no virtuous people on the Earth and the only way you could even find one you couldn't find one either so what you had to do was make one so you place the seed inside the soul and waited to the right moment in time for that seed to be quickened then Lord God under that quickening which was our new birth then that person never done it in the first place that's why that we are the virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ oh we can still remember those things but our seed can't because it never done it our sin was under that old nature that nature that old husband that passed away and died praise God so justification under the opening of the seventh seal is not that we get forgiveness and we try to patch up that old man and try to live with that memory but under the opening of the seventh seal we never did it Hallelujah the lamb takes the book of our life and Strikes off the seal and calls our seed to birth praise the Lord help us Jesus father may you bring healing today not only to those in the visible audience but those that are streamed those around the world that will hear it Lord we've been called to the Palace but like Bathsheba many of us have brought baggage to the Palace oh David Fell in Love with their looks the Bible doesn't even say knew anything about who she was in love with her as a person but her looks so here she comes to the Palace of broken-hearted pregnant Widow she had to leave her stepchildren David did not want them there so she comes with all this baggage but little by little she become a woman after God's Own Heart in the midst of that chaos she found out God had a purpose for her not only to be the wife of the king but in another time be the mother of the king Hallelujah the only woman that we have in the Bible that would gain that position in that same way to become the Queen Mother oh Jesus we entered into your courts ashamed we entered into your courts with a baggage of sin and load of memories but may we hear the voice of the king as he hears us you see we hear him say come my queen come my queen let me Comfort you oh my Lord how will you comfort me how will you bring Comfort to my heart I will give you my seed you shall bear my seed o glory to God glory to God for we know through the Gentile bride will usher in the Millennium the births of the Millennium comes through the consummation of the Bride thank you Jesus Hallelujah when the bride is carried away the next great thing that takes place on the earth and father in the honor of the glory of God is the Millennium it will be produced after Christ and the Bride of United together thank you Lord oh Jesus take us Lord wash us cleanse us purges father Hallelujah anybody willing to raise your hand to the Lord just bring all your baggage your memories your past your present what about your future don't just give God your past give him your future you're young people don't take your teams don't take your 20s give it to the devil and say I'll wait till I'm 40 years old you may not live to walk outside this door give him everything your past your present Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah oh Father God We Worship You Lord God thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah let's just keep our hands up there in the presence of the Lord now he knows exactly what each one of you need you're

a priestess to keemosh you offered living children to kimash as a sacrifice then you've got Bathsheba would you have a problem and people know it well yeah my aunt was a prostitute and my aunt before her she was we wouldn't hardly want nobody to know that would be but the Lord Jesus allowed this to be in his patronage his genealogy why so the people who would need him as a savior would be able to look at where he come from and said if that was in the natural family tree surely he won't have no problem saving me so who are we really sinners centers that's what we were saved by the grace of God
