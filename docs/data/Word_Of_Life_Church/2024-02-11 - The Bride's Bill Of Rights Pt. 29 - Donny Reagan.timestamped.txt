[35:43] struggle
[35:45] haunted by Ghost and lived in my
[35:51] [Music]
[35:52] past bound up in Shackled
[35:57] of all my
[36:00] [Music]
[36:02] failures
[36:04] oneing how long is this going to
[36:12] last then you look at this prison and

[37:55] man inside out of me his day is long
[37:59] dead and gone because I've got a new
[38:03] name a new life I'm not the same and a

[38:27] wipe away every stain I'm not who I used

[38:41] [Music]
[38:55] redeemed
[39:01] praise the Lord for
[39:05] that are you happy to be in the house of
[39:07] the Lord
[39:09] today let's turn to 1 Corinthians
[39:12] chapter 2 verse 16 if you
[39:16] would let's look at a little bit today
[39:19] of why we're not who we used to be and
[39:22] what it was about us that has changed
[39:26] and is
[39:28] changing that's one thing about
[39:30] Christianity it's not like you get it
[39:32] all on day one and you stop growing stop
[39:36] learning stop getting more and more of
[39:39] God when we stop we're either backslid
[39:43] or we've moved beyond the curtain of
[39:44] time we want to keep on growing don't
[39:47] we 1 Corinthians chapter
[39:51] 2:16 for who hath known the mind of the
[39:55] Lord that that he may instruct him
[39:59] but we have the mind of Christ for who
[40:03] has known the mind of the Lord that he
[40:06] may instruct him but we have the mind of
[40:11] Christ I find such a paradox in that
[40:14] statement whenever we truly receive the
[40:17] mind of the Lord we're not going to try
[40:19] to instruct him actually instead of us
[40:22] trying to change the mind of God when we
[40:24] pray we pray God will change just to fit
[40:28] his mind for who has known the mind of
[40:30] the Lord that he may instruct him that
[40:32] we have the mind of Christ now look at
[40:36] the meaning of this word understanding
[40:39] judging the capacity for Spiritual
[40:42] truths The Faculty of
[40:45] perceiving divine
[40:48] things of recognizing goodness and of
[40:52] hating evil the power of con considering
[40:57] and judging soberly calmly and
[41:02] impartially it's easy to see from the
[41:04] meaning of this one word the majority of
[41:07] Christendom in this day does not have
[41:10] the mind of
[41:12] Christ they cannot judge between right
[41:14] and
[41:15] wrong they cannot judge between light
[41:18] and darkness I find that so sad with the
[41:22] world out here but what I find even more
[41:25] sad is among how many Christians can
[41:28] they can look right at something that's
[41:30] as wrong as wrong can be and off the
[41:34] word off the
[41:36] word just totally off the word and
[41:38] they'll look right at and say I don't
[41:40] see nothing wrong with it that is
[41:44] scary I said that is
[41:48] scary now watch
[41:50] Paul again in Romans chapter 8 verse
[41:55] 6 for to be carnally
[42:00] minded
[42:02] wow is
[42:04] death to just just to be carnally
[42:08] minded is
[42:10] death but to be spiritually minded is
[42:14] life and
[42:16] peace because the carnal mind and listen
[42:20] what we were when we were born because
[42:23] the carnal mind is in enmity against God
[42:28] I want you to notice the way he says it
[42:30] he doesn't say that the carnal mind is
[42:33] at enmity against God but the carnal
[42:37] mind itself is
[42:40] enmity against God for it is not subject
[42:44] to the law of
[42:46] God neither
[42:48] indeed can
[42:50] be so it's not like them that our carnal
[42:53] mind one day will just finally give in
[42:57] and it'll just comply to God it's
[43:00] totally
[43:02] impossible the carnal mind can never be
[43:06] subject to the law of God I'll tell you
[43:08] what's bad is when you take a carnal
[43:11] minded person that's not truly been born
[43:12] again and get them Anointed with a
[43:15] religious
[43:17] spirit brother you talking about an a
[43:19] fix because remember a religious devil
[43:22] is seven times worse than any other
[43:25] devil
[43:26] so when a religious devil will anoint
[43:29] the carnal mind it's n an impossibility
[43:34] for a person like that to ever get free
[43:37] on their
[43:38] own we were born carnal and therefore me
[43:42] we must be
[43:43] reborn spiritual we were born carnal let
[43:47] me say that to you again we were born
[43:49] carnal and we must be
[43:52] reborn spiritual I me like to be
[43:55] remembered today as as we pray I got a
[43:57] call from Lance this morning about 8:30
[44:00] and the doctor had just left his room
[44:02] and U his uh pancreas is doing some B's
[44:06] numbers were down still high but down
[44:10] from what they were um and the doctor
[44:13] tells him it's just going to take some
[44:15] time going to have to be basically on a
[44:18] a liquid diet for weeks possibly even
[44:22] months um so he needs really needs a a
[44:26] touch from the Lord um couple of spots
[44:29] on his liver or the pancreas rather that
[44:32] they're watching just want to make sure
[44:34] that they don't get infected absolutely
[44:36] nothing they can do to keep it from
[44:37] getting infected but we know someone who
[44:39] can don't we yeah of course if it does
[44:42] get infected becomes bad they' have to
[44:43] have part of that removed so we're just
[44:45] trusting the Lord so doctor told him itd
[44:48] have 40% chance of leaving tomorrow 70%
[44:51] chance of leaving on Tuesday so it's
[44:54] just if you don't mind if you just agree
[44:55] age with us together in prayer that the
[44:57] Lord would just help him and touch him
[44:59] and give him strength in his body you
[45:01] have a need a request on your heart
[45:03] today about lifted
[45:05] hand Heavenly Father we counted a great
[45:08] privilege that we could be gathered
[45:09] together here today in your presence
[45:12] with children of God of like Precious
[45:14] faith we thank you Lord Jesus that
[45:17] you've come to the Earth that we might
[45:18] be redeemed as we just heard the song so
[45:21] beautifully sang we were in that
[45:24] captivity of sin seemingly no way out
[45:28] the law could not do it the prophets
[45:30] could not do it so you came yourself and
[45:33] we're so thankful we ask you today
[45:35] Father that you would help us Lord may
[45:38] we realize why we must absolutely must
[45:42] have the Holy Ghost within us there's
[45:45] only one way out of this world in a body
[45:48] change and that is to receive your
[45:50] nature inside of us help me that I can
[45:53] get out of the way father anoint me but
[45:56] please anoint the people as well be
[45:58] mindful of the needs of your children
[46:00] today all the sick father bless your
[46:02] word in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[46:05] ask it amen God bless you you may be
[46:14] seated the carnal mind
[46:19] is not
[46:23] only in a state of war with God
[46:26] but the carnal mind itself is actually
[46:29] against God's
[46:32] being it reasons against
[46:36] him it resents
[46:40] him in one way the carnal mind wishes
[46:45] God was
[46:47] not the carnal mind does not like a
[46:50] superior one telling them what to do
[46:54] what they must do this and don't do that
[46:57] and how they have to live the carnal
[47:01] mind
[47:02] feels its wory
[47:05] itself to exalt its own opinions above
[47:08] God's word and God's way and the carnal
[47:11] mind would like to bury the remembrance
[47:15] of God deep within its own perceptions
[47:20] and its own
[47:21] thoughts this is the way every one of us
[47:24] are born with a carnal
[47:27] mind and yet we know reading praying
[47:32] meditating going to church all those
[47:35] things are good but none of that will
[47:38] rid you of the carnal mind you're born
[47:40] with it's sensal it's perverted it's not
[47:45] right it's
[47:47] corrupt it denies the existence of God's
[47:51] power and his word in the way that he
[47:53] wants to be I think what I'm saying to
[47:56] you that the carnal mind may not always
[48:00] deny God's existence but it wants to
[48:03] deny God the right to be able to live in
[48:07] you and I the way he wants to and yet
[48:10] God turns that right around and says I
[48:12] want to take your carnal mind from you
[48:16] and I want to give you access into my
[48:20] mind to where you will no longer
[48:23] struggle against my will but actually my
[48:28] will will be so inside of you and a part
[48:31] of who you are you'll find my will
[48:35] overtaking your own all the self-help
[48:39] books in the world all the professional
[48:43] people you'd be able to go to hear all
[48:46] the preachers and many of the preachers
[48:48] in this modern day they're nothing but
[48:50] psychologist anyway so they just stand
[48:53] in the pull pit and try toy Psy you up
[48:56] you know your psyche brother Brenham
[48:58] used that word a time or two in the
[48:59] message your psyche which is your mental
[49:02] part so they try to use your psyche and
[49:06] give you a religious psychology of how
[49:10] you can be a better person and you try
[49:12] to do things better and just be a better
[49:16] person how can you ever take a snake and
[49:20] make a better snake out of a snake how
[49:23] can you take a hog and make a better hog
[49:26] out of a hog and we were lower than that
[49:30] we were lost we can't do this on our own
[49:33] now listen friend if we're not careful
[49:35] we try to take the message of the hour
[49:37] and work it the same way on people's
[49:40] psyche and try to make them different
[49:42] and then we find out some of them are
[49:44] doing the same things the people out
[49:46] here is doing the message within itself
[49:49] just by memorizing it and reading it
[49:52] will never do it no more than the Bible
[49:54] will but but it takes the power of God
[49:57] to change us from
[49:59] within the the carnal mind is is such an
[50:03] enemy against god notice how brother
[50:06] brandham let me share several things
[50:08] with you here this morning if you don't
[50:09] mind he said sometimes God's ways are so
[50:12] hard that to the human mind to
[50:15] comprehend you just think that it's
[50:19] ridiculous you think God's way and the
[50:22] way that God would do something it seems
[50:25] ridiculous I want to ask you to raise
[50:27] your hands this morning but I wonder how
[50:29] many of us have actually thought that
[50:32] ourself when God would do a certain way
[50:34] or go a certain way or display his will
[50:37] in a certain way and which think that
[50:39] makes no sense at all why in the world
[50:41] would God ever do this or God do that
[50:44] why does God want me to do that why
[50:46] don't want God me to do that it it don't
[50:48] make no sense why would God not want
[50:52] that well you understand what's doing
[50:53] that suffering for you you don't you
[50:56] it's that carnal mind the carnal mind
[50:59] will always try to take God's word and
[51:02] try to minimize the power and maximize
[51:06] the shortcomings it will take the
[51:09] reasons why you cannot do it it will
[51:12] multiply them and the carnal mind will
[51:15] give you every excuse fathomable and it
[51:18] will make perfect sense to you why you
[51:20] cannot do it and explain to you that God
[51:24] perfectly understands
[51:27] that's the carnal mind but the spiritual
[51:30] mind says that's a lie if God says it
[51:34] and God requires it God's obligated to
[51:36] give me the power to be able to live
[51:39] it and somebody said now notice he said
[51:43] faith is ridiculous to the carnal mind
[51:47] ridiculous to the carnal mind it's crazy
[51:50] to anything except God and the one who
[51:55] has Faith then by faith we see we
[51:57] believe the things that our eyes our
[52:00] mind does not declare just because that
[52:05] we believe it so the carnal mind even
[52:09] when a Christian is saved now remember
[52:11] there is an element about you that is
[52:13] totally eradicated by the new birth and
[52:16] there's an element about you that's
[52:18] carnal that will be there until the day
[52:20] you die or the day you are raptured now
[52:23] I don't want to confuse you this morning
[52:25] but there's two Realms of extreme
[52:27] carnality and remember there must be a
[52:30] part of that carnality which must die
[52:33] and that is what Paul is referring to as
[52:36] the mind and yet there is another part
[52:39] which is the flesh because when you look
[52:41] at the New Testament and you see the
[52:44] Word Flesh and you see the word carnal
[52:46] it will be interchanged they will go
[52:49] back and forth for the exact same Greek
[52:52] word so it is sensual now we read it and
[52:55] we think well it's two different things
[52:57] well in one way it is and another way it
[53:00] isn't how many knows you've got the Holy
[53:02] Ghost and believe you've got it today is
[53:04] there a carnal element about every one
[53:06] of you that think you've still got the
[53:07] Holy
[53:08] Ghost you still got a carnal element you
[53:11] have to deal with yeah yeah me too but
[53:13] yet if we've truly got the Holy Ghost
[53:16] then the carnal mind that we had when we
[53:18] were in sin absolutely is dead it no
[53:23] longer exist
[53:26] because if it's not you will never be
[53:29] able to serve God you can never serve
[53:33] god with that carnal newos that you were
[53:37] born with it will not allow you it has
[53:41] such dominance in our life we can never
[53:45] overpower it with psychology you can
[53:48] absolutely look at your wrongs and your
[53:50] shortcomings and make up your mind I'm
[53:53] going to do this I'm going to quit this
[53:55] I'm going to stop that I'm going to do
[53:57] it and have every good intention you may
[53:59] have quotes and and and scriptures on
[54:02] your phone and you pull it up I'm going
[54:04] to do it I'm going to do it I'm going to
[54:06] repeat it I'm going to say it over and
[54:07] over again but if there's not a power
[54:10] within you that eradicates that nature
[54:13] it will overpower you every time because
[54:16] we cannot do it within ourself this is
[54:19] why Paul says it with such an emphasis
[54:22] and makes it absolutely emphatic that
[54:25] the carnal mind cannot be subject to the
[54:28] will of God and yet that's where many
[54:30] Christians are today they still have
[54:33] that carnal mind that thing that they
[54:36] were born with and they're trying to use
[54:38] that psyche and bring it to a state to
[54:41] make it subject to the word and you'll
[54:43] never do it you may subject it for years
[54:46] and years and eventually it will get
[54:48] tired of it and it'll buck up against
[54:51] the word of God and it'll say I'm sick
[54:53] of this I'm out of here I'm not I'm not
[54:55] doing this no more but you see if you're
[54:57] truly born again that old man's dead
[55:01] that force that was in you is no longer
[55:05] a force to be reckoned with because it
[55:07] is dead watch's this in a time of
[55:10] decision now he said we can't reason it
[55:12] out or study it we just only only model
[55:16] our minds up so when we try to reason it
[55:20] out and study it out it just muddles up
[55:24] our mind don't you love these Harvard
[55:26] terms mudel our minds and there's only
[55:30] one way to do it that is to have faith
[55:32] that God promises and God is able to
[55:35] perform and that settles it now watch
[55:38] that some of the things that the carnal
[55:40] mind will say a carnal mind wants God to
[55:45] bring the birthright down to their level
[55:49] so the carnal mind wants to bring the
[55:51] birthright now this is what so many of
[55:54] the preachers of this modern day have to
[55:56] do they have to compromise in order to
[55:59] have a following or a crowd they're
[56:01] going to have to compromise and bring
[56:04] the New Birth the birth right down to a
[56:06] level that you can still drink and have
[56:09] it you can still smoke and have it you
[56:11] can still be addicted to porn you can
[56:14] still be addicted to drugs now we've got
[56:17] Christian drug addicts and we got
[56:19] Christian drunks and we got Christian
[56:21] this and Christian that those words
[56:23] shouldn't even be used
[56:25] together come on now but what do they do
[56:28] it either that if they preach the truth
[56:30] they won't have hardly nobody to preach
[56:32] to because they cannot many of them
[56:34] preachers standing in the pull pit are
[56:36] not born again them themselves they're
[56:38] not born of the spirit of God any man I
[56:40] don't care what denomination he's in or
[56:42] if he's a message preacher if this word
[56:45] is not his father and his absolute he is
[56:48] not born again I don't care what he says
[56:51] I don't care how much he screams jumps
[56:52] runs hollers heals the sick even raises
[56:55] the dead if this word is not his father
[56:58] and his absolute he's not yet born of
[57:00] the spirit of God somebody
[57:03] said so the carnal mind then will reason
[57:06] a carnal mind wants God to bring the
[57:09] birthright down to their level but for
[57:11] me and I believe all true born
[57:13] Christians we meet it on God's level
[57:17] that that's where we want to meet it
[57:19] right but the carnal mind then wants to
[57:22] bring it down now if God will lower it
[57:24] and God one of course but the church's
[57:26] will in order to meet it and then of
[57:28] course they have to make all the excuses
[57:30] God understands why you can't live right
[57:32] God understands the age is so dark and
[57:35] it's just so wicked and so wretched and
[57:37] and nobody can live right anymore
[57:39] nobody's even got the Holy Ghost you
[57:40] know the sad part about it is that that
[57:42] crept into the message years ago and
[57:44] there was preachers that was preaching
[57:46] nobody had the holy ghost that were all
[57:48] waiting on it well it's evident a lot of
[57:50] them didn't have by the way they went
[57:53] but I believe there're still Sons and
[57:55] Daughters of God on the Earth today that
[57:56] have the same holy ghost that fell on
[57:58] the day of Pentecost but the carnal mind
[58:01] wants to bring it down then if God will
[58:03] lower his standard to the level of the
[58:06] carnal mind then the carnal mind has no
[58:08] problem then releasing that individual's
[58:11] body and letting them go to church and
[58:14] say well I'm a church member I belong to
[58:16] this church why because the standard has
[58:19] been lowered because the carnal mind has
[58:21] this built-in mechanism of self-defense
[58:24] it does not want to die it does not want
[58:27] to die because it knows there is no
[58:30] Resurrection to a carnal mind in other
[58:33] words it's that first nature that you
[58:35] were born with I I cannot imagine how
[58:37] awesome that it must have been in the
[58:39] Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve were
[58:41] there in the presence of God and day by
[58:43] day we don't know exactly how long they
[58:45] were there but father would come down in
[58:47] the evening and he would lay them down
[58:49] and he'd stretch out Adam's arm and he
[58:51] would lay Eve over on her arm and he'd
[58:53] say children how was your stay on Earth
[58:55] today Papa has come down to kiss you
[58:58] good night and the tiger and the lion
[59:01] and all the animals would come up in the
[59:03] garden and they would come up in the
[59:05] evening time to the Cathedral of trees
[59:07] and there the wind would begin to blow
[59:10] and the presence of God would come down
[59:12] on the pillar of fire would hang among
[59:14] the bushes and papa would come oh and
[59:17] they just sensed his being all around
[59:19] them they never thought anything about
[59:21] murder or death or sickness or gossip or
[59:24] lying or anything like that because they
[59:26] had truly the first round of the
[59:29] spiritual mind and then when they walk
[59:31] away from the program of God you see it
[59:34] wasn't just them that fell but since
[59:36] this planet here belong under man's
[59:38] jurisdiction that the planet of Earth
[59:40] fell we know it's groaning this very day
[59:43] Desiring to be clothed upon with its
[59:46] Millennium garments and then for the
[59:49] eighth day to be dressed for the city
[59:51] itself to come down and Adam not was on
[59:54] not only the only one that fell but the
[59:56] Earth fell the animals fell they a lion
[59:59] never looked at his sheep and looked at
[1:00:01] it as lunch you know a wolf never looked
[1:00:04] at a little lamb and looked at it as
[1:00:06] supper so when Adam fell everything
[1:00:09] under his jurisdiction fell with him and
[1:00:11] all of a sudden there was a carnivorous
[1:00:13] nature that begin to raise up in the
[1:00:16] lion in the cheetah and I've been there
[1:00:18] in the PLS of the serengetti and you
[1:00:20] watch them and there's something that's
[1:00:22] just as natural for them to kill as it
[1:00:25] is natural for us to be a human being
[1:00:27] where did that come from it was never
[1:00:30] there in the beginning it was never
[1:00:32] there for Adam to ever struggle with old
[1:00:35] age it was never there and when that
[1:00:37] image of God left him all the
[1:00:39] Supernatural part that went out and
[1:00:42] something else that moved in and you
[1:00:44] watch that carnal mind display and
[1:00:47] whenever the voice of God come walking
[1:00:49] in the garden in the cool of the day as
[1:00:51] it was and he said Adam Adam where are
[1:00:53] you and he said I I'm afraid I'm afraid
[1:00:57] and I hid myself I heard your voice in
[1:01:00] the garden who told you that you were
[1:01:02] naked have you eaten of the tree of
[1:01:04] which I told thee that thou should us
[1:01:07] not eat so there goes the spiritual mind
[1:01:09] from him and then this carnal mind
[1:01:12] self-defense excuses notice the first
[1:01:15] display of it have you eaten of the tree
[1:01:17] all the woman that thou gave me she's
[1:01:20] the one that done it then notice here
[1:01:22] comes a woman well it wasn't me exactly
[1:01:24] was the serpent he begal me and I did
[1:01:26] eat oh and the carnal mind starts
[1:01:30] defending and making
[1:01:34] excuses well don't sit there and look at
[1:01:36] me like Adam was the only one every one
[1:01:38] of us here today had the same thing and
[1:01:41] I do hope had is past tense for a lot of
[1:01:45] us but whenever we're born again then
[1:01:48] God
[1:01:49] projects his own mind a piece of
[1:01:53] intelligence
[1:01:55] from deity which makes us think
[1:01:59] different thoughts now we still have our
[1:02:02] own human mind and the human mind will
[1:02:06] still reason the human mind will still
[1:02:09] but God I don't understand why you do
[1:02:10] that Lord why why that that don't make
[1:02:12] any sense to me why would you do that
[1:02:15] but think of it those of you that have
[1:02:16] the Holy Ghost that is only your human
[1:02:19] noos that is not that thing that Adam
[1:02:23] gave you by the Fall
[1:02:25] now it's so similar they're
[1:02:27] twins and people will false identify
[1:02:31] that carnality left in their human
[1:02:33] element and they will talk themsel out
[1:02:36] of being born again and they'll sink I'm
[1:02:39] I'm not different because that still
[1:02:40] raises up it always will because it's in
[1:02:44] this the Greek word is SARS S a RX and
[1:02:48] it's to carnal sensual part of you your
[1:02:51] flesh still ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:02:54] come come on now your flesh still ain't
[1:02:55] got the Holy Ghost that's why you can't
[1:02:57] trust it it's an animal it's an
[1:03:02] animal is that right but yet the carnal
[1:03:06] mind watch brother R says one man could
[1:03:09] read Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:03:12] today and
[1:03:13] forever the carnal mind will say well in
[1:03:17] a way he
[1:03:20] is the spiritual mind will say in every
[1:03:24] way he
[1:03:26] is now the carnal mind then will say
[1:03:29] well sort of but he he don't do those
[1:03:32] things he did in the book of Acts he
[1:03:33] does in our
[1:03:35] church he does in lots of churches
[1:03:37] around the world that I know of but
[1:03:39] there are many many carnal matter well
[1:03:41] that was for the apostles and we don't
[1:03:43] need tongues anymore and we don't need
[1:03:45] Miracles anymore I beg to differ with
[1:03:48] that I think we need them now more than
[1:03:49] we've ever needed them we got more sick
[1:03:51] people we we need the power of God to
[1:03:53] transform don't we but the carnal man
[1:03:56] will say well yeah sort of I mean God
[1:03:58] you know I mean he can save people and
[1:04:00] he can do things but as far as Miracles
[1:04:02] and signs and wonders and things like
[1:04:04] that we've got doctors we do and then
[1:04:07] there and thousands and thousands of
[1:04:09] people are dying every day under the
[1:04:10] care of them doctors so the doctors do
[1:04:13] not have the perfect answer for
[1:04:14] everybody is that right so the carnal
[1:04:17] mind then will say now notice the carnal
[1:04:19] mind doesn't always say well there's not
[1:04:21] even a god some carnal minded people
[1:04:24] people will say well there is a God yeah
[1:04:26] there's a God and he can save but he
[1:04:28] can't heal wonder how come wonder how he
[1:04:32] can save you but he can't heal you after
[1:04:35] he saves you that makes no sense to me
[1:04:38] well he can save but he can't give you
[1:04:39] the Holy Ghost well I'm not sure if he
[1:04:41] can't give me the Holy Ghost if he can
[1:04:43] really save me the word saved is a great
[1:04:45] big word when you look at what all it
[1:04:48] involves and what it absolutely the
[1:04:50] miraculous thing that it does when it
[1:04:52] saves you it takes a a pretty big
[1:04:54] miracle for God to save a lost man or
[1:04:57] woman I figure if he can save me he can
[1:04:59] heal me if he can heal me in F me with
[1:05:01] the Holy Ghost if he can fill me with
[1:05:03] the Holy Ghost he can Rapture my
[1:05:06] body but the carnal mind will say well
[1:05:08] in a way he is but the spiritual mind
[1:05:10] will say in every way he is he gave a
[1:05:14] commission go into all the world preach
[1:05:16] the gospel to Every Creature these sign
[1:05:18] shall follow them that believe the
[1:05:19] carnal mind will say that was for the
[1:05:22] apostles so it lets you know we have
[1:05:24] some carnal-minded preachers in this
[1:05:26] message because there's carnal-minded
[1:05:28] preachers that say well we don't need
[1:05:30] that no more we're up here at the top we
[1:05:32] don't need it I'll show you where he put
[1:05:34] it in the Bible you show me where he
[1:05:36] took it out but carnal Minds still want
[1:05:39] to say the same thing the spiritual mind
[1:05:42] will say he's the same yesterday today
[1:05:46] and forever into all the world I am part
[1:05:51] of it how many can say you're part of it
[1:05:53] notice again he said now we find out
[1:05:55] these Revelations come and a man hears
[1:05:58] it he recognizes it to be God then he
[1:06:01] acts on it the carnal mind hears it and
[1:06:04] said
[1:06:06] foolishness
[1:06:08] foolishness and walk away from it so
[1:06:11] watch now so the carnal mind will still
[1:06:14] allow some people to be very religious
[1:06:17] so they get that carnal mind with this
[1:06:20] religious demon on them oh my goodness
[1:06:22] you talking about arguing Bible they
[1:06:24] love to argue the Bible they love to
[1:06:27] study it in order to try to trip people
[1:06:30] up to prove it he's the same yesterday
[1:06:32] today and forever and to prove that he
[1:06:35] has not changed and they get that devil
[1:06:37] on them Lord have mercy they'd be better
[1:06:39] off there's a drunk you can be able to
[1:06:40] get to them a whole lot easier than you
[1:06:42] can with that religious thing on them
[1:06:44] but yet notice he says the carnal mind
[1:06:47] shuns it because a carnal mind knows
[1:06:49] nothing about it no wonder the carnal
[1:06:52] mind doesn't know it listen
[1:06:56] because it's
[1:06:59] Satan do you understand what you had
[1:07:02] when you were
[1:07:03] lost the devil was in your soul oh the
[1:07:09] devil was in your mind yes sir God and
[1:07:14] the devil can't be in there at the same
[1:07:16] time so the carnal mind or the
[1:07:20] nature the
[1:07:22] soul but because it's Satan in the
[1:07:25] carnal mind then that must die and Satan
[1:07:28] is exposed and Satan does not want
[1:07:31] himself exposed so then after we're born
[1:07:35] again we have access then into the mind
[1:07:39] of
[1:07:40] Christ now when we get there then we
[1:07:43] start seeing things in a total different
[1:07:46] way we start believing things in a way
[1:07:48] that we can never believe with the
[1:07:51] carnal mind now we could be religious
[1:07:52] with a carnal mind go to church with a
[1:07:54] carnal mind believe in a heaven believe
[1:07:56] in a Hell believe in a devil believe in
[1:07:58] a God all of that with a carnal mind and
[1:08:01] yet never truly experience him in the
[1:08:04] new births now watch in Romans 12: 2
[1:08:08] Paul says be not conformed to this world
[1:08:11] but be ye
[1:08:13] transformed by the
[1:08:16] renewing of your mind renewing look at
[1:08:19] this word a renewal a renovation
[1:08:23] complete
[1:08:24] change for the better now remember we're
[1:08:28] not talking about your brain we're not
[1:08:31] talking about the cells and the brain
[1:08:33] matter in your skull but we're talking
[1:08:36] about the spiritual aspect that anoints
[1:08:39] your reasoning your thinking your
[1:08:42] mentality your perception your ability
[1:08:45] to judge between right and wrong look
[1:08:48] how dark it is look how dark it is
[1:08:51] people don't know if they're a man or a
[1:08:52] woman
[1:08:57] amen we're going to help buy some
[1:09:00] Bibles for a country in
[1:09:03] Africa some of the our believing
[1:09:05] brothers and sisters have never owned a
[1:09:07] Bible since they've been a Christian so
[1:09:11] we're working with brother Jeff
[1:09:13] Snodgrass and some other brothers so he
[1:09:16] called me one day this week and was
[1:09:17] telling me that they were trying to find
[1:09:20] some in the country there to see if we
[1:09:22] could save the Duty and all of that of
[1:09:24] buying it here because it cost a
[1:09:26] tremendous amount of money to do it so
[1:09:28] he contacted a Bible Society there in
[1:09:32] that country one of the brothers there
[1:09:33] that we're working with and he got back
[1:09:35] with brother Jeff and told him that this
[1:09:37] Bible society is changing their versions
[1:09:41] of the
[1:09:42] Bible and they're making the version of
[1:09:45] their Bible gender
[1:09:49] neutral so I told him I said I am not
[1:09:51] interested in buying no body no gender
[1:09:55] neutral Bible Well he said I knew you
[1:09:57] wouldn't he said we wouldn't either now
[1:09:59] can you imagine so they're so-call
[1:10:02] Christians and they're printing these
[1:10:04] Bibles and handing them out in these
[1:10:07] countries of Africa and I know this side
[1:10:09] it's an international society and they
[1:10:12] are handing them out all over the world
[1:10:14] now many of these people that don't know
[1:10:16] the difference are going to pick this up
[1:10:18] and read this because they've never had
[1:10:20] a Bible in their Liv so they're going to
[1:10:22] read this and and they're going to think
[1:10:24] in their mind well you mean God is
[1:10:26] neither a man or a woman and uh he and
[1:10:29] her and she and him and all that we're
[1:10:31] not going to read that no more that
[1:10:33] ain't going to be there now we're not
[1:10:34] talking about a story book we're not
[1:10:37] talking about Cosmopolitan magazine or
[1:10:39] Hot Rod Magazine or something like that
[1:10:42] we're talking about God's
[1:10:44] word and yet so-called Christians are so
[1:10:49] spineless and it becomes such cowards
[1:10:52] you're preaching with me this morning
[1:10:54] I'm going to lay her down they have
[1:10:56] become so puny and so weak come on
[1:11:01] somebody and they ain't nothing but a
[1:11:04] bunch of Barnyard chickens and they're
[1:11:07] scared to death to tell the truth and
[1:11:10] preach the truth my God is Not neutral
[1:11:15] my God is a he and his bride is a she he
[1:11:21] made an Adam and an eve
[1:11:24] male and female created he them and
[1:11:28] called their name
[1:11:31] [Applause]
[1:11:42] Adam so someone from our church went
[1:11:45] through seven
[1:11:48] Brew to get a
[1:11:51] drink the other day
[1:11:54] and there was this thing that was
[1:12:00] there well to the individual that went
[1:12:03] through that looked like a Hy to them so
[1:12:07] they identified it as a
[1:12:09] hym but that
[1:12:11] shim wanted them to know that was not
[1:12:15] its
[1:12:17] pronoun that's not my
[1:12:22] pronoun now don't get quiet I me they've
[1:12:25] done seen your face on these cameras you
[1:12:27] might as well say Amen they know you're
[1:12:29] here they've seen your
[1:12:31] cars some of y'all was going to start
[1:12:33] Waring false faces to church ain't you
[1:12:35] be Hall Halloween every day of the
[1:12:37] year that's where we're coming to
[1:12:39] friends why carnal and then you've got
[1:12:42] theologians and you've got Deans and the
[1:12:44] religious college and the our our
[1:12:46] Administration that's in the White House
[1:12:48] they're blotting this out and we can't
[1:12:50] say he no more and she no more and him
[1:12:53] him no more and her no more speak for
[1:12:56] yourself I'm going to say he I'm going
[1:12:59] to say she I'm going to say him I'm
[1:13:03] going to say her my God ain't no pervert
[1:13:06] and I ain't no pervert come on somebody
[1:13:10] I've got the ability to discern right
[1:13:13] from wrong and I've got the ability to
[1:13:16] tell a difference between a man and a
[1:13:22] woman
[1:13:26] dear Jesus who is that
[1:13:30] for notice this the prophet says we have
[1:13:33] faith in our heart the faith of God in
[1:13:36] our heart and we can see it
[1:13:38] clear it becomes a
[1:13:42] faith then we speak
[1:13:44] it and it comes into existence
[1:13:48] amen because the mind of
[1:13:51] Christ is in the m
[1:13:54] man that's what makes healings and so
[1:13:57] forth when you get that perfect
[1:13:59] Revelation you just what you're doing
[1:14:02] then you know how to
[1:14:06] walk now do we miss it many times of
[1:14:09] course we do y'all ever felt the Lord
[1:14:11] spoke to you about something and it
[1:14:14] proved out it wasn't the Lord after all
[1:14:17] go ahead go ahead come on be bre be
[1:14:19] brave there you go there you go how many
[1:14:22] times have we heard people say the Lord
[1:14:24] told me this and the Lord told me that
[1:14:26] well you know what sometimes we don't
[1:14:27] know if the Lord did or didn't but we
[1:14:29] can be able to tell if it comes to pass
[1:14:31] or if it doesn't come to
[1:14:33] pass so that element is always there
[1:14:36] that's the scary part about the
[1:14:38] supernatural because the supernatural
[1:14:40] will push you out into a realm that
[1:14:43] sometimes it's uncharted waters and you
[1:14:47] don't have a scripture for it and you
[1:14:49] don't have one against it so you really
[1:14:51] don't know and Satan loves that realm as
[1:14:55] well as God does but every Born Again
[1:14:58] child of God wants to be Supernatural
[1:15:01] how many wants to be a supernatural
[1:15:03] spiritual daughter of God Son of God we
[1:15:05] do we want to walk in the realm of the
[1:15:07] spirit but there's an element of fear
[1:15:10] that goes along with it why because
[1:15:12] Satan himself is an angel of Light
[1:15:15] therefore it is no great thing that he
[1:15:16] can transform his ministers as Ministers
[1:15:19] of righteous so you mean the devil has
[1:15:21] got preachers way more than God does
[1:15:24] actually it don't take near as many for
[1:15:26] God to do more than what the devil can
[1:15:28] ever do so the devil has to have more
[1:15:30] and he still can't do the the negative
[1:15:32] effect of what God can do with a handful
[1:15:34] in a positive side well I wish somebody
[1:15:37] would say Amen but you see there's an
[1:15:40] element there that whenever we get the
[1:15:42] mind of Christ and God projects
[1:15:44] something to us and we really feel like
[1:15:47] it's the Lord but we can always check it
[1:15:49] remember the prophet said when you feel
[1:15:51] led to do something check it with the
[1:15:53] word make sure it's you that you're
[1:15:55] called to do it and you're the one
[1:15:56] that's supposed to do it and all that
[1:15:58] and he said then put it with the word
[1:16:00] and consult your pastor amen well praise
[1:16:04] the Lord that's what he said now notice
[1:16:06] in proof of the Resurrection before this
[1:16:08] certain thing called the new birth ever
[1:16:10] happens to the man he cannot go away at
[1:16:13] all to understand or either ever
[1:16:16] understand God or have any knowledge of
[1:16:19] God though the word speaks it his mind
[1:16:24] can't comprehend it so the word speaks
[1:16:28] it and he can read it right there in
[1:16:30] black and white and read the literal
[1:16:32] words of Jesus and read and he can
[1:16:35] actually read it but his mind I just
[1:16:39] don't understand it I I just I just
[1:16:41] can't get it I
[1:16:42] just he just can't do it until God
[1:16:46] begins to work on that Soul that's right
[1:16:50] now watch he says his mind can't
[1:16:52] comprehend it because it's a human mind
[1:16:55] he's got to have the mind of God in him
[1:16:58] to understand Godly things see so all
[1:17:01] the reading all the schools all the
[1:17:03] teachings as good as they may be yet
[1:17:05] that's not the real principle yet the
[1:17:08] human mind is an enemy to God you've got
[1:17:12] to get out of your own human mind and be
[1:17:16] born a new by the Holy Spirit and get
[1:17:19] the mind of God in you then you you can
[1:17:23] believe those things then it
[1:17:26] becomes a reality now that's
[1:17:28] intellectual faith that will work in the
[1:17:31] human mind it will allow you to believe
[1:17:33] a certain element about God but if
[1:17:36] someone talks you into it someone else
[1:17:38] can talk you out of it but if God ever
[1:17:41] birs his mind think of what he does he
[1:17:44] not only takes his chemistry of his
[1:17:46] blood and cleanses out our sin and
[1:17:48] absolutely annihilates it all but he
[1:17:50] takes that sinful nature out that we
[1:17:52] were born with which is associated with
[1:17:54] your mind your psyche and removes that
[1:17:57] and puts in the very mind of God and he
[1:18:00] can project to you visions and
[1:18:04] Revelations and Supernatural elements
[1:18:07] it's a communication that only the
[1:18:10] initiated share right years and years
[1:18:13] ago in the wars they had what they call
[1:18:15] the code talkers how many knows are I'm
[1:18:17] talking about the code talkers so the
[1:18:19] Navajo the Navajo was some of the most
[1:18:22] famous ones and the naval hold they had
[1:18:24] their own language and then they was
[1:18:26] able with the military to develop this
[1:18:28] language and it was called Cod talk now
[1:18:31] of course what the Germans would try to
[1:18:32] do they would try to catch up the
[1:18:34] frequencies of the Americans and the
[1:18:36] Americans would do exactly the same
[1:18:37] thing for them and everything they tried
[1:18:39] to use and they would try to say things
[1:18:41] in such a way we're going to move this
[1:18:43] Battalion over here and you know the Air
[1:18:45] Force is coming in this way and that way
[1:18:47] and the Germans would pick it right up
[1:18:49] and they'd be ready well the Americans
[1:18:50] did the same thing of course so they
[1:18:52] develop the C- talkers so the c-t
[1:18:55] talkers would get on the radio and they
[1:18:57] go to talking in
[1:19:00] tongues well that's what it would sound
[1:19:01] like to the Germans anyway so they was
[1:19:04] actually talking in a language and the
[1:19:06] person that had the radio on the other
[1:19:08] end they knew exactly what they were
[1:19:10] saying and the Germans are scratching
[1:19:12] their head trying to figure out what in
[1:19:14] the world are they talking about and
[1:19:16] they never did never they never listen
[1:19:20] to me they never did break
[1:19:23] that code they never did figure it out
[1:19:26] as a matter of fact some of those Navajo
[1:19:28] men that did that are just now getting
[1:19:30] their due respect and reward for what
[1:19:32] they did because there was lots of lives
[1:19:35] that were saved because of it and helped
[1:19:37] turn an element of the war because of
[1:19:39] that and God developed code talking
[1:19:42] before the foundation of the world so
[1:19:45] God knew what Satan would do so God
[1:19:47] developed a way by which he would be
[1:19:49] able to talk to his own by means of
[1:19:52] Revelation and Satan he knew would be
[1:19:54] able to read the Bible don't you
[1:19:56] understand why God stripped Revelation
[1:19:59] and why he stripped the spirit from the
[1:20:01] letter of the word the letter kill us
[1:20:03] but the spirit maketh alive so if the
[1:20:06] letter if the letter alone would have
[1:20:08] everything you need every devil in hell
[1:20:11] can live the way they want to live then
[1:20:12] before the end time comes they'll pick
[1:20:14] up that Red Letter Bible put it under
[1:20:16] their arm walk right in the gates
[1:20:18] because they've got the truth right
[1:20:19] under their arm but they know that Bible
[1:20:21] better than any of will ever know it as
[1:20:24] far as knowledge but they don't have the
[1:20:27] proper radio for code talking Oh Glory
[1:20:32] so whenever they hear it they don't
[1:20:35] understand it it makes no sense to them
[1:20:37] and they see you and I changed by the
[1:20:39] power of God and they can't understand
[1:20:41] how could we be changed we were born
[1:20:44] like everybody else look at everybody in
[1:20:46] our family look at the way they turned
[1:20:48] out you should have been the same way or
[1:20:50] worse but you're not why you you
[1:20:53] received your own personal receiver
[1:20:55] called predestinated seed that gave you
[1:20:58] the ability when father spoke your name
[1:21:02] something inside of you woke up and said
[1:21:05] yes my Lord yes my Lord what is it you
[1:21:08] responded to the code talking oh
[1:21:11] Hallelujah that was wonderful when that
[1:21:13] happened but that was just the beginning
[1:21:16] of your code talk language as a matter
[1:21:18] of fact the code come back to you to get
[1:21:21] Sanctified and then the code come back
[1:21:23] to you to get the Holy Ghost and then
[1:21:25] the code come back to you that there was
[1:21:27] a message in the land brought by a
[1:21:30] prophet of God come on somebody let's
[1:21:32] have church this morning I don't mind
[1:21:35] telling you the real elect of God are
[1:21:37] still here in code talk and they are
[1:21:40] responding to the code talk and the code
[1:21:43] talk saying don't go there don't go here
[1:21:46] don't get caught up in that and those
[1:21:48] that have the receiver said yes sir

[1:22:00] exactly and before long we're going to
[1:22:03] receive another message
[1:22:05] Hallelujah and the dead in Christ which
[1:22:08] were also part of the code talker are
[1:22:11] going to rise from the dead and we which
[1:22:15] are alive and REM remain will hear from
[1:22:18] the Cod talk and we will be changed in a
[1:22:22] moment

[1:22:45] couldn't understand it Jesus said you're
[1:22:49] mine you're my seed I I chose you before
[1:22:53] the world
[1:22:54] begin have no fear I'll never leave you
[1:22:59] and I'll never forsake
[1:23:01] you and the devil said I don't know what
[1:23:03] it was I had him talked out of going to
[1:23:05] church I had him pump talked out he
[1:23:07] wouldn't want to serve God no more and
[1:23:09] that little old buzzer went off on that
[1:23:10] funny looking radio that he carries down
[1:23:12] inside of his soul Hallelujah and I he
[1:23:16] must have got some kind of message cuz I
[1:23:17] seen that frown turn upside down and I
[1:23:20] seen a smile come on her face and I said
[1:23:23] her get up go ahead and iron her clothes
[1:23:24] and say well I think I'll go ahead and
[1:23:26] go to church and I said oh no I didn't
[1:23:28] think she was going to church today

[1:23:33] talker Hallelujah why they've got the
[1:23:36] ability to hear from
[1:23:41] heaven and they don't just hear it
[1:23:43] through the
[1:23:46] preacher they hear it through their own
[1:23:51] soul
[1:23:56] you have to move your thoughts you have
[1:23:59] to move your sinking get away from
[1:24:03] reason and move your thoughts from your
[1:24:07] own way of thinking to what God thinks
[1:24:11] let the mind that was in Christ Jesus be
[1:24:13] in you then when you begin to think his
[1:24:15] thoughts you'll begin to live his
[1:24:19] life oh my Lord
[1:24:24] so when you begin to think God's
[1:24:27] thoughts you begin to live God's
[1:24:35] life should I reckon God
[1:24:38] is living in a world of
[1:24:42] depression
[1:24:44] sadness nobody loves me poor
[1:24:49] me we'll never get no higher until we
[1:24:53] get out of our

[1:25:20] Lord teres will get back at it again but
[1:25:23] I begin to look at some of the stuff
[1:25:25] that the Lord had given me to write down
[1:25:27] I thought oh my Lord this ought to bring
[1:25:29] a Revival to a bad this much less a real

[1:26:04] ever does he'll never be able to stop
[1:26:07] this predestinated bride she is the word
[1:26:12] you cannot stop the
[1:26:15] [Applause]
[1:26:21] word

[1:26:25] mouthful I just
[1:26:27] said ain't my
[1:26:31] SS I would have never said that a few
[1:26:34] years
[1:26:35] ago until I got my

[1:27:24] you have to get away from your reason
[1:27:26] move your thoughts from your own way of
[1:27:28] thinking to what God thinks oh my you
[1:27:32] begin to think his thoughts you begin to
[1:27:33] live his life and do the things he
[1:27:36] did you see what I mean now because it's
[1:27:40] not you it's
[1:27:41] Christ we cannot alter God's word we
[1:27:44] have to alter our
[1:27:47] thinking to his
[1:27:51] thinking
[1:27:53] I still think too much like a
[1:27:56] Reagan you still think too much like a
[1:27:58] Martin a
[1:28:00] gillus a Palmer A
[1:28:03] Smith a
[1:28:05] Weber come on
[1:28:09] somebody I want you to notice he doesn't
[1:28:11] say God Alone will do this but we have
[1:28:15] to alter our thinking let the mind of
[1:28:20] Christ be in you then you'll think like
[1:28:24] he
[1:28:27] thinks praise God you've got to
[1:28:31] completely Surrender Your Own thoughts
[1:28:34] your own will your own mind and let the
[1:28:38] mind of Christ operate in you now when
[1:28:40] you notice you do think Christ would the
[1:28:43] mind of Christ in you would say the days
[1:28:45] of Miracles is passed do you think the
[1:28:47] mind of Christ and you would say the
[1:28:49] Bible's right in some places and not in
[1:28:52] others the mind of Christ would sanction
[1:28:55] every word that Christ ever
[1:28:59] said
[1:29:01] amen now there's human faith and there's
[1:29:03] the faith of God and you must have Godly
[1:29:06] Faith to believe now then to have Godly
[1:29:09] Faith you must have the mind of Christ
[1:29:11] in you that's how God
[1:29:15] projects how many knows what a projector
[1:29:20] is okay you're looking at the effects of
[1:29:22] two of them right
[1:29:25] here right there's
[1:29:27] one over there's the other one a
[1:29:33] projector the screen does not have the
[1:29:35] ability to put those words upon
[1:29:37] itself there's another one right back
[1:29:40] here so the brothers control it from
[1:29:43] their computer there which I send them
[1:29:45] these quotes scriptures images whatever
[1:29:49] I want them to project
[1:29:53] they downloaded I sent it to Jackie
[1:29:56] Tipton Michael Bailey audio
[1:30:00] support and Dawning just in case they
[1:30:02] all lose
[1:30:03] theirs so we all get it every
[1:30:08] service then they upload it to the
[1:30:11] computer so you can be able to read it
[1:30:14] there and it comes from this projector
[1:30:18] now there's a line of course that's tied
[1:30:21] into it
[1:30:23] but if I put up a b CDE E F G H I J K L
[1:30:27] M N O P that's what you're going to
[1:30:30] see if I put up a a picture of the
[1:30:33] Eiffel Tower that's what you're going to
[1:30:38] see so it comes from the
[1:30:41] head to the
[1:30:43] head through the
[1:30:45] Machinery to the body amen and the body
[1:30:49] can sit there and say m m m boy that is
[1:30:55] so good man that is some kind of good
[1:30:59] eat you know that brother B said a horse
[1:31:02] eating Clover that you go to church and
[1:31:04] I mean you're just having to sat there
[1:31:05] there and wipe your mouth from the Holy
[1:31:07] Ghost slobbers that's around he say Lord
[1:31:09] that is so rich that is so good I'm tell
[1:31:13] you what my daughter Lista she makes
[1:31:15] some of the best desserts you ever ate
[1:31:17] in your entire life but them things are
[1:31:19] so rich oh my goodness you about go in a
[1:31:22] sugar shock whenever you eat them but
[1:31:24] they are really good oh that's the kind
[1:31:27] of word I want to be able to feed you
[1:31:29] all I don't want to just high dose you
[1:31:31] on sugar I want some protein I want some
[1:31:34] nutrients I want some vitamins I want
[1:31:36] some things that you need you'll be able
[1:31:38] to walk out of here and say where'd that
[1:31:40] devil go anyhow where'd that devil go we
[1:31:43] want to be able to leave this place
[1:31:46] charged by the power of God not just
[1:31:48] while we're here but when we walk out of
[1:31:51] there we're armed and ready we are
[1:31:55] soldiers because it's been
[1:31:58] projected Amen to
[1:32:03] us now then to have Godly Faith you must
[1:32:06] have the mind of Christ in you that's
[1:32:08] how God
[1:32:10] projects to you
[1:32:13] Visions
[1:32:15] Revelations I mean he's got a revelation
[1:32:17] of the serpent
[1:32:19] seed it wouldn't make no difference what
[1:32:21] doctor of theology what preacher anybody
[1:32:23] else tried to talk you out of it the
[1:32:26] father projected it to you and you may
[1:32:30] have read Genesis 3 for years and years
[1:32:32] but one day it came through the proper
[1:32:33] Channel and it was projected right there
[1:32:36] in your walkie-talkie and all of a
[1:32:37] sudden it just opened up so I'm like
[1:32:39] glory to God that serpent seeds of the
[1:32:41] devil I say glory to God it sure
[1:32:44] is the doctrines a revelation from God
[1:32:46] but the serpent seed is definitely of
[1:32:48] the devil I mean literally of the devil
[1:32:51] could they take that away from you how
[1:32:53] can these people that's walked away from
[1:32:55] the message in the last several years
[1:32:56] done what they've done I'll tell you why
[1:32:58] the father never projected it to their
[1:33:01] soul they read it in a book and somebody
[1:33:03] else talked them into it and somebody
[1:33:06] else talked them out but if it's a
[1:33:08] revelation there ain't enough devils in
[1:33:10] hell to get it out of you the Devil
[1:33:12] Himself could not get it if he
[1:33:15] aggravated you every day you'd look over
[1:33:17] him and say get on back down to hell
[1:33:20] I've done been projected by the power of
[1:33:22] God I've got a built-in screen I've got
[1:33:25] a built-in receiver you can't have my
[1:33:29] [Applause]
[1:33:42] Revelation I wonder how many of you the
[1:33:45] Satan has tried his best to steal it
[1:33:48] from
[1:33:50] you Jesus looked at Peter that day and
[1:33:52] said Simon
[1:33:54] Simon Satan has desired to have you that
[1:33:58] he may sift you as
[1:34:01] sweat sift you as sweat but I have
[1:34:05] prayed for you that your Fai will not
[1:34:09] fail and when you are converted
[1:34:13] strengthen your
[1:34:15] brethren well I guarantee one thing if
[1:34:17] Jesus PR prayed for Peter I'd say he's
[1:34:19] mentioned my name a few times
[1:34:22] I'd say brother Rob he's mentioned you
[1:34:23] I'd say sister s's mentioned you brother
[1:34:25] D's probably mentioned you I'd say more
[1:34:27] than likely everybody in this building
[1:34:28] today the Lord Jesus has called your
[1:34:30] name Hallelujah aren't you glad we've
[1:34:33] got a high priest right there before the
[1:34:35] presence of God father father give them
[1:34:38] strength send the angels of God dispatch
[1:34:40] them down to you and be able to project
[1:34:43] to you that Revelation and through all
[1:34:45] the storms it holds on through all the
[1:34:48] sickness it holds
[1:34:50] on
[1:34:52] I got a thing from one of my Minister
[1:34:54] friends not long ago and said brother
[1:34:55] Donnie the devil wasn't just after
[1:34:57] sister Erica's house he was after her
[1:35:01] faith I thought yeah that was it and he
[1:35:04] said not only hers but
[1:35:07] yours but he said through this whole
[1:35:09] thing she was faithful as I mentioned to
[1:35:12] you the other day lances on the same
[1:35:14] floor down the hospital Elizabeth and
[1:35:15] where Erica was in a room directly
[1:35:18] across the aisle from where Erica was
[1:35:20] and where Erica left us from that room
[1:35:23] and I thought oh Lord why did I have to
[1:35:25] be why did I have to
[1:35:26] be but I don't know how many nurses has
[1:35:29] come into the room where he's been s
[1:35:31] there telling him how they were affected
[1:35:33] by Erica's life I took the girls down
[1:35:36] there to see him the other day and two
[1:35:37] of them come in and standing there
[1:35:38] crying one lady said she had been in
[1:35:40] medicine for 28 years and hadn't cried
[1:35:42] for
[1:35:43] nobody until she met
[1:35:46] Erica I thought praise God a life lived
[1:35:49] by the word is the word word expressed
[1:35:52] not a preacher not a deacon and some of
[1:35:54] you saying well I've never done nothing
[1:35:56] from God live a life by the word you are
[1:35:58] doing what demons cannot do you don't
[1:36:01] have to be a preacher Sisters You Don't
[1:36:03] Have To Be A preacher young people let
[1:36:06] God live his word out of you let God
[1:36:09] project to you visions and Supernatural
[1:36:11] something another and you are doing
[1:36:14] something that great people socalled
[1:36:17] will never be able to touch amen amen
[1:36:21] yes Hallelujah yes
[1:36:24] sir you cannot keep your Same
[1:36:28] Spirit you cannot keep your same
[1:36:32] habits you cannot keep your same
[1:36:35] thoughts you got to die you got to die
[1:36:38] like he died you got to die on The Altar
[1:36:40] like Abel did with his lamb if you
[1:36:42] haven't heard this sermon you must be
[1:36:44] born again in Ohio 1961 it's awesome
[1:36:47] it's absolutely awesome youall to listen
[1:36:48] to it again he died you've got to die
[1:36:52] die on his
[1:36:55] altar like Abel did with his land you've
[1:36:58] got to die with your
[1:37:01] lamb Abel died with his
[1:37:05] lamb you've got to die with
[1:37:09] yours Christ
[1:37:14] Jesus you've got to die got your own
[1:37:16] thinking to be born
[1:37:19] born to his thinking
[1:37:22] always Marvel I don't think science yet
[1:37:25] even to this day has figured it
[1:37:28] out how that some people can go into a
[1:37:32] coma I heard of a few of them in Co and
[1:37:36] they went into a coma and say they spoke
[1:37:39] English and they come out of the coma
[1:37:43] speaking
[1:37:45] French they didn't know one word of
[1:37:47] French well maybe go see McDonald's and
[1:37:50] say French for
[1:37:53] but here they come out and they're
[1:37:56] you've heard of that haven't you people
[1:37:57] going into a coma and then all of a
[1:37:59] sudden they come out and it's like they
[1:38:02] don't know one more word of
[1:38:04] English but something happens when they
[1:38:07] were
[1:38:08] out and they come to
[1:38:11] speaking another language
[1:38:16] right and you think how is that even
[1:38:18] possible that a person would get this
[1:38:21] vocabulary in their brain and speak it
[1:38:24] fluently I'm not someone saying french
[1:38:26] fry and crepe and leaning Tire of pizza
[1:38:29] and you know this and but they come out
[1:38:32] speaking fluent language so you imagine
[1:38:35] a person
[1:38:37] dying they are the altar of
[1:38:40] Christ and they
[1:38:44] die and they come back to life
[1:38:47] again and they raise talking code
[1:38:53] talk they rais talking God
[1:38:58] talk I'm a Christian I'm a Believer I
[1:39:02] love the Lord Jesus people say I never
[1:39:05] thought I'd ever he hear him say that
[1:39:07] I've heard him say the name of Jesus
[1:39:08] before but it wasn't that way wow I
[1:39:11] never thought I'd ever what in the world
[1:39:13] happened to him he died and woke up
[1:39:16] speaking another language he died and
[1:39:19] when he come to he was so different
[1:39:21] because the mind which was in Christ
[1:39:24] Jesus come in him
[1:39:26] there is the
[1:39:33] soul you got to think his thoughts the
[1:39:36] word of God always attracts the
[1:39:38] spiritual mind because it is the mind of
[1:39:40] Christ in
[1:39:41] you that knows that the word is true one
[1:39:44] this we're going to have to be one with
[1:39:47] him let the mind that was in Christ be
[1:39:49] in you then Christ his own mind in you
[1:39:53] will recognize every
[1:39:56] word that he wrote this is why people
[1:39:59] can
[1:40:00] dissect well I believe this part I I
[1:40:03] believe John
[1:40:04] 3:16 I sure a't taking that acts 238
[1:40:07] well then Christ is not in you cuz
[1:40:10] Christ in you knows acts 238 is the
[1:40:12] words just like John 3:16 here praise
[1:40:14] the Lord not it let the mind that was in
[1:40:18] Christ is that what the Bible said the
[1:40:20] mind that was in Christ me in you what
[1:40:22] kind of mind did he have stay with the
[1:40:26] word spoken words original see the mind
[1:40:29] that's in Christ in you the mind's in
[1:40:31] Christ and you will take the word just
[1:40:33] like he did because he was the word
[1:40:36] paragraph page 97 paragraph 5 let your
[1:40:39] walks your talks your moves everything
[1:40:41] you do be in the word of God let the
[1:40:43] mind of Christ come into you that'll
[1:40:46] pregnate you with the word if you if you
[1:40:51] don't let the denominational mind come
[1:40:53] in you you become denominational
[1:40:54] pregnated if you let the mind of Christ
[1:40:57] come in you he can't deny his own
[1:41:00] word CU he's
[1:41:02] God now remember when he's studying for
[1:41:04] this sermon spoken words Original Seed
[1:41:07] and the spirit of God spoke to him and
[1:41:09] said pick up your pen and
[1:41:14] write you believe whatever you wish to I
[1:41:16] believe it's the same author that told
[1:41:18] Paul to pick up his
[1:41:23] do you brother
[1:41:25] Jonathan I love this here is the
[1:41:30] secret the word is in the
[1:41:33] bride and the mind of Christ to know
[1:41:38] what he wants
[1:41:40] done with the word she does it in his
[1:41:47] name she
[1:41:49] has the th
[1:41:51] saith the
[1:41:54] Lord don't you understand friend many
[1:41:57] message people have got the word for
[1:41:59] this day but it's evident they don't
[1:42:02] have the mind they don't know what to do
[1:42:05] with it they argue they fuss they debate
[1:42:08] they make Cults out of it I understand
[1:42:10] why some people look at some of the
[1:42:12] message far and say them people ain't
[1:42:13] nothing but a cult I understand I'll
[1:42:15] call some of them a cult cuz that's what
[1:42:16] they
[1:42:19] are why they get the word but they don't
[1:42:22] get the right mind so they look at it
[1:42:24] and they read it and they put their own
[1:42:26] Thoughts with the message and then they
[1:42:27] come up with all this ult
[1:42:30] ideas but the bride not only gets the
[1:42:32] books and the tapes she gets the mind to
[1:42:36] know what to do with the books and the
[1:42:38] tapes so the real bride members of
[1:42:41] Christ they don't get the books and the
[1:42:42] tapes and say well I don't need to go to
[1:42:43] church no more I don't need a pastor no
[1:42:45] more they're missing the mind of Christ
[1:42:48] if you get the books and the tapes and
[1:42:50] then and you hear the prophet say say
[1:42:53] what the tapes say not push play what
[1:42:55] the tapes play but say what the take
[1:42:59] come on somebody and that ain't just for
[1:43:01] the preacher that's for you to say what
[1:43:03] the tape
[1:43:07] say
[1:43:08] oh let the mind that was in Christ be in
[1:43:11] you if that same mind's in there with
[1:43:13] the same power that's in
[1:43:15] there you'll do the same works that he
[1:43:18] did let the mind of Christ being in you
[1:43:21] and it molds the
[1:43:23] character of a Son of
[1:43:27] God just listen a minute how can we have
[1:43:29] the mind of Christ that was in him and
[1:43:32] then deny the things he commissioned us
[1:43:34] to
[1:43:35] do how can we place miracles in the
[1:43:40] past
[1:43:42] amen when the very Christ himself was
[1:43:46] God and God in you in the presence of
[1:43:52] God Amen there's
[1:43:55] always
[1:43:57] miracles is that right brother Paul in
[1:43:59] the presence of God there is
[1:44:03] always
[1:44:05] miracles let me find a place some wind
[1:44:09] down in the seventh seal now remember
[1:44:12] this is the Eighth
[1:44:14] Day The Eighth Day of the seal series
[1:44:19] last service
[1:44:21] he's been the presence of God
[1:44:24] Alone each angel came each day with a
[1:44:28] revelation of the mystery of that seal
[1:44:31] which was made known only unto
[1:44:34] them is't that awesome can you imagine
[1:44:38] how awesome it must have been on the day
[1:44:40] when the seven seal is going to be
[1:44:44] opened and he sees his own
[1:44:47] Angel no longer Paul Luther Wesley
[1:44:51] yeah
[1:44:53] right well I'll give you something to
[1:44:55] think about anyway at least some of you
[1:44:56] wait
[1:44:57] now the seventh angel held the mystery
[1:45:01] of that seven seal that one angel that I
[1:45:04] looked at had notable look about
[1:45:06] remember I told you had his wings all
[1:45:08] stuck out that one notable Angel the one
[1:45:12] that meant more to me than all the
[1:45:13] others the thing I've wondered about my
[1:45:17] whole
[1:45:18] life what was it The Mystery of the
[1:45:21] seventh seal he had an attachment to the
[1:45:25] seventh seal head he didn't mention
[1:45:26] about the first second third fourth
[1:45:28] fifth six but he wondered about the
[1:45:31] seventh seal his whole life why his
[1:45:35] radio was tuned for the seventh
[1:45:39] age amen aren't you glad yours is too
[1:45:43] look friend let's just face the fact
[1:45:44] that's what's wrong with some of these
[1:45:45] people around the message they're radio
[1:45:47] a ready tuned for the 7th e they're
[1:45:49] tuned for some Pastor some somewhere
[1:45:51] they're tuned for some preacher on the
[1:45:52] internet I'm so glad mine is tuned to
[1:45:54] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 1-7
[1:45:58] come on somebody I tell you one thing as
[1:46:01] long as I'm alive and in my right mind
[1:46:03] and the pastor of this church I'm still
[1:46:05] going to preach the value and the
[1:46:07] importance of God's Prophet Messenger to
[1:46:09] this age we need to hear what he said we
[1:46:12] need to say what he said it's going to
[1:46:15] be what he said that's going to build a
[1:46:17] rapturing faith in our souls and get us
[1:46:20] out of
[1:46:24] here so here he's nearly beside himself
[1:46:28] by the eth day he answers questions that
[1:46:31] morning and answers them wrong you know
[1:46:33] he just beside himself and somebody
[1:46:35] called it and and he called it one of
[1:46:37] them and then so he just talks about
[1:46:39] this the pray leaving up to this
[1:46:41] paragraph 35 and he's talking about
[1:46:43] being weary and being the presence of
[1:46:44] God and he said may I just pass this to
[1:46:48] you when the supernatural
[1:46:51] comes
[1:46:52] in that's the mind of
[1:46:56] Christ and you become so far
[1:47:00] away from your own
[1:47:03] thinking to your own
[1:47:06] mind you'll see those marks I put there
[1:47:08] because he went on down to explain it a
[1:47:10] little bit more and he said he tried to
[1:47:11] explain he said well just just let me
[1:47:13] not not try to explain it because it
[1:47:16] can't be
[1:47:18] explained so when the the supernatural
[1:47:21] comes
[1:47:23] in there's the mind of
[1:47:26] Christ let's
[1:47:30] stand let's jump down to the next quote
[1:47:32] here Brothers Let's skip these
[1:47:33] scriptures are in Ephesians
[1:47:35] 4 we'll pick it up again we r on next
[1:47:39] time we buried that first
[1:47:42] nature that first nature is gone now we
[1:47:45] are in the nature of
[1:47:47] him he lives in us we don't do our own
[1:47:52] will we do his will we don't think our
[1:47:55] own
[1:47:56] thoughts the mind the mind is what
[1:48:01] thinks the
[1:48:03] mind that was in Christ
[1:48:06] Jesus is in every
[1:48:09] believer
[1:48:11] there
[1:48:12] there is the
[1:48:17] soul there is
[1:48:21] the
[1:48:22] soul what is the soul tells us over and
[1:48:24] over again the soul is the nature of
[1:48:27] your spirit so he said your body didn't
[1:48:30] die your spirit didn't die but your
[1:48:34] soul
[1:48:39] died I've quoted that to y'all for years
[1:48:41] don't get so
[1:48:44] quiet your
[1:48:46] soul which was the nature of your spirit
[1:48:51] you see some people have the marriage of
[1:48:53] the Lamb an invisible
[1:48:55] Union they have it that God took that
[1:48:58] old nature and that old soul and saved
[1:49:01] it washed it cleaned it all up and made
[1:49:05] it
[1:49:07] new he could never say about that old
[1:49:10] soul that you never sinned in the first
[1:49:14] place
[1:49:16] right right but there was a seed laying
[1:49:19] there a soul of God which was in God
[1:49:23] before the foundation of the
[1:49:27] world that's from your Prophet messenger
[1:49:30] now a soul of God that was in God before
[1:49:33] the foundation of the world so you must
[1:49:36] bring that own nature LED on the altar
[1:49:38] of God with your sacrifice and the
[1:49:41] spirit of God comes down and kills that
[1:49:45] nature and then a phoenix transpires
[1:49:51] then that new nature that seed which
[1:49:53] laay there dormant for years for decades
[1:49:57] sometimes it caught the breath of
[1:50:04] life that's the part that when he refers
[1:50:07] to you never did it in the first
[1:50:12] place it wasn't that you were just
[1:50:15] forgiven you were forgiven of that old
[1:50:16] life yes but that old nature is dead de
[1:50:22] annihilated gone
[1:50:25] forever now remember that nature in a
[1:50:28] sense was feminist gender I can see why
[1:50:31] Satan wants to go that way because it
[1:50:34] messes up the whole program of
[1:50:38] God so God projected a part of his own
[1:50:43] self that little C genan of you you were
[1:50:46] in his
[1:50:47] thinking you see when I was born J ju
[1:50:50] the 9th
[1:50:51] 1956 and whenever I took the breath of
[1:50:53] life I don't know how long it was of
[1:50:55] course I didn't know my mama before that
[1:50:56] time but I know she was a sweet lady
[1:50:58] when I knew
[1:50:59] her according to what we're taught in
[1:51:01] the message of there Mama must have got
[1:51:02] a little bit
[1:51:03] sweeter cuz that little Angelic body was
[1:51:06] hovering around
[1:51:08] Mama waiting for this human Tabernacle
[1:51:11] to be born of a union between Dawn and
[1:51:14] Betty
[1:51:16] Reagan I went along been born a little
[1:51:20] Reagan a little
[1:51:22] Heathen didn't know nothing about God
[1:51:24] but didn't go to
[1:51:25] church but one day Mama went to church
[1:51:28] and I could see something happened to
[1:51:30] Mama daddy drove stock cars and daddy
[1:51:32] lived like any normal Center you know
[1:51:34] drink smoke and this and that and the
[1:51:35] other you don't want nothing to the
[1:51:38] church so I seen mama and I know there's
[1:51:40] something different about us I didn't
[1:51:42] know how to pray so I went to Mama and
[1:51:43] asked you you've heard me tell this many
[1:51:45] times mama how do you pray so my uncle
[1:51:48] was having a rival at his church church
[1:51:50] and I went and I got down to the Altar
[1:51:53] and I began to
[1:51:57] pray they told me I had to be baptized
[1:51:59] so I said
[1:52:00] okay so we didn't have a baptistry but
[1:52:02] we went down to the it was a lake they
[1:52:06] broke the ice CU it was in January it
[1:52:08] was real shallow and they busted the ice
[1:52:10] baptizing me in
[1:52:14] titles but the little
[1:52:17] seed started heavenward
[1:52:22] I come from trinitarian to Jesus only
[1:52:26] back to I'm not sure then back to Jesus
[1:52:28] only then I was all over the map many of
[1:52:31] us had the seven Church ages written in
[1:52:32] our whole life didn't
[1:52:36] we but one
[1:52:39] day one
[1:52:43] day I was making a radio broadcast for a
[1:52:47] preacher that I worked for
[1:52:52] and I did the intro and the outro and
[1:52:54] then I would play part of his sermon so
[1:52:56] I'd say you know so and so and so this
[1:52:58] is so and so and you know here's this
[1:53:00] and this now you'll hear a fiery sermon
[1:53:02] preach about so and so and you know and
[1:53:04] then I would click into the sermon and
[1:53:06] let it play around 12 12 and A2 minutes
[1:53:07] something like that and I noticed some
[1:53:11] books above his little desk though where
[1:53:14] I was working and I reached up and
[1:53:17] picked one of them out this man theme
[1:53:20] song was he was more than a
[1:53:23] man I finally figured out where that
[1:53:27] come
[1:53:29] from but I still had some Pentecostal
[1:53:32] tradition and I was a proud Pentecostal
[1:53:35] preacher so Carol was already reading
[1:53:38] the books and listening to the tapes and
[1:53:39] so was
[1:53:45] Harry and they saw it before I did I
[1:53:47] said I I'll pray about it I'll think
[1:53:49] about it you you know all right yeah
[1:53:51] okay I I'll I'll pray about it I'll pray
[1:53:53] about it but one day God said today is
[1:53:56] the day and he pull back the veil from
[1:53:59] that
[1:54:00] seat I said praise the Lord I shouted I
[1:54:04] jumped I run I spoke in tongues I done
[1:54:06] all that in Pentecost but let me be
[1:54:08] honest with you I never had in my soul
[1:54:11] what I do
[1:54:12] now I couldn't have been born under the
[1:54:15] message of Malachi 4 under Leo Dean
[1:54:18] preachers right and neither were
[1:54:21] you I'll tell you when some of you got
[1:54:23] it when you got under the ministry of A
[1:54:25] God Called man ministering Malachi four
[1:54:28] and that's when you truly got born again
[1:54:33] amen and when that
[1:54:35] happened the mind of
[1:54:38] Christ came
[1:54:41] inise Lord don't want don't you want to
[1:54:43] live this way don't don't you want this
[1:54:46] to be your guidepost so you you think
[1:54:49] this way you talk this way you're a code
[1:54:53] talker and you pull what you do through
[1:54:55] the word you pull everything about you
[1:54:58] through the
[1:55:00] word because you can trust it how many
[1:55:03] knows we can't trust oursel we still
[1:55:05] can't even trust this because this still
[1:55:07] ain't don't have it this will argue with
[1:55:10] God I've told you before every
[1:55:12] controversial sermon that I've ever
[1:55:14] preached I've known in myself if I do it
[1:55:17] I'm going to get in trouble I've known
[1:55:19] if I do it there'll be all kinds of
[1:55:20] friends that'll leave me are going to
[1:55:22] blce me this this and this I've got
[1:55:24] enough
[1:55:26] sense to know that but the soul says
[1:55:30] you're going to obey you or you're going
[1:55:31] to obey the spirit of God
[1:55:35] right you know from my past record which
[1:55:37] one I obey right hey that's what we want
[1:55:41] to be all of our
[1:55:43] records let the mind of Christ get in
[1:55:46] you it will Empower you to overcome from
[1:55:50] every devil of Hell
[1:55:54] amen right sister
[1:55:58] suy it's bar
[1:56:03] it
[1:56:07] hallelujah oh Lord
[1:56:15] Jesus how many would like to be
[1:56:17] remembered
[1:56:18] today
[1:56:20] maybe there's some here today and
[1:56:22] you know you love the Lord Jesus with
[1:56:25] all of your heart but maybe you've just
[1:56:28] never stepped into that
[1:56:30] yet some of you might have the Holy
[1:56:33] Ghost in your
[1:56:34] spirit now remember brother Brenham says
[1:56:37] that Elvis Presley had the baptism of
[1:56:41] the Holy
[1:56:43] Ghost he said I know his mother and his
[1:56:48] Pastor he Incorporated he was an
[1:56:50] Assembly of God he Incorporated the
[1:56:54] shouting and the dancing of Pentecost
[1:56:56] into the rock and roll music and it went
[1:56:59] over with the world and took them by
[1:57:01] storm but actually he learned that
[1:57:04] shaking in church oh
[1:57:07] my and he brought it to thousands and
[1:57:11] thousands of young
[1:57:12] people introducing with others rock and
[1:57:16] roll and he had the baptism of the Holy
[1:57:21] Ghost for those who were close friends
[1:57:23] with Elvis Pressa after every
[1:57:26] concert they'd either gather on the
[1:57:28] stage when everybody was gone or Gather
[1:57:31] in his hotel room the Stamps Quartet
[1:57:34] worked with him I've heard some of them
[1:57:35] talk about
[1:57:37] it and he would always sing religious
[1:57:40] songs How Great Thou Art Amazing Grace
[1:57:45] on and on and
[1:57:47] on but his soul is birth right and his
[1:57:51] gift to the
[1:57:55] devil how
[1:57:57] sad how
[1:58:01] sad so we want more than
[1:58:04] that oh may you today if you're standing
[1:58:08] here with a baptism in your
[1:58:10] spirit may you just how do I do it
[1:58:13] brother Don it's quite simple
[1:58:16] really from the control tower of your
[1:58:18] soul
[1:58:20] open up your soul and let God move from
[1:58:24] your spirit and step into the
[1:58:28] realm of your
[1:58:31] soul so a person could be baptized by
[1:58:35] the Holy Ghost in their
[1:58:37] spirit and it never be in their soul
[1:58:40] just like when me or any of these
[1:58:42] brothers baptize people in this
[1:58:44] baptistry and we will put our hand to
[1:58:46] nose you've seen it done many times our
[1:58:48] hand over their nose and
[1:58:50] mouth if every Inlet to their body is
[1:58:52] closed no water will go in their body
[1:58:56] but they were
[1:58:59] baptized oh
[1:59:01] friends let's just make
[1:59:03] sure let's just make sure that we're not
[1:59:06] trying to do it
[1:59:09] ourselves let God step into your
[1:59:13] soul how do you look at the word how do
[1:59:15] you judge everything by Feelings by
[1:59:18] emotions do you judge imp partially you
[1:59:21] judge one way and then if it's your best
[1:59:23] friend you judge another way oh that's
[1:59:26] not the mind of Christ the mind of
[1:59:28] Christ would judge everything by the
[1:59:31] word of
[1:59:33] God hallelujah
[1:59:37] hallelujah father while we stand here in
[1:59:39] this awesome
[1:59:44] presence may this be the day that some
[1:59:47] of
[1:59:48] them
[1:59:50] for the first
[1:59:51] time will
[1:59:53] die on The
[1:59:57] Altar we realize in this world it comes
[2:00:00] down to two categories of
[2:00:04] people those who are born
[2:00:07] once those who are born
[2:00:11] twice those who are born once miss the
[2:00:16] Rapture go to the tribulation period
[2:00:20] and bombs are in the hangers today with
[2:00:24] our names written on
[2:00:27] them oh Jesus hide us
[2:00:31] father hide us Lord God under the covert
[2:00:35] of thy
[2:00:37] wings oh I
[2:00:40] deny as it was when the angel of death
[2:00:42] moved to the land of
[2:00:45] Egypt only your people who had obeyed
[2:00:48] the word
[2:00:50] Mercy was not given just because they
[2:00:52] were Jews Mercy was not given because
[2:00:56] they even lived among the
[2:00:57] Jews but because they obeyed The
[2:01:00] Prophet's command from
[2:01:03] God take the blood take
[2:01:06] hisp put it over the door roast the lamb
[2:01:09] eat it with bitter herbs they had to
[2:01:12] follow that
[2:01:14] message to the letter they couldn't
[2:01:17] leave out this one leave out that one I
[2:01:18] don't think we need this I don't think
[2:01:20] we need that if they did they perished
[2:01:23] with the unbelievers and the prophet
[2:01:24] tells us the last plague that will hit
[2:01:27] the earth before the Rapture of
[2:01:29] course is spiritual
[2:01:34] death people are dying in the masses
[2:01:38] Lord
[2:01:40] dying and what's so sad is it's striking
[2:01:43] message churches too they're letting go
[2:01:46] of this teaching of the messenger and
[2:01:48] that one and another and
[2:01:50] another help us Lord God that we'll hold
[2:01:54] on to it with everything we are
[2:01:57] father and never let it
[2:02:01] go oh
[2:02:03] Jesus we worship you
[2:02:07] father We Worship You Lord
[2:02:11] God we bless your name
[2:02:16] father in the name of Jesus
[2:02:20] can we just raise our hands in the
[2:02:22] presence of the king now let the Lord
[2:02:24] let the Lord just deal with your heart
[2:02:26] each of
[2:02:27] you there's not a question in my mind
[2:02:30] that many of you have already passed
[2:02:31] from death into
[2:02:33] life but for some of you being a pastor
[2:02:35] I have to
[2:02:37] wonder knowing that you're up and down
[2:02:39] and in and out and this and that oh
[2:02:42] children I'd be less than a servant of
[2:02:44] God if I wasn't honest with you today
[2:02:46] and tell you the
[2:02:47] truth some of you holding grudges in
[2:02:50] your heart and can't forgive
[2:02:53] people how can the Holy Ghost dwell in
[2:02:55] your soul and you not forgive the way
[2:02:58] Jesus did but it's hard Brother Don I
[2:03:01] believe me I know it's hard I know it's

[2:15:16] thank you Lord we worship you father oh
[2:15:20] hallelujah thank you Lord God we worship
[2:15:24] you Lord part of our rights we'll get
[2:15:26] into it maybe in a week or so part of
[2:15:29] our rights as the people of God is that
[2:15:32] we have been called into a new order of
[2:15:37] priesthood not only are we the temple of
[2:15:40] God but we serve in that Temple as
[2:15:45] priests as priests
[2:15:48] we bring
[2:15:50] sacrifices one of the prophets of the
[2:15:52] Old Testament said that we would come to
[2:15:54] the Lord with
[2:15:56] words and he also said that we would
[2:15:59] come with the Cales c a l v s
[2:16:05] calves of our
[2:16:08] lips so a calf of course was an offering
[2:16:11] of the Old Testament but you imagine
[2:16:13] Hosea seeing it so many years ago and
[2:16:16] saw that there would come a time that
[2:16:17] people would come into the presence of
[2:16:20] God and the sacrifice that they would
[2:16:22] offer God would be like a burnt offering
[2:16:25] in the Old Testament and it would simply
[2:16:27] come from the calves of their
[2:16:31] lips so your lips today are
[2:16:34] calves but which you can raise and open
[2:16:36] your mouths and say Lord Jesus I love
[2:16:40] you I praise you I adore
[2:16:44] you I worship you
[2:16:49] what a privileged people we are can we
[2:16:52] do that before we go let's change it
[2:16:54] Harry sing something go in another
[2:16:56] little Direction there let's just
[2:16:58] worship him
[2:17:00] now we don't have a bloody Ram or a lamb
[2:17:03] to bring to him a turtle dove or a
[2:17:05] pigeon but these hands at one time held
[2:17:08] beer cigarettes whatever more filth of
[2:17:11] the world today they are washed and
[2:17:13] cleansed and now we can raise Them Up In
[2:17:15] The Presence of Jehovah
[2:17:19] our lips which at one time spoke words
[2:17:21] that should never be uttered out of a
[2:17:22] human's
[2:17:24] mouth now we can lift up praise and
[2:17:28] adoration and worship and God accepts it
[2:17:33] as from the priesthood of
[2:17:37] MDC praise God every one of you men
[2:17:40] women boys and girls are a priest unto
[2:17:45] the presence of
[2:17:46] God We Worship You
[2:17:49] Jesus as a priest father I stand here
[2:17:52] before my fellow
[2:17:55] priests we have come to the house of God
[2:17:59] today I have fulfilled the scripture of
[2:18:02] Romans chapter 12 verse 1 I beseech you
[2:18:06] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[2:18:09] that you would present your bodies a
[2:18:11] Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable
[2:18:15] unto the Lord I don't believe I'm the
[2:18:17] only one I believe others have come here
[2:18:19] for the same purpose today so we give
[2:18:22] our bodies as a Living
[2:18:25] Sacrifice we raise our hands our lips we
[2:18:30] let your spirit flow through our bodies
[2:18:32] our lungs take in the breaths that you
[2:18:35] gave us and push out words of Praise
[2:18:40] from the calves of our lips will come
[2:18:43] Divine
[2:18:45] adoration only you
[2:18:48] know how to really adore
[2:18:52] you we would approach it in a carnal
[2:18:54] means every time but if we can let the
[2:18:58] mind of Christ be in us we'll worship
[2:19:01] different than we've ever worshiped
[2:19:05] before CU it'll be deity inside of us
[2:19:09] worshiping
[2:19:11] deity oh Jesus we worship you today
[2:19:16] Father we bless you Lord how many he
[2:19:20] wants to present your body as a
[2:19:24] sacrifice the fruit of your lips as a
[2:19:28] sacrifice brother Donnie I don't feel
[2:19:30] like it I don't have much joy that'll
[2:19:32] make it a greater sacrifice for you then
[2:19:35] let it be a real sacrifice oh it can be
[2:19:39] so a sacrifice when it comes from a
[2:19:42] burdened heart it ain't hard to praise
[2:19:44] him from a joyful heart but when a heart
[2:19:47] is so burdened and so troubled and the
[2:19:50] body is so Afflicted and so sick and
[2:19:53] then when you offer praise you talking
[2:19:55] about a
[2:19:56] sacrifice up in the presence of
[2:19:59] God oh David said it this way in the
[2:20:02] Book of
[2:20:03] Psalms let my prayers be as the evening
[2:20:09] incense so Lord God our worship our
[2:20:12] praying Our Praise once we become
[2:20:15] priests of this new order
[2:20:17] it goes into a different
[2:20:19] realm people may look at concerts and
[2:20:22] they think well we're doing exactly the
[2:20:24] same thing they are not
[2:20:26] exactly not
[2:20:29] exactly most of them are worshiping from
[2:20:31] the outer court if they're even then
[2:20:33] that
[2:20:34] far but the bride your sweetheart is not
[2:20:38] worshiping from the outer Court we're
[2:20:40] worshiping from the inner
[2:20:43] sanctum we've walked in behind the veil
