sister Sharon many of you know them the couple that's been coming over from over in Hendersonville North Carolina V being a part of our assembly his father passed away suddenly I believe on Thursday or Friday and they're just uh just very very very shocked by this and they're asking that we would remember those folks in prayer as we pray today also Fred Jones a good friend of ours is going to be

requests the Lord knows all about also we wants to want us remember her son Davey he's asked for us to pray for his boss's son Jared Pritchard he has cancer so we want to remember that prayer request today as we pray all the unspoken prayer request I know there's many needs in our assembly but let's come all these things unto the Lord Brother Joel if you take us to the Lord in prayer this morning buddy B hearts and heads Heavenly Father what a friend we have in you and when we go through these things and we hear of these circumstances among others Lord we know that we have confidence in our friend and I love how the prophet places it Lord he makes it such that our relationship with you is even closer than friendship he says that God wants to come down and be buddies and so father we can share things with buddies not that we wouldn't necessarily with friends so much but Lord we bring these needs unto you and we just know that you will meet them Father according to your will and purpose and when we don't understand father when we have to scratch our heads when the doctor turns and walks the other way and says there's nothing more that can be done and even when it seems like even within ourselves there there's no more that we can pray and we don't even know how to pray at times Lord you come on the scene and you move and these are not just words that we speak these are not just fairy tales that we read about but we serve a true and the Living God and that same God you yourself came and began to dwell in this Humanity these old frangible Dusty devilish frames in which we live father you chose to live in these bodies and so father May the words that you've spoken Lord may we take them Upon Our Hearts and speak to these needs Lord if we know these individuals may we find an opportunity in place that we can go lay our hands upon them or speak a word to them Father that would bring encouragement and even healing bring Victory and bring deliverance and bring encouragement father this this is what we've called been called to do in this age not just to come to church and hear words father from a man that's preaching but Lord we're to take these words that's our identification and these things are real to us and so father may we be put on display and may we have these opportunities father we look for what you're going to do in this service today may all thoughts that are unlike you be moved out of the way may all purposes all plans Lord we don't even know if we'll walk out of the building today so while we're here we're going to glorify you we're

death and hell he did defeat there's a promise coming down that dsty road well their Wonder turned to mocking when Jesus did speak he said your daughter's not dead she's just asleep and then he turned to the unbelievers and he told them all go home they heard him say leave me and death alone then he laid his hands upon the child he looked death right in the eye he said all power of Heaven and Earth belong to me and with a voice that sounds like thunder he HED at the Sun and then he said little child rise and be healed there's a promise coming down that dusty road and from his holy hands healing

know him and he knows he's faithful today faithful we're so grateful for that thank you Lord I'm so glad he's been faithful when I've not he's been faithful when you have not but he cannot deny himself so that's what we're grateful for he cannot deny himself so if he puts a deposit of himself in us he cannot deny that we greet you today in the name of the Lord certainly welcome you to the house of God the visitors that are here with us we welcome you into our gates let's turn to the Book of Revelation if you would Today Chapter 1 verse4 read a couple of places in the in the scripture I've been speaking about the bride's Bill of Rights and I I'd like to pick up again today by the help of the Lord on the right to a spiritual priesthood as the elect of God Revelation 1 ver4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins I love this in his own blood and has made us Kings and Priests now remember we don't deserve it there's nothing we could do to ever gain it but he has made us this himself made us Kings and and priest unto our God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen Revelation 5 verse 9 as John picks up again about the priest and this is after the lamb now has opened the book after The Lamb opens the book tears the seals off then this is what takes place in heaven and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth God hasten the day that'll happen how may like to be remembered today as we pray God bless you let's hold our request in our hearts before the Lord Lord Jesus we count it such a privilege that we could be gathered here today already sensed your presence and for that we're so thankful we realize Lord that as Mortals one day we're going to have to stand before you we're have to give an account for our life every day every hour every moment that we've lived help us I pray father that we will realize when we stand before for you that day many of the things now that take up so much of our time will be absolutely worthless we would have will wished so desperately we would have taken more time for the things that really matter for those that stand before the white Throne every thought every wrongdoing every evil will Flash before them by then there'll be no mercy so while there is Mercy now father we want to ask you forgive us forgive us of our failures forgive us of our shortcomings help us that we can be more in love with you than we've ever been in our entire lives help me today Jesus to get out of the way speak the word to our hearts we present our needs to you now father we commit the service to you in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you you may be seated it was actually God who instituted the priesthood in the Old Testament to give his people a goet the priesthood would bring sacrifices from the people into God's presence because every Jew was not allowed to go directly into the presence of God God allowed them to build a tabernacle and then a temple God's presence came and Sanctified those two places and made their sacrifices and their offerings acceptable the people would stand on the outside while the priest was on the inside doing this work of reconciliation and Redemption for them but the priests themselves were not any more qualified than the people were unless they came through a process to make them fit to stand in the presence of God they were first called by God the tribe of Levi and then they were also anointed by Moses at the time and they were sanctified IED or set apart for a man to walk in there even though he was a levite without being anointed he would die without being set apart Sanctified he would die so when we come to the New Testament and then we look at What the Lord Has Done to start a church a bride a new kingdom a new order of a different type of priesthood a priesthood that will not offer Pascal Lambs or a bulock or an incense or trespass offering but we will offer ourselves we will offer the fruit of our lips we will raise our hands and offer that to God we will bring him so many things but none of them are for sin or for atonement but unless we also are anointed Ed and consecrated our offerings are not received so it's not like that we just bring it to God and God is so desperate that God will just take anything and everything that people give him no he won't either he will only take that which meets his strict requirement and that is it must come from priests that have been set apart and set aside and Sanctified but they also need to be anointed but how do they become anointed well he crushes the lily of the valley and the rose of Sharon and he releases the perfume out of the life of the only sinless one that ever lived on the earth after the fall he sends that back upon us and anoints our lives to where that what we do is mixed with the fragrance of the Pascal lamb even our prayers uh I know you Bible readers know this that our our prayers have to be mixed with incense in order for him to receive them it has been said that prayers are like little children going out into the flower garden or the wild flowers and they pick the yellow and they pick the red and the white and the pink and maybe the fuchsia but at the same time they'll pick some weeds because weeds also will flower their mother meets them at the door and whenever they bring these flowers to their mother and their mother being wiser than they are able to look and see but this is poison and this is not really acceptable and the mother sorts through the flowers as they bring them and she separates them you understand that our prayers Before the Throne of God many times when we pray we have selfishness we have arrogance we have pride we have an objective that isn't quite right before the Lord how is it that God accepts our prayers they are mixed with incense and the incense goes in with our prayers and blends the aroma to where the weeds of selfishness and self-pity and all of that we pray don't sit there and look at me and tell me you don't do that and how in the world can God then receive our prayers and our prayers be as if it was the Lord Jesus himself praying it's the incense that makes up for what we lack and our temporary understanding aren't you grateful for that watch's this in the Messiah the prophet said God called Messias God called us and we become Kings and Priests unto God like Jesus was God's high priest and we become a lesser priest Jesus was God in fullness dwelt in him to shine forth the expression of God to the world for God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and as God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself God comes into his church and anoints him some Messiahs amen Messiahs oh my do you see it the same things he did in his church the same power he had in his church his church becomes his Dominion he is King over his dominion and we are Kings and Priests offering listen to this now spiritual sacrifices to God the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name oh my amen there you are Messiahs Messiahs little Messiahs little anointed ones anointed off of what the main one anointed off of the great one so if we're not Anointed God cannot hear our prayers if we're not Anointed God will not receive our worship we could say the name of Jesus and oh Lord I worship you I praise you I adore you I exalt your name but if we're not Anointed with the anointing of the day you see Jesus said in Mark chapter 7 how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men so you can imagine millions of people have gathered today in churches all around the world and they've worshiped and they've sung and they believe with all of their heart they they have worshiped and praised God and God has received that worship but he has not unless they're preaching the right thing cuz you said Jesus said how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men so you mean our worship is either accepted or rejected based upon the doctrine that we believe and teach so when we teach for Doctrine the Commandments of men our worship is a complete waste of time you might as well be singing jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way oh but we say the name of Jesus I don't care if you do say the name of Jesus it's only accepted when it's revealed it's accepted through the revealed word of the hour you see that is the name of God the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God for the word name in the Old Testament actually is shim which means reputation traits characteristics of the person you're identify amen so God then has him a church as he did 2,000 years ago he has one today and they are anointed to be able to not only carry out his work cast out Devils heal the sick do all the great things that he did but they're anointed to worship him to praise him they will worship Him in spirit and in truth read with me in Exodus 28:41 and thou shalt put upon the them upon Aaron thy brother and his sons with him now he talking about the Holy garments that only the priests could wear and thou shalt anoint them and consecrate them and sanctify them that they may Minister unto me in the priest's office now look what happens they are anointed they are consecrated and they are Sanctified so they couldn't just walk in with any type of clothes that they wanted they couldn't just pick out their favorite perfume that they wanted they had to be Anointed with a special concoction that was made by the Apothecary that had five different elements given by Divine proportions by which they were anointed in other words we'd say it like this in this day the fivefold ministry five aspects of the oil so much of Cal so much of this so much of myrr they couldn't pick even their own concoction it had to be exactly the way God described it a fifth of this two fifths of that one tenth of that a fifth of this put it all together and then mix all that together and it produced this phenomenal type of aroma so you had no no question about knowing when a man was a priest because when he come out from the presence of God even without his miter and the heod and all that on him he had a smell about him that you knew he'd been in the presence of God you see we don't want to just have enough religion that makes us feel good when we're here on Sunday morning we want to be able to walk out these doors and have the smell of Jesus Christ on our lives that people will know there's something different about them people if we don't have that we're not a success notice now in Leviticus 8 verse 10 and Moses took the anointing oil and Anointed The Tabernacle and all that was therein and Sanctified them how can wood and gold now remember a lot of the wood was chatim wood there was gold which represented deity silver which represented silver blue which represented the Heavenly there was a color from the mollusk there was all these different colors that were Blended together so it was elements of the Earth the metallurgical value the gold the silver the brass and all that the copper come from the Earth part of it come from the sea part of it come from trees part of it come from insects what was God doing pulling from botony Life pulling from all these Elements of Life to give a place to worship him so how could a little a silicus which was a little tiny bug that lived on the oak tree very very rare and they would catch this only the female could do this and they would take the body of the female and they would squeeze this out of her body and it would produce one drop of this dye this dye then in turn was used to be able to dye part of the garments and part of the color of the Tabernacle so God would allow them to take an insect there was a mollusk which came from the Mediterranean and they would take it and grind the shell and be able to mix another color so what's God doing pulling from botney Life pulling from Oceanic life pulling from human life taking the badger which is a very rotten mean animal and God pulling from all these different Avenues and bring it all together and you've still got all this element that is not holy how's a holy God ever going to get in that place cuz he had to Sanctified amen with with what with what part with blood part with oil and the rest Spirit there's two types of sanctification deity type and human type now watch in Leviticus 8:10 and Moses took the anointing oil and Anointed The Tabernacle and all that was there in and Sanctified them and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar notice how many times seven times and Anointed The Altar and his vessels notice now the gender that he gives to the Tabernacle it was a hymn his vessels both the labor and and the labor also identified his foot to sanctify them so what are they doing consecrating sanctifying how can you take take gold and make it holy for God there's a process now how are we then ever going to be able to present our bodies since our bodies are unregenerate now no matter how much Holy Ghost you've got in your soul your body is still according to what the prophet taught us whenever you see a man priest potent a prophet he said he's born between Satan and Eve Satan and Eve so our bodies are hybrid is that right yet Paul tells us in Romans 12:1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you would present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable before the Lord which is only your reasonable service how can my flesh ever be considered to be holy how could your flesh brother Joel ever consider to be holy that God himself would look at it cuz my body don't have the Holy Ghost my soul does my soul has been redeemed but how can my flesh when Paul goes on to say that we would lift up holy hands but how how can I ever reach a state of Hol and sanctification in my body that my body will be holy to God I've got the answer in front of me you want to know it might take me a little while to get to it notice again in Leviticus 8:12 and he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him so he's pouring this anointing on now remember specific oil specific elements specific measurement word word word commandment commandment command commandment obedience obedience obedience and then when the obedience is rendered it produces a product which can actually take a mortal man and he walk in there and become Anointed with this oil and it transforms him into a holy priest amen amen glory to God than I told you the other morning the Lord I got up out of bed and I was fixing to start the day and the Lord spoke to me and gave me something this is it so you see there's a sanctification that the Lord does and then there's actually one that we do now it takes both actually to make us acceptable and the one that God does we can't and the one we're supposed to he won't the one that he's supposed to do we cannot do and the one we're supposed to do he will not do you read with me in Exodus 29:42 this shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your Generations at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord where I will meet you to speak there unto thee and there I will meet with the children of Israel and the Tabernacle shall be Sanctified by my glory amen now watch it was Moses that anointed the priest and they were Sanctified by an order of obedience to the Commandments of God but it was them that Sanctified them but what's going to sanctify now the building and the Tabernacle it's actually going to be Sanctified by the shakan glory of God so you mean then God could come in a building say like this this sheet rock come from the same place that other buildings were made out of so it could be a honky tonk or a bar or a you know a school building or whatever so this this sheetrock didn't come from some Holy Ghost fil place where all holy ghost fil people made it and all holy ghost fill people worked on this building there's some that did and these panels here they come from a place where uh they manufacture panels for auditoriums and all types of things and this carpet was made in the same place these W these trees this all these different things it's here so what we say this is a holy Place well what makes it holy it's not the stone the piano made by Yamaha that that one there we didn't order a particular holy Yamaha piano and a particular Fender holy guitar and a particular holy apartment for Rolland only makes holy drums for Holy Rollers that set of drums could wound up playing rock and roll music same with that piano but we say but this is a holy place so what makes it holy His Glory Hallelujah and the Tabernacle shall be Sanctified by my glory look at the word Sanctified to consecrate prepare dedicate be Hallowed be holy be separate to be set apart be treated as sacred so how many of you would bring your biscuits and gravy and your sausage and your bacon and your cup of coffee and your hot chocolate and your donuts and all that in here to church with you this morning and set there and eat it anybody well you have no problem doing that at home right you could sit outside in your car and do that you you'd be okay with that and then you go walk right out of these doors go through the hallway that come out on the other side into the fellowship hall and we sat right there yesterday we ate food we talked we drank we had Fellowship why that is built for a separate purpose this is hallowed for the preaching of the word for the sick being healed for the Lost being saved praise the lord it's the way we consecrated the building it's the way we dedicated it and the purpose we consecrated it for for us to just come a a a little distance and bring that same food out of that building and to bring it in here why we would feel terrible we would feel awful in doing so why because of the way we built it of the way we consecrated it and the purpose of is don't you understand your flesh is no different than your brothers your sisters your mam your daddies that don't even believe this word but yours is consecrated for a special service to almighty God hallelujah you come from the same lump of humanity that your father and your mother and your siblings and your aunts and uncles but you brought your body to the house of God to dedicate it to the service of Adonai amen now notice what God said that he would do Exodus 2944 and I will sanctify the Tabernacle of the congregation and the altar I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons now Moses and God both must perform an act of sanctification on the priesthood God will do his part but he wasn't going to do Moses part so Moses had to anoint them actually Moses based the priests before Moses would dress them he bathed them can you imagine how humiliating for them priests they said Moses we've been taking bath since we were little guys but they needed to be bathed under the administration of the Prophet that's why some of the message preachers stink real bad they refuse to be Washed by the Water of Malachi 4 and when a message preacher gets to the spot he thinks he don't need the message message no more you watch him start preaching stinky doctrines you watch him turn into a stinky preacher and have a stinky Church come on somebody I don't know about every other man of God here in this place today I still need to be washed by the purity of the teachings of Malachi 4 I hope I never get so big in my own mind that I think I don't need it I've lost my mind when I do so Moses then would bathe him brother Joel then Moses would close them and put the garments on them again how humiliating that they they themselves had bathed himself and dress himself for years and years but this was God's instruction God was making the priesthood and in one sense of the word bow to humility to the higher office above them I know some of our preachers are ashamed to quote the prophet anymore but you're looking this morning at one that is not ashamed of the message of Malachi 4 I'm not ashamed to tell you where I get it from I'm not ashamed to tell you I am anointed with the anointing of the last day years ago I was a Pentecostal preacher and that's the anointing I had on me but I've got a different anointing on me now it's a Rapture anointing it's an Elijah anointing it's a translation anointing it's a Rapture Revelation oh Hal Hallelujah Revelation 10 anointing anybody here with me today now notice God says I will sanctify the Tabernacle of the congregation and the altar I will sanctify both Aaron and his sons to minister to me in the priest's office the garments they could have them on that was not enough they could have the oil on that was not enough don't you understand what one of the things that separates the bride from the church that the church can have anointing of blessings oh the Lord blesses us and we've got this and we've got that and we're growing and we're doing this that and other sure that comes from just having part of the blessings of the Lord but we don't want just blessings we want life I don't want just the gifts I want the giver my focus give me the giver and I get every gift he's got come on somebody give me the giver I get everything I have need of Hallelujah notice now number again chter 8:1 17 for all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine both man and beast on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I Sanctified them for myself now watch what God did while death is striking all the land of Egypt God is performing a work of sanctification and the firstborn are being sanctified ified by the smearing of the blood over the door the token of course and then going through the rituals of eating the lamb and the bitter herbs so while people are dying people are being Sanctified while people are being killed the firstborn of all the land of Egypt but God said now this is what I'm going to do from this day forward the firstborn of all of Israel belong to me and I sanctify them to myself so then you could either take your son to the Tabernacle and give him a service to the Lord or you could redeem your son that also transferred over uh to your animals and you could redeem them animals or you could bring them to the priesthood so God had a set value on a donkey you remember the prophet talking about that little donkey and she give birth uh to a little old ugly thing and that little old thing come out of there standing there bowlegged standing there and his ears all flopped down but he said that Mama was really taught in the word and she would look at that little donkey of hers and say son you are my firstborn oh but mama my legs are bowlegged and my my ears is all hang down don't worry the priests will never see you because there will be a lamb offered for you Hallelujah God redeemed them all under one spoken word of sanctification now remember just by God speaking this it brought it to pass over the entirety of all the firstborn that was alive and all of those thereafter by the spoken word of God praise the Lord Jesus notice then God said what he done I Sanctified them for myself Jeremiah 1:5 before I form thee in the belly I knew thee before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nation you mean before Jeremiah even got to exercise his free moral agency well some of you Baptists that have a hard time with that wouldn't you God chose Jeremiah before Jeremiah could even know anything about a choice well hang tight he done the bride the same way so God Sanctified Sanctified now I know you're going through your mind right now you're thinking sanctification sanctification you're thinking about the modern term of the way that we look at it and you're thinking about people getting rid of cigarettes and people getting rid of rock and roll music and people cleaning their closet out no no no no that that's what Come Along on down in time but this is the original application of sanctification in the Old Testament that it was something that was hallowed or set apart for the the service of God now remember that God himself is the only one that can sanctify people well enough for the Divine approach remember to approach him we must be accepted and we cannot sanctify ourselves in this sense to a clear enough stage before God that we could walk in there the way we want to well God hey I'm Donny rean I just come to talk to you today I want you to know I want to pray to you a little while no man can come to mees Jesus said except my father draws him first is that your Bible now watch in St John 177 Jesus praying sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth sanctify them set them apart consecrate them Father as thou H has sent me into the world even so have I sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself now does that mean Jesus was sneaking around smoking was Jesus sneaking around drinking a little wine on the side and Jesus was sneaking around doing some things that was wrong no but Jesus was a man and Jesus as a man could have had a wife I'm going to stagger some of you no doubt Jesus as a man could have physically fathered children but it does not mean those offspring would have been literally Sons and Daughters of God but he knew it would stumble some of you if Jesus would have got married and had a wife and had relations with a wife and had a family and all of that some of his people it would have stumbled them they' never been able to understood it so he said I set myself apart if he hadn't already done it enough Oh Praise You Lord Jesus and for their sakes notice now he's praying and he does not say father for your sake I won't do this or I won't do that but I won't for their sakes amen I'll tell you what friends you watch how people relate relate rather to other people and see how they use their cloak of Liberty in things and their attitude toward offending others and you'll be get a pretty good idea if they have eternal life or not how much say jump and scream and shout that don't really that don't really cut it and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth so here there is an element of sanctification that must come from the ministry in order to greatly affect the ministered to watch in Ephesians 5: 25 Paul's speaking husbands love your wives him as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word this is hegeso which is a little different word than what we just read a while ago it means to be hallow be holy separate from profane things dedicate to God to consecrate now this type of sanctification we cannot do ourself he has to do it amen he has to do it we could never separate ourselves from that sinful nature we were born with only God can kill that nature Hebrews chapter 13 verse 12 wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered with out the gate so he goes beyond the gate as it was the day that they released the goat when the sins were transferred upon the head of the goat and he went out into the Wilderness so the Lord Jesus suffered without the gate outside of Jerusalem so whether you believe in Gordon's calvary or the original one both of them are outside the wall so it doesn't really matter so he went outside the gate in order to suffer for the people a reject for the rejected notice now man also though has a part in sanctification Exodus 29:37 7 days shall thou make an atonement for the Altar and Sanctified and it shall be an altar Most Holy whatsoever touches the altar shall be holy so when Moses done his part and he went through this this ritual of seven days to sanctify the altar then whenever they would bring a lamb just a regular lamb out on the field a bulock a ram whatever it was and they would place that sacrifice on this holy altar oh instead of this natural sacrifice transforming The Altar and making the altar unclean it had the exact opposite effect so you take this regular bulock this regular lamb this regular turtle dove this pigeon whatever it was and you lay it on the Altar and by simply touching the altar God looked at that and said I accept that Holy Lamb amen amen thank you Lord praise be to God 1 Chronicles 15:14 so the priest and the Levites Sanctified themselves so you mean God wouldn't do this no you see when people come to the Lord God will take many things from them there's people sitting right here today that I know by personal testimony that God took marijuana from them God took cigarettes from them God took drinking from them God took pills from them God took all types of things and there's other things they have battled and struggled and fought with to sanctify themselves through why God wants both efforts of sanctification to be manifested in us as his children children we're already lazy enough us bunch of sorry no good no count for nothing Leo to sins we're rotten we're spoiled we no good come on somebody say at least ouch if you can't say amen and if God done the whole thing would' be worse than what we are so God will do what we cannot do and then God says now I want you to sanctify yourself so the priests and the Levites Sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel 2 Chronicles 29:15 and they gathered them their Brethren and Sanctified themselves and came according to the Commandment of the King by the words of the Lord to cleanse the house of the Lord now notice it's them so they're sanctifying they're laying aside habits they're laying aside things that they know is not right you know the way we do it today for many of us we're waiting on God to take him away from us and God is waiting on us to lay them down I wonder how many years some of you all have lost waiting on God to do something for you that he will never ever do sir praise the Lord y'all still with Me 2 Chronicles Chronicles 2934 but the priests were too few now this is the rededication of course so they could not Flay all the burnt offerings now here's all this levitical order and God would always keep the even the natural reproduction of the Levites to where it would be able to compensate with the growth of the tribes of Israel think of that even naturally you've got all these other 11 tribes that's living out here and as they grow and multiply and multiply if God don't let the priesthood multiply and be able to provide for himself there'll never be enough to be able to take care of all the needs now here it wasn't that there wasn't enough a number that there wasn't enough preachers as we'd say that were in a Sanctified state to where they could take care of the needs of the people so people were bringing offerings and bringing offerings and they were just piling up they were just piling up because there were not enough consecrated priest to be able to fle which means to take the meat off the bone and bring it as the acceptable approach into God's presence notice and they could not Flay all the burnt offerings wherefore their Brethren the Levites did help them till the work was ended until the other priests had Sanctified themselves for the Levites were more upright in their heart to sanctify themselves than the priest oh brother so now remember the Levites it was a whole tribe of Levi Levi but part of them carried the tent part of them washed the pots part of them supplied the oil they were not called to go in as priests so here was the called out of the called out the priesthood was called out of the levitical tribe as the bride is called out of the church so the some of the priests had got so cold and so indifferent on the Commandment of God and the Levites had more of a desire to be holy how sad amen I said how sad oh my 2 Chronicles 31:18 and to the genealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons and their daughters to all the congregation for in their set off office they Sanctified themselves in Holiness am so in their set office they Sanctified themselves in Holiness now this is not just of course now speaking to the preachers alone every one of you whether you're a singer whether you're a musician whether you're just a member of the Ley you have a position in the body of Christ and nobody can take your place but brother Donnie I'm just a lay member what what what can I do you are to sanctify yourself in your position as Ley you're to pray for those that are the leaders you're to pray and petition as priests and pray for the leadership of God in the ministry not only in our church but around the world that God will get every predestinated seed so we can leave this mess that we're in y'all want to go home I'm tired of this world I'm sick and tired of the sin and the debauchery of evil that we're living in and putting up with every day let's get out of here children but we cannot do it until everyone whose name is on the Book of Life is called chosen Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and in their position watch Paul carry over this in the New Testament 2 Timothy chapter 2: 20 but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth and you see this also of course in the Tabernacle there were vessels of gold vessels of silver vessels of wood and vessels which were actually clay Earth pottery notice how he Likens this he said and some to honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meet for the Master's use you mean that Paul lays a lot of this responsibility on us as individuals yes sir that if a man looks at and it said if I'm no more than a lady or a woman I'm going to be the best that I can be for the kingdom of God I'm going to pray I'm going to read my Bible if they need anything done around the church I'm going to do what I can do I'm going to pray for the ministry I'm going to take the Sunday School teachers on my heart I'm going to take the leaders of the church on my heart that God will help them and lead them I'm going to pray for brother Donnie the way I ain't never prayed for him in my life because brother Donnie needs prayer Amen brother Donnie can tell you that I need prayer yes why I'm trying to to lead you out of this world into a body change look friends the men of God in this age are trying to preach their sheep to a level that no other age has ever done Paul never had to preach his people into a level of a body change Luther never had to preach his people to a level of a body change don't you understand the men of God in this hour are going to accomplish something that has never been done on the face of the Earth they will preach the living bride into a state of a body chain that death will give way hallelujah oh do we need to be Sanctified do we need to present ourself in the presence of God that he can use us not just me you I find this statement in 1 Peter 3:15 very unusual and Peter says but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that askthe of the reason of the hope that is within you with meekness and fear so you s ify the Lord God in your hearts and you're just thinking he's going to say well you go to church and you know you get down on your knees no actually you sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and then you share with others the reason of the hope that's on the inside of you on oh and then some of you all are wondering what can I do what can I do you've got so much to do my goodness we'll never get it done will we watch this if was ever a call to the church to sanctify ourselves and get away from the things of the world we're ready to cross over my goodness friends if you say this 1955 what about now are you ready tonight to throw aside and sanctify yourself from all your unbelief anybody Now watch how this sanctification for self will come into Ed Ying the body I love the way brother Ram deals with this in the adoption series I was talking to a little preacher yesterday going to preach for him and if you Nots up here on the highway and I asked him about a certain thing and he said yes brother Brenham but the most of my people doesn't believe in that I said most of them are legalist and he said yes brother doesn't believe that but he said for their sake you see this puts a pastor in a very odd and unusual State sometimes amen so here this man brother BR was going up to preach for him and of course the doctrine that brother BR was talking about was predestination election for knowledge and all that and many of this Brothers people come from the Pentecostal background which believed in legalism some were Methodist so whenever brother brandham asked him about that and he said yes brother brandham but a lot of my people don't believe that now some of yall know the rest of this quote but some of you I wonder what would be your idea to advise this brother to do I notice he quotes the scripture of the Lord Jesus I sanctify myself for their sake Jesus was training 12 men that through those 12 was to take the gospel to the world it said for their sake I sanctify myself make yourself for for your neighbor's sake for somebody else's sake so don't use your Liberty for a cloak said Paul but sanctify yourself behave yourself in the neighborhood like a real Christian ought to let your communication if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for his sake not knowing what you might do so if you meet your enemy then what would the natural reaction for a lot of us be it would be get upset at our enemy you know say something or give him that look you know that he knows uh that look of disapproval but when you really learn to sanctify yourself more and more in a deeper consecration you start sanctifying yourself from within now notice he's not saying the spirit of God's going to do this but this is something we're supposed to do we're to sanctify oursel from within and by doing so we are expressing the greater work of God from within our soul I realize friends this is not very deep this morning but I'm actually preaching bride material so for those of you that are interested in going home there you go so if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for San not knowing what what you not knowing what you might do and you're want to be a little Messiah here's your chance sanctify your temper sanctify your arrogance that also carries over on Tik Tok flipflop Instagram and all the rest is social media trash even some of our sisters I understand take the social media and preach a little bit sisters you ain't supposed to be handling the word either behind the pull pit or on Instagram Amen Brother D Amen brother Preacher Brother Donnie I'm with you brother glory to God well thank ke I'm glad y'all are back here cuz they sure ain't many I'm back here I think the sweetest scripture there is in all the Bible it's this scripture father I sanctify myself because of them the SC sweetest scripture in all the Bible he was a man he could have had a wife you say I was making that up a while ago he could have had a home place to lay his head he had rights to that he was a man he could have had good clothes but what did he say father I sanctify myself for their sake what was he doing he was training up 12 disciples that were going to preach the gospel in all the world he put an example and Brethren as ministers I'll tell you it pays us not to get too much of this world's goods and things hanging around us you preachers I'm talking to you you sanctify yourself from them that you're going to lead for them that you're going to lead that's what we need today is a complete consecrated Sanctified life of ministers amen you can go ahead and say Amen it ain't going to make me mad I'm going to say Amen with you hey this is part of the message I know we don't hear preachers read this very much but it's still the truth if we add more Sanctified preachers in the Pulpit but have more sanctified people in the pews notice he said Sanctified life of ministers that walk upright before God does not entangle with the things of the world keep from it father I sanctify myself for their sake for not because he had to but he did it for their sake Romans 12:1 that us change a bit I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of god notice he makes those mercies plural I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a living s sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service amen I read that the I thought how is that even possible this was born between Dawn and Betty Reagan I was conceived in sin come to the world speaking lies give my heart to the Lord as a young boy been preaching since I was 18 be 50 years in a few months and yet this ain't got the Holy Ghost a bit more today than it haveen I give my heart to God years ago the flesh I'm talking about so how can I present this as a holy sacrifice so the difference between us now in the New Testament in the Old Testament was they presented dead sacrifices but Paul specifies I beseech you therefore brother by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice so instead of me just killing it one time laying it on the ah there you go God do whatever you want to it well bury that old thing God don't want that God don't want your old dead hide God don't want your dead carcass got your God wants your old live carcass you you could only offer it once if you present it to him as a dead sacrifice but if you give it to him a Living Sacrifice you can do it every day oh glory to God you can do it every day day after day days lead to week weeks weeks lead to months months lead to years and years lead to decades and before long you've dedicated the rest of your entire life to him instead of bringing a dead carcass and laying it on an altar you sanctify yourself for your neighbor's sake you sanctify yourself for your enemy sake you sanctify yourself or maybe a brother in the church that there's something come between you but you sanctify yourself and try to make peace even though in reality he was the one that wronged you thank you Lord but remember even when we come to church sometimes we're not always dealing with sanctified people some people are Sanctified by God but they've never yet learned the latter part of that half of the equation and that is to sanctify themselves so that's why we have gossip in the church now we got visitors here today and I'll just preach our church here because I'm sure they don't have none of it where they go I know brother Jason's church and brother Luke Gibson church and my everybody there just just as sweet as honey I'm telling you what they ain't nothing but Angels them kind of ride motorcycles and we think because well I man I got sanctifying yours aone you know what love the message folks have done they think that sanctification is a one-time thing oh I got San I before got the Holy Ghost so I'll be sanctify the rest of my life you will be sanctifying that mouth of yours just about every time you open it up come on somebody you going to have to sanctify your thoughts you're going to have to sanctify when you go to the house of God somebody will get your parking spot somebody will get your favorite spot in the Pew we'll have to sanctify ourself when we come to the Lord when we come to service the devil will put that old thing in your mind oh I forgot to turn off the curling AR at home I forgot to turn off the crockpot I forgot to do this don't you understand what it is the devil trying to grab a hold of your mind but you sat there and say Satan in the name of Jesus I've come to Worship the Lord I've come to praise God my hands are Sanctified my feet are Sanctified my voice is Sanctified I set them aside for Jesus Christ Hallelujah [Applause] can I have a few more minutes so God's presence in the Tabernacle and in the temple made them holy watch in Matthew 23:16 woe unto you you blind Gods which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the Temple he is a deor you fools and blind for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold and whosoever shall SAR by the altar it is nothing but whosoever swears by the gift look how backwards they had it the gift that is upon it he is guilty you fools don't you love Jesus gentle mannerism you fools and blind for whether is the greater the gift or the altar so they were magnifying the gift when the gift itself had not the altar Sanctified it could not even be accepted and look how they had changed oh children I'm afraid now that was the end of the Jewish ages and now we are the end of the Gentile ages and if we're not careful the same thing is happening again we're going to magnify the gift over the giver we're going to magnify the gifts come on I believe in the gifts but I do not believe gifts take precedent over the word of God every gift should be subject to God's word and God's message for the hour and the word and the message will sanctify our gifts if we will allow it if not they will be rampant and reproduction of 1906 Aza street so you bring your Al your gift to The Altar and the way they looked at it the gift was greater than the Altar and the gift ofin itself had no ability to transform or change but you placed the gift on the altar it leaves my hands and God changes it it's now accepted so if a consecrated piece of chatim wood overlaid in Gold a little bit of silver if that could transform a normal sacrifice I wonder what God in my soul and God in your soul would be able to do to our body brother Harold we would just allow it to be so and see this is what and you feel you feel so terrible said well this so stinking thing about me I'm so rotten I'm no good I'm this that why should I even worship God this old body of mine we need to move up I hope you understand what this morning is this morning is a call for us to come higher was a higher understanding that oh glory to God that the Eternal himself that lives in our soul wants to San sanctify our body and make the uplifting of our hands as Holiness unto the Lord and the sacrifice of our lips acceptable in the presence of God it is not coming out of a sinner's mouth these are not Sinners hands I don't smoke I don't drink I don't run around but my body is Sanctified by the Living God which is deity inside of my soul there for I can lift holy hands I can lift holy hands at the Corinthian Church remember a lot of Gentiles there mainly Greeks mixed in with Jews some of them that had gotten saved and a question began to raise up among them should the saved wife leave the unsaved husband or should the saved husband leave the unsaved wife because Judaism basically taught the same thing that if a Jew to marry a gentile their children were not holy they were illegitimate same with the Romans which is hard to believe as vile as they were yet they T that if another person if you want your husband or your wife accepted some sort of other religion that you should actually divorce them because your house is not clean your house is divided but watch Paul yes amen and the woman which ha a husband that believeth not if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him am would you notice that it doesn't say let her put him away cuz that wasn't the way he believed it let her not leave him for the unbelieving husband yes amen is Sanctified GL I about had me a spell the other day and the Lord was putting this together I'm telling you the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife can you imagine for the sake of the righteous daughter of God that God will accept her husband as being set apart and Sanctified unto her and because she has found favor Oh Glory in the eyes of God God oh hallelujah hallelujah God looks at them as different what's this the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife you better thank God for this part of this because there's been so many times we have not believed his word we have doubted him we have questioned him oh glory to God but the Fai of our Lord Jesus has Sanctified us brother Paul the face of Abraham Sanctified Sarah remember the prophet of God said Sarah never did believe it was not Sarah's Fai so much it was the fa of Abraham and his facei Sanctified his household glory and the unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean amen but now are they holy thank you Lord now of course verse 14 does not mean that our children are saved from this but God acknowledges and recogniz us that Christian mate it may be a Godly little woman and maybe every child she's got don't serve God and her husband don't serve God but God sets apart that whole situation amen for that daughter don't give up on your children hallelujah hallelujah don't give up on your grandchildren don't give up on your husband your wife hallelujah look at how powerful the life of one believer and a home [Applause] isall that Christian mate sets apart that home for God's blessing Hallelujah there's many a sinner man that's been blessed by his wife being a child of God there's many a sinner woman there's many a sinner child that's been blessed by being set apart well you say Brother Don there's people that come to our church and ain't right of course they ain't but I figure if they can come long enough they might get around where there's enough of us at they might get a good ghost of the Holy Ghost himself I'd much rather be in here well what if they drink what if they lie what if they run around come on you Liars come on you Jezebels come on you whatever you are come right here this is like a hospital we're here to minister to the sick we're here to minister to the lost we're here to minister to L the SE and wash them by the water of the word and close them with holy garments so they can be set aside for a Rapture so God blesses the lost for the sake of the saved amen amen thank you Lord you parents that have got children that's getting old enough to go out on their own I would keep them in my house as long as I could am I know they're going to get old enough and they're going to make up their mind what they're going to do but you want to hold them under this atmosphere as long as you can amen God in the soul sanctifies this body 1 Timothy 2:8 I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up what kind of hands amen holy hands without WRA and doubting Hebrews 13:15 by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God when everything is going good and all your bills are paid and at least once months whether you think he needs it or not you want to know how much you're supposed to praise him you say the word you say it come on don't nod your head I want to hear you say it say it tell yourself this is how much you're supposed to praise God self Donnie you hear that this is how much you're supposed to praise God well I do it I do it three times a day brother Donnie that ain't near [Applause] [Music] enough the SA rice of praise to God continually that is the fruit remember fruit is progeny mixing together two things upper and lower lip new births inside the soul produce mixed together with a Sanctified body what does it produce a sacrifice of praise a sacrifice of praise notice the prophet said the Bible said you're a royal priesthood A peculiar people offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruits of your lips giving praise unto him oh my the fruits of your lips pouring up praise daily before the people what a high priest we have what a high priest or priesthood that we're in oh come on now don't you love that he didn't just stop with Jesus what a high priest we have and what a priesthood we are in in the priesthood of the circumcision not of the flesh but of the heart amen the heart circumcised by the Holy Ghost that's right then you can offer praise and adoration to God the spiritual sacrifice your lips pouring out praise unto him again they are peculiar people of royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifice giving praise to God listen to these next words whether they feel like it or not Hallelujah whether they feel like it or not that's when it really becomes a sacrifice stand spiritual Amnesia God's church and his people has always been a separated people a called out people A peculiar people a holy nation a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruits of their lips giving praise to his name God called his church and separated it from the world for that very purpose God didn't just save you to save you he saved you to love him he saved you to praise him to worship Him I got to read one more is it okay we'll pick it up again but notice this about worship I hope this transforms the way you think about worship we should not Worship the Lord just after we get through preaching the word as we usually do just worship him that's wonderful but we should worship him every hour of our life when we're at work we should worship him but now notice what he says this is every time the opportunity presents itself Worship the Lord by testifying of him so it's not just you standing be your machine that you work at at work or you driving down the road but worship is also reaching out to others amen watch if you see some of you ladies see a woman in the wrong Worship the Lord by taking her and saying sister there's a better life than this amen wow you mean that is worshiping God worshiping God you man at your work when you hear a man using the name of the Lord in vain and you get a chance to one side and slip over and take it by the hand and say Amen there's a better life than this you shouldn't use those words and tell him in a Meek and GLE way all those things is a worship and when you see someone sick and the doctor says there's no more that can be done we ought to worship God by telling them there's a God in heaven that answers prayer [Music] now let's be honest would we have ever thought that would be worship so you mean by sharing that the Lord Jesus Is A Healer a savior a redeemer you are worshiping God and your you thought it was just about this true divine worship is coming out of your regenerate Soul pouring through lips of a Sanctified Tabernacle Hallelujah I said one more it keeps growing I'm sorry I love this listen to this I'm going to close for sure I believe that Christian Life is a continual sacrifice he that will come after to me let him deny himself daily every day not 46 days of course he's speaking about Linton let every day take up his cross and follow me said Jesus not just 46 but every day Jesus actually spoke about your cross more than he spoke about his own look how many times in the gospels he mentioned you taking up your cross and see how many times he talked about himself taking up his he knew the harder battle wouldn't be himself it'd be us oh how the Christian loves to to it he doesn't do it with a grudge he doesn't oh he he does it with a a feeling that he loves God and he's glad he can do it it's a joy to serve the Lord Jesus it's a joy to sacrifice it's a joy to Worship the Lord It's a joy to be called a fanatic for the kingdom of God's sake praise the Lord some of y'all said praise God for the first time so I ask you Priests of God in a little bit you'll be walking out them doors what till we going to do but Brother Don I've wasted so many years forget all the waste what are you going to do from today forward don't do a bit of good to spend all of our time Walling on our mistakes and we've all done all that but what are we going to do from this day forward as Priests of the most high God we have been Anointed with an anointing the eagle anointing of the last days to loose the seals to release the Thunders the voice of God to release a building of a body of God on the earth that would actually come to such a state of maturity their completion and Perfection will call for the rest of the dead I'm not just waiting to see my little girl I'm wanting to see Paul and Peter amen James and John when the resurrection happens it's going to be all of them it ain't going to just be those from our church those from our age they are all waiting on us Hallelujah Jesus if God can sanctify us on his part and then us sanctify us the rest rest of the way and lay aside our you our differences and our doctrines and sure we're always going to have things and there there's certain stands we have to take that we cannot compromise on no but I'm talking about things many things that we argue and fuss about it don't even pertain to Salvation in the first place and if we can go to loving one another and praying for one another even though we don't agree with one another my goodness how many people agreed with Jesus and they prayed for all of them look at the prophet of God what an attitude look at the spirit I don't just study this message I study the spirit this message was delivered in you know I find that messenger saying people throw him out he just draw a Bricker circle they' throw him out that Circle he draw a bigger one they throw out that she kept on drawing a bigger one well come on somebody boy if anybody throws us out of the circle GL to God I'm turn them over to the devil Hallelujah they repat their serpent seat now show me where the prophet of God or the Lord Jesus had that attitude he kept praying for him father forgive them for they don't know what they do and I don't mind telling you I'm going to go ahead and say it I don't figure there's anybody here today that don't need a closer walk with God I don't fig there's none of us here today that ain't messed up and messed up and scrupled up and all kinds of mess ever was if it ain't for the grace of God there won't be none of us go noow if it's going to take Grace for me why not give Grace to somebody else and Grace to somebody else and Grace to somebody else Remember The Headstone is not coming crying Doctrine Doctrine Doctrine The Headstone is not coming crying gifts gifts gifts but the headstone is coming crying Grace Gra why because that's what we need it's going to take the rapturing grace of almighty God to get this bride together but he will do it it will be a miracle for him to get her together but listen out devil let me tell you right now the Lord God will get his bride together from around the world in every nation every tongue every Kindred they will come to that place of rapturing faith and all hell will not be able to stop him Hallelujah par it Lord God what an awesome day to be living dear Jesus I come before you today as a priest of God my brothers and sisters also come I don't come as their priest necessarily and that I'm above them and greater than them and have a greater position than them I come with them every daughter of God standing here today Born Again filled with the Holy Ghost is part of the priesthood of of God I remember that day when that little woman had that baby and it was crying and crying little sister satting there in a chair felt so sorry for her gave her her seat she had a prayer card and she said honey God just keep putting it on my heart to pray for you old baby I know brother Ram's going to pray for it but would you just let me pray for it just kind of get this out why sure dear go ahead that little sister laid her hands on that baby the woman come in the prayer line God shows the Prophet The Vision he does not rebuke that woman for praying for her but he said God healed her whenever the woman prayed for her but brother Randon was not after arrogance and pride well glory to God I prayed for him so that puts another feather in my hat he didn't have feathers in his hat he wanted all the glory to go to you and he said the reason was that little mother could have a Fe feeling that maybe he couldn't have the same way father whenever they'd bring a cross-eyed child across the platform there wasn't a one of them not a one of them that ever walked off that wasn't healed why recalling his little Sharon rose laying there eyes crossed with the pain it puts such a feeling in the heart of this priest many of us can share with those things Lord may we walk out of here today brothers sisters ministers non- ministers alike and realize we are called to intercede we are called to pray we are called to sanctify ourselves we're called To Worship we're called to present sacrifices one of the greatest we can ever give you is to place our bodies on your altar as a living sacrifice Lord God I don't know how many more years or months or weeks or whatever that I have I live in a few months I'll be 68 years old I'm an old man wow it's hard for me to Fathom sometimes I don't know how much more time I've got I don't know how many more sermons I get to preach but how much ever life I have left I want to give it all to you Lord I want want to be sensitive so if your Holy Spirit comes upon me it lows which it does and Home Depot and it does I want to be so sensitive that I can stop whatever I'm doing whatever I've got planned for the day other people say oh yeah that's wonderful thank God we have a pastor like that but help them to realize I want sheep like that and that's the kind of sheep you want where you can deal with this and maybe they're fixing breakfast so they're at the grocery store and the Lord puts brother Daryl on a sister's heart to pray for him and she just pulls a little basket of groceries over to one side and Bows her head Lord God I don't know why but I pray for brother Daryl today that you'd help him she may not know he's just left a meetting over mour Arkansas and his back went out this morning when he got up at 4:00 to head home or something like that and she's praying for him he's going along in pain and Agony and the spirit of God comes in his car where he's at and touches our brother why cuz a daughter of God obeyed the Holy Ghost and Sanctified her time praise the Lord oh Jesus I wonder how much you want to do Among Us not just from the pulpit out but in the body you didn't just save me sanctify me Sanctified the preachers you've Sanctified a wife is I accorded to him the other the other night that for many thousands of years the Jewish vows of a man taking a wife would be thou sanctify thee unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel what I've heard today is you saying to your bride my wife my spouse my beloved be thou Sanctified unto me for I am the god the god of Israel Lord Jesus we worship you father and many but just just like to take a few moments and maybe just have a rededication service this morning it ain't been that long since we dedicated this building but maybe we could just rededicate ourselves our praise our time our thoughts you know it already I don't need to tell you but one of the greatest shortages that we have in this day is time remember that message I preached to you years ago the bondage of time never enough time are they Satan's got more and more and more things to occupy our time than ever before and the difficult part about it is many of those things are not sinful they are not wrong but we just give so much time to this and time to that the prophet said as far as he knew he never stole anything in his life but he had stole time from God maybe many of you have not stole one thing since you've got saved but I wonder how many of us have stole time time that he wants oh Hallelujah Lord God I bless your name Jesus please forgive me please forgive me Lord hallelujah hallelujah many wants to just rededicate your life with me today deacons trustees ministers sisters brothers young people those of you that are streaming the service at the archive it may you pull
