[15:49] six years ago
[15:51] that brother Louie's invitation that I
[15:54] came to Happy Valley for the first time
[15:57] it's most likely The Darkest Hour of my
[16:00] life
[16:01] but I remember sitting back in the back
[16:03] of the Assembly of the Happy Valley and
[16:05] feeling such an intense presence I know
[16:08] today the Lord never left me but I felt
[16:10] that Shekinah presence that I just not
[16:13] felt in a long time
[16:16] Venture each time I came
[16:20] I'd always at five hour drive I'd want
[16:22] to get here early and I'd sit at the
[16:23] back I'd always get here about an hour
[16:25] early and just to fill that presence
[16:28] about a year and a half ago I got
[16:30] introduced to brother Ron his assembly
[16:33] about an hour or so closer to home so
[16:36] I've been there some quite a bit and I
[16:39] found myself doing the same thing I get
[16:41] there early and sit at the back
[16:43] and it's hit me that it's more than just
[16:46] as you can a presence it's you
[16:48] it's the wonderful presence of the
[16:50] people of God

[16:54] have to live in but it's just something
[16:56] wonderful

[34:06] in love
[34:08] wasn't that love
[34:12] love he heard the mob Yale crucified
[34:16] but he knew he came to die wasn't that
[34:22] love

[37:15] I'm sure that most of us even that
[37:18] love him and have been living for him
[37:21] for a long time
[37:23] we still probably
[37:25] understand so very little
[37:28] about such a great love
[37:31] for him to become a man would have been
[37:35] such an act of condescension
[37:39] but for him to become
[37:41] sin
[37:43] to wit that God was in Christ
[37:47] reconciling the world to himself
[37:50] for he who knew no sin became sin
[37:54] that he might become the very
[37:56] righteousness that we might become of
[37:59] God in him I'm so grateful for today
[38:02] aren't you
[38:04] I just wonder what it's going to be like
[38:06] when all the great singers and
[38:10] musicians that have lived down through
[38:12] time that have given their talent to God
[38:15] when they all gather together
[38:17] that'd be one thing about the singers
[38:19] and the musicians I figure this they'll
[38:22] be singing and playing preachers won't
[38:24] preach no more
[38:25] you talk about an eternal retirement
[38:27] plan
[38:28] yeah
[38:30] so you preach for 30 or 40 years
[38:32] whatever it is and then you get Eternal
[38:34] retirement so be no preaching no prayer
[38:37] lines no older calls nothing like that
[38:40] but what a time of rejoicing and
[38:42] praising and loving and worshiping him
[38:46] I'm sure our minds just cannot
[38:48] comprehend it
[38:49] but until we get to that time there's
[38:52] many talls and snares no doubt that we
[38:54] will be faced with and ups and downs in
[38:57] life
[38:58] so I think he equips us with what we
[39:01] need in this life's journey to help us
[39:03] to make it if you have your Bible and
[39:05] you'd like to turn with me today to the
[39:07] Book of Luke chapter 8 verse 49 and
[39:10] certainly welcome you here today and
[39:12] trust that if you come to receive
[39:14] something from the Lord that he will be
[39:16] able to minister to your needs
[39:19] been speaking here for uh several
[39:22] services on the bride's Bill of Rights
[39:26] and today on I'd like to
[39:28] speak to you on a life
[39:31] above
[39:33] ungodly
[39:35] fear
[39:38] a life
[39:40] above
[39:42] ungodly
[39:44] fear
[39:46] how many knows there is a fear that's
[39:47] right and true we know of course the Old
[39:51] Testament teaches us that that fear of
[39:53] the Lord is the beginning of wisdom fear
[39:54] of the Lord is the beginning of
[39:55] knowledge and there's a reverential fear
[39:58] that we should have for our parents and
[40:01] so on but there is a fear
[40:04] that is absolutely ungodly
[40:08] Unholy
[40:10] and we should not be captured by it
[40:15] so there's a life that we can live above
[40:17] ungodly fear
[40:20] Luke chapter 8 verse 49.
[40:24] the setting is of course Jarius and he's
[40:28] come to the Lord Jesus and asked for
[40:31] help because his daughter is sick
[40:33] little does he know of course that while
[40:35] he's on his journey his daughter has
[40:37] died and we will break into that part of
[40:40] the story right there while he yet spake
[40:43] there cometh one from the ruler of the
[40:46] synagogue's house
[40:48] saying to him thy daughter
[40:51] is dead
[40:53] trouble not the master
[40:57] but when Jesus heard it
[41:00] he answered him
[41:02] saying
[41:04] fear not
[41:08] What A peculiar response
[41:12] so the man's daughter is dead 12 years
[41:14] old
[41:15] the wife is no doubt Torn to Pieces by
[41:18] this time the mourners are already there
[41:20] wailing and mourning as it was the
[41:23] custom of the people
[41:25] and the Lord Jesus says don't be afraid
[41:29] everything's good
[41:32] can you imagine how odd that must have
[41:34] seen me imagine what you all would
[41:35] respond to me if I walked into your
[41:38] house and your husband your wife your
[41:39] baby just died and said everything's
[41:41] good
[41:43] God's got it all in control
[41:45] don't be afraid
[41:48] you'd probably look at me and saying
[41:49] poor old guy
[41:51] he's lost his mind
[41:54] but you see this is the type of fear
[41:56] that God does not want his children to
[41:59] have
[42:00] listen but when Jesus heard it he
[42:03] answered and saying answered him saying
[42:05] fear not
[42:07] believe only
[42:10] believe only
[42:12] in that amazing it's backwards the way
[42:14] that we said most the time we say only
[42:15] believe but he said believe only
[42:19] and she shall be made whole
[42:25] so the heart is stopped
[42:28] the blood pressure is gone
[42:30] the blood is start coagulating in the
[42:32] body
[42:35] you know imagine the reversal
[42:37] of all this that's got to take place for
[42:40] this one word whole
[42:43] the blood is still you know what it does
[42:45] it coagulates it clots
[42:48] the arteries start collapsing the heart
[42:50] muscle is dead
[42:52] Jesus says she will be whole
[42:57] look at this word fear where Jesus said
[42:59] they're fearing on
[43:01] look up here at the Greek word what it
[43:03] actually means
[43:05] a phobia
[43:07] while we're living in a phobia age
[43:09] aren't we
[43:11] listen what it means to be afraid of
[43:14] put to flight by terrifying
[43:17] to scare away
[43:19] to be
[43:21] struck
[43:22] with fear
[43:24] to be seized with alarm how many has
[43:29] ever had it
[43:31] over and over again haven't we we've all
[43:34] experienced this type of thing phobias
[43:38] phobias
[43:40] notice with me again in Luke chapter 12
[43:43] verse 32 the Lord Jesus again different
[43:46] setting same words
[43:50] fear not little flock
[43:54] for it is your father's good pleasure
[43:58] to give you the kingdom
[44:01] fear not little flock for it is notice
[44:05] how he punctuates this it is your
[44:08] father's
[44:10] good pleasure
[44:12] God gets pleasure out of giving us the
[44:16] kingdom
[44:17] Romans 8 15.
[44:20] for ye have not received the spirit of
[44:24] bondage
[44:26] again
[44:28] the spirit of bondage again
[44:32] to fear
[44:35] that ye have received the spirit of
[44:39] adoption
[44:41] I hope you understand what I'm going to
[44:42] say there's a difference in fear
[44:45] and the spirit of fear
[44:49] it's embred in us fight or flight since
[44:52] the fall to feel alarmed somebody pulls
[44:56] out in front of you you react within
[44:58] three-quarters of a second to break
[45:00] there's certain fear that will save your
[45:03] life
[45:04] but then there's a spirit of fear
[45:06] that can get on people
[45:09] and it takes the spirit of God to
[45:10] deliver them
[45:12] for ye have not received the spirit of
[45:15] bondage again to fear but you have
[45:16] received the spirit of adoption now
[45:19] Paul's going to say some very peculiar
[45:21] words here which is only coined by the
[45:23] Lord Jesus himself in the Book of Mark
[45:26] whereby we cry
[45:29] Abba
[45:31] father
[45:32] Abba
[45:34] father
[45:35] I mean glad to be remembered today as we
[45:37] pray just told your request in your
[45:39] heart
[45:41] father we love you today we so thank you
[45:43] for the opportunity that we can be
[45:45] gathered together
[45:46] Lord Jesus may you come
[45:49] and speak to our hearts
[45:52] no doubt among these hundreds of people
[45:54] that are here today
[45:56] the needs are so many and so diverse
[46:00] some Lord facing great decisions in
[46:03] their life some maybe just heard of
[46:05] terrible doctor's report this week
[46:07] some may be father or loved one is gone
[46:11] away from the way of the what
[46:12] righteousness and truth they're so heavy
[46:15] here today
[46:16] some maybe it's a husband or a wife
[46:18] maybe it's a wayward loved one Lord you
[46:21] know what we all need
[46:23] we're bringing our petitions before you
[46:25] today we have confidence in you that
[46:28] you're mindful of us
[46:30] in the name of Jesus I bind every evil
[46:34] spirit
[46:35] that would try to hinder this service
[46:38] in the name of Jesus Christ May every
[46:41] foul Spirit from hell
[46:44] take your flight
[46:46] in the name of Jesus Christ open our
[46:50] hearts father to your word that we might
[46:52] be able to receive from you for it's in
[46:55] the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it
[46:57] amen God bless you you may be seated
[47:05] I find it to be amazing that people that
[47:09] have been delivered from things can
[47:13] once again
[47:15] take on a spirit of bondage
[47:18] it can be bondage to a man it can be
[47:21] bondage to a church
[47:23] it can be bondage to a system
[47:26] it can be bondage to a previous thing
[47:30] that they've overcome
[47:31] and they find themselves under the same
[47:34] thing again
[47:35] maybe it's a habit maybe it's something
[47:38] that God set you free from it got a
[47:41] little cold and a little indifferent and
[47:43] you find yourself picking up
[47:46] some of those things that you laid aside
[47:50] but Paul says you have not received the
[47:52] spirit of bondage again to fear
[47:55] the fear is something that Adam and Eve
[47:58] never experienced in the Garden of Eden
[48:01] before the fall
[48:03] they knew an amount of joy and
[48:06] fulfillment and happiness that to be
[48:08] honest none of us have ever experienced
[48:11] we've known happiness it's short-lived
[48:14] many times we've known joy and we're
[48:17] saying oh my we get a new child and our
[48:19] family or a grandchild or you know a
[48:22] promotion in your job or something and
[48:24] it makes you happy but you know how it
[48:26] is it's short-lived and then something
[48:28] else will come up and it seems like it
[48:30] takes that joy and that happiness from
[48:33] you think where did it go you had it 30
[48:34] minutes or an hour or maybe a day or two
[48:36] and it's gone
[48:38] but can you imagine living in a paradise
[48:40] of God to where they never knew any
[48:43] sadness they never knew any any feeling
[48:46] of Gloom that never got up one day and
[48:49] felt great and then by noon some bad
[48:52] news came and changed it all and they
[48:54] were just heartbroken for several
[48:56] several days that's our life
[48:58] but every day was the same every day was
[49:01] beautiful every day was awesome the
[49:04] presence of God being around them every
[49:07] day they lived in this absolute
[49:10] wonderful world that he'd made for them
[49:12] and they never knew any type of sadness
[49:15] no Gloom no type of weariness no fear
[49:19] whatsoever
[49:20] until they make their choice to Step
[49:24] Beyond the boundary of the word
[49:26] that it was God's custom of course to
[49:29] come in the evening time because God
[49:32] would lay them down to sleep and rest
[49:35] so the sun started setting and Adam and
[49:39] Eve would go up to the Cathedral of
[49:41] trees but this day happened and whenever
[49:44] they knew it was time for him to come
[49:46] they began to feel this peculiar strange
[49:51] feeling it was all new to them they
[49:54] never experienced it before their flesh
[49:57] must have begun to tremble somewhat and
[50:00] they got anxious maybe their face began
[50:04] to flush their blood pressure began to
[50:06] rise that never felt that before either
[50:09] and they begin to feel so strange and so
[50:13] unusual
[50:15] didn't even know what to call it didn't
[50:17] even know how to identify it
[50:19] and then God came down as was his custom
[50:23] and God didn't find him in church
[50:27] every day before this they was in church
[50:29] every day every day they was in church
[50:33] the great synagogue was not made of
[50:36] stone and it was not a temple of gold
[50:38] and silver but it was the beautiful
[50:40] trees that God had made in Paradise
[50:44] the birds the animals the flowers the
[50:46] streams the rivers the waterfalls must
[50:49] have been absolutely breathtaking
[50:51] but now Adam could no longer enjoy them
[50:54] he could not feel the same way just that
[50:57] he did the day before and he's trying to
[50:59] ponder what is this feeling that I'm
[51:02] feeling I've never felt this before and
[51:05] he hears the voice of God as it comes
[51:07] walking in the garden and the cool of
[51:09] the day and God was saying Adam
[51:13] Adam
[51:17] Adam
[51:21] where are you
[51:24] Adam
[51:26] my boy
[51:32] and then I can hear this sweet voice say
[51:36] I'm over here
[51:39] I hid myself
[51:42] because I'm afraid
[51:46] the first time the human being
[51:50] says this terrible word
[51:54] I'm afraid
[51:57] and I hid myself
[51:59] the first time a human being
[52:02] hides from God's presence
[52:07] have you eaten of the tree whereof I
[52:10] commanded thee that thou shouldest not
[52:13] eat
[52:15] come out
[52:17] face
[52:19] my judgment
[52:23] it must have been a horrible day
[52:27] you see that seems strange for you and I
[52:30] all we've known since we were just we
[52:33] children
[52:35] we started experiencing fear
[52:39] most of you probably can't even remember
[52:41] the first time you felt it it's probably
[52:44] a baby
[52:46] as I was probably a wee baby
[52:49] the first time this emotion came over me
[52:52] and I didn't know what to do
[52:55] so all I did was cry and scream like you
[52:59] did
[53:00] I didn't know what to say I couldn't
[53:02] talk I didn't know how to express it but
[53:05] I felt this feeling
[53:07] and I didn't like it
[53:09] so I began to scream and cry kick my
[53:13] feet and what I want
[53:15] my mama
[53:21] but now of course
[53:23] I'm 67 years old
[53:27] so I felt the fear of sickness
[53:31] the fear of betrayal
[53:33] the fear of not understanding God's will
[53:37] the fear that I'll failing
[53:40] the fear of man
[53:42] the fear of government
[53:45] the fear of people that you don't know
[53:49] the fear of flying
[53:52] the fear of storms
[53:55] the fear of lightning
[53:58] the fear of high winds
[54:02] on and on and on
[54:06] I could go
[54:08] my life like yours
[54:11] hardly a day goes by
[54:13] that I don't encounter
[54:15] some type of fear
[54:19] maybe it's the fear of the economy
[54:22] the fear of you being able to pay your
[54:24] bills
[54:25] the fear of how will I provide for my
[54:28] family
[54:31] and as a man that makes you nervous
[54:34] makes you very nervous if you love your
[54:36] family you want to provide for them
[54:39] you go to looking and thinking God what
[54:41] must I do how can I be able to make it
[54:44] it's my responsibility to provide for my
[54:47] family so you try to better yourself
[54:49] and meet with this disappointment that
[54:52] disappointment you ever notice how when
[54:54] disappointments come of that sort there
[54:57] can be an element of fear that will grip
[55:00] your heart
[55:01] because it seems to produce an
[55:03] uncertainty
[55:04] and you just don't know what the future
[55:06] is
[55:07] and you can look around and see that
[55:11] food's higher than it's been inflation's
[55:14] going up wages aren't keeping up with it
[55:17] and the price of bread is going up you
[55:20] bought gas in the last few weeks it's
[55:23] gone up
[55:24] everything is going up
[55:27] well that's what I'm waiting for too to
[55:30] go up
[55:32] but until I do
[55:34] and until you do
[55:36] we will constantly experience fear
[55:41] my brother Donnie you said that we can
[55:43] live a life
[55:45] that is above ungodly fear yes we can
[55:50] I do not believe according to God's word
[55:53] that God wants us to be controlled by
[55:57] fear though in our mechanism of humanity
[56:00] it is an automatic response
[56:06] as I stood some few months ago in my
[56:10] kitchen and Carol called me
[56:13] and she was with Erica down at the
[56:16] hospital in Sycamore Shoals
[56:19] and they done a scan
[56:21] on her brain
[56:23] because she was saying some things that
[56:27] wasn't quite right and
[56:29] they were just alarmed by it
[56:32] so they did a scan and they found in her
[56:36] brain
[56:38] that the cancer which is almost
[56:40] impossible
[56:42] for the neuro or endocrine
[56:44] cells to move because of the blood block
[56:47] to go up to the brain
[56:50] but that devil found a way
[56:53] to go into her brain
[56:56] Kel told me Donnie you need to come down
[56:58] here because they've they've found this
[57:01] and I I think we need you here
[57:06] when Carol spoke those words to me
[57:08] instantly I felt my face flush red
[57:13] I felt my blood pressure go up I never
[57:16] have blood pressure problems thank the
[57:18] Lord
[57:18] but I felt it go up I felt my heart
[57:22] pounding within my chest
[57:25] and I said okay I'll change my clothes
[57:27] and I'll be down there just in a few
[57:29] minutes
[57:31] but I as I begin to get ready to go down
[57:34] to the hospital I remembered
[57:37] what the Lord God had spoke to me
[57:41] at that same Hospital in Sycamore Shoals
[57:45] I had taken Erica down for a a scan an
[57:48] MRI I was setting out in the waiting
[57:50] room with my laptop and my lap is on
[57:53] Wednesday so I was going to preach
[57:54] Wednesday night and I sat there on my
[57:56] laptop in my lap setting uh in the
[58:00] waiting area for service on Wednesday
[58:02] night
[58:04] and while I was sitting there the spirit
[58:06] of God spoke these words to me
[58:09] do not fear their scans
[58:12] believe my word
[58:17] so I wrote down what he said I wrote
[58:20] down the date and I wrote down the time
[58:22] when God tells you something
[58:25] it don't lie
[58:27] you know that's right don't you because
[58:29] you've had him speak to you so whenever
[58:32] we got back the result of that scam
[58:34] there was nothing bad
[58:36] no bad report at all so I thought huh
[58:40] God didn't tell me that for nothing
[58:43] months went by
[58:46] so here I walk into the ER and I find
[58:49] Erica there laying down to find Carol
[58:51] setting by her side and again I was
[58:54] reminded and I told them whenever I walk
[58:56] in I said remember it was in this same
[58:59] Hospital not the same room but the same
[59:02] hospital that the Lord spoke to me
[59:04] months ago and someone printed it out
[59:07] for Erica and she's got it there you
[59:09] know or she can be reminded of it
[59:11] but my first reaction in my human makeup
[59:15] was what not Joy not excitement
[59:20] fear
[59:21] how many knows what I'm talking about
[59:23] this morning now does that mean that I
[59:27] did not believe does that mean you do
[59:29] not believe whenever we hear things that
[59:32] will alarm us
[59:34] does that mean when we experience this
[59:37] type of fear or phobia that we are
[59:41] doubting God it does not it simply means
[59:45] that through one of the ten Gates
[59:48] that Satan has access to see taste feels
[59:52] smell hear the outer court and then to
[59:55] the second Court which is the spirit
[59:57] imagination conscience memory reason and
[1:00:01] affection these are ten Gates that he
[1:00:04] tries to access the human being to be
[1:00:07] able to get into the real Court which is
[1:00:11] the soul
[1:00:13] now our reaction no doubt will always be
[1:00:16] to respond first humanly and then
[1:00:20] whenever the spirit of God can gain
[1:00:22] control then we will calm the outer five
[1:00:27] gates and calm the inner five gates and
[1:00:31] then start ruling from the throne room
[1:00:33] of the soul I mean he understands what
[1:00:36] I'm saying now the sad part about it is
[1:00:39] that there are many Christians that live
[1:00:41] under a spirit of bondage now Paul is
[1:00:45] using the words here that was identified
[1:00:48] with slavery now slavery is a terrible
[1:00:51] terrible thing whether it's natural or
[1:00:54] spiritual now during the time here of
[1:00:56] course in the Book of Romans was written
[1:00:58] it was a time of slavery on the earth we
[1:01:01] know our own Nation had its own black
[1:01:03] dark Years of Slavery here in America
[1:01:06] but I'm going to tell you something I
[1:01:08] believe there's more slaves in America
[1:01:10] today than there ever has been before
[1:01:13] now they're not necessarily their bodies
[1:01:16] owned by someone else but it is their
[1:01:19] souls and their minds and their
[1:01:21] objectives and their motives and people
[1:01:23] who always sing of the land of the free
[1:01:25] in the home of the brave but I wonder
[1:01:27] how many in America today are truly free
[1:01:31] many of them are bound by addictions to
[1:01:34] alcohol and addictions to drugs and many
[1:01:38] of them are bound by addictions to
[1:01:40] pornography and addictions of all sort
[1:01:43] come on somebody preach with me some of
[1:01:46] them are addicted to this and that and
[1:01:48] the other and they cannot make it
[1:01:50] without having something to help them to
[1:01:52] get up something to help them to go to
[1:01:55] sleep something to carry them over in
[1:01:57] the middle of the day what a sad time
[1:01:59] we're living in so it is the spirit of
[1:02:03] bondage again that has got so many
[1:02:05] people and yet Paul is contrasting the
[1:02:09] spirit of bondage with the spirit of
[1:02:12] adoption so you know the slave would be
[1:02:15] under constant fear the slave would
[1:02:19] constantly now none of us of course here
[1:02:22] setting here today I now say under the
[1:02:24] sound of my voice anywhere around the
[1:02:26] world have been a slave on the natural
[1:02:28] sense so it'll be hard for us to relate
[1:02:30] to it some of our our brothers and
[1:02:33] sisters and their their families several
[1:02:35] Generations black back that would be of
[1:02:38] the black brothers and sisters and no
[1:02:40] doubt maybe some of their grandfathers
[1:02:42] or great-grandfathers it would be that
[1:02:44] would tell them about that and how that
[1:02:46] they was owned by another human being
[1:02:49] which is an abomination in the eyes of
[1:02:51] God
[1:02:53] God never ordained such a thing God made
[1:02:56] all men free it was man that made slaves
[1:03:01] not God come on but you and I might not
[1:03:04] be able to relate to someone owning your
[1:03:07] body but I dare say every one of us can
[1:03:10] relate to being under uh an element of
[1:03:14] spiritual slavery and what's so sad is
[1:03:17] when people have found the Lord and been
[1:03:20] able to meet him and recognize that he
[1:03:22] is the Redeemer and he set them free
[1:03:25] from the bondage of sin and then they
[1:03:28] come into serving him and they obtain
[1:03:30] another form of slavery which is a
[1:03:34] spiritual slavery and there's still
[1:03:37] Christians they still love the Lord they
[1:03:39] go to church but they go to a church
[1:03:41] that doesn't really preach all the
[1:03:44] truths now you know we believe we're
[1:03:46] living in a rapturing time a rapturing
[1:03:49] age I personally believe by the
[1:03:51] dispensations of of God's light to the
[1:03:54] gospel that you can notice whenever God
[1:03:56] released his power and there was four
[1:03:59] beasts in the Book of Revelation and
[1:04:01] when those four Beast Powers were was
[1:04:03] released the spirit of God lifted up a
[1:04:06] standard and released an anointing from
[1:04:09] the Throne of God that would combat that
[1:04:11] power on the earth in order to be an
[1:04:14] overcomer in that age you had to be
[1:04:16] Anointed with that Spirit to ever
[1:04:19] overcome it so is it today so if this is
[1:04:23] an age like never been before it's going
[1:04:26] to take more than the ox anointing it's
[1:04:29] going to take more than the man
[1:04:31] anointing it's going to take the eagle
[1:04:34] anointing in the Book of Revelation that
[1:04:38] we have to come and hear what he has to
[1:04:41] say to the church in this end time and
[1:04:45] yet many people go to church and they
[1:04:46] don't understand the first principle
[1:04:48] about where we are in the dispensation
[1:04:51] of time to me that is so sad so Paul
[1:04:54] contrasts the bondage of slavery with
[1:04:57] the freedom of the people of God under
[1:05:00] the spirit of adoption now he says
[1:05:03] you've not received the spirit of
[1:05:05] bondage again now how sad that that
[1:05:08] people that would have been released
[1:05:10] from the spirit of bondage and they
[1:05:13] drank and they cursed and they run
[1:05:15] around they lived you know terrible
[1:05:17] terrible lives and then they come into
[1:05:19] some sort of church system and when they
[1:05:21] come into that church system and they
[1:05:23] find themselves saved but they don't
[1:05:26] find themselves totally set free and
[1:05:29] they come right back into another
[1:05:31] bondage again and they become slaves to
[1:05:35] some sort of religious system which many
[1:05:38] times can be worse than what they was in
[1:05:40] out there in the world it's harder to
[1:05:43] get a religious man and to see that he's
[1:05:45] wrong many times and it is a sinner out
[1:05:48] here that knows he's lost but a
[1:05:50] religious spirit is seven times worse
[1:05:53] than any other devil in hell I want you
[1:05:57] to think about that because of religious
[1:05:59] spirit will try to convince people that
[1:06:02] they're all right oh you live as good as
[1:06:04] they do you're okay you go to church
[1:06:06] every now and then whether you need to
[1:06:08] or not you help the poor and you do this
[1:06:11] and that and you know you're good you're
[1:06:13] good I'll tell your friend that's not
[1:06:15] the kind of thing you want to die by
[1:06:17] that ain't the type of thing I want to
[1:06:19] live by I want to live by a gospel that
[1:06:21] will be able to present me to the Lord
[1:06:24] Jesus as a bride of Christ
[1:06:27] but so many today are under the spirit
[1:06:30] of bondage again but you don't have to
[1:06:33] be unless you choose to be now notice
[1:06:36] Paul then says we have not received the
[1:06:39] spirit of bondage again to fear but ye
[1:06:41] have received the spirit of adoption
[1:06:44] whereby we cry now I want you to notice
[1:06:47] that we have received the spirit of
[1:06:50] adoption so adoption was of course taken
[1:06:53] from the Greeks and the Romans and
[1:06:55] whereby that even if you were born into
[1:06:58] a family and you was of their genus
[1:07:00] their seed their kind their blood and it
[1:07:03] was your fathers and but sure for sure
[1:07:05] that you belong to them but you didn't
[1:07:07] just get your inheritance automatically
[1:07:10] because you was of the Reagan family or
[1:07:12] the Smith or whoever you are but you had
[1:07:15] to go through it for a time of child
[1:07:18] training a time of proving so they would
[1:07:21] set you under a governor or one that
[1:07:24] would be able to train you and that
[1:07:26] Governor would give constant reports to
[1:07:29] the father of your behavior and it was
[1:07:31] your behavior that determined the amount
[1:07:34] of inheritance that you received now you
[1:07:37] might have a birth certificate and a
[1:07:39] birth record and proved yes you was born
[1:07:41] on that certain certain day it was not
[1:07:44] the birth certificate that gave you your
[1:07:46] inheritance but rather it was your
[1:07:49] behavior and as the governor come back
[1:07:52] and report it to the father and he said
[1:07:54] your boy is really doing good he's 18
[1:07:57] now and I'll tell you I gave him
[1:07:59] authority to do this and do that and he
[1:08:02] is really doing good I gave him
[1:08:04] permission to be able to use your name
[1:08:06] and write a check the other day I sent
[1:08:09] him down there I went along with him and
[1:08:10] then I told him I said now take take
[1:08:12] your father's Goods out there and barter
[1:08:15] and trade and sell and I just kind of
[1:08:17] stood off and I watched him and I
[1:08:19] watched the way he'd done and he took
[1:08:21] those sheep and traded them out because
[1:08:23] we needed some donkeys and we needed a
[1:08:25] few camels and I watched him and he he
[1:08:28] didn't stick nothing in his pocket no
[1:08:30] under the table sort of saying I'm
[1:08:32] telling you how he's doing good you'll
[1:08:35] imagine when that father would hear that
[1:08:36] report he said oh my that's my boy oh
[1:08:40] that's wonderful well I'll tell you what
[1:08:43] governor what I want you to do is I want
[1:08:45] you to give him just a little bit more
[1:08:47] Authority and watch him now I just kind
[1:08:50] of don't let him know you're watching
[1:08:51] him but give him a little bit more stuff
[1:08:54] let him have a little bit more of my
[1:08:56] name let him have a little bit more
[1:08:58] liberality and watch him give him a
[1:09:00] little bit more in his allowance and
[1:09:02] watch what he'll do what if that boy got
[1:09:05] out there and he found him down there in
[1:09:06] a gambling Den somewhere and he found
[1:09:09] him doing things that he wouldn't do his
[1:09:11] father if he's a real good father he's
[1:09:13] not going to give him more Authority
[1:09:15] he's not going to give him more money
[1:09:18] but actually he's going to pull back
[1:09:20] until that boy proves that he can be
[1:09:23] trusted well I hope somebody's sharing
[1:09:26] me today God wants us to be adopted Sons
[1:09:30] and Daughters of God let me just give
[1:09:32] you a little preview of what God is
[1:09:35] looking for in this age it's not church
[1:09:38] membership it's not people that can just
[1:09:40] come and be there and be a part of
[1:09:42] church but the prophet of God said he
[1:09:45] hoped and prayed that he would live for
[1:09:49] the hour that was going to rise when the
[1:09:53] sons of God
[1:09:55] would stop disease
[1:10:00] they would stop
[1:10:04] cancer
[1:10:07] not just pray for it
[1:10:11] but stop it
[1:10:16] that will not come
[1:10:18] if father can't trust us
[1:10:22] how many preachers do we have
[1:10:25] that God could give them the power and
[1:10:28] authority
[1:10:29] to stop
[1:10:31] cancer
[1:10:37] or how many of them
[1:10:40] would take that power and become a
[1:10:42] stuffed shirt well I prayed for this one
[1:10:44] and I did this and I did that you see
[1:10:47] where that's our report card
[1:10:49] we're telling father what we're going to
[1:10:52] do okay father now this is the way I'm
[1:10:54] going to behave when you give me
[1:10:56] Authority this is what I'm going to do
[1:10:59] I'm going to take part of the credit for
[1:11:03] me
[1:11:05] you're not sending father a good report
[1:11:08] about your behavior
[1:11:10] you see father will do the same thing
[1:11:12] with a singer or a songwriter or a
[1:11:15] musician he will give us talents and
[1:11:18] give us abilities and then according to
[1:11:20] the way it affects our makeup boy can I
[1:11:23] sing good what do y'all think Don I sing
[1:11:25] good wow what a singer I Am you realize
[1:11:28] you're just cutting yourself off for
[1:11:30] more of the supply line
[1:11:32] so what do we want to do the more God
[1:11:34] uses us the littler we get not the
[1:11:37] bigger we get and then if that is the
[1:11:40] equation and that is the way we put it
[1:11:42] together that the more God does the more
[1:11:44] we humble ourselves and we keep
[1:11:47] ourselves small in our own sight and I
[1:11:50] found this out years ago it doesn't
[1:11:52] really matter how many people that the
[1:11:55] devil puts around the man of God to try
[1:11:58] to exalt him and you watch it he'll do
[1:12:00] it every time every time God will raise
[1:12:03] up a man Satan will put people around
[1:12:06] him who will try to make an idol out of
[1:12:09] him well if he understands that he will
[1:12:12] constantly cut that down he'll strike it
[1:12:15] he'll strike it or they'll get sick of
[1:12:18] hearing it but you got to trust him
[1:12:19] because he knows what he's doing well
[1:12:22] he's in no danger of that hurting him
[1:12:25] until he himself begins to believe it
[1:12:28] you see so Satan will put people around
[1:12:31] him oh brother they ain't nobody he
[1:12:33] preaches like you they ain't nobody can
[1:12:35] sing like you they ain't nobody oh I've
[1:12:38] heard preachers preach and I'll tell you
[1:12:39] what I believe you've just about got the
[1:12:42] greatest Ministry and the message you
[1:12:43] better watch it you better watch it but
[1:12:46] as long as that man resents it coming
[1:12:49] from the congregation and he strikes
[1:12:52] against it there's no danger of that
[1:12:55] serpent biting him because the blood
[1:12:57] will be too rich but then what Satan
[1:13:01] will try to do is change the tactic and
[1:13:04] try to attack him personally and
[1:13:06] convince him to where he begins to look
[1:13:09] at himself and he Compares himself with
[1:13:12] other ministers well you know God is
[1:13:14] using me in a greater way than this
[1:13:16] brother and that brother and our church
[1:13:18] is bigger and we've got bigger bigger
[1:13:21] bigger more more more more more and the
[1:13:24] way to get bigger bigger more and more
[1:13:26] and more is get little little little
[1:13:27] little
[1:13:29] because when we get bigger bigger bigger
[1:13:31] and begin to think bigger bigger bigger
[1:13:33] we're getting a stuffed head and we
[1:13:34] ain't going to be able to go no farther
[1:13:36] in God I wish somebody would preach with
[1:13:38] me this morning
[1:13:40] and you know we send God that and then
[1:13:42] whenever we send God this message then
[1:13:44] God can no longer be able to reflect in
[1:13:48] us more of the abundance of the spirit
[1:13:51] of adoption now we can walk into a phase
[1:13:54] of that and the more we get there the
[1:13:56] more the anointing under the Equal
[1:13:58] anointing of the last day under the old
[1:14:00] of the Seven Seals that the spirit
[1:14:03] of adoption will be released believe
[1:14:05] what you want think whatever you want I
[1:14:07] believe will write on the verge of the
[1:14:09] greatest thing we have ever seen in our
[1:14:11] entire lives I think we will Marvel at
[1:14:16] what the Lord God will do in front of us
[1:14:18] if we will be able to stay little and
[1:14:21] small and humble ourselves
[1:14:24] in his presence but the very moment we
[1:14:28] begin to look at ourself and think we're
[1:14:31] this and that and the other we might as
[1:14:33] well close the doors and all just go
[1:14:35] back home because God will start cutting
[1:14:38] off the supply line because you see it's
[1:14:41] not just enough to say well I'm a
[1:14:43] preacher well that can be part of your
[1:14:45] adoption well I'm a song leader I'm a
[1:14:48] deacon I'm a trustee but that within
[1:14:50] itself is the mechanical side of
[1:14:52] adoption that you see adoption has two
[1:14:56] sides that is the mechanical side and
[1:14:59] the spiritual side which is the dynamic
[1:15:01] side and we can take the mechanics oh
[1:15:04] yes I'm a preacher I'm a pastor I'm a
[1:15:06] missionary I'm this I'm that that's the
[1:15:09] mechanical sign but it takes the dynamic
[1:15:12] side in order to anoint our mechanical
[1:15:15] side that will produce the works of the
[1:15:19] Messiah now if not it'll just produce
[1:15:22] our own work so I'll tell you right now
[1:15:24] minding your Works ain't going to raise
[1:15:26] the dead mind of your works is not going
[1:15:28] to stop cancer come on somebody minding
[1:15:31] your works is not going to produce the
[1:15:33] works of Saint John 14 12 that if any
[1:15:36] man believe on Me Or Glory these things
[1:15:38] he's going to do is that what your Bible
[1:15:40] tells us in Saint John 15 7 if you abide
[1:15:43] me and by words abide in you ask what
[1:15:45] you will Psalms 37 and 4 Delight thou
[1:15:48] self also in the Lord and He will give
[1:15:50] Thee the desires of thine heart whatever
[1:15:52] you ask in my name I will do it beloved
[1:15:55] I wish above all things that thou mayest
[1:15:58] prosper and be in hell even as thy soul
[1:16:00] prospers that's God's word and we quote
[1:16:03] the mechanical side and then we cut our
[1:16:06] own throats
[1:16:07] from the dynamic side the very moment we
[1:16:11] become exalted
[1:16:14] can I go on
[1:16:16] you're saying please please we don't
[1:16:18] like this devil well it's part of it
[1:16:21] you see us children we need protection
[1:16:24] and help
[1:16:26] I don't mind telling you I need
[1:16:28] protection
[1:16:31] not from just demons
[1:16:33] I need protection
[1:16:36] from me
[1:16:40] and you know who you need protection
[1:16:42] from the most
[1:16:43] don't look at over at your wife uh don't
[1:16:46] look at your youngins take your mirror
[1:16:49] out and take a selfie it's you
[1:16:52] you are your greatest enemy
[1:16:57] now I want you to notice the words that
[1:16:59] Paul uses here in Romans when he says
[1:17:01] that you have received a spirit of
[1:17:03] adoption whereby we cry so this is not
[1:17:07] shouting now this is not jumping this is
[1:17:11] not rejoicing but the word that he uses
[1:17:14] look at the word that he uses we cry
[1:17:18] so we cry Abba
[1:17:21] father
[1:17:23] the other is actually an Aramaic word
[1:17:27] strange why that Paul would use this
[1:17:30] just like Jesus did
[1:17:32] so it's a word that is in the original
[1:17:35] Aramaic language
[1:17:37] so the translation the Greek translators
[1:17:41] when they translate this they just left
[1:17:43] it in this form
[1:17:45] but whenever they use the second word
[1:17:47] Abba which and then Father which is
[1:17:51] Peter p-a-t-e-r tater
[1:17:55] so Paul is addressing
[1:17:58] how that we when we come to God under
[1:18:01] the spirit of adoption
[1:18:04] that we need to
[1:18:06] pray in this way
[1:18:09] dear
[1:18:11] father
[1:18:13] Abba
[1:18:15] Abba
[1:18:18] not father father
[1:18:20] but dear
[1:18:22] or sir
[1:18:24] it's a petition
[1:18:27] that Jesus Christ himself coined
[1:18:32] it's a time of need
[1:18:35] and great desperation
[1:18:38] you mean after the spirit of adoption
[1:18:40] yes
[1:18:41] so we don't become exalted
[1:18:45] so we move from the realm of fear and
[1:18:47] move over into the spirit of adoption so
[1:18:50] we need children that of God that will
[1:18:53] cry out and recognize their needs so we
[1:18:56] address him in the language of affection
[1:19:00] and enduring confidence
[1:19:04] Abba Father
[1:19:06] Abba Father
[1:19:10] dear father
[1:19:12] precious father
[1:19:15] my father
[1:19:18] Hallelujah
[1:19:21] this is from the word the Chaldean word
[1:19:26] a B in the Old Testament
[1:19:30] the Chaldean word for father
[1:19:33] so the union of the two words
[1:19:35] of a father is an endeared relation that
[1:19:41] we have with God so notice this again in
[1:19:44] in Genesis chapter 22 verse 7 the first
[1:19:48] time AB is used in the Bible
[1:19:52] is when Isaac is following his father
[1:19:57] and Isaac is a is a well-taught boy
[1:20:01] he knows the order of worship
[1:20:05] so his father tells him look son Let's
[1:20:07] Go appear to this certain certain place
[1:20:08] that God would tell us and we're going
[1:20:10] to offer an offering to the Lord
[1:20:14] so he gets the wood and he lays it on
[1:20:16] Isaac's back
[1:20:18] and he gets the fire
[1:20:21] you imagine Isaac starts thinking
[1:20:23] brother Jack now wait a minute
[1:20:26] here's the wood
[1:20:28] here's the fire
[1:20:30] but there's no offering
[1:20:33] how are we going to worship God
[1:20:36] without an offering
[1:20:38] I'll tell you one thing I think our
[1:20:40] young people
[1:20:41] would be much better off to be able to
[1:20:43] talk the right approach to worship
[1:20:46] then and instead of spending so much
[1:20:48] time on video games
[1:20:51] spending so much time feeling their head
[1:20:53] with all different types of movies that
[1:20:55] shouldn't even be watched in the first
[1:20:57] place
[1:20:58] spending so much time on Facebook and
[1:21:00] Instagram and here and there and there
[1:21:03] this boy knew how to worship God
[1:21:07] he's a lad
[1:21:10] and he's pondering
[1:21:12] and Isaac spoken to Abraham his father
[1:21:14] unsaid
[1:21:16] my Abba
[1:21:19] notice how he coins this now my
[1:21:24] my eyebrow
[1:21:28] why is he saying this
[1:21:30] it is a petition of submission
[1:21:35] to his father's will
[1:21:39] now this is a long arduous Journey he
[1:21:42] doesn't even know where they're going
[1:21:44] he doesn't understand why they're going
[1:21:46] this way without a lamb
[1:21:48] Abraham probably by this point knows
[1:21:51] that God is going to require him as far
[1:21:54] as he knows
[1:21:55] to present his son's life as a sacrifice
[1:22:00] but Isaac still doesn't know it but yet
[1:22:02] he's submitting himself to his father's
[1:22:06] will and being in this submissive State
[1:22:08] he calls upon his father in these terms
[1:22:13] my father
[1:22:16] not just Abba
[1:22:19] but my father
[1:22:24] I trust you
[1:22:27] I don't understand what you're doing
[1:22:30] I don't understand what's going on
[1:22:33] my father and he said you're am I my son
[1:22:37] and he said behold the fire
[1:22:39] and the wood
[1:22:41] but where is the Lamb for the burnt
[1:22:44] offering now he has complete faith and
[1:22:46] trust in his father Dawson utter one
[1:22:50] word
[1:22:52] of discontentment
[1:22:54] and this hard difficult Journey
[1:22:57] because he trusted
[1:22:59] but now he's seeking for understanding
[1:23:03] and he doesn't approach his father with
[1:23:07] an attitude
[1:23:09] oh Hallelujah but he says my
[1:23:14] father
[1:23:16] my Abba
[1:23:18] my Abba
[1:23:21] I need help
[1:23:24] and Abraham answers back my boy
[1:23:31] son
[1:23:34] my son
[1:23:37] what a relationship my father yes my son
[1:23:44] I don't want to just know him as father
[1:23:49] I want to be able to address him as
[1:23:53] my father
[1:23:56] Hallelujah
[1:23:58] Hallelujah
[1:24:01] but now we must be coming anxious by the
[1:24:04] Jack and wondering and maybe it's the
[1:24:06] sins
[1:24:09] of fear
[1:24:12] oh Noah
[1:24:14] daddy you're you're not
[1:24:18] surely you're not thinking of doing
[1:24:21] what the Canaanites do
[1:24:24] for the Canaanites offer their children
[1:24:27] to their gods
[1:24:30] surely that's not what you're going to
[1:24:31] do
[1:24:33] my father
[1:24:35] why are you letting me go through this
[1:24:39] my father
[1:24:41] yes my son
[1:24:46] where's the sacrifice my father my son
[1:24:50] God will provide for himself
[1:24:55] apparent elephant
[1:25:00] David declares God
[1:25:03] as being the father of the children of
[1:25:05] Israel forever First Chronicles 29 10.
[1:25:08] wherefore David blessed the Lord before
[1:25:10] all the congregation and David said
[1:25:13] blessed be thou Lord God
[1:25:17] Jehovah Elohim
[1:25:20] of Israel
[1:25:22] our
[1:25:23] Abba
[1:25:26] forever
[1:25:28] and ever
[1:25:30] Isaiah coins the same term he writes
[1:25:33] about the Everlasting name of Abba
[1:25:36] Father Our Redeemer Isaiah 63 16
[1:25:39] doubtless Thou Art Our Father
[1:25:42] though Abraham be ignorant of us
[1:25:47] and Israel acknowledge us not thou O
[1:25:50] Lord art our Abba
[1:25:55] Our Redeemer
[1:25:58] Hallelujah
[1:25:59] notice he also in sorts the
[1:26:02] acknowledgment to the people of God in
[1:26:03] Isaiah 64 8 but now O Lord Thou Art Our
[1:26:08] Father we are the clay and thou art the
[1:26:12] Potter
[1:26:13] we are the work
[1:26:15] of thy hands
[1:26:17] Jeremiah chapter 3 verse 19 but I said
[1:26:20] how shall I put thee among the children
[1:26:22] and give thee a pleasant land a goodly
[1:26:25] Heritage of the hosts of the Nations and
[1:26:27] I said Thou shalt call me
[1:26:31] my father
[1:26:34] and thou shalt not turn away from me
[1:26:38] but notice in Mark Chapter 14 verse 36
[1:26:41] the first time we find the two words put
[1:26:44] together
[1:26:45] Abba Peter
[1:26:48] my dear father
[1:26:52] my dear father
[1:26:56] the Lord Jesus in The Garden of
[1:26:58] Gethsemane
[1:26:59] and he went forward a little and fell on
[1:27:02] the ground and prayed
[1:27:04] that if it were possible
[1:27:08] the hour might pass
[1:27:11] from him
[1:27:14] now the second Adam not in the Garden of
[1:27:17] Eden
[1:27:18] but in the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:27:22] the Bible tells us in the book of
[1:27:23] Hebrews though he were a son yet he
[1:27:25] learned obedience by the things that he
[1:27:27] suffered
[1:27:28] and the Bible goes on to tell us
[1:27:31] that he feared
[1:27:33] Jesus
[1:27:35] feared
[1:27:39] death is a few hours away
[1:27:42] and his Humanity
[1:27:45] goes to feeling for the first time
[1:27:48] the closeness
[1:27:50] of death
[1:27:53] and how does he pray about
[1:27:57] Peter
[1:27:59] armor
[1:28:01] painter
[1:28:04] and he sweats and sweats
[1:28:07] until the capillaries in his bloodstream
[1:28:10] begin to break
[1:28:13] and are released out of the sweat glands
[1:28:17] in his body
[1:28:21] it must have been awful
[1:28:23] to have heard him
[1:28:26] if we could go there this morning for a
[1:28:29] few moments
[1:28:31] I can see him there in the Darkness
[1:28:35] his flesh is trembling
[1:28:38] and shaking
[1:28:40] he's down on his knees
[1:28:44] maybe kneeling on a rock
[1:28:47] great drops of sweat as it starts out
[1:28:50] under such arduous pain
[1:28:54] of prayer I don't know if you've ever
[1:28:56] been there before
[1:28:58] but I've been there a few times
[1:29:01] one time many years ago
[1:29:05] casting a devil out of a person
[1:29:09] and I prayed and I prayed
[1:29:13] some folks here with me that day
[1:29:17] and I prayed until my clothes were wet
[1:29:21] my socks my shoes
[1:29:24] praying
[1:29:26] that devil answering in an ultimal voice
[1:29:33] saying you will not make me leave
[1:29:38] I
[1:29:39] was in the Garden of Eden
[1:29:44] I have been here
[1:29:47] for a long time
[1:29:51] and the anointing would move in this
[1:29:53] place where I was
[1:29:55] with the Saints praying with me
[1:29:58] but the gym remembers that he was there
[1:30:01] and the presence what God would come in
[1:30:03] in such a mighty way
[1:30:07] and that devil would get so afraid and
[1:30:10] so scared
[1:30:11] and the individual would quake and
[1:30:13] tremble and shake
[1:30:15] and the anointing would move
[1:30:18] the psychic would hit against a block
[1:30:20] wall
[1:30:22] and it would back off
[1:30:24] and we would pray again and the
[1:30:26] anointing would move and it would back
[1:30:29] off this went on for several hours
[1:30:32] until finally the individual passed out
[1:30:38] and I told
[1:30:41] the companion their mate
[1:30:45] I said we're going to go home and rest
[1:30:46] for a bit
[1:30:49] I want you to call me when they wake up
[1:30:54] the person said is it gone I said no
[1:30:56] it's not gone
[1:30:58] she just under such exhaustion
[1:31:02] that he can't talk no more
[1:31:07] what did I need
[1:31:08] Abba Father
[1:31:12] my dear father
[1:31:20] we went back a few hours later
[1:31:25] the individual had come back around
[1:31:29] seemed different
[1:31:33] seemed different
[1:31:38] but you see a devil can come and go
[1:31:41] as he pleases
[1:31:44] until one was Authority
[1:31:47] adjours him in the name of Jesus and
[1:31:51] makes him leave he will not be able to
[1:31:53] come back again
[1:31:55] unless that body house
[1:31:58] will allow him to do so
[1:32:05] you see friends when we're talking about
[1:32:07] this sort of thing it's more than
[1:32:08] jumping
[1:32:09] more than running
[1:32:11] more than shouting
[1:32:13] for a devil to obey you
[1:32:17] you better know what you're doing
[1:32:23] Jesus is experiencing this fear
[1:32:28] as I walked into that place I don't know
[1:32:30] that I'll ever forget it as long as I
[1:32:32] live
[1:32:33] the individual was a small person real
[1:32:35] small and stature
[1:32:38] now walked into the door a man's voice
[1:32:42] spoke out of this person's body
[1:32:45] and said
[1:32:51] get it out of here
[1:33:02] see it wasn't me
[1:33:05] what was it the spirit
[1:33:09] adoption
[1:33:12] hmm
[1:33:14] oh boy they're nervous now ain't they
[1:33:16] uh-huh I wasn't just talking about you
[1:33:19] all either
[1:33:22] oh the work
[1:33:24] that God has for his church
[1:33:29] Hallelujah
[1:33:35] and he said Ava Peter
[1:33:40] all things are possible unto thee
[1:33:44] take away this cup from me
[1:33:48] nevertheless not but I will
[1:33:52] but what thou will so Jesus is
[1:33:55] experiencing for the first time
[1:33:58] this human anxiety and turmoil and fear
[1:34:02] you imagine his Humanity been flooded
[1:34:06] with fear not just death
[1:34:09] but to become sin
[1:34:19] he prays to Father God
[1:34:23] the spirit which now dwells in him in
[1:34:25] the fullness
[1:34:27] because it knows it will be long
[1:34:30] it will leave him
[1:34:34] the father
[1:34:36] will leave
[1:34:38] a son
[1:34:42] spirit will go out of the humanity
[1:34:44] and the body must die alone
[1:34:50] no wonder he's saying Haba Peter
[1:34:54] Abba
[1:34:56] my dear father
[1:34:59] my dear sir
[1:35:01] please
[1:35:03] don't leave me
[1:35:07] don't leave me
[1:35:13] now maybe some of you think you can live
[1:35:16] without the Lord Jesus in your life
[1:35:19] I'm going to tell you one thing
[1:35:21] I wouldn't want to live with him
[1:35:24] for 30 without him for 30 seconds in
[1:35:27] this world
[1:35:29] as mad as I've made hell it would be bad
[1:35:34] any child of God sitting here today
[1:35:36] that's filled with the Holy Ghost you
[1:35:38] ought to feel the same way I wouldn't
[1:35:40] want to live one minute without Jesus
[1:35:42] Christ in my life
[1:35:46] when you think about it when you're
[1:35:48] facing such things as I've described to
[1:35:50] you this morning and you've heard me
[1:35:52] tell it before when I was in Michigan
[1:35:54] many years ago preaching and I was
[1:35:56] awakened in the pastor's house and I was
[1:35:59] in the bed there and I heard a noise
[1:36:02] and it was the headboard
[1:36:05] bumping against the wall and the bed was
[1:36:08] moving
[1:36:10] and I woke up and I looked at the end of
[1:36:12] that bed there stood a creature
[1:36:15] veiled in a Black Veil
[1:36:18] and his head was like back in the veil
[1:36:21] like this and I could see his eyes
[1:36:24] and he spoke out in an audible voice and
[1:36:26] said took his finger like this and his
[1:36:28] finger was crooked and he said I've come
[1:36:31] to take your life
[1:36:35] and when he said it his legs bumped
[1:36:37] against the bed again and the headboard
[1:36:40] hit the wall
[1:36:42] brother Donna she felt like shouting you
[1:36:45] got to be kidding me I was scared to
[1:36:47] death
[1:36:51] I didn't take my eyes off of him
[1:36:54] but I raised up in the bed I took my
[1:36:56] hands and raised up in the bed upon the
[1:36:59] pill and I said Satan
[1:37:01] in the name of Jesus I rebuke you
[1:37:06] Step Closer again hit the bed I sat in
[1:37:09] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:37:12] I rebuke you go back to hell
[1:37:15] where you come from
[1:37:17] and I watched him as he stood back and
[1:37:21] he backed out and backed out the room I
[1:37:22] was in was like a bonus room over a
[1:37:24] garage and there was a window there at
[1:37:26] the end of it and he backed out and
[1:37:28] disappeared into that wounded she felt
[1:37:31] like shouting you got to be kidding me I
[1:37:33] sweating bullets
[1:37:35] sweat pouring out of my face sweating
[1:37:37] running out of my hands why it's a human
[1:37:39] reaction to experience fear when you
[1:37:43] encounter hell it's a human reaction to
[1:37:47] experience fear when the doctor says
[1:37:50] cancer when the doctor says TB when the
[1:37:53] doctor says you are incurable oh
[1:37:56] Hallelujah but if you can get yourself
[1:37:59] calm and the spirit of adoption can
[1:38:03] anoint you then you can move from the
[1:38:06] soul and it will capture imagination it
[1:38:09] will capture thoughts it will capture
[1:38:12] she takes feel smelly here and said let
[1:38:15] me do the talking
[1:38:20] then say from the soul can say I refuse
[1:38:26] to be controlled
[1:38:28] by fear
[1:38:36] as Carol and I pulled into the cancer
[1:38:38] center
[1:38:40] on Friday
[1:38:44] she said we never thought would ever be
[1:38:46] coming to this place did we
[1:38:49] I said no we sure didn't
[1:38:54] we walk in and sit down with our
[1:38:56] daughter Erica of course and we'll
[1:38:57] answer her husband
[1:38:58] that go through all the different tests
[1:39:00] and this and that and the other results
[1:39:01] of one thing and another
[1:39:04] nurse Center nurse practitioner then the
[1:39:06] doctor comes in
[1:39:09] now we're going to try this and we're
[1:39:10] going to do this
[1:39:12] now he says I cannot
[1:39:15] cure you
[1:39:18] there has no one
[1:39:20] ever
[1:39:22] been cured
[1:39:24] of what Erica has
[1:39:28] fear would say
[1:39:30] well you better get a funeral subject
[1:39:32] ready I have no funeral text I'm not
[1:39:35] planning a funeral
[1:39:38] come on Saints we ain't picking out no
[1:39:40] songs well you're picking out no burial
[1:39:43] clothes
[1:39:47] and the doctor said I cannot kill you
[1:39:50] and he did this
[1:39:52] raise both of his arms like this and his
[1:39:54] fingers up toward the heavens but God
[1:39:58] has the last say
[1:40:00] hahaha
[1:40:04] praise the Lord
[1:40:11] what do I say in those times what do you
[1:40:13] say
[1:40:16] forever father
[1:40:24] Hallelujah
[1:40:31] my father
[1:40:37] he realizes the end
[1:40:40] of a human life
[1:40:44] now remember Jesus will never live a
[1:40:47] human life again
[1:40:51] he's hours away from the end of human
[1:40:54] existence
[1:40:57] so he fears
[1:40:59] so he hesitates
[1:41:01] Immortal fear
[1:41:04] he could pray any way he wanted to
[1:41:06] Lord God I don't know Jehovah Shalom
[1:41:09] Jehovah Jehovah Our Redeemer Jehovah Our
[1:41:12] Savior Jehovah our Banner but instead of
[1:41:15] uh
[1:41:17] aha
[1:41:19] dear
[1:41:21] father
[1:41:24] you say whenever you're going through
[1:41:26] things like this and you can still call
[1:41:28] him dear
[1:41:30] wonderful sweet
[1:41:35] you don't realize what a victory he's
[1:41:36] been able to work in your life
[1:41:41] instead of getting an attitude
[1:41:44] God
[1:41:45] uh-huh
[1:41:47] you see that's what Satan was able to
[1:41:49] convince Eve of in the Garden of Eden
[1:41:51] yea has God said
[1:41:54] notice in Genesis 1 God did this God God
[1:41:57] until Genesis 2 whenever God brought
[1:41:59] family into the Earth and then the Bible
[1:42:01] adds to that Lord God
[1:42:05] Jehovah with his family and what was
[1:42:08] Satan able to do bring Eve back to their
[1:42:11] pre-existence name yea hath God said
[1:42:16] impersonal uncaring
[1:42:20] That Couldn't bother her at all
[1:42:23] but she took the bait
[1:42:25] and then she starts saying the same
[1:42:27] thing well God did say this and God did
[1:42:30] say that
[1:42:33] so when you're in the midst of your
[1:42:34] trials don't let go of ABBA
[1:42:41] what was Jesus doing the same thing that
[1:42:44] Isaac did
[1:42:46] my father
[1:42:48] I trust you
[1:42:52] I trust you
[1:42:56] second Corinthians 6 18 and I will be
[1:43:00] your father and you will be my sons and
[1:43:02] daughters
[1:43:04] says the Lord
[1:43:06] Almighty Romans 8 16 the spirit is cell
[1:43:10] bearish witness with our spirit that we
[1:43:12] are the children of God second Timothy 1
[1:43:14] 7 for God hath not given us
[1:43:18] the spirit
[1:43:20] of fear
[1:43:28] the spirit is of fear is not your human
[1:43:31] reaction to a tragedy a trauma or
[1:43:35] something that is frightening
[1:43:39] it is a demon
[1:43:41] that hangs around you
[1:43:44] and causes things which should be able
[1:43:48] to pass within a matter of seconds or
[1:43:51] minutes
[1:43:52] but instead it is like if we could see
[1:43:54] it in the fourth dimension it would be
[1:43:56] like a dark cloud
[1:43:58] it's a being
[1:44:01] and it hangs over you
[1:44:04] and it makes everything that is fearful
[1:44:08] makes it that much worse
[1:44:14] God has not given us the spirit of fear
[1:44:17] but of
[1:44:20] this is a Greek word dunamis which is
[1:44:22] where we get our word Dynamite from
[1:44:26] of power and of love and of a sound mind
[1:44:29] first John 4 18 There Is No Love No Fear
[1:44:32] in love and the church said
[1:44:35] there is no fear
[1:44:38] and love
[1:44:39] but perfect love
[1:44:42] cast us out fear
[1:44:45] because fear has
[1:44:52] that means experienced it
[1:44:57] I tell you right now in the name of
[1:44:59] Jesus
[1:45:02] if you'll believe
[1:45:05] some of you believe this service today
[1:45:10] set free
[1:45:22] thank you Lord God
[1:45:30] let's jump over here brother skip a
[1:45:31] couple of scriptures trying to jump to
[1:45:33] Israel in the church how close yours is
[1:45:34] momentarily
[1:45:36] this has been the greatest thing that
[1:45:38] I've found among Christian people
[1:45:39] throughout the entire world
[1:45:43] has been a fear they're always afraid
[1:45:47] when a little sickness strikes they're
[1:45:49] afraid many I wonder sometimes and now
[1:45:52] I'm along with you
[1:45:53] but now what I'm trying to do tonight
[1:45:55] and this week to come
[1:45:57] is to try to drive that fear away
[1:46:01] by God's word
[1:46:04] again it says one of the greatest
[1:46:06] courses
[1:46:09] on the church today
[1:46:12] is fear
[1:46:15] one of the greatest curses
[1:46:20] so who put it on us
[1:46:23] who put it on us
[1:46:26] don't you notice he's not saying Sinners
[1:46:28] and lost and the people the infidels and
[1:46:31] agnostics and so on but on the church
[1:46:36] again he says in the next one the
[1:46:38] greatest thing that I find against the
[1:46:40] church tonight
[1:46:43] is fear
[1:46:45] Everybody's scared to death about
[1:46:47] something what are you scared about if a
[1:46:50] man's born again he should be happy
[1:46:52] Carefree just stop these fellas singing
[1:46:56] up here in the brother testifying back
[1:46:58] there just free
[1:47:01] so it must have been some folks of her
[1:47:03] singing and they were singing like this
[1:47:05] free
[1:47:06] and he was using them as a comparison
[1:47:09] says see that's the way all the rest
[1:47:10] y'all ought to be y'all ought to be free
[1:47:12] like them people are singing
[1:47:15] oh my Carefree there ain't nothing can
[1:47:19] harm you nothing present nothing future
[1:47:23] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:47:26] God that's in Christ Jesus
