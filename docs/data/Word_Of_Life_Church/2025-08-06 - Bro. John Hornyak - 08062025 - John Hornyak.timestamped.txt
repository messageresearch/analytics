[8:48] tonight. So, I'd like to thank the Lord
[8:50] for my wife Laura, who recently turned
[8:52] 65 years old. As some of you may know,
[8:55] at the age of 26 years old, she was
[8:58] diagnosed with stage 1 pancreatic
[9:01] cancer. The day before the surgery, she
[9:04] said, "I'm a Christian, so I'm a winner
[9:06] either way, but I want to raise my
[9:08] children."
[9:10] By prayer and a great surgical team at
[9:12] Duke, God gave her the desire of her
[9:14] heart and she now has 11 grandchildren.
[9:18] Please pray for her as she goes for
[9:20] tests at the VA hospital tomorrow. Her

[15:56] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads. Dear heavenly
[15:59] father, we just first want to thank you
[16:01] for how great you truly are to us, Lord.
[16:03] We may never fully comprehend how great
[16:06] you are and the things that you've done
[16:07] to us and done for us until we get on
[16:10] that other side, dear heavenly father.
[16:12] But even now, we still thank you for the
[16:14] things that you've kept us from and
[16:16] everything. Dear heavenly father, I pray
[16:18] may you just allow us to enter into the
[16:20] service tonight, Lord. We know what the
[16:22] power that worship and singing has,
[16:24] Lord. So may we give our all in this
[16:26] first part so we can tear down those
[16:28] walls like Paul and Silas did when they
[16:29] began to sing. Lord, those walls of
[16:32] doubt or those walls of distractions,
[16:34] dear heavenly father, may they just fall
[16:36] right now, dear Lord Jesus. May we just
[16:39] be so in tune with you and what you want
[16:42] us to hear tonight, Lord. Be with
[16:44] brother John who's bringing the word
[16:45] tonight. Help him just to step aside,
[16:47] Lord, and just go through him, Lord, and
[16:50] speak to our hearts. Lord, I pray you be
[16:52] with the remainder of this song service
[16:54] and these many needs. Dear heavenly
[16:56] father, you see brother Steve where he's
[16:57] at, Lord. So many prayers have been made
[17:00] for him. And I pray you continue to
[17:02] renew his strength, Lord, and lift him
[17:04] up now, dear heavenly father. And that
[17:07] little four-year-old boy, Lord, I know
[17:09] there's many parents in here that could
[17:11] put themselves in that position and
[17:12] imagine if that was their child. So may
[17:14] they use that faith and that passion and
[17:16] pray for that family. Dear heavenly
[17:18] father, and all these other needs, Lord,
[17:20] I can't remember them, but you see them,
[17:21] Lord. I pray you just help each and
[17:23] every one of them, Lord. Go to them now
[17:24] where they're at. We love them. Thank
[17:26] you. And we'll give you all the praise,
[17:27] honor, and glory. It's in your name and
[17:29] by your power. Amen.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother. Praise the
[17:33] Lord. Ushers, if you want to come at
[17:34] this time, we receive the evening
[17:36] offering. You give us unto the Lord. So

[30:47] sung his song, it was during the prayer
[30:49] line and I battled singing it cuz I
[30:53] stood there and I was like, "This is not
[30:54] a congregational song. This is not a
[30:56] congregational song." And then Aaron, he
[31:00] looked at me and he's like, "All right,
[31:01] it's your time to I was like, this is
[31:03] not a congregational
[31:07] song." And then everybody proved me
[31:09] wrong and said, "This was this is a very
[31:10] good congregational song. So, if you'll
[31:13] help me sing it.
[31:16] If you've been walking the same old road
[31:19] for miles and miles.
[31:23] If you've been hearing the same old
[31:25] voice tell the same old lies.

[31:32] holes inside,
[31:35] there's a better life.
[31:38] There's a better life.
[31:42] If you got pain,
[31:45] he's a pain taker.
[31:48] If you feel lost,

[35:05] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; It's good to be here. I just pray that
[35:10] you come expecting.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; You know, I've said it before.
[35:15] Not too high.
[35:18] I can't do this.
[35:20] He can.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; It's like you can't sit there, but he
[35:24] can.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Right. You're not going to get anything
[35:27] if you just sit there.
[35:30] You come expecting.
[35:32] What am I doing?
[35:35] Uh if you don't come expecting, you're
[35:38] just come to a building. But if you come
[35:41] expecting, then he's going to speak to
[35:43] you.
[35:44] Amen. God bless you. If you would turn
[35:48] with me to
[35:50] Genesis,
[35:56] Genesis 12. We're going to read several
[35:59] places, Lord willing.
[36:04] Verses 1 and three. Let's go to the Lord
[36:06] in prayer.
[36:09] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful to
[36:12] you, Lord.
[36:14] We love you so much and we thank you,
[36:15] Lord Jesus, that you've called us. And
[36:18] Lord, not only did you call us, Lord,
[36:21] but you give us the grace to respond to
[36:24] that call, Father.
[36:26] And Lord Jesus, we're so thankful to
[36:28] you, Lord. We see you in every avenue of
[36:32] our lives, Lord.
[36:34] Lord, even when we're doing wrong, we
[36:36] we've got the grace to have you,
[36:40] Lord, tell us that we're wrong. We're so
[36:43] thankful for that, Lord. There's many
[36:45] people that do wrong and don't even know
[36:47] it, Father. Lord, as the bride of
[36:50] Christ, we're so
[36:52] blessed, Father. And Lord Jesus, tonight
[36:56] we're here, Lord, not to see one
[36:57] another. Although it's nice to see
[36:59] everybody, Lord, but we've come to see
[37:02] you, Lord Jesus.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; And we have to look past the veil many
[37:06] times, Lord. And tonight is is another
[37:08] night that we're we're asking that you
[37:10] would help not only myself look past the
[37:12] veil, Lord, and help me to understand
[37:16] that I'm speaking to God in flesh, but
[37:19] I'm asking that they would look past
[37:21] this veil and understand that God in
[37:25] flesh is speaking to them. Father, I
[37:27] pray that you would just take control of
[37:29] this service, Lord. You know what's on
[37:30] my heart. You know, Lord Jesus, that
[37:33] I've studied and I've looked at this,
[37:35] Lord. And
[37:37] well, to be honest, Lord, if my thoughts
[37:39] are here, I I don't want them. I just
[37:41] want you to have your way, Lord. I I
[37:44] pray that you would take these things
[37:45] and just make them and custom fit each
[37:48] and every individual. Lord, we love you
[37:51] and we thank you for it, Lord. We ask it
[37:54] in your name. Amen. Thank you for that.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:58] Lord willing, I'm going to
[38:01] speak on destroying all hope.
[38:04] Um destroying all hope.
[38:08] Um I know hope is faced, little sister,
[38:13] and it's important,
[38:15] but I I think sometimes that God wants
[38:18] us to destroy the hope and get to faith.
[38:23] Yeah.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Hope waivers,
[38:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[38:28] &gt;&gt; We've hoped for a lot of things in our
[38:30] lives, but when you have that faith that
[38:32] comes from God, it don't waver.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; It don't waver. And and another thing
[38:38] about hope, and I was just praying and
[38:40] thinking about this, you know,
[38:44] a Christian's faith
[38:47] doesn't determine
[38:50] the outcome. A real Christian's faith
[38:53] doesn't determine God's will.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? So,
[38:59] we can have all the faith in the world
[39:02] and we can really believe and we we've
[39:05] seen it even here in this church. We've
[39:07] really believed for Sister Erica.
[39:10] That didn't that didn't waver what God's
[39:13] will was.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; We were following general orders, right?
[39:17] &gt;&gt; We were doing exactly what God called us
[39:19] to do. just believe because there's
[39:22] nowhere in the scripture that says have
[39:23] faith and so and so is going to pass
[39:26] away. That's that's not what's in the
[39:28] scripture this have faith.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; But as a Christian, we have faith in God
[39:35] that his will will be done. as a real
[39:38] Christian. The ones that that fall away
[39:40] from from from God and Christianity are
[39:43] the ones that that say they have faith
[39:46] and they might actually have faith, but
[39:49] they don't have faith that God is going
[39:52] to do his perfect will.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying?
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, just keep that in mind. if
[40:00] we're going to I I I preached this in in
[40:03] Monosel a couple weeks ago, but the
[40:05] Lord's kind of turned it and we'll see
[40:07] how far he turned it. You know what I'm
[40:09] saying?
[40:11] Amen. Now the Lord said had said unto
[40:15] Abram, "Get thee out of thy country, and
[40:17] from thy kindred, and from thy father's
[40:20] house, unto the land that I will show
[40:22] thee,
[40:23] and I will make thee a great nation, and
[40:27] I will bless thee, and make thy name
[40:30] great, and thou shalt be a blessing,
[40:34] and I will make thee a great nation."
[40:36] Now, this is Abram, still not father of
[40:38] nations. This is just Abram.
[40:42] So, he's putting that promise forth,
[40:44] right?
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Believe it, receive it.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Y
[40:48] &gt;&gt; right.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Uh he will heal the sick. He will, you
[40:53] know, you I I've called you to prosper
[40:55] and be in good health. All those
[40:57] promises. There's a promise right here.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; And I will bless them that bless thee,
[41:03] and curse him that cursth thee. And in
[41:07] thee shall all families of the earth be
[41:09] blessed. Man, that's a lot of that's a
[41:12] lot of promises right there. That's a
[41:15] lot of things. That's that's God putting
[41:16] his for his word forth. He's sewing
[41:18] forth. I don't want to wear you out. Go
[41:20] ahead and be seated. Let me stand for a
[41:23] little while. You go ahead.
[41:33] Now, we're going to turn to to Genesis
[41:35] 13 uh 14- 16.
[41:45] And the Lord said unto Abram, after that
[41:48] Lot was separated from him, lift up now
[41:51] thine eyes, and look from the place with
[41:53] thou art northward and southward and
[41:56] eastward and westward. So we see here
[41:58] that God has he he made the promise.
[42:05] He made the promise
[42:07] and it's out there, but he's still not
[42:10] the father of nations.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; And there was things that he had to do.
[42:14] Now, now Abram believed God, right?
[42:18] &gt;&gt; He believed God. He was there. The faith
[42:20] was there. He had a supernatural
[42:21] interaction with God.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Just like every one of you, if you're
[42:25] real Christians, you've had a
[42:27] supernatural interaction with God with
[42:28] your salvation. That's something
[42:30] supernatural. Logically, humanity
[42:33] doesn't
[42:35] see this unknown being, right?
[42:38] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't see how in the world that
[42:41] he could save us
[42:43] &gt;&gt; naturally. But you've had a super
[42:46] something supernatural happen to you
[42:48] that you believe in Jesus Christ.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; So, we have a supernatural interaction
[42:52] with God. So, we're we're we're
[42:54] believing. That's faith. We believe in
[42:56] that. That's faith.
[43:03] But Abram had to separate from Lot. He
[43:06] had to start getting things out of his
[43:08] life that were interfering. Right. And
[43:10] so he's moved from justification, being
[43:12] called
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; into sanctification, getting cleaned up.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Right. But it still doesn't make him
[43:20] a father of nations.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; It's still not producing the seed.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Right. justification, sanctification.
[43:31] For all the land which thou seeest to
[43:34] thee will I give it and to thy seed
[43:36] forever. And I will make thy seed as the
[43:40] dust of the earth, so that the man so
[43:43] that if a man can number the dust of the
[43:46] earth, then shall thy seed also be
[43:49] numbered. So here he is repeating again.
[43:52] That's why we come to church. This ain't
[43:55] nothing new, brothers and sisters. I'm
[43:56] not here to surprise you with with new
[43:58] word. That's if I am, then you need to
[44:01] get me out of here because there ain't
[44:03] you know that's not right. This this is
[44:05] not new. I'm just maybe bringing in a
[44:07] different way or or I can express it in
[44:09] a way in in a moment in your life right
[44:12] now that you'll see it better.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Right?
[44:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not bringing anything new.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; So Abram is God is dealing with Abram
[44:20] the same way. He's telling him over and
[44:22] over again, your seed. You'll be
[44:24] blessed. You're the father of nations,
[44:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; And Abram's like, "Okay, all right. I
[44:31] I'm seeing it." And as now, Abram,
[44:33] sanctify yourself. All right. I can do
[44:36] that. I'm going to separate myself. Now,
[44:38] I'm a little hard-headed. It's going to
[44:40] take me a while. We can't go through the
[44:41] whole whole scripture. And I don't know
[44:43] anybody else like that.
[44:50] But old Abram, bless his heart,
[44:53] he was a little hard-headed. It took him
[44:55] a while. We know the story. I We don't
[44:58] have time
[45:00] to to rehash all that, but you
[45:02] understand where I'm coming from. And
[45:03] this these are not the these are just a
[45:05] couple points that that I picked up.
[45:07] Now, let's go to Genesis 18 verse 10.
[45:20] And he said,
[45:23] I will certainly return unto thee
[45:24] according to the time of life, and lo,
[45:26] Sarah, thy wife shall have a son. And
[45:30] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[45:32] was behind him.
[45:34] Now Abraham and Sarah were old and
[45:36] wellstricken in age, and it ceased to be
[45:38] with Sarah after the manner of women.
[45:41] So, here's that promise all those years
[45:43] ago and it's been repeated and it's been
[45:46] told and Abram was still believing
[45:51] &gt;&gt; but he had somebody very close to him
[45:54] &gt;&gt; that their faith had kind of fallen off.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; It kind of fell off.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; She's like, "Well, that was nice."
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, Abram, bless his heart.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah,
[46:10] &gt;&gt; it's kind of it's kind of shaken a
[46:12] little bit.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; We all have those
[46:15] &gt;&gt; in our lives.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; We all have those that we we go through
[46:20] the we we believe and we have this faith
[46:22] and we get sanctified and then we think
[46:25] we come across old friends or our family
[46:28] and they're saying,
[46:30] "Is that message really
[46:32] &gt;&gt; come on
[46:32] &gt;&gt; necessary?
[46:34] Is holiness really necessary?" That's
[46:37] good.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Do you really have to live that way?
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Was a prophet really necessary? I mean,
[46:46] there's plenty of Baptist churches that
[46:48] that have a lot to offer.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; If if you don't want to go to the
[46:53] Baptist, you can go to the Methodist or
[46:55] the the Pentecostals. Pentecostals.
[46:56] Shout.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and and work it out. I'm
[47:03] a good Christian. I don't know how many
[47:04] times I've heard that.
[47:06] I don't have to believe like that.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; I love God. They have faith.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; They have faith.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; They had to. They believe in Jesus
[47:19] Christ. That's
[47:19] &gt;&gt; right.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; But here they are.
[47:26] And those those things whisper in ear.
[47:27] We've had a great falling away from the
[47:29] message. Did they ever have really have
[47:31] faith?
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, they really had faith, but
[47:37] it only come to a spot.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Any anybody that can talk you into
[47:44] something can also talk you out of it.
[47:45] Right.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; There's something in me that I don't
[47:49] care that crazy. I don't I don't
[47:52] understand why in the world people would
[47:54] walk away from this.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; I just don't get it.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; It's hard for me to comprehend.
[48:01] And then I see the ones that have walked
[48:03] away and most of them their lives went
[48:09] &gt;&gt; they lost everything.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Their dignity.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Used to have a standard.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Now there's no standard.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Huh.
[48:28] But they had faith.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't the faith of God.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; And they went ahead and took God's
[48:38] permissive will.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Therefore Sarah laughed within herself,
[48:48] saying, "After I am waxed old, shall I
[48:50] have pleasure with my Lord also?" or
[48:53] being old also doesn't make sense. This
[48:57] don't this don't line up.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Everybody in the world is is is doing
[49:02] this. I can come in and I can worship
[49:05] God and I can
[49:07] at any old church.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; God so loved the world.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[49:15] &gt;&gt; he did.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; God so loved the world that he gave his
[49:18] only begotten son. They had faith in
[49:20] that.
[49:27] And the Lord said unto Abram, Abraham,
[49:30] wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall
[49:32] I of shy bear a child which I am old?
[49:36] And I meant to mention this. It's Sarah
[49:38] and Abraham at this point.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[49:42] &gt;&gt; let's just stop right there just for a
[49:44] second.
[49:47] At this point,
[49:50] he's the father of nations.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; And he's got one son, Ishmael,
[49:57] &gt;&gt; it's not the promised son,
[50:00] &gt;&gt; and it's not certainly not of nations,
[50:04] right?
[50:06] &gt;&gt; It's not what God has is has really
[50:09] called him to. He knew that it was
[50:11] supposed to come through Sarah.
[50:14] And Sarah said, "Let me help you out,
[50:16] God." Oh,
[50:18] &gt;&gt; that's good.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; I wish that I could take back all those
[50:23] times that I helped God out.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be awesome?
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; I'd be a whole lot further down the
[50:32] road.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; If I would stop helping God out and if I
[50:35] could take back the times that I did
[50:36] help God out,
[50:40] &gt;&gt; preach now,
[50:41] &gt;&gt; right? Yes, sir. Oh,
[50:45] the mighty John.
[50:47] Let me help you out, God.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; I got this.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, boy.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. To take those away.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; And to never do it again. Let's be
[51:02] honest,
[51:03] &gt;&gt; cuz every one of us here, the Lord
[51:06] Terries, is going to try and help him
[51:07] out again cuz we just
[51:10] we're hard-headed and we still got
[51:11] flesh.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Is anything too hard for the Lord?
[51:24] Back in church again.
[51:28] at the appointed time I will return unto
[51:30] thee according to the time of life and
[51:33] Sarah shall have a son. Uh
[51:39] that the one who doubted the one who
[51:42] questioned the one who shook on her
[51:45] faith in what God really told them or
[51:49] and and and told Sarah you're going to
[51:53] have this child and she laughed at him.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:56] And God looked past her ignorance
[51:59] &gt;&gt; because his will will be done.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Children of God
[52:14] can only
[52:16] fall into permissive will for so long.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying?
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's been times I've been in
[52:26] his permissive will.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; There's been too many times I've been in
[52:31] his permissive will.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; However,
[52:38] because I am a son of God, because you
[52:40] are sons and daughters of God
[52:43] and you're the bride of Christ,
[52:47] &gt;&gt; your final act will not be his
[52:50] permissive will.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; It will be his perfect will.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Let that soak in just a minute.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; There's plenty of people out there that
[53:02] are falling into his permissive will
[53:04] time and time and time again.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; And they'll end up in his permissive
[53:11] will.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; But we have real faith. We have
[53:15] something anchored and solid, something
[53:18] that that's going to hold us and keep
[53:20] us.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:22] And when all the dust settles and
[53:24] everything shakes out
[53:28] from our hearts,
[53:31] it's going to be yes, Lord.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; It's not my way, Lord. It's your way.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; It's not my will, Lord. It's your will.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; I don't care what it takes, Lord. Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; I want you to take control of me.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at Genesis 22 verses 1.
[54:08] I got a lot to cover, so we're going to
[54:09] have to
[54:14] verses one through. We're going to try.
[54:18] And it came to pass after the these
[54:20] things that God did did tempt Abraham.
[54:23] What?
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute.
[54:29] The devil is the tempter.
[54:33] Not according to this right here.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; God did tempt Abraham.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Why would God do that?
[54:45] Cuz we need
[54:48] faith at the end of the road.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[54:52] &gt;&gt; we need unshakable, unquestioning faith
[54:56] at the end of the road.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; That's why God will tempt us.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; He will shake us. He will question us.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:20] People don't just
[55:22] pick up a basketball and are able to
[55:25] play basketball
[55:28] or baseball or sewing or whatever
[55:32] cooking. Lord, please help us.
[55:36] They don't just go in a kitchen and just
[55:39] make this meal that's just fantastic.
[55:42] Takes practice. Right.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Takes years of practice.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Well, what makes you think it that we're
[55:49] just going to step into this faith?
[55:53] &gt;&gt; If God don't have us practice believing
[55:56] what God has for us,
[55:57] &gt;&gt; that's good.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; How are we just supposed to step into
[56:01] this and say, "Well, I'm here, God.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; I hear your call."
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[56:10] True.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's a rude awakening when God
[56:14] tempt us.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; It's hard.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; And some of those those things go back
[56:22] to that that wanting God's will more
[56:26] than we want our own way.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's so easy to pout on God.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; That's good. We all have that lip that
[56:38] can roll right on out.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; We just push that thing out there. You
[56:45] You said you were going to heal me and I
[56:47] had to wait three weeks.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; You said you'd provide my every need.
[56:54] And
[56:56] &gt;&gt; I had to go to the food stamp office.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Guess what? He did provide your need.
[57:06] Yes, he did.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; He did.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Just not the way you wanted,
[57:15] &gt;&gt; right? But we get this attitude against
[57:18] God saying, "Hey, this is the way it
[57:20] should be."
[57:28] &gt;&gt; It's truth.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; It is.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; But we have to practice that.
[57:34] We have to get into that mode where we
[57:36] struggle sometimes
[57:40] &gt;&gt; and we believe. We really believe. We're
[57:42] taking the word and we're taking it.
[57:43] We're eating it and we're believing
[57:44] saying, "God, you'll provide my every
[57:46] need."
[57:48] And I have to ask somebody for $10 for
[57:51] gas or whatever it might be.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; It's getting tight in here.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Some of us don't like it. I don't I
[58:03] don't like it. Yeah.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Humble thyself.
[58:08] Okay.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; God's going to heal me. Yeah. Go to the
[58:21] doctor.
[58:25] Right. There's all kinds of variation of
[58:27] this the same mindset, the same thing
[58:29] that we've had on God because we expect
[58:31] God to do things a certain way because
[58:34] we wanted the miraculous. We wanted the
[58:36] the the spiritual,
[58:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:42] &gt;&gt; We want to hear it from the pulpit and
[58:44] embrace it and and just take it.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Well, you got to embrace and take this
[58:49] part, too.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:01] And he said, "Take now thy son, thine
[59:04] only son." Wait a minute.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Didn't we say Ishmael was here?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; All those things that we helped with,
[59:16] &gt;&gt; he don't even recognize.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:21] Chalk that up to stupidity.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not even going to recognize that.
[59:28] That's good.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; And Abraham rose early in the morning,
[59:40] saddled his ass, and took two of his
[59:42] young men with him, and Isaac his son,
[59:44] and claved the wood, the burnt
[59:46] offerings, and rose up, and went unto
[59:48] the place of which God had told him. So
[59:51] Abram, Abraham is making preparation to
[59:54] do exactly what God said. We're walking.
[59:56] He's walking in the word.
[59:59] And every day
[1:00:02] Abraham has those scriptures.
[1:00:06] I'll make thy seed as the sands of the
[1:00:10] sea.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; He's got those. They're they're tucked
[1:00:13] away in his heart. He's got those
[1:00:16] promises
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; and he's waiting at any moment for God
[1:00:20] to intervene because he knows that's
[1:00:23] what the promise is.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:26] That's real faith.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; We are to be expecting God to intervene
[1:00:30] at any moment.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't waver.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Faith from God wanting his will doesn't
[1:00:38] shake from one side or the other. But
[1:00:40] but every step we're saying, "Okay, God,
[1:00:43] you're leading me this direction. I'm
[1:00:45] going to go this direction."
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; And at any moment, you could step on the
[1:00:50] scene and change this situation.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he says, "Yes, yes, I can."
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do next?
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says he didn't tell Syria,
[1:01:07] Sarah, his wife.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; No, he did
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; cuz he was afraid that she was going to
[1:01:12] knock him down.
[1:01:16] Hm.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; He got two servants and his son
[1:01:21] and his animal and the wood and he said,
[1:01:25] "We'll be back in a few days." "Where
[1:01:27] are you going?" Oh,
[1:01:32] it's a surprise.
[1:01:39] He didn't lie
[1:01:44] and he took off.
[1:01:46] And at first Abraham said, "Well,
[1:01:50] maybe if
[1:01:53] I get everything ready, God will stop
[1:01:56] me."
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; And then God didn't stop him.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; And then he said, "Well,
[1:02:09] maybe if we head down the road, we start
[1:02:10] out,
[1:02:12] then God will have me just turn around.
[1:02:17] He knew the promise.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Maybe you woke up with a head cold and
[1:02:25] and first thing in the morning you said,
[1:02:27] "Well, Lord, you're my healer. At any
[1:02:31] moment you could take it away
[1:02:34] at any time.
[1:02:37] I'm believing. I'm going to praise you
[1:02:38] for it."
[1:02:40] Ah, and you're doing exactly what the
[1:02:42] word says. Exactly what the word says.
[1:02:45] I'm going to praise you for it. I'm
[1:02:47] going to believe for it. By this
[1:02:49] afternoon, that head coat will be gone.
[1:02:54] Afternoon comes and goes.
[1:02:57] Well,
[1:03:01] I'll believe for it. I'm going to take
[1:03:03] some nightquil. I'm going to get a good
[1:03:05] night's sleep. Lord, is it okay if I
[1:03:07] take nightquil?
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; My face not shaking. I just I just need
[1:03:12] to get some sleep, Lord.
[1:03:17] You wake up in the morning and it's
[1:03:20] worse.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? This
[1:03:25] is this is in everything in our lives.
[1:03:26] We we we I wake up in the morning say,
[1:03:29] "Lord, come quickly."
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And I have to go through my whole day.
[1:03:36] This is what's expected of us. We had to
[1:03:38] go through our whole day expecting him
[1:03:42] to come in a twinkling in an eye,
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; What's What's the difference?
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; What's the difference between that and
[1:03:52] what Abraham had to do,
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; We are to be expecting. We're supposed
[1:03:56] to be anticipating his coming and living
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; like he can come any moment. Right.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; And we have to go put our work boots on.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; I wish we could skip that part.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Even so, come quickly, Lord.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; If that's what it takes to get you in
[1:04:21] that mindset of of even so, come
[1:04:23] quickly.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; We got to plant our potatoes, too.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[1:04:32] He's called us that.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Some of them crazy people that that
[1:04:37] believed that God was coming back in 77
[1:04:40] or what it was, went out and got loans
[1:04:42] and all that and and went into debt and
[1:04:45] they left the message because he didn't
[1:04:47] come the way that he
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; that that they thought he should come.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Right,
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; man. There's plenty of loonies out
[1:04:58] there.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about out there. I'm
[1:05:00] talking about in the message ranks.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Some of these people are crazy.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; But even so, come quickly. But Lord, I
[1:05:17] I'm going to have to save up for a car
[1:05:19] in case mine breaks down or whatever
[1:05:22] more.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; That's real faith.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; That's expecting the best.
[1:05:30] and planning for the worst.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Nobody likes that side of it.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; I don't like that side of it. I wish it
[1:05:39] was all gumb gumballs and lollipops and
[1:05:43] rainbows and whatever else,
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; but it's not. Reality is he's called us
[1:05:49] to a faith.
[1:05:51] Lord, I want your perfect will.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. And if it's your
[1:05:55] perfect will for me to go through this
[1:05:58] trial, this struggle, this low valley,
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; even so come quickly.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Circumstance does not change the bride's
[1:06:15] outcome.
[1:06:26] Then on the third day, day three,
[1:06:31] Abraham so showed him or God showed
[1:06:33] Abraham where he was supposed to go. It
[1:06:36] wasn't a quick trip. Three days he
[1:06:39] started heading in a direction.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; It sounds like life.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Just heading in a direction. Now, our
[1:06:49] goal is to get where God called us to
[1:06:51] be.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; And day by day,
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; moment by moment, we're progressing
[1:06:57] along. We have that faith that God is
[1:06:59] going to move for us. We have that faith
[1:07:01] that God is doing something in our
[1:07:02] lives. And we also have that faith
[1:07:05] knowing that he's called us to do
[1:07:07] something that's uncomfortable
[1:07:09] sometimes.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:07:13] Can you imagine in I don't know about
[1:07:15] you, but in with me in my heart when I
[1:07:19] know I have something that I have to do
[1:07:21] that I don't like.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, please help me. Lord, I I don't
[1:07:27] Lord, you know this is this is not what
[1:07:29] I had in mind.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, this is uncomfortable for me.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want to work with that
[1:07:40] person again.
[1:07:43] Lord, I know that you're molding me and
[1:07:45] making me and you're using that guy and
[1:07:48] I'm not supposed to ball up my fist.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Hey, you're never going to get anything
[1:08:02] else but brother John up here. I'm
[1:08:04] sorry. This is just me. I'm not trying
[1:08:06] to be nothing. I'm not trying to hide
[1:08:08] from from me. Unfortunately,
[1:08:11] you can see it.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Three days, Abraham.
[1:08:24] Oh, Lord, please help me. I don't know
[1:08:26] what I don't know what you're doing,
[1:08:27] Lord.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; There's those times and and Abraham felt
[1:08:32] like his prayers didn't even get up past
[1:08:34] the ceiling. Yeah.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; He'd lay there and he's asking, "God,
[1:08:40] please.
[1:08:43] I know what you promised. I know what
[1:08:47] you said. I know
[1:08:51] that I'm going to be the father of
[1:08:52] nations." And you said the seed would
[1:08:54] come through Sarah.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; And you said that it was going to be
[1:08:59] Isaac.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; And you've called me to go sacrifice
[1:09:03] him. I I I don't I don't understand.
[1:09:07] Yeah,
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; maybe I'm the only one who's ever had
[1:09:10] the I don't understand
[1:09:12] thoughts.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't get it.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; And it's human nature
[1:09:22] to want to understand what's going on.
[1:09:24] We want to be in control. If we
[1:09:26] understand it, we can control it a
[1:09:28] little better.
[1:09:33] Some of you have been praying for
[1:09:34] deliverance for years and years from a
[1:09:37] certain habit, a certain thing.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Let's just get down to where it is.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; We know in the word it's against his
[1:09:49] word the the the besetting sin that's
[1:09:52] hanging on us.
[1:09:58] We know it's against his word to have
[1:10:00] this attitude towards somebody or an
[1:10:03] attitude at all in a certain way.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; And we're walking along and we struggle
[1:10:12] with it and we say, "Lord, you said that
[1:10:15] you deliver me from this and I'm
[1:10:18] fighting it still."
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:25] It's against your word.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; It's not your will for me to be having
[1:10:31] this. Some of you it's it's it's doubt
[1:10:33] that you have the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Some of you it's things that you hide.
[1:10:45] Some of you it's things that are very
[1:10:47] apparent. An attitude.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's a habit.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; It's all these things. You know what
[1:10:56] your yours is. I know what mine is.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; And we know it's God's will that it's
[1:11:06] not supposed to be there.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; And we go day by day
[1:11:14] and we're under we're we're we're we're
[1:11:17] questioning and we don't understand.
[1:11:20] We've got these questions. God, why? Why
[1:11:24] am I here?
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; I know I can't serve you the right way
[1:11:29] with this guilt hanging on me.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; I told you it might go in a different
[1:11:37] direction. Let me tell you, this is a
[1:11:38] different direction.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; I know this isn't your perfect will. And
[1:11:45] I'm a son of God.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God.
[1:11:51] And yet I still have this thing.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; That's a hard way to be. It's a hard way
[1:12:00] to live.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Guilt is an awful thing. And for a
[1:12:07] Christian
[1:12:09] that's falling short of the glory of
[1:12:11] God,
[1:12:12] that guilt is very prevalent.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; And it should be.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; It should bother you. Amen.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; That's that Holy Ghost saying, "Hey,
[1:12:21] you're better than this."
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; It's that Holy Ghost saying, "Hey,
[1:12:31] you're better than this.
[1:12:35] You mean the Holy Ghost would tempt us?"
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; And God did tempt Abraham.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:47] He didn't say he was wasn't going to
[1:12:49] deliver him. Now, Abraham was in the
[1:12:51] midst of the trial. He didn't know the
[1:12:52] end. We're we we have the luxury of
[1:12:54] knowing the end of Abraham's story.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. We have
[1:13:01] the luxury of knowing
[1:13:04] the end of your story.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; It's rapture, right?
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; It's that perfect word living in us.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; But in the middle of it, what does it
[1:13:12] feel like? It's so heavy. I don't
[1:13:14] understand God. Right?
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Why can't I overcome this?
[1:13:23] God, why are you tempting me this way?
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; This ain't in my notes.
[1:13:37] And we know what his perfect will is
[1:13:39] this in this situation. Just like
[1:13:41] Abraham knew what his the perfect will
[1:13:43] was in his situation.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; But it don't always make it easy.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Guilt don't go away because you know
[1:13:54] you're not supposed to
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; and that you will overcome it.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to have faith that you
[1:14:00] will.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; That's that's right.
[1:14:05] But it don't make it easier to deal
[1:14:06] with.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Not as a Christian.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Three days journey. He's still waiting.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Some of you it's been 10 years journey.
[1:14:19] You're still waiting.
[1:14:25] That's tight.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:31] Then on the third day, Abraham lifted up
[1:14:33] his eyes and saw the place a far off.
[1:14:38] Oh,
[1:14:40] it was like I was telling my son Ben on
[1:14:43] the way over here. I said, "This is the
[1:14:44] worst part of the service."
[1:14:48] I get up here and I I I've been
[1:14:50] preaching long enough and I've done it
[1:14:51] enough that I know that if I submit and
[1:14:53] get out of the way, then he'll take
[1:14:55] over. This part's easy right now. Now
[1:14:59] the pre and the post not so fun.
[1:15:04] The pre you're thinking, "Oh, am I
[1:15:06] really finding the mind of God?" And
[1:15:09] then afterwards like, "Boy, you really
[1:15:10] miss God.
[1:15:12] It's miserable."
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; So Abraham was preparing to take off and
[1:15:20] he knew that he was going to have to
[1:15:21] face Sarah and have have to ask her some
[1:15:23] questions, maybe skirt around a few
[1:15:25] questions. And then when he saw that a
[1:15:28] far off, he knew, "Oh, it's coming.
[1:15:32] It's coming."
[1:15:38] And Abraham said unto his young men,
[1:15:40] "Abide here with the ass, and I will and
[1:15:44] I and the lad will go yonder and worship
[1:15:47] and come again to you."
[1:15:51] Abra Abraham was tempted of God.
[1:15:55] Abraham understood the promise.
[1:15:58] He's still waiting for God to intervene
[1:16:00] at this moment.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Still waiting for God to intervene.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; But he knew the promise and he quoted
[1:16:11] the promise and he stayed with the
[1:16:13] promise. I and the lad will return.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; I don't know how it's going to happen. I
[1:16:19] don't know when God's going to step in
[1:16:21] here, but I know what the promise is.
[1:16:23] Right,
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; brother and sister. Are you glad you
[1:16:25] know what the promise is?
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Thank God. I'd go crazy if I didn't know
[1:16:31] the promise.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be able to make it if I
[1:16:35] didn't know what the promise is.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; He kept quoting the promise. His
[1:16:42] testimony
[1:16:44] was positive.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Should we stop there for just a minute?
[1:16:52] His brother Joel Forny says, "Wowy, wowy
[1:16:56] woo." We get those wowsy wowsy woo
[1:16:59] moments. Poor me.
[1:17:02] I can't believe I'm going through this.
[1:17:05] God, why are you doing this to me?
[1:17:09] God, you said I was an overcomer. I'm
[1:17:11] not an overcomer because I'm still
[1:17:13] dealing. And a testimony and the
[1:17:15] confession is not what it should be.
[1:17:21] If you're in the midst of that besetting
[1:17:23] sin, if you're in the midst of that
[1:17:25] problem, in that situation,
[1:17:28] God's still your deliverer.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; He's still the one who made the promise,
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; That doesn't change.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Circumstance doesn't change. Jonah and
[1:17:38] the whale, right? Surrounded by b whale
[1:17:40] belly.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; His circumstance didn't dictate the
[1:17:45] outcome.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Right. Sure did.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The promise was he was going to
[1:17:50] preach in Nineveh.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; He didn't like it. He didn't want to do
[1:17:54] it.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; He ran from it. God said, "Guess what?
[1:17:59] You're going through a pipe, old boy, or
[1:18:01] a fish in this circumstance.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Not going to be fun.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Circumstance didn't change the outcome.
[1:18:18] Your circumstance, brothers and sisters,
[1:18:20] will not will not change your outcome.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Amen.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; His will is what determines
[1:18:28] where we end up.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Not our circumstance.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; We're sons and daughters of God.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Not our issues, not our our attitudes,
[1:18:41] but his will will determine our outcome.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:48] Yes, sir.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; My
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; and Abraham took the the wood of the
[1:18:58] burnt offering and laid it upon his
[1:18:59] Isaac his son. And he took the fire in
[1:19:02] his hand and a knife. And they went both
[1:19:06] of of them together.
[1:19:09] And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father,
[1:19:11] and said, "My father." And he said,
[1:19:13] "Here am I, my son." And he said,
[1:19:15] "Behold the fire and the wood, but where
[1:19:17] is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Where's the lamb for the burnt offering?
[1:19:28] Lord, you said you were my deliverer.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; You said you were my healer.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; You said I was an overcomer.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Where's the lamb?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Where's the sacrifice? By your stripes,
[1:19:44] I am healed.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; I can't heal you anymore. He can't heal
[1:19:49] you anymore than he did on the cross.
[1:19:52] There's a promise.
[1:19:54] The work was performed. It's already
[1:19:56] done.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Where's my burnt offering, Lord?
[1:20:10] And Abraham said, "My son, God will
[1:20:12] provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[1:20:13] offering." So they both for So they went
[1:20:18] both of them together right up on the
[1:20:21] hill. Now Isaac was scratching his head
[1:20:23] too,
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; still questioning.
[1:20:34] And they came to the place where God had
[1:20:36] told him of. And Abraham built an altar
[1:20:39] there. And he laid the wood in order,
[1:20:40] and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on
[1:20:42] the altar upon the wood.
[1:20:45] And Abraham stretched forth his hand and
[1:20:48] took the knife to slay his son.
[1:20:52] Following through,
[1:20:54] following through. Yeah.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; God's not going to act ask us to
[1:20:59] sacrifice our son,
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; but he might ask us to sacrifice our
[1:21:05] pride.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; It's hard to say God's a healer.
[1:21:13] God's a healer. God's a healer.
[1:21:17] God's a healer.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to the doctor. God's a healer.
[1:21:22] Right.
[1:21:30] It's his word.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; It's his word.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Abraham knew what he was promised.
[1:21:37] Brothers and sisters, we get so much
[1:21:39] going on and we've got so much of life
[1:21:41] happening.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Life life isn't chaotic anymore. It just
[1:21:46] happens.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; I'm past the chaos. I'm used to the
[1:21:50] chaos.
[1:21:53] Maybe I'm the only one, but I'm used to
[1:21:55] the chaos.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; It just happens
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; and we have to deal with it.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; And God expects us and not only does he
[1:22:09] expect us to to deal with it, but he
[1:22:11] expects us to do it well.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:19] I have I've I've I've asked all my kids.
[1:22:23] This is one of my rules growing up in my
[1:22:27] house. They don't like it when I preach.
[1:22:29] It's nothing bad. Don't worry, boys.
[1:22:33] You need to work in the in the food
[1:22:37] service or
[1:22:39] um what's the other thing? Retail.
[1:22:43] So, you know how to treat
[1:22:46] somebody
[1:22:48] when you order food and they get it
[1:22:50] wrong.
[1:22:52] Boy, that's hard.
[1:22:59] Boy, that's hard to do. But if you ever
[1:23:02] been on the other side of it and guess
[1:23:04] what? You know how to treat somebody.
[1:23:08] I can tell the ones that worked in
[1:23:09] retail, they're all no joke
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; cuz we've all had those customers
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; and they're always right.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you feel like they're just
[1:23:22] right for knocking out.
[1:23:30] But we need to be able to treat people
[1:23:32] with kindness in spite of the problems
[1:23:36] that we have. And it's frustrating
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; and it's hard.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; But we need to learn how to deal with
[1:23:52] stuff.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, we do.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; We need to learn how to treat people
[1:23:56] that aren't Christians.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Because just because they're not
[1:23:59] treating you like a Christian would
[1:24:00] treat you doesn't mean that you
[1:24:02] shouldn't treat them like a Christian
[1:24:04] should treat them.
[1:24:06] Amen.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; You might be the only Jesus they see
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; all day long.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Have you seen some of them characters
[1:24:20] working in that fast food joint? They
[1:24:22] ain't seen G Jesus and a lot of them,
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; You might be the only ones.
[1:24:35] That was free. That wasn't in my notes
[1:24:36] either.
[1:24:42] And the angel of the Lord called unto
[1:24:43] him out of heaven and said,"Abraham,
[1:24:45] Abraham." And he said, "Here am I." Ah.
[1:24:52] And he said, "Lay not thine hand upon
[1:24:54] thy lad, neither do thou anything unto
[1:24:56] him. For now I know that thou fearst
[1:24:59] God." Fearst God.
[1:25:02] How fierest God.
[1:25:04] I'm going to keep believing and I'm
[1:25:06] going to keep trusting.
[1:25:08] If it's it's so important
[1:25:12] that we keep the mindset
[1:25:17] God's knows what's best for me.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; God knows what's best for me.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; But I'm lonely. God knows what's best
[1:25:27] for me.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] H.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; I've been sick for this long. God knows
[1:25:35] what's best for me.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; I've dealt with this besetting sin. I'm
[1:25:40] an overcomer. It's going to happen. The
[1:25:42] promise is there.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; God knows what's best for me.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that you should just
[1:25:49] embrace that besetting sense of, "Oh,
[1:25:51] God's using it. Oh, I No.
[1:25:55] No.
[1:25:57] Quite the opposite. You push that thing
[1:25:59] away and you stomp it and you kick it
[1:26:01] and you tell it, "I will not. This is
[1:26:05] not me.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; This is not me."
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not catering to this.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Even so, come quickly. Yes, Lord.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; You ever been in such a place in your
[1:26:22] life and you've been fighting with
[1:26:23] something for so long and it seems like
[1:26:26] and your prayers turn from even so come
[1:26:29] quickly to Lord, can you wait till I
[1:26:31] overcome this?
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying?
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; There won't be a lot of people that
[1:26:39] admit that, Brother Freddy. But I've
[1:26:42] been in that place where I've said, "Oh
[1:26:44] Lord, you're going to have to hold on a
[1:26:46] couple days till I overcome this cuz I
[1:26:49] know this ain't right."
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; That's where we are, brothers and
[1:27:03] sisters. It it it's not supposed to
[1:27:05] shake us. It's not going to shake us.
[1:27:07] We're sons and daughters of God.
[1:27:10] He knows what's best for us.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; We are overcomers.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; We're not always overcomers on our time
[1:27:17] because our strength is nothing. We
[1:27:19] can't do it on our own.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; And maybe that's the very point that
[1:27:23] he's trying to get across to you.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That might be the whole reason why
[1:27:29] you're struggling with this thing,
[1:27:33] whatever it might be,
[1:27:36] because he wants you to settle in and
[1:27:38] know that you are nothing
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; without him.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; You can't overcome anything without him.
[1:27:48] And maybe he wants you to settle in and
[1:27:50] say, "God, I give up."
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; I'm done.
[1:27:55] Yes, sir.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; I've had a demon cast out of me by a
[1:28:02] look
[1:28:05] of a man of God cuz I was at that point.
[1:28:11] I was praying about something and
[1:28:14] struggled and struggled and struggled.
[1:28:19] And this brother just looked at me.
[1:28:22] He was under the anointing. He was in a
[1:28:24] place. He didn't even pray for me. He
[1:28:26] didn't lay his hands on me.
[1:28:32] And I knew at that very moment that I
[1:28:34] was delivered.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; How's that possible?
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; I finally said, "God, I've been trying
[1:28:41] for years. I can't do it.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Here's a man of God. Here's an
[1:28:45] opportunity. I I'm giving it to you."
[1:28:48] Amazing.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; We've got to get to the place, brothers
[1:28:56] and sisters, where we realize
[1:29:00] that it's God and only God.
[1:29:04] All he wants us to do is believe.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; See the promise and walk towards it.
[1:29:12] Keep going towards it. Keep going
[1:29:14] towards it. Keep moving towards it. But
[1:29:17] I got this circumstance don't matter.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says in Jehovah Gyra. Now
[1:29:27] what if Abraham says now wait
[1:29:31] was that vision true? Let me study now.
[1:29:34] Was that vision true?
[1:29:37] Brother Ram saying, is Abraham going to
[1:29:41] question his experience with God?
[1:29:43] Something that's settled.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's where the devil wants to
[1:29:47] get you.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Now, God said for me to take my boy and
[1:29:54] kill him. Now, how am I ever going to
[1:29:59] to be the father of nations? And that's
[1:30:01] my seed.
[1:30:03] And that's a promise seed. Now, how am I
[1:30:07] ever going to be the father of nations
[1:30:08] when God is destroying the only hope I
[1:30:11] have? Yeah.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Destroying the only hope that I have.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Is that the hope? Only hope that I have.
[1:30:21] No,
[1:30:23] I still have I still got his word. He
[1:30:27] promised me back there that he'd do it.
[1:30:30] And through Isaac, all the world would
[1:30:32] would be blessed. Through Isaac, all the
[1:30:35] world would be blessed.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Through you, all the world will be
[1:30:40] blessed. The bride is what's holding
[1:30:42] back
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; those demons.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; So he said, listen to Abraham now. I
[1:30:53] received him as one from the dead.
[1:30:56] I'm persuaded that God is able to raise
[1:30:59] him up from the dead. Oh my, even with a
[1:31:01] a horse throat, I feel religious. So
[1:31:04] brother Brandham's
[1:31:06] got a horse throat. If I receive
[1:31:09] received him as one from the dead, what?
[1:31:15] Guess what?
[1:31:17] The garden made us dead.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; And we've received him
[1:31:26] as one from the dead.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; We've received his promise.
[1:31:32] Don't matter the circumstance. Don't
[1:31:33] matter how how are we going to make this
[1:31:35] happen? We're not.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; We're not.
[1:31:41] God's going to make it happen.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; The seed in his own body was dead at 100
[1:31:47] years old. The deadness of Sarah's womb,
[1:31:49] they were both sterile to being with.
[1:31:52] And then God performed a miracle and put
[1:31:54] his germ of life in there. He received
[1:31:56] him from the dead as one being dead.
[1:31:59] Then God's able to raise him up from the
[1:32:01] dead. Perfect type of the Lord Jesus
[1:32:03] Christ. Hallelujah. Oh my. If that
[1:32:05] wouldn't make a Presbyterian shout.
[1:32:07] Think of that.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; So here he is. That's what I That's what
[1:32:10] I'm We're building our experience
[1:32:12] through our trials. And God's tempting
[1:32:14] us. We're building these experiences.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; All these trials. Look, I'm going
[1:32:22] through some hard stuff.
[1:32:24] Harder than I've ever had to go through.
[1:32:28] And as a Christian, you could all say
[1:32:30] the same thing.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Going through some hard stuff, and it's
[1:32:34] harder now than it ever has been.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; But you know what the difference is?
[1:32:40] I'm not near as worried as I used to be
[1:32:43] about it.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not near as concerned about how the
[1:32:50] outcome's going to be as I used to be.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:32:55] Because God tempted me. Amen.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; And he followed through with his word.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; And after every victory,
[1:33:03] my faith got bigger.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; After every victory, I come back and
[1:33:09] said, "Well, God, you did this for me.
[1:33:12] Is it too hard for God?"
[1:33:17] My
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Abraham staggered not at the promises of
[1:33:24] God through unbelief, but was strong,
[1:33:28] giving praise to his name.
[1:33:36] I'm going to switch gears a little bit
[1:33:38] and and just
[1:33:41] look at Philippians 2.
[1:33:48] Verse one.
[1:33:52] Now I got to make it fast.
[1:34:01] If there be therefore any consolation in
[1:34:03] Christ, if any comfort of love, any if
[1:34:07] any fellowship of the spirit, if any
[1:34:10] bowels of mercy,
[1:34:12] fulfill ye my joy, that ye may be
[1:34:15] like-minded, having the same love, being
[1:34:19] of one accord, one mind.
[1:34:24] So what's God's mind for you?
[1:34:31] What is if if we're called to have the
[1:34:33] same mind of Christ,
[1:34:36] what is his goal? What is his purpose?
[1:34:40] What is his whole
[1:34:44] what is he waiting for us to get his
[1:34:47] mind? And we know that the prophet said
[1:34:52] he's under greater anticipation to call
[1:34:54] us home than we are
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; to go home.
[1:35:02] That's his mindset,
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; And he's called us to have that mindset.
[1:35:08] We're going home.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Well, brother John, what? We can't go
[1:35:13] with all these circumstances. No, we're
[1:35:15] going home.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how
[1:35:24] we get there.
[1:35:28] what we have to overcome to get there.
[1:35:31] We're going to get there.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; That's that's God's mindset,
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; That's what he sees. Does he see me fall
[1:35:40] short? Yes.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Does he see you fall short?
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Has he thrown you out?
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, forget it.
[1:35:55] That guy, I'm telling you,
[1:36:00] I have worked on him and worked on him
[1:36:03] and worked on him.
[1:36:09] You know, we'll just start over with
[1:36:10] somebody else.
[1:36:12] No,
[1:36:14] he has that image in his mind that he
[1:36:17] had of you before the foundation of the
[1:36:19] world.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm going to fill out that per
[1:36:22] that that picture album and you're going
[1:36:24] to be there
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; in spite of you."
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Watch how
[1:36:32] I could sing, "My God is an awesome
[1:36:35] God." Why?
[1:36:37] Because I know
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; that he's put up with me. How awesome is
[1:36:41] that?
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; My wife and kids don't even want to do
[1:36:46] that sometimes.
[1:36:50] But he keeps putting up with me.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; And we've all had those moments where
[1:36:58] we're saying, "God,
[1:37:01] why do you put up with me?
[1:37:21] I'm just going to take this and just
[1:37:23] because it's encouraging.
[1:37:26] I just want to I want to take this
[1:37:29] little I don't this is the way the
[1:37:31] Lord's leading me. So, we're going to I
[1:37:33] put it in here and I didn't understand
[1:37:34] why, but we're just going to do it.
[1:37:38] It's a
[1:37:41] I perceive that thou art a prophet. It's
[1:37:44] 53.
[1:37:46] Brother Brown
[1:37:49] says, "And coming down through the
[1:37:50] people." Now, now you all heard this
[1:37:52] before. I'm not telling you anything
[1:37:54] new, but I I want to stir it up, make
[1:37:57] you understand. Coming down through the
[1:37:59] people. Now, down in the south, they
[1:38:00] have the the Jim Crow law. That is
[1:38:03] colored and white can't mix together. So
[1:38:05] here come a a a colored girl about 17 18
[1:38:08] years old and oh she was in her this her
[1:38:13] her eyes was white with cataract as my
[1:38:15] shirt and she was coming pressing
[1:38:16] through the crowds somebody please help
[1:38:18] me daddy and I thought why don't some of
[1:38:21] these people help that poor girl so I
[1:38:24] thought while he wasn't looking
[1:38:28] I'd move along a little so I got over
[1:38:30] there and I kept getting right in her
[1:38:32] way and watching ing these men to come.
[1:38:36] And she came right up and I stood like
[1:38:38] that and she bumped into me. She
[1:38:41] her hands tugged me. She said, "Excuse
[1:38:43] me, sir. Excuse me." Said, "Daddy."
[1:38:48] I thought I said, "What are you looking
[1:38:50] for?" She said, "Sir, I've lost my
[1:38:53] daddy. I'm blind." She said, "I can't
[1:38:56] find him. I don't know what to do."
[1:38:58] Said, "Nobody will help me." Will you
[1:39:01] help me, kind sir?
[1:39:04] H
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; will you help me con sir?
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; So this is a a black girl
[1:39:11] and it was okay back then. It wasn't
[1:39:16] that's what black folks want to be
[1:39:18] called was colored. So don't get all
[1:39:20] crazy with that. That's what they maybe
[1:39:22] they didn't want to but that's what they
[1:39:24] were called.
[1:39:29] She's in a group of white people,
[1:39:33] blind, and lost her only way home, her
[1:39:37] daddy.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Tough circumstances.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:54] And I said, "Well,
[1:39:56] I don't see no more color people around
[1:39:58] here." Said, "Where are you from?" She
[1:40:00] said, "Memphis."
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; So, he's bringing forth. He said, "Look,
[1:40:05] you're in a you're in a dangerous spot
[1:40:07] right now. You're a black girl in a
[1:40:09] white crowd. This is not a nice place.
[1:40:13] Yeah,
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; cuz cuz a lot of them racist claim
[1:40:16] Christianity,
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; And shame on them,
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; back then and now. Let's go ahead and
[1:40:23] say it.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; And I looked and there was a bunch of
[1:40:28] charter buses sitting there and I knowed
[1:40:30] one of them was from Memphis. And that's
[1:40:32] how I said, "What are you doing over
[1:40:34] here?" She said, "I listening to the
[1:40:37] radio this morning." She said, "I heard
[1:40:39] about all those deaf and dumb people
[1:40:42] they had up there that was deaf and dumb
[1:40:44] last night speaking on the radio." And I
[1:40:47] said,
[1:40:48] "And you're blind?"
[1:40:51] See? I said, "What'd you come over here
[1:40:53] for?" She said, "I come to see the
[1:40:56] healer." I said, "The what?" She said,
[1:40:58] "The healer." And I said, "You don't
[1:41:01] believe that, do you?"
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Hm. Sounds like she's tempting.
[1:41:07] You're getting tempted. The prophet is
[1:41:09] tempting this girl.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; This is God called man tempting this
[1:41:14] girl.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; You don't believe that?
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; H Yeah.
[1:41:29] He says, "Now that looked like a
[1:41:31] hypocrite, too, taking advantage of a
[1:41:33] blind woman." See, but I wanted to see
[1:41:35] whether she really believed it.
[1:41:41] Do you believe that's the truth? She
[1:41:43] said, "Yes, sir." And I I began to feel
[1:41:46] it and she said, "Yes, sir. I believe
[1:41:48] it." And I said, "Why don't you believe
[1:41:51] that God would do something like that?
[1:41:52] As far advanced as med medical science
[1:41:55] is
[1:41:58] h science can't do nothing for you, why
[1:42:00] would you believe something supernatural
[1:42:02] would?
[1:42:04] Yeah.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; H.
[1:42:08] She said, "Sir,"
[1:42:10] and said, "When I was a little girl, I
[1:42:12] got cataracts on my eyes. The doctor
[1:42:14] told me when they got ripe, I don't know
[1:42:17] what that means, but when it got ripe,
[1:42:19] they'd take them off."
[1:42:21] And said, "Now they're ripe." And said,
[1:42:24] "They say if they take them out, they
[1:42:27] pull the optical nerves right out of my
[1:42:28] eyes." Said, "I can't see." And the only
[1:42:32] hope I got is to get in
[1:42:37] there.
[1:42:41] And this is the man last the this is the
[1:42:45] man's last night here. And they tell me
[1:42:47] I can't even get near the building. I've
[1:42:50] lost my daddy. I don't know what to do.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; I don't know what to do.
[1:43:00] I've had those moments.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Do you believe if you'd get
[1:43:09] in there, you'd be healed?" She said,
[1:43:12] "Well, I heard of a man on the radio
[1:43:14] this morning from up at Connect Ket,
[1:43:18] Missouri. Had been blind for 10 years
[1:43:20] and he received his sight." So said,
[1:43:24] "Well, couldn't I be healed too?"
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can't you overcome, too?
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Can't you be healed, too?
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Can't God take care of your problems,
[1:43:36] too?
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; How many's had something miraculous
[1:43:40] happen? Raise your hands. Get them up
[1:43:42] there.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Look around.
[1:43:47] Whatever your situation is, if he did it
[1:43:50] for brother Harry, can he do it for me?
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; If he did it for brother Rob,
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; can he do it for me? Amen.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we got to stop looking within
[1:44:06] ourselves
[1:44:09] and say, "I'm a son of do son or
[1:44:11] daughter of God."
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; And I have just as much right to your
[1:44:18] healing, your deliverance, your
[1:44:21] overcoming
[1:44:23] as anybody else here.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Sure. His
[1:44:28] word is not a respector of persons.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; I said, "Do you believe that?" She said,
[1:44:37] "Sir,
[1:44:39] I'll tell you what I'll do.
[1:44:44] If you'll just get me into where that
[1:44:46] man's at, I'll be able to find my daddy
[1:44:49] after that."
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; I'll be able to find my daddy.
[1:44:58] She had a tiepole. She had something to
[1:45:01] anchor her.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Now, we know it wasn't brother Brandham.
[1:45:05] It was Jesus Christ. But he was a
[1:45:07] channel.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; She held on to that.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; All these problems are going to go away
[1:45:19] if I can just get to that place.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; I'll find my own daddy. I'll get my own
[1:45:26] way home.
[1:45:35] I felt my heart drop right away from
[1:45:37] from me. I thought, poor old blind
[1:45:39] thing. I said, "Look, lady, do you mean
[1:45:42] that?"
[1:45:45] Still tempting her.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Still tempting her. Do you mean that?
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; She said, "Yes."
[1:45:54] Oh, I said,
[1:45:57] "Maybe I'm the one you're supposed to
[1:45:59] see."
[1:46:00] And she grabbed me up like that. She
[1:46:03] said, "Is you the healer?"
[1:46:07] And I said, "No, ma'am." I said, "I'm
[1:46:10] Brother Brandham. Jesus is the healer."
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; And she grabbed me. She said, "Oh,
[1:46:16] Brother Brandham,
[1:46:19] have mercy on me. Have mercy on me." And
[1:46:22] I thought of poor old blind Fanny
[1:46:27] Crosby.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Fanny Crosby never did get her sight.
[1:46:35] Never did.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; She never did.
[1:46:45] And I'm I'm going for memory, but if
[1:46:47] memory serves her, right, Brother Random
[1:46:49] said that if she would have got her
[1:46:50] healing, she wouldn't have been able to
[1:46:51] write those songs that she wrote.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Well, God's a healer. Absolutely.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; But as a son and daughter of God, he
[1:47:02] heals
[1:47:04] within the bounds of his will.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Well, you're casting a death. No, she
[1:47:13] never did quit praying for healing.
[1:47:16] Brother Brand doesn't say that,
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; But she kept believing.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; And that's what he's called us to do, to
[1:47:27] keep believing, to keep having that
[1:47:29] faith that he's called us to as sons and
[1:47:32] daughters of God. He's called us to
[1:47:33] that. Amen.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; He didn't call us just to believe
[1:47:37] because of the results because we don't
[1:47:39] like the results sometimes.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't mean he's not God. And it
[1:47:44] doesn't mean that his will hasn't been
[1:47:45] done.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; General orders
[1:47:53] by his stripes I am healed.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; You are an overcomer.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; You are more than a conqueror. All these
[1:48:00] things and we hold on to those things.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:05] and we'll know
[1:48:08] when God says
[1:48:11] that's my will and then we won't have to
[1:48:13] ask anymore.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; But until that's settled in your heart,
[1:48:19] just like that faith is settled in your
[1:48:22] heart, you keep believing for his
[1:48:24] promises. Right.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; And I looked and I thought
[1:48:36] her only hope, Christ.
[1:48:39] I said, "Now, I don't want to be
[1:48:41] recognized in the crowd. Lady, you bow
[1:48:44] your head and we'll have a word of
[1:48:45] prayer." Said, "First, I want to hold
[1:48:47] your hand while I'm praying." I couldn't
[1:48:49] get her hand off my coat. She wasn't
[1:48:52] going to let me go.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Pass me not, oh gentle savior.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; I will wrestle with you.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; I will hold on to you, God.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not letting go.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not stopping. I'm going to keep
[1:49:12] believing. You're my deliverer. You're
[1:49:14] my my overcomer. You're my healer.
[1:49:22] And I said, "Now let me have your hand."
[1:49:24] She said, "Don't pass me." And I took
[1:49:27] hold of her hand and pulled it off and
[1:49:29] held her hand. And while I was praying,
[1:49:30] now you can mark this is fanaticism if
[1:49:33] you want to. That would be between you
[1:49:36] and God. See, I could only tell the
[1:49:38] truth. Something happened. I knew the
[1:49:41] woman was healed. I was waiting for the
[1:49:43] shrinkage of that cataract.
[1:49:45] I said, "Now keep your lids closed over
[1:49:48] your eyes." I said, "Now you raise your
[1:49:51] head just about to where you think my
[1:49:53] voice is coming and I'll tell you what
[1:49:56] to do." She said, "Yes, sir." Said
[1:49:59] something cold went over me. I said,
[1:50:02] "Just raise your head." And I said, "Now
[1:50:04] open your eyes, for thus saith the Holy
[1:50:06] Spirit, you've received your sight." And
[1:50:09] she opened her eyes and she said, "Is
[1:50:12] that light?" And I said, "Yes." She
[1:50:15] said, "Is them black dots there? Is that
[1:50:18] people?"
[1:50:20] Her eyesight was not clear.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; It wasn't It wasn't all the way there.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; This is another point where God is
[1:50:36] tempting this girl.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. How many times did brother Random
[1:50:41] say,
[1:50:43] "Go confessing. Go believing."
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Don't matter what your symptoms are, you
[1:50:49] keep confessing your healing.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Don't matter what your your your your uh
[1:50:58] besetting sin is. You keep confessing
[1:51:00] your healing.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; You keep going. Keep marching towards
[1:51:04] that thing.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Don't settle for it. Well, I can see
[1:51:11] white lights and shapes of people.
[1:51:13] That's good enough.
[1:51:22] Oh Lord,
[1:51:24] she says, "Oh Lord, I who was once blind
[1:51:28] can now see." She let out a big scream.
[1:51:31] And then they've been some people
[1:51:33] standing there and watching and here
[1:51:35] they come. My you talk about and I
[1:51:38] happened to look now he's trying to get
[1:51:39] out of a meeting and he's supposed to
[1:51:41] meet these brothers that are supposed to
[1:51:43] escort him to a car and he snuck out a
[1:51:45] back door but there was this mass of
[1:51:47] people he couldn't get through and this
[1:51:49] is when he ran into this just in case
[1:51:51] you
[1:51:53] uh and I happened to look and there was
[1:51:55] an old man standing there with a cane an
[1:51:57] old club in his hand his leg was twisted
[1:51:59] sideways said brother Brandham I know
[1:52:02] you. He said, "I've been standing in the
[1:52:03] rain for eight or 10 days here."
[1:52:07] Eight or 10 days in the rain. Why?
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; God was tempting him.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:25] Said, "You wouldn't pass me, would you,
[1:52:26] Brother Brandon?" Said, "I got a bunch
[1:52:28] of kitties at home." Said, "They need
[1:52:29] me." said, "A woman going to run over me
[1:52:32] and I'm twisted my leg like this." I
[1:52:34] said, "Do you believe?" He said, "With
[1:52:36] all my heart
[1:52:38] and I said of in the name of the Lord
[1:52:41] Jesus, give me your cane."
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; It didn't say his foot straightened out
[1:52:46] first.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; It didn't say he was healed and jumped
[1:52:51] around and handed him the cane.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "Give me that cane."
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; I know. Aa Allen used to have an anvil
[1:53:01] on the platform,
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; And what would he do? I need healing for
[1:53:07] my eyes. Give me your glasses.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; He set them on the anvil and crush them
[1:53:12] with a hammer.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Ain't no turning back.
[1:53:17] Ain't no turning back.
[1:53:28] And the Lord who is my sovereign judge
[1:53:30] when that man in the act of faith handed
[1:53:33] his cane his leg come straight and he
[1:53:35] jumped into the air and screamed to the
[1:53:37] top of his voice.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; What are you in need of?
[1:53:46] How has God been tempting you? Where are
[1:53:49] you at in your walk?
[1:53:55] Are you questioning?
[1:53:57] Do you not understand? You wouldn't be
[1:53:59] the only one.
[1:54:03] This message, have you read some stuff
[1:54:05] online
[1:54:09] and it's in your mind?
[1:54:18] Sometimes God opens portals
[1:54:22] to hell to get your attention.
[1:54:25] What are you made of?
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Where are you at in your experience?
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; He wants all your hope hope destroyed.
[1:54:42] We don't need hope in the last days.
[1:54:46] It starts with hope. A lot of times, a
[1:54:47] lot of things start with hope, don't get
[1:54:49] me wrong,
[1:54:51] but hope is shaky.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; We have to be established in faith,
[1:54:57] brothers. Come.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:05] Where's your walk?
[1:55:11] It's time to self-examine. Say, "Brother
[1:55:14] John, I I believe
[1:55:17] I believe. But man, I'm really
[1:55:19] struggling.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; I've been in a circumstance for so long.
[1:55:25] I've dealt with a besetting sin for so
[1:55:27] long.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; I've dealt with this struggle or that
[1:55:32] struggle.
[1:55:40] Does your circumstance change who God
[1:55:43] is?
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:55:47] Does your problem change who God is?
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:55:56] Be sure that your call is sure.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you're going through,
[1:56:02] brothers and sisters. Stand with me if
[1:56:04] you would.
[1:56:11] I don't care how bad that you feel
[1:56:14] tempted. Sometimes that tempted
[1:56:16] temptation is of God.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; He's wanting to make sure
[1:56:24] that you know that you know. And the and
[1:56:26] the closer we get to home,
[1:56:30] the more important it is
[1:56:33] that we're sure.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; So things are going to get tighter.
[1:56:38] Things are going to get harder.
[1:56:41] We're not going to have this this
[1:56:44] instant success, if I could put it that
[1:56:47] way.
[1:56:48] This get-richqu
[1:56:50] scheme that that the devil's trying to
[1:56:53] feed people.
[1:56:57] He's trying to to to smooth over this
[1:57:00] this well, that's good enough. Nobody
[1:57:02] else is living like that. Nobody's
[1:57:05] still, you know, even the message
[1:57:08] churches, they're they're bickering.
[1:57:10] Some of them are bickering back and
[1:57:11] forth and we've got those that that
[1:57:14] believe in emotion and and those that
[1:57:16] believe that you have emotion. You're
[1:57:18] Let me tell you something.
[1:57:22] I've never seen
[1:57:24] nor has brother Harry or anybody else.
[1:57:27] Nobody's ever seen emotion heal the
[1:57:30] sick.
[1:57:32] Nope.
[1:57:34] So we shouldn't get emotional. No. I
[1:57:36] said emotion doesn't heal the sick.
[1:57:38] Emotion doesn't deliver. But I tell you
[1:57:41] what, if you get delivered, you're gonna
[1:57:43] have some emotion.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; If you get if you get healed, you're
[1:57:51] going to have some emotion.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; That's where it comes from. That's where
[1:57:54] the balance is, brothers and sisters.
[1:57:55] We're not focusing on one side or the
[1:57:57] other. We know that they're both united
[1:58:00] in the fact that he's my deliverer, and
[1:58:03] I'm happy about it.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I and and I'm going to express
[1:58:08] that happiness.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, heavenly father,
[1:58:23] Lord, I believe with all my heart,
[1:58:28] Lord Jesus, that you have
[1:58:31] spoke, Lord, if to no one else but
[1:58:34] myself, Lord.
[1:58:39] It seems so hard in lessa these days,
[1:58:42] Lord,
[1:58:44] this this old flesh.
[1:58:47] And it seems ironic, Lord, that we've
[1:58:49] got all these temptations around us. And
[1:58:52] we find that you yourself tempt us
[1:58:56] to see where our faith is, to see if we
[1:59:00] really believe. And Lord, you're not
[1:59:02] doing it out of meanness.
[1:59:07] You're conditioning us, Lord.
[1:59:11] And we can go home,
[1:59:14] Lord. I know there's people here, Lord,
[1:59:16] that are facing
[1:59:19] impossible situations.
[1:59:24] Lord, maybe it's their in their own
[1:59:25] life. Maybe it's with a sickness. Maybe
[1:59:28] it's with overcoming. Maybe Lord Jesus,
[1:59:30] they see in your word where you said
[1:59:32] raise them up in the way that they
[1:59:33] should go and when they get older they
[1:59:35] will not depart. And Lord, they're they
[1:59:36] seem so far away from where you called
[1:59:38] them in the way that we raised them.
[1:59:48] But Lord, is there anything too hard for
[1:59:52] God?
[1:59:55] Is there any circumstance, Lord Jesus,
[1:59:58] that we as a bride won't be able to
[2:00:00] overcome?
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; No, Lord. I know with all my heart
[2:00:10] there's nothing too hard for you.
[2:00:15] Lord, help us to
[2:00:18] look to your word, to your promise,
[2:00:22] and embrace, Lord Jesus, what you've
[2:00:25] called us to.
[2:00:28] And Lord, even when our our mind is one
[2:00:32] set one way and
[2:00:35] you go the opposite direction, Lord, I
[2:00:38] know as the bride of Christ, we we say,
[2:00:40] "All right."
[2:00:42] But sometimes it hurts even still.
[2:00:47] Sometimes we can't understand it. Lord,
[2:00:49] just give us grace.
[2:00:52] Lord, we love you.
[2:00:55] I pray, Father, that you would just help
[2:00:57] each and every one in this building
[2:00:59] tonight, Lord,
[2:01:01] to look to the author and the finisher
[2:01:04] of our faith
[2:01:06] to go ahead and finish our faith.
[2:01:09] whatever may come Lord we love you and
[2:01:12] we thank you for it Lordes
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. Amen. Can we sing
[2:01:21] uh pass me nod? You want to sing with me
[2:01:24] just a minute?
[2:01:29] If you have a need tonight, he's here.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "Brother John, maybe he's
[2:01:34] tempting me." Maybe he is.
[2:01:37] But at any moment
[2:01:40] he could deliver you.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Maybe tonight's your night.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, pass
[2:01:48] me now,
[2:01:50] oh gentle
[2:01:52] Savior.
[2:01:59] Hear

[2:07:38] Amen.
[2:07:40] Amen.
[2:07:46] You know
[2:07:48] sometimes
[2:07:50] we don't understand what's going on.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; It don't change. God always knows what's
[2:07:56] going on.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; He always does.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; He's not in dark.
[2:08:03] He's not surprised.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; He knows what you have need of.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; He's not shocked
[2:08:14] of your shortcomings and your faults and
[2:08:16] your failures.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; But he's also not shocked
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; of your faith
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; and your belief in him.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; He knows who you are better than you
[2:08:27] know. Amen.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know,
[2:08:34] I got lots of pictures of my kids all
[2:08:36] over the house. Not so many of me.
[2:08:41] There's a reason for that.
[2:08:48] Was, you know, when I forget what they
[2:08:51] were like when they were little,
[2:08:54] I can go find a picture
[2:08:59] And sometimes we forget who we are.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; And we're saying, God,
[2:09:07] I'm not I'm not anything like you called
[2:09:11] me to be.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; I fall so short.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; What's the first thing he does? Brother
[2:09:17] Harry pulls out that picture of you
[2:09:19] before the foundation of the world.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; This is it. This is you.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; You see it in my word. This is you.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; He ain't never going to forget.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; And that's what he sees. He always sweet
[2:09:33] sees that. Cuz when they get bigger,
[2:09:35] they ain't always so sweet.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; I wasn't either. And neither were you.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; But every now and then, it's good to
[2:09:48] remember what they were before the
[2:09:50] foundation of the world.
[2:09:53] Yeah.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; And he just pulls out that picture. I
[2:09:56] open up that word and I say,
[2:10:00] "Oh, mama, that's me.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Mama, that's me."
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; I see myself in that word.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't have any faults? No.
[2:10:15] That's when I need it the most
[2:10:18] is when I'm falling short and I'm I'm
[2:10:20] failing. Yeah.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; I need to look into his promise and see
[2:10:25] that he sees me the same way he and and
[2:10:29] he's wanting me to see who I am. Amen.
[2:10:32] God bless you, brother Justin. I
[2:10:34] appreciate you all. God bless.
[2:10:36] [Applause]
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many you can say it's been
[2:10:46] good to be in the house of the Lord this
[2:10:48] evening. Amen. We'll sing this song as
[2:10:50] we get ready to go. Let's just stay stay
[2:10:51] in worship just for a couple more
[2:10:53] minutes. I know it's late and kids
[2:10:54] getting back to school, but let's just
[2:10:55] sing. He didn't throw the clay away. You
[2:10:58] know, Brother John's talking about he
[2:11:00] every time you stumble and fall and
[2:11:02] that's the only song I could really
[2:11:03] think of. So, let's sing a song.
[2:11:08] He is
[2:11:10] the potter.
[2:11:13] I am the clay
[2:11:19] molded
[2:11:21] in his image
[2:11:23] is how he wants me
[2:11:26] to stay.
[2:11:28] But I stumble
[2:11:32] and I fall
[2:11:35] and my vessel
[2:11:38] breaks.
[2:11:40] He just picks up all the broken pieces.
[2:11:45] He doesn't throw
[2:11:48] the clay away.
[2:11:54] And over
[2:11:57] and over
[2:12:00] he molds me
[2:12:03] and makes me
[2:12:06] into
[2:12:08] his likeness.
[2:12:11] He fashions
[2:12:14] the way
[2:12:25] I am today.
[2:12:29] And it's all because Jesus
[2:12:35] did all the clay.
[2:12:44] empty
[2:12:46] and broken.
[2:12:48] I came back to him,
[2:12:54] a vessel
[2:12:57] unworthy.
[2:12:59] I've been so
[2:13:01] scared by sin.
[2:13:04] But he did not
[2:13:07] despair.
[2:13:09] He started over
[2:13:13] again.
[2:13:15] Oh, and I'm so
[2:13:20] eating the road
[2:13:23] clay.
[2:13:26] [Music]
[2:13:28] Now,
[2:13:34] he knows me and makes me
[2:13:40] into
[2:13:42] his lik
[2:13:55] of honor
[2:13:58] I am today.
[2:14:02] And it's all
[2:14:05] because Jesus
[2:14:08] in the
[2:14:10] clear way.
[2:14:15] Now over
[2:14:19] and over.
[2:14:21] He holds me and makes me
[2:14:27] into
[2:14:29] his likess.
[2:14:32] He fashions
[2:14:34] the clay
[2:14:39] of the soul
[2:14:42] of honor
[2:14:45] I am today.
[2:14:50] And it's all because Jesus
[2:14:55] didn't throw
[2:14:57] the clay away.
[2:15:00] [Music]
[2:15:03] He is
[2:15:06] the potter
[2:15:08] and I am
[2:15:11] the clay.
[2:15:14] Molded
[2:15:16] in his image
[2:15:18] is how he wants me
[2:15:21] to stay. But when I stumble
[2:15:26] and I fall and my vessel
[2:15:32] breaks,
[2:15:34] he just picks up all the broken pieces.
[2:15:39] He doesn't throw the clay away.
[2:15:44] [Music]
[2:15:46] Now over
[2:15:50] and over.
[2:15:52] He holds me and makes me
[2:15:58] into
[2:16:00] his likeness.
[2:16:03] He fashions
[2:16:05] the
[2:16:11] That's all of our earth.
[2:16:15] That's what I am today.
[2:16:20] And is all
[2:16:22] because Jesus
[2:16:26] didn't throw
[2:16:28] a clear
[2:16:29] away.
[2:16:31] [Music]
[2:16:33] Now over
[2:16:36] and over.
[2:16:44] [Applause]
[2:16:46] [Music]
