getting us ready for great day tell me who shall be able to stand praise the Lord praise the Lord is is there anything more important than that if you're getting ready to go on a vacation you try to pack your suitcase and think of everything you'll need and what you can take on the flight and what's restricted and all that sort of thing you're foolish not to what about this journey when only those who have God's life the token will be allowed in this first resurrection so your skin color your wealth how nice your clothes are whether they come from the mall or from Goodwill it won't make a bit of difference what's going to matter is your heart is right before God Amen oh my I want to be ready don't you I want to be ready 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 we believe that we've got a message that is a getting ready message for sure one that's not rocking us to sleep and Leo deia and telling us everything's going to be good if we can just make it through the election year well I read the other day where it's always normal for heart attack rates to increase in presidential election year I thought thought wow ain't that something so you get all tore up have a heart attack and die and didn't do you a bit of good I mean you worry you fret you fear over the whole thing and whatever whoever is supposed to be in there is going to be in there anyway so look children they ain't no needing worrying and fretting over where the Trump's going to be there Camala I'll tell you who's going to be there the powers that be are ordained of God yes but brother Donnie I don't want so and so well may not want so and so either but if God wants somebody in there I don't care what we do we are not going to stop it that's right so I'd say we enjoy life we serve the Lord with all of our heart and then the morning after the election I guess we'll all know won't we and who knows we may not live to C anyway the Rapture may come first so why should I focus on that I want to focus on me being ready for the resurrection 1 Thessalonians 4:13 but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope now that's the sad part for we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them I love the way he says this also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him amen will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord how many believes Paul had the word of the Lord concerning this okay now according to the Bible we're supposed to have at least two or three witnesses can anybody give me another witness testing one two one one two one according to the Bible two three Witnesses right you mean a prophet could get something from the Lord and it not even be written in the Bible Paul did and that's part of the problem I found with a lot of the message people they don't believe that about our Prophet amen they absolutely do not they do not believe that he could receive the word of the Lord that's why that they want to take their Bible knowledge and try to judge a Vindicated Prophet H need to go back to primmer don't they yeah this we say unto you by the word of the Lord Peter never said it Matthew Mark Luke John James now the rest of them that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord the Lord Jesus never even said this when he was here why he wanted his son to say this shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout an order command specifically a stimulating cry a signal is given to men a commander with a loud summons a trumpet call for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall shall be caught harpazo catch up take my Force catch away to seize carry off by force claim for oneself eagerly to snatch out our way it sounds like to me whoever's in charge of this Rapture is coming with great haste and he is going to snatch us us out of here with Force then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord now wait a minute whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa now how can that be when John saw the new city descending from God out of Heaven coming down on the Earth but Paul says when we go up so shall we ever be with the Lord now wait a minute wait a minute what well you mean Paul said something that we can't understand most prophets do say all kinds of things that we don't understand the quicker we can get to that spot the closer we'll be to God actually so shall we ever be with the Lord up there how it going to be up there and be down here don't worry about it God will fix it wherefore this is something we can all understand Comfort one another with these words how many loves him tonight with all your heart God a prayer request something you need prayer for desire in your heart brother Pete Lawson had text me this evening before church and he hurt his back and he wanted us to be remembering remembering him tonight so let's let's go before the Lord now Lord Jesus we're so thankful father that you have given us your word by which we can live our everyday lives in your word it consists of songs Psalms oracles Mysteries easy to understand principles hard to comprehend things the will of God revealed the will of God hidden the will of God in the future the will of God in the present the will of God in the past so truly we need you the author of the book to help help us to understand the time the season where we are for we could read our Bible every day and if we would be possible for us to memorize every verse and we could quote it from the beginning to the end and still not really understand much about it because we must know the author to catch spiritual penmanship on our heart hearts and our souls so we ask you tonight that you would speak to us Lord we pray that you be mindful of the sick and the needy Lord Brother Pete Lawson we pray for our brother tonight all the requests Lord that were signified by the uplifting of hands would you meet every need according to your great riches father we pray in Jesus name and the Saints said amen amen God bless you friends you may be seated it's not really hard to understand why that the coming of the Lord and the Rapture has been something that has been so misunderstood down through time of course we know the Bible doesn't even use the word rapture but it comes from a root word which is similar to the one we read there called up or catchup and then because the Lord Jesus when he was here spoke of several advents that he would come he spoke about it in Matthew 24 he spoke about it in Luke 17 he spoke about it in Luke 21 and he identified as the coming of the Son of God then he called it the coming of the the son of man and he called it a coming in the clouds and then he called it a coming which would be a visible coming then John catches it and sees him coming out of Heaven on a white horse which Jesus never even mentioned either nor did Paul then Paul writes about this coming and then we have a prophet in this day which inserts another coming which seems even more mysterious called The Bride coming of Christ the bride coming of Christ so then people look at it and they try to think okay so Jesus is going to come and the trumpet is going to sound and everybody's going to hear it and the graves are going to burst open and we'll see the Dead come out and airplanes will crash and buses will crash and cars will crash everywhere and then others say no no no no no that's not the way the com of the Lord's going to be there ain't no Rapture cuz the Bible don't say nothing about no Rapture the church goes through the tribul ation period And I can say Amen to that the church does now that's what I used to believe and preach I never believed in a Rapture until I come to this truth so what I saw was that the church would go through the tribulation period for purification I was right as far as I could see but I needed an understanding of the difference between the bride and the church now a lot of people still believe that same thing that there is no Rapture there is no catching away so then they put that coming when every eye will Behold Him that is scripture but that's not the Rapture so what coming is that what is the coming of Revelation 19 when John sees him coming out of Heaven on a white horse and the faithful The Chosen the called they come out of heaven with him on white horses and then how is it that Paul could insert this and no one else even Bears witness in the same way that Paul identified this coming wonder why Peter didn't say something about it wonder why Jesus didn't say something in the same way so it almost seems that Jesus said his coming in one way or one form or fashion John said it in another and Paul said it in another and you look at it and you try to think well how does it all fit together but now remember he can come as many times as he wants to and in this day what's astounding is that there is a coming of the Lord Jesus which is even more mysterious than first Thessalonians 4 and that is the revealing of the son of man which of course is a Prelude and ties into the bride coming of Christ so what A peculiar term bride coming of Christ now why didn't Paul say it that way oh why didn't Matthew write it that way why didn't John you know because God gives to each one I'm talking about prophets now their portion of the word so Paul could not say exactly John's portion John had a great insight about the coming of the Lord but John never wrote about the Rapture per se so John doesn't identify the Rapture going away he says it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we'll be like him but John gave no divine order John didn't say the dead would rise first or the living would be changed first John didn't say Jesus didn't exactly give the divine order he left that to Paul y'all believe this right so the Lord Jesus could allow Paul to write part John to write part Matthew to WR part well if he had another prophet in the last day could not he allow him also to say another part of the mystery now if the anointing of Elijah and Malachi 45 is actually split in half and God would take the first part of that and Jesus clearly identified that John the Baptist fulfilled that first part of that scripture is that right so whenever his disciples ask him how come the scribes say that Elias's come I want you to notice the scribes they knew this but the disciples never said they they knew so it kind of perplexed them cuz most of the disciples were the Pharisee aspect so they looked at things a little bit different but it was the scribes or the doctors of the law so they'd come to the disciples and say hey what what about this thing about Elijah wh what's your master teach about that and I said we don't we don't really even know we we not already heard him say anything about Elijah so they asked the Lord Jesus uh you you're talking about going to Jerusalem and you're talking about the son of man's going to go up and this is going to happen how come the the scribes say elij has got to come first and Jesus said he's already come and you didn't know it but I say unto you Elias truly shall first come now watch how Jesus Takes Malachi 4 and divides that verse and shows that part of it actually happened in his day but prophesying the rest of it would happen in our day now he says Elias has already come and when everyone began to explain it then the disciples knew that he spake of John the Baptist but nowes Jesus divided it and said truly Elias shall which we all know means future tense shall come and restore all things now somebody that knows your Bible I'll give you the opportunity to stand to your feet right now and tell me what did John the Baptist restore if he fulfilled first and second half of Malachi 4:5 what did he restore yeah was it the law the mishna the Torah written and Unwritten did he point them back to the Ten Commandments did he point them back to a levitical priesthood did he point them back to the law what did John restore them to John identifies himself in Isaiah 40 verse3 whenever the head men sent out their disciples and they said uh those that are above us are you know our our chief uh organizational guys they sent us out to ask you who are you are you Elijah and he said no oh say okay go so so somebody help me here so did Jesus lie or did John lie boy seems like it's getting awful warm in here to me now Jesus said that John Was Elijah but when they asked John was he Elijah he said no I'm not but you see John was answering I'm not that Elijah of the last day amen John was not saying he did not have the spirit of Elijah the angel of the Lord identified who he was and Luke one whenever he tells the identification of John's Ministry and then when when they ask him who are you that we may give an answer to those who sin us he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way for the Lord not a restoration Prophet at all now what John was doing he was taking up the identification of a servant which would go before a no man or a king or a general now they did not have Interstate 26 they didn't even have okalona Road they did not have roads the way we do today so they would send out men in front of them if they were coming on a chariot and they might send them out several days or several weeks in advance depending on how long their Journey was and they would dig up the Rocks they would move the trees and they was making a road for this great man to come not restoring not rebuilding making a road so John said this is my mission I'm throwing rocks out of the way I'm throwing these things that are in the past of the oncoming one now who was it that was able to receive the coming or the Advent of the Lord Jesus those who heard the preparation message now I know there are those even who say they believe the message of the hour that do not really preach the message of the hour they think it's enough to Simply believe God sent a prophet but they really don't preach the message they just go through the Bible stories that's been preached for hundreds and hundreds of years and they keep the preaching of the message to themselves but what if we would have done that in the days of John the Baptist come on and John the Baptist would have just stood up and knew who he was but he never really threw any rocks out of the way or he never really you know crossed a branch and and made a path across he never done any of that he said you know what it it'll cause too much trouble so I I'm just going to go down through here and I I'll shovel out a little bit of sand and I I I just ain't going to cause much of a Ruckus and I I'll be loved and I'll be accepted by everybody but John caused a lot of trouble now you realize why because he had to throw a Pharisee over here and a sadducee over there and a scribe cuz they was right in the middle of the way and John had to absolutely get their hide out from under the chariot wheels of the oncoming King so sometimes it might have been Theory it might have been ideology it might have been a priest it might have been a you know some King whoever it was but John said I'm here to prepare the way of the Lord the way had not been prepared by anyone else so who was it then when the Lord Jesus come on the scene that were the initial followers of the Lord Jesus those who heard the message of the first part of Malachi 45 who was it that killed the Lord Jesus those who refused the first part of the message of Malachi 45 who's going to go in the Rapture in the last days those who hear the last part of Malachi 45 now it's not enough to say well I I believe it God sent a prophet every devil in hell believes that they got way more sense than a lot of these folks that have left the message them devils are trying to talk them people out of the message and then they'll stand before them that day and going to be condemned whenever ever they do but only those who receive the Preparatory message by this messenger and he was identified by the scripture then when the Lord Jesus come what did John do he turned that day and he said Behold the Lamb of God their hearts had been turned toward him so John had made a way he had straightened out all the path boy he had tore high he was rough as he could be and then he pointed the followers of himself toward the lord Jesus and that's exactly what the Lotter part of Malachi 45 is going to do as well so for those who believe that in the last day that the bride whoever goes in the Rapture will be a confederation or a blending together of genuine message people there will also be Catholics Baptists Methodist Church of God W this trinitarian Mormons all this and that and the other now how does that answer to the scripture the way that it did to the first fulfilling of the first half of Malachi 4 so there was no need in reality for God to send Malachi for the first time if you didn't really need to hear what he had to say to meet Jesus it's the same in the last sending of that same anointing that if you do not need to hear what that messenger said there was no need for God to even send him in the first place because you can belong to a denomination you can pray to Mary you can have your rosary on your neck and the last prayer you pray is to Mary and to Joseph and St Andrew and St bonfice and then in a moment and a twinkling of an eye you're changed so you're sitting there with mascara on you're a woman you got on pants you got on earrings you got you know all that sort of thing of the world you're a man and you're sitting there transgender male and you just did a drag show night before last but yet you are a Believer and you're going in the Rapture trash nonsense praise the Lord I don't know the names and I don't know how many but I do have a general idea of who's going to go in this Rapture in the last days it will be those who are following the LGH part of the message of Malachi 45 I ain't talking about those that are just sitting around it and they don't live it they don't really believe it they might be able to talk it I ain't talking about that I'm talking about those that believe it so much they are living every day for the coming of the Lord Jesus they are watching they are waiting they are praying they're doing everything they know to do they are concerned about their children they're concerned about the loss come on somebody preach with me tonight why because they know that coming of the Lord could be before 6:00 in the morning they know that what lacks being fulfilled as far as the bride of Christ is concerned can you imagine the prophet in the late 60s saying that he did not know of one more scripture that needed to be fulfilled before the bride went away well if he would say that then what about now friends but keep in mind now that it will be the concept of teachers and theologians that will bring this false Doctrine to people and rock them to sleep when with the leot to see and LBI that everybody's going to go in the Rapture and all you have to do is believe in the cross that's all you need to do so you don't need the Holy Ghost it don't matter how you dress it don't matter how you live because you believe in the cross of course the Lord Jesus himself never taught that nor did the apostles because Jesus told his Apostles it was they must go get the Holy Ghost by the time Jesus told them and of course acts 1 and8 they already believed in the cross but believing in the cross was not enough to keep them from denying the Lord Jesus they seen him die on the cross and yet every one of them fled is that true so there had to come something else than Believing on the cross there had to come the life of the Lamb of God which died on the cross had to come back and beside the worshiper and Purge their conscience and fill them with the same life that the Lamb of God had himself and that's why when they begin to preach now Paul when he comes and he went to the upper coast of Ephesus and he finds certain disciples there and he said unto them how have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe they said unto him we have not so much heard if there be any Holy Ghost now they he said well how was you baptized well we were B baptized under John there were two dispensations behind they were still baptizing the way that John baptized John never said a name John simply baptized unto him that was to come and Paul told him you got to be baptized over again and of course they was baptized and the Holy Ghost fell on them well they were good Baptist Believers but it was not enough they had to have the Holy Ghost may I say to every member of word of of Life church it's not enough to come here it's not enough to come two times a week three times a week five times a week it's not enough to have long hair sisters it's not enough Brothers to look like a man and not look like a woman but we must have the Holy Ghost in our souls we must be born again we must have the exact same light that was in Jesus Christ it will be those and those alone that will go in the Rapture now if we look at that and then we come back and say so what will make us different than the prior ages that looked for the coming of the Lord will there be an abundance of more knowledge will there be a greater understanding of of Truth what will it that will bring us to the place that we will need to be so for 2,000 years 7 Church age dispensations people had believed in the power of the blood the power of the cross the power of forgiveness the power of mercy and the power of the attributes of God they believed in many of these great principles for thousands of years and yet believing in that never produced a Rapture in the first age and it hasn't produced one yet then when we come to the restoration of gifts on ausa Street then people begin to believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they begin to believe in speaking in tongues prophecy interpretation and so on and yet that swept the world tens of millions of people started and yet believing in that alone never brought a Rapture so here was the people on isusa street when it started from there and it swept the world the dead were being raised cancers was being heal blinded eyes were coming open all kinds of great phenomenal things that was happening in the 40s and the 50s and the 60s which to this day has not been surpassed and my view never will be because it'll never be a global thing as it was then and all those Miracles alone never produced a Rapture so then we come to where that we have a man who says an angel of God and told him that he was sent with a message from the presence of God and that his message would for around the coming of the Lord Jesus people began to flock to his ministry by the tens of thousands the dead were raised again the lame made to walk the blind received their sight people who were born without eyeballs would receive eyeballs created before thousands of people sitting there in those Services you've heard the story probably of brother Billy Paul telling about it he told me about it as well one time whenever brother random was going to pray for a little child little girl best I remember and the little girl had no eyeballs and the brother Bram was going to pray for her and he started to pray and then he stopped and said I'm sorry honey I forgot to ask you what color eyes did you want well that's pretty specific is it not what color eyes do you want and the little girl tells him what color eyes that she wanted and guess what she got what she wanted now that's pretty phenomenal is it not that that's pretty awesome but at the same time or Roberts was praying for all kinds of people now for those of you that have not done your homework I would advise you to do so just so you understand that brother Brandon was not the only one that had phenomenal Miracles as a matter of fact when I started looking at this message it was not the Miracles that led me to believe that brother Brandon was a prophet cuz I'd seen miracles in my own Ministry I'd seen miracles in the ministry of other men that I preached with and preach for so it was not the Miracles alone that got my attention Jack Cole was one of the greatest phenomenal men whenever people would would come up Jack Coast Tent he'd have an anvil sitting right up close to his pull pit whenever people would come up with glasses he'd reach and grab a hold of your glasses and he had that Anvil and a hammer he'd stand there and bust your glasses right there if you had an heade he'd take that heade off and bust your heate you better have faith or H all the rest of your life one of the other so I mean there was phenomenal things that took place it covered the Earth till osbor now that man gives some of the the greatest testimonies about brother random that that you can ever hear in your life he said other men told us about Jesus Christ but William Brandon showed us Jesus Christ that's right and yet the phenomenal the Miracles the supernatural that Circle The Globe I'm not talking about a little bit in the church here and a little bit in the church there it was all over the world so when a brother come to my church and started preaching that brother brandham was Was Elijah and that he come to fulfill that scripture well I didn't like it and it upset me cuz I thought he ought to talk to me first about it before he done it I was the pastor so anyway I started looking and I thought you know what I I'm going to get my Bible I got in the scripture I started reading reading reading and I got in I said well even Jesus himself said that this was going to happen so I I come to that conclusion all right the Lord Jesus said this is going to happen then I thought okay if is going to happen has it happened before now has it circled the Earth has it come over the Earth and I come to the conclusion no it had not and then if it is yet to come or if it's happened in my day then who would that be so I started studying or Roberts I studied TL osbor I studied Jack Cole I studied valma Gardner I studied all these men in that era I read all things are possible David irvan I read so many books and did so many research looking why I didn't want to be deceived I didn't want to be lost and I certainly didn't want to deceive other people and whenever I got done with all of that research and looking I come to one conclusion and let me say this the conclusion that I reached all those years ago I still have the same conclusion tonight there was one man that would be able to fulfill that spot and I reckon you know what his name is don't you well you know it's really sad because a lot of those who said they believe this and supposedly came to the same conclusion they are no longer of the same conclusion which is really really sad cu the Bible says it would have better for them to have not known the way of life than after they have known it to turn and go back then they go back to like a s in her wallowing in a Tom or the dog returning to its vomit well that's exactly what they're eating on too vomit all you got to do is listen to a few of them and you can see but whenever I wanted to be sure brother Joel that I was going to present this in the right way and for everything that I approached every bit that I looked to me it was conclusive that was only one man that could match that identification or Roberts Le us un Unity there's Bridges there's roads this and that and the other that's named after Oral Roberts all you got to do is go to Asheville and you'll see Bridges and Roads and so on named after Billy Graham he left us a college well this man left this this man left that one left the university another left this you know out in Arizona Miracle Valley by a all so but what did Brother brandham leave us there is no University in Jeffersonville I've never across any bridges that are named in dedication to William Mar and brandham there are no public schools named after him but what did he leave he left us a desire that people would fall in love with Jesus Christ it it would absolutely break his heart to see what people have done with his message that people oh my that people want want to set down the ministry and shut them up you imagine if brother Brandon was sharing this day what he would do oh he'd probably take off his belt and wire some of these people out brother brandom ordained preachers to get in the pull pit and preach and others say they're doing what he said they're trying to discourage every preacher they can there's a problem somewhere friends come on don't get quiet on me now but you and I have to make up our minds do we believe this word that God has sent us in this last day and if we believe this message is the answer to Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 not only Revelation 10:7 but remember in the early years the prophet whenever God opened up a portion of that to him he would quote it Revelation 10:7 Revelation 10:7 but as the word become more in plain view and the bride coming of Christ was opened up to him he started including Revelation 101 to seven now you see Revelation 10:7 was as far as he saw brother Daryl for many many years but what is revelation 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven with a little an open book of course and he said and then as God opened to the prophet those other six verses he be to quote that in with Luke 17:30 and identified as the bride coming of Christ I hope you understand where I'm going tonight that the Lord Jesus is not just coming he's already here as a matter of fact he's been here for quite some time so it's not the coming of Revelation 19 it is not the coming of Matthew 24 when every eye will Behold Him but it is in contrast the coming of Romeo looking for his Juliet and he leans the seven steps lighter over against her house against the window and the shout the message goes out and wakes up Juliet out of her Le to see and Slumber and she goes to the window and she said it is the voice of my beloved so you see some people push play and all they hear is the voice of a man some people come to Word of Life all they hear is the voice of Daryl word or Donnie Reagan or some of these other preachers but other people have another way to hear and they're hearing the voice of their bridegroom and their bridegroom is telling them get ready make every saying right trim your lamps come on Saints oh Hallelujah so you see those who have the ability to hear Let Him hear now whenever we look at the coming of the Lord if it will be a continuing of the preaching of the Cross why was not in the first church age a Rapture which was preached since the impression of the Cross would have been so new and so fresh upon those people so the the men that would have been preaching it would have at least been in the distance where it happened John was the only one that we have record of that was actually there and yet John mentions the cross of the Lord Jesus less than Paul well I find that very odd John was actually there and he mentions the cross of Jesus less and fewer times than the four gospels well if just preaching the cross is what you need Paul must have missed it 2,000 years ago why would Paul preach on the Holy Ghost and gifts and hair and husbands loving your wives and wives obeying your husband why in the world would he not just preach the cross the cross the cross the cross the cross why would he preach that less why would John the very one who was there and John himself every sermon John preached was not on the cross as a matter of fact You' think the only man that was there brother the Rob that that man would preach it over and over again I'm not going to tell you how many times he said it CU I want you look it up yourself it's quite surprising how few a time you know how we are as we go through things that you we've we've heard brother Daryl talk about the experience with Jessica you've heard me talk about different experiences and you listen here brother Brandon talk about experiences he had and would say some of the same things over again well your John was the only disciple that saw the cross wonder why he didn't reiterate it over and over and over and over and if just believing the death of the Lord Jesus on the cross would endure people with on high with power from on high You' think he preach it every sermon but he yet he actually preached the Holy Ghost more than he preached the cross wow so there must be then a message that will forun the Rapture right amen now if the Lord Jesus had to be foran by a message of preparation by a messenger of preparation then those who heard the messenger in turn turn right around and heard the Lord Jesus those who crucified John eventually crucified the Lord Jesus those who crucify the message of the last days they don't realize it but they're crucifying Christ the second time you see the Lord Jesus had these seven Church angels in his right hand now most of these people who fight the message will not admit it but actually they have a problem with God their problem is not with brother bradam their problem is not actually with us their problem is with God because why did God vindicate this man and even his proteges of that time you listen to The Men Who were there with him and they were not the ones that sang all the lies that are being said now they were afraid to they were scared to death to say things against it because they saw what happened can you imagine sitting there and you walk up and the man says I see you live on 385 North Street you went to your doctor today I see there's three steps going up to your house your doctor had on glasses the doctor said this that and that and you're going to St there and say that man's a devil well there's enough dumb people left in the world some of them would but there's enough people that's got enough sense to say I don't understand it but I sure ain't going to say nothing about it but you realize that there must must then come a message now to me whenever we look at the hour and the time that we're in it makes me want to get into the message more and more than I've ever been before to make sure that I am not overlooking an essence of something that is going to be needful for us to be able to get out of here or are we somehow convinced well we can just kind of keep on going the same way we've gone for years because come to church we play church we come to church when we want to when we don't want to you know it's okay and we just have the same old desire you know and and we we love God but God ain't everything to us we get much more excited about a vacation than we do God or we get much more excited about making more money or something like that and God's good sure yeah God's a good God but the world says that but or is there something more by which it will require us to move into a higher place than what we've ever been before and if there is that where would we find the source of it would it be just going back through and preaching Daniel and the lionen again or would it be repr preaching Shadrach mesach and Abednego or repr preaching about David and gol I love all those stories don't you I believe them with all of my heart but if I'm understanding it right when John the bapti this come he wasn't just standing up there Thou shalt have no other gods before me Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not C th labors why there's no sermons that we have recorded that John ever stood up and quoted The Ten Commandments but what was John preaching he was preaching a message that was the identification of the hour and the time they lived in there's one standing among you he said that you don't know and I don't know who he is either but that one that sent me said on whom you will see the spirit of God descending it is he that baptizes with the Holy Ghost amen so you imagine now the scribes and the Pharisees that go to the synagogue and book Moses said this and Moses said that and what are they doing they're preaching backwards they're preaching history they're preaching what was not what is they're preaching history so what did they blind the people with historical truths historical truths mixed in with a little bit of skepticism a little bit of theology what I believe and this is what I think and when the present tense truth walk walked on the earth they said do away such a man will not have such a man as that rule over us why that that that John the Baptist he's a wild man he's crazy other man's absil out of his mind eat Locust and Wild Honey come out and dress like my Lord look like a hippie to me his hair all growed out and had a leather girdle on the prophet said he walked right up there before them great men and he said the the mud was squishing up between his toes now can you imagine a man walking in here tonight with a letter girdle on and and his toe tracks mud tracks falling all out that white door woo on this white carpet he said Lord have mercy oh my what in the world are you doing would we accept such a rough guy my we W hard to accept the guy that raises his voice we've got a a water down in the message of the Hour come on somebody we've got our identification of what we think it is but what is it going to be that's going to usher in will it be miracles in one sense yes will it be tapes in one sense yes will it be you Services yes will it be Church yes will it be us living right yes will it be Grace yes Faith yes power yes strength yes you see it will be a multiple aspect that God is bringing it under under the opes of the word of this hour will we still preach the cross yes will we still preach sanctification yes because some folks still ain't Sanctified yet amen will we still preach the Holy Ghost and water baptism we will will we still preach uh healing for the sick and prayer line we sure will we're going to continue to preach it but we're also going to bring it up to the home state by where we're focusing on our grand finale our grand finale is not who can have the longest prayer line our grand finale is not who can have the most excitable music or who has the greatest special singers it's us coming to our position in Christ Jesus and the word of God becoming so much of who we are that us and the word become actually one and in that day it will be I and the Father the father and me and I and you and you and me and you'll be able in that day to say I and my father are one now it's not just a good scripture or a good quote to quote but it will be a reality now how many believes in rapturing faith the Bible don't say that how many believes we need ruring Faith okay so how come you believe that why do you believe it brother why you believe it brother Joe why do we believe it Carol why do we believe we need rapturing Faith because as God unveiled his coming and perect stages we believe he's done the same thing in this day now Paul give us more about the order of the resurrection of the coming and then the rest of the Apostles did but even Paul you will not find it where Paul mentions the term rapturing Faith No rapturing strength no rapturing power nor rapturing Grace wonder why they wern't going to need it Luther didn't preach rapturing face why he wasn't going to need it but if there is an age and a group of people on the Earth that are actually going to be alive then what will they need to hear that will bring rapturing face into them what will it be rapturing face preaching now it also ties together though with healing and Miracles and prayer for the sick and so on because brother Ram says it over and over again if we cannot have enough faith for the healing of the body how can we have faith for a body change so for those in on the flip side around the message that don't believe in the Supernatural they don't believe in prayer lines they don't believe in any of that well they might as well give up on ring face because brother brandom tied that together with prayer lines and with healing and with Miracles praise the Lord but that alone is not the only answer so we could preach healing Miracles prayer lines and still not be the culmination of rapturing Faith we're just on the visible evidence of someone getting healed do you honestly believe that people only get healed in our message you can go on YouTube you can go on all kinds of these Church websites there's all kinds of people that give healed in Pentecostal churches in Baptist churches and all kinds of places there's people that's come through our prayer lines right here that did not believe this message didn't believe it when they got prayed for and do not believe it now one of the great Miracles that brother Matt Watkins shared with you and showed you the picture of the man that God healed with cancer remember that during the meeting that man never did accept the message an absolute tremendous miracle and God it was not through his church that they prayed for him it was through the ministry of men who believe the message of the hour and that man never did embrace the message and passed away a year or so ago so the healing is not just for message people well if Divine Healing alone is the Forerunner of the body chains then that means Pentecostals are going to get it too and don't even believe the message so they make fun of the prophet and life at the prophet and say well glory to God I got healed so it means I'm going to get a body change no it doesn't so you know the prophet in bringing this and he started way back in the 50s and he coined the term of rapturing faith I want you he said but God's just now loosening up the church everywhere look at this date 32653 getting in order now so he can get it into the Rapture got to give it rapturing face before it can go in the Rapture so God has to give an element of people a rapturing faith before they go on the Rapture the people are in the spirit of the last days like they was in the days of Noah eating drinking marrying giving in marriage unconcerned don't care walking around anything else he said and these American people is the worst on the face of the earth now look what we as Americans have to deal with God's Prophet identifies us as the worst on the face of the Earth of being nonchalant non-caring whatever just whatever that's part of what you and I will have to fight in leosa well it don't matter if I go to church if I don't if I pray if I reading my Bible it don't remember that's the spirit of the worst people on the Earth not the bride Hallelujah come on now you folks that are proud to be Americans and these American people is the worst on the face of the Earth hey High minded incontinent Fierce despisers know it all boy that describes a bunch of the message folks on it know it all if there's any place in the world when my Bible over my heart God knowing I look down on me I know I may have to stand before him before morning if I have to say so the place needs missionaries worse than any place in the world is the USA well if he would say that in 1953 what would he say in 2024 friends our nation has gone to the dogs it's said right brother Tim said it's a rat race and the rats are the only one winning well praise the Lord notice needs mission is worse than any place in the world is the USA the United States of America the greatest bunch of heathens that I know of anywhere is America heathan means unbeliever woo so this is part of the spirit that you and I have to contend with every day of our life that's the spirit of America unbeliever oh know it all you can't hold tell a lot of message folks know anything they know it all you can't hardly give them no quote you go to start quote one they'll finish it for you you can't correct them on this that and the other I hope and pray to God we never get to that place cuz when we do we are finished when we get to a place we cannot be corrected by the word come on somebody the greatest bunch of heathens that I know of anywhere is in America Heathen means unbeliever I truly believe before the church can have the Rapture it's got to have rapturing fa we can't even have faith for Divine Healing let alone rapturing Faith Now watch how it ties together got to have a faith that'll change and Quicken this body and be taken away so no doubt God knew that the message would come through a cycle for many many years to where the supernatural would be fult the supernatural would be stood against the supernat would be laughed at and made fun of I'm talking about from message pulpits and that if you believed in a move of God you was a Pentecost and you absolutely did not believe the message but in the last few years that has changed is that right and it's like there has been an Awakening of the supernatural and there are meetings going on everywhere and don't get in your mind that there's two or three churches in America is the only one where God is moving you need to broaden and take your blinders off you got blinders on you and you only look at it two three preachers you need to get rid of them blinders God is moving around the world I said God is moving around the world this is a bride move so it's not just going to happen in brother Tim's Ministry or brother Tim's church or brother Ron's Ministry brother Ron's Church alone a Word of Life Church if it's a bride Ministry it's going to happen around the world well come on now oh I know a lot of preachers don't like to testify of other healings and miracles and signs and wonders that happen in any place beside their church because it's like they're blowing the trumpet about their signs and their wonders and their miracles but I like to hear a man talk about God moving down in Murphy's Boro Tennessee I like to hear God a man of God stand in the pull pit and he's not ashamed to hear God God great power working over in South Africa or in India we ought to reach out a little bit more to keep that pride and arrogance off of us to where we think we're the only ones well just in case you think we are let me just give you a heads up tonight I'm in contact with people all over this world God is Healing The Sick God is raising the dead God is performing Miracles God is doing great signs come on somebody it ain't just amongst the white folks it ain't just amongst a few uh you know prized American preachers it's going on around the world remember the bride will be Universal will there be healings Universal that will forerun the Rapture amen will there be Miracles that will forun the Rapture amen but not Miracles alone not Miracles alone now listen he says I believe there's a church on its Road tonight a power of the Living God that men will speak the word here and there and it will flash like lightning I want you to notice he doesn't say Amen singular and he doesn't just say here and he happened to be at the brandom Tabernacle but he said here and there now this is what I hear when I press play I don't understand why other folks don't hear that when they press play unless they don't play this tape well Glory I believe there's a church on its Road tonight a power of the Living God that men men will speak the word here and there it'll flash like lightning and a church is coming out not a psychologist not some of this put on make belief but a real true genu anointed Holy Ghost called out church and then he says that beautiful word that we all love so much notice again I believe that the age has come now the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit and power and signs and wonders this great pouring out of God's spirit in the last days and that's the thing that'll bring Faith into the people that'll take a rapturing face notice he never says that it'll just be cold dead theology or just cold dead Bible studies alone or repeating of the Bible stories he ties it over and over again with a move of the Supernatural and the phenomenal now anybody that says I don't believe in the phenomenal is a ball fa liar I do believe in the phenomenal but I'm not going to stop there I'm the ultimately what I'm looking for more is the change of this body not just to get it healed in case you all hadn't noticed it I've crossed the border I am an old man now so I don't just need healing every now and then I'm wanting to be a young man Big Time amen praise the Lord I said I'm want to be a young man and I'm W you all to be young with me I believe in healing I told you before I've had healing I've had miracles in my Ministry since I was a boy preacher Miracles are not something new to me I've experienced all kinds of them I've never even shared with you all one little tiny bit of what God's done through my Ministry through the years I believe in all of that but that's not the head I'm not stopping at Miracles it's only a step to Lead Me Higher to the great miracle of the body chains I don't want to just talk about healing I don't want to just talk about prayer line and act as if though that's the finale that that is not the finale oh my how can the church be raptured notice as God talked to Moses paragraph 25 how can the church be raptured when we haven't even got enough faith for healing we've got to have rapturing faith first that's right how that God moves by his Spirit signs and wonders now notice again how he ties rapturing the precursor the Forerunner of that is going to be a supernatural move among us look friend you may wonder why why y'all talking about it brother Donnie why do you want it well if you'll study the message and you'll see the way the prophet was leading up to it you realize he was not telling us now there's going to come a time it'll be real dry and there won't be no move of God there will be no move of the spirit and everybody will just go to church and they'll sit there just struggle to stay awake and the Mysteries will be so deep and so profound and everybody will sleep I way through the service and then they'll get up and go out they'll go there to the gym and they'll have coffee and they'll have a few Donuts every now and then and they're going to talk but oh some glorious day rapturing Faith is coming well you show me where he said that and I'll preach it next Wednesday night but until he does I'm going to preach this this Wednesday night cuz I know he didn't say that nobody so I'm going to go and preach this so he foran this with what that you one way you'd be able to know it but notice the difference between this and isusa street isusa street went to seed on the element of the supernatural that they had so they went no farther so when God brought Malachi for on the scene what did they do oh we don't need no Prophet we ain't follow no Prophet glory to God we speak in tongu oh he's against women he he's trying to put the gifts in the backround you know it just absolutely blows my mind that preachers in this message will spend hours hours and they will study hundreds of quotes to prove that we need the gifts back in the church and then they will deny the same prophets teaching of how the gifts ought to be operated in the church now somebody please enlighten me I tell you what it is I don't need much Enlightenment you're picking what you want you're picking and choosing and the message is like a cafeteria to you so you take the quote you want and somebody else was in womit the prophet said well well well our church is Sovereign so what do you mean by being Sovereign you mean you take what you want so what if that quote you left out is one of those required for the Rapture how do you know do you have Rapture and non Rapture quotes in your books apparently I didn't get those books I mean my mind just come plain old plaino whenever I I pull it up on my phone I share it every day with somebody around the world and I don't have Rapture quotes and non-existent Rapture quotes there I guess I don't understand where people coming from well yeah I guess I really do it's because they exalt their own understanding above the teaching of the prophet of God the bottom line is they think they know more about the gifts you got to be kidding me so we as pastors know more about how gifts ought to be operated in a church than a godsent prophet with the restoration of the word you mean He restored water baptism He restored the godhead He restored all this other stuff and he still remained a Baptist when it come to the rest of the GI come on children how in the world could you even follow a man under that opes if that's what you believe if the man did not have the correct understanding of the gifts how do I know he had the correct understanding about rapturing faith since the Bible don't use that term that's one thing I love about the Lord Jesus now he can get pretty sharp of that word boy he can burn we ain't got a fire in your have I'm I'm smelling something oh it's preacher hi that's what it is oh okay yeah it's preacher hi oh my now notice how he links this so if the restoration of gifts and great phenomenal and shouting and running and jumping if that's all required I don't understand why Zeus's stre didn't have the the Rapture I don't understand why a Allen didn't have it h Richard Hall T OS me many of the men that I knew back there they the ter I don't understand why they did not produce rapal because there's not a man in this message not a one that ever had the Miracles now some of the men I just mentioned their name by never I ain't talking about a few here and there I'm talking about thousands thousands oh my well if just the healing will bring rapturing Faith somebody tell me why are we still here cuz it's got to be coupled was a message so when the preachers are preaching and they're laying out what's going to be needed then God comes along they lay their hands on the sick and blood clots goes out of people's bodies well it happened to Brother Brad Gilbert a few days ago three in his lungs now they're gone had a heart attack several years ago texted me back on Sunday said oh yeah I forgot to remind you and tell you I had a heart attack damage on my heart but he said when I was in the hospital they got to check on my heart and the doctor said that wouldn't even no sign of that heart attack they also diagnosed him with have congestive heart failure and the doctor did an x-ray and all that stuff and he said you ain't got no more congestive heart failure now what is that a sign of it's a sign that the Great Resurrection is in our midst but now I'm not going to stop just on that and go out everywhere I go preach and repeat that miracle and repeat that miracle and repeat that Miracle that's good I love for people to hear it and say it but there's got to be a message that's going to bring that plus more if not we're going straight back to Pentecost and then we just jump and shout and holler and run and glory to God this and glory to God that Hallelujah this person got healed and that person got healed and we're preaching no more than that we'll never make the Rapture unless we're hearing something that will so align our mechanics in the presence of God that when the Dynamics tried to remember let me explain to you this way when I study this sermon right here when I study I look at it from this angle and that angle and that angle and that angle and that angle and that angle and I've told you before brother Daryl was tell me Brother Don if I preach as much as you did I'd go crazy but I'm Different he's an evangelist you can't preach a 185 part sermon and we during evangelist but I approach you from one angle another another another so what is that that's our mechanics and I sat back and I study and I study and I study i f my spirit with it car can tell you when I'm out preaching somewhere in the hotel room same way I don't go out and go on a tour here and a tour there I've been all over the world seen very little of it cuz when I go I go preach I go study so I sat in the room all this great scene excit over here right here is pretty seic I think I'll just tell you here in the room then when I get up then the Holy Ghost can anoint that's right what I've applied amen oh my I get just as marveled as you do and the spirit of God will going and anointing them scriptures and anointing them close I'm thinking Lord have mercy I ain't quoted them in the scriptures in 40 years where in the world did that come from but you see I was laying on the mechanics in it was already there how can the spirit strike our mechanics if we've only got two that's right sir so the spirit comes and Strikes you and say w glory to God thank you Jesus amen I wonder what it have done if You' had that many mechanics you see this is why people miss it inp special meetings oh they go so fired up and they get everything ready and then when they come back home after special meeting it's just when's the next special meeting tonight you must know got the text you must not got a notification it's tonight every night ought to be special but you see if we put as much mechanics together expectation hope believing oh we're looking for this if we' put that much mechanic mix together for Wednesday night and Sunday morning there ain't no telling what God to do right here Among Us why the spirit of God will fall on our mechanics and if we've only got one or two it just kind of fizzes and then somebody that's got a lot of mechanics the spirit of God falls on them and they're going it's a big rocket you know and you're sitting there with your little T90 firecracker thank you Jesus but then the feeling's gone it don't last till church is over and then you blame God or you blame Brother Louie poor old fell ain't don't tell how much blame he carries Brother Lou was in the service tonight it was brother Harry it was brother har it was the drummers it was the piano I can't figure maybe it was you maybe it was you you didn't pray enough you didn't read the Bible enough inste of stands there running your jaw about 30 minutes before church come in here get down on your knees and pray have some Mechanics for the spirit of God to be able to annoy your mechanics don't you understand that's what we want we want the spirit of God not only healing our sick we want the spirit of God so grabbing a hold of our face if the prophet believed there was a church in the making then what about now let me close we got to have rapturing faith first that's right how that moves by his Spirit signs wonders begin to follow everywhere God begins to move signs and wonders follows God God's provided way that he might bring the Believers than you to a rapturing facei God's way his provided way is to bring Believers to rapturing Faith yes oh there might be somebody streaming tonight and they're say now brother Donnie well I have the answer to all that rapturing faith is on the tapes really now I'll tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to give you a few days hear me tonight GL globally I will give anyone in the world 10,000 to show me where God's Prophet said rapturing face is on the tapes I might have been born in the morning but it wasn't this morning people make him say that the seven ther people oh yes this is rapturing Faith this is it the peria people this is it this is it how many brides revivals have we had and now we're having a surge of another one oh this is it right here it's the shouting it's the running it's the jumping it's what it's this this this this oh Lord and the sad part about it is every one of them had a little bit of Truth but you see a little bit of Truth won't get you off this world we have got this big gigantic spaceship it's going to contain millions of passengers millions of passengers are going to be on board this flight some of them are actually in another dimension and they will have to fly from that Dimension down here on the tarmac of time in order to meet up with the rest of us and millions of us will get together and then we're going to take this flight into the sky so it's going to take a little bit more than an emotion and a feeling and fast music it's going to take a power that's right like we have never known before let's stand Welly some of y'all ain't search the message in Forever some of you probably got your phone pull up right now rapturing Faith you want that 10 grand that you let me know when you find money for you oh some of my critics good Lord their blood pressure is 395 over 182 their heart r is 275 wo oh my I know he I know he said it hate to be the bearer of bad news but he actually didn't say it but you see that would be the easy way that's what we want that's what people look for so you just listen and someh you get it for others it's oh I believe in Preachers I believe in going to church oh yeah brother D's got rational Faith No I don't it's not me having rapturing faith you must have it I can't have it for you you can't have it for me well all over the world right now 911 calls are being made this is the quote that people Tred to read that into Brothers it's way over several pages is it's the absolute in Jeffersonville 1962 1230 let me just go ahead and read it um so poor brother Jackie won't be receiving so many phone calls and emails in the morning Revival fires have been built for 15 years on nearly every Mountain Divine Healing just you can check me out that's fine I have no problem with that but type in rapturing faith and tapes you'll not find there's one quote in the message where it's mentioned together Divine Healing across the Nations and the power and restoration now I believe she's ready to strike that final climax Yonder to bring forth a Rapture that'll a faith that'll Rapture the church into Glory she who notice I believe she's ready to strike that final climax hter to bring forth the faith that a Rapture the church into Glory it's the truth and she's laying in the messages she who now that's the quote that people have preached for years that Rapture and Faith lady on the T it ain't even nothing like what people quoted let's just say what he said when we press play on this let's just go ahead and repeat it she she ready to strike to final climax on her to bring forth a faith that'll Rapture the church into Glory it's the TR and she's laying in the messages and the church said how many believes it will strike the Bride of Jesus Christ rapturing faith will it be healing that'll be an element of it will it be more truth an element of it another element will be you seeing who you are not just seeing that you're a housewife that you're a husband a farmer a factory worker that true because you've got to have faith in who you are instead of living your whole life well I I'm still looking for my place some of you's been in for 30 years and looking for something else cuz you don't think that you're in your place yet you understand as long as you're there you can't have that perfect Faith to know every day I'm doing what God wants me to do I'm a housewife I'm making beds I'm changing sheets I'm scrambling eggs I'm making chocolate milk I'm making apple pies I'm I'm doing this is what God wants me to do I'm living the word and if I can do anything at the church I'm there to do whatever I can do that gives you faith in your position then you have confidence in who you are it ain't like you're waiting for some great phenomenal something to go oh I'm going to this meeting I'm going to that meeting and have people to prophesy and tell me who I am H what the prophet said generally your position is revealed to you by the Holy Ghost God don't use some man to tell you you're called to preach God calls you and when you know who you are then you can lay your hand on your baby's head at night when you can't get a hold of me and can't get a hold of some of these other preachers you can say Satan in the name of Jesus take your hand off of my baby why you got confidence in who you are how many wants it with all your heart praise God thank you Lord Jesus let's bow our heads together praise the Lord heavenly father as we look at these things tonight we Ponder we think Lord Jesus we certainly want all of our mechanics to be properly aligned we want Doctrine your Prophet has taught us that we can't even be a church without Doctrine so Doctrine is more than Divine Healing Doctrine is more than Miracles Doctrine is more than just God sent a prophet so we have to have a Doctrine to be a church so we must have Doctrine we must have correction and anywhere you are there's always Supernatural Lord God we have testified we have seen you do one thing after another after another it encourages our hearts and this is why Lord I always try to come back and get them not to focus on the man that prayed the prayer CU a prophet two or three different times in his ministry had to refocus because he got the people pointed toward the gift and it said pointed more toward the sign than the city itself so the sign was pointing to the city and he said he should have been pointing to the city instead to the the sign that's the way with humans so they want this man to pray for them or that man to pray for them because we tend to Rally around people Lord God we want to Rally around you yes we thank you for the men gifted men that's among us we're grateful Hallelujah Lord Jesus we worship you tonight father your Prophet tells us in perfect faith that we long to see these Apostolic times moving Among Us he said we see it but we want to see more of it that's the way I feel tonight Lord we see it but I want to see more of it but I want to see it in the right way I don't want to see it and then following it I hear the people talking about me or talking about brother Daryl or talking about brother Pete and one of these other brothers whenever I hear that I know right then we're not seeing at the right way your Prophet even quoted it as I read it today and said the way we're doing it makes me wonder if he's pleased with it so we rally around this man or that man or this church or that church or this ministry help us Lord and we know your Prophet has taught us when we go to Ping our confidence in men you'll allow that man when we go to looking at some man and make him the ultimate you'll allow that man to make a mistake right in front of us help us not to do that Lord there's only one king and that's King Jesus we've had so many Kingdom Builders in this message Lord help us I pray not to join ranks with Kingdom building ERS but may our ranks be identified with Jesus Christ the real King we worship you tonight father oh Lord how we give praise to you now Jesus there may be some sick here tonight Lord there may be some streaming that couldn't come to church father may you go to their homes to their beds father father for some standing here that's needing healing may you go to them now father thank you Lord would you just raise your heads and open your eyes and look this way please how many here tonight is a need in your body would you just raise your hand all I I want you to look around you look around you look at the different people standing there many many people Jesus didn't say that this would be preachers only but these signs shall follow them that believe so if you know who you are as a daughter of God you know who you are as the Son of God brother Donnie but I'm not called to cast out Devils well if you run across something you can't handle we got men here that can do it but I want you to notice notice God's Prophet had people to do this over and over again in so there's an element that you don't even have to be a preacher to lay hands on Believers sister Sandy Peterson was diagnosed with one of the fastest cancers that is known to man brother Ron was telling me about it today Ron Peterson her husband but some somebody told me that she had got inspiration from the Lord Lord and she just laid her hands on herself just laid her hands on herself the doctor said you're

Donnie s let me share this with you just before we go brother Don was talking about the girl with a I believe she was a French Canadian and the prophet said what color of eyes and she said blue and the the the lord gave her blue eyes uh here a few years ago I was in St Carlos Pache Indian reservation and there's an elderly sister there who wanted to tell me something and so I sat down beside her and she told me that when brother Brenham came there she was a little girl and they had the prayer line and there was so many that they couldn't if you've been to the church it's small church so they had it outside and she said being a young girl I was setting up close to the front and said they had all the Indians sitting on blankets because there just wasn't enough room for the people to be inside she said I was sitting and said about the fourth one that came through the line was a little girl who was deaf and dumb had never spoke a word or heard a word in her life and she said the prophet had this uh interpreter who was a an Apache a female Apache who was interpreting for brother brandham and she said I standing there I was watching and the little girl came up and the prophet prayed for her and said she began to speak and said the prophet turned to The Interpreter and said now she'll speak better after a while because it sound like all the words were just going together and said now she'll talk better after a while and The Interpreter said she talk keep good now it said the little girl was speaking Apache oh God that may not do nothing for you but that just stirs my heart here's a little Apache girl who had never heard a word in her life and the first word she ever spoke it wasn't French it wasn't Spanish it wasn't English come on somebody she spoke Apache you know why cuz she was an Apache Hallelujah and if God cares enough to do that for his does not he care enough to meet every need we have tonight cast all your cares upon Him for he cares for you oh do

word into our hearts dear God and it would manifest back into our lives that Jesus Christ could be manifested on the Earth again not in a body just called the groom but in a body called The Bride oh
