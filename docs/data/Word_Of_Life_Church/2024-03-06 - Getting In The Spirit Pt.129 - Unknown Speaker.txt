I got it [Music] all [Applause] praise the Lord let's turn to the Book of Revelation tonight if you would Revelation chapter 10 verse 7 question answers tomorrow night 7:00 also I want to uh make make mention of it to you that brother Keith Phillips got to go home today at his procedure and went well so we're thankful to the Lord for that um want to just continue to remember our brother that said I could take several weeks for him to get his strength and stuff back he really really weak so just keep him in prayer if you would Revelation chapter 10 verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound now remember when the prophet quoted this he said it's not when he first first started out but it's when it began to sound his message so in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which stand upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey now this is one way that I've learned down through the years to watch people and they say they absorb the revelation of this end time of this word and you watch their life and see if everything about this message for years and years is nothing but sweet more than likely they ain't got it right yet because if it's really the truth and it's revealed to you in the right way it will be sweet but there will be such bitterness that will come with it you will pay a price if you believe this word right now you can believe this word from an intellectual conception and believe it wrong you'll pay very little price but if you believe it right you will pay a tremendous price now look at John what a strange thing this would be and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter so when it moves from the mouth to the digestion to living it every day complying to the outside requirements the inside requirements the sanctification stage of it all that's where a lot of folks drop off and it's the bitterness and they don't understand they love the sweetness of it there ain't nothing ever been as sweet as this is but there ain't nothing ever been as bitter as it can be as well ain't that something y'all looking at me strange how come we just look at the sweet side don't we that's what we look at now watch and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings H so was Jesus telling John that he was going to have a turn Ministry well Jesus told him he was going to prophesy again that do we believe John's raising from the dead well I got you on that one didn't I no but the Book of Revelation is doing that isn't it amazing that a book can represent a man or a man can repres represent a book Let's bow our heads together father we so love you tonight we thank you for the opportunity to be gathered here tonight under the opes of the revealed word of this last day we're thankful for every word of every day that you've given down through the age but we are so grateful for the word that has come to us in our day we desire to take this word and eat it all how many sweet Services have we had how many sweet meals that were just so awesome and the presence of God was so wonderful and Revelation so flooded our souls and then maybe tomorrow or the next day or next week or next month some bitter things go to happening in our lives and we wonder what is going on nothing just proof of digestion I pray you would help us tonight father as we look into your word reveal it to us in a clearer way we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus and the saints of God said amen amen God bless you you may be seated so the Book of Revelation 10 had been opened by the only one who was worthy to do it Christ which happened in Revelation chapter 5 then the seal will start breaking in Revelation CH 6 and then it opens up to Revelation 101 whenever he sees another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow on his head all these symbols of course and Declarations of something that God was showing then we come to a very peculiar part in that John is commanded to take the book and to to get the book out of the hand of the Angel it must have been I know in Vision most of us have never had visions of course like this but there must be still a sense of humanity and human feelings and human persuasion when you're under the influence of these types of Visions we know that the prophet would relate different visions that he would see and things that he would experience and he would have human action going between the Divine and the natural and it would be hard for him to tell if he was in a vision or if it was just real life so with John you must have been the same way wondering is this a vision or is this real so the angel says go take the book out of himy that's there and so he goes and he takes it and he said now he gives him into give into instruction one instruction two instruction three he has to follow him in the exact order that God gives it so he goes takes the book they said now eat the book go ahead and eat it so he takes the book of course it was assemble he goes to eating it oh so sweet in his mouth and it wasn't no time till it lands down into his belly into his stomach now the reason of course that God wanted this book revealed was because of the contents that was in the book so what was it well it was a love story it was a story of redemption it was a story of manifestation it was a story of Life Death a story of sin it had so many different things in the book in each age there would be a certain allocation of that word that would be given to people on the Earth the elect of God would be gerti by the opening of that word it would pull them others would come around for a while and come around for a season and then they would finally realize this is not for me this is not who I am and then they would begin to find fault and they would pull this way and pull that way and pull that way but to the elect of God it was the spirit of God calling to them because when you recognize the word of God is Eagle food then you left the other thing and you actually heard from your theophany so your theophany in the sixth Dimension now don't ask me to explain it because I can't but your theophonic is a part of you that you've not yet seen a part of you you've not yet known it's an attribute of God that is your body in a spiritual sense you bypassed it you didn't go through it like in the beginning we should have but you bypassed it but yet it's still your identity always was always will be and somehow when the message of the hour begins to sink up with your soul God allows your theophany to present to you a link an identification of the message of the hour and you actually not hearing just from the message but you're actually hearing from your theophany now you see why that others cannot ever really truly identify from the soul with the message of the hour is because they have no theophany waiting in the sixth dimension that actually ties them to the revealed word of the hour so the contents of what's in the book is what's so important for God to get so it's the title deed to everything that Adam had it's the title deed to everything Adam was and everything we were supposed to be before the fall and then it was sealed up after the fall and the book does not go back into a library in heaven somewhere but goes into the hand of almighty God now remember God the Eternal as the Hebrew actually identifies him it actually calls him the Eternal the Eternal so the Eternal even thy God it is him this is the name by which he made him manifest himself manifest to Abraham and this is what the Jews call him by so the Eternal had this Within himself and he knew that it would come to pass and there was nothing that would ever stop it but there's this long process by which he will bring the inhabitants of the earth whose names are on the Lamb's Book of Life he will bring them back to where they will be able to take the book for their life he will find them in such chaos he will find them in such utter distress and they will feel like there is no hope and the ray of life will begin to break around their life and they will know something supernatural has happened to them and it's link them somehow to God himself not not a church not a preacher not a feeling not an emotion but somehow it's something beyond all of that all that comes with it aren't you glad that it does now you see whenever uh someone Embraces the revealed word of the hour it's been in every age but when Reve whenever the reveal word of this hour has actually struck their soul and it becomes what they think what they say is open I like to watch people whenever they say they've embraced it and I like to see what they do with the revealed word but I also like to watch and see what do they do with the Bible how do they relate the reveal word of the hour to the Bible do they think that the Bible is no longer needed do they think that the Bible is just something that we no longer really reference to that much because we don't really need it anymore well that lets me know whether they're a preacher or whoever they are that the revealed word has not really come open to that individual because when it come open to our prophet he did not want to replace the Bible with and take his books and just say now you no longer need the Bible at all but he would always po us himself back to the holy scriptures is that right so if that's what it done to him then I'm convinc it will do the same thing to you and I so instead of the Bible becoming just a book that we used to need and we used to read and it it gathers dust somewhere in a in a bookshelf I believe if that same thing happen to him will happen to us it will do the exact same thing and what it did did to him was it never put him to where that you find brother brandham carrying his books after the seals come open to the pull pit and him reading texts out of his books praise the Lord but I find him packing his Bible still there they' still got his Bibles of course you've seen them any of you that's been there and you've seen his Bible you can see the notes that we have back here in the library and the in the glass case there that they're trading out for us from time to time and what what you will see is that it opens up with a title and there will always be a scripture right up on top and brother bam does not start out was one of his quotes and brother Brenham does not just have quote after quote after quote of himself and absolutely leaves out Isaiah Jeremiah Zachariah Zephaniah habac Malachi Matthew Mark Luke and John Philippians Romans Galatians praise the Lord but what does it do actually when the seals come open to him it helped him to to see that the Bible itself actually became a new book now notice it's not a different translation now we're living of course in the Daya where that we have many many many translations I'm not necessarily against all of them some of them I am against because they're against the original that's right but there are many of them that will come and take the Greek word and the Hebrew word and give a little further understanding than what the 1611 King James version did but yet we didn't come the opening of the seals didn't bring a William brandham version of the Bible it did not bring a message version of the Bible but what it did was it made the Bible a new book why would that be because with the opening of The Seven Seals then the contents that was in there you would read your same Bible over again but at you're reading it now under the evening light with the seals that have come open not only in Jeffersonville but in you and in your own understanding it doesn't do any good for you to read the seals and memorize the seals and know what he said on page so and so and paage so and so and paage so and so if them seals never come open to you you see God don't want you and I to grab the seal Book and know the seal book by memory and be able to quote the seal book if we've never been handed the book of our own life what good does it do us and then we go through life trying to figure out well what am I supposed to do where do I belong well I'm going over here it's pitiful how many message folks have followed this move till it kind of petered out and then they followed that move and they B blowed up and then the move went to that move and they've been from one move to another to another right inside the message y'all going to preach with a me tonight you know why it's it's evident they never found what they are looking for they're still searching brother Charlie Cox preached a message down at the church where I was at in Kentucky years ago and he entitled it still shopping and he took that how that women like to go and they shop and they go look in one dress and look in another dress and another dress and he used sister his wife you know Sister Nelly and how she loved to shop brother Charlie like a lot of us men he didn't like to shop at all and he said you know once you really get the real thing and you're looking for the right thing in the word then you're not shopping for another you've actually got what you're looking for and I don't know how you all feel tonight I'm not looking for another church age messenger I'm not looking for another Prophet I'm not looking for another preacher to come and explain what he said somebody just tell me what he said I'm looking for Ley that wants to believe what he said and live what he said and let the Lord Jesus manifest himself in our life every day so that we can be a light to this city that we live in so you can be a light to the people that you work with cuz there might still be some around here that needs to hear about this great life but as long as we focus and Satan can keep us just on the past in March of 1963 and we memorize and memorize sure memorize the seal book oh yes absolutely you'd be better off to memorize that than you would Better Homes and Garden you'd be better off to memorize that than you would tick talk and and Instagram and Facebook all that bunch of garbage you'd be better off to memorize scripture than you would a bunch of nonsense but don't stop at memorization because Revelation is not memorization and memorization is not Revelation but when if you see them seals broke open and it reveal the contents of not only the Bible but also the mystery of your life Who Am I who am I where where do I belong where do I belong in Christ where's the church that I go to who's my pastor it's really sad that a lot of folks sit under a preacher for years and still don't have a revelation of who the pastor is so they think they want to be over there and they think they want to be over there and they think they want to be over there that's really pitiful you need a revelation you need a revelation of who you are you need a revelation of who Jesus Christ is you need a revelation of your position to him that you're not Church you're not some bunch of dirt bags that's just trying to hang on you've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb you're forgiven you're washed you're Justified you're clean come on somebody well that's what God wants us to be and that's why it's so essential that the spirit of God open up to us the mystery of who me me and not only me but you it won't do you any good to say I believe brother Donnie knows who he is I believe he knows what he's supposed to do I do I do yes I'm glad I live in a present tense revelation of who I am and what I'm supposed to be doing I'm not living back 20 years ago come on church I'm not living back whenever I first come here and was over at the other building I have updated I said I have updated I am living in 2024 anybody else here with me so I've got a vision for 2024 my vision for what it was in 1987 1988 when I first come here it's not the same tonight or today oh it's different than it was you say why brother Donnie well don't you believe the message I believe it now more than I believed it then and I believe we need to preach it I believe we need to say Ament to it and I believe it needs to be made manifest in our life in a greater way than it was in the 80s don't you now watch I want you to understand whenever the prophet says this now it's hard to say this it's very hard because speaking to people who feel the same way I do and the way I have been for many years but since the opening of those Seven Seals of them Angels just behind the mountain Yonder now nowh he standing in Phoenix them Angels standing just behind the mountain Yonder this has become a new book a new book so it wasn't like that he got a new international version or say he got you know the the Living Translation it wasn't even then it wasn't even around there so he hadn't got the Benson version he had got not the the wickl version but what it was the word of God had so broke open that it become to see things in there that had never seen before now this is a man that had been preaching for decades of his life but the Bible became a new book it's the things that's been hid is being revealed as God promised in Revelation 10 he would do it and we're privileged people that God has chosen of the earth that we might see and understand these things can anybody say Amen which is not some mythical fleshly Mind of a person Tred to make it up it's the word of God made manifest proven that it's right proven not by science but by God so when the seals come open then it did not replace scripture it did not replace the Bible but it simply was more information about what the prophets had already said now remember not replacement I know you may wonder why do I keep emphasizing that because many of the doctrines that have been around the message for years have been replacement to scripture you cannot back them up by the Bible I can take my Bible and prove the doctrines of this message as a matter of fact that's what I do when I introduce the message to somebody I intentionally don't use quotes what good is to tell them what a prophet said when they don't even know really what a prophet is so what do I do I use my Bible praise the Lord when I went to CH China when I go to India different places where they never seen before I take my message of course on my laptop I took message books but I never approached it from the perspective of the message itself I was was preaching the message under the opes of the scripture so I would take the scripture and then I told brother Murphy when we get there brother Murphy let's have a question answers first service I want to see where they are I want to preach up here if they're here if they're here I don't want to preach down here I want to find out where they are and then I'll study accordingly and then I'll wrot down all the scriptures brother Murphy take it down to the office you imagine communist printers on communist computers and they're printing out scriptures from the holy word of God so I wanted everybody there to have a copy of it so we could fly cuz I had a lot of ground to cover in a few days so every one of them would be handed out a copy of that brother Bisal said he listened to it on the godhead he said I hadn't listened to it for 15 minutes I felt so sorry for the devil cuz I knew exactly what he was in for why because once we see the message of the hour we don't have to hide our Bibles we don't have to say I don't know how to back it up with a Bible I can take God's scripture and preach to you election for ordination predestination sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost water baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus come on somebody I can preach to you a Rapture I can preach to you why oh I couldn't do it years ago but the seals come open and it helped me to realize we don't need to shine our Bible we need to embrace our Bible we need to eat that word of God come on somebody say Amen now this is what happened to the prophet notice immediately the Feast of the trumpets after that the angels of the Lord appeared and told about the seven trumpets or the Seven Seals that I was to return back to Jefferson and preach the Seven Seals and if I ever said anything that was inspired it was in that there where the angel of the Lord met us and the Bible became a new Bible there it opened up and revealed all the things that the reformers and things had left out it was the complete revelation of Jesus Christ allog together new to us but perfectly exactly with I don't know about you I want a scriptural church when I like to go when I go hear a message preacher I want want to not only hear a message quoting scripture I want to hear a man that can also take scripture and message and put it together praise the Lord a man Dodges scripture that's a red flag to me perfectly exactly with the scripture that was the word which has always been I was so inspired and directed and I say Amen to that and where did the spirit of the word of God where did it Point him back to right back to the scripture because remember he had preached for years and years that that white horse rider was the Lord Jesus yeah he preached for years and years and when he got ready to preach the first seal that first day when he was studying and he said I was ready to make a horrible mistake what was that mistake preaching it the same way he had preached it for years and he opened the scripture and had read that for years and read about that white horse and said it was the Lord Jesus conquering forth can you imagine how that man felt when the angel come the first day and opened up that first seal and when he saw it there by vision and he looked at that white horse and that Rider and he thought oh my God that's not Jesus it's the Antichrist Jack I wonder how he felt you don't know what it's like is the preacher to realize you said something wrong it's like oh Lord have mercy I can't believe I said that oh no I said that wrong you imagine him realizing that he preached that years he preached it wrong but I can follow a man like this that he can get in the pull pit and admit that he preached it wrong praise the Lord somebody oh Hallelujah now watch so it become a new book and when it did he had to change some of the things that he preached I realize some of the message folks don't like it going this way but he used to believe and preach that leprosy was contagious he used to believe and preach that Mary produced an egg come on now I can rattle a bunch of them off of you you go to challenge them in your spirit don't do it don't do it why can't people change with him because they make a God out of it you want to make him infallible when you do that you're going exactly contrary to what he taught praise the Lord so it was a an open book a new book not a replacement now but a new book so the seals look different justification looked different we preach justification but not exactly like Luther did we preached sanctification we'll hear a little bit about this weekend Lord Brother but not exactly like the Methodist did that plus we preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the restoration of gifts but not exactly like Aza street right amen come on somebody but we preach that and we believe that but how do I preach justification now I preach justification now with the light of the invisible Union which was in November 1965 at Jack Morris that you're not just Justified but you never done it in the first place you see Luther couldn't preach justification like that why the seals had not come open yet wesle they could only preach the sanctification of the natural realm I want to pre to you Lord will in this weekend of two stages of sanctification the Divine and the natural Wesley could not preach it that way the pentecostes could preach the gifts yes they did I was one of them I know so they could preach it I preached them years ago but I preach them different now I preach them with a line of an open book come on somebody and they but oh yeah I believed in gifts had gifts seen gifts manifested I've seen all the mess that went with it but I believe with all of my heart if we will operate it the way we we've been taught under the evening light there will not be division there will not be a bunch of nonsense it won't be hit and miss and hit and miss I believe if we do it the way the Holy Ghost wants it done it will be exactly right every time not one out of five not one out of a 100 but it will be right every time and the church [Applause] said I want you to notice now let's do a little PR well there was two great men that God used in a Reformation time for the Jews one of them was Ezra and the other was Nehemiah and the people had been without the word the the ministry the priesthood had started marrying idolatrous women the Levites didn't even do service no more they went out bought a field and was plowing and farming and this and that the house of God lay in Ruins and the word had become closed they wasn't even sure what God wanted anymore everything was such a gray area the reason it's gray is because you don't have the right light so when Ezra opened the book now remember it was the book of the law which contained Thou shalt and thou shalt not and all of that and but the time that Ezra come along the five books of Moses were a thousand years old a thousand years old read with me in Nehemiah chapter 8 verse5 and Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people they had built him a Pulpit and when he opened it all the people stood up if we've got to visit us here tonight you may wonder why whenever we read the scripture around here that everybody stands well this is part of the reason why we figure we owe an allegiance to the open word now when the people stand up notice what this does now to Ezra and Ezra bless the Lord the great God and all the people sat there and nodded their [Music] heads now notice so he says something and then the people said amen all the people answered amen y'all only said hi for what they said they said amen amen amen amen with lifting up their hands and bow their heads wow now Lord notice what this book being opened is doing to these people it's bringing a response now they don't have the Holy Ghost of course no new births but the word of God that is there and the spirit or the anointing that's being released which is the restoration of the word restoration of worship restoration of thetical priesthood restoration of the temple the wall so on and so on and there's a spirit of Revival that's among them oh my and they bowed their heads and Worship the Lord with their faces to the ground when the book come open now go with me to the Book of Luke chapter 4 now we have the god of Israel on the earth and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day wow what a strange custom Jesus had he went to church how weird is that if the Lord Jesus felt like he needed to go to church so you see Jesus didn't show up once over 14 years it was actually his custom to go to church regularly well praise the Lord he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath's day and stood up for it to read and there was delivered unto him the book of Isaias and when he had opened the book he found the place so the book is opened but that within itself is not enough he's looking for something in particular now he could have turned over and said in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the waters and said let there be light and there was light and on and on and on and on it could have said that but actually the spirit that was on him directed him to the word of that day hallelujah hallelujah I love to preach the Bible stories but I'm going to tell you right now preaching about little David and his slang ain't going to put you in no Rapture preaching about Moses up on Mount Mariah or Abraham on Mount Mariah and Moses on Nebo and preaching the same Bible stories has been preached for the last thousands of years without the evening light now you run them Bible stories through the evening light and it will Enlighten you in a way that you ain't never seen David sang before but you see when you still try to preach the same Bible stories under the Baptist anointing or under the Pentecostal anointing come on somebody or under you know your own personal agenda it will never produce it but let the anointing of the end time preach about little David you get the seals out of him you get the thunders out of him you get the opening of the book out of him why takes the same Bible and actually makes it a new book so it makes David look different than the way I used to preach him I used to preach some of these same things back Y in Pentecost but it was under a different light under a different anointing but now I can preach it and whenever I do I say oh my Lord where in the world was all that laying it was laying there all the time but the book has now become open and helped me to see further than what I ever saw before but I don't want to just see David different I don't want to just see Solomon different I want to see me different I want to see you different I want brother skip for us to be able to see ourselves in that open book instead of looking so much at our humanity and getting so tied up on our old flesh and our old weaknesses and many you focus more on that than you do you n birth I told you years ago and it still stands true today one of the greatest challenges a bride's going to have in the last day is believe what you know about yourself or taking what God knows about you and the way God looks at you which one are you going to believe you going to be to believe the report of your flesh you going to believe the report of your weakness or are you going to believe the report of the word I'm an overcomer I am called in this Hallelujah I am Unstoppable I was ordained before the foundation of the world and I will be there by the grace of God in spite of [Applause] myself so he opens the book which a been a scroll and you imagine was just standing up there they're waiting and they're waiting and they're waiting what's he doing he's looking for himself and he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord it's upon Moses the spirit of the Lord is upon Joshua the spirit of God came on David the spirit was on John the Baptist he was looking for where it was written about himself the spirit of the Lord is upon can you say it sir the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed Ed now you see there's this element about us that we say oh my goodness ain't that bragging ain't that bragging about about us no you didn't do that you didn't put the spirit on you you didn't fill yourself with the Holy Ghost God did that you're not bragging on what you've done you're bragging on what he did you wasn't even worthy of the Holy Ghost I wasn't either the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives the recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised and could have said me at every one of those stops there me me me me to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and He close the book and he gave it to the minister and set down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him now he had his bar mitzvah whenever he turned 12 years old his first time to read the Torah so he had already done this as a wee boy but now this is the age of 33 the age at which a priest would stand and start ministering so as a little boy stood there and he would read the Torah and made comment maybe some of them said I remember him that's Jesus bar Joseph barment son Jesus the son of Jo they say he's illegitimate oh they say you know he's wory I know I know I know all that but I I remember as a we boy I just remember said Moses said Isaiah said Jeremiah said said yeah ain't that the same little boy that was over in the temple when his mama lost him and went over boy they said he is over preaching about Moses he's preaching about Jeremiah you know why he's preaching about them cuz he couldn't read this scripture he couldn't read this scripture right here when he was a boy of 12 years old and said this day this scripture is fullfilled so he had to preach about Moses and Jeremiah and Ezekiel so all the eyes of the people fastened on him as he going to preach about Moses he he going to preach about Daniel or about David is slang Little David play on your harp hallelujah hallelujah Little David play on your heart hallelujah boy if he goes to talking about David my goodness I'm going to shout I'm going but all of them sit and look at him real Earnest like y'all looking midut and he began to say unto them this day Lord God this scripture this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears now he couldn't say this at 12 years old as a matter of fact he couldn't say it before he got baptized he couldn't say it when he was 18 couldn't say it when he was 20 but the father had to come in him we stood in that little community of Nazareth not long ago and they had built a little replica of a synagogue the little village where it was there and it just just awesome just incredible place no electrical wires you know no you know no no civilization just Stone paths and and little Gardens and Vats and Winery and and things like that look no doubt the way it would have looked very similar 2,000 years ago and then where they thought that that the little synagogue or the little place would have been and then not too far from where the synagogue was there was a precipice a place real high cuz remember when he said some of these words they took him to that place and they was going to shove him over amen yes they were because the devil can't stand it when you see yourself in the word praise God so now Jesus is able to identify himself from the open word but with it all the sweetness of standing there and the Revelation just permeating his being but the bitterness come a few minutes after this and they set their goal from that time on to kill him why he identified himself in the Bible why he he he's letting on like that was him it was the prophet of God tells us the same scripture that spoke about the groom prophesies about the bride too so then what about our title deed what what do we get what what does salvation do for us forgives us for our sins cleanses us you know makes us love people all that but I'm I'm talking about what what do I get what do do you get whenever my mom and daddy passed and Mama passed first and then Daddy and uh you've heard me tell it before that we thought my brother Jamie was the the executive of the will so we all gathered there at the little Double Wide Trailer where Mom and Daddy lived and Jamie gets their little box out about that big that has important documents in it and he he opens it up and he drags the wheel out and he reads it he says Donnie you're the executive I said what that's what it says you're the executive I'd heard that word before but I had no clue what I supposed to do so I started researching Now by that time of course I was living in Tennessee so I had to pull up the laws of Kentucky in order to understand I begin to read that and there was elements about it that frightened me because if I didn't do it exactly right I could get in trouble so I wanted to study and I wanted to search and I wanted to know what my responsibility was now if I wish to I could have took a portion out of what little bit Mom and Daddy had they never didn't have much in this life no way but what little bit they had I could have took an extra portion out of that because I was the executive but I personally didn't feel like that I should do that I get that from my big brother him being the firstborn he could have had a double portion that's right but instead he said I want to share everything that I get on equal terms with the rest of the family praise be to God so he wants to give us healing and deliverance he wants to give us a position in the body if he wants me to have it why shouldn't I take it I never had a one of my brothers and sisters to argue with me and say now Donnie it ain't right it ain't right oh there's a couple of them Harry you know mentioned about it you ought to take this or you ought to take that no I don't want to do that I I don't I don't want to do that you know I I I want you all to have that that part of it too let's just share it but I didn't know what to do so I had to study what do I do what do I do I had to go before the judge i' never been before the a judge in my life I sat there for hours listening to people get charged with this and that and the other there was a man that had broke his bail and his bond got right up before me that judge let him have it I'm telling you what he my he lowed the boom on that old boy and then then he said Mr Reagan and I walk up there and I'm shaking and he said so sorry to hear about the passing of your parents I'm sorry that we have to meet under these situations and I realized it depends on what terms you stand before the judge on Amen his tone of voice you see for those who stand before the Lord God at the white throne they will hear no mercy they will hear no voice of pity but when you and I stand before the Lord Jesus to get our reward we will not hear anger we will not hear a vengeful voice that ready to whip us and ready to send us to hell why it's the terms that we meet him on we're meeting him on the status that we are brothers so he won't look at us through Angry Eyes of wrath and judgment he won't even look at us through the pillar of fire that would be the wrath of God he will look at us through the love which pulsates from his own being and when he looks out he sees brothers and sisters that are part of the family of God oh my don't you want to meet him that wayen when I begin to read what I had to do and then I had to contact these people and I had to post something in the newspaper paper if there's any outstanding bills and I had to do this and I had to make a big gigantic checklist and check everything off to make sure had to contact the IRS and had to contact this and contact that oh my goodness I got so tired of doing it all why did I have to do all that I was still pastoring you at the time of course I've still got to do this and I've got to make this phone call I didn't live in Kentucky I lived here so it wasn't an easy thing for me to do but I got to thinking about my Lord he didn't live down here he lived in heaven but what did he do he said I'm willing to forsake heaven right now I'm willing to leave the praise of angels and go down to the cursings of man I'm willing to leave a a beautiful perfect place and I'm going to go down there they're going to hate me they're going to despise me but I'm going to stay there till I get the job done and he did he went to the Cross he paid the price and he bought the book and he ascended up in the resurrection raised for our justification and has been there for 2,000 years but still the book B was held in the hands of almighty God how many appreciates the cross tonight how many appreciates the blood how many appreciates the resurrection and yet the cross nor the blood nor the resurrection open the Seven Seals but Christ himself must slip back down at the end time at the revealing of the son of man he had to come back down Hallelujah and take that book in order to open up who you were the cross pointed to your way back across the ASM The Blood Washed you and cleansed you and made a way for the Holy Ghost to come in you but you still didn't know who you was as I said the other night Paul never preached the Seven Seals show me one place he ever mentioned the word show me one time Paul ever mentioned the word seven Thunder it was not needed for their age they were the alpha bride but I'll tell you who needed the opening of The Seven Seals the Omega bride lucer did not need it Wesley did not need it but who needed it it was the resurrection phase we are the resurrection phase the Rapture stage don't you see Paul is waiting on us Luther is waiting on us and the revelation of this end time will Rapture the entire church body Hallelujah for 2,000 years of church ages they are all waiting on us hang on Paul hang on Paul we're coming hold on Peter we're coming and we will cause the resurrection of the [Applause] Dead watch this in the breach now am I the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner almighty God the title deed to the Earth to eternal life when Adam forth it then Satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to its original owner God himself we're going to find in just a minute there he sits on the throne with it in his hand the title deed oh that makes me fear religious the title deed to eternal life Abstract title deed to eternal life you see for the brothers in this message who the seals have broke open to them they Don't Preach eternal life in a denominational perspective cuz a denominational perspective is God gives you something that was never yours and they preach adoption like this that you was like out of an orphanage somewhere and he come by and felt sorry for you and he adopted you into your family that ain't the way we preach adoption why we preach it through the opening of The Seven Seals so eternal life to us is not us getting something that we was not air to oh Hallelujah it was something that was already ours that's why the prophet could come and say and it chok some of the message people today you would saved on no certain day you always was saved it was yours oh Hallelujah before there was ever a World before there's ever a star or a speck of dust out there in the cosmic life it was you when you was identified with that and he goes on to say in streetport there's only one form of eternal life and that was you you don't remember it but you were there I can't preach eternal life the way I did that in Pentecost because back under I preached at the that you could have it but you could lose it and you could get it and then you could lose it I don't know how many times people in Pentecost got the Holy Ghost over and over and over and over again every Revival I'd go preach in some places that get the same Holy Ghost again and again I don't preach it that way no more children I preach once you get it in your soul your soul is sealed to the day of your Redemption and there ain't no turning back because that desire has done been annihilated in out of you I preach the Holy Ghost but I preach it through the opening of the word of God the title deed to eternal life Abstract title deed to eternal life and Adam forfeited for wisdom instead of faith it went back into the hands of the owner almighty God what a great thing all right waiting what's it doing in the hands of God waiting for for Redemption claims now keep in your mind this was not consummated at the cross the book was still in his hands look at this sermon here the title of it the breach now remember he opens this series with God in Simplicity and then the breach now watch this is the scene people might have thought he was just laying out of drama do you understand all of time had merged together it is now standing at this very point in time of the scripture of Revelation 5 It's Not Just An Occurrence well it was a good type it was not a type the lamb had the book in his hands in March of 63 he couldn't give it to Luci he was a reformer not a prophet he couldn't give it to Wesley he couldn't give it to that black man that received the understanding about the restoration of gifts on isusa street he had to give it to Elijah and there was the lamb what's it waiting for so the book had been there for these 2,000 years after the work of the Cross 2,000 years years after the resurrection it's it's waiting waiting for what redemption's claim redemption's claim so who who can get it only the Redeemer John couldn't go take that book till after the lamb took it you understand brother R could not take that book The Lamb took it first and gave him the open revelation of what was in the the contents the lamb took it and then come and told John take it so what the prophet had to do the prophet had to come and take it in order to Feast on that setting the presence of God and each Angel come each day making known to him the Revelation which was made only to known to thems and then he comes and preaches from that open book and what he finds out what he preaches himself and you watch him he goes back and he preaches Joseph he's going back and preaches a bunch of them things that he' already preached before for but now he's preaching with a different slant what was the slant the book had come open and he could see things about him he had never seen before oh praise God waiting for Redemption claim he made a way of redemption he made a way back and someday the Redeemer is to take it back waiting for Redemption claims what is the book of redemption this titled deed abstract deed you say abstract what does an abstract D mean what is it what's the meaning of it it means it searched all the way back to the beginning sir it's Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve oh my what that ought to do to a born- again Christian it's legal possession to the abstract deed titled deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost then he says what of it Brethren now I ask you do you figure from the way most of us reacted to that statement tonight that I just read most of us need a revelation of it so when that abstract is made clear to your life it's legal possession of the abstract title D of eternal life means that you notice he ain't pointing to himself now now don't misunderstand me he's not even pointing to the possession of the Lord Jesus the opening of the seals in this day is not just about what Jesus got it's what you get notice in the Easter seal when the spirit of God comes upon you and you truly are one of God's attributes that he spoke of now if you're not you'll wonder and flustra and run here and there and everything else and never come to the knowledge of the truth but if you're one of those the old things are passed away right quick see and you become new and the Plan of Salvation is finished you're ready to obey every word that God ever spoke of you of you God ever spoke of you what brother brandham fulfilled is not my part I can't be what brother Ron is I can't be what brother Tim is I I can't be what brother Wayne Lawson is brother Daryl I want to find the words that speak about me don't you I want to find Lord what what what does the word say about me I want to find the place in the scripture that I can stand before you and read from the word and say to you as my sheep this day this scripture is fulfilled before your eyes you're ready to obey every word that God spoke of you see for you to do you're submissive to his word the contract exactly the abstract to the contract the title deed belongs to you the debts are all paid it's all struck off as it was on the day of Pentecost like the pent costal experience today and the coming of the Holy Ghost in the last days is Promised it's like the abstract to a title deed now you can get a title or you can get a title to a place but you still don't say it's yours now some of these titled people here brother Rob and brother Larry and brother Jim these other people that that's what they do so they could get up here and really explain to you how that all works and you might have that and say oh yes it's mine but somebody else might have a claim way back you know 50 years ago on that you build your nice house on top of it and somebody shows up at your door and say I've got a claim on this property right here oh no there ain't no way in the world I just paid $400,000 to get this house bill well I really appreciate it that's awful nice of you when can I move in now you see if they have got a legal claim on that you'll either have to buy them out you will have to give them your house who knows exactly what it'll be that's why friends that many people are showing up that they've got a claim against them when they say oh I'm born again I got the Holy Ghost yeah in about five years they out here running around doing this and that and the other same thing they done before come on don't get quiet on me you know why the devil showed up at their door and said I got a claim on you you still want to smoke him cigarettes I've got a claim on you you still want that fifth of whiskey I've got a claim on you you're still wanting that other woman come on somebody but whenever the Devil comes knocking on your door whenever you've got the abstract to the title D and say you was born a sinner you say yeah I was but I ain't no more yeah you used to like to drink yeah devil I agree with you I used to like it but I don't want to drink no more I'm drinking new wine I'm drunk on the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't want to run around no more I don't want to steal no more I don't want to lie no more Hallelujah why because you are standing there with the abstract two your title and you can pick your finger in the devil's face and say leave leave leave my property get out of my house Hallelujah why the Holy Ghost is your abstract to your [Applause] title oh somebody B way back Yonder could could come in uhhuh and put a claim but when you get an abstract that shows everything that's ever against it a struck off do you honestly think the bank that we borrowed money to build this building with we had a lot of it I've been putting back for a long time but we did have to borrow some do you think they would want to invest on a property they Wen sure about so they checked out the title they checked out the abstract they've done a title search which I was okay with anyway cuz I didn't want to tie a bunch of money up in it and somebody else come in and claim it I ain't scared of God doing a title search on me are you I ain't scared to sat in the preach oh people say oh Lord have mercy don't get around brother so and so cuz the Lord tells him stuff the Lord tells him stuff my Lord if you're scared to death to get around a preacher it shows you ain't ready for no Rapture you ought to live so close to God that if a man told you what you had for breakfast midnight snack could tell you what your blood pressure is and tell you everything else about you that shouldn't scare you you should have such a walk with God you can say glory to God I'm ready to go I ain't got nothing to hide I ain't got nothing in the closet I ain't coming out of the closet I ain't got nothing in the closet I'm ashamed of come on somebody because I've done got the abstract to my title de I can look the devil right Square in the eye and say show me where I'm a sinner convince me of my sin you [Applause] devil when you get an abstract it shows that everything that's ever against you is struck off Plum back from the foundation and when a man has said he believed the word then when the Holy Spirit comes it's the abstract to the title don't you see what a lot of message people have done they've taken the message books and tapes and message churches and doctrines and so on and they've made that their title and they try to overcome just from the title only and they've got all the terms and all the cliches and they're quoting the title the title the title the title but if you've not received that Holy Ghost yourself in your soul to seal that title oh when the Holy Spirit comes it is the abstract to the title that gives you permission when you have that abstracted every bit of that belongs to you and everything is on it belongs to you that gives you the ab ract when the Holy Ghost comes upon this tital deed that God saw back Yonder before the foundation of the world praise be to God so when you heard from your theophany there was an Awakening of the Jean seed on the inside a quickening of that tidal portion which God put in you which is part of your identification before the foundation of the world so God saw that then he send the Holy Ghost being the abstract down upon that little deposit oh Lord have mercy Hallelujah that's why the devil can't talk real bride out of this message the only people that a lot of these people have been able to talk out of these message are intellectual Believers oh I'm glad I'm out of the cult I'm glad I left this I'm glad I left that I'm glad you left two you old unbeliever yeah get out of our way we're going on with God if somebody can put you in it some somebody can take you out if somebody can talk you into it somebody can talk you out but if God baptizes you into this Hallelujah and God gives you the abstract to the title de there ain't enough devils in Hell there ain't enough YouTube videos there ain't enough people saying well I'm free no you ain't you're bound by that devil there ain't enough nothing to get you out of his mind and his thoughts that gives us the abstract when the Holy Ghost comes upon this title deed that God saw back Yonder before the foundation of the world and put its name on The Book of Life but was born through a man and woman and subject to sin and guilty of sin but when I believed on it I received the deed but when the Holy Ghost come it was the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it my father done it my grandmother done it glory to God hallelujah you know what I'm talking about every one of us I don't care what our name is what our race is what our culture is we come to to God with a lot of garbage and a lot of baggage and it wasn't just what you done it's what your mama done what your daddy done what your uncle done what you ain't done what your grandpa done but God said if you come to me and let me birth your soul I'll clear you back P to the foundation of the world how will oh my don't you understand if he can ever get you oh Lord have mercy me if he can ever get you back under then there is no more identity that you was ever lost God don't ever remember you being lost the only thing he remembers about you is you are a son of God you are a daughter of God God don't remember you being a drunk God don't remember you being a liar God don't remember you being an adulterer all he remembers about you here you were in his seeking before the foundation of the world and nothing can p you about of his care but when the abstract has come it's struck off amitt at everything I'm an abstract holder than amen and as sure as the spirit that raised Christ from the dead I have an abstract that I'm a part of that body with the abstract of the Holy Ghost making that body of the word live out just exactly like it did in him as he promised in the last day the abstract all my sins are struck out all your sins are struck out by the blood of Jesus Christ to the tital deed that God give me by Grace by forign knowledge well glory to God let me read a couple more verses in Nehemiah we'll close oh watch's the parallel also we made an ordinances for us to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekele for the service of the House of our God for the shoe bread for the continual meat offering now notice what's happening once the book is open they didn't even know they're supposed to do all this stuff but the minister in the Pulpit was standing up there telling them what they need to do how in the world can preachers expect people to grow if they stand up and Dodge every issue in the age we're living in I don't know where going to expect homosexual to become converted if we got peace free preacher standing there behind the bullpit and we'll never even tell them it's a sin well come on [Applause] somebody so this is what the opening of the book did to them for the continual burnt offering of the sabbaths for the new Moons for the the set Feast for the holy things for the sin offerings to make an atonement man a lot of that book could really come open at it from the people who didn't know nothing about how to worship God they learned all this in a little bit had good pastor a good pastor that's teaching the word yes sir for the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the Corn of the new wine and the oil oh yeah they had a little bit of that stimulation Revelation didn't they unto the chambers where are the vessels of the sanctuary and the priests that Minister and the porters and singers well I want you to Reen this and we will not forsake the house of our God these folks had such a Revival they started wanting to go to church I mean like on a regular basis yeah Y is a real Revival from God sure his work we will not forsake the house of our God forsake to leave loose to depart from Leave Behind let alone abandon neglect to be deserted let's Stand Together Hebrews chapter 10 verse 25 not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some is well praise the Lord the word forsaking leave abandoned desert leave and Straits leave helpless totally abandoned utterly forsaken as a manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much

me the Lord has healed me but you know what I didn't wait to preach to you till I got healed I preached to you when my feet was hurting so bad I couldn't hardly walk I wanted to make a sacrifice to my God I don't want to just praise him when I'm feeling good I don't want to just come to church and I'm feeling good I want to come when I'm not feeling so good I want to preach and I'm not feeling so good I want to praise him when I'm not feeling so good because I I am a worshiper I worship when it's cold I worship when it's hot I worship when it's tight I worship and everybody else is worshiping I worship and ain't nobody else worshiping cuz I'm a [Applause] worshiper praise the Lord praise the Lord if the Lord God can pass by this way tonight and open our understanding and maybe you can find something that's needful for you you're sick go to James 5:14 go to Mark 16 go to First Peter 2 go to Isaiah go to them scriptures in the word that talks about healing and deliverance put your finger on that and read that and say daddy that's me that's my promise and I'm going to do like Abraham did oh I wish every time we got sick and we got needy it'd come instantly but it don't always does it I told her yesterday I said you remember last year this time you remember what a shape I was in I went to Louisiana and preached the youth kept down know one of the deacons come and took the in insoles out of his shoes to try to put in my shoes to give me a little Comfort where I could be able to stand I laid that pillar right there of stone I was up about 2T High the day I left I barely made it to the truck Carol when I got home Carol had to come outside and help me walk in the house you know what I done come back the next day laid Mor Stone next time I climbed in the pull pit which was at the Holiday end I couldn't hard even stand but I learned a long time ago if he can Bluff you he he will Bluff you and remember you're dealing with the king of Bluffs so you better have the goods so whatever you're dealing with tonight high blood pressure low blood pressure as a son or daughter of God claim your rights I'm a Believer by his stripes I'm Healed find that in the word and say that's me this day this scripture is going to be fulfilled then brother Donny what do I do do what Abraham done he watered that promise every day with praise amen and God took his praise and turned it into water and every time he had praised the Lord thank you Lord I'm a father thank you Lord Sarah's a mother thank you Lord I'm Healed thank you we're going to be able to bring forth this baby God just turned that praise right into water and it was just water in that seat that's what it'll do for you just praise him but if I don't feel no better just add more water maybe it just needs more water oh what if I drowned it don't worry God will take care of that just go ahead and add the praise to it and God will bring forth your crop and it's new season let's bow is together praise the Lord oh Father God thank you for your mercy to us Jesus what a blessed people we are in this last day to live in this end time we can see the wheels of Prophecy turning so fast Lord as I read the other day the words that Putin said Britain talking about sending maybe some soldiers to Ukraine some of the other European nations considering it's offending F-16 Fighters and so on Putin got before his cabinets and warned the west and told them if they did the world could come to an end because he would send nuclear bombs as I read that I just laughed I thought you level you you ain't got enough power to bring this world to an end but we can see it all Gathering we can see Israel lord they're the ones that's been attacked and yet the media attacks them every day yeah the UN attacks them constantly it's easy to see how they parallel between the bride it seemed like no matter what the bride does she's always criticized run down hated preachers around this message that don't really even preach it they can get by with about anything and people will make excuse for him it beats all I've ever seen and a true man of God I don't care how he lives how he walks and what he does everybody in their brother hates him but that's the way it's supposed to be oh Lord God we're not asking to make it easy on us we're asking you make us strong make me strong God make me gallent help me father that I can act Royal as a king but with servitude as a priest and I'll roar like a lion and I'll fight with everything within me oh Jesus help us as the people of God may we find that place which was written of us hallelujah hallelujah as you Lord God spoke to me last year I was going through a terrible thing not knowing which way to go not knowing what to do exactly but I remember your words Lord God you hold your peace and I will fight for you it takes your spirit to help us sometimes we're supposed to fight and you are know andest to do it other times we're to hold our peace and let you fight so it takes the spirit of God to lead us when it's our time to Roar and when it's our time to hold our peace you rebuke the Pharisees you call them names you preached you hollered whenever you were here but when you stood before Pilate you didn't open your mouth so there's a time to scream forth and there there's a time to hold our peace and forgive teach us Lord to be led by your spirit may we find the place that is written of us oh God I wonder how many with me in this building those of you that are streaming you just raise your hand to the Lord Lord I want I want to find my place I don't want to just find it in Word of Life Church I want to find it in the word I want to find it in Christ if I haven't arrived yet let me find it let me find it Lord praise God would you just raise your hands to God both of mine are up I believe I'm in my position but who knows God may change the strategy of my my life in a week or two or three I might have to go in a different direction you never know you never know what God has on his mind but I just want to be sensitive to following I don't want to be tricked either as a leader it's one of the most dangerous things in your life when you go to making a profound decision Satan can impress upon you and convince you that it's God as a leader it can be so treacherous you have to wait make sure wait make sure check it by the word look back and forth back and forth you husbands you need to realize that as well when you make decisions pertaining to your home your family God will hold you responsible Brothers we need him like never before Oh Hallelujah can we pray right now oh lamb who opened the book and tore off the Seven Seals and when the first seal was broke there went forth a symbol a white horse with a rider a bow with no airs symbols it laid there for 2,000 years years people guessed at it pondered wondered but when the seal was opened Revelation formed to your Prophet down on the earth so here appears this Angel and he comes down on the seventh angel is on the earth at the time of that coming Lord God May Word of Life realize Revelation 101 has already happened it was a secret Advent of our lover coming to the Earth to bring the tital deed to loose us from all those old marriages because this is the age of the Rapture praise God you had to sneak down the world didn't know it as it was in the days of Sodom thus will it be in the days when the son of man will be revealed then in verse 32 in that 17th chapter of Luke when you were speaking there then after talking about the son of man then you said these profound words remember Lot's wife so after the revealing of the son of man we are to remember Lot's wife for it was after the son of man Elohim came down to Abraham an angel come and brought a message they turned of course and walked away from that truth compromise went into Sodom you never did tell us to remember Sarah or to remember Rebecca or to remember Rachel or to remember some of the Old Testament prophetes but you told us to remember Lot's wife so truly we are living in the day when Lot's wife is turning away from the light of the day and she will also get a body change cuz once they walk away from this word they start piercing their ears their nose dressing different dressing ungodly some of them turning into homosexuals once they walk away from this word they're getting their body Chang oh Lord God we don't want to be turned to Salt we want to be turned into eternal life we don't want to be turned into salt Lord I want to be turned back to a young man not salt so if we walk away from this end time message of Malachi 4 we will also be changed oh yeah we've seen them as they've walked away from it preachers and all we've seen what they become former preachers I seen a picture a couple years ago former preacher the message sent with a beer in his hand former message preacher but now free yeah getting their body changed and their mind turned over to reprobates oh Jesus won't you pass by this way tonight Lord we thank you for every book every tape that you've given us to the prophet's message but Lord God we also recognize we must have the Holy Ghost in our souls the books and tapes alone won't do it even the prophet told us oh brother random I believe every word you said he said that's just being able to read just being able to read but take the book of our Liv Lord tear the seals off reveal what needs to be revealed take us back to the foundation and clear it praise God that we can stand and say I want was lost but now I'm found was blind but now pick the right key where were there the sins we were wretched few years ago some of you ladies would look in your closet you would pick out which minis skirt you was going to wear or your favorite pair of pants some of you Brothers you couldn't hardly wait for warm weather to comeing so you could pick out your favorite shorts and show them ugly legs of yours now you can't hardly wait for spring to come so you can change your long pants your sisters don't look for manyi dresses no more you don't look to go to your favorite hairdresser so she can cut your hair off you don't stop by the liquor store to have a little fright in that drink why he took your book and tore the seals off remember when the mysteries of the seals were it was revealed it didn't just reveal the lamb it also revealed the Antichrist that's what that's what people don't want to see about their own life they want to see that Darkness about their own life and the short pits shortcomings and pitfalls of their own life but when the seals come open it also reveal that but we're not here tonight to focus on all that part let's just get it took care of get it under with the blood and lamb take take your book and so saturate your soul with the Holy Ghost then you'll be able to find in the book as well and you'll take the book and what you'll find is when you go to reading the word that you won't just read about brother brenman there read about your mama your daddy your pastor brother Daryl the people that you admire and all that sort of thing but you'll be able to find something in there about you about you this is me so you find yourself looking in the mirror Daddy this is me don't you love him let's sing together now so when we get there that day what you reckon we'll be praising the Lord for how faithful we were how loyal we were to the cause of God how much we prayed and bore our testimony of it'll be his grace his Mercy you said Brother Don just and I got saved let me tell you something I hope you're realizing you need Grace for what you've heard tonight you need the grace of God to help you you comprehend what you've heard and help you to be able to take that book physically any of us might be able to do it but by Revelation will'll never do it if God Don't Make It Real to us but I don't believe he would preach anything to us that's not attainable for us you believe the same somebody's going to do it I figure it might as well be me sister Vicki it might as well be you brother Smith it might as well be you you young Brothers what about it it could be you your sisters where you can find the place in the word and one day you'll be able to point your finger on that scripture in John in that day you will know it's I and you and you and me and the father and you and I are one and you'll be able to put your finger on that scripture and say this day this scripture is fullfilled I and my father are one praise be to God brother Donnie are you talking about us lay people I
