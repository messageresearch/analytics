soul also amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord today are you happy to be the house of the Lord know you not that your temple your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost the Living God what a great privilege that is for us today let's turn to the Book of Daniel if you would again today chapter 7 verse 10 Daniel chapter 7 verse 10 I want to speak to you again today on the right to the god of love the right to the god of love and I'm not saying that you're worthy of this but I'm saying you have a right to it and rights are given given just like with our Bill of Rights thank God our forefathers not only wanted to establish a republic but to be able to some years later also attach what they call the Bill of Rights I'm grateful that the lord gave us not only salvation but also a Bill of Rights Daniel 7: 10 a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousand thousands which is myriads in number thousand thousands ministered unto him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were opened 1 John 4: 7 beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God now we know there's two main words in the Greeks that they used whenever they wrote the New Testament and that was agape and felo and it's not everybody that felo loves other people is born of God only the those who have the ability to Agape beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that love us Agape or agapo everyone that is love us that love us is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love so God doesn't just love but God is agape verse 16 and we have known and believed the love that God has to us God is love he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God again not he that dwelleth in human love and fio love felo love human love has jeal jealousy absolute jealousy sure it does anybody that would try to flirt with any of our brothers that are married here today with our wives or even your girlfriend you know what human love would do it would get mad at that individual if they stepped a little farther into that boundary you might threaten them now I'm warning you stay away from my wife or stay away from my girlfriend would' say now why because that boy that man felo loves his girlfriend or wife but agape love would actually pray for you it might still look at you a little bit Stern but it would pray for you because it's totally impossible for God's love to have that kind of jealousy now you realize where we're going back to when all human love will be gone amen our brothers and sisters our loved ones that are in the sixth Dimension today have no more human love it's all perfect love and I'd like to be remembered today as we pray God bless you let just bow our heads together Heavenly Father what an honor it is for us to be gathered together again today we thank you Lord Jesus that you have allowed us to be able to partake of Your Love dear father we not only want to be benefactors of that love and recipients of that love but we want to become that love and I realize what I'm asking for is a total impossibility without you helping us and actually you doing it for us because it's not in our measure of love to love with agape we just can't do it we could do it in the beginning but once we fail we lost that Inlet and we were so far away from the Fountain of the stream of purity of Love help us today I pray father speak to us your great words we ask in the name of Jesus amen God bless you you may be seated love is not simply a quality which God possesses but love is his very nature it's the essence of who he is and as I mentioned to you last Sunday that every human being on the face of the Earth even today has been able to experience an element of the love of God life breath water food all kinds of things like that that's God's love to the human race believe it or not God actually lets doctors find out cures for different diseases our Prophet told us that he prayed for doctors every day that they would be able to find a cure for cancer right you know why he did that because he loved Humanity he knew some people maybe would never be able to appropriate Faith especially Sinners and unbelievers so he loved Humanity so much that he wanted them to be able to be healed of this Dreadful terrible disease so he prayed that God would help the doctors to be able to understand it I'm grateful for the salt vaccine I'm grateful for many things that God aren't you has allowed them to be able to break into why did he do that because he loved the human race so they experienced the love of God and they don't even realize it but there's a vast difference between experiencing the love of God and having the god of love in your soul and this is where that many people try to live a Christian Life with an experience of the love of God God Saves them God reaches down oh my goodness what God does to a sinner that's lost and can raise them up by justification help them to see that they're on the way to hell as we would say and they need help and the presence of of God will come near them convict them of their sins make them ashamed and they will begin to pray and ask God to forgive them and he does and that is a touch of the love of God in their hearts some of them will go on a little further they will enter into sanctification so they'll lay aside habits unclean things things that they've done for many many years God helps him and it's his love and they feel so much better they feel cleaner in the walk with God and many of them stop right there and they never go on to be able to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is actually God himself coming into their soul now we know the apostles were good men they cast out Devils heal the sick preach the gospel yet Jesus told Peter one day when thou art converted strengthen your brethren so he preached cast out Devils healed the sick done all those wonderful things and he had not yet been converted and you can love the Lord Jesus believe the Lord Jesus actually made a trip to Calvary as we' say and still not be converted now let us go back if we can for just a few moments into the realm of Eternity there is no time there's no molecules there's no light there's no darkness no Angels no planets there's not even any time yet and out of that great essence of this being now let's watch The Prophet's teaching here let's close our eyes to our imagination for a few moments and go back in before there was anything the great Fountain of all eternity that was that Spirit of love joy that Spirit of honesty that spirit of tress in this Perfection and then out of the existence of the father went the logos which was the son so now remember there's not three gods and three different bodies but it's attributes of the same God just like you have today you've got a soul you got a spirit and you've got a body yet you're one person so it's not that your soul has a personality and your spirit is another person personality and your body is another personality but it takes all three of them to make you so here is this and we know that the Bible describes him as being God is light and then John said God is love and then the Bible says our God is a consuming fire so which one is he he's all of that but yet Paul went on to say now unto the king Eternal Immortal invisible the only wise God be Power Glory and Dominion forever so God is invisible but God wanted to become visible and tangible so God actually here we are in this great Fountain so here from the Fountain of of God comes the spirit of love so it's not just love but the spirit of love and the spirit of honesty and the spirit of tress in Perfection and then out of the existence of the father went the logos which was the son so God is giving birth to himself a son what is that son it's the visible representation of an invisible God so God started at this work of condensation now look what happens here which was the theophonic from the word th he EOS which is Theos so it is a Divine body that is not quite human but it has a human look or appearance this is actually what Adam was made in the form of in the Garden of Eden and God said let us make man in our own image after our own likeness now notice God does not say images as in plural or likenesses as in plural but image singular likeness singular so God is a spirit so man took on the spirit image of God and then man also took on the visible image of God which was sunship so God never called man a woman God never called man a daughter but God called him what he was and he was a man you follow me so far now notice then when the out of the existence of the father went the logos which was the son which was the theophany which was the body of the great Jehovah God went force in a Celestial body so what was he before this he was just totally invisible that's the logos the words spoke out of them great Fountains of life and went forth so out of this Fountain of tress out of this Fountain of Life and mercy and goodness and kindness came forth the voice of God and God allowed himself to take on a form that looked like a man yet it wasn't a man in the sense that it could die a theophany cannot die a theophany could be right here in this building this morning and yet you wouldn't be able to see it unless God would allow it to become into a visible form we're limited as far as by dimensional Vision we just can't see it there but yet it's there now notice then he says then at the coming of the Lord Jesus this body NOW Watch What Happens here whenever a person leaves and goes into that they they leave this uh part which God made for them at the beginning he he says let me go back here I was about to jump the gun on you I'm sorry which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a Celestial body that's the logos so the word spoke out of them great Fountains of life and went forth and there was a theophany which was God made into word now remember John says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and without that word of course it goes on to say was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and then he says on down through in those verses that men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil then he goes on to say about John the Baptist there was a man sent from God whose name was John he was not that light but he was sent to Bear witness of the light so God gives us the program of how that God himself came from the realm of Eternity not even visible no time no element that could be measured then God entered into the existence of his own word and then John again John 1 and one in the beginning was the word so what was before the beginning eternity eternity so in the beginning was the word in the beginning was the word the son the logos of God then God created now watch here in the same sermon then that theophany was made flesh in the person Christ Jesus so God created himself a body and it was a theophany Paul says that in 2 Corinthians 5:1 for we know if this Earthly House of this Tabernacle were disolved we have the building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens in this we desire Desiring to be clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life so it's the body that every elect member goes into when they die as we say in this life it's your identification that you are a part of deity now what in that the offy was made flesh in the person Christ Jesus it goes on down to say then we are both born again not of Flesh born again not of blood born by the spirit and that eternal spirit of love and honesty comes down to make its place in us now remember in our scripture this morning John said he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God so it leads us to believe them that there are people that can have a touch of God and they can be affected by God and then that influence can actually move away from them and then they move back into a natural carnal mortal realm and then they do whatever they want to do live the way they want to live because their residence of their soul is not in God but if they live in the land The Dwelling Place of love it is the evidence that they are born of God and not just born of Dawn and Betty Reagan or whoever your parents are now watch whenever this great Eternal in this that eternal spirit of love and honesty comes down to make its place in us then when we die from this life we go into that body if this Tabernacle is dissolved we have a theophany that we go into a body Celestial then at the coming of the Lord Jesus this body is picked up oh my from the Earth again and man made in a glorified state to live in his presence forever now this is his great program remember God was not blindsided by the devil he was not blindsided when Adam fell he knew that he would he could not make him fall and then reach down and pick him up so he could manifest himself as a redeemer a savior but he put the man on a basis by which he could fall that was on a probationary period of a time frame however long it was to where God put the man now had had man come through the theophany first he could never have fallen but he must bypass the theophany because in the theophany you know all things you see the Lord Jesus when he come to the Earth because he had been in this word formed body he knew that he had existed Ed before and when he come to this earth he brought that knowledge with him he knew he had existed he was the one who talked to Moses in the burning bush the pillar of fire is that right he was the one that came down in the fiery furnace to the Hebrew children he was the one that came down in the den of lies to Daniel he's the one when you look back to the Old Testament and see any visible manifestation of God you know you're seeing Christ that was Christ remember Moses chose to suffer the reproach of Christ but the Bible does not say Jesus because Christ was the pre-existing form before it ever become Jesus the human name I don't want to stagger you this morning but you also had a pre-existing form before you come to the Earth but it was held in the mind of God amen we're going back to that but notice if if God would have brought Adam through the theophany then Adam would have knew he existed just like we would have today we would sit here today and we would not then by faith say well I Believe by grace through through faith that I am saved anybody here ever actually seen your name in The Book of Life have you ever seen your theophany do you know by knowledge that you were there before the foundation of the world no why because were coming now on this side of the Cross and we're coming through the perpetuation made by the blood of the Lord Jesus so we believe that it is there is that right we believe that we are part of it had we have come through that theophonic body we would not be setting here today I would not be preaching because you would not need to hear a preacher in that form you could not fall so the Lord Jesus allowed himself in coming to the Earth in another cont sension of that Mighty God that he would be able to be tempted and tested and tried as another human being feel pain anxiety stress worry all that sort of thing the Bible says tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin but all the time having this knowledge that he existed before and this is why he could say not only by Revelation but by that I come forth from God and I go back to God you and I say that too by faith I honestly believe with all of my heart as we get closer to the change of our body that the revelation of God will strike the elect upon the Earth they too by revelation will be able to say I come from God I go back to God now watch this so here it's in its purest form now he said can you imagine in the Hebrew series can you imagine before there was even an earth before before there was a light before there was a star before there was anything there's a great Fountain going forth of spirit out of this Fountain came the most pure of love so all of this was spirit and spirit is invisible so love the love that we know in this life and it's true manifestation of course is made known by physical things that we do and again I want to say to each of our our church family here all that you've done during this time of the flood relief and all that my the countless hours that you've spent the brothers driving and delivering and the sister sorting through it all everything that you done it's just been remarkable and I thank you for all of that but I also realize that had it not been for people all all different places of America there's been thousands over hundreds of thousands of dollars that has been sent to our church believe me hundreds of thousands of that have been sent to our church much as it have come of course from my acquaintances and the message and different ones like that but much is it from people that do not even know us and people that have brought goods and food and things like that from 12 or 13 states the last account that I heard and what is that well that's love and and people from Georgia what would they have to do with us here in the mountains of Tennessee people from Arizona people from Kentucky people from all these different Avenues and what is that love I talked to my neighbor yesterday he owns a construction business just knew heard a little something of what we was doing and he said hey you know what we're doing the same thing you hear of any of these people I I've got all types of equipment they need help let me know please let me know I'd be glad to do what I can and you realize what is that that's a human feeling and all kinds of people would do things like that is that love yes it's love but then if you would sit down with them and tell them look good works are good but you're not going to be able to go to Heaven by your good works you've got to accept the love of God and some might say I've accepted the love of God I'm a Christian where do you go to church well no I I really don't think I need to go to church well if you have the god of love then you want to assemble yourselves together with his children because the god of love anointed Paul to say forsake not the assembling of yourselves together now if you re receive the love of God you can get saved and you want to stay home it's up to you but if you get the god of love inside of your heart you realize that love craves fellowship with other people of God that are the same economy that you're of is that right so people can love and still not truly be born again so whenever it started out though it was in this purest form the purest form of love is Spirit form now notice because there's nothing for it to come from but love now we what we call Love Today is a perverted love but just as we get an Essence listen now an essence or a little bit of that love in US it changes our whole opinion so when we start toward God not just recipients of love but we want the god of love I don't want just the love of God I want the god of love now I'm after and I hope you are I'm after that essence of that love that essence of that love now watch he said the logos this great Fountain that's the great Fountain of the spirit which had no beginning or no end this great spirit be to form in the creation in the creation so now here we go back to John 1:1 in the beginning was the word so the Spirit invisibly begin to form in a realm of Senses you know in the realm of tangibility want to become tangible and he said this great the logos the great Fountain of spirit which had no beginning or no end this great spirit be to form in the creation and the logos that went out from it was the son of God it was the only visible form that the spirit had now you don't remember it and I don't remember it but if we will ever be a part of Christ Jesus the anointed word when when Christ went out of the invisible God right there you went out too you went out with him you died with him you raised with him and now you're sitting together with him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now we were word for him so every thought that God would ever had in time when out whenever he started forming this creation of himself and it was a theophany which means a body and the body was like a man so imagine then when God formed Adam in the Garden of Eden that where did he get the idea of of fingers hands ears nose eyes two legs why not give him four legs like like an animal why why give him hands that he could reach down and pick up why give him a soul why give him what don't make him just the highest form of animal life and leave him soulless and leave him without the ability to reach out to God and hunger and crave for God he would not been in the image of God because God had a craving too and that was for people of his own kind you see a human being in Search and some of our young people of the Church of course are at that age where they're looking for a companion and we just had a wedding this week and it turned out very beautiful and and every time that I look and see that I realize that there's that longing in the young woman that longing in the young man for a companion they may have all types of friends people that they're in contact with social media but yet there's something inside of them that they want a wife or a husband if it's a lady and it's more than just emailing them it's more than texting them that's a Wonder F communication thank God for it in the day that we have it but they want and I've said it over and over again I've been marrying people since I was 18 years old that's the first couple that I married when I was just a kid so you imagine I married a bunch of them over 50 years and I use the same ceremony which is the same one the prophet used and it said will you take this person to be your lawful wedded wife will you to have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poor and sick nness and in hell to love to cherish until death do you part so it's not just to have but it's also to hold because there's something about love it wants to reach out to the other one and be able to touch them that's why it's so hard when a husband or wife will lose their companion in the Lord and his wisdom takes beyond the curtain of time and they no longer have that husband or wife that they can reach over and touch oh my goodness they know they're not woring wor about their soul they're not worrying about them not raising in the resurrection but they can no longer touch them and that love they had for them is still there in their heart and they just want to touch them to have and to hold where did we get that where did we get that God could have made the human being without that desire to touch but he made it oh Hallelujah within us to want that type of Fellowship not only with each other but also was him God wants to be touched he wants to be loved I don't know about you I long for the day when I'll be able to walk up to him and finally touch him oh Lord Jesus notice ohar that that son the logos became flesh because we were put in flesh so the logos the theophany was made flesh because we were put in flesh and the theophany the logos became flesh here among us and it was nothing else but the dwelling place for the entire fountain dwelt in him oh do you see it there it is there was the one you just take that Spirit of love the great Fountain of God pure unadulterated from that now watch how it comes down from the great source of this love now remember God is agape God is agape and then as it trickles down down to the human race watch how it can become from that it come into a perverted love then it come into a human love then it come into a sexual love then it come into other loves loves and loves and he keeps perverting down till it comes to just filth filth and this is where we are the farther we go the farther it comes from the Fountain of Purity and this is what makes us by the grace of God such a paradox for the age and time that we live in that in our souls our souls today are already recipients and we're standing right back in front of the fountain himself amen that we can love like God in other words you can pray for those who despitefully use you a real Holy Ghost Phil child of God does not look for a Time by which they can get revenge on someone who's hurt them praise the Lord now if you're that way today you need to go a little farther in the kingdom of God and the church said amen that's right now what so it keeps coming down and someday it will R wind right straight back to the original it's Eternal where lust human love passionate love all those loves will have to cease this is one thing that made the prophet so Marvel when he went beyond the curtain of time he had kept himself as a young man and would not hug on women or let women hug them him and when he goes beyond the curtain of time and these women start running to him and one after another after another is hugging him and hugging him he said anybody that knows me knows I would not allow that but the difference was he was looking at them and they were women in form and shape and he looked at himself and he was a man and he looked at the brothers as they come running to him and they were human looking human looking but they had laid aside human love sexual love is not allowed in the sixth dimension perverted love is not allowed in the sixth Dimension so this is one of the things that just overwhelmed him and he said that they touched me and they felt me and I I felt them but there was no human sensation there was no response there the way that it would normally be in a human life and he said I don't understand this oh Lord Jesus someday it'll wine right straight back to the original it's Eternal where lust human love passionate love all those loves will have to Cease the love for your lot wife is a FAL love the love for God is a gape Love A Million Miles higher every love not aapo love is perverted love which has an end and everything that has a beginning has an end and human love had a beginning don't you understand why you can never be a real consecrated Christian by S serving and loving God with your human love amen at your very best you're trying to to love God with a love which will cease to exist it will terminate that how could we love an eternal being with a time love or love that is so limited how can we love one another with a time love how it is it and you watch people as they give their heart to the Lord and as they go to serving the lord and you can watch them and see if they grow in their depths of love all my understanding is great yes been able to quote and and and quote scriptures and things like that awesome wonderful you ought to do that but God's Prophet said we need a Revival of Love Not Just theology amen now watch a human love had a beginning and it has it end all the Blessed Eternal God the love of God had no beginning and it'll never have an end when the oceans has wept themselves into the deserts now listen this is before the prophecy of Los Angeles this is 1958 in South Bend Indiana but he mentions it a few times in the message that one day the desert the oceans will weep its way into the desert we're on the brink of that destruction in the very age that we live when the oceans will weep themselves and the tsunamis and the tidal W or you say it's just the West Coast no it's not either when he stood down there in Florida in 1964 he said the same thing would happen again on the East Coast but remember the ocean will weep and cry why because of sin and filth on the Earth when the oceans has wept themselves into deserts and the world has got so full of sin till the heavens has turned its back on it and it staggers out through space like a drunk man coming home the love of God shall still endure Saints and Angels songen again he said do you ever think of that God the Great Master rainbow in the skies would say like that by the seven spirits of God now he takes the original Rainbow of God which is not six colors but seven and he breaks it down but to save time I won't go to all the colors today but he just mentions a couple here in this quote red being perfect love so the color of God's perfect perfect love in the rainbow is red why crimson color of redemption so out of this great Eternal issues forth this great bow this seven colored bow of God's covenant with the Earth and his people red perfect love after that comes felio love from an agapo to filo that's the love that you would have for your wife if some man would Suter you'd shoot his brains out wow see because it creates a jealousy but that's felio love secondary love then comes just for another man's wife now watch He's stepping it down the further down he comes to where we live every day so from the agape love it would be pure holy Timeless forgiving honest all that but then a man would love his wife and someone would insult or say something to her it be want to punch him or shoot his brains out as he said then that same man could actually fall in love with another man's wife now now what just happened to that man he stepped down from his love which was true and genuine he's willing to smack a man in the mouth he want to take his gun out and blow the man's brains out because he offended his wife but then right next to that love that you have for your wife is another love and all you have to do is step down one step further it's this close from real genuine F your love for your wife there's only one step that's right brother amen of you loving somebody else's wife and then one beneath that is you really get weird and you man fall in love with a man well come on now am it just keeps on going and going and going don't think you're immune today friends there's only one way we will not get caught up in these spirits of the last day we must love from the original Source you see it's not my responsibility to shame you all in living for God it's not my responsibility to hang you over hell every time we come to church and try to scare you into living for God I don't want to be that kind of a pastor I want to preach him so wonderful and so great and so good and so merciful oh come on let's have church today I want to preach him so wonderful that it will hopefully create a hunger in your heart to fall in love with such a mighty God and that you don't serve him because you're scared you're going to go to hell you serve him because you love him from your soul [Applause] oh my that's felio love secondary love then comes lust for another man's wife then comes filth it just becomes perverted but all of this kind of love had a beginning but when the real genuine love of God that I've been talking about comes into the human heart being by the new birth being born again it had no beginning it'll have no end you see there was a time you started loving God but there was never a time that he ever Started Loving You So how did you start from your fio aspect that's so many Christians are serving the lord today they love they say I love him I love him and I'm not saying that they don't but I'm just just saying was what love it's evident that many people through Christianity love and serve God from the fre of love because they will love him for a while and then they'll turn away and put a stop to their love and become an agnostic an Infidel an unbeliever well how in the world if they were loving God from the source of eternal love could you ever stop loving him and you stop serving him and you go back out into the world and start serving the devil that makes absolute no sense but if you can ever be born again from this essence of eternal love and actually what God does is give you that part of himself that can love him back the way he wants to be loved you see I don't know how to love him you don't know how to love him how don't how much you think you do you don't we do not know how to love him right I cannot love him right with my FAL love the only way I can love him is he gives me a deposit of himself and quickens that love within me within you and then it's him out of my body loving him back so it's the source that's been resourced it's the source that's what the Holy Ghost does that God sends down the resource of his own love and our soul and it's him in US worshiping him loving him oh my let's give him a hand of Praise what an awesome plan oh my it comes into the human being by the new births being born again it had no beginning it'll have no end you then are a son of God and a daughter of God your affections are on things above now you find in the church that what hindered the church has been the wrong conception of love there's two different types of love that's real love one of them in the Greek word is called agapo that's God's love then a perverted love from that is felo love which means human love felio comes from the word Fellowship the fal love is what you have for your wife and a might flirt with her and Sal her and you'd shoot his brains out over her that's what filo love will do it accompanies jealousy oh and many other things goes with it and the church said amen have many has ever been jealous before amen come on inch it on up there had enmity and strive that's my wife that's my son or daughter I can't believe them deacons told my son I'll tell you one thing I filo but the spirit of God is always subject to God's teaching amen right now watch what it would do but agape love would make you pray for his sinful soul thank now man could agape love his his God from his soul and filio love his wife his children all of that but even in that we don't want to just felo love our wife and our church family and our Earthly family we want to agape love them you see that's the key of why he tells us that when a man meets a woman and he loves her and he don't know why and she meets a man and she loves him and she don't know why but they just love one another that's an eternal mate that stepped out of Eternity and one day into a body of time and one day they will step back into eternity again I love my my wife with felio but I also love her with agapo in eternity she will be mine I will be hers there will be no more children I will not look at her as I did when she was a young girl and say oh my goodness and my heart started racing oh that's the prettiest thing I ever seen in my life I still think she's quite pretty be honest with you right now but you know and in that all of that part will be totally gone and we will look at each other totally different so the things that we dislike about people we go to church now I'm going to come over and S on this side of the pen and hunker down just in case anybody wants to throw a song book at me in this part right here there's people we go to church with that we just don't like things about them maybe even the preacher you sitting under things you don't like about him too well believe me that works both ways but you understand that when we get rid of fol love that goes with it amen than there's no jealousy there's no Strife there's no Envy now we're loving from a mixed bag so we pour from felo we pour from aape we pour from these sources oh Jesus but a gab love would make you pray for your sinful Soul that's the difference between the two loves God's love is the beginning of love it's the Fountain of love and the church today is lacking in that can we say Amen can we say God I need help that real agape love that makes you have love won't you notice how he keeps using this same verb over and over again it actually makes you have love for your enemy I'm trying I'm trying I figure that's the problem many of us are trying our best to love our enemies from the wrong Avenue and the wrong source of love and this is why we're failing you're trying to tap into FAL human life and I don't like them and I reckon I got to if I'm want to go to heaven and I want to go to hell Hallelujah brother Rob I'm going to love you buddy I want to love you I really don't want to but I'll tell you one time I'm going to love you brother Paul but if I ever get God's love that's right it makes me so from within my soul is a Dynamo that I have actually broke back into eternity and it's like that Dynamo that's just spinning around and it spins around in my soul and my my human love may look at and say oh he talked about me he run me down he said this that and other but the Dynamo just overpowers it and just brings you on you say but Lord Jesus I forgive my brother amen maybe he's having a bad day maybe he's having a hard time and then when I come to myself I'm just thinking oh Lord did I say that oh I realize all of y'all are angels here today except for me and I reckon I'm the only one holding up the Rapture right God sent this whole Sermon Just for me well I don't think so because looks like to me if I was the main problem he could have told me down in the basement where I studied and eliminated you all of all this whooping I figure y'all as guilty as I am I figure you know this is a reason that we've not already gone in the Rapture is because we're not Rapture Ready thank you Lord oh if we only had that kind of a love there'd be a Revival sweep this nation from coast to coast from north to south and the reason we do not have that love this is the main reason the church is not progressing like it should we don't need theology we only need real love to go with a theology we already know When Love is projected and it comes to its end friends I believe with all of my heart love has been projected for seven Church ages and we're right down here close to the end when the projected love to call a bride out of seven Church ages is almost right there at its very end and when love is projected it comes to its end Sovereign Grace produces what love projected you understand where we are here we are the time is taken away here we are the closing of the Gentile ages and love was projected thousands of years ago there will be a bride I'll call her out the seven bands of Life I'll call her out under the dispensation of these seven Church ages and seven Church age Messengers and here they are almost at the end and God says my love projected it yeah yes sir oh scientists are talking about 2050 and 2065 and 2075 I just life when I read all that stuff I think you guys need to wake up we're right at the end it was three minutes till midnight back in the 60s we're only seconds away now don't you understand what God's going to do love projected a bride and Grace will step in yes it will and what will the headstone be crying when it comes Grace Grace Grace So Divine love projected it and God's grace will come in and bring it to its end love projected Sovereign Grace that gave us a savior so then in order for us to be able to love this way we looked at it last Sunday but second Peter 1:4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust no wait minute I thought it was an apple I thought it was an apricot what in the world was Peter saying corruption entered into the world through lust don't you understand as long as Eve was inside of Adam she could never experience lust but it's when God pulled her out of Adam Adam could have never fallen had he stayed in the spirit image Hallelujah God made three great men Genesis 1 Genesis 2 and the promise of the great one in Genesis 3 and Adam was a spirit man then he become a flesh man and when he fell God projected by prophetic word I will bring you back who was that Christ Jesus then here come the pre-existing one the almighty one himself and he said I will bring love back to man's heart I will make man to be a lover again I will restore him back to fellowship thank you Lord Oh Oh Glory to God I thought of how God of the dove such a loving bird and the dove God wanting to make love with his human beings God wants to be loved and God wants to love you and God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son the whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life blessed be the Lord then go God wanting to make love he had to make something lovable he had to make something gentle like himself he had to make something that could be loved he had to make something of his own nature you couldn't love nothing that wasn't of your own nature another differentiation between the church and the bride God wants to make love to his people he wants to Fellowship talk to them that's why it's so important that you pray over the person you marry that you're marrying of the right nature nature of the word I mean so God wants to talk to the church and God will test them by his word so God will anoint a preacher to go have talked unto them about election and they'll say we don't believe in election oh we don't believe in predestination we don't want to know that predestinated seedset well you see what you're doing is you're showing that as of yet you've not been made into his nature cuz God is a god of sovereignty and he wants to talk to his wife about how Sovereign he is he wants to talk to his wife about how great he is are you hearing me he wants to talk to wife when they're going through the offest trial they've ever been through in their life and he wants to talk to his his wife and convince her that he's still in control but many people that do not love your I oh how in the world would you let this happen to me you're supposed to be a god of love you're supposed to be a god of Mercy why why would you let that happen well you see they're not of his nature yet but once they become of his nature in their pain in their Agony in their sorrow they can say you are perfect you make no mistakes you do nothing wrong don't you see he must allow us to be tested in such a way to prove that our nature matches his own sovereignty thank you Lord so what do people who love him from felo they rebel I they know way I'd serve a God Like That my church Don't Preach it that way right come on well they go to talk tell them about Malachi for what Mal Prophet stuff well days of prophets has passed he's looking for someone that he can talk to oh I love it after church me and Carol will go home and we'll we'll talk about the words sometimes after Sunday Sunday evening then Monday again and Tuesday it's just it's our life we just love the Lord and we talk about the word and just get together you imagine then God want to talk to the church about his word the church we don't believe that in our church our Pastor said that was a cult our denomination strictly forbids us from shouting and dancing but they'll allow you to go to a party and shout and dance well come on the original dance belongs in church not at a party well praise the Lord our church don't believe in speak speak in Tong our church don't believe that God is a god of Miracles well you need to get saved you need to tap into that real genuine love of God if God wants to talk to us today about miracles I'll answer back amen Lord if the Lord wants to talk to us about his sovereignty I'm going to sit in his lap come on somebody I'm going to sit there and say oh papa how great you are how Mighty you are how wonderful you are I wasn't always of that nature but once I got born again of the word of God for the hour if papa wants to talk to me about Grace I'll say Amen Papa he wants to talk to me about predestination I'll say Amen Papa I had you in my mind before the world began I'll say Amen Papa why I'm of his nature so if he wants to talk to me about the Divine architect with a Divine bought attribute with a divine plan with a Divine this and a Divine that I just sat there with my eyes looking at him cooling back he can make love to me cuz his nature and mine listen are the [Laughter] same and that you too if you're born again so he tries to tell them about how they should dress what difference does that make he tries to tell them you can't walk that road sisters with them spy kill shoes on oh that don't matter oh you can't walk that Ro and make that P and so you think God is going to take a woman like that into eternity and spend eternity with a woman which Rebels against his word now nobody has to make a peep from this point on but there's probably some of you maybe feel like you've been married to somebody for eternity and you think Lord have mercy help me Jesus that's okay everybody look down everybody look up just close your eyes or whatever so you won't be a dead giveaway can you imagine the Lord Jesus taking a people in this earth they don't believe in predestination they don't believe in election they don't believe in a prophet's message they don't even believe in church agents they don't believe in none of that stuff they don't believe in Holiness and he's going to live with eternity with that loud mouth BR woman sir brother amen oh let's close there isn't nothing else that you can do only believe and if he believes in them little immoral things would just drop off as you believe you become love and love is God and you begin to wind yourself into Christ these other things you don't have to quit doing them they just quit themselves there's just no desire to do it the worshipper having been purged in a more conscious desire of sin Hebrews 9 see when the worshipper is purged when he's born again when his old nature dies and a new nature sits in then becomes a part of God a Son of God it gets new life and the life is the Greek word there zoi which means the life of God then you become an offspring of God and God cannot hurt you without hurting himself hallelujah it's your right if you are part of the elect of God it's a god-given right for you to have the god of love and for you to become love let's Stand Together Brothers just skip down to as the eagle stirreth her nest there in shiaka hey would you sing that song for us ask out all men will know you are my disciples when you got love one for the other the world's so thirsty for that friend God is love until we get Brotherly Love we'll never get very far with God we need a Revival of Love among the children of God now I'm going to hold you up for just a few minutes here maybe standing but I want to read you this sister Ray Le had all the her group of Sunday school kids to write some different appreciation things and I want to say we thank you Carol and I for the pastor appreciation month cards and gift cards and things like that but I always enjoy getting them from the Sunday school kids because you never know what they're going to say and each one of them you know writing what they think about me and what how they appreciate me or whatever more it is and I I could not keep from laughing at one of the comments that I got and I had to share it with Carol and the comment about me was other said you know thank you for telling the truth and thank you for this and that and the other and another one of the little children said he stands up the whole service so I guess that's a way I'll be remembered so I'm going to have you stand up a little bit longer oh my precious friend my beloved my darlings of the Gospel my begotten children unto God listen to me your pastor I wish there was some way I could explain it to you those no words I couldn't find it it's not found anywhere but just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing that you ever there's no way to explain it I just can't do it whatever you do friends lay aside everything now remember this is after his visitation beyond the curtain of time lay aside everything else till you get perfect love get to a spot this is the spot I want and the spot I want for you get to a spot that you can love everybody your enemy everything else that one visit there to me has made me a different man I can never never never be the same brother brandham that I was thus says the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for all that's there was there no matter how many how many religious demonstrations how many Good Deeds you've done or whatever you've done that won't count nothing on that day it'll take perfect love so whatever you do lay aside everything else until you are so filled with the love of God till you can love those who hate you beyond the curtain of time brother Neville continues to read as I begin to move from that beautiful joyful place as far as my eyes could see people were coming toward me to embrace me crying my precious brother suddenly I was back on the bed again I said oh God help me never let me compromise with the word let me say straight on the word I don't care what anyone else does Lord let me press to that beautiful joyful place I am more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no deaths only Supreme Beauty and joy Hallelujah he says whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even every enemy let's B it together oh Lord Jesus I wonder if there's any present here today that you'd say Lord I I I need I need that more in my heart father would you just raise your hand to him maybe somebody got an answer that you've been searching for for years of your life and you find yourself struggling to love those that have hurt you so deeply and so severely and you in and out and up and down with it resentment bitterness friends I'm telling you it'll grieve the spirit of God out of your life listen to me as your brother as your pastor you let bitterness grow up inside of you it will grieve the Holy Spirit right out of your life you think you're hurting them by being bitter toward them you're hurting yourself more than anyone else then it'll come into your family and it'll outgrow itself into others and others and keep on going but brother Donnie it's hard tell me about it I know it's hard but when we can so Soul fall in love with Jesus Christ and let his love live out of us we can love our enemies we can pray for them how may like to be remembered today as we pray Lord Jesus as we started this service out Lord as I got up here and then we opened in prayer now we're going to close it in prayer I had the advantage over them and and that I knew the direction that you'd placed upon my heart but now Lord we all stand on the same plane as it were all of us checking our hearts and our lives and seeing where we stand help me father that I will not try to love my enemies with my felo love help me that I will not try to love those that would Rejoice if I was to have a car wreck today and be killed some of the folks would be so happy that's really pitiful so help me not to deal with that with felo love but with the go love maybe some here today they're still dealing with things hurts that they got when they were Sinners maybe even since they come to be Christians maybe since they've even come to our church and somebody's hurt them deeply and they find themselves struggling with it may they be able to surrender it today father Lord Jesus we're living in an awesome time where eternity and time is blending together again you will do something in this age which has never been done before that agape love will be in such a multiplied form all over the Earth Satan will catch a glimpse of it before the Rapture Lord Jesus Jus help us we love you father we worship
