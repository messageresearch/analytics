able to look over into that Dimension that's not more than 20 ft away I'd say all of our troubles and our worries and our issues would seem so so small wouldn't they I'm glad in one way that I don't have access to look into that realm if I could break into that realm weekly and look at it I'd say I'd be pretty much useless I'd be useless to you useless to myself because I would be so homesick and make me so distraught that I wouldn't want to live in this world anymore I'm grateful that the Lord gives us enough to be able to keep pulling us and drawing us but yet not so much that we think I just can't live another day I Can't Live Another Day that word is that land and that place and that atmosphere is so awesome and so wonderful aren't you grateful he knows exactly what to give us I'm like you sure I'll be honest with you I wish a lot of times my way was a lot easier I wish my load in life have been so much easier but I'd probably been sorry or in dirt sh you all had an easier way You' probably be so stinking rotten I mean we're a bunch of rotten SPO L the sins anyway so he knows exactly how to give us just what we need don't he never let more come upon us and what we're able to bear though the way we look at it sometimes it's way more than we're able he said come on Donnie put on your big boy britches you can take more than what you want to let on like remember who we're trying to trick almighty God I can't take no more I can't take no more I can't take no more he said come on you don't know what you can take but I do amen oh isn't it an honor to be a child of God today well we're here today with great anticipation to say what the Lord's going to speak to us once again and U our meetings coming up this U This Week begin with Friday brother Matt Watkins and U Saturday brother Daryl will be speaking and U he and I had been talking and we've been praying and just waiting on a little bit of direction from the Lord as far as a a prayer line I know that there's there's always so many needs among God's people and I realize that a prayer line sometimes is almost expected an every special meeting and that's not necessary to bad unless it becomes a custom and it becomes a tradition and well if you don't have a prayer line my goodness how can you have a meeting so I wanted to make sure before we did it that it was you know the right thing to do so uh brother Daryl took a couple of days away and he text me just there before yesterday and said he'd been thinking about it praying about it felt like it'd be a good thing for us to do um so the Lord had been dealing with him about along the lines of healing so we'll plan on doing that on Saturday night and with that in view I think we will up the service on Saturday night to 6 o00 instead of 7 o' and that way maybe we won't all be nearly dead anyway on Sunday morning so Brother David Siler will be closing it out for us on Sunday morning and we always enjoy hearing our brother David and we're just looking for a precious time in the Lord I consider these times wonderful times to be able to gather together several of our Saints are today over at brother Josh Bennett and um I was privileged to be able to be there with them on Friday night and uh to see their new place that the lord gave him there it's just just so wonderful brother Josh is such a fine Brother and I so enjoyed being there want to thank those that was there from the church here pulling on me and helping me time I got done I felt like a wited dish rag got back to the room and I was soaking wet but I I really enjoyed being there I wondered why the Lord was having me go down a certain direction because I was preaching on uh whose report will you believe brother Josh told me after the service cuz what I was dealing with when I first started out was people leaving the message so I hammered on that for a little while and I thought what in the world am I doing so after the service he told me he said you didn't know it but there was some people here last night and tonight that have pulled away from the message and their Pastor has pulled away from the message and he said some of the very things questions that they had the lord gave them the answers I love him W you I just love him for being there now we can give him a hand clap cuz you know I couldn't do that I'm a noad from Kentucky so I certainly couldn't do anything like that but I said Thank you for telling me that because as a preacher sometimes you just wonder why am I saying this why am I going I don't understand Lord I don't understand but it just it encourages you whenever you you hear that let's read today from the book of Isaiah chapter 54 verse 4 and I want to speak to you again today on the r right to be married to God H the right to be married to God Isaiah 544 I hope and I get done today that you will realize what a great privilege that God has given you even to be saved will be an awesome thing and we know that there will be many many people that will be saved that will not be bride and we certainly are not here today to put down anyone but I'm just grateful myself for me that I have heard a higher call amen and it call me higher than just a Salvation fear not for Thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for Thou shalt not be put to shame for Thou shalt forget the shame of thy Youth and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood anymore for thy maker is thine husband the Lord of hosts it's amazing how many times in the Old Testament that this is used in the plural form hosts which means of course more than one so there's an Angelic a Celestial seraphim all different types of heavenly host and then there's a host in the Stars according to the Book of Genesis God when he made them out there and wrote his first Bible and he called them hosts so the stars are a host and then there's host here on the earth so the Lord of hosts plural is his name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole Earth shall he be called for the Lord has called thee as a woman forsaken grieved in spirit and a wife of Youth when thou was refused sath thy God only God could take such a woman and turn her from a wasteland into a fertile virgin that would bring forth the Millennium I may let to be remembered today as we pray I'd like to say also whenever you turned in the entrance out here anybody notice that new graphics on that wasn't that beautiful out there brother Eddie and sister Susie gilworth printed that for us and they don't like acknowledgement but I'm going to do it anyway buddy so hold your peace man they was out here yesterday when I drove in from I passed out here in from North Carolina and it was blazing hot those of you that was out and they were out there sweating and a carrying on trying to put that on I just wanted to say thank you today thank you they have done so much in our new place signage one thing after another after another they don't want no credit it and they don't I I know that but I just want to say how much we appreciate youall thank you so much heavenly father as Mortals we like to give a word every now and then just to let people know that we appreciate them and appreciate what they do I cannot imagine what it's going to be like that day when we all of us walk before you we know according to the Bible there's a great book of remembrance that's been written even our prayers are contained and vows and they're poured out when a great Victory happens when we stand before you that day and each of us walk up there and we have to give an account we're so grateful that we will not look into the eyes of an angry judge we were for forsaken we were lost we were pitiful really but today we're found and you and your loving character don't want any of us to walk in to Heaven's Gates empty-handed so you give us things to do in life you're the one who give us these tasks you're the one who gives us the strength to perform them and then when we stand before you you turn right around and reward us for what you helped us to do forgive us for complaining and grumbling of the things that you ask us to do father may we be of such willing heart we can be transformed by the commission that's been given to us you see our needs today many sick facing different things in their life father we ask that you would come help your children I stand here father of all these hundreds of people no doubt the most needy person in the building it comes my lot to try to speak words of Eternal value and eternal quality help me Lord shut my mouth to anything that would displease you make me sensitive that I can follow the leading of the Holy Ghost when we leave this place today we'll say did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way bless the word father speaker and hearer we pray in Jesus name and the church said amen amen God bless you you may be seated in the state of Tennessee you don't even have to be a preach preacher to marry anybody so when I came here from Kentucky in Kentucky where I'm originally from you had to be bonded you had to have a license you had to have somebody that would actually go to the courthouse and sign your bond not because you're a criminal but they just wanted to make sure who you were so that whenever you signed on that marriage license or marriage certificate that they could be sure that you were validated and they knew what you were doing that you were qualified when Carol and I got married and we were going to my uncle's church and almost 51 years ago whenever we got married and in a couple of weeks it will be my uncle couldn't marry us I would have much rather him marri us but he couldn't because he had no license he had no bond so he never married anybody in all the years of his ministry and we know that natural marriage is a reflection of spiritual marriage a lot of people feel like they can marry someone to God because they think they can choose God's wife so then they have the ability and say well that's a good person and this is a nice person and and this person does this and this person does that that and therefore they should be they should be the wife of God the bride they should be the ones but you see none of us are validated to be able to say this one is this one isn't that one is that one that one that one none of us have been bonded or licensed or chosen by God to be able to say who is and who isn't one of the greatest surprises of course when we get there we'll be able to look around and see people that we never thought would ever be there cuz we knew them in life and we say oh my goodness there's no way they will ever even make it and maybe they squandered a lot of the years of their life and the Lord finally got a hold of them and turned them around and sure enough they're there and then you'll realize yourself and you look at you and say oh my Lord I made it that probably be the biggest surprise most of us will have brother Jim you think really I made it by the grace of God I actually make it and it won't be because of it any of your works that you done it'll be by the grace of the Lord so then in God's marriage it's very similar although churches and organizations and systems and men and Bishops and all that sort of thing they want to pick who they think the church is so every church say take in the Tri Cities area every Church feels like they have something special to offer the community their parishioners the people who support that building and that at work they feel like they have something special a little bit different than the other Church down the road or the other Church down that direction or the other church across the corner they feel like you know by a different name so they got a different name out here and they say because that name then we baptize in water versus the methodists which only sprinkle so we've got special something to offer then the unitarians they feel like they have something different the Universalist they have something different Seventh Day Adventist they feel like they have something different because they meet on Saturday instead of on Sunday so every Church feels like that they have something different and by doing that they want to promote of course their church and growth of their church so they want the parishioners there to be able to be a witness on their job and whenever they're out doing things and hey bring people to our church so they have bumper stickers printed out and some of them have little pin you know that they put out on their little uh their their dresses or their vest or their coats or whatever more I attend certain certain church and they have little banners and things like that what's that for what's a form of advertisement a form of advertisement and then maybe someone will ask well well where do you go well I I go to so and so well how is it oh it's a wonderful Church our church is so wonderful well I'm kind of looking for a church oh you ought to come and visit us well tell me about your church well we have this great Pastor he is Young curly headed I mean come from this Cemetery I mean Seminary I mean and oh educated got a smile like that guy from Houston I mean I just a killer smile I I've been there for years he never lashes out at anyone I've never heard him even raise his voice he's so Gentile he's so mannerly sounds like to me you're describing a funeral director I mean you're not describing any preacher that I want to sat under I'd rather I'd rather sat under a man of God that knew how to handle a two-head sword cut me up one side and down the other but be able to get me to heaven then I would all the curly-headed smiley guys that's going to lead me straight to hell if they don't tell me the truth right but you see in that every church then feels like well we've got something to offer and we feel like that by entering our gates when you come to those doors there we are the very entrance into heaven itself because we have the truth and we have something different than this church and that one and that one and that one and in reality we feel the same way if not we just sell our building and go join up with another church right and I could retire wow wouldn't that be awesome and y'all could have a really nice Pastor a like able one but instead we're here and you're stuck with me for the time being but that's only half the story I'm stuck with you all too so then why do we look at it different then we we dress different sometimes we walk different our doctrines are different our terminology at our church is different we say things that's not common to hear so you could visit hundreds of churches in our are area here and you would hear things said that would be so different very unusual when people come I see them from time to time as theyve come we've had so many visitors since we've been here and I'll see the looks on their faces and I think my goodness poor things that Miss think we're absolute bunch of nuts just absolutely nuts because things that are said because I feel like as well as you that we have a different type of message to project do we not we look different we we act different we have different things that we rally around we don't gather together our money and and send it to a headquarters and then headquarters tells us what we can do and headquarters sends us our pastor you vote your pastor in and vote him out if you wish to you vote your deacons in your trustees in I don't appoint them but you do that right so in that we're different so it comes in the same way about saying who is going to be the wife of God so every church then would naturally feel like they are the one now we come back to the Seventh Day Adventist and they studied prophecy of course they love the Book of Daniel I used to have a friend of mine that was Seventh Adventist actually he was my boss when I worked in secular works so many him went around and around and around on a lot of different things and you know oh my he's telling me how religious his wife was and boy tell Donnie she just prays and reads her Bible and he had a little trailer that he wanted me to wire up for him so he hauled some go-karts and things like that he didn't know how to do it so I put some lights on it for him and wired the wires up put a trailer hitch in a ball and this that and the other for him so he said now you'll have to come up to my house to do that so he lived a few miles away from me I said all right I can do that so I went up there and he said I want you to meet my wife you talking about a saint I'm telling you what I said wow I I can't wait to meet her that's that's really nice now I said I'm I'm not much myself I love studying this stuff but he said now she is really a Christian I said okay all right I I look forward to meeting her so I up on at his house after work one evening and knock on the door and a woman comes to the door with a two-piece bikini on I like to fainted he come out behind her and said meet my sainted wife I me I about had to have Mouse to Mouse not with her either now what we call Saints would be so different from that but yet they feel like because as they go to church on Saturday and on and on and on they're the bride well Jehovah Witness of course feel like that they are they're the bride and this one another religion over here that one and that one so how is God going to determine which is his wife because what church wouldn't want to be married to God so once the Church of Israel of the Old Testament broke their vows before God over and over again generation after generation then finally God said I will put you away in divorce and he said where is the writing of your mother's divorcement through the prophet Hosea who in Shadow and tip married a Woman by the name of Goomer and he gets her out of harlotry takes her to himself changes her identity but then of course we know she went right back to that thing again sold back into slavery and the prophet hears about her being for sale again so he goes to the auction you imagine as she he sees him moving and Milling among the crowd and the beds are going high who will give me 200 200 250 250 300 selling a human being but here Hosea walks up and he's the highest bidder you imagine as he walks up to her and she looks him in the face and she's thinking what's he going to do to me how is he going to treat me what's going to happen but he reaches over takes a hold of her hand and says I've come to take you home amen that was me God did this an antitype over and over again to Israel and eventually God says no more I will not be married to you as a national bride ever again your position has been forfeited forever but I will get a mulation Multicultural multicolored multi-race people called the Gentiles they will be the woman you should have been but you never were Israel you were constantly sleeping around on me constantly committing adultery on me and I forgave you and sent one Prophet after another but I'm finished with you now remember God knew that whenever he took a gentile bride that there would be an element of those Gentiles that would start doing the exact same thing and it wasn't very long at all after he started dealing with the Gentile bride in the church ages sure enough it started again so he had his Angel message Meer to write down and say there's some whatat that I have against thee for thou Hast left thy First Love and the first message to the first church age in the Book of Revelation is God going through the same thing again I'll tell you friends he's so much more patient than we are how many thousands of years has he dealt with us rotten sorry human beings but he is bound and determined he's going to have somebody that's going to love him I don't know the way you feel about it this morning but this is the way I feel I'm going to be one of them if y'all don't want to go up to you there's people in the tri cities that don't want to go there's church members that don't want to treat him like a real husband that's up to them I'm going to for me and my house he is my king he is my husband so that I don't argue with him I don't debate with him I don't tell him I don't want you I don't want you telling me what to do I don't want you telling me what to wear what I can't wear how I can talk how I can dress if he tells me don't do it that's good enough for me he don't even have to tell me why all he's got to tell me is do this and don't do that and I will do my best to do it or he may have to knock me in the head a couple of times to get me to do it but the end result is I will do it because I love him so how is God going to especially in the end time when the multiplication of denominational systems will be so many now even when the prophet was here there was 900 now there 30 something hundred I think was the last time that I heard about it probably more than that now it's been a few months ago so there's probably close to 4,000 different denominational views so every one of them of course considered thems to be a unique entity by which they have this special impartation by God to be the doorway to heaven but God himself is not going by that but God chose the way by which he would determine who his bride actually was and how she would be called out that is through the entity of the son of man now remember the son of man was first spoke about by God himself in the Old Testament and that was Daniel Ezekiel God called Ezekiel the son of man more than into the rest of the prophets so when the Lord Jesus come on the earth he be to merge the title of son of man into his own life now he referred to himself of course as Son of God but that was in the minority but mainly he referred to himself as son of man now you can imagine then the Jews when they begin to hear this termin ology that he's calling himself that that it really made them upset because he's saying he's this special manifestation from God and even more so than Daniel more so than Ezekiel then Jesus begin to say certain things that would happen about the son of man then the son of man must suffer many things and be crucified and all that of the Gentiles well that was present tense but then he be to speak prophetically about the son of man and he would say something like this in Luke 17 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed revealed so the cover will be took off of the son of man and it would not be a Corporal coming it would not be a Corporal visible something that everybody would look up in the heavens and say oh there's Jesus there's Jesus look at there there's Jesus no but it would be a revealing of the son of man so what would it be it would be Christ himself in a supernatural body that would come down and be able to appear and disappear now remember even in the 50s the prophet tells us that the son of man has already been making his appearance so he was already on the earth now as we looked at it last week then there would be times that he would come this way but in the last days it would be with a special anointing notice and proving his word again Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being reveal notice what he going to be not no more as a church not no more but the bride is called in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Lamb so God won't be using a bishop or an organization or a system or a pope or something like that but this must be a validation by God himself so God will give us a way that we can know who's working under the administration of the son of man now it won't be coming down and shaking the preacher's hand and joining a church book in case you're wondering today we don't have a church book but we do have an entrance into the body of Christ anybody can walk on them back doors back there but that don't mean you're under Christ there's only one way to get there that's 1 Corinthians chapter 12 for by one Spirit we were all baptized into that one body then once in that body St John 15:7 if you abide me and my words Abid in you then ask what you will is that right so Jesus gives us the entry by which we're able to come in to the family of God now notice he goes on to say that the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh and unite the two together now remember God In His glory in the express image of who he is in his fullness has never been seen by a human being but God has been seen out of his glory now remember according to Exodus 24 the elders saw the god of Israel and saw the pavement that was under his feet Moses asked to see his way and he said I want to see your face he said no man can see my face but there is a place by me and I will set you in the Cliff of The Rock and I will pass by and when I pass by I will move my hand and you will be able to see me and what he saw was the back parts of a man you see the Effigy or the image of God had stepped out of the fullness of that Glory that's the only way he's ever been seen now you see the Rapture of what we are looking for is not going to the wedding or the marriage but actually the marriage supper of the Lamb let's jump down there if you wouldn't feasted the trumpets here he's talking about Sarah God changed her body and turned them back it's a mystery that's to be revealed now in this time by the son of man man not Son of God Son of Man see the evening message it's a mystery that's to be revealed by the son of man the evening message turn back and that was the last sign that they seen was what that discernment now remember I mentioned to you last Sunday that the discern mment that was displayed in this age was not one of the nine gifts in the book of Corinthians it was not a gift of the spirit it was discernment or the prophet link these two terms together prophetic discernment or prophetic so who is it it's the Lord Jesus himself now I don't know how to explain this to you but there are times that I have preached and probably every preacher maybe goes through this and experiences it but it it's like that you're you're preaching sometimes it'll be when I first start out sometimes it'll be in the middle of the sermon sometimes it might be at the end and the only way I know to explain it to you is like this it's like that you feel the spirit of God come on you and the anointing begins to anoint your gift and when it anoints your gift you're able to move aside you may be as sick as a dog you may feel absolutely terrible you may be so low and so down you don't even how to have enough courage to lift up your head but the anointing will start moving on your gift when you start talking and then you'll become more and more anointed until you reach a pinnacle of whenever from that point on you start going down but then somewhere in the time of that sermon may not be every sermon maybe ever one of out of every five or one out of every 10 but it's like there's something else that takes you and I was explaining it to Carol yesterday she had asked me about it I said well the best way I know to describe it it's like this it's like that someone steps into you and it's different than you and it's like that person is looking out of your body and they take your mouth and they go to saying things that you don't even know it's not in your notes you don't have scriptures you don't have quotes there that uh that you can read but it's like this person will take you over and start speaking out of you and it's just like it's pouring out of an inexhaustible Fountain it may last five minutes it may last 10 it may last 15 probably the longest I've ever been under that would be maybe 20 minutes I'm not sure I could live if it was during the whole sermon I don't mind telling you and then whenever that person speaks what they want to say you can feel it as it starts pulling away and Carol Tomy say I've noticed that several times before and it's like they start pulling away and then the anointing is back on your gift again and then you will resume your thought or your direction and then go right ahead with the service now it's the same spirit of God the same anointing of course and now remember I don't have the ability when the presence of God comes on me to be able to discern that's one inner generation amen that's what the prophet said over and over again that's one inner generation that's prophetic as a matter of fact he says it in 1964 now he said your pastor won't do this because it's one to a generation but it must have been something very s simar whenever Christ would come down and take over this man and begin to show him people's names addresses their houses uh you know how many steps went up to their house all all that sort of thing you've heard it many many times and yet whenever that would back off of him he would say was that true right was was what he told you the truth I don't remember what was said he said I I'll have to go back back and listen to that on tape because I I don't remember what was said so you see that was not him doing that it was someone else that was using his human instrumentality how many understands what I'm saying now you see that's where that we look at the gift of a prophet and a prophet's office different than a pastor or an evangelist or a teacher all the rest of the Ministry none other aspects of the ministry will ever walk where God ordained that Prophet to be and the church said so that's what God was going to use in the last days and I said the last time they seen was what that discernment before the chains of the body come now what's God knew in order to reveal himself that he would have to on occasion leave that fullness of the glory that only only holy angels are have ever been able to walk into now Jesus was the one that said no man ha at any time ever seen God and yet the Bible gives us examples and illustrations where it directly says that they saw God Jacob named the name of the place where he saw the angel pineal because he said he had wrestled with God but it was not God in the fullness of that image it was God stepping out of that in order to make himself known do you understand the Holy Ghost how many has the Holy Ghost today do you understand what that is that's your portion of God that stepped out of that fullness to be able to live in your human body how many's made mistakes this week how many's made mistakes in the last 5 Seconds probably most of us you know so how in the world could that holy God ever live in this through a condescended form that stepped out of that fullness now the fullness of the godhead bodily is upon the Earth again in that attribute which has only been your certain times on the Earth but it's not in me the fullness of the godhead is not in any individual here today but it's in the entire body oh praise the Lord now watch in Exodus 13:21 and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the to lead them in the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and by night now notice this is capital L capital O capital r capital D so the Lord would appear to them in a cloud and then he would change himself to a fire and then change himself but what was the cloud what was the fire it was simply a manifestation it's the divine presence of God coming into visibility for he himself is invisible Exodus 14:19 the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel notice not an angel of God the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them so you see it depends on which side of the pillar of cloud you're on it tells who you is so he was between them and Egypt Egypt wound up on the wrong side of the cloud am I'll tell you friends you don't want to wind up on the wrong side of the cloud if you're on the wrong side of the cloud it's judgment if you're on the right side of the cloud it's Mercy if you're on the wrong side of the pillar of fire it's condemnation if you're on the right side of the pillar of fire it's justification notice again in Exodus 14:20 and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these how in the world could the same thing the very same manifestation would blind some people and produce great light to others it's happening again oh my so that one that could come not near the other all the night Exodus 32:34 therefore now go and lead the people under the place of which I have spoken unto thee behold mine Angel not one of my angels but mine Angel this is going to be God's own personal theophany yeah which is Christ shall go before thee nevertheless in the Day When I visit I will visit their sin upon them in Exodus 33:13 now therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight Moses prayed show me now thy way that I may Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight and consider this this thy Nation thy people and he said my presence we read this the other day pum face in front of to front the face of at the face or the front from before or from before the face my presence my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest and he said unto him If thy presence shall not go with me carry us not up hence this is the term that I mentioned to you the other night that I had stumbled across in studying and it was a word that I'd never looked at in all my years of studying the scripture I'd never run ac across this compound name of God and it's Malik Yahweh the term Malik Yahweh occurs 65 times in the text of the Hebrew Bible Malik Yahweh so notice the angel of God or the angel of the Lord or the angel of his presence it's not another being it's actually God himself there's angels in this church today y'all believe that angels are right here amongst us this morning but yet hundreds of us sitting here and probably most of us including me will not see them unless God would open up a way for me to be able to see it and we've seen several Angels here in the church since we've been here already but that's only possible if God would somehow open our eyes and to let us peer into that Dimension which is here present so if God would be able to do that then we might see one there some one here one over here one back there one by you one up here they could be all over this whole building this morning so could also the son of man Christ Jesus now his presence he chooses to reveal himself in this way so this term Malik Yahweh can mean the angel of the Lord the angel of God or the angel of Jehovah now the difference between the angel of God and an angel of the Lord is that some of the Angels were created therefore they had a beginning the Bible terms some of them of course as elect watch in Isaiah 639 in all their Affliction he was afflicted I love the way Isaiah captures this because he brings into view the scenario of the children of Israel down in the land of Egypt and I'd like to remind you today that the Lord is mindful of your Affliction he's mindful of all that you go through well you say if he's mindful of me why don't he take it all off of me well there's times that he answers yes there's times he says no and there's times he says wait a while so if God delays it doesn't mean that he's not mindful it just means he has a reason or a purpose for you going through what you're going through anybody say Amen to that so this reminds us then of how he feels in all their Affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence now here it is again Malik Yahweh the angel of his presence now remember this is different than Jehovah Adonai or Jehovah Shalom Jehovah TI Cano Jehovah our Banner Jehovah our righteousness Jehovah Shalom Jehovah our peace so it's a different attribute of God you say why in the world do we need this well you might ask Cyro phenician woman the same thing when she comes to the Lord Jesus and her daughter is possessed with a spirit and she says oh thou son of David have mercy on me the Lord Jesus never even looked her way you know why she was calling him by the wrong name so if I'm preaching here this morning and somebody said preach it brother Jim preach it brother Jack preach it brother George preach it brother Frank preach it sister Carol we'll know you don't belong in this church we know there's something wrong with you you're out a sink right why because you're using the wrong name you see for those who call upon him under the titles of father son Holy Ghost how pitiful I know I was once in that Darkness I've told you before I would pray to the father and then I'd pray to the son and then I'd pray to the Holy Ghost and then I'd get confused cuz I couldn't remember which one I'd prayed to the liest and I didn't want either one of them to get mad so I'd go through the whole routine again well I tell you one thing my prayers got a whole lot more simple realize there wasn't three but there's actually just one after after all here oh Israel the Lord our God is one and his name is one so you see dispensation when the woman calls on him as son of David he never even answered her a word the Bible says but whenever she said Lord immediately she got his attention because she prayed and ask in the right dispensational title this is what the prophet tells us in the seals that they scream and they holler and they cry and they don't get nothing come on but it will be revealed in the Thunders he says I hope you understand the Son of God the Holy Ghost God gave birth to himself a son and it's called the Holy Ghost which is the Son of God the spirit had a son well y'all looking at me fun this morning if I got jam on my face or something like that the spirit had a son and God chose to use that manifestation down through the church ages but a promise in the end time that it would change and merge back into the son of man so who is this son of man Brother Don you talking about just go ahead and tell us playe all right I will it's Jesus same one that was the son of God same one that died on the cross raised from the dead but now appearing himself amongst his bride in the last days now you see he could not do it in the human form because it can only be at one place at one time so he could divide himself by Spirit they've already had church this morning in Africa all over India and you know them different parts of the world brother the Andre's done completed his series of meetings Andrew Glover down in Australia and they've done done there they're already finished of course in New Zealand you cross the International Date Line so they're already finished in Europe probably people from France and Norway and England are streaming our service now because it's already ahead in their time and yet the spirit of God can be healed and there and there and there and exactly in the same way where in the Corporal body if the Lord Jesus would have remained in that he could only been at one of our churches so you imagine as many message churches that they are we might have got him once every 10 years well he might have wind up being here said hey you know what now in the year of 1934 or 2034 rather I'll be back to your all's church because I I've got to go everywhere else to everybody else's church and y'all only give me about once or twice every 10 years years or so but he wanted to make himself in a form to where he could be all over the Earth at the same time so whether you're in Tennessee or Ohio or New Zealand or Australia or Singapore or China or Russia or Ukraine wherever you are every member of the body of Christ got have the same baptism of the Holy Ghost and be able to have the same Authority before the presence of God as Peter James Jam s and John received on the day of Pentecost aren't you glad for that and in all their Affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them so here we see a foreshadow in the Old Testament that the angel of his presence is fulfilling the office of Savior you'll also find this same Prophet saying that it was my right hand that brought salvation so God makes an angel of his presence visible so he can appear disappear come down in a meeting manifest himself disappear you see there's only one human body that he permanently resided in and it ain't mine and it wasn't even brother brandham it was Jesus but he would come by special manifestation he would appear disappear now watch what he goes on to say and he beared them and carried them all the days of old Exodus chapter 2 verse3 it came to pass in the process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their Cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage and God heard their groaning and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob Exodus 3:7 and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows and I am come down I am come down to deliver them jump down to verse 9 now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel has come unto me I have also seen the oppression he is so mindful I'll remind you again he's mindful of where you are this morning judges chap 10: 16 put it they put away the strange Gods from among them and they serve the Lord and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel God has a soul his soul was grieve Jeremiah 31:20 is Ephraim my dear son is he a pleasant child for sin I spake against him I do earnestly remember him still therefore my bows are troubled for him I will surely have mercy upon Him saith the Lord what does it tell us friends God is mindful he's mindful of where we are he knows we need more than the anointing of Pentecost to make a Rapture if the returning of the gifts is all we need to produce a Rapture why did not it happen in ausa street that Pentecostal move that broke all those years ago it went around the world there were preachers that were praying for the sick they were raising the Dead it was a Revival that was so phenomenal they would gather together 50 60 70 100,000 people in one setting we never have touched that and to be honest with you never will because that's not our dispensation but yet it seems as if though some think that was the greater glory it's like comparing Solomon's Temple to the human Temple of the Lord Jesus what the presence of God came down and the glory was so great that the priest could not Minister H yet which of the temples was the greatest that one there that Solomon built or that human one standing there when John baptized him in the river that day it would seem to the human eye that God displayed a greater manifestation in Solomon's time that he did it the water that day but that was God's ultimate achievement in that house of God many want us to go back to Pentecost they want us to go back to a former glory but I'll tell you right now the bride will never go through or take a Rapture by us returning to isua street we have got to have a dispensation of God in the last day that's going to take us higher than healing our bodies oh Hallelujah now this in Zechariah 28 for thus sayith the Lord of hosts after the glory hasth he sent me unto the Nations which spoiled you for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye acts 9:4 and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I I am Jesus whom thou persecutest and yet he was not touching the Lord Jesus himself he was touching his Tabernacles on the earth So what had God done he had changed himself oh my notice let's skip down there Brothers Beyond this next scripture so the angel of God's presence or his face which is God's nature also I found this in studying this week to express image of the person of God is Isel i t h i eel is a the word that was with God and always was God and yet projected out of him not as another being now going out of him but himself changing himself changing his garments 2 Corinthians 4:3 if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the God of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them here is the image of God for God is invisible oh lord for we preach not ourselves oh we some of the message preachers could read this scripture right here and start applying it well we don't preach ourselves well come on brother Donnie we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness ha shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in what the face of Jesus Christ so God's glory was made manifest here is God's paum in the New Testament the angel of his presence was Jesus notice Colossians 1:15 who is the image of the invisible God right so the visibility of the invisible God was Jesus so he could appear in this room right here now and remain totally invisible unless he opened our eyes or unless he allowed that imminence of his being to start moving on our emotions I know some of you are think wow emotion yeah you already hear them quotes I was reading to Carol last night about brother B talking about the presence of God moving on the emotions of the people and he'd watch it as it would move on the emotions of the people and it was the angel of God and he said it would pull them on their emotions and get them to a spot where they could receive something from the Lord we're human beings and we have emotions ain't nothing wrong with having emotions as long as the Holy Ghost is in control of them now watch so here God let the light shine in the face of Jesus Christ and then Paul goes on to say he is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature so the love of God revealed in Christ he was the visible representative of the invisible God 1 Timothy 1:1 17 now unto the king Eternal Immortal invisible the only wise God be honor and Glory forever and ever amen mea Elohim M eloim King Eternal the Jews call him the Eternal that's the way they knew him before they found out what his name was you see when he manifest himself to Moses he said I was made known to Abraham by this and by and but to Jacob by this and that he said but by my name I am I was not made know he said who am I going to say s he said tell them I am that I am has sent you what a peculiar name well now what if he would have said I don't I what if he would have said L El Elohim oh that's the way Abraham L El Elohim but he must bear the name of God that God says this is where I'm known I am that I am not I was that I was or I wish I was but I am that I am now remember who we talking about brother dony what are you trying to say I'm trying to get you to see who's in our midst today it's not just a repeat a Pentecost it's not a going back to methodism or baptism it is the Lord Jesus himself being in our midst anointing his men with his own presence to pull you out of the world and out of the darkness and eventually pull you out of yourself hallelujah king Eternal literally this word Malika oim is King of the ages King Eternal oh my and many of the Jewish blessings listen this which are usually rendered King of the the universe which is where they would use this Hebrew word now unto the king Eternal Immortal invisible invisible in contrast to the visible creation and also invisible in contrast to the visible Idols that man makes so your car your house your wife your husband your preacher your church every one of the idols that you've got in your life what are they they've all got a visible appearance your house come on somebody say amen your house your car your job think of all the things that we make Idols in our life and none of them have the power of invisibility there's only one there's only one who has this type of power oh my can I have a few more minutes 1 Timothy again chap 6 verse 16 who only hasth immortality dwelling in the light now remember he's the only be being that in the essence of himself is Immortal he's the only being that in the essence of himself is Immortal well you say brother Donnie we got eternal life that's right we do but we don't have it of ourself the devil does not have it of himself Angels did not have it of himself he's the only one the Eternal that has eternal life of him s oh I wish somebody would hear me this morning oh blessed be the Lord God who only has immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto Moses himself could only see a symbol of divine presence but the face of God has no man ever seen because he's infinite eternal and invisible how in the world are we ever going to get married to him so his his being is incomprehensible to us what if it's incomprehensible to our mind to be able to perceive it it would be totally incomprehensible for our eyes to pick him up unless of course he changed himself so if say he wanted to get married it would be up to him to make a form to get married in and one that we could be able to look at him reach over and take a hold of his hand and love him and touching you see we cannot directly look at the Sun for very long without causing us to go blind is that right now even though the sun is approximately 93 million miles from the earth yeah there could be a solar storm on the sun and it will cause our internet to drop out it will cause cycles and phases in our electric electric energy and our power and all that to Surge we just had one just a month or so ago you remember about it and they wasn't sure exactly what would happened but if we went today and we stood outside in the full sun and we looked and we looked and we looked eventually we would go blind by looking at it and yet the glory of the sun is not exactly the same thing as the Sun but you can hardly separate the two so God must make a form and come out of his glory now watch The Mighty God unveil before us talking about Moses he desired to see him one day and God told him go stand on the Rock and while standing on the Rock Moses seen him pass and he saw the back of a man and it looked like a man a man's back yet he did not see God he only seen the veil of God and you see the veil is always what blinds people don't you know if they would have known the Lord Jesus and they would have be able to look at him and say from his image come just penetrating rays of light and you couldn't even get around him oh my you know oh that that all know oh yes yes yes that's a mighty God that's that's Supernatural but father stepped from that when he stepped into that human Temple and they saw him cry like a man they saw him weep at the tomb of Lazarus they saw him set outside the city when he raised the Widow from name son and grown with a headache and they saw him take upon himself our human Affliction and they could not see the great rays that projected from him and all they saw was a man but he hid God same with you same with me same with his prophet in this day now notice the Bible said no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten of the father had declared him so Moses saw him veiled as a man now we find that Jehovah of the Old Testament with Jesus of the New Testament Dr scord here we find that his word changing from form so we find the word imor in Greek it means the Unseen was made visible something we know it's there it cannot be seen but yet you know it's there and when the change is formed the amorph which mean that it changed from Supernatural to Natural so when it changed from Supernatural to Natural then we oh okay I I see that I I I see that yeah right I I can see that now so when was it real or truth when you saw it or was it not the same essence of Truth before you saw it you understand it was truth before you ever saw it it was reality before you ever saw it but you were just allowed to see it at a certain time you see God dwells in that infinite Glory which no man has ever seen no man has ever seen it God out of that Glory has to Step Beyond That Glory or it would blind even the elected let me close here shortly so the son of man had to come in the last days now remember I'm talking about Jesus but it would appear again in an Old Testament form it would be a light say look about like that taken over somebody's head then it would be that was a fire by night in Houston in 1950 then it would appear in 1963 as a cloud by day same God that's right well praise the lord well you say brother Donnie where is he he's still here well where well one place right here this morning he's been over in France as I said he's been in Africa he's been in India already this day nurturing and Gathering his people together to allow them to feed on his unfailing body word so you see what an an opportunity and yet a responsibility that preachers have to try to bring something to the people that you can be able to Feast on something that is great than us oh you I could never sat under a preacher that talked over the top of my head so in other words all you want me to preach is everything that you know someone told me some time ago it's been a good good while back and they said you know I I I go to this certain certain church here because because uh my my pastor and me is on the same level I said he never preaches above you oh no no no no he preaches right where I'm at I said how you ever going to grow in God how in the world are you ever going to go and got it if your first grade teacher taught you first grade stuff and then your second grade teacher taught you what your first grade teacher got you and then your third grade teacher taught you what your first grade teacher and on and on and on and you come up to the 12th grade and you've heard first grade stuff for the last 12 years and now you're going to college come on you got to be kidding me so some people want said under that type of a Ministry a lot of made him call in the first place and they're still telling us how to get saved I don't need to know how to get saved I got saved years ago I don't need to know how to get Sanctified I know how to get Sanctified I want to get out of this world because it's fixing to be blown up by atomic bombs I've got to have a message that will change my body it ain't enough to tell me about the cross tell me about the man that changed [Applause] himself so can you imagine the valid dictorian of that class so he's going to stand up there and he's going to drag out his primer book we sure always glad all come today man I'm telling you what we've been through 12 years of Hell on this Earth Lord have mercy I remember it was 1+ one and 1+ one and then they moved us up to 2 plus two I want to tell you one thing I've been in this whole s school system for the last 12 years and I'll tell you what I know 1 + one is two and 2 + 2 is four and that's how come I'm the valid dictorian cuz nobody else didn't know what one plus one was but what do you do when you're picking out the valedictorian you don't pick out the guy but only went to school for lunch you don't pick out the girl that only went to school to find a boyfriend and for recess but you find those that have excelled above what everybody else excelled at that's why they're called the valid dictorian and they're able to stand up there and you can tell by listening to them they know more than one plus one well I'm going to tell you tonight God is the only one that can take one plus one plus one and the answer is still one because he ain't three he ain't four he ain't five but he is one Deuteronomy 4:35 unto thee it was show that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God and he is here looking for a bride that he can get inside out that he can walk through he can heal through he can live through and he and Mary Hallelujah and then he will bring your invisibility cuz you see there's also a part of us that's invisible I don't have this essence of my own the invisibility part but many years ago I was down in Kentucky still living there we had been to the message in a few years me and Carol lived in a single wide trailer I was on the far end where the bedroom was and I heard a noise down the hall and I looked down that hallway and I saw me in another form I heard from my theophany I figured after I got the end the service y'all think I was a nut so if you want to vote me out it's okay if we are part of him there's a part of us that never died can never die there's a part of us that never started it actually is it word brother R rotated off of his being there's a part of him inside of you today that is total invisibility and you know as well as I do science has looked at this movie makers have looked at it they've looked at that invisible part making man to walk through walls make man to do this that other Hollywood's done it years and years ago why cuz there was a truce laying there can you imagine the Lord Jesus and the apostles are gathered together and they're there still mourning and talking about all the different things and the Lord Jesus just walks right through the wall in a glorified body how do you reckon the Saints on Resurrection morning is going to walk in your house you think they're going to ring the doorbell when the prophet said you're standing there and all of a sudden they appeared before you so you see their bodies is so moved up and stepped up that they're no longer hindered by tues and insulation and brick and stone and vinyl Hallelujah I'll tell you one thing I've said it before I'm going to have a bunch show up at my house on Resurrection morning I buried a lot of saints down through the age I plan on saying a whole bunch of them I am going to have a jubilee that may be one of the things that pushes me p over the edge where I'm going to be chained because I'll see sister clark come down to the oh Lord help us she'll say oh Lord help us here we come there'll be one after the other after the other there's going to be my beautiful little daughter after she visits your all's house Lance I give you credit for that there she's going to step into mine and Carol's bathroom or bedroom or wherever we are mama and daddy let's go home Hallelujah what's going to happen I am going to be chained by the power of God I won't have to raise the garage door I won't have to open the front door or the back door or climb out of window but my body will be transformed and I will walk right through that wall why because visibility and invisibility have merged together I have taken on the image of my husband [Applause] let's stand I ain't got enough time going on Psalms 104:2 who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who stretches out the heavens like a curtain you know scientists have increased now what they feel like the number of stars are in the known Galaxy to one septian anybody know what that number is that is a one with 21 zeros but a few years ago they estimated it'd be so many thousand so many millions it's amazing how science is moving on and we're in that astronaut age praise the Lord and yet some folks has want to take us back to the airplane I'll tell you one thing I don't like flying maybe some of y'all do brother Allan butcher which flew the 767 he told me brother Donnie it ain't natural to fly and I thought if this is a Delta pilot telling me that Jesus said lo I be with you a lot of them want to take us back to the 737 days in the 747 days the prophet has already G us the countdown we're in the space tube Jesus Christ we're not going to get out of this world by flying out on Pentecostal Wings come on somebody don't get quiet don't get mad you know I believe in a Pentecostal experience but I am not going to take you back to isusa street we have moved Beyond that it never produced a Rapture in their day and it ain't going to produce it now but here we are in the astronaut tube and the countdown is going we're done past Ephesus samna pergamus we're done past all that where are we right at the very last remember remember the Ephesian Church age didn't start till 53 ad and yet the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost around 33 ad what were they for that first 20 years Alpha bride they were in a bride age Alpha time beginning time and the church AG started in 53 they preached the word and didn't even have a written bible that's right they raised the dead they healed the sick they cast out devils what was it the invisible Lord Jesus making himself visible look the bride age is not a new age it's not a separate age where we have to have a separate messenger it was that space of time before the church age began here we are when leosia and the bride age where we are last right at the very end time this last little section of time in the leosan time frame When God says I no longer call you church but I call you bride Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah 1 John 1: 15 this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all jumping down our brothers to Hebrews 1:2 hath in the last days spoken unto us by his son by whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being in the brightness of his glory and the excess oh Hallelujah Express image of his person brightness Aus gazma reflected brightness shoes of Christ that he perfectly reflects the Majesty of God effent shining force of a light coming from a luminous body the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person Express his character the instrument used for Engraving or carving so God wanted a family but he had to have a tool to use to grave them all outou or and carve on them so what did he make an image that come out of his Effigy of the brightness of his glory the mark stamped upon that instrument or WR on it hence a Mark or a figure burned in or a stamp on an impression the exact expression the image of a person or a thing marked likeness precise reproduction and every respect or a term that we can all relate to aess sin which we know it better as a facts so Jesus was the facts of God hallelujah and the bride is the facts of Jesus so God from Heaven faxed himself down on the earth in human form and on the day of Pentecost in the upper room the Lord Jesus said it's time for me to do what Daddy did what my father done now I'm going to fax myself so he faxed himself down in the day of Pentecost and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost oh children if you ain't got it today don't leave this place without it don't you love him with all your heart as the brightness of the sun is of the same nature as the Sun so when the sun came upon the Earth he kept talking about it talk about and Philip finally said Lord show us the father and it'll suffice us or or satisfies Jesus said have I been so long time with you and you don't know who I am let me close with this Sol in prison paragraph 116 may I put it like this the ministry of Jesus Christ reincarnated in his church in the last day that's what many of us believe I I believe with you don't you understand these poor blind message people when they speak against God's Ministry don't you us understand there they're going to stand before God and the Lord Jesus is going to judge them not because they rejected Donnie Reagan Daryl Ward Pete Lawson you know John Horn y some these other preachers brother Michael brother Joe no they rejected Jesus Christ Christ cuz it's him in another form it's him and you in Bride form Hallelujah my wife standing here today many of y'all have prayed for us she had her surgery and she's doing much better I thank you for that I've had needs during the same time frame I've had to preach on how many times and you know I've been dealing with all kinds of burdens all kinds of this that and the other but if you only had five minutes a day to pray I'd rather you pray for her than you would for me that's the way I feel about her so the way you treat the wife of the Lord Jesus yes sir imagine when you stand before him that day and he'll say come here Wason do you want the what yeah you y you went to that church that Word of Life Church down there didn't you all just help put a cement floor and one of my churches over in Zimbabwe cuz my children had been going to church there for about 12 years and all they had was a dirt floor and every time they'd go to shouting it was a LED of red dust moving through that place and they'd get all choked up boy they had a hard time I want to thank you for doing that cuz when you paid for that concrete floor in there you done that for me oh y'all y'all went to that church out that's right it was it was called Happy Valley wasn't it that's right it was called Happy Valley that's right yeah you all built y'all built 42 churches actually didn't you and Uganda yeah and I won't tell you how many more and one day when we stand before the Lord you think I want to get the credit for all that I'm simply just a funnel let it go soon you're going to stand up pray for the Lord and say thank you for building that church for me thank you for building that church as over in India they got churches over in India and Africa and all over the world called Happy Valley they need to update don't they I got an email from one of the brothers not long ago said brother Donnie why'd y'all change the name of your church I said well brother the name of the church was Happy Valley because that was the community that we lived in but we still carry the same spiritualism even though we change the name cuz we're still happy in the valley when we do get down in the valley so I said okay well praise the Lord now I understand why think of it when you walk before God and the books are open and everything there to your account you say I never done that I never even and he'll say when you done it to the least of these you done it to me don't you love him church I wish we could keep that in our mind every day I think we treat one another nicer I think we'd be more lovely and more you know the way the Lord wants us to BEP it Lord Jesus father how we what do we say the great almighty God in our midst today we must be getting closer and closer to going home for you want us to be AED by your presence I know there's probably some here today saying oh I come to church going through the Office trial ever was and I was looking for a word from God and man he didn't already say nothing about what I thought he should say job probably thought the same thing whenever you come down and said job I want you to stand up and G yourself like a man CU I'm going to speak to you and you said where was you when I laid the foundations of the earth and you begin to climb above job as it was as Papa eagle and show him your strength and your might that actually lifted job out of his trial where he was Lord as I've been studying on this this week I have just been overwhelmed to think that such a being would even take time from me a being so awesome that he has eternal life on his own Essence that he's so great that angels would look dirty to him he's so great that he has to step down and step down and step down and step down again and again for humans to even to start comprehending him a little bit and yet as we read in the scriptures when your people will go into hardships you will burdened for I pray you'd help each one here today Father to realize I ask you father that those that have lost loved ones I know some are still grieving some's still grieving for several years after their husbands or their wives have been taken and sometime they may feel you're so far away but may these scriptures that we've shared with them today help them to realize I cannot believe that you look at the Agony and the loneliness of sister Linda Nunley and sister Linda bab and brother Tom horac and children that have lost their mom I can't believe that you look at the Parker girls and Lance and it does not move your heart I can't believe that you look at my wife as we were driving down the road the other day and she bursted out in tears years and said I'd give anything to see her and as I looked across the car and I thought God I wish I was something I could say but how can I when I'm feeling the same way but I think we know you well enough to know that when we go through these things you're moved it's not like that you're this great Eternal that don't even con concern himself with our problems and our losses in life sometimes Jesus we just need to know that you care hallelujah oh great Jehovah God May every individual that has a need here today those that have streamed the service some Lord I hear getting up in Africa 3:00 in the morning to stream and be a part of our services dear God may you minister to them there Lord today every need of every individual father you're not so great and so mysterious this is what makes you so great to us that such a being would be concerned about us father we long to be where you [Music] are I've always wanted to go to heaven since I heard about it as a little boy my heart's been broken many times Lord as I preached so many funerals losing my mama my daddy my sister my grandma's Grandpa's Aunts Uncles sheep but I have to be honest Lord the greatest loss was my daughter and each one of those made me want to go to heaven more oh but Lord God we still want to remain here in this world as long as you desire us to be would you mind coming down lord Jesus in this service put your arms around the widows the widower the motherless children the fatherless Lord hallelujah the sick the wounded The Afflicted oh Jehovah God we worship you Lord can we just raise our hands in his presence now friend you know what you have need of now maybe you're doing pretty good right now maybe you've come out of

care to pray for others here in the church today as we're going to join our faith [Music] Together We Worship You Lord Jesus before we ask you for one thing we want to worship you and magnify your name for we were lost and you found us we was wretched we were blind we were naked we come and couldn't come into the presence of the king in our state but you moved on us Lord Jesus but you know how we are as Mortals we still have needs we need you today Lord Lord these meetings coming up this week you know the people that'll be gathered here from all the different places we need you father but

no more help me God that I can preach you so mighty so big so awesome so wonderful that they'll walk out of here feeling like they can do anything because with you and their lives they truly can amen anything that you called them to do we worship you Lord Jesus would you do me a favor would you mind let your hand maybe over on the shoulder of an individual standing by you if it's if it's a sister brother you don't feel comfortable in doing that you just move about if you'd like move move out if you don't feel comfortable if you don't feel comfortable laying your hand on someone else's shoulder you just stand there and pray for them I don't believe this just lays in the preacher I believe it lays in the body and I know there's people in this place today that have just as much Holy Ghost as I've got and you're just as ordained into eternal life praise the Lord Jesus the prophet would have people to do this and he would say eagle to Eagle thank you Lord God maybe that eagle you got your hands on they're in a very low spot in their life it's been many days since they felt the presence of the Lord they've been going through such a dark Valley they're beak is all crusted over as Brother David soer spoke to us several weeks ago when he was here they can't rise to fly and make a fresh kill but it might be through your prayer today that the Lord Jesus we just let the anointing Channel Through you while you're praying for him let's pray together shall we now Lord we're not asking you for ourselves we're praying for one another Lord Jesus I'm asking you as the shepherd be mindful of my sheep today those that you have committed to my charge Lord God I realize in one way I stand in a dreadful place today for a man to have to answer for one more soul of another individual other than himself it's such a fearful thing and yet Lord there's hundreds of souls here today that I've got to stand before you and answer for I don't approach it LLY Lord I approach it with reverence fear in my heart I would to God it was not my place but Lord Jesus it's Fallen my lot so I'm standing here with them now father in your presence and we have our hands laid one upon the other maybe there's some that's sick some that's weary Lord maybe some of them it's been a long time since they felt your presence they've been going through a real low spot lately Lord would you just come by Lord Jesus would you come near him today Father and just let them know that you still love them you still care for them Minister healing Minister encouragement oh Jesus we worship you today Father thank you Lord thank you Lord Praise Your Holy Name father now we lift our voices to you and say thank you we believe you Lord that there will be people that will be testifying that they got healed right here in this service today they don't even have to have a preacher to lay hand on them sure we will do that if that's what the that's the ction of their face but I believe eventually whenever that time will hit the earth we will bring people to a place that they'll be able to believe as the Centurion did speak the word and my servant will live Lord God May that happen in Word of Life Lord Jesus May that anointing so strick our hearts that we don't have to have a visit Visible man with a visible suit on with a visible tie and a visible preacher oh I know sometimes we need the god of skin on it but Lord may my faith rise to that realm of invisibility that I can touch an invisible God that my faith Lord Jesus for whatever I have need of can bring it to me today Lord we worship you father Hallelujah can we raise our hands friends in the presence of the king brother Jason would you lead us in some songs here this morning brother let's just worship now don't think service is done now now
