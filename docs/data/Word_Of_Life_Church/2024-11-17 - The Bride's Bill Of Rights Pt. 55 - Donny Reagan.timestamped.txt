[41:30] life to you today Father for a life of
[41:33] service in the name of Jesus we pray
[41:36] amen
[41:40] amen praise the
[41:44] lord conratulations
[41:52] we stand today and we'll turn to the
[41:54] Book
[41:55] of Genesis
[42:00] no kidding
[42:04] Genesis praise the Lord is an awesome
[42:06] day to be a Christian serving the lord
[42:09] living for him
[42:11] today praise God Genesis chapter
[42:16] 1 verse
[42:20] 14 and God said let there be lights in
[42:24] the firmament of the heaven
[42:27] to divide the day from the night and let
[42:31] them be for
[42:32] signs and for
[42:34] seasons and for
[42:37] days and for
[42:40] years now s Moses covers the big scope
[42:44] of everything first and then he breaks
[42:48] it down in a few more verses here let
[42:52] there be lights in the firmament which
[42:55] is the expanse of the heaven to divide
[42:59] the day from the night and let them be
[43:02] for signs look at the meaning of this
[43:05] word
[43:06] signal a distinguishing Mark
[43:11] Banner
[43:13] token ins
[43:15] sign or also a
[43:17] standard so the lights in the heavens
[43:21] are going to be for a token or a sign or
[43:24] a standard Manor standard is something
[43:26] that that is used to measure other
[43:29] things
[43:30] by and for seasons and for days and
[43:35] years now look at verse 15 and let them
[43:39] be for lights in the firmament of the
[43:42] heaven to give
[43:44] light upon the
[43:49] Earth
[43:50] H
[43:52] so the Earth is going to be the focus of
[43:57] a lot of what God is
[43:59] doing yet by far not the biggest not the
[44:04] brightest but his choice and you see
[44:07] that's what makes all the
[44:09] difference so the
[44:11] Earth is the only one whose name is in
[44:15] the Book of Life you won't find Mars
[44:19] Pluto Saturn Neptune Uranus now the rest
[44:23] of those planets and all those that have
[44:25] been found now but
[44:28] Earth to give light upon
[44:32] Earth and it was
[44:36] so now watch him there breaks it down in
[44:39] categories and God made two great
[44:43] lights the greater light to rule the day
[44:47] which is what we know is the sun and the
[44:50] Lesser light which is the Moon to rule
[44:54] the
[44:55] night he made the
[44:58] Stars
[45:00] also I get overwhelmed every time I look
[45:02] at this word and I click on
[45:05] it look what it is it's kokab which is
[45:10] of
[45:11] Messiah
[45:16] Brothers of Messiah Brothers
[45:21] numerous
[45:24] progeny personification
[45:27] God's omn
[45:29] missence which is figurative of course
[45:32] God made the two great lights the
[45:34] greater light to Rule the Day the Lesser
[45:37] light to rule the night he made the
[45:40] Stars
[45:43] also Genesis is overwhelming really
[45:47] because it
[45:49] condenses
[45:51] unbelievable amount of things that was
[45:54] happening and it sounded like it was
[45:57] just Bam Bam
[45:58] Bam but in this this little verse and he
[46:03] made the Stars
[46:05] also quite simple quite
[46:09] Compact and
[46:12] yet the estimated number of stars and
[46:16] the visible
[46:18] universe so far that have been seen
[46:23] one septian
[46:27] that's a one with
[46:31] 21
[46:33] zeros behind
[46:35] it and God made the
[46:40] Stars so far over two
[46:43] trillion
[46:46] galaxies that they found two
[46:51] trillion
[46:54] galaxies and what was your problem s
[46:57] that was so big today that you thought
[46:59] just no
[47:01] way and think who made this your
[47:06] father thank you
[47:09] Lord makes me feel ashamed sometimes
[47:11] don't it you I great he
[47:15] is and listen how Moses says in verse 17
[47:18] and
[47:20] God
[47:22] set
[47:24] them God
[47:26] set them in the firmament of the
[47:30] heaven to give light upon the Earth
[47:33] notice again he mentions the Earth
[47:35] again to rule over the day and over the
[47:39] night and to divide the light from the
[47:42] darkness and God
[47:45] saw that it was
[47:50] good Genesis 2 verse
[47:54] 1 thus the heavens
[47:59] and the
[48:00] Earth were
[48:02] finished would you notice how that Moses
[48:05] puts the Earth in a different category
[48:08] from the heavens the heavens and the
[48:12] Earth the heavens and the Earth were
[48:16] finished and
[48:19] all the
[48:20] host of them which is
[48:24] saal that which Goes Forth
[48:27] an
[48:29] army an army war Warfare host a
[48:36] host of an
[48:38] organized
[48:43] Army over one
[48:46] septian in the army of
[48:50] God and you realize not a one of them
[48:53] has ever caused him one
[48:58] problem in my little short life brother
[49:01] Phillip of 68
[49:03] years I have caused him more
[49:06] heartache more
[49:09] trouble than trillions of
[49:13] galaxies and yet I can give him
[49:16] something that all of those Stars
[49:20] cannot they cannot love
[49:23] him they serve his
[49:25] purpose but they're made to do so what
[49:29] difference between me and them and and
[49:31] you
[49:32] is I choose to do
[49:37] so they were made to do so we choose to
[49:42] do
[49:44] so and many he has a need in your heart
[49:47] today a
[49:51] request Heavenly Father
[49:56] we are so
[49:58] humbled at your
[50:04] greatness I pray today father that your
[50:07] blessings would be upon the
[50:11] word that should help me to be able to
[50:13] get out of the way
[50:16] Lord I'm not here today to belittle what
[50:20] your children are going through because
[50:22] they're many of them suffering
[50:23] tremendous things facing terrible
[50:27] battles and things in their
[50:29] lives but yet Lord if I could
[50:32] somehow be able to show
[50:35] them maybe just a little bit
[50:39] greater of what you
[50:41] are I think it would help them to bring
[50:45] it all into
[50:46] perspective that no matter how big our
[50:49] problems are how big our issues are and
[50:52] our troubles you are so much greater
[50:55] than them all
[50:58] father I have this prayer cost in my
[50:59] hand today Lord you see our sister Lord
[51:03] that this is going to you see the
[51:06] problems that she's having in her body
[51:08] and we're agreeing together as the
[51:11] saints of God lord Jesus that she's
[51:14] going to be completely delivered and
[51:16] made well of
[51:18] this anoint me Lord and anoint your
[51:21] people speak to us the words of life in
[51:26] the name of
[51:27] Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless
[51:31] you you may be
[51:37] seated I want to speak to you today on
[51:40] the
[51:42] right to be in divine
[51:47] order the
[51:49] right to be in divine
[51:53] order let's
[51:57] look now
[51:59] about our father
[52:01] and how great he
[52:04] is some people the way they view God
[52:09] they resent
[52:11] anything about
[52:13] order and
[52:15] structure and things that are put
[52:20] together it's like some people view
[52:24] order as Robin them of a element of
[52:28] their freedom they look at structure
[52:32] they look at things put together and it
[52:36] running on a methodical pattern and they
[52:41] look at that as if somehow it takes away
[52:45] from the great Supernatural or the
[52:49] phenomenon but yet our God is a god of
[52:55] structure and God of
[52:58] order so he doesn't just make things and
[53:01] let them run as they will he doesn't
[53:06] choose any of us and says well just do
[53:10] whatever you want to do try try to get
[53:12] to heaven as best you can um just live
[53:15] as close as you can to me and whenever
[53:18] it's all said and done whatever you give
[53:20] me I'll take and U I have no
[53:23] requirements I have no no guidelines no
[53:26] set standards just do whatever you think
[53:29] is best now a lot of people have that
[53:33] that idea of God that they will do
[53:36] whatever they think they can and they'll
[53:38] wind up giving it to God and God is just
[53:40] so desperate God is so desperate for
[53:44] anybody that will just give him any
[53:46] attention at all that he'll just pretty
[53:48] much take whatever they give
[53:51] him that's not my
[53:53] God our God is is a god of divine order
[54:00] that being said it does not mean that in
[54:04] that order is not freedom and
[54:09] liberality but it never goes beyond the
[54:13] guidelines of the one who set it up so
[54:16] he structured a church he structured a
[54:20] body he structured the order of ministry
[54:24] he structured it in the Old Testament
[54:26] knowing that it would have a time limit
[54:28] on it that it would run for several
[54:31] thousand years and then there would be a
[54:34] new order that would replace it and we
[54:37] know even where we are now the order of
[54:41] grace mercy through the perpetuation of
[54:44] the blood of the Lamb of God that is a
[54:47] great divine order of God holy wonderful
[54:51] order but it too is only here for the SE
[54:56] season for one day we will no longer
[54:59] need blood between us and our father we
[55:03] couldn't stand to be able to be brought
[55:06] into his courts today in his presence
[55:10] without the value of a mediator there's
[55:13] no way we we would just die there's no
[55:15] way we can do it because our bodies are
[55:18] still marked by sin and we still bear
[55:22] mortality in us today so there's got to
[55:25] be something that will stand between us
[55:29] but I want you to think now for those
[55:31] saints of God that have gone beyond the
[55:33] curtain of time they no longer have that
[55:36] barrier that you and I are limited by
[55:38] today called Fai one day you will no
[55:42] longer need faith faith will actually be
[55:48] become sight and it will become reality
[55:53] now today we believe there is a God
[55:56] right so all that come to him must
[55:58] believe that he is and that he is a
[56:00] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[56:03] him but for those who have already
[56:05] entered into paradise and into his great
[56:08] presence they don't have to have a faith
[56:12] walk because they've already passed
[56:15] beyond the curtain of time and they have
[56:18] experienced reality in a form that you
[56:21] and I know absolutely nothing about so
[56:25] Fai will end in sight and then the Blood
[56:30] On The Mercy Seat will no longer be
[56:32] there as a matter of fact when the bride
[56:34] goes up in the Rapture it will be pulled
[56:37] from there it's only symbolic anyway but
[56:39] it will be pulled from there and no
[56:42] longer be needed to go between you and I
[56:46] in the presence of our Lord and for the
[56:48] first time in the Rapture will be able
[56:51] to walk up in the face of Jesus himself
[56:57] and look at him with our changed
[57:01] eyes touch him with our changed
[57:05] hands and himm reached back to
[57:08] us because this order that God has given
[57:13] us will have brought us to a higher
[57:16] place and we know that there was a
[57:18] levitical order in the old test but a
[57:21] prophecy of a new order in the new and
[57:25] it was going to be a priesthood after
[57:28] the order of MDC right so God will have
[57:35] a new order of a priesthood just to let
[57:38] you know we're already in it so whenever
[57:42] God before he ever brought human life
[57:46] upon the Earth and then Moses being
[57:50] channeled by God to to pull into this
[57:53] Avenue wherever he was
[57:56] whenever he started seeing all these
[57:59] things and he looked out across what
[58:02] scientists call the elliptical plane now
[58:07] remember on the earth since the Earth is
[58:10] placed in this certain part of the
[58:13] universe everything looks different from
[58:16] the earth than it would from any other
[58:19] planet now for those of you that have
[58:21] traveled in different parts of the world
[58:23] and you would look at the Zodiac here
[58:26] and then you would look at the Zodiac in
[58:28] Europe or if you've been to New Zealand
[58:30] or Australia and you look at it and the
[58:33] stars and their patterns they will look
[58:35] a little bit different for those of you
[58:37] that are privileged to be able to see
[58:39] the Northern Lights in Canada or in in
[58:42] Norway and some of those places like
[58:44] that and you see how different that the
[58:46] stars and the placement of the stars
[58:48] look according to where you're standing
[58:51] on earth now remember they are there for
[58:54] signs for season for days to divide the
[58:58] light from the darkness and all that so
[59:01] depending on where you are on the earth
[59:02] and you look up and see the exact same
[59:04] Stars you might see them in a little
[59:07] different way having been out in Arizona
[59:10] and some of the places and the parts of
[59:11] the Earth where there isn't as much
[59:14] population and light pollution it's
[59:17] amazing how many stars are there right
[59:20] in our our skies every night but we
[59:23] don't see them because we have so much
[59:25] light
[59:26] pollution now whenever God wrote them of
[59:29] course and put them there because they
[59:30] were his first Bible there was no light
[59:34] upon the Earth so the brighter the light
[59:37] gets upon the Earth the more it takes
[59:40] away from the glory and the Brilliance
[59:43] that's in the heavens so some of the
[59:45] greatest telescopes that man has upon
[59:48] the Earth are in some of these places
[59:50] where there isn't any man-made
[59:53] denomination I I mean uh man-made
[59:57] light because man-made light will
[1:00:01] distract from Heavenly light you see
[1:00:05] that's what always gets people in
[1:00:07] trouble when it comes to them looking at
[1:00:10] the word and trying to understand the
[1:00:13] word because they're looking at it from
[1:00:15] The Grandfather's light or their father
[1:00:18] or their mother or their uncle or their
[1:00:20] aunt and they're always reading the
[1:00:23] divine order through tradition or church
[1:00:27] entity and it always hinders us every
[1:00:32] time now let me let me just go back here
[1:00:34] to Genesis 1:16 again and God made two
[1:00:39] great lights the greater light to Rule
[1:00:43] the Day and the Lesser light to rule the
[1:00:46] night he made the Stars also and God set
[1:00:51] them in the firmament now let me share
[1:00:54] these numbers with you again estimate
[1:00:56] suggests that there are about one
[1:00:58] septian stars in the universe and I said
[1:01:02] it was 21 zeros but it's actually 24 so
[1:01:05] a one and 24 zeros and an estimated
[1:01:11] estimated two
[1:01:13] trillion galaxies now by the way that
[1:01:16] scientists have been able to measure
[1:01:19] what they call the observable universe
[1:01:23] now that is only what they've been able
[1:01:25] to to see them they use gamma rays and
[1:01:28] they use other X-rays and things like
[1:01:31] that and they will send them out as far
[1:01:34] as that Ray can travel and then it will
[1:01:38] turn and come back and they measure the
[1:01:41] distance from where it leaves its
[1:01:43] original point back and then they time
[1:01:46] it how far it is now watch this the
[1:01:49] observable universe is
[1:01:52] approximately
[1:01:54] 93 billion
[1:01:56] ion light years in
[1:02:00] diameter
[1:02:01] 93 billion light years in Diamond now
[1:02:05] listen how big in a lightyear is if you
[1:02:07] forgot it since you went to school a
[1:02:09] lightyear the distance light can
[1:02:13] travel in one Earth's year is
[1:02:20] 5.88
[1:02:22] trillion miles
[1:02:26] so in one year light will travel
[1:02:30] 5.88 trillion miles and so far the
[1:02:36] observable universe is 93 billion light
[1:02:41] years so you take 93 billion and
[1:02:46] multiply it by
[1:02:48] 5.88
[1:02:51] trillion and you're going to blow your
[1:02:53] calculator all two pieces
[1:02:57] now that's just what they found so
[1:03:02] far I find it so amazing that they found
[1:03:06] all this out in our
[1:03:10] day sir in our day you see they started
[1:03:16] they looked at the stars way on back and
[1:03:19] they looked at him in a very primitive
[1:03:22] form but in this day the mysteries of
[1:03:27] the universe and the stars and all that
[1:03:31] they found so far it's just incredible
[1:03:34] because it's unfolded in the same time
[1:03:37] frame that God sent an Angelic message
[1:03:41] down from
[1:03:43] heaven and a releasing of an anointing
[1:03:46] from Heaven on the earth to take a
[1:03:50] people back to their origin which is in
[1:03:54] heaven so while God is doing this great
[1:03:58] thing on the Earth and then science
[1:04:00] always forer runs what God is doing on
[1:04:04] the earth is that right so we live in
[1:04:07] the age of
[1:04:09] astronauts astronauts so then they send
[1:04:13] out their their Hubble and then once
[1:04:16] they got it out there they didn't
[1:04:17] realize that the Hubble Tes scope had to
[1:04:21] have something similar to glasses put on
[1:04:25] it
[1:04:26] because it was unable to focus and do
[1:04:29] what they needed it to do and then they
[1:04:31] had to send some people out there to
[1:04:34] readjust its lenses and they likened it
[1:04:37] to putting a set of glasses on the
[1:04:40] telescope and by that in the last how
[1:04:43] many every years that it's been there
[1:04:45] it's opened up an entire new realm and
[1:04:49] what they were able to do and they
[1:04:51] thought they could never surpass that
[1:04:54] until of course they made the new one
[1:04:57] and now they've sent it out there and
[1:05:00] it's blowing away the previous Church
[1:05:03] ages before
[1:05:06] it now remember the signs are there for
[1:05:10] Stars the Stars rather for signs and
[1:05:15] tokens and visible say of God writing
[1:05:19] his Bible so if it's going on up there
[1:05:22] and the observable universe and remember
[1:05:25] it's still
[1:05:27] expanding now when life travels it's
[1:05:31] still
[1:05:33] ongoing it's not like that it's ever
[1:05:36] actually
[1:05:38] stopped when he said let there be
[1:05:43] light it has never stopped from the time
[1:05:46] he said
[1:05:47] that so if time would car another 100
[1:05:51] years or 200 years and they would break
[1:05:53] into it more and more and they would
[1:05:55] measured as a matter of fact they've
[1:05:57] already proved it by the scientific
[1:05:59] research from back in
[1:06:01] 1959 to where we are now that from the
[1:06:05] measurable difference of the on the
[1:06:07] elliptical plane and by using what's
[1:06:10] this the radius of the visible universe
[1:06:14] according to calculations the current
[1:06:17] comoving distance to particles from
[1:06:21] which the cosmic microwave background
[1:06:24] and you saw you just use them in your
[1:06:27] house the microwave background radiation
[1:06:31] was emitted which represents the radius
[1:06:34] of the visible
[1:06:36] universe is about
[1:06:39] 14.0 billion
[1:06:42] parex
[1:06:45] 45.7 billion light
[1:06:51] years everybody got what I've said so
[1:06:54] far
[1:06:56] I was going to say those of you who
[1:06:57] raise your hand I'm going to have you to
[1:06:58] stand and repeat
[1:07:02] it now what does this mean to most of us
[1:07:06] absolutely
[1:07:10] nothing do this sister is going to help
[1:07:12] you make better pancakes I doubt it
[1:07:15] better beans and cornbread and maters
[1:07:17] and ters
[1:07:19] no but hopefully it will overwhelm you
[1:07:26] to realize how
[1:07:29] great our God
[1:07:33] is and to think that nothing moves up
[1:07:37] there out of
[1:07:40] cater the only thing that has ever
[1:07:43] caused him
[1:07:45] problems are those
[1:07:47] beings that he
[1:07:49] put on free moral
[1:07:53] agency you see all these things that
[1:07:55] I've read to you so far today not a one
[1:07:59] of them have a
[1:08:01] soul not a one of them have a
[1:08:05] choice a mind to reason and think well I
[1:08:08] I don't think that makes sense I I don't
[1:08:10] think God wants that I don't think they
[1:08:13] can't
[1:08:15] think they were
[1:08:18] made to do all this great
[1:08:21] glory and he hasn't had one problem with
[1:08:25] one of them none of them have ever
[1:08:28] caused him any issues let's read Hebrews
[1:08:33] 1
[1:08:34] one God who had sunry times and diverse
[1:08:37] manner spake in time pass unto the
[1:08:40] fathers by the prophets has in these
[1:08:43] last days spoken unto us by his
[1:08:48] son whom he has appointed
[1:08:50] heir of All Things by whom also
[1:08:56] he
[1:08:57] made the
[1:08:59] world's
[1:09:04] plural the
[1:09:06] world's
[1:09:08] plural and man Einstein broke into what
[1:09:12] understanding he had in his day and
[1:09:14] believe it or not they've surpassed
[1:09:18] Einstein Hebrews
[1:09:21] 11:3 and when he looked at where that
[1:09:24] broke into eternity if they could send
[1:09:26] something out so far from the earth and
[1:09:29] measure it by time and how many millions
[1:09:32] of light years it would be out in the
[1:09:36] universe and then come back to the
[1:09:39] Earth it would only be gone just a few
[1:09:43] years and Einstein said there's only one
[1:09:47] answer for that they broke into
[1:09:51] eternity and when they ask him how could
[1:09:53] it be he said there was one only one
[1:09:58] explanation through faith we understand
[1:10:02] the worlds were
[1:10:04] framed by the word of God
[1:10:07] Amen worlds not
[1:10:10] one
[1:10:12] plural the worlds were framed by the
[1:10:16] word of God so that things which are
[1:10:19] seen were not made of
[1:10:22] things which do appear
[1:10:26] so all this matter and mass and black
[1:10:29] holes and time and all of that where did
[1:10:31] it come from
[1:10:36] nowhere where'd God get the Magnesium
[1:10:39] the iron the atomic fire that's in the
[1:10:43] Sun every day that and we're setting on
[1:10:46] a molten ball of it upon the Earth where
[1:10:48] did all that come from the Sun s so n
[1:10:53] yeah for by him
[1:10:56] God
[1:10:57] created all things what was the son the
[1:11:01] word so when God spoke he gave birth and
[1:11:05] out of his existence come his creative
[1:11:09] word which is the son s o
[1:11:13] n and by him all things were
[1:11:18] created a brother Ram is on a hunting
[1:11:23] trip greatest battle ever fall tells us
[1:11:26] about it and him and the brothers was
[1:11:29] looking up at the night
[1:11:32] skies and I imagine being out there in
[1:11:36] Arizona I've hunted some of that same
[1:11:39] territory there and it's quite
[1:11:41] phenomenal when you get out there and
[1:11:42] you go to looking up uh what what you
[1:11:46] see and he said I I said somewhere now
[1:11:49] he's talking to the brothers I had
[1:11:50] pointed out to me one time in an
[1:11:53] observatory the Zodiac beginning with
[1:11:55] the Virgin coming over through the
[1:11:56] cancer age on down until the last was
[1:11:58] the lion Leo the Lion the first coming
[1:12:01] of Christ the Virgin the second coming
[1:12:03] by the line of the tribe of Judah and I
[1:12:05] said I tried my
[1:12:07] best to see that zodiac and I can't see
[1:12:14] it I love his honesty don't
[1:12:17] you so here's someone who was trained to
[1:12:22] look at the stars and then through a
[1:12:25] telescope to be able to look up into the
[1:12:27] night skies and then maybe point it out
[1:12:31] to brother brandom and say now look
[1:12:32] here's here this that and the other
[1:12:34] unlike you and I today where we can
[1:12:38] download an
[1:12:40] app and hold our phone
[1:12:43] up I mean know what I'm talking about
[1:12:46] and it will be able to tell you exactly
[1:12:48] here and there and there so then if you
[1:12:50] have a telescope which my son-in-law
[1:12:52] Scotty does and then we've been able to
[1:12:54] get up there on their uh paved parking
[1:12:57] or driveway coming in and at night skies
[1:13:00] look up and take that and point you
[1:13:03] directly into where it is now look how
[1:13:06] much further it's Advanced now than it
[1:13:08] was even when brother Brandon was here
[1:13:10] so brother brandham was shown it and yet
[1:13:13] he by the naked eye looking out there in
[1:13:15] the night skies and he couldn't find it
[1:13:19] so what do we need we need
[1:13:22] direction direction to be able to look
[1:13:25] now it's there but it don't help us if
[1:13:29] we don't know which way to look now by
[1:13:32] the grace of God it's the same way with
[1:13:35] the godhead and the gospel and with the
[1:13:38] church now you know a lot of people they
[1:13:41] don't have a problem being identified
[1:13:44] with the church
[1:13:46] mystical but most people's problem is
[1:13:50] being identified with the church local
[1:13:56] the church mystical then they oh yeah
[1:14:00] absolutely I'm a Christian I'm born
[1:14:02] again I'm part of the body well where do
[1:14:05] you attend oh I don't go to church I I I
[1:14:08] don't attend church cuz I I really don't
[1:14:10] need to but I'm part of the body wow so
[1:14:14] they have no problem being identified
[1:14:17] with church mystical but they have a
[1:14:20] problem being identified with church
[1:14:23] local but if you're actually in church
[1:14:27] mystical you will be part of an
[1:14:30] assembly that's right and there's many
[1:14:32] people the stream our services and other
[1:14:34] brothers all over the world and the
[1:14:36] reason they're not in church is not
[1:14:38] because they believe they don't have to
[1:14:40] be but because circumstances will not
[1:14:42] allow them to be there they live in
[1:14:44] places where there are no churches and
[1:14:46] it's not their first choice to have to
[1:14:49] stream but they also are identified with
[1:14:53] an assembly now see so it's a miror
[1:14:56] reflection of the stars that are in the
[1:14:58] heavens now most of us have no we can't
[1:15:01] even relate to the Stars up there and
[1:15:03] the numbers and all that that I gave you
[1:15:05] some of you don't even remember them
[1:15:07] right now you definitely won't remember
[1:15:08] them over your lunch today because you
[1:15:11] can't really relate right we we just
[1:15:14] can't relate it's so far over the top of
[1:15:17] our head and that's just not where we
[1:15:19] live but yet I like to look at it myself
[1:15:22] because I see my life story I see your
[1:15:25] life story I see that the dragon will be
[1:15:29] got a hold of I see the Capricorn I see
[1:15:32] all of that in the mystery of God what a
[1:15:34] little bit that I've been able to look
[1:15:35] at it and see and understand so to me
[1:15:38] it's predominantly over me every day of
[1:15:41] my life that I am going to win in this
[1:15:45] Warfare because it's already declared in
[1:15:48] the heavens now remember what's going on
[1:15:51] on life now and on the earth and time it
[1:15:55] Falls to us hour by hour day by day week
[1:15:58] by week month by month but if you want
[1:16:00] to know how it's all going to end turn
[1:16:02] up this way and look at Leo the Lion and
[1:16:05] then we'll look at the water spout and
[1:16:07] we look at all the things that are up
[1:16:10] there and we see the end has already
[1:16:13] been declared from the beginning it's
[1:16:15] written in the
[1:16:17] stars now whatever then we look upon the
[1:16:20] Earth at oursel and you're the prophet
[1:16:22] was down on the earth and looking up and
[1:16:25] him and the brothers is out there and
[1:16:26] they said uh it was showed to me by the
[1:16:29] Zodiac and I've tried my best to see it
[1:16:31] and I just can't see it yet it's there
[1:16:34] those who are trained know it's there
[1:16:37] job saw it now remember when God come to
[1:16:40] job and and God quoted to job the Bible
[1:16:43] that job knew and God asked job about
[1:16:48] the constellations which was pades the
[1:16:51] Seven Sisters Orion so God qu oted to
[1:16:55] him even about
[1:16:57] Urus did you are you the one who
[1:17:00] controls Urus are you the one that does
[1:17:04] the plees and why in the world would God
[1:17:06] quote that to job because job was a
[1:17:09] stargazer so he watched how did the Magi
[1:17:13] able to follow the lord Jesus and get
[1:17:16] exactly when where he was born and yet
[1:17:19] King Herod didn't know nothing about it
[1:17:21] it was right under his own nose because
[1:17:24] Herod did not know how to look in the
[1:17:26] Stars well let me tell you something
[1:17:28] don't think that I'm crazy now this
[1:17:30] morning and think Lord have mercy
[1:17:32] brother Donnie studied so much he's went
[1:17:34] absolutely nuts you see that's one
[1:17:36] advantage that the bride has in every
[1:17:39] Church age is that we also follow the
[1:17:42] Stars so in the Book of Revelation we
[1:17:45] see the right hand of Jesus being open
[1:17:48] and we see seven stars in the right hand
[1:17:51] of our Lord Jesus and those Seven Stars
[1:17:55] point to us that there will be seven
[1:17:57] Messengers that will come on the earth
[1:17:59] and out of their ministry will come the
[1:18:02] reflected light from the S so n of God
[1:18:06] and it will lead the elect back to where
[1:18:09] they come from the rest of the world
[1:18:12] look at oh we don't believe in no church
[1:18:14] AG Messengers we don't believe in no
[1:18:16] prophets well I feel sorry for them but
[1:18:19] they just can't see the constellations
[1:18:22] of the church ages amen now watch the
[1:18:25] prophet goes on and he said man used to
[1:18:28] look at it because it was a Bible but in
[1:18:31] that whole great mass of millions and
[1:18:37] billions of light
[1:18:41] years now what I'd like to know is how
[1:18:44] did he know that before they started
[1:18:47] talking about
[1:18:51] it billions of
[1:18:53] liar they observable
[1:18:57] universe was not then what it is now as
[1:18:59] far as their
[1:19:03] knowledge so we have a
[1:19:06] Kian that did not go to NASA school or
[1:19:09] did not graduate from
[1:19:11] Harvard but talking in terms that
[1:19:15] scientists use today he could probably
[1:19:18] say it took you all long enough but you
[1:19:20] finally did get caught up
[1:19:25] now watch this in that whole great mass
[1:19:28] of millions and billions of light years
[1:19:32] God
[1:19:33] sets in the midst of it
[1:19:36] all and he looks down
[1:19:39] Paul is in there my
[1:19:43] mother is in there
[1:19:47] somewhere looking
[1:19:50] down and I thought of the order of that
[1:19:54] Heavenly
[1:19:56] Host now watch keep in mind and we're
[1:19:58] talking about the ride of divine order
[1:20:01] so it's not like these Stars they just
[1:20:03] go at random and they're upside down and
[1:20:05] sideways and you know one goes this way
[1:20:08] and one goes that way no they're
[1:20:09] everyone in an orbit in so much that our
[1:20:13] scientists will be able to tell us when
[1:20:16] there will be a solar eclipse or a lunar
[1:20:19] eclipse they'll be able to tell us
[1:20:21] pretty much the length of the days
[1:20:24] they'll have it now look at your Weather
[1:20:25] Channel they'll tell you when the sun
[1:20:27] will rise in the morning and they'll
[1:20:29] give you an approximate time of when the
[1:20:31] sun will set tomorrow afternoon and they
[1:20:34] can tell you out for years to come when
[1:20:38] a lot of these things will happen in the
[1:20:40] heavens why because they've studied it
[1:20:43] and it is so in order that they can
[1:20:47] forecast years and years to come when
[1:20:50] this and that and the other will happen
[1:20:53] is that right now now whenever it
[1:20:55] happens then then people on the Earth
[1:20:57] that love those sorts of things oh my uh
[1:21:00] a dear precious friend of mine brother
[1:21:01] Doug Baker from out in out in Tucson
[1:21:04] brother Doug Loves to to take photos and
[1:21:07] things of the eclipses and all that just
[1:21:09] this past year out in Arkansas and then
[1:21:12] went in different places and he's quite
[1:21:14] a quite a photographer and he's been
[1:21:16] able to get the one that is very rare
[1:21:19] and very occasional that it can be got
[1:21:21] but it's called the wedding ring I mean
[1:21:24] know what I'm talking about ever seen
[1:21:26] the picture of it few of you hardly none
[1:21:28] of you okay all right what whenever the
[1:21:30] eclipse comes upon the Earth and it's a
[1:21:33] certain time when the moon and the and
[1:21:35] the sun will come across the path and it
[1:21:38] reaches a certain spot and when it does
[1:21:41] if you have your camera right on it then
[1:21:44] the illumination from the outside forms
[1:21:47] a perfect circle and there will be a
[1:21:49] little tiny light right at the very top
[1:21:53] and it looks like a wedding
[1:21:57] ring
[1:21:59] ah a wedding
[1:22:02] ring so God wrote it up there in the
[1:22:05] scar in the stars and in the skies that
[1:22:09] the moon and the son would be husband
[1:22:13] and wife and every now and then God lets
[1:22:17] the sun Crown the moon with a wedding
[1:22:22] ring and it's written and the Stars so
[1:22:26] none of y'all have ever seen it well go
[1:22:28] online this evening Google will blow up
[1:22:30] after church morning go online and you
[1:22:33] can find it now why would God do such a
[1:22:36] thing which that is only visible from
[1:22:38] the earth now if you is up on Mars you'd
[1:22:41] never see it if you on Pluto you'd never
[1:22:44] see it you know you have to be at a
[1:22:46] certain place in a certain time frame to
[1:22:50] be able to see that the wedding is going
[1:22:53] on I just think when we were in our
[1:22:56] little denominations and even in some of
[1:22:58] our independent churches where many of
[1:23:00] them were just as bad as any
[1:23:01] denomination that was in the world we
[1:23:03] would never be able to see that there
[1:23:06] was a wedding going on but God called us
[1:23:09] out and opened our eyes and let us see
[1:23:13] there's a wedding going on and let me
[1:23:16] tell you today we are not going to the
[1:23:19] wedding we have already been wed we are
[1:23:23] going to the marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:23:26] because the wedding is going on right
[1:23:29] now we are joined together to our lord
[1:23:33] Jesus in an invisible Union praise be to
[1:23:38] God from all over the Earth from every
[1:23:41] nation every culture every race of
[1:23:45] people God is calling out a bride why
[1:23:49] because all of these stars that there in
[1:23:51] the heavens and this one that makes the
[1:23:53] sword of 9 and then nebulus 3:19 that's
[1:23:56] down on the bottom of it and it was
[1:23:58] actually there the light that you look
[1:24:01] at tonight when you look at the nebula
[1:24:03] which comes down from The Sword of The
[1:24:06] Swordsman on a Rion and you look in
[1:24:08] through that that light was actually
[1:24:10] started and left that nebula in the days
[1:24:14] of the Emperors of Rome it is that far
[1:24:18] away by the time it gets to us one day
[1:24:22] you will realize that Heaven is not a
[1:24:26] 100 billion light years away it's right
[1:24:29] here around us in another dimension our
[1:24:33] departed loved ones are not a billion
[1:24:36] light years away they are only 20 ft
[1:24:40] from where we are not only that your
[1:24:43] glorified body is right here in this
[1:24:47] building this morning and it's one to
[1:24:49] send a charge through you like a battery
[1:24:53] oh God let us get our jumper cables
[1:24:57] hooked up to our body what will it do it
[1:25:01] will unite us to the
[1:25:04] [Applause]
[1:25:17] groom I sought of the
[1:25:20] order of that Heavenly Host
[1:25:25] not one of them's out of
[1:25:30] place it's amazing what one child can do
[1:25:33] in a
[1:25:35] house right Harry it's amazing what one
[1:25:39] grandson can
[1:25:41] do everything is in order everything is
[1:25:44] in place and that one child comes in and
[1:25:47] in five minutes it's turned upside down
[1:25:49] and of course if you're a grandparent
[1:25:50] you just smile and laugh and acts like
[1:25:52] it's so wonderful
[1:25:55] as a matter of fact they say
[1:25:57] grandchildren are reward for not killing
[1:26:00] your
[1:26:07] kids brother Homer Longoria says the
[1:26:10] grandchildren were so Grand you wish you
[1:26:11] had had them first and forget them young
[1:26:17] ones but can you imagine our
[1:26:21] father and this is only an estimation of
[1:26:23] what they see has over one
[1:26:26] septian
[1:26:28] stars in the
[1:26:31] universe and not a one of
[1:26:33] them has ever broke
[1:26:37] time how many millions and billions of
[1:26:40] years have they been
[1:26:43] there and they're just going around and
[1:26:46] around what's their purpose to please
[1:26:50] him to serve him
[1:26:54] and to be able to
[1:26:56] actually for you to look at him and say
[1:27:01] wow wow a't that something and he says
[1:27:05] go ahead and join him kids enjoy
[1:27:08] him I put that out there for
[1:27:12] you when you would walk out there in the
[1:27:15] night and your battle so heavy and your
[1:27:16] trials so difficult and you think I
[1:27:19] don't know if I'll ever make it through
[1:27:20] this one or not that you could look up
[1:27:22] and say yes that star right there is the
[1:27:26] same one Adam looked at think of it the
[1:27:30] stars that you see at night Moses stood
[1:27:34] under them not so long ago Adam and Eve
[1:27:38] oh my his father would come down in the
[1:27:40] evening and the evening star would start
[1:27:43] settling in Adam and Eve would look at
[1:27:45] it it's the very same one you'll look at
[1:27:47] this afternoon that morning star that if
[1:27:50] you're up early enough in the morning
[1:27:52] and it comes out of their seat exact
[1:27:54] same one that Adam whatever he would
[1:27:57] awoke from a good night's rest in the
[1:27:59] Garden of Eden and stepped out there oh
[1:28:01] glory to God it was the very same star
[1:28:04] that Adam looked at the very same star
[1:28:07] that Joshua looked at the very same star
[1:28:10] when the Lord Jesus walked upon this
[1:28:12] Earth and he must have looked out there
[1:28:14] and looked at it and thought wow wow
[1:28:16] what a say in my word form I spoke all
[1:28:20] this into existence it's the same star
[1:28:24] is the same son that you look at at your
[1:28:26] church is the same one that he hurled
[1:28:29] out of his mouth millions of years ago
[1:28:32] the same one that Joshua when he stood
[1:28:34] there that day and say Moon stand still
[1:28:37] and son you stand still the very one
[1:28:41] that you will look at after church is
[1:28:43] the same one that Joshua
[1:28:52] stopped what's so sad for us is we just
[1:28:56] keep carrying our troubles carrying our
[1:28:59] problems trying to figure out our
[1:29:01] difficulties as if though it's left up
[1:29:05] entirely to
[1:29:08] us let me tell you today watch some of
[1:29:10] you ain't getting no victory over the
[1:29:11] things you're dealing with because
[1:29:13] you're trying to solve them
[1:29:16] yourself cuz there's something about as
[1:29:18] human beings it's one of the hardest
[1:29:20] things we can ever do is let things go
[1:29:26] let your hatred go it will destroy you
[1:29:30] if you
[1:29:32] don't if you don't let hard feelings go
[1:29:34] they will destroy you not only you but
[1:29:38] your children and their children and on
[1:29:40] down and on down you are making a way
[1:29:42] and setting a path for your children so
[1:29:45] if you hold resentment and pack that on
[1:29:48] down to another generation another
[1:29:50] generation you understand you're going
[1:29:51] to stand before God for Generations
[1:29:54] resentment generational hatred
[1:29:57] generational be the big people let it
[1:30:01] stop here come on somebody let's not
[1:30:05] carry on we don't want to be like people
[1:30:08] that if feuded down Through the Ages
[1:30:10] let's lay aside and be the bride forgive
[1:30:15] [Applause]
[1:30:28] I thought listen to this how he relates
[1:30:30] this God's Great
[1:30:32] Army and I thought of the
[1:30:36] soldiers so he views the
[1:30:39] stars as
[1:30:42] soldiers I thought of the soldiers and
[1:30:44] how do that Moon would happen to get out
[1:30:47] of order the Earth would be covered
[1:30:50] again with water in just a few minutes
[1:30:54] the Earth should be just like it was
[1:30:55] when God decided to use it to have us
[1:30:59] here on it it was without form and void
[1:31:01] and darkness and water was upon the
[1:31:03] breadth of the earth and if that Moon
[1:31:05] would ever
[1:31:07] move it would do the same thing
[1:31:11] again now look at the order of the stars
[1:31:14] and we all know of course by the tides
[1:31:17] and how the Moon it don't just get in
[1:31:19] your mind that that water is coming up
[1:31:21] on the visible part it's actually taking
[1:31:23] place under the the core of the earth as
[1:31:24] well that's why whenever they drill down
[1:31:27] on the earth this high tide and low tide
[1:31:29] they will hit salt water at certain
[1:31:30] times and will not hit salt water at
[1:31:32] other times why it's moving in the earth
[1:31:34] remember when the flood came it wasn't
[1:31:36] just from up here the Bible says The
[1:31:38] Fountains of the deep broke up so there
[1:31:41] hangs that Moon oh she's the weaker one
[1:31:44] she comes to four quarters justification
[1:31:47] made way for sanctification
[1:31:48] sanctification made way for the baptism
[1:31:50] of the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy
[1:31:52] Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost
[1:31:54] himself she she grows in glory she
[1:31:57] condescends in glory she grows in glory
[1:32:00] she condescends in glory she is a mirror
[1:32:03] of her husband the sun yetep the sun
[1:32:06] being 93 million miles from the earth
[1:32:08] the moon on an average of
[1:32:10] 267,000 miles and yet the atmosphere is
[1:32:13] so thin upon the moon the footprints of
[1:32:16] the first astronaut are still there it's
[1:32:20] like the scars that's on our hearts
[1:32:22] sometime we bear them and we carry them
[1:32:25] the only way we'll ever be able to rise
[1:32:28] above them is we must be overwhelmed by
[1:32:31] the presence of our son and our son can
[1:32:34] change our thin unforgiving unloving
[1:32:38] atmosphere and bring us into a
[1:32:41] regeneration of the soul and help us to
[1:32:44] look like the sun live like the sun act
[1:32:47] like the sun
[1:32:50] [Applause]
[1:32:58] and how long has it been since the moon
[1:33:01] has done all
[1:33:02] this maybe millions of
[1:33:06] years and when Papa made the Earth she
[1:33:09] stood up like
[1:33:11] this same temperature all the way
[1:33:14] around no Seasons no spring summer
[1:33:19] fall stood on her axis top and bottom
[1:33:23] but he made her with a
[1:33:26] degree an element of degree by which
[1:33:29] after the fall she would start tilting
[1:33:31] over like
[1:33:34] this and then when she did so it would
[1:33:37] allow the wobble inside her like this do
[1:33:42] you know why she does not wobble out of
[1:33:46] orbit and annihilate herself try to do
[1:33:49] your top that way try to take a bottle
[1:33:51] and set it and make it do that very far
[1:33:54] it'll just get completely out of wh you
[1:33:56] know why don't do it the lunar
[1:34:00] effect so being tilted over like this
[1:34:03] she still spins at a th miles an hour
[1:34:07] how in the world is that possible and
[1:34:09] every one of us sitting here day not
[1:34:10] sick as a horse we're spending a th000
[1:34:13] miles an hour you all have been sitting
[1:34:15] you're spending a th000 miles an
[1:34:18] hour oh and people say there ain't no
[1:34:20] God oh my goodness we're spinning around
[1:34:23] last out here a, miles an hour and we're
[1:34:26] spinning over like
[1:34:28] this why don't we just wobble wobble
[1:34:31] wobble and annihilate oursel because God
[1:34:33] put this power above us she saw my this
[1:34:37] over 200,000 miles from us but God
[1:34:40] created her with a power that would
[1:34:44] affect the
[1:34:46] Earth God created an element called The
[1:34:50] Church the body of Jesus Christ this is
[1:34:54] why we need to go to the house of God
[1:34:57] this is why we need Fellowship watch
[1:35:00] people that get out of church and watch
[1:35:02] them wobble and wobble and wobble and
[1:35:04] wobble and they get totally out of
[1:35:06] retrospect to God but God has a church
[1:35:11] the Church of the Living God it helps
[1:35:15] balance you up and even in our warp
[1:35:19] status it helps
[1:35:21] us oh that's
[1:35:25] right
[1:35:27] amen so when the Moon Turns her
[1:35:32] back the tide comes
[1:35:36] in and then the Moon Turns back around
[1:35:38] and say
[1:35:41] ah oh no no no no only so far and the
[1:35:46] tide backs
[1:35:48] off can't you say why we need God
[1:35:51] ordained holy ghost film Ministry yeah
[1:35:54] I love the tapes I love reading the
[1:35:56] books but tapes ain't got an eyeball
[1:35:58] they ain't got a spiritual eye to watch
[1:36:00] the condition of the church come on
[1:36:02] somebody that's why you need a Shepherd
[1:36:05] that's why you need men of God that are
[1:36:06] in tune with the message of the hour and
[1:36:09] they can catch the spirit of the church
[1:36:10] they can catch where the church is at
[1:36:12] come on Church oh my thank God for the
[1:36:16] tapes thank God for our Bible but my
[1:36:18] Bible does not have eyeballs my Bible
[1:36:21] does not have the ability to judge the
[1:36:24] spiritual metrics of our church but God
[1:36:27] uses
[1:36:28] men Hallelujah God uses man he always
[1:36:32] has and he always
[1:36:35] [Applause]
[1:36:40] will and when that moon
[1:36:43] rocks a little bit away from the earth
[1:36:45] and the tides come up when it goes down
[1:36:48] it just follows the tithe it's God's
[1:36:52] Great heart
[1:36:56] Army and when I thought about that being
[1:36:59] God's Great
[1:37:01] Army we went to
[1:37:05] bed then I begin to
[1:37:08] think that not a one of those get out of
[1:37:11] their
[1:37:12] place they're all set in place and
[1:37:15] there's moving anywhere out of them it's
[1:37:17] for a cause and will affect this Earth
[1:37:20] we're just seen the results of it now
[1:37:23] from some of moving into other
[1:37:25] spots now I thought then is that great
[1:37:28] Heavenly Host like that has to keep its
[1:37:33] place to make everything in order what
[1:37:37] about the
[1:37:39] disorder of the
[1:37:42] Earthly
[1:37:45] host how when one gets out of
[1:37:49] order how it throws the whole thing
[1:37:54] out a cater
[1:37:56] yeah so you watch it in a church you
[1:37:59] watch it in a family you watch it in a
[1:38:03] nation you get the leader of the
[1:38:07] nation whose mind is so perverted away
[1:38:10] from reality and Truth watch what one
[1:38:14] leader one president one whatever it is
[1:38:17] and can turn that entire nation upside
[1:38:20] down or bring them back to the trur we
[1:38:24] see all through the Old Testament that
[1:38:27] God would have kings that would raise up
[1:38:31] there was people like Josiah of course
[1:38:33] and ASA different ones that God Hezekiah
[1:38:36] that God would raise him up and there
[1:38:38] might be a good one then there' be 1 2 3
[1:38:40] 4 5 6 seven did evil on the side of the
[1:38:43] Lord did evil on the side of the Lord
[1:38:44] did evil on the side of the Lord as his
[1:38:46] father did all the days of his life and
[1:38:48] then thou would send Israel what is it
[1:38:52] you've got a rogue
[1:38:55] star a rogue star that is affecting the
[1:38:59] entire Kingdom so is it with
[1:39:04] preachers so is it with
[1:39:09] preachers oh
[1:39:11] my notice this he says what about the
[1:39:15] disorder of the Earthly host how when
[1:39:18] one gets out of order how it throws the
[1:39:21] whole thing out of
[1:39:23] the whole program of
[1:39:26] God is upset when one member gets out of
[1:39:31] order now listen this is your
[1:39:33] charge we should continually
[1:39:38] strive to keep the
[1:39:41] order of the
[1:39:47] spirit now it would have been easier of
[1:39:51] course to let
[1:39:54] Angels run the
[1:39:57] church let Angels run the
[1:40:01] kingdoms let Angels run the
[1:40:04] empires on the
[1:40:06] Earth but God chose to give man a
[1:40:10] probationary period upon the
[1:40:13] Earth and to prove to all the races
[1:40:17] there are no Superior human races every
[1:40:22] one of them are
[1:40:26] corrupt praise the Lord now people may
[1:40:29] call black power and white power and
[1:40:31] purple Power and pink Power and all that
[1:40:33] sort of thing it's a bunch of trash and
[1:40:36] nonsense the black race is not Superior
[1:40:38] over the White and the white sure ain't
[1:40:40] Superior over the black or the Indian or
[1:40:43] any other God made of one blood all
[1:40:48] people and the church said but God has
[1:40:52] let these es be able to Reign nrod
[1:40:55] actually if you look at your history you
[1:40:57] find out that Nimrod was one of the
[1:40:58] first ones to rule and according to all
[1:41:00] the history that I can find emerod was a
[1:41:02] black man so the one that was a leader
[1:41:05] first was the black race and then you
[1:41:08] look at the whites and all that they
[1:41:09] have done the prophet tells us being a
[1:41:11] white man that the white man is a
[1:41:15] renegade well come on you white people
[1:41:17] you can say Amen to it can you that is a
[1:41:20] renegade don't you understand all the
[1:41:22] negative things that he spoke against us
[1:41:25] As Americans he never spoke against the
[1:41:28] Spanish or the French or the Italian the
[1:41:31] way he did us he spoke against America
[1:41:34] so much and he said the American Spirit
[1:41:38] is frolic Frolic and laughter
[1:41:42] haaa but that also means we've got more
[1:41:45] to overcome and by the grace of God we
[1:41:49] will overcome the American Spirit we do
[1:41:53] do not want to be just identified as
[1:41:56] Americans we want to be identified as
[1:41:59] Sons and Daughters of
[1:42:03] God oh
[1:42:06] my let's can I have a few more
[1:42:09] minutes watch Joel
[1:42:12] prophesied that there would be a return
[1:42:15] of an
[1:42:16] Army in the last days Joel chap
[1:42:21] 2:7 they sh run like Mighty
[1:42:25] Men they shall climb the wall like Men
[1:42:29] of
[1:42:30] War they shall
[1:42:32] March everyone on his ways
[1:42:37] plural now watch the word of the Lord
[1:42:40] using a symbolism as an army so this
[1:42:43] Army of God in the last days these are
[1:42:46] the descriptions of what they'll do
[1:42:48] they'll run like Mighty Men if you
[1:42:50] notice it doesn't say they were Mighty
[1:42:52] Men but they will run like Mighty Men
[1:42:56] there's only one Almighty Among Us
[1:42:59] that's right and it ain't you and it
[1:43:01] certainly ain't me it's him but we're
[1:43:03] going to run like mighty men and women
[1:43:06] and they shall climb the wall like Men
[1:43:11] of War and they shall March everyone on
[1:43:15] his ways now why would he use the word
[1:43:18] March so a March is and you've seen it
[1:43:21] of course in military parade I just
[1:43:23] think it's so neat myself whenever you
[1:43:26] look out there and you've got hundreds
[1:43:27] of thousands of soldiers and they're
[1:43:29] just marching and their legs are moving
[1:43:31] back and forth like that and their arms
[1:43:33] are doing whatever and you think wow
[1:43:35] they had to train so much to be able to
[1:43:38] do that but I wonder if Word of Life
[1:43:41] Church is marching today are we all
[1:43:44] going at the same Pace are our legs
[1:43:46] going this way or one's going this way
[1:43:49] and one's going that way and one's going
[1:43:51] that way somebody's heading over here
[1:43:53] some of you is heading over there how
[1:43:54] are we ever going to defeat the Devil if
[1:43:58] we don't join together as an IND you I'm
[1:44:01] an individual yes but as individuals
[1:44:04] that are joined together for one purpose
[1:44:07] to the house of God we're not trying to
[1:44:11] take your individual identity but simply
[1:44:14] rob you or take away from you an error
[1:44:17] that you do not need an identification
[1:44:21] with the Church of the Living God
[1:44:23] you do if you are a Christian there
[1:44:27] should be a hunger in your heart not
[1:44:30] just to come to a building but to be a
[1:44:33] part of the body of
[1:44:37] Christ notice what he says they shall
[1:44:40] March
[1:44:41] everyone on his
[1:44:44] ways so it's a decare dedicated path for
[1:44:49] each one to march on and they're not
[1:44:51] going to be marching over over here the
[1:44:54] pastor's wife ain't going to be over
[1:44:55] there and the Deacon's wife the Deacon's
[1:44:58] wife ain't going to be over there with
[1:44:59] the pastor and the pastor is going to be
[1:45:02] down his place and the trustees there
[1:45:04] and the song leader and the musicians
[1:45:06] and the lay people everybody finding
[1:45:09] their way and marching marching
[1:45:14] marching and they shall
[1:45:17] not
[1:45:19] break their ranks
[1:45:25] now most human beings have a problem
[1:45:29] with
[1:45:33] rank here we go now we're out of the
[1:45:37] stars now we're out of the galaxies and
[1:45:40] we're right back down where we all
[1:45:43] live oh my y'all will be raising your
[1:45:46] hands for me to go back to the septian
[1:45:48] and all the rest of the stuff huh they
[1:45:51] shall not break their rank so what is
[1:45:54] breaking the rank so it's one that would
[1:45:56] be designated to be in a certain
[1:45:58] position and someone else looks at that
[1:46:00] position and they would rather be there
[1:46:03] than to be where God placed them but
[1:46:05] Joel's prophecy said they will not break
[1:46:09] the ranks look friends as a pastor I
[1:46:11] have a designated rank in the body of
[1:46:14] Christ I am not a prophet so the word
[1:46:18] cannot come to me I am not called to
[1:46:21] straighten out the Prophet I am not
[1:46:24] called to give all understanding to what
[1:46:28] the prophet said I'm not called to be a
[1:46:31] Joshua to come and follow up on the
[1:46:34] prophet's message don't get quiet on me
[1:46:36] now and neither are you as lay members
[1:46:39] called to straighten out what you think
[1:46:42] the prophet messed up you are called to
[1:46:45] get in your position get your army get
[1:46:48] your uniform if you've been given a
[1:46:51] butcher knife or whatever you been given

[1:47:01] maters and ters for all the rest of us

[1:48:01] they shall run like Mighty Men they
[1:48:02] shall climb the wall like Men of War
[1:48:04] they shall
[1:48:06] March won't you notice the order of the
[1:48:08] army of
[1:48:10] God they're not playing
[1:48:13] around they're not just josling back and
[1:48:19] forth I was never in the military but
[1:48:22] there's many here that have been and
[1:48:24] they could tell us how it
[1:48:26] is oh and I go to low sometimes in Home
[1:48:29] Depot I bought a bunch of the plants and
[1:48:31] different things for around here and
[1:48:32] they say you're in the military I said
[1:48:34] does the army of the Lord
[1:48:38] count depends on whether they're
[1:48:40] religious or not if they're religious
[1:48:42] they said well sir it ought
[1:48:45] to I've never picked up a gun to fight
[1:48:47] for our nation I never took
[1:48:51] training but I have been called to the
[1:48:53] army of the Lord oh
[1:48:58] yeah brother Daryl tells the story that
[1:49:00] whenever he was called and he went up as
[1:49:03] a young
[1:49:04] man he's
[1:49:07] left-handed he always assumed he was
[1:49:10] left ey
[1:49:12] dominant so whenever they sent him out
[1:49:14] on the Rings to fire
[1:49:16] guns they told Brother Daryl that he
[1:49:18] would be on the howitzer
[1:49:23] that you don't know what that means do
[1:49:24] you well they didn't give him a Target
[1:49:27] this size they give him one this
[1:49:31] size but it wasn't until he got out of
[1:49:35] the armed forces that he realized and
[1:49:37] found out he was right eyed
[1:49:41] dominant so being left-handed
[1:49:43] automatically had go this way couldn't
[1:49:46] already at the side of a
[1:49:47] barn but he found out he's looking
[1:49:50] through the wrong eye
[1:49:53] uhhuh the wrong eye you see God's
[1:49:55] changed eyes now for seven times so it
[1:49:58] went from Paul to the second Church a
[1:50:01] satday church a and this is why that the
[1:50:03] Pentecostal and many of them here behind
[1:50:05] us they're still shooting but they can't
[1:50:06] hit the side of a barn they can't do
[1:50:08] nothing they're compromising on marriage
[1:50:10] they're compromising on birth control
[1:50:12] they're compromising on abortion and all
[1:50:14] these other things but the only reason
[1:50:16] you can see is because you're seventh
[1:50:18] eye dominant you found out what eye age
[1:50:21] you're living in and then you looking at
[1:50:23] it well Hallelujah to God you found out
[1:50:26] well glory to God I'll tell you one
[1:50:28] thing yeah I was that too I was
[1:50:30] Pentecostal eye dominant I couldn't hit
[1:50:33] the side of a barn Harley but thanks be
[1:50:35] to God I found out that I was seventh
[1:50:38] angel I dominant and once I've got lined
[1:50:41] up you ask the devil my success
[1:50:44] rate that's why it ought to be with you
[1:50:46] as Sons and Daughters of God it ain't me
[1:50:49] it's you ain't you it's the grace of God
[1:50:52] that lined up our eye dominance and
[1:50:55] that's why we won't just overcome
[1:50:57] drinking we won't just overcome the
[1:50:59] negativity of the world we will actually
[1:51:02] overcome death itself for there are
[1:51:05] people I believe with all of my heart
[1:51:08] that are sitting in this building today
[1:51:10] that will not die it's because you've
[1:51:14] got your sight lined up our sight is not
[1:51:17] just aimed on cigarettes it's not just
[1:51:20] aimed on Tobacco our sight is on death
[1:51:23] Hallelujah and we will conquer death
[1:51:27] itself in a moment we will be changed by
[1:51:30] the power of
[1:51:32] [Applause]
[1:51:41] God
[1:51:46] listen but when you're out in eternity
[1:51:49] time flies
[1:51:55] look in verse eight and we'll close with
[1:51:58] this so they run like Mighty Men they'll
[1:52:01] climb the wall like Men of War they'll
[1:52:04] March look at them running climbing
[1:52:09] marching but not
[1:52:13] breaking I know people don't like
[1:52:16] don'ts but there's dos and there don'ts
[1:52:20] right in the same verse you got to mixed
[1:52:23] together look at verse eight neither
[1:52:27] shall one here's another
[1:52:29] don't neither shall one
[1:52:33] thrust another oppress or
[1:52:40] crowd one one of the very few armies on
[1:52:43] the earth that kill our own
[1:52:48] wounded so when we see a man or woman
[1:52:51] down if we don't like why can we just
[1:52:53] push them down
[1:52:59] farther I'd like to ask you Saint
[1:53:03] something if we were not in 2024 almost
[1:53:07] 25 we were in the first
[1:53:12] century and there was a woman showed up
[1:53:14] at our church we don't know exactly what
[1:53:17] her name was cuz the Bible doesn't
[1:53:19] mention her but all we know is she has
[1:53:21] got son some kind of
[1:53:26] reputation cuz she had five husbands and
[1:53:29] was living with another man that wasn't
[1:53:31] her
[1:53:32] own but we heard that Jesus got a hold
[1:53:35] of
[1:53:37] her would Word of Life Church be okay
[1:53:42] with the woman at the well coming to our
[1:53:48] church what about the man from Gad right
[1:53:56] who had a legion of demons in him
[1:53:58] drinking lying
[1:54:01] adultery so many demons when they were
[1:54:04] cast out that it killed a whole herd of
[1:54:07] hogs and every one of them demons lived
[1:54:09] in one man but yet it just so happened
[1:54:11] that man had robbed you one time that
[1:54:14] man had knocked your daddy in the
[1:54:17] head that man had violated your niece
[1:54:23] but after getting saved that man wanted
[1:54:26] to come to
[1:54:28] church would we be okay with
[1:54:34] that or would we tell him well you set
[1:54:38] out in your car and
[1:54:42] stream you can't sit in here amongst
[1:54:47] us us what former Liars prostitute
[1:54:53] denominational prostitutes and
[1:54:55] everything
[1:54:57] else I want the person in here this
[1:55:00] morning beginning at this pull pit who
[1:55:03] has been without
[1:55:14] sin hello testing one two one
[1:55:19] two if any of us make it
[1:55:23] it'll be God's
[1:55:25] grace not our
[1:55:28] works not that we deserve
[1:55:32] it so who is it that keeps
[1:55:35] us the grace of
[1:55:40] God I have risked my reputation many
[1:55:44] times over the years for preaching for
[1:55:47] certain
[1:55:48] preachers the mainstream message
[1:55:51] preachers told me don't go there don't
[1:55:53] go there oh don't go there I have risked
[1:55:56] my
[1:55:57] reputation counseling and praying for
[1:56:00] people that was so lost and such scum on
[1:56:05] the bottom of the
[1:56:10] barrel say how in the work can you do
[1:56:12] that oh because the prophet told us
[1:56:14] Jesus
[1:56:15] reputation was made among such
[1:56:20] people and I realized hadn't been for
[1:56:22] the grace of God I could have been an
[1:56:24] adulterer a liar a
[1:56:27] murderer so if we were in the first
[1:56:29] century and our church a messenger was
[1:56:32] not brother brandham but it was Paul and
[1:56:35] Paul wanted to come and preach in our
[1:56:36] church hold a
[1:56:38] meeting and some of you all began to
[1:56:40] search his background you found out this
[1:56:41] man this man had Steven
[1:56:44] stoned this man had many of the children
[1:56:47] of God thrown in jail yes sir they were
[1:56:50] beat because of him they were whipped
[1:56:52] some of them lost their lives the
[1:56:55] prophet said the very reason Paul wanted
[1:56:57] to become a martyr was because that
[1:57:00] thing haunted him of all the people
[1:57:03] brother Phillip what he had put him
[1:57:06] through would if any of you all have a
[1:57:08] problem with Paul come and hold us and
[1:57:10] meet
[1:57:14] him ain't it amazing how we
[1:57:17] get we become so
[1:57:20] self-righteous so l lift it
[1:57:23] up and we're the ones that can give
[1:57:26] people Grace and you can have Grace and
[1:57:28] you can't and you can
[1:57:33] and myself I go back to the words of
[1:57:36] Jesus blessed are the
[1:57:39] merciful for
[1:57:41] they shall obtain
[1:57:48] Mercy
[1:57:50] pades is in the same same
[1:57:54] spot that the Lord God placed her in
[1:57:57] millions of years ago not saying that
[1:58:00] there's not a variance of degree by
[1:58:02] which atmospheric pressure or something
[1:58:04] might make them you know back and forth
[1:58:06] back and forth but it's not like that
[1:58:09] the star from pleades went to um Urus or
[1:58:13] wound up in in Taurus or some of the
[1:58:17] others I honestly can't say that myself
[1:58:21] I've complained
[1:58:23] I've
[1:58:24] grumbled I still to this day wish I was
[1:58:29] not a
[1:58:30] pastor I wish did this day I wasn't even
[1:58:32] a
[1:58:34] preacher cuz most of my problems in life
[1:58:38] has come from God's
[1:58:42] people being a preacher has just about
[1:58:45] destroyed
[1:58:46] me and annihilated my sanity
[1:58:53] Welcome to the Real
[1:58:56] World but in
[1:58:58] reality if the Lord God were to say to
[1:59:00] me this evening okay Donnie I heard what
[1:59:02] you told the church there um you want me
[1:59:05] to just drop this thing about the
[1:59:07] preacher
[1:59:07] deal and we just let you
[1:59:12] go I look up and say now Lord you know I
[1:59:15] was only teasing right I mean I
[1:59:22] it's odd isn't it it's odd how we are in
[1:59:26] reality we want his will and his word
[1:59:28] more than anything else but we're in the
[1:59:30] middle of it boy it can be so
[1:59:33] hard it can be so
[1:59:35] tough but remember there is a divine
[1:59:41] order all it takes is a husband to step
[1:59:44] out of the will of God and watch that
[1:59:45] whole family a wife to step out of the
[1:59:48] will of God step out of the will of God
[1:59:50] just for a period of months
[1:59:52] and cause all kinds of pain and
[1:59:55] anxiety same with a pastor of a church
[1:59:59] so a pastor starts in a certain
[2:00:00] direction away from God can you imagine
[2:00:03] if I'd get so stupid
[2:00:07] stupid just beside myself just out of my
[2:00:09] mind I think I ain't going back no
[2:00:13] more that's what some of you all
[2:00:16] say so if I just said I'm done with it
[2:00:20] I'm moving to
[2:00:22] I ain't telling none of you cuz I don't
[2:00:23] want you to where I'm
[2:00:28] going but if I was the one God sent here
[2:00:31] to help you then where would you go what
[2:00:34] would happen to you and you and you
[2:00:38] because you see a man that's really
[2:00:39] called of God it's like God has put him
[2:00:42] there and being part of that
[2:00:44] constellation then God sends the other
[2:00:46] stars to be part of that
[2:00:49] constellation then another man comes in
[2:00:51] tries to boot him out or you know they
[2:00:53] try to take people from another
[2:00:55] constellation I don't want anybody else
[2:00:57] from any other constellation myself I
[2:00:59] only want people at our church who God
[2:01:02] sends cuz if they come floating in with
[2:01:04] us and they come on their own we're all
[2:01:06] going to be
[2:01:07] unhappy what would happen to your life
[2:01:11] if the devil could wear me down and wear
[2:01:13] brother Tim PR down and other men of God
[2:01:15] down so low that they just think I can't
[2:01:18] take it no
[2:01:19] more and that star just
[2:01:23] goes out of the middle of the
[2:01:25] cluster oh it's plenty of preachers yeah
[2:01:28] you could get another my you could have
[2:01:30] one vot in in by next
[2:01:32] Sunday but how would the constellation
[2:01:35] work how would this be how would that
[2:01:40] be you see that all right now you can
[2:01:44] see it from my spot so what about
[2:01:48] yours well it seem like I ain't got no
[2:01:50] friends at the church it seemed like
[2:01:52] this is going on I I think we should
[2:01:53] look for another place I I think we
[2:01:55] should go
[2:01:56] ah but you'll tell me I shouldn't do
[2:01:59] that but you look at yourself and well
[2:02:02] you know what I'm a free moreal agent
[2:02:03] yeah exactly that's what's got you in so
[2:02:05] much trouble right and me and every
[2:02:08] other human
[2:02:10] being so what we should do is say Lord
[2:02:13] help
[2:02:16] me if this is my place I'm a part of
[2:02:19] this constellation
[2:02:22] then help me to do what I can let me
[2:02:26] shine and you know there's a certain
[2:02:29] equation that scientists have come up
[2:02:31] with to be able to measure the
[2:02:33] brightness and the illumination of
[2:02:36] stars a lot of it has to do with
[2:02:38] distance of course from where we see
[2:02:40] them but what they found out is it's the
[2:02:42] depths of the iron core and how much
[2:02:45] iron is in the core of that planet and
[2:02:48] there are no five pointed stars as you
[2:02:50] know they're all uh in a circle anyway
[2:02:53] but it's because of that and then the
[2:02:57] borrowed
[2:02:58] light reflects upon them so the star
[2:03:02] cannot brag about anything that it's
[2:03:04] done cuz whoever made it put that iron
[2:03:07] or in its core so the density of the
[2:03:09] iron core will say would be
[2:03:11] 27% then it will have the capability of
[2:03:14] catching the light well there's another
[2:03:15] star out there and it may be closer to
[2:03:18] the Earth than that one is but it's
[2:03:20] density of its core it's only 21% iron
[2:03:23] or no matter how much it tries it will
[2:03:26] never produce the same light as the
[2:03:29] other
[2:03:30] one so the 27% guy can't really brag to
[2:03:34] the 21% guy I got more iron or than you
[2:03:40] got all he can do is shine shine
[2:03:44] shine back to the
[2:03:47] Creator my goodness if you can sing like
[2:03:49] a mocking bird this morning and every
[2:03:51] body here just absolutely loves your
[2:03:53] singing and maybe there's some that
[2:03:55] sings like a crow and then sometimes
[2:03:57] they sing like this and that and the
[2:03:59] other but they're singing with all their
[2:04:01] heart don't make fun of
[2:04:03] them God's the one who gave them that
[2:04:06] much iron or yes sir maybe there's
[2:04:08] preachers boy they can preach and
[2:04:10] they're absolutely your favorites boy
[2:04:13] they get called to preach conventions
[2:04:14] and great big
[2:04:16] meetings and then there's other little
[2:04:18] brothers and they go here and there and
[2:04:20] there and never preach conventions but
[2:04:23] rest their life I thank God for them
[2:04:27] Stars how many wants to be what God made
[2:04:32] you you're a part of the army
[2:04:36] friends let's bow our
[2:04:41] heads praise
[2:04:45] God lord
[2:04:49] Jesus as we have our heads
[2:04:52] bowed down to the dust of the
[2:04:57] Earth from when our bodies were
[2:05:01] taken Lord we believe that our
[2:05:04] origin is not of this
[2:05:06] Earth but of a Heavenly
[2:05:10] nature we're praying that you'd help us
[2:05:12] today
[2:05:14] Lord I pray for myself first not because
[2:05:19] I'm selfish but because I think I'm the
[2:05:22] most needy one
[2:05:24] here no doubt I'm more needy than
[2:05:27] anybody that'll stream this service or
[2:05:28] anybody that'll AR of
[2:05:30] it because to my care and charge has
[2:05:33] been committed The Souls of
[2:05:36] hundreds of
[2:05:39] people and thousands that I affect
[2:05:41] around the
[2:05:43] world and sometimes it scares me to
[2:05:45] death to think about it if I ponder over
[2:05:48] it much I get so nervous I can't hard
[2:05:50] even think about it
[2:05:52] it I need you
[2:05:54] Lord help
[2:05:56] me help me Jesus that I'll stay
[2:06:00] magnetized to your
[2:06:02] word as long as I do that then I'll have
[2:06:05] no no worries about going off this
[2:06:09] tangent or that one or money or women or
[2:06:13] popularity or nothing else as long as
[2:06:16] I'm magnetized to your word which your
[2:06:19] Prophet said was the north po star
[2:06:22] and the needle always goes to that North
[2:06:25] Star then I'll be safe as long as I'm
[2:06:28] there in you Lord I pray for my brothers
[2:06:31] and sisters this
[2:06:34] morning that you'd help each of them
[2:06:38] some of them are looking and they're
[2:06:40] searching We Believe Lord that many of
[2:06:42] the people of our Earth are going
[2:06:45] through an identity
[2:06:47] crisis they don't know who they are
[2:06:49] father we realize Satan is taking great
[2:06:52] advantage of that for the time frame
[2:06:55] that we're
[2:06:56] in Satan is feeding all this transgender
[2:06:59] stuff and this gay stuff to the young
[2:07:02] people and they were born a boy but
[2:07:05] through all this corruption it confuses
[2:07:09] them and they're not sure if they were a
[2:07:11] girl born in a boy's body or if they're
[2:07:14] a girl or vice
[2:07:16] versa and it's an identity
[2:07:20] crisis and then our rotten government
[2:07:22] has got so rotten that they want to
[2:07:25] change them from what they were born to
[2:07:27] be to something else and what they're
[2:07:29] finding is which our government present
[2:07:32] tense government has hid the
[2:07:35] documentation and the proof that many of
[2:07:38] these young people that have gone
[2:07:39] through these things has increased
[2:07:42] suicidal rates and has increased regret
[2:07:46] of doing it true Lord God we at one time
[2:07:51] had an identity crisis some of us
[2:07:53] thought we were Baptist we thought we
[2:07:55] were Pentecostal we thought we were
[2:07:58] Beyond salvation we could never be
[2:08:02] bride but what you did was you sent a
[2:08:05] message in the last days that would wake
[2:08:08] us up to our true
[2:08:11] identity and the crisis was settled and
[2:08:16] the chaos was
[2:08:18] changed but since has happened Lord now
[2:08:21] is a attacking us from outside cu the
[2:08:24] soul is so anchored to the North Star he
[2:08:27] can't move it no more so he'll hit us
[2:08:30] with diseases and arguments and
[2:08:33] difference of opinions and this and that
[2:08:35] and the other to disrupt our minds and
[2:08:38] our hearts and our homes and our
[2:08:40] churches Lord we need you so
[2:08:43] much may our
[2:08:45] church never lose our true
[2:08:48] identity if there's any standing here
[2:08:51] today today going through an identity
[2:08:54] crisis whether it will be a sexual one
[2:08:57] or a spiritual
[2:08:59] one I pray father that you would help
[2:09:02] them to bring
[2:09:04] back bring back to their being their
[2:09:09] original purpose and program of God
[2:09:14] we're here to serve you despite our
[2:09:17] failures our
[2:09:19] mistakes Satan tried to give Fallen
[2:09:22] Christians this identity crisis when
[2:09:25] they mess up horribly terribly and they
[2:09:28] think they can't be saved he tries to
[2:09:31] bring back the memory of the identity
[2:09:36] crisis trying to make them lose their
[2:09:40] identity that they are the elect of
[2:09:43] God David must have went through that
[2:09:46] whenever he committed his terrible Deeds
[2:09:48] at B Sheba and all the things went on we
[2:09:51] can hear him crying out
[2:09:53] praying but finally David was able to
[2:09:56] find it cleanse me with
[2:09:59] hisp and I shall be
[2:10:02] clean wash me and I shall be pure for it
[2:10:05] is against thee and the only have I
[2:10:08] sinned oh God but blessed is the man
[2:10:12] that walketh not in the counsel of the
[2:10:13] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[2:10:16] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[2:10:18] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[2:10:21] of the Lord and in his law does he
[2:10:23] meditate both day and night he shall be
[2:10:26] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[2:10:29] water which bring forth its fruit in its
[2:10:33] season whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[2:10:37] but the ungodly are not so but they are
[2:10:39] like the chaff which the wind driveth
[2:10:42] away hallelujah
[2:10:45] hallelujah therefore the righteous shall
[2:10:47] not stand in the way of Sinners nor the
[2:10:50] ungodly in the seed of the righteous oh
[2:10:52] Father May the identity be crisis be
[2:10:56] settled I pray Lord in the name of
[2:11:00] Jesus we worship you father we are your
[2:11:06] stars of the end time your Prophet talks
[2:11:10] about it about Abraham in
[2:11:13] 1964 when he prays and he says that
[2:11:16] Abraham was told to count the sand if he
[2:11:18] could and you told him to look up to
[2:11:21] word the stars and say count the
[2:11:24] Stars if you
[2:11:27] can so shall your seed be and the
[2:11:31] prophet uses these great
[2:11:33] words from
[2:11:35] dust to
[2:11:38] Stars that's what the new birth does for
[2:11:42] us from
