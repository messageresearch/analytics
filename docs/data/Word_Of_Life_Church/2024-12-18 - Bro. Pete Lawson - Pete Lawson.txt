to sing for you [Music] in a land far away time Stood Still long ago there were sheepers in fields or at least this is how the story Goes The Story Goes woman with child and and in with no room born in a manger for telling a tomb this is how The Story Goes but it's more than a fable and it's more than a fairy tale and more than my mind can conceive I believe the wise men saw the little child the Angels called the Son of God Heaven's child The Great I Am born take away my sin through nail pierced hands he may youel has come I believe 2,000 years still the story lives on God's gift to us sent to Earth wrapped in flesh his only son his only son and the heartbeat of Heaven confounded our wisdom but it's still the simple truth that Set Me Free I believe the wise men saw the little child the Angels called the son Son of God Heaven's child The Great I Am born to take away my sin through nail pierced hands Emmanuel has come and I believe [Music] preious child how can it be that God's great plan for his story would send you to the lonely tree that you would come come for one like [Music] me I believe in a cross I believe he came for one he came for all Heaven's child became a man he gave his Li for me in spite of what I [Music] am I believe Jesus Liv in me I believe w [Music] I have nothing this song that somebody showed me a couple weeks back if I cry I'm sorry now I'll go ahead and apologize it's a a song that uh I remember many years ago I heard it and it meant a lot to me then and now it means a whole lot more to me it's uh titled he never left me and I can think of many times when I thought I had crossed a line and that there was no coming back from it and I found out that he was always right there every time that I cross I thought I crossed the line he was there just to pick me up one more time if you've got a if you are a mom or dad or that's got a prodical that's somewhere and if there his he hasn't left him yet just have hope keep praying I hope this song will give you encouragement tonight [Music] so many [Music] directions the road look the [Music] same he gave me [Music] instructions I disregarded in shame sudden destruction [Music] soon came my way and I have to say I've got me to [Music] blame but he never left [Music] me though I turn my my back on him I was living in a world of sin and I was trying to run away [Music] again but he never left me when I chose to walk away even when I couldn't pray he never left me I chose the wrong road cuz it look good to [Music] me I walk blindly onward oh but I just could not see [Music] I was lost and I was dying but now I'm trying oh I couldn't reach out to Jesus Oh but he reached down to me oh he never left me though I turned my back on him I was living in a world of sin and I was trying to run away again oh but he never left me when I chose to walk away even when I couldn't pray he never left me sing that CR oh he never left me though I turned my back on him I was living in a world of sin and I was trying timey to run away again oh but he never left [Music] me when I chose to walk away even when I couldn't pray he never left [Music] me oh even when I I couldn't [Music] pray he never left [Music] [Applause] me let's sing one more song tonight brother the P asked us to sing let's sing uh turn your eyes on Jesus F I think let's sing this little course tonight amen certainly appreciate our specials this evening amen looking forward to the word we was back there trying to figure out who's preaching tonight we W know if we need to leave or not then walked back there I told Brother Pete I said I guess we can stay that want make him more nervous than he already is let's just sing This Little Chorus as we turn the order of the service over tonight oh Turn Your Eyes Upon on

strange the ey of his glory amen I apologize I popped a in before I came back here dried my mouth out you know it's funny I uh the Lord Works um as we say in mysterious ways I always said I would never wear one of these things um and uh I can honestly say that I've looked for them uh because I want to be in compliance with the word any Christian wants to be in compliance with the word and um I looked at every store for from Ernie Solin and every outlet and couldn't find anything and my wife lo and behold goes into a consignment store and uh this is what she found so you have a sense of humor [Laughter] sir amen amen isn't he good to us here where it is Wednesday night of all the places that we could be we're back here in the house of God um we're so blessed we're so blessed his presence is here we're here together we're all in anticipation expecting to hear something from him expecting him to work in our lives and uh I know I need it myself I'm not just here preaching I'm here to I hopefully I'll get preached to a little bit myself and he's just such a good God he's so mindful of us brother Justin that I was sitting back there in the back and just I was nervous and like Lord have I missed your mind and then brother Justin starts singing his song and uh all right all right we're on point so let's let's have church tonight I'm going to do my part I'm going to give it everything that I've got tonight and I just ask that you do your part give give him everything that you've got get behind this word and I I I'm definitely a weak vessel I'm probably the weakest vessel that we have of the minister Brothers here at the church but um I believe he's a big God and I believe that I can step aside and he can say something that you need to hear I believe that he can work in your life whatever it is that you need him to work on so let's have church tonight if you would turn with me to book to the book of Hebrews chap 1 verses 1-4 promis I'd wear it I didn't say how long thank you buddy those things are just so uncomfortable Hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 God it says God who at sundried times and in diverse manners spake in time pass unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom Heath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had purged himself purged their sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high being made so much better than the angel as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they and I want to look at that word person the express image of his person that word person comes from the word I'm going to try to say hypostasis which means the substantial quality or nature of a person or thing tonight we're going to be talking about the nature of God as it we pray uh let's all um keep Sister Janet Kennedy um on our hearts she's had this surgery and just is really going through it and her sister's had a really rough time the last few years with you know brother Eugene and being sick and then just putting her own health off um to take care of him and now she's trying to get some things taken care of and she's having a hard time recovering but we know a God who is mindful um I I believe he's mindful today matter of fact I know he's mindful of us tonight his word declares that he's mindful of us his actions declare that he's mindful of us he's working in our lives this very moment which tells us that he's mindful of us he's working in the song Service uh uh brother Justin to give confidence to a a minister who's nervous and trying to find the mind of the Lord and he's working in our midst today so I know that he's mindful so let's just as we bow our heads let's take if you have a need lift it to the Lord and just everybody just please just uh remember Sister Janet Lord one more time here we are standing before your presence um it has fallen my lot to stand before these people and to try to break the breath the bread of life and Lord you know I of all people I don't have the ability father so I'm just going to yield my vessel and ask that you would speak we have needs tonight Lord Our Sister Janet Kennedy L is at home uh recovering from this uh this operation um Lord she needs your touch but we know um you've brought her this far you've been faithful to her through so many things to bring her to where she is today we know it's your nature to just keep on doing the work that you started amen so I just ask that you would just touch her Lord even now as we speak May the Holy Ghost go to my sister and start turning this around break the bre break your word for us we love you Lord we never want to just forget to say that we love you we are so grateful for your presence in our lives what would it be Lord what kind of service would it be if you weren't here tonight so we're very grateful for your presence we love you we so appreciate you and it's in Jesus name that we pray amen you may be seated I almost forget that part every time um I going to start off with this quote who is this 1959 brother brandom said what if Abraham would have took what it looked like 25 years waiting for a promise that God gave him why he he would have never had the baby they never they would have never uh had had been the father of little Isaac but he believed God's word and wouldn't turn it loose but he watered it day and night strong giving praise unto God ohen Sarah would say honey it's been 25 years since since the promise was made here I am nearly 100 he would say praise God we're going to have it anyhow cuz God said so and that settles it that's right he said he knowed the nature of God because he was a friend of God that's talking about a relationship he know the nature of God because he was a friend of God he knowed how to take him he knew how to take God he knew how to take his mannerisms his ways he understood God because he he knowed that his promises no matter how foolish they looked or how simple they looked or how unreasonable they looked they were true because God said so and that settled it forever now I think about this great man of faith that we've been preached on I mean countless times there's no way you could possibly know the number of times that this the faith that this man has been preached on and talked about and we've looked to him to to get that his story to give us strength and um he's even to the place that he's referred to as the father of the faithful and James chapter 2 actually referred to him as the friend of God you know what a compliment that is to be called the friend of God you have such a relationship with him and to be he can we can dep he we can depend on him but to know that God can depend on us um he was referred to as the friend of God Romans chapter 4 says uh speaking of Abraham says that who against hope believed in believed in hope that he might become the father of Nations and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body which was now dead and it skips on down it says he and he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able to a able to perform this great man of Faith the key to that Faith the key to his ability to hold on to the promise of God for 25 years with absolutely nothing changing with no improvement when it seemed like there was no encouragement um maybe things go the wrong direction for 25 years this man held to the promise of God and the key to his ability to do that was because he knew the nature of God he knew the nature of God he knew how to take God he understood him and that was through relationship now everything has a nature every living thing has a nature every every human every animal has a nature that defines it your nature is literally the definition of you if I could look you up um if I could look you up brother if I could look you up uh Caleb Davis and I could look you up in a dictionary your what would be the definition of Caleb Davis your your nature defines you to others it lets you know what this man's all about what's he like what's this man really really like um is the nature the nature of God is what what what what gave Abraham this great faith now the word nature we're going to look into this just for a minute try to get rid of this mint that is like not nervous honestly I was but I'm not now the the word nature is the complex of emotional and intellectual attributes that determines a determine a person's characteristic actions and reactions and that's important you know what CU re actions and the reactions that you know what to expect from somebody based on their nature it says the inherent character or the basic constitution of a person or thing the disposition or the temperament now everything has a nature every human has one every animal has one and I I think about even even the animal life they all have natures and you think about your pets and so on and I think about the different of natures between between everybody's either typically a a cat or a dog person and uh one is a a cat is a snotty stuck up creature and a a dog when you walk up into the room thinks M my goodness the Lord himself has walked into the room and they have a nature that defines them that lets you know what to expect out of this animal you what type of behavior to get from them and hey if I do this this is what that animal is going to do in response and nature tells you a whole lot about us there are all kinds of emotional and as it says the emotional and intellectual attributes that kind of kind of Define each one of us we uh um uh you know self-awareness how self-aware are we um you know knowing your strengths and weaknesses we none of us tend to really know that really really well we all uh we all either way underestimate or way overestimate ourselves and and our abilities um your motivation what type of motivation you have as part of your nature um are you selfmotivated do somebody has to drag you along that teaches people what to expect from you um empathy or your can you empath with people when they're going through things are your social skills um are you an out outgoing person are you an introvert it teaches people your nature teaches people what to expect from you your humility um um teaches people do do you understand and know your limits and your infallibility your weak can you understand your weakness um your honesty can you be trusted can you be unbiased all these things make up our natures and they Define us it defines me to you MD carway it tells you this is what Pete Lawson is so if I do this this is how Pete's going to respond if I if I if this certain situation comes about this is how Pete's going to react why because I know his nature I know what to expect but from Pete if someone were to to bust through bust through his door and and to threaten his family I know Pete's nature so I know what to expect from him your nature defines you to others God's nature also defines him to his people we all have a disposition we all got a personality right everybody's got a personality um something that uh some people got big personalities some people are uh um unfortunately um that's why I try to keep quiet I've got a big personality um don't mean nothing by it um I feel like I could take on um I could I could fight a troop by myself and I I love challenges as I said before and I um I'm bold and I I just wish sometimes Pete just shut up you know just learn to shut up but it's I've got a nature I've got a personality that kind of defines me to the people that I that know me and uh to my wife and my kids and my my friends my brothers and sisters we all got a disposition which is your mood it's it's uh and compare me and my wife my wife is one of the sweetest people honest the sweetest person that I've ever met in my life and I'm I'm more known for I've been told I was born with a scowl from the day that I was born um I'm a very determined person um and uh um I'm I'm a little more Surly a little more abrupt I I generally say what's on my mind where Bambi will always try to say the nice try to be nice and say kind things to she CU she thinks about people's feelings and I think if you ask you really meant you really want to know so um and I tell her I said listen darling if you don't want to know what what what your dress looks like or the outfits you've got on looks like if you don't really want to know cuz if you ask me I think you really want to know I've got a nature that defines me she should have learned by now to quit asking me that you know you know but we all we've got we all got a temperament which is kind of like your emotional ronse to situations and if you don't think you got one um take a hammer and smash your finger real good and you'll find out you do have a temperament you'll find out uh this is how I respond um when when I'm in pain when I'm in danger when uh um if you get here's a good one if you get cut off in traffic or you got some knucklehead that is in the left lane you know doing 50 m an hour in a 70 and you got a parade about 100 miles long it feels like behind you you'll find out what type of a what type of temperament you got right we all have a temperament that defines us to other people it lets them know hey you know what I could probably do this with with Pete and get by with it or maybe with Pete I probably wouldn't want to do that you know maybe somebody's really sensitive someone that's a really sensitive person you got to be careful with what you say to them you because you don't want to hurt their feelings so you got to kind of guard your words a little bit more but someone to say like John hornak was a good friend of mine you can pretty much just just let it roll with John you cannot offend him you can't embarrass him um but I know his nature that teaches me how to have a Rel relationship with him yeah am I making sense so far that's we all got a fight or flight response when we get scared um we all got one I've seen grown men 6'4 250 lbs when they get scared scream like a little girl that just saw the devil in in their closet you know curl up their you know I've seen women that you would think would scream when they got placed in a situation like that handle it just take it on the chin and not even not even Flinch but we all have a response to these things and it lets people know this is this is how this is a type of relationship these are the guidelines this kind of helps me set boundaries in our relationship with this person God also has a nature that teaches us what type how to how to have a relationship with him what to expect from him and I'm going to go a little slower than I normally do um I promise the Lord that I I tend to come out like a like a like a Brahma Bull ready to fight and I just promise the Lord I'm going to try to just slow down and let him try to follow the leading of the Holy Ghost um we all have habits that Define us uh we all get up in the morning we have our morning routine uh which tells our our spouse and our family this is what uh maybe in the morning this is what they do so this is what I can expect and my wife loves her loves her coffee so I can always expect her to be near the coffee pot when she wakes up and we all have things that we do habits that Define us and and it teaches people how to have a relationship our integrity your honesty do you keep your word come on now when you give it see your word is going to be everything to people or your word is going to be absolutely nothing to people and we get to decide that you know your integrity your honesty um your work ethic will will will Define you I I I think about many years ago I worked with brother uh brother Mike Lunsford and we were out on the um brother Ben is back when I worked with you and you had loan me to Mike and we were cutting a salvage yard down in South Carolina and these people don't if you're on their Sal on a salvage yard cutting these converters they want to be there with you CU they want to see what's coming out of their yard because that's there's a lot of money involved in this and uh brother Mike I noticed these people let Mike come in after hours while they were gone because that man had such a reputation and he his integrity was so strong they knew I can leave my gates open and let him come in here and cut these converters and I know he won't miss paying for a single one right you know do you keep your word when you give it to people these all Define us they teach people how to have a relationship with us we all got our little quirks our little our little uh little Oddities about us you know like eating fries first which is the only way in the world you're supposed to eat fries whenever you have a hamburger and fries you eat your fries first um um I I'll stand by that the lines on the sidewalk I I don't know why but I have to step over those things it just it bothers me to step on a line uh um Times New Roman there is no other font to use um other than Times New Roman we all know it's the best obviously um we got these quirks these little little things about herself that just teaches people this is what lost in his like so here's what I can here's what I can do with him here's what I can't if this happens I know exactly how he's going to respond all of these things teach others how to have a relationship because of our habitual response to situations God also has a nature and I know I keep saying that but I'm just going to drive it home I'm trying to just trying to imprint the my thought into your mind he also has a nature and by his nature we know exactly what to expect from him now I know we've got the word now you may say well why do we need to know know the nature of God when we have the message we have all all the Mysteries um uh that uh that have been revealed to us and all the doctrines that we understand and um the things that have been given to us why do we need to know the nature of God when the word literally has been unfolded to us why do we need to know and I'll say this it's because he is coming back for his queen that lady who knows him not just knows about him him not just knows what is written about him not just knows the Mysteries and understands the doctrines but he is coming for that woman that knows him in a very intimate intimate way she knows what he's like she knows the Integrity of this man that she has chose to marry herself to amen not just any woman this is a love story you have to read the word of God like a love story brother Brenham said the Bible is like a love letter you have to read between the lines and see what that and see what it means not add to it to get the heart of what's being talked about example when the when the word gives us instruction on how to live Our Lives Many people get offended by that many people hear hear the the things that with the when the Lord just starts cutting things and cutting and cutting and dealing with our lives but she hears his love looking out for her protecting her trying to lead her back to him right trying to get her to the other side because he is anxious he is anxious for that day when he when we can be together as we should be many women I'll say it that way churches people individuals have read his letters because they Bel believe that he was talking to them and they became offended by his words because they they didn't read it they didn't there was no love relationship there they accused him of being controlling and telling her how to wear her clothes and and how to live our lives and how to conduct ourselves and they became offended but she understands what he's doing there is one woman who understands what he said when what his word is saying when when when the word starts cutting Our Lives she understands his love my wife understands me like nobody else his wife understands him like nobody else amen I think of my wife when she goes out and she knows that I've seen things that she hasn't seen and I've seen a little bit of the darker side of life so when she goes out I I kind of give her instruction when uh she goes out shopping I'm just when you get to a spot check in with me hey I'm at Target I'm at Ross I tell I teach her to to take different routes when she goes out and um because I when I worked in Corrections we were taught to you know take different routes to to and from work and wherever we were going because uh these inmates would have people to follow us um to try to to try to make you and try to get to your family so they get to get you to do things that were um you know just uh not above board and I instruct her be careful text me let me know when you're at this spot so that I know if if if you if if you go silent I know what your last location was now that might seem extreme and and and and but if I was to tell another sister here hey sis I want you to text me when you get to such when you get to each location now she might think that's creepy she should she should but my wife she understands what she knows what my husband has seen she understands she knows he knows things about this world that I don't understand I know that man's looking out for me I know he's protecting me she hears my love in the instructions that I give her she hears the love of God in his instruction she does not take offense when the word cuts on her life she understands what he's doing doing that don't mean it don't hurt but she understands she gets it have no idea where I'm at now knowing a person gives secret insight into that person there's a hidden me hidden meaning to their words you know I can say something too to my wife or my kids and they understand exactly what daddy's talking about sis you understand what I'm saying they understand my ways my mannerisms um they they just they get me they know what I'm they know what I'm about um they understand the hidden meaning behind my words um M your Expressions all of us have Expressions that you're that PE the people in your life they can read your Expressions the people that really know you they even know what you're thinking based off of your expression even when you're silent they know what they they they can know many times what you're even thinking about me and my wife all the time will uh I know when my wife's hungry and I and I generally know what she wants you know we'll be driving down the road and it just it just comes to mind I'm like you hungry darling say yeah I am I Subway she said yep you know but because I know her we we've walked a long time together almost 24 years now and we've learned each other we've come to understand each other um we can talk when no words are being said um we can read each other's uh I can I can read her her Expressions uh um all these things all of them speak volumes if you know the person right as I said before knowing a person helps set relationship boundaries basically it let you know what I can and what I can't do with this individual nobody nobody knows me like Miss Bambi Marie knows me and nobody knows him like she knows him right she knows his Secrets he's revealed him to her she knows what he likes and what he don't like because they've walked and they've had relationship and he's and he's talked to her and he's and he and he's guided her and and just kind of just let her see him in in the in the day to day she knows this man yes how how how can she know him so well because she has walked with him through through many roads through many trials through many tests through many hardships and and and through all of that it has taught her one thing that her God will never fail her our God will will never turn his back on us he has proven it through his actions his word has declared it but his actions declare it even louder to me he will never turn his back on you brother Justin she knows his Integrity she knows what type of man if I can say it like that that he is because she knows his nature brother Bron said now I in in the latest de see in church as he said I've often Illustrated about my wife when she writes me a letter he said I can see what she's saying on that letter he said I read between the lines to know what she means see he said see because I love her I know her nature and you have to know God's nature and love him and then the scriptures will stand right out to you yeah he is coming again friend I'll say it he's coming again very soon I believe for that woman who gets him and then to me that's important just because I I want to be understand understood I I've got an odd type of Nature and when you're 64260 and got this you know uh uh people see that and they think you're uh you're an Axe Murderer and whatever more I like it's it's nice to be understood it's nice to have somebody that gets you to under that understands you that actually can see the real you amen he is not coming for the woman who fell in love with the men that he sent to tell her about him and understand what I'm saying I appreciate all these Great Men of God that he's given to the Bride of Jesus Christ I I appreciate our pastor very much uh uh the the the trust that he's he's given me to to to feed his sheep when he's gone I I that overwhelms me at times and I I appreciate all these men but they do not replace Jesus Christ amen we must remember that we are following a person not a written word not a written word only he's alive he's real he's living and breathing he's a real living being amen and he desires to be loved not just a rob a robotic following he desires to be loved by his people he desires you to love him because you choose to love him not because you're made to love him John chap 1 John chapter 1 says if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses from sin if we follow this person of light and I liken it to this we're we're following here in this life we're we're following him through a very dark place trying to get to the other side and sometimes it's it's uh it's so dark honestly it feels like I can't see him I don't feel him I don't hear him um I feel at times I can't see him I wonder Lord where are you at come on what happens if we lose sight of that light just for a moment you lose sight just in the darkness you can't see I know what his word says but I don't I don't see it like I need to see it I know his word says that he's my healer but I don't see it like I ought to see it I don't feel it at all how do we get back to him we know his nature I know what type of man he is I know he's a man of the highest Integrity I know he's a man that keeps every word like he said he would that's right and by knowing his nature that guides me back to his word he can always be found in his word we go through so many dark things in our lives as I said you can't see him hear him feel him I mean sometimes you feel like I'm am so alone where are you have you turned your back on me have I fallen so bad that you want nothing to do with me how can we be certain when you were going through that that he will be where he said he would be when you know his word but you just can't see see it when it just doesn't make sense and I and I think about our brother brother Eugene Kennedy uh to the to the outside looking in it don't make no sense for a man to have that kind of Faith to hold on the way that that brother did and to confess like he did and and and and the Lord worked in his life like he did and it doesn't make no sense for it to end the way that it did to someone that does not know him that's offensive yeah yeah but we know him and we can see that that was a crowning of a life the Lord he use that to just squeeze all of that that everything that he wanted all of that perfume that was in my brother's life to squeeze it out of him we can see that this was a son being uh just coming to his PL just being placed that was the crowning of brother Eugene Kennedy's life knowing him knowing him guides us back to his word throughout all the through all the confusion and all the pain and all the questions and I don't understand why this is happening I don't understand what's going on in the world today I don't understand what's going on in my life whatever it might be I know him and though I cannot feel him I trust him yes I know him because I have walked many miles with this man as I as we would say no disrespect you understand what I'm saying I've gone through trials that just it almost nearly broke my mind and you can relate we can all relate in some way I've made so many mistakes yes I have fallen on my face so many times and when I fell I saw his response I saw his response to when I would fall and I would see that every single time I felt he was there sometimes he with a gentle word telling me Pete Pete stand up and give me a hand to help me up sometimes a stern word telling me to stand up and fight but every single time every single time he was there right not one time has he has he abandoned me not one time has he ever abandon you you are here tonight because of the grace of God not because of your own good not because you are so strong it's because of him and through all that I've gone through my mistakes and my flops it's taught me one thing he will never fail me he cannot fail his people he will never turn his back on us there is nothing like the great faithfulness of our God my goodness Abraham this great man of Faith he learned the nature of God through his failures he learned the nature of God and that gave this man faith not faith in himself he gave him faith that he's going to do it he promised me that he was going to do it and he's going to do it because when we think about Abraham and the scripture says he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but then I look at his life much like ours I see when he was called to come out of heran historians say it was inwhere 5 10 15 years that he lingered because he didn't want to separate from his father then we see that he goes into the land and and and things get hard and he runs to Egypt and and gives saraah away you know the story now I to ask you this who who who turned that situation around who fixed that did Abraham did Abraham line up and fix things no because God had swore to this man I will make you a father of Nations and I'm going to see to it right it's my responsibility to see the work in your life completed [Music] amen Abraham's failures I think about ishmail and what a curse that is to the people of God even to this day we see it going over going on over in the Middle East I said again see the his failure with ailec and again giving his wife away when things got tough and these failures they taught Abraham I can trust him yeah not only do I believe in him I can trust him he's going to keep his word in spite of the weakness of My Flesh in spite of how much I might fall how how depressed and down I might get and discouraged he's going to keep his word to me he said he the key he swore by himself not by Abraham in Genesis chapter 15 we can read about the that that that white light how that that this the the Lord commanded Abraham to part the carcasses and lay their bodies and we we hear about this white light coming down and part and passing between those those carcasses now that was an old old I can't say the word herian custom I think is the right word when two men were making a would be making a vow between one another they would take these animals and they'd part the carcasses and lay one to this side one to that side and then they would pass through each man would pass through and say let me become as these dead carcasses if I fail to keep my word yeah when it came time to make this vow with Abraham he put him to sleep said it has nothing to do with you Abraham and that white light came down and and walked between these carcasses and almighty God was was reaffirming to Abraham that let me I I'll say it like this Abraham let me almighty God become as these dead rotten carcasses if I fail to keep my word with you that is how Abraham held on he knew his God would not fail him Abraham didn't begin with no great faith his faith grew yes as he walked this life and he failed and as God stepped in time and time and time again and now we're going to switch gears CU I'm going to try to speed up man to time is a flying now God has many attributes in himself that he throughout the eternity he's desired to express and we all know this but I'm just going to rehash a little bit and we we understand that uh there was a time that he was alone and he he wasn't even God it was just all Darkness except for that great light and um he was alone with his thoughts it's all it was there just him and his thoughts there was nobody there to express them these thoughts too he was the self-existing one all alone with these things within himself that he wanted me and you to know yeah and it was there in that place that he elected each and every one of us that that are elect children of God tonight it was there in that place that he chose us and he and and it was there in that place that he decided I will not let this person be lost thank you Lord I will not let this person fall his mind was made up then that he was going to see us through John chapter chapter 1 says in the beginning was the the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God that logos the same one that met with Abraham in the form of MDC the same one that met with Moses and said Moses I'm going to let you see me but you can't see my face and he put his hand over his face as he as he passed by and as he lifted his his hand as he walked by and Moses could see him from the back and that very same one was made flesh in our Lord Jesus Christ the scripture says that all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made he began to speak and he believed his own word and literally everything that was created came came to pass brother brand said the very ground that you said over tonight is the word of of God materialized he believed his own word his faith in his own word produced every bit of this now I want to ask you a question how in the world can it possibly fail us now if his word can do that how can it fail you today and at the as we close out 2024 I got to find where I'm at how can he fail you when you need healing you need Deliverance yeah he's not going to fail us when it comes to the changing of our bodies amen he's not going to let you down he's going to do what he said he would do he desired to be God back when he was all alone and that desire led to him creating angels and he became an object of worship and we know about the fall and how Lucifer was lifted up and he he turns I think it's 2third of the Angels against him and there was a war in in heaven and Lucifer was cast out and and I'll just say this to you um this is part of why Lucifer hates us so bad and I keep trying to to mark my spot because my eyes they jump around I had issues with dyslexia all my life and it uh the words jump sometimes so I'm uh I apologize but that's why Lucifer hates us so bad one one time one time he made a decision and he's eternally damned for it and he watches us every single day of Our Lives fall on our face make mistakes lose our temper lose our patience lazy growing cold yeah and yet he watches us Time After Time the grace of God is given to us and he hates us for it that's fine I hate him too I mean we look he as he continued on the Lord be God began to create the heavens and the Earth and making everything that he uh he rolls back the the darkness and and says let there be light and he rolls back the waters and he says let the Earth bring forth which means to Bud which shows the patience of God he didn't he didn't just speak a full grown tree he had he planted the seeds in the ground and he said let it bring forth and these seeds slowly this seed slowly grew into this great giant Oak he's a very patient God he created the sun and the moon and the stars all the life that's in the water and uh and and the and the great Wells and the birds and all the cattle and the Beast of the field and all the creeping things and he desired somebody to share all this with he wanted somebody like himself and he said let us make men in her own image and and and he and he forms Adam from the dust of the earth and I I believe it's brother Donnie I heard years ago talking maybe to dramatizing Adam just being this lifeless form with his toes dug down in the dirt like a tree and can you imagine what it must have felt like when when he breathed the breath of life and Adam's eyes open for the first time I mean my goodness I can relate to it to a degree yeah they began to take their walks in the garden with this man having these conversations like a good father will he's a good father began to share his responsibility with his son letting him name his creation and um I've I've heard it dramatized how that they'd be walking through the the garden and Adam could had the ability of the spoken word to say that tree just doesn't seem right and he could speak to it and and uproot that tree and plant it over here because that just seemed like the right spot for it because he so had the mind of God and um he loved sharing that responsibility with his son see to the desire to be a father is a part of his nature and if you've got a good father that helps you understand him a little bit tonight and he placed men as as we go on I'm trying to speed up on on the basis of free moral agen see see he wants to be loved as I said by choice then he sees Adam lonely and I believe he understood how Adam felt because he felt the exact same way he knew Adam was longing for somebody he didn't even know who she was he had a longing inside of him for something and the Lord puts a deep sleep on him and and he performs operation and he takes out of his side uh this this this this Bride named Eve and the Lord lifts this anesthesia from from Adam and he opens his eyes and he sees her for the very first time I can't imagine how that must have felt actually I can I remember the first time I saw my Bambi at the old church sitting out in the parking lot um second service that I'd came here to Happy Valley and my niece Donna was out talking to some of the young girls and I I go go to get my niece Donna and there's this girl standing at the bo at the back of their uh at the back of their her mom and dad's van and I knew in that moment I was going to marry that girl you see the desire to be a husband is a part of his nature and he's a good one then we see man fall in the garden when Eve was deceived by the serpent I won't go in into it too long because it'll take too much time and uh we see the story tell about how here he is running through the garden and um and he's crying out Adam Adam where are you at and here Adam's afraid and he's because he he realizes he's naked and he's tried to cover himself with fig leaves and and uh here and the the Lord has this this conversation with him and he drives him from the garden and I believe that was killing killing his heart just absolutely aching his heart so bad and another great attribute came out of him and he and he took and he slew a lamb and he wrapped him in coats of skins of this lamb and he said I'm going to put enmity between you and the serpent seed I will bring you back because he is by nature a redeemer now get it out of your mind that he does things that are separate from his nature his nature is perfect and brother R said it never changes our nature might change but his nature will never change he is a redeemer by Nature we see the prophets over the course of time and all of them were partial reflections of this great this great nature of God as he would uh I think about Noah when we see the the uh sorry I got to focus my eyes again Noah and the and the justice of God and Abraham and the election of God and we see Moses and in the Deliverance of God and we see David and uh David the king but we also see just in just mindblowing Grace and forgiveness that was given to this man and we see the prophet Hosea and and and and just think about this just crazy Reckless Love between a man and a woman where he just cannot let her go and we see him expressing himself through each of these and with each and every single one of them he might be expressing multiple attributes but each and in each and every one of them there's one attribute that he continually expressed and that is his faithfulness to his people and to his word when he should have turned when he could have he had every right to turn his back on him he refused because he is faithful faithfulness is a part of his nature now when this fall thought first came to me many many years ago and I preached it a couple times and I preached it to the young people once here years ago and then I deleted the file and said I ain't never doing that again and and uh so uh when the Lord put this on my heart needless to say I was uh I can't remember a whole lot brother Rob if it's like the one before or not I don't know um the way that it came to me was I in my mind I saw this eagle and I could see it flying just flying out out out just way way out in the heights of the air and and these words came to me Eagles are Flyers by Nature nobody teaches an eagle to fly nobody makes an eagle to fly they just do it because they're Eagles there are many things that are part of his nature and he does them just ca he because it's who he is yes just as as much as an eagle flies as a fish swims as a horse runs because it's their nature to do it he is by nature many many things brother Brenham said his nature can be defined by by love God is a is a god of love when he brother said when he seen the sin of the world and he seen that men was dying without hope and couldn't be saved yet he knowed that men would would love him he said it strained God and it proved his nature God is love God is love and it strained God's nature until he had to provide a way of of Escape for those that wanted to to escape and he sent his son into the world and that very that that that attribute of his nature is what led to the condescension of God the highest of highs became so low and so humble another great attribute of his nature and he John 3:16 Says that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son did you notice it said he so loved the world not just those that would accept him right those that he knew would turn him down those that he knew would never give him the time of day would never accept him accept him and he still loved them so so much he said I'm going to do it anyway I will become a man and I will pay their price so that they can be saved if they want to be poor homeless an illegitimate name despised and rejected of men yet he did it anyway because he is humble by Nature he can lower himself so down he can lower himself down tonight I don't care where you're at tonight I don't care what you face tonight I don't care how low you are tonight he has the ability to Humble himself down and come to you right where you are there is nothing that you can throw in front of him that he can't help you with tonight I think about the story of Mary Magdalene and this is reveals another great attribute of his nature we all familiar with the story of this little woman was a prostitute and uh the dirty life that she had led and we're familiar with the story of how Simon had had Jesus to come to his house to to make fun of him and to mock him and to um to be rejected even the foot the footwash flunky had nothing to do with him but Jesus went anyway he went anyway why did he go for one he'll go where get where he's invited to go but there's another reason and I believe it's because she was there that going to be there that night and he is A Savior by Nature if he can find a heart that will let him in and let him have control I believe he can save anybody right here right now amen you have not fallen so far in grace that he cannot reach down down and pick you out of it I think about the woman of the well at the well I believe he was there that day at that time for one reason because she was going to be there and he knew a daughter of God needed him and he came even though he was busy no doubt he was tired because he is A Savior by Nature he is also a Healer by Nature brother random said if he ever was a Healer he's still a Healer amen if he ever was a savior he's still a savior if he ever was God he is still God tonight everywhere that he went he healed people yes sir I think about the crippled man couldn't walk so they lowered him through the roof they to literally tore the roof they believed in him so greatly they tore the roof off this building because they could not get this man to Jesus and they lowered him down and when Jesus saw that he it doesn't say he saw that man's faith let this give you hope if you've got lost loved ones tonight maybe their faith ain't going to ain't moving nothing but he saw their faith amen and he looked at this man and he said Son your sins be forgiven why because someone needed him needed a savior and he is by nature a savior someone needed him they needed a Healer and he is by nature A Healer amen if you will just meet him on the grounds of faith and take him at his word I believe that he can heal anybody of anything tonight amen he is a provider by Nature the scripture says he fed the with we're familiar with the stories of feeding the thousands with just a few fish and loaves of bread but he wasn't doing that to show off the scripture says he felt compassion he felt compassion for these people because they'd been out all day long and they were tired and they had a need and he was very aware of that need that is why we have the story of the Loaves and Fishes because he is by nature a provider there is no need that you could have that he can't meet tonight amen I've told this story before and I don't know if you if I mention it here or not but years ago me bamb when we first got married we didn't have two nickels to rub together hardly and we heard brother Jess and they it was the weekend that they take up their their missionary offering and we had just filled up the car um with gas and I was going to be able to get me home from Ohio and ready for my work week and brother J was taking up this offering and as I sat there the Holy Ghost spoke to me and said write a check for $52 so Bambi looked at me I had no Bambi took care of the bills I had no idea what we had baby looked at me she said what do you want me to write it for I said write it For $52 she said babe that's literally every penny that we've got we have exactly $52 I said write the check she wrote the check for this missionary offering For $52 when we got home there was a check in the mailbox a doctor had he felt had sent us a check for $52 because he felt like we'd overpaid on a bill and he wanted to reimburse us who in the world ever heard of a doctor doing something like that he is a provider tonight he is very aware of you tonight amen he is a deliverer by Nature we're familiar with the story of the Canaanite woman who had a daughter that was grievously vexed with the Devil the scripture says and when she came to Jesus he ignored her and then when he finally did speak to her he said you ain't nothing but a dog and it ain't right for me to take the children's bread and give it to a dog and this little woman her faith was so strong she said that is exactly right Lord I ain't nothing but a dog but even a dog eats from the crumbs that falls from their master's table see she had the right attitude toward the promise of God and that right attitude toward the promise of God led to her daughter being delivered of this demon that had plagued her why because he is a deliverer by Nature Psalms chapter says that the Lord will be a refuge for the oppressed a place that we can run when we're so weighed down that my knees are buckling and the mental is worse than the physical I think about the lepers and the and the little woman with the issue of blood what they were going through physically was horrible but the mental aspect of that being completely cast out nobody having nothing to do with with them they feeling like they were unclean completely cast out of society yeah I think about little Georgie Carter what she was going through physically was terrible but what that girl was going through in her mind amen a teenage girl who had wasted away to 35 lbs I and you did different varies but I found a place where he said 35 lbs a rubber draw she under to because of her kidneys and her bows just to draw it out from underneath her can you imagine how oppressive that must have felt 9 years and 8 months in bed unable to walk just looking at the walls and the only thing that she sees is is her condition the only thing that she feels is hopelessness but she had a refuge that she could go to a refuge for the oppressed that she could run to yes and she began to cry out and a prophet of God had a vision of a lamb that was called out in the wilderness crying out for help and when he found her I love the story about how her mother saw a shadow walking in that day walk as he was going in to pray for or to speak the word of the Lord poured over her and she saw a shadow on the wall it was the shadow of Jesus Christ himself as that man was walking in Jesus Christ was walking before him why a daughter of God was oppressed in her mind and in her body amen and she was crying out for help and within a few minutes that same girl was sitting at the piano playing there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from evangels veins amen why because he is by nature a deliverer you can trust in it you can rest your soul in [Music] it I'm winding out I promise you he is by nature a chain breaker we read a story about Jesus one time stopped a meeting to go across a stormy sea one time to a man named Legion now what everybody else saw was a maniac yes sir demon possessed living in the tombs worthless they had no value for this man but Jesus I saw a man that was hurting a man that no doubt had become no stranger to rejection to failure to pain and many times failure it just leads to guilt and guilt leads to shame and shame leads to isolation and you find yourself cut off from the body of Jesus Christ and you grow deeper in sin all because of pain you must allow him to heal your pain when you go through it friends don't carry that around he's talking to somebody tonight don't carry that around with you give it to God let him take it away let him set you free tonight amen you don't have to live the the rest of your life guilty and ashamed of yourself legion's mind was completely gone but his soul was crying out for help brother Brenham said I see him that night crossing the sea the waves are roaring and why did that man take that chance after after sitting teaching all day Healing The Sick we find now out in a little ship coming across the sea because over in another land in gadera one Soul was calling for him he left hundreds maybe thousands because one man who was bound who didn't have it the sense as we would say in his own mind to cry out for help but his soul was crying out I believe that was a Son of God that needed to be set free amen said he come from the side of the lake through the storms all night long to the next day the storm the great tide that night to heal one person and I'll say this my brother he'd come from Glory this afternoon to set any one of you free tonight just let him find one sincere heart one person who at who desires to be free one person that is that is calling out amen that's all it takes for you to be free tonight thank you Lord he'll come any time of the day anytime at night he will speak through you or speak to you through a dumb hillbilly that's illiterate uneducated dyslexic most of society would say worthless just to talk to you tonight if you would stand musicians if you would come how can relate to this man as I've told you before a little bit about my story as a kid growing up my mom and dad were good people but they had a both of them had mental issues uh my dad had a really bad mental breakdown when his dad died completely lost his mind and uh my mom also um the only person in her family that was like it and she was like that they say after her dad died when she was was just a little girl and um my mama crossed a lot of lines um uh I went to school a lot of times with with my shirt and buttoned up to my neck with with bloody welps from neck to ankles and um and and uh and busted lips and um and don't think bad of her I I feel sorry for her she was a good woman she honestly tried um but she just uh she fought things herself and uh didn't have much teaching there was no Deliverance in in the church back home and um it's very common for us kids uh to see demons walking through our house um talking to us uh is a regular occurrence piano playing by itself um as a kid I remember being because of things that I saw and the things that I went through I remember being just so uh shook up I had ulcers really really bad I was diagnosed in the second grade I believe and the doctor told my mom that I would I would probably die of stomach cancer before I graduated high school and um I I would lay I go to bed at night as a kid and I'd put my head under the cover and and and I'm trying not to say too much but I'm trying to say enough so forgive me if I say too much um get what I'm trying my point um and I'd hold the the covers over my head just real tight and and I and I'd lay there all night long because I I was so afraid of what I'd see when I rolled the when I pulled the covers back and there was a woman from my my area uh who did things sexually with me and my brother from the time I was just a child probably four or five years old and uh remember as a kid just feeling so guilty feeling so dirty and uh I hadn't done nothing wrong but something had been done to me and and uh time goes on and my brother James gets killed as I've told you the story and and uh I would have these reoccurring nightmares so often and is every night of my life and from from the age of 15 to 27 and just reliving that moment and trying to save him and and uh it just uh it just scarred my spirit so bad and and uh I still have them occasionally when this flood happened cuz my brother drowned really messed with me um I wanted so bad to get those people out of the water so they get them back to their family um cuz I remember how I felt that day on the river um knowing my brother's out there and I wanted get please get him out of the water so that we can have him we can bury him and um no long after my brother died my mom and my dad told me and it was just it was bitterness it was pain and both of them had again just mental health issues and my mom told me she mom and dad told me said when we found out that one of her sons was dead we wished it was you Pete and I had a minister say in the area that my brother James Lawson was frying in H where he belonged and as a young man my heart began to turn and I got so hard I got so angry I would could say such Blasphemous things I would say such horrible things about him just I'd walk out out in the yard and just scream at the sky and challenge him come stand before me like a man why just I pain that didn't

everybody that I hated him I can considered myself to be his enemy why was he faithful it was not faithful to the goodness of a man he was faithful to his election he chose us before the foundation of the world he chose you before you even set foot on this Earth he knew every mistake you would make he knew every flaw that you would have and yet he chose you amen he will not fill us now how can I

trusting in it you got to trust in that parachute that it's going to do what it's designed to do and what it's it's supposed to do to jump out of that plane so if you want something from the Lord tonight you're going to have to jump out you're going to have to jump out of the parachute this uh this jump out of the plane with this parachute of faith on your back take him out his word and believe him trust him throw yourself at throw yourself at his feet and say there is no turning back there is no alternative I'm 100% in it I will die before I will turn back before I'll change my mind before I before I will confess anything differently am trust him don't just believe in him trust him he'll keep his word for you brother sister Lord bless you amen praise the Lord amen I appreciate
