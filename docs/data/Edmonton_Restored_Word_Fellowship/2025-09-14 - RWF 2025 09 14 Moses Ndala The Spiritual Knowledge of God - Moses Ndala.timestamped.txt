[21:10] Heard about his healing
[21:14] of his cleansing power revealing
[21:19] how he made the lame to walk again and
[21:24] cause the blind to see.
[21:28] And then I cried, "Dear Jesus,

[39:04] &gt;&gt; Wonderful comment that he made and that
[39:07] stuck with me for the week and just
[39:09] today again God has reminded me that
[39:12] he's the one in the business of
[39:13] salvation.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; God bless you richly and bless your
[39:16] sister and thank you for for the
[39:18] Matendos sisters. They're not mandos
[39:21] anymore.
[39:23] We still call them matendos, but
[39:28] I was communicating with with my dear
[39:30] sister Aman. And I look at the last
[39:33] name. I was like, okay, I need to
[39:34] memorize this new last name.
[39:37] I just liked it. And God bless you. We
[39:39] appreciate you. Appreciate the gift and
[39:42] your life. You have been serving the
[39:44] Lord. God bless you richly. We
[39:45] appreciate you richly. Thank you for the
[39:47] special that you sang there. It's a city
[39:50] where we are going. Amen.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; And uh there won't be any cry. There
[39:54] won't be any sorrow in that city. We are
[39:57] looking for it. That's why we are here
[39:59] for that.
[40:01] He's desiring to have fellowship with us
[40:02] and we desire to have fellowship with
[40:04] him. Amen. Thank you.

[40:12] go to our studies. Thank you musicians.
[40:14] God bless you all.
[40:28] Second Peter chapter 1 5
[40:36] be reading these scriptures for couple
[40:38] of days again ahead in front of us. I
[40:42] just want to
[40:45] to put your to bring your attention
[40:48] something here.
[40:50] Simon Peter, the Bible says, Simon
[40:52] Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus
[40:54] Christ to them that they have obtained
[40:58] like precious faith with us through the
[41:01] righteousness of God. Can you say with
[41:04] me, through the righteousness of God?
[41:07] Amen.
[41:08] through the righteousness of God and our
[41:10] savior Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be
[41:14] multiplied unto you once again through
[41:17] the righteousness of God.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; God and of Jesus our Lord and according
[41:25] as his divine power has given unto us
[41:29] all things that pertain unto life and
[41:32] godliness through the knowledge of him.
[41:36] Let's say together, through the
[41:37] knowledge of him that have called us to
[41:41] glory and virtue. Thank you. Whereby I
[41:45] given unto us exceeding great and
[41:47] precious promises, that by these you
[41:50] might be partakers of the divine nature,
[41:54] having escaped the corruption that is in
[41:57] the world through lust. and beside this
[42:01] giving all diligence at your faith
[42:04] virtue and to virtue knowledge. Amen.
[42:07] May God bless his word and we can have a
[42:09] seat. Amen.
[42:21] I would like to speak this morning about
[42:23] the spiritual knowledge of God as a as a
[42:26] third attribute on our on our
[42:29] construction our building block to get
[42:31] to the statue of a perfect man. So the
[42:33] third
[42:35] attribute there of the knowledge and
[42:38] knowledge the spiritual knowledge of
[42:41] God. I would like to read again in 2
[42:44] Corinthians 10:36.
[42:47] For though we know, for though we walk
[42:49] in the flesh, we do not war after the
[42:52] flesh. For the weapons of our warfare
[42:54] are not carnal, but they are mighty
[42:58] through God through the pulling down of
[43:00] strongholds,
[43:01] casting down imaginations,
[43:04] and every high thing that exaltth itself
[43:08] against the knowledge of God, and
[43:11] bringing into captivity every thought to
[43:14] the obedience of Christ, and having a
[43:17] readiness, a readiness to revenge all
[43:20] disobedience when your disobedience when
[43:23] your obedience is fulfilled. So the war
[43:26] that we have is war against imaginations
[43:29] against thought against against what you
[43:33] are thinking or your unbelief anything
[43:35] that is exalting itself against that
[43:38] knowledge of God. So that's where the
[43:41] war is actually. So it's a very
[43:43] important part. Sometimes we might
[43:45] neglect it or sometimes we look over it
[43:47] and we think okay that's just that's a
[43:49] good name or something like that. But
[43:52] actually very important in our warfare
[43:54] against the enemy. It's a knowledge of
[43:58] the of knowledge of God and we know that
[44:00] the knowledge of God is knowledge of
[44:02] Christ and Christ is the word. Amen. So
[44:05] that's what we like just to look for a
[44:07] moment here just to to to challenge
[44:10] oursel a little bit and also just for
[44:12] the word of God to prickle our heart and
[44:15] also to recognize what God has done in
[44:17] our life by opening the word of God that
[44:21] today we have the full interpretation.
[44:24] We have the perfect interpretation of
[44:26] the word of God with perfect
[44:28] vindication. Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:43] for those who have a book and follow
[44:45] that. I will I think my
[44:49] my comment will be from
[44:56] from paragraph 160
[45:00] to paragraph
[45:05] to paragraph 218.
[45:07] So that portion there. So that's where
[45:11] most of the thought comes and the
[45:13] comment of the prophet.
[45:17] So the prophet says in the statue of the
[45:19] perfect man, he says that's supreme
[45:22] knowledge.
[45:23] That's supreme knowledge. You don't have
[45:26] to h you don't have to have four degrees
[45:30] in some college or something like that
[45:33] to have it because all these virtues are
[45:37] given to you by God
[45:39] &gt;&gt; to place upon the foundation of your
[45:42] faith that you might come to the full
[45:45] stature of a real living man of God.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; As we talk about knowledge, it might
[45:50] look like it's something that ourself we
[45:53] have to acquire. without something that
[45:55] ourel we can pile it on it let me let me
[45:58] try to know him let me try to let let me
[46:01] try to know him let me to have more
[46:03] knowledge it sounds like that and and I
[46:05] would say I I have to be sincere with me
[46:07] there is a part of it and yeah there's a
[46:09] part of it but it's not everything about
[46:12] that only there is a part where God has
[46:15] to extend or to give us that virtue of
[46:19] knowledge of himself amen that's why
[46:22] it's important so just having a carnal
[46:24] knowledge is not is not enough or is not
[46:27] sufficient. Amen. We need a portion
[46:30] where God himself has to intervene
[46:33] because these virtues all of them have
[46:36] to be given by God. Amen. We don't pluck
[46:39] them upon ourself and say okay this is
[46:41] my doing this is my myself. Yeah, there
[46:44] is a portion of where we have ourself to
[46:46] make diligence as the Bible gives us um
[46:50] gives us recommend us or earn us to to
[46:52] do. But it's not everything. There is a
[46:55] part where God himself has to do the
[46:57] supernatural work. Amen. But the
[47:00] foundation of all this has to be
[47:02] revelation. The foundation of all this
[47:04] has to be faith. I repeat it again. The
[47:07] foundation of all this has to be faith
[47:09] because that's what the prophet says.
[47:11] When you say I'll take God now you don't
[47:13] say that just to say well I take it or
[47:16] just from your heart
[47:19] but it's something in you it actually
[47:22] your faith that is pushes him out your
[47:24] faith pushed out there there you are
[47:27] your faith says I know he's the same
[47:29] amen is witness in him the same there's
[47:32] nothing can take it away from me I know
[47:35] is real prophet says amen then add that
[47:38] your faith let it down let sit down on
[47:41] the foundation. Come up now. Come up
[47:43] right on towards the kingdom of God. Got
[47:46] to a spot now. So there is a faith as as
[47:50] you are growing up. It's your
[47:51] revelation. It's like a seed. Like a
[47:53] plant that many times but that
[47:56] illustration stays with us. It's like a
[47:58] plant, a little plant, the seed. Inside
[48:00] of that seed, there is everything.
[48:02] Inside of the new birth that you had as
[48:04] a foundation, there is everything. But
[48:06] it has to grow. It's from that same
[48:09] seed, from the same life that was in
[48:10] that seed. It has to go. It's pushing
[48:13] out. It's pushing out. It will push out
[48:15] faith. It will push out virtue,
[48:17] knowledge, and all the other virtues
[48:19] until it come to the to the stature of
[48:22] of the fullness of Christ himself. So
[48:25] always keep that in mind. It has to be
[48:28] God doing the supernatural work. Amen.
[48:31] Because if you just go then just going
[48:34] to to school and learn things or I'll
[48:37] say or if you just rely on that you're
[48:39] going to fall around somewhere. So it
[48:41] has to be God doing the supernatural
[48:44] work. And says the thirdly you add
[48:46] knowledge knowledge. Now that don't mean
[48:49] wordly knowledge because that fullness
[48:52] foolishness to God. Worldly knowledge is
[48:55] foolishness to God. But knowledge to
[48:58] judge say judge what? Right from wrong.
[49:02] How to judge it. Then you've got
[49:04] Christian knowledge with your virtue and
[49:06] faith. You judge whether the world is
[49:09] right or wrong. If you can lay aside all
[49:12] your creeds and all your unbelief and
[49:14] everything that you claim you have, then
[49:16] you have knowledge to believe God cannot
[49:19] lie. Let every man's word be a lie, but
[49:22] mine be true. Amen.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; That's a wonderful paragraph there. So
[49:26] we can just try to try to to unveil a
[49:29] bit more of it. So that doesn't mean
[49:31] worldly knowledge because it is
[49:33] foolishness to God. So why usually the
[49:36] prophet repeats that many and the Bible
[49:38] repeats that many times. Why why why is
[49:41] emphasizing so much on the fact that the
[49:44] worldly knowledge is a foolishness to
[49:47] God. We cannot rely on worldly
[49:51] knowledge. actually worldly knowledge if
[49:54] you're not very careful it might lead
[49:56] you away from God
[49:58] &gt;&gt; then bring you closer to God. In 1
[50:02] Corinthians 3:18 the Bible says let no
[50:05] man deceive himself. If any man among
[50:08] you seemth to be wise in this world let
[50:11] him become a fool that he may be wise.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; That's quite the paradox. That's quite
[50:16] that something goes around. Let him
[50:18] become a fool so that might be wise. For
[50:21] the wisdom of this world is foolishness
[50:23] with God.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; For it is written, he taketh the wise in
[50:27] their in in their own craft craft
[50:29] craftiness. And again the Lord knoweth
[50:32] the thought of the wise that they are
[50:34] vain. I'm not against education. Prophet
[50:37] is not against education. God is not
[50:40] against education.
[50:43] If I have just to put a little bit as a
[50:44] comment here, just put a paragraph here.
[50:46] Don't put that on emphasis on that. I
[50:49] like education. I love education. I
[50:52] encourage my children to do education
[50:55] myself. I have a
[50:57] I'll say education.
[51:00] Let's put that way. I have education.
[51:02] Education. I have four degrees at
[51:04] university.
[51:06] They made me study and I and I love
[51:08] study. I love studying. It's like it's
[51:10] like my hobby when I'm there. I can I
[51:13] can spend weeks and weeks just reading
[51:14] and everything that that I and close
[51:17] from the world I can do that that that
[51:19] so I'm a little bit scholar scholar how
[51:21] do you scholarly person right just like
[51:24] to study that's how I made I made uh so
[51:28] I like education everything is but I
[51:30] just want to put here a little emphasis
[51:32] to know that
[51:34] education has actually
[51:37] is is something if you're not very
[51:40] careful as I said earlier Here it's
[51:43] something if you are not very careful it
[51:45] makes you to reason. It makes you to
[51:48] think. It makes you to analyze things.
[51:51] It makes you things has to be logical
[51:53] before you accept it.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; But God is not something that you can
[51:57] take by logical by logic and okay this
[52:00] is this this and okay then it has to be
[52:01] this and that it and I figure it out. I
[52:03] figure out God how he works and that's
[52:05] it and then I put him in the box. You
[52:07] can't put God in a box.
[52:10] God is unlimited. God is great. God is
[52:13] is infinite. So science can never
[52:16] comprehend God. Education can never
[52:19] comprehend God. Can never understand
[52:21] God. So the more educated you become,
[52:24] let me tell you, the more prudent you
[52:27] should be to realize, oh God, now I'm
[52:30] becoming more and more um prone to be
[52:33] deceived
[52:35] &gt;&gt; because the devil likes to work on
[52:38] reasoning. But how we came to Eve? He
[52:40] came by reasoning. Came by think you
[52:42] know it doesn't make sense that this
[52:44] this can do this. Amen. So you have to
[52:46] come and the more educated you are
[52:48] becoming and especially in Leodia in the
[52:52] time we are living you can listen to the
[52:54] radio. You can listen to the Christian
[52:56] to the Christian radio and things. Most
[52:59] of the preachers have to be PhD doctor
[53:02] in this doctor in this doctor in this
[53:03] doctor in this right because they put
[53:06] that credit on them like we have to
[53:08] study God and make that yes there's a
[53:10] certain value but if you put emphasis
[53:13] like on that then you are putting God
[53:15] aside
[53:16] &gt;&gt; God is simple God is so simple if you
[53:21] try to make God so complicated to people
[53:24] then people lose it
[53:26] &gt;&gt; and Paul was Paul was like Paul was very
[53:29] educative, very scholarly God. But he
[53:31] had to remove everything that he had of
[53:34] the scholar and everything that the
[53:35] degree that he had to realize that he
[53:38] was nothing. Then God was ready to use
[53:40] him.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; The same thing for Moses. He was very
[53:44] well educated and he knew everything
[53:46] about science and everything. He had 40
[53:48] years of training in Egyptian. God had
[53:51] to take 40 years to remove all that so
[53:54] that God can start using him. Amen.
[53:57] So when we realize that as a Christian
[53:59] especially in this Laia
[54:02] I'm talking maybe just a small portion
[54:04] of people in that in that area every
[54:06] time you go in big studies you have to
[54:09] realize oh I need to depend on God more
[54:14] &gt;&gt; because when I go higher I become start
[54:17] thinking that I know you don't know
[54:19] anything
[54:21] &gt;&gt; actually when you know more you actually
[54:23] becoming more an in you might become Can
[54:26] you prone to be an instrument of the
[54:28] dava?
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; The same thing for beauty. The David
[54:33] works in beauty. Oh. Oh. When everybody
[54:37] looks at, oh, wow, what a beautiful
[54:39] girl. Oh, what a handsome boy.
[54:43] As a Christian, it's a danger.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; It's not wrong by itself. Actually, it's
[54:48] a blessing for whoever you're married
[54:51] to. Like my wife is blessed by marrying
[54:53] me.
[54:56] I'm just saying that as a to relax you a
[54:58] little bit but it's actually a problem
[55:02] because you become a target.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; The devil can use you to put many people
[55:08] in hell than any other thing.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; So when you recognize that then you say
[55:12] okay let me protect it's my weakness.
[55:15] Let me try to protect myself. If it's a
[55:17] girl let me dress up properly. Let me
[55:20] let me be decent because I'm be I'm I'm
[55:23] becoming more of a target that the enemy
[55:25] can use
[55:26] &gt;&gt; to to bring his children down.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; The same thing for we we we know as a
[55:32] message believer, as a Christian, we
[55:33] know how the devil works now, right?
[55:35] &gt;&gt; The same thing for for for popularity.
[55:39] But I'm saying use his popularity. When
[55:41] you're just simple Christians, oh,
[55:43] everything is fine. But when you become
[55:45] start became popular, oh that's a very
[55:48] wonderful preacher. Have you heard about
[55:50] this? This is the only one for
[55:52] convention. These are
[55:54] &gt;&gt; as yourself when you hear that. So God
[55:56] help me to humble myself because I'm
[55:58] becoming more and more as a target. Can
[56:01] be a song leader. It can be whoever it
[56:03] can be the one who prays. Every time
[56:05] that you start getting higher, remember
[56:08] you are becoming a target for the enemy.
[56:10] So you need to oh Lord, I'm this is my
[56:12] weakness. Let me protect it. Let me be
[56:14] humble. Let me dedicate myself.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; The same thing for money. Oh, when
[56:22] you're just a simple citizen and
[56:24] everything, everything is okay. But once
[56:26] you have a promotion, anything like
[56:29] this, anything, then you start going to
[56:32] Lamborghini. Let me take that example.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Lamborghini.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Lamborghini
[56:37] or L.
[56:40] Oh, wherever it's going. Oh. CRV
[56:44] CRV CRV so far.
[56:47] Oh, I wish I was rich.
[56:51] Then remember target.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; So God, help me to be humble.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Help me to be humble.
[57:01] So going back to to to knowledge here
[57:04] because it there is there's a very
[57:06] connection between knowledge in the
[57:08] world and knowledge and we might might
[57:10] be a little bit confusion let's put it
[57:13] this way between knowledge in the world
[57:14] and knowledge of God himself.
[57:18] The knowledge of the world actually
[57:20] studied and civilization studied with
[57:22] the line of Cain not with the line of
[57:25] Abel.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says in Genesis 4:17,
[57:30] "Kain knew his wife and she conceived
[57:32] and bare Enoch and he builded a city and
[57:35] called the name of the city after the
[57:37] name of his son Enoch." So Kane was the
[57:41] one who built the first recorded city.
[57:44] It's actually the beginning of of
[57:47] civilization.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; So civilization is not necessarily
[57:50] something you say, "Oh, now these are
[57:52] more civilized people. Oh, we are, you
[57:55] know, the more civilized you become, the
[57:58] more worldliness come into it.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; There's always been like that.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Always been like that. The more
[58:04] civilized you become, the more
[58:06] worldliness will will will come into
[58:08] that city. You see, it's very easy to
[58:11] convert an educated even
[58:15] &gt;&gt; someone without know anything.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; But it's very hard to to convince
[58:21] even an elect. Very hard. You have to
[58:23] work a little bit harder
[58:25] because he has been educated and
[58:27] different things. Let's try to analyze
[58:29] that the prophet himself saying it's
[58:31] very hard to to be convinced a educated
[58:35] heathen because it's very hard. Why
[58:36] civilization is always against God. You
[58:39] see in many village maybe in Africa
[58:41] where where many people have gone
[58:44] evangel evangelized you go there in a
[58:46] town where there's no television. Oh
[58:49] people are decent people. But the moment
[58:52] where television goes there or internet
[58:54] goes there, civilization goes there,
[58:56] worldliness follows.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Civilization because it has been
[59:00] from the beginning the work of the line
[59:02] of Cain. And Cain is a of the serpent
[59:05] seed.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; He's from the line of Satan. Amen. He
[59:09] didn't he was not a son of God. Was the
[59:11] son of the serpent. Amen.
[59:14] Genesis 4:20 says, "And
[59:18] Jebel, this is the genealogy of of Cain.
[59:21] If you go the genealogy of of Abel of
[59:24] Jesus going there, you'll go it go back
[59:26] all all the way to to to Adam, the son
[59:29] of God. But but you go if you go from
[59:32] from Cain doesn't go to that he was the
[59:34] son of Adam. So he was the son of
[59:37] someone else. And Adam B Jabel and he
[59:41] was the father of such as dwelt in the
[59:43] tent of such as have cattle and his
[59:46] brother's name was Jabel and he was the
[59:48] father of all such a handle the hop and
[59:51] organ and zil she also bear tubal and an
[59:55] instructor of every artificer and brass
[59:59] and iron and the sister of tubalen was
[1:00:02] nama. So there was the father of
[1:00:04] herders, the animals, the father of
[1:00:08] music, the musical instrument and the
[1:00:10] first known methologist of the one who
[1:00:12] was working with brass and iron all were
[1:00:15] from the line of gain. But if you look
[1:00:18] from the line of Abel, just simple
[1:00:21] people, just a simple simple population,
[1:00:25] just simple herder and shepherd
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; and and that's how God wanted it to be.
[1:00:30] Amen.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:32] Are you with me ding?
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God hides and reveals
[1:00:36] himself in simplicity.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Even Jesus Christ himself thanked the
[1:00:40] father for revealing the spiritual truth
[1:00:44] only to the babes. Amen. In Matthew
[1:00:46] 11:25 says, "At that time Jesus answered
[1:00:49] and said, I thank thee, oh father, Lord
[1:00:52] of heaven and earth, because thou has
[1:00:54] hed these things from the wise and
[1:00:56] prudent, and you have revealed them unto
[1:00:58] babes." And the prophet will say unto
[1:01:00] babes such as are willing to learn.
[1:01:03] Amen. Babes are willing to learn. Amen.
[1:01:06] So we have to be willing to learn. We
[1:01:08] are living in a year where people know
[1:01:11] everything. They know it. They're not it
[1:01:14] all. You want to tell them something.
[1:01:16] Oh, I know it. If you know even we
[1:01:18] talking fellowship with the with the
[1:01:20] with the brother yesterday.
[1:01:22] Brother Elisha came to our place and we
[1:01:24] fellowship. We know how our children
[1:01:26] educate them from the very young age. I
[1:01:28] know. You ask him, can you this? I know.
[1:01:32] Even though they don't know, but it's
[1:01:34] the first thing. I know. Can you I know.
[1:01:37] Why? I know. Because it's knowledge.
[1:01:39] Knowledge. Knowledge.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; But you don't know. You have to be
[1:01:43] willing to learn.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that spirit gets into
[1:01:47] sometimes into the church too.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; So no, I I know. Oh, I know. I have
[1:01:51] access all to the tapes. I don't need to
[1:01:53] come to church. Why minister? I know.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; That's true. Yeah.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Yeah. And sometimes they know
[1:01:59] more than the preacher. Yeah.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sometimes and then they correct
[1:02:02] you and you know but I'm saying oh yeah
[1:02:04] you know. Yeah for sure. But can we have
[1:02:07] that spirit Lord I desire to learn more.
[1:02:10] I desire to be humble. I desire father
[1:02:13] Lord to follow your order. I desire to
[1:02:16] be obedient. Touch my heart. Make me
[1:02:18] like that sheep is the first song we
[1:02:20] help me if if possible to lose some of
[1:02:22] my rights, human rights. Amen. So that
[1:02:25] to be under the order of God.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, keep us that heart that is humble
[1:02:30] and simple. That what we desire to be
[1:02:33] should never lose that become the
[1:02:35] simplicity of the go. The gospel is
[1:02:37] simple. Amen. The life of it. The gospel
[1:02:40] is just a life. Amen. It's not even a
[1:02:43] carnal knowledge. It's just a life.
[1:02:45] Amen. That's what we desire.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Paul said in Philippians 3, he says,
[1:02:50] "But what things were gained to me those
[1:02:52] I counted loss for Christ. Yeah,
[1:02:55] doubtless and I count all things but
[1:02:57] loss for the excellency of the knowledge
[1:03:00] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[1:03:03] suffered a loss of all things and to
[1:03:06] count them but done that I may win
[1:03:09] Christ.
[1:03:10] He was very educated but he saw this is
[1:03:12] that I can't win Christ with all this I
[1:03:15] put that aside and let me humble myself
[1:03:18] and learn from Christ himself. He go he
[1:03:21] goes further in 1 Corinthians 1 just a
[1:03:24] teaching this morning. Amen. 1
[1:03:26] Corinthians 1:17:31 says, "For Christ
[1:03:29] sent me not to baptize but to preach the
[1:03:32] gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest
[1:03:35] the cross of Christ should be made of
[1:03:37] none effect.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; If the preaching of Christ was based on
[1:03:42] how eloquent you are and how educated
[1:03:44] you are, you will make the cross of
[1:03:47] Christ of non effect. It will be
[1:03:49] depending on people's ability. Amen.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; But the himself Paul says, "But for the
[1:03:55] preaching of the cross is to them that
[1:03:57] perish foolishness, but unto us which
[1:04:00] are saved, it is the power of God."
[1:04:03] Amen. In that simplicity, it's still the
[1:04:06] power of God.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; It has the power to change. It has the
[1:04:09] power to transform. It has the power to
[1:04:11] heal. Is the power to give a sane mind
[1:04:14] in that simplicity of the gospel. Amen.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. For it is return, it is written, I
[1:04:21] will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and
[1:04:22] will bring to nothing the understanding
[1:04:25] of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where
[1:04:28] is the scribe? Where is the disputer of
[1:04:30] this world? Have not God made foolish
[1:04:33] the wisdom of this world? For after that
[1:04:36] in the wisdom of God, the world by
[1:04:38] wisdom knew not God? It pleased God by
[1:04:41] the foolishness of preaching to save
[1:04:44] them that believe.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. the foolishness of preaching. I
[1:04:48] was listening to the prophet. He says,
[1:04:49] you know, why people are making why the
[1:04:52] business the business you know he was
[1:04:54] how do you call the business go you know
[1:04:56] the business people he was talking to
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; business
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; businessman
[1:05:01] go through the gospel business. So they
[1:05:03] took over over the preacher said no we
[1:05:05] will take over because we are more rich
[1:05:08] more educated those simple preachers
[1:05:10] here they have no education everything
[1:05:12] so we take over them. The prophet says,
[1:05:14] "No, that's not the order. You have not
[1:05:16] been called. Don't try to make don't try
[1:05:19] to correct God. That's the order of God.
[1:05:22] Calling a preacher is a call from inside
[1:05:25] whether he's educated or not educated,
[1:05:27] whether he makes his sentence correct or
[1:05:29] not." Amen. But as long as standing upon
[1:05:32] the word of God, you stand behind him.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Because what is saving what Paul is that
[1:05:39] what Paul is saying it please God by the
[1:05:42] foolishness of preaching to save them
[1:05:44] that believe.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Think about John the Baptist. I usually
[1:05:48] make my wife like that. John the Baptist
[1:05:50] he was not taking a shower. He was not
[1:05:53] you know he was not dressed properly.
[1:05:55] You come to his congregation even my
[1:05:59] brother gosh could smell he's here but
[1:06:01] he could smell so you in the
[1:06:03] congregation
[1:06:05] but that was the gospel for the time
[1:06:08] without him the way could not be
[1:06:10] prepared for the Messiah God uses simple
[1:06:13] things very simple things to show his
[1:06:16] power because he want to take on the
[1:06:19] glory the glory should not be upon a man
[1:06:21] it has to go back to God himself
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; that the order has made and no one
[1:06:26] should change him. He's the infinite
[1:06:28] God, but he chose you to do it. So,
[1:06:29] amen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; So don't think whenever you think I'm a
[1:06:34] very educated, why should I go and sit
[1:06:36] on an uneducated person?
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Bad road you already going. That's the
[1:06:42] Satan road. Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Actually, the more I'm educated, I
[1:06:46] should sit more
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; because I'm being a people from the
[1:06:50] world are bombarding me with different
[1:06:52] things. Now God needs also to fill him
[1:06:56] me with it's it's a law. There is only
[1:06:58] one container right everybody want to
[1:07:01] fill in that same container. The world
[1:07:03] want to fill something inside of you.
[1:07:05] You also need to feed yourself with the
[1:07:07] word of God so that you remove all the
[1:07:09] other things. Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; I'm on a knowledge. So are you with me?
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Just part of me.
[1:07:22] It's not target to anybody. There no
[1:07:24] one. If there is one, it's I'm the first
[1:07:26] first. I have four degrees. Useless
[1:07:28] degrees.
[1:07:30] They help me for the job. I have a good
[1:07:32] job by God's grace. But some people did
[1:07:36] just a certificate and I'm working with
[1:07:37] them
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; and they are earning the same money I'm
[1:07:40] earning. But I spent 12 years, 14 years
[1:07:44] university.
[1:07:46] Too much knowledge. But then when I look
[1:07:49] at the word of God, that's still the
[1:07:51] absolute no matter what.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; For the Jews require a sign, and the
[1:08:04] Greeks seeks after wisdom. For we preach
[1:08:07] Christ crucified unto the Jews a
[1:08:10] stumbling block. Why aren't the Jews a
[1:08:13] stumbling block? Because they were
[1:08:14] expecting a great Messiah. The great
[1:08:17] messiah will come the chariot is the
[1:08:18] king is like David is the everybody
[1:08:21] should respect but now Paul is preaching
[1:08:23] to them Christ not even Christ healing
[1:08:26] or Christ when when is like Christ in
[1:08:29] the power Christ crucified
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; that that's my king
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; crucified naked that's why you are
[1:08:37] preaching to me as a Jew no no no no
[1:08:40] stumbling block no we don't want that we
[1:08:42] want a famous king like like soul all
[1:08:46] then we know our
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; stumbling block.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; And to the Greek foolishness because the
[1:08:54] Greek at that time they like to reason.
[1:08:56] Oh how does it make sense here? Let's
[1:08:58] go. If you say this sentence after that
[1:09:00] you know we learn philosophy you say
[1:09:02] this and then you can't contradict what
[1:09:04] you say before and but how can you teach
[1:09:06] to me something about Jesus Christ? Oh
[1:09:08] the Bible says you know don't speak to
[1:09:10] the foolish and the next verse speak to
[1:09:12] the foolish. How can you explain to me
[1:09:14] that I I can't explain to you. I just
[1:09:16] say
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime you can't explain. We
[1:09:21] just believe.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; But unto them which are called both Jews
[1:09:26] and Greeks, Christ the power of God and
[1:09:29] the wisdom of God. Because the
[1:09:31] foolishness of God is wiser than man,
[1:09:34] and the weakness of God is stronger than
[1:09:36] man. For you see your calling, brethren,
[1:09:38] now that not many wise men,
[1:09:42] not many wise men after the flesh, not
[1:09:45] many mighty, not many noble are called,
[1:09:48] but God has chosen the foolish things of
[1:09:51] the world to confound the wise. And God
[1:09:53] has chosen the weak things of the world
[1:09:55] to confound the things which are mighty.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; I thank God for the weak things.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; I thank God. God, we are we are those
[1:10:03] despised one. those weak things that God
[1:10:06] has chosen to confound the world. How
[1:10:09] come you are not bound to the pressure
[1:10:11] of Leicia? Oh, God chose the weak things
[1:10:14] just to show how great he is. I am
[1:10:17] nothing but God chose me.
[1:10:20] He sought me. He the one who bought me.
[1:10:23] He's the one who has chosen me. I didn't
[1:10:24] choose him. He chose me by his grace.
[1:10:27] I'm nothing but he chose me. Amen. He
[1:10:29] selected me by his grace. God has chosen
[1:10:32] the weak things of the world to confound
[1:10:34] the things which are mighty and best
[1:10:36] things of the world and things which are
[1:10:38] despised. Has God chosen yes things
[1:10:40] which are not to bring to not things
[1:10:43] that are that no flesh should glory in
[1:10:45] his presence because he wants all the
[1:10:48] glory to him and we want all the glory
[1:10:50] to go to him. But of him are ye in
[1:10:52] Christ Jesus who of God is made up is
[1:10:55] made unto us wisdom and righteousness
[1:10:57] and sanctification and redemption. And
[1:11:00] according as it is written, he that
[1:11:02] glorify
[1:11:05] the Lord. Amen. And that's what we
[1:11:07] desire. God delights in using the
[1:11:09] humble, the simple, the overlooked to
[1:11:12] accomplish his purpose, to show his
[1:11:15] power. He took David. David was nothing.
[1:11:18] Those was just a a a a shepherd and back
[1:11:22] there even his father think about even
[1:11:24] his father neglecting him.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; But he said he called all the giant all
[1:11:29] the one the mighty one all the soldiers
[1:11:32] Samuel you are going to anoint them.
[1:11:34] Even the prophet himself look oh I saw
[1:11:37] this one. Oh no this has to be the king.
[1:11:40] He want to go and anoint him. God says
[1:11:42] on oh stop stop stop stop stop stop stop
[1:11:43] stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop
[1:11:43] stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop
[1:11:43] no stop stop stop stop stop stop stop
[1:11:44] stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop
[1:11:44] stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop
[1:11:44] stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop
[1:11:44] stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop
[1:11:44] stop stop you are just look from the
[1:11:46] what the outside I don't look at the
[1:11:48] outside I don't look how beautiful how
[1:11:50] great it is from the outside I look the
[1:11:52] inside
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; I look for the seed I leave for that
[1:11:56] place that's where I'm looking at
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; and one after the other one after all
[1:12:00] the seven say that's all you have as a
[1:12:04] as children say so
[1:12:07] oh I have one I have one
[1:12:11] Then they call the little David there
[1:12:13] completely neglect by his own father
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; is the one that God chose. He's the man
[1:12:18] after my heart.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a simple man, just a
[1:12:22] simple man.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; He took, as I mentioned, he took John
[1:12:32] the Baptist to confound the kings. Just
[1:12:36] a simple man. From the outside I don't
[1:12:38] let me tell you from the outside if John
[1:12:41] the Baptist was in Laia
[1:12:44] even us will be struggling. I'm telling
[1:12:47] you we will be struggling with John the
[1:12:49] Baptist the way he is. Thank God brother
[1:12:52] Banam didn't go in the wood
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; because even his wife would have left
[1:12:58] him.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; God said no no no you are higher order.
[1:13:02] Maybe God were thinking of us. You know,
[1:13:05] no, no, you have to stay, put a dress,
[1:13:08] put a tie, people see you because if you
[1:13:10] go like John the Baptist or Elisha, no,
[1:13:13] they'll be struggling.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:13:21] It took William Branham, a a man just of
[1:13:24] seventh grade, to confound the mighty
[1:13:27] with a ministry to call out the bride
[1:13:29] from all denominations. I will say,
[1:13:32] "Praise be to God." Amen.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 8:12 the Bible says, "Now
[1:13:39] as touching things offered unto idols,
[1:13:41] we know that we have we we we all have
[1:13:44] knowledge. Knowledge puff puff puffs up,
[1:13:48] but charity edifileth. If any man think
[1:13:51] that he knoweth anything, he knoweth
[1:13:54] nothing yet as he ought to know." Amen.
[1:13:57] Amen.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; I believe this is a powerful reminder of
[1:13:59] humility especially in matters of
[1:14:01] knowledge especially spiritual
[1:14:03] understanding. It teaches us that our
[1:14:07] knowledge is still limited compared to
[1:14:09] God's wisdom and we must remain
[1:14:11] teachable and humble.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Never lose that teachable attitude.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; I come to learn. Amen. Sometime you feel
[1:14:21] like you don't learn anything. say
[1:14:23] something you don't you feel like you
[1:14:25] don't learn anything but there will come
[1:14:26] a situation where what you just heard
[1:14:29] you think you know it was just in your
[1:14:31] mind oh I need that I need that quick
[1:14:34] word I need that because God God is
[1:14:36] infinite you can't limit God amen
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 11:3 but I fear less by
[1:14:44] any means as the serpent begal Eve
[1:14:47] through his subtility that your minds
[1:14:50] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[1:14:52] that is in Christ and this is a danger
[1:14:56] then we think that the because the
[1:14:58] opening of the word is the word is open
[1:15:01] then things has to be complicated and
[1:15:04] say oh wow that's was really wonderful
[1:15:07] what did you what did you learn uh you
[1:15:10] need to ask the preacher it was just
[1:15:12] wonderful it was so good
[1:15:15] no things have to be simple
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; simple because the sheep are simple
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen Man, I like the ministry in our
[1:15:23] church. Our our brother uh uh brother
[1:15:27] Victor and brother Gilbert take things
[1:15:29] they make it so simple. Oh, you found in
[1:15:33] him. Who's him? Oh, that thing. Yeah, I
[1:15:36] always remember brother G. But that
[1:15:37] thing, what's that thing? Taking out the
[1:15:39] scriptures. Oh, I never saw that. Oh,
[1:15:42] that's so simple. Oh, just so simple.
[1:15:45] Amen.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Thank God for that.
[1:15:54] I don't want to lose you but let's be
[1:15:57] like children when it comes to faith
[1:15:59] otherwise the more we understand things
[1:16:01] the more we are prone to reason but let
[1:16:04] be at simple Paul want the believers not
[1:16:07] to be led away from the simple pure
[1:16:10] uncomplicated truth of the gospel not
[1:16:12] relying on human wisdom or additions or
[1:16:15] distortion but it has to be simple faith
[1:16:17] is simple Abraham It was told to him,
[1:16:20] Abraham, you shall have a son. You shall
[1:16:22] have a son. Abram could not explain it.
[1:16:26] Could not understand it physically or
[1:16:28] scientifically. Could not explain to a
[1:16:30] doctor how it's going to be. Abraham
[1:16:33] only had to believe what God said. Amen.
[1:16:36] And the same for us. We just have to
[1:16:38] believe. No matter the circumstances, no
[1:16:41] matter the situation, no matter the
[1:16:42] symptoms, no matter even our own life,
[1:16:45] our weaknesses,
[1:16:47] we just need to believe. Amen.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; It's faith. Believers believes. Amen. We
[1:16:52] just need to believe. Prophet continues
[1:16:54] the statue of the perfect man. He says,
[1:16:56] "Knowledge not wordly. It reasons." The
[1:16:58] kind of worldly knowledge reasons, but
[1:17:01] faith has no reasoning. God reveals to
[1:17:03] you a certain thing and a certain thing
[1:17:05] is going to happen. Every scientist in
[1:17:07] the world could tell you it's contrary.
[1:17:10] It could not happen. You still believe
[1:17:12] it anyhow. Yes, sir. It doesn't reason.
[1:17:14] The Bible said we cast down reasons. Now
[1:17:18] the scripture read cast down all
[1:17:19] reasons. You don't reason with faith.
[1:17:21] Faith has no reasoning. Faith knows
[1:17:24] where it's at. Faith acts. Faith holds
[1:17:27] on. It can't move. Nothing can move it.
[1:17:30] I don't care. Whatever says this, that
[1:17:32] or the other. It doesn't move a bit. It
[1:17:34] stays right there. Wait, wait, wait,
[1:17:36] wait. Don't make any different. Faith
[1:17:39] stays right there. Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; I thank God. We need to have more faith.
[1:17:44] Amen. God give us more revelation and
[1:17:47] revelation with simplicity of heart.
[1:17:49] Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Let every let God be true and every man
[1:17:54] be a liar for God cannot lie according
[1:17:58] to the word of God can God can never
[1:18:00] lie.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; It sounds simple but it is it very hard
[1:18:05] in life because many times when things
[1:18:08] get hard we go against the word of God.
[1:18:11] In other words, it's like we are
[1:18:12] implying to God, no God, what you are
[1:18:14] saying is not true. It's what I'm
[1:18:17] thinking to do is is true. That's quite
[1:18:20] a big statement. And by the way, we live
[1:18:22] sometimes. Amen. Because it has to be
[1:18:24] this way. It has this is the order of
[1:18:26] God. No, I think my way is the the best
[1:18:28] way. No. Then you are implying that God
[1:18:31] is wrong. But God can never lie. Amen.
[1:18:34] He can never lie to keep his word as
[1:18:36] well when it comes to promises. Amen. He
[1:18:38] can never lie. Amen. It might take time
[1:18:40] but God will fulfill his word.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Time is feeling upon me. The
[1:18:45] supreme knowledge is the knowledge that
[1:18:47] discerns right from wrong. from this one
[1:18:50] I think is one of the most important
[1:18:52] quality of the believer is to have
[1:18:54] spiritual discernment to to understand
[1:18:57] or the believer has to be able to judge
[1:19:00] what the right from wrong according to
[1:19:02] God's words not according to traditions
[1:19:05] or opinions but he has to be able to
[1:19:08] have a discernment one of the thing we
[1:19:10] should ask more God give me discernment
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; because discernment is very important
[1:19:15] for the believer
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; to know when it's the right time to know
[1:19:20] when it's the right thing to do. Amen.
[1:19:22] Sometimes to make the right decision it
[1:19:25] we need discernment. Amen. The prophet
[1:19:27] continues the statue of a perfect man
[1:19:29] still on the on the knowledge says to
[1:19:31] judge right to judge right. Judge
[1:19:33] whether it's right or wrong to believe
[1:19:35] God's word. Judge whether it's right or
[1:19:37] wrong. Whether I should serve a creed or
[1:19:39] serve God. Judge whether it's right or
[1:19:42] wrong I should be born again or join a
[1:19:44] church. Then you are beginning. Judge
[1:19:47] right. When the preacher says the days
[1:19:49] of miracle is passed, but the Bible says
[1:19:51] Jesus is Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:19:53] today, and forever. Now, which one are
[1:19:56] you going to believe?
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going to believe the Bible. Amen.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to believe the word of God.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; A mature believer discerns not just by
[1:20:04] appearance, but he judges and discerns
[1:20:07] by the word of God.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Spiritual knowledge teaches us to
[1:20:11] recognize what aligns with God's will.
[1:20:14] Amen. As in Hebrews 5:14 says, "But
[1:20:17] strong meat belongth to them that are
[1:20:20] full of age," means mature people. Amen.
[1:20:22] "And even those who by reason of use
[1:20:25] have their senses exercise to discern
[1:20:29] both good and evil."
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; You have revelation. You have a faith.
[1:20:35] You believe in God. But as you are
[1:20:37] becoming mature, you have to be able to
[1:20:39] exercise that super sense to be able to
[1:20:42] discern both good and evil. Amen.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you have to be able to discern
[1:20:49] the spirit behind things.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Someone can do something very good but
[1:20:54] you have to discern the spirit behind
[1:20:56] it.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet can you imagine the
[1:20:58] prophet in the congre I I won't have
[1:21:00] that courage but the prophet in the
[1:21:02] congregation someone want to speak in
[1:21:04] tongue
[1:21:06] and first meeting prophet let it go
[1:21:08] second meeting let it go after that no
[1:21:10] no no no it's only when I'm about to
[1:21:13] call the the altar then the person start
[1:21:15] speaking tong
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; it's a good thing it's a discernment
[1:21:20] it's a unveiling of the will of God I
[1:21:22] guess but says no now I discern that the
[1:21:25] wrong spirit
[1:21:27] good thing but wrong spirit
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; then you rebuked it
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; that takes discernment
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; and we can have someone who's doing
[1:21:37] something I would say wrong maybe making
[1:21:40] mistakes
[1:21:42] but he has a good spirit
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; he does know better
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; he's just trying
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; and then if you are mature you should
[1:21:50] encourage him
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; even though he's making mistake you
[1:21:53] still encourage him
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; as we do to our children sometimes make
[1:21:56] mistake but you still encourage because
[1:21:57] you you you know the intention behind
[1:22:00] it. It's not that the simple error a
[1:22:02] simple mistake this is serve the Lord
[1:22:04] you'll go to hell. No you you see the
[1:22:07] spirit behind it and you encourage it.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Look at that scripture. Beautiful
[1:22:19] scripture. Psalm 911. For he shall give
[1:22:22] his angels charge over thee to keep thee
[1:22:25] in all thy ways. That's a wonderful
[1:22:28] scripture.
[1:22:29] They shall bear the angels shall bear
[1:22:32] thee up in their hands lest I dash thy
[1:22:35] foot against a stone. Oh, if every
[1:22:38] morning someone could read to me that
[1:22:39] scripture said, "Oh, that wonderful
[1:22:42] scripture.
[1:22:43] The devil used it against Jesus Christ."
[1:22:45] Amen.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Says, "If thy be the son of God, cast
[1:22:49] thyself down. For it is written, it
[1:22:52] shall be, he shall give the angel charge
[1:22:54] concerning thee, and their hands they
[1:22:56] shall bear thee up, lest at any time
[1:22:59] that should dash thy foot against the
[1:23:00] stone." Matthew 4:6. He's quoting
[1:23:03] exactly the scripture. But Jesus Christ
[1:23:05] having the knowledge of God, the right
[1:23:08] discernment says, "Oh yeah, it is also
[1:23:11] written. It is also written, thou shalt
[1:23:14] not tempt the Lord thy God.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; That's a mature Christian
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; to know if sometimes when something is
[1:23:22] being quoted, but if it's not caught it
[1:23:24] with the right spirit,
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; you discern the spirit behind it says
[1:23:29] no. Oh, hold on. It is also written.
[1:23:33] I'll say there are many things in the
[1:23:35] word of God. It is about written. It is
[1:23:38] also written.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Is written is also written. Written is
[1:23:42] also written. written is also many
[1:23:44] things many situations many situation in
[1:23:47] brother Bham they ask him a question he
[1:23:48] answer to this one the next time he
[1:23:50] comes answer question he answer a little
[1:23:52] bit different from that
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; now as a mature Christian yourself not
[1:23:59] even others yourself lord what is the
[1:24:02] spirit leading me
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; because sometimes you can cling just one
[1:24:06] script one but because you want to
[1:24:08] justify your own life oh no it is also
[1:24:12] written.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; The knowledge of God is to have the
[1:24:18] balance in everything.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; God give us balance in every situation.
[1:24:23] Every give us the the right motive, the
[1:24:26] right objective and the right balance,
[1:24:28] the right spirit, the right attitude.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Then we'll always end up right.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Prophet says early spiritual
[1:24:40] experiences. Another message
[1:24:42] it says Isaiah said there will be a
[1:24:44] highway and a way is a conjunction a way
[1:24:47] it won't be called the highway of
[1:24:49] holiness. How many remember brother
[1:24:51] Gideon's message on the balance he used
[1:24:53] this one of these quotes
[1:24:56] says right in the middle of the road on
[1:24:58] the side of there is some people when
[1:25:00] they get born again they set right in
[1:25:02] the middle of the road eyes on Christ
[1:25:04] that's where we should be finally they
[1:25:06] get over here if you go on the other
[1:25:08] side so much knowledge and wisdom till
[1:25:11] they know it all
[1:25:14] prophet says you don't know nothing
[1:25:18] if you don't do that you run off the
[1:25:21] other side to a bunch of wildfire and
[1:25:24] fanatism. So one side here it has to be
[1:25:28] does that it has to be only if you want
[1:25:31] if you are preaching to me you have to
[1:25:33] read only brother or brother only the
[1:25:36] tape play because that word has to be
[1:25:39] extractly if you are preaching read me
[1:25:42] only what the prophet says okay yeah
[1:25:45] that's extremely and the other one here
[1:25:49] doesn't check whether it's a prophet
[1:25:51] whether someone just take from Luther
[1:25:53] and everything they're preaching to them
[1:25:55] and they're just happy and everything.
[1:25:56] No, take in the middle.
[1:26:01] You know the prophet the prophet Paul
[1:26:03] was being corrected by people were
[1:26:05] checking in the new test in the Old
[1:26:07] Testament what Paul is preaching. So
[1:26:09] preaching the Christian at beria they're
[1:26:11] preaching what what Paul is but they're
[1:26:13] comparing to what the Bible says. What
[1:26:15] did the Bible says what the Old
[1:26:16] Testament says? But if you read all the
[1:26:19] letters of Paul was it completely
[1:26:21] repeating word by word what the what the
[1:26:23] Old Testament says? No, it was a
[1:26:25] revelation. Amen.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; So the preaching it's not one sent each
[1:26:30] sentence has come but it's a revelation
[1:26:32] clarification making things simple.
[1:26:35] Breaking the bread for the people as
[1:26:37] Jesus Christ give the bread to the
[1:26:39] disciples. The disciples break it down
[1:26:41] to the level where people can take it.
[1:26:44] Amen. A prophet is still a prophet. He
[1:26:46] has a language that is prophetic. We can
[1:26:49] say one sentence but people have to
[1:26:51] break it down so that we understand
[1:26:53] better. Amen.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. But right in the middle of
[1:26:59] the way goes a true sound and
[1:27:02] adulterated gospel and power of God.
[1:27:04] That's right. Right down through there
[1:27:06] there where you can take it to kings and
[1:27:08] monarchs where anybody can stand and
[1:27:10] search and they can see that it's the
[1:27:12] power of the almighty God. Not a
[1:27:14] fanaticism, not a formality, not a fin,
[1:27:17] not a formality, but it's the power of
[1:27:19] God. That's what we desire. The power of
[1:27:22] God. So that no glory will go to any
[1:27:24] man. It's God himself being in control
[1:27:27] of every situations. Very important to
[1:27:30] have balance in the scripture. If you're
[1:27:32] not careful, we will stay on one side.
[1:27:35] If you're not careful, we will go on the
[1:27:36] other side. Like I said earlier,
[1:27:38] remember in many cases there is always a
[1:27:41] it is also written for the situations.
[1:27:44] Children obey your parents. You can go
[1:27:47] on that. But it is also written fathers
[1:27:50] do not provoke your children.
[1:27:52] Wives submit to your husband. It is a
[1:27:55] head. Yes. But it's also written husband
[1:27:58] love your wives.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; So always take those two then you have a
[1:28:02] middle. Amen.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; The Bible say judge not that you be not
[1:28:05] judged. But it's also written judge not
[1:28:08] according to their appearance. Amen.
[1:28:10] There's a portion where you have to put
[1:28:12] things clear. So this is wrong things.
[1:28:14] Don't do that. If you continue that way
[1:28:15] it will bring you to hell. Amen.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; So people you're judging me. Why you
[1:28:19] judging? No. The Bible says you have to
[1:28:21] correct. Amen.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Says, "Oh, I'm saved by grace and
[1:28:26] every form thing is by grace through
[1:28:28] faith." Yes. The Bible also says that
[1:28:30] shall show thy faith by works. Amen.
[1:28:33] Always a balance in every situation.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Now when you have two things I will be
[1:28:40] closing soon. I've not even started but
[1:28:43] give me 15 minute 20 minute.
[1:28:47] The teaching teaching you should not go
[1:28:49] too long but give me 15 minutes 20
[1:28:51] minutes. Is it okay?
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Prophet says you say wait I don't know
[1:28:58] now whether the scripture is just right.
[1:29:00] Now in Acts 2:38 where Peter said then
[1:29:04] Peter said unto them repent and be
[1:29:06] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:29:08] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:29:10] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:29:12] Holy Ghost. Remember it says be baptized
[1:29:16] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:29:18] remission of sins. And I don't know how
[1:29:20] to go about it when in Matthew 20 19
[1:29:24] Jesus himself said go ye therefore and
[1:29:26] teach all nations baptizing them in the
[1:29:29] name of the father of the son and of the
[1:29:32] holy ghost. You say I don't. All right I
[1:29:35] don't I don't I don't understand says
[1:29:38] then don't add that to nothing because
[1:29:40] you don't get it. What are you going to
[1:29:43] do? Because you haven't got knowledge
[1:29:45] enough to know of God yet that the Bible
[1:29:48] doesn't contradict itself. Leave it
[1:29:51] alone. Don't say no more about it. Just
[1:29:54] leave it alone. I think it's a good
[1:29:56] advice. Sometimes you you are not called
[1:29:59] to understand everything at once.
[1:30:01] Sometimes you can read something and you
[1:30:02] don't understand. You don't oh say don't
[1:30:05] don't try to say something negative.
[1:30:08] Just leave it alone
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; and continue. God help me to understand
[1:30:12] this. But the key to that don't never
[1:30:15] say the Bible contradict itself.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; You don't understand. But the Bible
[1:30:19] doesn't contradict itself.
[1:30:22] Amen. But when you can see himself but
[1:30:25] when you can see that the scripture is
[1:30:27] not contradictory then you can say that
[1:30:30] that that you can say that and can see
[1:30:32] that by revelation of God the whole
[1:30:34] world is written in mysteries and only
[1:30:37] the knowledge of God can reveal it. Then
[1:30:40] when you get it and say punctuate every
[1:30:42] word of God with an amen then add that
[1:30:45] to your favor. We don't understand
[1:30:47] everything at once. Brother Wam didn't
[1:30:49] understand everything at once. Sometimes
[1:30:52] one he was wondering himself about Mark
[1:30:54] 11:28 says how can a man say to a
[1:30:58] mountain move. He was wondering I didn't
[1:31:00] preach that for a long time himself. I
[1:31:03] didn't preach that for because I
[1:31:04] couldn't understand how a man not God
[1:31:06] but a man could pronounce and a mountain
[1:31:09] could move until one day God revealed
[1:31:11] that to him. So now I get it. Amen.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Sometime we have to be gracious to
[1:31:17] oursel no
[1:31:20] or if I don't understand then maybe I'm
[1:31:22] a foolish virgin. No
[1:31:25] just pray. He will give himself an
[1:31:27] advice. You don't understand, leave it
[1:31:29] alone. But you know that it's the truth.
[1:31:32] You don't understand, leave it alone.
[1:31:34] Why brother bam speaks like this here
[1:31:37] and doesn't that place? I don't
[1:31:39] understand. Leave it alone.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Continue your walk with God in
[1:31:43] simplicity because if we had to
[1:31:46] understand everything at once, then we
[1:31:48] will be putting that on ourselves. He
[1:31:50] not understand himself. How can this man
[1:31:52] be one is right? He can he can speaks in
[1:31:55] tongue the other one interpret but one
[1:31:57] is right the other one is a is a
[1:31:59] hypocrite how could I he couldn't
[1:32:01] understand he could not explain it
[1:32:03] himself a prophet but it took some time
[1:32:06] and god one time revealed to him the
[1:32:08] rain can fall on the just and the
[1:32:10] unjust.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; So it can be anointing on the flesh on
[1:32:14] someone who's clean and someone who's a
[1:32:16] hypocrite in the church. So that can
[1:32:19] happen and God revealed that to him. Oh,
[1:32:21] now I see him. But the Bible doesn't
[1:32:24] contradict itself.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; What's the secret? Now I believe in
[1:32:29] genuine Holy Ghost knowledge. Holy Ghost
[1:32:32] knowledge will always punctuate the word
[1:32:34] with a amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; When you get these things that seem to
[1:32:38] contradict themselves in the Bible, you
[1:32:41] sit down and you study it prayerfully
[1:32:45] like that. And I think that's the key.
[1:32:48] You have to sit down and study it and
[1:32:50] prayer in prayer. Maybe sometimes we
[1:32:54] don't pray enough.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; That's maybe a correction, maybe a
[1:32:58] rebuke here, but bear with me. Sometimes
[1:33:00] maybe we don't pray enough. We want to
[1:33:02] argue enough
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; but we don't pray enough.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; We want to find things. Maybe what do
[1:33:08] you want to say? What do you want to
[1:33:10] say? But God reveal that to me
[1:33:12] personally.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to study. I want to check
[1:33:15] here. I want to check. We we the word of
[1:33:17] God is full of of treasure inside of it.
[1:33:21] But do we study it properly? Do we or we
[1:33:24] just put it on our ears and a background
[1:33:26] noise? Oh God help us. Sometimes we have
[1:33:28] to take time to study the word of God.
[1:33:31] I'm on the knowledge.
[1:33:34] You cannot become mature mature without
[1:33:38] studying the word of God.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying listening the word of
[1:33:43] God. studying the word of God.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; I remember our early believers, our
[1:33:50] parents, Caleb's parent and they were
[1:33:53] taking the word of God.
[1:33:56] And I still like that because I learned
[1:33:58] from them. They read it, they analyze
[1:34:01] it. They're not preachers, but they
[1:34:03] analyze it. They will ask questions.
[1:34:05] They will go and search. That those are
[1:34:07] early believers, strong believers. But
[1:34:11] now it is
[1:34:13] shame on us maybe younger one we have oh
[1:34:17] just background noise or the preacher
[1:34:20] will handle that and maybe we are not as
[1:34:24] solid as they were
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; listen brother many sermons you will say
[1:34:32] I'm not trying to put that on dump just
[1:34:35] something to think about to meditate
[1:34:37] upon
[1:34:38] you will be preaching and preaching
[1:34:40] Those who have not I'm repeating this
[1:34:42] verse. So for those who write it down,
[1:34:46] right?
[1:34:48] But how maybe we don't write down
[1:34:51] anymore, right? It's just recording.
[1:34:54] Yeah. But do we listen to it really?
[1:34:58] I'm just putting questions here.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Maybe you are skipping that step of
[1:35:03] knowledge there
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; just to rely on other things. But if we
[1:35:08] become solid,
[1:35:11] I think we need to know our Bible.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; We need to study our Bible.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Some people don't even read the Bible.
[1:35:19] They only read the messages.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; But you can't become a strong believer
[1:35:25] if you don't read the Bible.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; You have to read the Bible. You know
[1:35:29] what the message comes from and gives
[1:35:32] you an anchor. So I know that's the
[1:35:35] truth. Amen.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; You will see you make yourself I give
[1:35:41] you make yourself a challenge. You take
[1:35:43] every a time to read the Bible to read
[1:35:47] the message reading really concentrate.
[1:35:49] You give yourself 20 minutes you can
[1:35:51] start 10 minutes 15 minutes whatever
[1:35:53] time you have but you do that regularly
[1:35:56] you'll see how your spiritual life will
[1:35:58] increase will grow. would be a preacher
[1:36:02] just preaching something here, but what
[1:36:04] you studied just un unveils itself in a
[1:36:08] greater way. Oh, I read that. Oh, yeah.
[1:36:11] It becomes a higher dimension
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; than just what the preacher says. One
[1:36:16] word from the preacher, but because of
[1:36:17] your studying, that word just multiplies
[1:36:20] itself.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we challenge ourselves a
[1:36:23] little bit that God let me give you a
[1:36:25] little bit just a little more time to
[1:36:27] meditate upon the word of God?
[1:36:32] Because if you meditate,
[1:36:36] if you meditate upon the word of God,
[1:36:38] you will see that there is no other
[1:36:39] baptism in the Bible outside of the
[1:36:42] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:36:44] Christ. So what you are struggling with
[1:36:47] is why Jesus said here and Peter seems
[1:36:49] to say something else here. Actually the
[1:36:52] Bible confirm there is no disciple who
[1:36:54] ever got baptized in other name but in
[1:36:56] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So
[1:36:59] Peter had to give the revelation of what
[1:37:02] Jesus Christ says. He said the name of
[1:37:03] the father of the son of the holy ghost
[1:37:06] is the name of the lord Jesus Christ.
[1:37:10] That's the name that represent the name
[1:37:12] of the father. So the father is the lord
[1:37:14] Jesus Christ. The son is the lord jesus
[1:37:16] Christ. The holy spirit is is in his
[1:37:19] nature but the name of the holy spirit
[1:37:21] is the lord jesus Christ.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; True. If you meditate prayerfully, you
[1:37:26] will see that Adam and Eve did not eat
[1:37:28] an apple as the original seed. But the
[1:37:32] Eve committed an act that produced Cain
[1:37:35] from whom the Bible says he was the evil
[1:37:37] one.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; If you meditate prayerfully, you see
[1:37:40] that the holiness for believers is
[1:37:41] required. And I shared that with the
[1:37:44] young people one time. Even people who
[1:37:46] are not from the message if they
[1:37:49] dedicate if they pray and dedicate
[1:37:51] themselves multiple times and you see
[1:37:53] that in simplicity they will start
[1:37:55] dressing decently and modestly
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; without hearing brother
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; just themselves dedicating themselves
[1:38:03] you will see that they will start
[1:38:04] dressing properly
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; it's just a fact
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; how much more those who can hear what
[1:38:10] the prophet says
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; and you still don't do it may God help
[1:38:14] us Amen.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; If you want angel to visit you, think on
[1:38:19] God. Each time you meditate on the word
[1:38:22] of God, the angel of God are coming
[1:38:24] there to visit you. The prophet said,
[1:38:27] "If you want angel to appear to you,
[1:38:29] keep your mind on God." Jehovah, Jehovah
[1:38:32] of miracles and of the things of the
[1:38:34] world. Keep your mind off the things of
[1:38:35] the world. Go about your business. Go to
[1:38:38] your church, go to your washing of
[1:38:39] dishes, wherever you are, keep but keep
[1:38:41] your mind on him all day and all night
[1:38:43] long. Then God will do something. You
[1:38:46] are drawing close to God. Mary had a
[1:38:49] visitation and she was thinking of God.
[1:38:52] Amen. Angels being associated together.
[1:38:55] I hope the prophet I hope you get that
[1:38:57] and just dropping right now. If you've
[1:38:59] got the Holy Spirit in you, then you are
[1:39:01] candidate for association with the
[1:39:03] unseen world and the supernatural. The
[1:39:06] angels of God visits you, speaks with
[1:39:09] them and they are messengers sent from
[1:39:10] God to reveal and to bring messages from
[1:39:12] God to the individual. So if you want to
[1:39:15] have visitation of God, meditate upon
[1:39:17] the word of God. You want visitation in
[1:39:20] your house, meditate upon the word of
[1:39:22] God. I believe before I say that let me
[1:39:25] say prophet read a prophet quote to me
[1:39:28] the prophecy he's talking to someone
[1:39:30] says you know brother banham you are
[1:39:32] just say what do you do to what did you
[1:39:34] do to to hypnotize the people and
[1:39:37] something like that in that angle it
[1:39:38] says quote to me 1911 act 1911 which
[1:39:44] says god brought special miracles by the
[1:39:46] hands of Paul knowledge say he trapped
[1:39:48] his self right into it actually he was
[1:39:50] saying you know why do you send those
[1:39:52] handkerchie chief, what do you do on
[1:39:53] them? What do you put is it is not
[1:39:55] scripture. So a prophet is asking quote
[1:39:57] me Acts 19:11 he says then quote me John
[1:40:01] 5:14 which says afterward Jesus findeth
[1:40:03] in him in the temple and said unto him
[1:40:05] behold thou made whole sin no more
[1:40:08] unless a worse thing come unto thee
[1:40:10] couldn't do it and then it says then
[1:40:12] then James 5:14 if any seek among you
[1:40:16] let him go for the elers of the church
[1:40:18] and let them pray over him anoint him
[1:40:20] anoint him with the oil in the name of
[1:40:23] the Lord he couldn't do it he couldn't
[1:40:25] call that then I said, "Do you know John
[1:40:27] 3:16? For God so loved the world that he
[1:40:30] gave his only begotten son that
[1:40:32] whosoever believe on him should not
[1:40:33] perish but have everlasting life." They
[1:40:36] say, "See, smart knowledge, smart
[1:40:39] world."
[1:40:41] So let me put down that my command. The
[1:40:43] prophet was expecting him to know those
[1:40:45] scriptures.
[1:40:48] The prophet was expecting him to know
[1:40:50] those scriptures. We have to know our
[1:40:53] Bible.
[1:40:54] Brother Andrew, put me put me there. Put
[1:40:57] another if you don't mind. We have to
[1:40:58] know our Bible. I someone sent me long
[1:41:02] time ago, long time this this video and
[1:41:04] it kind of I think I took it to
[1:41:06] encourage my children with that.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; But it's someone.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Are you a Christian? Is ask are you a
[1:41:13] Christian?
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Christian.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Christian.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Christian.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Christian.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Sorry. They're going to be an image that
[1:41:19] is not proper for the church. Forgive
[1:41:21] that. What?
[1:41:23] I'm neither.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know, bro.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; So, he's asking, "Can you just give me
[1:41:32] two scriptures of the Bible?"
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; You don't know.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Are you?
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; I don't remember.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; No. No. Two verses.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, no.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Hard question.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Um
[1:41:57] Are you Christian or Muslim?
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; I'm Muslim.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Muslim.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Muslim.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Two verses from the Quran.
[1:42:28] Wow. That is shame for believers. That's
[1:42:30] shame for Christians.
[1:42:33] Christians just by name, but you don't
[1:42:35] know nothing from the Bible. Not even
[1:42:37] two verses.
[1:42:41] For me, that hurts me. Like, no. We we
[1:42:44] are we are doing a poor job.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; We are doing a poor job. We need to we
[1:42:49] need to start working on our children.
[1:42:50] We need that's why that's why in in in
[1:42:54] the Sunday school they have to memorize
[1:42:55] some verses.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; It's important for them to memorize some
[1:42:58] verses. When you come to church bring
[1:43:00] your Bible when you read it stays with
[1:43:03] you. this screen sometimes it keeps
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; okay it's like when we use didn't have
[1:43:09] those screens we used to know the songs
[1:43:11] by heart
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; when the sister sing the song I'm not
[1:43:14] done to put myself ahead of that sorry
[1:43:16] for that I just put the example the
[1:43:18] French songs I usually know them by
[1:43:20] heart because we didn't have any
[1:43:22] presenter everything was just by heart
[1:43:25] but the English words oh I don't know
[1:43:27] none of them I have to strike because
[1:43:29] this p for me I'm not survive because
[1:43:32] that that screen just takes everything
[1:43:34] and okay
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; cuz I rely on it. But we have to have
[1:43:38] knowledge of things. Oh God, are we
[1:43:41] skipping that too much and go to my God
[1:43:43] help us to help us to know and memorize
[1:43:48] because the Holy Spirit comes to remind
[1:43:50] us about the scriptures. Amen.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; But we have to read it so that reminds
[1:43:55] you.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; If you don't read it, you don't know it.
[1:43:58] What can it remind you about? Because
[1:44:00] you don't read it. You don't know it.
[1:44:02] But when you read it by the God's grace
[1:44:05] then it reminds you. So you know for
[1:44:06] that situation this is what you read the
[1:44:08] other day. This is what the situation
[1:44:10] you're going through. Oh thank god for
[1:44:11] that. Oh praise be to God. That's the
[1:44:14] knowledge. So it's a knowledge that you
[1:44:16] had to do a part human part but there is
[1:44:18] a spirit part that comes and take
[1:44:20] control. Amen. That that that the
[1:44:22] knowledge of God himself has to do that
[1:44:25] make that life inside of you. But
[1:44:27] there's a part where you can do as well
[1:44:28] a part. Amen. Does it make clear?
[1:44:42] Many times we go along with a saying
[1:44:45] that is not part of the word of God many
[1:44:47] times and I've been victim of that
[1:44:50] through the years. I just heard that
[1:44:51] preacher say and becomes a saying and it
[1:44:54] goes and sometimes becomes like a
[1:44:56] doctrine. That's right. And then one day
[1:44:58] you come to let's look at brother B.
[1:45:00] What did brother Bham said it we never
[1:45:02] found it. It's like oh how come all
[1:45:06] these years I've been repeating that
[1:45:07] it's not brother Bam
[1:45:10] maybe in the French we have been victim
[1:45:11] of that more and more. I've been
[1:45:13] listening to a a very good preacher and
[1:45:15] I still rely I still love him but
[1:45:17] through years and when I read it in the
[1:45:20] English version said wow it doesn't mean
[1:45:23] that how come we have been all our lives
[1:45:26] I've been I've been through that it has
[1:45:29] become just a saying
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; but it's not the word of God
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; that's true
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; but let help us to check on each other a
[1:45:35] little bit you know you say that where
[1:45:37] is it where did brab say that where do
[1:45:39] you think then we will see that we'll
[1:45:41] become a little more serious than
[1:45:44] amen. Amen.
[1:45:48] That was the same thing that happened in
[1:45:50] time of John the revelator Jesus Christ
[1:45:53] some of you might not die and what if I
[1:45:56] say that what if he should not die it
[1:45:58] became a saying oh John will not die
[1:46:00] John will not die John will not die John
[1:46:02] will not die and then when he died oh
[1:46:06] I'm sure Sam also left the message
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; so no
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; how can how how can how can how can
[1:46:12] Billy Brandham die how can he but butam
[1:46:16] says but why did he Hey, then we look,
[1:46:19] we look. No, he never said that. Oh, all
[1:46:21] this year was a saying. Oh,
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Help us to have that knowledge that we
[1:46:31] check things with the word of God and
[1:46:34] have a foundation that is solid.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; That what we need. Los Angeles. Oh, now
[1:46:40] it was just a rumor, but that's all
[1:46:42] that. But we need to know the word of
[1:46:44] God. Then we'll be able to stand with
[1:46:46] the word of God. This is one of the this
[1:46:48] is my quote and and I want to I don't
[1:46:51] want to leave you that without it. Bam
[1:46:53] says in exposition of the seven church
[1:46:55] ages no true believer is any stronger
[1:46:58] and spiritually healthy and alive than
[1:47:02] his knowledge of and adurance to the
[1:47:05] pure word of God
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; as seen by multitude of examples in the
[1:47:10] old testament. So the knowledge of God
[1:47:13] is part of what makes a believer
[1:47:15] stronger. Without the knowledge of the
[1:47:17] word of God, you can't be stronger.
[1:47:19] Without adherence to the pure word of
[1:47:22] God, you can't be stronger. So the
[1:47:24] knowledge of God has to bring you to
[1:47:26] fulfill the word of God. You can't
[1:47:29] defend your right if you don't know your
[1:47:31] right.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; You don't if you you can't you can't
[1:47:35] claim you can't put the enemy out. You
[1:47:37] can't put Satan out if you don't know
[1:47:39] your right. You need to know the word of
[1:47:42] God. So you can stand upon the word of
[1:47:43] God because Jesus Christ said this in
[1:47:46] the word of God. Now I put you out
[1:47:49] because you know you're right. You know
[1:47:51] your position. Amen.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; It's like when you take a flight, I'll
[1:47:55] put you an example. Take a flight.
[1:47:57] You're going to Toronto. You take a an
[1:47:59] example for you to understand. Take a
[1:48:00] flight. you go to Toronto and then it's
[1:48:02] delayed in the middle and then they gave
[1:48:05] you gave you a free meal but you went to
[1:48:09] your email they didn't check and you're
[1:48:11] struggling during the day struggling the
[1:48:13] day you don't have money right then in
[1:48:17] the night you come you arrive to Toronto
[1:48:19] you open your email you find a free
[1:48:21] ticket there
[1:48:24] see how angry you'll be
[1:48:26] so I wasted I suffered all because I
[1:48:28] didn't know my right same with the word
[1:48:31] of God. If you don't read it, you don't
[1:48:33] know it.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; You don't know that you are free. Why
[1:48:37] the word of God has been open in this
[1:48:39] age? So that we know our right. We know
[1:48:42] where we are standing. We know our
[1:48:44] position. We know where we are staying.
[1:48:46] Amen. The word of God came to give us
[1:48:49] the intelligence, give us to give us the
[1:48:51] perfect knowledge of the word of God on
[1:48:54] where we standing. The Bible says, "My
[1:48:56] people are destroyed by lack of
[1:48:57] knowledge because they have rejected
[1:48:59] knowledge, I will also reject them."
[1:49:01] He's talking to the Israel. So knowledge
[1:49:04] is a very important part of the statue
[1:49:07] of a perfect man. But once you have
[1:49:10] knowledge, once you know who you are,
[1:49:12] you know your Bible, you know where you
[1:49:14] are standing, I can say you can claim
[1:49:16] your right. Like the Indian mother, if
[1:49:19] you open your Bibles, you will find
[1:49:21] great treasures to supply to all your
[1:49:24] needs. But you have to open your Bible.
[1:49:26] If you don't open it, you won't find
[1:49:28] that there are treasures belonging to
[1:49:30] your need. You have to open your Bible.
[1:49:32] But before closing, just to go on the
[1:49:34] other side, the knowledge is not a
[1:49:36] knowledge only to know about him. But
[1:49:39] you have to know him.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; To know him is life. Amen.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; So it's not to know only to know about
[1:49:46] Christ which is important. But the other
[1:49:48] step is to know the person of Christ.
[1:49:52] We need to come to know the person of
[1:49:54] Christ in the power of the resurrection.
[1:49:56] Without knowing Christ in the power of
[1:49:58] the resurrection, there won't be
[1:50:00] resurrection for you. The resurrection
[1:50:02] for any person who doesn't come to know
[1:50:04] Christ in the power of the resurrection
[1:50:07] to be born again to accept the word of
[1:50:09] God to obey the word of God then you'll
[1:50:12] be part of the resurrection. Musicians
[1:50:14] can come. Amen.
[1:50:16] Thank you for your patience and for your
[1:50:19] understanding for the service this
[1:50:20] morning. little bit teaching but I think
[1:50:22] it was important for God to prick our
[1:50:25] heart a little bit. God help us to give
[1:50:28] you time so that we learn more about
[1:50:30] you.
[1:50:32] Thank you.
