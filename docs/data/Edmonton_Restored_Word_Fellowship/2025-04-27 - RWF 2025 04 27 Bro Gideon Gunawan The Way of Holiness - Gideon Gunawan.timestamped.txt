[13:36] There was a a prayer request from Sister
[13:39] Claudia and it's for
[13:42] a sister named Esparanza Ramos and she
[13:45] met uh Sister Anita and then somehow she
[13:49] met Sister Claudia, my mother-in-law,
[13:50] and they they both testified to her and
[13:53] I think she's she's looking in her heart
[13:56] she's looking for the Lord. So, it says
[13:59] she's she needs prayer. She's in
[14:02] back home for uh some medical things and
[14:08] then she's looking to come back here and
[14:09] possibly come here. So, the Lord knows
[14:12] and the Lord knows how to get a hold of
[14:13] somebody and help with the right people
[14:15] in the path.
[14:16] Maybe I can ask brother Zigg if he can
[14:18] come up and open a word of prayer and
[14:20] we'll just keep it.
[14:24] The brother that's traveling and his
[14:26] family
[14:29] that's way and then
[14:32] [Music]

[28:36] Christ. Once again I have a few
[28:38] announcement here and just want to make
[28:41] it out out of the way and then we let
[28:44] the word of God come. So we had a
[28:46] wonderful youth meeting

[28:59] listening to the tape of brother Banham
[29:01] so the tape message and we just gather
[29:04] around that and we share what what the
[29:06] message was saying. Oh, I can tell you
[29:09] it's wonderful to hear the young people
[29:12] telling you what the prophet said. And I
[29:15] say, "Oh, this is what the prophet
[29:16] said." And touched my heart and it
[29:19] really uh spoke to me. I was like, "Oh,
[29:23] Lord." Um, oh, that's so wonderful to
[29:25] see that God can still speak even to the
[29:28] young people and the message is still
[29:30] alive. The message is not only for the
[29:33] older one. The message speaks even to
[29:35] the younger one. So it was an
[29:37] encouragement to me and may God continue

[32:13] that's what we are and he's an
[32:14] encouragement and we we love him and we
[32:17] appreciate him and he has been a
[32:18] blessing for this church and helping
[32:21] this church for many years and we I know
[32:23] the church loves him and loves his
[32:25] ministry. So we will be blessed this
[32:28] morning as the Lord will be using him.
[32:30] God bless him richly. I have one song
[32:32] that standing on God's promises,
[32:34] standing on the promises of God.

[36:30] [Applause]
[36:33] How many standing on the promises of God
[36:34] this morning?
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Friends, I was just reading. Friends,
[36:37] there's one there's only one thing that
[36:39] God Amen can fail to do and that's break
[36:42] his promise. Amen. So, Amen. It's a good
[36:44] place to stand on his promises of his
[36:46] word this morning. Amen. And it's good
[36:48] to be here you with you with you this
[36:50] morning and um just to see brother Moses
[36:55] and thank you for the invitation brother
[36:57] Zigg and to see just the the transition
[37:00] but also just the support and the love.
[37:03] Amen. And we want to thank the Lord for
[37:04] that. Amen. And give God all the praise.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Did you come expecting this morning?
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, praise be to God. Amen.
[37:11] Because you get what you expect.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's let's just pray
[37:15] and ask God's blessing as we just
[37:17] approach the word. Father,
[37:20] Lord, we love you this morning. We thank
[37:23] you for your grace, your mercy, your
[37:26] love, your care,
[37:29] Lord, and how you brought us here this
[37:31] morning, Lord. Father, Lord, a
[37:33] predestinated time and place, Lord,
[37:35] where you could meet us, Lord. And as
[37:38] Lord, Brother Zigg prayed or mentioned
[37:39] or Lord stated this morning, Father,
[37:42] Lord, that Father, you commanded us,
[37:44] Lord, to forsake not the assembling of
[37:46] ourselves together. And Lord, it's a joy
[37:49] to be here this morning, Father. Lord,
[37:51] it gives us joy to come and to feel your
[37:54] presence Lord and to be amongst
[37:56] believers Lord and to Lord and to
[37:59] fellowship Lord around the word and to
[38:01] fulfill your word Lord and and to Lord
[38:04] fulfill that Lord where the carcass is
[38:06] Lord there the eagles are gathered
[38:08] together and where Lord I believe I'm
[38:09] amongst eagles this morning Lord and
[38:12] we're gathered Lord around the unfailing
[38:13] body word of the son of man Lord we're
[38:15] not gathered Lord around some man's idea
[38:18] Lord or some dead carcass Lord Lord, of
[38:21] a word of a past day, but Lord, we're
[38:23] here, Lord, to feed on the on the
[38:25] unfailing body word of the son of man,
[38:28] Lord Jesus. And you're here to confirm
[38:30] your word, Lord, and confirm your
[38:32] promises, oh God, that where two or
[38:34] three are gathered in your name, Lord,
[38:36] there you will be, Lord. And we believe
[38:38] that you're here, Lord. Come, Lord, and
[38:41] speak to us, Lord. Come and make love to
[38:43] us this morning, Lord Jesus. Lord, we go
[38:45] past the living room, Lord. We go past
[38:47] the kitchen, Lord. Lord, bring us into
[38:50] that bedroom this morning, Lord, where
[38:52] you can give life, Lord. And Father, and
[38:55] have fellowship, Lord, and communion,
[38:57] Lord, and intimacy with us, Lord, we
[38:59] pray. Bless this congregation, Father.
[39:01] Bless, Lord, Brother Moses, Brother
[39:03] Zigg, the elders, Lord, each and
[39:05] everyone, oh God. Lord, for your glory,
[39:08] Lord, that we might, Lord, do your will,
[39:10] Lord, and be pleasing to you, Father.
[39:12] Have your way this morning. We ask in
[39:13] the name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:17] Praise the name of the Lord. if you turn
[39:18] with me in your Bibles, let's just get
[39:20] right to the word.
[39:23] And I would just ask for your prayer
[39:24] this morning because um you know, I'm
[39:27] trying to combine two services into one.
[39:29] So um you just pray that I just say what
[39:33] I need to say or not need to say, but
[39:35] what the Lord wants me to say and shut
[39:37] my mouth to what he doesn't want me to
[39:38] say this morning. Amen. Will you pray
[39:40] for me?
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah 35.
[39:44] If you turn in your Bibles, um Isaiah
[39:46] 35, we'll read verse 8 through10.
[39:51] I want to speak to you this morning on
[39:52] the way of holiness.
[39:55] The way of holiness.
[39:57] And I just want you to not think that
[40:01] you know exactly where I'm going.
[40:04] Amen. But just amen. Have your hearts
[40:06] open and just and pull on the word and
[40:08] and and we'll the Lord will just bless
[40:10] us this morning. You believe that?
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 8, the Bible says, "A
[40:14] highway shall there be shall be there
[40:17] rather and a way, and it shall be called
[40:20] the way of holiness. The unclean shall
[40:23] not pass over it, but it shall be for
[40:25] those the wayfairing men, though fool
[40:28] shall not heir therein." Verse nine,
[40:30] though no line shall be there, nor any
[40:32] ravenous beast shall go on go up
[40:35] thereon, it shall not be found there,
[40:37] but the redeemed shall walk there.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Verse 10. And the ransomed of the Lord
[40:43] shall return and come to Zion with songs
[40:47] and everlasting joy upon their heads,
[40:50] and they shall obtain joy and gladness,
[40:53] and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a sure word of prophecy.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[41:04] Amen. Brother Brandham would take this
[41:06] exact text of Isaiah 35 and read these
[41:09] verses and take a message called God
[41:13] God's Way that's been made for us. And
[41:16] he'd start off by saying, you know, if
[41:18] you were wanting to go to a place and he
[41:20] would say New York, but it could be any
[41:22] place, Calgary or Florida or Europe or
[41:25] wherever. Well, let let's just use, you
[41:27] know, Calgary or to Vancouver. Amen. The
[41:30] first thing you do is get yourself a
[41:32] map. Amen.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Now, many of you maybe traveled the road
[41:34] to Vancouver or you know the way but
[41:37] Amen. say you didn't know where you were
[41:38] going rather and you and you needed to
[41:40] get somewhere. Amen. You'd get yourself
[41:43] a map. Amen. Now nowadays it's a little
[41:46] different, right? Our map is our phone.
[41:47] Just get up Google Maps and punch it in.
[41:49] But you know, I thought I brought this
[41:51] here this morning. Anybody seen any of
[41:53] these?
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I see some nods. Yeah. Now, this
[41:56] has been in my car for probably the last
[41:58] 15, 20 years. Amen. We used to get out
[42:02] and get I was in Vancouver and you know
[42:03] just oh man I need to get to this
[42:05] address and you'd get it out and my wife
[42:07] would okay now where do we need to go
[42:08] and oh you need to turn left and oh my
[42:11] it was just a it was a chore wasn't it
[42:13] amen and it was a chore just even to get
[42:15] this back into the glove compartment
[42:18] and and so thank God that we have an
[42:20] easier way now but you know we when we
[42:22] want to get to a place you need to know
[42:24] where you're at
[42:25] &gt;&gt; you know where you need to where you're
[42:26] starting to get where you're going you
[42:28] need to have a direction and God, amen,
[42:31] has a way.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I like what brother Brandham
[42:36] says next here. And and he would say in
[42:37] God's way that's been made for us. He
[42:39] says, "Now there's no shortcuts in God's
[42:41] kingdom."
[42:42] You know, we try to make a shortcut. We
[42:45] get out here in a pond somewhere and
[42:46] mire down. And that's what we do when we
[42:48] get off the grand old highway of God.
[42:51] For God made a path a way. And it and he
[42:56] doesn't have shortcuts, friends. You
[42:57] know, I I was thinking about, you know,
[42:59] and as I was pre- preaching this the the
[43:01] first time is that if you've read the
[43:02] book Pilgrim's Progress or maybe you've
[43:04] seen the film or whatever, and when
[43:06] Pilgrim tried to take a shortcut,
[43:09] right, he got on to I I believe it was
[43:11] called the bypath Meadow. And oh, it
[43:13] seemed good and it seemed like a better
[43:15] way until he met Giant Despair.
[43:19] You see? Amen. There's no shortcuts,
[43:21] friends, in God's way. Amen. There's
[43:23] God's way and God's way. And God's way
[43:25] often seems strange. You know, you think
[43:27] of the children of Israel when God took
[43:29] them out of Egypt there. Amen. It He
[43:31] seemed like a poor navigator to take
[43:33] them right to the Red Sea. Is that
[43:35] correct? Amen. It seemed But that was
[43:38] God's way. God's way was through the Red
[43:41] Sea.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; But it seemed like how is this God's
[43:44] way? Here we are, the my mountain on
[43:46] each side of us and the Red Sea before
[43:48] us and Pharaoh's army right behind us.
[43:50] What's going on? And they begin to cry
[43:51] out to God. But God said, "Amen. That's
[43:54] the way I want you to go. Now, be still
[43:55] and know that I am God. You see, Amen.
[43:58] We need to trust in his way. And I like
[44:01] what he said here, and I've loved this
[44:02] this this next quote where Brother
[44:04] Brandon would say, he says, "Now God has
[44:06] a way, a provided way." And and watch
[44:09] this. There's two ways a man can go. How
[44:12] many have read this quote? Amen. And
[44:14] that's his way or God's way.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; I feel like I'm loud. Is it all right?
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the right way or the
[44:23] wrong way. Now watch this. And your way
[44:26] is always the wrong way.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; So there's two ways we can go, friends.
[44:31] There's God's way and there's our way.
[44:34] And God's way is the right way. And your
[44:36] way, my way is the wrong way.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Well, praise God. Amen. And you can't be
[44:42] in your own way and in God's way at the
[44:45] same time.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; So what do you got to do? You got to get
[44:48] out of your own way so God can have his
[44:51] way in you. And friends, that's what I
[44:53] want to do this morning, friends. I want
[44:54] to get out of my way. Get out of my own
[44:56] mind. What I want to say this morning,
[44:58] friends, and get in his way.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; How many want him to have his way this
[45:02] morning, friends? Amen. But friends, I I
[45:04] I I say this is it's so simple. Amen.
[45:08] But it's hard for us sometimes because
[45:09] we think our way is the right way. Oh,
[45:11] we think it all the time. Well, my way
[45:13] of doing things is the right way and our
[45:14] way of of doing this and our way of
[45:16] conducting the song service and our way
[45:18] of playing this song and our way of this
[45:19] and our way of whatever. But friends,
[45:21] the only right way is God's way.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; And God's way is his word.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Well, glory be to God. Amen. Solomon
[45:29] wrote in the book of Proverbs, "There is
[45:30] a way which seemth right to man, but the
[45:33] end thereof there with are the ways of
[45:35] death." Because you know, when you look
[45:36] at Sarah thought that her way was the
[45:38] right way.
[45:40] Yes.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; You know, it seemed like every other way
[45:43] it nothing had worked.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; So, her way, well, I it must be it
[45:48] could, you know, maybe God wants the
[45:50] seed to come through Hagar. She's my
[45:52] she's my maid servant. But friends, it
[45:54] made a mess of it.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, she thought it was
[45:59] the right way, but God had a way. It was
[46:01] going to be through Sarah.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; And you might think, friends, oh, this
[46:05] way is the right way and this is the
[46:06] way. This is the way it's going to
[46:07] happen. I don't know, friends. Amen.
[46:09] Let's get in God's way.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You think of Cain.
[46:14] Amen. He thought his way of worship was
[46:16] right.
[46:18] I mean, he thought he he thought he was
[46:20] so right that even when God told him,
[46:21] "That's not the right way. This is my
[46:23] way. Just do what your brother did and
[46:25] I'll accept you." He was so convinced
[46:27] that his way was right, that he didn't
[46:30] want to change. Now, watch this. And and
[46:32] brother Brandon would say about Cain's
[46:34] religion. And I want you to catch this.
[46:35] He says, "Now there, Lord, I built an
[46:37] altar." He's speaking for Cain. I built
[46:39] a church. I'm a good church member.
[46:43] I go to church every day. I come here,
[46:46] built the altar. I put the sacrifice
[46:47] upon it. Now, I'm going to kneel down
[46:49] and pray. And Lord, I want you to
[46:51] receive me
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Cain's way.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; I go to church. I'm a good church
[46:56] member. Oh,
[46:58] &gt;&gt; I'm a good message believer. I come to
[47:00] church. I go to Restored Word.
[47:05] And now I'm kneeling at your altar and I
[47:07] want you to receive me. Did you come
[47:08] God's way?
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Guess what? God refused it. Now which
[47:12] way do you intend? Amen. To serve the
[47:15] Lord. There's many ways. There's the
[47:17] Baptist way.
[47:19] There's the Methodist way. There's the
[47:21] Pentecostal way. There's a Presbyterian
[47:22] way, the Catholic way, the message way.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; How about God's way?
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Let's look at Isaiah
[47:30] 35 if you're still there. Verse 8 says,
[47:32] "And a highway shall there be and a
[47:35] way." Now, the scripture is making a
[47:37] difference there that there's a highway
[47:40] and a way. See, and brother B would say,
[47:42] "And is a conjunction." So, there's a
[47:43] highway and a way. And if you look at
[47:47] the Greek, the highway just means a
[47:48] road. It's a highway. It's a road. But
[47:51] if you look at the way, it actually
[47:53] means it's it's a little deeper. It's
[47:54] the way, road, distance, journey,
[47:59] manner, path, direction, habit, course
[48:04] of life of moral character. So it's not
[48:06] just a road, it's a course of life. It's
[48:08] a way of life. It's a manner. It's a
[48:11] journey.
[48:13] And it shall be what? The way of
[48:16] holiness. Holiness is a partness.
[48:19] Holiness, sacredness.
[48:22] A partness to what? Aartness to who?
[48:24] Sacredness to who? To God.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; The unclean shall not pass over it. So
[48:31] friends, not just anybody can walk in
[48:33] this way.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; The unclean will not walk in this way.
[48:38] Why? It's the way of holiness. And like
[48:40] Peter would say, but as he which hath
[48:43] called you is holy, so be ye holy.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; In all manner of conversation, because
[48:48] it is written, be ye holy, for I'm holy.
[48:51] You know, you would say to yourself,
[48:53] "But I'm I don't see myself as holy. I
[48:56] make so many mistakes. I fail here and
[48:58] there." And friends, I would say, "I'm
[49:00] with you."
[49:01] &gt;&gt; I'm right there. But friends, it's not
[49:03] about your holiness.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Well, glory be to God. Friends, if we
[49:09] want to if we trust in our holiness or
[49:11] our righteousness, friends, we are going
[49:12] to be disappointed. We are going to get
[49:15] depressed.
[49:16] Amen. It's his holiness. It's his
[49:19] righteousness. He offers you a trade
[49:22] this morning. Trade in your
[49:23] righteousness, your good works, your
[49:26] holiness for his holiness. You see,
[49:28] Peter would would describe the mount
[49:30] transfiguration as the holy mount. And
[49:32] brother Brandon would go on to say that
[49:34] it was not so much the mountain that was
[49:36] holy, but it was the holy God that was
[49:38] on that mountain that made the holy that
[49:41] made that mountain holy. And friends,
[49:42] it's not the holy people, but it's the
[49:44] holy God, amen, that's living in you
[49:47] this morning that makes you holy.
[49:50] It was not the ground so much that Moses
[49:52] was on there. That was holy ground. But
[49:53] it was the holy God that was on that
[49:55] ground. And we are standing on holy
[49:58] ground this morning, friends, because
[50:00] the holy God is in our midst.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning?
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. But you would see here
[50:08] in the way of holiness. Now watch this.
[50:10] Amen. Who is it actually for? But it
[50:11] shall be for those the wayfairing men
[50:14] and women, pilgrims, sojourers. How
[50:18] many's a pilgrim this morning?
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're just passing through.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; This world is not my home.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; I'm just a passing through.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've got another home,
[50:30] friends. I come from God. I'm going back
[50:32] to God. How about you?
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Friends. Amen. They talk
[50:37] about aliens. They talk about UFOs.
[50:39] Friends, you're the alien. Amen. We
[50:42] don't belong out here. We come from
[50:43] another world.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. No lion shall be
[50:48] there, nor any ravenous beast shall go
[50:50] up there on it. Shall not be found
[50:52] there, but the redeemed.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; The redeemed.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be any ravenous or
[50:57] any roaring Satan going like a roaring
[51:00] lion. But the redeemed,
[51:03] &gt;&gt; the redeemed. I'm speaking to the
[51:05] redeemed this morning, friends. You
[51:06] shall walk on that way.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, watch here in Hebrews
[51:10] chapter 1. I mean, the the the message
[51:12] Brother Brown was preaching. In Hebrews
[51:14] chapter 1, he says they used to talk
[51:15] about the highway of holiness. Now, if
[51:17] you read over that, they get that out of
[51:19] Isaiah the 35th chapter. Now, if you
[51:21] notice, he said, "There shall be a
[51:22] highway and a way." Now, and is a
[51:25] conjunction.
[51:29] Uh it wasn't a highway of holiness.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; It shall be a highway and a way, and it
[51:35] shall be called the way of holiness, not
[51:37] the highway of holiness. the way of
[51:40] holiness and the way of the road is the
[51:43] middle of the road.
[51:46] Wow.
[51:48] That that puts a little bit of a
[51:50] different perspective on this scripture.
[51:52] He's saying now the way of any road is
[51:55] the middle of the road.
[51:58] My that's where the redeemed are going
[52:00] to walk in the middle of the road.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. The unclean are on either side.
[52:09] And I don't want to get ahead of myself,
[52:10] but you see, when a road is designed a
[52:12] certain way,
[52:13] &gt;&gt; right? It's not like this, it's not
[52:15] flat. It's it's got a curvature to it.
[52:17] Amen. That when the junk and the trash
[52:19] and the garbage gets on the road and the
[52:21] rain comes, it washes it to the side.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, there's a way of holiness.
[52:27] It's in the middle of the road. All the
[52:29] trash is on the side.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; But watch this. And now, Brother Brand
[52:34] will pick it up. It's built like this so
[52:35] that the waters will wash off the trash
[52:38] to both sides. Keeping the road clean.
[52:40] You don't you have you don't you have
[52:43] puddles standing in your road all the
[52:44] time if it isn't built right. The way he
[52:47] it's in quotes is the middle of the
[52:50] road. And brother Brandon would say,
[52:51] "Well, that ain't sensible." Amen. You
[52:53] drive in the middle of the road, you're
[52:55] liable to get in a collision and get in
[52:57] a crash. He said, "Brother, this is not
[52:59] a two-way road. It's a one-way road."
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We're going to glory.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not going that way. I'm not going
[53:08] back.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; I have decided to follow Jesus.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; No turning back.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; You You're getting a collision. You're
[53:15] going the wrong way.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; You're going back to Egypt, friends.
[53:18] We're going to glory.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, on this road, now watch
[53:23] this. He begins to This is all the same
[53:25] quote here. He begins to bring it down.
[53:27] Now he says, "Now the way of holiness is
[53:29] actually the middle of the road."
[53:33] And now he continues, "Watch this. Now
[53:35] on this side, when people get converted,
[53:37] their minds is set right on Christ. And
[53:40] if they're just a little scholarly
[53:42] scholarly
[53:44] and don't keep under prayer, they'll get
[53:47] real cold and stiff and starchy and
[53:50] indifferent." one side of the road,
[53:53] &gt;&gt; saved, converted,
[53:56] &gt;&gt; love the Lord, mind set on Christ, but
[53:59] they're real scholarly, real studious.
[54:02] Nothing wrong with that. But they're
[54:04] students of the word. These people just
[54:06] know the word inside out. They can pick
[54:09] up every syllable, every comma, every
[54:11] oh, they just study it. There's nothing
[54:13] wrong. They really know the word, and
[54:15] they'll let you know when you misquote
[54:16] it.
[54:18] But what they often miss is the spirit
[54:20] of it.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; And if they're not careful, what does he
[54:24] say? They get cold,
[54:26] &gt;&gt; stiff,
[54:27] &gt;&gt; starchy, and indifferent. That ain't
[54:30] good.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; We don't want that. But then there's the
[54:32] other side. Now then, if they're just a
[54:34] little bit nervous, if you don't watch,
[54:37] they'll just get radical and wild.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; The other side.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; So you got one side that's cold and
[54:43] stiff and starchy. They know the word.
[54:45] Amen. Then you got the other side.
[54:46] They're real nervous, but they're
[54:47] fanatical
[54:50] on this side. See, they go into
[54:51] sensations and everything. Oh my. When
[54:54] the Holy Spirit starts moving through
[54:56] the building, they're the first ones to
[54:57] cry out and oh, shout and scream.
[54:59] Nothing wrong with that. Are you with
[55:01] me?
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. A real dynamic preacher
[55:05] comes and they're just, oh, amen.
[55:06] Hallelujah. Amen. But when they get out
[55:08] of that presence,
[55:10] &gt;&gt; they don't know if they're saved or not.
[55:14] my they don't feel God for one service
[55:16] and they're wondering about their
[55:17] salvation.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Two sides of the road.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning?
[55:23] &gt;&gt; How many remember brother Brown talking
[55:25] about, you know, the two classes of
[55:26] people or two, you know, the the two
[55:28] types of people that he would encounter
[55:30] in the church, right? You know, one was
[55:32] the scholarly type, the more the Baptist
[55:33] type. My they fundamentally they know
[55:36] where they stand. They know who they
[55:37] are. They know what the word says,
[55:39] right? Amen. They can positionally place
[55:41] themselves in scripture. just go back
[55:43] and forth, Old Testament, New Testament,
[55:44] just show him through the scripture, but
[55:46] they don't have much faith,
[55:49] right? But then there's the other one.
[55:51] He's the Pentecostal.
[55:53] My He's got faith. He's got emotion. He
[55:56] She's got whatever, right? Oh, they But
[55:59] it's it's like, you know, he says, you
[56:00] know, one knows how to write the check.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, they just know how to write the
[56:04] check and claim the promises, but there
[56:06] ain't no money in the bank.
[56:10] And then the other one has all the money
[56:11] in the bank came in, but they don't know
[56:13] how to write the check. They don't know
[56:14] their PIN number. They don't know how to
[56:16] use a credit card.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; We all do.
[56:20] They made it real easy. But Amen. What
[56:22] would you rather have? You know, Brother
[56:24] Brandon would say, if you could only
[56:25] just get the two together.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Then you've got something. What do you
[56:31] have? The middle of the road, the way of
[56:33] holiness. That's what we're striving
[56:34] for, friends. I I want to know how to
[56:36] write the check.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want to I and know that I've
[56:40] got enough money in the bank to back it
[56:42] up.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Right. Hallelujah. Amen. And friends, I
[56:48] I want to know who I am, where I stand,
[56:50] and be able to rejoice about it.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Have some freedom.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We can just get so mature in the
[56:59] message. And oh, I I we get so mature,
[57:02] friends, that we say, I know I know ex I
[57:04] know exactly what direction he's going
[57:05] in.
[57:06] Oh, I heard you heard that. Tell me
[57:08] something better. Tell me something new.
[57:10] Come on, friends. Amen. Let's humble
[57:12] ourselves to the word. Amen. And stop
[57:15] thinking that we know everything. We
[57:17] don't know anything the way we ought to
[57:19] know.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Well, praise God. Cuz you know, because
[57:23] we've all got the message now. We can
[57:25] look up the quotes. We can read the
[57:26] Bible. We got it all at our fingertips.
[57:29] And we got a bunch of head knowledge.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; What we need is the life.
[57:37] I hope that's all right.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Watch this. He says, "Now, but the real
[57:41] church." How many's part of the real
[57:43] church?
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Is a real sane gospel right in the
[57:46] middle of the road. It's not cold and
[57:48] starchy.
[57:50] Neither is it fanaticism. It's a real
[57:53] good old warm gospel. Heartfelt love of
[57:56] God going right down the middle of the
[57:58] road calling from both sides.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:02] In other words, when we need to be
[58:03] quiet, we're quiet.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Write, pick up your pen and write, "The
[58:08] bride knows what to do with the word.
[58:10] Even she has thus sayith the Lord or she
[58:12] keeps silent."
[58:14] &gt;&gt; She knows when to be still and know that
[58:16] he's God.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; And she knows when to move. You see, we
[58:20] need to be willing to move when God
[58:22] moves. When when the children of Israel
[58:24] were in the wilderness and that pillar
[58:25] of fire got up and and or the pillar of
[58:27] cloud, whatever, and started moving,
[58:28] they couldn't say, "Well, we just camped
[58:30] here last week." You mean we got to pack
[58:32] up the temple and pack up our tents and
[58:34] pack up this and pack up that and go?
[58:36] Yes, we got to move. But when they
[58:39] stayed there for week after week after
[58:41] week, why aren't we moving? There's no
[58:43] food here. There's no water here.
[58:46] We But the pillar of fire is still here.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[58:50] &gt;&gt; So, amen. We need to move when he moves.
[58:52] We need to be still when he's still.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; It's being spiritled,
[58:58] calling from both sides. Friends, you
[59:00] know, I I hear these things like we
[59:01] ought to be preaching the mysteries. We
[59:03] ought to be preaching the deep things of
[59:05] God. Oh, you need to. But then there's
[59:07] then there's the other side. Just stay
[59:09] simple, brother. Just be a real good
[59:12] Christian. Both are right. Yeah,
[59:18] &gt;&gt; this is the reason why sometimes we get
[59:20] uncomfortable because we fall on either
[59:21] side naturally
[59:23] &gt;&gt; because of our makeup.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; But it we call from both sides.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Lord Jesus this morning.
[59:35] You know what I find friends? The one
[59:36] who's real deep and myster and knows the
[59:39] mysterious things of God often they
[59:41] can't get along with anybody.
[59:45] They're so arrogant. Nobody wants to be
[59:46] around them.
[59:48] [Laughter]
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Whoa. Thank you, Lord. Oh, they're so
[59:54] deep, but their family's messed up.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; They're so heavenly minded norly good.
[1:00:01] But then there's the other side. Oh,
[1:00:03] good, clean Christians live good, clean
[1:00:06] lives, but they're satisfied.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; They're satisfied. Don't want to go no
[1:00:12] deeper, don't want to get further into
[1:00:14] the word.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; If you could get the two together,
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; then you'd have something.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; You want to know, friends, what really
[1:00:25] shows who has a real revelation when it
[1:00:27] translates into their life,
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; into their conduct, into their
[1:00:32] conversation, how they treat their wife,
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; how they treat their kids, how they
[1:00:36] treat the pastor,
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; how they treat their brother from the
[1:00:39] other church.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:44] it. Friends, it's about living the word.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Not just about talking about it,
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; oh yeah. Oh, I got this quote. I I Let
[1:00:53] me show you.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; We've heard it many times, friends. The
[1:00:57] word, the message was not given to argue
[1:00:59] over or to debate. It was given to live,
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; to manifest.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; I hope this is all right.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh friends,
[1:01:10] many people can explain and that that's
[1:01:12] why I believe Paul would write to the
[1:01:13] Corinthians, though I could have all
[1:01:15] faith. Oh, understand all mysteries. Oh,
[1:01:18] have faith and I could move mountains.
[1:01:21] If you don't have love,
[1:01:23] I'm talking about charity. Agape love,
[1:01:26] you're nothing. It's just like tinkling
[1:01:28] on and that's it. Oh, give us charity.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Real revelation, friends. Do you realize
[1:01:35] that the the scripture says charity
[1:01:38] vaunteth not itself
[1:01:40] and is not puffed up? Hallelujah. Real
[1:01:43] revelation. You realize friends when we
[1:01:45] get to that maturity in our experience.
[1:01:47] Amen. When we're like a wheat plant,
[1:01:49] friends, and it just get that corn of
[1:01:51] wheat is just getting really ripe and
[1:01:52] tender and mature, it starts to bow its
[1:01:55] head.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; So when someone claims, "Oh, I got this
[1:02:00] revelation. I just know this and I can
[1:02:02] explain this." And they're just all
[1:02:03] puffed up.
[1:02:05] Well,
[1:02:07] maybe.
[1:02:08] But friends, a real revelation friends,
[1:02:10] they that that that revelation will just
[1:02:13] go so deep and you just help because
[1:02:14] what we realize, friends, is that I
[1:02:16] never gave myself that revelation.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; I'm only here by the grace of God.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; You're here only by the grace of God.
[1:02:23] Friends, there are so many people around
[1:02:24] here, other churches around there,
[1:02:26] friends. If not for the grace of God,
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; we would not be here.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Turn with
[1:02:36] me to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5. We'll
[1:02:38] go into here a couple examples.
[1:02:44] 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 16 says,
[1:02:48] "Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing.
[1:02:52] In everything give thanks, for this is
[1:02:54] the will of God in Christ Jesus
[1:02:55] concerning you. Quench not the spirit.
[1:02:58] Despise not prophesyings.
[1:03:01] Prove all things. Hold fast that which
[1:03:04] is good. Now, I think it's so beautiful
[1:03:06] how Paul writes this. Watch this. In
[1:03:09] verse 20, he says, "Despise, not
[1:03:11] prophesyings."
[1:03:13] In other words, don't don't brush off
[1:03:15] the gifts.
[1:03:17] Don't dismiss them. Don't criticize
[1:03:19] them. Right? Don't pass it off as
[1:03:21] fanaticism. But then the next verse,
[1:03:24] prove all things.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; I love this. The middle of the road,
[1:03:28] don't don't prophesyings, tongues,
[1:03:31] interpretations. Don't despise that.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Still in the body,
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; still in the church.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; But on the other side, prove all things.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Let's look at this, friends. Don't just
[1:03:44] accept everything blindly.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Prove it.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Test it out.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; How? By the word.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Let's look at experiences here just for
[1:03:52] a moment. And and and bring it to our
[1:03:54] thought of the way of holiness. Because
[1:03:56] there's a middle of the road even with
[1:03:57] experiences. And I I say this because if
[1:04:00] we'll be honest, friends, we put a lot
[1:04:02] of weight on experiences.
[1:04:04] We put a lot of credibility on
[1:04:06] experiences.
[1:04:09] Now, let me say this before I go on
[1:04:11] here. I believe in experiences.
[1:04:15] I believe in experience. And friends,
[1:04:18] Amen. I believe in the experience.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Right? The prophet of God would say the
[1:04:22] new birth is an experience. Each and
[1:04:24] every one of you must have that
[1:04:26] experience that personal experience with
[1:04:28] God himself. So I believe in experiences
[1:04:31] friends and and and but let's look at
[1:04:33] this you know let's look at even the
[1:04:35] first prophet messenger. Amen. Paul when
[1:04:38] he would on the road to Damascus now
[1:04:40] Paul was a student of the word and but
[1:04:42] he was off right he was persecuting the
[1:04:45] body. He was persecuting Jesus who was
[1:04:47] in the body. Amen. And there he goes to
[1:04:50] Damascus to arrest and to put in jail
[1:04:52] all these heretics in his mind. And God
[1:04:54] meets him on the road to Damascus in a
[1:04:56] pillar of fire, right? A great light
[1:04:58] surrounds him, strikes him off that
[1:05:00] horse. Amen. He says, "Oh Lord, Lord,
[1:05:02] who are you?" He says, "I am Jesus whom
[1:05:06] thou persecutest." It's hard for you to
[1:05:07] kick against the pricks. Right? And then
[1:05:09] he says, "Lord, what must I do?" Now
[1:05:12] watch this. Amen. He a a a a a a a a a a
[1:05:14] a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:05:16] just amazing experience.
[1:05:20] I don't know if any of have you've had
[1:05:21] that kind of experience, but I I haven't
[1:05:24] where where I met the pillar of fire.
[1:05:25] I've met the pillar of fire, just not
[1:05:27] visibly maybe. Amen. But watch this. But
[1:05:31] look at Paul. He did not go immediately
[1:05:33] to the apostles. Amen. And go, "Oh, let
[1:05:36] me tell you what happened to me. I'm at
[1:05:39] the pillar of fire. Jesus came and
[1:05:41] visited me. Now you got to listen to me.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Look at how spiritual I am. No,
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; that's not what he did.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What did he do? Neither went
[1:05:52] I to Jerusalem to them which were
[1:05:54] apostle before me, but I went into
[1:05:56] Arabia and returned again to Damascus.
[1:05:59] Then after three years,
[1:06:02] I went up to Jerusalem. So three years
[1:06:06] Paul, Amen, searches the scriptures.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; What was he doing friends? He was
[1:06:11] matching. He was trying to test prove
[1:06:14] his experience.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; It would do us good if we did that.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; He he he took the he to he went through
[1:06:23] the scriptures. He went through the Old
[1:06:24] Testament and and proved his experience
[1:06:27] out by the word. And I can imagine as he
[1:06:30] read about the account of the children
[1:06:32] of Israel and the pillar of fire leading
[1:06:34] the children of Israel, the pillar of
[1:06:36] fire meeting Moses in the burning bush,
[1:06:38] the pillar of fire, amen, that met
[1:06:40] Abraham. All these things he began to
[1:06:42] realize it meant that my experience
[1:06:44] matches
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; the word.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Who I met
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; was God.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; It was not Amen. He he compared it to
[1:06:55] the word. And brother Brown would say
[1:06:56] now Paul he just loved the word. So
[1:06:58] before he would ever witness this great
[1:07:01] experience that he had he went down in
[1:07:04] Egypt for three years. I believe it was
[1:07:05] three years. Three years down in Egypt.
[1:07:06] We know it was Arabia. Amen. And you
[1:07:08] know what I believe he done? I believe
[1:07:10] he took the Old Testament and searched
[1:07:13] through the Old Testament and found that
[1:07:15] that was really the absolute Messiah. He
[1:07:18] had to prove his experience by the
[1:07:21] Bible.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; And he did.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; He did. Amen. Notice Paul in his road
[1:07:27] down as soon as this great experience
[1:07:28] happened to him. Now, he wasn't
[1:07:30] satisfied. That's what makes Paul so
[1:07:32] good. Now, my friends, some of us would
[1:07:35] just, oh my, oh, we just had this great
[1:07:38] experience. I'm just going to tell the
[1:07:40] world
[1:07:41] and oh and and and that proves what what
[1:07:44] I'm saying is right. That's usually how
[1:07:47] people use experiences to vindicate
[1:07:49] themselves. God uses it to vindicate his
[1:07:52] word.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; It's not to vindicate the individual,
[1:07:55] friends. Amen. I believe in
[1:07:56] vindications, friends, but it but ought
[1:07:58] to match the word.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; It has to dovetail with the word.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; And before he would do this, Paul was a
[1:08:05] Bible scholar. Now listen, and a Bible
[1:08:07] scholar will never rest his doctrine
[1:08:11] upon experiences.
[1:08:13] I think this is so profound because
[1:08:15] people will say, "I seen a light. I've
[1:08:17] seen a vision. I had a dream." Oh, I'm
[1:08:20] not minimizing that. I'm not
[1:08:22] discrediting that one bit. But here, the
[1:08:25] prophet says, "You can never rest your
[1:08:26] doctrine on an experience.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; It's got to be in the word."
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. A Bible scholar will never rest
[1:08:37] his doctrine upon experiences. No sir,
[1:08:39] they'll never rest their doctrine upon
[1:08:41] experience. You can have any kind of an
[1:08:43] experience, but it must be thus sayaeth
[1:08:46] the Lord. Right? And what's thus sayeth
[1:08:48] the Lord? It's nothing but the word of
[1:08:50] God.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; You've got to find it in here. You see,
[1:08:53] when Martin, right, when the when when
[1:08:56] the church age messenger Martin Satan
[1:08:58] came to him
[1:09:01] disguised as Jesus,
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; right? And we know that the Bible says
[1:09:06] that Satan can transform himself into an
[1:09:09] angel of light.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; He can even disguise himself as a
[1:09:15] message preacher.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; That's why you need to prove what I'm
[1:09:18] actually preaching to you this morning
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; by the word.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. But he Martin. So Satan comes to
[1:09:26] Martin as Jesus and he says, "Martin,
[1:09:29] don't you recognize me?
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Worship me.
[1:09:35] But Martin, right? What an experience.
[1:09:38] Jesus. Oh, can you imagine? It's G Jesus
[1:09:42] would visit me that I could actually see
[1:09:45] him. Oh, and if you're not careful,
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; see, but Martin, there was something
[1:09:49] that see the Holy Ghost cannot be
[1:09:51] fooled.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; That's the thing, friends. The Holy
[1:09:54] Ghost, Amen, could not and there was
[1:09:56] something a little bit uncertain there.
[1:09:58] And Martin began to I I can imagine he
[1:10:00] began to search the scriptures. Amen.
[1:10:03] But there, Satan was Amen. disguised as
[1:10:05] Jesus wearing a crown,
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; right? Golden slippers.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Wow. Could start a new doctrine on that.
[1:10:13] Amen. But he had a crown. Golden
[1:10:15] slippers. And Martin began to realize
[1:10:17] that Christ was not crowned yet.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; He'd only be crowned by his people at
[1:10:22] his coming. And there's no scripture for
[1:10:24] golden slippers.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; So he realized, friends, Amen. He he
[1:10:28] realized who that was. And he said,
[1:10:29] "Satan, get behind me."
[1:10:32] See, he took his experience back to the
[1:10:34] word.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my. It's a lesson for us, friends.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:40] Friends, you know, when when brother
[1:10:42] Brandon was on the scene, you know,
[1:10:43] there was all sorts of manifestations
[1:10:44] and all sorts of, you know, experiences
[1:10:47] and oh, blood coming out of people's
[1:10:49] hands, mine, oil, and all, you know, he
[1:10:52] said that that's there's no scripture
[1:10:53] for blood coming out of the hands. What
[1:10:55] about the blood of Jesus?
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe in anointing with oil,
[1:11:01] right? But oil come and it wasn't it
[1:11:03] wasn't scriptural. But watch this. He
[1:11:05] says, "Look at him when he was in
[1:11:06] prison." He's speaking about Paul again.
[1:11:08] You notice there's a space of Paul's
[1:11:10] life when he was in prison there for a
[1:11:11] long time. He wrote the book of
[1:11:12] Ephesians. He wrote this Hebrew letter.
[1:11:14] See, he had time. God laid him away over
[1:11:16] there in a prison. And he wrote these
[1:11:17] letters to the churches.
[1:11:21] One to the church of Ephesus. He wrote
[1:11:22] one to the Pentecostal church. Had lots
[1:11:25] of trouble with them.
[1:11:28] Amen. How many you know which church
[1:11:29] that was? That was the Corinthian
[1:11:32] church, right? Why? Because what was
[1:11:34] going on? Every some everyone had a
[1:11:35] psalm. Everyone had a had had a
[1:11:38] revelation. Everyone had this. Everyone
[1:11:40] had that, an interpretation. But you
[1:11:42] know what? Who was getting edified? The
[1:11:44] individual,
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; right? I got this and I got that. And
[1:11:48] and and I just Oh, I hope you I just
[1:11:51] hope you hear what the Holy Spirit's
[1:11:52] saying. It's not that I'm against these
[1:11:54] things.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a middle of the road.
[1:11:58] Amen. The Pentecostal church he had more
[1:12:01] trouble with than anybody else. Still
[1:12:02] has it. But he was thankful for them.
[1:12:04] The only thing he could teach them when
[1:12:05] they come in, one had a tongue, one had
[1:12:07] a psalm, one had a sensation, one had a
[1:12:09] feeling. He couldn't talk or speak to
[1:12:11] them eternal security. He couldn't speak
[1:12:13] to them about predestination. He
[1:12:14] couldn't talk to them. They were babies.
[1:12:16] They all had to feel something
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; or see something or have funny feelings
[1:12:22] or something around some evidences.
[1:12:25] There's nothing wrong with those.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; And and and I I'll be the first one to
[1:12:32] tell I love feeling the presence of God.
[1:12:34] I love to feel his anointing.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Don't you?
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Let me say this, friends. If I never
[1:12:40] felt him again, I'd still believe his
[1:12:42] word is true. You got to come to that
[1:12:45] place, friends, cuz friends, there's
[1:12:46] going to come a time where you will not
[1:12:48] feel him.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Like brother Brandon would say, he's I
[1:12:51] feel like an orphan. He hasn't spoken to
[1:12:53] me. If you talk to him, would you tell
[1:12:55] him that I love him still? Something
[1:12:56] like that. You see, did it doesn't make
[1:12:58] him any less of a son of God. It doesn't
[1:13:01] make you any less of a child of child of
[1:13:02] God if you haven't felt him.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; His word His word says I'll never leave
[1:13:08] you nor for his word says I'll be with
[1:13:11] you even in you to them. That's his
[1:13:13] word. That's his promise. Standing on
[1:13:15] the promises of God.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; How many standing on the promises of
[1:13:19] God, friends? And it don't matter what
[1:13:21] you feel. It don't matter what your
[1:13:23] senses are telling you this morning.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Your memory, your conscience, your
[1:13:27] affection, your feelings, your sight.
[1:13:30] You realize, friends, that when the two
[1:13:32] went to the Emmas, they were they were
[1:13:34] talking to Jesus. They were seeing
[1:13:36] Jesus, but they couldn't see him. You
[1:13:39] see, their their senses, their earthly
[1:13:40] senses were connecting with Jesus, but
[1:13:43] they couldn't see him. But once their
[1:13:45] spiritual eyes were open, friends, the
[1:13:48] physical departed, vanished. But they
[1:13:51] went back to Jerusalem rejoicing
[1:13:53] nonetheless. But if we just depended on
[1:13:55] our feelings, he's gone. He's gone
[1:13:58] again. He abandoned us again. No, they
[1:14:01] said, "He's risen. He is risen."
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; It was real to them. Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; We cannot depend upon our senses,
[1:14:08] friends. These senses will will lie to
[1:14:11] us.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; We need to look to the unseen.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Let's not be babies and depend on
[1:14:20] feelings and sensations. And again, I
[1:14:22] love to feel them. I love to feel them,
[1:14:24] friends. Amen. But let us not depend on
[1:14:27] that. It shows immaturity.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; You see, I give this example. You know,
[1:14:33] when our children were growing up, when
[1:14:36] your children were young, you have to
[1:14:38] tell them, "I love you. I love you.
[1:14:41] You're my son. You're my daughter.
[1:14:43] You're pretty. You're the best. I'm
[1:14:46] proud of you. I love you. I love you. I
[1:14:48] love you." Right? But there has to come
[1:14:51] a time, friends, when they come to a
[1:14:53] place in their life, amen, when they're
[1:14:55] at school or whatever, and someone says,
[1:14:56] "You ain't worth nothing." That they can
[1:14:58] say, "It doesn't matter what you said.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; I know. I know myself. I'm loved.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; I have value.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they know who they are.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; And that's what happens in our life,
[1:15:11] friends. It don't matter what any demon
[1:15:13] says. You see, if someone talked you
[1:15:15] into this, if someone just persuaded you
[1:15:17] that you're a son of God, but it's not
[1:15:19] really real to you. Someone will
[1:15:22] persuade you out of it. The devil. You
[1:15:24] say, "Look at this mistake. Look at
[1:15:25] this. Look at what you did here. And
[1:15:27] look at what you did there. Look what
[1:15:28] you But friends, if we can look past
[1:15:30] that, it's not what the devil says, not
[1:15:31] what my flesh says. It's what the word
[1:15:33] says.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's what I'm standing on this
[1:15:37] morning. What an appropriate song.
[1:15:38] That's what I'm standing on this morning
[1:15:40] is his word, his promise.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; It is yay and amen.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:15:49] Hallelujah. Friends, it's the same thing
[1:15:50] spiritually. Amen. I don't have to see a
[1:15:52] vision to prove that I'm a son of God.
[1:15:55] Is this okay? I don't have to raise the
[1:15:58] dead to say I'm a minister. I'm called
[1:15:59] of God.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; I am who I am by the grace of God.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:16:06] Hallelujah. But let me say this. These
[1:16:08] signs shall follow them that believe. I
[1:16:12] don't have to manufacture it, friends.
[1:16:13] They'll just follow. When I look back, I
[1:16:15] see God worked here. He worked there. He
[1:16:17] answered this prayer. He answered that
[1:16:19] prayer. He did this in my life. He did
[1:16:21] this in my family.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't have to manufacture
[1:16:26] nothing, friends, or try to vindicate
[1:16:28] ourselves.
[1:16:29] God will vindicate. And I I we Shar and
[1:16:32] I were talking a little bit about this
[1:16:33] here yesterday. You know what, friends?
[1:16:35] The greatest vindication, we can say
[1:16:37] anything. Anybody can say it. I'm bride.
[1:16:40] I'm bride. I'm this. I'm that. The
[1:16:42] greatest vindication will be on rapture
[1:16:43] day.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; So you make sure that you know yourself.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what we say, friends.
[1:16:52] What does God say? And he will say on
[1:16:54] rapture day, you're mine. I'm rapturing
[1:16:57] you. I'm changing your body.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he gave us the down
[1:17:01] payment.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Our healing. You're mom. Hallelujah.
[1:17:04] Johnny Huckluck. Our healing. Amen. He
[1:17:06] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:11] But I believe when he spoke to the
[1:17:12] Ephesians, I'm just continuing on this.
[1:17:14] He could speak on God has predestinated
[1:17:15] us unto sons and daughters and adopted
[1:17:17] us as children in Christ Jesus before
[1:17:20] the foundation of the world. Look at
[1:17:21] that. I watch him come over in the book
[1:17:23] of Romans and so forth. They were grown
[1:17:25] up. So he's making kind of a comparison
[1:17:27] here. He could speak to the Romans about
[1:17:29] deeper things about predestination. If
[1:17:31] he the Ephesus church about these things
[1:17:33] they were grown up. So oh then we might
[1:17:35] assume oh then they were just mature
[1:17:38] quiet. No they have the gifts too.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; They sure did. Oh they spoke with
[1:17:45] tongues. Sure. And they had other signs
[1:17:47] of the Holy Spirit among them. But they
[1:17:48] didn't make doctrines and sensations and
[1:17:51] little quivers and funny feelings. Paul
[1:17:53] said, "You go to extremes with that."
[1:17:57] Amen. When you ought to be teaching your
[1:17:58] still babies and have to have milk. Now,
[1:18:00] that's what I've always tried to contend
[1:18:01] this tabernacle to be. Not a bunch of
[1:18:03] babies. Let's be grown up,
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; friends. We've been in this message for
[1:18:07] enough years. We ought to be grown up.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; We ought to have some maturity about us.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. Is that right?
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, they speak with tongue. Sure.
[1:18:17] And they had other signs of the spirit.
[1:18:18] Amen. Watch this. Stand on the road. Oh
[1:18:21] my. There you are. So Paul goes down
[1:18:22] there first to see if his experience
[1:18:25] matched God's Bible. Oh, wouldn't it be
[1:18:27] wonderful today if people only done that
[1:18:29] again? If we made our experience match
[1:18:32] God's Bible, if it doesn't, then your
[1:18:34] experience is wrong.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; But it was so spiritual. It was It
[1:18:40] seemed so genuine. If it doesn't match
[1:18:43] with the word, it's wrong.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:47] If it don't flash in the ur thumb.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; We don't have a physical breastplate
[1:18:53] now, but we got one.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's If it doesn't flash across
[1:18:56] this, friends, it's wrong.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Know you got it. But if it
[1:19:01] doesn't, I don't care how good it seems,
[1:19:04] how real it looked like it was right. If
[1:19:07] those lights didn't flash on that urine
[1:19:09] thumb, it was wrong. And no matter how
[1:19:11] much experience you've had, how real it
[1:19:13] seems to be, how presenting it is, how
[1:19:16] educational is, what a great tool it is
[1:19:18] to win souls, if it doesn't flash in the
[1:19:20] word, it's wrong.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Right? It must line up with the word.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Friends, you know, when they they I
[1:19:35] don't know if they do it anymore, but in
[1:19:36] courts they used to do, right? When you
[1:19:39] come for testimony, place your hand on
[1:19:41] the Bible
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; and and pledge, make a solemn oath. I
[1:19:45] promise to tell the truth, the only
[1:19:48] truth. Nothing but the truth. Let me say
[1:19:50] it this way. The word. Nothing but the
[1:19:53] word.
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; The whole word.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; The word. The whole word and nothing but
[1:19:59] the word. That's what we go by, friends.
[1:20:02] Not the word plus what I think or the
[1:20:04] word minus this part that I don't really
[1:20:06] like cuz it doesn't match up with my
[1:20:08] life or my my way of thinking or my
[1:20:10] understanding. No, it's the word, the
[1:20:12] whole word and nothing but the word. No
[1:20:14] man's ideas, no denominational feelings
[1:20:17] and all these things, friends.
[1:20:19] Hallelujah.
[1:20:21] Brother Brown tells this story around
[1:20:24] this this this thought here of
[1:20:26] experiences because you know he met this
[1:20:28] minister that come from overseas I
[1:20:29] believe and and he'd come to this
[1:20:31] meeting but he had driven a long ways
[1:20:32] from another place in America I believe
[1:20:34] but he he traveled by himself with
[1:20:36] another woman who wasn't his wife.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Okay. Right. And this woman and and on
[1:20:41] top of that she had been married four or
[1:20:42] five times. Right. And brother Brando of
[1:20:44] course it it just wasn't a good
[1:20:46] testimony. So he got that minister apart
[1:20:48] and he said, "Brother, don't you think
[1:20:50] it's, you know, not right to be doing
[1:20:52] what you're doing? You you you should be
[1:20:54] a better example than that." And that
[1:20:56] minister says, "Oh, but she's a saint."
[1:21:00] What does that matter, right? If she's a
[1:21:02] saint or ain't. Amen. The Bible says,
[1:21:05] "Amen. Shun the appearance of evil."
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, he said, he said, "You
[1:21:10] don't teach your church that, do you?"
[1:21:12] He said, "Oh, no, but you know, I had a
[1:21:14] vision, Brother Brandham." Oh. Oh, then
[1:21:16] it's all right.
[1:21:19] Watch this. He said, "You, you know, cuz
[1:21:22] it didn't it didn't really impress
[1:21:23] Brother Brown."
[1:21:26] And the minister said, "You know,
[1:21:27] actually, if you have a little bit of
[1:21:28] time, I'd like to straighten you up on
[1:21:29] your doctrine a little bit." He said,
[1:21:30] "Please do."
[1:21:32] He said, "Now, when I had this vision, I
[1:21:34] was sleeping." And brother Brown right
[1:21:36] away, he said, "There I knew was a
[1:21:38] dream."
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Because you don't have a vision when
[1:21:41] you're sleeping,
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; right? You have when you're sleep, you
[1:21:44] have a dream when you're sleeping. when
[1:21:45] you're awake and you see that that's a
[1:21:47] vision,
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:49] And and let me just slow down here. How
[1:21:52] many know Amen and I'm not against
[1:21:53] dreams. God uses dreams. He used dreams.
[1:21:56] He came to Jacob in a dream. He So
[1:21:58] Joseph dreams. He he does dreams. Amen.
[1:22:00] The Bible says uh your young men
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; shall see visions. Your old man shall
[1:22:05] dream dreams like that. Right? So I
[1:22:07] believe in dreams, but you realize
[1:22:08] brother Brand would even say it's a
[1:22:10] secondary way,
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; right? Unless there's a prophet or an
[1:22:14] interpreter to interpret the dream. You
[1:22:16] see, Joseph had dreams. Pharaoh had
[1:22:19] dreams. But Joseph was also a prophet.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; He could interpret the dreams, right?
[1:22:25] Amen. So there, if it's if there's no
[1:22:27] interpreter,
[1:22:28] it might be right, it might be wrong.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how spiritual it is. I
[1:22:33] shared this with the church back home.
[1:22:35] You know, as a kid, I had a dream.
[1:22:38] There was a couple in the church. They
[1:22:39] separated.
[1:22:41] I'm not saying any names, but as a kid,
[1:22:43] I don't I don't even remember how old I
[1:22:45] was. I had a dream that they were back
[1:22:46] together again. And I told my dad, you
[1:22:49] know what he said? He said, "Well, wait
[1:22:50] and see." It was wise.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; To this day, they're still not together.
[1:22:54] So, it was a dream.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; It was a nice dream, but it was just a
[1:22:58] dream.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; See, we need to test our experiences by
[1:23:03] the word.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay. Amen.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; So what did that minister? Let's go back
[1:23:11] to see what he says. He he says my wife
[1:23:13] said this is in his vision or dream. He
[1:23:18] says my wife she had been living with
[1:23:19] another man so unfaithful to him and and
[1:23:21] running around on me and said then she
[1:23:23] come to me and she said to me oh darling
[1:23:25] forgive me forgive me. Said I'm sorry I
[1:23:27] did. I'll be true from now on. Said of
[1:23:29] course I loved her so much. I just
[1:23:30] forgive her. Said all right. And then
[1:23:32] said do you know what? Then I got the
[1:23:34] interpretation of this vision. said that
[1:23:36] was the woman. So he's equating his
[1:23:39] dream of his wife being unfaithful to
[1:23:41] him and it being all right to this woman
[1:23:44] now it's all right.
[1:23:46] Watch this said sure she's been married
[1:23:49] and so for all these times it's all
[1:23:51] right for her to marry because the Lord
[1:23:52] loved her so much she can marry as many
[1:23:54] times as she wants as far I said your
[1:23:56] vision was mighty sweet but it was way
[1:23:59] off
[1:24:03] it was way off the beaten path. I said
[1:24:05] it's wrong.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; It was mighty sweet, but it was from the
[1:24:09] devil.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; That's mighty strong. Well, where did it
[1:24:13] come from? Didn't come from God.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; So, it came from the devil.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; It friends, it don't matter how
[1:24:18] spiritual it seems. If it's against the
[1:24:21] word,
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; it's from the devil.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; I shared this other story. you know, I I
[1:24:26] I I sit with on the school and we were
[1:24:28] we just been um hiring a new a new
[1:24:31] principal for our school and this
[1:24:33] candidate was having an interview with
[1:24:35] us and one of the questions and actually
[1:24:38] actually there was a couple candidates
[1:24:39] there a at first and one was a woman and
[1:24:42] we were talking about this candidate and
[1:24:44] one of the board members was saying you
[1:24:47] know I kind of am uncomfortable with
[1:24:48] where this woman is coming from because
[1:24:50] her church it's the woman pastor it's
[1:24:51] the woman this it's the woman that and I
[1:24:53] kind of have a trouble with women in
[1:24:54] leadership in the church. And there
[1:24:56] became a kind of a thing here, right?
[1:24:58] Cuz some on the board even they were
[1:25:00] four women preachers. They were four
[1:25:02] women pastors and there were three of us
[1:25:03] that weren't that way, right? And one of
[1:25:06] them that his wife actually is a pastor.
[1:25:08] So you know where he stands. But he said
[1:25:10] our senior pastor, he used to see that
[1:25:12] way. He used to see that women shouldn't
[1:25:14] be in leadership in the church. He used
[1:25:16] to but he prayed about it. He studied it
[1:25:18] for months and months. And you know
[1:25:20] what? He came out on the other side. I
[1:25:22] didn't say anything. And I thought,
[1:25:23] "What does that matter? His mind might
[1:25:26] have changed.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; His understanding might have changed,
[1:25:29] but God's word never changed.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; It didn't change.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; It's still the word. It's still the
[1:25:34] truth, friends. I don't care if that if
[1:25:36] that if that pastor had a vision that
[1:25:38] that woman was at his pulpit, it was
[1:25:39] still wrong."
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; And you know, and oh, let let me get off
[1:25:44] that. Let me let me go on to something
[1:25:46] here, right? Let me go to another
[1:25:47] example because we're we just want to
[1:25:48] keep going here. How many remember when
[1:25:50] Ahab, right? Amen. was wanting to go and
[1:25:53] get Ramoth Gilead. You all know the
[1:25:55] story, right? Amen. But Jehoshaphat,
[1:25:58] Amen, being a man of God said,
[1:25:59] "Shouldn't we inquire of the Lord
[1:26:00] first?" Oh, yeah, sure. Why didn't I
[1:26:02] think of that? Actually, we have 400
[1:26:04] prophets.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, you do? Hey, okay, they come. And
[1:26:06] oh, what do they prophesy? Go on up. Go
[1:26:10] on up and prosper, Ahab. The Lord is
[1:26:12] given to you. And Zedekiah even was
[1:26:14] anointed,
[1:26:16] had a vision, Brother Brandham said, to
[1:26:18] make these horns of iron. And he said,
[1:26:20] "Thus saith the Lord,
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; the Lord spoke to me and told me to make
[1:26:26] these these horns of iron and that you
[1:26:28] will push the Syrians out." Oh,
[1:26:31] hallelujah.
[1:26:32] Yeah. Amen, Zedekiah. Woo. Praise be to
[1:26:36] God. Oh, they were in one accord. And
[1:26:38] now I'm not I'm not I'm not mocking
[1:26:40] that. I'm just just stay with me.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Let me read it the way.
[1:26:48] Oh my. Because friends, they they were
[1:26:50] they were they were in one accord.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, one mind.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; They were shouting.
[1:26:57] They were having a good old quote
[1:27:00] unquote Pentecostal meeting. I believe
[1:27:02] in Pentecost. But oh, they were getting
[1:27:05] excited. Oh, yeah. That's right. That's
[1:27:07] right. Oh, they were anointed.
[1:27:10] The trouble is they were anointed by the
[1:27:12] wrong spirit.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; They thought it was the Holy Spirit, but
[1:27:15] it was actually a lying spirit.
[1:27:20] and they come up, you know, and
[1:27:21] Jehoshaphat, see, he was a man of God.
[1:27:24] And there was something in him just
[1:27:25] didn't sound right.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; My That's the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Trust your Holy Ghost.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Trust, okay? Because sometimes, oh, I I
[1:27:34] hope I don't get caught into false
[1:27:36] doctrine. I just hope I don't get
[1:27:38] deceived by because some people say, I I
[1:27:39] can't sit under a man because, you know,
[1:27:41] I I just they might lead me wrong.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Lead your Holy Ghost wrong.
[1:27:46] No,
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; we're not trusting upon our intellect.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can come to service and open up
[1:27:52] our heart.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost, Amen, will guide you.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; The trusting your Holy Ghost. Don't
[1:27:59] trust in your intellect. Don't trust, oh
[1:28:01] my understanding. Because what will
[1:28:03] happen? You lean to your own
[1:28:04] understanding and you start to reject
[1:28:07] the word.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Trust in your Holy Ghost. He cannot
[1:28:12] fail. He cannot be deceived. The elect
[1:28:14] cannot be deceived. It doesn't mean that
[1:28:17] we just gobble up everything. We prove
[1:28:18] all things. You see, there's a middle of
[1:28:20] the road.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you're I hope you're catching
[1:28:23] it this morning. Hallelujah. Watch this.
[1:28:26] Cuz Micaiah comes up, right? And Ahab
[1:28:29] says, "What do you say? Go on up.
[1:28:33] Go up and prosper, Ahab." There must
[1:28:35] have been something in his tone that
[1:28:36] Ahab said, "Come on.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Haven't I always told you to tell me the
[1:28:41] truth?
[1:28:43] Okay, you really want to know the truth?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "Hear there now, therefore the
[1:28:49] word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting
[1:28:50] on his throne and all the hosts of
[1:28:52] heaven standing by him in his right hand
[1:28:53] and his left." And the Lord said, "Who
[1:28:55] shall persuade Ahab that he may go up
[1:28:57] and fall at Rama Gilead?" And one said,
[1:29:00] "On this man, another on this manner."
[1:29:01] And there came a spirit, a demon from
[1:29:04] hell,
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; and stood before the Lord and said, "I
[1:29:08] will persuade him." And the Lord said
[1:29:10] unto him, "Wherewith?" And he said, "I
[1:29:11] will go forth and I will be a lying
[1:29:14] spirit in the mouth of all his
[1:29:16] prophets." And he said, "Thou will
[1:29:18] persuade him.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; You will do it and prevail. Go forth and
[1:29:22] do so." Now therefore, behold, the Lord
[1:29:24] hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of
[1:29:27] all these thy prophets.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Anointed,
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; saying the same thing.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you another story? I just
[1:29:38] kid. I had it said to me, you know, by
[1:29:41] by a brother that follows a different
[1:29:42] doctrine of the message. You know what
[1:29:45] proves that we're right? We're all
[1:29:46] saying the same thing. Everywhere else
[1:29:48] in the message, there's division people
[1:29:50] and and people saying different things,
[1:29:52] but we say the same thing.
[1:29:57] I said, cuz you're all listening to one
[1:29:58] another.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; You're all streaming one another's
[1:30:00] services. That's why.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; But even if they were saying all the
[1:30:04] same thing, Ahab's prophets were saying
[1:30:06] the same thing. If it doesn't match up
[1:30:08] with the word,
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; it's wrong.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; That's what the Catholic Church says.
[1:30:14] We're We never changed. Are you serious?
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; We're the original. Well, the original
[1:30:19] Catholic Church, I'm original.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; You're original, friends. As long as
[1:30:24] it's in the word, Amen. Like brother
[1:30:26] said, as long as Calvin was in the
[1:30:27] Bible, I'm a Calvinist. As long as
[1:30:29] Armenianism is in the Bible, I'm an
[1:30:31] Armenian, right? Amen. And so friends,
[1:30:34] whatever you want to call yourself, if
[1:30:36] you want to call me a Baptist,
[1:30:37] Pentecostal, Presbyterian, Catholic, as
[1:30:39] long as in the word, you can call me
[1:30:40] whatever you want. I'm a son of God.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But watch this. Amen. Oh, the
[1:30:46] lying spirit. God, Lord has put a lying
[1:30:49] spirit in the mouth of all these
[1:30:50] prophets, and the Lord has spoken evil
[1:30:52] concerning thee. Oh, the atmosphere
[1:30:54] went,
[1:30:55] [Laughter]
[1:30:57] oh my, there there was a hush. And it
[1:30:59] wasn't a holy hush, but can you imagine?
[1:31:02] Well, these fellows said, now I'm just
[1:31:04] quoting. True sign is overlooked. They
[1:31:06] said, but we saw a vision. Those 400
[1:31:09] prophets, we know we are prophets. We
[1:31:12] know for we are prophets. Mia said, I
[1:31:14] don't doubt but what you saw a vision.
[1:31:18] I don't doubt it a bit what you saw a
[1:31:20] vision, but it ain't according to the
[1:31:22] word.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Said, I saw I saw a vision, too.
[1:31:27] Amen. Oh, mercy. He was a sign. He was a
[1:31:29] sign. He said, "I saw a vision and I saw
[1:31:31] Israel like sheep scattered on a hill
[1:31:34] having no shepherd." So both sides were
[1:31:37] anointed. Both sides had visions.
[1:31:40] How do you discern between the true and
[1:31:42] false? Compare it to the word.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Micaiah when there was 400 well-dressed
[1:31:47] prophets standing there saying to Ahab
[1:31:48] and say, "Go up. The Lord is with you."
[1:31:50] Micaiah said, "Go on up if you want to."
[1:31:53] But the Lord told me, "I see an Israel
[1:31:54] scattered like sheep on a hill." Why?
[1:31:56] when 400 prophets prophesying contrary
[1:31:58] to what he was, how could he be so sure?
[1:32:00] Can you imagine, friends? Amen. If we we
[1:32:02] have the benefit of looking back.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; But if you were in the congregation that
[1:32:06] day and everyone in the message was
[1:32:08] saying one way,
[1:32:18] other ministers on this side
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; and said something different.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; It'd be easier to follow the group.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; The word,
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; the whole word,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; and nothing but the word.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Let his word be true. Let every other
[1:32:33] man's word be a lie, but his word be the
[1:32:35] truth. Let's hold on to the word.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Hold to the word.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Don't hold to your own idea or
[1:32:41] somebody's idea because what what let oh
[1:32:43] what happens friends is people Amen.
[1:32:45] They won't believe it unless it come
[1:32:46] from their favorite preacher.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, but if so and so said it, okay, it's
[1:32:51] good.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; My pastor said it all these years, but I
[1:32:54] never accepted it until my favorite
[1:32:55] preacher said it.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Now you're right, brother Zigg. Now
[1:32:58] you're right, brother Moses. Come on,
[1:32:59] friends. We ought to be more mature than
[1:33:01] that.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Cuz what what? Look, watch this.
[1:33:08] Micaiah. Oh, going up. Why? When 400
[1:33:10] prophets were prophesying contrary to
[1:33:12] what he was, how could he be so sure?
[1:33:13] because his vision compared with the
[1:33:16] word of God. That's the reason he know
[1:33:18] it. Oh, how I wish I had about an hour
[1:33:19] now to preach right here. If your vision
[1:33:22] don't compare with the word, forget
[1:33:23] about your vision.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; What was the word of the Lord? Well,
[1:33:28] there was a vindicated prophet that had
[1:33:31] gone before him, Elijah, that had said
[1:33:33] that was the word that you were to
[1:33:34] compare your vision to. And the word was
[1:33:37] thus saith the Lord in the place where
[1:33:39] the dog lick the the blood of Nabal
[1:33:41] shall lick shall the dogs lick thy
[1:33:43] blood. That was the prophecy. That was
[1:33:45] the word through a vindicated prophet.
[1:33:48] Friends, amen. And anointed ones at end
[1:33:50] time. Brother says there was one of them
[1:33:51] by the name of Micaiah who was anointed
[1:33:52] with God and sent by God with the word
[1:33:55] of God. There was one Zedekiah who
[1:33:57] thought he was sent by God. He was
[1:34:00] anointed of God but his teaching his
[1:34:03] teaching
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; his teaching was contrary to the word of
[1:34:07] God. And how many know friends brother
[1:34:09] Brown was go on to say in that message
[1:34:11] the teaching is actually the fruit
[1:34:14] because everybody can produce fruits of
[1:34:16] the spirit. The denominations often
[1:34:18] produce more fruits of the spirit than
[1:34:20] we do. Love, gentleness, meekness. But
[1:34:23] friends, he would break it down and say,
[1:34:25] "The fruit is the teaching. The food
[1:34:28] induces the teaching is the fruit of the
[1:34:31] season." Go look it up. Amen. But watch
[1:34:34] this. Even though Zedekiah said, "The
[1:34:36] Lord spoke to me. The Holy Spirit is
[1:34:38] anointing me." It sounded so good.
[1:34:42] But it was a line spirit.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Look, the man was sincere. Anointed ones
[1:34:46] at the end time. He said, "Make these
[1:34:47] horns and go up there before the king
[1:34:49] and push westward. or whichever way the
[1:34:50] land laid from where they were standing
[1:34:52] push and that'll be thus sayaeth the
[1:34:54] Lord he's going to win the victory and
[1:34:55] come back a victory for the church going
[1:34:57] to drive them out that's pretty close
[1:34:59] isn't it what was the matter here come
[1:35:01] Micaiah down said now you give your
[1:35:03] prophecy going up but I see in Israel
[1:35:05] like sheep scattered having no shepherd
[1:35:07] exactly vice versa now you're the
[1:35:10] congregation which one is right
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; we have the hindsight but put yourself
[1:35:17] there which is right both Both of them
[1:35:20] prophets. The only way you can tell the
[1:35:22] difference in them is check it by the
[1:35:24] word.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Glory. Oh,
[1:35:30] let me go on.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Despise not prophesyings. Despise not
[1:35:35] these things, the gifts, all these
[1:35:36] things, but prove them. Prove all
[1:35:39] things.
[1:35:40] Amen. Let me say this. I want every gift
[1:35:43] that God will give me. I want every
[1:35:45] sensation, every feeling that God will
[1:35:48] allow me to have. every revelation,
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; but let it be according to the word.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that I believe that's your
[1:35:55] desire as well.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Let's look at one more example before we
[1:35:58] close here.
[1:36:01] We're speaking about the middle of the
[1:36:02] road, the way of holiness. Let's look at
[1:36:05] it in applying the token.
[1:36:08] Now, you say that's it's so simple. Now,
[1:36:11] watch this because you all know this
[1:36:12] quote. I'm going to read it to you. It's
[1:36:14] from the token because we know how the
[1:36:16] prophet taught us to apply the token.
[1:36:18] kick the trash out, clean house.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Right? How many know the quote I'm
[1:36:24] referring to? We're going to read it
[1:36:26] here. But I dare say, friends, brothers,
[1:36:29] take that and demolish their family with
[1:36:31] it.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they're not walking in the
[1:36:34] way of holiness. You say, "What are you
[1:36:36] talking about?" Because they're saying,
[1:36:38] "But I'm I'm following the word. I'm
[1:36:39] just doing what Brother Brandham said."
[1:36:42] Let's read it. There's two sides
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; on the extreme.
[1:36:48] There's one side, oh, they're just we're
[1:36:50] getting rid of the trash in our and they
[1:36:52] don't take no consideration for the
[1:36:54] stage that their kids are in.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; They don't take into consideration their
[1:36:59] wife.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Can I go on?
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; But then the other side doesn't do
[1:37:09] nothing. And they just expect because
[1:37:11] we're in the message, it'll be all
[1:37:13] right. They're both wrong. Watch this.
[1:37:16] How did the prophet teach us to apply
[1:37:17] the token? Believe the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:19] for your house. Apply the token to your
[1:37:21] house. Then what do you do when you
[1:37:22] apply to your house? Move all the trash
[1:37:24] out. Get all the short skirts and the
[1:37:27] shorts and the cards and the cigarettes
[1:37:28] and the televisions, whatever more and
[1:37:30] kick them out the door.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; When you go apply the token, won't stand
[1:37:33] still for it. Yes, sir. Take it all out.
[1:37:35] All the dances and parties and rock and
[1:37:36] roll and old vulgar newspapers and the
[1:37:38] stuff that's out the world. Kick it out
[1:37:39] the door and say, "We're cleaning out
[1:37:41] this place around here." here. I know
[1:37:42] the B and the brothers slammed their
[1:37:44] token message and said, "I'm going to do
[1:37:45] that right now.
[1:37:48] We're cleaning house."
[1:37:51] They forgot to read the rest of the
[1:37:53] quote.
[1:37:54] Oh, it got real quiet cuz most of us
[1:37:57] stopped reading there. We're kicking the
[1:37:59] T. And that's right.
[1:38:02] We're getting that video game and then
[1:38:04] we went to turn the trash. Watch this.
[1:38:08] Like Jacob did because Amen. Let me just
[1:38:12] go on. Told his wife said, "Wash your
[1:38:14] clothes and everything. Put away them
[1:38:15] gods." You know what Joshua said before
[1:38:17] crossing over? He said, "Wash your
[1:38:18] clothes. Come not at your wives and so
[1:38:20] forth. Get ready for within 3 days we're
[1:38:21] going to cross Jordan." Amen. He was
[1:38:23] getting ready applying the token. Amen.
[1:38:25] That's it. Get ready. Apply it. Believe
[1:38:27] it. Clean up.
[1:38:30] So we say, "Amen, brother Brown. We're
[1:38:31] going to clean up. We're applying the
[1:38:33] token." Now, before I keep going, I
[1:38:36] believe in holiness.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:38] I believe that our children ought to
[1:38:42] know what's right and wrong.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; They need to know what the standard is.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; So keep that in mind. I believe in that.
[1:38:51] But there's a middle of the road.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a balance and the
[1:38:55] prophet gave us the balance. Now this is
[1:38:58] exactly the same quote. Let So apply the
[1:39:01] to kick the trash out. Get all the
[1:39:03] shorts and the all this and out of it.
[1:39:05] Television out. Get it out.
[1:39:08] Let your children, let your family, let
[1:39:11] your loved ones see it in you.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Because you know what happened? Brothers
[1:39:19] went and kicked all the trash out and
[1:39:20] kept the trash in them.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Well, I I can do this cuz I'm I'm mature
[1:39:25] enough. And their kids see that.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; It doesn't jive.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Don't talk again. Don't Don't bug your
[1:39:32] Don't Don't bully. And they bully the
[1:39:34] pastor. They bully their brother.
[1:39:38] This is how we apply the token. Let your
[1:39:41] children, let your family, let your
[1:39:43] loved ones see it in you.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; The applier
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; see it in you.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Uh-oh.
[1:39:51] Just like brothers took Ephesians 5:22.
[1:39:54] Why submit yourself? Did you hear what
[1:39:56] the prophet said? Did you hear what the
[1:39:57] scripture says? You submit yourself. And
[1:40:00] forgot the second part. Brother Ram
[1:40:02] said, "You live a life
[1:40:05] before them that they can submit to.
[1:40:10] There is two sides,
[1:40:12] but there's a middle of the road. And
[1:40:14] the redeemed will walk in it.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; It's a way of holiness.
[1:40:19] Let your children, let your family, let
[1:40:21] your loved ones see it in you." That's
[1:40:22] right. It'll take effect. Yes, sir. Then
[1:40:25] apply the token in prayer.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; My, we forgot all this.
[1:40:31] with consideration, with believing.
[1:40:35] Apply it with such love.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; It's the way of holiness. There's a way
[1:40:42] to apply the token. Apply it with such
[1:40:45] love and so forth till you know it's
[1:40:47] going to take it's going to take place.
[1:40:49] That's all. Apply it in confidence
[1:40:51] believing it's going to help. When you
[1:40:53] talk to that child,
[1:40:55] oh, we're just getting rid of your junk.
[1:40:57] Did you talk to the child? Cuz
[1:40:59] guaranteed the child. Why, Dad? Why?
[1:41:02] Don't bother with that. I just told you
[1:41:04] so.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Resentment, bitterness in people I
[1:41:10] talked to that were in the message right
[1:41:12] now.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; And their parents did what they thought
[1:41:14] best,
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; there's a middle of the road.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Watch this. I'm not done.
[1:41:23] When you talk to your husband, talk to
[1:41:26] your wife, talk to this loved one,
[1:41:28] believe that it's going to help. Just
[1:41:29] stand there and say, "Lord, I've claimed
[1:41:31] them. They're mine. I'm getting them for
[1:41:33] you, Lord." Apply it. What token? And
[1:41:36] create that atmosphere around you.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, and we applied it in the past. Maybe
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; we create an atmosphere. All right.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Of anger
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; and bitterness and turmoil and strife.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Create that atmosphere around you. The
[1:41:54] applier.
[1:41:56] Watch that. They'll just drop right into
[1:41:59] it. This is rich.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; See? Oh, you are. If you got the token.
[1:42:06] See, there's another problem. Some
[1:42:08] people try to apply it and they don't
[1:42:09] have the token themselves.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; It won't work. You got to have the token
[1:42:14] and then you apply it. If you got the
[1:42:18] token, you create a spirit around you.
[1:42:20] This is all one quote. I'm not cutting
[1:42:21] pasting. A power that when you walk,
[1:42:24] people know that you're a Christian.
[1:42:26] They love for you to say something to
[1:42:28] them, including your kids.
[1:42:31] They love for you to say something to
[1:42:33] them. They believe your word. What you
[1:42:36] say, they hold on to it. You see, that's
[1:42:38] it.
[1:42:41] Glory be to God.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; There's more there's more to the way of
[1:42:45] holiness than just dos and don'ts,
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; than just a code of conduct and just a
[1:42:52] code of ethics. No, there there there's
[1:42:55] Holy Ghost leadership.
[1:42:58] Them that are sons of God are led by the
[1:43:01] spirit of God.
[1:43:03] They will apply the token. They will get
[1:43:05] rid of the trash
[1:43:08] the way God shows them how to do it. And
[1:43:11] there'll be such a life in them that
[1:43:14] their family drops into it. My no wonder
[1:43:18] the scripture talks about you know that
[1:43:20] our conversation be a certain way that
[1:43:22] the e the the wicked be ashamed right we
[1:43:25] live such a life you know those that are
[1:43:26] in the workplace you live such a life
[1:43:28] that you don't have to say a thing
[1:43:29] sometimes and they just know they say a
[1:43:31] swear word oh I'm sorry I'm sorry
[1:43:33] brother Moses I I didn't mean to say
[1:43:35] that did you tell oh I'm the pastor
[1:43:37] restored word
[1:43:39] and you need to be saved you need to
[1:43:42] repent I've heard brothers oh my it's
[1:43:44] just I wouldn't do it that way per se
[1:43:46] maybe If the Lord leads you to do it
[1:43:47] that way, do it that way. Amen. But
[1:43:49] Amen. We our lives, the atmosphere,
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; that is around us.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. It it speaks to people. You know,
[1:43:58] we I'm sure you've had people come into
[1:44:00] your congregation. You might not they
[1:44:02] hear the word. Amen. You know what? They
[1:44:04] might have not even got a thing out of
[1:44:05] the preaching, but they notice, my your
[1:44:08] women sure are modest.
[1:44:11] And the atmosphere, you know, we had we
[1:44:13] have a young brother that's been coming
[1:44:14] to our church, 19 years old. You know,
[1:44:16] he said everyone has a twinkle in their
[1:44:18] eye.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Did he hear all the He's been
[1:44:21] questioning about the about the message
[1:44:22] and the prophet and things, but he
[1:44:24] noticed first the people,
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; the atmosphere, the spirit that is
[1:44:28] amongst the people. That's what ought to
[1:44:31] speak to people. Friends,
[1:44:34] let's close, friends. Let God let God
[1:44:37] keep us in the straight and narrow on
[1:44:39] the way the way of holiness. It's the
[1:44:42] middle of the road. Because friends,
[1:44:43] guarantee you, Satan is going to try to
[1:44:45] drag you to one side or the other.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; If he can't get keep you in the middle,
[1:44:49] he's going to try to push you over to
[1:44:50] this side,
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; right? So far, right, that you can't
[1:44:54] even see the other side. You can't see
[1:44:56] the other side of the story.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're just so focused on this part
[1:45:00] of the word, we don't see the rest of
[1:45:01] the word.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Keep us in the middle of the road, Lord,
[1:45:04] that I can pull from each side. Oh, the
[1:45:07] deep things of God. Oh, the deep, the
[1:45:08] mysterious, and the simple.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; The simple. Being a children,
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; loving one another.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Talking nice about one another.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; I don't have to do that. I understand
[1:45:20] the seals. No,
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; keep us in the middle of the road. Lord,
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; there is a highway and a way. It's
[1:45:30] called the way holiness. as as I as we
[1:45:32] stand here, musicians come,
[1:45:36] you know that story that Brother Brown
[1:45:37] tells about, you know, the the
[1:45:38] competition for the Schwin bike, right?
[1:45:41] There was a way, right? It was narrow
[1:45:44] across that plank. But you know what?
[1:45:46] All all the other all the other boys,
[1:45:48] they were looking they were looking at
[1:45:50] this church, looking at that person,
[1:45:52] criticizing this person, criticizing
[1:45:54] that sinner, and they fell off.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; But you know the boy who won, he said,
[1:45:58] "You know what the trouble was? You guys
[1:45:59] were looking here, looking there,
[1:46:00] looking down, afraid you would fall. Oh,
[1:46:03] the devil gets us there. Oh, I hope I
[1:46:06] don't fall. Oh, no. Keep your eyes on
[1:46:08] the prize. He kept his eyes on the prize
[1:46:10] and he went along the way and he got the
[1:46:13] prize, Lord. Keep us true.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Father, we're so
[1:46:18] thankful to you this morning, Lord.
[1:46:20] Lord, you have a way. Keep us in the
[1:46:22] way, Lord Jesus. Lead us, Father. Lord,
[1:46:25] I just trust, Lord, if I said anything
[1:46:28] untoward, Lord, you forgive me, Lord.
[1:46:30] But I just pray, God, that Lord, you
[1:46:31] take these words and hide them in our
[1:46:33] hearts, Lord, that we might not sin
[1:46:35] against you, Lord. And keep us in the
[1:46:37] middle of the road, Lord, in everything
[1:46:39] that we do, Lord. Our lives, our
[1:46:40] spiritual lives, our church lives, Lord.
[1:46:42] Our family lives, Lord. That's what we
[1:46:45] want, Lord. We want balance in our
[1:46:47] lives, Lord. I know we all think we're
[1:46:49] balanced, Lord, but the only thing that
[1:46:50] balances us is your word, Lord.
[1:46:53] Lord, we love you. Father, bless this
[1:46:56] church. Lord, bless this assembly. God,
[1:46:58] bless brother Moses. Bless brother Zigg.
[1:47:00] Lord, bless all the elders, musicians,
[1:47:03] the leoty. Lord, the Sunday school
[1:47:05] teacher, Lord, the deacons, every single
[1:47:07] one, Lord, young, old, middle-aged,
[1:47:10] Lord, bless them, Father, we ask these
[1:47:13] things in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:15] Amen.
[1:47:18] What you, brother?
[1:47:22] Let's let's sing that.
[1:47:25] For
[1:47:26] the Lord shall return, oh, and come with
[1:47:30] singing

[1:47:36] be upon their head. And therefore the

[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Unto Zion an everlasting joy will be
[1:49:32] upon their head.
[1:49:37] [Music]
[1:49:44] That was a masterpiece. Amen.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; That was indeed a masterpiece. Praise
[1:49:49] God.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. It It could not be
[1:49:58] delivered way better than this.
[1:50:02] It was wonderful. God bless you, brother
[1:50:04] Gideon. We We were really fed and I was
[1:50:07] fed. It was it was um something that is
[1:50:11] in my heart and uh and uh and I even
[1:50:14] shared it last time on Sunday with my
[1:50:17] brother. He's also a minister, a pastor
[1:50:20] and uh just shared a little bit on that
[1:50:23] thought and it just struck my heart and
[1:50:25] I'm just going to open up a little bit
[1:50:27] myself uh this morning as the channel
[1:50:31] has been open a little bit.
[1:50:33] May God help us to become mature
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; and myself included.
[1:50:40] May God help us to become mature and if
[1:50:43] we are not very careful. um we will be
[1:50:47] on one side without realizing it and and
[1:50:51] it's not like you are you are you are
[1:50:53] worldly or no you you're a Christian
[1:50:56] you're in a message and everything goes
[1:50:57] fine but you you end up in being in a
[1:51:00] corner and you just see the way you want
[1:51:03] to see things and if if anything is not
[1:51:06] the way you see it no that's not correct
[1:51:08] but and and if you're not careful that's
[1:51:12] God is not pleased but but we desire to
[1:51:15] become mature. Lord, make me more
[1:51:17] mature. Make me and I share that with
[1:51:21] pastor Zik one time as well. The most
[1:51:23] difficult thing in the in the message is
[1:51:26] to be balanced.
[1:51:28] It's it's it's becoming harder and
[1:51:30] harder because
[1:51:33] each minister has his own way and we
[1:51:36] have our favorite preacher sometimes
[1:51:39] because they just see the way I want to
[1:51:42] see and you have your own corner.
[1:51:45] But Lord help me to to be open.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; I like an evangelist. I like a teacher.
[1:51:52] I like an apostle. I like a pastor.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Why we have why we we corner ourel in
[1:51:59] one corner? Lord help me to be balanced.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes how it shows that you
[1:52:05] are mature when you can accept sometimes
[1:52:08] we're still struggling and you're
[1:52:10] helping him. You know he's not there yet
[1:52:12] but I'm helping him. I'm loving him. I'm
[1:52:15] not criticizing him. I'm not putting him
[1:52:17] down. Oh Lord, help us. Help me. Help
[1:52:21] me.
[1:52:23] You know, uh the prophet say we need
[1:52:25] both sides. We need a dynamic.
[1:52:28] We need the mechanic. Times we just go
[1:52:31] mechanic mechanic mechanic one time. You
[1:52:33] know, sometimes we don't have two
[1:52:35] services, but we it's good to be home
[1:52:37] two services. We by God's grace, we need
[1:52:40] to go back to two services. If I
[1:52:42] preaching this evening, it means I'm
[1:52:44] available in the evening. I can preach
[1:52:45] in the evening.
[1:52:47] So it's just the church. If the church
[1:52:49] come, we are we we we are willing to do
[1:52:51] that. We can do that. So you know
[1:52:54] sometimes when you have two services in
[1:52:56] the morning,
[1:52:58] the minister preach in the morning, it
[1:52:59] goes one side in the evening can take
[1:53:02] the opposite of the other one who preach
[1:53:04] in the morning.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; And if you're not mature enough, you
[1:53:07] think like oh that one was contradicting
[1:53:09] the other one. No, it was just the way
[1:53:13] God led him and the other way. And both
[1:53:15] ways are in the message and and and the
[1:53:18] more you become a Jew, just say amen to
[1:53:20] the word of God because the other one
[1:53:21] look at the other angle, the other look
[1:53:23] in the other angle.
[1:53:25] No, brother G, that was for me. That was
[1:53:27] for me.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; That was for me. May God help us. Amen.
[1:53:32] And sometimes we apply just the word of
[1:53:34] God and apply the word of God, but
[1:53:36] there's no love behind it. There's no
[1:53:38] life behind it. becomes just just
[1:53:42] quoting or proving that I I know
[1:53:45] something. Oh Lord, help me to go beyond
[1:53:47] that to produce the life of the message.
[1:53:51] That was for me really. May God bless
[1:53:53] you. I needed that. And in our church, I
[1:53:56] think we need that. Amen. As become and
[1:53:59] I know we have been we have been
[1:54:01] blessed. One of the thing we are blessed
[1:54:03] in this in this church small church we
[1:54:04] are blessed because we invite every
[1:54:06] minister because the pastor can't
[1:54:09] produce everything and we bring other
[1:54:12] ministers they have other gift they are
[1:54:14] they see things in different way but by
[1:54:17] God's grace we we are very well fed
[1:54:19] because we take from other churches amen
[1:54:22] and we continue to do that amen so that
[1:54:25] God bless us no wonderful amen fill my
[1:54:28] fill fill my way with love fill my way
[1:54:31] with
[1:54:34] [Music]
[1:54:36] Let me walk blessed Lord in the way thou

[1:56:54] let me go all the while with a song and
[1:56:59] a smile. Fill my way every day with
[1:57:04] love.
[1:57:07] Is that the desire of your heart? May
[1:57:09] God fill us with more or more of his
[1:57:11] love. I like the coat he read there. You
[1:57:14] know, on one side you can become so

[2:07:33] had no peace with it. Till I heard how
[2:07:37] Jesus died upon the tree.
[2:07:41] Then I fell down at his feet and there
[2:07:45] came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter
[2:07:49] abides with me.

[2:09:02] There's no thirsting for the things of
[2:09:06] the world. They've taken wings. Long ago

[2:10:19] Dear heavenly father,
[2:10:21] I just want to thank you, Lord, for what
[2:10:23] we heard today, Lord.
[2:10:26] May it rest in our hearts, Lord. May we
[2:10:28] do things about it, Lord. May we have
[2:10:31] the courage to do it, Lord.
[2:10:34] Give us the strength, Lord Jesus.
[2:10:38] That you know what is right for us,
[2:10:39] Lord. Not ourselves, Lord, but what you
[2:10:43] want us for us, Lord.
[2:10:46] Thank you, Father,
[2:10:49] thank you for your teaching. Lord, thank
[2:10:52] you for opening our ears today.
[2:10:55] Let us open our hearts to you today,
[2:10:57] Lord. May you just bless us all here.
[2:11:02] May we have a wonderful Jesus with you,
[2:11:04] Lord, as we leave this place. Thank you,
[2:11:07] heavenly father. Thank you. I ask this
[2:11:11] in Jesus Christ name.
[2:11:13] Amen.
[2:11:22] closing just as we are closing just sing
[2:11:25] that. Thank you, brother Scott, for the
[2:11:27] prayer. I'll cry the solid rock. I stand
[2:11:29] and I'll be dismissed.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; My
[2:11:41] nothing less than Jesus blood and
[2:11:46] righteousness.
[2:11:48] I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but
[2:11:53] holy lean on Jesus name.
[2:11:57] On Christ the solid rock I stand. Oh,
[2:12:02] all other ground is sinking sand.
[2:12:07] All other ground is sinking sand.
[2:12:12] When darkness seems to hide his face, I
[2:12:17] rest on his unchanging grace. In every
[2:12:22] high and stormy gale, my anchor holds
[2:12:27] within the veil.
[2:12:30] On Christ the solid rock I stand. Oh,
[2:12:35] all other ground is sinking sand.
[2:12:39] All other ground is sinking sand.
[2:12:44] His oath is covenant and his blood.
[2:12:49] Support me in the welling flood. When
[2:12:54] all around my soul gives way, even then
[2:12:59] is all my hope and stay
[2:13:03] on Christ the soul
[2:13:06] of dust and all other ground is sinking
[2:13:10] sand. All other ground is sinking sand.
[2:13:17] when he shall come with trumpet sound.
[2:13:21] Oh, may I then in him be found dressed
[2:13:26] in his rightousness
[2:13:28] alone, faultless to stand before the
[2:13:33] throne.
[2:13:34] On Christ the solid rock I stand. Oh,
[2:13:39] all other ground is sinking sand. All
[2:13:44] other ground is sinking sand.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; My Christianity walk cannot be based on
[2:13:52] my own righteousness. It's based on
[2:13:54] Christ's righteousness, his holiness.
[2:13:58] That's the solid ground. Amen. God bless
[2:14:00] you. I dismissed and thank you for
[2:14:02] coming to the service this morning. God
[2:14:04] bless you.
