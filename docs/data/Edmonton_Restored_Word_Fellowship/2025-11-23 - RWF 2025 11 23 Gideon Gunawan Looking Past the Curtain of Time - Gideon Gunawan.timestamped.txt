[32:16] Exodus chapter 26. I really appreciated that that that special this morning. Amen. God bless you.
[32:24] Exodus chapter 26 verse 31 reads, "And thou shalt," sorry, I'll I'll hear the rustling,
[32:32] so it's not the rustling of the malberry bush. Maybe I trust it is. Amen. Exodus chapter 26. Are
[32:40] we there? Amen. Verse 31. And thou shalt make a veil of blue and purple and scarlet and fine twine
[32:47] linen of cunning work with cherubam shall it be made. And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of
[32:52] shitwood overlaid with gold. Their hooks shall be of gold upon the four sockets of silver. And thou
[32:57] shalt hang up the veil under the tashes or that thou mayest bring in thither within the veil the
[33:04] ark of the testimony. And the veil shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy.
[33:11] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. I'd like to speak to you this morning and title it looking
[33:17] past the curtain of time. Now, Amen. Just to lay a little bit of a foundation for this thought, you
[33:25] know, curtains are used for many things. You know, don't just think of curtains as a as a piece of
[33:30] decor, but it is used for that. You know, sisters will you don't just put up any old thing on in
[33:36] your house, right? Amen. To cover your windows or for decoration. You're you're you're interested
[33:40] in the color and the design and things. But it's not only for that. Curtains are sometimes used to,
[33:46] Amen. be a barrier, to be something to protect. Amen. To give privacy, right? Amen. You don't
[33:52] want just any old person to look into your house or look through your window. So, you put a curtain
[33:57] there. Are you with me? Amen. And you know, it kind of reminds me of of of um how many remember
[34:02] the old Calder Church? Who remember been I know I know the W Amen. have been there and brother
[34:08] Dan and brother Ziggs. So this this picture will bring back some memories. I hope you can see it
[34:13] here. But and I think Sister Wendy's right there. Amen. Right there. Right here. Just so I think
[34:20] right right here and I I was trying to Brother Ralph Claus is here. Brother Ed Hammeister,
[34:28] I think. And so anyways, I just thought that would be nostalgic. But you remember the red curtain,
[34:35] right? Right. So, I'm speaking about curtains, but my pastor's brother Jerry and I remember
[34:40] him telling the testimony when he come, he always wondered what's behind that curtain because when
[34:46] he first come to the to to to Alberta um and his brother, brother Ken Fury had witnessed to him,
[34:51] he thought brother Ken had joined a cult, right? And so he thought, "What is behind that curtain?
[34:57] Maybe it's behind that curtain is a picture of William Brandham." And all of a sudden,
[35:01] it'll open and everyone will start worshiping that picture. But you know what? It wasn't there wasn't
[35:06] nothing behind there. I think just a whiteboard, right? So the mystery was there there there was
[35:10] just a whiteboard behind there. But I'm talking about curtains. I'm just loosening you up here.
[35:16] Amen. But there's curtains can be used to close out light. Curtains can be used to dampen noise
[35:23] or to block off noise from outside. Are you with me this morning? There we're talking about the
[35:29] curtain of time. But you know in in in Exodus chapter 26, Amen. God begin to give directions
[35:36] on the tabernacle in the wilderness. And how many know that it was actually comprised of
[35:41] curtains? Amen. And just bear with me as we as we lay a foundation here. But in Exodus 26, it says,
[35:46] "Moreover, thou shalt make the tabernacle with 10 curtains of fine twine linen and
[35:51] blue and purple and scarlet. What cherubams of cunning work shalt thou make them?" In verse 7,
[35:55] "Thou shalt make curtains of goats hair." And so we see all these curtains in the tabernacle
[36:00] um in ch in verse 12. and the remnant that remainth of the curtains of the tent, the half
[36:04] curtain that remainth shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle. Verse 14, and thou shalt make a
[36:09] covering for the tent of ramkins dyed red, and a covering above of badger skins. Now, just think,
[36:17] friends, all that was visible, amen, to the naked eye, or if you were to be looking at it even as
[36:22] an outsider, amen, to look at that tabernacle, all you would see would be badger skins. That's right.
[36:29] Ain't that the truth, friends? Amen. People come in here, friends this morning, maybe visitors,
[36:33] all they would maybe see to their natural eye would be badger skins. And you realize, friends,
[36:38] that badgers were the meanest Amen. meanest animal ever. Amen. They were aggressive. They were mean.
[36:45] They were backbiters. They fight. That's right. Come on now, friends. Amen. That's what you were,
[36:51] friends. Amen. You You fought You fought the word. You fought your brother. You fought
[36:55] your sister. You fought the pastor. That's why those badgers had to die. Before they could be
[37:02] part of the temple, they had to die. Come on now. Hallelujah. But that was on the outside, friends.
[37:08] But I'm thankful on the outside. But underneath that, friends, was ramkin dyed red. Woo. Glory be
[37:16] to God. Amen. Amen. All the world sees is, oh, they're just just as human as I am. They get
[37:21] angry like I do. They get sad like I do. They go through things like I do. That's the truth,
[37:25] friends. But underneath that, friends, is ram's ram's skin dyed red. They don't see the blood. Oh,
[37:33] thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. There's a blood. Amen. That covers us, friends. Oh,
[37:38] on the outside it looks like we get tired. We get weary. We Amen. We go through things. How
[37:43] many is going through things? Amen. But friends, Amen. underneath that, friends,
[37:47] we are covered by the blood. How many know friends that the ram amen spoke of Jesus Christ? Amen. He
[37:55] was the ram. Amen. When when Abraham took Isaac up to Mount Mariah there, friends, and Isaac said,
[38:00] "Follow there." Amen. Here's the wood. Here's the fire. But where's where's where's the sacrifice?
[38:05] He said, "God will provide himself a sacrifice. He will provide for him. He will provide himself. A
[38:11] sacrifice." And when they got up there, what was Amen. up there caught in that thicket was a ram,
[38:16] a type of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Friends, I'm thankful for that covering, friends. Amen. We can
[38:23] we can sing this morning. I am covered. Covered. Covered by his blood. Jesus rescued me. Oh,
[38:31] glory. Amen. That's the curtain I want over my soul. Hallelujah. When he sees the blood. Friends,
[38:36] the devil can't even see that. That's why he accuses you day and night. Day and night. They
[38:41] did this, she did that. Didn't you see when they spoke wrong, didn't you see when they thought
[38:45] wrong? And and God begins to look at the record. But Jesus took his own blood and wrote, "Pardon.
[38:54] Oh, glory. Now, watch this as we just continue on. And thou shalt make a veil of blue and purple
[39:01] and scarlet. So, amen. There was curtains that covered the tabernacle. But really,
[39:05] the curtain that I want to focus on this morning is that curtain that was between the holy place
[39:10] and the most holy place. Now, watch. They saying, "Fine twin lin and a cunning work with cherubam
[39:15] shall it be made. And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shidamwood overlaid with gold.
[39:19] Their hook shall be of gold upon the four sockets of silver. And thou shalt hang up the veil under
[39:25] the thou mayest bring in thither within the veil the ark of the testimony and the veil shall divide
[39:31] unto you. Now watch this. That curtain, that veil was a dividing line between the holy place
[39:38] and the most holy place. Hallelujah. Amen. It was acting as a barrier, friends, to the mercy
[39:44] seat. It hid the ark of the covenant. It hid the golden pot. Amen. That was in that ark. It hid,
[39:54] Amen. the tables of stone. It hid the shikina of glory. It hid the two cherubams. Friends,
[40:01] everyone but the high priest. Amen. Wondered what is it like behind that veil? What is it really
[40:08] like? Only one person knew. Are you with me? Amen. That was the high priest. Aaron went in once a
[40:16] year with blood, right? To offer for the children of Israel for the sins. Amen. It, you know,
[40:21] for us friends, I know it's it's it's it's it's easy to see that because the veil has been torn,
[40:26] right? Amen. But think of yourself if you're an Israelite back in the wilderness, you would have
[40:30] wondered, my when Aaron comes out, he just is in awe and there's just something about him and
[40:36] there's an atmosphere and an aura around him. What is it? What makes him like that? He comes out just
[40:42] almost sometimes speechless. I'm just dramatizing. What is it that's behind it that's so awesome?
[40:49] And they would ask Aaron, "What was it like? What was it like?" "Oh, I I I I don't know how to say.
[40:55] I just can't even begin to say how awesome it is." And friends, I I I I tell you friends, we are so
[41:02] privileged, friends, to be able to go behind the veil. We don't have to ask brother so and so,
[41:08] what is it really like to be a Christian? What is it like, sister, to be an overcomer? What is it
[41:14] really like to be in the shina glory? What is it really like to be a real son or daughter of God?
[41:19] No, you can experience that yourself. Don't don't don't don't wait for somebody else. Don't say,
[41:24] "Well, I know brother Moses knows what it's like. I know what Brother Zigg knows what it's like to
[41:29] get behind the veil. You get behind the veil." Th friends, th those those cherubams that were
[41:35] in the Garden of Eden are not blocking the way, friends. They're they're they're making the way.
[41:40] They're they're they're encouraging. Get in. Get in. Hallelujah. Amen. But friends, amen. That that
[41:47] that curtain, if I could say it this way, was a was a dividing line, a demarcation between time
[41:53] and eternity. Amen. Amen. Just stay with me here because friends, Amen. On the one side was time,
[42:01] on the other side was eternity. Amen. We want to look at this. Amen. But watch this. See,
[42:06] on one side was the holy place. And my the holy place is a holy place. But think about it,
[42:12] friends. In that holy place. Amen. Oh, now watch this. I'm I'm just getting here. What was in that
[42:17] holy place? It was the manora. Amen. It was the table of showbread. Amen. It was the altar of
[42:23] incense. Right? But guess what, friends? If the priest didn't perform his duties,
[42:29] if the priest wasn't doing, Amen. their job, amen, over time, amen, that light in the manora would go
[42:35] out. If the priest didn't change the showbread, it would go stale. That's right. Amen. If the priest,
[42:44] amen, didn't uh what was the other thing there? Amen. Didn't attend to the altar of incense,
[42:48] that al that that waft of incense would go out. It depended on man, right? Amen. That's that's
[42:58] a type of time, friends. And and what does the manora represent? The seven church ages,
[43:03] which is time. The gentile dispensation two the last 2,000 years are typed out in the seven church
[43:11] ages, right? Amen. the seven the the seven golden candlestick. Right? So on one side is time. Amen.
[43:17] The light amen if it went unattended would go out in the manora. The showbread would go stale. It
[43:23] would go dry. It would get get stale and and untasteful and and and that incense would stop
[43:29] going if the if the priest didn't attend to it. Are you with me? But on the other side, friends,
[43:34] on the other side of that curtain, Amen. in that golden pot. Amen. That mana was just as fresh as
[43:40] it had ever been when it went into that pot. Friends, it didn't matter if it was Tuesday,
[43:44] if it was Thursday, if it was Saturday, it was still fresh. Friends, we can we can we can shout
[43:50] hallelujah. And we can say, "Amen." And we can be all excited in church, but what about tomorrow?
[43:55] What about Tuesday? What about Thursday? What about Saturday? What were you doing yesterday?
[44:01] Is it still as fresh? Or we feeding on some dead carrying like our brother said or some thing of
[44:06] the world. Oh my. Amen. Where the we want to get into the holiest of holies. Friends, we are not
[44:14] in Luther's age. Amen. Where we would just walk into the outer court. We are not in Luther in
[44:19] Wesley's age where we go. Amen. We are we are in the bride age. Even not in Pentecost, but in
[44:24] the bride age where we can go, Amen. into that unending day. Hallelujah. Where it's eternity.
[44:30] It's time is no longer. Amen. Oh my. Don't get stuck in Leodysia, friends. No, sir. Leadyia is
[44:38] still in time. It's beyond the curtain of time. You say, "What do you mean? We're still in these
[44:43] time bound bodies." And I said, "Yes, I am, but I'm not." Depends what you're Which part of you
[44:50] me are you talking about? What part of me are you talking about? This thing? Yeah, it's in time.
[44:55] It's getting older. It's getting tired. It gets sick. It has body aches now. Amen. But my soul
[45:02] That's a different story. Hallelujah. If you're born of God, friends, this morning,
[45:07] if you're born by the spirit of God, friends, your soul has already entered into the eighth day. How
[45:13] many you know that the eighth day, friends, is eternity. Hallelujah. Amen. You You come from Oh,
[45:19] thank you, Lord. Amen. You come from God. You come from eternity. And we dropped into this little dip
[45:25] in time. But guess what, friends? If you're connected to him, it's just going to pull up
[45:30] one of these days. Right back into that circle of eternity. Be connected. Amen. Hallelujah.
[45:38] Amen. Brother Brandham speaks of Amen. in the future home of of this idea that our soul has
[45:44] already entered in. Amen. To the eighth day. It's already entered into eternity. Amen. I'm
[45:50] actually looking at eternal beings this morning. Oh, you say, "But my hair is white and I'm getting
[45:55] tired and all these things." But in your soul, friends, is an eternal element that never began.
[46:04] Hallelujah. Amen. You know, brother Brown speaks about in the future home how, you know,
[46:08] um, after Jesus resurrection, seven Sabbaths pass, right? And then on the day after the seventh
[46:15] Sabbath, which was the 50th day, right, the holy convocation, what happened? The Holy Ghost fell.
[46:21] Yeah. Right. And let me say it this way. 120 souls that were in time, Amen. entered into an eternal
[46:29] realm. Friend, friend, if you've had your personal Pentecost, friends, you in your soul have entered
[46:36] into an eternal realm. You've passed into eternity in your soul. Oh, you maybe you're wondering where
[46:45] I'm going with this. Amen. But I I'm thankful, friends. Amen. When we think about that curtain
[46:49] of time and going beyond the curtain of time, we already had a prophet that told us what it's like.
[46:57] Amen. Beyond the curtain of time. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm thankful for that. That God
[47:03] allowed him to go beyond and come back and tell us what it's like. That's right. Now, watch this,
[47:09] friends. In the Old Testament, right, Aaron, the high priest could only enter in once. Once a year,
[47:15] year after year, once. But watch this. says Paul begins to speak about this in Hebrews chapter 9.
[47:20] He says, "Then verily the first covenant had also ordinance of divine service and
[47:24] a worldly sanctuary. For there was a tabernacle made, the first wherein was the candlestick and
[47:29] the table and the showbread which is called the sanctuary." We know that's the holy place. And
[47:32] after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called the holiest of all, the holiest of holies,
[47:38] which had the golden sensor, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein
[47:43] was the golden pot that had mana, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant,
[47:49] and over at the cherubams of glory, shadowing the mercy seat, of which we cannot now speak
[47:53] particularly. Verse six, now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into
[47:58] the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. So the priests went continually into that
[48:02] holy place to accomplish their service. Keep the manora light. Amen. Keep the showbread fresh. All
[48:08] these things. But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood,
[48:14] which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people. The Holy Ghost. This signifying that
[48:19] the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest. So they were foreshadowing. But that
[48:28] way was not yet meant yet yet made manifest yet because Jesus hadn't come which as the first time
[48:34] was yet standing. But watch this in verse 11. But Christ being come a high priest of good things to
[48:41] come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle. It was his body not made with hands. That is to say
[48:49] not of this building neither by the blood of goats and cows but by his own blood. Amen. Hallelujah.
[48:57] He entered in once. Just think friends, that high priest went in once a year. Amen. Year after year
[49:05] after year. But never once, friends did it change the desire of the worshipper. Never once did it
[49:11] change the nature of the of the worshipper. But Jesus went in once. Hallelujah. And when you come
[49:18] under that, friends, it changes your desire. It changes your nature. It changes your behavior.
[49:24] It changes your taste. Hallelujah. Friends, why? He went in with his own blood. Hallelujah. That
[49:32] blood of bulls and goats couldn't come back on the believer. Hallelujah. But he shed his own
[49:37] blood. Hallelujah. And then watch what Paul says here in verse 24. For Christ has not entered into
[49:42] the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the truth, but into heaven itself.
[49:48] Glory. He didn't only enter into tabernacles, what holy places made with hands, but he entered into
[49:56] heaven. Amen. Stay with me here. So, he didn't just stay in his physical tabernacle. The man,
[50:04] the flesh, the vessel, that was a tabernacle that God entered into, right? But he says now he went
[50:11] and entered into heaven. Heaven is eternal. That's the eternities, right? And so let me say it this
[50:18] way. Jesus, he went past hell. When he died, Amen. He went to hell, right? But guess what?
[50:26] Hell is an element of time. He went past that. He went and and after he knocked on hell's door,
[50:32] right? You know, I love that story. I believe when he knocked on the door, right? Let me just tell it
[50:37] a little bit cuz I like to tell the devil. Amen. What happened when our savior knocked on his door
[50:42] and Satan began to say, "Aha, I finally got you. I thought I had you when I killed Abel. I thought I
[50:48] had you when I killed Sosa. I thought I had you. And now, Amen. Here I hear you stand before me.
[50:53] I finally got you. Amen. Jesus said, "My blood is still fresh on the cross of Calvary." Hallelujah.
[50:59] And he reached over and took the keys of death, hell, and the grave from Satan's wasted and kicked
[51:04] him back into hell and shut the door. Hallelujah. Amen. The prophet of God would say in one place he
[51:11] shut the door so so hard. Amen. The shut shook in hell. Woo. Amen. That's our God. Amen. That's why,
[51:19] friends, when he came up and and friends, he went past hell, then he went to paradise. And
[51:23] what did he do? He knocked on that door. It was a different response, wasn't it? Hallelujah. When he
[51:29] got there, my Daniel said, "My, that's the one. That's the ancient of days." Abraham said, "No,
[51:33] that's the one I seen on the plains of Hammery. That's the one I had communion with." Hallelujah.
[51:39] There was a different response. He said, "Come on in." Hallelujah. He said, "Come on out.
[51:44] I'm emptying out paradise. Let's go. Paradise was a part of time. You realize, friends, paradise
[51:51] is no more. It's emptied out. He went past that. I'm saying he went past the veil of time. He went
[51:58] past hell. He went past paradise and he'd entered he went past the grave. He went past Jerusalem.
[52:06] After he entered paradise, right, he pulled them out and he said, "I got to do a whistle stop in
[52:11] Jerusalem. Pay a visit." Right? But he went past that and entered into heaven. Amen. Oh,
[52:18] hallelujah. And they begin to say, "Lift up your heads, oh ye gates." Why? The king of
[52:23] glory enters in. They said, "Who is this king of glory?" Oh, they said, "He's the king of glory.
[52:29] Mighty in battle." Hallelujah. Strong and mighty. Oh, hallelujah. That's our God this morning. He's
[52:38] still mighty in battle. Hallelujah. You're going through something this morning. He's He's mighty
[52:43] in battle. Hallelujah. Take the sword of faith, the sword of Amen. the sword of the spirit,
[52:48] rather, and put it to the heart of the enemy this morning. Hallelujah. Put your put the word on your
[52:53] lips. Hallelujah. Matthew 27, watch this. says, "Now Jesus on the cross, what happened actually
[52:59] when when he was on the cross there in verse 50, Jesus when he had cried again with a loud
[53:03] voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from the top to
[53:10] the bottom and the earth did quake and the vart rocks rent." Amen. How many know brother Brandon
[53:15] would speak about this in the unveiled God, the mighty God unveiled. Amen. When that veil broke,
[53:20] friends, they thought, the Jews thought their god, amen, was behind that veil still.
[53:26] But it they re they if they would have realized Amen. That's why I like this picture is that when
[53:31] the veil dropped it revealed that Amen. God was actually in flesh. Amen. And it died for
[53:37] their sins. It was God. Amen. Using a veil not of curtain, not of fine twine linen, but of earthly
[53:43] flesh. And now he's using yours. Amen. That badger skin. He's veiled behind that. Amen. I'm looking
[53:54] at him actually. Amen. I could if I could just look beyond the curtain of time. Amen. Are you
[54:00] with me? That's actually my point this morning. If we can look beyond the curtain of time, we'll
[54:05] see something. If God will say, let us to look beyond the curtain of time, we'll see something,
[54:10] friends. We'll see. Amen. That we were there. I'm getting way ahead of myself. Amen. Let me just let
[54:18] me just slow down here for a bit. You know, I I was studying back home, you know, for for tonight
[54:22] about, you know, about the all social media and things like that, friends. Amen. They're it's all
[54:26] about short videos, right? Reals and Tik Tok and this and that. You know why, friends? Amen. The
[54:32] devil has so anointed that. Amen. To take our attention span away. True. I began to think I
[54:39] ought to just give my punchline for the service right at the beginning. Cuz by the time I try to
[54:44] get it at the end, people have fallen asleep and they kind of have no attention and they they're
[54:48] just checked out already. Not the bride of Christ, right? Watch this. Brother Brandon says in the
[54:54] resurrection of Jesus Christ, he says, "I think of him when he had risen from the dead that morning
[54:59] that he was then had his own blood as a high priest and he went beyond the veils." Now watch
[55:06] this. I like how he says this. He went beyond the veils. Now he made it plural. Now watch this.
[55:11] through every sphere. Satan in times past had men blocked off from heaven. If I could say it
[55:19] this way, stuck in time. How? By sin, right? By eating off of that tree of knowledge of good and
[55:26] evil. It's it got us stuck. Adam and Eve were in eternity, right? They were they would never have
[55:33] died until they took that bite as it were. We know what it was, but you know what I'm saying,
[55:37] right? Amen. from that knowledge of good and evil. And they entered into time. Death entered into the
[55:43] human race. And they began to die. The day you eat thereof, the day you die, right? Amen. Time
[55:49] began there. But watch this. Amen. He could not get in contact with heaven. Amen. But then Jesus,
[55:55] when Jesus took his blood, the first veil he rent was the veil of death and the veil of the grave,
[56:03] the veil of the temple, then the veil of sickness. veils. He went past the veils. The veil of death,
[56:11] the veil of the grave, the veil in the temple, the veil of sickness, the veil of fear, and every veil
[56:18] that there was. Hallelujah. What veil are you? Amen. Hidden behind. What's hiding God from you
[56:23] this morning? Depression. Amen. Lust, pornography. He went past that. Amen. And unveiled God to man.
[56:33] Hallelujah. What is death anyways? Amen. It's an element of time. What's the grave? An element of
[56:40] time. This temple, sickness, weariness, fear, depression, suicidal thoughts. What are those?
[56:50] Those are elements of time. Jesus went beyond that. Hallelujah. And unveiled God to man. My
[57:00] which God? The eternal God. The God that had no beginning, no ending. Hallelujah. No father,
[57:07] no mother. Amen. God is not bound by time. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So friends,
[57:14] that situation you're dealing with. That besetting sin that you just can't get over,
[57:20] that's been passed down from your grandfather to your father to you. Amen. Is an element of time.
[57:26] It cannot go on. Hallelujah. the but the real you that I'm talking to. Amen. This morning, friends,
[57:34] am I talking to sons and daughters of God this morning? Hallelujah. Born of the spirit, friends,
[57:38] that you had no beginning. Oh, I wish we could see beyond the curtain of time this morning. The
[57:44] reason why Amen. Sometimes we struggle is the our our veil of time. It's this old thing, friends,
[57:50] that we got so focused on. But but brother, you don't know. Amen. What I struggle with. I I don't,
[57:56] but God does. And I say friends, this word either has power in it or doesn't. I happen to believe it
[58:03] all is all power. Power defeat any amen situation, any trial, any any sickness, any any depression,
[58:11] any oppression, whatever it might be. Friends, the power in this word, Amen. can defeat Amen. It
[58:17] will defeat Satan every time, any place, under any circumstance. Hallelujah. I'm thankful, man. Jesus
[58:26] Christ when he was tempted by by by Satan there on the on the back side of the desert friends. He
[58:30] didn't call 10,000 angels. He didn't do something supernatural. What? He became like the weakest
[58:36] Christian. That's right. Tired, weary. Amen. No one around him. Alone. I'm all alone. Nobody
[58:43] loves me. Jesus became like that. His disciples weren't there. Afterwards, the angels come and
[58:50] minister to him. Are you with me? Hallelujah. So, we think, "Oh, I'm so weak. Oh, nobody loves me.
[58:55] Nobody cares about me in in the church. Nobody has reached out to me. I'm going through things. Amen.
[58:59] God Amen. Jesus became just like you to show you friends that if you'll just take the word
[59:08] oh my.
[59:11] I'm sure you talk to people friends that are just because we live in this world of victimhood. Oh,
[59:18] woe is me. Woe is me. I'm going through it. I'm just Everybody's going through it. That's right.
[59:24] That's right. Everybody's going through things. Some just show it more than others, but we're all
[59:30] going through things. Stop being a victim. That's right. You're be a victor. You got to choose. You
[59:38] have to choose this morning. Am I going to stay a victim or am I going to be a victor? I'm going
[59:43] to be a victor. Victory in Jesus. He gave me the victory. He already conquered death, hell,
[59:49] and the grave. He con He went through every veil already. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's look past our
[59:56] current stress and our current trouble, friends. Amen. The Bible says, "Heavens and earth will pass
[1:00:00] away, but my word will never pass away." My word, my word, I'm talking about the living word. I'm
[1:00:10] looking at the word. Are you with me? Amen. That your that word I'm talking about the real you.
[1:00:16] Amen. That deposit, that eternal deposit that God put in you will never pass away.
[1:00:22] It cannot. Oh, for we've crossing the river veil. We've crossed the Riven veil. We're
[1:00:27] on the other side now. On the other side. And you'll see if you'll just do that. Break those
[1:00:32] old traditions and things. My We got to do that. Amen. And come to him, you'll see him standing.
[1:00:38] The mighty conqueror, the word of promise for this age made manifest. You'll see the mighty
[1:00:42] God unveiled. See him right here among us here. Unveiled. The mighty God unconquered by tradition.
[1:00:50] Oh, how many know there's veils of traditions that keep us? Oh, let us go beyond that, friends. We're
[1:00:59] we're invited to go beyond every veil and see the mighty God unveiled. If we could just look beyond
[1:01:06] the curtain of time, friends, you see, Amen. Behind the curtain of the holiest of holies,
[1:01:10] friends, the matter never went stale. Like I said, amen. The pillar of fire light,
[1:01:14] that shakina light never went out. Amen. And what happens? What happens to the individual
[1:01:20] that goes beyond that veil? Time stands still, right? Amy, you just enter into a realm where
[1:01:27] time don't matter anymore. Anybody know what I'm talking about this morning? Brother Bram
[1:01:33] says in planting the vine, but you know, as we get over into that other realm where time is no more,
[1:01:38] we begin to forget about time. Amen. Don't worry, I'm not setting you up for a three-hour sermon.
[1:01:50] Maybe. No promises. No, I'm just I'm I'm not I'm not that way. But how many know what's like,
[1:01:55] you know, and you maybe sing it here. I know what it's like to be in the presence of the
[1:02:02] Lord and not know what time it is. Why? Because time stood still. Where are you at? Amen. Oh my,
[1:02:12] you're behind the veil. You're somewhere. Amen. That that that that nothing matters. Oh my jaw,
[1:02:20] that don't matter no more. My lost love, that don't matter no more. Oh,
[1:02:24] that ailment in my leg. What? That don't matter no more. Oh, how many want to get there? How many
[1:02:30] want to live there? Friends, that high priest could go in, right? But they went out. We can
[1:02:36] go in and stay in. And stay in. Amen. Shikina unending is all I long for. Oh, it all blends into
[1:02:48] eternity. And there's not time. No time no more. There's no time limit. I don't know about you,
[1:02:55] friends, but I I I get bound up in time. I let time dictate my worship. I let time dictate
[1:03:02] my devotion. Just me then. I let time dictate my prayer life. Oh my I I got to get to work.
[1:03:13] Oh, that's why the Bible says redeeming the time. What has to happen? I'm preaching to
[1:03:19] myself. We got to cut time somewhere else to make time. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother B said he'll take
[1:03:27] whatever you give him. He wants 100%. He wants to have preeminences, right? Amen. in your vessel. He
[1:03:34] wants to fill every fiber, but he'll take he'll take a fiber if you'll give it to him. So, he'll
[1:03:39] take those two minutes you give him. But why don't you give him more? He wants more. He'll take it.
[1:03:44] Say, "Thank you." Amen. Oh, I'm saying things that I don't even thought I would say. Thank you, Lord.
[1:03:53] You remember the time brother Brown was praying for Georgie Carter? You know, remember he seen
[1:03:59] that vision, I believe, and he heard that that that almost like a lamb, Miltown, Miltown. So,
[1:04:05] he goes to Miltown. He doesn't even know who he's there for, right? So, he goes finds the church,
[1:04:09] you know the story, right? Starts holding revival meetings there. Well, one day he I believe he just
[1:04:14] felt so burdened on his heart to pray, right? And so he he was with the rights, I believe,
[1:04:19] and he said, "You know what? I'm going to go into the woods and I'm going to have some time
[1:04:22] for prayer, right?" And they said, "Yeah, sure. We're getting dinner ready. when dinner's ready,
[1:04:26] we'll ring the bell. Right. And he got into the woods there and he knelt down and oh,
[1:04:31] the briars just poke it. I couldn't get comfort. Oh, that man, that's hard ground. And you know,
[1:04:38] and just all sorts of things, right? Isn't that the way it is, right? You just say,
[1:04:42] "I'm going to I'm going to listen to like what that brother said. The preacher said on Sunday,
[1:04:47] they said to make more time for the Lord, I'm just going to make time for and all of a sudden
[1:04:55] Whatever whatever your your phone set does, right?
[1:05:02] The neighbor's dog starts barking. Your kids start yelling. What is it? It's that old devil. He
[1:05:10] knows. He wants you to pre he knows you're wanting to press in. So he That's our adversary. It's like
[1:05:16] that sister said, right? You got anything? You always have good things to say. Don't do you
[1:05:20] have anything good to say about the devil? He's sure a good adversary. But you, that's the way,
[1:05:25] right? We get down to pray. We get down to do devotion. I'm just going to set aside this 20
[1:05:29] minutes, 30 minutes, an hour, whatever. And all of a sudden, everything crops up. Business calls,
[1:05:35] work calls, wife calls, children call. Amen. Whatever. Amen. The phone's just going like crazy.
[1:05:41] Facebook is just giving you notifications like crazy. Instagram and whatever. Oh my. It's the
[1:05:50] devil. Yeah. What do you do? What are you going to do? Oh, well, I just put on another time. No,
[1:05:55] it's time to press in deeper. Take me deeper, Lord. Hallelujah. Oh, watch this, Brother Brown.
[1:06:02] I'm just continuing on this illustration. He says, "I just couldn't get comfortable. The rocks I went
[1:06:06] around the side of the hill and it was leaning too much. The slope was too much. And you know,
[1:06:11] the devil just trying to keep you from getting the blessing." That's all it was. Then I climbed
[1:06:16] up a little further into the thick and I knelt down. The mosquitoes was just humming around on
[1:06:20] my ears and I couldn't hardly pray. The briars, the ground, it's too sloped. The mosquitoes,
[1:06:28] my what's going to what is he going to do? And I believe then it was the devil. So I said,
[1:06:33] "Oh Lord God, be merciful." And I just threw up my hands and start praying. Anyhow,
[1:06:39] there it is. Hallelujah. Amen. We sing a song back home. So, I'll just throw up my hands and
[1:06:46] start praising the Lord. Anybody know that song? I won't give up cuz I stand on his infallible word.
[1:06:55] When God sees my hands raised, he comes down and inhabits my praise. We got a dynamite plan. Satan
[1:07:03] just can't stand when I throw up my hands. Let me read you some of the verses there. It says,
[1:07:09] "When everything has gone wrong, I got my back to the wall. Satan's coming on strong. He really
[1:07:15] wants me to fall. He sends trouble my way. Even sickness is part of his plan. By myself, I can't
[1:07:21] win. So, I'll just throw up my hands. Amen. You realize, friends? Amen. This is the universal
[1:07:28] sign of surrender. But it's also the universal sign of victory. Amen. So, when you surrender,
[1:07:36] you'll be victorious. Hallelujah. And then the second verse is when I'm faced with a trial,
[1:07:42] I've got two ways I can go. I can still wear a smile or let me let me let him bring me down low.
[1:07:50] Satan whispers, "You're through." But I hear Jesus tell me to stand. What am I going to do? I think
[1:07:56] I'll throw up my hands. Hallelujah. That's what we ought to do, friends. Or when you're feeling down
[1:08:02] and, "Oh, I I can't even pray. I don't even feel like a Christian." Just throw up your hands. Say,
[1:08:07] "Lord, be merciful. I'm just going to pray anyhow. I'm just going to praise you anyhow. He's worthy.
[1:08:13] Amen. Whether we feel good, whether if you feel like a Christian, whe he's worthy still. Oh,
[1:08:19] that's what he comes down. Oh, we're waiting. Oh, when he comes down, I'll praise him. No,
[1:08:24] no, no. You got it all different. Amen. When we praise him, he comes down. Hallelujah.
[1:08:30] Watch what Brother Brown did. I just threw up my hand, started praying anyhow. And just let
[1:08:33] the mosquitoes fill up if they wish to. Amen. Man, we know what mosquitoes are all about. Amen. But
[1:08:39] there was something that was burdening in my heart. And after I become so lost in prayer,
[1:08:46] I guess you Christians know what it means. To be lost in prayer, just forget where you are. That's
[1:08:53] praying in the spirit, I believe. And I opened my eyes and just the side of a little dogwood bush,
[1:08:58] there was that light hanging there and it shining down to where I was said, "Rise and go by the way
[1:09:03] of Carters. There his answer come." Hallelujah. Well, then I looked around. It was almost dark.
[1:09:09] The bell had been ringing and they had search parties out for me. What happened? He passed
[1:09:13] beyond the curtain of time. Can I say it that way? He passed beyond the curtain of time where
[1:09:19] time didn't matter no more. He got so lost in the spirit, he didn't hear the bell ringing. He didn't
[1:09:24] notice, Amen, the mosquitoes anymore. He didn't notice the ground no more. He didn't notice that
[1:09:28] it was getting dark. He didn't notice that it was past supper time. No Lord, help us. Amen. And how
[1:09:37] many know that you know when brother Brandham actually went beyond the curtain of time now,
[1:09:41] right? What was he doing? He was laying on his bed, right? I mean, thinking about the other side,
[1:09:47] right? And he began to hear the voice saying, "Press the battle. Press the battle. Keep going.
[1:09:52] Keep going." And that same voice. Amen. Let me I quit. Keep pressing the battle. Keep pressing the
[1:09:58] battle. You might feel like you want to give up. Keep going. Amen. Amen. And they begin to
[1:10:04] hear this familiar song. I'm homesick and blue and I want to see Jesus. I would like to hear
[1:10:09] those harbor bells ring chime. It would brighten my path and banish all fears. Lord, let me look
[1:10:14] past the curtain of time. And then the voice said, "Would you like to see past the curtain of time?"
[1:10:22] You know what brother Brandon said, right? Oh, it would help me so much. Amen. I I wonder this
[1:10:29] morning if I would ask you, would you like to see past the curtain of time? I think we would say,
[1:10:33] "Oh, it would help me so much cuz why we we just see all the negativity. We see all the trouble.
[1:10:41] We see all the politics in the message. We see the falling away. We Lord, let me put let me look past
[1:10:46] the curtain of time." Amen. Hallelujah. All of a sudden, you become translated, right? Amen. You
[1:10:58] know, you know what he's seen, right? My He's seen that great throng of of of saints. God. Amen. Who
[1:11:05] are these Brandhams? No, they're your converts. I happen to believe I was there. How about you? Oh,
[1:11:14] our precious brother. Oh, our precious brother. And he begins to say this. He he he realized he
[1:11:21] was young again. And he was looking back at his body, that 50ome, whatever year old body
[1:11:25] laying on the bed there with his hand behind his head. And he says, "As I begin to try to
[1:11:29] comprehend the place where I was, I began to realize that there was no yesterday and no
[1:11:35] tomorrow there." In other words, no time. I really like this part, too. No one seemed to be tired.
[1:11:47] Wouldn't you like to go beyond the curtain of time? Hallelujah. What a place. Oh,
[1:11:52] those multitudes of people all young. Oh, brothers and sisters, sisters, long hair, long skirts,
[1:11:59] clean, holy. Oh, thank you, Lord. Amen. Sisters hugging him. No physical feeling. Nothing like
[1:12:09] we would in these bodies. My just purity. What was it? Perfect love. The voice said, "This is
[1:12:17] what you preach was or is the Holy Ghost." That means friends that I can get a taste of that on
[1:12:24] this side. That's true. Is that is that is that true? This is perfect love and nothing can enter
[1:12:32] here without it. Hallelujah. So, how can we say amen that we're going there and hate our brother?
[1:12:40] How can we say we're going there and cut down our sister? Only perfect love will enter there. So,
[1:12:47] friends, add to your faith virtue. and to virtue, knowledge, and to knowledge, temperance. Oh,
[1:12:54] I I have all the knowledge. I understand the mysteries. I I I can totally quote you the seven
[1:12:59] seal book, seven trumpets. Add to your knowledge. It's not that knowledge anyhow. It's not earthly
[1:13:08] knowledge. Knowledge puffth up. Oh, yeah. Oh, I've heard that before. Puffed up. Amen. Add. Add. Add.
[1:13:18] He wants us, friends, to come to the stature of a perfect man. Aren't you thankful, friends? We're
[1:13:22] not living in Ephesus. That's right. We're living right at the top where the headstone,
[1:13:28] friends, is supposed to come down and cap off your life. Hallelujah. I'm thankful it comes down,
[1:13:35] friends. Not judgment, judgment, judgment. No. Grace, grace, grace. Amen. Hallelujah. I am more
[1:13:45] convinced than ever in my life that it'll take perfect love to enter that place. There was no
[1:13:49] jealousy, no tiredness. Hallelujah. No sickness, no old age, no death, only supreme beauty and joy.
[1:13:57] Whatever you do, lay aside everything else until you get perfect love. Oh, I want that. I want
[1:14:04] that. How do I do it? Lay aside everything else. Oh, empty out, friends. Hallelujah. But you need
[1:14:12] to realize that even before God allowed him to be go beyond the curtain of time,
[1:14:16] he was he was already talking about it, you know, and I I was looking at this, you know, the first
[1:14:22] time if you search in the message that he begins to speak about going beyond the curtain of time,
[1:14:28] it's actually in the message looking to the unseen. And watch this. And I'm thankful,
[1:14:35] friends. Amen. It takes a special vision to look to the unseen, right? Amen. The people that that c
[1:14:42] can just look at this word, friends, and my they just they can just read it. But thank God for a
[1:14:47] prophetic eye. Hallelujah. An eagle eye, an eagle anointing. Amen. To see to the unseen. To see that
[1:14:54] Abraham and Sarah had a body change. Who else sees that? All the all the all the children's books.
[1:15:04] We had a baby. No, they were 20. Let's go to the doctor. Sarah, we're having a baby. They
[1:15:12] were young. They had a body change. We couldn't see that without a prophet. Watch this here. Oh,
[1:15:20] in looking to the unseen. Oh, what I would think tonight, Lord, let us look past the curtain of
[1:15:26] time. Just look over just just a little peek and see what it's all about. How many would like to
[1:15:33] look past the curtain of time and see what it's all about? What it's all about. Amen. God has
[1:15:39] given us a vision. It's like, you know, it's like the illustration of, you know, brother Brown would
[1:15:43] talk about the circus, you know. Amen. And the and the little boys that couldn't have
[1:15:47] enough money to maybe get in, right? They would climb up and the tallest one or the strongest one
[1:15:52] would get up on the fence, right? Amen. And peek over, find a knot hole and look through and oh,
[1:15:56] they could see and their friends are down there and say, "Oh, oh, there's a lion. It
[1:16:02] the lion the trainer's in the cage now with the lion. Oh, I want to see. I want to see." Right?
[1:16:07] But that one could see. He look over there. Oh, there's elephants. Oh, the they're doing this.
[1:16:11] They're doing that. I want to see. I want to see. Watch this. He says, "That's the cry of the human
[1:16:18] heart has always been since we know that there is a God. Every mortal has tried to look past
[1:16:23] the curtain of time to find out if they could see where they come from. What's their business here,
[1:16:30] and where they'll be after they leave here?" Amen. See, so if you can see past the curtain of time,
[1:16:36] friends, you'll see where you come from. Hallelujah. You'll see what your business is here.
[1:16:44] You realize, friends, that many times, amen, the world will say, you know, it's all about finding
[1:16:48] your purpose, right? What? Finding yourself. Well, this is the way to find yourself. And you'll begin
[1:16:55] to see that you're actually identified in the word and that actually his identity is your identity.
[1:17:02] Amen. Glory. Amen. You'll see where you're going. That you could say like Jesus, I come from God.
[1:17:11] I go back to God. I'm just going back where I came from. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Watch this.
[1:17:18] Notice. Amen. Brother Brandham actually wasn't the first to go past the curtain of time. Follow me
[1:17:24] here. In the resurrected Lord Jesus, every man is trying to look past the curtain of time. You know,
[1:17:29] you come from somewhere. You're going somewhere. So it takes a little peak of past the curtain
[1:17:34] time. Moses wanted to see it. God let him see it so we can see it also. Amen. So Moses seen
[1:17:44] past the curtain of time. How else could he write the five first five books of the Bible? He wasn't
[1:17:50] there physically when God said, "Let there be." And there was. He wasn't there. How would he know
[1:17:58] what God created on day three and day four and day five? God let him look past the curtain of time.
[1:18:07] How else did he know friends that Abraham and Sarah and then met Melzdc and had communion? How
[1:18:12] else would Moses know that was way before Moses? God let him see past the curtain of time to see
[1:18:20] Melzdc, to see Abraham, to see Joseph, all these things, right? Hallelujah. Yes. He lived through
[1:18:26] the Exodus. Yes. Amen. He lived through the the making of the tabernacle. Amen. But how did he
[1:18:31] know what Moses and what Noah preached? How did he know how many animals were in the ark? Yeah. God
[1:18:36] let him look past the curtain of time. Hallelujah. What about Daniel? How could Daniel Amen describe
[1:18:42] the ancient of days? How could Daniel describe all the Gentile dispensations that were coming? The
[1:18:48] Babylonians, the Mes and Persians, the Grecians, the Romans. How would he know that? I mean, God
[1:18:53] let him see past the curtain of time. What about Job? Maybe there's a Job here this morning. Oh,
[1:19:01] it was in his darkest hour. And God had allowed him to lose everything. You know the story. And
[1:19:07] he had let those three miserable comforters come and discourage Job even more. Amen. But then God,
[1:19:14] oh, he knew his son was there on that ash sheep scraping his boils, friends. Amen. So he sent
[1:19:18] him he sent him a representative. Hallelujah. Thank God for technology. Amen. He sent him a
[1:19:27] representative. Elhu, brother said he was Christ's representative. He was a foreshadowing of Jesus
[1:19:33] Christ. And what did Elhu do? Amen. Prophet of God would talk about he began to change Job's focus.
[1:19:44] Oh Lord, I help me here. Amen. Amen. And but in that time, friends, Amen. I can imagine God,
[1:19:51] let me just dramatize it this way, saying to Job as he's in his deepest,
[1:19:56] darkest trial on his ash heap, scraping those boils. Everybody's turned against him. Everyone
[1:20:01] thinks he's a secret sinner. His wife says, "Why don't you just curse God and die?" Can you imagine
[1:20:06] being in that kind of a condition? God sends Elue. And I can just imagine God saying, "Job,
[1:20:13] would you like to look past the curtain of time? that would help me so much. Just dramatizing.
[1:20:22] Watch this. Job began to see it. Being a prophet, he began to listen to this little prophet,
[1:20:27] Elihoo. And the first thing you know, Job raised up. God put his binoculars down over his eyes.
[1:20:34] And he looked way down 4,000 years. And he said, "I know my redeemer liveth. And at the last days,
[1:20:42] he'll stand on the earth. Though the skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh
[1:20:46] shall I see God whom I shall see for myself. Mine eyes shall behold and not another. Yes,
[1:20:50] he saw the resurrection of Christ. He said, "My eyes shall beholden not another." He seen Jesus.
[1:20:58] Job in his deepest trial, God. Amen. Let him see past the curtain of time. Amen. To see, Amen.
[1:21:05] Jesus Christ, his redeemer. Oh, he said, I know my redeemer liveth. It's just not an imagination. I'm
[1:21:14] not just making this up. It's not just a good feeling. Amen. On a Sunday morning, friends,
[1:21:18] but I see Jesus. I see my redeemer. Looking past the curtain of time, friends. What a vision. Lord,
[1:21:25] you help us look beyond the curtain of time. Hallelujah. You'd help us so much. Glory.
[1:21:36] Now, let's bring it to our day because we we love to look back, right? And it's good to look back.
[1:21:43] It's good to learn from our predecessors and look in the word. But really, what matters to us is
[1:21:48] today. Is that right? Now, watch this. And and this is so familiar to you. Amen. In Revelation
[1:21:55] chapter 10, the Bible says, "I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[1:22:00] and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was at as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of
[1:22:05] fire. And he had in his hand a little book open." Aren't you thankful for that? In Revelations 5,
[1:22:12] it was closed. But in Revelations 10, it's open. And he set his right foot upon the sea and his
[1:22:19] left foot on the earth. I I was reading that last night. I was thinking, Lord, you know,
[1:22:25] there's many types, okay? I'm not putting a period to anything. Amen. But to me, Amen.
[1:22:31] One of these things is he was claiming ownership. You know, when brother Brown would say, you know,
[1:22:35] even in the Old Testament when Israel went into the land, footsteps means possession. And here
[1:22:41] the mighty angel comes and sets one foot on the earth and one foot on the sea. And he begins,
[1:22:47] Amen. And how many know that we witness this in this day? Yeah, we did. This is not a future
[1:22:53] tense. This already happened. Hallelujah. He's come down. The word, Amen, come down. Verse 5. And
[1:22:59] the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and swear
[1:23:04] by him that liveth forever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that are there in are, and
[1:23:08] the earth, and the things that are there in our, and the sea, and the things which are therein,
[1:23:12] that there should be time no longer. See, time no longer, eternity. when when the little book
[1:23:21] is open. Now you're saying, "But we're still in time." Yes, we are. But no, we're not. I'm talking
[1:23:28] about in your soul. Can you differentiate that? Don't think I'm preaching some weird doctrine this
[1:23:34] morning. Amen. There. What happened when the book was open, friends? Amen. The opening of the word,
[1:23:40] it it gave us an entrance into an eternal realm that we had never seen before. That's right.
[1:23:49] Watch this. I I love this. In the breach, brother Brown begins and this is before,
[1:23:53] right? It was God hidden simplicity, right? God hides himself in simplicity and reveals himself
[1:23:59] in the same. Then he comes, Amen. and preaches the breach between the church ages and the seven
[1:24:04] seals. And watch what he begins to say. Now, with the lamb, with the book in his hands,
[1:24:08] we're ready to ask his grace and mercy upon us to open the seven seal book to us and let
[1:24:14] us look past the curtain of time just a little bit. Oh my. So, what does the opening of the
[1:24:21] seven seal book do for us? It lets us look past the curtain of time. So, I I want to preach
[1:24:28] from an open book then. Amen. I don't want to preach from a closed book. Amen. It's like this,
[1:24:33] friends. I've given this illustration before, but you know, I if if I were to read something that
[1:24:37] you're really familiar with. Let's let's say, let me just read this one cuz we all know this one.
[1:24:50] But what if I were to read like this because it's, you know, partially open. Peter and men and
[1:25:00] brethren repent in the name of Jesus. You shall ghost you and now if the book wasn't open like
[1:25:10] that's kind of weird like what's that gibberish like you all know why you you've read the whole
[1:25:18] thing. I'm just giving an illustration. You see what the denomination would I'm not putting them
[1:25:23] down at all but friends they're preaching from a closed book. They can probe. Yeah. Unable to
[1:25:28] walk and carry it. They can look at they can find snippets of it. But you know what? Some
[1:25:33] you know you know what's shameful for us though, friends? They can have more excitement sometimes
[1:25:37] than we do with 10% of the word. Shame on us. We got the whole thing. Thank you, Lord. Now,
[1:25:50] right, we talked about Moses looking past the current time, Job, Daniel,
[1:25:54] all these things. But look at John now. And who is John a type of? Who's a John in the in the book
[1:26:01] of Revelation? A type of us. The bride. Brother Bram said the church. Amen. No, I I take that as
[1:26:07] the bride. Amen. He's a type of the bride. Watch this. But the first thing that represented that
[1:26:12] redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world. And he took
[1:26:16] the book. Glory. Opened the book. And I would say glory and tore off the seals. Hallelujah.
[1:26:24] and sent it down to the earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people. There you are. Oh my.
[1:26:32] What happened? The screams, the shouts. Oh yeah. My when he sent it down to his seventh angel,
[1:26:41] you know, I I I can't bring it up here, but there's another quote, you know,
[1:26:44] I believe it's in this in the seals, one of the seals, I can't remember. And he's and he's
[1:26:48] preaching about this and and you know what's amazing is it's actually literally happening.
[1:26:53] God is literally opening the seals to his people. And you know how they put in parenthesis,
[1:27:00] you know, congregation says amen. You know what the parenthesis people congregation rejoices
[1:27:08] and he says oh in wonderful and it says congregation continues to rejoice. I
[1:27:15] thought my that's wonderful friends. There it was happening. Amen. In Revelation,
[1:27:20] John was rejoicing. The hallelujah, the shouts, the anointing, the Oh,
[1:27:27] there should be a reflection, right? Amen. There's got to be a reflection somewhere.
[1:27:32] Amen. Oh my. What happened? The screams, they shout. We're not trying to build it up, friends,
[1:27:37] but some something's going to be in you. Amen. That it's not a workup. It's like,
[1:27:42] Amen. You just can't help it, right? My dog at home can't help when someone knocks on the door.
[1:27:49] just can't. I was trying to train be quiet. Shut up. It's just in it. And friends, the world
[1:27:55] can say, "Shut up. Stop being so excited." Some critical believer comes in. Stop being so excited.
[1:28:00] And I can't help it. I seen my name on the book. Hallelujah. I can't help it. Don't let nobody
[1:28:09] shut your shouts up. Just make sure when you get down, you live, right? Oh, there's the balance,
[1:28:18] right? Amen. Just make sure when you just shout as high as you can, shout as loud as you can and live
[1:28:23] as hard as you can for the Lord when you get down. Hallelujah. The anointed, the power, the glory,
[1:28:28] the manifestation. And old John who had been standing there, our brother, crying, why? He said,
[1:28:33] everything in heaven, everything in the earth, everything in the sea heard me holler. Amen. My if
[1:28:39] if they all heard it, he must have shouted, right? and everything in the sea heard me holler. Amen. I
[1:28:49] believe in amens. Amen. Blessings, honor, might, power be to him that lives forever and ever. Talk
[1:28:59] about a happy time. When them seals broke, John must have looked in and seen a past the curtain
[1:29:05] of time. Amen. When them seals broke to John, he must have looked past the curtain of time.
[1:29:14] So when John seen past the curtain of time, Amen. What did he see? He seen himself.
[1:29:22] You ever think about that? When John, right? What a privilege John had. And you think about,
[1:29:28] but he's on the aisle of Patmas, scorpions, and he's all alone. He's with convicts. He's
[1:29:34] with a bunch of criminals, right? All alone. No pastor, no no no no brother, no deacon,
[1:29:39] no family, no no loved one, no no church. Amen. brothers and sisters to encourage. He's all alone,
[1:29:45] but God lets him enter into the day of the Lord's day. And what does he see? He gets transported,
[1:29:51] right? And he begins to see the throne room, right? And one sitting on the throne,
[1:29:58] right? Right. He see and he sees the four and 20 elders. He sees the four beasts. Are you
[1:30:04] with me? He begins to see that. But let me ask you friends, who were those four and 20 elders?
[1:30:10] They were the four the 12. Amen. patriarchs of the Old Testament and the twel apostles of the
[1:30:15] New. Is that right? Well, what was John? He was one of those apostles. So, he's seen himself.
[1:30:27] This should make you shout. He when he looked beyond the curtain of time, friends, he seen Oh,
[1:30:33] let me read it to you because brother Brown says here, he says, I love it. This is the best part.
[1:30:39] He said, "There's John." When the seals broke and he looked past the current of time, he said, "Oh,
[1:30:48] there's that's me. That's me." Amen. When the seals open, friends, and the book open to you,
[1:30:56] friends, I trust that's what you said. That's not David. That's not just Daniel.
[1:31:05] That's mama. Amen. You're you're playing around in your in your denominational house
[1:31:11] and grandma's house or whatever and all of a sudden you come across the mirror,
[1:31:15] right? And you moved and that boy moved. Mama, that's me. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:31:27] glory. What an experience that was, wasn't it? Amen. When you begin to see friends yourself,
[1:31:34] that is the greatest thing. Amen. Young people, old people, friends. Amen. It's got to be more
[1:31:39] than Amen. the best preacher in the message. Amen. Oh, they just preached wonderfully. Oh, I was so
[1:31:43] blessed by that. What about your experience? Amen. What What's God doing in your life? Oh,
[1:31:49] that didn't go over very well. Amen. We got to have our own personal experience. Hallelujah.
[1:31:56] Friends, when when John seen his own identity, when John seen himself, and when you see yourself,
[1:32:03] that's when you'll have a jumping shouting. Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. Blessing time. Amen. Because
[1:32:10] what did John realize? I made it. I can't miss it. Here I am on the aisle of Patmas, but I made it.
[1:32:22] But John, you're a prisoner. Don't you know you're getting old? You're gonna die. I made
[1:32:27] it. I can't miss it. Hallelujah. I'm already there. You know what's wonderful even about
[1:32:35] this this quote? It's in the breach. But look how brother Branham is saying here. He says,
[1:32:40] "Talk about a happy time when them seals broke in time." 1963. That day. Amen. The seals hadn't
[1:32:51] even broke yet in time. But beyond the curtain of time, there's no time. That's right. So,
[1:32:58] the seals had already been broke. When did God when was the lamb slain? Before the foundation
[1:33:06] of the world. Before there was even time. Amen. When were you saved? When were when
[1:33:13] were you a son of God? If you are a son or a daughter of God, let me say it this way.
[1:33:17] If you are a daughter of God this morning, you always were a daughter of God. You
[1:33:24] always will be a daughter of God. That's right. Hallelujah. So friends, if you can see yourself
[1:33:32] past the current of time, friends, you'll realize I am a child of God. I always was.
[1:33:41] You didn't become a child of God at the altar, friends. You just recognized that you're a
[1:33:45] child of God. You be you were born an eagle in your soul. Amen. That attribute in you friends
[1:33:54] is not some time element. It's eternal. Yes. Hallelujah. Let's go. Let's go on just a little
[1:34:00] longer if that's okay. Amen. You know, we're speaking about that tabernacle in the wilderness,
[1:34:06] right? And the and the and the high priest that could go in once a year, right? He would go in,
[1:34:10] he would come out, go in, come out, right? And as we already said, we can go in and stay in.
[1:34:15] But you know what's amazing about the tent vision? Can I just can I go over that just a little bit?
[1:34:22] Amen. The tent vision. Amen. Brother Brandon has this vision of a big tent, big cathedral. Depends
[1:34:26] how you when you where you read it, right? But in that tent, in that cathedral was a platform and on
[1:34:32] the platform was a little room, right? And people there was a prayer line and people would be going
[1:34:40] into that room. Amen. But let me type that. Amen. to where we want to go. Amen. Past the curtain of
[1:34:47] time. Amen. In that when they were going into that room, friends, they weren't going in and then just
[1:34:54] coming out as it were, right? They were going in and going through. Amen. So, there's a difference
[1:35:00] here. And so, that lady that come in, they were they wheeled her in on a stretcher into that room.
[1:35:06] She come out of it on the other side pushing the stretcher. Amen. And shouting, "Glory, hallelujah.
[1:35:13] Amen." the the the man went with his crutches into the room and he came out the other side
[1:35:19] carrying the crutches giving glory to God. Right? And it's it's amazing. Amen. They said, "Amen.
[1:35:25] What happened?" It's it's like they they would ask Aaron, "What happened?" You know what she said? I
[1:35:31] don't know, but I was paralyzed for 20 years. And now this is where it I feel like I was never sick.
[1:35:43] You caught that? Why? Amen. Her sickness was in time. But when she went beyond the
[1:35:49] curtain of time, I feel like I was never sick. Let me update. I never was a sinner,
[1:35:59] per se. Hallelujah. That was in time. Glory. That was in time. My complex was in time.
[1:36:08] Hallelujah. Glory. What did the voice say? I'll meet you there. This is that third pull. But it
[1:36:15] won't be a public show. What was the third pull? The opening of the word. What happened
[1:36:20] at the opening of the word? We went past the curtain of time. Yes. I I trust you see it.
[1:36:27] Hallelujah. Beyond the current of time, friends. Eternity. Guess who's not there? The devil.
[1:36:36] Hallelujah. You hear that, devil? cuz he's here. He's the most faithful church member. So, devil,
[1:36:45] guess what? Beyond the curtain of time. Sorry. You won't be there. That's why he don't like the
[1:36:54] book of Genesis or the book of Revelations. Why? It identifies and exposes who where his beginning
[1:36:59] was, who he is, how he deceives, and his end. I can read about my my beginning and my not end.
[1:37:08] I can read about my eternal destination. Let's read about the devil. That old devil,
[1:37:14] that old serpent will be cast into the lake of fire. You hear that? Why? He had a beginning. Then
[1:37:23] he has an end. Think about this as we just begin to close. Everything the devil is accusing you of,
[1:37:31] he is actually a prophesying of himself because he's a prophet. He's just a false prophet. He
[1:37:39] says, "You're not going to make it. You're not." But he's the one that's not going to
[1:37:45] make it. He keeps saying you don't have the Holy Ghost. He doesn't have the Holy Ghost. So stop
[1:37:53] listening to him. He keeps accusing you. You're this. You're That's what he is. You're going to
[1:37:59] hell. No. No. Satan. You're going to hell. That is the only person you can say that to. That's right.
[1:38:10] Oh, thank you, Lord. Amen. God has a sense of humor. Oh, thank you, Lord. Friends,
[1:38:17] when he takes his last breath in hell, we'll be s we'll be still singing amazing grace. When he
[1:38:26] takes his last breath, right? Because hell will be everlasting. Still a time element. It's not
[1:38:33] eternal. It's not. We don't believe in an eternal hell, right? You'd have to have eternal life to be
[1:38:37] an eternal hell. Hell is everlasting. When he takes his last breath and is no more,
[1:38:45] we'll be singing amazing grace. Whatever we'll be singing, glory, glory, hallelujah.
[1:39:00] Oh, hallelujah. Amen. Lord, give us a glimpse beyond the current of time. What else ain't there?
[1:39:08] Sickness, depression, oppression, pain, suffering. Those are all time elements. That means they won't
[1:39:16] be there. Let us look beyond the curtain of time. Friends, don't don't get caught up in the three
[1:39:21] curtains of time, right? So many people are, oh, China, Russia, those are curtains, right?
[1:39:27] The bamboo curtain, the iron curtain. Brother Brandham said, watch that purple curtain. That's
[1:39:33] the deceiver. But he also said, "You don't have to fear any of those." Why? We've been able to look
[1:39:40] past the curtain of time of time. This is actually the curtain, friends, I'm most interested in. Say,
[1:39:48] "Lord, let me look past the curtain of my time and realize there's something of eternal value
[1:39:54] here. Lord, give us a glimpse, Lord, this morning of our true identity beyond the curtain of time.
[1:40:03] I'm so glad, friends. Amen. Aren't you glad this morning? Let's stand together.
[1:40:19] I don't know if this would be appropriate, but um could my wife come and we'll we'll
[1:40:23] sing that song. I'll just throw up my hands if that's all right.
[1:40:30] Do you have a bass? No. Okay,
[1:40:33] that's okay. It can it be set up or it's not in tune? Okay, never mind.
[1:40:46] Let's pray. Let's pray.
[1:40:54] Dear Lord Jesus,
[1:40:58] thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Lord, we we just ask, oh God, that you'll just help us,
[1:41:05] Father, this morning. Sometimes we Lord, we do get like Job. Lord, I get like Job. And we just

[1:41:16] And they're real, Lord. I I I'm not minimizing them at all this morning, but Lord, give us a
[1:41:21] glimpse this morning, Lord, beyond that curtain of time, Lord, where we come from, where we had,
[1:41:27] Lord, where God began to ask Job, "Where were you? Where were you, Job?" Oh, when he got that vision,
[1:41:35] oh, I was there, Lord, when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for,
[1:41:42] I was there. Oh, there's Job. Oh, not only, oh, there's Jesus. Oh, Lord, let us look past, oh,
[1:41:52] past our trial, past our mistakes, past our failures, past everything that's in this time
[1:41:58] element, Lord, and realize, oh, there I am beyond the curtain of time. There I am. Oh,
[1:42:08] I can't miss it, Lord. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. There's somebody here this morning,
[1:42:14] Lord, that Lord has their eagle eyes filmed over. Lord, I pray God that the word of God,
[1:42:20] the spirit of God would just begin to put that sav, Lord, on their eagle eyes. May that Lord,
[1:42:25] may they begin to be anointed to get to that rock, Lord, that cleft of the rock, Lord, and begin to
[1:42:31] beat on it. And just, Lord, get that crust off of their eagle eyes, Lord, where they can see again
[1:42:36] and they can fly to the heavenlies again, Lord. Oh God, if there be one here this morning, Lord
[1:42:41] Jesus, in the valley of the shadow of death, Lord, may you be their light, Lord. Hallelujah. Lord,
[1:42:47] speak to them even this morning, Lord, encourage them, Lord. Lift them up, we pray. We thank you,
[1:42:53] Father. And Lord, just accept of our worship now as we water the word in Jesus Christ's name
[1:42:59] I pray. Amen. Hallelujah. So, I'll just throw up my hands and start praising the Lord. Oh,

[1:47:10] am I going to do?" What am I going to do? I think I'll throw up my hands. Oh, I think I'll throw out

[1:57:55] and he bought me with his redeeing blood. He loved me where I knew him and all my love is to him. He
[1:58:09] plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing blood. I heard about his healing of his cleansing power
[1:58:24] revealing. how he made the lame to walk again and cause the blind to cease. And then I cry,
[1:58:36] "Dear Jesus, come and spit." And somehow Jesus came and brought to you the victory.
[1:58:50] The victory in Jesus my savior forever. He sought me anybody with his redeeming blood.
[1:59:07] He loved me and I knew him and all my love is to him. He plunged me to victory beneath the
[1:59:21] cleansing flood. I heard about a mansion he has built for me in glory. And I heard about
[1:59:34] the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea. about the angels singing and the old redemption story
[1:59:48] and some sweet day I'll sing up there the song of victory. Oh victory in Jesus my savior forever.
[2:00:05] He sought me and he bought me with his redeeming love. He loved me and I knew him and all my love
[2:00:19] is to him. He punched me to victory beneath the cleansing flood. Are you happy this morning? our
[2:00:33] Lord Jesus. Wonderful. But only perfect love will get us there. Only perfect love. Lord,
[2:00:44] may we die to ourself and get that perfect love. Can we say amen? You love one another. Turn
