[15:09] [Music]
[15:17] It's part of our human nature to be uh
[15:20] impatient, I guess. And we want to see
[15:22] the Lord coming just one day. But it's
[15:25] already started. We've been seeing it.
[15:27] We see where the world is. We see what's
[15:30] coming to fruition from from prophecy
[15:33] and that's that's part of what's coming.
[15:34] We're seeing him come right now. Even
[15:36] though it's not today, this second, it's
[15:39] started long before we were here.
[15:46] They'll be shouting on the hills of
[15:49] [Music]
[15:59] coming when we reach the fallen
[16:06] no
[16:09] and the angels sound the trumpet

[18:57] Amen.
[19:02] [Music]
[19:08] &gt;&gt; As as much as we like to think that
[19:10] there's a we'll be shouting because uh
[19:13] we don't have a mortgage payment or we
[19:14] don't have to do laundry anymore.
[19:17] Those things are great. But we'll be
[19:19] shouting because we don't have to deal
[19:20] with this world anymore. We don't we
[19:22] don't have to deal with this flesh
[19:23] that's constantly against us. and and
[19:27] we'll get to see God face to face. Amen.
[19:30] Amen.
[19:31] [Music]
[19:37] Maybe if I can ask brother Joseph if he
[19:39] could come and just open in prayer. And
[19:41] there's a prayer request for uh brother
[19:43] Steven Dole. He was uh uh him and a
[19:46] couple other brothers from brother Eds
[19:48] were traveling. Uh it's
[19:51] road to the sun, I think, in Montana
[19:53] there. and he hit a patch of gravel and
[19:55] uh I think he almost went over a
[19:56] guardrail where he went over a guardrail
[19:58] and yeah, he's got some fractures and
[20:00] some things. So, he's I think he's still
[20:02] in the hospital as far as I know. So,
[20:04] but uh it's it could have easily uh been
[20:08] more than just a hospital. So, the Lord
[20:10] is already looking out for him just but
[20:12] we'll just pray for him and just for the
[20:14] service and just feel
[20:18] and then for those who couldn't make it,
[20:19] there's still a couple of ways. So,
[20:24] God bless you saints.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to be in the house of the
[20:27] Lord this morning. God bless you.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We had a good service last night
[20:32] and uh we are looking for more today.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; We we were told we had to identify
[20:38] ourselves. Now who are we?
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the uh Lord in prayer this
[20:46] morning.
[20:48] Dear heavenly father, we approach your
[20:51] throne of mercy and grace this morning.
[20:55] Your mercy
[20:57] prevails.
[20:59] Your grace keeps us going.
[21:02] We love you, Lord, for you first loved
[21:05] us.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; We bless bless your name this morning,
[21:09] Lord, knowing that without you there is
[21:12] no us. Lord,
[21:14] &gt;&gt; we know you are the groom and your bride
[21:16] is here this morning, Lord, yearning to
[21:20] hear more from you, Lord, this morning.
[21:24] Father God, this morning, Lord, we have
[21:26] you have gathered us, Lord. We have
[21:29] answered your call, Father.
[21:32] We are under expectation, Lord, to hear
[21:34] more of you this morning. We thank you
[21:38] for your love, God. For you have loved
[21:40] us and you have given us your name,
[21:44] Lord.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; We thank you for that. Father, as we are
[21:49] here this morning, Lord, we we come
[21:51] under burden, Lord. Different things
[21:54] conflicting in our minds, in our soul,
[21:58] taking us from to different parts, from
[22:00] different parts, Lord. But this morning,
[22:03] may may we be of one mind, one accord.
[22:06] May we be in one accord knowing that we
[22:09] the purpose of this meeting is to
[22:12] worship you. We praise your name this
[22:14] morning Lord.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; Father
[22:19] hear our prayers this morning. We have
[22:22] this prayer request for a brother Lord
[22:24] that is in critical condition. Lord
[22:27] Father you knew this was going to be
[22:29] brought before you this morning before
[22:32] we even heard of it.
[22:35] You know the end from the beginning,
[22:38] Lord.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; So we ask that may your will be done in
[22:42] our brother's life. May healing be done.
[22:45] May testimonies come forth, oh Lord. And
[22:48] may hearts be turned because of just
[22:52] this event, Lord. So we know you are
[22:55] God. Thank you, Lord. We praise your
[22:58] name this morning. May you be with uh
[23:01] this song service, Lord. my brother
[23:04] Andrew and uh the musicians. Lord, may
[23:07] your songs of Zion be sung in this
[23:09] house, Lord, to prepare the hearts of
[23:11] your children, Lord, so that when the
[23:15] word comes finally, Lord, it will find
[23:18] federal soil to grow on. Lord, we can't
[23:22] say much. We don't know much, but we
[23:25] know you are Lord. You are God. And just
[23:29] because of that Lord, we say thank you
[23:33] and we just leave everything in your
[23:36] hands Lord from beginning and end to the
[23:39] end of this service. Lord, may you take
[23:42] preeminence. May you take control. May
[23:44] you just be the guest of honor. Like my
[23:48] brother Matendo always says, may you be
[23:50] the guest of honor in this service.
[23:52] Lord, we thank you, Lord. We bless your
[23:56] name again. May your will be done. And
[24:00] may your people be healed. May your may
[24:03] those empty coffers be filled. May you
[24:06] supply every need of every person in
[24:09] this house. Oh Lord, may we go back to
[24:12] our places just marveling Lord,
[24:16] rejoicing, celebrating that wasn't here

[39:30] And you said, "Blessed are those who
[39:32] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[39:35] &gt;&gt; because they shall be filled."
[39:38] Come by one more time, Lord.
[39:41] Fill us, oh God. We lift our cup unto
[39:45] you. Please fill it.
[39:48] Fill it, oh God.
[39:51] accept the offerings of our lips and
[39:54] that of our pauses.
[39:56] Everything that we have given even of
[39:58] our person Lord Jesus may they be
[40:02] accepted in your sight. Come by Lord
[40:05] Jesus move through the audience of your
[40:08] people
[40:10] from the altar to the pew but please
[40:13] don't pass no one by.
[40:16] Reach out to that heart this morning
[40:19] that is longing for you. Reach out to
[40:22] that heart this morning that has a need,
[40:27] Lord, the substance of their request and
[40:29] their desire. May you release unto thy
[40:33] people. Fill them, oh God. Let there be
[40:36] baptism upon baptism because you said
[40:39] the words that I speak unto you, they
[40:41] are life and they are spirit. And we
[40:44] know Lord Jesus that if the truth
[40:46] proceeded forth out of here, it's a
[40:49] baptism. Oh God, fill your vessels one
[40:52] more time. Lord, we want to ask your
[40:55] blessings upon the pastor and all the
[40:58] ministries that are associated here. We
[41:01] want to pray for their families that you
[41:03] will help them. You will bless them. You
[41:06] will fight their battles. You will meet
[41:07] their needs. You will continue to raise
[41:10] the hands of the ministries.
[41:13] Bless every family represented in here.
[41:16] Visit them as individuals.
[41:19] Visit them as a family. Settle them.
[41:22] Establish them. Make them happy. Fulfill
[41:24] their joy. And establish their feet more
[41:28] and more in the present truth. Bless the
[41:31] guests at the gates this morning. Lord
[41:34] Jesus. May they also be blessed. They've
[41:37] come to trust under the wings of the God
[41:40] of Israel. Please, may they find peace
[41:42] and refreshment. You promised to build
[41:45] your church. You said the gate of air
[41:48] will never prevail. May you confirm that
[41:51] promise in the life of this local
[41:53] assembly. I ask a special blessing upon
[41:56] your church that you will bless them
[41:59] mightily. You will establish them more
[42:01] and more in the present truth. You will
[42:04] keep them healthy. Take away their
[42:06] affliction and their sicknesses. Give
[42:08] them peace in their bodies. Give them
[42:10] peace in their spirit. Give them peace
[42:13] in their souls. Oh God, take over their
[42:16] circumstances. Lord, break every fetus.
[42:19] Break the tempter's power. Take away
[42:21] gloom. Lord Jesus. Encourage their
[42:24] hearts and keep them watching for thy
[42:26] coming. Till I see them again. May they
[42:29] be healthy. May they be strong serving
[42:32] the Lord. Bless them I pray this
[42:34] morning. And I ask that you will also
[42:36] bless the word that we share. May your
[42:39] children find encouragement. May they
[42:41] find peace. May they find an h anchor.
[42:44] May it give them a renewed strength to
[42:46] feel like traveling on. Help me help my
[42:49] audience and help all your servants that
[42:51] will stand behind the sacred desk to
[42:54] bring you unsearchable riches this
[42:56] morning. Bless every service we pray.
[42:59] And Lord, we thank you for the gift of
[43:01] this new day. We thank you for the gift
[43:03] of this new week. We pray that your
[43:06] angel will go before us to defeat every
[43:09] plan of the wicked one to frustrate
[43:12] Satan in all his moves and to open the
[43:15] windows of heaven that the blessings of
[43:17] God will pour upon us beyond what we
[43:20] have ever known that by the turn of the
[43:23] week Lord Jesus we shall celebrate
[43:25] milestones in our Christian experience
[43:29] in our physical lives and in every which
[43:32] way that we've been trusting and looking
[43:34] up onto to you for grant it Lord. Bless
[43:36] the officers of the church, the song
[43:38] leader, the musicians, everybody we pray
[43:41] for. Grant it their master in the name
[43:44] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you, saints.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. The Lord bless you.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[43:59] until I get a healthy response, I won't
[44:02] stop.
[44:03] The Lord bless you must not get come
[44:05] unto us.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; The prophet said that is the greatest
[44:09] blessing you can offer. Amen.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; So when we are blessed in the name of
[44:13] the Lord, let us receive it at
[44:18] &gt;&gt; so the Lord bless you.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Aha, that sounds better. God bless you
[44:24] saints. Amen. Uh so I don't keep you
[44:27] standing. I will invite you to please
[44:30] let's read the scripture so you can take
[44:32] the comfort of your seat and then we
[44:35] trust the Lord to take us from there.
[44:37] God bless the musicians. God bless the
[44:39] song leader. Amen.
[44:43] Yeah.
[44:45] Let's turn to the book of Job this
[44:47] morning. I had something else upon my
[44:50] heart but the Lord drove me to this. And
[44:54] uh since we are servants to God, we've
[44:56] leared to accept whatever he wants.
[44:59] Maybe somebody
[45:01] uh is pulling for that. And I hope it's
[45:04] a blessing to the saints this morning.
[45:07] Job chapter one. We are going to
[45:10] navigate through the book of Job.
[45:13] But I do not say we will cover
[45:15] everything in there, but
[45:19] we'll trust God to see how much we can
[45:21] do. And uh whichever much we do uh
[45:28] brother Moses will continue from there.
[45:34] Amen.
[45:35] Job chapter one.
[45:37] The first chapter we are reading is just
[45:39] for a background. Amen.
[45:43] If you are there say amen.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:47] There was a man in the land of
[45:50] whose name was Job.
[45:53] And that man, I want you to see how Job
[45:56] was introduced to us in the scriptures.
[45:58] This introduction was God's introduction
[46:02] because God is going to repeat it as we
[46:04] go along. Amen. And that man was perfect
[46:08] and upright and one that feared God and
[46:12] assued evil.
[46:14] And there were born unto him seven sons
[46:18] and three daughters. His substance also
[46:21] was 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels and 500
[46:25] yoke of oxen and 500 sheazes
[46:29] and a very great household. So that this
[46:32] man was the greatest of all the men of
[46:35] the east.
[46:37] And his sons went and feasted in their
[46:41] uh houses, everyone is they and sent and
[46:46] called for their three sisters to eat
[46:48] and to drink with them. And it was so
[46:52] when the days of their feasting were
[46:56] gone about that Job sent and sanctified
[46:59] them and rose up early in the morning
[47:03] and offered burnt offerings according to
[47:06] the number of them all. For Job said,
[47:09] "It may be that my sons have sinned and
[47:12] cursed God in their hearts." Thus did
[47:16] Job continually.
[47:20] Now there was a day when the sons of God
[47:23] came to present themselves before the
[47:25] Lord, and Satan came also among them.
[47:29] And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence
[47:31] comest thou? Then Satan answered the
[47:35] Lord, and said, From going to and fro in
[47:39] the earth, and from walking up and down
[47:42] in it.
[47:44] And the Lord said unto Satan, "Has thou
[47:47] considered my servant Job?" Now watch it
[47:50] again, that there is none like him in
[47:52] the earth, a perfect and an upright man,
[47:57] one that fearth God and ishu evil. Then
[48:02] Satan answered the Lord and said, "Dust
[48:05] Job fear God for not?
[48:09] Hast not thou made an hedge about him,
[48:12] and about his house, and about all that
[48:14] he had on every side? Thou has blessed
[48:17] the work of his hands, and his substance
[48:21] is increased in the land.
[48:24] But put forth thy hand now, and touch
[48:27] all that he has, and he will curse thee
[48:31] to thy face." So that is the deal.
[48:35] And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold,
[48:37] all that he has is in thy hand, only
[48:42] upon himself.
[48:44] Put not forth thy hand. So Satan went
[48:48] forth from the presence of the Lord. And
[48:52] there was a day when his sons and his
[48:54] daughters were eating and drinking wine
[48:57] in their eldest brother's house.
[49:41] Thank you very much.
[49:45] And they have slayed the servants with
[49:48] the edge of the sword, and I only am
[49:51] escaped alone to tell thee one. While he
[49:56] was yet speaking, there came also
[49:58] another and said, "The fire of God is
[50:01] fallen from heaven and hath burned up
[50:03] the sheep and the servants and consumed
[50:06] them, and I only am escaped alone to
[50:10] tell thee too."
[50:13] While he was there speaking, there came
[50:15] also another and said, "The Chaldians
[50:18] made out three bands and fell upon the
[50:21] camels and have carried them away here
[50:24] and the and slain the servants with the
[50:27] edge of the sword. And I only am escaped
[50:32] alone to tell thee three."
[50:36] While he was yet speaking, there came
[50:38] also another and said, "Thy sons and thy
[50:42] daughters were eating and drinking wine
[50:44] in their eldest brother's house. And
[50:47] behold, there came a great wind from the
[50:50] wilderness, and smoked the four corners
[50:53] of the house, and it fell upon the young
[50:56] men, and they are dead, and high only
[51:00] amcaped alone to tell thee." Four.
[51:04] Then Job arose and wrench his mantle.
[51:09] He did like all ms will do. He expressed
[51:13] his emotion and shaved his head and fell
[51:17] down upon the ground and worshiped.
[51:22] Amen.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; So Satan is defeated.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; What should have come is a curse. But
[51:30] what came was worship
[51:33] &gt;&gt; and said, "Naked came I out of my
[51:36] mother's womb, and naked shall I return
[51:38] tither. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath
[51:41] taken away. Blessed be the name of the
[51:45] Lord."
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Now wait for it. In all this, Job sinned
[51:49] n
[51:51] charge God foolishly.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; So that's a defeat for the kingdom of
[51:56] darkness. Amen.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add his blessings to the
[52:01] reading of his holy word. God bless you.
[52:04] You may please be seated.
[52:08] I want to thank the Lord again this
[52:10] morning for the privilege he had given
[52:13] unto me to be with the saints uh in this
[52:18] part of the world at this time. And I
[52:21] appreciate the very privilege of our
[52:23] pastors to have given me this
[52:25] opportunity to be of service. Uh and I
[52:30] pray that the Lord will bless them,
[52:33] bless the work of God in here and uh
[52:36] bless every one of you and uh we trust
[52:40] that somewhere along the line the effort
[52:42] will be a blessing. And uh I also I
[52:48] still bring the greetings from home
[52:50] because they never says to send you
[52:52] greetings
[52:54] uh anytime we speak. Being away from
[52:57] home, they called me all the time to
[52:59] check to be sure I'm fine.
[53:03] And uh with the kind of people like you
[53:07] and God on my side, I will always be
[53:10] fine.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; I've enjoyed so much care and
[53:13] hospitality.
[53:14] uh thank you for all that you have done,
[53:17] your gift and everything. May the Lord
[53:20] bless and richly reward
[53:22] &gt;&gt; to the glory of his holy name. Amen. So
[53:27] uh after this morning, we'll take a
[53:30] pause
[53:31] as I continued to Spruce Grove
[53:35] uh for a second service today and
[53:38] tomorrow I shall be leaving Alberta
[53:41] and somebody asked me yesterday when
[53:45] next are you coming?
[53:47] &gt;&gt; I said let me go first
[53:51] because I'm still around.
[53:54] If you ask me when next am I coming I
[53:56] will tell you today
[53:58] yesterday and I'm here this morning. So
[54:01] but we trust that uh the Lord will give
[54:05] us many more time as we look forward to
[54:08] his coming. Last year I told you that
[54:10] when we are rel if we are related we
[54:13] shall meet again and I said we are
[54:16] actually related. I may not be a
[54:19] Canadian
[54:21] but we are related by the better blood
[54:24] &gt;&gt; and that is the blood of Jesus Christ.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; If it's on the basis of being Nigerian
[54:29] or Canadian we may never have met. There
[54:33] are many people in Nigeria that I've
[54:35] never met in my life. Yeah. It's a
[54:38] country of diverse ethnicities and with
[54:41] over 200 million people. So, it's
[54:44] practically impossible for me to meet
[54:46] everybody. I'm not even sure I've met
[54:49] everybody that live in the locality
[54:51] where I do. But you see, I haven't met
[54:54] the people around me, but I've met you.
[54:57] It's a sign that we were connected
[54:59] together somewhere.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We have the same origin. And
[55:04] there's the privilege, it's the
[55:05] opportunity from the Lord that people
[55:07] who came from the same origin have the
[55:10] opportunity to connect in time.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; So when we have good fellowship in time,
[55:15] it will give us a nice appetite for a
[55:18] land where we'll never have to part.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; So till we watch for that, if he gives
[55:23] us more time, I'm sure the Lord will
[55:26] make our path cross again. Till then I
[55:28] pray that the Lord keep you healthy,
[55:31] strong, serving the Lord, walking in his
[55:34] will as I trust you'll be doing same for
[55:36] me. So God bless you very much. Amen. I
[55:40] don't know if uh uh any of the
[55:43] descendants of pastor John who is around
[55:45] here this morning are wonderful. Yeah.
[55:50] Because the mama told me that the
[55:52] daughter will be in service and uh so I
[55:56] said I'll be sure I be looking forward
[55:58] to seeing her and to greet her very
[56:00] much. I actually suspected you might be.
[56:05] Yeah. God bless you my sister. Amen. And
[56:08] God bless everyone of you. It's been so
[56:10] nice to see you all again. Amen. So this
[56:14] morning as
[56:17] much as time will permit us. But okay, I
[56:21] was just good.
[56:24] All right. The Lord will help us. I want
[56:26] to speak uh on a subject that I called
[56:30] lessons from Job.
[56:35] Lessons from Job. Amen. And uh
[56:41] I was uh inspired for this subject both
[56:45] from the scripture about Job and from a
[56:48] thought the prophet shared with us in
[56:51] the message. I know.
[56:54] He took it as a Easter message and he
[56:58] said no doubt people will approach this
[57:00] Easter services and messages from
[57:03] different angle today. He said but I
[57:06] want to approach it from another angle
[57:08] and the background thought he gave
[57:11] really caught my attention. I would like
[57:14] to share that quotation as we start as a
[57:17] background for what I'm going to say
[57:19] this morning. Trusting God. Amen.
[57:22] It said um
[57:25] in the message I know 60-0417s
[57:30] paragraph 26 I'm cutting off some few
[57:32] things. He said but what I thought for
[57:34] my little group this morning the Lord
[57:37] has given me I would approach it from a
[57:40] different standpoint if I could coming
[57:43] to a place of why do we come to these
[57:47] troubles?
[57:49] What makes these things come? Why should
[57:53] a Christian ever be perplexed?
[57:56] Why wouldn't not everything just run
[57:59] perfect for a Christian?
[58:02] But it doesn't and we know it.
[58:05] And sometimes we have more troubles when
[58:09] we become a Christian than we did when
[58:12] we were sinners.
[58:16] Because it is written,
[58:18] "Many is the afflictions of the
[58:20] righteous, but God deliverth him from
[58:24] them all."
[58:26] God promised many afflictions, strange
[58:29] feelings, and strange things that will
[58:32] be beyond our understanding.
[58:37] But it's always done for our good.
[58:41] just can't understand it because if we
[58:45] did then it will not be a faith to us.
[58:50] We will go with an understanding
[58:53] but we do it and we have it and we
[58:56] believe by faith his word that it's
[58:59] going to work some good thing for us.
[59:03] If we could grasp that today or this
[59:06] morning, if we could grasp that all of
[59:09] our troubles and there is none of us
[59:12] immune from them and if we could realize
[59:15] that those things are for our good. It
[59:19] is written in one of the scriptures in
[59:21] the Bible that trials are brought upon
[59:24] us are more precious to us than gold
[59:28] itself. For it is God giving us these
[59:32] trials. After we become his property,
[59:37] our confession and our baptism and our
[59:40] promise to walk in life for him, then
[59:43] every trial comes upon us that comes
[59:46] upon us is to perfect us for his glory.
[59:50] Is to bring us to a place where God can
[59:52] make himself more real to us than he was
[59:56] before the trial come. And I want to
[59:59] join in this morning with Job to say
[1:00:03] that I've lived long enough to know that
[1:00:06] is the truth.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; I have seen it in my own life that every
[1:00:10] time a great situation rises that I
[1:00:13] can't get around it or under it or over
[1:00:16] it, God makes a way and it comes out
[1:00:20] glorious. I just wonder how his grace
[1:00:23] ever does it, but it does it. Amen. And
[1:00:28] remember in all these things, Satan
[1:00:30] tries to make us nervous and upset us to
[1:00:34] get us to think, "Oh, why did this
[1:00:37] happen? Why couldn't I have been like
[1:00:39] this?" Amen. So when I read this,
[1:00:46] the Lord led my heart to look at the
[1:00:49] book of Job more and began to show my to
[1:00:53] show me some lessons in there. And I
[1:00:56] trust that these lessons will help you
[1:00:58] today.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. From the scripture that we read,
[1:01:04] the first introduction of Job in the
[1:01:07] Bible was that he was a perfect man,
[1:01:12] an upright man, one that feared God
[1:01:17] and
[1:01:19] shone evil.
[1:01:22] So the man we are talking about wasn't a
[1:01:24] secret sinner.
[1:01:27] The man we are talking about wasn't an
[1:01:29] unserious Christian.
[1:01:32] He was a man that met God's requirement,
[1:01:35] God's qualification
[1:01:37] until he could entredge his memory in
[1:01:39] the Bible because whatever God says here
[1:01:43] is the eternal record.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this was how much God thought
[1:01:48] of Job. And even when he had a
[1:01:52] conversation with Satan, God still
[1:01:54] repeated all these qualities that he was
[1:01:57] a perfect and upright man. He was a man
[1:02:00] who feared the Lord. He was a man who
[1:02:03] shun the evil and always do that which
[1:02:06] is right.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; I want you to appreciate this background
[1:02:10] very much. You will find it useful as we
[1:02:13] go on in the study. Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; All right. He was not just a Christian
[1:02:21] uh by God's definition in his own day.
[1:02:24] He was also a good Christian family man.
[1:02:30] He was a man who realized the importance
[1:02:34] of putting his family under the token.
[1:02:38] Amen.
[1:02:39] The prophet said, "Keep them under the
[1:02:41] Holy Spirit until those children are old
[1:02:45] enough to accept God and make choices by
[1:02:49] themselves."
[1:02:50] But you will realize that you cannot
[1:02:52] give what you don't have. Like we were
[1:02:55] sharing yesterday some four things that
[1:02:57] you need to do. Amen. When you do that,
[1:03:00] Brother Aram said, "Leave the rest in
[1:03:02] the hands of the Lord. God will take
[1:03:04] care of it." Job was a man who did that.
[1:03:08] The Bible said he anticipated
[1:03:11] challenges.
[1:03:12] He knew his children were young and
[1:03:15] perhaps he understood their spiritual
[1:03:17] standard. So he never took any chance by
[1:03:22] placing them under the blood all the
[1:03:24] time. He said it may be that they have
[1:03:26] done something wrong. They are young
[1:03:29] people. Maybe they have messed up. Maybe
[1:03:31] they've caused God in their heart. Job
[1:03:33] never waited even for them to come
[1:03:36] confessing. Neither did he wait for him
[1:03:39] to catch them. He anticipated any
[1:03:42] possibility. And because of that, he
[1:03:45] constantly stood in intercession for his
[1:03:49] family. A man who could do that will be
[1:03:52] living a life that is worthy. It shows
[1:03:54] that his life is a perfect example onto
[1:03:58] his family. He was living through as a
[1:04:01] son of God. Are you getting something
[1:04:03] from Job? Amen. So the family of Job was
[1:04:07] always under the blood
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; because he applied the token
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; all the time.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And to apply the token is to come
[1:04:16] under the obedience of the word. In the
[1:04:19] Old Testament when Israel was to leave
[1:04:22] uh the land of Egypt, God gave them the
[1:04:25] sign of the token. Amen. He told them to
[1:04:28] kill their lamp and uh goat if a family
[1:04:32] cannot afford one. He told families to
[1:04:35] come together and combine and killed one
[1:04:38] together. But you see, I tell you, if
[1:04:40] they kill that lamb and collect his
[1:04:43] blood and put it in a bucket for
[1:04:45] storage, they have not come under the
[1:04:48] obedience. Killing the lamp is not
[1:04:50] enough. You must obey what God said do
[1:04:53] with the lamp.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; If you obey what God said do with the
[1:04:57] lamb's blood, that is when you are
[1:04:59] applying. So obedience is applying. That
[1:05:03] is why in the message token the prophet
[1:05:05] said don't come this far and say I
[1:05:08] believe all the message. He said that is
[1:05:10] just being able to read and write. He
[1:05:13] said if you truly believe obey.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Obedience bring application. So when
[1:05:19] they collected the blood they were told
[1:05:22] to put it under the uh upon the doorpost
[1:05:25] and the lintil and not only that to stay
[1:05:28] behind it. That is complete application.
[1:05:32] If they put it under the doorpost and
[1:05:34] the lintil uh and the lintil and they
[1:05:38] never stayed behind it, they will still
[1:05:40] die just the same. If they collected it
[1:05:42] without applying it on those, you know,
[1:05:45] on the doorpost and the lintel, they
[1:05:47] will die just the same. So to it is not
[1:05:50] enough to kill your lamb. You must apply
[1:05:54] the blood where God said put it and you
[1:05:57] must stay behind it. That is complete
[1:06:00] obedience and that is the meaning of
[1:06:02] applying the token. God has given us the
[1:06:05] token in these last days because the
[1:06:07] token is no more the blood chemistry.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; The token is the life that came out of
[1:06:13] it.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; And this spirit of God in these last
[1:06:16] days has given us the word of God. When
[1:06:19] you obey what the word says, that is
[1:06:22] when you are applying the token.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. time will fail me to show you how
[1:06:27] the word for the hour is the blood for
[1:06:29] the hour.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Aha. If you are looking for the blood of
[1:06:34] Jesus Christ, the message of the hour is
[1:06:37] the blood of Jesus Christ. That is why
[1:06:40] in the message rapture, brother Abraham
[1:06:42] said there's going to be one great amiz
[1:06:45] day where the war where the march will
[1:06:48] not be to anywhere else to a remembrance
[1:06:51] arade but to glory. And he said, "As the
[1:06:54] saints are marching up to glory, they
[1:06:57] will be depleting upon their chest the
[1:06:59] blood of Jesus Christ, which is the
[1:07:02] message of the hour in the age in which
[1:07:05] they live in." Because when the lamb
[1:07:08] took the book, he qualified to take the
[1:07:11] book that was sealed with seven seals in
[1:07:14] Revelations chapter 5 by a payment.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. What was the payment? He paid his
[1:07:20] blood
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; in order to get the book. Is that right?
[1:07:24] And the book when it is revealed is the
[1:07:27] message of your day.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; So if you ask the Lord what was the
[1:07:31] payment you made to get this book, he
[1:07:33] will say I gave my blood.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So if you ask him for his
[1:07:37] blood, he will show you what the blood
[1:07:40] purchased. The blood purchased the book.
[1:07:43] And when he began to open the book, you
[1:07:45] became the content of the book. That was
[1:07:48] when you had your name supernaturally
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; and you came out. So if you want to
[1:07:53] apply the token today, do what the word
[1:07:55] says because that is the token for the
[1:07:58] hour and that is the only way to be
[1:08:00] righteous by coming under the blood for
[1:08:03] your day. So Job met the total
[1:08:06] requirement
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; of what it takes to be a Christian. The
[1:08:11] total requirement for blood protection.
[1:08:14] That was why even when Satan came, it
[1:08:17] said h I couldn't do anything to him
[1:08:19] because you had an edge around him. God
[1:08:22] did not build a fence around him. The
[1:08:24] fence Job lived in was the word of God
[1:08:27] for that hour. Satan might be able to
[1:08:29] pierce through everything and anything,
[1:08:32] but he cannot pierce through the word.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; So you stay in the word, stay under the
[1:08:37] blood by living in obedience to what the
[1:08:40] word says, and you are going to stay
[1:08:42] safe. Amen.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Job met the requirements
[1:08:49] of God and he never only uh did it for
[1:08:53] himself. He placed his family under it.
[1:08:56] That is like that is just the nature of
[1:08:59] every seed of Abraham of or of everybody
[1:09:03] who has a link to Abraham relative to
[1:09:06] faith
[1:09:09] because Job lived in the era of Abraham
[1:09:11] and the rest of them. So if you have a
[1:09:14] link to Abraham, you have the same
[1:09:16] manner of Abraham. What was one thing
[1:09:19] that endeared Abraham to God to receive
[1:09:23] revelation?
[1:09:25] If you are not understanding the word
[1:09:27] nor having the revelation of the word,
[1:09:29] you need to change your attitude also.
[1:09:32] One of the greatest quality Abraham had
[1:09:34] for God to always reveal things to him
[1:09:37] is his ability to pass it on.
[1:09:41] When God came down in Genesis chapter
[1:09:44] 18, he said, "Shall I hide anything?" He
[1:09:46] finished with him. He was going to Sodom
[1:09:49] for inspection before the fire fell.
[1:09:52] Then he asked, "Shall I hide anything
[1:09:54] from Abra from Abraham."
[1:09:58] Amen. And for two reasons, he told
[1:10:01] Abraham everything. He told Abraham his
[1:10:03] own fate and he also told him the fate
[1:10:06] of Sodom. He said, "One, because Abraham
[1:10:08] will be the possessor of these things."
[1:10:10] Then number two, he said, "I know it
[1:10:13] that whatever I teach him, he will teach
[1:10:16] his children."
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; So if you remain a resoa, a collecting
[1:10:22] point for the knowledge of the word, uh
[1:10:25] God will not reveal things to you. He
[1:10:27] wants you to be a channel of blessing.
[1:10:30] He wants this to come to you and to flow
[1:10:32] from you to your generation because God
[1:10:35] anticipation for eternity is that you
[1:10:38] and your offsprings should be there.
[1:10:41] That was what Isaiah said. And if you
[1:10:44] watch in the first Exodus wherein God
[1:10:47] was taking a nation out of a nation, God
[1:10:50] anticipated also the young people, the
[1:10:53] children. And whatever memorial,
[1:10:55] whatever things is trying to tell them
[1:10:57] to keep as a memorial, they kept it as a
[1:11:00] memorial mainly because of their
[1:11:02] generation. He said it will come to a
[1:11:04] time that your children will ask what
[1:11:07] minute this. How many ever read that in
[1:11:10] their Bible? And he said, tell them it
[1:11:12] is when the Lord thy God did this and
[1:11:15] that.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; So God has your children in mind and you
[1:11:19] must have them also in mind. That's one
[1:11:22] quality we learned from Job in the
[1:11:26] scripture. I'm giving you I'm giving you
[1:11:30] uh the good quality, the good background
[1:11:32] of Job because Job is a story of why do
[1:11:36] bad things happen to good people.
[1:11:40] And that is what we want to see this
[1:11:41] morning. So Job wasn't a sinner. He was
[1:11:44] a Christian. He was a son of God by
[1:11:47] every standard in his own day. Then the
[1:11:51] Bible said one day
[1:11:54] they came to present themselves
[1:11:57] before God. Now don't make that look too
[1:12:01] mysterious. What they came to do was
[1:12:04] they came for service.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; What are we doing here this morning? We
[1:12:12] came to present ourselves
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; before God.
[1:12:17] So don't be imagining what will that be
[1:12:20] sons of God came to the essence of God.
[1:12:24] It simply means they came for service
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; and you know in God's population
[1:12:30] counting most of the time it doesn't
[1:12:32] count women and children.
[1:12:36] So the use of the word sons here does
[1:12:38] not necessarily mean that it was only
[1:12:41] men or brothers that were in church.
[1:12:45] Are you getting it? They might have come
[1:12:47] with their wives. Sisters were there
[1:12:49] with their children
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; just as we had this morning. Are you
[1:12:54] with me?
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; When the Lord did the miracle of the
[1:12:58] five loaves and two fishes to feed 5,000
[1:13:01] and to feed 4,000. You read the account.
[1:13:04] He said 5,000 men besides women and
[1:13:08] children.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Are you catching it? Because in God's
[1:13:12] counting, he reckons more with the male.
[1:13:16] So there might have been 12 or 15,000
[1:13:20] people fed that day when you had the
[1:13:23] women and the children.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Are you catching it? So the fact that it
[1:13:27] said when the sons of God came here did
[1:13:30] not necessarily mean it was only men who
[1:13:33] were present.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; So we all came to present ourselves
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; before the Lord. It was a service day.
[1:13:42] Amen.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Aha.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; So on this particular service day, Satan
[1:13:49] was in service. Are you enjoying my
[1:13:52] story?
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Let me make something clear to you this
[1:13:55] morning. Satan comes to service and
[1:13:58] there's nothing you can do about it.
[1:14:00] When the prophet was talking about it,
[1:14:01] he said, "Don't frown at that."
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; That I said Satan comes to service. He
[1:14:07] said, "Show me any church, any service
[1:14:09] that Satan does not attend." Is a quote.
[1:14:14] And when brother A bra speaks like that
[1:14:16] because he has his authority.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the sons of God came to
[1:14:21] present themselves, where did God met
[1:14:24] Satan? He met him in that service.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; So it's both scriptural and messagical.
[1:14:33] Ah, so Satan is in our service this
[1:14:36] morning. Yes.
[1:14:38] Okay. Let me ask you a simple question.
[1:14:40] If you are dozing and sleeping in
[1:14:42] service, who is responsible?
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Answer me now.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; God will be God will be speaking to you.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; And be giving you sleep to rob you of
[1:14:55] the blessings.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Is the devil doing that?
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Aha. Let's jolt oursel to reality.
[1:15:05] So Satan is here this morning. Hear it
[1:15:07] loud and clear.
[1:15:10] Amen. Because in the Bible when the sons
[1:15:12] of God came to present themselves, the
[1:15:15] devil was in service.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Some of us when we were here in our body
[1:15:19] and our mind is in Ontario.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Our spirit is in Vancouver
[1:15:28] and the whole service run by the time
[1:15:30] the service is over you couldn't even
[1:15:32] recollect one thing that went on. You
[1:15:35] think God is responsible for that? I
[1:15:38] disagree with you. The devil is
[1:15:40] responsible.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Satan attends service.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; So, but you see what we can do is to
[1:15:48] render him useless.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Is welcome to attend, but he will go
[1:15:55] back without achieving nothing.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; The millennium will be peaceful not
[1:16:03] because Satan has be an elated. Listen
[1:16:06] to me, church.
[1:16:09] But the prophet said the millennium is
[1:16:12] going to be peaceful because Satan will
[1:16:14] be bound
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; by the chain by a chain. Is that right?
[1:16:20] And it will just it will take an
[1:16:22] unrecognized angel.
[1:16:25] Not even the big big angels whose names
[1:16:27] you know. He said an angel came with a
[1:16:30] chain to bound him.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Are you following? Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; It might be a just a small angel. That
[1:16:38] is how little the devil is.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; If you can get his secret.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Satan Millennium being peaceful
[1:16:47] isn't because Satan isn't existing, but
[1:16:51] it is because he was put in a condition
[1:16:54] because brother Bram said the chain of
[1:16:56] circum the chain we are talking about is
[1:16:59] not a physical chain.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; It's a chain of circumstance. a
[1:17:03] condition that makes it impossible for
[1:17:06] him to operate.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, brethren?
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "And what is the condition?" He
[1:17:13] said, "All his subjects are in hell. The
[1:17:16] church on earth is the redeemed. And
[1:17:19] because he had nothing to walk on,
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; oh,
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; will the church get that as a
[1:17:25] revelation?
[1:17:27] As long as the devil has nobody to walk
[1:17:30] on,
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; he will be here as an ordinary observer.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; As long as we refuse to be a tool for
[1:17:38] him to use.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Are you catching it? That is a
[1:17:42] revelation of the word.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; So don't make yourself a tool.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. As long as he comes in and he
[1:17:50] couldn't find somebody to use, he will
[1:17:52] remain useless himself. Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; If we stay here 10 hours, is it 10 hours
[1:17:58] of a waste of time
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; for the devil?
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Because we all become vessels of God,
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; vessels of honor.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; That is why the Bible said, the prophet
[1:18:09] said, always purge yourself. If you have
[1:18:12] any wrong feeling, wrong thought coming
[1:18:14] up in your mind, he said deal with it.
[1:18:17] Whether against somebody or against one
[1:18:19] another, purify yourself by doing the
[1:18:23] right thing. If you are not handling it
[1:18:25] properly, walk over to that person. This
[1:18:27] is the way I'm thinking about you. I
[1:18:29] don't know why is the devil trying to
[1:18:31] play a game. Pray for one another.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; When you have exposed the devil and you
[1:18:37] pray, Satan is bound to leave.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Let's render him useless this morning by
[1:18:43] refusing to be a tool of the devil. Then
[1:18:46] we're going to have a millennium right
[1:18:48] in our church. We're going to have a
[1:18:50] millennium right in our homes.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; So we welcome him. Satan, come if you
[1:19:01] want to come,
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; but you ain't going to use nobody here
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; because we all are vessels of honor.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; We are vessels of the almighty God.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; We are whom God say we are. And we
[1:19:12] treasure that. We confess that even if
[1:19:15] you have not come to such height, keep
[1:19:17] confessing it. I'm a child of God. I'm a
[1:19:20] vessel of honor. And your body will obey
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; your confession.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; So while he was in there in service,
[1:19:34] the Lord cited him and said, "Satan,
[1:19:37] where are you coming from?
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Where did you operate today?" I was
[1:19:42] operating everywhere.
[1:19:44] Amen. And I thought to extend my
[1:19:46] operation to church. God say you are
[1:19:48] welcome. If you want to operate here,
[1:19:51] let's let's have a conversation. Have
[1:19:54] you considered my servant Job?
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Now this was going on in the
[1:20:01] supernatural realm, spirit realm.
[1:20:04] Job had no idea
[1:20:07] of the conversation between God and
[1:20:10] Satan
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; and it was all about him.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Are you following me
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; right now? This morning you we don't
[1:20:20] know whom the devil and God is having a
[1:20:22] conversation over.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; If I ask you would you like God to spot
[1:20:27] you out?
[1:20:29] All hands will be kept.
[1:20:33] But you see these things are beyond you
[1:20:35] folks.
[1:20:38] It is God that determines that. But I
[1:20:41] give you one assurance this day that if
[1:20:44] God spotted you out or spot you out this
[1:20:47] morning for devil's assessment,
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; know that God has put something in you
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; that he can trust.
[1:20:59] God doesn't play games.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; You don't even know yourself as much as
[1:21:07] God does.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Did you catch that?
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; You see your condition. You see your
[1:21:12] weakness. The one who created you knows
[1:21:14] the deposit he has put in there.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Because God does not see as men see it.
[1:21:20] That is why when challenges come your
[1:21:22] way, you say, "I don't know if I can
[1:21:24] ever handle this." But you are still
[1:21:26] standing.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; You have handled several.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, the more that God
[1:21:32] will permit, you are going to handle it.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Because you don't know yourself as much
[1:21:36] as God does.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Accept God's assessment of you.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Accept his confession of you, not of
[1:21:45] yourself. One day God came down in the
[1:21:48] Bible
[1:21:49] to a man who seemingly outwardly and by
[1:21:53] what God met him with was a coward.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, I'll prove it to you.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; When he came down to meet Gideon,
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; in what state did it meet Gideon?
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; He met him in the state of cowardice.
[1:22:09] A man who harvested his farm and
[1:22:12] couldn't process it in the normal place
[1:22:14] of the treasure floor
[1:22:16] but was processing it in the wine press.
[1:22:19] The Bible said to hide it from the
[1:22:21] medianites.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; So he was doing a camouflage. He was
[1:22:25] doing a decoy because he didn't want the
[1:22:28] medianites to steal his labor. Amen. If
[1:22:32] he had any sound, he quickly run and
[1:22:34] dodge until maybe when God came down, he
[1:22:37] thought it was another medianite
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; and he was running.
[1:22:42] But when the Lord will address him, how
[1:22:45] did he address him?
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; You caught that now? Aha. Let that be
[1:22:51] your lift.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; God came down and said, Gideon, thou
[1:22:57] mighty man of valor, the Lord is with
[1:23:00] thee. You are dressing a coward as a
[1:23:04] mighty man of valor. So who shall I
[1:23:06] believe? Even Gideon himself did not
[1:23:09] thrust the assessment. Read your Bible.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; It's a sign that God doesn't see as men
[1:23:19] do.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; God knows what he has deposited in you.
[1:23:23] When you are seeing yourself as a
[1:23:25] failure, God is calling you a success, a
[1:23:28] victor, a victorious victor.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Because God does not confess your
[1:23:37] condition. He only confesses your
[1:23:40] position in him.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; And whether you like it or not, no
[1:23:43] condition is permanent. Your condition
[1:23:46] must give way to your position. Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; So always accept God's verdict of you.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; He came to a coward. He call him mighty
[1:23:57] man of valor. Brethren, how did the
[1:24:00] story end? It ended as a mighty man of
[1:24:03] valor. Because Gideon with only 300
[1:24:05] people defeated an entire nation that he
[1:24:09] was running away from.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, nobody stay under
[1:24:14] this s and is not parking power. Amen.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Day by day you are becoming more
[1:24:20] glorious, your life is getting better.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet said when you become
[1:24:26] born again and you stay under the
[1:24:28] revealed word. He said he places your
[1:24:30] body under subjection. And this
[1:24:33] rebellious body will start getting used
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; to the control of the new chief. And
[1:24:40] that is why he said when God says
[1:24:41] anything when you hear it you you start
[1:24:44] adjusting.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; You start adjusting. And you yourself
[1:24:48] can be testifying that things are
[1:24:50] getting different. Brother Arab said
[1:24:52] retain that testimony and let's keep
[1:24:54] going on because there is power in this
[1:24:57] word to change you from glory to glory.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; He said that change you experiencing is
[1:25:03] the very evidence that one of these days
[1:25:06] you are going to have a body change
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; and you are going to have a rapture
[1:25:10] because it has already started.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:18] If I say if this place were a wall or a
[1:25:22] fence and there's no roof and I said
[1:25:25] sister jump
[1:25:28] even the pastor said
[1:25:31] you can see what that means. Why would
[1:25:32] you ever tell us to do such a thing?
[1:25:34] I've not even asked the brothers. I'm
[1:25:36] only saying sister. Okay brother jump.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; You will think and it's an embarrassing
[1:25:41] demand because seemingly nobody can do
[1:25:44] it. Is that right? Except you have
[1:25:47] learned I jump and so forth and you are
[1:25:50] a sprinter. Amen. But what if I say you
[1:25:54] can do it? You say I'm not sure. And I
[1:25:57] keep saying you can do it. Then you say
[1:26:00] I don't know if I can really do it. And
[1:26:02] I keep saying you can do it. You said
[1:26:05] maybe if God permits. What am I doing?
[1:26:08] I'm changing you from face to face. And
[1:26:11] I said, do you know the reason why you
[1:26:13] feel you cannot do it? Is because
[1:26:15] nothing has provoked that ability in
[1:26:18] you.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; So you don't even know the abilities you
[1:26:22] have
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; until there's a provocation for it.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; If as we are sitting here now, as we are
[1:26:28] sitting here now, 50 lions just suddenly
[1:26:31] come.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Do you know you will find yourself on
[1:26:36] the other side of the wall?
[1:26:38] Do you realize that? And you will be
[1:26:41] wondering how you got there.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; You got there because it was already in
[1:26:45] you.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; It's just because nothing has provoked
[1:26:50] it
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; for you to enjoy it. That is the power
[1:26:54] that you are piling by the revealed
[1:26:57] word. Every time you come to God's
[1:26:59] presence,
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; as the world is getting more evil, this
[1:27:03] bride is getting more glorious.
[1:27:07] Hallelujah.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; So the conversation began. Have you
[1:27:15] considered my servant Job? It was the
[1:27:18] Lord who put up Job
[1:27:21] for trial.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Get it friends?
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; So it is safe to say that the problem of
[1:27:26] Job started from the church.
[1:27:30] Am I sounding crude?
[1:27:33] I'm just jolting you to fact. Amen. The
[1:27:36] problem of Job started from the church.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't by the church, but it
[1:27:43] started from church ground because after
[1:27:46] the service was over, Job began to
[1:27:48] experience
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; the deal between God and Satan.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; And uh God repeated his introduction.
[1:27:55] This man feared me. This man assue evil.
[1:27:59] He shone evil. He does the right. Is a
[1:28:02] perfect and an upright man. God was so
[1:28:05] happy
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; to deliciously declare that about his
[1:28:09] own servants.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; May the Lord depend on you and I.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; But you don't expect the devil to
[1:28:20] commend you.
[1:28:22] Did you hear me?
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; You don't expect commendation from the
[1:28:26] devil because the kingdom of the devil
[1:28:28] doesn't run like that. Let me show you
[1:28:30] an operating system of the kingdom of
[1:28:32] darkness.
[1:28:34] When the Lord said that, look at the
[1:28:36] response of Satan. He said, "Does Job
[1:28:40] fear thee for nothing?"
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Because in the kingdom of the devil,
[1:28:47] nobody is nice.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Did you hear me?
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; If there is any neness is because
[1:28:56] there's an ulterior benefit.
[1:29:00] If it doesn't come with an ulterior
[1:29:02] advantage in the kingdom of the devil,
[1:29:04] nobody's dies. Brother said the devil is
[1:29:08] used to meanness.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; So if is that's the way he is wired. So
[1:29:14] if he sees anything good, there must be
[1:29:17] a pecuniary gain.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; That is why he said if Job is doing all
[1:29:24] that, he must be getting something out
[1:29:26] of it.
[1:29:33] I told you about the sister that brought
[1:29:36] the alabaster hall yesterday.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; And I told you the attitude of Judas
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; that will suggest that maybe he's being
[1:29:44] nice to the poor.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; But the Bible said he's not being nice.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; When he was acting that neness is
[1:29:51] because he's looking at an ulterior
[1:29:53] advantage.
[1:29:55] That is the way the kingdom of darkness
[1:29:57] runs. But friends, even though there are
[1:30:00] benefits in serving the Lord, let me say
[1:30:03] it this morning. We don't serve God
[1:30:06] because of benefits.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; We are not serving God because we want
[1:30:11] to dodge hell.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; if you are serving God because of that,
[1:30:18] your service to God, your worship is
[1:30:20] transactional.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Give and take. Listen to me.
[1:30:26] We serve him because we love him.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; If your service to God, if your worship
[1:30:34] to God is not inspired by love, you are
[1:30:38] not yet a true diligent worshipper.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry to say if you don't mind, you
[1:30:45] are offering the sacrifice and worship
[1:30:47] of fools.
[1:30:52] Brother Abraham said what we lost in the
[1:30:55] garden was love. What redemption did is
[1:30:58] to bring us back that love
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; and love must be the basis for our
[1:31:04] service.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; It must be the basis of fellowship.
[1:31:10] That is why brother Abraham said, "If
[1:31:12] the Lord will tell me after all your
[1:31:15] service to me,
[1:31:19] when you pass, I will send you to hell."
[1:31:22] What did the prophet said? He said, "I
[1:31:24] will keep serving him."
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; And he meant it.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; I want that to be a revelation to the
[1:31:31] church.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Because this is the same revelation
[1:31:34] every true worshipper ever had.
[1:31:38] And that is why they can serve God in
[1:31:40] every season
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; whether times are bad or times are evil
[1:31:45] are good in season and out of season.
[1:31:48] Paul said what shall separate us from
[1:31:51] the love of God. Some of us what we have
[1:31:54] or what we don't have is the remote
[1:31:56] control for our mood for service.
[1:31:59] You can easily tell somebody has got all
[1:32:02] his footto full
[1:32:05] sometimes by the way he worships the
[1:32:06] Lord and you can even easily tell that
[1:32:09] everything is wrong. Sometimes by their
[1:32:12] attitude they have spiritual mood
[1:32:14] swings.
[1:32:17] Today they are happy to worship the
[1:32:19] Lord. Tomorrow they are moody to worship
[1:32:22] the Lord. The next day they don't even
[1:32:24] want to worship the Lord. They come to
[1:32:26] the house of the Lord as a duty so that
[1:32:28] nobody will check that they didn't come.
[1:32:31] And there are many others who have
[1:32:32] excuses
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; who rather build excuses for not coming
[1:32:37] to the house of the Lord. You are not in
[1:32:40] love.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Am I sounding flat?
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry if I'm sounding flat. Permit
[1:32:47] my African gabs.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; But get the message.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; You are not in love.
[1:32:54] Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Those who love the Lord serve God in
[1:32:57] season out of season.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; In the message ever present water from
[1:33:01] the living rock,
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; the prophet said if a young lady is
[1:33:05] moving with a man but is moving by the
[1:33:08] compulsion of parent, he said she
[1:33:10] doesn't look forward to seeing the guy
[1:33:13] when it comes around they will have to
[1:33:15] beg and pet for her to come out. He said
[1:33:18] but if she was in love she's even
[1:33:21] counting seconds. He ought to have
[1:33:23] arrived here now.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; That is the difference.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; And if your love will drive a person
[1:33:32] that hard, how much more if the love of
[1:33:34] God takes a hold in a human heart?
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "What shall separate us
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; from the love of God?" He mentioned
[1:33:42] every condition.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; That is adverse to humanity. And he
[1:33:48] said, "No, in all these things we are
[1:33:51] more than what? Conquerors through him
[1:33:54] that loved us."
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; You are planning to go to the same
[1:33:59] heaven they went.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham said if he says yeah he
[1:34:04] will send me to hell after my service to
[1:34:07] him. He said I will keep serving
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; until I get to that hell. And when I get
[1:34:13] to hell, if there is still an
[1:34:15] opportunity to love and serve, I will
[1:34:17] continue in hell.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; So he isn't serving him because of
[1:34:21] anything he could get.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Whether he gets or not,
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; do you know why true worshippers have
[1:34:28] some capstone revelation? Let me show
[1:34:31] you this morning with the three Hebrew
[1:34:33] children. How many remember the three
[1:34:35] brothers?
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Company with people with positive
[1:34:40] energy. Amen.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Those who will help your faith
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; and spiritual commitment. I told you
[1:34:46] last night that if you are moving with
[1:34:48] people who make you vile
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; or disinterested in the things of God,
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; he said change your company
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; because you don't need them in your
[1:34:57] life.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; They will destroy you.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Move with those who will help your
[1:35:02] faith,
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; whose life will provoke you
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; to good works. Amen.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; These three Hebrew brothers were not the
[1:35:10] only young people in Israel. How come
[1:35:12] they were the only people God singled
[1:35:14] out for a for an eternal memorial?
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; These brethren had contradictions both
[1:35:21] from within and without. Outside people
[1:35:24] saw them as rebels.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Inside the church, they saw them as
[1:35:28] fanatics.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, that is the truth. Yours are too
[1:35:33] much. The spoken word is not that hard.
[1:35:38] I mean he he he the spoken word gives
[1:35:41] you the leverage to also reason and
[1:35:44] think. It is this reasoning and thinking
[1:35:46] that will make people submit to the
[1:35:48] antichrist system. Yeah, that's what the
[1:35:50] prophet said that it is better to serve
[1:35:53] God under the antichrist system than not
[1:35:56] to serve God at all. Who tell you we
[1:35:58] cannot serve God without submitting to
[1:36:01] the antichrist? The three Hebrew
[1:36:03] children served God without submitting
[1:36:05] to the Antichrist. Or you don't know
[1:36:07] that that is an antichrist. You don't
[1:36:09] know that that is their own squeeze.
[1:36:11] What is the demand of the antichrist?
[1:36:13] Worship.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Why was Nebuchadnezzar angry against the
[1:36:18] three Hebrew children? Worship. Why was
[1:36:21] Darius angry? The friends of Dar, the
[1:36:23] princes of Darius. Why were they angry
[1:36:25] against Daniel? Worship. What made
[1:36:28] Hammon to be angry with Modi? worship. I
[1:36:32] can trace it throughout the scripture
[1:36:34] for you that the only contention Satan
[1:36:37] had with God is on worship.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; And the Bible in Revelation 13:8 said he
[1:36:43] will succeed in getting worship.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; He said all the people of the earth will
[1:36:49] worship him.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; But it is because of the exception
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; except those whose names are in the
[1:36:55] lamb's book of life. And let me tell
[1:36:58] you, those are the people whose worship
[1:37:00] Satan is interested in.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Are you catching it? Is gotten worship
[1:37:06] everywhere. But he want it from the
[1:37:09] stars of God, which is you and I.
[1:37:11] Because you have the most premium
[1:37:13] worship,
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; the highest quality of worship. Until he
[1:37:17] get it from you, he will not be
[1:37:19] satisfied. But let me tell you, Satan
[1:37:21] will die unsatisfied man. Because
[1:37:24] according to the scripture, we will not
[1:37:27] give it to him. All the people of the
[1:37:29] earth will worship him except those
[1:37:33] whose names are in the lamb's book of
[1:37:35] life.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; By prophecy, we are not designed
[1:37:39] to to submit to the devil.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; So don't worship him with your tongue.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Don't worship him with your convention.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Don't worship him with your attitude.
[1:37:51] Anytime you do the devil's desire,
[1:37:54] that's worship unto him
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; in any situation, whether good or bad,
[1:37:59] respond correctly
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; with the right words, with the right
[1:38:04] attitude. That's the worship to God.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Are you happy?
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Can I see go on a little?
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you'll give him more work.
[1:38:19] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; You don't want too much assignment. They
[1:38:25] love their pastors. They don't want too
[1:38:27] much assignment. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:38:31] All right.
[1:38:32] So the three Hebrew children
[1:38:36] are because the king loved them.
[1:38:40] They are his governors. Said, "What am I
[1:38:43] hearing about you?"
[1:38:45] And they said, "Oh, king lively forever.
[1:38:48] What you heard about us is the truth."
[1:38:52] He said, "Okay, I'm going to give you
[1:38:54] another chance." Maybe it was because I
[1:38:55] wasn't there. So, don't bother, King. If
[1:38:58] you give us 10 opportunities, the answer
[1:39:00] is going to still be the same.
[1:39:03] So, we had better not waste each other's
[1:39:05] time. Now, listen to this. He said, "We
[1:39:08] know our God
[1:39:10] can deliver us." Amen.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Two revelations you must have. You must
[1:39:16] know God's divine ability
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; can means God is able
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; to deliver us.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; But they have a greater revelation
[1:39:28] to know that it is not everything God
[1:39:30] can do that he chooses to do.
[1:39:36] If he does not do what he can do by
[1:39:40] choice without explaining it, he's still
[1:39:43] God.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; It won't reduce him. So they add the
[1:39:47] revelation of God's sovereign ability,
[1:39:51] not just his ability,
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; his sovereignty
[1:39:55] that it is not every time he does what
[1:39:58] he can do. That was why they told that
[1:40:01] man, we know that our God can deliver
[1:40:04] us,
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; but hear it also. If he chooses not to
[1:40:09] deliver us,
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; are you catching it?
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Yet we will not bow down.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; In other word, either way,
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; we are for the Lord.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; That is love.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; That is the love of God. You are going
[1:40:30] to the same heaven they've gone
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; and you aren't going to go wishywashy
[1:40:34] manner. If they did that by the
[1:40:36] inspiration of the spirit today you have
[1:40:39] baptism of the spirit. You should do far
[1:40:42] greater.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Rise above your excuses and serve the
[1:40:46] lord wholeheartedly.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; He said in our environment it's so
[1:40:50] difficult you know to serve the lord
[1:40:52] like that. Poor you.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour came from your
[1:40:56] environment.
[1:40:59] It didn't come from African environment.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; It came from your environment.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; When you have the Holy Ghost, it is the
[1:41:06] master of all circumstance.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Perfect faith is the master of every
[1:41:10] environment.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Believers defy all environment
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; to serve God.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Because even the Bible said where sin
[1:41:19] abounds, grace much more abound. Where
[1:41:23] pressure abounds, grace much more
[1:41:25] abound. When the enemy comes like a
[1:41:28] flood, the spirit of the Lord will
[1:41:30] always raise a standard.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Save him anywhere and everywhere.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Pamos was said to be the seat of Satan,
[1:41:41] the throne room of the devil. Brother
[1:41:43] Arab said it's a paradox that saints
[1:41:46] lived in that PGamos in the throne room
[1:41:49] of the devil and they are still
[1:41:51] defeating Satan
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; in his own capital. That is the power
[1:41:55] that is in the believer. He that is in
[1:41:58] us is greater than he that is in the
[1:42:01] world.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Aram said a life filled with
[1:42:05] excuses is not worthy of the gospel.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Don't let your worship with God be
[1:42:11] transactional.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Let it be based on love.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; This is the way the kingdom of darkness
[1:42:17] operate. And I want to call your
[1:42:19] attention to it that this is the
[1:42:21] foundation for the challenge between God
[1:42:24] and Satan because God said, "I will show
[1:42:27] you that Job wasn't serving me because
[1:42:31] of all that he has." And God challenged
[1:42:34] him. He said, "You go take everything
[1:42:36] and let's see if it's going to change
[1:42:37] anything."
[1:42:44] The Bible told us that Job that Satan
[1:42:47] said, "Let me touch everything he has
[1:42:51] and I will make him do what? Cause you
[1:42:53] to your face." Money can be a snare both
[1:42:57] ways. Wealth can be a snare both ways.
[1:43:00] Meaning, if you have it, it can be a
[1:43:02] snare. If you don't have, it can be a
[1:43:04] snare. But guess what? If you have
[1:43:07] received Christ and you have gotten the
[1:43:10] pill of great price, the effect of money
[1:43:12] on any side will never affect you. Money
[1:43:16] is not the source of your joy. You have
[1:43:19] joy by the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; There are things God will give you in
[1:43:22] life to enrich your joy or to enhance
[1:43:26] it, but they are not the basis of your
[1:43:27] joy. That is why whether you have or you
[1:43:30] don't have, it doesn't change your
[1:43:32] loyalty or your commitment to God. If it
[1:43:35] is affected, you are still believing to
[1:43:37] being a Christian. You are not one yet.
[1:43:42] Lessons from Job.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; And Satan find it impossible, you know,
[1:43:49] to go around Job. He said, "You made an
[1:43:51] edge around him." God said it that's not
[1:43:54] a big deal. I will relax the edge.
[1:43:57] You go take everything he has and let's
[1:44:00] see what's going to happen. There's an
[1:44:02] edge around you, brother. There's an
[1:44:04] hedge around you, sister.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; That is why no matter what happened to
[1:44:09] you, stay where the fire is falling.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Stay under the blood.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "You can't be as good
[1:44:18] as a Christian ought to be if you don't
[1:44:21] come to church.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Come to church
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; under every circumstance.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Come hear the word.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Come pray. Do that in your home. Do that
[1:44:32] for your family. Family altar in the
[1:44:35] morning. Can we say amen to that?
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Family altar at night. Brother said when
[1:44:41] mama has finished washing all the
[1:44:43] dishes. Uh-huh.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Because angels visit our home and he
[1:44:48] doesn't want some dirty thing. He
[1:44:50] doesn't want to be smelling onions
[1:44:52] when they come into our house. That is
[1:44:55] why the reveal word said after mama has
[1:44:58] done wash the dishes or the kids or
[1:45:01] whoever let everything be clean. He said
[1:45:04] let the last thing be family altar. Put
[1:45:07] your house constantly under the blood.
[1:45:10] What would do we do at the family altar?
[1:45:12] We read some portion of the scriptures.
[1:45:15] Amen. And the father of the house if he
[1:45:17] has things to say he can comment on
[1:45:19] those things like Jesse did. Brother
[1:45:22] Abraham said what Jesse was doing in his
[1:45:24] family was what woke up the faith the
[1:45:27] blessings the the courage in David.
[1:45:30] These are quotations of the word.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; There is an antidote of the word for
[1:45:35] every aspect of our life because the
[1:45:38] message of the hour is a remedy for
[1:45:41] life.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Is the totality of God's counsel to give
[1:45:45] you a cure over loudian condition.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said in the evening gather
[1:45:50] again and read a little more portion and
[1:45:53] pray. Read the word in the morning and
[1:45:56] pray. Read the word at night and pray.
[1:45:59] You might think it's not working. It's
[1:46:01] working. Is retaining the right
[1:46:03] environment in that your house.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Sons of God, rise up to your
[1:46:10] responsibility. Put your family under
[1:46:13] the blood. Live a life worthy before
[1:46:15] them. When your wife sees something
[1:46:17] real, Amen. she will follow
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; and it will bless the children
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; down the line.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; So
[1:46:32] God said, "Go take everything
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; and let's see what happen. You we come
[1:46:37] back at the next service and talk about
[1:46:39] what will happen."
[1:46:41] And the Bible said, "Yes, ma'am." The
[1:46:44] Bible said,
[1:46:46] Satan, the service closed. Joe, God
[1:46:49] bless you, brothers. God bless you,
[1:46:51] brothers. I'll see you next service. God
[1:46:52] bless you, my sister. Happy. Oh, let's
[1:46:55] just keep serving the Lord. And
[1:46:56] everybody went home. And Satan also went
[1:46:59] out before the next service day. The Job
[1:47:03] suffered four calamities
[1:47:08] just in one day. It might have been few
[1:47:10] hours because the Bible said as this
[1:47:14] servant was given reports the only one
[1:47:16] who escaped before he finishes the other
[1:47:18] one has arrived.
[1:47:20] When you study those challenges
[1:47:25] the mobility was taken off the wealth
[1:47:28] disappeared. Family was affected. His
[1:47:31] sources of income everything went in one
[1:47:35] day. How many of us have suffered that
[1:47:39] or to that extent?
[1:47:42] No, I need answers.
[1:47:44] Oh, those who are answering are very
[1:47:45] honest. Those who are not answering are
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; In just few hours in one day
[1:48:00] everything disappeared.
[1:48:05] Now what is happening here?
[1:48:10] The same thing, the same experience that
[1:48:13] Job is having is being viewed in two
[1:48:16] different dimensions differently
[1:48:20] in the kingdom of the devil. Said Job is
[1:48:24] being tempted.
[1:48:27] Temptation comes with a motive to break
[1:48:30] you
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; and make you doubt your sunship.
[1:48:34] to displace you, to prove you as a fake.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; But testing in the kingdom of God, the
[1:48:41] same thing is being viewed as test.
[1:48:45] Because God does not tempt,
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; but God tests.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; What does testing show? Testing is to
[1:48:54] vindicate you
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; as a son of God.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; God will never put you in a situation to
[1:49:02] doubt your sunship. It is the devil who
[1:49:04] does that. If thou be the son of God,
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; you will never hear God say that if you
[1:49:11] be my son. No sir, he knows you are his
[1:49:13] son.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Even when you are failing, he it he
[1:49:18] wouldn't change his mind.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Did you hear me?
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Because every story of redemption
[1:49:25] started with your true identity.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:28] When Jesus was given the parable of
[1:49:30] redemption using the two sons of a
[1:49:32] father, he said a father had two sons.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; When they were two sons, they were not
[1:49:40] prodigal.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; There was no prodigal. But when one of
[1:49:44] them began to yield to the force of
[1:49:46] natural birth, he became a prodigal son.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was still a son. He only had
[1:49:53] prodigal identity,
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; but he didn't change the fact that he
[1:49:57] was a son.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; God does not disown his children.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; When he became a prodigal son, his
[1:50:09] prodigal life made him sto so low until
[1:50:14] he ran him into a shame. So low till he
[1:50:18] was feeding with pigs. He was still a
[1:50:21] son.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; God does not confess your condition.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; He only sees you by your position.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Then one day when he realized who he
[1:50:37] was, excuse me,
[1:50:40] what am I doing here? If it get worse
[1:50:43] than this, I'm a son. Then he said, my
[1:50:47] father
[1:50:51] has got so much wealth. The workers of
[1:50:53] my father are having a better deal than
[1:50:56] I am having here.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Then it become a son coming to
[1:51:00] realization.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Still a son.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Then when he got up he said I will go to
[1:51:06] my father
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; he became a repented son.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; When he came home and the father
[1:51:12] embraced him he became a restored son.
[1:51:16] When it was offered the ring and
[1:51:18] clothed, it became an adopted son.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Nothing ever changed his sunship
[1:51:24] identity.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; He was a son all the way.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "You are always a
[1:51:31] son."
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; That was why I told you yesterday that
[1:51:39] it isn't the Holy Ghost that made you a
[1:51:41] son.
[1:51:42] is election
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; is the thought of God
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; that is eternal. But the Holy Spirit
[1:51:49] bring you to the realization
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; of who you are.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; He strike the seed.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Then you realize you need to live higher
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; because you are a son.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; You thought you were a cow. That was why
[1:52:02] you were eating grass.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. But when the realization came,
[1:52:07] Amen. And you became restored. No cow
[1:52:10] can make grass appetizing to you again.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; That is a new birth.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; That is what a new birth does. It
[1:52:20] brought you to a realization that grass
[1:52:23] is no longer your food.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Your food is um what do you like, mama?
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Chicken.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Chicken. You see? Hallelujah. Your food
[1:52:32] is chicken combined with the carbs and
[1:52:35] everything. Amen. If I offered you grass
[1:52:39] now, would you take it? You would rather
[1:52:41] think that I'm out of my mind. You don't
[1:52:43] know I'm a human being. Am I a cow? H
[1:52:47] why are you offering me grass? And I
[1:52:48] said, this grass is very sweet.
[1:52:51] It's got some, you know, or what do you
[1:52:53] call those things? The role
[1:52:55] that a if I offer you a will you eat?
[1:52:59] It's very sweet. It's it has a lot of
[1:53:01] nutritional value. You'll just be
[1:53:03] looking at me as a mad man.
[1:53:06] where somebody doesn't know what but if
[1:53:08] I offer you some nice sandwich maybe
[1:53:11] some chicken burger and make it a full
[1:53:15] meal you will appreciate me
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; do you know why because you realize who
[1:53:19] you are
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; that is what the Holy Ghost does it
[1:53:23] brush you to it brings you to the
[1:53:25] realization of who you are then you know
[1:53:28] that some life is too low
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; for you to condescend because your
[1:53:32] appetite has changed Amen.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; So, Satan did all this for Amen. And as
[1:53:46] mortals, it shook the brother. He tore
[1:53:50] his claws. He laid bear. Hallelujah. But
[1:53:54] in that, the angels ministered to him.
[1:53:58] And Job rose off. I said, "God bless
[1:54:01] you, brethren. Thank you for offering
[1:54:03] comfort." He said, "Sorrow, but sorrow
[1:54:06] not as those who do not have hope."
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; His comfort rose. He said,
[1:54:13] "The Lord giveth, the Lord take it.
[1:54:16] Blessed be his holy name."
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; When is the next service? Wednesday
[1:54:21] night, we shall be in service.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; We shall go worship the Lord.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, the next service,
[1:54:27] Job was there.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; That's what your Bible says. I'm
[1:54:32] amplifying it for you. Job was there
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says Satan came again
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; to check for report.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; When he came to the service again, he
[1:54:48] met Job. And God said, "Satan, Job is in
[1:54:52] service.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Satan,
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Job didn't c me."
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Look at him. He's worshiping. is
[1:55:02] rejoicing
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; shouting hallelujah
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; rejoicing in God's presence Christian
[1:55:08] can sing in tribulation
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; because he that is in us
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; is greater than our challenges
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; the holy spirit may go from body to body
[1:55:18] but his character will remain the same
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; job identify with Paul's statement what
[1:55:24] shall separate us
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; he said for we are persuaded
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; that neither things present no future
[1:55:32] is able to separate us from the love of
[1:55:35] God which is in Christ Jesus.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; I tell you next service Job was in
[1:55:40] service
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; taking his position.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Because the devil came again
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; as at other times and he met Job in
[1:55:49] service.
[1:55:51] This guy is a frustration.
[1:55:55] Be a frustration to the kingdom of
[1:55:58] darkness.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; And the Lord was gracious.
[1:56:01] slighting job of Satan said Job is in
[1:56:04] service.
[1:56:07] He didn't he didn't chide me foolishly.
[1:56:10] He didn't sin.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Instead of that, he responded with
[1:56:13] worship.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Look, when we confront our challenges
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; with a positive attitude, you you
[1:56:20] confuse the kingdom of darkness.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; You know why? It's no longer you living.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Christ has taken over. And he that is in
[1:56:31] you, my brother, is greater than he that
[1:56:34] is in the world, I can do all things.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Through Christ,
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; that strengthenth me. They say talk is
[1:56:43] cheap. This is not a cheap talk.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; This is a reality of God that we can do
[1:56:48] all things through Christ that
[1:56:51] strengthenth us.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Job was in service. So what do you have
[1:56:56] to say? And let me show you something.
[1:56:58] Let's go to chapter two quickly. Verse
[1:57:00] three, instead of Job chiding God
[1:57:03] foolishly, the Bible told me Job added
[1:57:06] to his credentials by the trial.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Let's see.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Are you enjoying the Lord?
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:23] Okay, let's read from verse one, from
[1:57:25] verse one to three so that you can see
[1:57:27] that it was another service. Again
[1:57:31] there was a day when the sons of God
[1:57:33] came to present themselves before the
[1:57:34] Lord and Satan came alo among them to
[1:57:37] present himself before the Lord. He also
[1:57:40] came for service.
[1:57:44] Is that settled in your heart?
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; That it was another service again after
[1:57:49] the trial of Job.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; I'm making my case by the scriptures.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; All right. Watch. And the Lord said unto
[1:57:55] Satan, from whence comest thou? That's
[1:57:58] familiar, isn't it? And Satan answered
[1:58:00] the Lord and said, "From going to and
[1:58:02] fro in the earth, and from walking up
[1:58:04] and down in it." That is familiar,
[1:58:06] right? Now, let's go again. And the Lord
[1:58:08] said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered
[1:58:10] my servant Job?"
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Job is in service against Satan.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now watch, watch, watch.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; That there is none like him in the
[1:58:23] earth. Is that familiar?
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; That's familiar. God has said it before,
[1:58:27] right? Okay. A perfect and an upright
[1:58:30] man. Is that familiar too?
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; God has said it before. One that feared
[1:58:35] God and assure evil.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that familiar too?
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; God has said it before. Let's look at
[1:58:42] the next one now. And still he holdeth
[1:58:46] fast integrity. Is that familiar?
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Has God said that one before?
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; He hasn't said it before. So the trial
[1:58:56] of Job added another quality,
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; another recommendation,
[1:59:02] another attribute.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; It is a man who hold fast his integrity.
[1:59:07] He had four qualifications before he
[1:59:09] added another one. It became five by his
[1:59:12] trial.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; All right. Did you see something there?
[1:59:18] The trial strengthened him. The trial
[1:59:20] progressed him. The trial added more
[1:59:23] quality. God saw that Job love him more
[1:59:26] by his own trial. So what God sets to
[1:59:29] prove against the devil has been proven.
[1:59:32] That Job wasn't serving me because of
[1:59:34] all he had. You have taken everything he
[1:59:36] had and yet is back in service
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; still worshiping me. Nothing will
[1:59:41] separate him from my love. Job wasn't a
[1:59:44] transactional believer. He was a
[1:59:47] believer that loves me and he worshipes
[1:59:50] me. He serves me because he loves me.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Let's see what the Lord said. Still he
[2:00:02] holdeth fast his integrity
[2:00:05] although thou moved me against him to
[2:00:09] destroy him without what?
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; So there was no reason for this trouble.
[2:00:18] There was no reason. It wasn't because
[2:00:21] Job sinned. It wasn't because he did
[2:00:24] anything wrong.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Look, let me tell you, there are reasons
[2:00:27] why the scripture was given account like
[2:00:29] this. Because each line we pour into the
[2:00:32] other. Let's see why this is necessary.
[2:00:35] And Satan lived true to his nature.
[2:00:39] Instead of appreciating that said, in
[2:00:42] fact, I must give it to Job. God sir, I
[2:00:45] must give it to Job. I couldn't imagine
[2:00:48] me taking dealing with him in those
[2:00:50] four-way manner and yet he will still be
[2:00:52] in service worshiping you holding to his
[2:00:55] integrity meaning that his reputation of
[2:00:58] worship never diminished the way Job
[2:01:01] worshiped God the way he's so exuberant
[2:01:04] in his presence the way he served the
[2:01:06] Lord nothing tampered with it that is
[2:01:08] his integrity integrity speaks of
[2:01:11] reputation reputation speaks of what you
[2:01:13] are known by consistently in quality
[2:01:16] pity.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Are you getting the scripture?
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; So he never got into pity party.
[2:01:25] He wouldn't even allow you to as much as
[2:01:28] pity him in the church.
[2:01:31] He wouldn't allow that. Job wouldn't
[2:01:32] allow it. Before he want to say be
[2:01:34] comforted by he said shal love my
[2:01:36] brother. All is well.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my what a character that was.
[2:01:46] Don't let the devil take advantage of
[2:01:49] you. Because if there was one man who
[2:01:52] had a reason to have an issue with God,
[2:01:55] listen to me, church,
[2:01:58] it was Job.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; He searched his life. There wasn't
[2:02:03] anything wrong. Even God testified in
[2:02:07] confession that Satan, you made me to
[2:02:10] move against him without any reason.
[2:02:15] If there is anybody who should be
[2:02:17] singing why me Lord, it should be Jo.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Mhm. But did you ever hear him like
[2:02:27] that? No sir.
[2:02:30] Job never joined pity party. Job had a
[2:02:34] capsule revelation.
[2:02:36] God is not a clown. He's not the
[2:02:38] comedian. He's not cynical. If he
[2:02:41] brought anything my way, he has a
[2:02:43] purpose. I may not understand it. I may
[2:02:47] not know why, but I have this capstone
[2:02:50] revelation that God cannot be wrong.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Let that be your capstone revelation.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; you are not immune. We read a quotation
[2:02:59] from any challenge in life. And there
[2:03:01] are so many things. Brother Arab said,
[2:03:03] he would not give you a reason. You
[2:03:06] wouldn't understand why.
[2:03:09] And yet he said if he explained and yet
[2:03:12] he wouldn't explain it. He said because
[2:03:14] if he explain why anything and
[2:03:16] everything happens in your life your
[2:03:19] walk with him will never be connected by
[2:03:22] faith.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me church?
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Learn these lessons of life.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; God wants you to have a capstone
[2:03:30] revelation
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; that whatever it does good or bad as an
[2:03:35] experience to you he is not wrong. Until
[2:03:38] you have that as a revelation, you can
[2:03:41] never have a perfect walk with the Lord.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you this morning,
[2:03:45] church, God will put you in a condition
[2:03:48] that to defend him will be impossible,
[2:03:51] will be difficult.
[2:03:53] Did you hear me? Okay, digest it. Chew
[2:03:55] it on it a little. I'm saying God will
[2:03:58] put you in a situation
[2:04:00] that defending him will be practically
[2:04:03] impossible for you because the facts and
[2:04:06] the evidences of the situation will be
[2:04:09] too real by the human eye against God.
[2:04:17] Okay, to help you understanding, let me
[2:04:19] put it like this. How would you think
[2:04:21] Mary and Ma would have defended our
[2:04:24] Lord?
[2:04:28] It was this family of Lazarus
[2:04:32] that housed Jesus, gave him a
[2:04:34] commandation. Are you still with me?
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; They gave him cloth. They were feeding
[2:04:40] him. That's all you do for a shepherd.
[2:04:43] That's what you do for the men of God.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; So, they did everything. They met every
[2:04:48] Christian responsibility.
[2:04:51] They believed that message and they were
[2:04:54] supporting it wholeheartedly.
[2:04:56] That was why and Lazarus became sick but
[2:05:00] they couldn't get Jesus to come. Even
[2:05:02] though they wrote him a letter that was
[2:05:05] intimate
[2:05:06] to make him to appeal to his emotion to
[2:05:09] come. You know how the letter read
[2:05:12] Lazarus thy friend whom thou love.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Now suit yourself brothers.
[2:05:22] Because some little little light
[2:05:23] affliction happen in our life and even
[2:05:26] the pastor is jittery whether you are
[2:05:28] going to remain in the church or not.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with us?
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; We are not bed plans.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; We should be Christians,
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; solid pedigree,
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; rooted.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Lazarus thy friend whom thou love.
[2:05:47] They were doing that to arouse the
[2:05:50] emotion of our Lord. Making it intimate
[2:05:53] so that he can find the need to come and
[2:05:56] attend to the man who has been there for
[2:05:59] him. Lazarus was there for Christ. But
[2:06:02] in the hour of his greatest need, it
[2:06:05] didn't look like Christ was there for
[2:06:07] him.
[2:06:10] Now you find you find comfort in the
[2:06:13] story because you have read how it
[2:06:15] ended. If you were there on that day and
[2:06:18] you were looking at the attitude of
[2:06:20] Christ, what would you see of him?
[2:06:23] Think about it. That's the way to read
[2:06:25] the Bible. That's the way to locate your
[2:06:28] identity. Because brother Brown said
[2:06:30] some people were there who took a wrong
[2:06:32] side that this must be a mean pastor.
[2:06:35] The whole denominations where Lazarus
[2:06:37] and his family came out took advantage
[2:06:39] of that and were selling ideas. We told
[2:06:42] you before. We told you don't follow
[2:06:45] these latter day preachers
[2:06:48] who came from nowhere. The whole kind
[2:06:50] priest is good enough for you. They have
[2:06:53] they have a rich history of commitment
[2:06:56] and support to your family all your
[2:06:58] life. When your parents were nobody,
[2:07:00] they made them somebody. When they
[2:07:02] couldn't take care of you, they gave
[2:07:03] them support. They raised you all
[2:07:05] through their curriculums and
[2:07:07] everything. You grow up and you start
[2:07:09] talking nonsense that you find one
[2:07:11] pastor Jesus. By the way, who is he?
[2:07:15] Where is his family? Isn't that the guy
[2:07:17] they said was born one virgin conceive?
[2:07:22] Brother Abraham said that old church had
[2:07:25] a real reason to do what? And he said,
[2:07:28] go read the message. Then Jesus came and
[2:07:29] called. He said, let's play devil
[2:07:31] advocate.
[2:07:33] You will see that by all the actions of
[2:07:35] Jesus, these guys outwardly showed more
[2:07:38] love
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; what you we call love.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; When when your so-called love is
[2:07:45] malicious,
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; malicious in the sense that in the sense
[2:07:49] that your good deed is tailored towards
[2:07:52] vindicating somebody as evil,
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; is a sacrifice of fool. God will not
[2:07:58] accept it.
[2:08:01] The more they call for Jesus, the
[2:08:03] farther he was going. He got to to
[2:08:05] Toronto.
[2:08:09] By the time Lazarus got to ICU, Jesus
[2:08:13] was in New York waiting to board his
[2:08:16] direct flight to Africa
[2:08:18] and he was in our church when Lazarus
[2:08:20] died in Africa in Lagos. Hallelujah.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; He did 11 hour 11 hour flight from New
[2:08:29] York. If he went through Atlanta 13
[2:08:31] hours, but he was in our church
[2:08:33] preaching. He was so far away until when
[2:08:37] the man died, he couldn't even attend
[2:08:40] his funeral. And yet he offered no
[2:08:43] explanation to his committed church
[2:08:46] members.
[2:08:48] If it were you, what would you do? I'm
[2:08:51] asking you church
[2:08:53] place your actions
[2:08:56] your reactions your manner your
[2:08:59] complexes place it upon the word
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; and see if it fits you saw you see can
[2:09:08] see the reason why Paul when he was
[2:09:09] approaching the church he approached the
[2:09:12] church in a manner that looks
[2:09:13] insensitive when they said there's no
[2:09:16] temptation that happens to you that is
[2:09:17] uncommon snap out of it To somebody that
[2:09:21] is an insensitive statement because you
[2:09:24] feel you are going through things
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; and somebody is not minding you.
[2:09:30] But you know why he did that? He said
[2:09:32] that to jolt you out of self-pity.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Because no matter what happened around
[2:09:38] you, as long as you stay under the
[2:09:40] blood, as long as you remain connected
[2:09:43] with Christ, Satan can never claim
[2:09:45] victory. The bumper of the blood is
[2:09:48] shielding the larger effect.
[2:09:51] People had gone through things. They've
[2:09:54] not even gone through half of what you
[2:09:55] are going through, they've committed
[2:09:57] suicide. So what kept you standing is
[2:10:00] the power of the blood.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; The devil knows that no matter how much
[2:10:05] he acts,
[2:10:07] he can't destroy you
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; until he breaks your hedge.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; And the hedge is unbreakable.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:17] Are you with me?
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; So stay in God's presence. Don't allow
[2:10:21] the devil to sell some ideas to you that
[2:10:24] what you are going through is a three P
[2:10:26] agenda. Three P's agenda.
[2:10:28] Personal peculiar problem.
[2:10:37] Personal peculiar problem.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; It's a problem like no other
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; given to you personally.
[2:10:45] If you accept that lie, it's a lie.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Do you know why it's a lie? How many
[2:10:50] people do you know on this road of on
[2:10:52] this area of the church? How many homes
[2:10:55] have you entered on the streets where
[2:10:57] you live? Do you know it's possible you
[2:11:00] have inside some of the houses there?
[2:11:02] People who haven't seen the sun for more
[2:11:04] than 10 years.
[2:11:06] Folks who have been bedridden
[2:11:09] and still trusting God for a change. Are
[2:11:12] you with me?
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So how would your problem be too
[2:11:15] peculiar?
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; It's a lie. You know why the devil is
[2:11:18] sending you that lie? He's trying to
[2:11:20] arouse you emotion
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; to put you in a mode of complex against
[2:11:25] God.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Because if you accept it, then you begin
[2:11:30] to ask yourself, why will God be
[2:11:33] personally mean to me?
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; What evil have I done more than any
[2:11:39] other person?
[2:11:41] And by the time you start building on
[2:11:42] that, you know what's going to be
[2:11:44] happening? You are going to start having
[2:11:46] complex. If God will be that personally
[2:11:48] mean to me, what is the use of serving
[2:11:50] him? And unconsciously, you don't find
[2:11:54] interest
[2:11:55] in fellowship again. You don't find
[2:11:58] interest in reading the word. So you
[2:12:00] don't want to hear from somebody who is
[2:12:02] mean to you. You don't find interest in
[2:12:05] prayer again. You don't want to talk to
[2:12:07] somebody who is mean to you. And you
[2:12:10] know what is going to happen by that?
[2:12:11] It's going to put you in a backsliding
[2:12:13] condition and gradually isolate you
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; from your protection.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Because until you isolated, Satan knows
[2:12:21] that he cannot destroy you.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; It does not have access as much as you
[2:12:25] think he has.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; That is why grace has been keeping you
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; through all holes.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Don't leave your place of safe retreat.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; No matter what happened,
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; stay in God's presence.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because one of these days help
[2:12:41] will come.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus will come
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; and he will break the tempter's power.
[2:12:46] He will take away every gloom and fill
[2:12:49] your life with glory.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Stay in the environment where connecting
[2:12:53] with him is possible.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; If you want to kill a coal or fire,
[2:13:00] isolate it from bunch of coals or fire.
[2:13:05] The day you take it out from bunch of
[2:13:07] coals of fire, that is the moment you
[2:13:09] kill it.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; The death will manifest later. Because
[2:13:13] when you take it out, it still has on
[2:13:15] fire. But you know what? It can't retain
[2:13:17] it. It will gradually
[2:13:20] start fading until it fully
[2:13:22] extinguished. That is the meaning of
[2:13:24] backslidiness.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Don't accept it.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Stay with the Lord.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; No matter what happen, stay in the
[2:13:30] church. Amen.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; You can't be as good as a Christian
[2:13:34] ought not to be when you leave the
[2:13:35] church.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Stay in the church.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; One of these days it will be your turn.
[2:13:42] The Lord of harvests will pass by
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; and change it all for you. He's not
[2:13:46] unmindful of your condition. If he
[2:13:49] brings it your way is because he knows
[2:13:51] he's giving you the capacity to handle
[2:13:53] it. Ask for grace each day. Serve him
[2:13:57] closer. Serve him more. respond to the
[2:14:00] devil's attack with a greater service.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Are you encouraged?
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; So, Job was in service
[2:14:16] and the Lord said it again. He said,
[2:14:18] "This time around, let me add one more
[2:14:20] quality.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; He has integrity
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; and he retained it." So, the trial
[2:14:25] scaled his value
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; before the Lord. And of course, Satan
[2:14:30] would don't appreciate that again.
[2:14:32] Instead of acknowledging it, you must
[2:14:35] acknowledge good things. Don't operate
[2:14:38] by the mindset of the devil. If a sister
[2:14:41] comes to sing special number and it
[2:14:43] blesses our soul, let us acknowledge
[2:14:45] them.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Let us encourage them. Let's not sit in
[2:14:49] the seat of the devil. Why? Why is she
[2:14:52] singing special number? She's trying to
[2:14:54] make herself available so that brothers
[2:14:57] can see her.
[2:14:58] Shame on you.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; He's got a new dress at Canadian super
[2:15:04] pastor. She want us to see her dress.
[2:15:06] Shame on you.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Who told you?
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Are you a tool in the hand of the devil?
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; If a brother sing a special number,
[2:15:19] let's appreciate it.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; God visits people by that. He visits
[2:15:24] people by visit. He heals people by
[2:15:27] visit. Just a word of encouragement. He
[2:15:30] heals by song. He heals by the preaching
[2:15:32] of the gospel. Let me tell you to the
[2:15:34] pure, all things are pure.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; Don't operate by the mindset of the
[2:15:40] kingdom of darkness.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; It's Satan that doesn't appreciate good
[2:15:44] things.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Instead of him saying that, ah, no, on
[2:15:47] this one, God, you were right. I didn't
[2:15:50] know Job could handle that. I give him a
[2:15:52] salute
[2:15:54] but let me do further. His only response
[2:15:57] is skin for skin.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Read your Bible.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; He has forgotten what he said that if I
[2:16:05] take everything he had, he will deny
[2:16:06] you. Now Job never denied. He came to
[2:16:09] service and he said that
[2:16:13] it's because it's only his property.
[2:16:17] If you allow me to touch him personally,
[2:16:21] give him some cancers, some tubacolosis,
[2:16:24] some whatever. You medical people, you
[2:16:26] know all this story. I don't want to
[2:16:28] know them by his grace.
[2:16:30] Hallelujah. But I know all I know them
[2:16:33] to all be demons.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Because Satan is the originator.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; He said it in the book of Job himself.
[2:16:40] He says skin for skin. All that a man
[2:16:43] has he will be ready to give up for his
[2:16:45] life. In other words, he thought that
[2:16:46] Job will compromise with him to get back
[2:16:49] his healing.
[2:16:51] That's what he was saying.
[2:16:54] And God laughed again. You are you are
[2:16:56] an incurable pessimistic optimist.
[2:17:03] That's what God told you. I said, Satan
[2:17:05] said you are incurable negative
[2:17:07] optimist. After all this, you think you
[2:17:09] can see guy by guy.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's do another round. Let's take
[2:17:14] a bet.
[2:17:16] And they took the B again.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; And this time around, Satan went very
[2:17:21] vicious.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; He could have killed Job if God had not
[2:17:25] said you can do everything
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; but is life.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; That tells you the mind of God.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Your challenges in life are not designed
[2:17:32] to destroy you.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; You must remain positive.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; What kills us many a time is being
[2:17:39] negative. Our system, our organs fight
[2:17:43] hard for us as long as we remain
[2:17:46] positive.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Medical science said nature fights hard
[2:17:52] as long as the man has not given up
[2:17:54] because they did they did a a a research
[2:17:58] of those who have terminal diseases. And
[2:18:01] some said they asked some do you still
[2:18:04] have the will to leave? And they said we
[2:18:07] have the will to leave. They put them on
[2:18:08] one side. Then the others they said, "Do
[2:18:11] you still have the will to leave?" They
[2:18:12] said, "No, no, no, no. I better just
[2:18:14] go." They put them on the other side and
[2:18:18] they watched them for about three to six
[2:18:20] months. Those who said they do not have
[2:18:22] the will to leave, by the end of that
[2:18:25] observation study, they were all dead.
[2:18:29] He said, "But those who said they have
[2:18:31] the will to leave were still alive."
[2:18:34] And they said when they were studying
[2:18:35] their system, they realized that those
[2:18:38] who said they no longer have the will to
[2:18:40] live, their organs began to gradually
[2:18:42] shut down.
[2:18:45] And science is wondering what is the
[2:18:47] connection between their mouth and their
[2:18:49] organs.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; And I jumped. I said, I know it.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; My prophet told me,
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; he said, your body will obey your
[2:18:58] confession.
[2:19:00] The Bible said Christ is the high priest
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; of our profession.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; To profess and to confess means the same
[2:19:08] thing.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is why brother Abraham
[2:19:11] said don't never be negative.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Always be positive.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; L.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; He said if I'm declared that I'm going
[2:19:22] to die of what use is faith? The prophet
[2:19:26] said of what use is worry and fear?
[2:19:29] Worry and fear will kill you before the
[2:19:31] time. But faith can sign your pardon.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Faith can revive your organ. It can even
[2:19:37] change your part
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; and re repair where necessary and
[2:19:41] replace where necessary
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; and you can come out of the most deadly
[2:19:45] situation.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; He said they looked at those on the
[2:19:49] other side who said they have the will
[2:19:52] to leave. They discovered their organs
[2:19:54] were fighting hard to retain their life.
[2:19:57] This is what science said.
[2:19:59] And that science vindicated the word.
[2:20:03] So it cost you nothing to retain your
[2:20:06] integrity, to retain your faith.
[2:20:10] It could mean a word of blessings. The
[2:20:12] day you give up, that is to say you
[2:20:14] start going.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Skin for skin. All a man has he will
[2:20:20] give. And God say you go ahead and let's
[2:20:23] see what happened. Brethren, Satan went
[2:20:26] ahead and he dealt with Job so bad. But
[2:20:30] he was watching for that statement.
[2:20:33] God, today I curs you.
[2:20:37] He didn't get it.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; It was so bad. It was so bad. But the
[2:20:42] Bible said Job sinnth not. He couldn't
[2:20:46] explain. He said, "I thought we have had
[2:20:49] enough, but this has come again. Lord,
[2:20:52] you know why the devil became
[2:20:55] frustrated. He went to the wife. He
[2:20:57] said, "Say something. Say something."
[2:20:59] And when the wife too will not say
[2:21:00] something, he used a her voice to echo
[2:21:04] his own word. It wasn't Job's wife who
[2:21:07] said that. It was Satan using her voice.
[2:21:10] Cause God and die. Because the mission
[2:21:12] of Satan is to get Job to cause God and
[2:21:15] die.
[2:21:19] But see a righteous man, a perfect man,
[2:21:22] he sense that. He said, "Honey, that's
[2:21:24] not you.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; I won't take that against you because
[2:21:28] that isn't you."
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; Ah, we we don't make excuse for one
[2:21:34] another again.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we are losing love.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; But Job retained the love of God in his
[2:21:41] heart. He said, "Honey, that's not you.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; I know who you are. I know your
[2:21:45] integrity. I know your life. You are not
[2:21:49] a foolish woman. But this statement that
[2:21:51] came out looks like one of them. Jolt
[2:21:53] yourself out of it.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; That's a good husband.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; That's a Christian husband.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; That's a son of God with the wisdom of
[2:22:06] the sons of God.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham said, "I come to my
[2:22:09] house sometimes things don't look like I
[2:22:11] left it."
[2:22:14] He said, "But I take the challenge
[2:22:16] to attack the invader."
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; Because is the devil invading the
[2:22:21] atmosphere in my house?
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; I've got to deal with the devil. Send
[2:22:24] him out.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Then come back to my wife.
[2:22:30] Correction must be placed in the right
[2:22:32] atmosphere.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; When you do it at the wrong time, the
[2:22:35] sister will not see it. The brother will
[2:22:38] not see it. Even the children will not
[2:22:40] see it.
[2:22:42] And you must do it with love. That is
[2:22:44] the quality of a Christian husband. That
[2:22:47] is why brother Arab said your wife, it
[2:22:49] will be easy for her to reverence you
[2:22:53] when she sees you as a genuine son of
[2:22:56] God.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; No true child of God sees something real
[2:22:59] and does not have reverence.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; It's so bad. A lot of us look like
[2:23:05] angels in the house of the Lord, but we
[2:23:07] live like a
[2:23:09] tigers in our houses. God knows your
[2:23:12] house address.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Repent this morning.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; Job said, "That's not you." Brother
[2:23:23] Abraham said, "I start doing things to
[2:23:26] bring back the atmosphere because I know
[2:23:29] that woman has had a lot to go through."
[2:23:32] Can you see him making excuse for his
[2:23:34] wife? He comes and say, "I saw a cloth
[2:23:38] at the super store. Let's go get it."
[2:23:39] Mother doesn't want to hear. He said,
[2:23:40] "Keep your cloth." I don't want because
[2:23:44] she's all worked up and tensed up. And
[2:23:46] the prophet will be saying, "Oh, uh, how
[2:23:49] how bad it could get sometimes." This
[2:23:52] woman doesn't have her space. A lot of
[2:23:54] sick people are all over the house. If
[2:23:57] she wouldn't even have the space to even
[2:23:59] cook for the family, take care of
[2:24:01] things. She's under so much pressure.
[2:24:03] The prophet making excuse for his wife.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "You know what I start
[2:24:08] doing? I start doing things to bring
[2:24:10] back the smile.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; I try to he say I try to wash. I try to
[2:24:19] cook even though I hardly can boil water
[2:24:22] successfully.
[2:24:24] Yeah, those are quotations. He said I
[2:24:26] try to cook. I I get the apron start
[2:24:29] tidying up the kitchen. And you know
[2:24:31] sometimes when the devil evates and
[2:24:32] attack the head, it spills over the
[2:24:34] children. He said all the children are
[2:24:36] just crying, messed up and said I try to
[2:24:38] gather them together, wash them, redress
[2:24:41] them. Said why I'm doing those things,
[2:24:42] I'm watching my wife.
[2:24:47] Then when I see her mellow down, he said
[2:24:50] I walk over to her and just give her a
[2:24:52] part. She doesn't know what I'm doing.
[2:24:54] But do you know what the prophet is
[2:24:55] doing? Said why parting? I'm saying Lord
[2:24:57] let your peace that is in me go to her
[2:25:00] now.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; Brethren, that shook me when I saw that.
[2:25:04] So you got to have it in you first
[2:25:06] because you can't give what you don't
[2:25:07] have. At such times you must be ready to
[2:25:10] share virtues. He said let your peace
[2:25:12] that is in me go to her now. And he said
[2:25:16] before you know it the smile start
[2:25:18] coming back her face and she will say
[2:25:20] what time does the store close? Can we
[2:25:22] pick that dress?
[2:25:26] That's not American lifestyle. Is giving
[2:25:29] you the recipe of the kingdom.
[2:25:33] May God help you. May God help me.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; Job overcame that the aggression of the
[2:25:40] devil that would have come through the
[2:25:42] wife. Then we are closing now. The
[2:25:45] friends came,
[2:25:47] the brothers in church.
[2:25:51] Job had it from every angle right from
[2:25:54] the devil. He moved through his family.
[2:25:57] Then he's coming out to the through the
[2:25:58] church.
[2:26:00] The Bible said when they were
[2:26:02] approaching the house because Joe by his
[2:26:05] condition now couldn't stay hinder he
[2:26:08] was out there
[2:26:10] the hospital has rejected him. I mean
[2:26:12] they've put him in his own personal
[2:26:14] opice
[2:26:16] just to observe him and die. So these
[2:26:18] folks came around and as they were
[2:26:20] approaching the Bible said Job was so
[2:26:23] bad until they couldn't recognize the
[2:26:25] prince again.
[2:26:28] He was so bad.
[2:26:30] And uh when they came to him, God bless
[2:26:34] you, brother Joe. And for the next seven
[2:26:37] days, read your Bible, they went into
[2:26:40] personal coma themselves. They couldn't
[2:26:42] speak because of the shock of how bad
[2:26:47] the devil has dealt with a man. They
[2:26:50] couldn't even talk for seven days. They
[2:26:53] were in awe. It was like, "Ah, is this
[2:26:57] what it is?
[2:26:59] And for the next seven days, they kept
[2:27:01] gazing. It's in your Bible. If the Bible
[2:27:04] said it, I believe it.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; Seven days they couldn't find their
[2:27:08] voice.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; Maybe your condition hasn't got enough
[2:27:15] of that because we could still see us
[2:27:18] and say, "Lord have mercy." Was what we
[2:27:21] said. He didn't take our voice. He
[2:27:23] didn't put us into coma. But this one
[2:27:26] pull them into a condition like that. So
[2:27:28] you can see there's nothing new under
[2:27:29] the sun.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; Is it challenging your faith now?
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; All right. When they found their voice,
[2:27:44] sorry brother.
[2:27:46] Sorry brother. Sorry brother. And all of
[2:27:50] them became emotional. And Jo the devil
[2:27:53] started taking over his emotion and
[2:27:56] started saying I caused the day I was
[2:27:58] born. I caused the news because he saw
[2:28:00] his own brethren. You know he was
[2:28:03] expressing himself and and the devil was
[2:28:06] saying there we go.
[2:28:08] But you remember the deal is caused God.
[2:28:12] Job caused every other thing. He refused
[2:28:14] to curse God. When he didn't do that we
[2:28:19] lost again. He said, "But with these
[2:28:21] three guys, I will rebound." Then he
[2:28:24] started walking on those guys. And the
[2:28:27] brothers changed.
[2:28:30] You know, brother,
[2:28:33] you know, brother,
[2:28:35] you know, brother, is there anything to
[2:28:37] make right?
[2:28:40] And Job said, "Well, by the grace of
[2:28:41] God, I've searched just like you were
[2:28:43] thinking. I found nothing." Don't
[2:28:46] forget, God had said Satan made him move
[2:28:49] against Job without without reason.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; But that was in the spirit realm. Nobody
[2:28:55] knew it in the church.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; And the attitude of the believer of the
[2:28:59] brethren is that when thing happens, the
[2:29:03] first thing is who sinned?
[2:29:07] When they saw that man born without
[2:29:09] eyes, born blind without eyes, the first
[2:29:11] question is pastor who us
[2:29:15] is he himself, father, mother,
[2:29:17] grandparent, generational something.
[2:29:19] That's our attitude.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; and let me tell you very strongly, as
[2:29:26] long as you you maintain such an
[2:29:29] attitude,
[2:29:31] it might be difficult for you to be a
[2:29:34] comforter to righteousness.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; You must keep an open heart. If your
[2:29:42] brother, your sister said, "I've
[2:29:44] searched myself nothing." The best you
[2:29:46] can do is to say, "Lord, help my
[2:29:48] brother.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; Help my sister." Don't come to a
[2:29:51] conclusion.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; Because the Joseph, Job's friend came to
[2:29:56] a conclusion that nobody is ever
[2:29:58] tampered with like this if nothing is
[2:30:00] wrong in their lives.
[2:30:05] The prophet taught us that the devil
[2:30:07] cannot set a foot on you to ought you to
[2:30:10] attack you to meme you until first you
[2:30:12] get out of the word is the word of the
[2:30:15] Lord but it's not the total truth.
[2:30:18] Listen to me church judge.
[2:30:20] The other side of the truth is that you
[2:30:23] may do you may not do anything and yet
[2:30:27] it will be pleasing to God to run you
[2:30:29] through the meals for his own purpose.
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't come out of it, God
[2:30:34] may relax the edge. Job never came out
[2:30:37] of the word. That was why I gave you
[2:30:38] those background. He stayed under the
[2:30:41] atonement. It was God who pulled it open
[2:30:43] for the devil to have access.
[2:30:48] And yet he didn't tell why.
[2:30:51] You can read the story in retrospect and
[2:30:53] know why. But if you were there that
[2:30:55] day, what side would you take? And I'm
[2:30:58] saying that your sight can be very
[2:31:00] dangerous and put you in anger, in wrath
[2:31:03] before God.
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; So things you don't know, keep quiet.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; Just commit it to God.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; Offer all the assistance you could and
[2:31:12] leave it there.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; Don't go home sitting in the seat of the
[2:31:16] critic
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; and say, is you see the people don't
[2:31:20] always like to repent. How can things
[2:31:22] like this happen? And you are telling me
[2:31:24] your life is right with God. That is you
[2:31:26] talking. No matter how thin you slice
[2:31:29] anything, it will always have the two
[2:31:31] sides.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; Look at the paper we use. As thin as the
[2:31:35] hedge is that you almost cannot see it
[2:31:38] visibly. Yes, it's got two sides. Amen.
[2:31:42] And that is where the message came to
[2:31:44] you and I when the prophet started the
[2:31:46] ministry, he showed him two trees,
[2:31:48] Calvinist and Armenianism. He said,
[2:31:51] "Don't nurture any of these two trees.
[2:31:53] Take the truth from here. take the truth
[2:31:55] from here and come to the middle of the
[2:31:57] road to plant the tree for the bride.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; The message came to us balanced
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; and it put us into the middle of the
[2:32:07] road because the middle of the road is
[2:32:09] the safest
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; balanced aspect of the road. If you move
[2:32:13] this side, it slants a bit. It slants a
[2:32:15] bit on this side in order not to have
[2:32:18] collection of water that could make a
[2:32:20] flood in the middle of the road. Are you
[2:32:22] getting it? So, it washes it off here.
[2:32:24] It washes it off here and it let it out
[2:32:27] through the gutters by the cover.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; So the middle of the road is the best
[2:32:32] place for you to drive.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; And somebody said if you drive in the
[2:32:35] middle of the road, you will crash.
[2:32:39] Is because that fellow has no
[2:32:40] understanding of the journey.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; We are traveling on one way.
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; We don't go back. We only keep going
[2:32:50] forward. Amen.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; When that man left Jer Jerusalem and was
[2:32:53] coming to Jericho, he met bandits that
[2:32:56] almost destroyed the life. Amen. We keep
[2:33:00] going ascending to Jerusalem. We don't
[2:33:02] come back to Jericho. So, it's a oneway
[2:33:04] road. So, it's safe to drive in the
[2:33:06] middle of the road. Get your vehicle
[2:33:09] balanced and slam on the throttle.
[2:33:12] Praise God.
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; It was this revelation these brothers
[2:33:17] don't have. And once your foundation,
[2:33:21] your premise of impression is wrong, all
[2:33:24] your contributions will be wrong. Even
[2:33:27] though you are quoting the scriptures or
[2:33:30] the message, listen to me. The
[2:33:32] scriptures you are quoting is not wrong.
[2:33:35] The message, the spoken word you are
[2:33:37] quoting is not wrong. But your
[2:33:39] application of it will be so wrong. And
[2:33:42] instead of offering a blessing, it will
[2:33:44] offer more disaster because it is
[2:33:47] premised on the wrong assumption. Amen.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[2:33:52] For 30 chapters or so, 28 to 30
[2:33:55] chapters, these brethren kept pounding
[2:33:57] Job.
[2:33:59] I want to summarize it so you can go.
[2:34:01] They kept pounding Job so hard
[2:34:06] until they wanted to break that man. But
[2:34:08] brother said the man couldn't be broken.
[2:34:11] You know why? Because he knew he was
[2:34:13] under the blood. He knew he met all
[2:34:16] requirements.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When a man comes under the
[2:34:19] blood and he met God's requirement,
[2:34:23] sermons don't send you out of the
[2:34:24] church,
[2:34:26] there's no word that condemns you. Even
[2:34:29] if it visits your life is to give you a
[2:34:31] thanksgiving
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; and they reshape it.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; That man stood still because he met
[2:34:36] God's requirement and his friends were
[2:34:38] mad at him, but he retained his ground
[2:34:41] and the whole thing became a mess. Read
[2:34:44] your Bible. Miserable comforters.
[2:34:48] When everything has become a mess, God
[2:34:51] knew when to come down.
[2:34:55] But before he could come down, he sent
[2:34:57] one man called
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; Elio,
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; a young man. You remember that?
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because even though Job was
[2:35:04] consolidating his blessings by his
[2:35:06] trial, yet this brethren refused to let
[2:35:09] go.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; It was in his trial that his revelation
[2:35:12] went higher. He had more value than he
[2:35:15] had more revelation. Job had preached
[2:35:18] about resurrection but you know
[2:35:19] throughout his resurrection preaching he
[2:35:22] couldn't preach about human
[2:35:23] resurrection. Read your Bible. He said
[2:35:25] when a tree dies he can live again. Then
[2:35:27] the church member said how about us? He
[2:35:30] said we are waiting for the revelation.
[2:35:32] But that revelation came in the hour of
[2:35:34] his trial benefits in trial. I know my
[2:35:38] redeemer liveth. Amen.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Ara said the friends move him to
[2:35:42] the darkest hour and God had to do
[2:35:45] something and he showed him the mind of
[2:35:48] God and he reflected the future until
[2:35:50] Job not only see the redeemer whom he
[2:35:53] called the redeemer before he did the
[2:35:55] redemption.
[2:35:56] [Music]
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; It was because he saw it. He not only
[2:35:59] saw the redeemer resurrected, he saw
[2:36:02] himself also resurrected in a better
[2:36:04] body. And he said, "Though the skin
[2:36:06] worms destroyed this body, yet in my
[2:36:08] flesh shall I see the Lord whom I shall
[2:36:10] behold another another." Then in his
[2:36:13] trouble, he went back to the church. He
[2:36:14] said, "Now we have answer to the
[2:36:16] resurrection of man." Still in his
[2:36:18] trouble. And the devil rebounded again
[2:36:22] until Elu came down. And when Elu came
[2:36:25] down, he put
[2:36:28] Job in his place. He put his friends in
[2:36:30] his place. He repaired the altar.
[2:36:32] Changed the atmosphere. Then my God came
[2:36:35] down.
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; He will come through for you. When Jesus
[2:36:42] comes, the tempter's power is broken.
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; He will take the gloom. He will fill the
[2:36:46] life with glory. Everything is bound to
[2:36:48] turn around for better when he comes. He
[2:36:51] will always come. Wait for him. Those
[2:36:54] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[2:36:56] their strength. They shall mount up with
[2:36:58] wings as an eagle. They shall run and
[2:37:01] not be weary. They shall walk and not
[2:37:03] faint. Lord, teach me to wait.
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; Learn to wait upon the Lord because he
[2:37:08] will certainly come true.
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[2:37:12] &gt;&gt; Last line,
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; when God came down,
[2:37:18] God told the three brothers,
[2:37:21] this your 30, 28 or to 30 chapters of
[2:37:25] sermon was a waste of time.
[2:37:29] Read your Bible. I'm using contemporary
[2:37:32] language
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; because when God said you have not
[2:37:35] represented me well, what does it mean?
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; You preached empty sermons
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; that did not projected Christ.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; It's a waste of time.
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; And because you haven't represented me
[2:37:49] well, I am annoyed with you.
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; God told them,
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; I am annoyed. My wroth is upon you.
[2:37:57] Did they quote the word? Go and read
[2:37:59] some of their statements. They are
[2:38:01] powerful,
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; real wisdom. I challenge you to read
[2:38:05] them. Powerful words. Why will God
[2:38:07] summarize all those powerful statements
[2:38:10] as a poor representation of him? Because
[2:38:13] it was premised on wrong impression.
[2:38:18] That is why I said the spoken word
[2:38:20] quotations are perfect. The scripture
[2:38:22] quotations are perfect. But when you
[2:38:25] misapply them,
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:38:29] That lifegiving resource become a
[2:38:31] poison. That is why brother said before
[2:38:33] you can take anything as a truth even
[2:38:36] though it's coming from the word it must
[2:38:39] not be misinterpreted
[2:38:41] mislocated misrepresented.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; Watch those three things brothers.
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; That's how to build a total church.
[2:38:52] So he said you haven't represented me
[2:38:54] well. Now this brother you called a
[2:38:56] secret sinner. Now you go to him and
[2:39:00] they say what for sir for prayer
[2:39:06] sir you you you mean you mean
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; brother Job will lay hands on us said
[2:39:11] perfectly.
[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what I'm saying.
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:39:16] &gt;&gt; If if it's a complicated seal for you
[2:39:18] I've opened it.
[2:39:20] So believe it now.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; You go to him to pray for you. So let me
[2:39:25] warn you only his prayer
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; will I accept.
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; So in case in case you want to feel
[2:39:34] spiritual by going to pastor CL
[2:39:38] you are wasting your time. Go to pastor
[2:39:41] Job.
[2:39:42] Don't go to pastor Moses.
[2:39:46] His prayer is good, but it's not going
[2:39:48] to work for you right now.
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; The one whose prayer I want to hear upon
[2:39:52] you is that of Job. Pastor Joe,
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; the man you call secret sinner
[2:40:00] holds the monopoly
[2:40:02] for your pardon.
[2:40:07] Now you think Job have had trials,
[2:40:10] right? This is his biggest test.
[2:40:17] This is the test that will challenge the
[2:40:19] love of God in his heart. If you truly
[2:40:22] have the love of God, you will have a
[2:40:25] forgiven spirit.
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; Did you hear me?
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; Whether people ask for it or not,
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; you are more willing to forgive. That is
[2:40:36] why brother Arab said when your brother
[2:40:39] does you wrong, listen to me. He said
[2:40:42] you make excuse for them before God and
[2:40:45] say he didn't mean to do it.
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; It's a quotation.
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; It's a quotation.
[2:40:52] If you want me to give you, I will give
[2:40:53] you to bro Moses will give you to save
[2:40:55] your time. Did you hear me?
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; He said you make excuse for them that
[2:41:01] they didn't mean to do it.
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; If you come on that premise, will you
[2:41:05] have problem with anybody?
[2:41:10] Brother said, "If you hold art in your
[2:41:13] heart, you are walking over the dangers
[2:41:15] of hell fire."
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; Don't scratch the wound of your heart
[2:41:22] too deep. That is what makes you to be
[2:41:24] unforgiving.
[2:41:27] &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said?
[2:41:29] Forgiveness will be very natural to a
[2:41:32] converted gentile bride of Christ.
[2:41:35] Because when he was opening the seals
[2:41:37] for us, he came to the fifth seals souls
[2:41:40] under the altar. He said the very very
[2:41:43] first idea for me to know that this
[2:41:46] cannot be the gentile bread material is
[2:41:49] the way they were asking for vengeance.
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; Turn it another way. It means that the
[2:41:55] gentile bride materials will naturally
[2:41:58] not have it in them to seek for
[2:42:00] vengeance.
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. M
[2:42:05] &gt;&gt; help us Lord.
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; You are going to leave here and go and
[2:42:08] reconcile with those people you have
[2:42:09] written off
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; you don't want to talk to again if you
[2:42:12] want to be a Christian.
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; Because I will tell you this afternoon
[2:42:17] that the reason it will be so easy for
[2:42:19] the gentile bride to easily forgive is
[2:42:23] that they came themselves
[2:42:26] they were born under the powerful
[2:42:29] utterance of forgiveness.
[2:42:32] Brother Abraham said, "Those Hebrew
[2:42:35] patriarchs
[2:42:36] when they were being born, whatever
[2:42:39] their mammas uttered in the pains of
[2:42:42] delivery, positionally place them in
[2:42:45] their inheritance." And as powerful as
[2:42:48] Joshua was, he couldn't come out of that
[2:42:52] utterance to divide the lands in the
[2:42:56] land of promise to give each person a
[2:42:58] location. He was guided by the
[2:43:00] utterances of their mother in the pins
[2:43:02] of delivery.
[2:43:03] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with the prophet?
[2:43:06] &gt;&gt; You agree with the prophet?
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; Then do you also realize that for your
[2:43:09] new birth you had a mother too?
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[2:43:13] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; How come you think it's my father, my
[2:43:19] mother, my sister, her my brother? Do
[2:43:21] you have the revelation of that? Who are
[2:43:23] you referring to?
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Right. said, you say it's
[2:43:27] everything to you. And when Jesus our
[2:43:31] Lord is described as the El Shadai, what
[2:43:33] do you think El Shadai means? The
[2:43:36] breasted one. Do you describe a man as
[2:43:38] the breasted one?
[2:43:41] &gt;&gt; That is the feminism of God, the
[2:43:43] motherhood of God.
[2:43:44] &gt;&gt; El shall die.
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh,
[2:43:49] &gt;&gt; brother Abraham said when you get tired,
[2:43:51] when you get so so worked up and weary,
[2:43:53] you can go to the bosom of your papa, of
[2:43:56] your mama, and nurse yourself back to
[2:43:58] life.
[2:43:59] &gt;&gt; El Shai.
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:44:04] &gt;&gt; So if it was El Shai, then it's your
[2:44:06] mama.
[2:44:08] And he told the disciples when the
[2:44:10] Greeks were saying we will see Jesus. He
[2:44:13] said the Greeks the Gentile cannot see
[2:44:14] me until my glorification. Meaning until
[2:44:17] my burial, until my death, burial,
[2:44:19] resurrection, ascension before ascension
[2:44:22] and final ascension, the Gentiles will
[2:44:24] not see me. So you came by the birth of
[2:44:28] Calvary.
[2:44:30] &gt;&gt; Gethsemane was God's labor room for you.
[2:44:33] When it became ripe for your delivery,
[2:44:36] he went to the cross of Calvary.
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; Satan wanted to your delivery.
[2:44:42] Brother Arab said Christ went with you
[2:44:44] in him to Calvary.
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; He wanted to your delivery by
[2:44:48] suggesting autotopedic surgery instead
[2:44:51] of Cesaria.
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; That was why he made the soldiers to
[2:44:54] pick armor to break the legs of the
[2:44:57] thieves. But when they came to Jesus,
[2:44:59] the surgery was already began because
[2:45:02] Jesus was already under anesthesia. They
[2:45:05] said he is dead
[2:45:08] and God said, "You are dump. We are in
[2:45:10] the theater for CS. You are carrying
[2:45:13] armor. What's wrong with you? Drop that
[2:45:15] armor
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; and pick the right instrument." Then he
[2:45:18] had to take the spear,
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; the needle for surgery
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; and went to the side
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; and we saw element of birth. Blood and
[2:45:26] water came out.
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; Then who has came out? Who came out
[2:45:30] after that?
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; That was where you were born.
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:37] &gt;&gt; Now when your mama was giving birth to
[2:45:39] you, what was he saying before he went
[2:45:43] under an estasia? Father
[2:45:46] forgive them. This man has revelation.
[2:45:50] Father forgive them for they know not
[2:45:53] what they were doing. You were born
[2:45:55] under the birth pain or forgiveness.
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; So you cannot be born under death and
[2:46:02] not have a forgiven spirit. Forgiveness
[2:46:04] is your placement in life. So if you
[2:46:08] claim an unforgiven spirit, it's a very
[2:46:11] evidence that you are not yet born again
[2:46:14] by Calvary.
[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:18] &gt;&gt; And if you have an unforgiven spirit,
[2:46:20] you are the problem of yourself. Yes,
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; you are the hindrance to your life
[2:46:24] &gt;&gt; because the Lord said, "If you forgive,
[2:46:26] I forgive you."
[2:46:28] &gt;&gt; Let's close by this.
[2:46:30] These friends of Job accepted the
[2:46:34] verdict of the word and they came to
[2:46:36] Job. But imagine if Job had said, "Ah,
[2:46:39] you earth me so bad. You hurt me so
[2:46:42] bad." And he kept scratching the wound
[2:46:44] of the earth. The more you scratch, the
[2:46:47] more bloody it becomes. Do you realize
[2:46:49] that? And the more you are peeling the
[2:46:51] layers of the skin. If you are not
[2:46:52] careful, you will peel it to the bone
[2:46:54] and it becomes is become more difficult
[2:46:57] for you to heal.
[2:46:58] &gt;&gt; The reason some of you are not healing
[2:47:00] is that you don't look at the right
[2:47:01] place. You always scratching the wound.
[2:47:05] &gt;&gt; Stop scratching the wound.
[2:47:07] &gt;&gt; Leave the wound alone.
[2:47:09] &gt;&gt; Let God apply his bomb in there. And
[2:47:11] some of you say, "But you get the
[2:47:13] prophet said, I can forgive and not
[2:47:15] forget."
[2:47:18] It's only God that has the capacity to
[2:47:20] forget. I agree with you 100% is the
[2:47:22] word. But do you understand the word?
[2:47:26] I challenge your understanding of that
[2:47:28] word. If you truly forgive,
[2:47:32] it will take the pain out of your
[2:47:34] memory.
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:35] &gt;&gt; If something has happened, it has
[2:47:37] happened.
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; But when you remember it with a feeling
[2:47:40] of all hatred and anger, you haven't
[2:47:43] forgiven.
[2:47:45] When you remember it later with the
[2:47:47] feeling of joy, thank God for taking us
[2:47:49] out of this.
[2:47:50] &gt;&gt; Then it shows you are truly forgiven.
[2:47:52] &gt;&gt; So in your not forgetting, there is no
[2:47:54] pain in your memory.
[2:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:56] &gt;&gt; That is the true deliverance.
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; If Job failed to do that, see what
[2:48:03] happened. Job 42:10.
[2:48:06] That's the last line.
[2:48:09] I hope it's been a blessing to you.
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Thank you for your
[2:48:14] patience. Amen.
[2:48:20] Job chapter 2. Chapter 42. I mean
[2:48:23] chapter 42.
[2:48:26] Let's let's read from verse 9. Are you
[2:48:30] there?
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; So Haleifas the Temonite and Build the
[2:48:35] Shuite and Zofa the Namatite went and
[2:48:39] did according as the Lord commanded
[2:48:42] them.
[2:48:43] The Lord also accepted Job. What he did
[2:48:47] for his friends, the Lord accepted.
[2:48:50] Are you here? Now, let's watch verse 10.
[2:48:54] At this moment that God came down, there
[2:48:56] have been a stop. God has put a stop to
[2:48:59] the action of the devil. But even though
[2:49:01] there have been a stop, Job has never
[2:49:03] received any recovery.
[2:49:07] Now watch.
[2:49:10] And the Lord turned the captiv captivity
[2:49:13] of Job when he did what?
[2:49:16] &gt;&gt; When he prayed for his friends.
[2:49:19] &gt;&gt; Meaning up till that moment his
[2:49:21] captivity remained.
[2:49:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you ma'am.
[2:49:28] &gt;&gt; And you cannot pray and the Lord will
[2:49:31] accept like he said the Lord accepted it
[2:49:33] if it does not come with love and
[2:49:35] forgiveness. He released them from his
[2:49:37] heart.
[2:49:39] So when you release people, you are
[2:49:41] actually releasing yourself.
[2:49:44] &gt;&gt; You are refusing to short change your
[2:49:47] life.
[2:49:49] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[2:49:51] Now watch. And also
[2:49:54] the Lord gave Job twice as much as he
[2:49:58] had before.
[2:50:03] It was after prayer, after forgiveness,
[2:50:07] after Job overcame and passed the final
[2:50:10] test.
[2:50:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:12] &gt;&gt; That he received total recovery.
[2:50:15] &gt;&gt; So let me ask you, why did Job went
[2:50:17] through all this
[2:50:21] just for God to purge him and prepare
[2:50:25] him with the character and maturity to
[2:50:28] handle a blessing greater than he ever
[2:50:31] had.
[2:50:34] Brother Abraham said, "Power with
[2:50:36] character is fit to rule."
[2:50:39] &gt;&gt; Before God can place you in a position,
[2:50:41] he works on your character.
[2:50:44] &gt;&gt; He caused David to be anointed,
[2:50:47] but he wasn't installed
[2:50:50] until after seven or eight years over
[2:50:52] Judah and 15 years over Israel. Why was
[2:50:56] God eager to anoint him and not eager to
[2:51:00] install him? Because between the time of
[2:51:03] his anointing and installation, Jo must
[2:51:07] be prepared
[2:51:09] &gt;&gt; for the throne, for the power.
[2:51:12] &gt;&gt; His anointing is to witness to him his
[2:51:14] purpose in life.
[2:51:16] &gt;&gt; But before he could come into that
[2:51:18] purpose, he needs character. That was
[2:51:20] why you go read Job, David went through
[2:51:23] all the tests. God delivered Saul to him
[2:51:26] twice
[2:51:28] &gt;&gt; and twice he passed the exams.
[2:51:30] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:51:31] &gt;&gt; Building his character. He came to
[2:51:33] Zigglac where he was under pressure yet
[2:51:36] under pressure. David refused to act
[2:51:38] under pressure. He asked for effort. He
[2:51:41] wanted to know the will of God even if
[2:51:43] it at the cost of his family.
[2:51:47] &gt;&gt; That was a man prepared for the throne.
[2:51:50] &gt;&gt; We're going to rule and reign. Brethren.
[2:51:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right now we are even ruling
[2:51:54] and reigning.
[2:51:55] &gt;&gt; The power of spoken word is going to be
[2:51:57] demonstrated.
[2:51:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:51:59] &gt;&gt; In full measure
[2:52:00] &gt;&gt; and you have a part in it. That's the
[2:52:02] promise of the word.
[2:52:04] &gt;&gt; But God will not entrust you.
[2:52:07] God will not entrust you before he
[2:52:09] trusts you. He must trust you first.
[2:52:12] &gt;&gt; And the way to bring trust is to walk
[2:52:15] upon your character.
[2:52:17] &gt;&gt; So that because the bride must know what
[2:52:19] to do with the word and the power of
[2:52:21] God.
[2:52:22] Job was a millionaire. God wanted him to
[2:52:25] be a billionaire. And the character to
[2:52:28] handle million is different from that
[2:52:30] &gt;&gt; of billion. The maturity, the wisdom for
[2:52:33] it are completely different. This was
[2:52:36] the only reason Job went through that.
[2:52:39] By the time he came out, he was more
[2:52:40] than ready
[2:52:42] &gt;&gt; for double portion.
[2:52:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:52:44] &gt;&gt; Whatever you are going through, God has
[2:52:46] a purpose.
[2:52:47] &gt;&gt; They are not designed to consume you.
[2:52:49] They are to prepare you for a greater
[2:52:51] visitation to make you a blessing to
[2:52:54] somebody who will need it. The prophet
[2:52:57] said God healed a sister who was playing
[2:52:59] a piano of a cancer to become a blessing
[2:53:02] to another person who will go through
[2:53:04] it. That was why when that person came
[2:53:06] through the prayer line, Brother Arab
[2:53:08] told her, "You don't need my hand. You
[2:53:10] need the hand of that sister
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; because she's been healed of the same
[2:53:14] thing. Now you go to her
[2:53:16] &gt;&gt; and let her pray for you and I shall say
[2:53:18] amen." and the sister was healed.
[2:53:21] &gt;&gt; David went through the challenges of
[2:53:22] beer and lion in order to prepare him to
[2:53:26] be the savior or the deliverer for the
[2:53:29] entire church so that somebody could
[2:53:31] say, "I know." And when Golth came, it
[2:53:35] was only him who could stand out because
[2:53:37] he's been through things. God has a
[2:53:40] purpose in all his wisdom for whatever
[2:53:42] he permits. Let's just trust him
[2:53:45] &gt;&gt; that the strength of Israel can never
[2:53:47] fail. He knows what he's doing. And if
[2:53:50] we wait upon him, it will come clear and
[2:53:52] we shall be victorious. I leave you into
[2:53:55] the hands of your savior. God bless you.
[2:53:59] [Applause]
[2:54:07] God bless you. Thank you so much.
[2:54:10] Amen.
[2:54:26] Bless you, sir. Thank you so much.
[2:54:34] [Music]
[2:54:38] I don't know where to start. I don't
[2:54:40] know where to end.
[2:54:42] It's just wonderful. Amen.
[2:54:45] &gt;&gt; God has been so good to us.
[2:54:48] &gt;&gt; God knows what we have need of
[2:54:52] &gt;&gt; and I think
[2:54:57] God God sent his servant here because he
[2:55:01] he knows what we are going through
[2:55:04] and just want to say thank you for his
[2:55:07] grace. you know um
[2:55:10] as touched that that that subject of job
[2:55:13] at the beginning as a minister sometimes
[2:55:16] it's it's a hard to to to speak about it
[2:55:20] because it's about suffering no one
[2:55:22] likes suffering as he mentioned at some
[2:55:26] point if if we knew and so want to go
[2:55:29] and god testify about you know we will
[2:55:32] not raise our hand because humanly
[2:55:34] speaking we don't like that
[2:55:37] but do you know that suffering
[2:55:41] as I look at if you allow me to say a
[2:55:43] few words here give me five minutes and
[2:55:46] my children as they're young I don't
[2:55:49] talk to them about suffering you know
[2:55:52] life is good and everything is good and
[2:55:55] positive and everything it's just just
[2:55:58] everything they're just in that
[2:56:01] young age they don't understand they're
[2:56:03] just living their life the first thing
[2:56:05] they're thinking about playing and
[2:56:07] everything and eating and how what are
[2:56:09] you going to eat today and but as they
[2:56:12] grow up and they become mature
[2:56:16] there's a point where I have to address
[2:56:18] them you know what life is not that easy
[2:56:22] you know it you have to face things
[2:56:25] so put that in the spiritual realm when
[2:56:28] God start talking to you about suffering
[2:56:32] it means he knows that you are mature
[2:56:36] that's why He started by saying Job Job
[2:56:39] was perfect means he already arrived at
[2:56:42] the perfection that all we want to be.
[2:56:46] But if you want to be really a strong
[2:56:49] believer, strong rugged Christian,
[2:56:53] you have to have the revelation
[2:56:57] of what suffering, what's the place of
[2:57:00] suffering in a Christian life.
[2:57:03] Then Satan becomes
[2:57:07] [Music]
[2:57:09] powerless because you have now the
[2:57:12] revelation
[2:57:13] of what suffering means. Means the tool
[2:57:16] that the Satan can use to defeat you, he
[2:57:21] can't use it on you anymore.
[2:57:23] Amen. Because if it's just a young
[2:57:27] believer, any small suffering, he would
[2:57:30] put you away, right? But as you got age
[2:57:33] around you protect you but when you
[2:57:36] become mature the only thing the devil
[2:57:39] can use it suffering because he cannot
[2:57:42] bring you to deny the word of God
[2:57:46] he won't he won't come and tell the
[2:57:48] message is wrong no you know that it's
[2:57:50] the truth the only place he can come is
[2:57:53] on your suffering as you go through life
[2:57:56] and you will point to different thing as
[2:57:58] the as the servant has point will point
[2:58:01] to the pastor will point to the
[2:58:03] believers, they point to the situation
[2:58:05] you're going through, you point to your
[2:58:07] family, different things happening, but
[2:58:11] you stay looking to Jesus Christ and
[2:58:14] say, "God is in control of everything."
[2:58:18] That's the capstone revelation. I like
[2:58:21] that. That's the capstone revelation.
[2:58:24] God, help me as you have opened my eyes
[2:58:27] today to have that capstone revelation.
[2:58:32] Amen. Is that is that something you can
[2:58:35] God help me to maintain that capstone
[2:58:38] revelation? No matter the circumstances,
[2:58:42] let me be the true worshipper no matter
[2:58:46] the circumstances.
[2:58:48] Is that the desire of your heart? The
[2:58:50] prophet will say at one place I think
[2:58:52] how can I overcome? The best thing that
[2:58:55] can happen to you as an overcomer is a
[2:58:58] test.
[2:59:00] The best thing
[2:59:02] after salvation test
[2:59:05] because the test is not to tempt you to
[2:59:07] put you down. The test is to prove
[2:59:11] that who you are really are. And God can
[2:59:14] never give you a test beyond what you
[2:59:16] can sustain. Amen. God bless you. I
[2:59:19] really may God bless his servant. May
[2:59:22] God bless the word that we heard this
[2:59:24] morning.
[2:59:27] Amen.
[2:59:29] I was thinking I don't want to say in
[2:59:31] the wrong way but I love the Lord Jesus
[2:59:34] Christ and he has been so good to me.
[2:59:36] Amen.
[2:59:39] I I just appreciate the minister if if
[2:59:41] he has to come if the Lord terries
[2:59:44] brother D hopefully he he can pastor
[2:59:47] Taylor if he can hear me next time when
[2:59:50] he's coming if he has an opportunity to
[2:59:52] come to Canada we don't want him to
[2:59:54] forget us. May he put us in his plan for
[2:59:58] another Saturday, for another Sunday,
[3:00:01] God willing. Amen. If we have three
[3:00:03] services, even Sunday evening as well.
[3:00:07] May God bless him richly. Amen. Amen.
[3:00:10] Amen. Amen. Can you think about it? May
[3:00:13] God help us.

[3:05:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let's just everybody just
[3:05:05] speak to your Lord in your own way. Tell
[3:05:06] him a few words. I know we have ext.
[3:05:11] But just talk to the Lord for what you
[3:05:13] have heard. Lord, make me that rugged
[3:05:17] strong Christian.
[3:05:20] Not a transitional believer, but a real
[3:05:24] Christian that loves you from the bottom
[3:05:27] of my heart. Despite the circumstances,
[3:05:29] the situations, the trials, make me a
[3:05:32] strong believer. Speak to you, Lord, in
[3:05:35] this moment that we give him.

[3:08:58] and for the church.
[3:09:02] You know, in order to have the crown,
[3:09:05] you can't reign because character is a
[3:09:09] victory.
[3:09:11] needs to go sometimes through some
[3:09:12] suffering that he allows in his divine
[3:09:14] love but we know the outcome it will be
[3:09:18] victory. Amen.
[3:09:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[3:09:24] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we want to give you thanks
[3:09:28] and praise for the word of God that we
[3:09:30] have heard this morning. Thank you Lord.
[3:09:34] Thank you Lord. May we go from this
[3:09:37] place blessed and may we ponder over
[3:09:40] those things Lord Jesus that pertain to
[3:09:42] us and Lord most of these things pertain
[3:09:45] to us. We pray oh God that we might be
[3:09:48] faithful in service for Jesus. We thank
[3:09:53] you for everyone that has come out. May
[3:09:56] your blessing rest upon each one in
[3:09:58] Jesus name. Amen.
[3:10:01] &gt;&gt; And the church said
[3:10:02] &gt;&gt; amen. Hallelujah.
[3:10:05] Amen.
[3:10:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[3:10:14] &gt;&gt; That's my pastor. Amen. Always
[3:10:16] energetic. Amen. Praise be to God. Amen.
[3:10:20] I will be singing that song that sister
[3:10:22] Grace sang yesterday. Wonderful. It was
[3:10:24] a good special yesterday. And it's not
[3:10:27] our battle. Is the the Lord's battle.
[3:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we put it down? The the Lord's
[3:10:33] battle. Help
[3:10:37] [Music]
[3:10:41] me now. These are souls
[3:10:46] in times of need.
[3:10:49] Oh, that gives me hope,
[3:10:53] [Music]
[3:10:55] that brings me peace.
[3:10:59] In every trial,
[3:11:03] through every test,
[3:11:08] my savior stands
[3:11:12] in my defense.
[3:11:15] [Music]
[3:11:16] So when the world
[3:11:20] leaves you tired and warm
[3:11:25] and all your strength is gone
[3:11:29] and your heart feels.
[3:11:33] &gt;&gt; Remember, remember God
[3:11:37] is greater than resto.
[3:11:42] Take courage for
[3:11:46] the battle is the Lord.
[3:11:50] And when the waters rise,
[3:11:55] he calls my name.
[3:11:59] &gt;&gt; He beats me
[3:12:03] out on the wind.
[3:12:07] He holds my hand.
[3:12:12] lest I should falter
[3:12:16] and makes me stand
[3:12:20] out on the water.
[3:12:24] So old
[3:12:26] when the road you are tired
[3:12:32] and your strength is gone
[3:12:36] &gt;&gt; and your heart feels.
