[31:24] in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Thank you Lord. Thank you Jesus. Amen. Amen. That's certainly our
[31:32] desire man for God to move on and just bring us to a higher level. We invite pastor Boris and pastor
[31:39] Boris it has been our desire to for him to come here and um he's very busy and but he took some
[31:46] time to have fellowship with us. It's one of the rare of the of the rare people pastor Zigz
[31:53] recommended just think about it brother Moses make sure that he comes because he preached for us so
[32:00] well last time he still remembers the title most of the time or all the content. So we are I'm glad
[32:07] that I managed to bring him and you're going to be blessed. If your heart is open and expecting, God
[32:14] is going to bless us and just want to invite him. Let's sing the chorus as we invite the word and
[32:20] pastor Boris. Amen. [Music] Higher ground again. Just bring it in the chorus. Lord, lift me up

[32:59] May God bless you. May be seated. Um certainly a great privilege to be
[33:05] here again. And uh uh Pastor Moses has been very perseverant to have me here.
[33:15] I really didn't expect to travel uh this time, but I uh um just thankful to God for the opportunity
[33:25] to be here tonight. Amen. And uh uh to hear what Pastor Zav just said. I'm thinking,
[33:33] what can I do? I'm not a good preacher. If God doesn't come and help us tonight, it's going
[33:38] to be a disaster. Amen. So we are just trusting on the Lord to do something to give us something that
[33:46] to give us strength. Amen. And uh you know it's not easy when it comes to preach. Sometimes you
[33:52] don't know what to talk about. You know there are so many sermons and you don't know what's
[33:58] God want his people to hear at that particular moment. But the Holy Ghost knows and that reason
[34:05] we trust him that he will do what no man can do. Amen. And um so I'm from uh Winnipeg and
[34:14] um the church called Mount Zion Tabernacle. We have a pastor Moses came on our dedication and
[34:20] delivered a very wonderful service. Everybody remember on how to come to church expecting
[34:24] with a big big mug, not a small cup to get as much as you can. I'm hoping that somebody tonight have
[34:32] come with a very big big mug to receive more from the Lord. Amen. Well, God bless you. Um
[34:38] tonight I was just thinking I was struggling with so many things uh when what to preach. I thought
[34:43] maybe I'll give a message a foundation today with a message that will preach tomorrow. But
[34:49] then at the last minute my mind changed uh to bring something just to be of an encouragement
[34:57] um for each and every one of us. And um you know sometimes say I want to bring a message that will
[35:04] make you feel good. Hallelujah. If I can make you feel good tonight, I'll just be thankful
[35:10] to God. Amen. You love that? Amen. Praise be to God. Let us stand. We are going to read the word
[35:19] and we are going to go to Genesis chapter 47.
[35:25] Thank you musician. God bless you.
[35:31] Genesis chapter 47 and uh we are going to go to verse 8 to 9.
[35:47] And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, "How old thou thou?" And Jacob said unto Pharaoh,
[35:53] "The days of the years of my pilgrimage are 130 years. Few and evil have the days of the years
[36:02] of my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in
[36:09] the days of the pilgrimage. Uh we can go again to Hebrews chapter 11 and we can take verse 13.
[36:33] These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them a far off,
[36:39] and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims
[36:46] on the earth. Let us pray. Our gracious heavenly father, we thank you once again, oh Lord, for this
[36:54] opportunity we have to come into your house. Lord, as King David said, his heart rejoiced when he was
[37:01] asked to go to the house of the Lord. Father, he was a busy man. He was a king. He had his army,
[37:08] his government, and so many people. He had his wives and different things, Lord. But he said his
[37:14] heart rejoice when he was asked to go to the house of the Lord. Amen. Not when he was in the meetings
[37:19] with his generals, but when he was in the house of the Lord and we believe almighty God to this
[37:24] afternoon. That's how we feel. We are so happy to be in your house. Lord, may you now come and meet
[37:30] with each and everyone because you made a promise and I said if two or three are gathered in your
[37:36] name, you shall be in the midst. And we believe, Father God, right now you are here. May you touch
[37:42] our lives, Lord. Speak to us, Father. I'm not a good preacher. come and minister unto all
[37:47] of us. We want to hear from you, almighty God. My words will never bring life, but yours will bring
[37:53] life. Yours will bring change. Yours will bring happiness, healing, and deliverance. That's why
[38:00] Lord, we need you right now. Come, Lord, and have thy own ways. We commit the whole service in your
[38:06] hands. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, we have prayed. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[38:13] seated. Um so my message tonight is uh the years of our pilgrimage on earth and uh this message
[38:24] uh I brought it on the Thanksgiving day but I thought maybe uh because we are in thanksgiving
[38:33] it's a a different way of looking at thanksgiving and um uh the Bible says in all things give thanks
[38:40] unto the Lord. Amen. And sometimes we don't look at things the same way. Amen. And um so Jacob here
[38:49] is uh he he has he has called his the days of his life on earth as a pilgrimage. So he view himself
[38:58] as in a temporary uh journey towards a final destination because if you are a pilgrim that mean
[39:05] you came from somewhere you are going somewhere. Amen. So you have a clear place where you came
[39:11] from and a clear destination where you are going. So he knew where he was coming from. He knew where
[39:17] he was going. So Jacob call his earthly life as a pilgrimage. Amen. And I believe that we all of
[39:23] us here we identify ourselves that pilgrimage as pilgrims. So if we are pilgrims, we need to
[39:30] know where did we come from and where are we going and what are we doing here during our pilgrimage.
[39:37] So the destination here of our pilgrimage is not when you have more money or when you build a lot
[39:43] of houses or after you get married you say no now I can relax I'm happy you know that's not the
[39:50] destination amen we are going to talk about the destination today like Abraham God called Abraham
[39:58] uh from the city the land of of the child is and then he called me to go uh to a place and he he
[40:06] left his homeland. He was going to a city uh whose builder and Maker was God himself. And if
[40:12] he didn't know where he was going, but he was just led by God. God had given him a promise.
[40:19] Abraham was called unconditionally. Amen. And that uh covenant has been passed over unto uh Isaac his
[40:28] son. And the same covenant has been passed over also unto his uh Jacob, his grand his grandson.
[40:35] So Jacob knew that as a child of Isaac, as a child of grandchild of Abraham, he was under a covenant.
[40:43] He knew that there was a blessing following him. Amen. So um what I'm saying the message, my life
[40:50] story say all of us are pilgrims and strangers on this earth. We are seeking a city to come whose
[40:58] builder and maker is God. Amen. Amen. Amen. So we don't belong here. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. We are
[41:06] not of this world. As we used to sing, this world is not my hope. Yes, I'm just passing through.
[41:13] Amen. So, we are pilgrims and strangers here on earth. You know, sometime when you are young,
[41:18] you you don't feel it. But sometime when you're getting older, you start feeling that my days
[41:24] are coming closer and closer and closer. So, the reality of destination start becoming real. Amen.
[41:31] And when you are still 18 years old, you don't realize you're a pilgrim. But when you turn 50,
[41:36] 60, 65, 70, you start realizing that I'm I'm going I'm I'm nearing the end of my years on earth. So
[41:44] here, Jacob was here talking about his life. You know, Jacob has gone he has gone through a very
[41:50] rough life. But now he has come before Pharaoh because he was coming as uh uh Joseph called him
[41:58] uh you know he came and Joseph introduced him to Pharaoh and Pharaoh this is my dad. I said oh okay
[42:04] dad how are you doing? How old are you dad? He said I'm 130 years old and he said the days of
[42:12] my pilgrimage are 130 years and he identify his years as few compared to his father and to his
[42:20] grandfather and as evil. Amen. So we are going to look a little bit the life of Jacob to see
[42:28] few things because he's acknowledged that some of the days of his journey have been dark has
[42:35] not been pleasant you know and um this is what I want to focus on tonight so um but when I'm
[42:43] saying the message Israel and the church I'm just laying a foundation here before I'm I get into my
[42:47] message going in a strange land that you know nothing about That's Christianity. Separating
[42:56] from the things of the world because God has called you going to into another land to dwell
[43:03] among people that you know nothing about. To be a pilgrim. Amen. When I think of it, I can just
[43:11] hardly hold myself down. Pilgrim, stranger. You know, sometime people don't realize we are pilgrim
[43:17] and strangers. That's right. We forget that. We think we belong here. We don't belong here. Amen.
[43:23] We are a different people. We are peculiar nation. Hallelujah. So he said old Jacob in dying standing
[43:32] before Pharaoh he said I have been so many years in my pilgrimage. Amen. What was he? He began to
[43:40] come to himself. The little fellow had done so bad. He knew that he was only a pilgrim here.
[43:50] Amen. Amen. So Jack B say he he did so bad. He he start coming to himself. He went back to his
[44:00] life and he looked and he can see so many bad things that have taken place. Yet he was under
[44:08] a covenant. Amen. He knew that he was Abraham's seed and he had an inheritance. He knew that as
[44:16] Abraham's seed, God made a promise to Abraham that thy seed shall possess all the gates of its enemy.
[44:24] Amen. He knew that as Abraham seed, he was bound to victory. Amen. As Abraham seed, he knew that
[44:31] God is going to guide him through this pilgrimage. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. But sometime the way God
[44:38] guide us through this pilgrimage is not the way we think it should we should be guided.
[44:42] He has his own way of doing things my friends. And sometime we misunderstand God because he has his
[44:49] particular way of doing things you know as we go through I I believe God will help us get something
[44:55] here. Amen. So you see, let's look a little bit to into the life of Jacob. Because sometime we
[45:01] read the Bible, I always tell people when you read the Bible, it can just be like a book of different
[45:08] stories. But if you enter into the environment of the life of those Bible characters, then you start
[45:16] seeing great things that you've never seen before. You say, "Wow, it was so deep. I never realized it
[45:23] was like this." And you may think that we're the only one. Then you can start saying, "Oh,
[45:27] Jacob was there, too. This one was there, too. So, I'm not alone here. But they have the victory. So,
[45:33] if the God give them victory, he can also give me victory." Amen. So, you see, Jacob was born
[45:41] with his brother Esau. And as the prophet say was a lazy guy at home and hanging around the mother.
[45:48] And if you compare Jacob to Esau, Esau was more of a hardworking person, you know, a person you
[45:54] could trust. I believe if a young sister would have look for a a man to marry, would say,
[45:59] I'm going to choose Esau. Hardworking man. Nice guy. These are the guys always around his mother.
[46:06] I don't want that guy. Hallelujah. So when it come to choosing, you would have chosen Esau instead
[46:12] of choosing Jacob. Amen. So and and and as uh as the father uh Isaac was getting closer and closer,
[46:22] he has lost his sight and and he wanted to bless his firstborn, you know, because the firstborn
[46:28] they deserve a blessing now. Uh he he he called Esau. He said, "My son, go and get something.
[46:36] Cook me something that I like and I'm going to bless you because I'm nearing my my death."
[46:43] Now the mother heard the story. Now this is not a different mother. Is this the mother of the
[46:52] two boys? The two boys came from her womb. So Isa was not the child of another woman. It was
[47:01] her own child. Amen. My my question is how come a mother will prefer one of the child and the other
[47:08] one? Hallelujah. Amen. It's very difficult. But I believe that uh uh Rebecca had a revelation.
[47:17] He he had the mind of God. You know sometimes people think man is the boss, man is the head.
[47:23] God cannot speak to a to to my wife to a sister. But you look in the Bible, God has deal with women
[47:30] along all along the Bible. Amen. Even the children of Israel when they were born, it was the mother
[47:39] by the cry of where they were being born, they placed those children positionally in the land
[47:45] of adoption. Hallelujah. So here Rebecca has got the revelation. He knew something different about
[47:54] this child. Even he was a lazy guy, but he knew he loved the birthight so much. Glory to God. And he
[48:02] then the mother is telling Jacob, you know what? I heard your dad. He want to bless your brother. No,
[48:11] I want you to get that blessing. Hallelujah. The mother is teaching the child how to lie. He said,
[48:21] "No, mom, how can I do it? My voice, I don't smell like my brother. My dad will feel it. Just obey my
[48:30] voice. M do everything that I'm asking you to do. And then Jacob went and did everything that the
[48:38] mother asked her to do. And then the mother cooked the meal. And then the mother prepared everything
[48:45] to deceive the father. Hallelujah. He took some clothes of Jacob of Esau. He said, "You put his
[48:54] clothes so you can smell like Jacob, like Esau." And then he comes to the father and the father say
[49:04] I smell Esau. I feel Esau but the voice is Jacob. Are you truly my son Esau? Say yes dad I'm truly
[49:20] Esau. Hallelujah. Amen. And the father pronounced the blessings. As he was just done pronouncing the
[49:31] blessing and Jacob had just left, here comes Esau. Who is this? It's Esso. Esau. But Jacob was right
[49:41] here. I prayed for him. I gave him the blessings. I said, "Father, this how come it's me, Esau." I
[49:50] said, "I'm sorry." I said, "Don't you have any other blessing? You only have one blessing,
[49:55] Dad?" I said, "I'm sorry." I said, "Give me one some blessing." When he start praying, he said,
[50:01] "You shall be the servant of thy brother." Hallelujah. Now, Is he said to himself, I said,
[50:12] "Well, my our father is going to die soon and when he after he dies, I'm going to kill Jacob." And
[50:20] the news came to the ears of Rebecca and Rebecca again say my son your brother wants to kill you.
[50:29] Now you can imagine the dynamics of a family. It was not a peaceful family. The brothers were not
[50:40] talking to each other the way it should be. There were anger, hatred and death threat.
[50:50] This is the environment of a family of a person that was blessed. Are you there with me? Amen.
[50:59] Because you think when you are blessed, your family cannot be in such environment. Are you
[51:05] there with me? Let's move on. So now that the environment, what happened? He said,
[51:12] "No, you got to go to my brother Liban and stay there until the anger of your brother comes down.
[51:24] Then you will come back." Then he came to uh Isaac and Isaac blessed him. He say, of course,
[51:31] they were also unhappy because Isa married outside uh uh uh Israel. So yeah, outside the
[51:38] land that the people that God told him to marry, they he went to marry uh stranger women's and and
[51:45] uh Rebecca was not happy. She was very concerned. See, my first son, he's going to marry uh those
[51:54] Jezebel out there. I don't want her. I don't want him to marry this this Jezebel. She should come
[51:59] back here. There's a lot of nice girls in our community, in our in our land. God has allowed
[52:05] us to marry within ourselves. How can how come he can go outside but he told the Isaac told Joseph
[52:13] uh Jacob you go to your mother's brother and marry somebody from there one of us. Amen. Amen. So he
[52:24] left and he went with uh that death threat. So he was not at peace. He had the birthight because
[52:33] when Jacob Esau came to the father said father uh Jacob he took away my birthight now he's taking
[52:41] away my blessings this is too much I cannot stand that he has taken everything so he left so he had
[52:50] all the blessings he left and he went to Laban's house he got there he say oh I fell in love
[52:58] with Rachel Hallelujah Amen. Maybe when the first time he came. Oh, hello. Who are you? I am Jacob,
[53:07] the son of Rebecca. Oh, my nephew. Welcome home. This is your place. Come and stay on. And then he
[53:15] fell in love with the cousin. Yeah, I love Rachel. And then he said, "Oh, you have to
[53:22] work seven years before you get Rachel." He worked seven years. They gave him Leah. Another problem.
[53:30] You told me you're going to give me Rachel. How can you a problem with a father-in-law? No, no,
[53:36] no. Calm down. Work another seven years, then I'll give you Rachel. He worked another seven years,
[53:42] then they gave him Rachel. Not only that, but Laban noticed that everything that Jacob touched
[53:48] was blessed and uh he was becoming getting rich and getting rich and problem started arising and
[53:55] children of Laban started getting jealous and lean uh countness just changing and he found that my
[54:02] place is no longer here. There's the relationship with my in-laws it just not the best right now. I
[54:10] I can't continue like this. it can't continue like this. And then he told his wife, he said,
[54:17] "You see, your dad has changed my income 10 times." When it was 10% or 20% of of $1,000,
[54:27] it was easy to pay. But when it becomes a 20% of 1 million, it becoming a problem now to they start
[54:34] thinking, "No, that's too much money. We have to change the formula. We have to reduce the salary."
[54:40] So many negotiations start happening there and Jacob say he has changed my salary 10
[54:45] times problems after problems. So it was not peaceful relationship it tension and problems
[54:53] you know all kind of problems. So, and then the Lord spoke to me say go back to your father's
[55:01] house to my father's house. There is Esau. What am I going to do now? I got to leave anyway. He
[55:12] took everything. He left. And Lebanon heard that Jacob fled and he went after him and he was he
[55:22] he was being pursued by his father-in-law and he was going to also face uh Esau. So he was between
[55:31] two fires but God interveneed and spoke to Laban and he said be careful when you meet Jacob don't
[55:40] you try to do evil unto him. So if it was not God intervention, Laban would have cursed Jacob
[55:46] and did everything. So he say I have the right to curse you. It was not God who appeared unto
[55:52] me. Hallelujah. So this is Jacob. Now he finished with his father-in-law and the victory there. But
[56:01] it was very peaceful life. Now he was going to face Esau. My friend, I'm telling you, you know,
[56:08] it was a very You read the Bible, you see what the Bible says. He took this family. He separate
[56:14] everybody because he didn't want everybody to be killed at the same time. He put this wife
[56:18] over there. You go over there. This one go over there. He scattered everybody over the place.
[56:24] So that if they got this one here, this other one could be saved. If they got this one there,
[56:29] this one could be saved. It was a very challenging time. A lot of if you can call mental health and
[56:35] depression, whatever you can call, he was going through because of terminology. We did not have
[56:40] it in those days. Science has created them in these days. About 50 years ago, there was no
[56:46] psychological abuse or mental health. All these things did not exist. But science has created it
[56:54] these days. And unfortunately, believers also are using the language of science. But God has
[57:00] given us victory. Amen. Hallelujah. But preach the message, let off the pressure. Glory to God.
[57:08] We have a way of escape. Amen. So what happened here now? He found himself alone. This is the man
[57:15] who was working hard and he made money. He he had so many camels and cattle and different things.
[57:22] Now he was going to face Esau. He said, "Oh God, do something for me." Then he went to pray. And
[57:30] when he was praying, an angel appeared unto him. And then he fought with the angel. He fought with
[57:36] the angel all night. And he told the angel, "You cannot leave me until you bless me." You cannot
[57:44] leave me until you bless me. He was a strong man. And then the Bible said the angel touched
[57:50] his hip and his hip be was dislocated and and then he he he start limping his whole life. No,
[58:00] this is the man was strong who was going to go and maybe meet Isa. But a limping E is Jacob coming he
[58:08] was not weak but it was when he was weak that he was strong because the prophet said God said to
[58:17] to Jacob your name has changed you are no longer Jacob you are now be going to be called Israel a
[58:25] prince with God and Bam said Jacob had power with God. So this man was powerful with God,
[58:35] but he was a leaping man, a weak person yet powerful. You know what I'm saying? The message
[58:41] Israel and the church. Oh, and watch it touches tithe. And Jacob walked different. Amen. I hope
[58:48] that goes way down home. When you wrestle with God, you walk different after that. Amen. On the
[58:56] other side of the brook, the little river, he was a strong great man. backslid and tough away from
[59:02] God, running from his brother, running from God, stout and sturdy. On the other side of the brook,
[59:08] a leaping prince that a prince before God, for you have power with God as a prince. So Jacob had
[59:16] power with God. Now he went to face his brother in weakness. Without any strength. Hallelujah. Amen.
[59:27] You know, sometimes God want to teach us some stuff here. When you want to face problem with
[59:32] your own strength, you're going to be defeated. You got to get to the point where your strength
[59:37] is gone. You say, "Lord, if you don't help me here, I cannot make it." And when we are weak,
[59:43] then we are strong because his strength is made perfect through our weaknesses. Hallelujah. God
[59:50] cannot fight for you when you are strong. If you can take the things in your own hands,
[59:54] God cannot help you. But he wants somebody who can say Lord I can't do nothing. Lord I
[59:59] need you. Somebody who can completely depend on him and then he can come and help you. Glory to
[1:00:05] God. So here Jacob now he has overcome this situation with the death death threat. Now he
[1:00:14] stayed there dealing with his dislocated hip and so many problems that he couldn't resolve
[1:00:20] himself. So he stayed in the land of Sakov. And um the Bible says that in Genesis chapter
[1:00:26] 33:17 that when he stayed there but he went to stay now in the land of uh people of Sashm.
[1:00:42] This was a prince with God. This was a man who has power with God. He had the
[1:00:50] birthight. He had the blessings. He had met with God. Hallelujah. Because we're going to
[1:00:58] talk about it because there's a a two there was a a little bit of a shift between the two lives,
[1:01:03] but I I'll get back to that later on. Now, you would have said his family should be the most
[1:01:10] prosperous family. He has only one daughter. And this daughter said, "Oh, there's a birthday party
[1:01:17] in the city. I'm going to knock out the doors of my there are different girls in the city.
[1:01:22] let me go. And then I went out in the city to to visit the girls of the city. And there if I
[1:01:30] will use terminology that we use today, his only daughter was sexually assaulted and raped. Yeah.
[1:01:40] Can you imagine what Jacob felt in his heart? Amen. to have his daughter as sexually assaulted,
[1:01:50] raped and destroyed. You can see the anger of the brothers who did this and circumcised.
[1:02:00] We're going to show them. It was a big issue in the family. So, it was not a peaceful life,
[1:02:06] but it was a blessed man. Amen. Hallelujah. With the blessing of God. Now, what happened? this guy,
[1:02:15] this man the land of sision they said no you know what we are so sorry you are good people we want
[1:02:20] to live with you what we are going to marry the girl we're going to give the diary tell
[1:02:27] us whatever we need to do we are going to do it I said no you are uncircumcised we cannot marry
[1:02:33] with you I said if that the condition we are going to get all the male circumcised and they
[1:02:40] get all the male circumcised after they get all the male circumcised. The third day when the male
[1:02:47] were weak, the boys, they went to kill all the men. Jacob, oh my kid, why did you do this? Their
[1:03:00] neighbors here, they went to kill me. They call the people around to come and kill me. Got all
[1:03:07] your stuff. Got all your stuff. We got to leave this place. We got to leave this place. We need to
[1:03:11] flee. We cannot stay here. Yes. Hallelujah. Amen. You see what he has been going through different
[1:03:18] things in his life after that he continue on he went then the kids when he went to the land
[1:03:27] of his father and then they needed some food and then people at home hatred started happening too
[1:03:36] between his children Joseph and his brother. Hate problems. problems, problems, no misunderstanding.
[1:03:47] Hallelujah. Anger and hatred until one day the children they took their brother. They sold him
[1:03:57] into slavery. And they came to their father. They lied unto him. Dad, we are so sorry. Look,
[1:04:06] Joseph has been killed by wild animals. And they saw the father crying. The Bible said he
[1:04:15] he mourned Joseph like nobody before. They saw the father brokenhearted. He he tore down his
[1:04:23] clothes. He took ashes all over his bodies. Oh, Joseph. Joseph, my son. And we're all looking at
[1:04:31] their dad. They knew it was a lie, but they kept it secret. They broke the heart of their father.
[1:04:38] He was very he he he believed the lie that Joseph was dead. It did not stop there. And
[1:04:46] when they come, daddy, daddy, you know, Reuben, our first the first born slept with one of your
[1:04:54] concubines. What? My son, my firstborn, he slept with one of my concubines. E, can you imagine all
[1:05:04] the disappointment around? Oh my. Hallelujah. And then he get to the point where the mother
[1:05:14] died and then after the death of Isaac, now he uh someday they told him, "Daddy, we went to Egypt.
[1:05:30] Joseph is alive. He want us to bring Benjamin." I said no way. I lost Rachel. I lost Joseph. You
[1:05:40] want me to give you Benjamin? Is when they left of I cannot do and they didn't know what to do.
[1:05:49] And they kept him there. Finally they convinced the father to come.
[1:05:53] And when he came he's the man who is coming before
[1:05:56] Joseph before Pharaoh. He said Pharaoh my pilgrimage has been over 130 years.
[1:06:05] My days were evil. Hallelujah. Amen. But it was a man who has the double portion,
[1:06:13] who has the blessing, the birthight, who for the angels, but look at his life. Look at
[1:06:20] his family. If he was in the church today, you'll say he's not a he's not a believer.
[1:06:29] If Job was in the church today, he lost 10 children in one day. In one day,
[1:06:38] one messenger came, he did not finish. The other one comes, he has not finished. Another one comes,
[1:06:44] he has not finished. Another one comes. You would have collapsed. Hallelujah. Amen. But if he was in
[1:06:53] the church, you say he's a secret sinner. No, no, no, no, no. You cannot suffer like this,
[1:06:59] brother. You must have done something. Tell us the truth. Hallelujah. So there's a way we perceive
[1:07:06] this work which is not right. Amen. There's a way we have a judgment that is not right.
[1:07:16] God has his way of doing things. Amen. You don't know what happened when he was dealing with with
[1:07:22] Jacob. Maybe he was teaching him uh forgiveness. Maybe was teaching him temperance. Maybe love.
[1:07:31] And maybe you don't know what was happening at that particular moment. You can see somebody they
[1:07:38] are blessed like God told Satan, Satan, where you coming from? Oh, I came from the earth.
[1:07:45] was just wandering around and looking around and oh did you know this job my servant oh yeah I saw
[1:07:51] him he loves you you blessed him you gave him everything and you know that's why he loves you
[1:07:56] he said no go and take everything except his life and the devil went he took everything he came back
[1:08:05] you see he did not deny me oh because he has his health everything okay go and take even his health
[1:08:11] he fell sick his wife said why don't you curse God and die. Hallelujah. If you see Job get to the
[1:08:20] point of cursing the day of his birth, that mean the trials. It was just unbearable. Hallelujah.
[1:08:30] But yet it was God who triggered that. It was not him. Hallelujah. So God can come and say,
[1:08:39] "Hey, Satan, have you been on earth? Did you see my my daughter there in Edmonton or maybe
[1:08:45] in Calgary or somewhere also God you bless her or you can go and try to shake a little bit his
[1:08:51] marriage. Try to shake a little bit his family. Try to shake a little bit this thing and it has
[1:08:57] shook something there. You see her husband left her. Now what you going to do? Oh you see she's
[1:09:02] still serving me. She still loves me. She still goes to church. She's there every Wednesday,
[1:09:08] every Friday, every Sunday, and she's happy in the Lord anyway. No matter what comes my way,
[1:09:15] I should still serve the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. There's a way we look at the overcomers different
[1:09:23] than the way God looks at the overcomers. To be an overcomer is to keep life in the midst of problem.
[1:09:32] Amen. Amen. God a promise that shall is going to take away problems but you keeping life in the
[1:09:40] problems is what make you an overcomer. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Now he said Pharaoh
[1:09:50] the days of the years of my pilgrimage are 130 years. Few and evil have the days of the years
[1:09:57] of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of life, oh my fathers, in the
[1:10:03] days of the pilgrimage. Satan has come maybe try to torment your family, your daughter, your son,
[1:10:13] just to see how you're going to hold. Hallelujah. You can look back and say, I'm not the only one.
[1:10:20] Jacob was there. Amen. Job was there. Yeah, I'm identify with the same family. My problems,
[1:10:27] they also have the same problems. My issues, they also have the same issues. But Lord, I love you.
[1:10:33] Anyhow, when he came to brother Brandham, he took his wife. He took his his daughter, you know,
[1:10:40] and then somebody came to serve him. He went to kill himself. He tried to shoot himself. It didn't
[1:10:47] work. He tried to hold to h to the h to the power line. It didn't work. Hallelujah. Then he asked
[1:10:54] him the question, are you still holding on to your religion? He said, no, it's my religion keeping
[1:10:59] me. Hallelujah. It is him keeping me. It's not me. It is him keeping me. There's nothing that I have
[1:11:06] done. Hallelujah. You know there there are times the brother has gone through difficult situation
[1:11:13] even with brother Billy Paul. There came a time he start going out and drinking and smoking you
[1:11:19] know and he leave and go out and then he come early in the morning when sleeping on his toes
[1:11:31] dad is sleeping I don't want him to hear that I'm coming back then
[1:11:36] but when we son yes dad where were you last Right.
[1:11:45] You want me to tell you where you were? No, Dad. Don't tell me.
[1:11:52] Hallelujah. And he told him, "You have a choice. You live in my house, you stay with my loss. You
[1:12:02] don't want, you leave this house." Amen. Amen. That's your prophet. Yeah. That's your prophet.
[1:12:09] Amen. When you say pastor somebody, oh they son, the children, you don't understand God. Amen. You
[1:12:18] need to grow. Amen. You don't understand how God works. But that was the prophet. Amen. And Bipo
[1:12:27] left their house. He went to his auntie until he fell sick. Then he came back when Barbara prayed
[1:12:37] for him. The Lord healed him and brother took brother Bill Paul and start working with him.
[1:12:44] Hallelujah. So when you look at the pilgrimage of our life there are different things that God
[1:12:50] does. Amen. But many time we misunderstand it. But this is what I want to tell you
[1:12:56] something. What I'm saying here overcoming means he say overcome is keep life in you.
[1:13:08] H because God come to test you. This is where I want to show you something on my
[1:13:14] uh on my uh slide here. What? Uh give me the next slide. Do I have a No. Do I
[1:13:22] have something to move? No, it's okay. Now here. That's okay. Let's go like this. So,
[1:13:28] we are pilgrims here on earth. Where did we come from and where are we going? Verbam said, "We are
[1:13:38] out of eternity. Step into a little space here, a little time space here, and step out of time,
[1:13:47] back into eternity." Amen. We was before there was a world. Yeah. Amen. Then we come into
[1:13:57] the world and we go out of the world, back into the unknown to us. Now we are going through the
[1:14:05] unknown to us now. Hallelujah. Amen. So we were in God. Hallelujah. God did not choose you in time.
[1:14:19] He chose you before time. Hallelujah. God did not choose you because of good works. Because he chose
[1:14:28] you before even you did any good work. God did not choose you because you're a nice guy. No, he chose
[1:14:37] you because he chose you before the foundation of the world. He knew that when salvation shall come,
[1:14:44] you love it. And it is for knowledge. He had chosen you. Hallelujah. So when you come in
[1:14:50] this pilgrimage, what does it make you come into time? Because you were in eternity. The only thing
[1:14:58] that come make you to come into time, you need to become in contact with time. And to come in
[1:15:04] contact time, you were a gene in your father. Your great father, great great-grandfather,
[1:15:10] you were a gin. And they carried that gene. When the time came for you to be born through
[1:15:15] the bedding ground of your mother, your natural gene was manifested to carry the attributes of
[1:15:20] your father. Amen. But that gene comes with the weaknesses of the flesh. That gin will never be
[1:15:28] perfect. That's right. It carries death in it. It carries sicknesses, weaknesses, jealousies, anger,
[1:15:37] all kinds of problem. You can tell it's still in this body. Amen. This body is not the image
[1:15:43] of God. It is the image of animals. Amen. So your pilgrimage on earth, it's this flesh. Amen. And
[1:15:55] when this pilgrim is pilgrim is over, that mean you are done with this flesh. As long as you are
[1:16:02] in the time you are living with this flesh here. Hallelujah. So at the end of the pilgrimage that
[1:16:11] means you are done with the flesh. Amen. It's over with the flesh. It's finished with the flesh. No
[1:16:19] more jealousy. No more anger, no more sickness, no more death, no more parting again. Hallelujah.
[1:16:30] So Jacob referring to the pilgrimage, it was here in the time. And how are you manifested in time?
[1:16:43] How are you manifested in time is through the birth birth of the natural birth because you are
[1:16:55] a seed at the origin of every birth. There must be a seed. That's right. So in your natural gene,
[1:17:05] you were born out of a seed through the bedding ground of your mother. But you are also an eternal
[1:17:14] being with God. Amen. Before the foundation of the world, you are also a gene in God. And that
[1:17:23] gene also must come into manifestation through the bedding ground of the faith of a mortal.
[1:17:30] Amen. to bring the image of God, which is not this, but your faith in God's word bringing
[1:17:40] the manifestation of that image. Amen. That's another sermon. I'm not going to get into it,
[1:17:45] but I'm just showing you something here. So during this pilgrimage, there's a time that
[1:17:50] you lived with a record of your deeds. During this pilgrimage, there's a time that you live
[1:17:56] maybe like the woman at the well. She lived like a prostitute. She had a record of of deeds,
[1:18:01] a record of of everything that she did. Now there come a time where things have changed. God has
[1:18:09] taken this record of of deeds and threw it in the sea of forgetfulness. Because you have identified
[1:18:18] yourself with the lamb. Now your life is the life of the lamb. Now you you are manifesting
[1:18:24] the attribute of the life of the lamb. Hallelujah. I'm just laying a foundation again here before I
[1:18:29] move forward. So what happens here? God knew that in time, no matter if you are filled with the Holy
[1:18:36] Ghost from your head to the toe, as long as you have this flesh, you still have trouble. Amen.
[1:18:44] That's right. Someone may tell you, but if you have the Holy Ghost, you are fine. If you have
[1:18:50] the Holy Ghost, that's good. But but say when you have the Holy Ghost then you have more troubles,
[1:18:57] more fights, more wars to go through. Hallelujah. So you can see that the problem we have on this
[1:19:05] pilgrimage each year is just the gene of our natural birth. Now let's go to the next slide.
[1:19:21] So what mom say as you were the gene in your father you was a gene in God. Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:19:31] One of his attribute to begin with or you'll never be there. You come forth in the bedground of your
[1:19:37] mother and your fathers didn't know you. You were in his loins. Amen. Hallelujah. So the day of your
[1:19:44] pilgrimage on earth, you are talking about your natural gene. But beside that natural gene, God
[1:19:50] has planted in you a seed before the foundation of the world. Hallelujah. He knew that when the
[1:19:56] s o n of life shall shine upon that seed, it's going to blossom into an image of a son of God,
[1:20:03] into an image of a daughter of God. The sons and daughters of God are not blood and flesh.
[1:20:10] The sons of God are the are the children of promise. Amen. In other word, to be a child
[1:20:16] of promise, it's like Isaac. Isaac was a child of promise. Abraham, his body was dead. Sarah, his
[1:20:26] womb was dead. There was her womb was dead. There was no way they could ever have children. The only
[1:20:32] thing that took place it was they faith in the promised word produced a child that is called a
[1:20:41] child of promise. So the child of promise is your faith in the promised word. The manifestation that
[1:20:49] comes out of it is called the son of promise. It is called a child of God. It is called the bride
[1:20:57] of Christ. It's not flesh and blood. It is word. Amen. Hallelujah. So here God knowing that to make
[1:21:12] you an overcomer, you must be in this pilgrimage. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Because the only way God
[1:21:19] could reveal his attribute as a savior, as a healer, as a joy giver, as a strength giver, you
[1:21:26] must be in the gene of your father. Amen. You must be in this natural gene in this pilgrimage. That's
[1:21:34] the only way God can take glory. That's the only way they can be a testimony. That's the only way
[1:21:40] they can talk about an overcoming. So overcoming is overcoming in this journey. Hallelujah. The
[1:21:48] jane of this natural birth by faith in God's word. Amen. Glory to God. Are you there with
[1:21:55] me? Amen. But God knew that no matter what he can do, this body here will always fail you.
[1:22:07] Always fail you. You will never be perfect in this body. This body must be get away with at the end
[1:22:17] of the journey. There's either the mystery of the translation or there is the resurrection. Amen.
[1:22:24] that will change this body to the atoms. That's right. Hallelujah. Because you are born in sin,
[1:22:32] shaped in iniquity, kept the world speaking lies. You'll have problems until you die. That's right.
[1:22:39] It comes with cancer. It comes with arthritis. It comes with this high blood pressure, diabetes,
[1:22:46] all kind of issues. We live with it until we dive in with it. But we know that we shall come. Amen.
[1:22:54] And pick it up again. Hallelujah. I know at the end of my journey, at the end of my pilgrimage,
[1:23:03] I have an inheritance. Hallelujah. I'm going to be just like him. Never to die again. Never to
[1:23:12] suffer again. Amen. This body will be changed in a twinkling of an eye to the atoms taking away
[1:23:22] everything pertaining to sin. Amen. Amen. Amen. Maybe you don't get it. Let me explain to you.
[1:23:30] When somebody dies and then they bury that person, their body goes to the grave, his spirit goes back
[1:23:39] to God and his soul goes into his theophony, takes it into the presence of God. The body stays in the
[1:23:48] grave and the bodies rot in the grave and become dust. Bam said, "I won't need my dad and my mom
[1:23:59] to come out. He shall call me and I will answer." Amen. Amen. God will call the test. God will call
[1:24:10] the atoms that made my body. And they will come back again without an intervention of a woman
[1:24:18] and a man. That's right. In other word, you'll have a body just like the one Adam had in the
[1:24:25] beginning. That did not come from sex. Hallelujah. And that body will have nothing of sex in it. So
[1:24:34] there will be no weaknesses that body. Hallelujah. So you know at the end of the journey, you know,
[1:24:41] at the end of the pilgrimage, I'll be done with this flesh. Amen. If it's not through death,
[1:24:51] if Jesus comes tomorrow or today, I know one thing, in the twinkling of a night, this body is
[1:25:00] going to lose everything pertaining to the birth of sex. It will be translated, changed completely,
[1:25:08] losing everything pertaining to to death, to sins. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. That's right. Now God
[1:25:17] because he doesn't want to lose you here. He know that this flesh you be tempted sometimes you hear
[1:25:26] things you want to hear. People will criticize you. Your affection your self love will be fight.
[1:25:33] Oh they say things about me. This one say this about me. Oh they don't love me here. Oh this
[1:25:40] and that. God knew that you go through that. Hallelujah. Says if it was not God protection,
[1:25:51] God would have lost Abraham. Can you imagine a man who lost? They they say, "Oh, first of all,
[1:26:00] his servant got problems with Lot." And then he say, "Oh, well, I'm going to Okay,
[1:26:08] Lot, come here. You You decide we want to take whatever you mean. I'll take
[1:26:15] Thank you. The second one. Okay. The second one
[1:26:24] is Sarah, you are so beautiful. When we go to Egypt, they're going to love you
[1:26:34] there. Please don't tell them you are my wife. Let them have you. but save my life.
[1:26:47] Tell them you are my sister. Is that the truth? That's the man we call Abraham.
[1:26:57] And then after that his wife comes um Abraham I don't think that that promised son will come
[1:27:03] through me. You take my servant here. Okay. It's fine. No problem. And then after they got the
[1:27:13] child, Abraham, I don't like that woman. Kick them out of here. And God say do what she says. Hey,
[1:27:27] go. Hallelujah. But that was the child of God. Brother said Abraham lied. Amen. Amen. Abraham
[1:27:40] left the promised land because of famine, because of problems. He left the word. He
[1:27:45] left his promised land. He went to Egypt that got into trouble and problems. But but say if
[1:27:53] it was not the uncondition covenant, God would have lost Abraham. So God knows that when this
[1:28:02] gene is under pressure, you you may do things that you don't want to do. You may get angry
[1:28:09] and start saying things that you don't want to say. But because you're a child of God,
[1:28:13] you always come back. Lord, I'm so sorry. Amen. And God has to protect you. God has to keep
[1:28:20] you. It said here, next slide, brother. Oh, I'll try. Is this I don't know if it's going to work.
[1:28:29] Oh, yeah. That's it. No. Yeah. Good. Here. So now to make sure that God doesn't lose you
[1:28:41] in time because he knows that this flesh is born in sin shape iniquity came to the world
[1:28:49] speaking lies. It will always what I'm said until you die this flesh will cause problems
[1:28:56] to you but don't lose hope because you know what it is. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Now God,
[1:29:06] he puts a covenant to cover time to protect you. That covenant is called the everlasting covenant,
[1:29:15] the unconditional covenant or the rainbow covenant to protect you in time. Amen. It
[1:29:22] said the blood of Jesus Christ is called the everlasting covenant. Yes sir. Everlasting
[1:29:26] covenant. It's an everlasting covenant which mean certain amount of time till time is up. There
[1:29:32] will never be another one. When time runs out, we won't need no covenant. But until time runs out,
[1:29:39] we need the covenant. So God need to keep you in time to protect you so you may not be lost.
[1:29:48] And David could say, "Blessed be the name whom the Lord doesn't impute his iniquity." Amen.
[1:29:55] When divine commentary came of Abraham, even of Sarah, the Bible says they've never doubted God.
[1:30:02] Hallelujah. When div commentary came about to David, he say he's a man after my own heart. But I
[1:30:10] don't know what kind of reputation David live with in the neighborhood. Oh, that he killed a man. He
[1:30:15] took his wife. Oh, he's very dangerous. Don't stay around him. Don't let your wife hang around that
[1:30:21] guy. He's very dangerous. But that's a reality. That's how people would think. Yeah. If he was in
[1:30:29] neighborhood, that's how you would think you would never let his wife be closer to him because you
[1:30:35] don't know what's going to happen. That's right. Hallelujah. But maybe that reputation that he he
[1:30:41] grew up or no, he he lived within the neighborhood or maybe people know about him. People knew even
[1:30:48] we today we know in the Bible that David took somebody's wife. All of us we know that he killed
[1:30:55] a man. Yeah. Hallelujah. You would think that man cannot go to to heaven but God says a man after
[1:31:03] my own heart. And actually it was through that woman that the seed of Christ came through. Amen.
[1:31:10] That's right. Hallelujah. And the Bible says soul after becoming enemy to God, he was still saved.
[1:31:22] How can you understand that? So there's a way we see the overcomer. That is not the way God sees
[1:31:29] the overcomer. To overcome is to endure the trial, to endure the test keeping life. And God can tell
[1:31:38] Satan, did you see? You took his job. He still loves me. His wife left me. Left him. He still
[1:31:45] loves me. He comes to church. He's serving me. He's an overcomer. Amen. But the world can see you
[1:31:53] see, oh, you you go to church, you you church, you why why are you separated? But I I didn't want to
[1:32:00] separate, but things happen. God knows why. He's able to restore it. If he wants to, if he if he
[1:32:09] should be that way, I still love the Lord anyhow. Amen. Don't stop serving the Lord. Don't quit
[1:32:16] church. Amen. Amen. Keep on serving God because you God is looking for overcomers those who endure
[1:32:26] the test and keep life. Amen. And endure the trial until the end because you know at the end
[1:32:35] of your pilgrimage there is a reward. There is an inheritance. You'll be done with this body. Amen.
[1:32:42] All jealousy, disappointment. You'll be done with it. Because the spirit that you have now,
[1:32:49] it's a permissive spirit. God permit you to have a spirit that has the five senses of the spirit. But
[1:32:57] when you come to your glorified body, you won't need that human spirit anymore. It's a corrupted
[1:33:03] spirit that causes all the problems that we have. The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
[1:33:07] the pride of life. Hallelujah. So God not to lose you. He put this everlasting covenant around you
[1:33:14] and then he said I'm going to protect you. So you came from eternity. You step into time and
[1:33:20] you are going into eternity. But before you are in time, God knowing that you live in a gene of
[1:33:26] weaknesses and many things will happen. He said I have to protect you. He put a covenant. Amen.
[1:33:34] The everlasting covenant. Aren't you happy? He said, "I cannot lose you." God is determined to
[1:33:41] save you. He's determined to change things around your life. He's determined to give you happiness
[1:33:46] and joy. He's determined to see you come through. Hallelujah. You shall come through. You tell the
[1:33:54] devil, "I shall come through. I shall overcome. I shall come through. No matter what you do,
[1:34:01] I shall come through." Amen. Because I'm a seed of God. I have just been trapped into this body of
[1:34:10] flesh that is born in sin and shepherd iniquity. I'm tempted and I see things I don't want to see.
[1:34:16] I hear things I want to hear. I say things I don't want to say. I feel things I want to feel. But one
[1:34:22] day I shall overcome. One day a shall be over. Hallelujah. You can turn back and say the days
[1:34:31] of my pilgrimage. So many disappointment. I've been hated here. People did this to me. This one
[1:34:39] done that. Hallelujah. I don't know what we went through. But can you identify yourself with one
[1:34:45] of Bible characters today and say Lord I want to say thank you because the Bible says in everything
[1:34:52] give thanks to God. And he say many are the affliction of the righteous man but the Lord
[1:34:59] deliver him of them all. And the Bible says also everything works for the good of them that love
[1:35:07] the Lord. It is very difficult to see how good that is. You know one one brother came to brother
[1:35:14] say brother Brandham my wife wants to leave me and Bam said oh say keep on loving her keeping
[1:35:26] being nice to her. If she is a seed of God, she's going to come back. If she is not a seed of God,
[1:35:37] she's not going to come back. If you continue to worry about her, the devil wants to destroy your
[1:35:44] health. So you leave her, forget about her because what the devil is trying to do to destroy your
[1:35:51] health. Hallelujah. This is God talking to this man through his prophet. how he should handle this
[1:35:59] case. Now you would imagine that because he came to see brother the problem must be just solved.
[1:36:08] Amen. But he's still he's telling him if she's a seed of God she'll come back. If she a seed of God
[1:36:15] she won't come back. But you stop worrying about him about her. If she goes leave her alone because
[1:36:21] the next thing the devil wants to destroy your health. Amen. So if this man now stays with God,
[1:36:30] serving the Lord, loving the Lord, it's difficult to say, brother and sister, you don't want to be
[1:36:34] in that situation. But God is sovereign. He's the one who allow things to happen, you know,
[1:36:44] and the the only thing the other thing is it doesn't give you it does it doesn't tell you,
[1:36:49] you know, God doesn't tell you here. He doesn't tell you anything in between there.
[1:36:54] He say I'm alpha and omega. It doesn't say anything. If God
[1:37:00] tells you everything that will come in between, you run away.
[1:37:07] You run away and you ask God, Lord, there's no shortcut that I can just go from alpha to
[1:37:16] omega by passing time. He said, no, I want you to be in time. Amen. I want you to go through time.
[1:37:25] Hallelujah. If he would have shown unto Jacob, unto Jacob everything that will come after,
[1:37:34] he never thought that one day you'll be a limping man. He didn't thought about that.
[1:37:41] Hallelujah. He never thought one day that this beautiful girl that I had, oh baby,
[1:37:46] I love you, one day she's going to be sexually assaulted and raped.
[1:37:52] Hallelujah. Amen. And then Joseph, if God would have told him, Joseph,
[1:38:00] the sun, the moon will bow down before you, I'll make you big above your brothers. Ah,
[1:38:08] yeah. But this is the path. They're going to hate you. They throw in a pit. You're being to slold
[1:38:16] into slavery. You're going to be a slave in Egypt in the house of Portifer and his wife is going to
[1:38:23] lie against you. You're going to go to jail and after the jail then you'll become what I want you
[1:38:28] to become. God is there any other path any any any shortcut? You know this is a this is human mind.
[1:38:38] We want ways to get rich quicker. And when you are traveling, you want to have the road that
[1:38:45] will take you less time. Nobody wants something that take long and long and longer. Nobody wants
[1:38:50] that. But God doesn't like shortcuts. He want that his way that we got to follow. Amen. If you try to
[1:38:57] run away from his way, it's like a GPS, right? When you're driving, you leave the trajectory,
[1:39:03] it's a recalculating, recalculating. You losing time recalculating and they bring you back again.
[1:39:15] When it's doing recalculating, you are spending more years recalculating but just stay on the
[1:39:21] path. God will take you through. Hallelujah. So you see when you are going through this journey
[1:39:28] here, God has to protect you my brother. You are a seed of God. You are under his protection. Amen.
[1:39:35] No matter what happens your way, believe that you are a son of God. You are a daughter of God. God
[1:39:42] will make you go through it and you are going to be an overcomer. Amen. Amen. Amen. It doesn't say
[1:39:49] anything in between. Nobody chose his father. If people would have chosen their father, I think
[1:39:58] maybe somebody would say, I want to be the father. I want this millionaire man to be my father.
[1:40:03] I want this other meant very father. But it was not even in in your choice. You never chose your
[1:40:11] family. You never chose the way you should be born. So you find yourself as a victim
[1:40:17] of circumstances that you did not create in your life. Maybe you carry some disease in
[1:40:23] your family. Maybe diabetes, maybe something. You did not choose it. You got to live with it.
[1:40:29] But God want to let you know that no matter what you have in this flesh, if you are a
[1:40:33] daughter of God during this pilgrimage, at the end there shall be an inheritance. There shall
[1:40:41] be an inheritance. We shall overcome. Yes, sir. We are born to victory. Not because we are powerful,
[1:40:53] because God chose us before the foundation of the world to be overcomers in this age. Amen.
[1:40:59] We are not scared of the end times. The Bible say in the evening time there shall be in the
[1:41:04] last days there shall be perilous time but we are not scared because God will be with
[1:41:10] us. Amen. He promise he shall be with us. Do you love the Lord? God bless you. Hallelujah.
[1:41:21] I leave the pastor to come. Glory. Glory. Glory. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:42:41] Thank God that he changed the note for us. Praise
[1:42:45] be to God. Praise be to God. I was just fellowshipping the other day, I think,
[1:42:51] with my wife. And can you put for me Romans 8:20 27? Pastor Boris has mentioned it. and um
[1:43:05] 8:27. We all know it, but I just want to um
[1:43:19] then just go down there. 28th. Actually, it was 28. Yeah, 28th. For we know that all things work
[1:43:28] together for good for those who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose. And
[1:43:37] all things all things work together. And if you look at it, it's not um it's not like all things
[1:43:47] are good, right? Some of the things happened like really and look at the life of Jacob. Huh?
[1:43:56] Really? But the key is all that happened to him. Whatever happened to him in our human
[1:44:04] language will say bad things, right? No, bad things. But the key they work together,
[1:44:11] they work together for good for those who love God. Do you know that Jacob was
[1:44:19] actually brother one of my type is a grace, right? When is God is building the the the
[1:44:24] the the masterpiece says Jacob is grace. But when you look at his life, oh really.
[1:44:35] Oh, and we are those part of the grace. Amen. Amen. But as he put it so well,
[1:44:42] that tremendous grace of God was before eternity and that everlasting cover, that grace of God,
[1:44:53] but not everybody has that everlasting cover and then the end which is the purpose of God.
[1:45:01] Everything that happens in our life has a purpose. Amen. Might not understand when we
[1:45:06] are going through it but the there is a purpose because he loved us because of the grace of God
[1:45:14] in our life. Oh God help us to have to see what you see the way we see the way God looks at an
[1:45:23] overcomer. Sometimes we don't look at this as he said it so well. We don't see the same way
[1:45:27] but God help me help me to see the way you see at an overcomer. Amen. When we shall be wonderful,
[1:45:36] wonderful, sir. Did you love it? Do you like it? Now we can give a bluff to the enemy. A little bit
[1:45:42] bluff enemy. You have been trying to put to put in discouragement like no, God has left me. No,
[1:45:48] I'm still part of God's grace. Still God's program is still working in my life, in my life,
[1:45:53] in my family. I can see things going around and sometimes I feel like I'm discouraged.
[1:45:57] Go. Where is God? Where is God? He's in the middle of it. is working something. Thank God
[1:46:02] for that. Praise be to God. Oh Lord, I love you. Thank you Jesus. Thank you. Only God can
[1:46:10] speak to the way he has spoken to us to this evening. We thank God for that when we shall
[1:46:17] meet. I have some few songs brother and just oh what a day that will be. What a day that will be
[1:46:28] when we all get to help me that what it
[1:46:38] will be. Oh, that will be when we all get Jesus [Music] will sing. and child of your grace.
[1:46:56] Wondrous love,
[1:47:00] sing his mercy and is great. Oh,
[1:47:11] it's 166.
[1:47:16] Oh, when we go when we all get to heaven. Oh,
[1:47:22] get to heaven. They are rejoicing. That will be that will be when we all sing. When see Jesus
[1:47:38] and shout the victory.
[1:47:43] While we walk the pilgrim pathway we lord in the sky. Oh my traveling days.
[1:48:00] Oh no the shadow on the side. Oh, when we all when we get to heaven
[1:48:12] get to heaven rejoicing that will be that will be when we all sing.
[1:48:24] We see Jesus. We will sing and shout the victory. [Music] All men be true and faithful trusting
[1:48:42] every day. Oh, just one glimpse of him in glory. When the dawn of life remain. Oh,
[1:48:56] and we go. When we all get to heaven, we get to heaven. Lord, day of rejoicing. That will
[1:49:06] be that will be when we all sing to see Jesus. We'll sing and shout the victory.
[1:49:22] Onward to the Christ before us. Soon his glorious future. Oh, soon the pearly gates
[1:49:38] will open. We will tread the streets of gold. And we all and we all get to heaven. We get
[1:49:51] to heaven. Day of rejoicing that we will be when we all see Jesus. will sing and shout
[1:50:07] the victory when we all when we all when we all go get to heaven on the day of rejoicing that
[1:50:20] you need that will be when we all see Jesus we will sing and shout the victory [Music]
[1:50:36] Some glad morning when this life is over
[1:50:47] [Music]
[1:50:53] to show how we Oh, I fly away. Oh, glory. Oh, I fly away to my home. I can die. Hallelujah.
[1:51:17] By and by, I'll fly away. When the shadows of this life, when the shadows of this love is
[1:51:31] grow. Glory to his name. Glory to his name. Like a bird. Oh, like a bird from prison.
[1:51:45] I fly away. I will fly away. I fly away. Oh glory I shall fly away. In
[1:52:02] that morning I can die. Hallelujah. By and by I fly away. Just a few more weary days.
[1:52:16] Just a few more weary days already [Applause] fly away. Oh to
[1:52:32] shall never end. End of the pyramid. I fly away. I will fly away. I will fly away. Oh glory
[1:52:50] away that morning I was hallelujah by and by I fly away. Let's give the hand to the Lord
[1:53:05] and praise him. Let's praise the Lord. Father we thank you. We praise you. We glorify your name.
[1:53:12] Thank you for the word of encouragement. Thank you for speaking to our heart, Father. Thank you,
[1:53:17] Father, for bringing us back where we come from. That we come from you, Lord Jesus Christ. We have
[1:53:24] been loved with elective love. You loved us before the foundation of the world. Lord,
[1:53:29] you are the alpha and your omega. And our omega, Father Lord, is not the grave. Our omega is not,
[1:53:36] Father Lord, the sickness. Our omega is not a defeat. But father, our destination is heaven
[1:53:42] in your presence as overcomers. Lord Jesus Christ, thank you for your victory. We love you Lord Jesus
[1:53:49] Christ. Thank you for the overlasting covenant, the unconditional covenant, the grace of God. You
[1:53:57] working in our life, watching over us. Lord, we praise you. We thank you. We can really thank you,
[1:54:03] Father, because we see now the way you see over us, Lord. What a day of thanksgiving that we
[1:54:09] are in our land of the Holy Ghost. Lord, that we know you now, Jesus Christ. Walk with us,
[1:54:15] Lord. We desire to walk with you. We desire to praise you. We desire to glorify you. Thank you,

[1:54:35] Glory, glory to your name. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Father. Thank you. Thank you, Father. Sister
[1:54:46] Katy, Sister Raymond, Sister Esther, if you can prepare to sing that song. Worship the Lord. Just
[1:54:54] uh I think it will be just appropriate now if you can prepare to sing for us as as getting ready for
[1:55:03] that. I just want to uh don't I don't want to add anything but just want to put a little bit
[1:55:09] as they're getting prepared just put a little thought here. Um you know the prophet says the
[1:55:14] love of God is the elective love is that that's the difference. Sometimes we see, oh, oh, but
[1:55:21] but if God loved me, why this? Why this? Why this? That's not how you measure God's love. God's love
[1:55:28] is elective love. As he put it so well, it's where you come from. That's the key. Where you come
[1:55:35] from determines where you are going. Amen. That's God's love. And and and and as God loved, he said,
[1:55:43] "Love, I loved Jacob. I hated Esau. Looked like a good man. like the one who was working hard and
[1:55:50] different things but God's love was more important because he put something in Jacob. Somehow Jacob
[1:55:58] loved the birthight. Somehow he just loved it. He just that what he was putting all his effort even
[1:56:06] to the point of lying just for that birthight because God put something inside of him is that
[1:56:13] love. And how do you prove your love towards God? by believing. How do we prove our love towards
[1:56:20] God? By believing what he said and by conducting ourself or myself with joy amidst the trials,
[1:56:29] amidst the hard things that you don't understand. But I still conduct myself. I still worship the
[1:56:35] Lord. I still express myself with joy because the finality of the journey of the pilgrimage,
[1:56:41] I will be with him. Amen. Despite what go this flesh goes through or the mind go through and
[1:56:48] situations go through. Thank God that he has given us the mind of Christ. Now we see different job.
[1:56:56] Job where were you? God didn't have to argue with him with situations here and all these things. I
[1:57:03] know they happen but where were you Job? That's when that's where that's the key. Thank you Pastor
[1:57:11] Bur. Thank the Lord for using it. changing the note. We are glad he changed the note.
[1:57:19] Glad he changed the note. Amen. Sisters, help us.
