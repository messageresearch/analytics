[38:13] helping the mic it's just my voice
[38:16] sometimes get sideways so it'll be
[38:18] helping me a little bit on that Um,

[38:26] Andrew. So, I'll keep that on the next
[38:27] time. Um,

[38:42] family.
[38:43] So, the theme will be on the family. I
[38:45] don't know how the the preacher will go
[38:47] but I kind of mentioned to him if you
[38:50] leave it on the on the family topic. Um
[38:53] so I think it will be good a burden my
[38:56] heart to have good families. Amen. When
[38:59] our families are strong the church will
[39:01] be strong. Amen. When the man knows his
[39:03] position, the sister knows our position.
[39:06] The children know their position and uh
[39:10] the the relationship the parents with
[39:12] the children is good. I believe the
[39:14] church will be stronger. Amen. How many
[39:16] can agree with me now?
[39:18] &gt;&gt; So sometimes we don't put that as
[39:21] emphasis on every service but brother
[39:24] Steve Besson is very very good on that
[39:26] topic. He has he has he has held some

[47:43] Philippians chapter 2 12- 16. And I'll
[47:49] let you have a seat.
[47:52] Wherefore, my beloved, as you have
[47:54] always obeyed, not as in my presence
[47:57] only, but now much more in my absence,
[48:01] work out your own salvation with fear
[48:04] and trembling. For it is God which
[48:07] workketh in you both to will and to do
[48:10] of his good pleasure. Amen. Do all
[48:14] things without murmurings and
[48:16] disputings,
[48:18] that you may be blameless and harmless,
[48:21] the sons of God without rebuke in the
[48:24] midst of a crooked and perverse nation
[48:27] among whom you shine as light in the
[48:30] world.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Holding forth the word of life that I
[48:33] may rejoice in the day of Christ that I
[48:36] have not run in vain neither labored in
[48:40] vain. May God bless the reading of his
[48:42] word and give us the contact this
[48:44] morning and have a seat. Amen.
[48:58] It's my little bit
[49:00] like to continue on the same subject we
[49:02] are on on the stature of the fullness of
[49:05] Christ. I know that we have a little bit
[49:07] of a stop there of the traveling and
[49:10] then special meetings and and saw help
[49:14] from others and brother brother Gilbert
[49:17] and brother Victor some been a long time
[49:20] but I think it to be good to come back a
[49:22] little bit so might be hard on me a
[49:24] little bit to come back on the subject
[49:26] but we have been blessed by all those
[49:29] ministers
[49:30] &gt;&gt; and the presence of the Lord thank God
[49:32] for that I would like I'm on the second
[49:34] stage there I would like to talk a
[49:36] little bit on the virtue this morning
[49:38] and I would like to talk on the virtue
[49:40] and a type of a Christlike character.
[49:43] It's Christlike character.
[49:46] The Bible says again in the Ephesians
[49:48] 2:8, "For by grace are you saved through
[49:52] faith that not of yourselves, it is the
[49:55] gift of God." And then Revelation 28:11
[50:00] says, "Unto the angel of the church may
[50:02] not write these things save the first
[50:06] and the last which was dead and is now
[50:08] alive. The main character, the main
[50:11] characteristic, the main attribute on
[50:14] the on the on the church of the Smina is
[50:17] the virtue is the attribute of the
[50:18] virtue of God as the prophet would put
[50:20] that as a parallel. So it has a little
[50:22] bit of a parallel between the age of
[50:24] Sina and that main characteristic or the
[50:27] main the main attribute of it is the
[50:29] virtue. Amen. Then says I'm the first
[50:32] and the last which was dead and is
[50:34] alive. Do you believe that he's still
[50:36] the first and the last? If he's the
[50:38] first and the last means before even
[50:41] anything happens, he knew it before it
[50:43] happened.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; And he's the last means he's the one. He
[50:46] has the last decision for anything that
[50:48] is happening in your life. God knows
[50:50] your first. God knows your last. Amen.
[50:53] He knows the beginning. He knows the
[50:55] end. It says, "I'm the first and the
[50:57] last, which was dead and is alive. I
[50:59] know thy works and tribulation and
[51:01] poverty, but but thou art rich, and I
[51:04] know the blasphemy of them which say
[51:06] they are Jews, and are not, but are the
[51:09] synagogue of Satan. Fear none of these
[51:12] things which we that shall suffer. Say,
[51:14] Behold, the devil shall cast some of you
[51:17] into prison, that you may be tried, and
[51:20] you shall have tribulation 10 days. Be
[51:22] thou faithful unto death, and I will
[51:25] give thee a crown of life. He that have
[51:28] an ear, let him hear what the spirit
[51:30] saith unto the churches, he that
[51:32] overcometh shall not be heard of the
[51:36] second death. Amen.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; So we like to go on that. The prophet in
[51:39] this message in this message of the
[51:41] simeina age on the church ages he just
[51:44] put so great quotes it's one of actually
[51:46] it's one of my favorite one of my
[51:48] favorite church age if we have to talk
[51:50] about and because he put that so many
[51:52] good principles so many good quotes on
[51:55] that as you read it's just it's just
[51:57] wonderful I would encourage you to go
[51:59] and listen to it and go and read even
[52:01] the church ages some wonderful wonderful
[52:04] wonderful quote but I think it does not
[52:06] only pertain to this in a church age but
[52:09] also pertain to every age to every
[52:12] believer even our time some of all the
[52:14] truth that will be unfolding there he
[52:16] says one of the things he says and I'll
[52:18] just read it in the beginning
[52:24] he says
[52:26] page 151 he says then he goes on not
[52:30] only narrow down his definition but
[52:32] rather finalize it for Galatians 3 he
[52:35] identified the seed singular with Jesus
[52:37] us and he counted the seed children as
[52:41] children of promise as promise as as pro
[52:45] and promise as having to do with the
[52:47] election and the choosing of God. That
[52:51] is exactly what we have been saying.
[52:53] Those who are of the royal seed are the
[52:55] elect of God are the predestinated
[52:58] fornown of God and were in the mind of
[53:01] God and it is told. Amen. In very plain
[53:05] language the true bride of Christ was in
[53:07] the mind of God eternally though not
[53:10] expressed until each came forth in the
[53:13] designated decreed season. And each
[53:16] member came forth it became expressed
[53:18] and took its place in the body. That's
[53:21] this bridge, this br this bride. Sorry.
[53:25] That's this bride is the literal spoken
[53:27] word seed bride. You are the spoken word
[53:31] seed bride.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And said though she's feminine in
[53:35] destination, she's also called the body
[53:38] of Christ. It's very apparent that she
[53:40] ought to be called that for she was
[53:42] predestinated in him came from the same
[53:45] source was eternal with him and is now
[53:49] manifested God in many membered body
[53:53] &gt;&gt; if you were in God you can never be lost
[53:56] if you were if in God's mind you can
[53:59] never be lost you have been
[54:01] predestinated nothing can hinder you
[54:04] from making it amen says you came from
[54:06] the same source as go Jesus Christ came
[54:09] from the same source. He was eternal
[54:10] with him. So if Jesus is eternal, you
[54:13] are eternal too.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; So they are now manifested God in a many
[54:17] membered body whereas God whereas once
[54:20] God was manifested in one member even
[54:23] our Lord Jesus Christ. So he said then
[54:26] he goes he continues says now as the
[54:29] eternal logos god was manifest in the
[54:31] son and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness
[54:34] of the godhead bodly and that eternal
[54:36] one was the father manifest in flesh
[54:39] thereby gain the title son even so we
[54:43] eternal in his thought in our on our
[54:45] turn became the many membered spoken
[54:48] word seed amenifed
[54:51] in flesh and those eternal thought now
[54:53] manifest in flesh are the sons of God.
[54:56] Amen.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; If we could have that revelation that we
[55:00] came from God, therefore we have no
[55:02] other destination but going back to God.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, it will help us in our work.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; It says now even as we are so-called, we
[55:11] did not become seed by the rebirth. We
[55:14] were seed and therefore were reborn. For
[55:16] only the elect can be reborn.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; You cannot ask any other person if he
[55:22] was not elect to be reborn. Only the
[55:24] elect in this age can be reborn because
[55:27] only the elect has that predestinated
[55:29] seed inside of them. Amen. We have heard
[55:32] it many times. But may God make it more
[55:35] and more real in our lives.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; No. So that's why sometimes even the
[55:40] message can be hard. The message can be
[55:42] hard but it's it's hard not to not not
[55:45] to tell you that you can't make it. It's
[55:47] hard to tell you that you are a s you
[55:50] have been formed to it. Amen. It's
[55:52] calling you to come to the level where
[55:54] you have been for then to it. Amen. The
[55:56] devil want to put us down but we have to
[55:59] go higher. Amen. As we heard on on on
[56:01] Wednesday there. So even the channel has
[56:04] already been open. We just need to go to
[56:06] the to to the level where God wants us
[56:08] to be
[56:10] &gt;&gt; says now because we were seed is the
[56:13] reason we could be quickened
[56:15] &gt;&gt; in non seed. There is nothing to
[56:18] quicken. Right.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; There's nothing to pick any nonseed. You
[56:22] can't you can't find, you know,
[56:24] sometimes they have a fake seed, you
[56:26] know, for decoration. It looks like a
[56:28] seed. It's very nice. Sometimes shine
[56:31] more shining than a real seed, but
[56:33] there's not no life inside of it. You
[56:36] can bury it and 10 years is still the
[56:38] same. 20 years is still the same. It's
[56:41] coming to church and
[56:43] there's nothing because it's not a seed,
[56:46] but the seed of God. Amen. Oh, praise be
[56:49] to God. It might take many, many, many
[56:51] days, many years, but if the life is
[56:53] there, it's going to come forth no
[56:55] matter what.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Says all this, it says all this
[57:06] carefully in mind. Now take the next
[57:08] step. Redeem means to pay to buy back to
[57:12] restore to the original owner. So
[57:15] redeeming does not mean you go and find
[57:18] something that is not yours. No,
[57:20] redeeming means it's something that was
[57:22] yours, it was lost and then you go and
[57:25] take it back again.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; So oh it belongs to me now. Yeah, it
[57:29] belonged to you before it was lost. Now
[57:31] you redeem it back.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; That redemption is only for the elect.
[57:35] Amen.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Sometimes hard to say those things but
[57:38] you are we are mature Christians.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Redemption is only for the elect. You
[57:42] know someone asked I think someone sent
[57:45] me or I read that someone they ask no
[57:47] why you say that why you always say
[57:49] those who those who can be saved are
[57:51] only the elect you you are disqualifying
[57:54] some people no you're not disqualifying
[57:56] people we're actually qualifying people
[58:00] &gt;&gt; amen if you are an elect you say oh I
[58:02] believe the word of God it's open to
[58:05] everybody amen so you're not
[58:06] disqualifying anybody amen it's still
[58:08] the word of God I don't want to lose my
[58:10] place there says It restore the original
[58:13] honor. God by his death in the shed
[58:15] blood bought back his own. He brought
[58:18] back the spoken word seed bride. My
[58:21] sheep hear my voice and they follow me.
[58:25] You always wear a sheep.
[58:28] You never wear a pig or dog turn into a
[58:31] sheep. We are not trying to turn. The
[58:34] message is not trying to turn a pig into
[58:37] a sheep. No, you were already a sheep.
[58:40] The message comes to reveal to you that
[58:42] you are a sheep. Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; It is not trying to make you take to
[58:46] take the character of a sheep if you are
[58:49] not a sheep.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; That's where I'm going. Christlike
[58:53] character. You're not trying to
[58:55] Christlike character cannot can only be
[58:59] in those who have been sheep from the
[59:01] beginning.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Christlike character cannot be on a pig.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; A pig will try to be like Christ but
[59:08] will never be like Christ. You will put
[59:10] on try to make it but after a while you
[59:13] will once you see a little bit of mud.
[59:15] Oh I still feel it empty. You will go
[59:18] back to the mud. After a while you will
[59:20] go back to the mud. You're trying to put
[59:22] Christ character upon him. It won't
[59:24] work.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; But the character that we need on the
[59:27] ship he has to start from the inside.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; You're always a sheep. that is
[59:33] impossible for every kind of life
[59:36] produces the same kind and there is no
[59:39] change in specy. If you were in the
[59:42] thought of God and then expressed in
[59:43] flesh, there had to come a day when we
[59:46] will hear his voice. The prophet says
[59:48] his word and hearing that voice become
[59:51] aware of our father calling us and
[59:54] recognize that we are the sons of God.
[59:57] Amen.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; It's about recognizing.
[1:00:00] And the message is about recognizing.
[1:00:02] Recognizing your time, recognizing who
[1:00:04] you are, recognizing that you are a
[1:00:06] mature child. Amen. It's about
[1:00:08] recognizing.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Give me a little bit of volume. Looks
[1:00:17] like I'm shouting.
[1:00:20] Please.
[1:00:27] So we heard
[1:00:29] we heard his voice and cried out as did
[1:00:31] the prodical son save me oh my father
[1:00:34] I'm returning to thee a son of God can
[1:00:37] go a long time before he recognizes that
[1:00:41] he is a son before he recognizes he's a
[1:00:44] son then we tell about the story of the
[1:00:46] eagle you see you always an eagle he
[1:00:49] acted like a chicken for a while while
[1:00:51] he was while but but he could not be
[1:00:54] satisfied.
[1:00:56] None of the world can satisfy you. Once
[1:00:58] you're a son of God, you being special
[1:01:01] when you are born again. You recognize
[1:01:03] who you are. Nothing can satisfy you of
[1:01:05] the world.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; You can actually we can actually say no
[1:01:08] go try things in the world but you'll
[1:01:10] never be satisfied.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; If you are really son of God, you'll
[1:01:14] never be satisfied. You go there,
[1:01:15] there's still something missing. No,
[1:01:17] that's not my place. That's not my
[1:01:18] place. until you come back recognize
[1:01:21] like the prodical son and the brother
[1:01:22] put it so well the prodical son he was
[1:01:24] there but he realized that what am I
[1:01:26] doing here I have to go back to my
[1:01:29] father I have to go back to my place
[1:01:31] because as a son of god you can never be
[1:01:34] satisfied by the things of the world you
[1:01:37] see he always he act like a chicken for
[1:01:39] a while but he could not be satisfied
[1:01:41] when he heard the call of the great
[1:01:43] eagle he came to his own place once a
[1:01:46] true son of god hears the cry of the
[1:01:48] spirit by the word, he too will realize
[1:01:52] who he is and one to the great prophet
[1:01:54] eagle and be with him forever seated in
[1:01:58] heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; It says, "Now comes our triumphal
[1:02:04] capstone on the baptism with the Holy
[1:02:06] Ghost. When the fullness of time was
[1:02:09] come, God sent forth his son." Galatians
[1:02:11] 4 4:7 made of woman made under the law
[1:02:15] to redeem their that was under the law
[1:02:17] that we might receive the adoption of
[1:02:20] sons and because you are sons God has
[1:02:23] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[1:02:25] your heart crying aba father why are you
[1:02:29] born again it's because you are sons
[1:02:31] amen
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; the holy ghost does not make you sons
[1:02:34] and daughters of god the holy ghost
[1:02:37] comes to confirm that you are sons and
[1:02:39] daughters of god
[1:02:40] Because you can only the seed of God can
[1:02:43] be reborn. Only the seed of God has
[1:02:46] something that can be quickened. Amen.
[1:02:48] So because you are sons, God has sent
[1:02:50] the spirit upon you that's crying aba
[1:02:54] father.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; So the Christlike character can only be
[1:02:59] on those who are sheep from the
[1:03:00] beginning.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; You cannot have Christ character on
[1:03:04] something else but those who have been
[1:03:06] from the beginning. Amen. So if you go
[1:03:08] in in Psalm 2023 that we all know by
[1:03:12] heart is a relationship between the
[1:03:14] shepherd and the sheep. The shepherd and
[1:03:17] the sheep. The sheep the shepherd takes
[1:03:19] care of everything. The sheep just has
[1:03:21] to be willing to follow what the
[1:03:23] shepherd is doing. That's what we are.
[1:03:25] We have to follow what the shepherd is
[1:03:27] doing in the time that you are living
[1:03:29] in. I want to put that as a a
[1:03:31] foundation. But I want to put go a
[1:03:33] little further. There is there is there
[1:03:35] there is a side there is a there is a
[1:03:37] there is a there there is a side to that
[1:03:39] that the prophet put in the same message
[1:03:41] and I just want to put the emphasis you
[1:03:43] all know it but just good to repeat that
[1:03:45] and for the sake of of continuity of the
[1:03:49] Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; The prophet says character is a victory.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Character is not a gift.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Character is a victory.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Character is not a gift. That's
[1:04:03] wonderful because
[1:04:06] we have the potential but that potential
[1:04:09] that is inside of you if you don't let
[1:04:12] it operate it stays dormant.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; You need to let that potential to be
[1:04:18] manifested. So there is part that is a
[1:04:20] gift but for in order for it to be
[1:04:23] manifest in the fullness there is a part
[1:04:26] where you have to cooperate with God.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many have been there? There's
[1:04:31] a part where you have to cooperate with
[1:04:33] God. Character is not is not a victory.
[1:04:37] A character is a victory. Rather,
[1:04:39] character is a victory is not a gift. Is
[1:04:42] not something that is given to you in
[1:04:45] the full maturity to you. No.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; A child that is born has the potential
[1:04:53] him. You cannot ask a child. You cannot
[1:04:56] you cannot like I said the beginning you
[1:04:57] cannot ask a pig to manifest the
[1:05:00] character of of a sheep. It cannot be
[1:05:03] manifested but the sheep has to grow for
[1:05:08] that character to be manifested.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:15] The dictionary says character is the
[1:05:18] moral spiritual quality formed within a
[1:05:21] person through choices and trials and
[1:05:24] disciplines and obedience.
[1:05:27] So character should be I'll say the
[1:05:29] character should be the foundation of
[1:05:32] authority. As the prophet will say here
[1:05:35] a character
[1:05:37] is not a character is not a gift. A
[1:05:39] character a character is not a gift. A
[1:05:42] character is a victory without
[1:05:45] character. A man without character can't
[1:05:47] reign because power apart from character
[1:05:50] is satanic.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; But power with character is fit to rule.
[1:05:55] Without character, the power will
[1:05:58] corrupt the person.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; If you have the power and you don't have
[1:06:02] the character, the power that you have
[1:06:05] actually is not helping you.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; The character the power that you have
[1:06:10] without the character might you bring it
[1:06:13] further from God than should draw you
[1:06:15] closer to God.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; So in order to have the real power, you
[1:06:19] should have first the real character.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because power corrupts
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; like it corrupted soul. It corrected
[1:06:28] Amen. As we saw that last time, he
[1:06:29] corrected soul. Soul had the power but
[1:06:32] didn't have the character. That's why he
[1:06:34] misused that power. Amen. Misuse that
[1:06:38] power. Amen. But if you really have
[1:06:40] power and and you have real character,
[1:06:43] the power should bring you become a
[1:06:46] servant. Real power should make you a
[1:06:48] servant. If you have the real character.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:52] If you have the real character, the
[1:06:54] position of authority, your position of
[1:06:57] power should make you a servant for
[1:06:59] others. Like Joseph had the power. He
[1:07:03] had the power, but God had to make him
[1:07:05] go through some training of his
[1:07:08] character to the point with his power,
[1:07:10] he was a servant to others. He was a
[1:07:13] servant to save life to others. He was a
[1:07:16] servant even to give life to his to his
[1:07:19] brothers, to his brothers, to his
[1:07:21] family, to Israel. Why? Because he had
[1:07:23] the right character. Amen. Character
[1:07:26] makes you a servant. Character makes the
[1:07:29] power. Power with character makes you a
[1:07:32] servant for others. Amen.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; See Daniel, he had the power by the
[1:07:36] power that he had. True character make
[1:07:39] him a servant to others. Amen. We saw
[1:07:42] with Mori the power that he had but with
[1:07:45] a good character the power makes him a
[1:07:48] servant to others. Amen. The prophet
[1:07:51] says Jesus counts character. He does not
[1:07:54] count members.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we want more members
[1:07:59] but God wants more character.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; We want members with character. Amen. He
[1:08:06] says you know that he counts character.
[1:08:08] God always try to get one man in his
[1:08:11] hand.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, I pray that I'm that man. I pray
[1:08:15] that is your desire too. God, I want to
[1:08:17] be that man. I want to be that woman.
[1:08:19] God always try to get one man in his
[1:08:22] hand. That's all he needs is is one man
[1:08:25] and he will do his work through that
[1:08:28] that you and he'll do his work through
[1:08:30] the years. Jim, he could only find one
[1:08:33] righteous man in the time of Noah. In
[1:08:36] the time of Moses, you only find one
[1:08:38] righteous man. In the time of Samson, he
[1:08:41] find just one righteous man, Samson. But
[1:08:45] remember, Samson had a gift.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; But didn't have the character.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Because with his gift, even though he
[1:08:52] had a gift, he still failed. But when he
[1:08:56] realized that he had to depend on God,
[1:08:58] that his character had to be molded. And
[1:09:01] so what is character?
[1:09:03] That's a good question. What is
[1:09:05] character? I think the main thing how we
[1:09:07] can define character is to be willing to
[1:09:10] follow God's word no matter what.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Willing to follow God no matter what.
[1:09:16] Willing to die to ourel. Willing to deny
[1:09:19] yourself. Willing to put your ambitions
[1:09:22] away and just follow God's will. Amen.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; If if you come to that level, God, no
[1:09:27] matter who in which status I am, no
[1:09:29] matter you you are born again, but you
[1:09:32] know, you you be born again, but you
[1:09:33] might not have the real character to
[1:09:35] follow the word of God all the time.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; The prophet says Peter had a sword. He
[1:09:45] pulled that sword going to cut the high
[1:09:47] priest ears off and things like that and
[1:09:50] did it. But when he come to real
[1:09:52] Christian carriage, he didn't have it.
[1:09:54] He backed up and denied him. Is that
[1:09:56] right? He could cut the high priest here
[1:09:58] off his his sword shoe. He know how to
[1:10:01] handle it. He had the gift how to handle
[1:10:03] it but didn't have the character in the
[1:10:06] time of pressure. Says when he come to
[1:10:08] the squeeze and time to stand on the
[1:10:10] word of God, he didn't have the
[1:10:11] character and even denied he know Jesus
[1:10:14] Christ. Proverb says he didn't have the
[1:10:17] Holy Ghost. He didn't have the personal
[1:10:18] experience. Yes, he didn't have the Holy
[1:10:21] Ghost, but I would say he didn't have
[1:10:22] also the character to stand with the
[1:10:24] word of God. God doesn't measure success
[1:10:27] by crowds, by numbers, organization. As
[1:10:30] the prophet was saying this morning in
[1:10:31] the tape, impersonations says God wants
[1:10:35] the quality of Christlike character as
[1:10:38] an individual.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; God, may you give us that character
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; and may you help us to grow in that
[1:10:44] character of Christ. Amen.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; One man in his hand is all he needs to
[1:10:49] fulfill his purpose.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; God looks at the heart, not numbers or
[1:10:54] outward strength. Samson Samson Samuel
[1:10:57] at one time he went to anoint the people
[1:10:59] and the children of of of
[1:11:04] is the name I forgot of Oed.
[1:11:07] As he came there and he wanted to he
[1:11:10] wanted to anoint them. He was looking at
[1:11:11] the other statue. He was looking at how
[1:11:13] big they look. But God says, "No, I have
[1:11:15] my servant. He has the character that I
[1:11:18] want. He's man after my heart. He's a
[1:11:20] man after my heart." Because he will put
[1:11:22] he will put his ambition away and follow
[1:11:25] God's word as the word would would want
[1:11:27] to say. Amen. That's what God desire.
[1:11:29] God wants a man with real character.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Real character isn't proven in good
[1:11:36] times.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; In good times, everybody's good.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. In good times, everybody's good.
[1:11:42] But in the time of pressure, in the time
[1:11:44] of squeeze, that's when you'll see the
[1:11:47] real person. That's when you see the
[1:11:49] real character.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; That's when you see if you can stand
[1:11:53] with the word of God or not. Amen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; God is looking for character.
[1:12:01] Elzo when he went to get the bride of
[1:12:04] Isaac, he sweat it out until he found
[1:12:06] character.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Remember Abraham put him responsible. As
[1:12:10] God put us responsible, we ministers to
[1:12:13] hunt hunt the bride. God bless your
[1:12:16] heart. Prophet says it isn't looking for
[1:12:19] members. I'm looking for the pure in
[1:12:21] heart. Somebody that will believe the
[1:12:23] word. Elzo looked and he thought, "Oh, I
[1:12:27] can't do this myself. There is too much
[1:12:29] responsibility." I realized this
[1:12:32] responsibility of finding Isaac which is
[1:12:34] the type of the church you know Christ
[1:12:36] Rebecca the type of the brideza got down
[1:12:39] on his knees and said God you just have
[1:12:42] to help me in this time where he was
[1:12:45] sent Baram had the same commission to
[1:12:47] look for the bride and barbwam look for
[1:12:51] the bride but he realized he could look
[1:12:53] he could not he could not count on his
[1:12:55] own ability he was a seventh grade he
[1:12:57] had a seventh grade education he could
[1:12:59] say no but but God, I can't speak
[1:13:01] properly. I I don't I don't I don't have
[1:13:03] that potential. I I don't have the
[1:13:05] potential. I'm not educated. I'm not a
[1:13:07] good preacher. All the different things.
[1:13:09] God had to respond, it's not it's not
[1:13:11] your problem.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; It's it's my problem.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; I've called you to do the work, but I
[1:13:17] will look for the bride.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; God will search for the bride. Amen. God
[1:13:21] was searching for you. God was searching
[1:13:23] for me. As as Elza went there, Elza did
[1:13:26] not choose Rebecca by by by the look. He
[1:13:30] had to rely on God. God, I realize that
[1:13:33] it's my responsibility, but I cannot
[1:13:35] depend on the look. I cannot depend on
[1:13:37] the outside. I have to depend on you
[1:13:40] intervening supernaturally. God calling
[1:13:43] you is not a man calling you.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; This is the bride calling you. Amen. The
[1:13:47] bridegroom calling you. Amen. Is the
[1:13:50] bride being called by himself. Amen. The
[1:13:53] angel of the Lord was already there. He
[1:13:55] knew when to send Rebecca on time.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Think about it. From all the virgin
[1:14:00] woman to come on that well, he knew when
[1:14:03] that one had to come at that specific
[1:14:05] time.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; As he was still praying, he saw her
[1:14:08] coming.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw her because the angel of
[1:14:11] the Lord had had to had to had to put an
[1:14:14] inspiration to go at the right time.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; I like what brother Gibbert said. They
[1:14:18] say, you know, when the prodical son
[1:14:20] went there, it was the angel of the Lord
[1:14:22] dealing with the prodical son.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; It was not the father dealing with the
[1:14:26] prodical son. The angel had to deal with
[1:14:28] the prodical son to bring him back.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; The same thing for you. It was God
[1:14:33] calling you. Amen. Not a man calling
[1:14:35] you.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, when you predestination is just
[1:14:44] wonderful.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.
[1:14:50] Elazar got on his knees and said, "God,
[1:14:53] you just have to help me." When he
[1:14:56] referred to God, God helped him. He got
[1:14:59] character. Come back to the word,
[1:15:00] brother. Come back to God. God, don't
[1:15:02] pay any attention to this church you
[1:15:04] belong to. You can stay there if you
[1:15:06] want to. If they let you, but the thing
[1:15:09] to do is first come to God.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. that when Eleazar found
[1:15:15] the character that was in the woman
[1:15:17] Rebecca, that beautiful bride of Isaac.
[1:15:19] He told her about Isaac. She never
[1:15:22] questioned one thing, she believed the
[1:15:24] word of the messenger and she made ready
[1:15:27] to go. That's the real character. You
[1:15:30] don't have to question anything about
[1:15:32] God. When the word of God says one
[1:15:35] thing, you say amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; You believe. You might not understand,
[1:15:38] but just say amen.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; If the prophet said it, I just say amen.
[1:15:42] I've seen the supernatural. She had to
[1:15:44] see the supernatural. She realized that
[1:15:46] no from all the women God has sent her
[1:15:49] only to her and she did something that
[1:15:51] the prophet ask her that the prophet did
[1:15:54] not ask her to do. He asked her only
[1:15:57] give me drink some drink. But herself by
[1:16:01] divine predestination she had that
[1:16:03] desire to even give drink to the
[1:16:06] cameras. Amen. something extra that the
[1:16:09] prophet
[1:16:10] had caught in his in his mind and kept
[1:16:12] it for himself but didn't express it but
[1:16:15] she did the extra of what the prophet
[1:16:17] asked her.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Do you know that you are doing the extra
[1:16:21] what God asked you?
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.
[1:16:32] Can
[1:16:51] You come at the point sometimes the
[1:16:53] prophet doesn't say um and is is a bit
[1:16:57] asking are you Malachi 4? Are you the
[1:17:00] prophet of Malachi 4? He's kind of
[1:17:01] hesitating on what to say about it but
[1:17:04] you could pick it up said no
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; you cannot have any other prophet
[1:17:08] fulfilling Malachi 4 than this prophet.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are picking up something that
[1:17:13] is not even written that is not even
[1:17:15] said clearly but you can pick up this is
[1:17:18] nothing else but the prophet that was
[1:17:20] promised in Malachi 4. You are going
[1:17:22] beyond what has been told to you. Amen.
[1:17:25] Because you have the same character as
[1:17:27] Rebecca had the same character.
[1:17:29] Something that is not told told you but
[1:17:31] you can pick it up. Amen. Wonderful God.
[1:17:34] Wonderful God that God can give us a
[1:17:35] desire to do his perfect will even
[1:17:38] though not completely expressed as we
[1:17:40] can say. And she went and asked the
[1:17:44] father and said just the prophet
[1:17:46] continue the quote said they went and
[1:17:47] asked the father and said just ask her
[1:17:49] the damsels of age asked her let her
[1:17:52] decision be and she said I will go.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; The character says I will go. She said I
[1:17:57] will go to what? A man she had never
[1:17:59] seen knowing nothing about. You have not
[1:18:03] seen God. You not seen Jesus Christ
[1:18:05] physically, but you still accept what
[1:18:08] he's telling you. And your desire is
[1:18:10] Elzo, tell me more.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Elzo, tell me more.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Tell me more about my husband. Tell me
[1:18:17] what he likes. I don't want to
[1:18:19] compromise on anything that he wants. I
[1:18:21] want to follow everything that Elazot is
[1:18:23] telling me. Amen. Because Eleazar knows
[1:18:26] the mind of the husband. Elzar knows the
[1:18:30] mind of Isaac. Elzo is is telling him
[1:18:34] telling her the details that herself
[1:18:36] could not know. But Elzo has been has
[1:18:40] been with with Isaac. He knows what
[1:18:42] Isaac likes. Amen. A prophet is in
[1:18:44] connection with God. He has no thought
[1:18:47] of himself. He's expressing the thought
[1:18:49] of God to the bride.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; And we are willing to accept anything
[1:18:53] that the message says.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; That's the real character of the bride
[1:18:58] is to accept anything that the prophet
[1:19:00] says. I might not understand it but I
[1:19:03] agree with it.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; The prophet says and continue about
[1:19:14] Rebecca says as soon as she had made to
[1:19:16] her quickly her mind was made up she
[1:19:18] said I will go and she mounted upon the
[1:19:20] camel went to meet the very camel she
[1:19:23] watered was the camel that packed her to
[1:19:24] a bridegroom and owned her success. The
[1:19:27] very camel, the very power of that beast
[1:19:31] in the Bible represent power. The very
[1:19:33] power that we give water and praise to
[1:19:36] water life praise to to the word is the
[1:19:39] very thing that packs us into the glory
[1:19:42] land to meet the bridegroom.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; What is it? The same word of God that
[1:19:46] you are feeding on is giving power to
[1:19:48] the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost
[1:19:50] feeds upon the word of God.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost does not feed upon
[1:19:54] fables. that don't feed about
[1:19:56] documentaries that don't feed about you
[1:19:59] know geography thing the Holy Ghost
[1:20:01] feeds upon the word of God
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; as the bride of Christ having Christ
[1:20:06] character we must feed the Holy Ghost
[1:20:09] inside of us
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; it's it it's it's an encouragement you
[1:20:13] have to listen to the word of God you
[1:20:15] have to read the Bible every day you
[1:20:17] have to listen to the tape you have to
[1:20:19] come to church if you want to make it
[1:20:21] for the rapture you have you you have to
[1:20:24] do those things.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; You are predestinated to it, but you
[1:20:28] have to do it. Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Predestination does not mean, oh,
[1:20:34] whenever it comes, it will come.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; No. Predestination means you recognize
[1:20:39] that it belongs to me. It's my
[1:20:41] responsibility. I have to do it. Amen.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Rebecca, she recognized, oh, I am I am
[1:20:46] the bride. I have been chosen. God chose
[1:20:49] me. It's not this man who chose me. He
[1:20:51] had he made a prayer. I recognize who I
[1:20:54] am. Now I'm I have to go. Father, don't
[1:20:57] hinder me.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Oh no, we try to hinder you. Can you
[1:21:00] stay one more time? Can you know enjoy
[1:21:02] this? Can you? No, that I don't have
[1:21:04] that time. No, that's not I don't have
[1:21:07] that time. I'm already been selected. I
[1:21:09] already been predestinated. I already
[1:21:10] been chosen by God. The choosing of the
[1:21:13] bride. He already chose me. So I will
[1:21:15] go. I'm not spending time here. I'm
[1:21:17] going.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; That Christlike character.
[1:21:22] You feed the Holy Ghost with with the
[1:21:26] word of God. With the praise. Amen.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Praise. Yes. Praise to the word of God.
[1:21:31] The devil will come sometime through
[1:21:33] trials and trying to put you down. You
[1:21:35] praise the Lord. Lord, I praise you. I
[1:21:37] praise your word. And you are the
[1:21:39] healer. You are the comforter. You are
[1:21:41] the savior. Lord, you will never be
[1:21:43] defeated. I praise you, Lord.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; The more you feed the Holy Ghost, the
[1:21:48] more it has more power inside of you.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:54] Amen.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Very good principle there.
[1:21:59] I don't think this is my note. I don't
[1:22:01] think Rebecca Rebecca had the gift of
[1:22:05] giving water to camels.
[1:22:08] So, oh, she has a wonderful gift of
[1:22:10] giving water.
[1:22:12] That was not a gift.
[1:22:15] The gift was she had that desire.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; That's the gift. It was given to God.
[1:22:22] She had that desire.
[1:22:24] But the other part, she had to do it.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; That's the character. So now I have that
[1:22:29] desire. Now I'm doing it. It was not an
[1:22:32] easy thing. You give a cup the camels
[1:22:34] and that it. No, you have to. A camel
[1:22:36] takes a lot. One brother put that in
[1:22:38] calculation that I to find. They drink a
[1:22:41] lot. They drink a lot. So she was
[1:22:44] putting one camel. One camel. One. So
[1:22:46] no, no, no, no. I'm safe. Ah, I'll stay
[1:22:49] home and everything and that's
[1:22:51] everything is fine. No, God is
[1:22:53] predestinated me. Hallelujah. Amen. No,
[1:22:55] no, no. You come to church on winter is
[1:22:59] coming soon. We will see the real
[1:23:00] Christian.
[1:23:07] I know today snow check there. Oh, I
[1:23:10] check the weather. No, no. Brother
[1:23:12] Andrew will take care of stream.
[1:23:17] God give me that Christlike character.
[1:23:19] I'm predestinated, but I'm going to feed
[1:23:22] the Holy Ghost with the water. Amen.
[1:23:25] With the food. Amen.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Christlike character. Go into action
[1:23:30] like Rebecca. I will do it.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; How many me there?
[1:23:42] To one is given by the spirit the word
[1:23:44] of wisdom, to another the word of
[1:23:45] knowledge, by the same spirit, to
[1:23:46] another faith by the same spirit, to
[1:23:48] another gift of healing by the same
[1:23:50] spirit, to another working of miracles,
[1:23:52] to another prophecy, to another
[1:23:53] discerning of spirit, to another diverse
[1:23:55] kind of tongues. To another the
[1:23:57] interpretation of tongues. None of these
[1:23:59] are about reading, hearing, and
[1:24:02] listening to the word of God. Those
[1:24:04] actions of reading, hearing, listening
[1:24:07] are not spiritual gift but are basic
[1:24:11] responsibilities and disciplines for
[1:24:13] every believer.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Because faith comes by hearing and
[1:24:18] hearing by the word of God. You have
[1:24:21] been predestinated to have the eternal
[1:24:23] faith, the faith, the perfect faith of
[1:24:25] God. But you need to be hearing to the
[1:24:27] word of God. Amen. Because that faith
[1:24:30] need to be increased by reading the word
[1:24:32] of God. Amen.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; As a pastor of the church, I'm
[1:24:34] encouraging each believer to be strong
[1:24:37] in listening to the tape, in praying.
[1:24:40] Amen. That's what will make the church
[1:24:43] strong. That's what will make the
[1:24:45] ministers to recognize whether this is
[1:24:48] from God or this not from God.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; A church has to be strong to recognize
[1:24:52] no this is I will check on the
[1:24:54] ministers. Why did you say that? Bam.
[1:24:56] Never say that.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; How would you know that? If you don't
[1:24:59] listen to it,
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; you just taking everything, taking
[1:25:02] everything, taking everything.
[1:25:03] Hallelujah. Hey, hey, hey. No, you need
[1:25:06] to know. No, this is not I've never
[1:25:08] heard that.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; The pastor will check, you know, it was
[1:25:12] a sleep of the time. I'm sorry. I will
[1:25:14] apologize.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; The minister know I went there. Maybe I
[1:25:18] said I didn't know I didn't mean to say
[1:25:20] that because you have to be responsible
[1:25:23] what you are eating too. Amen. We need
[1:25:24] to be strong. Amen.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Rebecca was watering the power of the
[1:25:36] virtue feeding the Holy Ghost with the
[1:25:38] water following the pr following this
[1:25:40] principle. What we water is what is
[1:25:43] going to carry us. Galatians 6:7 says,
[1:25:46] "Be not deceived. God is not mocked. For
[1:25:49] whatsoever man seweth, that shall he
[1:25:51] also reap. For he that sweth to the
[1:25:54] flesh shall shall of the flesh reap
[1:25:57] corruption. But he that sweth to the
[1:25:59] spirit shall of the spirit reap life
[1:26:01] everlasting.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; If you sow the word of God in you, if
[1:26:05] you you are in the atmosphere of prayer
[1:26:07] and if you stay in that channel as we
[1:26:09] heard on Sunday on Wednesday, if you
[1:26:11] stay in that channel, God is going to
[1:26:13] bless you. God is bound to honor his own
[1:26:16] word. Amen. But you have to stay in that
[1:26:19] channel. Amen. It has already been
[1:26:21] opened. We have to stay in that channel.
[1:26:23] By God's grace has been open to some
[1:26:25] people. It's not open. They will never
[1:26:27] see it. But by God's grace, it has been
[1:26:30] open to us. We need to grow in that
[1:26:32] channel. Amen. We need to sow to the
[1:26:35] spirit. Amen. With the word of God.
[1:26:37] Amen. Feeding with the word of God. The
[1:26:39] Holy Spirit. Feeding with the word of
[1:26:41] God. That's what becomes strong. Rebecca
[1:26:44] did not delay, question, negotiate. She
[1:26:46] believed and prepared. As Revelation
[1:26:49] 19:78 said, "The marriage of the lamb is
[1:26:51] come and his wife has made herself
[1:26:54] ready. And to her was granted that she
[1:26:57] should be a red in fine linen, clean and
[1:26:59] white, for the fine fine linen is the
[1:27:02] righteousness of saints." Yes, it has
[1:27:04] been granted for her the robe, the word
[1:27:07] of God. Babam had the ministry as Elzar
[1:27:11] to to to to dress us with that robe. He
[1:27:14] gave us that robe, the word of God.
[1:27:16] Amen.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; He gave us that word of God. But now
[1:27:19] it's us. We have to make oursel ready
[1:27:21] applying the word of God. Now
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; I need to apply the word of God.
[1:27:26] Sometimes you say, "Oh, no. Can you get
[1:27:28] rid of this? Can you?" But says, "No,
[1:27:30] you have to be willing to do it."
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; That's what my emphasis this morning. If
[1:27:34] I if some you can think you can go with
[1:27:36] it this morning is God make me willing
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; to do your word.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Just make me willing.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. The problem is sometime comes we
[1:27:46] are not willing enough.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; We think about the next step. If I do
[1:27:50] this my wife is not going to love me. If
[1:27:52] I do this my husband is going to love
[1:27:53] me. If I do this my my teacher or we we
[1:27:56] are not willing to give in.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Don't think of what the consequences. Be
[1:28:01] willing to do it.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Prophet says now we know that there is
[1:28:08] going to be a bride and there's going to
[1:28:10] be a wedding supper served in the skies.
[1:28:13] marriage of the lamb that just as sure
[1:28:15] as to be as God is because that his
[1:28:18] word. We know that those that are going
[1:28:20] to make up that bride is going to be his
[1:28:22] church and are going to appear before
[1:28:24] him without spot or wrinkle. They have
[1:28:27] the material on earth now to make
[1:28:29] themselves ready. We have the word of
[1:28:32] God to make ourselves ready.
[1:28:34] We can't make oursel ready with the
[1:28:37] doctrine and creeds of Pentecostals and
[1:28:40] and and and and
[1:28:43] other denominations. We have the pure
[1:28:45] word of God to make ourel ready.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:53] If you notice he said she has made
[1:28:55] herself ready. So many says if the Lord
[1:28:58] will take this evil spirit from me from
[1:29:00] drinking or from gambling, from lying or
[1:29:03] stealing, I will serve him.
[1:29:07] The prophet put the balance there. Of
[1:29:09] course, God has to do that. And thank
[1:29:11] God it's him doing that because if you
[1:29:13] force yourself to do it, you'll fall
[1:29:15] back.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; That that's why the psychiatrist and all
[1:29:19] the people, they fail because they're
[1:29:21] trying to put things you have to do. But
[1:29:24] the prophet goes and says, he put a
[1:29:25] balance to that. Says, but it's also up
[1:29:29] to you. You've got to do something too.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; They that overcome shall inherit all
[1:29:35] things. They that overcome, you have
[1:29:38] power to do it,
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; but you must be willing to lay down.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; I think that's a problem. We must be
[1:29:46] willing to lay down. She has made
[1:29:48] herself ready. I liked that word. God
[1:29:50] could not push us through a little pipe,
[1:29:53] pull us out of the other hand and then
[1:29:55] say, "Blessed is he that overcometh."
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; He put you here and draw. Oh, you are an
[1:30:01] overcomer. Oh, wonderful. You overcame.
[1:30:05] No, God gives you the anointing for the
[1:30:07] age.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; How you can use that and give them if
[1:30:10] you allow that anointing to use you,
[1:30:12] that anointing is going to overcome.
[1:30:14] Amen. But yourself, you have to be
[1:30:16] willing. Lord, I accept the anointing of
[1:30:18] the age. I accept the eagle anointing
[1:30:20] for the age as in the similar age they
[1:30:22] had to accept that the anointing of God
[1:30:24] the same in our time we accept the
[1:30:26] anointing of God and we'll be
[1:30:28] overcomers. Amen. But you have to be
[1:30:31] willing. Amen.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; God will not push us through a little
[1:30:35] pipe puts us out on the other hand and
[1:30:37] then say blessed is he that overcometh.
[1:30:39] You had nothing to overcome. He just
[1:30:41] pushed you through. You've got to make
[1:30:43] decisions for yourself.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; That's why character comes.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; You have to make decisions. Oh, I know
[1:30:52] the word of God says this.
[1:30:55] So now in this situation, what shall I
[1:30:57] do?
[1:30:59] When the preacher is not there, when the
[1:31:01] deacon is not there, when the parents
[1:31:03] are not there, when when the one who
[1:31:05] testify to you the message the first
[1:31:07] time is not there, now you have to make
[1:31:09] a decisions.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; That's where character comes. and you
[1:31:13] say, "Lord, I'm taking your word because
[1:31:16] it's not about others. It's my own
[1:31:18] decisions. I'm taking the word of God
[1:31:20] and I move forward."
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you do that all the time, God
[1:31:25] says, "Oh, he has the character." Amen.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; In doing that we show our faith and
[1:31:40] respect respect to God. Amen.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Now the message says the close is that
[1:31:49] fact the God deals with Israel only when
[1:31:51] she's in homeland.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; When Abraham left the homeland and went
[1:31:55] down into Egypt, what happened? He
[1:31:57] walked away from the will of God and
[1:31:59] never was blessed till he returned back
[1:32:01] to the homeland.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Was not Abraham predestinated for the
[1:32:05] homeland? Oh yes, he was predestinated
[1:32:08] from the homeland. But in the statues of
[1:32:10] virtue there, God is saying, you know,
[1:32:13] Abraham, you know, for you for the
[1:32:15] blessing to be applied upon you, you
[1:32:17] have to come back into homeland. You
[1:32:19] have to come back in the homeland.
[1:32:21] That's where my blessing is. You have to
[1:32:24] come back into homeland. outside of
[1:32:26] homeland my covenant yes it stands but
[1:32:30] it doesn't express itself in the
[1:32:31] fullness you have to come in the
[1:32:33] homeland amen go never dealt with him
[1:32:36] not one vision not nothing else till he
[1:32:39] come back to the homeland they say look
[1:32:41] at Israel when they were sent down in
[1:32:43] Egypt 400 years not one miracle not one
[1:32:47] sign not one thing happened among them
[1:32:50] not record in the history of the book
[1:32:52] God never did deal with Israel till she
[1:32:55] come to her homeland.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Then prophet says, "Hear me." Thus
[1:32:59] sayith the Lord. God will not deal with
[1:33:01] his church till she comes back to the
[1:33:04] homeland. The message of the hour.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; So what is our homeland is the message
[1:33:09] of the hour.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Thank God we are back to our homeland.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Thank God we want to stay in our
[1:33:15] homeland.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; That's why the blessing is here. The
[1:33:18] blessing of healing is in our homeland.
[1:33:21] And in that homeland, you know, you can
[1:33:23] borrow yourself to that homeland to
[1:33:25] just, oh, this is just my corner. I stay
[1:33:26] in that corner. No, in this homeland,
[1:33:29] the homeland belongs to us. Amen.
[1:33:32] Healing belongs to us. The joy of
[1:33:34] salvation belongs to us. The salvation
[1:33:36] of our children belongs to us. In this
[1:33:39] homeland, we have all inheritance. Amen.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; You just nailed and you you cast out all
[1:33:44] those demons. Amen. The giant are in the
[1:33:47] land. But we have to go in the land and
[1:33:49] possess our land.
[1:33:52] Sorry.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Caleb was in the homeland. He was He
[1:33:57] could have stayed the way he could stay.
[1:33:59] He was in the homeland. Just I have a
[1:34:01] small portion here. I'm saved. I'm
[1:34:04] That's all it's good for me. I'm saved.
[1:34:05] I'm in the homeland. But one day he had
[1:34:08] a revelation. You know what? I'm in the
[1:34:10] homeland. But I see a big mountain that
[1:34:12] belongs to me there.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; That big mountain belongs to me and
[1:34:15] belongs to my children. I see the giant
[1:34:18] on on those mountain. Holy Ghost Joshua,
[1:34:21] you are the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost, give me my mountain.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not resting until I give me my
[1:34:28] mountain. Amen.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost says, "Oh, if you
[1:34:31] want that mountain, yeah, go and possess
[1:34:32] that mountain." And he had to fight for
[1:34:35] every inch of that mountain. And he
[1:34:37] possessed the mountain. Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of in this
[1:34:41] homeland, the message of the hour, let
[1:34:43] me encourage you this morning, you can
[1:34:45] possess it this morning. Amen.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Because the promise of God, the
[1:34:49] blessings upon the seed of Abraham, the
[1:34:52] seed of Abraham shall possess all the
[1:34:54] gates of the enemy. Amen.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Vers God give Israel the promised land
[1:35:06] while they were still in Egypt they had
[1:35:08] to fight every inch of that land. God
[1:35:10] told Joshua and Joshua one wherever the
[1:35:13] souls of your food treads upon that I
[1:35:16] give you for a possession. So footprints
[1:35:19] mean footprints means possession.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people can just get just
[1:35:23] barely to the edge of the land.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Some can take the twohanded sword and
[1:35:29] cut their way through Philistines and
[1:35:31] Amorite till they get the whole thing.
[1:35:34] That what we should do. Amen. Every
[1:35:36] promise is to us.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Footprint is possession.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Walk right up and take it. God give it
[1:35:42] to us. It's a promise and that a truth
[1:35:45] and it's for us.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Footprint is possession. Whatever you
[1:35:49] are possessing, don't let it go.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; You stay there. It belongs to me.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not letting it go. Amen. It It's my
[1:35:57] possession. It's my inheritance. I'm not
[1:36:00] going to let the devil try to rob me
[1:36:02] from my possession.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:09] Oh, time is going so fast before I even
[1:36:11] went into my
[1:36:18] Now
[1:36:20] don't be discouraged. You might hear me
[1:36:22] preach the message of prophecy. You
[1:36:24] might see the Holy Spirit discern and do
[1:36:26] great things and perform miracles.
[1:36:28] Sometimes you might pray and it will
[1:36:30] never come to pass right away. Says go
[1:36:33] on, your reward comes at the end.
[1:36:36] Wouldn't that be better right there? Do
[1:36:38] Jesus a service. The end time message,
[1:36:41] he had a bride. God's looking for
[1:36:42] character. Then after Lazar found the
[1:36:45] character, then the next thing was
[1:36:46] getting her ready to go. That the same
[1:36:48] now, brother. The same now. The end time
[1:36:50] message is not out yonder in Babylon.
[1:36:54] But I want to say this. Prophet says
[1:36:57] sometimes we pray wrong. Says when you
[1:37:00] pray, you do what do you pray? Says ask
[1:37:02] for so and so certain things. I didn't
[1:37:04] get it. He's talking about that person,
[1:37:07] you know, he prayed and didn't get in
[1:37:08] and says, you know what, I don't believe
[1:37:09] in the Bible anymore. Says, you know,
[1:37:11] you're praying wrong.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; He says, I said, you pray wrong. You
[1:37:15] should never pray to change God's mind.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; We should pray to change our mind.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; God's mind don't need any changing.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's where we fail. Oh, I
[1:37:27] did that. I pray, I pray, I didn't see
[1:37:28] it happen right away. Then, oh no, that
[1:37:31] then you get discouraged. The enemy
[1:37:33] comes and God doesn't hear your prayer
[1:37:34] and this message is not the truth
[1:37:35] because this this this or this this this
[1:37:38] sometimes we put too much on I will make
[1:37:40] you a millionaire once become a
[1:37:41] Christians and the person doesn't become
[1:37:43] a millionaire no
[1:37:46] put in the wrong place
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; but says no the real Christian like
[1:37:52] character is not to change to change
[1:37:55] your mind to fit me but it's me to be
[1:37:59] changed to fit your mind
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; as you grow, realize, Lord, I want your
[1:38:03] perfect will to be done.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; I'm willing to lose everything, but your
[1:38:09] perfect will to be done cuz I want your
[1:38:12] perfect will to be done. Amen.
[1:38:16] Says, "God minds does not need any
[1:38:18] change." He says, "Now when you pray, I
[1:38:20] know a young Catholic boy one time had
[1:38:22] the prayer talking. Prayer should be
[1:38:24] Lord change me to fit your word not
[1:38:27] change not change not let me change your
[1:38:30] mind you change my mind you change my
[1:38:33] mind to your will and your will is
[1:38:36] written here in the book amen
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; and the pro the prophet says he goes
[1:38:41] even deeper say there's a certain person
[1:38:43] said to me said I believe you are an
[1:38:45] antichrist brother said yes if that will
[1:38:47] be pleasing to my lord that's what I
[1:38:49] want to be
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; I want to be whatever he wants me to be
[1:38:53] I love him. If I should cast if he
[1:38:55] should cast me into hell, I will still
[1:38:57] love him.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; If I go with the same spirit I have now,
[1:39:01] he looked at me of strange. What kind of
[1:39:03] person that is willing to accept
[1:39:05] anything that God want?
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; That's another level of a Christian.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; That one who comes to the full maturity.
[1:39:10] He loves God so much that it's not it's
[1:39:14] not anything that God can say. Oh no.
[1:39:16] No. Everything that God says I say is
[1:39:18] amen Lord.
[1:39:20] Sometimes the nos of God as better than
[1:39:23] yes.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; The nos is as good as the yes. But it's
[1:39:27] not my will, it's your will.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Do you know that Jesus Christ as a man,
[1:39:32] he had to go through that process too?
[1:39:34] He had to go to that process where he
[1:39:35] had to realize oh first time he said,
[1:39:37] "Oh God, can you would is it possible to
[1:39:39] remove the cap and get money?"
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; The prophet say he died more and he gets
[1:39:43] money than at the cross.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; We should not skip getting money. No,
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Gimman is where we die to our own will.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; The problem is our own will. We don't
[1:39:53] like to go through Gethsemane. We want
[1:39:55] to go to the end result. We want to go
[1:39:57] to the resurrection.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; But before resurrection, you have to go
[1:40:00] to Gethsemane.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Said not Lord is it possible to take the
[1:40:09] cup away? Is it possible?
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's where he had the
[1:40:18] greatest victory. The greatest victory
[1:40:21] is when it was not his will anymore.
[1:40:24] It's God's will that I had to pray a
[1:40:26] minute.
[1:40:29] Excuse me.
[1:40:38] I want to leave if you be pleased.
[1:40:39] Whatever check your objective and motive
[1:40:42] by that you know where your love of God
[1:40:44] whether you love God or not. Sometimes
[1:40:48] the Lord want to encourage someone this
[1:40:50] morning. I would say don't let suffering
[1:40:52] be a stumbling block in your Christian
[1:40:54] walk.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Certain things that suffering will bring
[1:40:58] a Christian to reject God's word. He
[1:41:00] knows it's a tool
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; suffering
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; and he you know we know the story of
[1:41:05] Job, right?
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; He knew he know the human human being so
[1:41:09] well. He knows that most of the people
[1:41:12] most of the people suffering will make
[1:41:14] them reject God.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Trials will make them reject God. on
[1:41:19] already on Wednesday.
[1:41:24] Devil is trying to disturb my throat
[1:41:26] here, but
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; I'm pressing on.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; The devil likes to He knows you put the
[1:41:32] seed there. The main thing is put the
[1:41:34] pressure of the world. The pressure
[1:41:35] thing to try to remove that seed.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; He knows. He knows how it works. But let
[1:41:40] me encourage you this morning. Don't let
[1:41:42] suffering be a stumbling block in your
[1:41:44] Christian work.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:46] But let God give us the willing or the
[1:41:49] character say God whatever you want I
[1:41:52] want to go with rejoicing on your
[1:41:54] promises praising you on your promises
[1:41:58] because your perfect will in my life is
[1:42:00] the best will
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; I had to made a choice
[1:42:06] that that's where you find the victory
[1:42:07] in love divine says you made a choice a
[1:42:10] a difficult choice
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; most of people would have taken the
[1:42:13] easiest choice the easiest easest way,
[1:42:16] the easiest way, but you chose the
[1:42:17] hardest way.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Thank God it's my way.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; That's what we desire. God, let me take
[1:42:24] your way.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; No matter how hard it is, give me the
[1:42:27] character of Christ to take your way to
[1:42:29] make the decision to take your way.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; I'm predestinated to it. I know by God's
[1:42:34] grace I'm going to overcome. But in the
[1:42:36] hard time where the trials and difficult
[1:42:39] times, help me to take your way, Lord.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; And I will have the victory. Amen. And
[1:42:44] the devil won't have any place who will
[1:42:46] try to make you turn the word of God.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; There are two things in this laia. I'm
[1:42:52] coming to my closing on my message. Two
[1:42:54] things in Laia here.
[1:42:58] The devil will use the hard way
[1:43:03] and some people will fall in the hard
[1:43:05] way. It's hard. No, it's hard. Oh, the
[1:43:08] message is hard. Oh, I can't stand in my
[1:43:10] family. Oh, this thing it becames hard
[1:43:14] but keep pressing on
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; God's character. Amen.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; The other way you'll make things so easy
[1:43:23] that you feel like I don't need God.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; It's with my own strength. I can have a
[1:43:30] work. I can have this. I can handle
[1:43:32] things on my own. Why do I need let let
[1:43:36] others take care of that? I'm I'm
[1:43:39] independent.
[1:43:42] and you'll miss your position.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; But the Christian like character is in
[1:43:46] the middle.
[1:43:48] Lord, whether suffering, whether it's
[1:43:50] easy, I want to take the right decision
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; to follow you. Amen.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; In the time of Smina, it was a very
[1:44:02] difficult time. It's a difficult age.
[1:44:04] Smina, a very difficult age.
[1:44:07] Very difficult age. They went through
[1:44:09] God himself saying, "I I know your
[1:44:10] tribulation. I know your work. I know
[1:44:12] your tribulation." He knew that they
[1:44:14] will go through suffering. He knew that.
[1:44:16] But look at it. It was one of the best
[1:44:20] age that God had to was proud of.
[1:44:24] Even though you're going to those
[1:44:25] sufferings, I know your works. I value
[1:44:29] what you are doing. I value your
[1:44:30] perseverance.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; But look at this. They have everything.
[1:44:36] rich, need of nothing and everything.
[1:44:39] And it was the the age God hates the
[1:44:41] most. Almost no no praise to that age.
[1:44:45] Says, "You have need of nothing. You are
[1:44:47] lukewarm. You think you are independent.
[1:44:49] You can do everything by yourself. I'm
[1:44:51] about to spew out because you even
[1:44:53] rejected me. You put me out. You can do
[1:44:55] everything by yourself."
[1:44:57] Amen. But the other age was suffering
[1:44:59] and everything. God says, "Oh, I'm so
[1:45:02] proud of that age. Oh God, help us to
[1:45:05] have the right character.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Love this. He has no character. They
[1:45:10] want everything easy. That's why we have
[1:45:12] so we want every instantaneous reward.
[1:45:15] Instantaneous reward. We we lack
[1:45:18] impatience. You know you you want you
[1:45:20] see the driving people are so impatient.
[1:45:23] You see when you go fast food you just
[1:45:25] want it right away. You know I want
[1:45:27] instantaneous result. I want I you know
[1:45:30] if I if I if I if I go to if I believe
[1:45:33] or if I'm a church believer I want
[1:45:34] instantaneous result I want no God give
[1:45:38] me your character if it's now it's now
[1:45:40] if it's long it's long and make me
[1:45:43] patient
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; I think that that's a great virtue
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; to have that character
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; prophet says
[1:45:53] I know there he was walking in the midst
[1:45:55] of his people there is the chief
[1:45:57] shepherd of of the flock. He does. He
[1:46:00] does. But does he hold back the
[1:46:02] persecution? Does he stem the
[1:46:04] tribulation? No, he does not. He simply
[1:46:07] says, "I know your tribulation.
[1:46:09] I'm not at all unmindful of your
[1:46:12] suffering." Encouragement this morning.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Whatever you're going through, God is
[1:46:16] not unmindful of his suffering. He knows
[1:46:19] what you're going through.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; What a stumbling block this is to so
[1:46:23] many people like Israel. They wonder if
[1:46:25] God really loved them. How can God be
[1:46:28] just and loving if he stands by and
[1:46:30] watches his people suffer? This is what
[1:46:32] they ask in Malachi 1:13. The burden of
[1:46:35] the word of God is by Israel to Malachi.
[1:46:37] I've loved you and said the Lord. Yet
[1:46:39] where is thou loved us? What was Esau
[1:46:42] Jacob's brother? The Lord is reply. Yet
[1:46:45] I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid
[1:46:47] this mountain west for the dragons of
[1:46:50] the wilderness. They could not figure
[1:46:51] out God's love. They thought that the
[1:46:53] love meant no suffering. They thought
[1:46:55] that the love meant a baby with parental
[1:46:57] care. But God say that his love was
[1:47:01] elective love.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; The proof of his love is election. That
[1:47:06] no matter what happened, his love was
[1:47:08] proven truly by the fact that they were
[1:47:10] chosen unto salvation because God has
[1:47:13] chosen you to salvation through
[1:47:15] sanctification the spirit and belief of
[1:47:17] the truth. He may commit you to death as
[1:47:20] he did Paul. He may commit you suffering
[1:47:21] as he did Jo. That is prerogative. He's
[1:47:24] sovereign. But this is all with a
[1:47:26] purpose. This is the key. If he did not
[1:47:28] have a purpose, then would be the order
[1:47:30] of frustration and not of peace. His
[1:47:33] purpose is that we have suffered a while
[1:47:36] that will be made perfect, be
[1:47:38] established, strengthened, and settled.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; He's actually, it says, you see, he
[1:47:45] himself suffered. He learned obedience
[1:47:47] by the things that he suffered. He was
[1:47:49] actually made perfect by the things that
[1:47:51] he suffered. Though the Bible says in
[1:47:53] Hebrews 5, though he were a son, yet
[1:47:56] learned he obedience by the things which
[1:47:58] he suffered, and being made perfect, he
[1:48:00] became the author of eternal salvation
[1:48:02] unto all them that obeyed him. In plain
[1:48:04] language, the very character of Jesus
[1:48:08] was perfected by suffering.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is God, but God has to
[1:48:17] become man. As I explained many times,
[1:48:19] he had to become man. follow the process
[1:48:22] of a man until he comes to the full
[1:48:25] maturity. Jesus is God. God knows
[1:48:27] everything. But Jesus as a man didn't
[1:48:30] know everything. He knew everything that
[1:48:33] God want him to know.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he says no. The day of a
[1:48:38] coming only the father knows. So he put
[1:48:40] himself in the statute where he had to
[1:48:42] live like a man. Amen. But himself being
[1:48:45] God, he has to humble himself to live
[1:48:47] like a man. He had to go through his
[1:48:49] character to accept to go through some
[1:48:52] suffering in order for that character to
[1:48:54] come to the full maturity because it's
[1:48:57] not a gift is a victory.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; I think the greatest place where he
[1:49:02] showed that character he knew what will
[1:49:04] happen in Gethsemane. He accepted but
[1:49:06] the cross he manifested. God forgive
[1:49:09] them. They don't know what they're
[1:49:11] doing.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; While they're spitting on him, God
[1:49:16] forgive them. They don't know what
[1:49:17] they're doing.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; As a bride, we make too many things. You
[1:49:20] might hear things, you might think, but
[1:49:22] God, give me that heart that can always
[1:49:24] forgive.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; As a human being, we might not be able
[1:49:29] to forgive. Right? You still have that
[1:49:32] hing,
[1:49:33] but are you willing to forgive?
[1:49:37] That's the question. Are you willing to
[1:49:39] forgive? If you are willing to forgive,
[1:49:42] God will give you that forgiven given
[1:49:45] spirit in your heart. Lord, I'm willing
[1:49:47] to forgive. I'm willing to forgive. I'm
[1:49:49] willing to humble myself. I'm willing to
[1:49:52] submit myself. Lord, you will take care
[1:49:55] of the rest. Because you are the great
[1:49:56] shepherd. He's not unmindful of our
[1:49:59] suffering. He knows what we are going
[1:50:01] through, but he has a purpose. Amen.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can love the Lord? Say,
[1:50:06] "Lord, I just want to be willing to what
[1:50:09] you want in my life and get me to have
[1:50:12] the right attitude all the time. The
[1:50:14] right attitude that I express to you is
[1:50:16] being joyful all the time. Being joyful
[1:50:19] is in the midst of trials, in the midst
[1:50:21] of difficult times. Says I have to show
[1:50:24] I have to show my attitude of being
[1:50:26] grateful to God no matter what. That's
[1:50:29] where the victory is. That's what Job
[1:50:30] had the victory. He went through
[1:50:32] suffering but oh I worship the Lord. I
[1:50:35] praise the Lord. I don't understand
[1:50:36] everything but I will praise him because
[1:50:39] he's worthy to be praised. He's my
[1:50:40] savior. He's my healer. Oh, he is doing
[1:50:44] everything perfect. Not all things works
[1:50:47] for good for the children of God. He's
[1:50:50] in control of every situation. As a
[1:50:52] child of God, I just willing to accept
[1:50:54] what God's will is and praise him in all
[1:50:57] situation.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians can come. Thank you. As
[1:51:04] they're coming, I'll read this quote.
[1:51:05] The prophet says
[1:51:11] there is no the special conditions mean
[1:51:14] I must be applied to every age. There's
[1:51:16] no age free from it. There is no true
[1:51:19] believer free from it. This is of God.
[1:51:21] This is the will of God. This is
[1:51:23] needful. We need the Lord to teach us
[1:51:25] the truth that we are we are to suffer
[1:51:27] and be Christlike in doing it. Love
[1:51:30] suffereth long and is kind.
[1:51:33] It says the cloudy skies and stormy
[1:51:36] storms of life are no signs of God
[1:51:38] disapproval.
[1:51:40] Neither are bright skies and still
[1:51:42] waters signs of his love and approval.
[1:51:44] You see all the two name the two
[1:51:46] sometimes you look at oh no God is not
[1:51:48] with me. Yeah God is still with you even
[1:51:49] there. Amen. Sometimes you look in here
[1:51:51] oh everything is fine. It means God is
[1:51:53] with me. No no no. So the cloud neither
[1:51:56] is brighten but his approvals of any of
[1:51:59] us is only in the beloved.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; His love is elective. which he had for
[1:52:04] us before the foundation of the world.
[1:52:06] Does he love us? Oh yes. But how shall
[1:52:08] we know? We shall know because he said
[1:52:10] so and manifested that he did love us.
[1:52:14] So for he brought us to himself and gave
[1:52:17] us of his spirit blessing us as sons.
[1:52:20] How shall I prove my love to him? by
[1:52:22] believing what he said and by conducting
[1:52:25] myself with joy
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; with joy amidst the trials that he in
[1:52:30] his wisdom allows to come to pass.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Oh God, may you help us to come that
[1:52:35] level.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not promoting suffering or that we
[1:52:39] we have miserable life. That's not what
[1:52:40] I'm promoting. But I'm saying if God
[1:52:42] allows something to happen, don't let it
[1:52:45] be a stumbling block in your walk.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Rejoice even in that situation. And if
[1:52:50] God blesses you so much, you know, don't
[1:52:53] go to the extreme says, "No, because
[1:52:55] he's blessing me all is well." No, still
[1:52:57] Lord, check me that I'm keep the right
[1:52:59] balance to walk with you with a
[1:53:02] Christlike character because God wants
[1:53:05] to develop a Christlike character
[1:53:08] in us. Amen. How many believe that this
[1:53:11] evening?
[1:53:19] Which song are you singing?
[1:53:21] Oh, love of God. Yeah.
[1:53:25] [Music]
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together and sing it.
[1:53:41] [Music]

[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; God gave his son.
[1:54:12] Oh to win
[1:54:16] his child
[1:54:21] he reconile
[1:54:25] and pardon from
[1:54:29] his
[1:54:31] [Music]
[1:54:33] oh love of God
[1:54:37] all rich and pure
[1:54:41] [Music]
[1:54:43] Oh, the love of God in our life is

[1:54:49] and he loved you no matter the
[1:54:51] circumstances.
[1:54:53] He cares for you. Amen.

[1:55:26] refuse to pray
[1:55:30] on rocks and hills
[1:55:34] and mountains.
[1:55:37] But God's love,
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; God's love so sure
[1:55:40] [Music]
[1:55:42] still endure.
[1:55:46] All measure

[1:56:14] Love of God.

[1:56:19] measure and
[1:56:24] strong
[1:56:27] it shall forever

[1:56:31] more endure
[1:56:35] the saints the angels
[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:43] could Wee

[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, love of God.

[1:58:36] It shall forever
[1:58:40] more endure
[1:58:44] the saints and
[1:58:48] [Music]
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; the love of God written on insanity
[1:58:55] institution.
[1:58:57] But that scripture is so true. That poem
[1:58:59] is so true. If we could write what God
[1:59:02] has done in our life, how could we
[1:59:04] express the marvelous grace of God in
[1:59:06] our life? The prophet says, "Don't be
[1:59:09] afraid of man or what he can do to you.
[1:59:13] I am with you." That God speaking, "I am
[1:59:15] with you and my grace is sufficient for
[1:59:18] you. When you pass through the waters,
[1:59:21] they will not overflow you."
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Not even in death are you defeated. You
[1:59:26] are more than a conqueror.
[1:59:29] It says nothing can separate us from the
[1:59:31] love of God. No, don't be afraid. Don't
[1:59:34] be scared. Nothing can separate us from
[1:59:36] the love of God. We are not to fear. His
[1:59:39] love cast out all fear. Amen. Amen.
[1:59:42] Because nothing can separate us from the
[1:59:45] very love of Christ. Not shall be
[1:59:47] tribulation, distress or persecution or
[1:59:50] famine, nakedness or peril or soul. Oh,
[1:59:52] as he said, but we are persuaded that
[1:59:55] neither death nor life, nor angels, nor
[1:59:58] principalities, no powers, no things
[2:00:00] present, nor things to come, no height,
[2:00:03] nor death, nor any other creature shall
[2:00:05] be able to separate us from the love of
[2:00:08] God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[2:00:11] Amen. All is well for the bride.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. All is well. All is well. All is
[2:00:17] well.
[2:00:21] All is well.
[2:00:24] [Music]
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[2:00:30] [Music]
[2:00:32] We have heard the message shalom
[2:00:39] and all is well.
[2:00:43] [Music]
[2:00:45] And there is a place
[2:00:49] of perfect
[2:00:51] rest beyond
[2:00:54] the
[2:00:56] veil.
[2:00:58] So rest little pride
[2:01:02] rest
[2:01:05] is well. One more time. All is well.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; All
[2:01:11] is well.
[2:01:14] [Music]
[2:01:16] All is well.
[2:01:19] [Music]
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; We have heard the message shalom
[2:01:28] and all is well.
[2:01:32] [Music]
[2:01:34] There is a place of perfect rest behind
[2:01:42] the invest
[2:01:48] little
[2:01:50] rest for all is well.
[2:01:56] Oh, to be like Jesus.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus
[2:02:08] on earth.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Let's raise our hands just tell him I
[2:02:15] desire to be like you.
[2:02:17] [Music]
[2:02:20] Oh, through us journey
[2:02:23] [Music]
[2:02:25] from earth to glory.
[2:02:30] I only ask
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; to be like him. One more time. To be
[2:02:38] like him. Oh, to be like Jesus.
[2:02:45] To be like Jesus.
[2:02:51] on earth I long.
[2:02:55] Oh to be like him.
[2:03:01] All through life's journey
[2:03:06] from earth to glory.

[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; to be like him.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Let each person cry him. Just speak to
[2:03:22] the Lord and ask him, Lord, give me that

[2:05:55] take a little a little bit of suffering.
[2:05:57] Sometimes it might take a little bit of
