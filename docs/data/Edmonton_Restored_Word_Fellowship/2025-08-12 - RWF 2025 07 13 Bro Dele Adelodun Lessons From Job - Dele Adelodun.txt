And we want to see the Lord coming just one day. But it's already started. We've been seeing it. We see where the world is. We see what's coming to fruition from from prophecy and that's that's part of what's coming. We're seeing him come right now. Even though it's not today, this second, it's started long before we were here. They'll be shouting on the hills of [Music] coming when we reach the fallen no and the angels sound the trumpet shouting on the everlasting they'll be shouting on the hill [Music] Heat. Heat.

[Music] &gt;&gt; As as much as we like to think that there's a we'll be shouting because uh we don't have a mortgage payment or we don't have to do laundry anymore. Those things are great. But we'll be shouting because we don't have to deal with this world anymore. We don't we don't have to deal with this flesh that's constantly against us. and and we'll get to see God face to face. Amen. Amen. [Music] Maybe if I can ask brother Joseph if he could come and just open in prayer. And there's a prayer request for uh brother Steven Dole. He was uh uh him and a couple other brothers from brother Eds were traveling. Uh it's road to the sun, I think, in Montana there. and he hit a patch of gravel and uh I think he almost went over a guardrail where he went over a guardrail and yeah, he's got some fractures and some things. So, he's I think he's still in the hospital as far as I know. So, but uh it's it could have easily uh been more than just a hospital. So, the Lord is already looking out for him just but we'll just pray for him and just for the service and just feel and then for those who couldn't make it, there's still a couple of ways. So, God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to be in the house of the Lord this morning. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. We had a good service last night and uh we are looking for more today. &gt;&gt; We we were told we had to identify ourselves. Now who are we? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the uh Lord in prayer this morning. Dear heavenly father, we approach your throne of mercy and grace this morning. Your mercy prevails. Your grace keeps us going. We love you, Lord, for you first loved us. &gt;&gt; We bless bless your name this morning, Lord, knowing that without you there is no us.

Uh so I don't keep you standing. I will invite you to please let's read the scripture so you can take the comfort of your seat and then we trust the Lord to take us from there. God bless the musicians. God bless the song leader. Amen. Yeah. Let's turn to the book of Job this morning. I had something else upon my heart but the Lord drove me to this. And uh since we are servants to God, we've leared to accept whatever he wants. Maybe somebody uh is pulling for that. And I hope it's a blessing to the saints this morning. Job chapter one. We are going to navigate through the book of Job. But I do not say we will cover everything in there, but we'll trust God to see how much we can do. And uh whichever much we do uh brother Moses will continue from there. Amen. Job chapter one. The first chapter we are reading is just for a background. Amen. If you are there say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a man in the land of whose name was Job. And that man, I want you to see how Job was introduced to us in the scriptures. This introduction was God's introduction because God is going to repeat it as we go along. Amen. And that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and assued evil. And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. His substance also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels and 500 yoke of oxen and 500 sheazes and a very great household. So that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. And his sons went and feasted in their uh houses, everyone is they and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. And it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that Job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." Thus did Job continually. Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. And the Lord said unto Satan, "Has thou considered my servant Job?" Now watch it again, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fearth God and ishu evil. Then Satan answered the Lord and said, "Dust Job fear God for not? Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he had on every side? Thou has blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse thee to thy face." So that is the deal. And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he has is in thy hand, only upon himself. Put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house. Thank you very much. And they have slayed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I only am escaped alone to tell thee one. While he was yet speaking, there came also another and said, "The fire of God is fallen from heaven and hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I only am escaped alone to tell thee too." While he was there speaking, there came also another and said, "The Chaldians made out three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away here and the and slain the servants with the edge of the sword. And I only am escaped alone to tell thee three." While he was yet speaking, there came also another and said, "Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house. And behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smoked the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead, and high only amcaped alone to tell thee." Four. Then Job arose and wrench his mantle. He did like all ms will do. He expressed his emotion and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Satan is defeated. &gt;&gt; What should have come is a curse. But what came was worship &gt;&gt; and said, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return tither. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Now wait for it. In all this, Job sinned n charge God foolishly. &gt;&gt; So that's a defeat for the kingdom of darkness. Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of his holy word. God bless you. You may please be seated. I want to thank the Lord again this morning for the privilege he had given unto me to be with the saints uh in this part of the world at this time. And I appreciate the very privilege of our pastors to have given me this opportunity to be of service. Uh and I pray that the Lord will bless them, bless the work of God in here and uh bless every one of you and uh we trust that somewhere along the line the effort will be a blessing. And uh I also I still bring the greetings from home because they never says to send you greetings uh anytime we speak. Being away from home, they called me all the time to check to be sure I'm fine. And uh with the kind of people like you and God on my side, I will always be fine. &gt;&gt; I've enjoyed so much care and hospitality. uh thank you for all that you have done, your gift and everything. May the Lord bless and richly reward &gt;&gt; to the glory of his holy name. Amen. So uh after this morning, we'll take a pause as I continued to Spruce Grove uh for a second service today and tomorrow I shall be leaving Alberta and somebody asked me yesterday when next are you coming? &gt;&gt; I said let me go first because I'm still around. If you ask me when next am I coming I will tell you today yesterday and I'm here this morning. So but we trust that uh the Lord will give us many more time as we look forward to his coming. Last year I told you that when we are rel if we are related we shall meet again and I said we are actually related. I may not be a Canadian but we are related by the better blood &gt;&gt; and that is the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; If it's on the basis of being Nigerian or Canadian we may never have met. There are many people in Nigeria that I've never met in my life. Yeah. It's a country of diverse ethnicities and with over 200 million people. So, it's practically impossible for me to meet everybody. I'm not even sure I've met everybody that live in the locality where I do. But you see, I haven't met the people around me, but I've met you. It's a sign that we were connected together somewhere. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We have the same origin. And there's the privilege, it's the opportunity from the Lord that people who came from the same origin have the opportunity to connect in time. &gt;&gt; So when we have good fellowship in time, it will give us a nice appetite for a land where we'll never have to part. &gt;&gt; So till we watch for that, if he gives us more time, I'm sure the Lord will make our path cross again. Till then I pray that the Lord keep you healthy, strong, serving the Lord, walking in his will as I trust you'll be doing same for me. So God bless you very much. Amen. I don't know if uh uh any of the descendants of pastor John who is around here this morning are wonderful. Yeah. Because the mama told me that the daughter will be in service and uh so I said I'll be sure I be looking forward to seeing her and to greet her very much. I actually suspected you might be. Yeah. God bless you my sister. Amen. And God bless everyone of you. It's been so nice to see you all again. Amen. So this morning as much as time will permit us. But okay, I was just good. All right. The Lord will help us. I want to speak uh on a subject that I called lessons from Job. Lessons from Job. Amen. And uh I was uh inspired for this subject both from the scripture about Job and from a thought the prophet shared with us in the message. I know. He took it as a Easter message and he said no doubt people will approach this Easter services and messages from different angle today. He said but I want to approach it from another angle and the background thought he gave really caught my attention. I would like to share that quotation as we start as a background for what I'm going to say this morning. Trusting God. Amen. It said um in the message I know 60-0417s paragraph 26 I'm cutting off some few things. He said but what I thought for my little group this morning the Lord has given me I would approach it from a different standpoint if I could coming to a place of why do we come to these troubles? What makes these things come? Why should a Christian ever be perplexed? Why wouldn't not everything just run perfect for a Christian? But it doesn't and we know it. And sometimes we have more troubles when we become a Christian than we did when we were sinners. Because it is written, "Many is the afflictions of the righteous, but God deliverth him from them all." God promised many afflictions, strange feelings, and strange things that will be beyond our understanding. But it's always done for our good. just can't understand it because if we did then it will not be a faith to us. We will go with an understanding but we do it and we have it and we believe by faith his word that it's going to work some good thing for us. If we could grasp that today or this morning, if we could grasp that all of our troubles and there is none of us immune from them and if we could realize that those things are for our good. It is written in one of the scriptures in the Bible that trials are brought upon us are more precious to us than gold itself. For it is God giving us these trials. After we become his property, our confession and our baptism and our promise to walk in life for him, then every trial comes upon us that comes upon us is to perfect us for his glory. Is to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial come. And I want to join in this morning with Job to say that I've lived long enough to know that is the truth. &gt;&gt; I have seen it in my own life that every time a great situation rises that I can't get around it or under it or over it, God makes a way and it comes out glorious. I just wonder how his grace ever does it, but it does it. Amen. And remember in all these things, Satan tries to make us nervous and upset us to get us to think, "Oh, why did this happen? Why couldn't I have been like this?" Amen. So when I read this, the Lord led my heart to look at the book of Job more and began to show my to show me some lessons in there. And I trust that these lessons will help you today. &gt;&gt; Amen. From the scripture that we read, the first introduction of Job in the Bible was that he was a perfect man, an upright man, one that feared God and shone evil. So the man we are talking about wasn't a secret sinner. The man we are talking about wasn't an unserious Christian. He was a man that met God's requirement, God's qualification until he could entredge his memory in the Bible because whatever God says here is the eternal record. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this was how much God thought of Job. And even when he had a conversation with Satan, God still repeated all these qualities that he was a perfect and upright man. He was a man who feared the Lord. He was a man who shun the evil and always do that which is right. &gt;&gt; I want you to appreciate this background very much. You will find it useful as we go on in the study. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. He was not just a Christian uh by God's definition in his own day. He was also a good Christian family man. He was a man who realized the importance of putting his family under the token. Amen. The prophet said, "Keep them under the Holy Spirit until those children are old enough to accept God and make choices by themselves." But you will realize that you cannot give what you don't have. Like we were sharing yesterday some four things that you need to do. Amen. When you do that, Brother Aram said, "Leave the rest in the hands of the Lord. God will take care of it." Job was a man who did that. The Bible said he anticipated challenges. He knew his children were young and perhaps he understood their spiritual standard. So he never took any chance by placing them under the blood all the time. He said it may be that they have done something wrong. They are young people. Maybe they have messed up. Maybe they've caused God in their heart. Job never waited even for them to come confessing. Neither did he wait for him to catch them. He anticipated any possibility. And because of that, he constantly stood in intercession for his family. A man who could do that will be living a life that is worthy. It shows that his life is a perfect example onto his family. He was living through as a son of God. Are you getting something from Job? Amen. So the family of Job was always under the blood &gt;&gt; because he applied the token &gt;&gt; all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And to apply the token is to come under the obedience of the word. In the Old Testament when Israel was to leave uh the land of Egypt, God gave them the sign of the token. Amen. He told them to kill their lamp and uh goat if a family cannot afford one. He told families to come together and combine and killed one together. But you see, I tell you, if they kill that lamb and collect his blood and put it in a bucket for storage, they have not come under the obedience. Killing the lamp is not enough. You must obey what God said do with the lamp. &gt;&gt; If you obey what God said do with the lamb's blood, that is when you are applying. So obedience is applying. That is why in the message token the prophet said don't come this far and say I believe all the message. He said that is just being able to read and write. He said if you truly believe obey. &gt;&gt; Obedience bring application. So when they collected the blood they were told to put it under the uh upon the doorpost and the lintil and not only that to stay behind it. That is complete application. If they put it under the doorpost and the lintil uh and the lintil and they never stayed behind it, they will still die just the same. If they collected it without applying it on those, you know, on the doorpost and the lintel, they will die just the same. So to it is not enough to kill your lamb. You must apply the blood where God said put it and you must stay behind it. That is complete obedience and that is the meaning of applying the token. God has given us the token in these last days because the token is no more the blood chemistry. &gt;&gt; The token is the life that came out of it. &gt;&gt; And this spirit of God in these last days has given us the word of God. When you obey what the word says, that is when you are applying the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. time will fail me to show you how the word for the hour is the blood for the hour. &gt;&gt; Aha. If you are looking for the blood of Jesus Christ, the message of the hour is the blood of Jesus Christ. That is why in the message rapture, brother Abraham said there's going to be one great amiz day where the war where the march will not be to anywhere else to a remembrance arade but to glory. And he said, "As the saints are marching up to glory, they will be depleting upon their chest the blood of Jesus Christ, which is the message of the hour in the age in which they live in." Because when the lamb took the book, he qualified to take the book that was sealed with seven seals in Revelations chapter 5 by a payment. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was the payment? He paid his blood &gt;&gt; in order to get the book. Is that right? And the book when it is revealed is the message of your day. &gt;&gt; So if you ask the Lord what was the payment you made to get this book, he will say I gave my blood. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So if you ask him for his blood, he will show you what the blood purchased. The blood purchased the book. And when he began to open the book, you became the content of the book. That was when you had your name supernaturally &gt;&gt; and you came out. So if you want to apply the token today, do what the word says because that is the token for the hour and that is the only way to be righteous by coming under the blood for your day. So Job met the total requirement &gt;&gt; of what it takes to be a Christian. The total requirement for blood protection. That was why even when Satan came, it said h I couldn't do anything to him because you had an edge around him. God did not build a fence around him. The fence Job lived in was the word of God for that hour. Satan might be able to pierce through everything and anything, but he cannot pierce through the word. &gt;&gt; So you stay in the word, stay under the blood by living in obedience to what the word says, and you are going to stay safe. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Job met the requirements of God and he never only uh did it for himself. He placed his family under it. That is like that is just the nature of every seed of Abraham of or of everybody who has a link to Abraham relative to faith because Job lived in the era of Abraham and the rest of them. So if you have a link to Abraham, you have the same manner of Abraham. What was one thing that endeared Abraham to God to receive revelation? If you are not understanding the word nor having the revelation of the word, you need to change your attitude also. One of the greatest quality Abraham had for God to always reveal things to him is his ability to pass it on. When God came down in Genesis chapter 18, he said, "Shall I hide anything?" He finished with him. He was going to Sodom for inspection before the fire fell. Then he asked, "Shall I hide anything from Abra from Abraham." Amen. And for two reasons, he told Abraham everything. He told Abraham his own fate and he also told him the fate of Sodom. He said, "One, because Abraham will be the possessor of these things." Then number two, he said, "I know it that whatever I teach him, he will teach his children." &gt;&gt; So if you remain a resoa, a collecting point for the knowledge of the word, uh God will not reveal things to you. He wants you to be a channel of blessing. He wants this to come to you and to flow from you to your generation because God anticipation for eternity is that you and your offsprings should be there. That was what Isaiah said. And if you watch in the first Exodus wherein God was taking a nation out of a nation, God anticipated also the young people, the children. And whatever memorial, whatever things is trying to tell them to keep as a memorial, they kept it as a memorial mainly because of their generation. He said it will come to a time that your children will ask what minute this. How many ever read that in their Bible? And he said, tell them it is when the Lord thy God did this and that. &gt;&gt; So God has your children in mind and you must have them also in mind. That's one quality we learned from Job in the scripture. I'm giving you I'm giving you uh the good quality, the good background of Job because Job is a story of why do bad things happen to good people. And that is what we want to see this morning. So Job wasn't a sinner. He was a Christian. He was a son of God by every standard in his own day. Then the Bible said one day they came to present themselves before God. Now don't make that look too mysterious. What they came to do was they came for service. &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. &gt;&gt; What are we doing here this morning? We came to present ourselves &gt;&gt; before God. So don't be imagining what will that be sons of God came to the essence of God. It simply means they came for service &gt;&gt; and you know in God's population counting most of the time it doesn't count women and children. So the use of the word sons here does not necessarily mean that it was only men or brothers that were in church. Are you getting it? They might have come with their wives. Sisters were there with their children &gt;&gt; just as we had this morning. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the Lord did the miracle of the five loaves and two fishes to feed 5,000 and to feed 4,000. You read the account. He said 5,000 men besides women and children. &gt;&gt; Are you catching it? Because in God's counting, he reckons more with the male. So there might have been 12 or 15,000 people fed that day when you had the women and the children. &gt;&gt; Are you catching it? So the fact that it said when the sons of God came here did not necessarily mean it was only men who were present. &gt;&gt; So we all came to present ourselves &gt;&gt; before the Lord. It was a service day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Aha. &gt;&gt; So on this particular service day, Satan was in service. Are you enjoying my story? &gt;&gt; Let me make something clear to you this morning. Satan comes to service and there's nothing you can do about it. When the prophet was talking about it, he said, "Don't frown at that." &gt;&gt; That I said Satan comes to service. He said, "Show me any church, any service that Satan does not attend." Is a quote. And when brother A bra speaks like that because he has his authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the sons of God came to present themselves, where did God met Satan? He met him in that service. &gt;&gt; So it's both scriptural and messagical. Ah, so Satan is in our service this morning. Yes. Okay. Let me ask you a simple question. If you are dozing and sleeping in service, who is responsible? &gt;&gt; Answer me now. &gt;&gt; God will be God will be speaking to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And be giving you sleep to rob you of the blessings. &gt;&gt; Is the devil doing that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aha. Let's jolt oursel to reality. So Satan is here this morning. Hear it loud and clear. Amen. Because in the Bible when the sons of God came to present themselves, the devil was in service. &gt;&gt; Some of us when we were here in our body and our mind is in Ontario. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our spirit is in Vancouver and the whole service run by the time the service is over you couldn't even recollect one thing that went on. You think God is responsible for that? I disagree with you. The devil is responsible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Satan attends service. &gt;&gt; So, but you see what we can do is to render him useless. &gt;&gt; Is welcome to attend, but he will go back without achieving nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The millennium will be peaceful not because Satan has be an elated. Listen to me, church. But the prophet said the millennium is going to be peaceful because Satan will be bound &gt;&gt; by the chain by a chain. Is that right? And it will just it will take an unrecognized angel. Not even the big big angels whose names you know. He said an angel came with a chain to bound him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you following? Amen. &gt;&gt; It might be a just a small angel. That is how little the devil is. &gt;&gt; If you can get his secret. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Satan Millennium being peaceful isn't because Satan isn't existing, but it is because he was put in a condition because brother Bram said the chain of circum the chain we are talking about is not a physical chain. &gt;&gt; It's a chain of circumstance. a condition that makes it impossible for him to operate. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, brethren? &gt;&gt; He said, "And what is the condition?" He said, "All his subjects are in hell. The church on earth is the redeemed. And because he had nothing to walk on, &gt;&gt; oh, &gt;&gt; will the church get that as a revelation? As long as the devil has nobody to walk on, &gt;&gt; he will be here as an ordinary observer. &gt;&gt; As long as we refuse to be a tool for him to use. &gt;&gt; Are you catching it? That is a revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; So don't make yourself a tool. &gt;&gt; Amen. As long as he comes in and he couldn't find somebody to use, he will remain useless himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we stay here 10 hours, is it 10 hours of a waste of time &gt;&gt; for the devil? &gt;&gt; Because we all become vessels of God, &gt;&gt; vessels of honor. &gt;&gt; That is why the Bible said, the prophet said, always purge yourself. If you have any wrong feeling, wrong thought coming up in your mind, he said deal with it. Whether against somebody or against one another, purify yourself by doing the right thing. If you are not handling it properly, walk over to that person. This is the way I'm thinking about you. I don't know why is the devil trying to play a game. Pray for one another. &gt;&gt; When you have exposed the devil and you pray, Satan is bound to leave. &gt;&gt; Let's render him useless this morning by refusing to be a tool of the devil. Then we're going to have a millennium right in our church. We're going to have a millennium right in our homes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So we welcome him. Satan, come if you want to come, &gt;&gt; but you ain't going to use nobody here &gt;&gt; because we all are vessels of honor. &gt;&gt; We are vessels of the almighty God. &gt;&gt; We are whom God say we are. And we treasure that. We confess that even if you have not come to such height, keep confessing it. I'm a child of God. I'm a vessel of honor. And your body will obey &gt;&gt; your confession. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; So while he was in there in service, the Lord cited him and said, "Satan, where are you coming from? &gt;&gt; Where did you operate today?" I was operating everywhere. Amen. And I thought to extend my operation to church. God say you are welcome. If you want to operate here, let's let's have a conversation. Have you considered my servant Job? &gt;&gt; Now this was going on in the supernatural realm, spirit realm. Job had no idea of the conversation between God and Satan &gt;&gt; and it was all about him. &gt;&gt; Are you following me &gt;&gt; right now? This morning you we don't know whom the devil and God is having a conversation over. &gt;&gt; If I ask you would you like God to spot you out? All hands will be kept. But you see these things are beyond you folks. It is God that determines that. But I give you one assurance this day that if God spotted you out or spot you out this morning for devil's assessment, &gt;&gt; know that God has put something in you &gt;&gt; that he can trust. God doesn't play games. &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't even know yourself as much as God does. &gt;&gt; Did you catch that? &gt;&gt; You see your condition. You see your weakness. The one who created you knows the deposit he has put in there. &gt;&gt; Because God does not see as men see it. That is why when challenges come your way, you say, "I don't know if I can ever handle this." But you are still standing. &gt;&gt; You have handled several. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, the more that God will permit, you are going to handle it. &gt;&gt; Because you don't know yourself as much as God does. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Accept God's assessment of you. &gt;&gt; Accept his confession of you, not of yourself. One day God came down in the Bible to a man who seemingly outwardly and by what God met him with was a coward. &gt;&gt; Yes, I'll prove it to you. &gt;&gt; When he came down to meet Gideon, &gt;&gt; in what state did it meet Gideon? &gt;&gt; He met him in the state of cowardice. A man who harvested his farm and couldn't process it in the normal place of the treasure floor but was processing it in the wine press. The Bible said to hide it from the medianites. &gt;&gt; So he was doing a camouflage. He was doing a decoy because he didn't want the medianites to steal his labor. Amen. If he had any sound, he quickly run and dodge until maybe when God came down, he thought it was another medianite &gt;&gt; and he was running. But when the Lord will address him, how did he address him? &gt;&gt; You caught that now? Aha. Let that be your lift. &gt;&gt; God came down and said, Gideon, thou mighty man of valor, the Lord is with thee. You are dressing a coward as a mighty man of valor. So who shall I believe? Even Gideon himself did not thrust the assessment. Read your Bible. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It's a sign that God doesn't see as men do. &gt;&gt; God knows what he has deposited in you. When you are seeing yourself as a failure, God is calling you a success, a victor, a victorious victor. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Because God does not confess your condition. He only confesses your position in him. &gt;&gt; And whether you like it or not, no condition is permanent. Your condition must give way to your position. Amen. &gt;&gt; So always accept God's verdict of you. &gt;&gt; He came to a coward. He call him mighty man of valor. Brethren, how did the story end? It ended as a mighty man of valor. Because Gideon with only 300 people defeated an entire nation that he was running away from. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, nobody stay under this s and is not parking power. Amen. &gt;&gt; Day by day you are becoming more glorious, your life is getting better. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet said when you become born again and you stay under the revealed word. He said he places your body under subjection. And this rebellious body will start getting used &gt;&gt; to the control of the new chief. And that is why he said when God says anything when you hear it you you start adjusting. &gt;&gt; You start adjusting. And you yourself can be testifying that things are getting different. Brother Arab said retain that testimony and let's keep going on because there is power in this word to change you from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; He said that change you experiencing is the very evidence that one of these days you are going to have a body change &gt;&gt; and you are going to have a rapture because it has already started. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If I say if this place were a wall or a fence and there's no roof and I said sister jump even the pastor said you can see what that means. Why would you ever tell us to do such a thing? I've not even asked the brothers. I'm only saying sister. Okay brother jump. &gt;&gt; You will think and it's an embarrassing demand because seemingly nobody can do it. Is that right? Except you have learned I jump and so forth and you are a sprinter. Amen. But what if I say you can do it? You say I'm not sure. And I keep saying you can do it. Then you say I don't know if I can really do it. And I keep saying you can do it. You said maybe if God permits. What am I doing? I'm changing you from face to face. And I said, do you know the reason why you feel you cannot do it? Is because nothing has provoked that ability in you. &gt;&gt; So you don't even know the abilities you have &gt;&gt; until there's a provocation for it. &gt;&gt; If as we are sitting here now, as we are sitting here now, 50 lions just suddenly come. &gt;&gt; Do you know you will find yourself on the other side of the wall? Do you realize that? And you will be wondering how you got there. &gt;&gt; You got there because it was already in you. &gt;&gt; It's just because nothing has provoked it &gt;&gt; for you to enjoy it. That is the power that you are piling by the revealed word. Every time you come to God's presence, &gt;&gt; as the world is getting more evil, this bride is getting more glorious. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the conversation began. Have you considered my servant Job? It was the Lord who put up Job for trial. &gt;&gt; Get it friends? &gt;&gt; So it is safe to say that the problem of Job started from the church. Am I sounding crude? I'm just jolting you to fact. Amen. The problem of Job started from the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't by the church, but it started from church ground because after the service was over, Job began to experience &gt;&gt; the deal between God and Satan. &gt;&gt; And uh God repeated his introduction. This man feared me. This man assue evil. He shone evil. He does the right. Is a perfect and an upright man. God was so happy &gt;&gt; to deliciously declare that about his own servants. &gt;&gt; May the Lord depend on you and I. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you don't expect the devil to commend you. Did you hear me? &gt;&gt; You don't expect commendation from the devil because the kingdom of the devil doesn't run like that. Let me show you an operating system of the kingdom of darkness. When the Lord said that, look at the response of Satan. He said, "Does Job fear thee for nothing?" &gt;&gt; Because in the kingdom of the devil, nobody is nice. &gt;&gt; Did you hear me? &gt;&gt; If there is any neness is because there's an ulterior benefit. If it doesn't come with an ulterior advantage in the kingdom of the devil, nobody's dies. Brother said the devil is used to meanness. &gt;&gt; So if is that's the way he is wired. So if he sees anything good, there must be a pecuniary gain. &gt;&gt; That is why he said if Job is doing all that, he must be getting something out of it. I told you about the sister that brought the alabaster hall yesterday. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And I told you the attitude of Judas &gt;&gt; that will suggest that maybe he's being nice to the poor. &gt;&gt; But the Bible said he's not being nice. &gt;&gt; When he was acting that neness is because he's looking at an ulterior advantage. That is the way the kingdom of darkness runs. But friends, even though there are benefits in serving the Lord, let me say it this morning. We don't serve God because of benefits. &gt;&gt; We are not serving God because we want to dodge hell. &gt;&gt; Ah, &gt;&gt; if you are serving God because of that, your service to God, your worship is transactional. &gt;&gt; Give and take. Listen to me. We serve him because we love him. &gt;&gt; If your service to God, if your worship to God is not inspired by love, you are not yet a true diligent worshipper. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry to say if you don't mind, you are offering the sacrifice and worship of fools. Brother Abraham said what we lost in the garden was love. What redemption did is to bring us back that love &gt;&gt; and love must be the basis for our service. &gt;&gt; It must be the basis of fellowship. That is why brother Abraham said, "If the Lord will tell me after all your service to me, when you pass, I will send you to hell." What did the prophet said? He said, "I will keep serving him." &gt;&gt; And he meant it. &gt;&gt; I want that to be a revelation to the church. &gt;&gt; Because this is the same revelation every true worshipper ever had. And that is why they can serve God in every season &gt;&gt; whether times are bad or times are evil are good in season and out of season. Paul said what shall separate us from the love of God. Some of us what we have or what we don't have is the remote control for our mood for service. You can easily tell somebody has got all his footto full sometimes by the way he worships the Lord and you can even easily tell that everything is wrong. Sometimes by their attitude they have spiritual mood swings. Today they are happy to worship the Lord. Tomorrow they are moody to worship the Lord. The next day they don't even want to worship the Lord. They come to the house of the Lord as a duty so that nobody will check that they didn't come. And there are many others who have excuses &gt;&gt; who rather build excuses for not coming to the house of the Lord. You are not in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I sounding flat? &gt;&gt; I'm sorry if I'm sounding flat. Permit my African gabs. &gt;&gt; But get the message. &gt;&gt; You are not in love. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those who love the Lord serve God in season out of season. &gt;&gt; In the message ever present water from the living rock, &gt;&gt; the prophet said if a young lady is moving with a man but is moving by the compulsion of parent, he said she doesn't look forward to seeing the guy when it comes around they will have to beg and pet for her to come out. He said but if she was in love she's even counting seconds. He ought to have arrived here now. &gt;&gt; That is the difference. &gt;&gt; And if your love will drive a person that hard, how much more if the love of God takes a hold in a human heart? &gt;&gt; Paul said, "What shall separate us &gt;&gt; from the love of God?" He mentioned every condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is adverse to humanity. And he said, "No, in all these things we are more than what? Conquerors through him that loved us." &gt;&gt; You are planning to go to the same heaven they went. &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham said if he says yeah he will send me to hell after my service to him. He said I will keep serving &gt;&gt; until I get to that hell. And when I get to hell, if there is still an opportunity to love and serve, I will continue in hell. &gt;&gt; So he isn't serving him because of anything he could get. &gt;&gt; Whether he gets or not, &gt;&gt; do you know why true worshippers have some capstone revelation? Let me show you this morning with the three Hebrew children. How many remember the three brothers? &gt;&gt; Amen. Company with people with positive energy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those who will help your faith &gt;&gt; and spiritual commitment. I told you last night that if you are moving with people who make you vile &gt;&gt; or disinterested in the things of God, &gt;&gt; he said change your company &gt;&gt; because you don't need them in your life. &gt;&gt; They will destroy you. &gt;&gt; Move with those who will help your faith, &gt;&gt; whose life will provoke you &gt;&gt; to good works. Amen. &gt;&gt; These three Hebrew brothers were not the only young people in Israel. How come they were the only people God singled out for a for an eternal memorial? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; These brethren had contradictions both from within and without. Outside people saw them as rebels. &gt;&gt; Inside the church, they saw them as fanatics. &gt;&gt; Oh, that is the truth. Yours are too much. The spoken word is not that hard. I mean he he he the spoken word gives you the leverage to also reason and think. It is this reasoning and thinking that will make people submit to the antichrist system. Yeah, that's what the prophet said that it is better to serve God under the antichrist system than not to serve God at all. Who tell you we cannot serve God without submitting to the antichrist? The three Hebrew children served God without submitting to the Antichrist. Or you don't know that that is an antichrist. You don't know that that is their own squeeze. What is the demand of the antichrist? Worship. &gt;&gt; Why was Nebuchadnezzar angry against the three Hebrew children? Worship. Why was Darius angry? The friends of Dar, the princes of Darius. Why were they angry against Daniel? Worship. What made Hammon to be angry with Modi? worship. I can trace it throughout the scripture for you that the only contention Satan had with God is on worship. &gt;&gt; And the Bible in Revelation 13:8 said he will succeed in getting worship. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; He said all the people of the earth will worship him. &gt;&gt; But it is because of the exception &gt;&gt; except those whose names are in the lamb's book of life. And let me tell you, those are the people whose worship Satan is interested in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you catching it? Is gotten worship everywhere. But he want it from the stars of God, which is you and I. Because you have the most premium worship, &gt;&gt; the highest quality of worship. Until he get it from you, he will not be satisfied. But let me tell you, Satan will die unsatisfied man. Because according to the scripture, we will not give it to him. All the people of the earth will worship him except those whose names are in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; By prophecy, we are not designed to to submit to the devil. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; So don't worship him with your tongue. &gt;&gt; Don't worship him with your convention. &gt;&gt; Don't worship him with your attitude. Anytime you do the devil's desire, that's worship unto him &gt;&gt; in any situation, whether good or bad, respond correctly &gt;&gt; with the right words, with the right attitude. That's the worship to God. &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Are you happy? &gt;&gt; Can I see go on a little? &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you'll give him more work. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You don't want too much assignment. They love their pastors. They don't want too much assignment. Praise God. Hallelujah. All right. So the three Hebrew children are because the king loved them. They are his governors. Said, "What am I hearing about you?" And they said, "Oh, king lively forever. What you heard about us is the truth." He said, "Okay, I'm going to give you another chance." Maybe it was because I wasn't there. So, don't bother, King. If you give us 10 opportunities, the answer is going to still be the same. So, we had better not waste each other's time. Now, listen to this. He said, "We know our God can deliver us." Amen. &gt;&gt; Two revelations you must have. You must know God's divine ability &gt;&gt; can means God is able &gt;&gt; to deliver us. &gt;&gt; But they have a greater revelation to know that it is not everything God can do that he chooses to do. If he does not do what he can do by choice without explaining it, he's still God. &gt;&gt; It won't reduce him. So they add the revelation of God's sovereign ability, not just his ability, &gt;&gt; his sovereignty that it is not every time he does what he can do. That was why they told that man, we know that our God can deliver us, &gt;&gt; but hear it also. If he chooses not to deliver us, &gt;&gt; are you catching it? &gt;&gt; Yet we will not bow down. &gt;&gt; In other word, either way, &gt;&gt; we are for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is love. &gt;&gt; That is the love of God. You are going to the same heaven they've gone &gt;&gt; and you aren't going to go wishywashy manner. If they did that by the inspiration of the spirit today you have baptism of the spirit. You should do far greater. &gt;&gt; Rise above your excuses and serve the lord wholeheartedly. &gt;&gt; He said in our environment it's so difficult you know to serve the lord like that. Poor you. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour came from your environment. It didn't come from African environment. &gt;&gt; It came from your environment. &gt;&gt; When you have the Holy Ghost, it is the master of all circumstance. &gt;&gt; Perfect faith is the master of every environment. &gt;&gt; Believers defy all environment &gt;&gt; to serve God. &gt;&gt; Because even the Bible said where sin abounds, grace much more abound. Where pressure abounds, grace much more abound. When the enemy comes like a flood, the spirit of the Lord will always raise a standard. &gt;&gt; Save him anywhere and everywhere. &gt;&gt; Pamos was said to be the seat of Satan, the throne room of the devil. Brother Arab said it's a paradox that saints lived in that PGamos in the throne room of the devil and they are still defeating Satan &gt;&gt; in his own capital. That is the power that is in the believer. He that is in us is greater than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; Brother Aram said a life filled with excuses is not worthy of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Don't let your worship with God be transactional. &gt;&gt; Let it be based on love. &gt;&gt; This is the way the kingdom of darkness operate. And I want to call your attention to it that this is the foundation for the challenge between God and Satan because God said, "I will show you that Job wasn't serving me because of all that he has." And God challenged him. He said, "You go take everything and let's see if it's going to change anything." The Bible told us that Job that Satan said, "Let me touch everything he has and I will make him do what? Cause you to your face." Money can be a snare both ways. Wealth can be a snare both ways. Meaning, if you have it, it can be a snare. If you don't have, it can be a snare. But guess what? If you have received Christ and you have gotten the pill of great price, the effect of money on any side will never affect you. Money is not the source of your joy. You have joy by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; There are things God will give you in life to enrich your joy or to enhance it, but they are not the basis of your joy. That is why whether you have or you don't have, it doesn't change your loyalty or your commitment to God. If it is affected, you are still believing to being a Christian. You are not one yet. Lessons from Job. &gt;&gt; And Satan find it impossible, you know, to go around Job. He said, "You made an edge around him." God said it that's not a big deal. I will relax the edge. You go take everything he has and let's see what's going to happen. There's an edge around you, brother. There's an hedge around you, sister. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is why no matter what happened to you, stay where the fire is falling. &gt;&gt; Stay under the blood. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "You can't be as good as a Christian ought to be if you don't come to church. &gt;&gt; Come to church &gt;&gt; under every circumstance. &gt;&gt; Come hear the word. &gt;&gt; Come pray. Do that in your home. Do that for your family. Family altar in the morning. Can we say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Family altar at night. Brother said when mama has finished washing all the dishes. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Because angels visit our home and he doesn't want some dirty thing. He doesn't want to be smelling onions when they come into our house. That is why the reveal word said after mama has done wash the dishes or the kids or whoever let everything be clean. He said let the last thing be family altar. Put your house constantly under the blood. What would do we do at the family altar? We read some portion of the scriptures. Amen. And the father of the house if he has things to say he can comment on those things like Jesse did. Brother Abraham said what Jesse was doing in his family was what woke up the faith the blessings the the courage in David. These are quotations of the word. &gt;&gt; There is an antidote of the word for every aspect of our life because the message of the hour is a remedy for life. &gt;&gt; Is the totality of God's counsel to give you a cure over loudian condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said in the evening gather again and read a little more portion and pray. Read the word in the morning and pray. Read the word at night and pray. You might think it's not working. It's working. Is retaining the right environment in that your house. &gt;&gt; Sons of God, rise up to your responsibility. Put your family under the blood. Live a life worthy before them. When your wife sees something real, Amen. she will follow &gt;&gt; and it will bless the children &gt;&gt; down the line. &gt;&gt; So God said, "Go take everything &gt;&gt; and let's see what happen. You we come back at the next service and talk about what will happen." And the Bible said, "Yes, ma'am." The Bible said, Satan, the service closed. Joe, God bless you, brothers. God bless you, brothers. I'll see you next service. God bless you, my sister. Happy. Oh, let's just keep serving the Lord. And everybody went home. And Satan also went out before the next service day. The Job suffered four calamities just in one day. It might have been few hours because the Bible said as this servant was given reports the only one who escaped before he finishes the other one has arrived. When you study those challenges the mobility was taken off the wealth disappeared. Family was affected. His sources of income everything went in one day. How many of us have suffered that or to that extent? No, I need answers. Oh, those who are answering are very honest. Those who are not answering are &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In just few hours in one day everything disappeared. Now what is happening here? The same thing, the same experience that Job is having is being viewed in two different dimensions differently in the kingdom of the devil. Said Job is being tempted. Temptation comes with a motive to break you &gt;&gt; and make you doubt your sunship. to displace you, to prove you as a fake. &gt;&gt; But testing in the kingdom of God, the same thing is being viewed as test. Because God does not tempt, &gt;&gt; but God tests. &gt;&gt; What does testing show? Testing is to vindicate you &gt;&gt; as a son of God. &gt;&gt; God will never put you in a situation to doubt your sunship. It is the devil who does that. If thou be the son of God, &gt;&gt; you will never hear God say that if you be my son. No sir, he knows you are his son. &gt;&gt; Even when you are failing, he it he wouldn't change his mind. &gt;&gt; Did you hear me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because every story of redemption started with your true identity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When Jesus was given the parable of redemption using the two sons of a father, he said a father had two sons. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; When they were two sons, they were not prodigal. &gt;&gt; There was no prodigal. But when one of them began to yield to the force of natural birth, he became a prodigal son. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was still a son. He only had prodigal identity, &gt;&gt; but he didn't change the fact that he was a son. &gt;&gt; God does not disown his children. &gt;&gt; When he became a prodigal son, his prodigal life made him sto so low until he ran him into a shame. So low till he was feeding with pigs. He was still a son. &gt;&gt; God does not confess your condition. &gt;&gt; He only sees you by your position. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Then one day when he realized who he was, excuse me, what am I doing here? If it get worse than this, I'm a son. Then he said, my father has got so much wealth. The workers of my father are having a better deal than I am having here. &gt;&gt; Then it become a son coming to realization. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Still a son. &gt;&gt; Then when he got up he said I will go to my father &gt;&gt; he became a repented son. &gt;&gt; When he came home and the father embraced him he became a restored son. When it was offered the ring and clothed, it became an adopted son. &gt;&gt; Nothing ever changed his sunship identity. &gt;&gt; He was a son all the way. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "You are always a son." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was why I told you yesterday that it isn't the Holy Ghost that made you a son. is election &gt;&gt; is the thought of God &gt;&gt; that is eternal. But the Holy Spirit bring you to the realization &gt;&gt; of who you are. &gt;&gt; He strike the seed. &gt;&gt; Then you realize you need to live higher &gt;&gt; because you are a son. &gt;&gt; You thought you were a cow. That was why you were eating grass. &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. But when the realization came, Amen. And you became restored. No cow can make grass appetizing to you again. &gt;&gt; That is a new birth. &gt;&gt; That is what a new birth does. It brought you to a realization that grass is no longer your food. &gt;&gt; Your food is um what do you like, mama? &gt;&gt; Chicken. &gt;&gt; Chicken. You see? Hallelujah. Your food is chicken combined with the carbs and everything. Amen. If I offered you grass now, would you take it? You would rather think that I'm out of my mind. You don't know I'm a human being. Am I a cow? H why are you offering me grass? And I said, this grass is very sweet. It's got some, you know, or what do you call those things? The role that a if I offer you a will you eat? It's very sweet. It's it has a lot of nutritional value. You'll just be looking at me as a mad man. where somebody doesn't know what but if I offer you some nice sandwich maybe some chicken burger and make it a full meal you will appreciate me &gt;&gt; do you know why because you realize who you are &gt;&gt; that is what the Holy Ghost does it brush you to it brings you to the realization of who you are then you know that some life is too low &gt;&gt; for you to condescend because your appetite has changed Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, Satan did all this for Amen. And as mortals, it shook the brother. He tore his claws. He laid bear. Hallelujah. But in that, the angels ministered to him. And Job rose off. I said, "God bless you, brethren. Thank you for offering comfort." He said, "Sorrow, but sorrow not as those who do not have hope." &gt;&gt; His comfort rose. He said, "The Lord giveth, the Lord take it. Blessed be his holy name." &gt;&gt; When is the next service? Wednesday night, we shall be in service. &gt;&gt; We shall go worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, the next service, Job was there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what your Bible says. I'm amplifying it for you. Job was there &gt;&gt; because the Bible says Satan came again &gt;&gt; to check for report. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he came to the service again, he met Job. And God said, "Satan, Job is in service. &gt;&gt; Satan, &gt;&gt; Job didn't c me." &gt;&gt; Look at him. He's worshiping. is rejoicing &gt;&gt; shouting hallelujah &gt;&gt; rejoicing in God's presence Christian can sing in tribulation &gt;&gt; because he that is in us &gt;&gt; is greater than our challenges &gt;&gt; the holy spirit may go from body to body but his character will remain the same &gt;&gt; job identify with Paul's statement what shall separate us &gt;&gt; he said for we are persuaded &gt;&gt; that neither things present no future is able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; I tell you next service Job was in service &gt;&gt; taking his position. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Because the devil came again &gt;&gt; as at other times and he met Job in service. This guy is a frustration. Be a frustration to the kingdom of darkness. &gt;&gt; And the Lord was gracious. slighting job of Satan said Job is in service. He didn't he didn't chide me foolishly. He didn't sin. &gt;&gt; Instead of that, he responded with worship. &gt;&gt; Look, when we confront our challenges &gt;&gt; with a positive attitude, you you confuse the kingdom of darkness. &gt;&gt; You know why? It's no longer you living. &gt;&gt; Christ has taken over. And he that is in you, my brother, is greater than he that is in the world, I can do all things. &gt;&gt; Through Christ, &gt;&gt; that strengthenth me. They say talk is cheap. This is not a cheap talk. &gt;&gt; This is a reality of God that we can do all things through Christ that strengthenth us. &gt;&gt; Job was in service. So what do you have to say? And let me show you something. Let's go to chapter two quickly. Verse three, instead of Job chiding God foolishly, the Bible told me Job added to his credentials by the trial. &gt;&gt; Let's see. &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Are you enjoying the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay, let's read from verse one, from verse one to three so that you can see that it was another service. Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came alo among them to present himself before the Lord. He also came for service. Is that settled in your heart? &gt;&gt; That it was another service again after the trial of Job. &gt;&gt; I'm making my case by the scriptures. &gt;&gt; All right. Watch. And the Lord said unto Satan, from whence comest thou? That's familiar, isn't it? And Satan answered the Lord and said, "From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it." That is familiar, right? Now, let's go again. And the Lord said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant Job?" &gt;&gt; Job is in service against Satan. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now watch, watch, watch. &gt;&gt; That there is none like him in the earth. Is that familiar? &gt;&gt; That's familiar. God has said it before, right? Okay. A perfect and an upright man. Is that familiar too? &gt;&gt; God has said it before. One that feared God and assure evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that familiar too? &gt;&gt; God has said it before. Let's look at the next one now. And still he holdeth fast integrity. Is that familiar? &gt;&gt; Has God said that one before? &gt;&gt; He hasn't said it before. So the trial of Job added another quality, &gt;&gt; another recommendation, another attribute. &gt;&gt; It is a man who hold fast his integrity. He had four qualifications before he added another one. It became five by his trial. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; All right. Did you see something there? The trial strengthened him. The trial progressed him. The trial added more quality. God saw that Job love him more by his own trial. So what God sets to prove against the devil has been proven. That Job wasn't serving me because of all he had. You have taken everything he had and yet is back in service &gt;&gt; still worshiping me. Nothing will separate him from my love. Job wasn't a transactional believer. He was a believer that loves me and he worshipes me. He serves me because he loves me. &gt;&gt; Let's see what the Lord said. Still he holdeth fast his integrity although thou moved me against him to destroy him without what? &gt;&gt; So there was no reason for this trouble. There was no reason. It wasn't because Job sinned. It wasn't because he did anything wrong. &gt;&gt; Look, let me tell you, there are reasons why the scripture was given account like this. Because each line we pour into the other. Let's see why this is necessary. And Satan lived true to his nature. Instead of appreciating that said, in fact, I must give it to Job. God sir, I must give it to Job. I couldn't imagine me taking dealing with him in those four-way manner and yet he will still be in service worshiping you holding to his integrity meaning that his reputation of worship never diminished the way Job worshiped God the way he's so exuberant in his presence the way he served the Lord nothing tampered with it that is his integrity integrity speaks of reputation reputation speaks of what you are known by consistently in quality pity. &gt;&gt; Are you getting the scripture? &gt;&gt; So he never got into pity party. He wouldn't even allow you to as much as pity him in the church. He wouldn't allow that. Job wouldn't allow it. Before he want to say be comforted by he said shal love my brother. All is well. &gt;&gt; Oh my what a character that was. Don't let the devil take advantage of you. Because if there was one man who had a reason to have an issue with God, listen to me, church, it was Job. &gt;&gt; He searched his life. There wasn't anything wrong. Even God testified in confession that Satan, you made me to move against him without any reason. If there is anybody who should be singing why me Lord, it should be Jo. &gt;&gt; Mhm. But did you ever hear him like that? No sir. Job never joined pity party. Job had a capsule revelation. God is not a clown. He's not the comedian. He's not cynical. If he brought anything my way, he has a purpose. I may not understand it. I may not know why, but I have this capstone revelation that God cannot be wrong. &gt;&gt; Let that be your capstone revelation. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you are not immune. We read a quotation from any challenge in life. And there are so many things. Brother Arab said, he would not give you a reason. You wouldn't understand why. And yet he said if he explained and yet he wouldn't explain it. He said because if he explain why anything and everything happens in your life your walk with him will never be connected by faith. &gt;&gt; Are you with me church? &gt;&gt; Learn these lessons of life. &gt;&gt; God wants you to have a capstone revelation &gt;&gt; that whatever it does good or bad as an experience to you he is not wrong. Until you have that as a revelation, you can never have a perfect walk with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you this morning, church, God will put you in a condition that to defend him will be impossible, will be difficult. Did you hear me? Okay, digest it. Chew it on it a little. I'm saying God will put you in a situation that defending him will be practically impossible for you because the facts and the evidences of the situation will be too real by the human eye against God. Okay, to help you understanding, let me put it like this. How would you think Mary and Ma would have defended our Lord? It was this family of Lazarus that housed Jesus, gave him a commandation. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; They gave him cloth. They were feeding him. That's all you do for a shepherd. That's what you do for the men of God. &gt;&gt; So, they did everything. They met every Christian responsibility. They believed that message and they were supporting it wholeheartedly. That was why and Lazarus became sick but they couldn't get Jesus to come. Even though they wrote him a letter that was intimate to make him to appeal to his emotion to come. You know how the letter read Lazarus thy friend whom thou love. &gt;&gt; Now suit yourself brothers. Because some little little light affliction happen in our life and even the pastor is jittery whether you are going to remain in the church or not. &gt;&gt; What's wrong with us? &gt;&gt; We are not bed plans. &gt;&gt; We should be Christians, &gt;&gt; solid pedigree, &gt;&gt; rooted. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lazarus thy friend whom thou love. They were doing that to arouse the emotion of our Lord. Making it intimate so that he can find the need to come and attend to the man who has been there for him. Lazarus was there for Christ. But in the hour of his greatest need, it didn't look like Christ was there for him. Now you find you find comfort in the story because you have read how it ended. If you were there on that day and you were looking at the attitude of Christ, what would you see of him? Think about it. That's the way to read the Bible. That's the way to locate your identity. Because brother Brown said some people were there who took a wrong side that this must be a mean pastor. The whole denominations where Lazarus and his family came out took advantage of that and were selling ideas. We told you before. We told you don't follow these latter day preachers who came from nowhere. The whole kind priest is good enough for you. They have they have a rich history of commitment and support to your family all your life. When your parents were nobody, they made them somebody. When they couldn't take care of you, they gave them support. They raised you all through their curriculums and everything. You grow up and you start talking nonsense that you find one pastor Jesus. By the way, who is he? Where is his family? Isn't that the guy they said was born one virgin conceive? Brother Abraham said that old church had a real reason to do what? And he said, go read the message. Then Jesus came and called. He said, let's play devil advocate. You will see that by all the actions of Jesus, these guys outwardly showed more love &gt;&gt; what you we call love. &gt;&gt; When when your so-called love is malicious, &gt;&gt; malicious in the sense that in the sense that your good deed is tailored towards vindicating somebody as evil, &gt;&gt; is a sacrifice of fool. God will not accept it. The more they call for Jesus, the farther he was going. He got to to Toronto. By the time Lazarus got to ICU, Jesus was in New York waiting to board his direct flight to Africa and he was in our church when Lazarus died in Africa in Lagos. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He did 11 hour 11 hour flight from New York. If he went through Atlanta 13 hours, but he was in our church preaching. He was so far away until when the man died, he couldn't even attend his funeral. And yet he offered no explanation to his committed church members. If it were you, what would you do? I'm asking you church place your actions your reactions your manner your complexes place it upon the word &gt;&gt; and see if it fits you saw you see can see the reason why Paul when he was approaching the church he approached the church in a manner that looks insensitive when they said there's no temptation that happens to you that is uncommon snap out of it To somebody that is an insensitive statement because you feel you are going through things &gt;&gt; and somebody is not minding you. But you know why he did that? He said that to jolt you out of self-pity. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because no matter what happened around you, as long as you stay under the blood, as long as you remain connected with Christ, Satan can never claim victory. The bumper of the blood is shielding the larger effect. People had gone through things. They've not even gone through half of what you are going through, they've committed suicide. So what kept you standing is the power of the blood. &gt;&gt; The devil knows that no matter how much he acts, he can't destroy you &gt;&gt; until he breaks your hedge. &gt;&gt; And the hedge is unbreakable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So stay in God's presence. Don't allow the devil to sell some ideas to you that what you are going through is a three P agenda. Three P's agenda. Personal peculiar problem. Personal peculiar problem. &gt;&gt; It's a problem like no other &gt;&gt; given to you personally. If you accept that lie, it's a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know why it's a lie? How many people do you know on this road of on this area of the church? How many homes have you entered on the streets where you live? Do you know it's possible you have inside some of the houses there? People who haven't seen the sun for more than 10 years. Folks who have been bedridden and still trusting God for a change. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. So how would your problem be too peculiar? &gt;&gt; It's a lie. You know why the devil is sending you that lie? He's trying to arouse you emotion &gt;&gt; to put you in a mode of complex against God. &gt;&gt; Because if you accept it, then you begin to ask yourself, why will God be personally mean to me? &gt;&gt; What evil have I done more than any other person? And by the time you start building on that, you know what's going to be happening? You are going to start having complex. If God will be that personally mean to me, what is the use of serving him? And unconsciously, you don't find interest in fellowship again. You don't find interest in reading the word. So you don't want to hear from somebody who is mean to you. You don't find interest in prayer again. You don't want to talk to somebody who is mean to you. And you know what is going to happen by that? It's going to put you in a backsliding condition and gradually isolate you &gt;&gt; from your protection. &gt;&gt; Because until you isolated, Satan knows that he cannot destroy you. &gt;&gt; It does not have access as much as you think he has. &gt;&gt; That is why grace has been keeping you &gt;&gt; through all holes. &gt;&gt; Don't leave your place of safe retreat. &gt;&gt; No matter what happened, &gt;&gt; stay in God's presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because one of these days help will come. &gt;&gt; Jesus will come &gt;&gt; and he will break the tempter's power. He will take away every gloom and fill your life with glory. &gt;&gt; Stay in the environment where connecting with him is possible. &gt;&gt; If you want to kill a coal or fire, isolate it from bunch of coals or fire. The day you take it out from bunch of coals of fire, that is the moment you kill it. &gt;&gt; The death will manifest later. Because when you take it out, it still has on fire. But you know what? It can't retain it. It will gradually start fading until it fully extinguished. That is the meaning of backslidiness. &gt;&gt; Don't accept it. &gt;&gt; Stay with the Lord. &gt;&gt; No matter what happen, stay in the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't be as good as a Christian ought not to be when you leave the church. &gt;&gt; Stay in the church. &gt;&gt; One of these days it will be your turn. The Lord of harvests will pass by &gt;&gt; and change it all for you. He's not unmindful of your condition. If he brings it your way is because he knows he's giving you the capacity to handle it. Ask for grace each day. Serve him closer. Serve him more. respond to the devil's attack with a greater service. &gt;&gt; Are you encouraged? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, Job was in service and the Lord said it again. He said, "This time around, let me add one more quality. &gt;&gt; He has integrity &gt;&gt; and he retained it." So, the trial scaled his value &gt;&gt; before the Lord. And of course, Satan would don't appreciate that again. Instead of acknowledging it, you must acknowledge good things. Don't operate by the mindset of the devil. If a sister comes to sing special number and it blesses our soul, let us acknowledge them. &gt;&gt; Let us encourage them. Let's not sit in the seat of the devil. Why? Why is she singing special number? She's trying to make herself available so that brothers can see her. Shame on you. &gt;&gt; He's got a new dress at Canadian super pastor. She want us to see her dress. Shame on you. &gt;&gt; Who told you? &gt;&gt; Are you a tool in the hand of the devil? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; If a brother sing a special number, let's appreciate it. &gt;&gt; God visits people by that. He visits people by visit. He heals people by visit. Just a word of encouragement. He heals by song. He heals by the preaching of the gospel. Let me tell you to the pure, all things are pure. &gt;&gt; Don't operate by the mindset of the kingdom of darkness. &gt;&gt; It's Satan that doesn't appreciate good things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Instead of him saying that, ah, no, on this one, God, you were right. I didn't know Job could handle that. I give him a salute but let me do further. His only response is skin for skin. &gt;&gt; Read your Bible. &gt;&gt; He has forgotten what he said that if I take everything he had, he will deny you. Now Job never denied. He came to service and he said that it's because it's only his property. If you allow me to touch him personally, give him some cancers, some tubacolosis, some whatever. You medical people, you know all this story. I don't want to know them by his grace. Hallelujah. But I know all I know them to all be demons. &gt;&gt; Because Satan is the originator. &gt;&gt; He said it in the book of Job himself. He says skin for skin. All that a man has he will be ready to give up for his life. In other words, he thought that Job will compromise with him to get back his healing. That's what he was saying. And God laughed again. You are you are an incurable pessimistic optimist. That's what God told you. I said, Satan said you are incurable negative optimist. After all this, you think you can see guy by guy. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's do another round. Let's take a bet. And they took the B again. &gt;&gt; And this time around, Satan went very vicious. &gt;&gt; He could have killed Job if God had not said you can do everything &gt;&gt; but is life. &gt;&gt; That tells you the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Your challenges in life are not designed to destroy you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must remain positive. &gt;&gt; What kills us many a time is being negative. Our system, our organs fight hard for us as long as we remain positive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Medical science said nature fights hard as long as the man has not given up because they did they did a a a research of those who have terminal diseases. And some said they asked some do you still have the will to leave? And they said we have the will to leave. They put them on one side. Then the others they said, "Do you still have the will to leave?" They said, "No, no, no, no. I better just go." They put them on the other side and they watched them for about three to six months. Those who said they do not have the will to leave, by the end of that observation study, they were all dead. He said, "But those who said they have the will to leave were still alive." And they said when they were studying their system, they realized that those who said they no longer have the will to live, their organs began to gradually shut down. And science is wondering what is the connection between their mouth and their organs. &gt;&gt; And I jumped. I said, I know it. &gt;&gt; My prophet told me, &gt;&gt; he said, your body will obey your confession. The Bible said Christ is the high priest &gt;&gt; of our profession. &gt;&gt; To profess and to confess means the same thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is why brother Abraham said don't never be negative. &gt;&gt; Always be positive. &gt;&gt; L. &gt;&gt; He said if I'm declared that I'm going to die of what use is faith? The prophet said of what use is worry and fear? Worry and fear will kill you before the time. But faith can sign your pardon. &gt;&gt; Faith can revive your organ. It can even change your part &gt;&gt; and re repair where necessary and replace where necessary &gt;&gt; and you can come out of the most deadly situation. &gt;&gt; He said they looked at those on the other side who said they have the will to leave. They discovered their organs were fighting hard to retain their life. This is what science said. And that science vindicated the word. So it cost you nothing to retain your integrity, to retain your faith. It could mean a word of blessings. The day you give up, that is to say you start going. &gt;&gt; Skin for skin. All a man has he will give. And God say you go ahead and let's see what happened. Brethren, Satan went ahead and he dealt with Job so bad. But he was watching for that statement. God, today I curs you. He didn't get it. &gt;&gt; It was so bad. It was so bad. But the Bible said Job sinnth not. He couldn't explain. He said, "I thought we have had enough, but this has come again. Lord, you know why the devil became frustrated. He went to the wife. He said, "Say something. Say something." And when the wife too will not say something, he used a her voice to echo his own word. It wasn't Job's wife who said that. It was Satan using her voice. Cause God and die. Because the mission of Satan is to get Job to cause God and die. But see a righteous man, a perfect man, he sense that. He said, "Honey, that's not you. &gt;&gt; I won't take that against you because that isn't you." &gt;&gt; Ah, we we don't make excuse for one another again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we are losing love. &gt;&gt; But Job retained the love of God in his heart. He said, "Honey, that's not you. &gt;&gt; I know who you are. I know your integrity. I know your life. You are not a foolish woman. But this statement that came out looks like one of them. Jolt yourself out of it. &gt;&gt; That's a good husband. &gt;&gt; That's a Christian husband. &gt;&gt; That's a son of God with the wisdom of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham said, "I come to my house sometimes things don't look like I left it." He said, "But I take the challenge to attack the invader." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because is the devil invading the atmosphere in my house? &gt;&gt; I've got to deal with the devil. Send him out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then come back to my wife. Correction must be placed in the right atmosphere. &gt;&gt; When you do it at the wrong time, the sister will not see it. The brother will not see it. Even the children will not see it. And you must do it with love. That is the quality of a Christian husband. That is why brother Arab said your wife, it will be easy for her to reverence you when she sees you as a genuine son of God. &gt;&gt; No true child of God sees something real and does not have reverence. &gt;&gt; It's so bad. A lot of us look like angels in the house of the Lord, but we live like a tigers in our houses. God knows your house address. &gt;&gt; Repent this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Job said, "That's not you." Brother Abraham said, "I start doing things to bring back the atmosphere because I know that woman has had a lot to go through." Can you see him making excuse for his wife? He comes and say, "I saw a cloth at the super store. Let's go get it." Mother doesn't want to hear. He said, "Keep your cloth." I don't want because she's all worked up and tensed up. And the prophet will be saying, "Oh, uh, how how bad it could get sometimes." This woman doesn't have her space. A lot of sick people are all over the house. If she wouldn't even have the space to even cook for the family, take care of things. She's under so much pressure. The prophet making excuse for his wife. &gt;&gt; Then he said, "You know what I start doing? I start doing things to bring back the smile. &gt;&gt; I try to he say I try to wash. I try to cook even though I hardly can boil water successfully. Yeah, those are quotations. He said I try to cook. I I get the apron start tidying up the kitchen. And you know sometimes when the devil evates and attack the head, it spills over the children. He said all the children are just crying, messed up and said I try to gather them together, wash them, redress them. Said why I'm doing those things, I'm watching my wife. Then when I see her mellow down, he said I walk over to her and just give her a part. She doesn't know what I'm doing. But do you know what the prophet is doing? Said why parting? I'm saying Lord let your peace that is in me go to her now. &gt;&gt; Brethren, that shook me when I saw that. So you got to have it in you first because you can't give what you don't have. At such times you must be ready to share virtues. He said let your peace that is in me go to her now. And he said before you know it the smile start coming back her face and she will say what time does the store close? Can we pick that dress? That's not American lifestyle. Is giving you the recipe of the kingdom. May God help you. May God help me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Job overcame that the aggression of the devil that would have come through the wife. Then we are closing now. The friends came, the brothers in church. Job had it from every angle right from the devil. He moved through his family. Then he's coming out to the through the church. The Bible said when they were approaching the house because Joe by his condition now couldn't stay hinder he was out there the hospital has rejected him. I mean they've put him in his own personal opice just to observe him and die. So these folks came around and as they were approaching the Bible said Job was so bad until they couldn't recognize the prince again. He was so bad. And uh when they came to him, God bless you, brother Joe. And for the next seven days, read your Bible, they went into personal coma themselves. They couldn't speak because of the shock of how bad the devil has dealt with a man. They couldn't even talk for seven days. They were in awe. It was like, "Ah, is this what it is? And for the next seven days, they kept gazing. It's in your Bible. If the Bible said it, I believe it. &gt;&gt; Seven days they couldn't find their voice. &gt;&gt; Maybe your condition hasn't got enough of that because we could still see us and say, "Lord have mercy." Was what we said. He didn't take our voice. He didn't put us into coma. But this one pull them into a condition like that. So you can see there's nothing new under the sun. &gt;&gt; Is it challenging your faith now? &gt;&gt; All right. When they found their voice, sorry brother. Sorry brother. Sorry brother. And all of them became emotional. And Jo the devil started taking over his emotion and started saying I caused the day I was born. I caused the news because he saw his own brethren. You know he was expressing himself and and the devil was saying there we go. But you remember the deal is caused God. Job caused every other thing. He refused to curse God. When he didn't do that we lost again. He said, "But with these three guys, I will rebound." Then he started walking on those guys. And the brothers changed. You know, brother, you know, brother, you know, brother, is there anything to make right? And Job said, "Well, by the grace of God, I've searched just like you were thinking. I found nothing." Don't forget, God had said Satan made him move against Job without without reason. &gt;&gt; But that was in the spirit realm. Nobody knew it in the church. &gt;&gt; And the attitude of the believer of the brethren is that when thing happens, the first thing is who sinned? When they saw that man born without eyes, born blind without eyes, the first question is pastor who us is he himself, father, mother, grandparent, generational something. That's our attitude. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and let me tell you very strongly, as long as you you maintain such an attitude, it might be difficult for you to be a comforter to righteousness. &gt;&gt; You must keep an open heart. If your brother, your sister said, "I've searched myself nothing." The best you can do is to say, "Lord, help my brother. &gt;&gt; Help my sister." Don't come to a conclusion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the Joseph, Job's friend came to a conclusion that nobody is ever tampered with like this if nothing is wrong in their lives. The prophet taught us that the devil cannot set a foot on you to ought you to attack you to meme you until first you get out of the word is the word of the Lord but it's not the total truth. Listen to me church judge. The other side of the truth is that you may do you may not do anything and yet it will be pleasing to God to run you through the meals for his own purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't come out of it, God may relax the edge. Job never came out of the word. That was why I gave you those background. He stayed under the atonement. It was God who pulled it open for the devil to have access. And yet he didn't tell why. You can read the story in retrospect and know why. But if you were there that day, what side would you take? And I'm saying that your sight can be very dangerous and put you in anger, in wrath before God. &gt;&gt; So things you don't know, keep quiet. &gt;&gt; Just commit it to God. &gt;&gt; Offer all the assistance you could and leave it there. &gt;&gt; Don't go home sitting in the seat of the critic &gt;&gt; and say, is you see the people don't always like to repent. How can things like this happen? And you are telling me your life is right with God. That is you talking. No matter how thin you slice anything, it will always have the two sides. &gt;&gt; Look at the paper we use. As thin as the hedge is that you almost cannot see it visibly. Yes, it's got two sides. Amen. And that is where the message came to you and I when the prophet started the ministry, he showed him two trees, Calvinist and Armenianism. He said, "Don't nurture any of these two trees. Take the truth from here. take the truth from here and come to the middle of the road to plant the tree for the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message came to us balanced &gt;&gt; and it put us into the middle of the road because the middle of the road is the safest &gt;&gt; balanced aspect of the road. If you move this side, it slants a bit. It slants a bit on this side in order not to have collection of water that could make a flood in the middle of the road. Are you getting it? So, it washes it off here. It washes it off here and it let it out through the gutters by the cover. &gt;&gt; So the middle of the road is the best place for you to drive. &gt;&gt; And somebody said if you drive in the middle of the road, you will crash. Is because that fellow has no understanding of the journey. &gt;&gt; We are traveling on one way. &gt;&gt; We don't go back. We only keep going forward. Amen. &gt;&gt; When that man left Jer Jerusalem and was coming to Jericho, he met bandits that almost destroyed the life. Amen. We keep going ascending to Jerusalem. We don't come back to Jericho. So, it's a oneway road. So, it's safe to drive in the middle of the road. Get your vehicle balanced and slam on the throttle. Praise God. &gt;&gt; It was this revelation these brothers don't have. And once your foundation, your premise of impression is wrong, all your contributions will be wrong. Even though you are quoting the scriptures or the message, listen to me. The scriptures you are quoting is not wrong. The message, the spoken word you are quoting is not wrong. But your application of it will be so wrong. And instead of offering a blessing, it will offer more disaster because it is premised on the wrong assumption. Amen. &gt;&gt; Be careful. For 30 chapters or so, 28 to 30 chapters, these brethren kept pounding Job. I want to summarize it so you can go. They kept pounding Job so hard until they wanted to break that man. But brother said the man couldn't be broken. You know why? Because he knew he was under the blood. He knew he met all requirements. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When a man comes under the blood and he met God's requirement, sermons don't send you out of the church, there's no word that condemns you. Even if it visits your life is to give you a thanksgiving &gt;&gt; and they reshape it. &gt;&gt; That man stood still because he met God's requirement and his friends were mad at him, but he retained his ground and the whole thing became a mess. Read your Bible. Miserable comforters. When everything has become a mess, God knew when to come down. But before he could come down, he sent one man called &gt;&gt; Elio, &gt;&gt; a young man. You remember that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because even though Job was consolidating his blessings by his trial, yet this brethren refused to let go. &gt;&gt; It was in his trial that his revelation went higher. He had more value than he had more revelation. Job had preached about resurrection but you know throughout his resurrection preaching he couldn't preach about human resurrection. Read your Bible. He said when a tree dies he can live again. Then the church member said how about us? He said we are waiting for the revelation. But that revelation came in the hour of his trial benefits in trial. I know my redeemer liveth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ara said the friends move him to the darkest hour and God had to do something and he showed him the mind of God and he reflected the future until Job not only see the redeemer whom he called the redeemer before he did the redemption. [Music] &gt;&gt; It was because he saw it. He not only saw the redeemer resurrected, he saw himself also resurrected in a better body. And he said, "Though the skin worms destroyed this body, yet in my flesh shall I see the Lord whom I shall behold another another." Then in his trouble, he went back to the church. He said, "Now we have answer to the resurrection of man." Still in his trouble. And the devil rebounded again until Elu came down. And when Elu came down, he put Job in his place. He put his friends in his place. He repaired the altar. Changed the atmosphere. Then my God came down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He will come through for you. When Jesus comes, the tempter's power is broken. &gt;&gt; He will take the gloom. He will fill the life with glory. Everything is bound to turn around for better when he comes. He will always come. Wait for him. Those that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as an eagle. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. Lord, teach me to wait. &gt;&gt; Learn to wait upon the Lord because he will certainly come true. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; Last line, &gt;&gt; when God came down, God told the three brothers, this your 30, 28 or to 30 chapters of sermon was a waste of time. Read your Bible. I'm using contemporary language &gt;&gt; because when God said you have not represented me well, what does it mean? &gt;&gt; You preached empty sermons &gt;&gt; that did not projected Christ. &gt;&gt; It's a waste of time. &gt;&gt; And because you haven't represented me well, I am annoyed with you. &gt;&gt; God told them, &gt;&gt; I am annoyed. My wroth is upon you. Did they quote the word? Go and read some of their statements. They are powerful, &gt;&gt; real wisdom. I challenge you to read them. Powerful words. Why will God summarize all those powerful statements as a poor representation of him? Because it was premised on wrong impression. That is why I said the spoken word quotations are perfect. The scripture quotations are perfect. But when you misapply them, &gt;&gt; That's right. That lifegiving resource become a poison. That is why brother said before you can take anything as a truth even though it's coming from the word it must not be misinterpreted mislocated misrepresented. &gt;&gt; Watch those three things brothers. &gt;&gt; That's how to build a total church. So he said you haven't represented me well. Now this brother you called a secret sinner. Now you go to him and they say what for sir for prayer sir you you you mean you mean &gt;&gt; brother Job will lay hands on us said perfectly. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If if it's a complicated seal for you I've opened it. So believe it now. &gt;&gt; You go to him to pray for you. So let me warn you only his prayer &gt;&gt; will I accept. &gt;&gt; So in case in case you want to feel spiritual by going to pastor CL you are wasting your time. Go to pastor Job. Don't go to pastor Moses. His prayer is good, but it's not going to work for you right now. &gt;&gt; The one whose prayer I want to hear upon you is that of Job. Pastor Joe, &gt;&gt; the man you call secret sinner holds the monopoly for your pardon. Now you think Job have had trials, right? This is his biggest test. This is the test that will challenge the love of God in his heart. If you truly have the love of God, you will have a forgiven spirit. &gt;&gt; Did you hear me? &gt;&gt; Whether people ask for it or not, &gt;&gt; you are more willing to forgive. That is why brother Arab said when your brother does you wrong, listen to me. He said you make excuse for them before God and say he didn't mean to do it. &gt;&gt; It's a quotation. &gt;&gt; It's a quotation. If you want me to give you, I will give you to bro Moses will give you to save your time. Did you hear me? &gt;&gt; He said you make excuse for them that they didn't mean to do it. &gt;&gt; If you come on that premise, will you have problem with anybody? Brother said, "If you hold art in your heart, you are walking over the dangers of hell fire." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't scratch the wound of your heart too deep. That is what makes you to be unforgiving. &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said? Forgiveness will be very natural to a converted gentile bride of Christ. Because when he was opening the seals for us, he came to the fifth seals souls under the altar. He said the very very first idea for me to know that this cannot be the gentile bread material is the way they were asking for vengeance. &gt;&gt; Turn it another way. It means that the gentile bride materials will naturally not have it in them to seek for vengeance. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. M &gt;&gt; help us Lord. &gt;&gt; You are going to leave here and go and reconcile with those people you have written off &gt;&gt; you don't want to talk to again if you want to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because I will tell you this afternoon that the reason it will be so easy for the gentile bride to easily forgive is that they came themselves they were born under the powerful utterance of forgiveness. Brother Abraham said, "Those Hebrew patriarchs when they were being born, whatever their mammas uttered in the pains of delivery, positionally place them in their inheritance." And as powerful as Joshua was, he couldn't come out of that utterance to divide the lands in the land of promise to give each person a location. He was guided by the utterances of their mother in the pins of delivery. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with the prophet? &gt;&gt; You agree with the prophet? &gt;&gt; Then do you also realize that for your new birth you had a mother too? &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; How come you think it's my father, my mother, my sister, her my brother? Do you have the revelation of that? Who are you referring to? &gt;&gt; Jesus. Right. said, you say it's everything to you. And when Jesus our Lord is described as the El Shadai, what do you think El Shadai means? The breasted one. Do you describe a man as the breasted one? &gt;&gt; That is the feminism of God, the motherhood of God. &gt;&gt; El shall die. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, &gt;&gt; brother Abraham said when you get tired, when you get so so worked up and weary, you can go to the bosom of your papa, of your mama, and nurse yourself back to life. &gt;&gt; El Shai. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if it was El Shai, then it's your mama. And he told the disciples when the Greeks were saying we will see Jesus. He said the Greeks the Gentile cannot see me until my glorification. Meaning until my burial, until my death, burial, resurrection, ascension before ascension and final ascension, the Gentiles will not see me. So you came by the birth of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Gethsemane was God's labor room for you. When it became ripe for your delivery, he went to the cross of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Satan wanted to your delivery. Brother Arab said Christ went with you in him to Calvary. &gt;&gt; He wanted to your delivery by suggesting autotopedic surgery instead of Cesaria. &gt;&gt; That was why he made the soldiers to pick armor to break the legs of the thieves. But when they came to Jesus, the surgery was already began because Jesus was already under anesthesia. They said he is dead and God said, "You are dump. We are in the theater for CS. You are carrying armor. What's wrong with you? Drop that armor &gt;&gt; and pick the right instrument." Then he had to take the spear, &gt;&gt; the needle for surgery &gt;&gt; and went to the side &gt;&gt; and we saw element of birth. Blood and water came out. &gt;&gt; Then who has came out? Who came out after that? &gt;&gt; That was where you were born. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now when your mama was giving birth to you, what was he saying before he went under an estasia? Father forgive them. This man has revelation. Father forgive them for they know not what they were doing. You were born under the birth pain or forgiveness. &gt;&gt; So you cannot be born under death and not have a forgiven spirit. Forgiveness is your placement in life. So if you claim an unforgiven spirit, it's a very evidence that you are not yet born again by Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you have an unforgiven spirit, you are the problem of yourself. Yes, &gt;&gt; you are the hindrance to your life &gt;&gt; because the Lord said, "If you forgive, I forgive you." &gt;&gt; Let's close by this. These friends of Job accepted the verdict of the word and they came to Job. But imagine if Job had said, "Ah, you earth me so bad. You hurt me so bad." And he kept scratching the wound of the earth. The more you scratch, the more bloody it becomes. Do you realize that? And the more you are peeling the layers of the skin. If you are not careful, you will peel it to the bone and it becomes is become more difficult for you to heal. &gt;&gt; The reason some of you are not healing is that you don't look at the right place. You always scratching the wound. &gt;&gt; Stop scratching the wound. &gt;&gt; Leave the wound alone. &gt;&gt; Let God apply his bomb in there. And some of you say, "But you get the prophet said, I can forgive and not forget." It's only God that has the capacity to forget. I agree with you 100% is the word. But do you understand the word? I challenge your understanding of that word. If you truly forgive, it will take the pain out of your memory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If something has happened, it has happened. &gt;&gt; But when you remember it with a feeling of all hatred and anger, you haven't forgiven. When you remember it later with the feeling of joy, thank God for taking us out of this. &gt;&gt; Then it shows you are truly forgiven. &gt;&gt; So in your not forgetting, there is no pain in your memory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the true deliverance. &gt;&gt; If Job failed to do that, see what happened. Job 42:10. That's the last line. I hope it's been a blessing to you. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Thank you for your patience. Amen. Job chapter 2. Chapter 42. I mean chapter 42. Let's let's read from verse 9. Are you there? &gt;&gt; So Haleifas the Temonite and Build the Shuite and Zofa the Namatite went and did according as the Lord commanded them. The Lord also accepted Job. What he did for his friends, the Lord accepted. Are you here? Now, let's watch verse 10. At this moment that God came down, there have been a stop. God has put a stop to the action of the devil. But even though there have been a stop, Job has never received any recovery. Now watch. And the Lord turned the captiv captivity of Job when he did what? &gt;&gt; When he prayed for his friends. &gt;&gt; Meaning up till that moment his captivity remained. &gt;&gt; Thank you ma'am. &gt;&gt; And you cannot pray and the Lord will accept like he said the Lord accepted it if it does not come with love and forgiveness. He released them from his heart. So when you release people, you are actually releasing yourself. &gt;&gt; You are refusing to short change your life. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Now watch. And also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. It was after prayer, after forgiveness, after Job overcame and passed the final test. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That he received total recovery. &gt;&gt; So let me ask you, why did Job went through all this just for God to purge him and prepare him with the character and maturity to handle a blessing greater than he ever had. Brother Abraham said, "Power with character is fit to rule." &gt;&gt; Before God can place you in a position, he works on your character. &gt;&gt; He caused David to be anointed, but he wasn't installed until after seven or eight years over Judah and 15 years over Israel. Why was God eager to anoint him and not eager to install him? Because between the time of his anointing and installation, Jo must be prepared &gt;&gt; for the throne, for the power. &gt;&gt; His anointing is to witness to him his purpose in life. &gt;&gt; But before he could come into that purpose, he needs character. That was why you go read Job, David went through all the tests. God delivered Saul to him twice &gt;&gt; and twice he passed the exams. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Building his character. He came to Zigglac where he was under pressure yet under pressure. David refused to act under pressure. He asked for effort. He wanted to know the will of God even if it at the cost of his family. &gt;&gt; That was a man prepared for the throne. &gt;&gt; We're going to rule and reign. Brethren. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right now we are even ruling and reigning. &gt;&gt; The power of spoken word is going to be demonstrated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In full measure &gt;&gt; and you have a part in it. That's the promise of the word. &gt;&gt; But God will not entrust you. God will not entrust you before he trusts you. He must trust you first. &gt;&gt; And the way to bring trust is to walk upon your character. &gt;&gt; So that because the bride must know what to do with the word and the power of God. Job was a millionaire. God wanted him to be a billionaire. And the character to handle million is different from that &gt;&gt; of billion. The maturity, the wisdom for it are completely different. This was the only reason Job went through that. By the time he came out, he was more than ready &gt;&gt; for double portion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whatever you are going through, God has a purpose. &gt;&gt; They are not designed to consume you. They are to prepare you for a greater visitation to make you a blessing to somebody who will need it. The prophet said God healed a sister who was playing a piano of a cancer to become a blessing to another person who will go through it. That was why when that person came through the prayer line, Brother Arab told her, "You don't need my hand. You need the hand of that sister &gt;&gt; because she's been healed of the same thing. Now you go to her &gt;&gt; and let her pray for you and I shall say amen." and the sister was healed. &gt;&gt; David went through the challenges of beer and lion in order to prepare him to be the savior or the deliverer for the entire church so that somebody could say, "I know." And when Golth came, it was only him who could stand out because he's been through things. God has a purpose in all his wisdom for whatever he permits. Let's just trust him &gt;&gt; that the strength of Israel can never fail. He knows what he's doing. And if we wait upon him, it will come clear and we shall be victorious. I leave you into the hands of your savior. God bless you. [Applause] God bless you. Thank you so much. Amen. Bless you, sir. Thank you so much. [Music] I don't know where to start. I don't know where to end. It's just wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; God has been so good to us. &gt;&gt; God knows what we have need of &gt;&gt; and I think God God sent his servant here because he he knows what we are going through and just want to say thank you for his grace. you know um as touched that that that subject of job at the beginning as a minister sometimes it's it's a hard to to to speak about it because it's about suffering no one likes suffering as he mentioned at some point if if we knew and so want to go and god testify about you know we will not raise our hand because humanly speaking we don't like that but do you know that suffering as I look at if you allow me to say a few words here give me five minutes and my children as they're young I don't talk to them about suffering you know life is good and everything is good and positive and everything it's just just everything they're just in that young age they don't understand they're just living their life the first thing they're thinking about playing and everything and eating and how what are you going to eat today and but as they grow up and they become mature there's a point where I have to address them you know what life is not that easy you know it you have to face things so put that in the spiritual realm when God start talking to you about suffering it means he knows that you are mature that's why He started by saying Job Job was perfect means he already arrived at the perfection that all we want to be. But if you want to be really a strong believer, strong rugged Christian, you have to have the revelation of what suffering, what's the place of suffering in a Christian life. Then Satan becomes [Music] powerless because you have now the revelation of what suffering means. Means the tool that the Satan can use to defeat you, he can't use it on you anymore. Amen. Because if it's just a young believer, any small suffering, he would put you away, right? But as you got age around you protect you but when you become mature the only thing the devil can use it suffering because he cannot bring you to deny the word of God he won't he won't come and tell the message is wrong no you know that it's the truth the only place he can come is on your suffering as you go through life and you will point to different thing as the as the servant has point will point to the pastor will point to the believers, they point to the situation you're going through, you point to your family, different things happening, but you stay looking to Jesus Christ and say, "God is in control of everything." That's the capstone revelation. I like that. That's the capstone revelation. God, help me as you have opened my eyes today to have that capstone revelation. Amen. Is that is that something you can God help me to maintain that capstone revelation? No matter the circumstances, let me be the true worshipper no matter the circumstances. Is that the desire of your heart? The prophet will say at one place I think how can I overcome? The best thing that can happen to you as an overcomer is a test. The best thing after salvation test because the test is not to tempt you to put you down. The test is to prove that who you are really are. And God can never give you a test beyond what you can sustain. Amen. God bless you. I really may God bless his servant. May God bless the word that we heard this morning. Amen. I was thinking I don't want to say in the wrong way but I love the Lord Jesus Christ and he has been so good to me. Amen. I I just appreciate the minister if if he has to come if the Lord terries brother D hopefully he he can pastor Taylor if he can hear me next time when he's coming if he has an opportunity to come to Canada we don't want him to forget us. May he put us in his plan for another Saturday, for another Sunday, God willing. Amen. If we have three services, even Sunday evening as well. May God bless him richly. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
