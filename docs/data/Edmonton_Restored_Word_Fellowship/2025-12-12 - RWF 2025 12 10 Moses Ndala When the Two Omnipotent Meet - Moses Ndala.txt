Summary of "When the Two Omnipotent Meet" — Sermon preached Wed. Dec. 10th, 2025 by Brother Moses Ndala, senior pastor at Restored Word Fellowship in Edmonton, Alberta.

In this sermon, Brother Moses centers his message on Jacob’s wrestling with the Angel in Genesis 32:24–30, presenting it as a powerful picture of how God’s omnipotence meets determined human faith. He explains that Jacob was already blessed by God before he was born, as foretold to Rebekah (Genesis 25:23), yet Jacob still carried a deep hunger for more of God. Though blessed by his father Isaac, prospered under Laban, and protected by God from his enemies, Jacob refused to live satisfied with past blessings. Brother Moses emphasizes that Jacob’s attitude is the true model for believers: never becoming complacent, but continually pressing for a deeper experience with God. When Jacob wrestled with the angel and said, “I will not let thee go, except thou bless me” (Genesis 32:26), he demonstrated a faith that would not release God until the promise became personal and real. Brother Moses connects this teaching with Brother Branham’s emphasis that a man can “prevail with God” when faith and God’s Word come into contact.

Brother Moses develops the theme that “when the two omnipotent meet”, something must happen. God is omnipotent through His promises, and the believer becomes spiritually “omnipotent” by faith that fully believes those promises. Jacob’s wrestling produced a name change, from Jacob to Israel, showing that real encounters with God bring a change of nature, not just a change of circumstances (Genesis 32:28). Brother Moses teaches that believers today face their own “Esau,” symbolizing the flesh, fear, and pressure of life, but victory comes through desperate prayer and determination. He stresses that desperation is not weakness, but spiritual s...

We are still in that school and he's still training us but we rely only on him and him alone. And for the believers or sometimes sometimes things don't get easy. You don't get everything just like that. Sometimes you at least from experience I don't get things easy unless I go through to my knees then I get the result. So he's teaching me that you can't do things on your own. You have to depend on me. Have to depend on me. And we thank God for that. Thank God. I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Good to be in the house of the Lord. Thank you, brother Joseph and Melody and for the creating the atmosphere to thank the Lord and thank you for each and everyone coming this evening. Greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Good to be in the house alone. As I send that quote that I was just looking at it and oh that's that's so good. Sometimes you know the enemy might come and say you know that service was not for me and that church. Why did I go to church in this cold and everything? You know, it was not even a service that was maybe for someone else, not for me. But it was good that you came to church at least to show the devil and which side you are &gt;&gt; just to give him a punch a little bit. And I said, you know, I'm on the side of the believers and whatever it is in store, God is helping me. Amen. Let's go to the word of God in Genesis chapter 2 32. 32 and then Genesis 32. Thank God for the service on Sunday morning. Just a good service. I enjoyed it. Just to have an evangelist approach kind of good. stir us a little bit just to okay the power of decision the power of the choice and today you can make a difference by your choice just just enjoy that it's like you must follow every from from time to time just say God I have a power you have given me the power you have given me the responsibility to make a decision brother was told you made a decision you chose You chose a way and it was the narrow way, not the popular way, but you made that choice and God was happy with his choice. That was also my choice. That was my way and that will bring victory in love divine. Praise be to God. Genesis 32. Thank God for just pray for Christian walk and made a decision to follow the Lord. Daddy I want to serve the Lord bless him. Genesis 32 24. Father we thank you for your grace Lord. Thank you for be among believers saints. Father, Lord, precious bride of Jesus Christ, those who died for that can gather together, the same faith, the same expectation, the same hope that we are sharing. But we just want to pray that bless them Lord this evening as we come to you in a way of prayer. Lord, as you use each and every one of us to bring the needs that we have to you as you have need of of our lips, needs of our heart, Father, to bring those needs your presence. I pray as open word of God just to share Lord the thought may you inspire me and also anoint each and every one when we come out of this service be ready for pray. service can say Lord the Lord indeed was with us. Our heart was burning in us as we heard the word of God as we went to pray. Father we love you and appreciate you. Bless each individual family those who are here and those who live online everything to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Genesis 32:24 30 Jacob experience. Bible says Jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. It says when he saw that he prevailed not against him and the angel did not prevail against Jacob, he touched the hallow of his thigh and the hallow of Jacob's thie was out of joint and he rest as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the break the day breakth and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called no more Jacob but Israel for as a prince has thou power with God and with man and hast prevailed man and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee by name and he said where wherefore is it that was asked after my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of the place for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved may God bless reading of the word Just wonderful. Just want to maybe the thoughts those who heard me on Sunday there. I just want to be the continuation that he touched. I don't know. But I just want to share that with this evening. Come back to it maybe another time on another angle. I always marvel at the life of Jacob. Always marvel at life of Jacob. Jacob was is in the in the in the masterpiece masterpiece message prophet called him. He was the is the is the grace of God. The grace of God is the type of the grace of God. was always marvel at the life of Jacob because he's someone who was actually blessed. He's someone who was blessed before he was even born. Someone was blessed because God said to God told God told Rebecca Rebecca, "You'll have two children. It's not rich. Sometimes I can be right. So he told Rebecca said, "No, no, no, Rebecca, you know, you have you have two children. You have two nations inside of you and those two nations, the younger one shall serve the the older ones." So he already predestinated already predestinated to be blessed. He already knew that you'll be blessed and I'm sure the mother probably already told him you know what I know this is the promise that belongs to you everything you'll be you'll be an overcomer you'll be blessed and she was already a little bit of favor favoritism towards him and because she already had the promise so in God's plan he was already blessed he was already blessed and he and indeed it was manifest in his life that he was blessed but I also always like his attitude I was always like his attitudes. Attitude is not attitude say okay I'm I'll be blessed when I stay like that. No attitude was Lord I want more of God. I want more of God blessings. He was blessed before he was born. The mother probably told him that he was blessed. He was blessed by his father. He was blessed by his father. He had the birthight. But that that if you look in his the Bible, he was even blessed by Laban is is is a is his father-in-law. Father-in-law realized I've been blessed because of you. So you must have been someone with prosperity. If I keep you with me, I'm blessed. And he realized that he was blessed was blessed. And when when he left and he ran away was about to come and be really angry with him and whatever he was planning to do to him really to hurt him God had to come and warn him that don't touch Jacob don't touch Jacob because he is according to my plan. So Jake Laban realized that that Jacob was blessed but even in that time and after that he made alliance with him this is no you can't be against me you have to take care of my daughters and then the Bible says he blessed Jacob Laban blessed Jacob so Jacob knew that he was blessed but even but even there he was still he was still wanting more of God more of God I think it's the right attitude of a believer right attitude of a Christians Lord, I'm coming to a prayer because I want more of you. I want more of the Holy Ghost. I want I have been baptized with the Holy Ghost, but I want more of the Holy Ghost, Lord. I want more of your love. I want more of your nature. I want more of dying to myself. As we as we special songs, Lord, I'm more of dying to myself. Help me to have the love of Christ more and more and more and more. Never come to a place where say, "Oh, now I'm full and I'm satisfied and that it and that." No. Lord, give me more of yourself. Give me more of your blessings. Father, I desire that you fill me with your love. Fill me with more of your love. So that's the constant desire of Jacob and what he and then when he came and he met the angel and he was wrestling with the angel, fighting with the angel and fighting the prophet says at one place says a man can actually prevail against against God. So that's what the Bible says. It's kind of hard statement to say, but the prophet said it, so I can say and the Bible actually said in verse 28 says, "So the prince has thou power with God and with man and has prevailed." That's why he was named Israel. So he prevailed. He prevailed against the angels. He has to rest with the angel. You have to bless me. I can't let you go unless you bless me. You have to bless me. And he rest with him. And I give the title, when the two omnipotent meet. When the two omnipotent meet, a result has to come. When the two omnipotent meet, a blessing has to come. God was the omnipotent God. He already gave a promise. He already blessed Jacob. But Jacob in return had also to fight for that blessing. Lord, I want you to bless me. Lord, bless me. Lord, this is your promise. This is what you gave me. I can't let it go until you bless me. Once the two omnipotent meet, the result has to come. The blessing has to be manifested. The blessing has to come. If you see a little bit earlier even verse 10 from verse 10 as as as Jacob is is crying because Jacob is in desperation. He's his brother is waiting for him. So he knows I'm I'm in trouble here. If God doesn't intervene, I'm in trouble. He knew that the Lord He came to him and told him that you have to go back in your land but there is someone on the way. Someone who has to meet. I will say we have the same enemy. Esau was there to persecute but he persecuted Israel to persecute Jacob. Esau is our flesh. Our flesh is still there to persecute us and to to put pressure upon us. You the flesh want to kill us. But we need to have an overcoming attitude. Lord I want Lord I pray God that you help me. You gave me the promise of of it might be healing. It might be the Holy Ghost. It might be fighting temper. Whatever it might be, Lord, you gave me the promise and I'm standing upon your promise. Bless me, Lord. Deliver me. Give me deliverance. Give me victory. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you read a little, it says as Jacob said, verse 9, Jacob said, "Oh God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord which saith unto me, return unto thy country and unto thy kindred, and I will deal with dwell with thee." The same thing we have done. There is no blessing outside of the message, outside of the word of God. I'm not worthy of the list of all the of the mercies and of all the truth which I has showed unto thy servant. For weave my staff I passed over this Jordan and now I am become too bent. Deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau for I fear him lest he will come and smite me and the mother of the children. What a desperation and the prophet preached me desperation. We need we need a Christian need to have that desperation. If you have a need of something God let me let me fall into that desperation. Lord give me Lord help me to have I desire it with all heart. Don't just don't know Lord I whenever whenever no Lord give me I I desire make your word become real to me and that I say I will surely do th good and make thy seed as a descend of the of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude. So he's quoting the promise that God gave to Abraham's taking that promise and he's applying to himself. So Lord this is the promise we gave our fathers. This is the promise you give in the if we can put it in our time. The promise you gave us in the word of God. Lord, may you come and fulfill your word. It might be for my children. Lord, I'm claiming my children because you said IN YOUR WORD YOU BELIEVE and you and your family shall be saved. That's your promise. Lord, I'm coming. I can't let you go unless you bless me, Lord. Bless me through your word. It's your promise. Your promise is omnipotent. Now I'm bringing my faith to your promise so that the two omnipotent can meet and the blessing will come forth. Amen. That's God principles says and and as we see the Jacob here he wanted he wanted a name changed. I want my my name to be changed. I want I want my name to be changed. I want my nature to be changed. I want a different work of I want a different might be within the same need for us. Lord, I I I I I desire a closer walk with you. I want to change my life. It changed my name. The name from from Jacob. I've been I've been living for like from a plant. I've been I've been I've been living from from lying to lying or this or this. No. But now I want a completely change in my life. I want something more more. I I can't meet I can't meet with the same nature I had before. No, I can't overcome. No, there is I need something greater than the flesh. I need something greater than my temper. I need something greater than than my jealousy. I need something greater than my pride. I need something that is have more power than the the things of the flesh. Amen. Lord, give me a change from the inside outside. I don't want to let you go unless you bless me. Lord, my desire, my determination is Lord for more of you. Lord, change my heart. Whatever it might be you are fighting with. It might be in the flesh. Might be your sick the sickness. Lord, I I can't meet it on my own. Lord, I need a change from the inside. I need just something to grasp you, Lord. Grasp by faith. At that time, he had not met Esau yet, but he knew from that time that I've met God face to face. I come this evening to meet God face to face. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just read what the prophet says here. It says says somebody beside he's asking a question what was name before says someone can answer be besides the preacher because there was a preacher was to raise his hand say no not then someone says yeah says Jacob yeah that's right Jacob before his name was changed what caused him to receive his spiritual name somebody says something brother says prevail with the angel prevail with the angel and rise with him and said I'll not let you go until you bless me You want a spiritual name tonight? Just get a hold of the Holy Spirit and say, "Lord, I'm not going to leave this tabernacle till you bless me. Things will look different when you leave." Says, "You be just as determined as Jacob was, you will be you will get a blessing." Oh God, help us to be more determined. Lord, watch. He touched his his thigh and Jacob walked different. Amen. I hope that goes way down home. When you wrestle with God, you will walk different after that. Watch. See on the other side of the brookie, the little river, he was a strong great man, backsliden though, away from God, running from his brother, running from God, and stout and sturdy. On the other side of the brook, a limping prince. The heart a prince before God. For you have power with God as a prince. A limping prince. And he limped all of his life. Oh, how God does things. Isn't that marvelous? Isn't he marvelous? On the other side, he was a great man, but inside empty, but on the other side, he looked like he was weak on the flesh, but great from the inside because he met the angel. We want a conference with God. Every time we come to a prayer meeting, it's a conference with God. It's the same at the same level as Jacob was meeting the angel there. That the same attitude we are coming with to the prayer meeting. Lord, I want to meet you, Lord. And I I I'm expecting a blessing from you, Lord. I might not see it right away, but I know that you'll bless me. I'm coming with expectation. And I'm coming, Father, with that hunger in my heart, Lord, for more of you. Lord, I can't let you go unless you bless me, Lord. Bless me. Glory to God. We need that desper that determination. We need that desperation. We need that determination. I like that the story of of a of the determination of the Shunomite woman with Elisha. She came to Elisha and said, "No, Elisha, I know you gave. First of all, I didn't even ask for this boy. I didn't ask for the child. But I she she had she saw a need for the prophet. She responded to the need. Amen. Sometimes brothers in India, God has needs as well. God has needs. Times only my needs. But God also has needs. And most the secret sometimes to our the to get the result to our needs is to supply to God's need. When you supply to God's need, your answer will be found in God's need without knowing. Sometimes you just do do it selfishly. Selfishness. I don't put it in English word. Self selfless. Selfish. You understand what I mean? Selfishly. Okay. You understand what I mean? So as you do it, God inside of it, God will answer to your need. As you supply to God need, God will answer to your need. Actually, it's one of the good service there and I was a little bit more emotion on that. But one but it was very good. So as she she as she as she gave that to the prophet I just want that room and then the prophet asked Elisha what is her need now? It's not her need. She has no children and prophet says that it will be given to her without even her asking. But because she supplied to the need of God and God supplied to her need and then she had that child. Amen. After many years and then another that child died then she had to come again back to the prophet came back to the prophet and prophet and she prophet will dramatize it and she it was not like everything was quiet and at home there was a tum husband crying and people coming to check and everything but she decided to go and meet the prophet. In other words, she goes to have a conference with God. type of having a conference with God. I'm going to go find a conference with God. Sometimes the problem where we have is when we have problem at home and everything, we stay at home with the problems. No, you need to go and find God, have conference with God. And when she came and have conference with God, she was determined to meet the prophet. The type meet God. And as she met God, the prophet asked them, "What is everything all right?" She says, "All is well. All is well. Even though through the trials, even though through difficult things, but all is well. How can you say all is well? Positive confession as we heard on Sunday. Positive confession because I'm in the presence of God. All is well. He knows the situation. He knows what I'm going through. And she came and asked the prophet, "This is what has happened. This is what happened in my family. This is what happened. I want you to come with me." And the prophet says, "No, you can go with my staff. You can go with my servant." said, "No, I can't rely on the staff. I can't rely on the ser. I want to you. I won't let you go unless you come with me." The same thing, the same attitude. We're coming to God. We are coming to you. You gave us the promise in the word of God. We are coming to you, Lord. We will not let you go unless you go with us. Lord, &gt;&gt; we are not leaving you in church. YOU ARE GOING WITH US, BROTHER. In our home, in our situation, IN OUR PROBLEMS THERE, GOD, YOU'LL GO WITH US. We are not leaving you in church but we go all the way with you. &gt;&gt; Determination when that omnipotent met the other omnipotent the blessings was there. &gt;&gt; Prophet says in he says I do think that there were talking about her that said the woman's faith wasn't in the staff it was in the prophet and I like her determination. She said, "As the Lord lives and your soul never dies, I'll not leave you." That was attitude. Then prophet, if we tonight could hold on God's representative like that, if we could tell the Holy Spirit tonight, as sure as you are, the immortal spirit of God, you give me a promise in the Bible of my healing, I'm going to hold on till I see something happen. So there will be miracles taking place. The prophet says the lame will be jumping and running. The doctors of Los Angeles will be surprised tomorrow to see the patient healed. And well, if we could just take a hold of God's agent. God's agent then was Elisha. God's agent today is the Holy Spirit. Hold on to it. When you have a come in contact and you feel the Holy Spirit on you, then hold on to it. I'll not leave you. stay with it like Jacob did when he wrestled with the angel. I'm not going I'm going to hold on till you bless me. Give me the thing that I'm desiring. See, would it be a wonderful would would it be a wonderful revival break out in Los Angeles temple and all up and down the coast here if the people that right here tonight and those that are listening on in the air will take that attitude towards the Holy Spirit tonight. I'm going to stay with you until I find out the things that I want to know. And Elisha seen that he had her on her hands. There was nothing else to go to do but to go with her. If you'll just stay with the Holy Spirit, stay on his hands. He He loved you. Listen to this. So, if you'll just stay with the Holy Spirit, stay on his hands. He loved you well enough to come to you and bless you and save you. Then stay on his hands. &gt;&gt; Don't let him go. Stay on his hands. Don't you remember Jesus teaching about the unjust judge? How he said, "I fear neither man nor man, but the woman torment me day and night crying after me." How much more will God give them the Holy Spirit to cry after him day and night? So stay on his hands. So we got faith to believe that God can do it and will do it. He let take a hold of it and hold on. Just don't let it go and stay right with it. Just don't let it let it go. Stay right with it. If it doesn't come now, it will come 10 minutes later, hour later, two weeks later, one month later, no matter when it comes, it's got a hold and I'm going to stay with it. &gt;&gt; That's what we are going to do in this prayer. Lord, we are staying with your promise. We are staying with your word. We are determined. God is determined to bless us. Remember Jacob, he already blessed before he was even born. So God is determined to bless us. Now it's our side now to be determined to receive the blessing of God. We are so determined. We are not giving up. We keep moving on. Amen. Oh God, I don't see today, but I stay with you, Lord. I will come and praising you. I'll come and testify about you. I will be SAYING ALL IS WELL BY GOD'S GRACE. I'm healed. I'm saved. I'm filled with the Holy Ghost. I HAVE A VICTORY VICTORIOUS LIFE. MY CHILDREN ARE SAVED. I'm healed. Oh God, whatever have need of I have need of a job. GOD WILL PROVIDE A JOB. WHATEVER IT IS NEED, WHATEVER IT IS, GOD IS IN CONTROL OF EVERY SITUATION. He's determined. Now let us be determined. &gt;&gt; Amen. Martha was in a situation a very very that's why I will read that quote of the tomb important she was in a very difficult situation she has been calling upon the Lord Jesus Christ your friend Lazarus he is very sick he's very sick and she's calling upon him she's calling upon him but the the more he heard about the calling the more he looked like he was going further and further and further she humanly speaking she could have been discouraged But this is the man we have been supporting. This is the one. But how come we all the reproach we we bore because of him. But how come in this time of distress is not coming to us. Why? Why? Humanly speaking many thoughts and and people criticizing our people and this is the church you go through. Look now your pastor is gone. He doesn't care. What what kind of man is that? Not even a little bit of compassion, many criticism. Just come back to our organization. We took care we have social thing many oppression upon her. But then finally on the other side, God was working something. Jesus already had the answer. He already knew that and he said this death is not going to bring to this this sickness is not going to bring unto death. means he already knew he already he already there was already one omnipotence on the one side is already there it was already the result God speaking way in the way of God it was already have a a positive result but on the other side God was working now with ma was making ma making m on the other side now she had to reach also the level of faith that she could meet the result that was already in God's hand now on the other side and then then the place where we can say now it's over because he died there's a lie now it's over and everything now now now it's just let try to handle situation humanly speaking and then he come the Lord Jesus Christ come he come in the darkest hours always comes in the darkest hours sometimes where we have lost every hope then he comes we thank God when he comes at his own appointed time but he will come every time you call him he will Amen. And he came and he came and now she comes to him. Oh master, if you had been here, our brother would have not died. If he had been here, he would have not died. But says the Lord, but he will be raised. He will be raised. And she thought it would be on the other time at the end of the days and the end of time. I know you are at the end of time. He say, I'm the life and the resurrection. Today I am the great I am. Is still the great I AM TODAY. IS THE PRESENT TIMES. Praise God. He's still here. He's still a high priest who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. He's real. He's not the God of the past. He's not always God of the future. He's the God of the present time. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW DARK THE situation is, he's still God. &gt;&gt; Present times read and you know the end result. Now the prophet is that's what he's reading. He says have been here my brother would have not died. and said even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you. That's the attitude. Even now uncertain about that. See that's when two positives meet. See that's when two omnipotent meet. When one omnipotent she had she had perfect omnipotent faith in Christ and Christ was omnipotent. See, she had perfect infinite faith in Christ that he was the Lord and knowing whatever he asked God, God will give it to him. In other words, she said if you just speak the word, that's all I have to do. Whatever you ask God, God will give it to you. Amen. Says that omnipotent all powerful because he just said so. Says all right, it was all powerful. says now when the TWO POWERS THE TWO OMNIPOTENT powers meet together it's a contact then amen something has to happen God has promised now ask let us come with that omnipotent faith just believing what God says and and and praying upon what God said amen says the contact then when a line here has got 150 volt this one got 150 volt When they come together, you got 150 volt both ways. Says, see, when you got supreme power, when Jesus said, "Lay hands on the sick, they shall recover." And you got supreme faith in that being the truth, you need a supreme God that make a supreme promise and a supreme result will come. I believe supreme result will come when our faith meets the supreme word of God. When we have supreme faith and we have THE SUPREME WORD OF GOD, IT WILL BRING supreme result. Despite the circumstances, despite the situations, despite how dark it is, it's still real. Amen. Now the message says when what happens when two omnipotent meet, when God and man comes together to omnipotent, something that got to shake whatever you'd said with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he has promised it. If God has promised and you come and pronounce it, amen says that creative power of omnipotence. God said he said it in his word, it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not. It makes them as though they are because two omnipotent has met. Remember that Sir Phoenician woman as she was there and she came and she had a lot of struggles, a lot of hindrances, a lot of obstacles, but she was trying to meet the omnipotent one. She had the omnipotent faith, she had to meet the omnipotent God. Amen. And then when she met the omnipotent God, despite the struggle, despite the despite the the hindrances, despite the obstacles, the omnipotent God says, "Let it be done to you according to thy faith." because of thy saying, because of thy confession, because of saying the creative power of God. God, I even want even the crumbs, I just want that. If you the crumbs you have for me, I will go for the crumbs, Lord. Even you call me call me dog. Oh Lord, I accept THAT. WHATEVER THE WORD OF GOD SAYS, I accept it. But I just accept your word and I'm coming because I want to meet the omnipotent. And the omnipotent gave her the desire of her heart. How many want to meet the important this night? Lord, I want more. I want more. I want more. I want more. Elisha that he had the same attitude. Elisha, Lord, God, I desire the I desire the double portion. &gt;&gt; The prophet says it's actually a hard things to ask. It's a very hard things to ask. Then prophet put comments on. Don't be scared of asking God hard things. He actually likes to be asked the hard things. It means you trust in his omnipotence power that he can do the hard things humanly speaking. When it look like impossible, ask those hard things. God is more than able to perform that and give you the desire of your heart. Amen. Praise be to God. Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Thank God for your grace and mercy. That's the attitude we are going to have. Lord, Sister Wendy's coming. Prophet says in prayer, if there is those here tonight who are not saved, may they hold on until the saving grace of God has received them. If they are here without the baptism of the Holy Spirit, may they be like that little woman, let not time or anything else that stand in the way. They will hold. They will hold and be perseverant until the spirit fills their life with the grace of God. If they are sick, may they not let loose. May they hold like Jacob, how perseverant he was. He held on and said, "I'll not let you go until you bless me." That blessing meant life to him. So does it mean to us tonight. Healing means healing means life to us, Lord. We pray that your presence will come and will be able to get a hold of you and get a hold of us like you did for Jacob. that rest. I will not let you go until you bless me. Amen. All is well. All is well. The message needs raise your hand to address the need. All is well. All is well. For we have heard the message shalom. All is well. Oh, there is a place of perfect rest behind the end. rest of all is well. &gt;&gt; One more time. All is well. All is well. All is well. All is well. Oh, we shalom is shalom to the bride. Shalom to the elect. There is a place &gt;&gt; behind the rest. Is there any that you like to express it publicly? Certainly a need stress nervous stress. Praise God. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. Thank you very much. Praise be to God. Praise be to God. God is still praise the Lord. Just remember those needs and just pray them and if we didn't we don't finish pray all of them when we go home just remember the sister remember the brother family and we continue that because we are not going to leave the Holy Ghost we're not going to leave the angel until let's pray together just one individually I need Jesus.
