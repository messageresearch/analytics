[Music] I once was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I see. [Music] It was grace that taught my heart to fear. and grace my fears relief. How precious did that grace appear. The hour I first believe. My chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my Savior, yours ransom me. And like a flood, his mercy rain, unending love, amazing grace. The Lord has promised good to me. His word, my hope secure. He will my shield and portion be as long as life endure. My chains are gone. [Music] I've been set free. My God, my Savior, yours ransom me.

Amen. verse four here it says his word my hope secures that's in my mind that's the God's word is always fulfilling itself and that's the portion of faith that he's he's given us his word is what secures our hope and our faith and um uh maybe it's a little bit off topic but years ago I had an NLT Bible and uh when it talks about uh the when the came out of Israel and it had the plagues. It the Bible said just had God had predicted. And immediately I stopped using that Bible because God's word is not a prediction. It's not open-ended for failure. It's not like, oh, I think this might happen. I think this might not. No, he like every other Bible in existence said as God had said. And uh maybe if I ruined that for you, I'm sorry, but I yeah, that's the Bible I I I don't want to use because if there's one misinterpretation like that, that makes all of God's word fallable and his word is infallible. Maybe he'll stand with me. Let's sing. I'll cherish the old rugged cross. [Music] On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, the emblem of suffering and shame. And I love that old cross where the dearest and best for a world of sinner was slain. And we'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down. And I'll cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it someday for a crown. Oh, the old cross by the world has a wous attraction. [Music] Yeah, let's try the old rugged cross [Music] till my trophies at last I lay down. [Music] And I'll cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it someday for a crown. [Music] The old rugged cross. There we go. With blood so divine. How wonderous of beauty I see. For was thou cr cross Jesus suffered and died to pardon and sanify me. Oh, I'll cling to the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down. I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it someday for a crown. To that old rugged cross I will ever be true. It shame and reproach gladly bear. Then he'll call me someday to my home far away where his glory shall ever all share. So I'll cling to the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down. And I'll cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it someday for a crown. Amen. There's a couple of prayer requests still for uh sister Agnes Kazadi and it says there's a series of prayer requests for uh sister Duo, but I don't know if we know that request, but we'll just hold up before the Lord and also for brother Moses as he's traveling and and just where the world is where there's wars and in East Congo and and just in the Philippines there's flooding and just all over. So, If we can ask brother Joseph if he could come and take these needs before the Lord [Music] cross [Music] the glass I lay down. I will cling to the old ragged cross and exchange it someday for a crown. Amen. God bless you saints. Let's go to the Lord in prayer this morning. Dear heavenly father, we thank you for making it possible that we be here today. We thank you for yet another chance, Lord, to commune with you this morning. We just want to appreciate your presence, Lord, for bringing your children back in the in your house together again, Lord. Brothers and sisters of like faith, Lord, knowing that without you, nothing is possible. Father, we we love you. We appreciate all the things that you have done for us physically and in our spirit, Lord. But above all, we thank you for the promise on of Calvary, Lord, the one that we are clinging on to even today, Father. Lord God, you have heard of all those uh prayer requests, Lord, spoken prayer requests, but Lord, there's also more prayer requests and thanksgiving and also amongst us this morning. We want to ask that you deal with each one of those, Lord, as you see fit. Father, we thank you this morning for you have made it possible for your children to remember that it's your day, Lord, and you we have to be here to worship you. We thank you for the songs of praise that have been sung, Lord, and ask that you continue to bless us and prepare our hearts as we continue singing. Lord, bless the musicians.

But we ask that you make make bring the word and make that word life to us. Lord we thank you father. May you be with brother Moses as he's traveling. Give him grace so whatever he does over there may be to your glory Lord. Father, we thank you for your your people who are just so honest and they come unto you, Lord. But it's only because you gave them your faith and your love that they can express it to the world. We thank you, Lord. We love you. We honor you. May you be with this service from beginning to end. In Jesus Christ's name I pray. Amen. You can greet yourselves as you find your seats. [Music] The judge my way. It looks like you're guilty. Now what do you say? I spoke out your honor. I have no defense. But that's when mercy walked in. Oh, mercy walked in and pleaded at my case. Called to the stand. God's saving grace. The blood was presented that covered my sins. Forgiven when mercy walked in. I stood there in wonder. How could this be that someone so guilty has just been set free? My chains were broken. I felt born again the moment that mercy walked in. Oh mercy walked in and pleaded my case. Called to the stand. God's saving grace. The blood was presented that covered my sins. forgiven. When mercy walked in, I stood there in wonder. How could this be that someone so guilty had just been set free? My chains were broken. I felt born again. The moment that mercy walked in, oh mercy walked in and pleaded my case. called to the step. God's saving grace. The blood was presented that covered my sins forgiven when mercy walked in. Oh mercy walked in and pleaded in my case called to the dead. God's saving grace. The blood was presented that covered my sins. [Music] forgiven when mercy walking. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mercy. Uh recently I was just thinking about uh I guess like atonement in the Bible and how we like before Christ came there was a a constant search for atonement. So you had to constantly be uh finding a lamp constantly having to do all those things and and not because you wanted to but because you had to because your your desires were never changed. So the only resolution was a constant atonement and and Christ gave an atonement but not to Not just for the atonement is to change why we needed an atonement and yeah just yeah mercy re r rewrote our life. So change the the tempo a little bit. Um are you washed by the water? Maybe his brothers would come. Do you know what it is not to have one guilty feeling nor to wonder where you're going when you die. Not condemned of the past. Not afraid of what tomorrow holds in store and know the reason why. Yes, that's just how it is. You go down in the water for my faith. You believe in what you heard. It's no impossible dream. You can start over clean. When you're washed by the water of the word, are you washed? Yes, I'm washed by the water. Washed by the water of the word. Are you washed by the water? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Washed by the water of the word. It's like being born again with a whole new life to live. Never having to look back to what you did. Cuz according to the Lord, you've just started your existence. And where he's concerned, there was no sin. Praise the Lord for that. &gt;&gt; For when God looks your way, he no longer sees a saint who's been washed white as snow. It's not by anything we've done, but by the blood of God's own son. &gt;&gt; Are you washed by the water of the word? &gt;&gt; Are you Are you by the water? &gt;&gt; Washed by the water of the word. Are you washed by the water? [Music] Washed by the water of the word. Yes, I'm washed. &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm washed by the water. Washed by the water of the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm washed. &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm washed by the water. are washed by the water of the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you happy this morning that you're washed by the water of the word? &gt;&gt; Mercy came along. You know, is that wonderful? That was a wonderful song. Mercy is our Lord Jesus Christ. He came in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ. And this morning we want to adore him. &gt;&gt; We want to praise him.

We're serving a risen Christ, a living God, and we want to welcome him. Let's welcome our Lord Jesus this morning. What shall we? Amen. Shall we give him a good applause?

I think brother Kim Dingall used to sing, "I'm hungry, Lord, feed me." I can't sing it myself, but you know, we need to be fed, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to nourish our faith. Brother has been speaking on faith. We've got to nourish our faith. We can't add to our faith. You can't add a stature to you to yourself. You can't add If I could, I'd put some hair on my head, but I cannot add anything. But we can nurture our faith. Feed on the word of God. And that's what we want to do here this morning. Feed on the word. Be silent. Be at rest. Amen. Because the Lord Jesus said, "Come unto me all ye that are that are labor labor and are heavy.

Glory Christ the Lord for he alone is worthy for he alone is worthy for he alone is worthy Christ the Lord. Amen. Before our brother Gilbert comes, we do want to all remember. I know I had it read over the pulpit, but you know, we got to remember our sister Odiva. She is in serious need. She's got something on her head. And the doctors are just examining her. We got to say, Lord Jesus, you're still the healer. &gt;&gt; We've got to carry our brother and sister's burdens. &gt;&gt; So, let's just focus on our I mean I I believe brother is also affected by this because whenever my wife is sick I'm dearly my I'm so broken down I hardly taken. Amen. So I know how it is. Let's just remember them in prayer. Father in heaven, I know they're not here this morning for some reason or other, but she phoned and I prayed over to over her by phone. But Lord, we are gathered gathered together here this morning as a group of people, Lord Jesus. And I believe that you hear our prayer. Not only hear our prayer, but Lord, you answer our prayer. And we bring our sister Odiva before you in the name of Jesus. May every thing that she has Lord I believe it's not malignant but Lord Jesus it's something on her in her head on her head Lord affecting her petitionary gland. I can't even say it properly but Lord Jesus would you undertake for her this morning oh God in the name of Jesus everyone that's sick here this morning. Oh God, would you go near them, Lord, and oh, touch their their bodies in the name of Jesus. Everyone that has pain, Lord. Oh God, there's different ones that have pain, Lord. Every day, Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus, that you would undertake for them. We believe that you're a Jehovah Rafa. So this morning, we want to focus on your word. I pray, oh God, that you would anoint our brother, Lord, to speak as the oracles of God. May he have liberty to declare to us the word of God that which we we need to hear this morning. Oh God, we don't need a whole lot of knowledge. We've already got it. But Lord, we need a revelation of what we need this morning. Oh God, we need to get right with God. We got to get on fervent with God. Oh God, we lay it all to you this morning. Bless our brother and give him the anointing and the spirit of the living God.

I greet you this morning in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Are you expecting? &gt;&gt; But don't expect too much because you might be disappointed. But pray for me. &gt;&gt; I also bring you greetings from the saints in Lethbridge. And uh my wife, I didn't come with her. She's in she's in Africa for vacation. But I caught an old friend who said that uh he can give me company. So I came with my precious friend Dea Panini. &gt;&gt; So I'm happy to be my in my second church. I just love you brethren. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh whenever I go on my knees to pray, I pray for this f for this fellowship. You are so dear to me. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; because this is the place where I just preach my heart out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't leave anything. I just say it the way it comes. And uh I pray that uh I pray that this morning I'll be a blessing to somebody. &gt;&gt; So without wasting much time, I ask that we turn to our Bibles. Thank you musicians. We will turn to St. Luke chapter 15. St. Luke chapter 15. If you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's pray before we read. Our dear most precious heavenly father, in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we call unto you once again, Father, because you told us to call and you will answer. &gt;&gt; You are not a man that you can lie. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus Christ, we know your ears are always open unto the cries of your children. May you hear our humble cry this morning. We have come, Father. Your children have prayed. They have come expecting to hear from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, just take me out of the way so that you come and speak to your children yourself. Let me not be a hindrance, Father, for them to hear what thou has purposed for them to hear this morning. Lord Jesus, now as we go to read your word, we ask for your blessings upon it, Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. I shall say that God has given me a good voice. &gt;&gt; I can I can preach without these things but anyway they have to be used. So if you are there let's let's start reading from verse 11. St. Luke 15 from verse 11. And he said a certain man had two sons. And the young of them said to his father, "Father, give me the portion of goods that fleth to me." And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after the young son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living. And when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that in that land and he began to be in one. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country. And he sent him into his fields to feed swine. and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat, and no man gave unto him. And when he came to himself, he said, "How many hired servants of my fathers have prayed enough and to spare, and I perish with a hunger?" Because of time, let's let's go to verse 21. And the son said unto him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son." But the father said to his servants, "Bring forth the best robe, &gt;&gt; put it on him. Put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet, and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and be merry." God bless the reading of the word. You can have your seats. Amen. For some time we've been talking about adoption and uh for those who have been following preach services please don't say why is he repeating himself. No, it's for the sake of somebody who has not heard what is going on. So I pray that uh this morning I trust that I'll be a blessing to somebody. Now for the sake of those who don't know what we have been going through, I'll just try to background it before we come to our subject today. The subject today I've called it the symbols of adoption. Yeah, we will come to it. Now, adoption, we have been saying the English word for the the English meaning for adoption is taking somebody that is not yours and you make him or her yours. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So far so good. But according to the word, adoption means bringing back that one which was yours. &gt;&gt; It must have been yours in the first place. So you bring the person back to yourself to the family. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now the story that we have read about the prodical son many at times this story is used to maybe somebody backlid and went away from the church. So we go to the person telling him or her the story of the prodical son thinking that bringing the person back to the church is bringing the person home. No. &gt;&gt; I hope you get me right. &gt;&gt; Somebody can come back to church but is not in the home. So we want to differentiate between the home and the church. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now this this young man he went to his father and said give me the portion of my inheritance. And he was given and he went away. While he was away, life became so difficult for him until he remembered that how many hired servants at home are eating bread and it remains and here I'm hungry. You can imagine how he was struggling with with with the swines. Yeah. You can imagine how they struggled to eat and there you are also. It must have been a very big struggle. But he remembered back home. Now the question is who is the protoan today? The prophet says I don't have time much time to read all the quotes but uh we will see who is the protocol son today. The prophet says we are the prodical sons. Now if we are the prodical sons then where is our home? Our home is where we came from &gt;&gt; and we left our home and came into a far country. Now in that far country we are eating with pigs. &gt;&gt; We are living riotous lives. God help us. &gt;&gt; Now please mark this scripture. We will repeat it over and over until it sings in our hearts. Verse 21, the Bible says, "And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son." &gt;&gt; Oh my God have us. Now, here is the son. Verse 17 says, "When he came to himself, then he remembered home." Many things we do is because we are not ourselves. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. Many things we do is because we are not ourselves. &gt;&gt; But when you come to yourself, &gt;&gt; you will not do the things that you are doing. when you come to yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now when he came to himself then he remembered home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now look at this scenario here. He stands before his father and says I have sinned against heaven. I have sinned against you. I'm not worthy to be called your son. Just make me one of your hired servants. and the relationship of the father and the son because this son came from the loins of the father because of that relationship he did not respond to that request. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The father could not understand how he can make his son a hired servant. God help us. &gt;&gt; The father could not understand and he could not grant that request. May God help us. Instead, he started speaking to his servants. Now verse 22. But the father said to to his servants, "Bring forth the best rope. &gt;&gt; Put it on him &gt;&gt; and put a ring on his hand &gt;&gt; and shoes on his feet. &gt;&gt; Bring the best rope." The best rope used to be spared for adoption. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Not just a rope, but the best rope spared, reserved for adoption purpose. &gt;&gt; But now here is our case. A son comes in tattered clothes and yet the father starts the process of adoption. That is amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is amazing grace. &gt;&gt; That is amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even in the the way I am with clothes torn everywhere I my nakedness is seen everywhere &gt;&gt; and yet the father starts the process of adoption. &gt;&gt; That is amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Some said if you preach this kind of sermon people will start leaving anyhow. No &gt;&gt; sir. If you can realize where you came from. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just give me time when we when we come to see the life of the prodical son and what it means to us then you will realize &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the symbols of adoption one the best rope two a ring, &gt;&gt; three shoes. &gt;&gt; If you can have those three, then we can declare this morning that you are ready for adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay. No. Okay. In the message adoption part three paragraph 160 the prophet says now let us read then we will have to stop cause our time getting away. All right in the 10th verse. Okay. All right. In the 10th verse or ninth verse, having made known to us the mystery of his will. What is the mystery of his will? The mystery of his will is adoption. Let me explain it. We had the elder son who remained in the home. As far as good living was concerned, actually he's the one who deserved to be adopted. Yeah. He met all the qualifications for adoption. As far as the living good is concerned, he met all the qualifications for adoption. But here one comes first of all he went away and the reason for going he went to live a riot's life and they had evidences of how he was living. Now here he comes and the father who is rich in mercy and full of love for his son &gt;&gt; he starts the process of adoption. Amen. &gt;&gt; For undeserving person that is amazing grace. &gt;&gt; So the mystery of his will is adoption. &gt;&gt; It's a mystery. Oh my. Okay. Now where is our home? And who is the proto is where we came from. Now how did we come? I've always read this one over and over but for the sake that for the sake of those that we are meeting for the first time I don't mind. I'll just try to explain it. We were in the minds of God as a thought as thoughts. Now being in the mind of God, the prophet says God had three main purposes that he wanted to to achieve. One, he wanted to reveal himself. Two, he wanted to have preeminence in the body of believers. Then three, he restores back to Eden. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. That Eden just being re returned back to Eden. Yeah. Is not where now Adam and Eve were enjoying the trees and the the animals and everything. No being where you are in the mind of God. Hello. Where you are in the mind of God. Let me explain it. When Adam was naming the animals and everything. Yeah. When God came, he never corrected him. &gt;&gt; Why? He had the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that is where God wants us to reach. &gt;&gt; That is our home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where you have the mind of God. And Paul tells us that we are now seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Not around Jesus Christ, but inside Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I always say this, the problem is not in the message. The problem is around the message. Those people who have come around the message, they are the ones causing the problems. But inside the inside the message and you have found your place positionally, you know where you are standing. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Life is so sweet. &gt;&gt; Oh my God help us now. My refus to open but uh anyway we'll get there. Okay. Uh 650221E. Who is this Mercede? 650221E paragraph 52. Okay. Now we find him at the beginning his attributes. Now you were with him then. Then is when the book of life comes into view. Now we read over here in Revelation the 13th chapter the 8th verse that the peace that comes upon the earth in these last days will deceive all those people on the earth whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. Think of it. Before Jesus was ever born, 4,000 years before he came on earth, and several thousand years before you come on earth, Jesus in God's mind died for the sins of the world. And the book of life was made and your name was put on that book of life before the foundation of the world. That is the Bible truth. See your name was ordained of God and placed on the book of life before the foundation of the world. You were there in his attributes. &gt;&gt; So when we talk about your home is the park there in his attributes. &gt;&gt; Now if you can trace your lineage and say oh I was there I am here because I was there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Once you come to realize that you are here because you are there, once you catch that revelation. Oh yes. Then you can know why when the son came and asked the father to be met a servant, the father could not answer that &gt;&gt; because the father could trace and say this is my son. This is my son. How can he be a servant? servants never used to wear shoes and that's why he didn't have shoes and the father asked the servants give him shoes. We will see what shoes means. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Just as you are a part of your earthly father. That is right. You are. The male carries the homogloin the blood. And when that has gone in in the egg then you become a part of your father and your mother is a part of your father also. So you are all part of your father. Glory that lets the denomination out all together certainly does God in all the only place. Notice now his attribute. Now you are his attribute. You are here because you are in him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are here because of your name was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; We will see it. Your name in the book of life is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Me go ahead of my sermon. Prophet says, "Oh, brother Ne, somebody has to give you something. Somebody has to give you an inheritance." &gt;&gt; Now, what is an inheritance? Your name in the Lamb's Book of Life is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can mess up with your blessings. &gt;&gt; Hello That's right. &gt;&gt; Please preach with me. &gt;&gt; You can mess up with your blessings, but your inheritance, nobody can temper with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why when this son he asked the father, give me what belongs to me. and he was given and he went and he squandered everything. He came back empty-handed but still his inheritance was there. Why was the father why did the father start started the process of adoption? So that the son can now have his inheritance. You are inheritance. God help us. God help us. Your inheritance. Nobody can temper with your inheritance. If we can come to that point where we can realize who we are, what God has made us. Yeah. What has been revealed to us that we were in him? &gt;&gt; Your life has been in his hands. &gt;&gt; He has been murdering your life. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; You are living a riotous life but your life was in his hands. &gt;&gt; If we can come to ourselves, if God can help us to come to ourselves and know who we are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No wonder the prophet says when the church will know who she is, the rapture will take place. &gt;&gt; So the reason the reason why the rapture is not taking place is because of the spiritual ammunia. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. You can temper with your inheritance. You can temper with your blessings but not your inheritance. Your inheritance is packed. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is a charm of life. Now that charm of life in you, Lord help us. That jam of life in you can be sitting there doand. Yeah. Oh, I am a sinner. I've messed up my life. No, no. That is a strange language. Yeah. But what excites that jump of life? &gt;&gt; When you hear the word, &gt;&gt; it excites you. You can't sit. You said hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? The charm of life is responding to the call by the father. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; The prophet says that young boy, wherever he was, it was an angel that went and spoke to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What if you just go back home? &gt;&gt; Yeah. What if you just go back home? [Music] Yeah. Oh, that angel might be speaking to somebody this morning. Yeah. Yeah. Then he came to himself and he started the journey going on. While he was still a far off, the father saw him. &gt;&gt; While you are still a far off, the father sees you. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And he comes. What happened? He gave him a kiss. &gt;&gt; A hug and a kiss. &gt;&gt; The prophet says a kiss was justification. Oh my. In the condition that he was in and he's justified. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; According to the father, according to the father, the one who went away, the one who was living a riot's life, the one who was living, who was eating with pigs was not himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. was not himself. But when he came to himself, &gt;&gt; he started going back home. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Now, [Music] oh my God help us. Now we belong to a family &gt;&gt; and that family has a name. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; The name is Jesus. We belong to a family. &gt;&gt; A family of God. those old days. Uh nowadays, technology has spoiled everything. We used to have the album. Yeah. You keep the photos. This one I took it 1952. [Laughter] Yeah. And that album in most cases it has the pictures for the family members. [Laughter] When a visitor comes in the house, the first thing you you give the you want to introduce the family &gt;&gt; members. Oh, God wants to introduce his family members. &gt;&gt; Oh my. This one is mine. &gt;&gt; This one is mine. I knew him. &gt;&gt; I knew him. Now there was the thief on the cross. There were two. Now one I I think I preached this one here. Yeah. Where we showed the picture. The site that Jesus Christ was looking on the right was where that thief who remember me. Yeah. And we also showed the me the the picture of the pro the prophet is also looking right the right side. Do you do you see the connection? &gt;&gt; Yeah. The right side. That is amazing grace. Yeah. Now the thief on the right side, he had his representation in the book of life. By condemning him on the cross, it brought him to Jesus. Now his inheritance was still there. It only needed an opportunity. Now when he looked at Jesus Christ talking to the other thief and the other thief was talking nonsense, this one said, "Oh Lord, remember me." &gt;&gt; When he said remember me, Jesus Christ said, "Tonight not tomorrow, tonight &gt;&gt; you will be with me." &gt;&gt; Why? Because of his inheritance, &gt;&gt; his representation. Now we are talking about your representation the charm of life. &gt;&gt; It is only the charm of life that is related to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Now let's talk about when he came to himself in the court of law. When somebody's condemned, maybe he murdered or he did any crime that you can talk of, when this person is brought before the church, a good learned friend will say, "Before anything else, let this guy be tested and see if he was in the right sense. Yeah. Now if he's tested and found that he was not in the right mind, the judge would say then I'm helpless because he was not himself. Hello. &gt;&gt; He was helpless. The church would say I'm helpless because he was not in the right mind. He was not himself. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Then they brought concern brought before the father. The father says he was not himself. &gt;&gt; He was not himself. So whatever he was doing, he was not himself. May God have mercy on us. But when it comes to us, &gt;&gt; I know Joseph. I know what he did. I know him. Even the whole church knows him. Not the father. &gt;&gt; The father looks at a different picture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He looks at himself. You are in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So whatever you are doing, you are not yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when you come to yourself, you will not do those things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we are asking you, may God open your eyes so that you can come to yourself. &gt;&gt; Because when you come to yourself, you will stop doing whatever you are doing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You will run to the father. This young this young man he knew his father. Can you search for me a guide? A guide. Paragraph 35. Let's see something there. I love it. Paragraph 35. Okay. And the Holy Spirit always speaks of the word. I've got many things to tell you. You cannot understand it now. But when he comes, he will guide you to it. That is the reason the coming of the seals. At the finishing of the seventh seal, the mystery of God should be finished. to know who God is, what he is, how he lives, his nature, his being. You are supposed to be all the way up here by that time. Now, the coming of the seals is to make you know who your father is. &gt;&gt; Hello. Now this young man he knew his father as a forgiving father and that's why he said let me go back home to my father. &gt;&gt; Do we know our father? &gt;&gt; My God help us. &gt;&gt; Do we know him as a condemning father or as a forgiving father? If if he forame the thief on the cross, &gt;&gt; no matter how far you have gone, &gt;&gt; no matter where you are, &gt;&gt; you might be so low until you cannot even pray. &gt;&gt; Remember, &gt;&gt; remember what help us? Am I communicating? No matter where you are. &gt;&gt; Just come to yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. No matter the condition. &gt;&gt; Our father is a forgiving father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's so forgiving. &gt;&gt; Look at the characters in the Bible. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Are they good characters? [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah. May God help us. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To know our father. And the purpose of the coming of the se of the seals was to make us know who God is, who our father is. &gt;&gt; To know his nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is his nature, how he lives, what he likes and what he doesn't like. &gt;&gt; Do we know our father? &gt;&gt; Do we know our father? &gt;&gt; Can we copy for our father? Oh yes. Is he a forgiving father? &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; Even in your tattered clothes, &gt;&gt; he can still give you a hug. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Me? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Not me. I'm just too low. I'm too far. &gt;&gt; I don't think so. He sends an angel. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To speak to your heart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, how do you know that you are in him? &gt;&gt; How do you know that you are in him? He flashes the word before you. &gt;&gt; When the word is flashed before you, &gt;&gt; how is your reaction? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother say, how is your reaction? Yeah. The way you react to the word &gt;&gt; Yeah. shows that you were there. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Shows that you are there. &gt;&gt; It is that charm of life that is telling you that is right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you may not have reached that level. You may not have reached there, but right deep in your heart that jump of life is telling you, Lord, help me. I want more of that. I want more of that. Let me grow higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That charm of life. &gt;&gt; So the way you react to the word &gt;&gt; shows whether you are there &gt;&gt; or you are not there. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are there, you can't help yourself. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Getting excited &gt;&gt; by hearing when this word is being preached, when the truth is presented before you. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can't help yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, how is your reaction? How is your reaction? How do you know your name was there? How do you receive the word &gt;&gt; today? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. Now all those things that he did had nothing to do with his adoption. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now by the way so many sons were being adopted in those days. Are they written in the Bible? &gt;&gt; No sir. Why are they not written? But the story of the prodical son is written because of the special character. &gt;&gt; One of the character is for him to come to himself. &gt;&gt; God help us. Oh my. Okay. Amen. Now when you are born in this world, you acquired another nature. But that nature, it only suppressed the charm of life that God had put in you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll explain it. That charm of life that is God's representation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But when you are born, you acquired the nature of the world. And that's why there is no school in the whole world where they train children to tell lies. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's the nature that you acquired. Yeah. But because of that jam of life that was deposited in you by God himself, please, please, please, I beg you, let's follow this. It will help you to stand &gt;&gt; in the times of the storms. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When the storms comes, if you know your relationship with the father, &gt;&gt; nothing will nothing will temper with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we can come to that realization of our relationship with our father, &gt;&gt; that is all that I'm preaching. &gt;&gt; My God. Knowing our relationship with the father, the father's relationship that made the young man when he came before him and said just make me one of the hired servants. &gt;&gt; The father could not respond to that. &gt;&gt; God help us. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Let's look at the elder son. Let's read it. I I think I I'm better off to just read it. Hh. Okay. Let's continue with our story. Okay. Verse 25. Okay. Verse 24. The the love of God. For this my son was dead and is alive again. He was lost and is found. And they began to marry. Yeah. Now the father instructing the servants put on him the best rope. What is the best rope? We explained it earlier on. Now look at the story of Elijah and Elisha. Yeah. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Elisha walked with Elijah and he came to a point said no I need this gift. So he asked Elijah give me. Then Elijah told him okay fine. If you see me when I go &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; then you will receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the challenge was for him to see Elijah going. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [Laughter] Oh, just remain here for 5 minutes. I'm coming. No, you can't leave me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; How does it imply to us? Let us read the message. &gt;&gt; Let us listen to the word. &gt;&gt; You cannot leave the word for a minute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, just remain here. No, no, no, no, no. You can't leave me. He had to make sure following the prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Following Elijah, following Elijah. And we are living in the days of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the time came when Elijah was going, his mandle had to be dropped. &gt;&gt; Now that was specifically meant for Elijah. Now if Elijah was f like me. Yeah. He had to work on his body to feed in that garment. [Laughter] How do you work on yourself? &gt;&gt; The more you eat the word, the more you expel the world from you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Until you fit in that comment. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that comment, the prophet calls it a secondhanded rope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when Elijah came to River Jordan, &gt;&gt; he had the comment. Yes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; But then he said, "Where is the God of Elijah?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is the God of Elijah? Why? Because that was a secondhanded rope. I don't have time to read all those quotes. But the prophet says it was a secondhanded rope, but we need a fresh rope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Directly specifically made for you and you alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That rope has power had the power of Elijah. The power of God in Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why he asked, "Oh, where is the court of Elijah?" When he asked for the court of Elijah, the water parted. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that comment, let me read it. Oh yes. God help us. That rope 54304 54304 paragraph 36. Okay, we are almost. One time Jesus was asked, "Let my son sit on your right, on your right and left hand in the kingdom." He said, "Can you drink the cup that I drink?" She said, "Yes." Say, "Can you be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?" Said, "Yes." Say, "You can, but the right and the left hand is not mine." So the baptism of the Holy Spirit was upon Christ when he was taken up on the day of Pentecost. 120 people went in the upper room up there with their eyes straight towards heaven watching. And when he threw that rope of the Holy Ghost back down there. &gt;&gt; So what is that rope? The Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the rope is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And that's why I said if you have the three elements of adoption, then you are a candidate. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now Jesus Christ. Okay. Can you let's also go to 580324. 580324 paragraph 105. Paragraph 105. Thank you for your service today. Okay. Paragraph 105. Okay. 58 0324. Yes. 105. The prophet says that robe that God put on Jesus Christ on Mount Transfiguration was the rope of immortality. &gt;&gt; Do you see now the importance of the rope? &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Because of time, let's let's just go ahead. Okay. Now, how do you know that your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life? How you respond? Hello. &gt;&gt; How you respond when the word is flashed before you. When the word is flashed before you and you see your name. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Revelation chapter 5. And I saw the right hand of him that sat on the throne, a book written within, and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth was able to open the book, neither to look there on. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look there on. And one of the elders saith unto me, weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four peace, and in the midst of the elders, stood a lamb, as it had been slain, having seven thorns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the book and the four piece and four four and 20 elders fell down before the lamp having everyone every one of them hs and called in vials full of odas which are the prayers of the saints and they sang a new song. &gt;&gt; Okay, because of time and John heard let's read it. Okay. Uh verse 11. And I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders. And the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the lamp that was lain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings. And every creature, verse 13, and every creature which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, had I saying, "Blessed and honor, and glory, and power be unto him that siteth upon the throne." Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When John saw his name, &gt;&gt; come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. Shake yourself. &gt;&gt; When John saw his name, &gt;&gt; he said, "All the creatures in heaven, &gt;&gt; on earth, under the earth, in the sea, they heard him." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; And some of us up to now, we have not even said amen. &gt;&gt; Are you John? Have you seen your name? &gt;&gt; Have you seen your name? &gt;&gt; Your name is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Your name is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; How can you see your inheritance? And you just sit there. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; God help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; When John saw his name, &gt;&gt; pastor, when you saw your name, &gt;&gt; when you see your name, you cannot you can't help yourself, &gt;&gt; you cannot. When you see your name, &gt;&gt; now we are here to dress our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Now we say the book, your name in the book of life is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; So that's what we are following up. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your name in the book of life is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; So when you see your name, you can't help yourself like John to say glory and honor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; I'm sure if he was seated close to a neighbor Yeah. he must have shouted until the neighbor said, "What is wrong with this guy? What was wrong? He had seen his name &gt;&gt; and that name is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; That name is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Have you seen your name? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you seen your name? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can we behave like people who have seen our names? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People who have seen their names. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; You are so special. You are so special. Look at the proc. Look at the prodical son. Help me to get uh Okay. The message the protocol paragraph 170. Okay. 508.7 A Paragraph 170. I know there are those ones who are praying that I finish but I can't finish without proving this point. &gt;&gt; The prophet says he was the prodical son. Yeah. I want that that quote to come. That's why I said we are the prodical sons. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the prophet said he was the prodical son. &gt;&gt; Now, if the prophet said he was, he says he was the prodical son, then who are we? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, if we are the prodical sons, then we need to come to ourselves. It is 50827 A. Okay. Paragraph 170. The prophet says, "I remember when I was lost and undone out in the world dying, a sinner laying on a hospital bed. The doctor said I had just a few moments to live. But I cried coming down to the road. And as I cried, I ran to meet the heavenly father." The prodical son, the father saw him a far off &gt;&gt; and he came. It is the father looking for you. When the prodical son was eating with with swine and everything, yeah, it was the father who caused the situation. Let me explain it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah, a situation can come that will make you remember you have a father. &gt;&gt; Yeah, a situation will come that will make you remember you have a father. &gt;&gt; So that situation that caused the the prodical son to remember it was a phone call &gt;&gt; looking for him. Hey, where are you? Oh, I'm here. I'm here. Oh, life is hard here. I'm eating with the swine. And by the way, the Jews, the lowest life that one ever went was to mingle with pigs. &gt;&gt; That was the worst position one can go. So now you can imagine how psyritten he was. &gt;&gt; But God sends an angel &gt;&gt; to him and say, "Would you mind going back to your father? God help us." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let us be an angel to somebody. May God help us to be an angel to somebody. But instead of being an angel to somebody, yeah, we have this idea of &gt;&gt; Oh, I can't sit close to Joseph. He's a sinner. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; we know he's alive. No wonder you are seated alone. Sorry. He's my friend. Yeah. I'm I'm trying to explain something. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now look at the prodical son. The elder son. I'm just about to close. The elder son. Okay, let's continue. Now his elder son was in the field, and as he came and a true nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the servants, and asked, "What these things meant?" And he said unto him, "Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf." Because he hath received him safe and sound. And he was angry, and would not go in. Look at this brother. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he was angry and he could not go in. Hello, &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Oh, and he was angry and would not go in. Therefore came his father out. Can you imagine this scenario? How angry he was? Do you know sometimes we get angry we don't want even to go to church. &gt;&gt; You are so angry with a brother and you even don't want to see him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Put your character now to the character of the elder son. &gt;&gt; He was so angry that he could not go in. It was the father who came out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's see now. Let's let's let's look at it. Yeah. And okay. Therefore came his father out and entreated him. And he answering said to his father, "Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I any time thine commandment, and yet thou never kest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends. God help us. But as soon as thy son was come which hath devoured thy living thy living with hallows, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. It was meat that we should make merry and be glad for this thy brother was dead and is alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This one is complaining what have you done for this one? But because of the father, the father's love, he says he was dead and is alive and now that he has come back alive, let us marry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's look at the fatted calf. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it was the fatted calf that was picked. Now when God visited Abraham, Abraham killed the fatted calf. &gt;&gt; So the fatted calf are for gods. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So now you can see the character of the protein. The fatted calves are for gods. Yeah. When God visit Abraham, Abraham killed the fatted calf. So it is made for God. Hello. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Do do we see the point? &gt;&gt; So this prodical son had a special character. &gt;&gt; Why? Because of the charm of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because of that charm of life. Are we feeding on the fatted calf? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we feeding on the fatted calf? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. May God create more hunger in us for the word. &gt;&gt; May God create more thirst for the word. &gt;&gt; May God create more hunger. We have the fatted calf that has been killed for us. &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's why the prophet say whomsoever much is given much will be required. We have been given so much revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was not given to the Lutherans &gt;&gt; that was not given to the Methodist that was not given to the Pentecostals. Now we are feeding on the fatted &gt;&gt; cows. Who are we? We are gods. &gt;&gt; Yeah. A cow will give birth to a cow. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; A sheep will give birth to a sheep. Yeah. What about God? &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, we started by saying, Yeah. one of the qualifications for adoption, you must belong to the father. &gt;&gt; That's right. You must have been his. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; From the beginning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now for us, we were in his mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We only acquired a different nature when we came in this world. &gt;&gt; But still God's chin was in us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's what he has been looking for. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason he has flashed the word, the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you see yourself. You say, "Oh, that looks like me." &gt;&gt; And you embrace it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; May God help the church to come to herself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet is saying. &gt;&gt; May God help each one of us to come to ourselves. &gt;&gt; God help me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you know your father? &gt;&gt; Do you know your father? as a forgiving father or as a cruel father. Yeah. Every time he sees you, he pins the pins you down. &gt;&gt; There was there was a clip where somebody was making fun but the father was asking was telling the the the the father was telling the son you are a dog. You are a dog. Then the son said, "Okay, then if a dog gives birth to a dog, [Laughter] &gt;&gt; but God gives birth to God." &gt;&gt; So who are we? &gt;&gt; Who are we? &gt;&gt; No, some are not even responding. Who are we? Who are we? &gt;&gt; So, can we behave like gods? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we behave like gods? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sister, can we behave like God? &gt;&gt; Can we act like gods? &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; All that was in God was bought in Christ. All that was in Christ was bought in the &gt;&gt; for what purpose? to continue the work that was not fulfilled by Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; What was one of the works he did? Forgiving. &gt;&gt; Do we forgive? &gt;&gt; Or we behave like the elder son. &gt;&gt; He did this. He came with records. Yeah, he came with records to prove to the father he has done this. You gave you gave him this. He went and lived a riotous life. He wasted everything and now he has come and you have killed for him fatted calf and yet me I've been faithful. So as far as adoption was concerned he deserved to be adopted. But look at the nature in him. anger, unforgiving. Hello. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh my goodness. I don't have time to go to the ring. Let me just mention something about the ring that we I wish. Now, the ring in the Old Testament, they never used to sign with a pen. They used to give a ring. So that ring used to act as a signature. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now here is somebody who has come from from living a riotous life. Yeah. He comes and you know what has happened. Now here he comes and you give him a ring. Meaning all the money that is in the that is in the bank, he can write a check and withdraw it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hello. In our natural thinking, can we do that, &gt;&gt; brother Victor? Can you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can you Here is somebody who has come from living around. He wasted everything. He wasted everything. He didn't have anything when he came back. And yet you give him a signature. &gt;&gt; Yes. Okay. uh in the Bible Genesis 41:42. We may not reach on the shoes, but uh I hope God will inspire one of the preachers to finish it. Amen. Genesis 41:42. And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph's hand and arrayed him in vestures of the of fine linen and put a cold chain about his neck. What does that mean? Pharaoh putting his ring on Joseph. meaning Joseph is now in control. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; He's in control. &gt;&gt; He can sign the check and all the money is gone. &gt;&gt; So that is the purpose of the ring. Now do you see how now important that ring was to the protoan? He was given the ring, a signature. He can sign. Whomsoever he hires will be hired. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Preach it, brother. Come on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whomsoever he forgives will be forgiven. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Preach it. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, these articles of these symbols of adoption My goodness, &gt;&gt; we've not come to the conclusion of adoption because I remember when I started the subject, a brother in late preach said, "Oh, brother, you've you've missed it." I said, "Give it time." Later on, he told me, "I didn't understand where you are going. Now he's even more richer than I expected." You see, when we talk about adoption, we run on the on Jesus Christ when he was adopted. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, this is what happened. But in between here, let's see what happens. It has so many. The prophet says the story of the protocans brings the true picture of adoption. &gt;&gt; Now today at least you can see &gt;&gt; that picture of adoption. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the condition that we are in? &gt;&gt; May God help us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God help us to come to ourselves. &gt;&gt; Let your prayer be Lord help me to come to myself. &gt;&gt; Lord help me to come to myself. &gt;&gt; Cuz if I come to myself, yeah. Then I'll go to my father. &gt;&gt; But you must know your father. How do you know your father? By the opening of the seals. Yeah, it makes us to know who God is, who our father is, &gt;&gt; his nature, what he loves, what he doesn't love. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let us stand. Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew, can you come and help me to sing? I He knows my name. Come on to heaven. Yes. &gt;&gt; He knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls. and hears me when I call. I have a maker. &gt;&gt; I have a maker. [Music] He formed my heart. [Music] &gt;&gt; And before even time began, my life was in his hand.
