The stories and pictures in most magazines now feature new stylings not fit to be seen. They're placed on the new stands where children can buy when they go wrong. Do we want if we forget God? His mercy will flee and sin will cover the land and the sea. If we forget God, Satan will rule. If we forget God, our nation is Jew. We hear about the wars. I see famine in the land. There's questions in the little children's eyes. Trouble in the east again. The whole world is shaking with no sure place to stand. And a mournful sound is heard throughout the land. I keep listening for a different sound. Sound of the city that John saw coming down. The sound of the bride being united with the groove. I keep listening. I keep listening. I keep listening for different sound. I remember the preacher saying that it shall come to pass there will come a generation that will be the last. I can't believe I'm standing here seeing the end of time and the preacher's voice echoing in my mind. I keep listening for a different sound. The sound of the city that John saw coming down. The sound of the bride being united with the groove. I keep listening. I keep listening. I keep listening for a different Yes, I keep listening for the for a different sound. Amen. This is the age that they're talking about there. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was just uh thinking of what uh brother Rogers said. you know, in uh the communities we live, you know, Canada is kind of like a melting pot or should we say different people coming from different areas. Sometimes we see our neighbors around. We don't know their situation. We don't know what brought them to Canada. H But you know what? What we know is that there's just that one God, the God of heaven, who takes care of all our needs, no matter how big, no, how small they are. Amen. Uh there's a song that says uh I'm going to get the I'm going to let the glory roll. I not very good at it, but uh we'll try the chorus on that. I'm going to let the glory roar when the roll is called in glory. Going to get inside myself when I be beside the king that day. I'm going to have the time of my life. When the time of my life is over, I'm going to get carried away. When I get carried away, I'm going to let the glory roll. When I get in glory, I'm going to get beside myself. When I get beside the king that day, I going to get the time of my life. When the time of my life is over, I'm going to get carried away. When I get carried away, let's sing it again. I'm going to let the glory roll. When the glories called in glory, I'm going to get beside myself. When I get beside the king that day, I'm going to have the time of my life. When my life is over, I'm going to get carried away. When I get carried away, can come. Amen. May God bless you. I have a maker. He formed my heart. And before even time began, my life was in his hand and he knows my name. He knows my name. name. And he sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call. Oh yes, I have a father.

God bless you. It's wonderful. Amen. Second Peter chapter 1. As we go through this study, Sister Debbie, God bless you. Good to see you. Last time I almost called someone like, "Sister Debian, I don't know who that was. still trying to find that person. But I was so looking forward to see you that I called someone. You are sister Debbie. But uh God bless you. Good to see you. Let's stand together reading the word of God. Um second Peter chapter 1 verse three. According we can start for verse two actually. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of our Jesus our Lord. According as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue. That's where I take my title. We are called to glory and virtue. say, "Whereby I given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge." May God bless his word. Can I have a seat? Amen. As we are going through this study of the stature of a perfect man or the statue of the fullness of Christ, we have been developing a lot on faith and I believe we can never finish the topic of faith to continue until the end. But we need just to make another step try to look at a different angle as much as we could. But it's still a lot to be talked about faith. But we just move to the next stage of virtue. next stage of virtue there. U so I would like just to take that that from the scripture um second Peter second Peter chapter one and verse three according as his divine power. His divine power has given us unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue. And we are called to glory and virtue. Amen. In Greek the word virtue there it's written as arete. Hopefully I'm spelling well. I'm saying well arete which is reference as the excellent of a person of things fulfilling its intended function. says they give an example like a knife being sharp or a soldier being brave says that is full of virtue in the biblical use it says it refers to the excellence of character specialp specially moral strength or courage so aret has been used in the new testament five times and only three times has been translated as virtue in those in the sense of arete other places has been translated as praises. And first in Philippians 4:8 says, "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, there be if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things." So the same thing of virtue. So if I have anything that have any virtue have any can give excellent strength can give excellence purity of thought or moral purity of thought in that then you can you can think on those things otherwise don't think on those things. Amen. So virtue contains it goes deeper than just that just just the virtues in the natural. It's calling to a deeper Christian life to it's calling to a deeper spiritual development. Not only avoiding sin on the natural physical sin but also filled with the divine character. Maybe another message we going to talk about character that God is looking for character. Amen. As Elza was looking for character. Amen. God is looking for character. God bless you richly for that. Amen. So the prophet says this is more just it more it more than just clean physical life. And the prophet says at the beginning there it's more than just clean physical life. Are you with me this morning? Amen. I'm going a little bit slowly but we will get there somewhere hopefully by God's grace. Amen. In other uses of English word virtue they says um and so giving the description it says it's not only the word arete but in the so Greek it was used also is a dynamis which means the power of the strength often used for healing power so many places we see used the dynamic that where the word dynamic comes from is power is strength amen Luke 6:19 says and the whole multitude sought to touch Jesus For then went virtue out of him and healed them. So there was virtue in Jesus Christ and that virtue came out of Jesus Christ and healed the people. Amen. In Mark 5:30 says, "And Jesus immediately knowing himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press and said, "Who touched my clothes?" Amen. That woman with the blood issue, she had a revelation. She knew she she had a revelation said that God revealed to her if I go and touches the the hem of his garment I will be healed and God dropped that revelation inside of her heart and she went and she touched the hem of a garment and she and she was healed. She spent so much things so much money on different things and different doctors but when she came to Jesus Christ he immediately healed her. Amen. And he's still the high priest who can be touched by the feeling of infirmities today. He's still the same yesterday, today, today and forever. Amen. If you have a need, you can come and touch him. How can you touch the Lord Jesus Christ? You can touch him by faith. Amen. You can touch him and he will respond to your need because he's still here as we sung at the beginning. He has not changed. He's still the same yesterday, today, and forever. The Holy is here in the form of the Holy Spirit. Amen. If you have faith, you can touch him and you'll be healed. Amen. So virtue came out of him and he healed her. Amen. The same virtue is here. The same virtue has not changed. The virtue is still here. The same power is still here. The prophet says the Bible says we read over here in the book of Luke that what we reference to where it said virtue went out of him. That's right. The congregation says amen. And we are going to be like him. We must have virtue. Then if you want to be like Jesus, we also must have virtue. We must have the same power inside of us. We must have it to be like him. He is he is the he is the first song that ever loved in the hymns. One of the greatest the prophet says was to be like Jesus. No matter I like the same song to be like Jesus. All my desire is to be Oh my voice is going. try to be there. So to be like Jesus and well well if I'm going to be like Jesus I've got to have virtue and a pass that I can and a pass that it can pass forward from me to the people because virtue went out of him to the people. You see virtue before you can let it out, you've got to have it first. Amen. You haven't got it, it won't come out. There is nothing for it to come out of. Amen. &gt;&gt; In order to give virtue to other people, you need to have the same virtue inside of you first. &gt;&gt; We know. We know that same virtue. Sometimes we put it in a different way. I might if God gives me grace, my I'm going that way. Sometimes we have sin. We look at only because we see it in the negative things. We have seen how people have exaggerated on the other side. go there you know see many sometimes you YouTube is full of them you know oh oh someone is creating oh and people fall and oh that pastor has virtue or that servant is really has power of god and that touch and people are falling and yeah it's good it's good praise be to god to that there's nothing wrong to that I mean in a normal way and sometimes can go to the extreme and you want just to see that and we have seen that and and sometimes it we see that being performed And behind it there is no life. And we see the pastor there. He does that but behind that and he's the one doing bad things and the one corrupting things, one stealing money from people and things. Then people wonder is really anything genuine about it. Anything real about it. Then we try to neglect it and and and shame to the pastor, shame to the minister, shame to the people try to use that just to show off and becomes a show off. It becomes an entertainment. It becomes all the different things and you know there is no the word of God behind it and it just becomes it just becomes a show I would say becomes a show and and there is no life to back it up and that's wrong that's why we started it has to start by faith it has to start by the new birth it has to start there must be a life behind it to sustain it amen otherwise it's just a showman like it's just a show and there's nothing behind it but on the other hand as well you know Christians Christian need to have the power of God. &gt;&gt; Christian need to have the virtue inside of them. &gt;&gt; Christian needs to have the reality of Jesus Christ in their life &gt;&gt; because he has not changed. Amen. Oh, you are going through a situation. You can lay hands on the sick and they can then they will be healed. Your hands the same hands your hands. Amen. Not only the hands of the pastor, your hands can do the work. Amen. God has no other hand but your hand. God has no other eyes but your eyes. He still want to use the body of people to continue his work. Amen. The Holy Spirit comes to give power. Amen. The Holy Spirit is not only in the words. The Holy Spirit is not only a theory. The Holy Spirit is a reality. Amen. The Holy Spirit brings the power of change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you you as a vessel God want to use you to convey the virtue. It can be a virtue that you feel physically but it can also be a virtue for spiritual strength. Something someone is someone is in need. Someone needs an encouragement. You know you you you need to have the virtue of God to encourage that person. You need to be in the channel God can use you to encourage that person. Amen. But if there is no nothing behind there's no there is no virtue in you. There is no power there's no strength you can't help the other person. Amen. But you need to be in the channel that God can use you to help the other person. You need even to be feeding upon the word of God. You need to be in the channel that God can use you in order to convey virtue to another person. The virtue that God gives you, it's not only for you. It's for the other person, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We look in the Bible, we see Mary. Mary went and see Elizabeth. You know the story very well. You know how the prophet dramatized it very well. She went and she has met the angel. She had received the word of power. She had received the word of virtue. Amen. Now she's going to see another one who is in a situation where she's wondering, "Oh, first of all, I have a husband who can't speak." &gt;&gt; Put it on in her mind. She has a husband who can't speak. She has a husband who was actually an unbeliever or a make believer. Maybe now God strike him. He can't talk anymore. &gt;&gt; So she's wondering what's going on. &gt;&gt; She's feeling that something has happened in her. There is a change. &gt;&gt; Is she feel that? Oh, she's she's pregnant, but the baby is not moving. There is death. If the baby dies, it's probably going to affect her as well. She's going to die. She's there desperate and she doesn't know what to do. But then the angel meet Mary on the corner somewhere. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; She meet the angel somewhere in the corner and the angel told her, you know, even Elizabeth is now pregnant with a child and she will give birth too. So she comes with the word of God. Amen. She has met the angels. How many have met the angel? Amen. You have met the mighty angel of God. You have Excuse me. My voice is is betraying me this morning. Sorry. But we we but it's okay. I mean I'm not sick. It's just you're bothering me. So she comes, she comes with the word of God. The same way that we have received the word of God, &gt;&gt; the secret for the bride in the last age, she has the word of God like it was in Mary. We have the same word of God in the bride today. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you use the same word of God, it can give life to someone else. &gt;&gt; That's why we have to testify about the word of God that we have received. Don't be ashamed of the word of God we have received. &gt;&gt; It has power to change. It has power to transform. It has power to comfort. It has power to encourage someone. It has power to give life to something that is dead. &gt;&gt; So she comes with the good news. We have the good news. &gt;&gt; I have met the angel. I have met the angel. He has told me that I will have a child. You know the prophet dramatized. He didn't tell how what happened. Oh no. I I will have a child. Oh, Mary, you have a child. But you're not married to Joseph yet? Yes, I'm not I'm not married yet. But something the I've met the angel. Praise be to God. I've made the angel told me that the Holy Spirit will overshadow me and I will bear a son. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that son will be named Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. The first time that she mentions the name Jesus Christ, John in the belly of Elizabeth start jumping, start leaping of joy. The prophet says, "If the first time that the word of God, that the name of Jesus Christ was pronounced, it gave birth to a dead baby, how much more shall it do to the church that is born again?" &gt;&gt; Amen. to show the power of the word. We have received the name of Jesus Christ still has the power to change, the power to deliver, the power to save, the power to redeem. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember Mary was did not even have the Holy Ghost. Mary had to receive the Holy Ghost in the upper room. She didn't have the Holy Ghost, but she pronounced the word of God, believing the word of God, it gave life. How much more the Christians who are born again today, they have the Holy Ghost, they can pronounce the name of Jesus Christ, you will produce the same result. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She transferred virtue from her to Elizabeth. Amen. You can if you have the virtue of God, you can transfer it to someone else. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. That's why we need a church. That's why we need one another. Amen. Sometimes can come to someone come to church is so weak and everything but he's sitting next to you. You see how you are singing. You see how joyful you are. Your virtue is transformed to the other person. I feel so good. I was in church. You did not know that the virtue came from my brother. The virtue came from my sister. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have the virtue of God inside of us. &gt;&gt; Encouraging you brothers and sisters. And then Elizabeth said, "Oh, when is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For lo, as soon as the voice of that salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. Blessed is she that believed." Oh, I used to wonder how come the prophet could tell a story about it that no, it was not. She didn't just greet him and say, "Hey, Elizabeth." No, she had to say a testimony that what gave life to the baby. &gt;&gt; I used to wonder how the prophet where did he get it from? Then I was reading oh Elizabeth himself says it when when he when he greeted her and told her she said blessed is she that believed. How Elizabeth would say blessed are you because you believe what the angel said to you. So you must have told her what the experience then she realized, oh praise be to God because you believe what the angel told you. That's what she's confessing. Pray, blessed are you because you believed. &gt;&gt; Blessed are you because you believe what the angel has told you. &gt;&gt; And God is going to fulfill his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet continues says Jesus the little John leaped in the in the mother's womb begin to jump like that received life. The first time the name of Jesus Christ was ever spoke to mortal lips. A dead baby come to life in the womb of a mother brother. If it will bring a dead baby to life, what ought to be to a born again Christian? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says hallelujah. The same thing. It will make a work. The blind see, the deaf hear the name of Jesus Christ. Is it something of the past? Is it something only for brother problem brother? Is it something that we can say or no? It is something. No. It's still a reality today. &gt;&gt; It can give life amen to those who are dead. It can it can make the walk. The blind see the deaf heal in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You know sometimes we put it so much you know these are these are little things. Yeah, thank God. It's a little thing. We are not yet at the capstone. Praise be to God. We are going to the capstone. We'll get there one day if the Lord terries. &gt;&gt; But you can't get to the capstone if you don't have the good foundation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we be little and say, "Oh, no. No. This is for baby. This is pentecotism. The only, you know, we can't teach the bride pantism of things." &gt;&gt; But where are you going without having the good foundation? Brother Wam had the first pool, the second pool, the third pool. But even in the third pool, the miracle didn't didn't finish. The miracle was not for the past. Amen. It was still working. Amen. Even when the word of God is open, the miracle are still there. Amen. The power of God is even more amplified. Amen. We should not we should not we should not live under our privileges. Amen. We have the word of God. We have the power of God. Actually the word of God should produce the power of God. Amen. Because the word of God doesn't come only in words only in letters but it comes with the dynamics. Amen. &gt;&gt; Once you receive the capstone even the virtue that we have there becomes more amplified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at Peter John at the gate. Beautiful. going to cough again. Act 3:13. And Peter and John went up together in the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour. And a certain man lame from his mother's womb were carried whom they lay daily at the gate at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask arms of them that enter into the temple who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked and know arms and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said look on us focus on us focus on what we're going to tell you and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them. Then Peter said, "Silver and gold have I not, but such as I have give idea." Amen. &gt;&gt; He had something before he could give to something else. &gt;&gt; He had to possess it before you give to someone else. &gt;&gt; And he had the power of God. &gt;&gt; He knew that God was with him. Amen. He was not there. Sometimes it's marvelous. He was not there trying to God pray, bro, I will pray until God sends me the power and everything. I will fast. He knew that God's power was there. &gt;&gt; Look at me. I'm going to declare the word of God. What I have, I transfer that to you. Amen. No matter the situation, I transfer that to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; On that place, it was a miracle. But let me tell you, it might not be a miracle in your life that happened all of a sudden, but you still have the same power as you declare it. That's not your problem. That's God's problem to deal with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I declare healing upon my family. I declare salvation upon my family. I declare actually redemption upon my family because God says if I'm saved, my family shall be saved. &gt;&gt; God says if I if they lay hands upon me, I'm healed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't see it yet, but I believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the virtue is in the bride. So I give you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk. And he took him by the right hand and lifting up and immediately his feet and ankles bones received strength and he lifted up and leaping up. And he lifting leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. The pro that's what the prophet says in the message of search of a perfect man. We are not building an organization. &gt;&gt; We are not here this morning to build an organization. Christ has never sent me to build an organization. &gt;&gt; We are not here to build just a group, a society or community or something. That's not the purpose. Amen. Christ has sent me to build indiv individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ. Amen. Why does he want Why did he send him to build individuals? He sent him to build individuals so that they might be the powerhouse. The powerhouse. Amen. &gt;&gt; How what is a powerhouse? Is a place where they store energy. Amen. God has called you to the message in order to store energy inside of you. In order to store virtue inside of you. Amen. So that he can use that virtue for your family, for your place where you are working, for your community where you are. You are a powerhouse. Amen. You are a virtue house. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are actually a cabin. Electrical cabin. Amen. You know it's a small thing and people oh that you know once you touch there you'll find out or maybe you might not find out. You'll find on the other side what happened to you. Amen. That's what a Christian is. You might not look very handsome or cute or whatever it might but once you have the Holy Ghost inside of you, you have the power of Jesus Christ. The dynamic of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need us, God can give that to you. &gt;&gt; So that might be the powerhouse and the dwelling place of the spirit by his word. By his word see build up the individual to that place. Not build an organization to a greater denomination but build individual to sons and daughters of God. That's the idea. Add to your faith, virtue to your virtue, knowledge, and our coming to a place then you keep going up. Amen. Don't just know I have faith. I have faith. Yes, you have faith, but that faith has power. Amen. Look at Elijah. Elijah see that little boy. The Bible says, actually, I think I have a little reference. First Kings 17:21, Elijah stretched himself upon the the child three times. The child was completely dead. completely dead &gt;&gt; and he laid himself upon the child and cried unto the Lord and the soul of the child came upon him and he revived. &gt;&gt; Elijah putting his body and warming up with the body of a dead man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, that that's something only on the past. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; No, it's not only something of the past. The same God there is still the same God today. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many times you feel like you are solo? You are solo. But once someone calls you, someone speaks something to you, you come to church, you go different from the place how you came to to church. What is doing? What is that power? What is that virtue came from? The same God is still here. Amen. &gt;&gt; If God have a prophet will actually make put that many many many places, it was the dynamic. Amen. If the dynamic was working so well under the law, how much more when the Holy Ghost comes upon the believer, the same dynamic should work. Amen. It has to work. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's something to challenge us a little bit. Amen. We are not looking for it as I have to see. I have to see. No, but oh God, help me to be in the channel where you can use me. Help me to be expecting more for you to work. Amen. We can't always rely on medicine. We can't always rely on on the schools. kind of relies on technology. Where is the power of God? It's here. Amen. Some God, now I'm putting you to the test. I'm proving your word. I'm believing your word. The virtue is inside of me. I have faith. So, the virtue has to be there. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that I'm I'm all the way to the cap to the to the capstone. But I'm all the way to cap. But where is my virtue? Where is what I can transfer to others? &gt;&gt; Where the people can draw from me? Where is it? Lord, help me Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Elisha, even Elish and the Shunomite son, he went up lay upon the child. The flesh of the child walks home and the child sneeze seven times and open his eyes. The same thing happened showing the dynamic of God. The dynamic when comes upon the prophet, he gave him life. If Elisha's bones, now another experience. If Elisha bones, they were carrying a dead person. They were carrying a dead person. Then they saw the enemy coming, they throw that dead person in the cave where Elisha was buried. &gt;&gt; If the bones of Elisha can give life to that person who was dead, &gt;&gt; how much more the church of the living God today that is still alive believing the word of God, we should have the virtue inside of us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, may you shake us and give us that virtue of God. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says next quote statue of the perfect man. What if someone try to draw virtue out of us and the check will return insufficient funds? Oh brother, sisters, no I'm going through difficult times. You know what this happened to me and then this I'm going through that difficult time. I don't know what I can to do. Oh sister, would you please pray for me? You know what? That's really bad situation. My grandpa died from it. Oh, sufficient funds &gt;&gt; can't have any virtue to give to another person. Oh, you know what happened in the church there? There was a problem. This, there was a problem this. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Oh, tell me more. I will find out. And go on and go on, &gt;&gt; insufficient funds. &gt;&gt; But the real Christian hear that, oh, let's pray about it. Let's put our hands on. You know, God can deliver him. God is still working. You know the devil is fighting. We recognize is the work of the enemy. But we don't want to give him any house. We stay with the word of God. Let's pray together. Amen. &gt;&gt; The other person who came negative is going back with positive. Amen. He receive a charge. Amen. From the other person. Because you are not too much negative. You have something positive. Virtue is positive. Amen. The power of God is is positive. &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone comes to draw virtue out of us and the check will return insufficient funds. See? No, no, no, no, no. They are to draw from check, check bounced. Somebody looking at you as a Christian and tomorrow see you out here carrying on like a sinner. Not much virtue can be drawn from that. Oh, I'm a Christian. I believe the message and things. And the next thing they found you dressed like a like a chicken insufficient funds. So, oh no, they are just like the other denominations can't draw anything from them. So, oh no, you testify testify and then they hear you. You're the one gossiping and oh insufficient funds. &gt;&gt; May God help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you have a clean life, pure life, always positive, staying on the word of God and testify, not to show up, just a clean, simple, humble life, people can draw from that. How many times at work people will just notice it you and when they have a problem, they come, you know, you know, I know that you pray, you you go to church, can you pray for me, for my situation, for my child and everything, they notice that that there is power there. There is something that is keeping you hold. They see you go through trials and different things but they notice that there is something that is keeping you. There is a keeping power holding you there. Amen. That's different from other people. Now they can come and draw from that. Oh, don't say no only has they have to be believers. Some they might not even be message believers but they drew something from you from that time. And that's what God wants to be. Amen. want us to be be a powerhouse any place anytime under any circumstances. God help us to be ready for that for that to someone needs a little bit of charger come to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your house has to be a place where your children come finds power. &gt;&gt; They might not be here believers but they know that they can go anywhere but when I come to daddy I find some peace. When I talk to mommy I find some peace. I might not agree with him. right away. But I know that daddy and mommy has something different and I can draw from them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's make our house powerhouse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They come, you talk to them. No judging. No. No. Just come talk to them nicely convey and everything. They will draw from you. That will help them to conquer the enemy outside where they are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet says virtue must be in us. Virtue must be in us. So virtue is not an option. He's not saying no no we skip all that. No let's go to the third pool. Let's go to the third pool. Speak the word and everything but no virtue. So no no no it's a must. Don't skip it. Don't jump over it. You have to have it. You have to have the reality. You have virtue must be in us until we get virtue. Then when we get virtue, true virtue prophet say when we get true virtue, we can add it to our faith. We know the expression when you're saying adding doesn't mean that you force yourself to add. Oh no, I'm going to have virtue. I'm going to force. No, that's not that. I'm just repeating. We already went through that. But when you say adding is Lord you stay in the channel you feed upon the word of God you stay prayed up you all that then things going to add up by themselves by God's grace but you're also praying God I want to be participant with you I realize this is my weak spot help me God is going to do that is God doing the work amen but you work in collaboration with him says that's the next foundation wall now first you must have faith faith alone won't do it. You've got Peter say then add virtue to your faith. You must have virtue in order to add it to your faith. Amen. Because this is a promise. Amen. You must faith alone cannot do that. We know what the scripture says that this faith say you know you can have such faith you can move mountains and different things but you don't have charity profit nothing. We know that scripture. Amen. We know that the in end time there will be people say Lord Lord Lord haven't we prophesied and they cast out devils and all different things. Yeah there is one side where people didn't have the true foundation. They didn't have the new birth. They didn't have the true revelation. I mean they will be doing miracles. That's why we don't base our faith upon miracles. Yeah. That's one side. Amen. People will be doing things and but still if they're not true and right in their heart there's something missing and that's not what we are talking about. It's not only doing miracles for the sake of doing miracles. That's not what we are talking about. But when you have a true heart, when you have a true faith, when you are born again, Amen. these things are not optional. They have a reality. Amen. In our church, we believe in a miracle of God and God still performing miracles. Amen. Amen. You yourself, you are a greatest miracle. Amen. God saved you from the pit of hell and took you from that place, that's the greatest miracle. Amen. If God can take you from the pit of hell, from where you were and put you and make you a Christians, how little are those other things that he cannot do? Amen. Is the same God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where am I? The power of God is not optional. It's a must. The mechanic without the dynamic, without the virtue is not enough. We need both. That's why Paul said in 1 Thessalonian 15, for our gospel came out, came not unto you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance as you know what manner of man we were among you for your sake. Amen. The message did not come only for eloquence or theology of creeds or dogma. It came with divine power as the evidence of the Holy Spirit at work changing our heart, delivering us from sin and sometimes confirmed by signs and wonders. Amen. It's still the same God. As Paul said in his ministry, he says in Romans 15:4, I will not dare to speak of any of these things which Christ had not brought by me to make the Gentiles obedient by word and deed through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of God. So that from Jerusalem and roundabout into into all the place I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. The prophet in the statue of perfect prophet man is talking about the virtue says virtue anyone knows what the word virtue means we must have it. If virtue went from him to heal the woman that was sick is expecting the same virtue in his church because he was our example. &gt;&gt; Oh, who is expecting that? God is expecting the same virtue in the church as Jesus Christ has the same virtue. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he had virtue to give to the people, God expects us to have virtue to give to the people. Amen. We must have virtue to give to the people. We must be in the channel to for God to use us to give virtue to the people. Amen. What is virtue? Virtue is strength, is power. Some of them didn't even believe in the power of God. They say that pastor the only thing you have to do is just put your name on the book and be sprinkled and paused and baptized and whatever. That's all you have to do. So that's the problem. Some people don't even believe in the power of God. They just want to know you're part of the list. You're part of the church. That's it. Amen. You're part of restored word and that it. Amen. You make your attendance. That's it. Amen. You pay your tithes and offerings. That's it. No, that's not enough. Amen. You need to be born again and you need to have the power of God. Amen. God is expecting us to have the virtue of God to in order to transfer that to another person. Let me say this, without the power, we are just a denomination. Without the power of God among us, we are just like any other denomination. It's just any like any other school of theologian. We will be knowing God. We be knowing different things. But we need the power of God. We don't want only the form of godliness. We want the power of God in our midst. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you come to church, come expecting, I'm going to the church because God is going to work and do mighty things. Amen. God is still the same there. It's still the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't belittle God. Don't leave on your privileges. I am a believer. Amen. As we sung at the beginning, Lord, I believe nothing is impossible to you. Nothing is impossible to you. You have a you have a low account balance, God can provide. Amen. your your your children are sick, God can provide. You don't have children, God can provide. Amen. My wife and I, we didn't have children for many years. Amen. And then we go to the church, we get prayed, we have children. Amen. She doesn't even want to have more. Amen. Think about it. We were crying for them. Now she doesn't want anymore. &gt;&gt; It's still the same God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now what is the question now? How can someone get the virtue of God? How can someone get the power of God? I believe it's a good question to ask ourself. We touched you already it in the past and I can to receive and walk in the power of God or virtue of God. It's not about emotions. It's not about hype. It's not about works. But I believe it's about surrender and having faith and believing in the dwelling of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Probably we summarize it and I'll be closing already. Didn't develop it too much but I might be closing but I still have something to mention that before we go there says I preached a sermon about 20 years ago I guess on Reverend Mr. Lily. Lily the pastor took it from the text where Jesus said, "Consider the lily how they neither toil nor spin. Yet I say unto you, Solomon in all his glory is not a red like one." Look at the lily. It comes from way down in the m and every minute of the day it has to be drawing from the earth. What does it do with the virtue that it draws? It gives it out. Amen. It makes a beautiful sight of for the admirer. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the lily that nice very comparison here says for the May it open up itself for honey for the bee to come and get his part. Don't they don't complain it just got it and give it out. What if the bee come in there in suff and it is insufficient funds no honey that little bee will scratch his head and say what kind of a lily is that? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Many principles from Dr. Lily. &gt;&gt; We can get it from &gt;&gt; first is getting from the earth. But first thing he has to be a lily. &gt;&gt; You can't ask that from a cocoa bar and other thing. First thing he has to be a lily. &gt;&gt; So how can I have virtue? First thing you have to be a lily. &gt;&gt; First thing you have to be transformed. First thing you have to be changed. First thing you have to be born again. First thing you have to have the personal revelation of Jesus Christ. Otherwise, you are not a lily. You're just trying to put up something and the be will recognize that there is nothing there. It's not a lily. So, I can't even go and waste my time there. That what not what we want. We want to be true lilies. Amen. God transform me from the inside. Amen. From the inside to have the nature of Jesus Christ. That's why the new birth is so important. Amen. It a master. Eat the master. How can you have the Holy Ghost? Stay with the word of God. Believe the word of God. You are being born by the in Thank you brother. Thank you. So the first thing Yeah. It's the first thing you first thing you have to be born again. It has to be it has to be the new birth that change your mind your ideas. that the greatest miracle that God and you have to be willing to yield to God say God it's not my will it's your will &gt;&gt; when you will perform it it's not me want it but you will perform let me be just be yielding to you Lord let me be stay in the channel where you can use me power doesn't come for selfish reasons no I will do that they see that I'm a powerful minister so I'm I'm a powerful Christians oh I can heal the sick and no that's not that God is not going to that's not the true power you on. But when you are humble, when you are simple, when you are healing to God, that's when the God is going to fill you with the Holy Spirit. The more you empty yourself, the more God is going to fill you. Amen. In fact, God is willing to fill us more than we are willing to accept it. Amen. So if we just heal oursel, humble oursel, God is more than powerful to heal fill us with the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit comes with power. Amen. The promise is but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you. Amen. If you have the true Holy Spirit as I've been encouraging you, let me tell you God can fill you with his power. Amen. Now you have to receive the power of God because it's there. It's available. The prophet says in the Holy Ghost given voice says I'm was talking on power of prayer, power of speech, power for holy life. That's what the Holy Ghost is to do. Some of you people walking around saying, "Well, I can't quit drinking. I can't quit this." The Holy Spirit comes to live in you to make all these can't get away from you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, when you have the Holy Ghost, there is no excuse. You can't say, "I can't get rid of this. I can't get rid of smoking. I can't get rid rid of lust. I can't get rid of of pornography. I can't get rid of all the different bad things." When you have the Holy Ghost, he can clean you. He can wash you. He can take all these things away. Amen. Because God is real. It's not you forcing yourself. It's the Holy Ghost living inside of you. Living his own life. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's still real, brothers and sisters. How many believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to emphasize on the power of the Holy Ghost because it's God himself. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "That's right. Make women stop cutting the hair. Make them quit wearing shorts and slacks. You have no excuse. make them quit tattling, gossiping. It make them quit those things. Yes, that's what it is for to make you a holy life. It will follow the instructions of the Bible every time. &gt;&gt; I believe the Holy Ghost comes to give us holy life. &gt;&gt; Holy life is not only for the Methodist, of the Amish. &gt;&gt; Holy life is for the believers, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not old school. It's still part of the pyramid. Amen. You want to go higher with God, you need to have virtue. You need to have Holy Ghost. You need to have the power of God to give you a holy life. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is the source of power for the believer. Power to live holy, power to witness for God, power to overcome sin, power to even minister with gift. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't just rely on the gift or this one is eloquent person is the one can put things together. This one can you know intellectual things. No, we need the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need the leadership of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to put few minutes here. It's not my emphasis, but let me just put him in talking about holy life. Prophet paragraph 143. He says, such of perfect man talking about virtue. You know, it's good to read. I hope it's okay when we're going through a study, we go through and read the message. sometimes go paragraph or paragraph a little bit. I think it's okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be a church where you see one paragraph, oh, let's skip that paragraph. It's going to hurt that brother. It's going to hurt that sister. No, let's keep that one. No. Maybe another minister can preach. Not me. &gt;&gt; That's not the kind of church we want to be. No, no, no, no. Amen. What the prophet says, we read it and we say it. We comment upon it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we desire. Amen. Because we desire the whole word of God. We don't want the partial truth. We want the whole truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "Write these that knocks a lot of us." Right? There knocks a lot of us down. Yes, sir. Yet add virtue to your faith. It does it doesn't just mean living a virgin life, you know, like the woman or woman and so forth. It doesn't have nothing to do with that. It's very good. Amen. It's not only all the virgin life. It's beyond that. Oh, a clean life. It's beyond that. Amen. It is like like a man or woman. It's beyond that because it's the power of God that you can transfer to someone else. &gt;&gt; But notice as well as mentioned that say it doesn't just mean. It means it means to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It includes to &gt;&gt; but it's more than that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes as I what I've done and so far I have included what is more than that &gt;&gt; but it also includes that. &gt;&gt; How many agree with me? &gt;&gt; It includes this but it also includes this the power of God the Holy Spirit the miracles and other things but don't skip where it also includes here. &gt;&gt; We need also a holy life. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we emphasize on holy life, virgin life. Amen. &gt;&gt; We emphasize on the young people. Live clean. &gt;&gt; Live clean before your marriage. Live clean. Amen. &gt;&gt; Live clean until marriage. Amen. &gt;&gt; Very thing. It's important. You have to live clean. You have to stay yourself clean. Says for both like man and woman. We don't believe in proximity whatever they call it and different things. No, you live clean. You stay clean. Clean. Clean in the body. Clean in your mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't be there and know I'm a church believer and in the night you're on internet and watching bad things and and you come to church, you expect virtue. There's no it's actually drawing your virtue. After you spend so much things on internet, you can't pray anymore. You can't even read the word of God. You you feel yourself so dirty. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it has pulled your virtue out of it. &gt;&gt; But you know, put those things aside. There is no excuse when you have the Holy Ghost. If you don't have if you don't have the power to overcome those things, come we will pray together. We won't judge you. We won't put you down. When we went through that as a young people as well, we suffered and the different things. Amen. But but but there is power. Amen. We don't want to let you down and you struggle with that and you become when they start preaching you are your mind is somewhere else. No, that's miserable. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes adult too. married people and that was still wasting their time in those dirty things. Where can you find virtue in the church like that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need a clean life, a pure life, your clean mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you like me, let me just mention a few things you on that on that aspect. Amen. Is it okay? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good to talk about those things when there is no problem. &gt;&gt; It's a small church, right? If there is a problem in the church and it's only one person. If I talk about this, everybody will be like &gt;&gt; he's talking about her and they skip that sometimes themselves. But it's good to talk about those things when there's no problem. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's just mean living a virgin life you know like the man and the woman don't be quiet on me now &gt;&gt; the prophet was told on him don't drink don't smoke do not defile your body for there will be a work for you to do when you get older it's not just some things. So no, it it was for the prophet, but the prophet was an example. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So an example so that the new generation that comes, they have an example that they can follow. Oh, as the prophet was the the wave shift now our children now ourselves now we follow the wave shift. Don't defile your body in any way any no drink, no no smoking, no defile your word, not your your your body with women. Don't defy that because you have a work that God want to do with you when you get older. &gt;&gt; The Bible is actually emphasizing on that. Pro Paul says, "For this is the will of God, even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor. Every one of you, amen, including men, including women, amen, including girls, everyone should, you should keep his vessel clean for sanctification and honor. God want to use your body to convey virtue to others. Amen. So at a very young age, we want you to stay clean until you get married, you stay clean. Amen. Even when you are married, actually, you still am clean. Amen. You are allowed to do things when you're married. But even there you prophet rebuke things that were happening. Oh minister, I can see things dirty things. What's going on? Who are reading those dirty books and blah blah blah. What's what going on? And you call yourself Christians. So women hey &gt;&gt; stay clean. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Free fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body. For he that committed fornication sinnth against his own body. You are not your own. For you are bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body. Not only in your spirit but also in your body. Dedicate your body to God. As a young girl, as a young boy, I'm dedicating my whole things to God. My mind, my soul, my body for God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't put it and use it for divide different things. Amen. 1 Corinthians 6:13:20 says, "Meat for the belly and the belly for the meat. For God shall destroy both of it and do now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body." God had both raised up the Lord, and we also raised up us for his own power. Know ye not that your bodies are the temple of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot? God forbid. &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. Amen. What know you know that which is joined to a heart is one body for two hair he say shall be one flesh but he that's joined unto the Lord is one spirit then it says flee fornication that's what we read earlier &gt;&gt; for married people now concerning the things whereof I wrote unto you it is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband Man, &gt;&gt; not every man have his own wives. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Here we have one here. You go here, you have another one, you go there, another one. And so you call yourself Christians. Oh, &gt;&gt; no, no, no, no, no, no. That uh whatever. &gt;&gt; You don't even have the faith to begin with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One man, one wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not multiple partners. One man, one wife. Oh, but now I'm living under grace. No, it's a grace. God forgives me and everything. And no, no, no, no, no. Grace is actually more demanding than the law. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God is more strict under grace than the law. Why? Because grace gives you the power to overcome those things. &gt;&gt; Law didn't give you the power, just give you instructions and if you do it and then they put you in jail. But grace gives you the power to overcome. Lord, I can't do. I'm still struggling this. But oh Lord, help me to deliver here. Help me, Lord. And God will give you the virtue to overcome. The power to overcome. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is available. It is available. Amen. &gt;&gt; So even though grace offers forgiveness or mercy, it also calls to for a higher level of holiness because it deals with the inside of a person, not just the outside. That's why Jesus said, "You shall you have heard that was said by Matthew 5, you have heard that was said by them of old time that they shall not commit adultery. But I say unto you that whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her and committed adultery with her already in his in his heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; So adultery is not in the law. The adultery was only a physical thing. Amen. It was only an outward art. But now grace breeding to another level &gt;&gt; or now I'm bringing to another because you have the you have the power. Not to you but God gives you that power. Now it's not oh no I'm clean, you I've never we all clean everything. Oh, brother Madame came with that that with that argument before God, right? &gt;&gt; Says, you know, no God, you know, the only thing I could bring to you, Lord, I've never defiled my body with any other woman when he was in hell. &gt;&gt; Did he save him from there? No. Amen. You need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You need the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So, it's it's another level. It's not it's not only that. If you look only at a woman, we see so many naked women, right? &gt;&gt; It's summer. You see so many naked sometimes you can glimpse on someone stays for a little for a moment in your mind. Bab had the cross. If you see like that, look at the cross, &gt;&gt; the prophet of God, &gt;&gt; he had he was meeting the angels. He was he was talking with the angels. But but do you think that he didn't need that the grace of God to change his mind because the enemy could stay on his mind? A prophet of God. How much more you and I? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was prophet of God. We married and everything but the enemy can still try to men on your mind. So don't stay. You see that? Move your head right away. &gt;&gt; Don't I didn't see properly. &gt;&gt; No virtue. Amen. Amen. Because once you do that, grace says, "No, it's already adultery." On the day of judgment, you will you will answer for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not legalism. It's a call to a higher holiness. Amen. The Holy Ghost come to call us for higher holy ghost. So if the Bible says once you just look at it a woman last committ of adultery her in her heart now you are there on the internet and dirty things how many adulteries you are committing &gt;&gt; think about it and you have answer for that on the day of judgment &gt;&gt; it is taking virtue out of you it's not your wife it's not your husband stay away from them it's someone else husband It's someone else wife. Amen. It's not your wife. It's not your husband. &gt;&gt; And if you're struggling with it, like I said, I don't want to judge you. Ask for prayer &gt;&gt; because the son of God can set you free. Is it okay this evening this morning? &gt;&gt; The son of man can set you free. And if those who are looking are committing adultery, it goes also further. If you dress yourself sexy, if you dress yourself like that, no matter father th no matter how modest you think it is, and go out on the street and some old sinner looks at you to last after you at the judgment bar, you will be guilty of committing adultery that man when he answers for it. So it was you. Why is it? It was you was the one done it. You presented yourself that way. You are guilty that way. And you, no matter how virgin and pure you have lived, you will be guilty before God of committing adultery with a sinner just the same as you went through the act Jesus said. So that's not ski milk, brother. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; It's barbered wire, prophet says. But it's what God's word says. It cuts. It's sharper than two edges. But I believe it's the word of God. &gt;&gt; And the kingdom of God, there won't be wararmongers. They won't be adulterous because God will judge them. Amen. That's why you need to keep your mind clean &gt;&gt; and you need to dress properly. Amen. You don't want to be you don't want to be a victim of different things. You know sometimes I ask my I think my wife is you to check how you dress. I want to be on that day to be the only husband. I don't want to be there and meet 10 other people you are not aware that you are answering for those things. No. Dress properly clean. Amen. You're only one wife, only one husband. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Oldtimers know those things. But the new generation that's coming up, we need to emphasize on those things well &gt;&gt; so that they know that that's the standard of the message. &gt;&gt; That's the standard of the word of God. That the standard that bring us to the capstone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Women and women coming up. And this man, another topic, this man kissing these women's don't you keep away from that. You remember she's young, single, whatever she is, she'll be somebody's wife someday. &gt;&gt; Oh no, we are Christians and love and everything that come. Praise be to God. It's it's a how do you call it? Holy kiss. Amen. the the kiss in the old the Bible they're talking they were giving man to a man on the neck or &gt;&gt; it's not on the lips it's not even on the cheeks and no stand don't don't we don't want I know that I'm it's easy to talk about these things because there's nothing right if there was something then everybody will be pointing it's good to talk about these things but that's the standard that we are talking about virtue it's not only about this &gt;&gt; it takes more than that there is also So virtue can convey but don't neglect what is also this. Amen. &gt;&gt; The this is here is you have to have a clean life. No touching, no no kissing until marriage. The first time a man kisses you on the lips. It has to be when the pastor is said now you are married. You can kiss your wife. First time you kiss that wife, that girl man. Not before we are now engaged. I mean I know that he's going to be my he has nowhere to go. So now I can do whatever there. No no no no no no no no no until otherwise otherwise Mary would not will not be ashamed to be with Joseph. They were already engaged. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; But even though they were engaged they could not leave life as married. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you haven't got no business doing that stay away from her. If you want to greet her, then be a son of God. Shake her hand and say, "How do you do, sister?" Let that settle it right there. Stay away from those things. It's filth. It will soon get you into trouble. Amen. Sin is so easy. It's so appetizing and so pleasant. It's so easy to fall into right into it. The best thing to do is a very the to do is the very even appearance of it. Stay away from it. &gt;&gt; Get back. be a real Christian &gt;&gt; for a man kissing one another. If you kiss your brother on the neck and you want to do it, that's all right. Don't kiss no man in the lips on the mouth or anything like that because that's not right. That shows there is a little something wrong to begin with. Just so stay away from their shand that don't start that around this tabernacle here. They will certainly won't stand for that at all. If you want to see your brother, if you want to kiss him on the neck, well, go ahead and do it. But don't kiss people in the mouth because that won't work. That's not right. It only starts a perversion. It starts homosexuals and things like that. And we don't want that. Respect distance from one another, sister. Respect the distances. Amen. Avoid temptation. Don't &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible is talking about youth who lust. The youth are going through different things and the youth will last and different things. You stay away from any appearance of sin. Amen. That's how you will stay virtuous. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because any kiss is actually potential committing adultery. Amen. You all know that. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; That was my parenthesis. I closed it there. I can move on. We'll be closing now. I'm closing long closing. Glory to God. Glory to God. Let's give a hand hand to the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not always easy to preach a cutting message, but the old-timers know that. then you we live to that and then so they know that it's good to just repeat that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the gospel another thing so how can you receive the virtue of God one thing and that is one of the important thing in order to receive the virtue of God you must feed on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because man shall not live by bread alone but by every word. The Bible says Paul says or John says the word Jesus said the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and life. The word of God is alive and powerful. When you believe it and live by it, it produces power in your life. The message is just not information. The message is not just a bunch of instructions. It's actually a life. It has power. It's a living power. It reveals the truth. It exposes the motive. It exposes intent of the heart. But it also has the power to change you. Amen. Salvation is here. What is salvation? Salvation is deliverance from sin, deliverance from from unbelief, from guilt, from death, deliverance from diseases and sicknesses. And we have received the word of God, which is the power of God unto salvation. As Paul said, I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation. Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to have the power, you need to take the word of God and feed upon the word of God. The more you feed upon the word of God, the more you become the word of God. The more you receive the dynamics, the more you receive the power of God. Amen. Oh, it can't just No, I I just I can't be I can't feed upon the weather. I can't go to church, but I just want to have the dynamics. Somehow God is going to send me the dynamics. No, no, no, no. You need to be staying in the channel of God, feeding upon the word of God, praying. Amen. God is going to give you the power for deliverance. One day, whatever you're struggling with, God can just deliver you from that because you have been in the power of God. We have been in the word of God. Amen. The message of the eye doesn't just tell you about salvation. It causes salvation to happen in your life. Amen. Deliverance to happen in your life. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. The problem where we are struggling with let me tell you as I will be closing the problem that we are we are struggling with we listen to so many other voices &gt;&gt; we spend our time in so many other voices &gt;&gt; but let as we heard this morning we need that sound we need to listen to that sound &gt;&gt; we need to hear the voice of God &gt;&gt; I'm encouraging you young people and old and myself let's stay in the word of God let listen to the Word of God. Amen. Let's stay in the child of God. That's where is the power. We cannot live under our privileges. There is power in the message of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our elders have done great things with the message of the hour. Without the support of denominations. Amen. Is this the same God today? Amen. Can do the same thing and continue to do the same thing with us. Amen. The problem we listen to so many voices. The prophet said there are so many voices on earth today. That is absolutely a hard thing because it deadens. It means it kills the voice of the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Now we don't give influence to the supernatural anymore. We check on Googles. We check on we check on different things intellectual. It it's killing the voice of the supernatural. It's killing the voice of the power of God. Amen. But let me tell you the word of God has not changed. &gt;&gt; The word of God cannot be corrupted. The gate of God cannot be old mana. It's still fresh today. It's still real today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I just read a little bit and give me a little bit of favor this morning? There is a great prophet says there is a voice today in the world of politics. There is a great voice people absolutely in this great day of politics. It's all mixed up in their churches and everything. And many times we have seen recently that the voice of politics is actually stronger than the voice of God in the church. Oh, the American people will not never did it that they just did. What it means so many voices. Voice of politics. What did Trump say? What did Carney say? What voice of influencers, &gt;&gt; YouTube influencers? Or let me check on this one. Hey, but there is also something nice you, you know, it's getting harder to take just 30 minutes of your time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just to read, &gt;&gt; read this and I'm going to pray about this 30 minutes. But you'll find yourself in YouTube. You listen there one hour, two hours and then you come to church, you want virtue full of all the different things. Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us to give you a little bit of time. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, praise be help me Lord. Oh I love this. We will see God working mighty things. could go over and over but prophet says and this is what says my dear brother and sister the morals of this nation has become so low till it will make a dog ashamed it will make a a hound blush if if it could do so the immorals of our people the people even years ago the things that we have the nations have done the things that the people have done what what is it it's all the lack of prayer the church that used to didn't believe in picture shows. They didn't let the children go to picture shows. They will shan picture show. And today why they even have they have the picture show in their in the house. Every house has a television. &gt;&gt; Every house spend time in in in in those phones. You go in the house and everybody's on the phone and they're watching and everything. It's killing our time. It's killing it's pulling our virtue out of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. says you think the thing that they has done for us, how it has lifted us from the ship coat and he has made us known all over the world. How we how God has done the great thing for us. And yet we daily oh daily daily mingle around daily &gt;&gt; daily dilly dally which is my dictionary and mingle around and go out and we are not seem to be sincere. We don't have prayer anymore and things that don't like going right. We try to put on little programs and corn platters and ease the pain. You can't ease the pain until you get good rich blood in there to heal the thing. Now listen to this. It's all this other I've been reading it has been blushing prophet says how we need to pray how we will go back to you we will go back to you again brother do you realize we don't pray al as our fathers did &gt;&gt; father pers do you know we don't put as much time on our knees as the pastors before us did woman do you realize you don't instruct your daughter and pray with her at night like your mother did &gt;&gt; now it has become you do your own things and do my own things and then she goes to bed, she sleeps you but the old-timers in the evening take time with your daughter not only little kids sometimes with your daughters say you know let's talk a little bit you know this share this life you know the corruption the world and they might not accept it but you are sharing &gt;&gt; you are distributing the power the virtue One day they realize, "Oh, daddy was right. Mommy was right." But if you don't spend that time, who else will spend that time? &gt;&gt; The world will spend the time. They spend the time with the world all the time. But the person they can trust the most is you. Parents. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take time to not judgmental. Talk. Talk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Woman, do you realize you don't instruct your daughter and pray with her at night like your mother did? Then what about it? Who is guilty? We are all guilty. There's no way around it. We are all guilty. &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians can come. Statue of the perfect man. Like Jako once said, going into a restaurant and have a great big menu and begin to read it down. T-bones, steaks, and things. I like a t-bone. Well, then the restaurant says that was for a day passed. We don't have it anymore. The prophet says, "Might as well lay the menu down and get out." That's right. Because that's got nothing to eat anyhow. You might as well go where restaurant has got something to eat. And the spiritual man growing needs something to eat. That's the word of God. I believe every word of God. The Bible of God is talking about deliverance. It's a menu. And this church is a restaurant. We don't have a menu of the day past. &gt;&gt; The menu is here and we can be served today. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you need deliverance, the menu is here and we can serve you what the man is talking about. &gt;&gt; You are struggling with something, the menu is here and we can serve you what the menu is talking about. Not us. God is here to back up his own word. Amen. You need salvation for your family, the menu is here and the restaurant is ready to serve you that. &gt;&gt; Amen. You need the Holy Ghost, the menu is here and the restaurant is here to serve you that. Amen. Not something of the past. God is real today. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's sing Come and Dine. The master call of come and die. &gt;&gt; Come and die. The master call. Come and you may feast at Jesus step all the time.

Do you love the Lord this morning? Let's stand up together. I was thinking about this song, Coming Home. I don't know. I I'll try never more to grow. Oh, open thine arms of life, Lord. I'm coming home once again. Coming home. Coming home. Coming home. Never to open wide thine arms of love. Oh Lord, I'm coming home. &gt;&gt; I've wondered found God. Now I'm coming home. In the path of sin too long I've road. Lord, I'm coming home. Coming home. Coming home. Coming home. Never more to roll. Oh, and wine comes of blood. Lord, I'm coming home. I've wasted many precious years. Now I'm coming home. And now repent with me the tears. Lord, I'm coming home. Coming home. Coming home. Coming home. Ever more to roll. Oh, open wide arms of love. Lord, I'm coming. Oh, just close our eyes as the music is playing softly. You know the churches as we're closing our eyes the church is as we heard the other Sunday the church is like a hospital where we come those who are healthy say oh maybe nothing of that touched me it's fine but at least you came to the hospital for a checkup to know that everything is fine &gt;&gt; just say oh help me Lord to continue to take the same gospel take the same medicine because I'm fine. All is well by God's grace. But on the other hand, also those who go to hospital realize, oh, I've been missing this. Lord, maybe I missed that part, Lord. Lord, maybe I was not as clean as I thought in the natural. I was not as virtuous as I should be. Oh Lord, help me. Maybe I was not living under my privileges as a Christian with the power of God to move in my life, my family, work, wherever I am. Lord, help me also in that area. That's why I'm coming home. Lord, I recognized that I've wondered maybe but your word brought me. And if this morning someone want to give his heart to the Lord, say Lord, I want a new start with you. I want a fresh start with you, Lord. I'm coming home. Can just raise your hands. And the Lord sees your hand and he knows the situation. Someone's Lord, I I desire I desire closer walk with you, desire to be more sincere, desire maybe to spend time with my family and that they can see the love part because correction without love just going to hurt and separate more. But when they see the love of God in my heart towards them, then they can see that's Christ speaking to them. Lord help me in that area. Lord, can we just talk to him in your personal way, in your own way myself? I'm going to pray the word of God checked me as well. Lord, help me Lord and all of us. I just pray. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your presence this morning, Lord Jesus Christ.

Lord, &gt;&gt; God, make that a reality in my heart. It can be a virtuous bride, virtuous &gt;&gt; church, the one father lord Jesus Christ can be distributing, sharing, imparting eternal life to others, virtue of God to others, for healing, for encouragement, for a place of refuge. &gt;&gt; Oh father, let this church be a place where people come and find themselves comfortable. Oh, it's a place where I found strengthen. I see the love in the people. I see I was weak but I felt strengthened when I came in that place because I saw the love of God, the virtue of God being imparting to me. Make that church so powerful. Father, Lord, in the humility by the power of God moving among us, not only the word and letters, but the power of the Holy Spirit moving among this church.

He's calling out his virtuous bride in the last day. &gt;&gt; God is calling his bride virtuous. As I was thinking about it, how does he God see the church &gt;&gt; virtuous? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On this side, on the other side, God calls that pride virtuous. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I see the BL when I brother Victor, I'll call you after this. Don't mind for prayer. When I see the blood &gt;&gt; Christine for the sin, paid all his due.

As many as I love, I rebuke and I chasen. You are the same God who prunes the vine so that it can bear much more fruit. &gt;&gt; Lord, we Thank you for your grace this afternoon, Lord. We believe, Lord, that the word has been spoken &gt;&gt; and Father, many spirits that would have taken over your children have been arrested this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that the the virtue that was released at Calvary, &gt;&gt; that same spirit that came in the ministry of the prophet and brought deliverance to the bound, set the captives free. Lord &gt;&gt; that that same spirit has been called on this moment. &gt;&gt; Lord, you know your children. You know your people, Father. The reason why you are calling these spirits, oh God, Father, they will not be partakers, Lord, of darkness, oh God, that darkness will really not take over your church, Lord. Father, your church ought to have power. Not power only for deliverance from from the from sickness, Lord, but the power to live an abundant life in Christ. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost came to set the captives free. &gt;&gt; It's not Lord just to do what you said, but Father, that the life, &gt;&gt; the life of Christ will be in the believer. The life Lord that keeps us from sin. The life that cleanses us from all unrighteousness where we know we realize we are wrong. That the life that brings repentance. The virtue of Christ that can be transmitted to the next person. Lord, this Messiah X that has been called in the last day. &gt;&gt; How can he who is in prison deliver another in prison? Father, may the Holy Ghost that spoke this word this morning, I pray for every brother and every sister, may we do our homework where we have been found wanting, oh God. May we be humble enough, Lord, to wait before you the Holy Ghost will have preeminence. Every home, oh God, may the Holy Ghost put those things in their rightful place. All the doors that has been opened, may they be shut from the enemy. Lord Jesus, your temple must be cleansed. &gt;&gt; Lord, the last push for this bride, the birth of the word requires selflessness. It requires death to self. Oh dear Jesus, the voice of the blood is still calling. I pray my God not only for the young people, even for us the older generation, all the bars that have been let down. Oh God, our prayer life, our consecrated life, bring them back. Lord Jesus, we are supposed to be a peculiar people. We are not supposed to be like the world in any form. May that virtue be brought back every one of us. Lord, when we leave this place, I pray my God that we will meditate on these things. May we not just laid aside as something that was spoken in church. But the voice of God is calling. It is calling for a higher calling. It is calling for the power, &gt;&gt; the principalities that govern Edmonton. They have shut down the supernatural. They have relegated it to the old times so that Lord we don't have the power that keeps from sin. We don't have the power. We are trying Lord in our own strength but that's not your gospel. That's not the program. When you take the power out of the life of the people, what do you have left? What do you have left? But just people's thoughts. You're trying to keep yourself when you cannot keep yourself in this generation. All of hell has been poured into this generation. It will take the supernatural living God. It will take the living Christ. Lord, I remember when you told Peter, "Satan desires to sift you like wheat, like sand. But I have prayed for you." Oh, bring these things back to the church of the living God. A hospital where people can come and be cleansed, where people can come and be delivered. &gt;&gt; Our young people don't have to fight by themselves. Lord, may the older generation realize how much needful they are. &gt;&gt; Lord, their prayer life &gt;&gt; pray until the breakthrough. Lord, &gt;&gt; house of hell must give way. &gt;&gt; When the church of the living God, when the bride of Christ will take their place, when we will pay the price. Oh God forgive us Lord &gt;&gt; where we've became dilary Lord the cares of this world consumed us and our children were baby such with technologies oh God that we exposed to the enemy father but the church is now calling like Samson once more let the Holy Ghost move among us once more. &gt;&gt; Oh God, open our blinded eyes once more. &gt;&gt; Regardless of the price, let us pay it. Oh God, &gt;&gt; the government is on our shoulders. The cries of the ages gone by. Unbelievers come among us don't feel any virtue. Where is the salvation of God? Father, wake us up from our stuper. Wake us up from our slumber, our pride. Wake us up from our selfishness. &gt;&gt; Now, Lord God, we are at your throne. Pour once again the palm of Gilead. Pour once again, Lord God, the power of the living God. May we pay the price for that power. That's what Satan has been against all along. He has kept the letter of the message and has stripped the church of the power. But now Lord, your word has been spoken. It has reminded us. Lord, you have never changed. Lord, you don't intend to change. The church is not kept by words. It is kept by the power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Father, your children are before you throughout this week. Lord, will you protect them? Father, I pray for a cleansing in the sanctuary. May our minds be washed again. Father, let there be renewal. Oh God, in the homes, husbands, how you live with your wives, our children, how we relate to them. Oh God, may the love of God, that sweet spirit be brought back into the homes, the way we relate to brothers and sisters. May the love of God, that pure fountain, let it be disseminated. Let it be a week of contemplation. Father, where are we concerning your word? Where are we concerning the surrender that you are requiring right now? A lighthouse, a lighthouse you are calling, Father. Young and old, we must experience the living God. It is not just the anointing father but the living God power to withstand the cesspool of hell that we see all around us. Oh dear Jesus let your salvation ring in every place. Let it ring in every believer for those who've never known the power of God. Father may the doors be opened. Lord our brethren who have traveled brother Andrew and so on. May your protection be with them, Father. Keep your children from harm, from danger, from all the the the the desires of the wicked one. Father, we bind the works of darkness from affecting any one of them, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the love of God bind us together. Father, in their closet, bring the needs of your children. Father, I pray for the Hackalac family. Brother Johnny Hackalac has gone to be with the Lord. Father, that family has suffered a lot. Lord, they lost about three in the last three years. Lord, Lord, comfort them, Father. I pray you strengthen them. And I certainly thank you for brother Johnny's testimony. What the sickness did in bringing him to you, Lord, in bringing such a surrender like he's never known before. Father, all things do work together for your good. &gt;&gt; Your wisdom is past ours. Lord, give brother David, sister Donna, and the family. Give them strength in the blessed name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, may your Holy Spirit go with all who are able to come. May they may not even understand, but Lord, would you touch them for Lord, we don't have too much time. There isn't much time. Oh God, we love you, dear Jesus. We appreciate our our brother, Lord, Brother Moses, the pastor. We pray that more of the shephering anointing will be upon him, &gt;&gt; Lord. We pray that oh God all that you've ever wanted to do in a shepherd will be done in him father and may you be with his family protect them. We know Lord God the hounds of hell will always want to go after Lord God our benefactors. But Lord you are still the gracious one who protects who shields. Father I pray for every brother every sister their homes everything pertaining to them. Keep them bless them tremendously. Father as they be the extension of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, brother Victor. God bless you richly. We missed you so much. God bless you richly and thank you for prayer. Wonderful prayer.

Just want to get closer to God and give his heart to the Lord. Amen. Bless you. Amen. Um, shine on me and then we'll be dismissed. Shine on me. &gt;&gt; Shine on me. Let the light from the lighthouse shine on me. Shine on me. Shine on me. Let the light from the lighthouse shine on me. So we come for the family of brother Kalak. Thank you brother. I think I saw a message like that but I was not sure if it passed away. So brother John passed away. Be praying for the family. Remember them in prayer. It's a hard trials.
