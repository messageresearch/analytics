Sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. My rest is complete. Why at your feet? Sweet spit, sweep over my soul. Amen. That's what we desire that the Holy Spirit will just sweep over our soul this morning as we read the word of God. May God anoint his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; To our heart. I invite you to go in Luke 24:E5. Thank you musicians, song leaders, and God bless you richly and for each one for creating the atmosphere this morning. Luke 24:E5. That's where I will take my thought. But I'll read other other scriptures as we will be sitting down. Luke 24 verse 5 can start four and five maybe six to give the context. is the sis or the sisters the woman went at the resurrection. The Bible says verse four and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout. Behold two men stood by them in shining garment. And as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, why seek ye the living among the dead? telling the woman, "Why seeking he the living among the dead? &gt;&gt; He's not here, but he's risen." &gt;&gt; Remember how we spoke unto you when he was yet in Galilee. Let me just go to a word of word of prayer. Father, we thank you for the word of God. This word has not lost its power, Lord. &gt;&gt; As you spoke to the woman, Lord, that why you seeking me among the dead? I'm alive. I'm risen. I'm still the same yesterday, today, and forever. Father, may you change our attitude this morning to seek you among the living, not among the dead because you are still alive. Father, &gt;&gt; Father, bless this word to our heart and help us to accept it this morning with humility and love for you from you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I have a seat? Amen. This is where I'm taking I said I'm taking my thought. Um um first of all thank the Lord for the good Friday service. I think it was a good service and uh &gt;&gt; brother Brent um it was good that he accepted the invitation and &gt;&gt; it's been a blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And for those could stream or attend the meetings there as well. It was also good service. Uh my voice is a little bit not faithful this morning and been think I'm fighting something but the devil is trying to put something on me. I'm putting back I'm rejecting that. So it is not manifested yet. But uh uh just a little bit struggling sometimes. So um the angel told the woman, "Yeah, you come and you come here and you are so perplexed. You are so confused. You look so confused. You still think that he's dead. That's your attitude." Say, "But why are you you you're looking you're looking at the wrong place. This is an empty tomb. This is not here anymore. &gt;&gt; Why are you having that? Why are you thinking that he's still here?" Remember what he told you? He told you that on the third day I will be risen. But why are you coming and checking it? Why are you looking at the wrong place? This is the wrong place to look for him. Look at the place where he gave you the promise. Because he's risen. Because he's he's alive. He's living. You should not be sad. You should not be think looking at the problem. You should not looking at the worries. You should not That's not the attitude. No, you should be happy because he's risen. The Lord is risen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's have everything under control. Amen. Glory to his name. &gt;&gt; So I'll read Matthew 27. Some of the scripture that the prophet read as I go to the scripture with you this morning just to give some comment. Matthew 27 with that thought in in the mind. I think Luke is the one who who brought that that idea or that that that expression. You know all the four gospel if you want to read the resurrection not all of them are taking all the details. So you have to read all the four gospels to really get that picture of what is going on and to see because each one is focusing on one thing or the the other depending on the inspiration that God gave them and also the anointing that was on each and everyone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I go in Matthew 27 62 start from 2762 just before the resurrection. Now the next day that followed the day of preparation the chief priests and the Pharisees came together unto Pilate. They're saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days I will rise again. &gt;&gt; Think about it. The unbelievers were remembering what the Lord Jesus Christ said &gt;&gt; but the real believer could not remember what he told them. So the unbelievers out of fear that oh you we because they knew he was the true messiah. They they knew it. Nicodemus knew it. But they were just because of jealousy, because of the system they were in. They knew that whatever he said, he will he will accomplish what he said. But they were so scared for it being true. But they still remember it. But the true believers who were supposed to take to take action or to remember what he told them and on that third day to be expecting him to be raised. They were perplexed. They were confused. They didn't bless the scriptures. But these unbelievers, they come to try to stop the fulfillment of the scripture of God. But whatever they try to do can never stop the resurrection. You could never stop the resurrection. It had to happen because prophecy had to be fulfilled. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They say after three days I will rise again. Say, command therefore that the sepico be made sure until the third day. Until the third day, so that even more precise on what the what he had talked that in three days I will rebuild this temple again. &gt;&gt; Oh my, lest his disciple come by night and steal him away and say unto the people is risen from the dead. So the last error shall be worse than the first. Oh, actually it's not an arrow. It's the truth. &gt;&gt; The last truth shall be better than the first truth. So Pilate said unto them, you have a watch. Go your way. Make it as sure as you can. So there it's not it was not it was not the tomb where the you could just if it was risen it could just open the door nicely and come out. They made sure that he was completely sealed that that stone was really blocking him inside there. Amen. Think about it 2,000 years ago. And so they went and made a separate shoe sealing the stone and setting a watch. So they put a stone there. I was checking what kind what kind of the seal was that the Roman was putting there and and the internet is saying that actually it was very hard to break that seal. It was very it's not it was not that I described in the many detail. I didn't take all the detail but they were saying that it was actually not one person could break that seal. You have to have a lot a big group of people to try to break one seal that the Roman seal were putting if they want to seal a house want to seal a prison. It was not just a easy you know like like the ceiling of our doors that you can just push and then we break. No, they make sure that you really completely seal that cannot come of it. Let me tell you, whatever the enemy is trying to block on your life, it can never stop the promise of God to be fulfilled. Amen. So they seal it properly so that you make sure that you cannot come of it. But the Bible says in the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn towards the first day of the week came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the supper and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and he sat upon that storm. The same thing that was trying to block him, he rolled it with just his finger with the tip of his finger to remove it to show the power of God and himself went down and set upon that storm. &gt;&gt; Whatever is trying to disturb you, let me the mighty angel is here to step on that stone and tell you that you can rise from that problem that you are going through. &gt;&gt; The Bible says his countenance was like lightning and his remnant white as snow. for fear him the keepers did shake those who were standing there for watch to prevent him from coming out. They were there and shaking and he became as dead man. And the angel answered and said unto the woman, fear he not for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified. So that the scripture that that Luke is putting there that the angel talking to them I know fear not for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified is not here for risen as he said come and see the place where the Lord lays and go quickly and tell his disciples that he's risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into Galilee there shall ye see him lo I have told you. Amen. Oh, praise be to God. We thank God for the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like to preach about resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation 11:17, prophet use a scripture as well. And Easter Seal and the rising of the the sun, I believe. Just want to read as well. This is John as you saw in the aisle of Patmos. John 11:17 says when I saw him a Revelation 11:17, sorry, Revelation 117, sorry. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead, and he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not. I am the first and the last. I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold, I am alive forever more. Amen. And I have the keys of hell and of death. Amen. Now you possess everything under his control. I have the keys of hell and death. It's not under the hands of the enemy anymore. Even Satan doesn't have the key of his own house. He doesn't have the key of hell that has been prepared for him. But God has everything under his hand. Everything under his control. That's why if I leave, you shall live as well. Because he live, we can face our tomorrows. Because he live, we should not have any fear. Because he live, we know that he knows our tomorrow. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the God eternal one. Romans 8:11. And I'll be coming back to that as well at some point. Just put the introduction this morning. Just bring the word of God to remembrance uh to stir your mind and your spirit through the remembrance of the word of God. Romans 8:11. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the resurrection is by the spirit that is dwelling in you. Amen. As we went through this week as a prophet will say it's a wonderful week. If there was anything any week we could remember in our Christian ministry and walk is is this week that we went we are going through or we are finishing now. Amen. The Easter week says, "Remember Jesus was a sheep. He was a lamb. But in this case, he became a goat. He was righteous because he was God. He was God the sheep. He come a goat sin. But he might be the sin offering for me and for you from a sheep to a goat." Jesus was represented in both animals, both goat. One he died. He died for the atonement. just put it as a statement to show his death and then his burring his rising and what he has done for our life. Amen. I said the second the sins from the atonement was put on the scapegoat and the scapegoat took the sins of the people went far into the wilderness to bear the sins of the people. What was it? It was the death and the burial of our Lord Jesus Christ. Says living the Lord loved me. Dying he saved me. buried. He carried my sins far away. He took the sins of the people upon himself and carried them plumbed down into the lowest of Hades. He was the sin offering. He had the sins of the people. He died for them. Do you believe that he died for you? &gt;&gt; Amen. He died for you. And and also the sins was placed upon him. He took our sins far away so far that God could never remember, could never see them no more. Think of it. The church could scream hallelujah for such a savior. Amen. For such a savior who can take your sins and carry them far away to never remember them anymore. You take your sins, your pastor sins. As a brother Brent said, the pastor sins but also your future sins because we are human beings. We make mistakes. We die daily. Even our future sins are already taken far away to God. For a Christian, a Christian who's born again of God can never sin because sin is unbelief. You don't disbelieve consciously. Amen. You are not disbelieving but you make mistakes. Amen. Sometimes you make iniquities. Amen. Or you commit iniquities because you know the truth but you steal by your flesh because under pressure and you fall. Amen. But all those sins, all those iniquities, he has already bore upon himself. He took them far away to never remember them anymore. That's the power of our Lord Jesus Christ. So as he was into the grave, he didn't just die for the sake of dying. Amen. He died with a purpose. He had a purpose in mind because he was thinking of you. He was thinking of me. Amen. As he died, he took those sins of far. He became actually sin. He be he not only bore the sins but he became sin. Amen. He became even the the the our self even more than ourselves. He went to the very bottom where we should have been gone. It should have been our place. But he took our place. He went into hell to for our place because the judgment has to be paid. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said not only is our sins forgiven, but they are buried in the sea of forgetfulness to be remembered no more. Buried, he carried my sins far away. No more can they be remembered for they are gone. They are out of the eyes of God. The righteous God cannot stand sin. They're taken out of the eyes of God. They are paralyzed. Amen. The sins are paralyzed. They are divorced. They're taken away. They put away. God doesn't remember them no more. The church ought to rejoice this morning to know that our sins will no more be remembered. Amen. They are put in the sea of forgetfulness into the grave of beyond any resurrection. They are put into the lake where there is no fishing anymore. But but you can't bring them back again. You sometimes it ask even reminding God about our sins. God remember I did this 10 years ago. God look it looks like I'm going back again. But the God doesn't remember them. And what are you talking about? God who is the infinite God has the ability to be infinite in forgetting. Amen. Oh, praise be to God. &gt;&gt; God who knows everything doesn't know our sin. Oh, he knows everything but he doesn't know our sin. He allows himself not to know our sins. Amen. Oh. Oh, we can say I said it this week. I've been repeating that many times, but every time I say it just blows my mind. Every time I said, "Oh god, I can't I can't imagine. I can't comprehend it. I can't understand it with my with my with my with my aunt or maybe my my insect insect memory." But God, infinite God cannot remember our sins. Cannot remember. He says they are dead. They are put to remember no more. Says, say they are put in the sea of forgiveness into the into the grave of beyond any resurrection. And they are dead forever and and they're forever and forgotten about. They are as if they had never happened. As if they have never happened. So he brought her to full reconciliation with him. Said dying he saved me but buried he carried my sins far away. He carried them so far till they went into the sea of forgetfulness. Oh we know that those things are most surely believed among us. But they are most surely the truth. They are God's truth. Amen. All those great things were beyond human expression. Even though we rejoice, but we can never express it the real way the way it should. We could never express our gratitude for such things as this. Amen. Oh, glory be to to his name. But not only were they buried, many people not only Jesus was buried, many people were buried. Many people have been buried. But this burial was to take our sins far away from the presence of God. That's different from the burial of any other person. As his death was different from any other person, no one could die as Jesus died because it was God in the human flesh in taking the human flesh to die on our place. Amen. No one could die as us. The prophet say no one lived as him. No one could die as him. Amen. We were not made in a point of coming to the point where we can die where the blood and and the water can get separated from our bodies. Only him could come to that point because he didn't die because of the of the spears. He didn't die because of the nails or didn't die because of the bleeding. He died because of the grief. Amen. He came to his own and his own did not receive him. That's why he could come to the point of dying like that. Amen. And now also as he was buried, he was buried as different as other people could have be buried because his burial was to take our sins far away from the presence of God. But also as he not only buried but he also risen from the dead. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because many people died. Many prophet even did many great things. But he is the only one who could die and also come back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Many people could raise the dead. You know that many prophet raised the dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. Elisha raised the dead and then raised the dead. Many people raised the dead. Many prophet raised the Jesus Christ raised the dead. So Lazarus died and Jesus rose him back. Amen. Many people die. So dying and coming back. Yeah, that's a miracles. But the fact that he came back the resurrection by itself is not is not only a miracle. It's not as a big miracle as should. But the difference is he gave his life and he took back it back himself. No one was able to give his life and take it back himself. That was the greatest miracle. He could die and take it back himself. Amen. The same Holy Spirit that was him, that's the same spirit that raised him from the dead. Amen. That same spirit that raised him from the dead as we spoke like that day is the same spirit God has sent into us. Amen. That's what makes the resurrection special. Amen. Because it's God himself giving himself life back to himself. Amen. Oh, wonderful. Listen to other prophecies. What was that raising up? It was God's receipt that the bill has been paid. Rising is justified freely forever. What a savior rising. What God has done. A man can suffer. A man can die. A man can be buried. But Easter was the greatest of them all. For it was God's endorsement. My laws has been met. My requirement has been met that him. He rose him up from the dead. He rose him up from the dead. Rising is justified freely forever. Blessed be his holy name. No wonder it brings emotions. Amen. No wonder the human heart can never contain it. With our conquering faith, we can stand yonder and say we are justified freely forever because he died and he was buried and was and God raised him up again on Easter morning. Then God showed that it was accepted. All the things that he did was accepted. Amen. He could he died. He he paid for our price. He was buried. He took our sins far away. But all that had to be accepted. The way to show that he has been accepted was God to raise him up again. He had to raise him up to show that I have accepted what he have done. If all these things were done and there was no resurrection, it would have been been a missed target. Amen. But thank God he raised him up from the dead to say I have accepted everything that you have done. My people can declare now they are free. Amen. Justified forever. Amen. as if as if you have never done it to begin with. &gt;&gt; So then God show that he raised him up again on this. God showed that he accepted all the things that he did. Everything is freely paid. You can go free now. Rising is justified freely forever. No one can never know can never think of that great day when he rose up. And the angels saw it in the heavens of heaven. The angels sang the praises of God and rejoiced. While the Old Testament saints in paradise shouted, "Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Is risen." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we call it the Easter Seal. The boy call it's a Easter Seal. It sealed the word of God forever for the true believer. The Easter Seal prove that what he talked, what he said, what he promised has been the truth. Amen. what he said. He could also confirm by the resurrection that what everything I've been saying has been the truth because I gave my life and I can take it back myself. Amen. The Holy Spirit rose him up from the from the grave. All gloom, all doubt are shattered at that blessful morning. Oh, man had been shut up. It was in a prison house even to religious people before this day because because they seen great religions move moving of the Holy Spirit and so forth. But when a man died, it seemed to settled. When this one came, he said, "I have power to lay my life down. I have power to take it up again." Moses was a great man. Elijah was a great man. Isaiah was a great man. Jeremiah was a great man. All the prophet was a great man. John the Baptist was a great man. But no one could die and come back by himself. Amen. But this man when he comes, he could lay down his life and and bring it back again. Because he lives, you shall live as well. Amen. He prove that his word is true. So you can rely upon his own word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, we should never take lightly the great resurrection of God. My prayer is that each one of us know God in the power of the resurrection &gt;&gt; to know him to realize that I have myself also a Easter with God. I was raised with Jesus Christ as well. God make that a reality in my heart Lord that I have I know you in the power of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I have power to take it up again. Then God prove what is said to me that that's the seal of it. When something is said and then is turned around and proven, it is the ultimate proof because it show the only thing that no one else could defeat. &gt;&gt; No matter how great you are, no matter how rich you are, no matter how many miracles you have performed, even if you have raised the dead, you can't raise yourself up. No matter what you can do, you can't raise yourself up. Glory to God. Only one person could give his life and take it back is our Lord Jesus Christ. Now one man has conquered death. That's why we call it the seal of God. The Easter Seal. It's sealed the word of God. He confirmed that he was God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God. I want to praise. I want to glorify him. I want to raise him up because he's the only one who deserve to be glorified. Is the one to be worshiped. Is one to say, "God, you are worthy of everything." Amen. I don't want to look to you to search for you among the dead. We mean I don't want to look to you only a god of history. &gt;&gt; I want the God of today. Yes. You are the same God because it's you who did that. It's you who sent the prophet. It's you who confirmed your word. You can confirm your word in my life today. Amen. You are the same yesterday, today and forever. Resurrection yesterday, but resurrection today as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says, "When he proved by his promise the great conquering power that he had on Easter, he proved that he could conquer death, hell, and the grave. I am he that was dead and is alive again and alive forever more. And I have the keys to death and hell and the grave." What a statement for anyone to make. Not only did he make it, but he had already proved it. He had what he claimed to have. Amen. The only one who could claim what he had to have. That's why our Christian religion is the only one that has an empty tomb. No other religion has an empty tomb. Only a Christian religion has an empty tomb. You can search him everywhere. You can't find his bones because he's risen from the dead. Amen. That proves to me that he is the God of the dead, the God of the living. He could raise the dead and back to life again. The quickening power, the quickening spirit of his has proved through the years that he is the one who can quicken the dead back to life again. Amen. He showed that he defeated Satan. He defeated Satan completely. Satan certainly didn't know who he was. But after the resurrection, oh certainly he knows who he is because he met him beyond there. You know when he went when he was buried there, he met him over there. Satan was waiting for him. I Oh, I got him. I think he's just like the other prophet. Let me wait for him here as he's coming over there. Let me see how I'm going to put him again in this in this place here that they called the paradise. I'm going to put him like the other prophet. As he's coming there, Satan was is he like the other prophet or what's going as he come there you see declared to him Satan you see my blood there is not the blood of a prophet. It's not the blood of Mary. It's not the blood of any other human. It's the blood of God himself. It was the creative cell of God. It was the blood of God himself. I'm not saved by the blood of the Jew. I'm not saved by the blood of Gentile. I'm saved by the blood of God himself. That's my blood is still fresh there. So give me those key Satan. Amen. &gt;&gt; African preacher say kick Satan. &gt;&gt; Have a preacher use even an African native language. Kick him properly. Give me those key. &gt;&gt; So he was going out. He said there is nobody else that believed him. Way over yond in paradise there is a group of believer couldn't enter into the presence of the father because they went under the burnt offering. Sheep goats sprinkling of ashes. They could not go in the presence of the father because animal blood would not could not atone for sin. That's why they were put in that temporary place called paradise because they couldn't go in in a place. They couldn't go in the presence of God. They had to wait there. No matter how saint they were, no matter Oh, they've done great things. By faith, Abel did it. By faith, Abraham did this. By faith, Enoch did this. By faith, all these, you know, Enoch was in the presence of God. But by by faith, all the others, they couldn't come in the presence of God because they were under that blood. It says it was just a substitute. There was the place called paradise. It's getting towards break of day. So the morning of the break of day, I can see him as he comes up to that door. Brother Bam, the Bible, the the translator says, "Brother Bam knocks four times." Sarah said, "Abraham, go open the door. See who that is." That &gt;&gt; Abraham walks out and opens the door and said, "Come here, honey. Come and see. Look and see." Oh, who's standing there? that the same one that come and eat with us that day under the or is the same one. I know he's the Messiah. He's the one who came in type but he's there. Amen. Says, "Oh, about that time I can see Daniel saying, what did you say?" Oh, he said, "Oh, there is that the stone I saw who of the mountain. There he is." is the Messiah is there. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to them. Ezekiel said, "What did you say, Daniel?" Yeah. So there he is is the will in the middle of the wheel. That's what I prophesied about. This is now the fulfillment. Amen. The scent of all could see that and rejoice. Now we are here on the other side. We could look back and say that's the same. Amen. But not only there, but he's also here. [Music] &gt;&gt; He said, and Job jumped and said, what did you say? He said, that one I saw. I said, "I know my redeemer liveth. At the last day he will stand upon the earth. Though the skin worms destroyed his body, yet in my flesh I shall see God." Say there he is that him. I recognize him. The prophet and said looked upon and recognized him. They were waiting for him. Say children get ready. We are going out there. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I'm so glad that my book my name or my book is on or my app in heaven. The prophecy, my name is on the register. I'm so glad that my sins are under the blood signed pardoned. &gt;&gt; It says by his own precious blood. I'm so glad that I know him. The prophet says, I'm sure that every Christian can say amen to God. &gt;&gt; Are you happy for the resurrection this morning? &gt;&gt; So, I'm glad that one of these mornings he will come for us. I can hear Abraham say, "What did you say, Lord?" He said I'm always it's almost daylight on it's not Sunday morning that early morning. So it's almost daylight on earth. You remember on the third day I had to rise. So they had a a little bit of fellowship behind there. It's almost morning according to the scriptures. I have to rise. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Says well that's right. I hear Abraham say listen God. Can we make a little whistle stop? Sarah and I have been wanting to look around the old land for a long time. Can we make just a little whistle stop and said, "Oh, I'm going to walk to talk to my disciple for 30 days, for 40 days. You can have plenty of time on Easter morning when the sun was about ready to shine. The morning star come from the skies and rolled back the stop sun, the the storm storm." And the Bible said many of those saints that slept in the dust of the earth rose and come up in the city and appeared to many. Amen. So in that morning as they come out from that place, oh many saints came up with him as well. People could now notice them. Oh, oh, oh, this is a stranger here. What what's going on here? I never I never seen this one. Oh, that lovely couple Abraham and and Sarah young and walking resurrection power. Amen. The first resurrection. Now remember the second resurrection. Our first resurrection for the bride. Now what will happen? There will be also a 40 days for us as a type where we will see our loved ones coming. Oh, I see my mother there. I see my father there. I see my older brother there. I see the saints there. I use I see that brother there. Oh, what a day that looking forward for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Matthew 27:42 just to confirm what the Bible says. And the graves was open, many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many. &gt;&gt; So as say the old animal lamp was a type and his blood could never could never take away sins. He just covered sins. Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, Satan still had control over the keys over there. But the reason there was a place called paradise and the gathering of the fathers where the old tent went where they died. But when Jesus died, sin wasn't covered. It was divorced and done away with. But when Jesus died, sin wasn't only covered, but was divorced and done away with it. Then he emptied paradise and led captive captive and give gift unto man. The Old Testament saints went with him after his resurrection and appeared in the city appeared before many people that in the city. Matthew 27. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Now then we go we go into the presence of the father waiting the second coming of the Lord." It says, "Now after Jesus resurrection, the old saint of the Old Testament come out of the graves and went into glory with the Lord Jesus Christ according to Matthew 27." That's right. Now when we go we go into the presence of the father waiting the second coming of the lord now there is no guess work on it all finished work that's why we don't feel there amen because the the price has already been paid the gap is only a door to go to another dimension actually it's just heaven is not very far it's just another dimension there just another few me few meters amen We're going the other side. So I just saw my body over there. He had the proof that that land is real. Pastor preached one time, heaven is real. Amen. It's a real place. It's not a myth. It's not an imagination. It's a real place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the price has already been paid. Amen. &gt;&gt; Coming back to the idea, the Pharisees and Satan had tried by all means to try to keep him from the grave. They put the best gods they could find. They put a big stone. They put a Roman seal to make sure that no one could open it. The Bible says they made the separ. Let's keep him inside. Let's make sure that that the resurrection doesn't happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's keep the son of God there. Let's make sure that nothing happens to him. Let's put the Roman seal to keep the germ of life from coming forth. No stone could keep him from coming forth. Unfortunately, amen. The scripture says it had to be fulfilled. He broke the seal. Amen. May God break the seal of our life. anything that is hindering us, anything that is blocking us, anything that is keeping you down, may God break the seal in our life on this Easter Seal and break that. Let the life of God come forth. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what the enemy has tried to put on you to prevent you from believing this message, one day when the light strike that seed in your soul, a seed in your heart, no matter what the devil has tried in your life, maybe put you down, maybe you go in a path in in a very dark path in your youth, maybe went to a different place, maybe the devil has tried to do many things in your life, but when that light strike your the seed in your heart, Nothing could stop you from responding to the word of God. I am a son of God. I am a daughter of God. Who did that? It's the power of the resurrection in your heart. You already had the resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet says, I'm going to inject a little thought here and think that it's a Baptist and you'll think it's a Baptist, but it's not. The Bible, there was those welltrained scholar looked upon that sign that he had and called him a devil. But here is a prostitute, but in her lay that predestinated seed of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She never seen nothing like that. As soon as that light struck that seed, life sprung up. It had life in it to begin with. It says the same like you in in the natural it fall of the year. The seeds die and go down into the dirt. But let that sound just strike it. If the germ of life, the germ of life is there, it will spring to life. This woman had a horrible she was predestinated. Her name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. And when she see that light of God spring, nothing could hold her. It sprang to life. The Pharisees, they look white from the outside, but they were dark inside. She was dark from the outside, but inside there was that seed journey of God. Amen. When the lights come and she saw that, she responded to that light. No matter what the enemy is trying to put down, to put in darkness, to put the seal, to put the seal upon our life, to put a definition upon our life. You are a prostitute. You can't mix with the others and every other thing. But God had a different plan for her. God had different vision for her. He knew her before the foundation of the world. God knew you before the foundation of the world. Nothing can change his love for you because he already loved you. You already accepted in him. Amen. So when he died, you died with him. When he rose from the grave, you rose with him. Amen. That's why you are part of him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God. When we see that, oh, it just makes you to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Thank God for your grace in my life. Thank you for choosing me. Not today, choosing me before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Glory to your name. Amen. &gt;&gt; When educated priests they said well the the the that holy father so and so I don't care what it was Jesus said you are with your father the devil and his works you do that prostitute said you must be the messiah &gt;&gt; says when he told her he was she was convinced what that predestinated seed when the light first shine she recognized it. Amen. And the same thing happened to you and me. Says you believe that we shall rise in him. We become part of him. The Easter, the revealed secret of God like it was then of life after death. We are now alive who were once dead in sin and trespasses. The true seal seal, the true Easter seal has broken death from around me and I'm alive. The Easter seal at the beginning broke all the seal of the Roman seal. The Easter seal that was that that he was sealed up and man they died and and was gone. But he broke that seal and reveal your secret. Now God by his holy spirit has broken the seal from around our lives and Christ is revealed as he lives in us. Amen. So let that seal be broken. Amen. So that Christ can be revealed in us. Now we are quickened with him. Oh, amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. &gt;&gt; As we read in the Bible, and behold, there was a great earthquake and the angel of the Lord descended from heaven came and sat and came and rolled up the stone from the door and sat upon it. It means he controls. You think that the situations and situ and situation and circumstances are controlling you? No. The angel will roll back the stone and will control. That's what said fear not. &gt;&gt; Fear not. &gt;&gt; Fear is the biggest curse can be put upon on the believer because it paralyzes your faith. Fear or what if this happen? What if this happen? Oh, sometimes you know how many remember during COVID you hear so much negative things and you start feeling like you have it. So you know what? Oh, if you're in a shower, you feel like you don't you don't breathe properly in shower. The symptom of a co that is not manifested here. So every as I'm taking a shower, I feel like no you don't just feel. Oh my. Oh, that's the trouble with people tonight. The prophet said, you are scared. The biggest curse that there is on the full gospel people or any other people is because you are afraid. God has made a provision but you are afraid to take the word for it. We should not take what the devil is giving. We take what the word of God is giving. We should put our trust in the word of God. If Jesus Christ was the manifested word, the anointed word and he had to believe the word of God. Jesus Christ went into the grave believing one scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. I shall not leave my anointed one unto the grave. He shall not see corruption upon one scriptures. But he knew that God cannot break his own word. On the third day I shall come up again. If God if God Jesus Christ could go into the grave with one scriptures how many how much more us as a believer we can face Laia with God's promises in our time. Amen. I will have a bride and God has a bride. Amen. No matter what Leesia is putting upon you, you shall be an overcomer because he lives. You shall live as well. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Since that one of the scriptures that more neglected, there's going to one part where it's been accepted, but I think I I'll skip that part where just to show has been accepted. But when you see him in the evening, Jesus Jesus Christ, it means the sacrifice has been accepted. Because the Bible says in Hebrews 9, but but Christ being come and a high priest of good things to come by his own blood, he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. It's not a partial redemption, is eternal redemption because we already been part of him. Now he's bringing us back to our position. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we were him. We were with him. We got lost. Amen. We put a we put a pawn shop and then now he comes and he's looking for us. Like that that like that eagle. Mother eagle is looking for I know that I have my son. I know I have I had another egg. I know but someone took it from him. But I will go and search for him. It's not someone was looking for you. It was God was looking for you. It was the eagle was looking for you. It's the Holy Ghost was going and find you. Amen. It's God who called you, not man called you. If someone called you, oh, you need to reject that calling again. It has to be God calling you. Amen. If God calls you, reveals to you the word of God. You should be thankful because God called you. If God call you, no one can take you out. No one can can remove you from the church. No one can remove you from the message. The message and you you are one. Amen. You are part of the message. I'm the message. I'm the revival. I'm the proof of the resurrection. Can you tell me that Jesus Christ is raised from the dead? I'm the proof of the resurrection. Look, I was dead, but now I'm alive. The same spirit that was in God in Jesus Christ, the same spirit is in me. &gt;&gt; I'm the proof of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Eternal redemption. So he says I like that story of of the of the saints going into the the city. Says I'm going up for 40 days a night with my disciple and go to them for some lecturers before they go. So we are going to make a little whistle stop and stop that place. And about that time the angel of God rolled away the stone. Then the Bible continues. and says and I rose out of the grave in mortal bodies like the old said when what I can see kaifas standing say what is all that noise this morning you priests the priests say I don't know the only thing there are people appearing everywhere around the cities here some of them claim they are all saints they are resurrected well kifa says I don't know say say what is that young couple coming there says it's Sarah and Abra I'm walking along and say look here honey you remember that old place where we come down that hill yonder yeah I remember that oh we are we are being watched oh we are being watched I was just vanished just like the kind of the body had right into the building through the walls they didn't even know oh his glorious body they were walking here on earth and appearing to people hallelujah yes they are 40 days so they have a body they just coming and disappearing coming and disappear coming and disappear When I look at that to say, "Oh God, thank you. Thank you. We are going our future is better. Our future is brighter." Amen. We will have a body like his glorious body. If in the type if even in the first resurrection that he did there and the first coming of the Lord, he did like this. What about our second coming when he shall come, we shall have glorious body like his own body. Thank God for the resurrection. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Says and here goes up. I can see Sarah. So, here they go passing the moon and the stars. Jesus at a head. The Old Testament behind him walking saying, "Hallelujah." They come in sight of the big great city yonder that built four squares polygaras. I can hear all the Old Testament said with the great victor walking into the front of them, great conqueror. He is a mighty conqueror since he ran to the veil in two. Here he is with the Old Testament saying I can hear them. Hold up. Lift up he everlasting gates and be lifted up. Let the king of glory come in. I hear the angels say what was that? They say lift up he everlasting gates and be lifted up. Let the king of glory come in. I can hear the angels hold. Who is the king of glory? And they answer the Lord of hosts mighty in battle is the king of glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The old saint they just had a resurrection. They experienced that and they know that what how real it was and this is what what they going through. But let me remind you and remind you this is what we are going to go through as well. Amen. We there will be a body change one time. There will be a resurrection one time. But to be part of that body chain, to be part of that resurrection, you need to have a resurrection of the soul now. Amen. You need to have a quickening of the Holy Spirit now. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I want to make that transitions. We need the quickening of the Holy Spirit. Now see Jesus Christ blood just as sufficient it is. yesterday, today, and forever. To every age, to save every sinner, heal every sick person, bring every miracle, every sign to pass, seven times way back beyond in the Old Testament, 1490 years before Christ. Think of it. It says in the high priest with Jesus Christ, that is more sufficient for every day of our work. But in 1 Corinthians 15:17 says, "If Christ be not raised, our faith is vain." That's right. you are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept. So if Christ died, it was not just for him is to show an example that there will be others who will come after me who can who will be raised from the dead as well. So it was the first fruit of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all died, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in own in his own order, Christ the first fruit, afterward they that are Christ at his coming. Let me say though this I'm changing a bit the angle here. Most people believe in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. Many churches celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. They put it but the only thing they put it in historical event &gt;&gt; which is true which is rejoice about. Amen. But they feel disconnected from that historical event because that's what happened there. We rejoice today. But it's not only a historical event. It is a historical event but have consequences today. &gt;&gt; Amen. and also similarities on what God is doing today. And that's the part they are missing. Amen. No, they're not good people. They're very good people. We thank all them. But we thank God for bring that connection of what he has done and what he's doing now. And we thank God for what he's also doing now. Because what a resurrection it was then, but what a resurrection this is is as well to bring us to the same body change, to the same victory, to the same resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you are not and should not be disconnected from from the first resurrection or the the resurrection of Jesus Christ because he did he did so so that he can become the first fruit. The prophet says this wonderful Easter morning Jesus was alive and among the people. What a type it is today. What a type it is today that being on the Easter again Jesus is risen from the dead. And as he went about, many of his dear people, people who loved him, people who believed in him, they didn't know that he was alive. And so is he today. There's many good, honestarted Christian people who doesn't realize that Jesus Christ is alive and among us today. They fail to recognize that. They believe, oh, he died for my sins. They accept that he rose again and he's up in heaven somewhere, but he isn't. The prophet says in the resurrection of Jesus, but isn't is right here on earth in the form of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I will be with you to the end of the world. Not I'll be up in heaven looking down at you. I will be with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet says one place said I will be in you to the end of the world. &gt;&gt; He will be he I he will be with us even in us to the end of the world. He says I not someone else. I I will be to the end of the world. I is a personal pronoun and I will be with you to the end of the world. Amen. So we need to have that experience of God is with me but not only with me, God is in me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As Jesus says in 14 John 14:19, "Yet a little while and the world see me no more, but ye see me because I live, you shall live also." That's why we sing that song. Because he lives, I can face tomorrow because he lives with me. Jesus Christ was a wave shift. Amen. Showing that there are more in the field that must come to the same maturity. If the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you, it shall quicken also your mortal bodies. the spirit that dwells in you. Colosians likes to put emphasis on that. Colossians 1:18 says, "He is the head of the body, the church who is the beginning, the first born from the dead, that in all things you might have the preeminence." &gt;&gt; Paul here is pointing the first rise from the dead in a glorified eternal body, leading the way of who will be resurrected through him. Revelations 15 from Jesus Christ who is faithful witness the first begotten of the dead the prince of the of the earth as we read at the beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen with me. So here that we are living the time we are living. I believe we have the same evidence that Paul had. Yeah, &gt;&gt; Paul Paul did not was not in the time of Jesus Christ when when he was on earth, but he had the proof of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; He had the affirmation and the evidence of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. First of all, he saw the pillar of fire and the pill of fire talked to him says, "I'm Jesus Christ that you are persecuting." Paul recognized that that pill of fire can only be God. He knew it can only be God and it was the Lord Jesus Christ. So through that Paul recognized and saw that the same God of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ in the New Testament. Jehovah the Old Testament is Jesus Christ in the New Testament. But also he had the proof that Jesus who died is Jesus who rose from the dead because he could speak to me. He's alive. He's real. Amen. He had that evidence. No one could tell him out. No one could take him out of that evidence that Jesus Christ is alive because he saw the pillow fire. &gt;&gt; Do you remember the story when someone challenged an evangelist somewhere I think in India or somewhere maybe maybe state I need to read the story again just to refresh my memory but he challenged that evangelist or that preacher say you know how what can difference can you make between Mad Mo and and Jesus? You believe in Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; what difference can you me give you give me? &gt;&gt; I usually give that challenge to my wife sometimes. What proof do you have that Jesus Christ is alive? &gt;&gt; If I'm if I if I if I if I'm Mohamad, what what can you give me as a proof? I say, okay, no, he's risen from the dead, you know, and he gave that he's risen from the dead and and and he's alive. I Muhammad can say, no, Muhammad is alive, too. And what what what can you say then you know uh then he went there another proof say no you know what but um but he he's in my soul so oh Mohammed is in my soul too so what proof what's the difference and then he says but but he one part he means to say he says the life that Jesus had is the same life that we have here because he did not believe that the same thing that Jesus did he can do it and he didn't want to refer him to to the prophet to say you know what maybe I don't have the faith to do everything that Jesus Christ did but I know one who performed the same miracles that Jesus Christ did to prove that Jesus Christ is here and the prophet said that's where he missed amen &gt;&gt; so it's not that you have to prove everything but you can refer and say you know what Jesus Christ is alive because first he has changed my life I used to do certain things the Life of Jesus Christ changed my life. You guys do things by law. You must not do them and not this. But when the priest is not there and then you do certain things. I had friends who were Muslim Muslims. Oh, they do worse things when it's not the time of Ramadan. You wonder, oh wow. So it's by law, but for me it's not by law. It's it comes from the inside. Is the life of Jesus Christ inside of me. but also is performing the same thing that he performed there. He's still healing the sick today. He's still changing the heart today. The se the signs that shall follow those who believe. So it's still the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And in addition to that, God has given me the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; I have seen the pit of fire. God Jesus Christ is raised from the dead. The same pit of fire that Paul saw. The same pit of fire we have seen. We have the evidence. We have the picture. The camera cannot take imaginations. Is the proof that he's risen from the dead. So God has privileged us to give us a better proof that he's risen from the dead. On top of that, brothers and sisters, he has given us the cloud that we can see his face there. Can you see his eyes? Can you see his nose? Can you see his beard? He's alive. Amen. So why are you looking for him in history only? He's here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't look him only among the dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you put in our context. Sometimes we put things only for the time of Paul. &gt;&gt; It's good in time of Paul for the time of of the disciples or the apostles. It's good in time of the apostles. But it's not only the living for the past is the living today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to be the father. We put things only on brother Bham. Oh, we thank God. He was the wave shift to showing that he's the first one where the word of God has come to the maturity. But now each and every one of us, we should come to the same maturity. We should not look for God among the dead and we thank God for their lives but God what about me now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Become a reality to me now. &gt;&gt; Change my heart. move me. Let me have a Easter view. As we're coming to a close, there's still more to say, but I think I put my thought. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to this comment. Why seek ye the living among the dead? These questions also serve as a powerful and far, this is a comment, farreaching invitation for all believers to examine the foundation of their faith and the source of their hope. It urges them not to settle for lifeless traditions, superficial religious practices or beliefs that may sound spiritual but ultimately they are empty and disconnected from the living reality of Christ. Instead, it should challenge the believers to seek true life vibrant, transformative, eternal in the person of Jesus Christ. Lord, give me that reality, the power of the resurrection &gt;&gt; that you are real today. It's a call to turn away from the allure of worldly distractions and fleeting pleasures and to anchor the heart in the risen savior. In doing so, believers are encouraged to live in the fullness of his presence, daily walking with him, drawing strength from his resurrection and holding fast the unshakable promise of eternal life that comes through genuine faith and the Holy Spirit that God has given us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Many people today don't realize that the brother banham says now only those who have their names written on the lamb's book of life and those who have been born again by the holy spirit is a witness of the resurrection. How can you be a witness? Means you you have a reality. You have seen or you have heard or you have experienced it then you can become a witness. Otherwise you just heard from someone and no you can't you can't you can't be a true witness in for for a judgment or for something to give really a proof if you haven't if you just heard it from oh I heard someone say that the prophet picked on that and says the Bible says no man can say Jesus is the Christ only by the Holy Ghost. You might know it by the way of word. You might know it by the way of the pastor or by your mother, by some testimony, but you don't know it yourself until personally he has witnessed to you that he's raised from the dead and lives in your heart. &gt;&gt; True. That's why as Christian who believe this Bible can prove that what we are talking about Christian who believe this Bible can prove what they are talking about that what makes as I said a while ago the salt of the earth that's right the world is looking for that salt when we can prove by our lives and by the bible that our lives are vindicated that the word to be believing today that's the day We are looking for how many desire that God &gt;&gt; I want your life to be manifested in my life. I want that resurrection power to come into my life. The brother prayed at the beginning. I want the reality of Christ to become in my life. I want what the message is talking about to become in my life. Amen. The same thing as of the message. The message the message that sometimes we we may might look the message in the wrong way say no the message you know how you look like you you you're different from other churches and how the different we don't want to be different from other churches we just want the power of the resurrection to become a reality we want the the the same seed that went into into the ground the same thing that come to the maturity become manifest in our life we want to believe the whole word of God we want to believe the whole Bible the friends with other churches. We believe the whole Bible. Amen. We have only one book is the Bible. We only one law is the love of God. Amen. And we want the life of Jesus Christ to become a reality in our heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God has promised us that the same Holy Ghost that is in you is the same Holy Ghost that was in the time of the Lutans, the same Holy Ghost that was in the time of the Pentecostals, the same Holy Ghost that was in the time of the Pentecostals. But now he comes to continue his work beyond that. The Holy Ghost comes to go far beyond the Lutheran, the Methodist and the Pentecostal. The Holy Ghost comes to place us into adoption and into a position of the rapture to put us in the rapturing conditions. Amen. That's where we desire to be God. I want I want the Holy Spirit to bring me into the rapturing condition to give me perfect faith in your word. We have received the perfect word to bring perfect faith. Amen. And the the word of luther could not bring to perfect faith because it was not the perfect word. It was good but was not at the perfection. Methodist was good but was not at the perfection. Pentecostal it was good but it was not at the perfection. But God has restored the whole word. Restore word for fellowship. Restore the whole world to bring us to perfection. Amen. Only perfect word can bring perfect bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says in why the holy ghost is given says the same holy ghost that saved the luttoran that sanctify the pentist that bapt baptize the pentecostals is now setting in order the coming of the lord Jesus Christ. It will be so powerful that body will come into this group, a church that will draw the rest of them from the grave. It will be a resurrection. That's what the Holy Ghost is for. What is the Holy Ghost for? Without us, they cannot be made perfect. They lived one day under that. We live in another day. When the enemy comes like a flood, the spirit of God would raise a standard against it. And we are in that day. Amen. We are in a day now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; We thank God for his death. We thank God for his resurrection. &gt;&gt; We have now the benefit of his death. We have the benefit of his burial. We have also the benefit of his resurrection. Amen. The benefit all the benefit we have now when we are born again. When you have the Holy Spirit inside of you, you are born again. You have a personal re revelation. You have a personal resurrection. You were once dead. We were once dead. But now we are raised from the dead. As Ephesians 2:1 says as I'm closing, who who hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins? wherein in time past you walked according to the course of the world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience, among whom also we all had our conversation in time past in the last of our flesh, fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind. Oh, don't be at that stage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where you're still fighting because you are not born for that. &gt;&gt; You are not ordained for that. You are suffering actually more in being that state. Amen. Oh may God. But we were part in the lust of the flesh and fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind and where by nature the children of the wrath even as adults. But even when we were dead in sins, God has quickened us together with Christ. By grace you are saved and he has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Jesus Christ. that in the ages to come you might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are you saved through faith, not of ourselves. It is the gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not of works lest any man should boast. &gt;&gt; So it's not us, oh I'm I'm better than others. No, it's God's grace my life for opening my eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For raising me from the dead &gt;&gt; and giving the life of Christ. musicians can come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We thank God for his word.

[Music] I love him because he first love me [Music] and purchase my salary on Calary. [Music] tree. &gt;&gt; We just bow our head as the music is playing softly. You know this thought of [Music] sometime thinking like Jesus Christ is is still among the dead. John the Baptist, John the Revelator rather, the book of Revelation, Revelation 5, he was weeping because he see no one was found worthy. He didn't have the proper revelation of what the lamb of God was, what he has done. But thank God there was that elder who cried, "John, weep not, weep not." There's the lion of the tribe of Judah. The lamb of God has already prevailed and he had the revelation now. Oh, he already paid the price. So, he's worthy to take the book to break the seals &gt;&gt; and to reveal the content within. No matter the situation where you might be maybe I've been weeping been, oh God, where are you in my situation? Where are you in my situation? My family, where are you in my situation for the sickness? Where are you in my situation for the financial needs? Where are you, Lord? Where are you, Father? Where are you? But I just want to remember to remind you this morning, he's not dead. He's risen from the dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he could save you by paying the price of him of himself, he's more than able to deliver you from the situation where you are in. Maybe it might be even a spiritual condition. Oh God, I I can't overcome this thing. I I feel bound. This thing seems to have a seal upon me. I feeling darkness. Oh God, where are you? Where are you? I feel perplexed, Lord. But I'm here to remind you, Jesus Christ is not among the dead. He's risen. He can deliver you from that situation you're in. He can break the seal for that situation and give you victory. And you might you will have a V day a V day for your day today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what we desire to have. So let's just raise your hand to him and say Lord I love you and I want to have a Easter in my condition as well. Father Lord we thank you Lord this morning father as we look into what you have done for us 2,000 years ago. Father that you broke the seal of the Roman. Father Lord tried to put you in that condition so that the promise will not be fulfilled. But Father Lord the prophecy had to be fulfilled. You went to the grave and you said before you knew that before corruption set in you raised from the dead because your word can never fail. Father, the same spirit that raised you from the dead to confirm the word of God to fulfill the promise of God, that same Holy Spirit, Father, we welcome it this morning. We invite it in our lives, Father, for those who don't have a personal relationship with you, a closer walk with you, Father. Lord, the Holy Spirit come and break, Father, the chains of the enemy, breaks the feather, breaks the darkness, breaks the seal that's trying to bind them, Father, into darkness. Let the resurrection happen this morning father. Oh God that all of us Lord we can come to know you in a greater way to know you in the power of the resurrection Lord. Father we thank you for the resurrection that is happening in our lives. We thank you father to have changed our conditions. Lord you have changed and removed the darkness. You have removed father all the chains of laudicia. Father we were like that woman. Lord, we were dark in the world, but Father, you took us from our condition, from our thinking, and you have shown us, Father, the resurrection by the word of God, by the Holy Spirit, by the quickening power, Father. We thank you, Father, the resurrection that is happening in our days. Thank you, Lord. And we are looking forward for that great day or that morning, Father, when the last trump shall sound, Lord, when the dead will be risen and we shall see our loved ones, Lord. Father, you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. As we continue this journey in this earth, Father, help us to labor for you, to express our love towards you, to love you more. Father, God, change our weeping into joy, to rejoice in the promise of God. It's already done. It's a finished work. Father, no matter the circumstances, I just look out to Christ. He's risen. He will give me. He has already paid the price for my healing. Pray the price for the salvation. Pay the price for my family. Pay the price for my situations. Pay the price for my financial needs. Pay the price for my sickness. He's already paid. Father, pay the price even for my rapture. Pay the price for the resurrection. Thank you, Father. Lord Jesus Christ.
