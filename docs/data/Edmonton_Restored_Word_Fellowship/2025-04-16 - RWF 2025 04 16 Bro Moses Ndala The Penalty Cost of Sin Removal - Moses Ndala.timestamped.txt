[36:48] them richly. Those who couldn't make it,

[36:55] those, Lord, Father, have become, Lord's
[36:57] lukewarm, remember them as well, Father.

[38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I will invite you to go to the
[38:06] word of God. It's a prayer meeting. I
[38:10] made myself
[38:12] decision not to prepare a lot where I'm
[38:15] not carried away. So if my cup is empty,
[38:19] I quit.
[38:23] So
[38:25] um so just go to the word of God in
[38:29] Isaiah chapter 3 and the prayer was just
[38:32] in line for what I wanted to share. I I
[38:34] I had a thought to continue on what I
[38:36] preach on Sunday, but I was just
[38:39] listening to brother Banam this to
[38:41] prepare for Easter and just turn my my
[38:45] thought to go to this one and just to to
[38:47] share the few thought on this prayer
[38:49] meeting.
[38:59] Isaiah 53
[39:02] familiar scripture
[39:04] prophet used it. Um
[39:11] I'll read to verse six five and I'll let
[39:15] you sit and I'll continue.
[39:18] Isaiah 53
[39:21] verse one. who had believed our report
[39:25] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[39:27] revealed? For he shall grow up before
[39:30] him as a tender plant and as a root out
[39:33] of a dry ground yet no form nor
[39:36] comeliness but when we shall see him
[39:39] there is no beauty that we should desire
[39:41] him. It's talking about the Lord Jesus
[39:44] Christ is despised and rejected of men,
[39:47] a man of sorrows and acquainted with
[39:50] grief. and we hid as it were our faces
[39:53] from him. He was despised and we
[39:56] esteemed him not. Surely he has borne
[39:59] our griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet
[40:03] we did esteem him, stricken, smitten of
[40:06] God and afflicted. But he was wounded
[40:09] for our transgressions. He was bruised
[40:12] for our iniquities. The chastisement of
[40:15] our peace was upon him and with his
[40:18] stripes we are healed. Amen. May God
[40:21] bless his word. Can have a seat. As
[40:24] relied in verse four here say, "Surely
[40:27] he has borne our griefs, carried our
[40:30] sorrows, yet we did esteem him stricken
[40:33] and smitten, not smitten of man, but
[40:36] smitten of God. God has to smite him in
[40:40] order to afflict him, in order to carry
[40:43] our griefs and our sorrows and our
[40:46] wounds and and all that we can have. He
[40:49] carried them upon himself and he was
[40:52] wounded for our transgressions. As we
[40:54] are reading this, you can put your name
[40:56] there. He was wounded for my
[40:58] transgressions. He was bruised for my
[41:01] iniquities. Oh yes, do we have
[41:03] iniquities? Yes, we have iniquities.
[41:06] It's even more pertinent to us sometimes
[41:08] because we know sometimes the truth. We
[41:10] know what we should do but we don't do
[41:12] it. We should know what we should not do
[41:14] but we still do it. And then God say he
[41:17] was bruised for our iniquities. And the
[41:20] chastisement of our peace or for my
[41:22] peace was upon him. And we've his
[41:25] stripes we are healed. I am healed.
[41:28] Amen.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; And all we like sheep have gone astray.
[41:32] We have turned everyone to his own way.
[41:35] And the Lord has laid on him the
[41:37] iniquity of us all. Not only of some of
[41:41] us, but for us all. He took all our
[41:44] iniquities. He was oppressed and he was
[41:46] afflicted. Yet he opened not his mouth.
[41:50] He's brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[41:53] as a sheep before his sheerers is dumb.
[41:56] So he opened not his mouth. He was taken
[41:59] from prison and from judgment. Oh, and
[42:02] who shall declare his generation? For he
[42:05] was cut off out of the of the land of
[42:08] the living. For the transgression of my
[42:10] people was he stricken. He was he made
[42:14] his grave with the wicked and with the
[42:16] rich in his death because he had done no
[42:18] violence. Neither was any deceit in his
[42:21] mouth. So he was completely innocent.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; He was a perfect lamb of God. Nothing
[42:27] that could put upon him. Even Pilate say
[42:30] he's innocent. Even Judas who betrayed
[42:33] himself had to declare I I betrayed an
[42:36] innocent man. So even even even even the
[42:39] climax of the devil on earth, Judas
[42:42] himself says, "No, this one is
[42:43] innocent." Oh, what a precious lamb of
[42:47] God we had.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; But it pleased the Lord to bruise him.
[42:52] It pleased God to bruise him, yet put
[42:54] him to grief. when that shall make his
[42:57] soul an o an offering for sin, he shall
[43:00] see his seed, and he shall prolong his
[43:02] days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[43:05] prosper in his hand. And he shall see he
[43:08] shall see of the travail of his soul,
[43:10] and he shall be satisfied. By his
[43:12] knowledge shall my righteous servants
[43:15] justify many, for he shall bear their
[43:18] iniquities. We know what justification
[43:20] is. Is if you have never done it, that's
[43:23] what he has done for us. That's what our
[43:25] Lord has done for us. Taken all our
[43:27] iniquities, all our sins and washed it
[43:30] by the blood of the lamb to point that
[43:32] where God look at us, he see the very
[43:34] righteousness of himself doesn't see our
[43:37] sins iniquities anymore. Oh, the color
[43:40] of the blood is red and my sins were
[43:43] red. When look red through see red
[43:46] through red becomes white. Oh, glory to
[43:49] his name. said, "Therefore will I divide
[43:51] him a portion with the great, and he
[43:54] shall divide the spoil with the strong,
[43:56] because he had poured out his soul unto
[43:59] death, and he was numbered with the
[44:02] transgressors, and he bear his sin, the
[44:05] sin of many, and made in intercession
[44:08] for the transgressors."
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful scripture. What a
[44:13] wonderful scripture. So this week is the
[44:15] week of u of the Easter and I was just
[44:20] checking in the in the prophet was say
[44:23] there and says in the quote of the
[44:25] prophet is the only week he call it the
[44:27] holy week
[44:28] &gt;&gt; is the the holy week so it's it's a week
[44:31] where we have to go with with a little
[44:34] bit more consecration
[44:36] I think it's a it's a week where we can
[44:39] little bit just stop and think about
[44:41] what he has done in our lives and just
[44:43] we realize where we come from.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we can think that,
[44:48] okay, we we it's because of my works,
[44:51] because of what I've done is the numbers
[44:52] of years, the message or all that. Thank
[44:55] God for all those things. But it was so
[44:58] good just to come back a little bit and
[44:59] say, "Oh, God, I you took me from the
[45:03] marlay. You took me from from that pit.
[45:05] You took me from that place where I did
[45:08] not deserve anything, but you took me
[45:10] from that place and you washed me. You
[45:12] cleansed me as the prayer was made. You
[45:15] died for me. No one could pay the price
[45:17] for me. No one could pay the debt. No
[45:20] one could take my place. But you came at
[45:23] my place and took my place. You died for
[45:25] me. Oh Lord Jesus Christ, I want to
[45:28] serve you. I want to live for you. I
[45:31] realize where I come from. Father, thank
[45:33] you for your grace in my life. It's only
[45:35] your grace. Only your grace, Lord.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, without you, I will be lost. The
[45:40] grace of God took me from that place.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. Thank you. Thank
[45:45] you for the lamb of God. Thank you for
[45:48] Calvary. Oh, Lord, thank you. Jesus took
[45:52] me place.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[46:28] Salvation is free
[46:31] &gt;&gt; for us, but he had to die for us.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; It's free for us, but he had to die for
[46:37] us.
[46:38] [Music]
[46:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Prophet says, "But did you ever stop to
[46:52] think?"
[46:54] Sorry.
[46:56] Did you ever stop to think what it cost
[46:58] to have it?
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Did you ever realize just the price that
[47:02] behind it?
[47:04] &gt;&gt; What judgment was? What a penalty of sin
[47:08] was. How cruel sin was just to save me
[47:13] Lord. Oh, thank you Lord. Thank you.
[47:17] Thank you. Thank you.
[47:21] Thank you.
[47:26] I didn't have anything to present to
[47:28] you, but you died on my house. Thank
[47:31] you, Lord.
[47:33] You say, "How how cruel must sin be when
[47:37] it caused the son of God to go to
[47:39] Calvary and God will strike him and turn
[47:43] his face from him and smite him and he
[47:47] will be afflicted? He smited so hard
[47:51] that God couldn't look at him. Oh,
[47:54] heaven could look at him. Oh God, why
[47:56] would you do such thing? God, why would
[47:59] you go so dumb? Lord, why would you go
[48:02] so down? But he was thinking of you
[48:06] thinking of him.
[48:08] Oh God,
[48:10] thank you for Calvary.
[48:13] Thank you, Lord, for Calvary. He said, I
[48:15] was thinking of you. I know one day
[48:18] you'll be sick. That's why I'm going
[48:20] through this. Oh Lord,
[48:23] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
[48:27] sorry. Oh Lord.
[48:30] I'm sorry.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, they pull his beer. The beer they
[48:35] spit on him, crashed on him. Oh, he
[48:38] didn't say one word. He thought of you.
[48:41] I thought of me with my mistakes, with
[48:44] my iniquities, my wrongdoings.
[48:48] Oh Lord, that lamb of God, perfect,
[48:51] perfect, perfect without blemish.
[48:55] But he thought he, oh, I will give my
[48:57] life for him. I'll give my life for my
[49:00] children because I cannot be complete
[49:03] without them. They are my children. I
[49:06] can I cannot enjoy heaven without my
[49:08] children. Those were the despised one.
[49:12] Oh God, but he took my place. He took
[49:15] your place, brothers and sisters.
[49:17] That's the God we serve. It's not by
[49:20] law. It's not by anything. But when we
[49:22] look into that, when we we zoom in the
[49:25] love of God. Oh, thank you, Father, for
[49:29] your love. That's why we are here,
[49:31] brothers and sisters.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, but
[49:36] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; As you look in the in the type. Oh, you
[49:45] look in the type as as God. We look into
[49:49] garden of Eden as you saw Adam
[49:53] and his his wife as a sin and went away
[49:56] from the grace of God. God himself has
[49:59] to come down. He didn't have to to send
[50:02] an angel. He didn't have to send anyone
[50:03] else. Himself has to come down as a
[50:07] type. I cannot let my children be lost.
[50:10] I will come down.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; And himself came down.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; He came down. Can you imagine the
[50:17] eternal God?
[50:18] &gt;&gt; The eternal God crying, "Adam, Adam,
[50:22] where are you? Adam, where are you?
[50:24] Adam, looking for you. Where are you, my
[50:27] son? Where are you?" He certainly knew
[50:30] where he was, but he still crying. Where
[50:32] are you, Adam?
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; And he came down.
[50:41] The eternal God himself,
[50:44] the eternal life, he had to kill. The
[50:48] eternal God had to perform death for the
[50:50] first time of all humanity because of
[50:54] the children. Oh God himself, I have to
[50:56] kill. I have to kill a lamb, animal
[50:59] lamb. I'm eternal life, but I have to
[51:02] cause death. I have to cause death
[51:04] because of my son. It's not Satan who
[51:07] killed the first animal. God himself had
[51:10] to kill that lamb
[51:12] &gt;&gt; to cover his own son.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Oh to show great redemption of God,
[51:17] great love of God. The great love of
[51:21] God. Oh, praise be to God. Praise be to
[51:25] God. If we look at Calvary with the
[51:27] right hand, right eyes and oh God, give
[51:30] us revelation of Calvary. Give us more
[51:34] revelation of what Calvary means for us.
[51:37] as you came down and took that lamb and
[51:40] he killed him and he cover his son is
[51:43] cover his daughter thinking of the
[51:45] perfect lamb that will be his slain. Oh,
[51:48] many years later that was slain before
[51:51] the foundation of the world but that
[51:52] will be made in reality. Many years
[51:55] later he was thinking of that.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to his name.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Praise be to our God. Thank you Jesus
[52:04] for your grace. Thank you for Calvary.
[52:08] Jesus had to die of his own will.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; No one pushed him.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; No one pushed him.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; He had to die of his own will. The Bible
[52:17] says when he cried with loud voice, he
[52:19] yielded up with the ghost.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; The the Greek word that is mentioned
[52:24] there says he had to give up himself.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; He had he had he had to surrender. He
[52:30] had he had to die. No one had to take
[52:32] his life. It's not the Romans who killed
[52:35] him. is not the spear who killed that
[52:37] killed him. He's not the sword. It's not
[52:39] the nails. It's not even the blood that
[52:41] came out of it that he had to die that
[52:43] way. It was himself he decided he s he
[52:47] died of sorrow. He said because he came
[52:49] to his own and they rejected him and he
[52:52] had himself as a lamb. I have to pay the
[52:54] price for them.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; I have to pay the price for my children
[52:59] because if I don't do it, no one else
[53:00] could do it. But I have to do it
[53:04] &gt;&gt; as a type of Abel.
[53:07] Oh, Kane came with his with his fruit
[53:10] with with the works and the different
[53:12] things he has done. Oh Lord, can you see
[53:15] what I've done? Can you see what I've
[53:16] done? That was Kane attitude. I've done
[53:19] this. I've done this. I've done this.
[53:20] I'm being in the beauty.
[53:22] But Abel is just a lamb, a small lamb, a
[53:27] tiny lamb
[53:29] that is bringing to God.
[53:32] Abel, why are you bringing that innocent
[53:34] animal? Why you bring that that innocent
[53:36] animal? Why can't you give a sacrifice
[53:38] that is so clean like mine? Kenob could
[53:42] ask, "Why can't you?"
[53:44] He he caught into the revelation of God.
[53:46] The mind of God
[53:48] &gt;&gt; I will have. God has to give the lamb,
[53:50] the perfect lamb of God, the innocent
[53:53] one, the innocent one that could take
[53:55] the place of Abel.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; And as Abel was was slaughtering and and
[54:00] cutting the throat of that animal, do
[54:02] you realize they didn't have knife? They
[54:04] didn't didn't have gun. They didn't have
[54:06] that could kill him directly. He he had
[54:09] he had to smite him. He had to smite all
[54:11] the time. I had to smite many times.
[54:13] many times many times on the throat and
[54:16] that that that little was shivering
[54:18] shivering shivering the same thing for
[54:21] my lord as a type of my lord
[54:24] &gt;&gt; why didn't I have to die just suddenly
[54:26] no but they have to smite him they have
[54:29] to they have to afflict him they have to
[54:32] smite him so he could die could die
[54:34] shaking like that my lord
[54:37] &gt;&gt; make it on the cross for me for you.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your love.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your love.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; That my message this this evening just
[54:52] to remember what the Lord has done for
[54:54] us.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; There are many things we can say but
[54:57] there's nothing that can compare for
[54:59] what God has done for us.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; The Bible says wherefore seeing we also
[55:06] are compassed with so great a cloud of
[55:08] witnesses. Let us lay aside every weight
[55:11] and the sin which does so easily beset
[55:13] us.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Let us run with patience the race that
[55:16] is set before us.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Looking unto Jesus the author and finish
[55:21] our faith.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Who for the joy that was set before him
[55:25] endured the cross despising the shame as
[55:29] he was there put to shame mocked him and
[55:32] everything but he was looking to the joy
[55:35] set before him. Amen. That's why he
[55:37] could endure the cross. He was seeing
[55:40] when we will be together in the
[55:41] millennium. He could see when we will be
[55:43] together in eternity. He could see that
[55:46] I I can go through this suffering a
[55:49] little bit like Joseph. When Joseph
[55:50] realized, oh, I went through all this
[55:52] suffering because I God wanted to save
[55:56] my brothers and sisters. Jesus Christ
[55:58] realized the same thing. Oh, I'm willing
[56:01] to give my life. I'm willing to suffer
[56:04] because of my brothers and sisters,
[56:06] because of my cherished bride. Amen. He
[56:09] was thinking of you. He was thinking of
[56:11] me. Amen. We thank God for his grace.
[56:16] Aren't you thankful for God's grace in
[56:18] our life?
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:30] Prophet says
[56:33] God doesn't care about the lily on the
[56:35] altar. He wants you on the altar.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; It isn't the lily. It is your sacrifice.
[56:40] It isn't your sacrifice. You are the guy
[56:43] to be on the altar. That the difference
[56:45] putting what God requires on the altar
[56:47] is you. I'd rather worship a little in a
[56:51] little old room somewhere in a back
[56:53] alley and have God in it than a
[56:55] cathedral with God. not in need. That's
[56:58] right. Sure.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; He was a poor man. Notice that when he
[57:02] brought his offering candid and laid it
[57:04] upon them, they notice he came from the
[57:06] line of Satan because he expected God to
[57:09] receive it because it was beautiful
[57:11] fruits. Something that he done himself.
[57:14] But look at Abel. Not now when Abel came
[57:17] to make his offering. Well, it was quite
[57:19] a difference when Abel came. Here you
[57:22] come. He didn't work. didn't try to find
[57:25] the biggest church in town to go to. He
[57:27] didn't try to find the nicest bunch of
[57:29] people to associate with. Amen. He just
[57:32] took something that he had on and come
[57:34] on. That's all. He was a sheep herder.
[57:36] So he just reached over and got a lamp
[57:38] and tied. I suppose they didn't have any
[57:41] in that name. So he must have got a
[57:43] grave a grave a grape vine and just
[57:46] wrapped it around his neck. But what
[57:48] what did he speak of? They led him to
[57:50] Calvary. He was the lamb. when he was,
[57:54] why was he born in a barn? Lambs are not
[57:56] born in houses. They are born in barns.
[58:00] They led him, they led him to the
[58:01] slaughter like a lamp, and they led him
[58:04] away, leading him up to Calvary. He was
[58:06] God's lamp. Amen. From the foundation of
[58:09] the world. When I think of it, there
[58:12] came Abel's little lamp. They come God's
[58:14] lamp. Amen.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. the cruelty of sin and the penalty
[58:19] that it costs to read sin from our from
[58:22] from our lives. When I think of it, my
[58:25] heart just turns over and over. When I
[58:28] think me a poor, unworthy, ungodly
[58:32] sinner dying without God, with Christ in
[58:35] the world without hope and in due
[58:37] season, Christ died on mystead, the
[58:40] beautiful one, and became despised
[58:44] and rejected that I might be accepted in
[58:47] his sight. In mystead, oh my, I just
[58:51] can't get over it. I just can't imagine
[58:54] how he could do that for me. Who was I?
[58:58] Then you say, "Did he do it for you?"
[59:01] Says, "Yes." The Holy Spirit come and
[59:03] hunted me up one day and said, "God did
[59:06] it for you. Jesus did it for you." And I
[59:09] believed him. I believed him with all my
[59:12] heart. Oh, the lamb of God that he not
[59:15] die quickly. He had to suffer to take
[59:18] all that. Oh, I say now how he was
[59:22] wounded for our transgression, bruised
[59:24] for iniquities. The chastisement of our
[59:26] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[59:28] we are healed. How could you reject
[59:30] suchless love? How could you reject that
[59:34] love of God for you? I trust tonight my
[59:37] brother, sister, that you will come. God
[59:39] was as a provided way. That's the way
[59:42] for you. That the only one who can have
[59:44] anything to do with you. That's the only
[59:47] one that took your place. that the one
[59:50] who stands tonight, the resurrected
[59:52] redeemer, standing at the right hand of
[59:54] the father tonight, see you begging and
[59:57] pleading for every sinner that in this
[1:00:00] building to come to him. I trust you
[1:00:02] will. I trust you won't let this Easter
[1:00:05] pass. That's my prayer. I trust that
[1:00:08] this Easter will just not be like any
[1:00:10] other Easter, but we can go with the
[1:00:12] right attitude. Lord,
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; make me make me realize the value of
[1:00:17] Calvary. Make me realize what you have
[1:00:20] done for me. Say, dear friends, we are
[1:00:22] the end of the road. I believe we are.
[1:00:25] We've all we are down to the end of the
[1:00:28] road. May the Lord Jesus Christ bless
[1:00:30] you. May you make you a new creature in
[1:00:33] him tonight is my prayer. May he lead
[1:00:35] you one time.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; One time in. Amen. Is that the desire of
[1:00:40] your heart? May God lead us. May you God
[1:00:43] continue to continue with us. Amen. See,
[1:00:45] are you willing like it was for Abel?
[1:00:48] Are you willing tonight to die upon
[1:00:50] yourself? Are you willing to die out all
[1:00:53] your thought of yourself as Abel had to
[1:00:56] die with the sacrifice there as he was
[1:00:59] seeing the shivering of that dying lamb
[1:01:01] and himself later on he died on that
[1:01:04] same altar. He died with that lamb. The
[1:01:08] same thing for us. We desire to be
[1:01:10] identified in death of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. desire to die to my pride, to die
[1:01:15] to my arrogance, to die to my or to to
[1:01:17] die for anything that that that is not
[1:01:19] of God. I want to die to all those
[1:01:21] things. And I want the life of Jesus
[1:01:24] Christ to come upon me. The lamb of of
[1:01:26] Abel could not the life of the lamb of
[1:01:28] Abel could not come upon Abel, but the
[1:01:31] life of the perfect lamb of God can come
[1:01:34] upon us. Amen. That's what we desire.
[1:01:37] Prophet says, just lay on the rock with
[1:01:39] your lamp there and die out. Oh God have
[1:01:42] mercy. When I think of men of women who
[1:01:44] think who think of pride, young men and
[1:01:47] women who will give their lives over to
[1:01:49] the things. Oh, men of age too thinking
[1:01:52] of their job and their prestige and of
[1:01:55] their neighborhood or something like
[1:01:57] that. Oh, you might say it's a funeral.
[1:01:59] Well, brother, if there ever was a time
[1:02:02] we needed a funeral is right now when
[1:02:05] men will die to their self and pride. Oh
[1:02:08] God, we desire to die to ourselves.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; We can have life in you. Amen.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, when the skies begin to get dark,
[1:02:17] lightning begin to flash, God was hiding
[1:02:20] his face, he couldn't stand it no more.
[1:02:23] Oh God, how cruel sin must be. How
[1:02:26] cruel, how cruel that caused that
[1:02:28] precious one to do that. Even such a
[1:02:30] price he paid till God himself hid his
[1:02:33] face. The angel veiled their faces and
[1:02:36] to weeping with him. The moon and the
[1:02:38] stars could not go any further. They
[1:02:41] could not shine no more. The very God
[1:02:43] that created them was dying on the
[1:02:44] cross. He bowed his head. Before he did
[1:02:47] that, he looked down there to them
[1:02:49] people grumbling for his garment
[1:02:51] fulfilled what the prophet said and he
[1:02:53] said, "Father, forgive them. They don't
[1:02:56] know what they are doing." All in love,
[1:02:58] Adam's lamb, God provided lamb, slain
[1:03:02] from the foundation of the world. There
[1:03:04] he died friend, friendless, friendless,
[1:03:07] even forsaken by God himself. Oh, his
[1:03:10] own father forsaken bleeding. He died on
[1:03:13] the cross and the blood can cleanse us
[1:03:16] today.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire? God may
[1:03:20] continue to clean me. Clean me. Oh, what
[1:03:24] did cost God never cost us nothing. But
[1:03:27] cost God his son. It cost God the
[1:03:29] greatest price. It cost Christ his life.
[1:03:32] He was the rose of Sharon. But to get
[1:03:35] the perfume out of a rose, you have to
[1:03:38] crush it up. Oh, his beautiful life was
[1:03:41] crushed. He was crushed. Completely
[1:03:44] crushed. to take that rose of of Sharon
[1:03:47] and that can be applied upon us who are
[1:03:50] stinking in in sin and trespasses and
[1:03:53] iniquities so that that perfume can be
[1:03:56] applied upon us and we can come in the
[1:03:59] presence of God and now with confidence
[1:04:01] oh God you don't look at my sins but you
[1:04:04] look at your own blood I can come in
[1:04:06] prayer and say Lord you know my
[1:04:08] petitions because it's not me anymore
[1:04:10] it's the blood of Jesus Christ oh praise
[1:04:14] be to God say by the which we shall all
[1:04:17] sanctified through the offering of the
[1:04:19] body of Jesus Christ once for all amen
[1:04:22] we don't have to do many sacrifices one
[1:04:26] sacrifice was more than enough to
[1:04:28] cleanse us all to cleanse you to clean
[1:04:31] you to cleanse me that the blood of
[1:04:33] Jesus Christ brothers and sisters we
[1:04:35] don't have come always with condemnation
[1:04:37] now we can come because we don't look at
[1:04:40] ourself look at the at the lamb of God
[1:04:42] as we go to the high priest system. He
[1:04:44] doesn't look at this. The worshipper
[1:04:46] looks at the perfect lamb. If the lamb
[1:04:48] is perfect, then the worshipper is
[1:04:50] perfect. Amen. So that's why we can come
[1:04:53] with confidence with God this evening.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; And claim may the redemptive blessings
[1:04:58] of God. Amen.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; So I thank you for what you have done
[1:05:02] for me. I consecrate myself and you at
[1:05:05] this crucifixion night memorial to you.
[1:05:08] Take me Lord, forgive me all my mistakes
[1:05:11] and troubles. Make me strong and
[1:05:14] powerful Lord in the spirit of God that
[1:05:16] I might win souls to you.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Bless this congregation for we ask it in
[1:05:21] Jesus name. Forgive every sinner.
[1:05:24] Reclaim every backslider that they
[1:05:26] desire our heart. We have families
[1:05:29] sometimes split and people backsliding.
[1:05:31] Oh God remember us this evening.
[1:05:34] Remember our cry, remember our prayer.
[1:05:36] Lord, may you go and touch in each and
[1:05:38] every one of them. Father,
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; as we remember of Calvary, remember what
[1:05:43] Calvary has done for us. And brother Bam
[1:05:45] says, what can we do if we understand
[1:05:47] what Calvary means for us? The first
[1:05:50] thing I want to say, Jesus never lived
[1:05:52] for himself. His life was spent for
[1:05:55] others. That's perfectly eternal life.
[1:05:58] When you say you go to church and do
[1:06:00] good things, that's fine. But when you
[1:06:02] leave your life to yourself, you haven't
[1:06:04] eternal life. Eternal life is living for
[1:06:07] others.
[1:06:08] Living for it. proved it when he came
[1:06:10] the lamb of God. He lived and had
[1:06:12] eternal life because he did not leave
[1:06:14] for himself. He lived for others.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; As we are, we are going to go in prayer
[1:06:18] in few minutes. Remember also those
[1:06:21] those who couldn't make it, those who
[1:06:23] don't even realize that they need God.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; We can pray for them this evening once
[1:06:28] we have that revelation of what cross
[1:06:31] has done for us.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 5:15. and he died for all
[1:06:36] that they which live should not
[1:06:38] henceforth live unto themselves but unto
[1:06:42] him which died for them and rose again
[1:06:45] that's why we don't own ourself we have
[1:06:47] been bought with a prize we pertain to
[1:06:50] him belong to him first John 3:16 hereby
[1:06:54] perceive we the love of God because he
[1:06:56] laid down his life for us and we ought
[1:06:59] to lay down our lives for the brethren
[1:07:03] remember the brethrens in prayer prayer
[1:07:04] this evening as we go in prayers. Amen.
[1:07:13] Amen.

[1:10:33] God, I commune as with a friend.
