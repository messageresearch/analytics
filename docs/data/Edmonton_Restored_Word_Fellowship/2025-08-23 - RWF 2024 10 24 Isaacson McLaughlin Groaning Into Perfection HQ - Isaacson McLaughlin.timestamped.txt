[0:00] Some glad morning when his life is over,
[0:06] I'll
[0:07] fly away
[0:11] to a home on God's celestial shore.
[0:16] I'll
[0:18] fly away.
[0:21] I'll
[0:23] fly away.
[0:26] I'll
[0:28] fly away.
[0:31] I won't die. Hallelujah. By and by,
[0:36] I'll
[0:38] fly away.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.

[0:48] Holy Belief from the first verse to the
[0:51] last verse. Fear not, little flocks.
[0:54] &gt;&gt; From the cross to the throne,
[0:57] &gt;&gt; from death into life, he went for his
[1:00] own.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; All power in earth, all power above is
[1:06] given to him for the flock of his love.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14] Feels
[1:17] great.
[1:20] &gt;&gt; From the cross to the throne.
[1:26] From death into
[1:30] life.

[6:58] &gt;&gt; Father, we bless your holy name
[7:00] &gt;&gt; for your mercies and grace upon our
[7:02] life.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; Dear Lord, you see the hands that have
[7:06] been lifted up.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; Father, even including my hands,
[7:10] &gt;&gt; Father, we have lifted it up because we

[7:16] can help us.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; You are the only one that can heal us.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; You are the only one that can deliver
[7:22] us. Amen.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; You are the only one that can forgive
[7:25] us.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, let Angel the Lord move from seat
[7:29] to seat,
[7:31] &gt;&gt; from heart to heart,
[7:32] &gt;&gt; from home to home,
[7:34] &gt;&gt; from schools to schools, from offices to
[7:37] offices,
[7:38] &gt;&gt; and minister to the needs of thy people.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; Meet each and every one of us at the
[7:43] point of our knees. Father, for no one
[7:46] come before you and go back the same.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; May your Holy Spirit take absolute
[7:50] control, Lord,
[7:51] &gt;&gt; even as your word is about to be read,
[7:54] &gt;&gt; Father, may the anointing of God fall
[7:56] upon it, Lord,
[7:57] &gt;&gt; and sow seeds of life in the heart of
[8:00] your people. Heal the sick and afflicted
[8:02] among us, Lord.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; Even those who are streaming from home,
[8:05] may you touch them, Lord,
[8:07] &gt;&gt; whatever they are, Lord, meet each and
[8:09] every one of us at the point of our
[8:11] contact. Lord, deliver us from every
[8:13] affliction of darkness. Forgive our
[8:15] iniquities, our trespasses, our sins.
[8:18] Lord,
[8:19] &gt;&gt; you block away our iniquities by your
[8:20] precious blood. Father, Lord, your
[8:22] servant is reporting to duty. Father,
[8:25] anoint me to speak to the needs of thy
[8:27] people. May the great Holy Spirit take
[8:30] our full control. Bless us oh God that
[8:33] we will say like a people that were
[8:36] coming from bowels. Did not our heart
[8:38] burn within us even as we were part of
[8:41] the word. Come once again Lord that
[8:44] great shiver wave and beware among your
[8:47] people
[8:48] &gt;&gt; that we will come to the maturity to the
[8:51] stature of a perfect man. Father bless
[8:54] us once again this morning. Bless the
[8:56] pastor of the house. Bless his home, his
[8:59] family, his children and grandchildren.
[9:03] Lord, bless the officers at the gates.
[9:05] Bless the musicians. Lord, bless every
[9:08] brother, every sister.
[9:10] Lord, even those who have traveled, may
[9:12] your grace is sufficient with them.
[9:14] &gt;&gt; As many that couldn't come, whatever
[9:15] they are, may the same angel of God be
[9:18] with them.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you for this morning, for the
[9:21] privilege and opportunity to come before
[9:24] you.
[9:25] &gt;&gt; Come, Lord, and bless us, Father.
[9:27] There's many other blessings we ask and
[9:30] receive in the name of Jesus Christ we
[9:33] have prayed.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen.
[9:37] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; Let us give a hand of applause unto the
[9:40] Lord.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; Shall we be seated a while so that we
[9:45] can come up and read a scripture again?
[9:49] &gt;&gt; I greet you all this morning in the name
[9:51] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; I am very happy and delighted to be
[9:56] among you
[9:58] &gt;&gt; and I thank God for the opportunity
[10:00] given to me to share the word of life
[10:02] with you.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; I want to appreciate pastor se for
[10:06] opening the pulpit for fellowship even
[10:10] though he have not met me before or have
[10:12] not about me but when the recommendation
[10:15] came he did not opt out. Amen. Amen.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "A good
[10:21] shepherd, a good pastor always want the
[10:23] best for his congregation."
[10:26] &gt;&gt; He has an ambition to better the people,
[10:29] to better the church. Amen. And amen. I
[10:32] want to bring greetings from the saints
[10:34] and family back home in West Africa and
[10:38] the friends in East Africa also send
[10:40] your greetings. Pastor John Dana called
[10:42] yesterday. He sent his greetings from
[10:45] Miss Saga and Pastor Samuel in Manitoba
[10:48] also sent his greetings. I hope you
[10:50] receive them all.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:53] This is my first time in this part of
[10:56] Canada.
[10:57] You just bear with me. Pastor asked me
[11:00] to speak slowly so that you can get my
[11:04] my my words. And unfortunately, I'm not
[11:07] a slow preacher,
[11:09] &gt;&gt; but I'm going to have a lesson Sunday
[11:11] school teaches. So pardon me if I skip
[11:14] my limit.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; I believe the Lord will bless us all.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; I want to give my sincere appreciation
[11:22] to the pastor and the wife for taking
[11:24] good care of me.
[11:26] I feel at home
[11:29] &gt;&gt; the little time the little day I've been
[11:30] with them.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; And uh somehow somewhere I really enjoy
[11:34] myself.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; From from the meals and everything.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. You know, I was
[11:41] surprised when they took me to the
[11:43] restaurant the first day. But yesterday
[11:46] when she prepared some meal, I was like,
[11:47] "Wow, this is better than a restaurant."
[11:50] &gt;&gt; I didn't know why. What you went to the
[11:52] restaurant for? And somehow I was
[11:55] selecting the seal to wear today. So I
[11:58] pick one of them I'll be wearing all
[12:00] over and I position it. But later they
[12:03] call me that this suit want to give out.
[12:05] When I tried it, it fit me perfectly. So
[12:08] I told the pastor, I'm going to wear you
[12:10] to preach today.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; So God reserve and preserve that suit
[12:14] for me.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; When you close, you shake the hand of
[12:17] the pastor for making me look beautiful
[12:19] and handsome
[12:21] before the presence of the Lord.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; Doesn't it fit me?
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; It's a blessing to me.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm saying.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:33] When I was in Manitoba, we're trying to
[12:34] buy some suit. It was expensive. So I
[12:37] thought of going back home and buy it
[12:39] and somehow the Lord have blessed me
[12:41] here.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; It's a great blessing to me
[12:45] &gt;&gt; and I really appreciate you so much.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. Just feel at home. Don't
[12:50] worry about this little boy standing
[12:52] here.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; Just look behind.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; There is a man in there that can turn
[12:57] the lights.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. And uh we will share
[13:02] some missionary testimonies along also.
[13:04] I am grateful to see a servant of God
[13:07] that believe in a five-fold ministry
[13:10] &gt;&gt; that God still have apostles. God still
[13:12] have evangelists. God still have prophet
[13:15] and teachers.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; And I give God the glory. And somehow
[13:19] somewhere he he delve into the
[13:21] supernatural. He was beginning to speak
[13:24] ahead of my notes.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; When he was talking, even the song I
[13:28] will fly away is all part of the notes.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; And I believe the Holy Ghost is here.
[13:33] Amen.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; I have been awake since 3:00 a.m. to now
[13:37] &gt;&gt; and anytime God wakes me up early Sunday
[13:39] morning, I know he have something
[13:40] special.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; So he said, "My servant wake up because
[13:44] some people have some needs
[13:46] &gt;&gt; and I want you to bring to them."
[13:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; You know when the woman keeps long in
[13:52] the kitchen and you are hungry or the
[13:54] food is not coming, don't worry.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; She's doing her best.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; So when God wakes you up that way, God
[14:00] want the best for his people.
[14:02] Not for me but for you.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; And tonight, God willing, we will be in
[14:08] brother
[14:09] church. Brother Ed and Mistress, please
[14:12] uh end time vis tabernacle.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you all. I bring
[14:17] greetings from Pastor Barry in Calgary
[14:19] also.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; He sends his greetings.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So now
[14:25] let's open our Bibles to the book of
[14:28] Romans.
[14:32] Okay.
[14:34] Romans chapter 8 verse 19.
[14:45] Let us hear God's word. Romans chapter 8
[14:47] verse 19.
[14:51] Let me even start from verse 18 even
[14:52] though it's not there. Let's read. I'll
[14:55] read it first then we continue from
[14:56] verse 19. For I reckon that the
[14:59] suffering of this present time are not
[15:01] worthy to be compared with the glory
[15:03] which shall be revealed in us.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; So now let's go to the verse 19. Now for
[15:08] the earnest expectation of the creature
[15:12] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[15:16] of God. Hallelujah.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; For the creature was made subject to
[15:21] vanity, not willingly,
[15:24] but by reason of him who had subjected
[15:28] the same in hope.
[15:31] Because the creature itself also shall
[15:34] be delivered from the bondage of
[15:37] corruption
[15:38] &gt;&gt; into the glorious liberty of the
[15:40] children of God. Amen.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; For we know that the whole creation
[15:46] groanth and travaleth in pain together
[15:49] unto now.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; And not only they
[15:55] but ourselves also
[15:58] which have the first fruit of the
[16:01] spirit.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even we ourselves grown within
[16:06] ourselves
[16:09] &gt;&gt; waiting for the adoption
[16:12] to with the redemption of our body.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; For we Oh, blessed be the name of the
[16:19] Lord.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add his blessing to the
[16:22] reading of his word.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; Shall we humbly be seated?
[16:29] There are many scriptures to be uh read
[16:32] this morning. Then we read our second
[16:35] scripture from first Corinthians.
[16:41] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[16:45] Let me see. Let's let's read the 2
[16:48] Corinthians. 2 Corinthians chapter 5
[16:51] verse 1 to
[16:53] to 6.
[16:57] 2 Corinthians chapter 5
[17:00] that is slice 8 you get it there verse
[17:04] one to
[17:05] six go to slice 8 you'll find it there
[17:09] for we know that if our earthly
[17:12] tabernacle
[17:13] were dissolved
[17:16] we have a building of God
[17:20] &gt;&gt; and house not made revance
[17:22] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[17:24] &gt;&gt; eternal in heavens Amen.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; For in this we grown
[17:30] earnestly,
[17:32] desiring to be clothed upon with our
[17:36] house which is from heaven.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; If so be that being clothed, we shall
[17:44] not be found naked.
[17:46] For we that are in this tabernacle
[17:51] do grown being burdened.
[17:55] Not for that which we be unclothed but
[18:00] clothed upon that mortality
[18:04] might be swallowed up in life.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:09] Now he that has wrought us for the same
[18:14] self thing is God,
[18:17] who also had given unto us the earnest
[18:22] of the spirit.
[18:25] Where therefore we are always confident
[18:29] knowing that whilst we are at home in
[18:34] the body,
[18:35] &gt;&gt; we are absent from the Lord. Amen.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; I want to give a little title to our
[18:44] message this morning.
[18:48] Groing
[18:49] into perfection.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Growing into perfection.
[18:57] You see,
[18:59] if you don't have the spirit of God,
[19:02] you will not know what we are talking
[19:04] about.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[19:08] That is why it is very essential. Oh,
[19:12] blessed be in the name of the Lord.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; It is very important to have the Holy
[19:18] Spirit.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; For the Holy Spirit is the spirit of
[19:24] God.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; Let me read again from Galatians chapter
[19:31] 4 verse 1-7.
[19:36] Now I say
[19:39] that
[19:40] here as long as he is a child different
[19:44] nothing from a servant. Amen. Amen.
[19:47] Slide 16. You get it there. Okay.
[19:50] Different nothing from a servant. But is
[19:53] under tutors and governors until the
[19:56] time appointed of the father.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:59] Even so we when we were children
[20:03] were in bondage under the elements of
[20:07] the world.
[20:08] But when the fullness of time was come,
[20:13] God sent forth his son,
[20:18] &gt;&gt; made of a woman, made under the law, to
[20:23] redeem them that were under the law,
[20:27] that we might receive the adoption of
[20:31] sons. Amen.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; And because ye are sons,
[20:38] God had sent forth the spirit of his
[20:42] son.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Into your hearts.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; Crying aba father.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; Crying aba father. Wherefore thou art no
[20:56] more a servant but a son.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God. and if a son then and hear
[21:03] of God through Christ.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; That is the endest expectation
[21:14] &gt;&gt; of creature.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; You see, in the beginning,
[21:19] it was man that fell.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; But here is it. The falling of man
[21:26] brought the falling of nature.
[21:30] Brother Abraham said God didn't create
[21:33] tongues on a tree.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Before sin came in the garden, there was
[21:39] nothing like tongs.
[21:42] When Adam want mango, he said mango
[21:44] come, it falls on his hand.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Adam can play with the lion and even put
[21:50] the hand in the mouth of the lion.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; There was harmony and everything was
[21:56] perfect peace.
[22:00] But when the fall came,
[22:03] &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; The scripture say, "For the creature was
[22:07] made subject to vanity."
[22:10] &gt;&gt; Not willingly,
[22:12] but by the reason of him who had
[22:15] subjected the same in hope.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; So the creature itself also shall be
[22:24] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[22:27] &gt;&gt; unto the glorious liberty of the
[22:29] children of God.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; In other words, since the fall of man
[22:35] brought the fall of the creation or the
[22:38] nature, the redemption of man brings the
[22:42] liberty of the creatures also.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; For we know the whole creation
[22:52] groanneth.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; I don't know whether you know the
[22:56] meaning of groaning.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Somebody groaning.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Groaning.
[23:03] Hallelujah. And travaleth in pain
[23:06] together until now.
[23:09] Before the falling garden of Eden, there
[23:12] was nothing like global warming.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; What is global warming today?
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. It came as a result of
[23:19] the fall.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Before the fall, there were no tongues.
[23:23] But after sin came in the garden, now
[23:26] there were tongues on the tree. When
[23:27] Adam hold the tree, ouch.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What happened? It is because
[23:33] of that estate, the fallen estate of
[23:36] man.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:39] And not only they, not nature alone,
[23:44] but ourselves also which have the first
[23:48] fruit of the spirit.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; It is not for everybody.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; But those who have the first fruits
[23:57] &gt;&gt; of the spirit.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; If you don't have the first fruit of the
[24:01] spirit, you don't know what we are
[24:04] talking about.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. If you don't have the
[24:09] first fruit of the spirit, there is
[24:11] nothing in you to grown.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Why are we groaning? We are growing into
[24:19] that perfection.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; We are groaning into the fullness of our
[24:28] adoption.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; We are groaning into maturity.
[24:37] But ourselves also which have the first
[24:40] fruit of the spirit.
[24:44] The first fruit of the spirit is the
[24:46] holy spirit.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the first fruit
[24:50] &gt;&gt; the shiv wave
[24:52] &gt;&gt; that will shave over the rest of the
[24:54] crops that they will grow and come into
[24:57] that maturity.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; He was the first fruit of the womb
[25:01] &gt;&gt; that opened the womb before the rest
[25:04] were born. Hallelujah.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; And not only they but ourself also which
[25:12] have the first fruit of the spirit.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; And when he rose on the third day on
[25:19] that resurrection, he rose on that third
[25:22] day for our justification.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And after he rose on his
[25:28] resurrection and he went at the day of
[25:30] Pentecost, he gave the first fruit to
[25:33] the church of the firstborn.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; Even we ourselves grown within
[25:45] ourselves.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; If you are a believer and you feel
[25:51] comfortable in this world,
[25:53] &gt;&gt; then there is something wrong with you.
[25:56] then you have not yet the first fruit.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Because if you have the first fruit,
[26:01] &gt;&gt; there will be a deep
[26:03] &gt;&gt; calling onto the deep
[26:05] &gt;&gt; and there will be a deep somewhere
[26:08] &gt;&gt; to respond to that deep call.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; We are growing within ourself waiting
[26:15] for the adoption
[26:18] &gt;&gt; to with the redemption of our body.
[26:21] Amen.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Before we continue, I want you to see
[26:28] something here. We want to quote from
[26:29] the message, divine healing.
[26:33] Thank you, Father.
[26:35] Let me see the paragraph, the the the
[26:38] slice and let you know.
[26:44] Did you get it?
[26:46] Yeah. Very good. I 26. Okay.
[26:52] Let's see what the prophet is saying
[26:53] here. He said there it is the whole
[26:58] thing and how we love it. Isn't it food
[27:02] to your soul?
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't it food to your soul?
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; And the congregation says
[27:10] &gt;&gt; amen.
[27:13] And every time we believe
[27:16] that little speck in there just get
[27:21] bigger.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Oh glory.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit when it comes into your
[27:27] heart it is like a little button. Yeah.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Anytime we believe
[27:34] &gt;&gt; that little spe
[27:36] begin to get bigger
[27:38] &gt;&gt; bigger
[27:40] &gt;&gt; swirls out
[27:42] &gt;&gt; till after a while it just becomes you
[27:46] believe all things.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; There were some things you couldn't
[27:52] believe some years ago.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; There were some quote you were
[27:56] struggling some years ago.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; But what happened today? Amen.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Today you don't struggle to believe them
[28:05] &gt;&gt; because you are growing.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; And revelation is progressing.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; The more you grow, the more you know.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; And we know better things today
[28:18] &gt;&gt; than what we know before.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Nobody go to the hospital and give birth
[28:24] to a man.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; No.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; A full grown man. And the baby will come
[28:29] from the living room with Yes. No. No.
[28:31] Sisters, have you seen some before? But
[28:33] when you go to the living room, you give
[28:35] birth to babies.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; But the baby will not be a baby forever.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; There are processes that it goes through
[28:45] &gt;&gt; to grow.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; And as all things begin to come in, love
[28:53] begin. It comes in
[28:57] doubt, hatred, malice, fear, it just
[29:02] flies out like that.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; Because there is no stream, there is no
[29:09] lake, there is no river that produces
[29:13] sweet and sour taste at the same time.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Where there is love, there can't be
[29:19] hatred.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Where there is love, there can't be
[29:23] &gt;&gt; balance.
[29:24] Hallelujah.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; Where there is fear, there can't be
[29:28] faith.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; But when fear is out,
[29:31] &gt;&gt; then faith comes in.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; And no one can serve two masters at the
[29:40] same time.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; You remember the story of that Indian
[29:45] dog? He told the prophet, I have two
[29:47] dogs in me.
[29:49] One is black and one is white.
[29:53] and I'm confused. I don't know which one
[29:55] is ruling me. So the prophet told him,
[29:58] the one you feed most
[30:00] &gt;&gt; is the one that rules over you.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; If you feed on righteousness, you will
[30:06] produce righteousness.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; If you feed on filthiness, you produce
[30:10] immorality.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; So hatred and malice moves out when love
[30:16] comes in.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; You can't tell me you love the Lord when
[30:19] you hate your brother.
[30:23] Faith without works is death.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; Show me your faith and I will tell you
[30:28] of your works.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; Show me your works and I will tell you
[30:31] of your faith.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Let's continue reading here. It spreads
[30:40] out. It gets so big it till it bust the
[30:44] little old shell out. See what I mean?
[30:48] All the world is pitch. But now look
[30:51] here.
[30:53] We grow daily in the grace of God.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; Let me take my time.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; The pastor said I have my liberty.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; So let me have my liberty here.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; We grow daily in the grace of God.
[31:19] The word here is grow.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; When a baby is feeding and the baby is
[31:27] not growing, then there is something
[31:29] wrong with the child.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; You better take him to the hospital.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; And ask your daughter, "What is wrong
[31:35] with my baby?"
[31:38] &gt;&gt; We grow only on Sundays.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; No.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Every day.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Only on 31st night, December night.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; No.
[31:45] But we grow daily.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; And Paul said, "I die daily."
[31:54] &gt;&gt; And the sister wrote the prophet, "How
[31:55] can I grow deeper in the love of God?"
[31:58] Said, "Read your Bible
[32:00] &gt;&gt; and pray every day."
[32:04] &gt;&gt; Read your Bible and pray
[32:06] &gt;&gt; every day.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Did he say read your Bible and pray only
[32:09] on Sundays?
[32:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Or Wednesday service. Yes.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; But every day,
[32:17] &gt;&gt; we grow daily.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Just as physically,
[32:23] we eat every day.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; If we don't eat, we die.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; If we don't eat
[32:38] or if you don't feed this body,
[32:42] we die.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Then if we don't feed the inner man,
[32:47] &gt;&gt; we also die spiritually.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; And as this body, as this outer man
[32:55] feeds
[32:57] physical things to survive, to grow,
[33:01] so our soul feed on spiritual things
[33:07] &gt;&gt; to survive and to grow.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true.
[33:11] And the food for the soul is the word of
[33:14] God.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Our souls feed on the word.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; So remember, we grow daily in the grace
[33:26] of God.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I die daily."
[33:32] &gt;&gt; But if you have spiritual discernment,
[33:35] he also resurrect daily. Amen.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Because if he die daily, why does he die
[33:41] tomorrow? Because he resurrect.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; We fall daily. We sin daily. We
[33:49] backslide daily. But we confess daily.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; We are forgiven daily
[33:54] &gt;&gt; and we rise up daily.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; And we press on daily.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; There is no point of stopping in this
[34:02] journey.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:06] Yesterday pastor made me watch the movie
[34:09] of Moses
[34:11] and when they came out of Egypt.
[34:15] If you see the joy in the faces of the
[34:18] people when Pharaoh finally gave them
[34:21] the ready to go.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; He said let my people go.
[34:28] The sound of freedom.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Alone. Oh my God. They have not yet left
[34:37] Egypt that there was something in them
[34:40] already rejoicing
[34:43] &gt;&gt; knowing there is freedom.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; And you can never appreciate
[34:49] deliverance if you have never been in
[34:51] bondage.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; You can never appreciate healing if you
[34:56] have never been sick before.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; You can never appreciate salvation if
[35:02] you have never been lost before.
[35:05] The people were packing their things
[35:07] rejoicing in the movie.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Even the old were being carried and put
[35:12] on the horse.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; The blind were being carried. They did
[35:16] not leave an hoof behind.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Because of the joy of freedom,
[35:22] &gt;&gt; because of the joy of deliverance.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Before they set on their way, they are
[35:27] already rejoicing.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; That is how it is. When the word of God
[35:32] is declared to you that by my stripe you
[35:35] are healed, you begin to rejoice
[35:38] &gt;&gt; even before you feel any pain.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; You begin to rejoice because the word
[35:45] have declared the blessings to you.
[35:46] Amen.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; How many of you remember the story
[35:53] when Austria was going to war the
[35:55] prophet talk about a man I forgot his
[35:57] name and he says they were given freedom
[36:01] when the sun comes up that the next
[36:04] morning when the sun comes up is your
[36:07] freedom.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; So one man have to go up on the
[36:11] mountain.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. At the breaking of the day
[36:16] when he saw the sun about to move out,
[36:18] he shout down to the people there is
[36:21] freedom.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; The rest might not have seen the sun
[36:26] rising,
[36:28] &gt;&gt; but when they heard the proclamation of
[36:30] the freedom, they jump into it.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; They jumped to it because they were
[36:36] waiting on the rising of the sun
[36:39] &gt;&gt; to be their freedom.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:42] The people were rejoicing, rejoicing. 2
[36:45] million people
[36:47] and here comes the resi.
[36:50] I thought that was the end of the movie.
[36:51] I asked pastor Abd said, "No, they are
[36:53] going to trials." And then when the resi
[36:56] comes the way, they asked Moses, "Were
[36:59] there no better grapes in Egypt?"
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, we miss the honey and the garlic and
[37:06] onions of Egypt. That is how sometimes
[37:09] most of us fail.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; When a little triumph comes our way,
[37:13] &gt;&gt; we begin to remember our denomination.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; We begin to remember the things of the
[37:18] world and we call it good old days. That
[37:21] was bad old days.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; There is nothing good than what you are
[37:26] having now.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; This is a real
[37:30] &gt;&gt; good new day.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; And God made a way.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Through the water.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; He makes a way through the fire.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; He makes a way for every situation.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; And pastor asked a question. Can you
[37:48] believe these people were some few
[37:51] minutes ago rejoicing
[37:53] &gt;&gt; because of the deliverance and yet they
[37:55] are now murmuring because of a little
[37:58] obstacle.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; If God brings you to it,
[38:03] &gt;&gt; he will take you across.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. We serve a faithful God
[38:08] &gt;&gt; who will never leave us or forsake us.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; He is a mighty conqueror.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; He's a great counselor.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; He's a mighty and terrible God.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; There is nothing too hard for him to do.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; He didn't bring us here to lose us. He
[38:24] brought us here to take us home.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:27] [Music]
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, faithful is he that has become
[38:31] &gt;&gt; and he will surely accomplish it.
[38:35] If he cannot carry us through, he will
[38:37] not waste his time to bring us here.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; But he is a faithful God.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; We grow daily in the grace of God.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Let's see what the prophet of God is
[38:53] saying here. He said the new birth.
[39:01] Glory. Hallelujah.
[39:03] Oh, sorry. I I was the one who jump
[39:05] higher. I went hard the same place you
[39:08] are. It's the best, right? Yeah. He
[39:11] said, "Now you notice those people, they
[39:14] can sit and say, well, I accept the
[39:18] Lord.
[39:20] You take their word for it. I would too.
[39:25] I can't judge." Who are we to judge?
[39:29] &gt;&gt; God does.
[39:31] But in 10 years from now, they have
[39:34] never progressed a bit.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Just staying right in the same old
[39:41] place.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; See,
[39:46] &gt;&gt; you can imagine you give birth to a
[39:47] little baby, you breastfeeding 6 months,
[39:50] he's not growing. You give him cereal,
[39:53] every baby food, and it's still not
[39:55] growing.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; That means there is something wrong.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:00] Then we're going to change the food
[40:04] &gt;&gt; because we grow by what we feed on.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; So if you have been coming to church for
[40:10] 10 years and you are still that old
[40:12] person, there is something wrong with
[40:13] you.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's not a food. It is a yummy
[40:19] delicious food but your system cannot
[40:20] carry it.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; And they are the same. They are still in
[40:27] the same old place.
[40:29] Have you thought of that if the Lord
[40:31] tries 10 years from now where will you
[40:33] be?
[40:35] &gt;&gt; What will be your spiritual status?
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[40:40] &gt;&gt; will you be sitting at home just playing
[40:42] table not going to church
[40:44] &gt;&gt; or you going to come when the saints are
[40:45] guarded?
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Let's ask ourself
[40:50] &gt;&gt; just a little trial the world went
[40:52] through through Corona era in 2020.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Look at the church today.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. When the government lock the door,
[40:59] sit at home, only 50 people come to
[41:02] church and that spirit has swept among
[41:05] believers
[41:06] &gt;&gt; and corona is over. But the curse of
[41:09] corona has kept people home
[41:14] &gt;&gt; they love the comfort of their cozy
[41:16] chairs
[41:18] &gt;&gt; that will come to the presence of the
[41:19] lord.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; And people are worse now than they were
[41:26] five years before
[41:26] &gt;&gt; corona. Yes,
[41:28] &gt;&gt; true. That's true.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; But listen here.
[41:34] We grow daily.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; But has repeated it again. We grow
[41:42] daily.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; You can imagine a little baby you born
[41:46] today, tomorrow he's here, the next day
[41:48] is even taller than you,
[41:50] &gt;&gt; even bigger than you.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; But this is just a baby. The pastor will
[41:56] say Steve is my baby but he's bigger
[41:58] than you now but that is a little baby
[42:00] you carried in your hand. What happened
[42:03] &gt;&gt; physically?
[42:04] &gt;&gt; We grow daily. So if we grow daily
[42:07] physically then we got to grow
[42:09] spiritually.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; He said we grow daily.
[42:21] Each day
[42:23] our heart hungers,
[42:27] &gt;&gt; oh glory be to God.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Keeps moving on.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; There is something growing inside of
[42:35] you.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; As the gospel is going forth this
[42:42] morning, I want to tell you there is
[42:45] something growing inside of you. Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Unless there's nothing in you.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; But those who there is something in us,
[42:55] there is something growing in you.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; And that which is growing in you is that
[43:00] which is growing for that perfection.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Father.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; You get bigger, spread out,
[43:16] &gt;&gt; can take more.
[43:18] Paul said
[43:21] when you he told the Corinthians church
[43:24] he said you are maturing
[43:28] growing but when you ought to be
[43:31] churches
[43:32] you are still babies
[43:36] needing teaching. Is that right?
[43:38] &gt;&gt; When you ought to be teachers to him
[43:41] much is given much is expected.
[43:46] Amen.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I've not shown to declare
[43:49] unto you the whole council of God.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; The whole council of God in this end
[43:54] time has been declared to us
[43:56] &gt;&gt; and to him much is given. Much is
[43:58] expected.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; God expect much from us than the
[44:02] denominations
[44:04] &gt;&gt; because we know the problem of God in
[44:05] this time.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; We know the plan of God. We know the
[44:09] church order. We know about God than
[44:12] those in the denominational cycles.
[44:16] We got to come to the expectation that
[44:18] God expect.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; May the Lord have mercy this morning.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[44:28] &gt;&gt; something in there growing out, pushing
[44:30] out, making bigger the Holy Spirit grow
[44:36] in.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; You don't get the Holy Ghost and go and
[44:40] sleep.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. The prophet said
[44:45] one of the evidence of a spiritfilled
[44:48] man is the travailing of the soul.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; He's always travailing. He need more of
[44:57] God.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; And you will not deserve more of God
[45:01] unless there is God here.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; And when there is God there, that is
[45:05] when you deserve more of God.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to the next one. The new
[45:12] birth.
[45:14] It says here if a birth is born from the
[45:18] outside
[45:19] &gt;&gt; from the inside out the child it grows
[45:23] if it leaves. If it doesn't it remains.
[45:28] Is that right?
[45:30] Well a birth is on the inside shouldn't
[45:34] it grow?
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[45:40] When you think or you feel the doctor
[45:42] declared you pregnant maybe one week old
[45:45] or two week old pregnant it seems
[45:47] there's nothing in your belly might be
[45:49] flatter than even mine but there is
[45:51] something in
[45:52] &gt;&gt; yes
[45:53] &gt;&gt; but that thing in you that fetus begin
[45:56] to what grow
[45:59] with time grow enlarges it grows
[46:04] but when there is nothing going on when
[46:06] There is no growth.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; You can imagine five month or 6 month
[46:10] and the belly is like this then
[46:12] something has gone wrong.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; There is no life.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; It's dead.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; But if there is life
[46:20] &gt;&gt; as time goes on it must grow.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Brother says shouldn't it grow?
[46:25] &gt;&gt; It must grow.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; The Christ in your heart ought to be
[46:32] growing daily.
[46:35] Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; The Christ in your heart ought to be
[46:42] growing daily.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Not weekly,
[46:47] &gt;&gt; not monthly, not yearly, but daily.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; The Psalmist said, "Daily
[46:58] walking close to thee.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Let it be, dear Lord. Let it be
[47:06] &gt;&gt; daily.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Not just one is this service or Sunday
[47:12] service, but daily the Christ in your
[47:15] heart
[47:16] &gt;&gt; ought to be growing, getting bigger,
[47:20] &gt;&gt; more powerful, understanding things
[47:23] better.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The things we couldn't
[47:27] understand yesterday, today we
[47:29] understand it better.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the things we are not
[47:33] understanding in this world, we will
[47:35] understand it better by and by.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; When we get there in the fullness of our
[47:41] adoption,
[47:42] &gt;&gt; we will understand it better by and by.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; The Christ in our hearts ought to be
[47:48] growing daily, getting bigger,
[47:51] forgiving,
[47:53] &gt;&gt; working on as God will to Christ be
[47:57] formed in you
[47:59] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; If you have no ability to forgive,
[48:10] then Satan have rented your heart.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Then there is something wrong with you.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; The root of bitterness will kill you.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; It will defile you and it will defile
[48:22] others.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; But when Christ, oh hallelujah,
[48:26] &gt;&gt; is growing in your heart daily,
[48:29] &gt;&gt; you are forgiven. Yes.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; When somebody step you to I forgive you.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Even when they don't apologize.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; I know you hurt me by forgiving you.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; It means you are the big guy.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; True.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; It is children that fight on little
[48:44] petty petty things.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; The top is for me. This coffee belongs
[48:47] to me. This sweet is mine. And the
[48:48] children fight over sweet. Have you seen
[48:51] grown up people fight over sweet?
[48:54] &gt;&gt; And when they pass and you see little
[48:55] kids fight over sweet. Oh, I remember
[48:58] when we were kids, honey. Do you
[49:00] remember when we were kids?
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Like the prophet remember while he hide
[49:04] a toffee from his brother when he stole
[49:06] the handful of popcorn. His kids.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; How can a full grown man have
[49:12] bitterness?
[49:14] &gt;&gt; How can brethren, fullgrown brothers and
[49:16] sisters,
[49:17] &gt;&gt; not forgiving one another
[49:19] &gt;&gt; by biting one another?
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[49:21] &gt;&gt; fighting one another.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[49:22] &gt;&gt; they're not babies. Yes.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; But you got to grow in grace.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; You got to come to maturity.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Walking on as God will
[49:36] &gt;&gt; till Christ be formed in you.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "We must
[49:42] contend with the weak until they are
[49:45] fully matured in Christ."
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No matter how this hand is
[49:52] weak is still part of this body.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Nobody is useless.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The scripture says the less
[50:02] dishonored, the less that is horned, the
[50:04] least part of the body is what God
[50:06] greatly horned.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; We are part born by the spirit of God.
[50:13] By one spirit are we all baptized into
[50:16] one body and that is a mystical body of
[50:19] Christ. Amen.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Got to contend with the weak,
[50:24] &gt;&gt; with one another.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Some are weak, some are
[50:31] feeble,
[50:32] &gt;&gt; but you going to contend.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; We going to contain until they are fully
[50:41] matured in Christ.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Then they are good soldiers. Then they
[50:47] have got the full armor.
[50:49] talk about them. Don't hurt them.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; The things that you hear before when
[50:56] somebody say about you, you get all
[50:59] rough. You got enough beef to fight the
[51:03] goo.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; When you hear it, it's God behind. What
[51:07] happened?
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Is because Christ in you is growing
[51:12] &gt;&gt; daily.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[51:15] Oh, maybe he didn't hear what I said
[51:17] about. He heard it, but he has grown.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; He has grown out. He have left it
[51:23] behind.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Love of them. Make fun of
[51:29] them. They don't pay no attention to
[51:33] it."
[51:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; They got one thing.
[51:37] They are just too big. My just so full
[51:41] of glory.
[51:43] The only thing you have to drop is this
[51:47] old rope of flesh
[51:51] &gt;&gt; and just go on right to glory.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; This body you see here
[51:59] is not a real you.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; This is not the real Isaac.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; This body is a pest house.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; It's just a container. Yes.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; But the real thing is there.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; He said somebody say, you know, somebody
[52:19] said he was a hypocrite. Mrs. Jones, I
[52:22] hope there's no Mrs. Jones here. He said
[52:25] did well. God bless them.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; That means you have earned the career of
[52:32] the tail bearer.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; She couldn't succeed to put seed of
[52:37] discord.
[52:41] Do you know a certain certain thing is
[52:43] going on at that church
[52:45] or not it to be going? Well, I will pray
[52:49] for it.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; It's not my business.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; What goes on in this church is not my
[52:54] business.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; What goes on in that church is not my
[52:57] business.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; What is my business is the cross before
[53:00] me.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; And the world behind me.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; How to be a better Christian than I was
[53:05] yesterday. How Christ ought to be
[53:08] growing in me daily.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; How I ought to be growing daily in the
[53:12] grace of God.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, father.
[53:22] He said, "Oh, if you you are little then
[53:25] you will say, oh, is it? Let me get in
[53:29] which side by side join." See, that is
[53:31] where you get in trouble.
[53:34] That's where you can mature
[53:37] &gt;&gt; when you are willing to take sides
[53:40] &gt;&gt; to cause commotion to cause stri and
[53:42] fight in the church.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; You are not a real Christian.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; But when you get big enough,
[53:54] &gt;&gt; large enough,
[53:56] &gt;&gt; you see swell out. Not only swell out,
[54:01] but grown out. Christ growing in you,
[54:07] &gt;&gt; growing out malice,
[54:09] &gt;&gt; growing out hatred,
[54:11] &gt;&gt; growing out backbiting,
[54:14] &gt;&gt; growing out envy and jealousy,
[54:17] &gt;&gt; taking it out of you,
[54:19] &gt;&gt; push it out,
[54:21] &gt;&gt; as God comes in,
[54:24] just pushes out. You say, "Oh, how
[54:28] little, how juvenile it is,
[54:32] &gt;&gt; how much kiss it is
[54:34] &gt;&gt; to argue and fast."
[54:36] &gt;&gt; But first thing you know,
[54:39] that just grows on over top of it.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; And God no more room for it. Yes.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, I used to hate to see this and hate
[54:50] that. But you know, I just
[54:55] got so I just don't pay any attention to
[54:59] it no more. You are growing.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; And when you begin to grow, nobody will
[55:06] tell you to pay your tithe.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; The pastor don't have to make note about
[55:10] tight paying.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Because you know the best to do. Yes,
[55:15] &gt;&gt; you know the better thing to do.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; A ministry of this that have grown like
[55:21] this, the pastor have no right to waste
[55:23] the time to preach about Taipei
[55:25] &gt;&gt; because that is the obligation of every
[55:27] Christian
[55:29] &gt;&gt; to be part of every member of every
[55:31] church. The prophet says there are three
[55:34] things that qualifies you to be a member
[55:36] of a local assembly.
[55:39] First is your presence.
[55:42] Secondly is your tithe. And third is
[55:45] your offering.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Your tithe and offering qualifies you
[55:50] plus your present to be part of the body
[55:52] of Christ here.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; True.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; So if Christ is growing in you,
[55:57] &gt;&gt; you will learn how to pay your tithe.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, this preacher is picking on us
[56:02] because the pastor said it.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; But Abraham said in a message, how can I
[56:08] overcome? Yes.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; He said the ministers study such places.
[56:13] They look over the congregation and
[56:16] where they see they are falling short,
[56:18] they pick it from there.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; So this morning I'm picking from there.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; When you are growing,
[56:29] &gt;&gt; you will pay your tithe.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Blessed be the name of the
[56:33] Lord.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; You know, you go to the next one.
[56:40] Yeah, you know when you are young
[56:43] they claim you have growing pains when
[56:45] you are growing
[56:48] you know what I mean
[56:52] it means you are getting bigger
[56:56] you know you take your little arms will
[56:59] hurt your legs will hurt when you are
[57:03] growing kids
[57:06] even when a baby is teaching
[57:08] You see little baby sick,
[57:11] &gt;&gt; crying, everything.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; It's because he's growing,
[57:15] &gt;&gt; he begin to bring teeth. Everything
[57:16] hurts.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[57:18] &gt;&gt; I had it. I was getting bigger all the
[57:21] time. Oh my. Hallelujah.
[57:25] Sometimes we have growing pains when we
[57:31] get to be men and women.
[57:35] when we are born in the kingdom of God
[57:39] Christ. But the thing about that it
[57:43] hurts. The thing about this it just
[57:46] makes you so joyful and happy. It's
[57:50] growing pains.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; You are going out. You are getting
[57:57] bigger. Getting to be bigger man now.
[58:00] What you used to be. You can look over
[58:04] things.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; To look over things.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Not just got wider shoulders. That don't
[58:20] mean nothing about it. But you are wider
[58:23] in here. Yeah.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; See, not across here,
[58:29] &gt;&gt; but in here in your heart.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; In here.
[58:39] Here is where you supposed to spread
[58:41] out,
[58:44] &gt;&gt; get bigger in your heart
[58:47] &gt;&gt; on the inside.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; When Christ comes into the heart,
[58:52] &gt;&gt; then he comes into the mouth.
[58:55] Oh, glory be to God. Then he comes into
[58:57] the eyes.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; He comes into the mind. Let the mind of
[59:02] Christ be you.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; He comes into the mouth. He makes you
[59:09] talk different.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; You don't cuss.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; He makes you speak. Bible said gracious
[59:17] words
[59:18] &gt;&gt; proceed out of him.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Anytime you talk, he bring comfort. Yes.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; The scripture said, "Greet one another
[59:26] with hymns and spiritual songs.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Let our words be seasoned with salt."
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord that
[59:37] when a brother comes around you, all
[59:39] that they hear is testimonies,
[59:41] &gt;&gt; testimonies upon testimony.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; That the discouraged comes to you and
[59:45] they become encouraged.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; And the sick get around and they are
[59:48] healed.
[59:50] Because when Christ here gets bigger
[59:53] here, he comes out here.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; He get bigger here. You see holy things.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; And then he gets into the mind.
[1:00:06] You talk different. You don't talk like
[1:00:08] you used to.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Christ got in your mouth.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; When Christ got in your mouth, you stop
[1:00:15] complaining.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; And sisters, when Christ got your mouth,
[1:00:18] you stop nagging. Yes Lord.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; All that you can say is praise the Lord.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; There is no food at home. Praise the
[1:00:25] Lord.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; That mouth cannot praise the Lord and be
[1:00:32] cursing.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; And be fighting and abusing.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; And murmuring. Mamming is an insult to
[1:00:40] God.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; God hate complainers.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; God hate mamming. When they were
[1:00:46] mingling, God signed serpent to bite
[1:00:48] them.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A Christian does not
[1:00:53] complain.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; A Christian does not mama,
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; but a Christian always praise the Lord.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; He said
[1:01:07] grow now from your heart your love you
[1:01:10] had for him till you can grow your
[1:01:12] tongue. Brother, that is a great thing.
[1:01:16] Then the next thing you know, it grows
[1:01:18] into your eyes. The next thing you know,
[1:01:20] you find out that the old lustful things
[1:01:22] you used to look at, you would turn your
[1:01:25] head.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; You are growing.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "When you see a naked
[1:01:30] woman on the street, you turn your
[1:01:31] head."
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Nobody will tell you, you will turn it
[1:01:35] because you are growing. Yes.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Then the first thing you know, you still
[1:01:42] turn your head,
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; but you are thinking. See, after a
[1:01:46] while, it grows into your mind. You
[1:01:49] don't even think about it no more.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. Then you just a
[1:01:54] great big boy. Then
[1:01:57] you are coming into a full matured man
[1:02:02] living for the Lord. So then you are in
[1:02:06] Christ then a new creature.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Oh blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Then you begin to sing thanks to
[1:02:15] Calvary.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; I am not a man that I used to be.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Thanks to Calvary.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Oh blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you father.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:31] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Let's read first Corinthians 13
[1:02:42] 9-30.
[1:02:44] That is slice three. Yeah.
[1:02:47] For we know in part
[1:02:51] and we prophesy
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; in part.
[1:02:56] But when he But when that which is
[1:03:00] perfect is come,
[1:03:04] then
[1:03:06] that which is in part shall be done
[1:03:10] away.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; When I was a child,
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; I speak as a child.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I understood
[1:03:24] as a child.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; I thought
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; like a child.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; But when I became a man,
[1:03:36] I put away childish things.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; For now we see through a glass darkly,
[1:03:46] but then face to face. Now I know in
[1:03:49] part, but then I shall know even as also
[1:03:54] I am known.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; I shall know him.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; And now abided faith, hope, charity,
[1:04:01] these three, but the greatest of these
[1:04:04] is charity.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Praise be the name of the Lord.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Are we getting somewhere, church?
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; When you know in part,
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; you prophesy in part.
[1:04:18] But in this end time, at the opening of
[1:04:20] the full word, at the opening of the
[1:04:22] seventh seal, the full word was born in
[1:04:26] manifestation.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; So you have no excuse to know in part.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; But you have the right to know full
[1:04:34] revelation of the word of God.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; But when that which is perfect is come,
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; then that which is part is done away.
[1:04:43] Amen.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; We have a perfect interpretation of the
[1:04:47] perfect word of God.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; When I was a child, I spake as a child.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; I understood as a child.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; I taught even as a child.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, it's true.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; But when I became a man,
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; I put away childish chains.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Sisters, put away childish chains.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Brothers, put away childish things.
[1:05:12] Lord,
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; let's come back to the church order.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Let's come back to holiness.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Let's come back to DC.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Let's come back to the prayers.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; let's come back to the Holy Ghost
[1:05:24] revival.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Let's come back to paying our tit
[1:05:27] offering.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Chains.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Let's read from Hebrews 6 verse 1-2.
[1:05:41] Slice four.
[1:05:43] He said, "Therefore living the
[1:05:46] principles of the doctrine of Christ,
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; let us go into perfection,
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; church, let us go into perfection."
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Not laying again the foundation of
[1:05:57] repentance from dead works and faith
[1:05:59] towards God, of doctrines, of baptism,
[1:06:02] and of laying of hands, and of
[1:06:04] resurrection of the dead, and of
[1:06:05] internal judgment.
[1:06:08] The bride must come to perfection. Amen.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; The bride must come to full maturity.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; The ministry must come to full maturity.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; We are no longer babies.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Let's read from first Peter 2 verse 2-3.
[1:06:31] Yeah.
[1:06:34] As newborn babies,
[1:06:38] desire the sincere milk of the word
[1:06:43] that ye may grow by.
[1:06:46] If so be ye have tasted that the Lord
[1:06:50] is gracious.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; The Lord is gracious.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; I said the Lord is gracious.
[1:07:02] Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; You see, babies take milk.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Let's read from Hebrews 5:12.
[1:07:14] Hebrews 5:12 says here,
[1:07:17] "For when the time you ought to be
[1:07:20] teachers,
[1:07:22] ye have need that one teach you again,
[1:07:26] which be the first principles of the
[1:07:29] oracles of God, and have become such as
[1:07:32] have need of milk and not of strong
[1:07:35] meat. For everyone that use milk is
[1:07:39] unskillful in the word of righteousness,
[1:07:44] for he is a babe.
[1:07:46] But strong meat belonger to them that
[1:07:49] are of fool age.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Even those who by reason of use their
[1:07:55] senses exercise to desend both good and
[1:07:58] of evil.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; The scripture we read in first Peter
[1:08:01] says as newborn baby desire the sincere
[1:08:04] milk of the word. Yeah,
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; as newborn babies, you believe the Lord
[1:08:07] Jesus, you been baptized in water in
[1:08:09] Jesus name. Is good to desire the
[1:08:10] sincere milk of the word that you may
[1:08:12] grow by. You don't take the milk of the
[1:08:16] word and don't grow.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; You got to grow.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; The church got to grow.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; The ministry got to grow.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; If God has given us a testimony before,
[1:08:27] then we need more testimonies.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; If God has healed before, we need more
[1:08:32] healing. Amen.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; If God has given us deliverance before,
[1:08:34] we need more deliverances.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; If God has given salvation before, we
[1:08:39] need more salvation.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; We no longer remain babies.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; A baby today that hunger and thirst for
[1:08:48] milk. When the baby grows, he does not
[1:08:51] deserve milk again.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Paul said you have to become preachers.
[1:08:56] Now
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; you don't have need of milk but of stone
[1:09:02] meat.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Because you that have milk is unskilled
[1:09:05] in the word of righteousness is a baby.
[1:09:08] But strong meat belongth to them that
[1:09:11] are of full age.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Oh glory be to God. That is why this
[1:09:15] message of the hour is not for
[1:09:17] everybody.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is for grown
[1:09:20] men.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Is for mature people.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; That can take it.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Let's read some more scriptures and some
[1:09:37] more quotes.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:41] Now, let's read here the slice 11 that
[1:09:45] is in Matthew chapter 18 verse 10.
[1:09:50] The scripture says here, "Take heed that
[1:09:53] ye despise not these little one of these
[1:09:57] little ones.
[1:09:59] For I say unto you
[1:10:02] that in heaven
[1:10:04] the angels
[1:10:06] do always behold the face of my father
[1:10:10] which is in heaven."
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:10:14] You see, brother, before you came to
[1:10:16] this world, God took you a picture,
[1:10:21] not the ones we have on our camera phone
[1:10:23] today.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Some years go by, the Genesis will not
[1:10:26] understand us.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; You have to they will come a big camera
[1:10:31] and we react
[1:10:33] and when they finish, they will take the
[1:10:36] film and they go into a dark room.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; To process a picture. So when you have
[1:10:41] been given a picture, you have the
[1:10:43] negative day and you can only process
[1:10:45] the negative and you bring out the
[1:10:47] positive.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; So before we came to this world, God
[1:10:51] took us a picture.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; And it takes the negative
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; to develop the positive.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; But when God took us a picture,
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; he kept the negative there.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; That is our little angel. That is our
[1:11:09] families
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; the word body
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; and brought a positive year.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Our little angels are beholding the face
[1:11:20] of our father.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; This is the mansion
[1:11:27] the scripture is talking about. In my
[1:11:29] father house there are many mansions not
[1:11:32] the building.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; If this earthly tabernacle is being
[1:11:36] dissolved. Amen.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; There is one waiting for us.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; A building up many of hands.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; That is our white body, our tony.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; And that is what we are growing into.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; And that is the fullness of our
[1:11:55] adoption.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; That is the perfection we are desiring
[1:11:58] for.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Those who are the first fruit.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Amenus.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; If you don't have the Holy Spirit, you
[1:12:08] will not know what we are talking about.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's read from Romans 8.
[1:12:15] Thank you, Lord. Romans 8:11
[1:12:18] 14
[1:12:20] uh slice 14. Romans 8:11.
[1:12:24] But in the spirit of him
[1:12:28] that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:12:32] dwell in you.
[1:12:34] He that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:12:38] shall also quicken
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; your mortal bodies.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; By the spirit that dwelleth in you.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Before you receive that quickening, the
[1:12:48] spirit must first dwell in you.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; By the spirit that dwelt in you. And if
[1:12:56] that spirit is in you, then he that rose
[1:12:59] up Christ from the grave, that same
[1:13:01] spirit, that same God shall quicken this
[1:13:04] mortal bodies.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; It takes us the same code. Let's go to
[1:13:11] slice 12. We continue from verse 14.
[1:13:13] Now,
[1:13:17] Romans 8:14-6.
[1:13:20] It says here, "For as many as are led by
[1:13:23] the spirit of God are the sons of God."
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; For ye have not received the spirit of
[1:13:32] bondage against fear, but ye have
[1:13:35] received the spirit of abduction,
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; whereby you cry, aba, father.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:43] The spirit itself beared witness with
[1:13:46] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:13:49] God.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; The children of God are the children of
[1:13:52] God and the children of the devil are
[1:13:54] the children of the devil.
[1:13:58] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. We
[1:14:01] go back to first Peter 1:23 slice 13
[1:14:05] said, "Being born again,
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; not of the corruptible seed,
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; but of the incorruptible
[1:14:15] by the word of God,
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; which liveth and abide forever.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Our first birth was by the will of the
[1:14:24] flesh."
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Not the will of God. So our first birth
[1:14:29] produces death.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; That is why we need another birth.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; That is why we need a second birth. That
[1:14:36] is why we need to be born again.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; That was the first doctrine Jesus
[1:14:41] preached. You must be born again.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; And you cannot be born again except by
[1:14:47] the water and by the spirit.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; And you can only be born again by the
[1:14:53] Holy Ghost baptism.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Now, not being born by the real of the
[1:14:59] flesh, but being born again, not of the
[1:15:02] corruptible seed, hallelujah, but all
[1:15:06] the incorruptible
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; by the word of God.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; We live and abideth forever.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Let's read from this uh message.
[1:15:21] Revelation chapter 5, part one, slice
[1:15:24] 30.
[1:15:27] How many are feeling good?
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Are you feeling good?
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say a bigger amen?
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh
[1:15:39] 610611
[1:15:41] chapter Revelation 5 part 1 paragraph
[1:15:44] 103. Oh, do you see it? All creation is
[1:15:48] groaning.
[1:15:51] Paul said everything is groaning. Look
[1:15:53] at these trees.
[1:15:55] How do you struggle
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; these days? Winter don't come like the
[1:16:01] winter we know before.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; The falls don't show like the falls we
[1:16:05] know before. Even the timing in the
[1:16:07] season have changed.
[1:16:09] The spring doesn't come on time as it
[1:16:11] used to be.
[1:16:13] Look at the flowers how they struggle
[1:16:15] for life just for the fros to tear them
[1:16:19] down. Look at the trees how they
[1:16:21] struggle to hold their branches. How to
[1:16:25] sing glories unto God.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; If the trees and the leaves struggle to
[1:16:30] see glory to God, how much more human
[1:16:32] beings like you
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; that can't even raise your hand and say,
[1:16:36] "Praise the Lord."
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; And you come to church to be like a
[1:16:39] wallflower.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; When you come to church, be loose in the
[1:16:44] spirit.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Turn yourself loose with the
[1:16:49] spirit
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; and worship God in the spirit,
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; with all your strength, with all your
[1:16:56] might.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Don't come to church and be a bench
[1:17:00] warmer.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; You can't even say amen to the word of
[1:17:03] God.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; You come to church and be dozing off.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; You come to church, you can't say amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; the Lord is our spirit.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; And whatever the spirit of the Lord is,
[1:17:15] there is liberty.
[1:17:18] this out to be free.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Be free in the liberty that God has made
[1:17:22] you.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; See everything, all nature, all animals,
[1:17:31] all birds, how it flies from the enemy
[1:17:35] quickly and get away. Everything
[1:17:38] groaning. And we ourselves said Paul, we
[1:17:42] grown too.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Two with them. For we are waiting for
[1:17:47] the redemption of our body.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; there is a better body.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; There is a better tabernacle
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; waiting for us.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Our little angel
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; before the face of our father.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; In that body we don't get sick.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; In that body we don't grow old.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; That body has no gray hair. That body
[1:18:14] has no west pain.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; That body has no knee pain.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; It is a perfect body.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; That body don't die.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Is internal.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; When you get converted and born again,
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; our soul is the one that God converted.
[1:18:39] So you know the funny thing here
[1:18:43] we are having a redeemed soul in an
[1:18:47] unredeemed body.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; That is where nature human carnal nature
[1:18:55] comes in
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; and sometime the devil will tell you you
[1:18:57] are not saved.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Hey get behind me Satan.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; I am saved.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; I am waiting for that great translation
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; when I'll be clothed. Why immortality
[1:19:11] will put on immortality.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; When the incorruptible will put on the
[1:19:16] corruption.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; But now,
[1:19:21] now they did all those years until now.
[1:19:25] Now we have the endness of our
[1:19:28] inheritance.
[1:19:30] Oh my. What do we have? We have the
[1:19:34] evidence that God lives.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; God lives.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; How do I know he lives? Because he lives
[1:19:46] in my heart.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; For our spirit bear record with his
[1:19:51] spirit that we are children of God.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Sorry, pastor.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; I couldn't go slow for you.
[1:20:02] Hallelujah.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; The Lord will help us.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; And we have the evidence that God lives.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; We have the evidence that God is with
[1:20:15] us.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Is he not with us this afternoon?
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, Lord.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; We have the evidence that God has not
[1:20:24] forsaken us.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; He never forsake.
[1:20:28] He never is gone. So count on his
[1:20:32] presence
[1:20:33] in day and in gone. He is with us.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; That he has not forsaken us that we are
[1:20:43] his and he is ours.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Because we in our bodies we now
[1:20:50] tabernacle the Holy Spirit of God that
[1:20:53] cries out aba father. Aba father. And
[1:20:57] there is nothing that can ever take that
[1:21:00] away. We are anchored in Christ.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; When you see the tree blowing, the wind
[1:21:10] blowing the tree like this, it is
[1:21:12] waiting for his redemption.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; If you see the leaves falling down, he's
[1:21:18] waiting for that redemption.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; If you lose a brother, if you lose a
[1:21:21] sister, if you lose a family, a loved
[1:21:23] one, don't worry. They are waiting for
[1:21:26] us. There is a better body. There is a
[1:21:29] better place than this sinful cursed
[1:21:32] world. There is a better place.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, there is a land beyond the river.
[1:21:39] [Music]
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; No matter how rich you are,
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; even if you have $1 million in your
[1:21:45] account, you will never be satisfied
[1:21:47] with this world.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; No matter how healthy you are, don't
[1:21:51] think because oh, he is sick, so he that
[1:21:54] is why he desiring that other place. Or
[1:21:56] don't think, oh, he's a poor preacher.
[1:21:58] He has no money, that is why he does not
[1:21:59] love the world. No, sir.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; It is not for the old man.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; It's not for the old woman. As young as
[1:22:07] you are, be mindful that there is a
[1:22:10] better place.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; There is a lineage on the river
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; in the street by going to meet there
[1:22:17] again.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; But Abraham said, "You might be
[1:22:25] deformed. You can even be walking like
[1:22:26] this, but that body will not be
[1:22:28] deformed.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; It's a perfect body."
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; For we are anchored in Christ.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Now, the trees does not have it. Nature
[1:22:42] does not have it. But yet, we are still
[1:22:44] groaning
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; with them. Because as yet as we haven't
[1:22:49] received the fullness of our adoption,
[1:22:53] but we have the earnestness of it, that
[1:22:56] we were picked up from the things of the
[1:22:58] world and now become sons and daughters
[1:23:00] of God. What kind of people should we
[1:23:03] be?
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my, when we think of that, think of
[1:23:07] it.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Jesus Christ.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:17] I wish we read a scripture before we
[1:23:18] continue this.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Blessed be in the name of the Lord.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's read a scripture in Ephesians
[1:23:32] 1 11-4 slides 15.
[1:23:37] Then we'll come back to the where we
[1:23:39] were reading before. The scripture says
[1:23:42] here in Ephesians 1 verse 11-14,
[1:23:46] in whom
[1:23:48] also we have obtained an inheritance,
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; being predestinated
[1:23:57] according to the purpose of him who
[1:24:00] workketh all things after the counsel of
[1:24:02] his own will.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; That we should be to the praise of his
[1:24:09] glory.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. who first trusted in Christ.
[1:24:13] Sister, trust in Christ,
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; brother. Let's trust in Christ.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; In whom ye also trusted
[1:24:22] after that ye have heard the word of
[1:24:24] truth, the gospel of your salvation, in
[1:24:27] whom also after that ye believed,
[1:24:32] you were saved.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. with the Holy Spirit of
[1:24:34] promise
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; which is the earnest of our inheritance.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is a down payment of
[1:24:45] what we are going into.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; It is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:24:50] until the redemption of the purchase
[1:24:53] possession
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; unto the praise of his glory. Amen.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; If God cannot change his body, he won't
[1:25:03] give you the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; He gave you the Holy Ghost as a down
[1:25:07] payment. He gave you the Holy Ghost as a
[1:25:10] down payment that one day he can change
[1:25:13] this body.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; So, let's continue the last quote. The
[1:25:21] reading in 3131
[1:25:24] from the message Revelation 5 part 1. He
[1:25:27] said now we have the earnestness.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Our spirit is groaning
[1:25:34] for the full adoption.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; There is something grown in me
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; for the perfection.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; I cannot be perfect in this flesh. My
[1:25:44] perfection is in him.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; When a deep call upon a deep,
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; there's a deep somewhere to respond to
[1:25:51] the deep call. I can hear from my
[1:25:53] children
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; screaming my name.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; There is something beyond this flesh.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; There is something beyond this earthly
[1:26:04] realm.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; There is a supernatural presence.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Our little babies, our little angels
[1:26:11] before the face of the father.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:17] As we receive the Holy Spirit, the first
[1:26:21] fruit, it is the end of our complete
[1:26:24] adoption or complete salvation. Oh, how
[1:26:27] beautiful. I just love that.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; All right. We are waiting for the
[1:26:33] fullness of adoption.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; This will take place when at the first
[1:26:39] resurrection.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's when our bodies will be
[1:26:44] changed from these vile creatures that
[1:26:47] we have here in this body like that we
[1:26:51] are and we will have a body like his own
[1:26:55] glorious body
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; for we shall see him
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; as he is
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; and will be like him.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; to be like Jesus.
[1:27:10] Hallelujah.
[1:27:12] [Music]
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; What a desire.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a desire.
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:27:23] hallelujah.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Not to be like the pastor, not to be
[1:27:31] like the president, not to be like the
[1:27:33] prophet, but to be like Jesus.
[1:27:38] If you make any man role model that will
[1:27:40] fail you,
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; your pastor will fail you.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Your prophet will fail you, your
[1:27:45] president will fail you, your wife will
[1:27:47] fail you, your husband will fail you,
[1:27:49] your children will fail you. But Jesus
[1:27:52] will fail us
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; and Jesus is the message of the hour.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. For we
[1:28:03] shall see him as he is and will be like
[1:28:06] him. When he appears, we appear in his
[1:28:10] likeness.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; We will have a body like his.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; A glorious glorified body.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; And all the trial struggles of life will
[1:28:24] fade off into a living mist and blow
[1:28:27] away to never be no more. And the
[1:28:31] psalmist said just once glimpse of his
[1:28:34] face in glory all the toys of life will
[1:28:38] be repaid.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; You will never remember again.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; When a woman is going through birth
[1:28:44] pains
[1:28:46] oh no matter uncomfortable she feels and
[1:28:50] she go through labor
[1:28:53] and pushes out with tears and stress and
[1:28:56] cry and he will never give birth again.
[1:28:59] This pain is so painful. But the moment
[1:29:02] the baby comes out,
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; the joy of life.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; She never f she never remembers that
[1:29:10] pain is vanish. And you see when he was
[1:29:14] going through the pain, I will never
[1:29:16] give up again. In two years time again,
[1:29:20] what happened? I thought you said you
[1:29:22] never go that again.
[1:29:25] Just one glaze,
[1:29:27] you will forget everything.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope my sister still loves me.
[1:29:36] Thank you, Lord. And these earthly
[1:29:39] tabernacles which we now grown in,
[1:29:44] we are waiting for that earnestness for
[1:29:48] the salvation fully in its fullness to
[1:29:50] come.
[1:29:52] But now in these tabernacles of clay, we
[1:29:56] have something that tells us we have
[1:29:59] raised up so far.
[1:30:02] Hallelujah. Amen. What is the NS? It is
[1:30:06] a little down payment that holds it.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Dutch, brother Dutch is not
[1:30:12] here. Brother S is here as old as
[1:30:14] brother Dutch.
[1:30:16] He's the earnest. Now once when you love
[1:30:20] the things of the world. Once when we
[1:30:23] sin and went about doing the things of
[1:30:25] the world and cared not for God, we were
[1:30:28] annated from him without God, without
[1:30:31] Christ in the world. Now God sent his
[1:30:35] holy spirit.
[1:30:37] Oh hallelujah.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; God sent his holy spirit. Amen.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; And through
[1:30:45] that we are lifted up from those things.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Now we have the earnest that we know
[1:30:51] that we are passed from death unto life.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Brother said without divine healing
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; there is no resurrection.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Because divine healing
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; is the earnestness of the resurrection.
[1:31:06] The God that can heal this body is the
[1:31:09] same God that can raise his body.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; If you are sick this morning, receive
[1:31:14] your healing in the name of Jesus
[1:31:16] Christ. Behold,
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; if God cannot heal us, God cannot
[1:31:23] resurrect us. But if God can heal us,
[1:31:26] then it is an evidence. It's a down that
[1:31:30] when this body be dissolved, he can rise
[1:31:33] up again.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Slice 25 from the amazing questions and
[1:31:42] answers part three. He said the word
[1:31:45] that is in you
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; the body will materialize around that
[1:31:51] word.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; And the same thing did by Sarah.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; As we are preaching the word, are you
[1:32:00] are saying amen to the word? You are
[1:32:03] becoming the word. Amen.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; You are what you eat.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; As you receive the word, you become the
[1:32:11] word.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; As we preach, oh, glory be to God. We go
[1:32:16] to Galatians 4:1 19 slide 6. It says,
[1:32:20] "My little children whom I travail
[1:32:25] in again unto Christ be form in you."
[1:32:30] Why are you preaching apostle? I am
[1:32:32] preaching for Christ to be form in you.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Why do we come to church? We come to
[1:32:37] church for Christ to be formed in us.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; This old world can never hold us.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have met my consecration.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Every woman
[1:32:53] to live is Christ. To die is gain. Oh
[1:32:57] death, where is your strength? grave.
[1:33:00] Where is your victory? But thanks be to
[1:33:03] God
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; who has given us victory over death,
[1:33:07] over hell, over the grave. And we are
[1:33:11] more than conquerors. And this
[1:33:13] afternoon, we are sitting in the
[1:33:14] heavenly places
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; We are travailing. We are preaching. We
[1:33:21] are laboring unto Christ
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; before you.
[1:33:28] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Oh, blessed be the
[1:33:39] name of the Lord.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Let's read from slide 17. The end time
[1:33:46] seed.
[1:33:51] What happened?
[1:33:52] An infant church. Hallelujah.
[1:33:55] a bride in fancy
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; that is the power of God has be to fall
[1:34:01] on her
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; she's taking form
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; sister take form
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; let the word of God form you shape you
[1:34:13] this church must take form the ministry
[1:34:15] must take form
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; she is taking form a bride to this
[1:34:20] bridegroom
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; that three stars meant his perfection
[1:34:25] of the heavenly father.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Of the trinity becoming one on earth
[1:34:29] among us.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; God offices becoming one office. What
[1:34:33] happened now is the church of the living
[1:34:36] God coming together under the word of
[1:34:39] God and the astronomic heaven is
[1:34:42] announcing her approach.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Might not believe that but is a word is
[1:34:50] just the same.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Praise Lord.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:57] Thank you, Father.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Jesus.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; The bride in infancy.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; That was 1962. But in 2024, the bride is
[1:35:06] no more in the infancy.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; The bride is now a mature bride.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; We have put away childish sins.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; We are no more babies.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; We are teachers.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Sl 18. Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:35:23] today and forever.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; And when the Holy Spirit that you have
[1:35:27] worshiped under for so long
[1:35:31] is the same Holy Spirit is just like a
[1:35:35] corn growing.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; It's just like a corn growing.
[1:35:42] When I was young, I love planting
[1:35:46] and as a child, I didn't understand
[1:35:48] better. So when I see people so corn on
[1:35:52] and they put fence around it, they put
[1:35:56] wood around it, my little mind was
[1:35:58] telling me it is the wood, the fence
[1:36:01] they put around it that makes the corn
[1:36:03] grow.
[1:36:05] So do you know what I did? When I put a
[1:36:07] seed,
[1:36:09] one seed I put fence around it, one seed
[1:36:12] I put sticks around it, one seed I put
[1:36:15] because in my mind is the wood making it
[1:36:17] grow. And unfortunately it will be
[1:36:20] growing and the leaves will be breaking
[1:36:21] the six
[1:36:24] because I didn't know. You understand?
[1:36:27] He said it's just like a corn growing.
[1:36:30] The first thing is a little stock.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; The next thing is a tassel. The next is
[1:36:36] a grain. The original that went into the
[1:36:40] ground.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; And what it is is it is it any different
[1:36:44] from the stock? The life was in the
[1:36:48] stock made the tassel
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; and the grain
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; but is a f mature stock corn.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what you Methodist and
[1:36:59] Lutherans, what is it? Is the same Holy
[1:37:03] Spirit that brought Luther out of this
[1:37:07] day, that brought Wley out of his day,
[1:37:10] is further mature church than what it
[1:37:15] was then for it is back to the original
[1:37:19] again.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God. The life is back to the
[1:37:28] seed.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; The life that went through the carrier
[1:37:31] of the word that went through the
[1:37:33] tassel, the leaves, the stalk is back to
[1:37:37] the seed word again.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; The church have gone through the dark
[1:37:40] ages have gone through the reformation
[1:37:42] as back to the restoration of the full
[1:37:44] bright tree.
[1:37:46] We read from the exposition of church
[1:37:48] ages the minor church age slice 19.
[1:37:52] But Abraham said here, "If you were a
[1:37:54] true seed,
[1:37:56] you will hear that word, the spirit will
[1:37:59] baptize you into the body of Christ."
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Filling you and empowering you and you
[1:38:06] receive the word for your day and age.
[1:38:09] See how clear the true evidence becomes
[1:38:13] when the word is revealed to you.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Again, note Jesus was a royal seed. He
[1:38:22] lived in a woman body.
[1:38:25] When the spirit called to him, the word
[1:38:28] manifested thought. He went to Jordan
[1:38:31] and there he was baptized in water. Upon
[1:38:34] obeying the word and the holy spirit
[1:38:36] came upon him and the voice said, "This
[1:38:39] is my beloved son.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him."
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Listen carefully. The voice did not say
[1:38:47] this has become my son. But Jesus was
[1:38:52] the son.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit is given to sons.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit does not make us sons.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; You must be a son to benefit the Holy
[1:39:04] Spirit.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost position him as sons
[1:39:08] before them all. Then having been filled
[1:39:11] thus and the same pattern holes as
[1:39:14] Pentecost and after and ever after he
[1:39:18] went in demonstrated power receiving the
[1:39:20] full revelation of God and from God for
[1:39:23] that day. Now we have been constantly
[1:39:28] saying that the true evidence of being
[1:39:32] baptized with the Holy Ghost is for the
[1:39:36] believer to receive the word for the age
[1:39:39] in which he lives.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; True Holy Ghost baptism is for the
[1:39:46] believer to receive the word in the age
[1:39:50] which he lives. Amen.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; That is your evidence.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; How many love the Lord?
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Let me read some few quotes and close
[1:39:59] here. I read from the slice 20 that is
[1:40:01] who is meadc
[1:40:04] paragraph 79 2 Corinthians 5:1. If this
[1:40:07] earthly body be dissolved, this earthly
[1:40:10] tabernacle, we have another one. Praise
[1:40:13] God.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Imagine going on a highway on a top
[1:40:16] speed and your tie bust and there is no
[1:40:19] car, nobody, no mechanic and you don't
[1:40:21] have a spare tire.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do?
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; But the thought and the mind alone to
[1:40:28] know you have a spare tire. You know you
[1:40:29] are rescued.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; You know you have not lose anything.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; You quickly fix it up. You go on your
[1:40:34] journey. Yes.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; And
[1:40:37] Paul says that if our only hope is in
[1:40:42] this world alone, then we are the most
[1:40:44] miserable.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Without a resurrection, we are the most
[1:40:49] miserable.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; We will not resurrect in this body.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; We will resurrect in the perfect body.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; That is what we are growing into.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Now listen carefully here. We have
[1:41:01] another one. See, we have bypassed that
[1:41:06] to come straight from God, the attribute
[1:41:10] to the flesh.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; To be tempted by sin.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; What happened?
[1:41:16] We came from the thought of God,
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; the attribute of God
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; and we bypass the word body, our
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; and we came to this flesh
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; to beed by sin.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; But Jesus, he came from the mind of God,
[1:41:30] the attribute of God. Yes,
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; he went through the word body
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; before becoming the flesh.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; That is why he knew all things and he
[1:41:40] knew what is in all men's heart.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Now for us to go back again to the
[1:41:45] thought of God, that which we bypass, we
[1:41:49] got to come through that way.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; We can't go back to God in this flesh
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; that we put so much on, we can't go back
[1:41:56] there
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; through that.
[1:41:59] But when the testing of this word is
[1:42:02] over, then we are taken up into this
[1:42:05] body that was prepared for us before the
[1:42:08] foundation of the world.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; It is a word there that we skip to come
[1:42:13] right around down here to be tempted and
[1:42:16] tested. If we have come through that,
[1:42:20] there will have been no temptation,
[1:42:23] would have known all things. That the
[1:42:26] reason Jesus know all things because he
[1:42:28] was a word before he was a flesh. Then
[1:42:31] we become the word.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Here we are formed to the word image.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; And the only way we are formed to the
[1:42:42] word image is to preach these things.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; And as you receive the word, you become
[1:42:48] the word.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Line upon line, precept upon precept,
[1:42:53] you are piling something. There is a
[1:42:55] body building in you. One of these days,
[1:42:58] this rob of flesh, you will drop it and
[1:43:01] seize everlasting prize.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Yet we are formed to the word image. We
[1:43:09] partaker of the word, feed on the word
[1:43:12] by being predestinated since the
[1:43:15] beginning. You see, you see the little
[1:43:19] spark of life that you had in you from
[1:43:22] the beginning when you started your
[1:43:24] journey.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; The little spark of life in you, the
[1:43:32] Holy Ghost. When you started your
[1:43:34] journey, the gem of life, if there is no
[1:43:37] seed gem of life in you, you cannot
[1:43:39] receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz the seed gem is there to receive the
[1:43:43] Holy Ghost.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; We read from the next one, slice 21,
[1:43:53] questions and answers,
[1:43:55] part four. He said this is a dying
[1:44:00] spirit in a dying body. But now you
[1:44:04] can't be in two bodies at the same time.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; But there can be two natures in you at a
[1:44:10] time. Now the nature of the spirit of
[1:44:12] the lord when you are born again
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; you are not born of the physical like
[1:44:17] the baby was but what happened the
[1:44:20] spiritual birth has come to you and why
[1:44:24] this spiritual birth is growing into
[1:44:27] your heart of god into your heart of god
[1:44:31] there is a physical or a celestial body
[1:44:35] growing to receive that spirit
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; oh come on church.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; There is a celestial body growing to
[1:44:46] receive that spirit.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; And when the life leave this body, it
[1:44:50] goes to that body.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; When man was created and the Lord breath
[1:44:58] in the nurture of man receive ye life
[1:45:01] and man became a living soul. When our
[1:45:04] last breath is given up on this world,
[1:45:06] it goes back to that body waiting for
[1:45:08] us. Amen.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Just as when the body is presented to
[1:45:12] the earth, the spirit comes in. And when
[1:45:15] the spirit goes out of the body, there
[1:45:17] is a body waiting. For we know that if
[1:45:20] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we
[1:45:22] have already one waiting.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:45:28] Thank you, Father.
[1:45:31] Oh, thank you, Jesus. I love the Lord.
[1:45:34] Do you love the Lord?
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Blessed be the name
[1:45:38] of the Lord.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Father.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Let me just share some testimonies so
[1:45:47] that we close.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; I've been a missionary over 10 years by
[1:45:53] the special grace of God. Traveled to
[1:45:56] many countries to proclaim this message
[1:45:59] of the hour and I have seen the mighty
[1:46:01] hand of God. In many countries, the Lord
[1:46:04] have led me. I share some few
[1:46:07] testimonies with pastor and the wife
[1:46:08] back home. We might not have time to
[1:46:11] share all but I will give you one or two
[1:46:13] little ones to encourage your faith
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; to know that you are believing the truth
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; and stand by what you know and what you
[1:46:20] believe. Amen and amen.
[1:46:24] Some years ago, I was on a journey
[1:46:27] from East Africa to c uh South Africa
[1:46:31] and uh on the border crossing between
[1:46:35] there is a way between Tanzania and uh
[1:46:39] Malawi.
[1:46:40] But somehow somewhere I ask everybody
[1:46:44] nobody can show me that direct border.
[1:46:46] So I have to go through Malawi
[1:46:49] like Jesus. He was to pass this way and
[1:46:52] that was not part of the program.
[1:46:55] So when I went to the border, the
[1:46:57] immigration gave me a tough time trying
[1:47:00] to take bribe and arrest.
[1:47:02] I said I was just transiting. I'm going
[1:47:04] to Mosmbique. So you are not going
[1:47:05] unless you pay. And instead of 50 bucks,
[1:47:08] they charge me 100 bucks that somehow I
[1:47:12] have to go through. So at the border now
[1:47:15] I'm leaving from Malawi to enter
[1:47:17] Mozambique. I always travel with books
[1:47:20] and testify with trucks. So I was
[1:47:22] sharing in the bus with my number and my
[1:47:25] name behind and I left Mozambi. Three
[1:47:28] month later when I came back to Ghana
[1:47:29] begin to receive a message from a pastor
[1:47:32] in Malawi.
[1:47:34] Same pastor Matthew Abel you gave me a
[1:47:37] book in the car. I've been a pastor for
[1:47:40] many years but I've never seen this type
[1:47:41] of message before. Can you bring this
[1:47:44] gospel to Malari? But when I remember
[1:47:47] the two more I went through at the
[1:47:48] border I have already vowed not going to
[1:47:51] go to that country
[1:47:53] and the more I was delaying God was
[1:47:55] giving them visions in the church.
[1:47:56] People that does not know me they'll be
[1:47:57] describing me to the pastor.
[1:48:00] I'll be praying wait on God and God is
[1:48:01] tempting me go. And I said God no no no
[1:48:06] God have to pass revelation to my
[1:48:08] mother. I said my son I've seen you
[1:48:09] somewhere preaching the gospel and God
[1:48:10] is doing great things and miracles. So
[1:48:13] finally I have to give I have to go
[1:48:14] back. When I went to the border
[1:48:17] surprisingly these immigration officers
[1:48:19] met me they saw me again said you we
[1:48:20] know you
[1:48:22] you are not going to cross unless you
[1:48:24] pay back the same 100 bucks. I said the
[1:48:26] last time I pay 100 you gave me 50 bucks
[1:48:28] ticket or receipt. Now I'm going to pay
[1:48:30] 50. Then they took the passport refuse
[1:48:32] entry
[1:48:34] and I told God you see why I didn't want
[1:48:36] to go like Jonah. Lord I know you are
[1:48:39] merciful. I didn't want to go because
[1:48:41] when the people cry for mercy, you
[1:48:43] forgive them.
[1:48:45] Yet God said go. So finally I have to go
[1:48:48] through. When I arrived the pastor was
[1:48:51] telling me do you know why I invited
[1:48:53] you? I said no. Said that day in a bus
[1:48:57] I kept hearing the voice of God telling
[1:48:59] me there is a blessing in this bus.
[1:49:02] There is a blessing in this bus. I look
[1:49:04] around praying where is that blessing?
[1:49:07] And nothing was responding. And I'm
[1:49:10] Recently a preacher, a Pentecostal
[1:49:13] preacher came preaching. So I begin to
[1:49:14] communicate with God in prayer. Is that
[1:49:16] a blessing? No. No. No. No answer. But
[1:49:20] the preacher got out. So I look at the
[1:49:23] entrance. There was a little boy sitting
[1:49:24] down there babbling his mouth. Whether
[1:49:26] he's praying or singing, we don't know.
[1:49:29] Then when I was going out, you gave me a
[1:49:31] book. Said immediately I received that
[1:49:34] book. Then a voice spoke back to me.
[1:49:37] That is a blessing.
[1:49:40] So when he went home said how can this
[1:49:42] little boy be a blessing? Thank God I
[1:49:44] need that blessing.
[1:49:47] So when he told me that I was shocked I
[1:49:49] said okay it's a book that is a blessing
[1:49:52] not me. He said no you are my blessing.
[1:49:55] I said no is a book. Then you know what
[1:49:58] he said as long as you are carrying that
[1:50:01] book you are also blessed.
[1:50:05] Then the Lord brought the scripture back
[1:50:07] to my mind. Revelation 1:3, blessed are
[1:50:10] those. Can you put it on the board?
[1:50:11] Let's read that scripture in closing.
[1:50:14] Then Revelation, it's not in the notes
[1:50:16] here. Just direct from the Bible. It's
[1:50:18] not in the notes here. Revelation 1:3
[1:50:21] said, "Blessed are those who reads,
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; who hears
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; and those who keep these words of
[1:50:28] prophecy."
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; That is when I understand that
[1:50:32] scripture. So I asked myself this
[1:50:34] message we don't play the tapes again
[1:50:36] the books we don't have time to read
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; not knowing they are blessed
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; hey my brother
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; he open up his church we had revival
[1:50:46] my we organized ministers meeting among
[1:50:48] 50 churches 50 50 ministers the first
[1:50:52] meeting the female preacher resigned the
[1:50:54] second meeting in the evening the
[1:50:56] pastors want to get baptized we baptized
[1:50:58] five churches at that time a year or two
[1:51:01] God took me to the middle part of
[1:51:02] Malario called Muzu baptized five
[1:51:05] pentacosta churches there and this
[1:51:07] testimony has been going around there
[1:51:10] even in Kenya in Uganda. God is doing
[1:51:13] wonderful works there through my
[1:51:15] ministry
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; under this Elijah ministry.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; God give me grace among denominational
[1:51:20] churches that I go I preach this gospel
[1:51:22] to them
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; and they resurrect from their dead
[1:51:26] denominationalism
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; and they say we want to baptize in Jesus
[1:51:29] name.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:31] Last December, we baptized three
[1:51:33] churches in in Kenya. And what I love
[1:51:36] about this is is a city in Kenya called
[1:51:39] Edorit. When a long-standing message
[1:51:41] preacher have turn his back and get the
[1:51:43] message has burned the books in that
[1:51:45] same city, God has given us three new
[1:51:47] churches.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; We baptize the pastors in Jesus name.
[1:51:51] And last April when I was there by the
[1:51:53] grace of God, we baptized the whole
[1:51:55] church and extra pastors. And now they
[1:51:58] begin to receive the books. They begin
[1:52:00] to study the word
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; and they are rejoicing.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; And one thing I love about God, he gives
[1:52:05] them visions and supernatural presence.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Last year when I was there in December,
[1:52:10] the Lord spoke to one of the pastors and
[1:52:12] he told him in a vision. He wrote it
[1:52:14] down. The Lord told him, "This man is a
[1:52:17] voice to the nations."
[1:52:19] So he didn't argue. His wife was a
[1:52:22] female preacher. She resigned and they
[1:52:24] were baptized the same day in Jesus
[1:52:25] name.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I was going back again this
[1:52:28] year, God gave them a vision. They saw a
[1:52:31] land, a field with stamps and trees.
[1:52:34] Said, "Apostle, we saw you coming with a
[1:52:36] sword. You begin to approot them. Begin
[1:52:39] to approve those trees and you begin to
[1:52:41] plant new seeds."
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; I said, "Glory be to God."
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Say, "Do you know what is happening?"
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; For the first time, I preached for four
[1:52:50] and a half hour.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Never in my life.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Not once. Two times the people were
[1:52:57] writing were hungry. They were hearing
[1:52:59] from their
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; They were hearing from their chop.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; It was a hard message. I told them you
[1:53:09] want to know what is happening. God is
[1:53:11] uprooting the storms of Christ,
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; the storms of denominationalism and we
[1:53:16] are sewing the seed of the message of
[1:53:18] the hour.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. In
[1:53:22] Malawi, there was a woman with a
[1:53:24] cervical cancer. When she was baptized
[1:53:26] in Jesus Christ's name, she was healed.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; In Kenya, by the preaching of the
[1:53:31] gospel, there was a sister who have a
[1:53:33] stomach infirmity for 3 years. I've gone
[1:53:35] through hospital taken every medicine.
[1:53:37] But by the preaching of the gospel, she
[1:53:39] was ill back there.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; And if you can't believe it will be your
[1:53:42] portion also.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Last year, there was a case,
[1:53:45] a sister who was hit by a motorbike in
[1:53:48] Kenya for 12 years. She had that
[1:53:50] vertebra problem. She couldn't sleep one
[1:53:52] side. She couldn't walk. She couldn't go
[1:53:54] to the market. But when she came to the
[1:53:56] altar, was prayed for in the name of
[1:53:58] Jesus, God took her pain.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; She went back to the doctor and the
[1:54:03] everything showed perfectly.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; The same God of Abraham is here today
[1:54:07] with us.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; The same angel of God is still here.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; He's the same God in this message
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; everywhere vindicating himself. The same
[1:54:17] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; And one thing I thank God for and I
[1:54:22] always pray whenever I go to preach, I
[1:54:24] ask God for a notable miracle
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; to confirm his word.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Friends, there is a blessing in this
[1:54:33] message.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; There is a healing in this message.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; There is deliverance in this message.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; There is an abundance of the power of
[1:54:41] God in this message.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; We just don't have the the mechanic. We
[1:54:45] have the dynamics.
[1:54:48] Hallelujah.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; We have another body
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; waiting for us.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Whether we live or we die, we live for
[1:55:00] the Lord and we die to the Lord, we have
[1:55:04] lose nothing.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Because we have make our consecration.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; As a musician, resume the seat now.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Friends, I have
[1:55:16] testified to you by the grace of God
[1:55:19] that this message is the truth.

[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Keep pressing on.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Keep pressing on. One of these days we
[1:55:30] shall be changed.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; In the pinnacle of an eye.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; And the corruptible will be put on the
[1:55:37] incorruptible.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; We shall receive a new body. And when he
[1:55:42] shall appear, we shall be like him. Give
[1:55:45] me the desire. Why don't you stand to
[1:55:48] your feet and receive your heart desire
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; to be like Jesus? To be like Jesus. From
