There was a a prayer request from Sister Claudia and it's for a sister named Esparanza Ramos and she met uh Sister Anita and then somehow she met Sister Claudia, my mother-in-law, and they they both testified to her and I think she's she's looking in her heart she's looking for the Lord. So, it says she's she needs prayer. She's in back home for uh some medical things and then she's looking to come back here and possibly come here. So, the Lord knows and the Lord knows how to get a hold of somebody and help with the right people in the path. Maybe I can ask brother Zigg if he can come up and open a word of prayer and we'll just keep it. The brother that's traveling and his family that's way and then [Music] Praise the Lord. Can you say amen with me? &gt;&gt; Is it good to be in the house of the Lord? Amen. I'm happy to be here. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise God. Lord Jesus, this morning we want to praise you.

And I'll follow one day at a time. Um, brother brother Zig asked me to sing and I was uh this morning in the bench just flipping through this book and I saw a lot of these old songs and it brought back memories of when I was younger just worshiping the Lord in service and a lot of these are just simple little courses. Um there's no verses to them, but they speak to my soul. And um I'm just gonna sing one of them. He came to me. He came to me when I could not come to where he was. He came to me. [Music] That's why he died on Calary. When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. Oh, he came to me. He came to me [Music] when I could not come to where he was. He came to me and that's why he died. for Calary. [Music] When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. Oh, he came to me. Oh, he came to me [Music] when I could not come to where he was. He came to me and that's why he died. [Music] on Calary when I could not come to where he was. He came to me when I could not come to where he was. He came to me. [Music] Amen. [Music] Let's sing one more song as brother Moses would come. What will it be when we get over yonder? [Music] What will it be when we get over yonder and join the throng upon the glassy sea. We'll join our loved ones and crown Christ forever. Oh, this is just what heaven means to me. A country where no tw shadows deepen. Where night will never be. A city where the storm clouds cannot gather. Oh, this is just what heaven means to me. What will it be when we get over yonder [Music] and join the throng upon the glassy sea? We'll join our loved ones and crown Christ forever. Oh, this is just what heaven means to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are so happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. As the pastor said, we are we are happy to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; David was happy when he was going to the house of the Lord. How much more the bride of the end time is happy to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Does it sound good? Is it is it coming out? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wonderful. Pastor was making a sign to bring. So I was like Andre. Wonderful. It's good the Lord and I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Once again I have a few announcement here and just want to make it out out of the way and then we let the word of God come. So we had a wonderful youth meeting with few people but was more personal and uh just share the word of God as we know we are in the group we are listening to the tape of brother Banham so the tape message and we just gather around that and we share what what the message was saying. Oh, I can tell you it's wonderful to hear the young people telling you what the prophet said. And I say, "Oh, this is what the prophet said." And touched my heart and it really uh spoke to me. I was like, "Oh, Lord." Um, oh, that's so wonderful to see that God can still speak even to the young people and the message is still alive. The message is not only for the older one. The message speaks even to the younger one. So it was an encouragement to me and may God continue to bless you and sister and brothers and sisters and brother who are there and God bless you richly and we continue to do that and um and uh just God blessing them and encouraging them. So there are many things to do and we just uh believe in God working. Amen. And thank God for for the website brother Peter is working on. Amen.

Friends, there's one there's only one thing that God Amen can fail to do and that's break his promise. Amen. So, Amen. It's a good place to stand on his promises of his word this morning. Amen. And it's good to be here you with you with you this morning and um just to see brother Moses and thank you for the invitation brother Zigg and to see just the the transition but also just the support and the love. Amen. And we want to thank the Lord for that. Amen. And give God all the praise. &gt;&gt; Did you come expecting this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, praise be to God. Amen. Because you get what you expect. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's let's just pray and ask God's blessing as we just approach the word. Father, Lord, we love you this morning. We thank you for your grace, your mercy, your love, your care, Lord, and how you brought us here this morning, Lord. Father, Lord, a predestinated time and place, Lord, where you could meet us, Lord. And as Lord, Brother Zigg prayed or mentioned or Lord stated this morning, Father, Lord, that Father, you commanded us, Lord, to forsake not the assembling of ourselves together. And Lord, it's a joy to be here this morning, Father. Lord, it gives us joy to come and to feel your presence Lord and to be amongst believers Lord and to Lord and to fellowship Lord around the word and to fulfill your word Lord and and to Lord fulfill that Lord where the carcass is Lord there the eagles are gathered together and where Lord I believe I'm amongst eagles this morning Lord and we're gathered Lord around the unfailing body word of the son of man Lord we're not gathered Lord around some man's idea Lord or some dead carcass Lord Lord, of a word of a past day, but Lord, we're here, Lord, to feed on the on the unfailing body word of the son of man, Lord Jesus. And you're here to confirm your word, Lord, and confirm your promises, oh God, that where two or three are gathered in your name, Lord, there you will be, Lord. And we believe that you're here, Lord. Come, Lord, and speak to us, Lord. Come and make love to us this morning, Lord Jesus. Lord, we go past the living room, Lord. We go past the kitchen, Lord. Lord, bring us into that bedroom this morning, Lord, where you can give life, Lord. And Father, and have fellowship, Lord, and communion, Lord, and intimacy with us, Lord, we pray. Bless this congregation, Father. Bless, Lord, Brother Moses, Brother Zigg, the elders, Lord, each and everyone, oh God. Lord, for your glory, Lord, that we might, Lord, do your will, Lord, and be pleasing to you, Father. Have your way this morning. We ask in the name of Jesus Christ we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. if you turn with me in your Bibles, let's just get right to the word. And I would just ask for your prayer this morning because um you know, I'm trying to combine two services into one. So um you just pray that I just say what I need to say or not need to say, but what the Lord wants me to say and shut my mouth to what he doesn't want me to say this morning. Amen. Will you pray for me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah 35. If you turn in your Bibles, um Isaiah 35, we'll read verse 8 through10. I want to speak to you this morning on the way of holiness. The way of holiness. And I just want you to not think that you know exactly where I'm going. Amen. But just amen. Have your hearts open and just and pull on the word and and and we'll the Lord will just bless us this morning. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 8, the Bible says, "A highway shall there be shall be there rather and a way, and it shall be called the way of holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for those the wayfairing men, though fool shall not heir therein." Verse nine, though no line shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go on go up thereon, it shall not be found there, but the redeemed shall walk there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 10. And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads, and they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a sure word of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may be seated. Amen. Brother Brandham would take this exact text of Isaiah 35 and read these verses and take a message called God God's Way that's been made for us. And he'd start off by saying, you know, if you were wanting to go to a place and he would say New York, but it could be any place, Calgary or Florida or Europe or wherever. Well, let let's just use, you know, Calgary or to Vancouver. Amen. The first thing you do is get yourself a map. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, many of you maybe traveled the road to Vancouver or you know the way but Amen. say you didn't know where you were going rather and you and you needed to get somewhere. Amen. You'd get yourself a map. Amen. Now nowadays it's a little different, right? Our map is our phone. Just get up Google Maps and punch it in. But you know, I thought I brought this here this morning. Anybody seen any of these? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I see some nods. Yeah. Now, this has been in my car for probably the last 15, 20 years. Amen. We used to get out and get I was in Vancouver and you know just oh man I need to get to this address and you'd get it out and my wife would okay now where do we need to go and oh you need to turn left and oh my it was just a it was a chore wasn't it amen and it was a chore just even to get this back into the glove compartment and and so thank God that we have an easier way now but you know we when we want to get to a place you need to know where you're at &gt;&gt; you know where you need to where you're starting to get where you're going you need to have a direction and God, amen, has a way. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I like what brother Brandham says next here. And and he would say in God's way that's been made for us. He says, "Now there's no shortcuts in God's kingdom." You know, we try to make a shortcut. We get out here in a pond somewhere and mire down. And that's what we do when we get off the grand old highway of God. For God made a path a way. And it and he doesn't have shortcuts, friends. You know, I I was thinking about, you know, and as I was pre- preaching this the the first time is that if you've read the book Pilgrim's Progress or maybe you've seen the film or whatever, and when Pilgrim tried to take a shortcut, right, he got on to I I believe it was called the bypath Meadow. And oh, it seemed good and it seemed like a better way until he met Giant Despair. You see? Amen. There's no shortcuts, friends, in God's way. Amen. There's God's way and God's way. And God's way often seems strange. You know, you think of the children of Israel when God took them out of Egypt there. Amen. It He seemed like a poor navigator to take them right to the Red Sea. Is that correct? Amen. It seemed But that was God's way. God's way was through the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; But it seemed like how is this God's way? Here we are, the my mountain on each side of us and the Red Sea before us and Pharaoh's army right behind us. What's going on? And they begin to cry out to God. But God said, "Amen. That's the way I want you to go. Now, be still and know that I am God. You see, Amen. We need to trust in his way. And I like what he said here, and I've loved this this this next quote where Brother Brandon would say, he says, "Now God has a way, a provided way." And and watch this. There's two ways a man can go. How many have read this quote? Amen. And that's his way or God's way. &gt;&gt; I feel like I'm loud. Is it all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the right way or the wrong way. Now watch this. And your way is always the wrong way. &gt;&gt; So there's two ways we can go, friends. There's God's way and there's our way. And God's way is the right way. And your way, my way is the wrong way. &gt;&gt; Well, praise God. Amen. And you can't be in your own way and in God's way at the same time. &gt;&gt; So what do you got to do? You got to get out of your own way so God can have his way in you. And friends, that's what I want to do this morning, friends. I want to get out of my way. Get out of my own mind. What I want to say this morning, friends, and get in his way. &gt;&gt; How many want him to have his way this morning, friends? Amen. But friends, I I I I say this is it's so simple. Amen. But it's hard for us sometimes because we think our way is the right way. Oh, we think it all the time. Well, my way of doing things is the right way and our way of of doing this and our way of conducting the song service and our way of playing this song and our way of this and our way of whatever. But friends, the only right way is God's way. &gt;&gt; And God's way is his word. &gt;&gt; Well, glory be to God. Amen. Solomon wrote in the book of Proverbs, "There is a way which seemth right to man, but the end thereof there with are the ways of death." Because you know, when you look at Sarah thought that her way was the right way. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, it seemed like every other way it nothing had worked. &gt;&gt; So, her way, well, I it must be it could, you know, maybe God wants the seed to come through Hagar. She's my she's my maid servant. But friends, it made a mess of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, she thought it was the right way, but God had a way. It was going to be through Sarah. &gt;&gt; And you might think, friends, oh, this way is the right way and this is the way. This is the way it's going to happen. I don't know, friends. Amen. Let's get in God's way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You think of Cain. Amen. He thought his way of worship was right. I mean, he thought he he thought he was so right that even when God told him, "That's not the right way. This is my way. Just do what your brother did and I'll accept you." He was so convinced that his way was right, that he didn't want to change. Now, watch this. And and brother Brandon would say about Cain's religion. And I want you to catch this. He says, "Now there, Lord, I built an altar." He's speaking for Cain. I built a church. I'm a good church member. I go to church every day. I come here, built the altar. I put the sacrifice upon it. Now, I'm going to kneel down and pray. And Lord, I want you to receive me &gt;&gt; Cain's way. &gt;&gt; I go to church. I'm a good church member. Oh, &gt;&gt; I'm a good message believer. I come to church. I go to Restored Word. And now I'm kneeling at your altar and I want you to receive me. Did you come God's way? &gt;&gt; Guess what? God refused it. Now which way do you intend? Amen. To serve the Lord. There's many ways. There's the Baptist way. There's the Methodist way. There's the Pentecostal way. There's a Presbyterian way, the Catholic way, the message way. &gt;&gt; How about God's way? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Let's look at Isaiah 35 if you're still there. Verse 8 says, "And a highway shall there be and a way." Now, the scripture is making a difference there that there's a highway and a way. See, and brother B would say, "And is a conjunction." So, there's a highway and a way. And if you look at the Greek, the highway just means a road. It's a highway. It's a road. But if you look at the way, it actually means it's it's a little deeper. It's the way, road, distance, journey, manner, path, direction, habit, course of life of moral character. So it's not just a road, it's a course of life. It's a way of life. It's a manner. It's a journey. And it shall be what? The way of holiness. Holiness is a partness. Holiness, sacredness. A partness to what? Aartness to who? Sacredness to who? To God. &gt;&gt; The unclean shall not pass over it. So friends, not just anybody can walk in this way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The unclean will not walk in this way. Why? It's the way of holiness. And like Peter would say, but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In all manner of conversation, because it is written, be ye holy, for I'm holy. You know, you would say to yourself, "But I'm I don't see myself as holy. I make so many mistakes. I fail here and there." And friends, I would say, "I'm with you." &gt;&gt; I'm right there. But friends, it's not about your holiness. &gt;&gt; Well, glory be to God. Friends, if we want to if we trust in our holiness or our righteousness, friends, we are going to be disappointed. We are going to get depressed. Amen. It's his holiness. It's his righteousness. He offers you a trade this morning. Trade in your righteousness, your good works, your holiness for his holiness. You see, Peter would would describe the mount transfiguration as the holy mount. And brother Brandon would go on to say that it was not so much the mountain that was holy, but it was the holy God that was on that mountain that made the holy that made that mountain holy. And friends, it's not the holy people, but it's the holy God, amen, that's living in you this morning that makes you holy. It was not the ground so much that Moses was on there. That was holy ground. But it was the holy God that was on that ground. And we are standing on holy ground this morning, friends, because the holy God is in our midst. &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. But you would see here in the way of holiness. Now watch this. Amen. Who is it actually for? But it shall be for those the wayfairing men and women, pilgrims, sojourers. How many's a pilgrim this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're just passing through. &gt;&gt; This world is not my home. &gt;&gt; I'm just a passing through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've got another home, friends. I come from God. I'm going back to God. How about you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Friends. Amen. They talk about aliens. They talk about UFOs. Friends, you're the alien. Amen. We don't belong out here. We come from another world. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up there on it. Shall not be found there, but the redeemed. &gt;&gt; The redeemed. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be any ravenous or any roaring Satan going like a roaring lion. But the redeemed, &gt;&gt; the redeemed. I'm speaking to the redeemed this morning, friends. You shall walk on that way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, watch here in Hebrews chapter 1. I mean, the the the message Brother Brown was preaching. In Hebrews chapter 1, he says they used to talk about the highway of holiness. Now, if you read over that, they get that out of Isaiah the 35th chapter. Now, if you notice, he said, "There shall be a highway and a way." Now, and is a conjunction. Uh it wasn't a highway of holiness. &gt;&gt; It shall be a highway and a way, and it shall be called the way of holiness, not the highway of holiness. the way of holiness and the way of the road is the middle of the road. Wow. That that puts a little bit of a different perspective on this scripture. He's saying now the way of any road is the middle of the road. My that's where the redeemed are going to walk in the middle of the road. &gt;&gt; Amen. The unclean are on either side. And I don't want to get ahead of myself, but you see, when a road is designed a certain way, &gt;&gt; right? It's not like this, it's not flat. It's it's got a curvature to it. Amen. That when the junk and the trash and the garbage gets on the road and the rain comes, it washes it to the side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, there's a way of holiness. It's in the middle of the road. All the trash is on the side. &gt;&gt; But watch this. And now, Brother Brand will pick it up. It's built like this so that the waters will wash off the trash to both sides. Keeping the road clean. You don't you have you don't you have puddles standing in your road all the time if it isn't built right. The way he it's in quotes is the middle of the road. And brother Brandon would say, "Well, that ain't sensible." Amen. You drive in the middle of the road, you're liable to get in a collision and get in a crash. He said, "Brother, this is not a two-way road. It's a one-way road." &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We're going to glory. &gt;&gt; I'm not going that way. I'm not going back. &gt;&gt; I have decided to follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; No turning back. &gt;&gt; You You're getting a collision. You're going the wrong way. &gt;&gt; You're going back to Egypt, friends. We're going to glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, on this road, now watch this. He begins to This is all the same quote here. He begins to bring it down. Now he says, "Now the way of holiness is actually the middle of the road." And now he continues, "Watch this. Now on this side, when people get converted, their minds is set right on Christ. And if they're just a little scholarly scholarly and don't keep under prayer, they'll get real cold and stiff and starchy and indifferent." one side of the road, &gt;&gt; saved, converted, &gt;&gt; love the Lord, mind set on Christ, but they're real scholarly, real studious. Nothing wrong with that. But they're students of the word. These people just know the word inside out. They can pick up every syllable, every comma, every oh, they just study it. There's nothing wrong. They really know the word, and they'll let you know when you misquote it. But what they often miss is the spirit of it. &gt;&gt; And if they're not careful, what does he say? They get cold, &gt;&gt; stiff, &gt;&gt; starchy, and indifferent. That ain't good. &gt;&gt; We don't want that. But then there's the other side. Now then, if they're just a little bit nervous, if you don't watch, they'll just get radical and wild. &gt;&gt; The other side. &gt;&gt; So you got one side that's cold and stiff and starchy. They know the word. Amen. Then you got the other side. They're real nervous, but they're fanatical on this side. See, they go into sensations and everything. Oh my. When the Holy Spirit starts moving through the building, they're the first ones to cry out and oh, shout and scream. Nothing wrong with that. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. A real dynamic preacher comes and they're just, oh, amen. Hallelujah. Amen. But when they get out of that presence, &gt;&gt; they don't know if they're saved or not. my they don't feel God for one service and they're wondering about their salvation. &gt;&gt; Two sides of the road. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; How many remember brother Brown talking about, you know, the two classes of people or two, you know, the the two types of people that he would encounter in the church, right? You know, one was the scholarly type, the more the Baptist type. My they fundamentally they know where they stand. They know who they are. They know what the word says, right? Amen. They can positionally place themselves in scripture. just go back and forth, Old Testament, New Testament, just show him through the scripture, but they don't have much faith, right? But then there's the other one. He's the Pentecostal. My He's got faith. He's got emotion. He She's got whatever, right? Oh, they But it's it's like, you know, he says, you know, one knows how to write the check. &gt;&gt; Oh, they just know how to write the check and claim the promises, but there ain't no money in the bank. And then the other one has all the money in the bank came in, but they don't know how to write the check. They don't know their PIN number. They don't know how to use a credit card. &gt;&gt; We all do. They made it real easy. But Amen. What would you rather have? You know, Brother Brandon would say, if you could only just get the two together. &gt;&gt; Then you've got something. What do you have? The middle of the road, the way of holiness. That's what we're striving for, friends. I I want to know how to write the check. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want to I and know that I've got enough money in the bank to back it up. &gt;&gt; Right. Hallelujah. Amen. And friends, I I want to know who I am, where I stand, and be able to rejoice about it. &gt;&gt; Have some freedom. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We can just get so mature in the message. And oh, I I we get so mature, friends, that we say, I know I know ex I know exactly what direction he's going in. Oh, I heard you heard that. Tell me something better. Tell me something new. Come on, friends. Amen. Let's humble ourselves to the word. Amen. And stop thinking that we know everything. We don't know anything the way we ought to know. &gt;&gt; Well, praise God. Cuz you know, because we've all got the message now. We can look up the quotes. We can read the Bible. We got it all at our fingertips. And we got a bunch of head knowledge. &gt;&gt; What we need is the life. I hope that's all right. &gt;&gt; Watch this. He says, "Now, but the real church." How many's part of the real church? &gt;&gt; Is a real sane gospel right in the middle of the road. It's not cold and starchy. Neither is it fanaticism. It's a real good old warm gospel. Heartfelt love of God going right down the middle of the road calling from both sides. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, when we need to be quiet, we're quiet. &gt;&gt; Write, pick up your pen and write, "The bride knows what to do with the word. Even she has thus sayith the Lord or she keeps silent." &gt;&gt; She knows when to be still and know that he's God. &gt;&gt; And she knows when to move. You see, we need to be willing to move when God moves. When when the children of Israel were in the wilderness and that pillar of fire got up and and or the pillar of cloud, whatever, and started moving, they couldn't say, "Well, we just camped here last week." You mean we got to pack up the temple and pack up our tents and pack up this and pack up that and go? Yes, we got to move. But when they stayed there for week after week after week, why aren't we moving? There's no food here. There's no water here. We But the pillar of fire is still here. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So, amen. We need to move when he moves. We need to be still when he's still. &gt;&gt; It's being spiritled, calling from both sides. Friends, you know, I I hear these things like we ought to be preaching the mysteries. We ought to be preaching the deep things of God. Oh, you need to. But then there's then there's the other side. Just stay simple, brother. Just be a real good Christian. Both are right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is the reason why sometimes we get uncomfortable because we fall on either side naturally &gt;&gt; because of our makeup. &gt;&gt; But it we call from both sides. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Lord Jesus this morning. You know what I find friends? The one who's real deep and myster and knows the mysterious things of God often they can't get along with anybody. They're so arrogant. Nobody wants to be around them. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Whoa. Thank you, Lord. Oh, they're so deep, but their family's messed up. &gt;&gt; They're so heavenly minded norly good. But then there's the other side. Oh, good, clean Christians live good, clean lives, but they're satisfied. &gt;&gt; They're satisfied. Don't want to go no deeper, don't want to get further into the word. &gt;&gt; If you could get the two together, &gt;&gt; then you'd have something. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You want to know, friends, what really shows who has a real revelation when it translates into their life, &gt;&gt; into their conduct, into their conversation, how they treat their wife, &gt;&gt; how they treat their kids, how they treat the pastor, &gt;&gt; how they treat their brother from the other church. &gt;&gt; Yes. it. Friends, it's about living the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not just about talking about it, &gt;&gt; oh yeah. Oh, I got this quote. I I Let me show you. &gt;&gt; We've heard it many times, friends. The word, the message was not given to argue over or to debate. It was given to live, &gt;&gt; to manifest. &gt;&gt; I hope this is all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh friends, many people can explain and that that's why I believe Paul would write to the Corinthians, though I could have all faith. Oh, understand all mysteries. Oh, have faith and I could move mountains. If you don't have love, I'm talking about charity. Agape love, you're nothing. It's just like tinkling on and that's it. Oh, give us charity. &gt;&gt; Real revelation, friends. Do you realize that the the scripture says charity vaunteth not itself and is not puffed up? Hallelujah. Real revelation. You realize friends when we get to that maturity in our experience. Amen. When we're like a wheat plant, friends, and it just get that corn of wheat is just getting really ripe and tender and mature, it starts to bow its head. &gt;&gt; So when someone claims, "Oh, I got this revelation. I just know this and I can explain this." And they're just all puffed up. Well, maybe. But friends, a real revelation friends, they that that that revelation will just go so deep and you just help because what we realize, friends, is that I never gave myself that revelation. &gt;&gt; I'm only here by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; You're here only by the grace of God. Friends, there are so many people around here, other churches around there, friends. If not for the grace of God, &gt;&gt; we would not be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Turn with me to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5. We'll go into here a couple examples. 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 16 says, "Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Quench not the spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things. Hold fast that which is good. Now, I think it's so beautiful how Paul writes this. Watch this. In verse 20, he says, "Despise, not prophesyings." In other words, don't don't brush off the gifts. Don't dismiss them. Don't criticize them. Right? Don't pass it off as fanaticism. But then the next verse, prove all things. &gt;&gt; I love this. The middle of the road, don't don't prophesyings, tongues, interpretations. Don't despise that. &gt;&gt; Still in the body, &gt;&gt; still in the church. &gt;&gt; But on the other side, prove all things. &gt;&gt; Let's look at this, friends. Don't just accept everything blindly. &gt;&gt; Prove it. &gt;&gt; Test it out. &gt;&gt; How? By the word. &gt;&gt; Let's look at experiences here just for a moment. And and and bring it to our thought of the way of holiness. Because there's a middle of the road even with experiences. And I I say this because if we'll be honest, friends, we put a lot of weight on experiences. We put a lot of credibility on experiences. Now, let me say this before I go on here. I believe in experiences. I believe in experience. And friends, Amen. I believe in the experience. &gt;&gt; Right? The prophet of God would say the new birth is an experience. Each and every one of you must have that experience that personal experience with God himself. So I believe in experiences friends and and and but let's look at this you know let's look at even the first prophet messenger. Amen. Paul when he would on the road to Damascus now Paul was a student of the word and but he was off right he was persecuting the body. He was persecuting Jesus who was in the body. Amen. And there he goes to Damascus to arrest and to put in jail all these heretics in his mind. And God meets him on the road to Damascus in a pillar of fire, right? A great light surrounds him, strikes him off that horse. Amen. He says, "Oh Lord, Lord, who are you?" He says, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest." It's hard for you to kick against the pricks. Right? And then he says, "Lord, what must I do?" Now watch this. Amen. He a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a just amazing experience. I don't know if any of have you've had that kind of experience, but I I haven't where where I met the pillar of fire. I've met the pillar of fire, just not visibly maybe. Amen. But watch this. But look at Paul. He did not go immediately to the apostles. Amen. And go, "Oh, let me tell you what happened to me. I'm at the pillar of fire. Jesus came and visited me. Now you got to listen to me. &gt;&gt; Look at how spiritual I am. No, &gt;&gt; that's not what he did. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What did he do? Neither went I to Jerusalem to them which were apostle before me, but I went into Arabia and returned again to Damascus. Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem. So three years Paul, Amen, searches the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was he doing friends? He was matching. He was trying to test prove his experience. &gt;&gt; It would do us good if we did that. &gt;&gt; He he he took the he to he went through the scriptures. He went through the Old Testament and and proved his experience out by the word. And I can imagine as he read about the account of the children of Israel and the pillar of fire leading the children of Israel, the pillar of fire meeting Moses in the burning bush, the pillar of fire, amen, that met Abraham. All these things he began to realize it meant that my experience matches &gt;&gt; the word. &gt;&gt; Who I met &gt;&gt; was God. &gt;&gt; It was not Amen. He he compared it to the word. And brother Brown would say now Paul he just loved the word. So before he would ever witness this great experience that he had he went down in Egypt for three years. I believe it was three years. Three years down in Egypt. We know it was Arabia. Amen. And you know what I believe he done? I believe he took the Old Testament and searched through the Old Testament and found that that was really the absolute Messiah. He had to prove his experience by the Bible. &gt;&gt; And he did. &gt;&gt; He did. Amen. Notice Paul in his road down as soon as this great experience happened to him. Now, he wasn't satisfied. That's what makes Paul so good. Now, my friends, some of us would just, oh my, oh, we just had this great experience. I'm just going to tell the world and oh and and and that proves what what I'm saying is right. That's usually how people use experiences to vindicate themselves. God uses it to vindicate his word. &gt;&gt; It's not to vindicate the individual, friends. Amen. I believe in vindications, friends, but it but ought to match the word. &gt;&gt; It has to dovetail with the word. &gt;&gt; And before he would do this, Paul was a Bible scholar. Now listen, and a Bible scholar will never rest his doctrine upon experiences. I think this is so profound because people will say, "I seen a light. I've seen a vision. I had a dream." Oh, I'm not minimizing that. I'm not discrediting that one bit. But here, the prophet says, "You can never rest your doctrine on an experience. &gt;&gt; It's got to be in the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. A Bible scholar will never rest his doctrine upon experiences. No sir, they'll never rest their doctrine upon experience. You can have any kind of an experience, but it must be thus sayaeth the Lord. Right? And what's thus sayeth the Lord? It's nothing but the word of God. &gt;&gt; You've got to find it in here. You see, when Martin, right, when the when when the church age messenger Martin Satan came to him disguised as Jesus, &gt;&gt; right? And we know that the Bible says that Satan can transform himself into an angel of light. &gt;&gt; He can even disguise himself as a message preacher. &gt;&gt; That's why you need to prove what I'm actually preaching to you this morning &gt;&gt; by the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. But he Martin. So Satan comes to Martin as Jesus and he says, "Martin, don't you recognize me? &gt;&gt; Worship me. But Martin, right? What an experience. Jesus. Oh, can you imagine? It's G Jesus would visit me that I could actually see him. Oh, and if you're not careful, &gt;&gt; see, but Martin, there was something that see the Holy Ghost cannot be fooled. &gt;&gt; That's the thing, friends. The Holy Ghost, Amen, could not and there was something a little bit uncertain there. And Martin began to I I can imagine he began to search the scriptures. Amen. But there, Satan was Amen. disguised as Jesus wearing a crown, &gt;&gt; right? Golden slippers. &gt;&gt; Wow. Could start a new doctrine on that. Amen. But he had a crown. Golden slippers. And Martin began to realize that Christ was not crowned yet. &gt;&gt; He'd only be crowned by his people at his coming. And there's no scripture for golden slippers. &gt;&gt; So he realized, friends, Amen. He he realized who that was. And he said, "Satan, get behind me." See, he took his experience back to the word. &gt;&gt; Oh my. It's a lesson for us, friends. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Friends, you know, when when brother Brandon was on the scene, you know, there was all sorts of manifestations and all sorts of, you know, experiences and oh, blood coming out of people's hands, mine, oil, and all, you know, he said that that's there's no scripture for blood coming out of the hands. What about the blood of Jesus? &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe in anointing with oil, right? But oil come and it wasn't it wasn't scriptural. But watch this. He says, "Look at him when he was in prison." He's speaking about Paul again. You notice there's a space of Paul's life when he was in prison there for a long time. He wrote the book of Ephesians. He wrote this Hebrew letter. See, he had time. God laid him away over there in a prison. And he wrote these letters to the churches. One to the church of Ephesus. He wrote one to the Pentecostal church. Had lots of trouble with them. Amen. How many you know which church that was? That was the Corinthian church, right? Why? Because what was going on? Every some everyone had a psalm. Everyone had a had had a revelation. Everyone had this. Everyone had that, an interpretation. But you know what? Who was getting edified? The individual, &gt;&gt; right? I got this and I got that. And and and I just Oh, I hope you I just hope you hear what the Holy Spirit's saying. It's not that I'm against these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a middle of the road. Amen. The Pentecostal church he had more trouble with than anybody else. Still has it. But he was thankful for them. The only thing he could teach them when they come in, one had a tongue, one had a psalm, one had a sensation, one had a feeling. He couldn't talk or speak to them eternal security. He couldn't speak to them about predestination. He couldn't talk to them. They were babies. They all had to feel something &gt;&gt; or see something or have funny feelings or something around some evidences. There's nothing wrong with those. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And and and I I'll be the first one to tell I love feeling the presence of God. I love to feel his anointing. &gt;&gt; Don't you? &gt;&gt; Let me say this, friends. If I never felt him again, I'd still believe his word is true. You got to come to that place, friends, cuz friends, there's going to come a time where you will not feel him. &gt;&gt; Like brother Brandon would say, he's I feel like an orphan. He hasn't spoken to me. If you talk to him, would you tell him that I love him still? Something like that. You see, did it doesn't make him any less of a son of God. It doesn't make you any less of a child of child of God if you haven't felt him. &gt;&gt; His word His word says I'll never leave you nor for his word says I'll be with you even in you to them. That's his word. That's his promise. Standing on the promises of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many standing on the promises of God, friends? And it don't matter what you feel. It don't matter what your senses are telling you this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your memory, your conscience, your affection, your feelings, your sight. You realize, friends, that when the two went to the Emmas, they were they were talking to Jesus. They were seeing Jesus, but they couldn't see him. You see, their their senses, their earthly senses were connecting with Jesus, but they couldn't see him. But once their spiritual eyes were open, friends, the physical departed, vanished. But they went back to Jerusalem rejoicing nonetheless. But if we just depended on our feelings, he's gone. He's gone again. He abandoned us again. No, they said, "He's risen. He is risen." &gt;&gt; It was real to them. Amen. &gt;&gt; We cannot depend upon our senses, friends. These senses will will lie to us. &gt;&gt; We need to look to the unseen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's not be babies and depend on feelings and sensations. And again, I love to feel them. I love to feel them, friends. Amen. But let us not depend on that. It shows immaturity. &gt;&gt; You see, I give this example. You know, when our children were growing up, when your children were young, you have to tell them, "I love you. I love you. You're my son. You're my daughter. You're pretty. You're the best. I'm proud of you. I love you. I love you. I love you." Right? But there has to come a time, friends, when they come to a place in their life, amen, when they're at school or whatever, and someone says, "You ain't worth nothing." That they can say, "It doesn't matter what you said. &gt;&gt; I know. I know myself. I'm loved. &gt;&gt; I have value. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they know who they are. &gt;&gt; And that's what happens in our life, friends. It don't matter what any demon says. You see, if someone talked you into this, if someone just persuaded you that you're a son of God, but it's not really real to you. Someone will persuade you out of it. The devil. You say, "Look at this mistake. Look at this. Look at what you did here. And look at what you did there. Look what you But friends, if we can look past that, it's not what the devil says, not what my flesh says. It's what the word says. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's what I'm standing on this morning. What an appropriate song. That's what I'm standing on this morning is his word, his promise. &gt;&gt; It is yay and amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Hallelujah. Friends, it's the same thing spiritually. Amen. I don't have to see a vision to prove that I'm a son of God. Is this okay? I don't have to raise the dead to say I'm a minister. I'm called of God. &gt;&gt; I am who I am by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; That's it. Hallelujah. But let me say this. These signs shall follow them that believe. I don't have to manufacture it, friends. They'll just follow. When I look back, I see God worked here. He worked there. He answered this prayer. He answered that prayer. He did this in my life. He did this in my family. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't have to manufacture nothing, friends, or try to vindicate ourselves. God will vindicate. And I I we Shar and I were talking a little bit about this here yesterday. You know what, friends? The greatest vindication, we can say anything. Anybody can say it. I'm bride. I'm bride. I'm this. I'm that. The greatest vindication will be on rapture day. &gt;&gt; So you make sure that you know yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what we say, friends. What does God say? And he will say on rapture day, you're mine. I'm rapturing you. I'm changing your body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he gave us the down payment. &gt;&gt; Our healing. You're mom. Hallelujah. Johnny Huckluck. Our healing. Amen. He the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I believe when he spoke to the Ephesians, I'm just continuing on this. He could speak on God has predestinated us unto sons and daughters and adopted us as children in Christ Jesus before the foundation of the world. Look at that. I watch him come over in the book of Romans and so forth. They were grown up. So he's making kind of a comparison here. He could speak to the Romans about deeper things about predestination. If he the Ephesus church about these things they were grown up. So oh then we might assume oh then they were just mature quiet. No they have the gifts too. &gt;&gt; They sure did. Oh they spoke with tongues. Sure. And they had other signs of the Holy Spirit among them. But they didn't make doctrines and sensations and little quivers and funny feelings. Paul said, "You go to extremes with that." Amen. When you ought to be teaching your still babies and have to have milk. Now, that's what I've always tried to contend this tabernacle to be. Not a bunch of babies. Let's be grown up, &gt;&gt; friends. We've been in this message for enough years. We ought to be grown up. &gt;&gt; We ought to have some maturity about us. &gt;&gt; Yes. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, they speak with tongue. Sure. And they had other signs of the spirit. Amen. Watch this. Stand on the road. Oh my. There you are. So Paul goes down there first to see if his experience matched God's Bible. Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful today if people only done that again? If we made our experience match God's Bible, if it doesn't, then your experience is wrong. &gt;&gt; But it was so spiritual. It was It seemed so genuine. If it doesn't match with the word, it's wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. If it don't flash in the ur thumb. &gt;&gt; We don't have a physical breastplate now, but we got one. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's If it doesn't flash across this, friends, it's wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. Know you got it. But if it doesn't, I don't care how good it seems, how real it looked like it was right. If those lights didn't flash on that urine thumb, it was wrong. And no matter how much experience you've had, how real it seems to be, how presenting it is, how educational is, what a great tool it is to win souls, if it doesn't flash in the word, it's wrong. &gt;&gt; Right? It must line up with the word. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Friends, you know, when they they I don't know if they do it anymore, but in courts they used to do, right? When you come for testimony, place your hand on the Bible &gt;&gt; and and pledge, make a solemn oath. I promise to tell the truth, the only truth. Nothing but the truth. Let me say it this way. The word. Nothing but the word. [Music] &gt;&gt; The whole word. &gt;&gt; The word. The whole word and nothing but the word. That's what we go by, friends. Not the word plus what I think or the word minus this part that I don't really like cuz it doesn't match up with my life or my my way of thinking or my understanding. No, it's the word, the whole word and nothing but the word. No man's ideas, no denominational feelings and all these things, friends. Hallelujah. Brother Brown tells this story around this this this thought here of experiences because you know he met this minister that come from overseas I believe and and he'd come to this meeting but he had driven a long ways from another place in America I believe but he he traveled by himself with another woman who wasn't his wife. &gt;&gt; Okay. Right. And this woman and and on top of that she had been married four or five times. Right. And brother Brando of course it it just wasn't a good testimony. So he got that minister apart and he said, "Brother, don't you think it's, you know, not right to be doing what you're doing? You you you should be a better example than that." And that minister says, "Oh, but she's a saint." What does that matter, right? If she's a saint or ain't. Amen. The Bible says, "Amen. Shun the appearance of evil." &gt;&gt; And so, you know, he said, he said, "You don't teach your church that, do you?" He said, "Oh, no, but you know, I had a vision, Brother Brandham." Oh. Oh, then it's all right. Watch this. He said, "You, you know, cuz it didn't it didn't really impress Brother Brown." And the minister said, "You know, actually, if you have a little bit of time, I'd like to straighten you up on your doctrine a little bit." He said, "Please do." He said, "Now, when I had this vision, I was sleeping." And brother Brown right away, he said, "There I knew was a dream." &gt;&gt; Because you don't have a vision when you're sleeping, &gt;&gt; right? You have when you're sleep, you have a dream when you're sleeping. when you're awake and you see that that's a vision, &gt;&gt; right? And and let me just slow down here. How many know Amen and I'm not against dreams. God uses dreams. He used dreams. He came to Jacob in a dream. He So Joseph dreams. He he does dreams. Amen. The Bible says uh your young men &gt;&gt; shall see visions. Your old man shall dream dreams like that. Right? So I believe in dreams, but you realize brother Brand would even say it's a secondary way, &gt;&gt; right? Unless there's a prophet or an interpreter to interpret the dream. You see, Joseph had dreams. Pharaoh had dreams. But Joseph was also a prophet. &gt;&gt; He could interpret the dreams, right? Amen. So there, if it's if there's no interpreter, it might be right, it might be wrong. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how spiritual it is. I shared this with the church back home. You know, as a kid, I had a dream. There was a couple in the church. They separated. I'm not saying any names, but as a kid, I don't I don't even remember how old I was. I had a dream that they were back together again. And I told my dad, you know what he said? He said, "Well, wait and see." It was wise. &gt;&gt; To this day, they're still not together. So, it was a dream. &gt;&gt; It was a nice dream, but it was just a dream. &gt;&gt; See, we need to test our experiences by the word. &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what did that minister? Let's go back to see what he says. He he says my wife said this is in his vision or dream. He says my wife she had been living with another man so unfaithful to him and and running around on me and said then she come to me and she said to me oh darling forgive me forgive me. Said I'm sorry I did. I'll be true from now on. Said of course I loved her so much. I just forgive her. Said all right. And then said do you know what? Then I got the interpretation of this vision. said that was the woman. So he's equating his dream of his wife being unfaithful to him and it being all right to this woman now it's all right. Watch this said sure she's been married and so for all these times it's all right for her to marry because the Lord loved her so much she can marry as many times as she wants as far I said your vision was mighty sweet but it was way off it was way off the beaten path. I said it's wrong. &gt;&gt; It was mighty sweet, but it was from the devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's mighty strong. Well, where did it come from? Didn't come from God. &gt;&gt; So, it came from the devil. &gt;&gt; It friends, it don't matter how spiritual it seems. If it's against the word, &gt;&gt; it's from the devil. &gt;&gt; I shared this other story. you know, I I I I sit with on the school and we were we just been um hiring a new a new principal for our school and this candidate was having an interview with us and one of the questions and actually actually there was a couple candidates there a at first and one was a woman and we were talking about this candidate and one of the board members was saying you know I kind of am uncomfortable with where this woman is coming from because her church it's the woman pastor it's the woman this it's the woman that and I kind of have a trouble with women in leadership in the church. And there became a kind of a thing here, right? Cuz some on the board even they were four women preachers. They were four women pastors and there were three of us that weren't that way, right? And one of them that his wife actually is a pastor. So you know where he stands. But he said our senior pastor, he used to see that way. He used to see that women shouldn't be in leadership in the church. He used to but he prayed about it. He studied it for months and months. And you know what? He came out on the other side. I didn't say anything. And I thought, "What does that matter? His mind might have changed. &gt;&gt; His understanding might have changed, but God's word never changed. &gt;&gt; It didn't change. &gt;&gt; It's still the word. It's still the truth, friends. I don't care if that if that if that pastor had a vision that that woman was at his pulpit, it was still wrong." &gt;&gt; And you know, and oh, let let me get off that. Let me let me go on to something here, right? Let me go to another example because we're we just want to keep going here. How many remember when Ahab, right? Amen. was wanting to go and get Ramoth Gilead. You all know the story, right? Amen. But Jehoshaphat, Amen, being a man of God said, "Shouldn't we inquire of the Lord first?" Oh, yeah, sure. Why didn't I think of that? Actually, we have 400 prophets. &gt;&gt; Oh, you do? Hey, okay, they come. And oh, what do they prophesy? Go on up. Go on up and prosper, Ahab. The Lord is given to you. And Zedekiah even was anointed, had a vision, Brother Brandham said, to make these horns of iron. And he said, "Thus saith the Lord, &gt;&gt; the Lord spoke to me and told me to make these these horns of iron and that you will push the Syrians out." Oh, hallelujah. Yeah. Amen, Zedekiah. Woo. Praise be to God. Oh, they were in one accord. And now I'm not I'm not I'm not mocking that. I'm just just stay with me. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Let me read it the way. Oh my. Because friends, they they were they were they were in one accord. &gt;&gt; Oh, one mind. &gt;&gt; They were shouting. They were having a good old quote unquote Pentecostal meeting. I believe in Pentecost. But oh, they were getting excited. Oh, yeah. That's right. That's right. Oh, they were anointed. The trouble is they were anointed by the wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; They thought it was the Holy Spirit, but it was actually a lying spirit. and they come up, you know, and Jehoshaphat, see, he was a man of God. And there was something in him just didn't sound right. &gt;&gt; My That's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Trust your Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Trust, okay? Because sometimes, oh, I I hope I don't get caught into false doctrine. I just hope I don't get deceived by because some people say, I I can't sit under a man because, you know, I I just they might lead me wrong. &gt;&gt; Lead your Holy Ghost wrong. No, &gt;&gt; we're not trusting upon our intellect. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can come to service and open up our heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost, Amen, will guide you. &gt;&gt; The trusting your Holy Ghost. Don't trust in your intellect. Don't trust, oh my understanding. Because what will happen? You lean to your own understanding and you start to reject the word. &gt;&gt; Trust in your Holy Ghost. He cannot fail. He cannot be deceived. The elect cannot be deceived. It doesn't mean that we just gobble up everything. We prove all things. You see, there's a middle of the road. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you're I hope you're catching it this morning. Hallelujah. Watch this. Cuz Micaiah comes up, right? And Ahab says, "What do you say? Go on up. Go up and prosper, Ahab." There must have been something in his tone that Ahab said, "Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Haven't I always told you to tell me the truth? Okay, you really want to know the truth? &gt;&gt; He said, "Hear there now, therefore the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting on his throne and all the hosts of heaven standing by him in his right hand and his left." And the Lord said, "Who shall persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall at Rama Gilead?" And one said, "On this man, another on this manner." And there came a spirit, a demon from hell, &gt;&gt; and stood before the Lord and said, "I will persuade him." And the Lord said unto him, "Wherewith?" And he said, "I will go forth and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets." And he said, "Thou will persuade him. &gt;&gt; You will do it and prevail. Go forth and do so." Now therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets. &gt;&gt; Anointed, &gt;&gt; saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you another story? I just kid. I had it said to me, you know, by by a brother that follows a different doctrine of the message. You know what proves that we're right? We're all saying the same thing. Everywhere else in the message, there's division people and and people saying different things, but we say the same thing. I said, cuz you're all listening to one another. &gt;&gt; You're all streaming one another's services. That's why. &gt;&gt; But even if they were saying all the same thing, Ahab's prophets were saying the same thing. If it doesn't match up with the word, &gt;&gt; it's wrong. &gt;&gt; That's what the Catholic Church says. We're We never changed. Are you serious? &gt;&gt; We're the original. Well, the original Catholic Church, I'm original. &gt;&gt; You're original, friends. As long as it's in the word, Amen. Like brother said, as long as Calvin was in the Bible, I'm a Calvinist. As long as Armenianism is in the Bible, I'm an Armenian, right? Amen. And so friends, whatever you want to call yourself, if you want to call me a Baptist, Pentecostal, Presbyterian, Catholic, as long as in the word, you can call me whatever you want. I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But watch this. Amen. Oh, the lying spirit. God, Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets, and the Lord has spoken evil concerning thee. Oh, the atmosphere went, [Laughter] oh my, there there was a hush. And it wasn't a holy hush, but can you imagine? Well, these fellows said, now I'm just quoting. True sign is overlooked. They said, but we saw a vision. Those 400 prophets, we know we are prophets. We know for we are prophets. Mia said, I don't doubt but what you saw a vision. I don't doubt it a bit what you saw a vision, but it ain't according to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Said, I saw I saw a vision, too. Amen. Oh, mercy. He was a sign. He was a sign. He said, "I saw a vision and I saw Israel like sheep scattered on a hill having no shepherd." So both sides were anointed. Both sides had visions. How do you discern between the true and false? Compare it to the word. &gt;&gt; Micaiah when there was 400 well-dressed prophets standing there saying to Ahab and say, "Go up. The Lord is with you." Micaiah said, "Go on up if you want to." But the Lord told me, "I see an Israel scattered like sheep on a hill." Why? when 400 prophets prophesying contrary to what he was, how could he be so sure? Can you imagine, friends? Amen. If we we have the benefit of looking back. &gt;&gt; But if you were in the congregation that day and everyone in the message was saying one way, other ministers on this side &gt;&gt; and said something different. &gt;&gt; It'd be easier to follow the group. &gt;&gt; The word, &gt;&gt; the whole word, &gt;&gt; and nothing but the word. &gt;&gt; Let his word be true. Let every other man's word be a lie, but his word be the truth. Let's hold on to the word. &gt;&gt; Hold to the word. &gt;&gt; Don't hold to your own idea or somebody's idea because what what let oh what happens friends is people Amen. They won't believe it unless it come from their favorite preacher. &gt;&gt; Oh, but if so and so said it, okay, it's good. &gt;&gt; My pastor said it all these years, but I never accepted it until my favorite preacher said it. &gt;&gt; Now you're right, brother Zigg. Now you're right, brother Moses. Come on, friends. We ought to be more mature than that. &gt;&gt; Cuz what what? Look, watch this. Micaiah. Oh, going up. Why? When 400 prophets were prophesying contrary to what he was, how could he be so sure? because his vision compared with the word of God. That's the reason he know it. Oh, how I wish I had about an hour now to preach right here. If your vision don't compare with the word, forget about your vision. &gt;&gt; What was the word of the Lord? Well, there was a vindicated prophet that had gone before him, Elijah, that had said that was the word that you were to compare your vision to. And the word was thus saith the Lord in the place where the dog lick the the blood of Nabal shall lick shall the dogs lick thy blood. That was the prophecy. That was the word through a vindicated prophet. Friends, amen. And anointed ones at end time. Brother says there was one of them by the name of Micaiah who was anointed with God and sent by God with the word of God. There was one Zedekiah who thought he was sent by God. He was anointed of God but his teaching his teaching &gt;&gt; his teaching was contrary to the word of God. And how many know friends brother Brown was go on to say in that message the teaching is actually the fruit because everybody can produce fruits of the spirit. The denominations often produce more fruits of the spirit than we do. Love, gentleness, meekness. But friends, he would break it down and say, "The fruit is the teaching. The food induces the teaching is the fruit of the season." Go look it up. Amen. But watch this. Even though Zedekiah said, "The Lord spoke to me. The Holy Spirit is anointing me." It sounded so good. But it was a line spirit. &gt;&gt; Look, the man was sincere. Anointed ones at the end time. He said, "Make these horns and go up there before the king and push westward. or whichever way the land laid from where they were standing push and that'll be thus sayaeth the Lord he's going to win the victory and come back a victory for the church going to drive them out that's pretty close isn't it what was the matter here come Micaiah down said now you give your prophecy going up but I see in Israel like sheep scattered having no shepherd exactly vice versa now you're the congregation which one is right &gt;&gt; we have the hindsight but put yourself there which is right both Both of them prophets. The only way you can tell the difference in them is check it by the word. &gt;&gt; Glory. Oh, let me go on. &gt;&gt; Despise not prophesyings. Despise not these things, the gifts, all these things, but prove them. Prove all things. Amen. Let me say this. I want every gift that God will give me. I want every sensation, every feeling that God will allow me to have. every revelation, &gt;&gt; but let it be according to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that I believe that's your desire as well. &gt;&gt; Let's look at one more example before we close here. We're speaking about the middle of the road, the way of holiness. Let's look at it in applying the token. Now, you say that's it's so simple. Now, watch this because you all know this quote. I'm going to read it to you. It's from the token because we know how the prophet taught us to apply the token. kick the trash out, clean house. &gt;&gt; Right? How many know the quote I'm referring to? We're going to read it here. But I dare say, friends, brothers, take that and demolish their family with it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they're not walking in the way of holiness. You say, "What are you talking about?" Because they're saying, "But I'm I'm following the word. I'm just doing what Brother Brandham said." Let's read it. There's two sides &gt;&gt; on the extreme. There's one side, oh, they're just we're getting rid of the trash in our and they don't take no consideration for the stage that their kids are in. &gt;&gt; They don't take into consideration their wife. &gt;&gt; Can I go on? &gt;&gt; But then the other side doesn't do nothing. And they just expect because we're in the message, it'll be all right. They're both wrong. Watch this. How did the prophet teach us to apply the token? Believe the Lord Jesus Christ for your house. Apply the token to your house. Then what do you do when you apply to your house? Move all the trash out. Get all the short skirts and the shorts and the cards and the cigarettes and the televisions, whatever more and kick them out the door. &gt;&gt; When you go apply the token, won't stand still for it. Yes, sir. Take it all out. All the dances and parties and rock and roll and old vulgar newspapers and the stuff that's out the world. Kick it out the door and say, "We're cleaning out this place around here." here. I know the B and the brothers slammed their token message and said, "I'm going to do that right now. We're cleaning house." They forgot to read the rest of the quote. Oh, it got real quiet cuz most of us stopped reading there. We're kicking the T. And that's right. We're getting that video game and then we went to turn the trash. Watch this. Like Jacob did because Amen. Let me just go on. Told his wife said, "Wash your clothes and everything. Put away them gods." You know what Joshua said before crossing over? He said, "Wash your clothes. Come not at your wives and so forth. Get ready for within 3 days we're going to cross Jordan." Amen. He was getting ready applying the token. Amen. That's it. Get ready. Apply it. Believe it. Clean up. So we say, "Amen, brother Brown. We're going to clean up. We're applying the token." Now, before I keep going, I believe in holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that our children ought to know what's right and wrong. &gt;&gt; They need to know what the standard is. &gt;&gt; So keep that in mind. I believe in that. But there's a middle of the road. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a balance and the prophet gave us the balance. Now this is exactly the same quote. Let So apply the to kick the trash out. Get all the shorts and the all this and out of it. Television out. Get it out. Let your children, let your family, let your loved ones see it in you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because you know what happened? Brothers went and kicked all the trash out and kept the trash in them. &gt;&gt; Well, I I can do this cuz I'm I'm mature enough. And their kids see that. &gt;&gt; It doesn't jive. &gt;&gt; Don't talk again. Don't Don't bug your Don't Don't bully. And they bully the pastor. They bully their brother. This is how we apply the token. Let your children, let your family, let your loved ones see it in you. &gt;&gt; The applier &gt;&gt; see it in you. &gt;&gt; Uh-oh. Just like brothers took Ephesians 5:22. Why submit yourself? Did you hear what the prophet said? Did you hear what the scripture says? You submit yourself. And forgot the second part. Brother Ram said, "You live a life before them that they can submit to. There is two sides, but there's a middle of the road. And the redeemed will walk in it. &gt;&gt; It's a way of holiness. Let your children, let your family, let your loved ones see it in you." That's right. It'll take effect. Yes, sir. Then apply the token in prayer. &gt;&gt; My, we forgot all this. with consideration, with believing. Apply it with such love. &gt;&gt; It's the way of holiness. There's a way to apply the token. Apply it with such love and so forth till you know it's going to take it's going to take place. That's all. Apply it in confidence believing it's going to help. When you talk to that child, oh, we're just getting rid of your junk. Did you talk to the child? Cuz guaranteed the child. Why, Dad? Why? Don't bother with that. I just told you so. &gt;&gt; Resentment, bitterness in people I talked to that were in the message right now. &gt;&gt; And their parents did what they thought best, &gt;&gt; there's a middle of the road. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Watch this. I'm not done. When you talk to your husband, talk to your wife, talk to this loved one, believe that it's going to help. Just stand there and say, "Lord, I've claimed them. They're mine. I'm getting them for you, Lord." Apply it. What token? And create that atmosphere around you. &gt;&gt; Oh, and we applied it in the past. Maybe &gt;&gt; we create an atmosphere. All right. &gt;&gt; Of anger &gt;&gt; and bitterness and turmoil and strife. &gt;&gt; Create that atmosphere around you. The applier. Watch that. They'll just drop right into it. This is rich. &gt;&gt; See? Oh, you are. If you got the token. See, there's another problem. Some people try to apply it and they don't have the token themselves. &gt;&gt; It won't work. You got to have the token and then you apply it. If you got the token, you create a spirit around you. This is all one quote. I'm not cutting pasting. A power that when you walk, people know that you're a Christian. They love for you to say something to them, including your kids. They love for you to say something to them. They believe your word. What you say, they hold on to it. You see, that's it. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; There's more there's more to the way of holiness than just dos and don'ts, &gt;&gt; than just a code of conduct and just a code of ethics. No, there there there's Holy Ghost leadership. Them that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God. They will apply the token. They will get rid of the trash the way God shows them how to do it. And there'll be such a life in them that their family drops into it. My no wonder the scripture talks about you know that our conversation be a certain way that the e the the wicked be ashamed right we live such a life you know those that are in the workplace you live such a life that you don't have to say a thing sometimes and they just know they say a swear word oh I'm sorry I'm sorry brother Moses I I didn't mean to say that did you tell oh I'm the pastor restored word and you need to be saved you need to repent I've heard brothers oh my it's just I wouldn't do it that way per se maybe If the Lord leads you to do it that way, do it that way. Amen. But Amen. We our lives, the atmosphere, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; that is around us. &gt;&gt; Amen. It it speaks to people. You know, we I'm sure you've had people come into your congregation. You might not they hear the word. Amen. You know what? They might have not even got a thing out of the preaching, but they notice, my your women sure are modest. And the atmosphere, you know, we had we have a young brother that's been coming to our church, 19 years old. You know, he said everyone has a twinkle in their eye. &gt;&gt; Did he hear all the He's been questioning about the about the message and the prophet and things, but he noticed first the people, &gt;&gt; the atmosphere, the spirit that is amongst the people. That's what ought to speak to people. Friends, let's close, friends. Let God let God keep us in the straight and narrow on the way the way of holiness. It's the middle of the road. Because friends, guarantee you, Satan is going to try to drag you to one side or the other. &gt;&gt; If he can't get keep you in the middle, he's going to try to push you over to this side, &gt;&gt; right? So far, right, that you can't even see the other side. You can't see the other side of the story. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're just so focused on this part of the word, we don't see the rest of the word. &gt;&gt; Keep us in the middle of the road, Lord, that I can pull from each side. Oh, the deep things of God. Oh, the deep, the mysterious, and the simple. &gt;&gt; The simple. Being a children, &gt;&gt; loving one another. &gt;&gt; Talking nice about one another. &gt;&gt; I don't have to do that. I understand the seals. No, &gt;&gt; keep us in the middle of the road. Lord, &gt;&gt; there is a highway and a way. It's called the way holiness. as as I as we stand here, musicians come, you know that story that Brother Brown tells about, you know, the the competition for the Schwin bike, right? There was a way, right? It was narrow across that plank. But you know what? All all the other all the other boys, they were looking they were looking at this church, looking at that person, criticizing this person, criticizing that sinner, and they fell off. &gt;&gt; But you know the boy who won, he said, "You know what the trouble was? You guys were looking here, looking there, looking down, afraid you would fall. Oh, the devil gets us there. Oh, I hope I don't fall. Oh, no. Keep your eyes on the prize. He kept his eyes on the prize and he went along the way and he got the prize, Lord. Keep us true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Father, we're so thankful to you this morning, Lord. Lord, you have a way. Keep us in the way, Lord Jesus. Lead us, Father. Lord, I just trust, Lord, if I said anything untoward, Lord, you forgive me, Lord. But I just pray, God, that Lord, you take these words and hide them in our hearts, Lord, that we might not sin against you, Lord. And keep us in the middle of the road, Lord, in everything that we do, Lord. Our lives, our spiritual lives, our church lives, Lord. Our family lives, Lord. That's what we want, Lord. We want balance in our lives, Lord. I know we all think we're balanced, Lord, but the only thing that balances us is your word, Lord. Lord, we love you. Father, bless this church. Lord, bless this assembly. God, bless brother Moses. Bless brother Zigg. Lord, bless all the elders, musicians, the leoty. Lord, the Sunday school teacher, Lord, the deacons, every single one, Lord, young, old, middle-aged, Lord, bless them, Father, we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. What you, brother? Let's let's sing that. For the Lord shall return, oh, and come with singing unto Zion. Oh, and everlasting joy shall be upon their head. And therefore the redeemed Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return and come and come with singing unto Zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their head. They shall obtain, oh they shall obtain gladness and joy. Gladness and joy and sorrow and sorrow and shall flee away. Therefore, king of the Lord shall return. Oh, and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their head. Can we go up? Therefore, the redeemed of the Lord shall return. Oh, and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their head there for the redeemed. That's you. Oh, and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their head. They shall obtain They shall obtain gladness. [Music] shall flee away. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; Unto Zion an everlasting joy will be upon their head. [Music] That was a masterpiece. Amen. &gt;&gt; That was indeed a masterpiece. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. It It could not be delivered way better than this. It was wonderful. God bless you, brother Gideon. We We were really fed and I was fed. It was it was um something that is in my heart and uh and uh and I even shared it last time on Sunday with my brother. He's also a minister, a pastor and uh just shared a little bit on that thought and it just struck my heart and I'm just going to open up a little bit myself uh this morning as the channel has been open a little bit. May God help us to become mature &gt;&gt; and myself included. May God help us to become mature and if we are not very careful. um we will be on one side without realizing it and and it's not like you are you are you are worldly or no you you're a Christian you're in a message and everything goes fine but you you end up in being in a corner and you just see the way you want to see things and if if anything is not the way you see it no that's not correct but and and if you're not careful that's God is not pleased but but we desire to become mature. Lord, make me more mature. Make me and I share that with pastor Zik one time as well. The most difficult thing in the in the message is to be balanced. It's it's it's becoming harder and harder because each minister has his own way and we have our favorite preacher sometimes because they just see the way I want to see and you have your own corner. But Lord help me to to be open. &gt;&gt; I like an evangelist. I like a teacher. I like an apostle. I like a pastor. &gt;&gt; Why we have why we we corner ourel in one corner? Lord help me to be balanced. &gt;&gt; You know sometimes how it shows that you are mature when you can accept sometimes we're still struggling and you're helping him.

Oh, all other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. When darkness seems to hide his face, I rest on his unchanging grace. In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil. On Christ the solid rock I stand. Oh, all other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. His oath is covenant and his blood. Support me in the welling flood. When all around my soul gives way, even then is all my hope and stay on Christ the soul of dust and all other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. when he shall come with trumpet sound. Oh, may I then in him be found dressed in his rightousness alone, faultless to stand before the throne. On Christ the solid rock I stand. Oh, all other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. &gt;&gt; My Christianity walk cannot be based on my own righteousness. It's based on Christ's righteousness, his holiness. That's the solid ground. Amen. God bless you. I dismissed and thank you for coming to the service this morning. God bless you.
