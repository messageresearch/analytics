[18:20] This world is not my home. I'm just a

[18:29] up somewhere beyond the blue. The angels

[18:41] can't feel at home in this world
[18:45] anymore.
[18:47] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[18:52] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,

[19:07] feel at home in this world anymore.
[19:13] They're all expecting me. And that's one

[19:23] many years ago.

[19:30] weak and bold and I can't feel at home
[19:34] in this world anymore.

[20:09] The saints on every hand are shouting
[20:13] victory.
[20:15] The songs of sweetest praise drift back
[20:19] from heaven shore. And I can't feel at
[20:23] home in this world anymore.
[20:28] Lord, you know I have no friend like
[20:32] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[20:38] what will I do? The angels beckon me
[20:43] from heaven's open. And I can't feel at
[20:48] home in this world anymore, Lord. Oh
[20:53] Lord, you know I have no friend like
[20:57] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[21:02] what will I do?

[47:43] [Music]
[47:45] God's attributes were manifested to his
[47:50] bride in this last day. We have caught
[47:53] the revelation by the last prophet's
[47:56] message. And we know who we are and what

[51:39] his name. We thank the Lord for his
[51:41] presence. Amen. And thank the Lord for
[51:44] the word of God. Amen. That we have
[51:46] received our time. Glory to his name.

[54:48] presence this morning. Lord, we welcome
[54:51] you and we thank you, Father, for being
[54:53] in the heart of each believer this
[54:55] morning. Father that we can be gathered
[54:57] around the revealed word of the hour.
[55:00] Father, this church is called restored
[55:02] word fellowship. We have fellowship
[55:04] around the restored word, Father, of the
[55:07] hour. So, it's good to be in the house
[55:09] of the Lord this morning despite the
[55:11] trials, despite the ups and downs,
[55:14] Father. But we are here for you. We are
[55:16] here to tell you we love you. We trust
[55:18] you. We trust in your promises. And
[55:21] Father, you never fail. You have never
[55:24] lost a battle. You have never lost a
[55:26] war, Father. Lord, so we are so thankful
[55:28] to be on the side of the redeemer. Lord,
[55:31] we give you the praise and the honor.
[55:33] May you touch it hard this morning,
[55:35] Lord. May you put the preacher aside.
[55:37] May the Holy Spirit have the preminence
[55:39] and speak to our heart, Father. Say one
[55:41] word that will make a difference,
[55:43] Father. One word from you will make a
[55:45] difference, Father. That's what we
[55:47] desire. Lord, a touch. We desire to
[55:49] touch you as you are here, Lord. As you
[55:51] are passing by, you are still the high
[55:53] priest. As we heard this morning through
[55:54] the tape, you are still the high priest
[55:56] who can be touched by the feeling of our
[55:58] infirmities. Lord, we love you and
[56:00] appreciate you. Bless each family here,
[56:02] Lord. We bless your name. We love you.
[56:05] Thank you for the specials. Thank you
[56:06] for the gift. Thank you for each and
[56:08] every one of us. Father, bless the
[56:10] musicians, Lord. Thank you for the
[56:12] musician you have given us. Bless them
[56:14] richly, the sacrifices they are making
[56:16] for you. Thank for the song leader,
[56:18] Lord. The sacrifices making for you.
[56:21] Bless them richly, Lord. As we depend on
[56:23] one another, we need one another and you
[56:25] have put those different gift. Bless the
[56:27] the the technicians, the sound, Lord, as
[56:30] they are behind there. Father, bless
[56:32] them richly, Lord. Bless, Father, the
[56:34] deacon, Lord. Oh God, bless him richly.
[56:37] Continue to anoint him, to use him,
[56:39] Father, as Lord is meeting to the
[56:40] material need or financial need or the
[56:43] needs of the church. Father, bless him
[56:44] and give him wisdom. Lord, we commit
[56:46] oursel to you, the whole church. Father,
[56:48] we surrender oursel to each family. Lord
[56:51] we commit ourselves to in the name of
[56:53] Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[56:58] [Music]
[57:01] I invite you to go to the word of God.
[57:05] [Music]
[57:22] Proverbs 3:17. So we are finishing this
[57:26] service and
[57:34] the end of the of the sermon that we are
[57:36] listening. Leaning lean not onto your
[57:39] own understanding. This scripture the
[57:40] prophet is reading. I was
[57:44] thinking just to comment a little bit on
[57:46] that sermon this morning.
[57:49] Thank God for what he's also doing for
[57:51] brother Luke Semin. We prayed for him on
[57:53] Wednesday and uh the surgery went fine.
[57:57] So he's recovering. So thank God that
[57:59] God is working on his behalf as well. So
[58:02] continue to keep in prayers. Amen.
[58:06] Don't forget the the service this
[58:08] Wednesday and also we also have service
[58:11] on Friday morning. So Friday morning we
[58:15] have a service uh on Good Friday. We
[58:18] always have a service on Good Friday
[58:19] here usually. So we like to keep that
[58:22] and we have a service on Friday morning.
[58:25] The brother
[58:27] brother Brent will be speaking. So come
[58:30] expecting expecting you to be here as
[58:33] well to be good if you each and every
[58:35] one of us is here. Most of the places
[58:37] it's a holiday it's morning. So if you
[58:40] can make an effort to come here it will
[58:41] be great right and um and then on Sunday
[58:46] morning they have a regular service.
[58:48] Amen. And then end time message also
[58:51] having some services might participate
[58:54] on Friday evening and Saturday evening.
[58:58] So um just it's it's a prophet called it
[59:02] one of the greatest weekend. I'm
[59:04] paraphrasing the Easter weekend. It's
[59:06] one of the greatest weekend. So good to
[59:08] spend as much time as possible in the
[59:11] presence of the Lord. Amen. He spoke
[59:14] more about his death than he spoke more
[59:16] about his birth. Sometimes we put too
[59:18] much on Christmas. But actually Easter
[59:21] is more much more more more important.
[59:24] Amen. because he died and when he rose
[59:26] from the dead all our sins are forgiven.
[59:29] Amen.
[59:31] Amen. So, Proverbs 3:17.
[59:43] You are there. I'm not there.
[59:46] Proverbs 3:17 says, "My son, forget not
[59:50] my law, but let thine heart keep my
[59:54] commandments for length of days and long
[59:57] life and peace shall they add to thee.
[1:00:01] Let not mercy and truth forsake thee.
[1:00:03] Bind them about thy neck. Write them
[1:00:07] upon the table of thine heart. So shalt
[1:00:10] thou find favor and good understanding
[1:00:12] in the sight of God and man. So you
[1:00:16] shall find good understanding in the
[1:00:17] sight of God and man. Trust in the Lord
[1:00:20] with all thine heart and lean not unto
[1:00:23] thine own understanding. That's why the
[1:00:26] prophet took the title says in all thy
[1:00:28] ways acknowledge him and he shall direct
[1:00:31] thy paths. Be not wise in thine own
[1:00:34] eyes. Fear the Lord and depart from
[1:00:38] evil. May God bless his word. You can
[1:00:40] have a seat.
[1:00:51] And I would like to read another
[1:00:53] scripture. Colossians
[1:00:55] 9:19.
[1:00:57] Colossians 1 9-19 say the Bible says for
[1:01:01] this cause we also since the day we
[1:01:04] heard it do not cease to pray for you
[1:01:07] and desire that you might be filled with
[1:01:09] the knowledge of his will in all wisdom
[1:01:13] and spiritual understanding. That's
[1:01:15] where I will take my my my title this
[1:01:18] morning. Like to talk about spiritual
[1:01:20] understanding that you might walk worthy
[1:01:23] of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
[1:01:26] fruitful in every good work. being
[1:01:29] fruitful in every good work and
[1:01:30] increasing in the knowledge of God.
[1:01:33] Strengthen with all might according to
[1:01:35] his glorious power unto all patience and
[1:01:39] longsuffering with joyfulness, giving
[1:01:41] thanks unto the Father which had made us
[1:01:44] meet to be partakers of the inheritance
[1:01:47] of the saints in light who had delivered
[1:01:50] us from the power of darkness. Last time
[1:01:53] we talked about the shalom to the bride
[1:01:56] but gross darkness upon the world but
[1:01:58] God has delivered us from the power of
[1:02:00] darkness. Says and I translated us into
[1:02:03] the kingdom of his dear son in whom we
[1:02:06] have redemption through his blood even
[1:02:09] the forgiveness of sins who is the image
[1:02:11] of the invisible God the firstborn of
[1:02:14] every creature. For by him were all
[1:02:16] things created that that are in heaven
[1:02:19] and that are in earth, visible and
[1:02:20] invisible, whether they be thrones and
[1:02:23] or dominions or principalities or
[1:02:25] powers. All things were created by him
[1:02:28] and for him. Created by the Lord Jesus
[1:02:31] Christ and for him. Amen. He's before
[1:02:34] all things and by him all things
[1:02:36] consist. He is the head of the body, the
[1:02:39] church. Amen. He's the one who the who's
[1:02:42] the great shepherd. Amen. is the one
[1:02:44] with the head of the body. He who is the
[1:02:46] beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[1:02:49] that in all things he might have the
[1:02:51] preeminence. For it pleases, please the
[1:02:54] father that in him should all fullness
[1:02:57] dwell. Amen. Then in Philippians 2:5,
[1:03:01] let a mind let this mind be in you which
[1:03:04] was also in Christ Jesus.
[1:03:08] Amen. So as I said would like to
[1:03:11] continue maybe to close on that service
[1:03:13] that prophet is speaking but just want
[1:03:15] to give a little bit of of of what uh
[1:03:18] bit of of thought that an inspiration I
[1:03:20] get out of that that message uh like to
[1:03:23] talk about spiritual understanding.
[1:03:26] So when the prophet says lean not unto
[1:03:29] your own understanding
[1:03:31] I don't think it means that you don't
[1:03:33] have to think. I don't think it means
[1:03:36] that you are not allowed to reason or to
[1:03:39] evaluate to judge with intelligence that
[1:03:42] a human being has. I think all of us we
[1:03:45] have a level of intelligence that God
[1:03:47] has given us as a gift to be to be able
[1:03:50] to evaluate things and to reason and to
[1:03:52] think and to to have a little bit of
[1:03:55] understanding human understanding.
[1:03:57] Certainly we do that every day in our
[1:03:59] usual life. Amen. And in a visual
[1:04:01] activities, you have to have a little
[1:04:03] bit of thinking, a little bit of
[1:04:04] understanding. Unfortunately, some
[1:04:06] people don't think anymore.
[1:04:09] For sure. They don't think anymore. They
[1:04:10] just just go. But we we we thank God
[1:04:13] that we still have a little bit of of
[1:04:15] reasoning, little bit of understanding
[1:04:16] and thinking. And that's why we are
[1:04:18] human beings. We are not just animal
[1:04:20] going by instant and everything. We have
[1:04:22] a little bit of reasoning. There are
[1:04:23] five senses of the of the of the flesh,
[1:04:25] five senses of of the of the spirit, but
[1:04:28] also one sense in the soul. But in one
[1:04:30] of the five senses of of of the spirit,
[1:04:32] there is reasoning. You have to reason.
[1:04:34] You have to have a little bit of mental
[1:04:35] reasoning, mental intelligence. But it's
[1:04:38] not what he's focusing on. He's saying
[1:04:40] you must you you must not lean on it,
[1:04:43] especially when it's against the word of
[1:04:45] God. You cannot take it above the word
[1:04:48] of God. You have to rely on the promise
[1:04:50] of God above any human reasoning. Amen.
[1:04:54] That's what the emphasis is on. So it's
[1:04:56] not about having no intelligence at all
[1:04:59] or what I should do digs without any
[1:05:01] understanding. But it is to consider
[1:05:03] what the word of God is saying above any
[1:05:06] other thing. Amen. Because the Bible is
[1:05:08] warning us in in Jeremiah 17:9 says the
[1:05:12] heart is deceitful in all things and
[1:05:15] desperately wicked. Who can know it? In
[1:05:18] other words, our thoughts, our desire,
[1:05:20] our intention are prone to mislead or to
[1:05:23] lie. Amen. and to twist the truth even
[1:05:26] to ourselves. Sometimes you can have
[1:05:28] mirror marriages, you know, you see
[1:05:30] things that you they are not they are
[1:05:32] not real. Your brain is just faking
[1:05:34] things. You see things that are not
[1:05:36] real. You hear things that you didn't
[1:05:39] hear. As you're getting older, sometimes
[1:05:41] I talk to my wife says, "Oh, why did you
[1:05:42] call me? Oh, I didn't call you. Oh, why
[1:05:44] that sound come from? You hear things
[1:05:47] you don't hear. Oh, I heard you saying
[1:05:49] that. No, I didn't say that. I didn't
[1:05:50] mean to say Or maybe I said you say
[1:05:52] things sometimes you didn't think what
[1:05:53] other say. So you can't rely on
[1:05:56] completely on what the human human heart
[1:06:00] is telling you, what the human mind is
[1:06:01] telling you. You have to have a super
[1:06:04] intelligence that you have to rely on.
[1:06:06] Amen. Are you with me this morning? You
[1:06:09] have to rely on a super intelligence
[1:06:11] what you that can direct you, that can
[1:06:13] lead you, that can be your guide. Amen.
[1:06:16] That's what he want. At the same times
[1:06:18] being a Christian does not mean you have
[1:06:20] to believe in anything. You know
[1:06:22] sometimes Christians they go on along on
[1:06:24] the conspiracy theories and they come up
[1:06:27] with something that oh that there's no
[1:06:29] head no no no no tailor. Oh wow that's
[1:06:32] quite that's quite something you need to
[1:06:34] have a faith to believe something like
[1:06:36] that really come this and they attribute
[1:06:39] it to that they attribute to one
[1:06:40] government. No, I mean Christian are not
[1:06:43] supposed to go in different kind of of
[1:06:45] conspiracy theories. Take the word of
[1:06:48] God. We have enough challenges to take
[1:06:50] the whole word of God than to create our
[1:06:52] own conspiracy theories. Just take what
[1:06:55] the prophet says. There is enough to
[1:06:57] give us perfect faith. There's enough to
[1:06:59] give us love of God by taking what the
[1:07:02] word of God says. Amen. That's what Paul
[1:07:05] said. For God has not given us the
[1:07:07] spirit of fear, but the spirit of power,
[1:07:10] the spirit of love, and the spirit of a
[1:07:13] sound mind. A Christian is the one who
[1:07:16] have the sound mind. Actually, without
[1:07:19] being born again, you don't have a sound
[1:07:21] mind. You need to be mean to be born
[1:07:24] again to have the clear mind and to
[1:07:26] understand what God is doing. Amen. And
[1:07:29] if you might see it later, you if you
[1:07:31] don't have the Holy Ghost, you can't
[1:07:33] have really a sound mind. You will be
[1:07:36] pulled by human impulses, by human
[1:07:38] thinking, you'll be following one way or
[1:07:40] the other way. But a Christian has a
[1:07:42] sound mind. Amen. In 1 Corinthians 14,
[1:07:46] Paul will be stressing on that and says,
[1:07:48] "If I pray in unknown tongues, my spirit
[1:07:51] pray, but my understanding is
[1:07:53] unfruitful.
[1:07:55] But what is then? I will pray with the
[1:07:57] spirit but I will pray with
[1:07:58] understanding also. So you can pray in
[1:08:01] the spirit can speak in tonesues and you
[1:08:03] can pray in tong. You can pray in
[1:08:05] tongues. You can pray and thanks but
[1:08:07] also at some point you have to pray with
[1:08:09] understanding. Amen. A Christian has
[1:08:12] this sound mind says I will sing the
[1:08:15] spirit but I will also sing with
[1:08:17] understanding also also when you shall
[1:08:19] bless with the spirit. How shall he be
[1:08:22] occupied? How how shall he that occupyth
[1:08:25] the room of the unlearned say amen at
[1:08:28] thy giving of thanks and seeing you
[1:08:30] understand not what thy says for verily
[1:08:32] I give thanks for for thou verily give
[1:08:35] thanks well but the other is not
[1:08:38] edified. So sometime we have to think
[1:08:40] about edifying than just being in the
[1:08:42] spirit. Amen. I thank God I speak with
[1:08:44] tongues more than eol. But yet in the
[1:08:47] church I rather speak with five words
[1:08:49] with my understanding that my voice I
[1:08:51] might teach other also than 10,000 words
[1:08:54] in an unknown tongue. Amen. Imagine I'm
[1:08:56] preaching in tongues.
[1:08:59] I can be preaching tongues and preach
[1:09:02] known tongues for you. I'll be
[1:09:04] preaching. Oh, I'll be feeling good and
[1:09:06] everything. But if you don't understand
[1:09:08] what I'm preaching, what good will it
[1:09:09] do, man? You need to understand what so
[1:09:12] you need to understand what I'm
[1:09:13] preaching. You need to understand what
[1:09:15] I'm saying. That's why the Pentecostal
[1:09:17] sometimes they go in one one side there
[1:09:19] will be just in tongues and speak in
[1:09:21] tongues on different things. There is no
[1:09:23] interpretation. Yes, I believe they're
[1:09:25] edified. But the one who speaking
[1:09:27] tongues edified but what about the
[1:09:29] church? What the church? It will be good
[1:09:31] to pray to have also a gift of prophecy
[1:09:34] so that you can understand and be
[1:09:36] edified. Amen. And the church is here to
[1:09:39] edify one another. Amen.
[1:09:44] The Bible says, "Blessed is the man that
[1:09:46] trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the
[1:09:49] Lord is, for it shall be as a tree
[1:09:52] planted by the water that spreadth out
[1:09:55] is her root by the river, and shall not
[1:09:58] see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall
[1:10:00] be green, and shall not be careful in
[1:10:02] the heal drought, neither shall seize
[1:10:04] from yielding fruit." So by putting your
[1:10:07] trust in the Lord, he shall give you, if
[1:10:10] you put your trust in the Lord, he shall
[1:10:11] give you the good understanding that the
[1:10:14] Bible is talking about. Do you know that
[1:10:16] Job prayed for good understanding? God,
[1:10:18] give me your understanding.
[1:10:21] He said, but where shall we where shall
[1:10:23] wisdom be found? In Job 28 says, where
[1:10:26] is the place of understanding? Man
[1:10:29] knoweth not the price thereof, neither
[1:10:31] is it found in the land of the living.
[1:10:34] The deaf said it is not me. The sea said
[1:10:37] it is not with me. So the understanding
[1:10:39] has to be somewhere. The clear
[1:10:41] understanding, the good understanding,
[1:10:43] the spiritual understanding has to be
[1:10:45] somewhere, brothers and sisters. Amen.
[1:10:50] Amen. Amen.
[1:10:52] David prayed for understanding. He says,
[1:10:54] "God, give me understanding. I shall
[1:10:56] keep thy law. That I shall keep thy law.
[1:10:59] See, I shall observe it with my whole
[1:11:01] heart." Solomon pray for understanding
[1:11:04] says God give therefore thy servant and
[1:11:07] understanding heart to judge thy people
[1:11:10] that I may discern between good and bad
[1:11:13] for who is able to judge these but these
[1:11:16] so great people and the speech pleased
[1:11:19] the Lord that Solomon had asked this
[1:11:21] thing you know Solomon had many things
[1:11:23] he could have asked but he asked one
[1:11:25] most important thing God give me your
[1:11:27] understanding give me your wisdom and
[1:11:30] God laughs at that prayer It was like a
[1:11:32] prayer of s of of of Samson that we saw
[1:11:34] that we that that we looked at it on
[1:11:37] Wednesday. God let me die to myself.
[1:11:40] Here it was same God give me your
[1:11:43] understanding. Give me your wisdom. Let
[1:11:46] me understand the way you understand
[1:11:49] because I can't rely on my own
[1:11:51] understanding. Can't rely on someone
[1:11:53] else understanding. God give me your
[1:11:55] understanding. The bride needs
[1:11:57] understanding of God. Let me see the way
[1:12:00] you see it should be our be our prayer.
[1:12:03] God loved that prayer so much that he
[1:12:05] gave him beyond the human wisdom. He
[1:12:08] came beyond what he could have asked. He
[1:12:10] gave him the wisdom but he also gave him
[1:12:13] the riches and the wealth and all the
[1:12:15] different things. He said because you
[1:12:16] have asked the right thing not for
[1:12:18] yourself but you ask in order to judge
[1:12:20] the people not to judge good good and
[1:12:23] bad. You have you have asked the right
[1:12:25] thing and I will give you an
[1:12:26] understanding heart. I believe Greater
[1:12:28] than Solomon is here. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:34] Now the real question I want to ask for
[1:12:36] this service this morning is we have our
[1:12:39] own understanding which could be
[1:12:40] misleading and God's understanding which
[1:12:43] we can call the spiritual understanding.
[1:12:46] How do we know the difference between
[1:12:48] God's understanding and our own
[1:12:50] understanding?
[1:12:52] How do we get God's understanding?
[1:12:55] It's I think for me it's quite the
[1:12:57] question. How how can I differentiate
[1:12:59] and know that this is just my
[1:13:01] understanding or this is God's
[1:13:03] understanding
[1:13:06] because those can be so close sometimes
[1:13:10] and with God's grace we want to be able
[1:13:12] no this is not my understanding this is
[1:13:14] God's understanding
[1:13:16] and and and and Paul is giving the
[1:13:18] answer to that question in 1 Corinthians
[1:13:21] 2:9-14 says but that is is written high
[1:13:26] Eyes have not seen nor ears heard,
[1:13:30] neither have entered into the heart of
[1:13:32] man the things which God had prepared
[1:13:34] for them that love him.
[1:13:37] And I believe this message that God has
[1:13:38] given us is something that God had
[1:13:41] prepared that God had hidden before the
[1:13:44] foundation of the world since the
[1:13:45] foundation of the world that could not
[1:13:47] be displayed. But in this time it was it
[1:13:50] was been revealed because the book has
[1:13:52] been open. The word of God has been
[1:13:55] open. The word of God has been restored.
[1:13:57] Things that have were hidden. Things
[1:13:59] that were the put aside. Things that
[1:14:01] that that the prophet and the hardest
[1:14:04] put aside. But at the end time as we
[1:14:06] have seen the seals have been open. Now
[1:14:08] we have a book that is open that we can
[1:14:11] know the mind of Christ. We can know the
[1:14:14] thinking of God. We can understand what
[1:14:17] God really means. But what the word of
[1:14:19] God says. Before we could read the Bible
[1:14:22] and not understand what the Bible was
[1:14:24] saying. But now with a clear eyes, we
[1:14:26] understanding with the revelation with
[1:14:28] your open the book has become an open
[1:14:31] book for us. We can read between the
[1:14:33] lines. Amen. We can understand what God
[1:14:36] meant when he says that. Amen. Because
[1:14:39] it's not only literal word, but the Holy
[1:14:41] Spirit comes and quicken the word of God
[1:14:43] and make his life for us. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:47] says, "Eyes have not seen nor hear or
[1:14:49] heard, neither have entered into the
[1:14:50] heart of man the things which God had
[1:14:53] prepared for them that love him." But we
[1:14:55] know that we also we're going to the new
[1:14:57] land. Amen. That God has prepared for
[1:14:59] us. But already now things are being
[1:15:01] unfolded. But God has revealed them unto
[1:15:05] us by his spirit. That's the key. God
[1:15:08] has revealed them has to us by the
[1:15:11] spirit. For the spirit searchth all
[1:15:13] things yet the deep things of God. For
[1:15:16] what man knoweth the things of a man,
[1:15:19] save the spirit of a man which is in
[1:15:21] him? How can you understand a human
[1:15:23] person if you don't have a human spirit?
[1:15:27] You can't expect an animal to understand
[1:15:29] as a human being because he doesn't have
[1:15:32] the spirit of a human being. You can't
[1:15:34] understand
[1:15:36] an animal has to an animal and an animal
[1:15:38] a lion has to understand a lion. An
[1:15:40] animal has to understand the animal. in
[1:15:42] order to understand really you need to
[1:15:44] have the mind of or the or the spirit of
[1:15:46] that animal. My my wife was was making
[1:15:49] me laugh the other day. Says, you know,
[1:15:51] they arrested one person then in the car
[1:15:53] and then the police arrested one person
[1:15:56] says, "Oh, how come you're driving?" And
[1:15:58] the person says, "No, I'm I'm a cat
[1:16:00] driving." identify himself as a cat.
[1:16:05] Then the police says, "Oh, that's a
[1:16:06] reason for me to really arrest you
[1:16:09] because normal cat don't drive."
[1:16:13] So, oh, that was a good insight of that
[1:16:15] of that policeman. How can a human being
[1:16:18] identify himself as a cat? Do you have a
[1:16:20] spirit of a cat? Maybe you are nabikar
[1:16:23] having that mind of a of a human
[1:16:25] understanding of of of of a cow or
[1:16:28] something like that. But we thank God
[1:16:30] for the spirit of God. Amen. So how can
[1:16:33] you understand God if you don't have the
[1:16:35] spirit of God?
[1:16:38] Only gods can understand God. Only sons
[1:16:42] of God can really understand God. Only
[1:16:45] those who have the spirit of God can
[1:16:47] really understand God. That's why it's
[1:16:50] important to be born again. That's why
[1:16:53] it's important to have the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:56] That's why it important to ask God, give
[1:16:58] me a personal revelation of the word of
[1:17:01] God. No one can teach you enough to
[1:17:04] understand God. It has to become a
[1:17:06] personal revelation to you. That's why
[1:17:09] the prophet says, "Lean not onto your
[1:17:11] own understanding. Let that desire be in
[1:17:14] your heart." God, give me more of the
[1:17:16] personal revelation of who you are. To
[1:17:18] know you better, to understand you
[1:17:20] better. Amen. Not only to know the act
[1:17:22] of God, but to know your ways, to know
[1:17:25] what you like, to know how can I have a
[1:17:28] personal relationship with you. To
[1:17:30] understand a person, you need to have a
[1:17:32] relationship with that person. Amen.
[1:17:34] With a wife, to understand the husband,
[1:17:36] they have to come to a point where they
[1:17:38] have a close relationship. They can can
[1:17:40] understand each other. Amen. So the same
[1:17:42] thing with God. But we cannot understand
[1:17:44] God if you don't have a personal
[1:17:46] relationship with God. We cannot
[1:17:48] understand God if you don't if you don't
[1:17:50] have that time that you spend in prayer.
[1:17:52] That's time you spend in reading the
[1:17:53] word of God. The time you fellowship
[1:17:55] with him. Amen. Amen.
[1:17:59] That's right. That how the spiritual
[1:18:01] understanding can come.
[1:18:04] So, now we have received not the spirit
[1:18:06] of the world, but the spirit which is of
[1:18:09] God, that we might know the things that
[1:18:12] are freely given to us of God. The
[1:18:15] things that are freely given to us of
[1:18:17] God. Things that are gi you know things
[1:18:20] can give things something can be given
[1:18:22] to you but you don't know what has been
[1:18:24] given to you.
[1:18:26] The world has received
[1:18:29] Malachi 4, but they don't know who
[1:18:31] Malachi 4 is. Things can be given to
[1:18:34] you, but you don't know what God has
[1:18:35] given to you. Things God can give you a
[1:18:38] good gift and God can give you a good
[1:18:39] wife, you don't know that is a good gift
[1:18:41] of God. God give a good husband, you
[1:18:44] don't know that it's a good gift of God.
[1:18:45] You look at the negative side sometimes
[1:18:47] or the negative side, but God, may God
[1:18:50] give us the understanding to know what
[1:18:52] God has given us. Amen.
[1:19:00] Amen. The prophet says, "Now this may
[1:19:03] chalk you to death, but did you know
[1:19:05] that men that are sons of God are
[1:19:08] amateur gods?" How many even know that?
[1:19:11] How many know that Jesus said so? The
[1:19:13] Bible said, "Did your laws say itself
[1:19:16] that you are gods? And if you call them
[1:19:18] gods, which God said in Genesis 2 that
[1:19:20] they were gods because they were they
[1:19:22] had full dominion over the dominion of
[1:19:25] the world, he gave him dominion over all
[1:19:28] things. And he lost his godship or he
[1:19:31] lost his sunship, but he lost his domain
[1:19:33] and Satan took it over. But brother, we
[1:19:36] are waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:19:38] sons of God who will come back and take
[1:19:41] it over again. Waiting for the fullness
[1:19:43] of time. Amen. We are living in a
[1:19:46] gracious, precious time, the time of
[1:19:48] adoption where we have to realize that
[1:19:51] we are sons and daughters of God. Son is
[1:19:54] daughter of God understand God. Amen.
[1:19:56] The only people who can understand God.
[1:19:59] When the pyramid gets up to the top, the
[1:20:01] prophet says when the full sons of God
[1:20:04] will be manifested, when the power of
[1:20:06] God will walk out, the prophet himself
[1:20:08] says hallelujah. And we will take every
[1:20:11] power that Satan has got away from him.
[1:20:14] Yes, it belonged to him. Amen. We were
[1:20:17] under spiritual amnesia. We didn't know
[1:20:20] who we were. We didn't know who we were.
[1:20:23] We didn't know even our identity. But
[1:20:25] when the word of God comes and reveal
[1:20:27] who we are, now we know who we are.
[1:20:30] Amen. We didn't know that we are sons
[1:20:32] and daughters of God. But when the word
[1:20:34] of God was open, we realize now are we
[1:20:38] the sons of God. Amen. Amen. By the Holy
[1:20:43] Spirit. Amen.
[1:20:51] The gift that freely give. Ephesians 2
[1:20:53] says, "For by grace are you saved
[1:20:55] through faith, that not of yourself, it
[1:20:58] is the gift of God, not of works, let
[1:21:01] any man should boast." Amen. But it's a
[1:21:04] free gift of God. We thank God for the
[1:21:08] free gift. Eternal life is a free gift.
[1:21:12] For the wages of sin is death, but the
[1:21:14] gift of God is eternal life through
[1:21:16] Jesus Christ our Lord. So we have
[1:21:19] received a free gift but we need
[1:21:22] revelation to know that the gift of God.
[1:21:25] God doesn't condemn the sinner because
[1:21:27] he remains the sinner. He condemns the
[1:21:30] sinners because he reject the way of
[1:21:32] escape that God has provided for every
[1:21:35] sinner to come out of that state that
[1:21:37] that state that he is in. That's why he
[1:21:39] con actually the sinner condemns himself
[1:21:42] because he's refusing the way of escape.
[1:21:45] Amen. But when you recognize the way of
[1:21:47] escape, usually the most thankful
[1:21:49] person. Thank God for revealing your
[1:21:52] word. Thank God for revealing the power
[1:21:54] of Calvary. Thank God for revealing the
[1:21:57] word of God to me, Lord, that you have
[1:22:00] opened my eyes. I was blind, but now I
[1:22:02] see, Lord. Glory to your name, Lord.
[1:22:05] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:22:09] For we have received not the spirit of
[1:22:10] the world by the spirit which is of God
[1:22:12] that you might know the things that are
[1:22:14] freely given to us of God. Praise be to
[1:22:17] God. Let me go back to the free gift of
[1:22:20] God. Israel was there and they received
[1:22:22] the Messiah. The Messiah was given to
[1:22:24] them but they did not recognize him as
[1:22:26] the Messiah. Do you remember the story
[1:22:29] of Gazi as he went? I like that story
[1:22:32] very much with Elisha.
[1:22:37] As the Syrian cames, the army Syrian
[1:22:39] came
[1:22:41] he didn't see what God promised has
[1:22:44] given them that the angel will be
[1:22:46] camping around those who fear the Lord.
[1:22:48] He look at the circumstances. He look at
[1:22:50] the the Syrian's army. He was shaken and
[1:22:53] he was came to the prophet Elisha.
[1:22:55] Elisha, you know what? You know what? We
[1:22:57] have been surrounded. We'll be lost.
[1:22:58] We'll be we'll be killed. The prophet
[1:23:00] told me don't worry
[1:23:03] don't worry the one that was on the side
[1:23:04] a great much much in a great number than
[1:23:08] the one that you see with your natural
[1:23:10] eyes because his eyes were were blinded
[1:23:14] he couldn't see but the prophet prayed
[1:23:16] oh God may you open his eyes so that he
[1:23:18] can see what is surround him let me tell
[1:23:21] you this morning I pray when through the
[1:23:23] preaching of the word our eyes can be
[1:23:25] open to realize that I'm more on our
[1:23:27] side than what the enemy can try to put
[1:23:29] against us. The one that is inside of
[1:23:31] you is greater than the one that is in
[1:23:34] the world. He that is in you is much
[1:23:37] greater, much powerful than the one that
[1:23:39] is inside of you. He that is in you is
[1:23:42] much more powerful than the symptoms
[1:23:44] that the enemy can try to put upon you.
[1:23:47] So take the word of God, lean not upon
[1:23:50] your symptoms, but lean upon the word of
[1:23:53] God, the promises of God. They are yay
[1:23:56] and amen, brothers and sisters.
[1:24:03] Luke 17:24 the Bible talks about
[1:24:08] Cleopas and his friend as they were
[1:24:09] going to the village called Emails.
[1:24:12] Jesus Christ when he came to them as
[1:24:15] they were sad. He said unto them, "Oh
[1:24:17] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[1:24:20] that the prophet have spoken." Maybe
[1:24:23] they have believed some part of it, but
[1:24:26] he comes and tells them you're slow of
[1:24:28] heart to believe all that the prophet
[1:24:30] has spoken to you. I wonder if sometimes
[1:24:33] the Holy Spirit is not rebuking us on
[1:24:35] that level. You have accepted only a
[1:24:38] portion of the prophet, but you need to
[1:24:40] take all that the prophet has given us.
[1:24:43] And we want to believe all that the
[1:24:45] prophet has given us. We don't want to
[1:24:47] be slow in understanding or believing
[1:24:49] what the prophet has told us, but we
[1:24:51] want to be quick to believe what the
[1:24:53] prophet has told us. That was Mary was,
[1:24:56] "Oh, let it be done to me according to
[1:24:58] your word." As we heard this morning,
[1:25:00] the prophet saying she was there not
[1:25:02] leaning upon her own understanding. How
[1:25:05] could this be happen when when a man and
[1:25:07] a woman without being together, how
[1:25:10] could that be? How could that happen?
[1:25:11] The angel explained to her, you know, it
[1:25:13] will be done to you. the Holy Spirit
[1:25:15] will overshadow you. Amen.
[1:25:18] Like what brother I think it's brother
[1:25:20] Shad was one of them said he says you
[1:25:21] know actually when he say that the holy
[1:25:23] spirit didn't explain too much saying
[1:25:26] that the holy spirit will overshadow you
[1:25:28] doesn't explain how it will happen
[1:25:30] doesn't explain scientifically how it
[1:25:32] will happen but because he said the holy
[1:25:34] spirit will overshadow you she just
[1:25:36] believed that word of god and she took
[1:25:39] that it will be made possible she did
[1:25:41] not have to explain everything she just
[1:25:43] un she just understood spiritually
[1:25:46] what the word of God say. Amen. We don't
[1:25:48] have to understand how we will be
[1:25:50] changed. But by taking the word of God,
[1:25:53] we know that our bodies will be changed.
[1:25:55] Actually, the change has already
[1:25:57] started. Amen. He changed your desires.
[1:26:00] He changed my desires. So, the work has
[1:26:02] already started. Mary had was quick to
[1:26:05] believe what the word of God says. Amen.
[1:26:07] May God give us the faith of Mary to
[1:26:10] believe everything that the word of God
[1:26:12] says.
[1:26:13] As the disciples were going to em they
[1:26:16] were looking at Jesus Christ in the face
[1:26:19] talking to him.
[1:26:22] Don't you know what has happened in
[1:26:24] Jerusalem or how they killed the
[1:26:26] innocent one our Lord? We thought you
[1:26:29] will be our Lord. They're talking to
[1:26:30] him. He didn't he didn't veil his face.
[1:26:33] We we we've closed and no he was openly
[1:26:36] talking to them but they couldn't see
[1:26:38] because of unbelief. They couldn't
[1:26:40] believe they couldn't understand. And
[1:26:42] they couldn't the natural understanding
[1:26:44] but they didn't have also spiritual
[1:26:46] understanding. They couldn't believe the
[1:26:48] word of God. So they were completely
[1:26:50] blinded.
[1:26:51] They're talking to him and he's
[1:26:53] expounding the word of God concerning
[1:26:55] himself as expounding the scripture as
[1:26:58] he's unveiling the scriptures. Then then
[1:27:01] the spiritual understanding start
[1:27:03] increasing. They starting believing.
[1:27:06] They start believing. They start
[1:27:08] believing at the time when he broke the
[1:27:10] the bread and he did the same thing as
[1:27:13] he did before the crucifixion. Their
[1:27:15] eyes were open and they recognize the
[1:27:18] master. This is the master. He's risen
[1:27:20] from the dead. He's open their eyes and
[1:27:23] they recognize who he was. Why? Because
[1:27:26] the word of God was open to them. The
[1:27:29] same thing for us. When the word of God
[1:27:31] is open to us, we recognize who he is.
[1:27:34] The message is not is not a theory is
[1:27:37] not is is not a philosophy. The message
[1:27:40] is Christ. Amen. Is God himself. Amen.
[1:27:44] When you take the word of God, you take
[1:27:46] God in your heart. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:49] Amen.
[1:27:53] Circle around to come to this point.
[1:27:55] Jesus Christ 3 John 3 says
[1:27:59] Jesus answered and said unto Nicodemus
[1:28:01] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[1:28:04] man be born again he cannot see the
[1:28:06] kingdom of God.
[1:28:08] Jesus answered verily verily I say unto
[1:28:10] thee except a man be born of the water
[1:28:13] and the spirit he cannot enter into the
[1:28:16] kingdom of God. That which is born of
[1:28:18] the flesh is flesh. That which is born
[1:28:20] of the spirit is a spirit.
[1:28:23] And the prophet say Jesus when he said
[1:28:26] that says verily except now he says
[1:28:30] except he won't be born again he cannot
[1:28:32] see the kingdom of god. Now you couldn't
[1:28:35] see the kingdom of god because the
[1:28:37] kingdom of god is the holy spirit. Now
[1:28:41] some standing here will not taste of
[1:28:42] death till they see the kingdom coming
[1:28:45] in power. He said then the kingdom of
[1:28:47] god the bible said is within you. It's
[1:28:49] within you, the spirit, the holy spirit.
[1:28:52] And you can't see that with your eyes.
[1:28:54] So see me. See means to understand.
[1:28:58] Have you ever looked at anything looking
[1:29:00] right at it and say, "Well, I just don't
[1:29:03] see it." Prophet says, "See, I just
[1:29:06] don't see it." You mean you don't
[1:29:08] understand it.
[1:29:10] See, you don't understand it. To see is
[1:29:13] to understand.
[1:29:15] But with your eyes, you look at
[1:29:17] anything. But with that what inside of
[1:29:20] you you understand with it you see with
[1:29:23] that. Amen. With the eyes of God you
[1:29:26] look. Now hold your point. Now here
[1:29:29] here's a good one. If you read the
[1:29:30] prophecy if you if you are ready for it
[1:29:33] the Christian looks at things that he
[1:29:35] doesn't see with his eyes with his
[1:29:37] natural eyes. For we look at the unseen.
[1:29:40] See how do you look at it? With your
[1:29:43] inside eyes. Amen. Oh, may God open our
[1:29:47] inside eyes more and more to see him
[1:29:50] more and more to recognize him more and
[1:29:52] more. So you see it by faith. You see it
[1:29:56] by faith. In other way you understand by
[1:29:59] faith.
[1:30:02] Faith is the real understanding we need.
[1:30:05] Amen. We need the spiritual
[1:30:07] understanding by faith and we need to
[1:30:10] live by faith. Amen. Now to prove that
[1:30:13] the whole Christian armor is made up of
[1:30:16] unseen qualities. What is a Christian
[1:30:18] armor? Somebody says seeing is
[1:30:20] believing. That person would never be a
[1:30:22] Christian if he says seeing is
[1:30:24] believing. Because the armor of the
[1:30:26] Christian is made of this love. Did you
[1:30:28] ever see it? You ever see love? You
[1:30:30] don't see love, man. You see it in
[1:30:32] action, but you never seen love. You if
[1:30:35] you can pull your part of love out and
[1:30:38] let me see what it looks like. The
[1:30:40] prophet sometimes it can be so simple to
[1:30:42] make it so clear. Amen.
[1:30:45] Love, love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:30:48] goodness, meekness, faith, gentleness.
[1:30:50] The whole Christian armor is unseen with
[1:30:53] the natural eyes but is understood by
[1:30:55] the heart. There you are. There you are.
[1:30:58] Says you understand. You look with your
[1:31:00] eyes but you understand with your heart.
[1:31:03] Amen. So in 1 Corinthians 2 30:13 says,
[1:31:08] "Which things also you speak not in the
[1:31:10] words which man wisdom teacheth, but
[1:31:12] which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing
[1:31:16] spiritual things with spiritual things.
[1:31:18] But the natural man receives not the
[1:31:21] things of the spirit of God, for they
[1:31:23] are foolishness unto him, neither can he
[1:31:27] know them, because they are spiritually
[1:31:30] discerned."
[1:31:31] 1 Corinthians chapter 2
[1:31:37] as pastor used to say maybe this message
[1:31:40] can never be passed on intellectually.
[1:31:43] You cannot understand the message
[1:31:44] intellectually. You can read, you can
[1:31:47] read, you can study it, you can do
[1:31:50] different things but unless you have a
[1:31:53] personal revelation to you, it will
[1:31:55] never be understood. Amen. The message
[1:31:58] need to be taken by faith. Amen. If you
[1:32:01] have to take it sometimes here or this
[1:32:04] and look intellectually and try to put
[1:32:06] word by word and compare, you can never
[1:32:09] understand the message. The message has
[1:32:11] to be understood by faith. Amen. Abel
[1:32:14] did not have the written Bible. Abel
[1:32:17] didn't have the written the message of
[1:32:19] the book that he can read or the tapes
[1:32:22] he could listen to. He just had to
[1:32:24] receive revelation. Amen. They all went
[1:32:27] Abel and Cain went to the same church.
[1:32:30] They went to the same church. They had
[1:32:32] the same prophet.
[1:32:34] The same They had the same prophet. Adam
[1:32:36] called him as a prophet because the word
[1:32:38] of God came to him. God was talking to
[1:32:40] him. They had the same prophet. They had
[1:32:42] the same pastor. They had the same
[1:32:45] pastor was preaching to them and
[1:32:46] preaching to them. But one had spiritual
[1:32:49] understanding. The other had carnal
[1:32:51] understanding. understanding the same
[1:32:54] words but one understand it connally the
[1:32:56] other one understand it spiritually and
[1:32:59] by their sacrifices we show it shows
[1:33:02] what kind of understanding they had oh
[1:33:04] God may you give us that spiritual
[1:33:06] understanding
[1:33:08] may you give us that spiritual
[1:33:09] understanding of the word of God not
[1:33:12] reason not human reasoning by faith Abel
[1:33:15] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:33:18] sacrifice than Cain Ken offered a
[1:33:20] certain sacrifice it was good But it was
[1:33:22] not the more excellent sacrifice God
[1:33:25] needed for that time. The Bible says by
[1:33:28] which he obtained witness that he was
[1:33:29] righteous, God testifying of his gift by
[1:33:33] it being dead by yet speaketh.
[1:33:37] So the same spiritual understanding that
[1:33:40] makes you accept the message of the
[1:33:42] hour.
[1:33:43] My sheep knows my voice. You might not
[1:33:46] be able to explain everything by
[1:33:49] intellectual words, but something inside
[1:33:52] of your heart tells you this is nothing
[1:33:54] else but the truth. This is nothing else
[1:33:56] but God speaking to me. This is nothing
[1:33:58] else has but the voice of God speaking
[1:34:00] to me. Amen. It has to become a personal
[1:34:03] voice speaking to you. As the igllet
[1:34:06] understood the voice of the mother, the
[1:34:08] chicken run away from the same voice but
[1:34:11] the igllet recognize this is the voice
[1:34:12] of my mother. Something has to speak to
[1:34:15] you. And I believe something has spoken
[1:34:17] to you. Amen. In order to be here,
[1:34:19] something has spoken to you for sure.
[1:34:22] That's why you are here. You can't
[1:34:24] explain it. You can't take the natural
[1:34:26] words and try to put everything
[1:34:28] together. Oh, but it's in the word of
[1:34:30] God. Amen.
[1:34:32] You know, sometimes being the wife of of
[1:34:34] of a preacher, sometimes I got my wife
[1:34:36] and I trick her here. I trick her here.
[1:34:38] I trick her here. I try to confuse her
[1:34:40] and she she she gets stuck and I'm like
[1:34:43] looking at her man says ah I don't can't
[1:34:46] explain but it's nothing but the truth.
[1:34:48] Okay that's the right attitude
[1:34:52] you know I only have one person to tease
[1:34:55] so
[1:34:56] I have to go
[1:34:59] that the right attitude because you
[1:35:01] can't explain everything but you just
[1:35:03] believe. Amen. Amen. So it's God's grace
[1:35:06] when you have that spiritual
[1:35:08] understanding by the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:35:11] Matthew 13 says, "Therefore speak unto
[1:35:14] them parables, because they see not, and
[1:35:17] hearing they hear not, neither do they
[1:35:20] understand. And in them is fulfilled the
[1:35:23] prophecy of Isaiah, which said, "By
[1:35:25] hearing you shall hear and shall not
[1:35:28] understand, and seeing you shall see and
[1:35:30] shall not perceive. For these people's
[1:35:32] heart is vexed gross, and their ears are
[1:35:35] dull of hearing, and their eyes they
[1:35:37] have closed, lest at any time they
[1:35:40] should see with their eyes, and hear
[1:35:42] with their ears, and should understand
[1:35:44] with their heart, and should be
[1:35:46] converted. And I should heal them, and
[1:35:49] blessed are your eyes, for they see, and
[1:35:51] your hearers, because they hear. Amen.
[1:35:58] The prophet says and put a comment that
[1:36:00] in exposition of church age. He says it
[1:36:02] is more evident that this scripture that
[1:36:04] no man of himself can hear God. That
[1:36:07] ability has to be given him of God. It's
[1:36:12] a free gift to you to be able to hear
[1:36:15] God. It says oh God I hear you speaking
[1:36:18] to me. Thank you Lord. Amen. Amen. We
[1:36:22] should never belittle that. We should
[1:36:25] never otherwise you'll be like oh no no
[1:36:26] I joined that church and then I got that
[1:36:29] theory they told me that so now I left
[1:36:30] that church oh no no no you don't leave
[1:36:33] the church of god once you are born in
[1:36:35] it you can never leave the church of god
[1:36:37] you are born inside of it I can never
[1:36:40] leave my family even if my father
[1:36:42] naturally says no I you come go away
[1:36:44] you're not part of me you're not you you
[1:36:46] put shame on my family I take your name
[1:36:49] out oh he can never undo me
[1:36:53] I'm part of the family. I have his blood
[1:36:55] inside of me. The same thing for God.
[1:36:58] When you are born in the church of God,
[1:37:00] you have the life of Jesus Christ. He
[1:37:02] can never undo you. Amen. You are part
[1:37:04] of him. You can never he can you can
[1:37:07] never die as God can never die. Amen.
[1:37:09] That's the power of the revelation that
[1:37:12] God can give you that we have the seed
[1:37:13] of God inside of you. Amen.
[1:37:17] I hope I'm not shouting. I hope it's
[1:37:19] okay. Amen.
[1:37:22] Matthew 16:17 prophet says the Bible
[1:37:26] says this as well Jesus answered and
[1:37:28] said unto him blessed art thou Simon by
[1:37:30] Jonah for flesh and blood has not
[1:37:33] revealed it unto thee but my father
[1:37:35] which is in heaven is the one who has
[1:37:38] revealed it unto thee. So prophet say
[1:37:40] putting those two verses together we see
[1:37:42] that there is only one group of people
[1:37:45] and that a very special group of people
[1:37:49] very special group of people you are
[1:37:52] very special group of people because you
[1:37:56] can hear the voice of God who are able
[1:37:59] to hear what the spirit says in each
[1:38:02] age. Amen. It is one special group that
[1:38:05] receives the revelation for that age.
[1:38:08] Amen. Oh, they can be good people,
[1:38:10] wonderful people, but sometimes they
[1:38:13] don't have the ability to hear the
[1:38:16] revelation for that age. What the spirit
[1:38:18] is speaking in that age. But God bless
[1:38:21] your ears because they can hear your
[1:38:23] heart because it can hear. Amen.
[1:38:26] Do you know that the real evidence of
[1:38:28] the Holy Ghost is when you are can hear
[1:38:31] what the spirit says in your age. This
[1:38:35] when the spirit is talking, the spirit
[1:38:37] is teaching you and you say amen to
[1:38:39] every word of God. That's the proof that
[1:38:42] you have the evidence, the Holy Spirit
[1:38:44] inside of you. Amen.
[1:38:47] The disciple never understood everything
[1:38:49] intellectually in the sense that they
[1:38:51] could clearly explain everything, but
[1:38:53] they still had the spiritual
[1:38:55] understanding. Oh my. For me, it's a
[1:38:58] paradox. You can't explain it, but you
[1:39:00] still understand it.
[1:39:03] Amen. Amen.
[1:39:05] Explain to me. No, I can't explain to
[1:39:06] you, but I still understand it. It's so
[1:39:09] clear to me. It's so clear. I don't see
[1:39:11] how you see. You don't see it. As
[1:39:14] brother Ron was putting it in
[1:39:15] illustration
[1:39:17] says, look at the image. Oh, I see a
[1:39:20] horse inside that other person look at
[1:39:22] the same image doesn't see anything. You
[1:39:24] know the mountain where brother banam
[1:39:26] his his face is on the mountain.
[1:39:29] Sometimes you look at people who don't
[1:39:30] see it the first time. You you don't see
[1:39:32] brother vanam the face of brother vanam
[1:39:35] there my kids are the first time when I
[1:39:36] show them I don't see daddy I don't see
[1:39:39] daddy it's so clear explain to me there
[1:39:43] is there something
[1:39:46] but at some point it clicked in them oh
[1:39:48] daddy I see it I see it I see it you see
[1:39:51] the same thing with the message of the
[1:39:52] hour you don't see it you don't one time
[1:39:55] oh I see it praise be to godmen
[1:40:02] Prophet says and they never did clearly
[1:40:04] the prophet says it's not I'm condemning
[1:40:07] someone of doing it if I do I do myself
[1:40:11] mistakes all people does it if the
[1:40:13] apostle walked with the lord
[1:40:14] misunderstood him they never did clearly
[1:40:17] understand him right at last they say oh
[1:40:19] lord now we understand
[1:40:22] so spiritual understanding is a
[1:40:25] spiritual revelation without it people
[1:40:27] will leave the message. The disciple did
[1:40:30] not have
[1:40:35] the disciples who did not have the
[1:40:37] spiritual understanding. They left the
[1:40:39] message in the time of brother of
[1:40:41] brother Banham and they left the message
[1:40:42] in the time of Jesus Christ. The prophet
[1:40:45] says in the unveiling of God say my
[1:40:47] subject this morning. I trust that God
[1:40:49] will reveal this each time if you if if
[1:40:52] you take the tapes and listen and hope
[1:40:54] and trust that that you have a spiritual
[1:40:57] understanding of what God has been
[1:40:59] trying to get over to the church without
[1:41:01] saying it right out. Sometimes God can
[1:41:04] speak and he doesn't say it right out.
[1:41:08] Time to ask the prophet are you are you
[1:41:10] Malachi 4? Prophet doesn't say never
[1:41:13] says you know the angel every time he
[1:41:15] goes he say the angel the two angel that
[1:41:17] went in sodom and he would take oral
[1:41:19] Robert the Billy Graham but there was
[1:41:21] one angel stayed with him his name was
[1:41:24] ending with ham but it never says
[1:41:26] brother banam the angel stayed brother
[1:41:28] banham no it doesn't mention that but
[1:41:30] you have to read between the lines says
[1:41:32] oh I understand I know what he's talking
[1:41:34] about he doesn't say plainly but you
[1:41:36] know what he's talking about that's what
[1:41:38] the bride is saying the bride understand
[1:41:40] what god wants wants you to understand.
[1:41:43] Like Rebecca says, "Give me water. Give
[1:41:45] me water." But what she understood,
[1:41:48] "Give me water and give me water also to
[1:41:50] the cameras." She had the spiritual
[1:41:52] revelation of what the pro of what the
[1:41:55] servant was telling her. The same thing
[1:41:57] for the bride. Amen. Sometimes not words
[1:42:00] by words, but the spiritual revelation
[1:42:03] behind that word. Amen. Amen. Amen. If
[1:42:07] you are in love with God, God will
[1:42:09] reveal more behind the word of God. I've
[1:42:11] been reading this, but oh now I
[1:42:14] understand what he meant. Amen. As the
[1:42:16] prophet would say, you know, I write a
[1:42:17] letter to my wife and I write there,
[1:42:20] honey, the kids are sleeping or she
[1:42:22] write to me and I read it and I know
[1:42:24] what she means between I know what she
[1:42:26] means it. Why? Because I love her.
[1:42:30] To understand God, you need to love him.
[1:42:32] Amen. It's a it's a it's a love affair.
[1:42:36] Oh, I understand the scripture because I
[1:42:38] love him. If you don't if you otherwise
[1:42:40] you you won't understand what is behind.
[1:42:43] That's why the Pharisees missed the law.
[1:42:46] They missed the they were practicing the
[1:42:48] law without understanding the law. They
[1:42:51] didn't have a spiritual understanding.
[1:42:53] But when the master of the Sabbath came,
[1:42:55] when the Lord Jesus Christ came, he knew
[1:42:58] he he understood what was behind the
[1:43:00] law. So it's not just living by the law,
[1:43:04] but there is a love affair behind the
[1:43:06] law. It gives the mind of God behind the
[1:43:09] law. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:43:14] Oh God, give us spiritual understanding
[1:43:15] more and more. So it's a thing the
[1:43:18] prophet says it's a thing. Sometime we
[1:43:21] have to say things in such a way that it
[1:43:23] might thin down. It might bring some to
[1:43:26] go out. Really?
[1:43:30] Prophet says, "Oh yeah, God has to say
[1:43:32] things in order to bring people to go
[1:43:34] out. Sometimes we want people to come."
[1:43:38] He said, "No, too much. Put some out."
[1:43:42] Oh God have mercy.
[1:43:47] He said some to go out, some to leave,
[1:43:50] some to ponder over, but are done
[1:43:52] purposely. It might be done that way. It
[1:43:56] must be done that way. Then it might be
[1:43:58] that some would say you mean God will
[1:44:00] purposely do a thing like that. Prophet
[1:44:03] says certainly he certainly did. He does
[1:44:05] yet. He said one day when he had
[1:44:07] thousands around him he said except you
[1:44:09] eat of the flesh of the son of man or
[1:44:11] the son of man and drink of his blood
[1:44:13] you have no life in you. That's a hard
[1:44:17] saying for some of them. It's hard
[1:44:19] saying I can't understand that they
[1:44:20] left.
[1:44:22] Some of them Peter didn't understand
[1:44:25] either but he still stayed. I will still
[1:44:28] stay. Where would I go? Where to whom
[1:44:30] else shall I go? You are the only one
[1:44:33] who have the words of life. Even though
[1:44:36] today I don't understand but I still
[1:44:38] stay. Amen. Today the preacher preached
[1:44:40] and I couldn't understand anything but I
[1:44:42] still stay. Amen. I listen to the tape.
[1:44:45] I didn't understand everything but I'll
[1:44:47] still stay. Amen. Amen. Because I know
[1:44:51] that where life is. Amen. We are not
[1:44:53] like Opa. You know Opa started and she
[1:44:56] she followed us the move. She follow the
[1:44:57] move. Oh, Ruth took the decision. So I'm
[1:44:59] taking two. I'm following by emotions.
[1:45:01] Oh, everything everything is fine. You
[1:45:03] know you know Naomi, we we want to stay
[1:45:06] with you. But one time Naomi says, you
[1:45:08] know what? Hey, let's try to reason a
[1:45:11] little bit. Let's try to reason
[1:45:14] intellectually.
[1:45:15] I'm so old. Even if you follow me, look
[1:45:18] and look at me. Can I be bear another
[1:45:21] child who will be your husband? Look,
[1:45:23] try to think a little bit.
[1:45:26] Reasoning you think, oh yeah, she makes
[1:45:28] sense. Oh yeah. Opa said, you know what?
[1:45:31] Oh, that makes sense. Can I be excused
[1:45:35] myself? You know, oh, I cry. I go and
[1:45:38] she went and reasonably intellectually
[1:45:41] she was right to go. But Ruth, something
[1:45:45] inside of her was just pulling. I can't
[1:45:48] leave you. Your God will be my God. Your
[1:45:50] people will be my people. Where you will
[1:45:52] be, that's where I'll be. That's where I
[1:45:55] will stay. Something was pulling her.
[1:45:57] That's what is called spiritual
[1:45:59] understanding. She couldn't explain it.
[1:46:02] But there was a reason God was pulling
[1:46:04] her. Amen. The patriarch, they didn't
[1:46:07] understand everything. They didn't
[1:46:08] understand everything. Abraham didn't
[1:46:10] understand everything. But he followed
[1:46:12] God by revelation.
[1:46:16] And all the patriarch was talking about
[1:46:20] I have to be buried in in the Palestine.
[1:46:22] I have to be buried in the promised
[1:46:24] land. All of them from Job, from
[1:46:26] Abraham, from Isaac, from Jacob. Amen.
[1:46:30] From from Joseph, make sure that my
[1:46:32] bones are buried there because it is a
[1:46:35] land of revelation. It's a land of
[1:46:38] resurrection. They didn't have a written
[1:46:41] book. They didn't have a written Bible.
[1:46:43] But they have a personal revelation from
[1:46:45] God. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:49] Where could we where else can we go but
[1:46:52] stay with the message of the hour? Let
[1:46:54] me buried in the message of the hour. It
[1:46:57] is the land of the resurrection. I know
[1:47:01] on that day I will be raised again.
[1:47:03] When I shall hear the trump in one
[1:47:06] moment, in a twinkle of an eye, my body
[1:47:08] shall be changed because I am in the
[1:47:10] land of the resurrection.
[1:47:16] Let me straighten that. Prophet says the
[1:47:18] writing of the son says, I think we are
[1:47:21] off the phone, but we are still here.
[1:47:23] Jesus said, he that hears my word and
[1:47:25] believe on him that sent me has
[1:47:27] everlasting life. I go down the street
[1:47:30] and take that literally what it is
[1:47:32] without the spiritual understanding. Now
[1:47:35] making it say something like this by
[1:47:36] just saying that what it says. You see
[1:47:38] here the right word there in the Greek
[1:47:40] in the original says he that
[1:47:42] understandeth my word. So he that
[1:47:44] understandeth my word and believed on
[1:47:46] him that sent me has everlasting life.
[1:47:50] In other words mean when you say
[1:47:52] understand doesn't mean it doesn't mean
[1:47:53] scientifically understanding. You might
[1:47:55] not be able to explain it. Once again
[1:47:57] this is my note. You might not be
[1:47:59] explain to explain it even understand it
[1:48:01] intellectually but at the same time you
[1:48:04] understand it spiritually.
[1:48:10] As we heard last time love produces
[1:48:12] faith. Love produces that spiritual
[1:48:15] understanding because faith is the
[1:48:17] spiritual understanding. Hebrews 11:13
[1:48:20] says faith is the substance of things
[1:48:22] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[1:48:25] seen. For by it the elders obtain a good
[1:48:29] report. Through faith, through faith we
[1:48:33] understand that the words were framed by
[1:48:35] the word of God.
[1:48:38] Really?
[1:48:40] Can you explain to me how the world was
[1:48:42] formed scientifically? Can you explain
[1:48:44] to me how the atoms split? How from
[1:48:47] nowhere those atom were? Can you explain
[1:48:49] to me scientifically? But still you can
[1:48:51] say by faith I understand.
[1:48:55] By faith I understand that the world
[1:48:57] were framed by the word of God. Because
[1:48:59] when God is omnipotent, you have that
[1:49:02] revelation. God is omnipotent. When he
[1:49:04] says the word of God, it has to come to
[1:49:07] be fulfilled. You might not know how it
[1:49:09] happens, but you stay with the word of
[1:49:12] God that you will come to be fulfilled.
[1:49:14] Amen. You might be sick today and you
[1:49:17] don't know how God can heal you. But let
[1:49:19] me tell you, let the faith of God gives
[1:49:22] you the understanding to know that you
[1:49:24] are healed. Amen. You might not
[1:49:26] understand how your children will come
[1:49:28] back, but let me tell you, may God give
[1:49:31] you the spiritual understanding to grasp
[1:49:33] the promise of God. I understand that
[1:49:36] they will come back. I can't explain,
[1:49:39] but I'm understanding they will come
[1:49:41] back. Amen. We cannot understand how you
[1:49:44] will be changed in the twinkling of an
[1:49:46] eye. But by faith you understand that
[1:49:49] you will be changed. Amen. A Christian
[1:49:52] has a clear understanding. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:55] Spiritual understanding.
[1:49:58] I know it will happen. I know it was
[1:49:59] formed. I know you might not know be
[1:50:02] able to explain how Joshua stopped the
[1:50:06] sun. Oh, but if he stop the sun, no, the
[1:50:09] world is turning. Which one is turning?
[1:50:11] I don't want to go in that discussion. I
[1:50:14] understand that he stopped the sun and
[1:50:15] the sun stopped. I know he did. I
[1:50:18] understand. It's so clear to me that he
[1:50:21] did it. Can you explain how Moses
[1:50:23] separated the Red Sea? I can't explain
[1:50:26] to you, but I know it happened. Can you
[1:50:29] explain to me how brother Bam created a
[1:50:31] squirrel? I can't explain to you, but I
[1:50:33] know it happened. Can you explain to me
[1:50:36] how he stopped how he how he stopped the
[1:50:38] storm? I can't explain to you but it
[1:50:40] happened. Can you explain to me how he
[1:50:42] was there at the cloud in 20 28th of
[1:50:45] February? I can't explain to you but I
[1:50:48] know it happened. We can't go into the
[1:50:50] discussion. We just believe what the
[1:50:52] word of God says and we move on. Amen.
[1:50:58] Faith
[1:51:03] faith is the sense.
[1:51:06] If they pray for you and you say, "Well,
[1:51:08] I don't feel any different." Prophet
[1:51:10] says, "You are not supposed to feel any
[1:51:12] different." You are supposed to believe.
[1:51:16] You're not supposed to understand
[1:51:18] intellectually. You are supposed to
[1:51:20] believe. Says,
[1:51:23] "So, you are not called to understand
[1:51:24] intellectually, but called to believe."
[1:51:26] We are not called to reason the word of
[1:51:28] God. Faith does not reason. Faith
[1:51:32] believes. A believer believes. Amen.
[1:51:34] It's part of my note. The faith if the s
[1:51:37] the faith is a six sense that makes you
[1:51:39] deny anything that is contrary to the
[1:51:42] word of God. Anything that is contrary
[1:51:45] to the word of God you deny it. You
[1:51:47] accept what the word of God says. Amen.
[1:51:49] Faith is the anchor. That's why despite
[1:51:52] the trials, despite the tribulations,
[1:51:55] despite the persecutions, your anchor
[1:51:57] holds. Your faith holds. Amen. God has
[1:52:01] given you the peace that passes all
[1:52:04] human understanding. How in the midst of
[1:52:06] trial can you still be joyful? How in
[1:52:09] the midst of trial can you still be
[1:52:10] praising the Lord? As in the midst of a
[1:52:13] of of a of a sickness, you are still
[1:52:15] raising your hands and God, you are the
[1:52:16] healer. How can you explain that
[1:52:18] scientifically? Oh, it's the anchor
[1:52:21] inside of your heart that keeps holding
[1:52:24] and saying, God is the truth. Amen.
[1:52:26] Amen.
[1:52:29] That's why the prophet say a Christian
[1:52:30] faith is based solidly upon rest. Amen.
[1:52:34] A Christian is not tossed about. A
[1:52:37] Christian doesn't run from place to
[1:52:39] place. A Christian doesn't fast and fume
[1:52:42] and worry about things. A Christian
[1:52:44] rest. It's all over. It's all finished
[1:52:48] for the believer at Calvary. That's
[1:52:49] right. Sickness may comes
[1:52:52] disappointment.
[1:52:54] Let me say that. Disappointment.
[1:52:58] Disappointment is when you expect
[1:53:00] something to come. Oh, and then that
[1:53:02] brother doesn't that to you. Oh, that
[1:53:04] sister doesn't that to you. Oh, the
[1:53:05] pastor doesn't that to you. The deacon
[1:53:07] doesn't come and visit you. You get
[1:53:09] disappointed. Disappointment will come.
[1:53:12] But the Christian is at rest. My anchor
[1:53:15] hold.
[1:53:17] Oh God, give us more that anchor to hold
[1:53:20] deeper deeper.
[1:53:25] So then knowing this that God is able to
[1:53:27] keep that which he has performed which
[1:53:30] he has performed as a as a sister and
[1:53:33] brother saying God is able. No matter
[1:53:35] what God is able to keep what he has
[1:53:37] performed. God is able knowing that no
[1:53:39] matter what the thing is and how it
[1:53:41] looks, there is neither sickness,
[1:53:43] sorrow, death, there is neither
[1:53:45] starvation or anything that can separate
[1:53:48] us from the love of God that is in Jesus
[1:53:50] Christ. We are at rest. Let the old ship
[1:53:53] toss in any way it wants to. The anchor
[1:53:56] holds. The anchor holds.
[1:54:00] Faith is the six sense. Is a real sense.
[1:54:05] Faith is not imagination.
[1:54:07] Faith is not a myth. Faith is not a
[1:54:10] hope. So faith is not a positive
[1:54:13] thinking. Faith is a sense. Is a real
[1:54:17] sense. I know that it will happen. How
[1:54:20] do you know? I know because God said so.
[1:54:22] That's what faith is. It's a sense of
[1:54:24] the paradox. A paradox is something you
[1:54:28] can't explain, but it's real. Amen.
[1:54:30] That's what faith is. Faith is positive.
[1:54:33] Faith does not reason. Amen. Faith takes
[1:54:36] God's word. Even when you can't explain,
[1:54:39] but you still take God's word. Amen. The
[1:54:42] bride is called to have perfect faith.
[1:54:46] Perfect faith in the perfect word. Amen.
[1:54:49] We have received the restored word. May
[1:54:52] God give us the perfect faith. Amen. To
[1:54:55] believe what God has given us. What the
[1:54:58] prophet says in the perfect faith says
[1:55:00] what? That's what's holding it away
[1:55:01] right now. It's waiting for that church
[1:55:03] to come into that perfect raptured
[1:55:07] faith. We are looking for it. It means a
[1:55:10] lot of shaving down for me, a lot of
[1:55:12] dying out. A lot of cutting off, a lot
[1:55:15] of circumcision. It means a lot for you.
[1:55:17] But together we will make it by the
[1:55:20] grace of God.
[1:55:23] Amen. Amen.
[1:55:26] Oh, is not God good. Amen. Just want to
[1:55:28] go to this part here and then I'll be
[1:55:30] finishing
[1:55:33] scripture that I've been trying to to
[1:55:35] unfold here is Corinthian 1 Corinthians
[1:55:37] 2.
[1:55:39] Go home and read the whole chapter. Just
[1:55:41] wonderful. 1 Corinthians 2:16 says, "For
[1:55:45] who had known the mind of the Lord that
[1:55:48] he may instruct him, but we have the
[1:55:51] mind of Christ." I like the way Paul is
[1:55:54] saying here. We have We have the mind of
[1:55:56] Christ. We have the mind. He He has a
[1:55:59] confirmation. We have the mind of
[1:56:00] Christ. How can you have the mind of
[1:56:03] Christ? The prophet William, I'm saving
[1:56:05] time, but in the you must be born again.
[1:56:07] that you might you have the mind of
[1:56:09] Christ when you are born again because
[1:56:11] you don't have your own thinking
[1:56:13] anymore. You have God's thinking. You
[1:56:16] think what God thinks. Amen. You take
[1:56:18] God's word. You take the mind of Christ.
[1:56:21] When you are born again, you are a a new
[1:56:24] creation born by the spirit of God. So
[1:56:26] your own thoughts are dead. Now you are
[1:56:29] accept you are living by the thought of
[1:56:32] God. Amen. We don't want our own
[1:56:34] thought. We want God thought. Amen. But
[1:56:36] now I believe in our age goes even way
[1:56:39] deeper beyond the new birth. It's way
[1:56:42] deeper because now we have the mind of
[1:56:44] our husband. We have the mind of Christ.
[1:56:47] Christ is the revealed word. We have the
[1:56:50] mind of Christ. We have the mind. The
[1:56:52] intelligent has come down. Amen. The
[1:56:55] capstone has come down. The headship has
[1:56:57] come down. We have received the mind of
[1:57:01] Christ. Amen. You know when a couple is
[1:57:03] married for a long time after so many we
[1:57:06] I think we fellowship someone around it
[1:57:08] after so many years people start saying
[1:57:10] oh this wife she talks like her husband
[1:57:14] she looks like her husband oh you look
[1:57:17] alike why because because you become
[1:57:21] part of part part of one another. You
[1:57:24] start thinking the same way. Sometimes
[1:57:26] you can be there and then oh and then
[1:57:29] the wife just picks up what the husband
[1:57:31] is saying without saying any word. Oh
[1:57:35] how do you know that you want? Because
[1:57:37] the wife she knows the husband. She
[1:57:39] knows the reaction. She knows what he
[1:57:41] thinking. People of the world will look
[1:57:43] at it. Oh that telepathy.
[1:57:46] Oh that brother that's telepathy. But
[1:57:48] for the bride no she's catching the mind
[1:57:51] of Christ. She knows what the husband is
[1:57:53] saying. But when he was discerning the
[1:57:56] thought, it was not the his own mind. It
[1:57:59] was the mind of God coming down and
[1:58:01] revealing the thought. Amen. It's not
[1:58:04] telepathy. It's the mind of Christ going
[1:58:06] into the bride. Amen. Now we have the
[1:58:09] mind of Christ. We start understanding
[1:58:11] what God wants. Amen. We have received
[1:58:14] the headship. The headship is the head.
[1:58:17] That where the intelligence is. That
[1:58:18] where the understanding is. Amen. So
[1:58:21] instead of having the natural
[1:58:23] understanding, now we have the
[1:58:24] intelligence of God coming to us and
[1:58:27] giving us the spiritual understanding,
[1:58:30] the spiritual revelation. Now we know
[1:58:32] how God thinks. Amen. We know how God
[1:58:35] wants. Amen. Amen. So not a struggle
[1:58:38] anymore. Oh, do this, do this. Oh, why?
[1:58:40] Why? No. I accept what my husband says.
[1:58:43] Amen.
[1:58:45] When the king when the king called
[1:58:47] Vashi, he called her and she thought she
[1:58:51] had a different thinking of what the
[1:58:53] what the king thought. Oh, he just want
[1:58:55] to call me to show me to his people. So,
[1:58:57] I don't want to go there. I want to have
[1:58:59] my own program here that the church I
[1:59:01] want to have my own program here, my own
[1:59:03] things and doing my own thing. But when
[1:59:06] when Esther came, she didn't want to
[1:59:08] have her own mind. She was talking to
[1:59:10] she was talking to the unic. You tell me
[1:59:13] what the king wants. I want you to tell
[1:59:15] me the mind of the king. You tell me
[1:59:18] what the That's what the the message
[1:59:19] comes. You're telling us the mind of the
[1:59:21] king. And once she understood the mind
[1:59:23] of a king, she accepted everything that
[1:59:26] the king wanted to do. That's what the
[1:59:28] bride comes. To have the true harmony
[1:59:30] with the husband, she has to have the
[1:59:32] mind of a husband. Amen.
[1:59:37] The prophet says we could be so
[1:59:39] committed to God that we wouldn't think
[1:59:41] our own thought, but you will think he
[1:59:43] thought. May I be so com may I may I be
[1:59:47] so committed to you, Lord, that your
[1:59:49] spirit will use my lips to speak, my
[1:59:52] eyes to see, not for a glory of man, but
[1:59:55] that the people might know that God
[1:59:57] keeps his word and that we are at the
[1:59:59] end time. Is that the desire of your
[2:00:02] heart as well? God, I want to be so
[2:00:04] committed to you that I think your
[2:00:06] thought and I see what you want me to
[2:00:09] see that I can't rely on my own
[2:00:11] understanding.
[2:00:14] The prophet says the Christ is revealing
[2:00:16] his own word. You can't see with your
[2:00:19] hands if it's part of the body. You
[2:00:21] can't see with the ears yet it can hear.
[2:00:23] You can't see with your nose yet it
[2:00:25] smells. You can't you can't see with the
[2:00:27] lips though it speaks yet. That was the
[2:00:29] Pentecostal age. But now it is in the
[2:00:32] eye time the seeing. Now there isn't one
[2:00:37] moving faculty behind beyond the eye. Is
[2:00:40] that right? The next is the intelligence
[2:00:42] which is Christ himself who controls the
[2:00:46] whole body. Now we at the time where the
[2:00:49] revealing of the word has come which is
[2:00:51] Christ and it say the same message says
[2:00:54] it says because that's the last thing
[2:00:56] says
[2:00:57] says Christ is the revealing of the word
[2:00:59] says then come out through the feet
[2:01:01] luther and come out through Wesley then
[2:01:03] it's the Pentecost of the tongues and
[2:01:05] the lips and see now it is the eyes the
[2:01:08] prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth now
[2:01:11] there is nothing else left for it to
[2:01:12] come but him himself to step into that
[2:01:15] because is the last thing that there is
[2:01:17] the next is the intelligence. We have no
[2:01:20] intelligence of our own. It is his
[2:01:23] intelligence. Oh, thank God for your
[2:01:26] intelligence. If I didn't have your
[2:01:28] intelligence today, I'll be swept away
[2:01:30] by Leodia.
[2:01:32] I'll be swept away by this intellectual
[2:01:34] age. Do you know that brother Bam even
[2:01:36] himself if he didn't have that
[2:01:38] intelligence coming down, he would have
[2:01:39] made a horrible mistake himself say I
[2:01:42] would have made such a horrible mistake
[2:01:44] preaching about the seals. I would have
[2:01:46] relied on intelligence of people who
[2:01:48] have so much educated and have talked
[2:01:50] about it. I would have made that
[2:01:52] mistake. But thank God for the
[2:01:54] intelligence that came down and revealed
[2:01:57] the thought of God. Thank God that it
[2:01:59] was not his own understanding. I can't
[2:02:01] rely on human understanding of a man of
[2:02:05] sixth grade. I thank God I'm relying on
[2:02:07] intelligence of God. The message of the
[2:02:10] hour is the intelligence of God being
[2:02:13] expounded. Amen. Amen.
[2:02:16] Oh, praise be. Do you love the message?
[2:02:19] I'm closing. Give me five minutes. It'll
[2:02:20] be 12 and I'll be closing. If Job had
[2:02:24] the intelligence, the understanding,
[2:02:28] then he could have had the answer when
[2:02:30] God challenged him.
[2:02:33] But the end of time now we have the
[2:02:35] understanding.
[2:02:37] Job 13 says when God is talking to Job
[2:02:40] said then the Lord answered Job out of
[2:02:42] the world wh worldwind and said who is
[2:02:44] this that darken counsel by words
[2:02:47] without knowledge. Get up now thy loins
[2:02:50] like a man for I will demand of thee and
[2:02:52] answer thou me? Where was thou when I
[2:02:56] laid the foundation of the earth?
[2:02:58] Declare if thou hast understanding.
[2:03:01] Job did not have the spiritual
[2:03:03] understanding that we have today. But
[2:03:06] now, thank God for Malachi 4. Thank for
[2:03:09] the opening of the word that can go
[2:03:12] beyond before Genesis 1. The message of
[2:03:16] the hour is the only message that can go
[2:03:18] beyond Genesis 1. All the religions, all
[2:03:22] the reformations and everything, they
[2:03:23] stop at Genesis 1. When God created
[2:03:25] heaven and earth, but goes beyond when
[2:03:28] God was not God, he still had you in his
[2:03:31] mind. Thank God for the mercy. can go
[2:03:34] beyond eternity to tell us the
[2:03:36] intelligence of God. We were in God
[2:03:38] thought. God, if we can answer to God's
[2:03:41] question, where were you? We were part
[2:03:43] of you. We were in your thought. We are
[2:03:46] you God. Amen.
[2:03:48] Oh, praise be to God.
[2:03:52] We are God because we are part of God.
[2:04:01] That's why as we read our opening
[2:04:03] scriptures, Paul is saying Christ is the
[2:04:08] head. It means the head is the one who
[2:04:11] controls
[2:04:12] every member because he's the head. So
[2:04:15] we have to take the intelligence from
[2:04:16] the head. If the head has come to govern
[2:04:19] and control the whole body, then each
[2:04:22] member should be in harmony. As 1
[2:04:25] Corinthians 12 12 says, "By one spirit
[2:04:28] we are all baptized into one body,
[2:04:31] whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
[2:04:33] we be born or free, we have been all
[2:04:35] made to think, to drink into one spirit.
[2:04:38] For the body is one member, but many.
[2:04:41] For the body is not one member, but
[2:04:43] many. But now had God set the members,
[2:04:46] every one of them, in the body, as he
[2:04:49] had pleased him. And if there were all
[2:04:51] one member, where were the body?" But
[2:04:54] now are we the many members, yet but one
[2:04:58] body,
[2:04:59] and I cannot say unto the hand, I have
[2:05:02] no need of thee. Nor again the head to
[2:05:05] the feet, I have no need of thee. Nay
[2:05:09] much more those members of the body
[2:05:10] which seem to be more feeble are
[2:05:13] necessary. If God is the head, it means
[2:05:16] each one of us we should have mutual
[2:05:19] understanding because we are part of the
[2:05:21] body. My hand here as can understand
[2:05:24] what the eyes the signal of the eyes he
[2:05:27] can understand and pick up send it to
[2:05:28] the to the brain and the brain comes to
[2:05:30] the end of the eye can see this is a
[2:05:32] danger and it goes to the brain and
[2:05:34] brain directs the the feet move away
[2:05:36] from that so we are all connected if we
[2:05:39] are all connected to the head then we
[2:05:41] are all connected you can't judge your
[2:05:43] brother you can't oh no this is one you
[2:05:46] can't criticize your brother you can't
[2:05:47] criticize your sister no we are part of
[2:05:49] one body amen you can't say you know
[2:05:51] what I I'm stay on my corner. I'm a
[2:05:53] single Christian on my corner. No, we
[2:05:55] are part of one body. We need one
[2:05:57] another. You need me, I need you. Amen.
[2:06:01] Never belittle yourself. Say no, they
[2:06:03] don't need me. I'm not necessary in that
[2:06:05] that place. I'm not necessary to go in
[2:06:07] that. No, we need you. Amen. You need
[2:06:09] us. Amen. We need one another because we
[2:06:12] are one body under the same one
[2:06:15] headship. Amen.
[2:06:17] You don't represent sometimes how such
[2:06:21] encouragement you are to someone.
[2:06:25] But why
[2:06:27] we don't want to wait on that day when
[2:06:29] you pastor you know then they give you
[2:06:30] testimony stays now in the church. You
[2:06:33] are testimony for someone. You're an
[2:06:35] encouragement for someone. Amen. Amen.
[2:06:39] The musicians can come as I'm closing
[2:06:41] otherwise I'll go to another part here
[2:06:43] but to bring me to another part is the
[2:06:46] discernment but keep that for another
[2:06:48] time missing income. Do you realize that
[2:06:52] we need more spiritual understanding God
[2:06:55] more revelation to know you better. Oh
[2:06:58] God give us the mind of Christ to think
[2:07:01] the way you think. Not our own
[2:07:03] understanding not our own reasoning. We
[2:07:05] cannot lean on our own understanding. We
[2:07:08] have to lean on the spiritual
[2:07:09] understanding of the word of God even
[2:07:12] when we cannot comprehend it
[2:07:15] intellectually. But we know that it's
[2:07:17] the truth. Lord, help me to stay true to
[2:07:21] your word. Even when it against my five
[2:07:24] senses of the flesh, when it's against
[2:07:26] my five senses of the spirit, but let me
[2:07:29] stay with your word and say what the
[2:07:31] word of God says. Amen. Amen. Let me
[2:07:34] keep pressing on until the other day.
[2:07:37] Amen. I'm living by faith.
[2:07:42] Living by faith.
[2:07:45] I care not. Let me
[2:07:49] I care not today what the moral may
[2:07:53] bring. If shadows or sunshine or rain,
[2:07:59] the Lord I know ruleth over everything.
[2:08:04] And all of my worry is made by
[2:08:09] living by pray
[2:08:13] in Jesus above.
[2:08:19] Resting, confiding
[2:08:22] in his great love.
[2:08:27] Safe from a heart,
[2:08:31] sheltering.
[2:08:33] [Music]
[2:08:35] I'm living by faith.
[2:08:39] And I feel no alarm.
[2:08:43] [Music]
[2:08:45] Tempest may blow and the storm clouds
[2:08:48] arise, obscuring the brightness of life.
[2:08:54] I'm never alarmed at the overcast skies.
[2:08:59] The master looks on at the strike.
[2:09:03] I'm living by faith
[2:09:08] in Jesus above.
[2:09:13] Trusting confine
[2:09:17] in his great love.
[2:09:21] I'm safe from a home
[2:09:24] in sheltering.
[2:09:28] I'm living by faith.
[2:09:32] I feel no alone.
[2:09:36] I know that he safely will carry me
[2:09:40] through no matter what. evils be tied.
[2:09:46] Why should I then care though the
[2:09:48] tempest may blow if Jesus walks close to
[2:09:52] my side? I'm living by faith. I'm living
[2:09:56] by faith
[2:09:58] in Jesus above.
[2:10:02] Trusting, confiding
[2:10:06] in his great love.
[2:10:09] I'm safe from a harm.
[2:10:12] You're sheltering on.
[2:10:16] I'm living by faith
[2:10:19] [Music]
[2:10:20] and no other.
[2:10:22] [Music]
[2:10:24] Our Lord will return to this earth some
[2:10:28] sweet day. Our troubles then will all be
[2:10:32] old.
[2:10:34] The master so gently will lead us away
[2:10:38] beyond the blessed heavenly shore.
[2:10:43] I'm living by faith
[2:10:47] in Jesus above.
[2:10:50] Trusting confiding
[2:10:54] in his great love.
[2:10:57] Safe from a harm
[2:11:00] in his sheltering arms.
[2:11:04] I'm living by faith.
[2:11:08] I feel no alone.

[2:11:15] continue living by faith. Amen.
[2:11:19] Amen. The solid rock stand in Christ

[2:12:11] rest on his unchanging grace. In every
[2:12:16] high and stormy care, my anchor holds
[2:12:22] within the veil.
[2:12:25] On Christ the solid rock I stand. Oh,

[2:19:45] has given me spiritual understanding. I

[2:19:50] know I'm there. I can't see it, but I
[2:19:53] know it's like a kite. You know, you
[2:19:55] can't see it, but you know the

[2:19:57] somewhere. I can feel the vibration of
