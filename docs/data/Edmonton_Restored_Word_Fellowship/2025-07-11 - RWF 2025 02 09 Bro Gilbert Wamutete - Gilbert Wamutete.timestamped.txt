[44:47] my heart.
[44:50] In all the world around me, I see his
[44:54] loving care. And though my heart grows
[44:58] weary, I never will despair.

[45:53] Gilbert. Amen.
[45:56] Let's welcome Brother Gilbert. Amen. And
[45:59] most of all, let's welcome our Lord
[46:01] Jesus. Amen. Amen. Because he brought
[46:04] the Lord Jesus with him.
[46:07] We got to take it. When he speaks, it's
[46:09] like our Lord Jesus speaking. That's
[46:11] what the five-fold ministry is all
[46:13] about. The Lord Jesus speaking through
[46:15] men. Hallelujah. Through the body.
[46:18] Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you, Brother
[46:20] Gilbert. So nice to have you here. God
[46:23] bless you.
[46:25] Amen. Have your liberty.
[46:28] Take your time. Hallelujah. I don't have
[46:30] to tell you that.
[46:33] I'm at home. God bless you. Amen. God
[46:35] bless you saints.
[46:38] God bless you.
[46:42] Feel welcome.
[46:45] Shake somebody's hand on my behalf. That
[46:48] would be your neighbor in heaven.
[46:53] On my behalf.
[46:58] Amen.
[47:01] Oh my.
[47:09] I'm happy to be in your meets this
[47:11] morning
[47:14] and uh I bring you greetings from my
[47:17] wife. She couldn't make it because of
[47:18] pressure at pressure of work at school
[47:21] but I know soon it will be over.
[47:25] And also I bring you greetings from Let
[47:27] Bridge Church. We are doing fine.
[47:35] Oh, I wish one of these days you could
[47:38] just transfer one Sunday over there.
[47:42] I also enjoyed the pastor when I was
[47:44] here now when he asked me to come. I why
[47:47] should I come? if he can preach such a
[47:50] wonderful sermon.
[47:52] But as he has said uh because of the
[47:55] five-fold ministry
[47:57] uh we have different approaches
[48:00] the same food but uh some will add
[48:04] spices
[48:06] from Caribbean from Africa and it makes
[48:10] the taste a little bit different. Amen.
[48:15] So without wasting time, let's uh turn
[48:18] to first Corinthians.
[48:27] First Corinthians chapter 13.
[48:42] First Corinthians chapter 13.
[48:49] Don't look for First Corinthians in the
[48:51] Old Testament.
[48:59] If you are there, you can say amen.
[49:02] Let's pray before we read.
[49:05] Our
[49:07] most
[49:09] precious heavenly father,
[49:13] the prophet said one time
[49:16] that the greatest privilege for a mortal
[49:19] human being is to close his eyes and
[49:23] open his heart to commune with the
[49:26] father.
[49:28] And that's what we are what we are doing
[49:30] this morning.
[49:32] As we close our eyes, we want to open
[49:36] our hearts
[49:38] not just to receive anything but to
[49:40] receive your word. Amen. For that's why
[49:43] we are here. Blessed Savior, now
[49:48] we come as hungry children
[49:52] and you said, "Ask and it shall be
[49:54] given.
[49:56] Seek and you shall find. Knock and it
[50:00] shall be opened unto thee. We are
[50:03] knocking at your door because you said
[50:06] you at the door to the sheepfold.
[50:09] Heavenly Father, would you honor the
[50:12] desires and the the the hungering of
[50:15] your children so that you come take me
[50:19] out of the way and feed your children.
[50:22] There is nothing I can give them myself.
[50:25] Father, there is what I've done as a
[50:28] human being according to my efforts. But
[50:32] Lord Jesus Christ, my efforts will not
[50:34] do anything. I depend on you. May you
[50:38] come down now, heavenly father, in your
[50:40] own way. Lord, speak to each one of us.
[50:43] Father, may you start with me, heavenly
[50:47] father. As you walk in our meetings, may
[50:50] you touch every soul. Father, Lord
[50:53] Jesus, so that when we come to the end
[50:54] of the service, may each one of say,
[50:57] "Surely God has spoken to my heart."
[51:01] Grant it, dear heavenly father, even now
[51:03] the reading of the scripture. May you
[51:06] pray the breath of life upon it, Lord
[51:08] Jesus Christ, so that Lord, we may be
[51:12] able to get the understanding of that
[51:14] scripture as it is today.
[51:17] Grant it dear heavenly father is our
[51:19] prayer for it's in Jesus Christ's name
[51:21] we pray
[51:25] first Corinthians chapter 13 you will
[51:28] start from verse 9
[51:31] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[51:35] part but when that which is perfect is
[51:38] come then that which is in part shall be
[51:41] done away when I was a child I spake as
[51:45] a child I understood as a child. I
[51:48] thought as a child. But when I became a
[51:52] man, I put away childish things. For now
[51:56] we see through a class darkly.
[51:59] But then face to face. Now I know in
[52:03] part, but then shall I know even as also
[52:08] I am known. And now abideth faith, hope,
[52:13] charity. these three, but the greatest
[52:16] of these is charity. May God bless the
[52:20] reading of the word. You can have your
[52:21] seats.
[52:27] Amen.
[52:31] I love this church,
[52:35] pastor. I love you.
[52:38] Here is the only place I preach my heart
[52:41] out.
[52:43] Amen.
[52:45] So uh this morning
[52:49] by the way I didn't finish the other
[52:51] subject we were we were having but I
[52:54] will connect it somehow.
[52:57] But uh this morning I want us to look at
[53:01] perfection
[53:07] and uh we are talking about crossing
[53:09] children into perfection. Yes.
[53:14] Now
[53:17] we are in a time of crossing Jordan.
[53:22] Amen.
[53:24] Now that day
[53:26] that day
[53:29] this scripture is fulfilled in our in
[53:32] our eyes because the perfect one has
[53:36] come.
[53:41] Amen. Amen. Amen. Paul wanted to enter
[53:45] this land of perfection. Yes, sir.
[53:48] That's what we have read.
[53:51] Paul wanted to enter this land of
[53:54] perfection.
[53:56] But he says he knew in part.
[54:02] He could see darkly.
[54:06] But he said when the perfect one comes.
[54:09] Now when was this perfect one to come?
[54:13] Hello.
[54:16] When was this perfect one to come?
[54:20] This scripture can't just remain open
[54:22] like that. A time has to come where
[54:24] somebody can say this day this scripture
[54:27] is fulfilled.
[54:32] Amen. Now the children of Israel, they
[54:37] left Egypt to go to Cana.
[54:44] Now
[54:46] God could not take unbelievers
[54:51] from Egypt and take them to the land of
[54:54] another unbelievers.
[54:57] That's right.
[55:01] If he had to do away with the Canonites
[55:04] so that he could bring in a new people,
[55:06] then these people must be different.
[55:12] Oh, God help us. Then these people might
[55:15] be different. Must be different. He
[55:18] cannot take out nonbelievers and bring
[55:21] in nonbelievers.
[55:25] That's right.
[55:27] May God help me
[55:30] to know where I am
[55:36] now.
[55:40] An entrance has been ministered unto us
[55:43] to enter this land. Amen. Oh, brother
[55:46] Andrew, thank you for that song. There
[55:48] is a land.
[55:52] There is a land. Now this morning we
[55:55] want to talk about that land
[55:58] and if time will not allow we will we
[56:01] will see how we what happens now when
[56:04] you are inside that land
[56:08] but for today let's talk about crossing
[56:10] over Lord
[56:13] now we are predestinated to enter into
[56:17] that land
[56:21] those who entered When they started the
[56:24] journey, oh, they were rejoicing.
[56:27] They were thanking God. Oh, praise God.
[56:29] Hallelujah. We thank God for the
[56:31] miracles. That was fine. But miracles
[56:35] never took them to the promised land.
[56:45] They had miracles. They ate the angels
[56:49] food.
[56:52] But that one never took them to the
[56:54] promised land.
[56:58] Now
[57:00] by grace and mercy the pride is crossing
[57:03] Jordan
[57:05] now the children of o of Israel going
[57:08] into the promised land. It was a short
[57:10] distance
[57:12] very short
[57:15] and the biggest problem was to know the
[57:17] direction where you are going.
[57:22] By knowing the direction where you are
[57:24] going, then you lean unto your own
[57:26] understanding.
[57:29] You forget about following the leader
[57:34] the guide.
[57:37] So it was a short distance.
[57:40] But why it took them 40 years? Yes sir.
[57:47] One the prophet says God was testing
[57:50] them to know what was in their hearts.
[57:56] God was trying to make sure that all
[58:00] unbelievers are gone out.
[58:04] Because this land was for believers.
[58:08] Lord help me. Let me be a believer.
[58:14] This land was for believers.
[58:17] So God only wanted the believers to
[58:19] enter into that promised land.
[58:31] That generation
[58:33] that did not believe, God could not
[58:36] allow them to enter. That's right.
[58:41] God help me to be a believer.
[58:48] Now they when then they came at Kadesh
[58:51] Paneer
[58:53] where a decision was to be made.
[58:57] Either you are going in or you remain
[58:59] behind.
[59:01] A decision has to be made.
[59:07] Now at Kadesh Bane they behold Jordan.
[59:12] They saw a cross.
[59:14] The land is there.
[59:19] On Jordan sto
[59:23] I stand and cast a wishful No, it's no
[59:28] time to cast a wishful eye.
[59:34] Wh why should I just sit on this other
[59:36] side and you look at it and say, "Oh,
[59:38] it's a beautiful land."
[59:41] Let's cross and enter that land.
[59:47] Why? Because a cross children is
[59:49] perfection.
[59:52] Hallelujah.
[59:54] We can summarize there and go.
[59:57] Across children is perfection. Is a
[1:00:00] perfect land.
[1:00:03] They had the promise but what they
[1:00:05] needed was to believe the promise.
[1:00:09] The promise is there. Now yours is to
[1:00:12] believe the promise. Once you once you
[1:00:16] believe the promise then you follow the
[1:00:18] leader.
[1:00:27] Please give me slide number two.
[1:00:38] Paragraph 144. But Joshua said it was 40
[1:00:41] years before we took the land. He didn't
[1:00:46] say when we would take the land. But he
[1:00:49] said he let that old generation die off
[1:00:53] them unbelievers and raised up another
[1:00:57] generation.
[1:00:59] Amen. that believed. He didn't say when
[1:01:03] they would take the land, but he said
[1:01:05] they would take the land and we took it.
[1:01:09] The promise was to take the land. Amen.
[1:01:13] All right.
[1:01:16] Oh my goodness.
[1:01:19] Okay,
[1:01:21] let's move on.
[1:01:25] Now it it has reached at a time when
[1:01:28] people are disbelieving the message.
[1:01:36] Why? It is very easy to disbelieve the
[1:01:39] message.
[1:01:41] One, if you don't know the promise.
[1:01:49] Please help me.
[1:01:53] If you don't know the promise,
[1:01:57] anything that comes your way, you grab
[1:01:59] it
[1:02:04] and you don't leave the message but the
[1:02:07] message leaves you.
[1:02:10] If you get stagnated,
[1:02:14] then what happens?
[1:02:16] The message leaves you.
[1:02:19] Why? God turns a corner
[1:02:23] and once he turns a corner you remain
[1:02:27] there. You will remain in the building.
[1:02:30] You will remain in restore restore water
[1:02:34] assembly or fellowship but you are not
[1:02:36] moving.
[1:02:38] But God wants us to move.
[1:02:41] Where are we going? We are looking at
[1:02:43] the promise.
[1:02:45] Now what is the promise?
[1:02:52] Amen.
[1:02:54] Let's look at the promise now.
[1:02:58] Slide number three.
[1:03:02] Okay.
[1:03:03] Paragraph 57. It was about 3:00 in the
[1:03:08] morning. I suppose I had gotten up and I
[1:03:13] looked where?
[1:03:15] in front of me and I was coming down to
[1:03:18] the Jordan.
[1:03:20] Looked like I was standing on the map of
[1:03:23] Palestine and I was coming down to the
[1:03:26] Jordan and I and seemed like I could
[1:03:31] hear the song I am going down to the
[1:03:34] Jordan. Someone was singing it. And as I
[1:03:38] drew near the river, I looked back and I
[1:03:41] seen which way I had come. And I was 2/3
[1:03:45] of the way there to the Jordan. And I
[1:03:49] looked across Jordan and I said, "Oh,
[1:03:52] praise God. Just on the other side is
[1:03:56] where all the promises lay. Every
[1:03:59] promise lays in the promised land."
[1:04:06] The prophet is saying he had come two.
[1:04:12] Are you following saints? Amen. Amen. He
[1:04:16] had come two/3s of the journey.
[1:04:22] So where is the promise?
[1:04:25] Is the other third you have to complete
[1:04:28] it.
[1:04:34] Now two of the ministry the first the
[1:04:38] first first one was the first pool which
[1:04:41] was the healing ministry. Amen.
[1:04:44] The second one was discernment.
[1:04:47] And we like them.
[1:04:50] We enjoy them. Yeah. We enjoy healing.
[1:04:54] Yes. We enjoy discernment. Oh, brother,
[1:04:58] what has the prophet said about me?
[1:05:02] We want discernments. Which is good.
[1:05:05] Amen.
[1:05:08] But now the prophet is saying when he
[1:05:11] looked he had just come two of the
[1:05:14] journey.
[1:05:16] Now what was the remaining a third? The
[1:05:20] remaining a third was the third pool.
[1:05:26] The opening of the word.
[1:05:33] I don't know if you are seeing it.
[1:05:39] Yeah, we are looking at the promise.
[1:05:42] Now, here the prophet looked and he saw
[1:05:45] he had just come two of the journey. He
[1:05:49] had just covered healing. He had just
[1:05:51] covered discernments. Now there remainth
[1:05:55] the third part of the journey. Amen. Now
[1:05:59] what was the other part? The other part
[1:06:01] of the journey is the third pool.
[1:06:11] Now what is the third pool? Is the
[1:06:14] opening of the word which is the
[1:06:17] entrance to the glorious land.
[1:06:21] [Music]
[1:06:23] So what happens
[1:06:25] once you receive
[1:06:28] the word
[1:06:31] the opening of the word when you receive
[1:06:34] it it keeps an hindrance to enter into
[1:06:38] that glorious land.
[1:06:41] Yes Lord.
[1:06:45] So where are we?
[1:06:49] Hello saints
[1:06:52] where are we
[1:06:54] as we shall see the time for churchity
[1:06:57] is gone
[1:07:00] the time to play the church is gone
[1:07:03] yeah the church you wake up and say let
[1:07:06] me just go and see what what the pastor
[1:07:09] has to say this morning is not the
[1:07:10] pastor
[1:07:13] it is now time let us cross over and
[1:07:18] enter into that glorious land where all
[1:07:22] the promises
[1:07:24] lay.
[1:07:27] Hallelujah.
[1:07:29] Oh,
[1:07:35] it is a literal land. It's a spiritual
[1:07:37] land and is a land of rest.
[1:07:41] Paul desired that land but he could not
[1:07:44] see it.
[1:07:46] But when brother Pranam looked, he saw
[1:07:48] perfection. He saw the promises
[1:07:54] inside that land.
[1:07:58] If I go ahead of my sermon, inside that
[1:08:01] land, that land of perfection, the
[1:08:04] prophet says it is as though you never
[1:08:07] sinned in the first place. You are
[1:08:09] perfect. Hallelujah. That is inside.
[1:08:12] Yes. Yes.
[1:08:13] inside. God does not see your sins.
[1:08:20] Let me put it this way. I'm quoting the
[1:08:23] prophet. The prophet says, "Inside that
[1:08:26] land, all your sins of the past, all
[1:08:30] your sins of the present, and all your
[1:08:33] sins of the future, they have been
[1:08:34] atoned for."
[1:08:37] [Music]
[1:08:40] Does that give you a guarantee to sin?
[1:08:43] No.
[1:08:48] That's another level
[1:08:52] where we want to reach. Yes. So that
[1:08:55] once you are inside there, you can sing
[1:08:58] Amazing Grace. Hallelujah. And when you
[1:09:01] sing Amazing Grace, you have no time.
[1:09:04] You have no room to sin.
[1:09:11] Oh my.
[1:09:17] Amen.
[1:09:19] Still slide number three, the second
[1:09:23] one, the anointed ones at the end time.
[1:09:26] Notice the very day when this messenger
[1:09:29] not when he starts on but when he begins
[1:09:32] to declare his message
[1:09:36] not when he starts
[1:09:39] but when he begins to declare the
[1:09:42] message so what is the message
[1:09:50] it's there
[1:09:53] read it for yourself That's right. Not
[1:09:56] when he starts, but when he begins to
[1:09:59] declare the message. What is this
[1:10:01] message that is being declared? It is an
[1:10:04] hindrance to usher you into the promised
[1:10:06] land
[1:10:08] where all the promises lay.
[1:10:14] Hallelujah.
[1:10:15] Every promise in the book is mine.
[1:10:20] Every chapter, every verse, every line.
[1:10:25] Can we claim it? Can we claim it?
[1:10:30] Can we say every promise is mine?
[1:10:33] Brother, can you say every promise is
[1:10:37] That's what we need. We come to a point
[1:10:40] where now we claim our promises.
[1:10:47] said, "Give me my mountain.
[1:10:51] Give me my mountain." He was claiming
[1:10:53] the promise.
[1:10:55] Give me my mountain.
[1:10:58] Healing is my mountain. You promised it.
[1:11:00] Give me. Deliverance is my mountain.
[1:11:03] Give it to me. It is the promise you
[1:11:06] promised. I need it now.
[1:11:10] I want to be delivered.
[1:11:12] Amen.
[1:11:19] Amen.
[1:11:22] The first pool was healing.
[1:11:25] Second pool was prophesying.
[1:11:29] Third pool, the opening of the word, the
[1:11:33] mysteries revealed. No more there is no
[1:11:38] no more higher order to reveal the word
[1:11:41] than prophets. Amen.
[1:11:45] Amen.
[1:11:49] Okay. Slide number four.
[1:11:53] What a day. What a day. What a time that
[1:11:57] we are living.
[1:11:59] This great mystery of God being finished
[1:12:04] bringing into the courthead showing what
[1:12:08] it is.
[1:12:09] how this little isims and went off and
[1:12:12] met him this and somebody met him this
[1:12:16] and somebody made him that. But the
[1:12:19] angel of the Lord come down and brought
[1:12:22] up all the their isims and pulled out
[1:12:26] that truth out of it and presented it.
[1:12:32] Have you received it? Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:12:36] Amen. Amen. When he pulled that truth,
[1:12:41] took away all the isims.
[1:12:45] These ones, they run this way, they run
[1:12:47] that way. But he pulls them and puts
[1:12:51] them and presents it to who? To the
[1:12:54] bride.
[1:12:56] For what purpose?
[1:12:58] So that the pride can unite with the
[1:13:02] pride.
[1:13:04] Hallelujah.
[1:13:06] Lord
[1:13:13] God help us. Lord
[1:13:17] now
[1:13:18] slide number five.
[1:13:22] We see the nations uniting. We see the
[1:13:25] world uniting. We see the churches
[1:13:28] uniting. We see the bride uniting.
[1:13:32] Uniting with the word. Why? The word is
[1:13:36] God. And as the word as the bridegroom
[1:13:40] being the word and the bride being the
[1:13:43] hearer of the word. How many hearers of
[1:13:45] the word are here?
[1:13:49] The bridegroom is the word.
[1:13:53] The bride is the hearer of the word.
[1:13:55] Amen.
[1:13:57] Now the pride is uniting with a one.
[1:14:02] Lord,
[1:14:05] oh they come together in a union. They
[1:14:09] unite like a wedding. They are getting
[1:14:12] ready for a wedding. They become one.
[1:14:16] The word becomes you. You become the
[1:14:18] what. Jesus said at that day you will
[1:14:21] know. Amen. that in that day you will
[1:14:25] know that I am in the father, father in
[1:14:29] me, I in you and you in me. What a day.
[1:14:35] What day?
[1:14:40] Hello.
[1:14:42] Are we following?
[1:14:46] Which day?
[1:14:48] So can we say this day this scripture is
[1:14:50] fulfilled? Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.
[1:14:53] Lord, pastor, you met us to sing he
[1:14:55] lives
[1:14:58] and we are happy to sing he lives
[1:15:00] because we are seeing it on the screen.
[1:15:03] But can you prove that he lives in you?
[1:15:10] Hello.
[1:15:13] I will go very slowly.
[1:15:16] I I I want this one to sink because it
[1:15:20] is later than we think. Yes Lord.
[1:15:24] Yeah.
[1:15:27] We can see nations are uniting. Yes. The
[1:15:30] churches are uniting. Yeah. But the
[1:15:33] bride is also uniting.
[1:15:36] Uniting with what? Uniting with the
[1:15:39] word.
[1:15:41] Now as they unite with the word, you
[1:15:44] become the word.
[1:15:49] So once you become the word
[1:15:54] then you can say I've crossed Jordan
[1:16:02] I've crossed Jordan
[1:16:04] why I have united with the word so now
[1:16:09] when somebody sees you
[1:16:13] the person does not see a human being
[1:16:17] but should see the word.
[1:16:20] I'm privileged this morning to be
[1:16:23] addressing the the word.
[1:16:27] Yeah.
[1:16:29] You take it, you eat it, you become that
[1:16:33] word. Amen. Amen. Amen. Lord, create in
[1:16:37] me more hunger and thirst for the word.
[1:16:39] Create
[1:16:42] in me more hunger and thirst for the
[1:16:45] word.
[1:16:47] Eat it.
[1:16:49] Wake up eating the word. Hallelujah.
[1:16:52] Stay eating the word. Hallelujah. Until
[1:16:55] you become that word. Hallelujah. Then
[1:16:57] we can say the union has taken place.
[1:17:03] Amen.
[1:17:07] Slide number six.
[1:17:12] But since the opening of those seven
[1:17:15] seals of them angels that just behind
[1:17:18] the mountain yonder, this has become a
[1:17:22] new book. It is the thing that has been
[1:17:25] hit being revealed as God promised in
[1:17:28] Revelation 10. He would do it. And we
[1:17:32] are the privileged people that God has
[1:17:35] chosen of the earth that we might see
[1:17:38] and understand these things.
[1:17:41] That's right.
[1:17:44] Seeing is one thing.
[1:17:47] Yeah.
[1:17:49] We have had people say you you you talk
[1:17:52] to somebody do you see it? Yes, I see.
[1:17:58] What does that mean? I now understand
[1:18:00] what you are talking about. Yeah. So now
[1:18:04] the prophet is so is saying
[1:18:08] until you come to a point where you see
[1:18:11] and understand.
[1:18:16] How can you prove that you have
[1:18:19] understood it? Now it becomes your life.
[1:18:26] It becomes your life. Amen. God help us.
[1:18:35] Now we need to cross we what we need in
[1:18:40] order to cross Jordan.
[1:18:44] Yeah.
[1:18:46] We need a prophet.
[1:18:49] We need a Joshua. Yes. We need a pillar
[1:18:52] of fire by night and a cloud by day.
[1:18:58] Yeah. So that you don't stop
[1:19:02] by giving an excuse. That is darkness. I
[1:19:06] cannot walk.
[1:19:08] Hello.
[1:19:10] Do you see? You need the pillar of fire.
[1:19:14] Amen. By night and a cloud by day so
[1:19:19] that you keep going.
[1:19:22] Don't stop. Keep going.
[1:19:26] Brother, sister, let's keep on going.
[1:19:29] Let's move on. Amen. The movie is on.
[1:19:35] Don't stop. Let's move on.
[1:19:38] Yes, Lord. Let's move on. Help somebody.
[1:19:45] Hold somebody.
[1:19:47] Hold somebody in prayer. Lord, pray for
[1:19:50] that person.
[1:19:53] Amen.
[1:19:59] Then we need a guide, the Holy Spirit.
[1:20:06] But when people reach Jordan, they start
[1:20:09] trembling.
[1:20:14] How?
[1:20:17] Because when the spice went
[1:20:21] out of 10, eight gave a false report.
[1:20:31] I just want that one to sink fast.
[1:20:35] They went 10
[1:20:38] 8 they gave a false report.
[1:20:43] What was the false false report?
[1:20:46] Yeah, it is true. The land is there but
[1:20:48] it has the owners
[1:20:54] and it made people's heart
[1:21:00] that we have giants.
[1:21:04] Yeah.
[1:21:06] Now if they are giants how are we going
[1:21:08] to do it?
[1:21:11] then I would rather stay here.
[1:21:16] But what was the promise? A cross.
[1:21:20] Yes, Lord. Where? What is a cross? Every
[1:21:23] promise raised in that.
[1:21:28] Now, God wanted these people, the
[1:21:31] children of Israel, to go to a place
[1:21:34] they could call theirs.
[1:21:37] Amen.
[1:21:43] a place they could call theirs.
[1:21:49] If you are in a foreign place, you don't
[1:21:51] feel comfortable.
[1:21:53] Even when somebody coughs, you say they
[1:21:55] are talking about me.
[1:22:00] Yeah.
[1:22:01] But when you are in a place that is
[1:22:04] called yours,
[1:22:07] Yeah. Yes. Oh my. The Bible says every
[1:22:12] footprint
[1:22:14] is your possession.
[1:22:16] Yeah. Can we walk around?
[1:22:21] Yeah. And see our possession.
[1:22:25] Oh, this is mine.
[1:22:27] Healing is mine. Deliverance is mine.
[1:22:32] Oh, joy is mine. Peace is mine. Oh,
[1:22:36] hallelujah. Praise God. This is mine.
[1:22:41] You can claim it.
[1:22:47] Oh my. I love it.
[1:22:52] Amen.
[1:22:54] Now you need a guide.
[1:23:00] You can't make it on your own
[1:23:05] in this journey. You can't make it on
[1:23:07] your own.
[1:23:10] You need a guide. Yes, Lord. What is the
[1:23:14] kind? The prophet says, uh,
[1:23:19] a guide. And the Holy Spirit always
[1:23:22] speaks of the word. I've got many things
[1:23:25] to tell you. You cannot understand it
[1:23:28] now. But when he comes, he will guide
[1:23:31] you to it. That is the reason the coming
[1:23:34] of the seals.
[1:23:38] You didn't get it.
[1:23:42] Hello.
[1:23:44] We said in this journey, you need a
[1:23:47] guide
[1:23:49] because you cannot make it on your own.
[1:23:53] Now, who is the guide? The prophet says,
[1:23:56] "I've got many things to tell you. You
[1:23:59] cannot understand it now. But when he
[1:24:02] comes, he will kite you to eat. That is
[1:24:05] the reason the coming of the seals. At
[1:24:08] the finishing of the seventh seal, the
[1:24:11] mystery of God should be finished to
[1:24:14] know who God is,
[1:24:17] what he is, how he lives, his nature,
[1:24:23] his being. You are supposed to be way
[1:24:26] all the way up here by that time. see to
[1:24:30] bring us into the full stature of sons
[1:24:34] and daughters of God. A church that is
[1:24:37] washed in the blood of Christ that has
[1:24:40] been bought without money is paid for by
[1:24:43] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:24:46] We are supposed to be way up here. Help
[1:24:50] us, Lord.
[1:24:57] Where are we?
[1:25:00] Where are we?
[1:25:03] Yeah.
[1:25:07] Are we going to be the two
[1:25:11] Joshua and Khal or we are going to be
[1:25:14] the eight?
[1:25:17] Your life can give a false report.
[1:25:24] Yeah.
[1:25:29] Can you preach with me?
[1:25:33] Yeah.
[1:25:35] Your life
[1:25:37] can give a false report
[1:25:41] by saying that okay the lad is there but
[1:25:44] we have giants.
[1:25:50] Can we be the two?
[1:25:53] Hallelujah. Say we are looking at the
[1:25:55] promise.
[1:25:57] The promise is the land is ours.
[1:26:01] The land is ours. That is the promise.
[1:26:04] Amen. So no matter the circumstances.
[1:26:12] The land is the land is ours.
[1:26:17] May God take away the spiritual
[1:26:19] ammunition.
[1:26:22] May God just take away the spiritual
[1:26:24] amnesia from me
[1:26:26] so that I can come to a point to claim
[1:26:29] my promises.
[1:26:33] Amen. God help us.
[1:26:39] Oh my. Paragraph 36. The prophet says
[1:26:43] that is in slite number seven. This
[1:26:45] guide knows the way. He knows every inch
[1:26:49] of the way.
[1:26:54] He knows every thought that is in your
[1:26:57] heart. He knows everybody that is here.
[1:27:05] He knows all about you.
[1:27:08] He's God's guide, the Holy Spirit.
[1:27:12] Hallelujah. And will reveal these things
[1:27:14] to you and will tell you things that
[1:27:17] he's he will tell you things that he has
[1:27:20] heard. Can repeat your words right back
[1:27:23] and say what you said. Amen.
[1:27:28] Yes, Lord. You can't do without a guide.
[1:27:33] What is the guide? The Holy Spirit.
[1:27:37] He knows the way.
[1:27:41] He can fight for you.
[1:27:44] Hallelujah. He can guide you.
[1:27:48] He knows your thoughts.
[1:27:50] He knows your imaginations.
[1:27:54] He knows all your failures.
[1:27:57] And he makes a way for you. Hallelujah.
[1:28:00] Thank you, Jesus. He provides even what
[1:28:03] what you don't know that you need.
[1:28:05] Jesus.
[1:28:07] Praise the Lord. He knows the way. He
[1:28:10] knows you. He knows you by your name.
[1:28:18] God give us a kite to lead us to cross
[1:28:21] Jordan
[1:28:23] the coming of the seals. Don't you ever
[1:28:26] take a substitute.
[1:28:30] Don't Don't take a substitute.
[1:28:37] Sometimes Substitute sometimes can be
[1:28:39] good.
[1:28:41] Let me just take this.
[1:28:45] Now if you have been promised the real
[1:28:47] thing, why should you take a substitute?
[1:28:49] Amen.
[1:28:53] Yeah.
[1:28:55] I I I like some people are saying okay
[1:28:58] even in medical field
[1:29:01] I say generics
[1:29:04] and brand.
[1:29:09] Yeah. Then they put the two of them
[1:29:14] there generic and the brand.
[1:29:19] Then he said okay I'll just take the
[1:29:22] generic one.
[1:29:27] If it is on on the account of the price,
[1:29:29] fine. But if it has been paid for, why
[1:29:32] should you take the substitute?
[1:29:36] Take the brand.
[1:29:38] And we have been promised the brand.
[1:29:43] Let's take the brand.
[1:29:45] May I go by the brand name?
[1:29:49] Oh my.
[1:29:51] Amen.
[1:29:55] Jordan was a point of separation
[1:29:59] and across Jordan only the predestinated
[1:30:04] were to end there to end there.
[1:30:07] Only the predestinated.
[1:30:10] Why? Because they had a representation.
[1:30:15] Hallelujah.
[1:30:18] Yes, sir.
[1:30:21] Yes, Lord.
[1:30:22] The prophet says
[1:30:25] the woman at the well, she had a
[1:30:28] representation.
[1:30:31] So when she met with Jesus and he
[1:30:34] discerned her, she said, "You must be
[1:30:36] the Messiah."
[1:30:38] Now here comes the priests. Yeah. They
[1:30:41] are also discerned and they say, "You
[1:30:43] are being set up." Why? Because they
[1:30:46] didn't have the representation.
[1:30:48] Now what is our representation?
[1:30:52] It is your representation that makes you
[1:30:55] say amen to the word. It is your
[1:30:58] representation that gives you an
[1:31:00] assurance that you are bound for the
[1:31:02] promised land. It is your
[1:31:04] representation. You are hearing from
[1:31:06] your representation.
[1:31:09] Glory.
[1:31:11] Your representation.
[1:31:14] What is your representation? You are
[1:31:15] theophony.
[1:31:17] Amen. It is your representation. Yes,
[1:31:20] Lord. God help us. May God open my eyes.
[1:31:26] Yeah. Hallelujah. And my heart. Glory.
[1:31:30] Yes. To hear from my representation.
[1:31:34] Oh my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now when
[1:31:39] Jesus came on earth
[1:31:42] they reached at the cross at Kadesh
[1:31:44] Paneera where a decision was to be made
[1:31:47] either to cross into the land of grace
[1:31:49] or to remain in the law.
[1:31:53] I'll leave that one to sink first.
[1:31:57] He brought the dispensation of grace but
[1:32:00] people loved the law.
[1:32:04] We believe the law of Moses.
[1:32:07] Yeah.
[1:32:09] So they rejected grace,
[1:32:13] cru crucified grace
[1:32:15] because of the law.
[1:32:18] Yeah. And it can also happen with us.
[1:32:24] Yeah.
[1:32:26] We come to a point where we reject the
[1:32:29] leadership of the Holy Spirit. Yeah. I
[1:32:33] me just remain here.
[1:32:40] God have mercy on us.
[1:32:44] Now we have also stood before Jordan.
[1:32:50] Either we cross over
[1:32:53] or we remain.
[1:32:56] Remember about the two/3s and the other
[1:32:59] a third. Yes. The two
[1:33:03] is healing ministry and prophesying or
[1:33:07] discernment. We can reach there
[1:33:11] and refuse to move and remain there. But
[1:33:15] the promise is let us go over
[1:33:20] where all things are possible.
[1:33:23] Where you speak the word and God packs
[1:33:26] it. Amen. The speaking condition, the
[1:33:30] third pool.
[1:33:32] Lord, so the promise is the third pool.
[1:33:36] Amen.
[1:33:38] Hallelujah.
[1:33:40] Yes, Lord. Lord,
[1:33:48] God help us.
[1:33:50] So the question is will you be one of
[1:33:53] the two Joshua and Kip or among the
[1:33:56] eight?
[1:34:00] Hello.
[1:34:02] You're quiet.
[1:34:06] We need to answer.
[1:34:08] Will you
[1:34:11] Will you be the two Joshua and
[1:34:15] the eight?
[1:34:20] Yeah.
[1:34:22] Joshua and they looked at the promise.
[1:34:27] Amen. The promise was Ghana.
[1:34:32] God had met the promise. So they looked
[1:34:35] at the promise. Hallelujah.
[1:34:39] Oh my God help us.
[1:34:46] Now
[1:34:48] when the prophet declared the message of
[1:34:52] the present stage of my ministry.
[1:34:57] Yeah. That's when he was rejected.
[1:35:03] Now when he was rejected that is when
[1:35:06] the word came into effect.
[1:35:10] Just like Jesus Christ or the sacrifice
[1:35:16] of the lamb, it was okay until that day
[1:35:21] when Jesus was crucified. When the word
[1:35:24] was crucified, then all the other
[1:35:27] substitutes they became they were
[1:35:29] rendered
[1:35:31] useless.
[1:35:33] Why? The ministry had changed.
[1:35:37] grace had stepped in.
[1:35:43] Hello.
[1:35:45] Now when denominations rejected the
[1:35:47] word,
[1:35:49] hello. When denominations rejected the
[1:35:53] word,
[1:35:54] then that's when the word took effect.
[1:35:58] And the word that took effect, that is
[1:36:00] now our promise. Amen. Once you enter
[1:36:05] into that word
[1:36:07] inside there is perfection.
[1:36:21] outside that that word
[1:36:25] you have rejected your atonement.
[1:36:30] Let me enter inside.
[1:36:33] Let me enter inside.
[1:36:36] Let me cross over. L. Let me not just
[1:36:39] stand on the banks of Jordan and just
[1:36:42] cast a wishful eye. Oh, this is good.
[1:36:48] It does not help you.
[1:36:51] Yeah,
[1:36:53] it does not help you
[1:36:58] possess it.
[1:37:02] And that's what we have been called for
[1:37:04] to possess it.
[1:37:07] Claim it.
[1:37:09] I want my mountain.
[1:37:12] Give me my mountain. Healing is my
[1:37:16] mountain. Deliverance is my mountain.
[1:37:19] Joy is my mountain. I want my mountain.
[1:37:22] Give me my mountain this morning as I'm
[1:37:25] seated here. Give Lord give me my
[1:37:27] mountain. I want my portion. I want the
[1:37:31] portion of my inheritance. Amen.
[1:37:36] I wish we can come to that point. Amen.
[1:37:40] Then it will be different.
[1:37:42] We will be different. The work for the
[1:37:45] pastor will be easier.
[1:37:49] I'm not advocating for you but I'm
[1:37:51] saying if you enter inside if we all
[1:37:54] enter inside there
[1:37:58] you take your position we will not even
[1:38:01] need a deacon to show you where to sit
[1:38:04] [Laughter]
[1:38:07] because you have taken your position
[1:38:10] in the promised land
[1:38:14] oh My
[1:38:18] in the message indictment.
[1:38:24] Oh my. I that should be slide number
[1:38:26] eight. Now and Christ is God's provided
[1:38:29] lamp. Notice how appropriate it was now
[1:38:33] showing that that Jerusalem was ceasing
[1:38:36] when it was in effect until that hour.
[1:38:40] The plot of lamp was all right until
[1:38:43] that day. But now at the crucifixion it
[1:38:47] changes. The old system is done.
[1:38:52] Yes sir. Yeah.
[1:38:55] So we need to differentiate the old
[1:38:57] system and the new system. Yes Lord.
[1:39:01] Lord
[1:39:02] the new system is opening of the word.
[1:39:07] Hallelujah.
[1:39:10] When the word was opened, the prophet
[1:39:12] says the Bible became a new book.
[1:39:24] Amen.
[1:39:25] Oh God be blessed for seeing this
[1:39:28] wonderful heavenly light in this last
[1:39:31] day because the churches is doing the
[1:39:34] same thing today until the hour that
[1:39:37] organization religion is condemned and
[1:39:40] proved to be sacrifying sacrificing
[1:39:43] Christ's word from then on comes the
[1:39:47] word and the word only
[1:39:50] hallelujah
[1:39:55] When you accept this word fully, you
[1:39:58] have closed your

[1:40:29] Okay.
[1:40:31] When you accept this word fully,
[1:40:36] when you accept it fully
[1:40:39] and the prophet says full obedience to
[1:40:43] the whole world
[1:40:46] entitles you to the
[1:40:48] talking
[1:40:50] full obedience not just obedience.
[1:40:57] Yeah.
[1:40:59] We can just be coming here because we
[1:41:02] are obedient. But it's not just being
[1:41:04] obedient
[1:41:06] is full obedience.
[1:41:09] God help me. Help us Lord. Help us.
[1:41:16] Children is a separation is a crossing
[1:41:19] point where a decision is a decision
[1:41:22] point where you die to yourself. Your
[1:41:25] old husband is dead and parried. Amen.
[1:41:33] Know that you are keeping him somewhere.
[1:41:38] He's dead. and
[1:41:43] I like that song where
[1:41:46] which says he died to make men holy.
[1:41:50] Let us die to make men free.
[1:41:55] If I can die, I will set people free.
[1:42:00] Yeah. I might be holding people.
[1:42:03] God help me.
[1:42:06] Let me die. That's not what you need.
[1:42:08] Yeah.
[1:42:11] If we can take time.
[1:42:14] Yeah.
[1:42:16] You can make an altar
[1:42:19] even where you are. Yes. And say, Lord,
[1:42:23] I don't want to leave this place at
[1:42:27] a Yeah.

[1:42:33] Let me die to my imaginations.
[1:42:36] Amen. Help me father. Let me die
[1:42:39] so that people can see Christ.
[1:42:44] Let me die so that people can see
[1:42:47] Christ.
[1:42:51] Help us.
[1:42:54] Across children is where the fullness of
[1:42:58] Godhead dwells.
[1:43:03] No, you didn't see it.
[1:43:07] Yeah,
[1:43:09] don't look for it in the notes
[1:43:12] in the course is Yeah, we we will come
[1:43:14] to it. We are going to come to it.
[1:43:17] Every statement I must have a quote to
[1:43:20] support it.
[1:43:22] Okay. So, a cross children is where the
[1:43:25] fullness of Godhead blys.
[1:43:30] Yeah.
[1:43:32] Jesus Christ. Yeah. In him dwelt the
[1:43:38] fullness of the codhead body.
[1:43:42] Amen. Yes, sir. Hello.
[1:43:47] In him dwelt the fullness of the codhead
[1:43:52] bodily.
[1:43:54] Now
[1:43:56] let's come closer home.
[1:43:59] Jesus was born by Mary
[1:44:03] and for 30 years he was just a normal
[1:44:06] person.
[1:44:10] Yeah.
[1:44:11] He could just help Joseph in the
[1:44:14] carpenter. Oh, hold here. Oh, hold do
[1:44:17] this. Do this. He was just a normal
[1:44:19] person.
[1:44:21] But when
[1:44:24] he was baptized
[1:44:28] Yeah. And a voice spoke
[1:44:31] and said this.
[1:44:37] In whom
[1:44:39] I'm pleased.
[1:44:42] Can he say he's pleased to dwell in you?
[1:44:49] So in him the fullness of the court
[1:44:53] headquarter came.
[1:44:58] Yeah. Hello.
[1:45:03] God help us.
[1:45:05] Yeah.
[1:45:07] Then who are we?
[1:45:11] Are we Christlike?
[1:45:15] What was that that came into Jesus?
[1:45:19] Was John 1:1?
[1:45:23] Yeah.
[1:45:28] Let me talk allow me to talk about
[1:45:30] representation
[1:45:32] for the few minutes as I try to
[1:45:34] conclude. Yeah. Yeah. For those who are
[1:45:36] praying that I finish, God has has
[1:45:39] answered your prayer. So
[1:45:42] yeah. Now Jesus Christ said that before
[1:45:48] Abraham was I am
[1:45:53] but he was not yet born.
[1:45:57] Who was this that said before Abraham
[1:46:01] was I am
[1:46:03] it was the representation
[1:46:05] and it is that representation is that
[1:46:08] pillar of fire.
[1:46:11] Yeah. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:18] Allow me to expound on it. Amen. Yeah.
[1:46:22] Yes, sir.
[1:46:24] The one who said before Abraham was I
[1:46:26] am, it was not Jesus that was born by
[1:46:30] Mary. Amen.
[1:46:35] Yeah. Right.
[1:46:37] It was the Jesus that came on Mount
[1:46:39] Sunset
[1:46:42] and the picture was taken.
[1:46:45] Yeah.
[1:46:46] In our generation they say he took a
[1:46:49] selfie. He came to take a selfie
[1:46:53] with a pride.
[1:46:56] Yeah.
[1:46:59] That was now the John 1 one.
[1:47:04] Now what happens
[1:47:07] John the John chapter one verse14 the
[1:47:11] word now became flesh
[1:47:15] but today flesh is becoming the word so
[1:47:20] we can say today
[1:47:23] John 1:1 is in me
[1:47:26] that is what I've received
[1:47:29] that is the Jesus I have received
[1:47:32] that is the Jesus I don't want to
[1:47:34] identify with the Jesus the the body
[1:47:36] that was crucified, right?
[1:47:39] But that representation, yes. Amen. That
[1:47:43] was the word,
[1:47:47] that was the word that came in the Jesus
[1:47:50] of Nazareth. Amen.
[1:47:56] Then he could say, I and my father are
[1:48:00] one.
[1:48:04] When he said I and my father are one,
[1:48:10] they took STS.
[1:48:12] They wanted to beat him up.
[1:48:16] Then he asked them, "Of the good works
[1:48:20] that I have done, which one do you do
[1:48:22] you want to to beat me with four?"
[1:48:26] Then he said, they said, "Of the good
[1:48:28] works, we have no problem." Yeah.
[1:48:34] When we are hungry, we come to him. You
[1:48:36] mad.
[1:48:39] That is good work. By the way, we need
[1:48:41] it.
[1:48:43] Yeah.
[1:48:46] When we are sick, you heal us. Those are
[1:48:49] the good works.
[1:48:52] Yeah. If one of us dies, you resurrect.
[1:48:57] That is good works.
[1:48:59] But where you say you and your father
[1:49:02] you want to make yourself go
[1:49:07] that is where we differ with you.
[1:49:13] If today
[1:49:15] if let me say me if I can come to a
[1:49:18] point where I can say I and my father
[1:49:20] are one.
[1:49:23] I wonder how many believers here will be
[1:49:26] my friends.
[1:49:31] As long as we point to the Jesus of
[1:49:33] Nazareth, people have no problem
[1:49:36] because it is history. I always say
[1:49:38] history, everybody's a believer.
[1:49:45] We are all believers 100%.
[1:49:50] But when it comes to the present tense,
[1:49:57] That's why the prophet preached a sermon
[1:49:59] which he called lifting him out of
[1:50:02] history.
[1:50:04] If we can lift him out of history and
[1:50:08] make him yesterday, today, and forever
[1:50:12] the same.
[1:50:18] Oh my.
[1:50:24] Those who entered that land had their
[1:50:26] representation in that land before by
[1:50:29] predestination and for knowledge of God.
[1:50:32] Hallelujah. Praise God. Sir,
[1:50:40] slide nine.
[1:50:45] Paragraph 311. Now you see what coming
[1:50:48] down to Jordan meant. We are down here.
[1:50:51] Now let's cross over now. Let's quit
[1:50:55] playing. Let's cross the other side now
[1:50:58] cuz it all belongs to us. It is all
[1:51:01] ours. Them visions has never failed.
[1:51:04] They can't fail because they come from
[1:51:07] God. I believe it with all that is
[1:51:09] within me. We are not the hering that
[1:51:12] will run back back into the wilderness
[1:51:16] into the wilderness. We will cross
[1:51:18] Jordan. the separation. God break to us
[1:51:22] the sins that's on the back of the book.
[1:51:26] Let us enter into this great place now.
[1:51:31] Yes, Lord. Amen. Help us, Lord Jesus.
[1:51:35] Let us enter. Amen.
[1:51:40] Oh yes. Talking about representation,
[1:51:44] the next paragraph 3 312. And if you
[1:51:48] notice those Hebrew mothers when they
[1:51:50] was in leper and gave path to those to
[1:51:53] those patriots, I will get on that one
[1:51:56] of these days, the Lord willing, and
[1:51:58] gave path to those patriots when she
[1:52:01] spoke in in when she spoke their name in
[1:52:04] labor, she also positionally placed them
[1:52:07] in their place in the kingdom.
[1:52:11] Talk about princess nation.
[1:52:18] Your position was spoke by the word.
[1:52:22] Hallelujah.
[1:52:25] So, you only need to say Lord, give me
[1:52:28] my portion. Lord,
[1:52:32] give me my portion. Hallelujah. If we
[1:52:35] can enter in now and claim our portions,
[1:52:39] will be different.
[1:52:43] But as long as we stand on the banks,
[1:52:45] oh, it's a good Lord. Yeah, it's a good
[1:52:48] Lord.
[1:52:51] Don't help us.
[1:52:54] Let us cross over.
[1:52:56] Are we ready?
[1:52:59] Oh my.
[1:53:04] Crossing children is not playing church.
[1:53:08] The headship and the revelation of the
[1:53:10] son of man belongs to us.
[1:53:14] It is the seals that ushers us into the
[1:53:18] promised land.
[1:53:21] Slide number 10 in the message. It's the
[1:53:24] rising of the sun. He is the one who
[1:53:27] opened those seals. He is those seals.
[1:53:30] For the whole word of God is Christ and
[1:53:33] Christ is the seals that was opened.
[1:53:36] What is the opening of the seals? Then
[1:53:38] revealing Christ. Amen.
[1:53:46] When the seals are opened, then Jordan
[1:53:48] is open. The door is opened and it's
[1:53:51] also your destination.
[1:53:55] Hallelujah. So you can enter in. Lord
[1:53:58] now start claiming your possession.
[1:54:02] Every footprint is your possession.
[1:54:05] Healing is mine.
[1:54:07] Joy is mine. Deliverance is mine.
[1:54:12] Oh, give me my mountain.
[1:54:15] Give me my mountain. Let me not leave
[1:54:18] this place until I receive my mountain.
[1:54:22] I want to claim my mountain. Lord, I'll
[1:54:25] remain here until I receive my mountain.
[1:54:31] Oh my.
[1:54:34] God help us.
[1:54:36] Okay,
[1:54:38] I read this.
[1:54:40] I'm looking at the clock. I don't want
[1:54:43] to keep you for so long.
[1:54:48] Still slide number 10. The prophet says
[1:54:50] notice like this when a baby is born
[1:54:53] there is three things that constitutes
[1:54:56] its birth. The first thing is normal
[1:54:58] birth. You adults listen close. Now the
[1:55:02] young children will never catch it. But
[1:55:05] let's see the first thing in a normal
[1:55:06] birth is water then blood then life. Now
[1:55:10] that is the same thing that constitutes
[1:55:12] the new birth. Water, blood and spirit.
[1:55:16] The elements that came from his body is
[1:55:19] what makes his body.
[1:55:23] No, you didn't get it.
[1:55:27] Yeah. The elements that came from his
[1:55:31] body is what makes his body.
[1:55:35] Yeah. It come from his body. Amen.
[1:55:41] Yeah.
[1:55:42] No, you are not catching it.
[1:55:47] [Laughter]
[1:55:52] The elements that came from him, they
[1:55:55] are the ones that makes his body.
[1:55:59] Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. No, you
[1:56:03] are not getting it.
[1:56:07] Yeah. The elements that came from him,
[1:56:11] they are the ones that makes his body.
[1:56:14] What am I trying to say? Yeah. The
[1:56:17] elements that came from Jesus, the
[1:56:19] bridegroom, they are the ones that made
[1:56:21] the bride.
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:25] Yes, Lord.
[1:56:27] Oh my glory to God.
[1:56:31] Christ has his pride taken from the
[1:56:34] body. And when Christ died, there was
[1:56:37] three elements that came from his body.
[1:56:40] Water, blood, and spirit. Justification
[1:56:43] through believing, believing, believing
[1:56:46] water, sanctification through the blood,
[1:56:48] then baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:56:52] Now this last great step must come into
[1:56:56] the perfection.
[1:57:00] Hallelujah. Oh my. The promised land is
[1:57:05] a land of perfection where the head and
[1:57:08] the body are united.
[1:57:11] When the union takes place, we can
[1:57:14] declare that we have reached perfection.
[1:57:18] [Music]
[1:57:21] Oh my gosh.
[1:57:25] Okay.
[1:57:28] Okay.
[1:57:33] Wish I had time to
[1:57:36] this song. We talk about the buland.
[1:57:40] Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Bandandh.
[1:57:47] You can check the definition of the word
[1:57:49] pa land.
[1:57:51] Yeah,
[1:57:54] I was trying to get there different
[1:57:56] definitions but I landed on this one. Is
[1:57:59] a land of marriage between the headship
[1:58:02] of Jesus and the body, the bride making
[1:58:05] the two one.
[1:58:11] Yeah.
[1:58:15] God help us.
[1:58:18] Slide number 11. Heavenly Father, we
[1:58:21] come in the name of the rock.
[1:58:24] The rock is a weary land, the shelter in
[1:58:27] a time of storm. We pray, oh Lord God,
[1:58:31] that the rock will overshadow us with
[1:58:34] his power and mercy that every sick
[1:58:37] person in here may be healed today. May
[1:58:41] they speak to the rock. Amen.
[1:58:46] If you are sick, speak to the rock. If
[1:58:50] you need deliverance, speak to the rock.
[1:58:54] Whatever you need, speak to the rock.
[1:58:57] As you are seated there, you can speak
[1:58:59] to the to the rock.
[1:59:01] Oh Lord, there there are men and women
[1:59:04] sitting here suffering with cancer. Some
[1:59:06] of them blind, some crippled. Oh, the
[1:59:09] doctor says there is no hope for them.
[1:59:11] Then let them speak to the rock now.
[1:59:15] Oh, Moses without hope. There was in the
[1:59:17] wilderness where no water was, but they
[1:59:20] spoke to the rock. And the rock came
[1:59:23] forth a casher, and they all drank and
[1:59:26] they lived. Lord God, may we drink from
[1:59:29] that fountain today that never runs dry.
[1:59:33] Oh, in this biola land of salvation
[1:59:37] where we have been called out of Egypt's
[1:59:40] carics and ski stink pots into this
[1:59:43] great wonderful place where it is ba
[1:59:47] land where the rock lays eating angels
[1:59:51] food and drinking from the mountain that
[1:59:54] never runs dry.
[1:59:57] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:00:00] Yes,
[2:00:02] we can enter in
[2:00:05] and claim our promises. Amen.
[2:00:08] Oh my. Speak to the rock. If you are
[2:00:12] sick, speak to the rock. If the doctor
[2:00:14] says, "I can't do no more for you," then
[2:00:17] speak to the rock. If the church says,
[2:00:19] "If you shout in my church, I will turn
[2:00:22] you out," then speak to the rock. If the
[2:00:25] denomination wants to excommunicate you,
[2:00:27] speak to the rock. Amen. When death
[2:00:30] comes stealing in your room, speak to
[2:00:33] the rock. He will make a way and divide
[2:00:36] the waters of Jordan as he did for them.
[2:00:39] And you will walk over on dry land.
[2:00:42] Speak to the rock.
[2:00:45] Oh, you know what I think, friends? I
[2:00:47] think that's here where this is in
[2:00:50] Exodus 13:21. The Lord went before them
[2:00:54] by day, by day in a pillar of cloud, and
[2:00:59] by night in a pillar of fire. He's
[2:01:03] leading us today.
[2:01:06] Amen. He's leading us today. Lord, where
[2:01:11] to cross into perfection?
[2:01:15] Where all things are possible.
[2:01:20] Amen.
[2:01:33] And with a reverend sincere heart, I
[2:01:36] believe that thus the same angel of God
[2:01:39] that led Israel out of Egypt to the
[2:01:41] promised land in the natural is leading
[2:01:44] us to the promised land today. And that
[2:01:47] angel is here. Amen.
[2:01:50] Oh, for in my father's house are many
[2:01:52] merions. I will go and prepare a place
[2:01:54] for you. And I believe the angel of the
[2:01:57] Lord is leading the church today. And
[2:01:59] it's the same Holy Spirit. And anyone
[2:02:01] knows the angel of the covenant was
[2:02:03] Christ. Amen. I might be counted in with
[2:02:06] you. But the angel of the Lord is not
[2:02:10] just to me. It is to all of you. The
[2:02:13] angel of the Lord is here. Amen. Amen.
[2:02:18] We can speak to him.
[2:02:22] You can speak to him. I can speak to
[2:02:25] him.
[2:02:34] I can speak to him.
[2:02:37] Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:43] [Music]
[2:02:49] Thank you for
[2:02:52] the Lord praise offering this morning.
[2:02:55] Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for the
[2:02:57] word that has been brought to us. Can
[2:02:58] you say amen? Hallelujah. Amen. Thank
[2:03:01] you, Lord Jesus. It is evening time.
[2:03:06] That's what we'll say. It's evening
[2:03:07] time.
[2:03:10] It's later than you think.
[2:03:13] We've got to move on with God. Can you
[2:03:16] say amen? We can't just stand and look
[2:03:18] across Jordan say, "Oh, what a mighty,
[2:03:21] wonderful land it is."
[2:03:23] What if we don't cross over? We won't
[2:03:26] make it. We got to keep moving on. Amen.
[2:03:29] Let's sing that together.
[2:03:39] It's
[2:03:41] [Music]
[2:03:43] the bride is preparing now
[2:03:48] for the Lord to meet.
[2:03:52] All things are ready now.
[2:03:56] The bridegroom are here.
[2:04:01] and that heaven
[2:04:03] to
[2:04:05] the evening time
[2:04:08] is here.
[2:04:10] Amen. Let's just pray together. Lord
[2:04:12] Jesus,
[2:04:14] this morning we're so grateful,
[2:04:18] oh Lord, for the third pull message.
[2:04:22] Lord, we want to enter into that word of
[2:04:25] God and become part of that word.
[2:04:28] Lord, if we're not already there, Lord,
[2:04:30] we need to enter in. Lord, we have to
[2:04:34] change. Lord, there the move is on, Lord

[2:04:40] this morning may move on with Jesus
[2:04:43] Christ,

[2:04:52] land, but Lord, we need to enter in and
[2:04:55] claim every promise of God.
[2:04:59] Lord, that every sickness would be
[2:05:01] healed, Lord, that deliverance would be
[2:05:04] ours, Lord Jesus. We thank you, Lord.
