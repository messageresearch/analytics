Sermon: “Looking Past the Curtain of Time" on Sunday, November 23rd, 2025
Brother Gideon Gunawan

Summary of the Sermon: "Looking Past the Curtain of Time"

In this sermon, Brother Gideon begins with Exodus 26:31–34, explaining the purpose of the veil that separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place in Israel’s tabernacle.

He uses this Old Testament picture to introduce the central theme: learning to look “past the curtain of time”—to see beyond earthly limitations and into God’s eternal realm. Just as the tabernacle’s outer badger-skin covering hid the beauty within, he likens believers to ordinary-looking vessels on the outside, yet covered inwardly by the blood of Jesus Christ, represented in the ram’s skin dyed red (Genesis 22). Brother Gideon reminds the congregation that while people see weakness and humanity, God sees the redeemed soul behind the veil, marked by Christ’s own blood.

The sermon then moves to contrast the Holy Place, which depended on man’s continual service—fresh incense, fresh bread, an attended lampstand—with the Most Holy Place, where the manna stayed fresh supernaturally and the light never dimmed. This difference becomes a lesson about time vs. eternity: human effort grows stale, but what is behind God’s veil never ages or weakens.

Then Brother Gideon reminds us that when Jesus died, the veil was torn (Matthew 27:50–51), giving every believer personal access to God’s glory, not just once a year like the high priest. He quotes Hebrews 9, showing that Christ entered the heavenly tabernacle “once for all” with His own blood, accomplishing what animal sacrifices never could—the transformation of the believer’s nature.

Much of the message highlights Brother Branham’s teachings about the realms beyond time, including the testimony of his experience in “Beyond the Curtain of Time,” where he saw believers in a youthful, perfected state filled with perfect love. The preacher connects th...

Exodus chapter 26 verse 31 reads, "And thou shalt," sorry, I'll I'll hear the rustling, so it's not the rustling of the malberry bush. Maybe I trust it is. Amen. Exodus chapter 26. Are we there? Amen. Verse 31. And thou shalt make a veil of blue and purple and scarlet and fine twine linen of cunning work with cherubam shall it be made. And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shitwood overlaid with gold. Their hooks shall be of gold upon the four sockets of silver. And thou shalt hang up the veil under the tashes or that thou mayest bring in thither within the veil the ark of the testimony. And the veil shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. I'd like to speak to you this morning and title it looking past the curtain of time. Now, Amen. Just to lay a little bit of a foundation for this thought, you know, curtains are used for many things. You know, don't just think of curtains as a as a piece of decor, but it is used for that. You know, sisters will you don't just put up any old thing on in your house, right? Amen. To cover your windows or for decoration. You're you're you're interested in the color and the design and things. But it's not only for that. Curtains are sometimes used to, Amen. be a barrier, to be something to protect. Amen. To give privacy, right? Amen. You don't want just any old person to look into your house or look through your window. So, you put a curtain there. Are you with me? Amen. And you know, it kind of reminds me of of of um how many remember the old Calder Church? Who remember been I know I know the W Amen. have been there and brother Dan and brother Ziggs. So this this picture will bring back some memories. I hope you can see it here. But and I think Sister Wendy's right there. Amen. Right there. Right here. Just so I think right right here and I I was trying to Brother Ralph Claus is here. Brother Ed Hammeister, I think. And so anyways, I just thought that would be nostalgic. But you remember the red curtain, right? Right. So, I'm speaking about curtains, but my pastor's brother Jerry and I remember him telling the testimony when he come, he always wondered what's behind that curtain because when he first come to the to to to Alberta um and his brother, brother Ken Fury had witnessed to him, he thought brother Ken had joined a cult, right? And so he thought, "What is behind that curtain? Maybe it's behind that curtain is a picture of William Brandham." And all of a sudden, it'll open and everyone will start worshiping that picture. But you know what? It wasn't there wasn't nothing behind there. I think just a whiteboard, right? So the mystery was there there there was just a whiteboard behind there. But I'm talking about curtains. I'm just loosening you up here. Amen. But there's curtains can be used to close out light. Curtains can be used to dampen noise or to block off noise from outside. Are you with me this morning? There we're talking about the curtain of time. But you know in in in Exodus chapter 26, Amen. God begin to give directions on the tabernacle in the wilderness. And how many know that it was actually comprised of curtains? Amen. And just bear with me as we as we lay a foundation here. But in Exodus 26, it says, "Moreover, thou shalt make the tabernacle with 10 curtains of fine twine linen and blue and purple and scarlet. What cherubams of cunning work shalt thou make them?" In verse 7, "Thou shalt make curtains of goats hair." And so we see all these curtains in the tabernacle um in ch in verse 12. and the remnant that remainth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remainth shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle. Verse 14, and thou shalt make a covering for the tent of ramkins dyed red, and a covering above of badger skins. Now, just think, friends, all that was visible, amen, to the naked eye, or if you were to be looking at it even as an outsider, amen, to look at that tabernacle, all you would see would be badger skins. That's right. Ain't that the truth, friends? Amen. People come in here, friends this morning, maybe visitors, all they would maybe see to their natural eye would be badger skins. And you realize, friends, that badgers were the meanest Amen. meanest animal ever. Amen. They were aggressive. They were mean. They were backbiters. They fight. That's right. Come on now, friends. Amen. That's what you were, friends. Amen. You You fought You fought the word. You fought your brother. You fought your sister. You fought the pastor. That's why those badgers had to die. Before they could be part of the temple, they had to die. Come on now. Hallelujah. But that was on the outside, friends. But I'm thankful on the outside. But underneath that, friends, was ramkin dyed red. Woo. Glory be to God. Amen. Amen. All the world sees is, oh, they're just just as human as I am. They get angry like I do. They get sad like I do. They go through things like I do. That's the truth, friends. But underneath that, friends, is ram's ram's skin dyed red. They don't see the blood. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. There's a blood. Amen. That covers us, friends. Oh, on the outside it looks like we get tired. We get weary. We Amen. We go through things. How many is going through things? Amen. But friends, Amen. underneath that, friends, we are covered by the blood. How many know friends that the ram amen spoke of Jesus Christ? Amen. He was the ram. Amen. When when Abraham took Isaac up to Mount Mariah there, friends, and Isaac said, "Follow there." Amen. Here's the wood. Here's the fire. But where's where's where's the sacrifice? He said, "God will provide himself a sacrifice. He will provide for him. He will provide himself. A sacrifice." And when they got up there, what was Amen. up there caught in that thicket was a ram, a type of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Friends, I'm thankful for that covering, friends. Amen. We can we can sing this morning. I am covered. Covered. Covered by his blood. Jesus rescued me. Oh, glory. Amen. That's the curtain I want over my soul. Hallelujah. When he sees the blood. Friends, the devil can't even see that. That's why he accuses you day and night. Day and night. They did this, she did that. Didn't you see when they spoke wrong, didn't you see when they thought wrong? And and God begins to look at the record. But Jesus took his own blood and wrote, "Pardon. Oh, glory. Now, watch this as we just continue on. And thou shalt make a veil of blue and purple and scarlet. So, amen. There was curtains that covered the tabernacle. But really, the curtain that I want to focus on this morning is that curtain that was between the holy place and the most holy place. Now, watch. They saying, "Fine twin lin and a cunning work with cherubam shall it be made. And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shidamwood overlaid with gold. Their hook shall be of gold upon the four sockets of silver. And thou shalt hang up the veil under the thou mayest bring in thither within the veil the ark of the testimony and the veil shall divide unto you. Now watch this. That curtain, that veil was a dividing line between the holy place and the most holy place. Hallelujah. Amen. It was acting as a barrier, friends, to the mercy seat. It hid the ark of the covenant. It hid the golden pot. Amen. That was in that ark. It hid, Amen. the tables of stone. It hid the shikina of glory. It hid the two cherubams. Friends, everyone but the high priest. Amen. Wondered what is it like behind that veil? What is it really like? Only one person knew. Are you with me? Amen. That was the high priest. Aaron went in once a year with blood, right? To offer for the children of Israel for the sins. Amen. It, you know, for us friends, I know it's it's it's it's it's easy to see that because the veil has been torn, right? Amen. But think of yourself if you're an Israelite back in the wilderness, you would have wondered, my when Aaron comes out, he just is in awe and there's just something about him and there's an atmosphere and an aura around him. What is it? What makes him like that? He comes out just almost sometimes speechless. I'm just dramatizing. What is it that's behind it that's so awesome? And they would ask Aaron, "What was it like? What was it like?" "Oh, I I I I don't know how to say. I just can't even begin to say how awesome it is." And friends, I I I I tell you friends, we are so privileged, friends, to be able to go behind the veil. We don't have to ask brother so and so, what is it really like to be a Christian? What is it like, sister, to be an overcomer? What is it really like to be in the shina glory? What is it really like to be a real son or daughter of God? No, you can experience that yourself. Don't don't don't don't wait for somebody else. Don't say, "Well, I know brother Moses knows what it's like. I know what Brother Zigg knows what it's like to get behind the veil. You get behind the veil." Th friends, th those those cherubams that were in the Garden of Eden are not blocking the way, friends. They're they're they're making the way. They're they're they're encouraging. Get in. Get in. Hallelujah. Amen. But friends, amen. That that that curtain, if I could say it this way, was a was a dividing line, a demarcation between time and eternity. Amen. Amen. Just stay with me here because friends, Amen. On the one side was time, on the other side was eternity. Amen. We want to look at this. Amen. But watch this. See, on one side was the holy place. And my the holy place is a holy place. But think about it, friends. In that holy place. Amen. Oh, now watch this. I'm I'm just getting here. What was in that holy place? It was the manora. Amen. It was the table of showbread. Amen. It was the altar of incense. Right? But guess what, friends? If the priest didn't perform his duties, if the priest wasn't doing, Amen. their job, amen, over time, amen, that light in the manora would go out. If the priest didn't change the showbread, it would go stale. That's right. Amen. If the priest, amen, didn't uh what was the other thing there? Amen. Didn't attend to the altar of incense, that al that that waft of incense would go out. It depended on man, right? Amen. That's that's a type of time, friends. And and what does the manora represent? The seven church ages, which is time. The gentile dispensation two the last 2,000 years are typed out in the seven church ages, right? Amen. the seven the the seven golden candlestick. Right? So on one side is time. Amen. The light amen if it went unattended would go out in the manora. The showbread would go stale. It would go dry. It would get get stale and and untasteful and and and that incense would stop going if the if the priest didn't attend to it. Are you with me? But on the other side, friends, on the other side of that curtain, Amen. in that golden pot. Amen. That mana was just as fresh as it had ever been when it went into that pot. Friends, it didn't matter if it was Tuesday, if it was Thursday, if it was Saturday, it was still fresh. Friends, we can we can we can shout hallelujah. And we can say, "Amen." And we can be all excited in church, but what about tomorrow? What about Tuesday? What about Thursday? What about Saturday? What were you doing yesterday? Is it still as fresh? Or we feeding on some dead carrying like our brother said or some thing of the world. Oh my. Amen. Where the we want to get into the holiest of holies. Friends, we are not in Luther's age. Amen. Where we would just walk into the outer court. We are not in Luther in Wesley's age where we go. Amen. We are we are in the bride age. Even not in Pentecost, but in the bride age where we can go, Amen. into that unending day. Hallelujah. Where it's eternity. It's time is no longer. Amen. Oh my. Don't get stuck in Leodysia, friends. No, sir. Leadyia is still in time. It's beyond the curtain of time. You say, "What do you mean? We're still in these time bound bodies." And I said, "Yes, I am, but I'm not." Depends what you're Which part of you me are you talking about? What part of me are you talking about? This thing? Yeah, it's in time. It's getting older. It's getting tired. It gets sick. It has body aches now. Amen. But my soul That's a different story. Hallelujah.

Hallelujah. Amen. You know, brother Brown speaks about in the future home how, you know, um, after Jesus resurrection, seven Sabbaths pass, right?

Friend, friend, if you've had your personal Pentecost, friends, you in your soul have entered into an eternal realm. You've passed into eternity in your soul. Oh, you maybe you're wondering where I'm going with this. Amen. But I I'm thankful, friends. Amen. When we think about that curtain of time and going beyond the curtain of time, we already had a prophet that told us what it's like. Amen. Beyond the curtain of time. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm thankful for that. That God allowed him to go beyond and come back and tell us what it's like. That's right. Now, watch this, friends. In the Old Testament, right, Aaron, the high priest could only enter in once. Once a year, year after year, once. But watch this. says Paul begins to speak about this in Hebrews chapter 9. He says, "Then verily the first covenant had also ordinance of divine service and a worldly sanctuary. For there was a tabernacle made, the first wherein was the candlestick and the table and the showbread which is called the sanctuary." We know that's the holy place. And after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called the holiest of all, the holiest of holies, which had the golden sensor, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had mana, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant, and over at the cherubams of glory, shadowing the mercy seat, of which we cannot now speak particularly. Verse six, now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. So the priests went continually into that holy place to accomplish their service. Keep the manora light. Amen. Keep the showbread fresh. All these things. But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people. The Holy Ghost. This signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest. So they were foreshadowing. But that way was not yet meant yet yet made manifest yet because Jesus hadn't come which as the first time was yet standing. But watch this in verse 11. But Christ being come a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle. It was his body not made with hands. That is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and cows but by his own blood. Amen. Hallelujah. He entered in once. Just think friends, that high priest went in once a year. Amen. Year after year after year. But never once, friends did it change the desire of the worshipper. Never once did it change the nature of the of the worshipper. But Jesus went in once. Hallelujah. And when you come under that, friends, it changes your desire. It changes your nature. It changes your behavior. It changes your taste. Hallelujah. Friends, why? He went in with his own blood. Hallelujah. That blood of bulls and goats couldn't come back on the believer. Hallelujah. But he shed his own blood. Hallelujah. And then watch what Paul says here in verse 24. For Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the truth, but into heaven itself. Glory. He didn't only enter into tabernacles, what holy places made with hands, but he entered into heaven. Amen. Stay with me here. So, he didn't just stay in his physical tabernacle. The man, the flesh, the vessel, that was a tabernacle that God entered into, right? But he says now he went and entered into heaven. Heaven is eternal. That's the eternities, right? And so let me say it this way. Jesus, he went past hell. When he died, Amen. He went to hell, right? But guess what? Hell is an element of time. He went past that. He went and and after he knocked on hell's door, right? You know, I love that story. I believe when he knocked on the door, right? Let me just tell it a little bit cuz I like to tell the devil. Amen. What happened when our savior knocked on his door and Satan began to say, "Aha, I finally got you. I thought I had you when I killed Abel. I thought I had you when I killed Sosa. I thought I had you. And now, Amen. Here I hear you stand before me. I finally got you. Amen. Jesus said, "My blood is still fresh on the cross of Calvary." Hallelujah. And he reached over and took the keys of death, hell, and the grave from Satan's wasted and kicked him back into hell and shut the door. Hallelujah. Amen. The prophet of God would say in one place he shut the door so so hard. Amen. The shut shook in hell. Woo. Amen. That's our God. Amen. That's why, friends, when he came up and and friends, he went past hell, then he went to paradise. And what did he do? He knocked on that door. It was a different response, wasn't it? Hallelujah. When he got there, my Daniel said, "My, that's the one. That's the ancient of days." Abraham said, "No, that's the one I seen on the plains of Hammery. That's the one I had communion with." Hallelujah. There was a different response. He said, "Come on in." Hallelujah. He said, "Come on out. I'm emptying out paradise. Let's go. Paradise was a part of time. You realize, friends, paradise is no more. It's emptied out. He went past that. I'm saying he went past the veil of time. He went past hell. He went past paradise and he'd entered he went past the grave. He went past Jerusalem. After he entered paradise, right, he pulled them out and he said, "I got to do a whistle stop in Jerusalem. Pay a visit." Right? But he went past that and entered into heaven. Amen. Oh, hallelujah. And they begin to say, "Lift up your heads, oh ye gates." Why? The king of glory enters in. They said, "Who is this king of glory?" Oh, they said, "He's the king of glory. Mighty in battle." Hallelujah. Strong and mighty. Oh, hallelujah. That's our God this morning. He's still mighty in battle. Hallelujah. You're going through something this morning. He's He's mighty in battle. Hallelujah. Take the sword of faith, the sword of Amen. the sword of the spirit, rather, and put it to the heart of the enemy this morning. Hallelujah. Put your put the word on your lips. Hallelujah. Matthew 27, watch this. says, "Now Jesus on the cross, what happened actually when when he was on the cross there in verse 50, Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the vart rocks rent." Amen. How many know brother Brandon would speak about this in the unveiled God, the mighty God unveiled. Amen. When that veil broke, friends, they thought, the Jews thought their god, amen, was behind that veil still. But it they re they if they would have realized Amen. That's why I like this picture is that when the veil dropped it revealed that Amen. God was actually in flesh. Amen. And it died for their sins. It was God. Amen. Using a veil not of curtain, not of fine twine linen, but of earthly flesh. And now he's using yours. Amen. That badger skin. He's veiled behind that. Amen. I'm looking at him actually. Amen. I could if I could just look beyond the curtain of time. Amen. Are you with me? That's actually my point this morning. If we can look beyond the curtain of time, we'll see something. If God will say, let us to look beyond the curtain of time, we'll see something, friends. We'll see. Amen. That we were there. I'm getting way ahead of myself. Amen. Let me just let me just slow down here for a bit. You know, I I was studying back home, you know, for for tonight about, you know, about the all social media and things like that, friends. Amen. They're it's all about short videos, right? Reals and Tik Tok and this and that. You know why, friends? Amen. The devil has so anointed that. Amen. To take our attention span away. True. I began to think I ought to just give my punchline for the service right at the beginning. Cuz by the time I try to get it at the end, people have fallen asleep and they kind of have no attention and they they're just checked out already. Not the bride of Christ, right? Watch this. Brother Brandon says in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, he says, "I think of him when he had risen from the dead that morning that he was then had his own blood as a high priest and he went beyond the veils." Now watch this. I like how he says this. He went beyond the veils. Now he made it plural. Now watch this. through every sphere. Satan in times past had men blocked off from heaven. If I could say it this way, stuck in time. How? By sin, right? By eating off of that tree of knowledge of good and evil. It's it got us stuck. Adam and Eve were in eternity, right? They were they would never have died until they took that bite as it were. We know what it was, but you know what I'm saying, right? Amen. from that knowledge of good and evil. And they entered into time. Death entered into the human race. And they began to die. The day you eat thereof, the day you die, right? Amen. Time began there. But watch this. Amen. He could not get in contact with heaven. Amen. But then Jesus, when Jesus took his blood, the first veil he rent was the veil of death and the veil of the grave, the veil of the temple, then the veil of sickness. veils. He went past the veils. The veil of death, the veil of the grave, the veil in the temple, the veil of sickness, the veil of fear, and every veil that there was. Hallelujah. What veil are you? Amen. Hidden behind. What's hiding God from you this morning? Depression. Amen. Lust, pornography. He went past that. Amen. And unveiled God to man. Hallelujah. What is death anyways? Amen. It's an element of time. What's the grave? An element of time. This temple, sickness, weariness, fear, depression, suicidal thoughts. What are those? Those are elements of time. Jesus went beyond that. Hallelujah. And unveiled God to man. My which God? The eternal God. The God that had no beginning, no ending. Hallelujah. No father, no mother. Amen. God is not bound by time. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So friends, that situation you're dealing with. That besetting sin that you just can't get over, that's been passed down from your grandfather to your father to you. Amen. Is an element of time. It cannot go on. Hallelujah. the but the real you that I'm talking to. Amen. This morning, friends, am I talking to sons and daughters of God this morning? Hallelujah. Born of the spirit, friends, that you had no beginning. Oh, I wish we could see beyond the curtain of time this morning. The reason why Amen. Sometimes we struggle is the our our veil of time. It's this old thing, friends, that we got so focused on. But but brother, you don't know. Amen. What I struggle with. I I don't, but God does. And I say friends, this word either has power in it or doesn't. I happen to believe it all is all power. Power defeat any amen situation, any trial, any any sickness, any any depression, any oppression, whatever it might be. Friends, the power in this word, Amen. can defeat Amen. It will defeat Satan every time, any place, under any circumstance. Hallelujah. I'm thankful, man. Jesus Christ when he was tempted by by by Satan there on the on the back side of the desert friends. He didn't call 10,000 angels. He didn't do something supernatural. What? He became like the weakest Christian. That's right. Tired, weary. Amen. No one around him. Alone. I'm all alone. Nobody loves me. Jesus became like that. His disciples weren't there. Afterwards, the angels come and minister to him. Are you with me? Hallelujah. So, we think, "Oh, I'm so weak. Oh, nobody loves me. Nobody cares about me in in the church. Nobody has reached out to me. I'm going through things. Amen. God Amen. Jesus became just like you to show you friends that if you'll just take the word oh my. I'm sure you talk to people friends that are just because we live in this world of victimhood. Oh, woe is me. Woe is me. I'm going through it. I'm just Everybody's going through it. That's right. That's right. Everybody's going through things. Some just show it more than others, but we're all going through things. Stop being a victim. That's right. You're be a victor. You got to choose. You have to choose this morning. Am I going to stay a victim or am I going to be a victor? I'm going to be a victor. Victory in Jesus. He gave me the victory. He already conquered death, hell, and the grave. He con He went through every veil already. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's look past our current stress and our current trouble, friends. Amen. The Bible says, "Heavens and earth will pass away, but my word will never pass away." My word, my word, I'm talking about the living word. I'm looking at the word. Are you with me? Amen. That your that word I'm talking about the real you. Amen. That deposit, that eternal deposit that God put in you will never pass away. It cannot. Oh, for we've crossing the river veil. We've crossed the Riven veil. We're on the other side now. On the other side. And you'll see if you'll just do that. Break those old traditions and things. My We got to do that. Amen. And come to him, you'll see him standing. The mighty conqueror, the word of promise for this age made manifest. You'll see the mighty God unveiled. See him right here among us here. Unveiled. The mighty God unconquered by tradition. Oh, how many know there's veils of traditions that keep us? Oh, let us go beyond that, friends. We're we're invited to go beyond every veil and see the mighty God unveiled. If we could just look beyond the curtain of time, friends, you see, Amen. Behind the curtain of the holiest of holies, friends, the matter never went stale. Like I said, amen. The pillar of fire light, that shakina light never went out. Amen. And what happens? What happens to the individual that goes beyond that veil? Time stands still, right? Amy, you just enter into a realm where time don't matter anymore. Anybody know what I'm talking about this morning? Brother Bram says in planting the vine, but you know, as we get over into that other realm where time is no more, we begin to forget about time. Amen. Don't worry, I'm not setting you up for a three-hour sermon. Maybe. No promises. No, I'm just I'm I'm not I'm not that way. But how many know what's like, you know, and you maybe sing it here. I know what it's like to be in the presence of the Lord and not know what time it is. Why? Because time stood still. Where are you at? Amen. Oh my, you're behind the veil. You're somewhere. Amen. That that that that nothing matters. Oh my jaw, that don't matter no more. My lost love, that don't matter no more. Oh, that ailment in my leg. What? That don't matter no more. Oh, how many want to get there? How many want to live there? Friends, that high priest could go in, right? But they went out. We can go in and stay in. And stay in. Amen. Shikina unending is all I long for. Oh, it all blends into eternity. And there's not time. No time no more. There's no time limit. I don't know about you, friends, but I I I get bound up in time. I let time dictate my worship. I let time dictate my devotion. Just me then. I let time dictate my prayer life. Oh my I I got to get to work. Oh, that's why the Bible says redeeming the time. What has to happen? I'm preaching to myself. We got to cut time somewhere else to make time. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother B said he'll take whatever you give him. He wants 100%. He wants to have preeminences, right? Amen. in your vessel. He wants to fill every fiber, but he'll take he'll take a fiber if you'll give it to him. So, he'll take those two minutes you give him. But why don't you give him more? He wants more. He'll take it. Say, "Thank you." Amen. Oh, I'm saying things that I don't even thought I would say. Thank you, Lord. You remember the time brother Brown was praying for Georgie Carter? You know, remember he seen that vision, I believe, and he heard that that that almost like a lamb, Miltown, Miltown. So, he goes to Miltown. He doesn't even know who he's there for, right? So, he goes finds the church, you know the story, right? Starts holding revival meetings there. Well, one day he I believe he just felt so burdened on his heart to pray, right? And so he he was with the rights, I believe, and he said, "You know what? I'm going to go into the woods and I'm going to have some time for prayer, right?" And they said, "Yeah, sure. We're getting dinner ready. when dinner's ready, we'll ring the bell. Right. And he got into the woods there and he knelt down and oh, the briars just poke it. I couldn't get comfort. Oh, that man, that's hard ground. And you know, and just all sorts of things, right? Isn't that the way it is, right? You just say, "I'm going to I'm going to listen to like what that brother said. The preacher said on Sunday, they said to make more time for the Lord, I'm just going to make time for and all of a sudden Whatever whatever your your phone set does, right? The neighbor's dog starts barking. Your kids start yelling. What is it? It's that old devil. He knows. He wants you to pre he knows you're wanting to press in. So he That's our adversary. It's like that sister said, right? You got anything? You always have good things to say. Don't do you have anything good to say about the devil? He's sure a good adversary. But you, that's the way, right? We get down to pray. We get down to do devotion. I'm just going to set aside this 20 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour, whatever. And all of a sudden, everything crops up. Business calls, work calls, wife calls, children call. Amen. Whatever. Amen. The phone's just going like crazy. Facebook is just giving you notifications like crazy. Instagram and whatever. Oh my. It's the devil. Yeah. What do you do? What are you going to do? Oh, well, I just put on another time. No, it's time to press in deeper. Take me deeper, Lord. Hallelujah. Oh, watch this, Brother Brown. I'm just continuing on this illustration. He says, "I just couldn't get comfortable. The rocks I went around the side of the hill and it was leaning too much. The slope was too much. And you know, the devil just trying to keep you from getting the blessing." That's all it was. Then I climbed up a little further into the thick and I knelt down. The mosquitoes was just humming around on my ears and I couldn't hardly pray. The briars, the ground, it's too sloped. The mosquitoes, my what's going to what is he going to do? And I believe then it was the devil. So I said, "Oh Lord God, be merciful." And I just threw up my hands and start praying. Anyhow, there it is. Hallelujah. Amen. We sing a song back home. So, I'll just throw up my hands and start praising the Lord. Anybody know that song? I won't give up cuz I stand on his infallible word. When God sees my hands raised, he comes down and inhabits my praise. We got a dynamite plan. Satan just can't stand when I throw up my hands. Let me read you some of the verses there. It says, "When everything has gone wrong, I got my back to the wall. Satan's coming on strong. He really wants me to fall. He sends trouble my way. Even sickness is part of his plan. By myself, I can't win. So, I'll just throw up my hands. Amen. You realize, friends? Amen. This is the universal sign of surrender. But it's also the universal sign of victory. Amen. So, when you surrender, you'll be victorious. Hallelujah. And then the second verse is when I'm faced with a trial, I've got two ways I can go. I can still wear a smile or let me let me let him bring me down low. Satan whispers, "You're through." But I hear Jesus tell me to stand. What am I going to do? I think I'll throw up my hands. Hallelujah. That's what we ought to do, friends. Or when you're feeling down and, "Oh, I I can't even pray. I don't even feel like a Christian." Just throw up your hands. Say, "Lord, be merciful. I'm just going to pray anyhow. I'm just going to praise you anyhow. He's worthy. Amen. Whether we feel good, whether if you feel like a Christian, whe he's worthy still. Oh, that's what he comes down. Oh, we're waiting. Oh, when he comes down, I'll praise him. No, no, no. You got it all different. Amen. When we praise him, he comes down. Hallelujah. Watch what Brother Brown did. I just threw up my hand, started praying anyhow. And just let the mosquitoes fill up if they wish to. Amen. Man, we know what mosquitoes are all about. Amen. But there was something that was burdening in my heart. And after I become so lost in prayer, I guess you Christians know what it means. To be lost in prayer, just forget where you are. That's praying in the spirit, I believe. And I opened my eyes and just the side of a little dogwood bush, there was that light hanging there and it shining down to where I was said, "Rise and go by the way of Carters. There his answer come." Hallelujah. Well, then I looked around. It was almost dark. The bell had been ringing and they had search parties out for me. What happened? He passed beyond the curtain of time. Can I say it that way? He passed beyond the curtain of time where time didn't matter no more. He got so lost in the spirit, he didn't hear the bell ringing. He didn't notice, Amen, the mosquitoes anymore. He didn't notice the ground no more. He didn't notice that it was getting dark. He didn't notice that it was past supper time. No Lord, help us. Amen. And how many know that you know when brother Brandham actually went beyond the curtain of time now, right? What was he doing? He was laying on his bed, right? I mean, thinking about the other side, right? And he began to hear the voice saying, "Press the battle. Press the battle. Keep going. Keep going." And that same voice. Amen. Let me I quit. Keep pressing the battle. Keep pressing the battle. You might feel like you want to give up. Keep going. Amen. Amen. And they begin to hear this familiar song. I'm homesick and blue and I want to see Jesus. I would like to hear those harbor bells ring chime. It would brighten my path and banish all fears. Lord, let me look past the curtain of time. And then the voice said, "Would you like to see past the curtain of time?" You know what brother Brandon said, right? Oh, it would help me so much. Amen. I I wonder this morning if I would ask you, would you like to see past the curtain of time? I think we would say, "Oh, it would help me so much cuz why we we just see all the negativity. We see all the trouble. We see all the politics in the message. We see the falling away. We Lord, let me put let me look past the curtain of time." Amen. Hallelujah. All of a sudden, you become translated, right? Amen. You know, you know what he's seen, right? My He's seen that great throng of of of saints. God. Amen. Who are these Brandhams? No, they're your converts. I happen to believe I was there. How about you? Oh, our precious brother. Oh, our precious brother. And he begins to say this. He he he realized he was young again. And he was looking back at his body, that 50ome, whatever year old body laying on the bed there with his hand behind his head. And he says, "As I begin to try to comprehend the place where I was, I began to realize that there was no yesterday and no tomorrow there." In other words, no time. I really like this part, too. No one seemed to be tired. Wouldn't you like to go beyond the curtain of time? Hallelujah. What a place. Oh, those multitudes of people all young. Oh, brothers and sisters, sisters, long hair, long skirts, clean, holy. Oh, thank you, Lord. Amen. Sisters hugging him. No physical feeling. Nothing like we would in these bodies. My just purity. What was it? Perfect love. The voice said, "This is what you preach was or is the Holy Ghost." That means friends that I can get a taste of that on this side. That's true. Is that is that is that true? This is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it. Hallelujah. So, how can we say amen that we're going there and hate our brother? How can we say we're going there and cut down our sister? Only perfect love will enter there. So, friends, add to your faith virtue. and to virtue, knowledge, and to knowledge, temperance. Oh, I I have all the knowledge. I understand the mysteries. I I I can totally quote you the seven seal book, seven trumpets. Add to your knowledge. It's not that knowledge anyhow. It's not earthly knowledge. Knowledge puffth up. Oh, yeah. Oh, I've heard that before. Puffed up. Amen. Add. Add. Add. He wants us, friends, to come to the stature of a perfect man. Aren't you thankful, friends? We're not living in Ephesus. That's right. We're living right at the top where the headstone, friends, is supposed to come down and cap off your life. Hallelujah. I'm thankful it comes down, friends. Not judgment, judgment, judgment. No. Grace, grace, grace. Amen. Hallelujah. I am more convinced than ever in my life that it'll take perfect love to enter that place. There was no jealousy, no tiredness. Hallelujah. No sickness, no old age, no death, only supreme beauty and joy. Whatever you do, lay aside everything else until you get perfect love. Oh, I want that. I want that. How do I do it? Lay aside everything else. Oh, empty out, friends. Hallelujah. But you need to realize that even before God allowed him to be go beyond the curtain of time, he was he was already talking about it, you know, and I I was looking at this, you know, the first time if you search in the message that he begins to speak about going beyond the curtain of time, it's actually in the message looking to the unseen. And watch this. And I'm thankful, friends. Amen. It takes a special vision to look to the unseen, right? Amen. The people that that c can just look at this word, friends, and my they just they can just read it. But thank God for a prophetic eye. Hallelujah. An eagle eye, an eagle anointing. Amen. To see to the unseen. To see that Abraham and Sarah had a body change. Who else sees that? All the all the all the children's books. We had a baby. No, they were 20. Let's go to the doctor. Sarah, we're having a baby. They were young. They had a body change. We couldn't see that without a prophet. Watch this here. Oh, in looking to the unseen. Oh, what I would think tonight, Lord, let us look past the curtain of time. Just look over just just a little peek and see what it's all about. How many would like to look past the curtain of time and see what it's all about? What it's all about. Amen. God has given us a vision. It's like, you know, it's like the illustration of, you know, brother Brown would talk about the circus, you know. Amen. And the and the little boys that couldn't have enough money to maybe get in, right? They would climb up and the tallest one or the strongest one would get up on the fence, right? Amen. And peek over, find a knot hole and look through and oh, they could see and their friends are down there and say, "Oh, oh, there's a lion. It the lion the trainer's in the cage now with the lion. Oh, I want to see. I want to see." Right? But that one could see. He look over there. Oh, there's elephants. Oh, the they're doing this. They're doing that. I want to see. I want to see. Watch this. He says, "That's the cry of the human heart has always been since we know that there is a God. Every mortal has tried to look past the curtain of time to find out if they could see where they come from. What's their business here, and where they'll be after they leave here?" Amen. See, so if you can see past the curtain of time, friends, you'll see where you come from. Hallelujah. You'll see what your business is here. You realize, friends, that many times, amen, the world will say, you know, it's all about finding your purpose, right? What? Finding yourself. Well, this is the way to find yourself. And you'll begin to see that you're actually identified in the word and that actually his identity is your identity. Amen. Glory. Amen. You'll see where you're going. That you could say like Jesus, I come from God. I go back to God. I'm just going back where I came from. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Watch this. Notice. Amen. Brother Brandham actually wasn't the first to go past the curtain of time. Follow me here. In the resurrected Lord Jesus, every man is trying to look past the curtain of time. You know, you come from somewhere. You're going somewhere. So it takes a little peak of past the curtain time. Moses wanted to see it. God let him see it so we can see it also. Amen. So Moses seen past the curtain of time. How else could he write the five first five books of the Bible? He wasn't there physically when God said, "Let there be." And there was. He wasn't there. How would he know what God created on day three and day four and day five? God let him look past the curtain of time. How else did he know friends that Abraham and Sarah and then met Melzdc and had communion? How else would Moses know that was way before Moses? God let him see past the curtain of time to see Melzdc, to see Abraham, to see Joseph, all these things, right? Hallelujah. Yes. He lived through the Exodus. Yes. Amen. He lived through the the making of the tabernacle. Amen. But how did he know what Moses and what Noah preached? How did he know how many animals were in the ark? Yeah. God let him look past the curtain of time. Hallelujah. What about Daniel? How could Daniel Amen describe the ancient of days? How could Daniel describe all the Gentile dispensations that were coming? The Babylonians, the Mes and Persians, the Grecians, the Romans. How would he know that? I mean, God let him see past the curtain of time. What about Job? Maybe there's a Job here this morning. Oh, it was in his darkest hour. And God had allowed him to lose everything. You know the story. And he had let those three miserable comforters come and discourage Job even more. Amen. But then God, oh, he knew his son was there on that ash sheep scraping his boils, friends. Amen. So he sent him he sent him a representative. Hallelujah. Thank God for technology. Amen. He sent him a representative. Elhu, brother said he was Christ's representative. He was a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ. And what did Elhu do? Amen. Prophet of God would talk about he began to change Job's focus. Oh Lord, I help me here. Amen. Amen. And but in that time, friends, Amen. I can imagine God, let me just dramatize it this way, saying to Job as he's in his deepest, darkest trial on his ash heap, scraping those boils. Everybody's turned against him. Everyone thinks he's a secret sinner. His wife says, "Why don't you just curse God and die?" Can you imagine being in that kind of a condition? God sends Elue. And I can just imagine God saying, "Job, would you like to look past the curtain of time? that would help me so much. Just dramatizing. Watch this. Job began to see it. Being a prophet, he began to listen to this little prophet, Elihoo. And the first thing you know, Job raised up. God put his binoculars down over his eyes. And he looked way down 4,000 years. And he said, "I know my redeemer liveth. And at the last days, he'll stand on the earth. Though the skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself. Mine eyes shall behold and not another. Yes, he saw the resurrection of Christ. He said, "My eyes shall beholden not another." He seen Jesus. Job in his deepest trial, God. Amen. Let him see past the curtain of time. Amen. To see, Amen. Jesus Christ, his redeemer. Oh, he said, I know my redeemer liveth. It's just not an imagination. I'm not just making this up. It's not just a good feeling. Amen. On a Sunday morning, friends, but I see Jesus. I see my redeemer. Looking past the curtain of time, friends. What a vision. Lord, you help us look beyond the curtain of time. Hallelujah. You'd help us so much. Glory. Now, let's bring it to our day because we we love to look back, right? And it's good to look back. It's good to learn from our predecessors and look in the word. But really, what matters to us is today. Is that right? Now, watch this. And and this is so familiar to you. Amen. In Revelation chapter 10, the Bible says, "I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was at as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open." Aren't you thankful for that? In Revelations 5, it was closed. But in Revelations 10, it's open. And he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth. I I was reading that last night. I was thinking, Lord, you know, there's many types, okay? I'm not putting a period to anything. Amen. But to me, Amen. One of these things is he was claiming ownership. You know, when brother Brown would say, you know, even in the Old Testament when Israel went into the land, footsteps means possession. And here the mighty angel comes and sets one foot on the earth and one foot on the sea. And he begins, Amen. And how many know that we witness this in this day? Yeah, we did. This is not a future tense. This already happened. Hallelujah. He's come down. The word, Amen, come down. Verse 5. And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and swear by him that liveth forever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that are there in are, and the earth, and the things that are there in our, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer. See, time no longer, eternity. when when the little book is open. Now you're saying, "But we're still in time." Yes, we are. But no, we're not. I'm talking about in your soul. Can you differentiate that? Don't think I'm preaching some weird doctrine this morning. Amen. There. What happened when the book was open, friends? Amen. The opening of the word, it it gave us an entrance into an eternal realm that we had never seen before. That's right. Watch this. I I love this. In the breach, brother Brown begins and this is before, right? It was God hidden simplicity, right? God hides himself in simplicity and reveals himself in the same. Then he comes, Amen. and preaches the breach between the church ages and the seven seals. And watch what he begins to say. Now, with the lamb, with the book in his hands, we're ready to ask his grace and mercy upon us to open the seven seal book to us and let us look past the curtain of time just a little bit. Oh my. So, what does the opening of the seven seal book do for us? It lets us look past the curtain of time. So, I I want to preach from an open book then. Amen. I don't want to preach from a closed book. Amen. It's like this, friends. I've given this illustration before, but you know, I if if I were to read something that you're really familiar with. Let's let's say, let me just read this one cuz we all know this one. But what if I were to read like this because it's, you know, partially open. Peter and men and brethren repent in the name of Jesus. You shall ghost you and now if the book wasn't open like that's kind of weird like what's that gibberish like you all know why you you've read the whole thing. I'm just giving an illustration. You see what the denomination would I'm not putting them down at all but friends they're preaching from a closed book. They can probe. Yeah. Unable to walk and carry it. They can look at they can find snippets of it. But you know what? Some you know you know what's shameful for us though, friends? They can have more excitement sometimes than we do with 10% of the word. Shame on us. We got the whole thing. Thank you, Lord. Now, right, we talked about Moses looking past the current time, Job, Daniel, all these things. But look at John now. And who is John a type of? Who's a John in the in the book of Revelation? A type of us. The bride. Brother Bram said the church. Amen. No, I I take that as the bride. Amen. He's a type of the bride. Watch this. But the first thing that represented that redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world. And he took the book. Glory. Opened the book. And I would say glory and tore off the seals. Hallelujah. and sent it down to the earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people. There you are. Oh my. What happened? The screams, the shouts. Oh yeah. My when he sent it down to his seventh angel, you know, I I I can't bring it up here, but there's another quote, you know, I believe it's in this in the seals, one of the seals, I can't remember. And he's and he's preaching about this and and you know what's amazing is it's actually literally happening. God is literally opening the seals to his people. And you know how they put in parenthesis, you know, congregation says amen. You know what the parenthesis people congregation rejoices and he says oh in wonderful and it says congregation continues to rejoice. I thought my that's wonderful friends. There it was happening. Amen. In Revelation, John was rejoicing. The hallelujah, the shouts, the anointing, the Oh, there should be a reflection, right? Amen. There's got to be a reflection somewhere. Amen. Oh my. What happened? The screams, they shout. We're not trying to build it up, friends, but some something's going to be in you. Amen. That it's not a workup. It's like, Amen. You just can't help it, right? My dog at home can't help when someone knocks on the door. just can't. I was trying to train be quiet. Shut up. It's just in it. And friends, the world can say, "Shut up. Stop being so excited." Some critical believer comes in. Stop being so excited. And I can't help it. I seen my name on the book. Hallelujah. I can't help it. Don't let nobody shut your shouts up. Just make sure when you get down, you live, right? Oh, there's the balance, right? Amen. Just make sure when you just shout as high as you can, shout as loud as you can and live as hard as you can for the Lord when you get down. Hallelujah. The anointed, the power, the glory, the manifestation. And old John who had been standing there, our brother, crying, why? He said, everything in heaven, everything in the earth, everything in the sea heard me holler. Amen. My if if they all heard it, he must have shouted, right? and everything in the sea heard me holler. Amen. I believe in amens. Amen. Blessings, honor, might, power be to him that lives forever and ever. Talk about a happy time. When them seals broke, John must have looked in and seen a past the curtain of time. Amen. When them seals broke to John, he must have looked past the curtain of time. So when John seen past the curtain of time, Amen. What did he see? He seen himself. You ever think about that? When John, right? What a privilege John had. And you think about, but he's on the aisle of Patmas, scorpions, and he's all alone. He's with convicts. He's with a bunch of criminals, right? All alone. No pastor, no no no no brother, no deacon, no family, no no loved one, no no church. Amen. brothers and sisters to encourage. He's all alone, but God lets him enter into the day of the Lord's day. And what does he see? He gets transported, right? And he begins to see the throne room, right? And one sitting on the throne, right? Right. He see and he sees the four and 20 elders. He sees the four beasts. Are you with me? He begins to see that. But let me ask you friends, who were those four and 20 elders? They were the four the 12. Amen. patriarchs of the Old Testament and the twel apostles of the New. Is that right? Well, what was John? He was one of those apostles. So, he's seen himself. This should make you shout. He when he looked beyond the curtain of time, friends, he seen Oh, let me read it to you because brother Brown says here, he says, I love it. This is the best part. He said, "There's John." When the seals broke and he looked past the current of time, he said, "Oh, there's that's me. That's me." Amen. When the seals open, friends, and the book open to you, friends, I trust that's what you said. That's not David. That's not just Daniel. That's mama. Amen. You're you're playing around in your in your denominational house and grandma's house or whatever and all of a sudden you come across the mirror, right? And you moved and that boy moved. Mama, that's me. Hallelujah. Oh, glory. What an experience that was, wasn't it? Amen. When you begin to see friends yourself, that is the greatest thing. Amen. Young people, old people, friends. Amen. It's got to be more than Amen. the best preacher in the message. Amen. Oh, they just preached wonderfully. Oh, I was so blessed by that. What about your experience? Amen. What What's God doing in your life? Oh, that didn't go over very well. Amen. We got to have our own personal experience. Hallelujah. Friends, when when John seen his own identity, when John seen himself, and when you see yourself, that's when you'll have a jumping shouting. Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. Blessing time. Amen. Because what did John realize? I made it. I can't miss it. Here I am on the aisle of Patmas, but I made it. But John, you're a prisoner. Don't you know you're getting old? You're gonna die. I made it. I can't miss it. Hallelujah. I'm already there. You know what's wonderful even about this this quote? It's in the breach. But look how brother Branham is saying here. He says, "Talk about a happy time when them seals broke in time." 1963. That day. Amen. The seals hadn't even broke yet in time. But beyond the curtain of time, there's no time. That's right. So, the seals had already been broke. When did God when was the lamb slain? Before the foundation of the world. Before there was even time. Amen. When were you saved? When were when were you a son of God? If you are a son or a daughter of God, let me say it this way. If you are a daughter of God this morning, you always were a daughter of God. You always will be a daughter of God. That's right. Hallelujah. So friends, if you can see yourself past the current of time, friends, you'll realize I am a child of God. I always was. You didn't become a child of God at the altar, friends. You just recognized that you're a child of God. You be you were born an eagle in your soul. Amen. That attribute in you friends is not some time element. It's eternal. Yes. Hallelujah. Let's go. Let's go on just a little longer if that's okay. Amen. You know, we're speaking about that tabernacle in the wilderness, right? And the and the and the high priest that could go in once a year, right? He would go in, he would come out, go in, come out, right? And as we already said, we can go in and stay in. But you know what's amazing about the tent vision? Can I just can I go over that just a little bit? Amen. The tent vision. Amen. Brother Brandon has this vision of a big tent, big cathedral. Depends how you when you where you read it, right? But in that tent, in that cathedral was a platform and on the platform was a little room, right? And people there was a prayer line and people would be going into that room. Amen. But let me type that. Amen. to where we want to go. Amen. Past the curtain of time. Amen. In that when they were going into that room, friends, they weren't going in and then just coming out as it were, right? They were going in and going through. Amen. So, there's a difference here. And so, that lady that come in, they were they wheeled her in on a stretcher into that room. She come out of it on the other side pushing the stretcher. Amen. And shouting, "Glory, hallelujah. Amen." the the the man went with his crutches into the room and he came out the other side carrying the crutches giving glory to God. Right? And it's it's amazing. Amen. They said, "Amen. What happened?" It's it's like they they would ask Aaron, "What happened?" You know what she said? I don't know, but I was paralyzed for 20 years. And now this is where it I feel like I was never sick. You caught that? Why? Amen. Her sickness was in time. But when she went beyond the curtain of time, I feel like I was never sick. Let me update. I never was a sinner, per se. Hallelujah. That was in time. Glory. That was in time. My complex was in time. Hallelujah. Glory. What did the voice say? I'll meet you there. This is that third pull. But it won't be a public show. What was the third pull? The opening of the word. What happened at the opening of the word? We went past the curtain of time. Yes. I I trust you see it. Hallelujah. Beyond the current of time, friends. Eternity. Guess who's not there? The devil. Hallelujah. You hear that, devil? cuz he's here. He's the most faithful church member. So, devil, guess what? Beyond the curtain of time. Sorry. You won't be there. That's why he don't like the book of Genesis or the book of Revelations. Why? It identifies and exposes who where his beginning was, who he is, how he deceives, and his end. I can read about my my beginning and my not end. I can read about my eternal destination. Let's read about the devil. That old devil, that old serpent will be cast into the lake of fire. You hear that? Why? He had a beginning. Then he has an end. Think about this as we just begin to close. Everything the devil is accusing you of, he is actually a prophesying of himself because he's a prophet. He's just a false prophet. He says, "You're not going to make it. You're not." But he's the one that's not going to make it. He keeps saying you don't have the Holy Ghost. He doesn't have the Holy Ghost. So stop listening to him. He keeps accusing you. You're this. You're That's what he is. You're going to hell. No. No. Satan. You're going to hell. That is the only person you can say that to. That's right. Oh, thank you, Lord. Amen. God has a sense of humor. Oh, thank you, Lord. Friends, when he takes his last breath in hell, we'll be s we'll be still singing amazing grace. When he takes his last breath, right? Because hell will be everlasting. Still a time element. It's not eternal. It's not. We don't believe in an eternal hell, right? You'd have to have eternal life to be an eternal hell. Hell is everlasting. When he takes his last breath and is no more, we'll be singing amazing grace. Whatever we'll be singing, glory, glory, hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Amen. Lord, give us a glimpse beyond the current of time. What else ain't there? Sickness, depression, oppression, pain, suffering. Those are all time elements. That means they won't be there. Let us look beyond the curtain of time. Friends, don't don't get caught up in the three curtains of time, right? So many people are, oh, China, Russia, those are curtains, right? The bamboo curtain, the iron curtain. Brother Brandham said, watch that purple curtain. That's the deceiver. But he also said, "You don't have to fear any of those." Why? We've been able to look past the curtain of time of time. This is actually the curtain, friends, I'm most interested in. Say, "Lord, let me look past the curtain of my time and realize there's something of eternal value here. Lord, give us a glimpse, Lord, this morning of our true identity beyond the curtain of time. I'm so glad, friends. Amen. Aren't you glad this morning? Let's stand together. I don't know if this would be appropriate, but um could my wife come and we'll we'll sing that song. I'll just throw up my hands if that's all right. Do you have a bass? No. Okay, that's okay. It can it be set up or it's not in tune? Okay, never mind. Let's pray. Let's pray. Dear Lord Jesus, thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Lord, we we just ask, oh God, that you'll just help us, Father, this morning. Sometimes we Lord, we do get like Job. Lord, I get like Job. And we just get so focused on our conditions and our and our and our trials and life and our struggles, Lord. And they're real, Lord. I I I'm not minimizing them at all this morning, but Lord, give us a glimpse this morning, Lord, beyond that curtain of time, Lord, where we come from, where we had, Lord, where God began to ask Job, "Where were you? Where were you, Job?" Oh, when he got that vision, oh, I was there, Lord, when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for, I was there. Oh, there's Job. Oh, not only, oh, there's Jesus. Oh, Lord, let us look past, oh, past our trial, past our mistakes, past our failures, past everything that's in this time element, Lord, and realize, oh, there I am beyond the curtain of time. There I am. Oh, I can't miss it, Lord. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. There's somebody here this morning, Lord, that Lord has their eagle eyes filmed over. Lord, I pray God that the word of God, the spirit of God would just begin to put that sav, Lord, on their eagle eyes. May that Lord, may they begin to be anointed to get to that rock, Lord, that cleft of the rock, Lord, and begin to beat on it. And just, Lord, get that crust off of their eagle eyes, Lord, where they can see again and they can fly to the heavenlies again, Lord. Oh God, if there be one here this morning, Lord Jesus, in the valley of the shadow of death, Lord, may you be their light, Lord. Hallelujah. Lord, speak to them even this morning, Lord, encourage them, Lord. Lift them up, we pray. We thank you, Father. And Lord, just accept of our worship now as we water the word in Jesus Christ's name I pray. Amen. Hallelujah. So, I'll just throw up my hands and start praising the Lord. Oh, I won't give up cuz I stand. Oh, on his infallible word. Oh, when God sees my hands raised, oh, he comes down and inhabits my praise. I've got a dynamite plan.

I've got a dynamite plan Satan just can't stand. When I raise up my hand, let's sing the verse. When everything has gone wrong, I got my back to the wall. Satan's coming on strong. He really wants me to fall. Oh, he sends trouble my way. Oh, even sickness is part of his plan. By myself, I can't win. Oh, so I just throw up my hands. I'll just throw up my hands and start praising the Lord. I won't give up. I won't give up cuz I stand on his infallible word. On his infallible word. When God sees my hands raised. Oh, when God sees my hand, he comes down. He and inhabits and inhabits my praise. I've got a dynamite plan. Satan just can't stand when I raise up my hand. When I'm faced with a trial, oh when I'm faced with a trial, I've got two ways I can go. Well, I can still wear a smile. Oh, let me bring me down low. Satan whispers, Satan whispers, you're through. But I hear Jesus. But I hear Jesus. He tells me to stand. What am I going to do? I think I'll throw up my hands. Oh, I think I'll throw up my hand. Hallelujah. Oh, I just throw up my hands and start praising the Lord. I won't give up. I won't give up cuz I stand on his infallible word. on his infallible word.

I can still wear a smile or let me bring me down low or let it bring me down low. Satan whispers, "You're through." Satan whispers, "You're through." But I hear Jesus tell me to stand. But I hear Jesus. He tells me, "What am I going to do?" What am I going to do? I think I'll throw up my hands. Oh, I think I'll throw out my hands. Let's give them a wave offering. I'll just throw out my hands and start praising the Lord. Oh, I won't give up cuz I stand. Oh, what is infallible a word. When God sees my hands raise, he comes down inhabits my praise.
