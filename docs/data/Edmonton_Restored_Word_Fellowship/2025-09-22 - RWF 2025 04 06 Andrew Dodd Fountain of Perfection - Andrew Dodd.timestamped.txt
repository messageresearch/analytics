[46:01] You will be a great nation.
[46:05] I will give you this land.
[46:10] I will bring you back home. Bring you
[46:14] back home. All my children,
[46:18] [Music]
[46:20] you love on the road. Lost and alone in
[46:24] the night.
[46:26] [Music]
[46:28] There is nothing on earth that could
[46:31] take you away. Once I gather you under
[46:35] my wings,
[46:37] I will bring you all back home
[46:42] again.
[46:44] [Music]
[46:46] like strangers
[46:50] of the earth.
[46:54] I will set you a savior.
[46:58] I will finish my work.
[47:02] You have no other shepherd.
[47:07] You have no other
[47:11] green pastures are waiting.
[47:16] If you want more,
[47:21] I will bring you back home. I'll bring
[47:24] you back home. All my children,
[47:30] there ain't no longer.
[47:32] Lost and alone in the night.
[47:38] There is nothing on earth that could
[47:41] take you away. Once I gather you under
[47:45] my wings,
[47:47] I will bring you all back home
[47:52] again.
[47:54] Pray for the priest. Look to the east
[47:58] for the sunrise is sudden and fierce.
[48:02] Every prophet and priest, king in the
[48:06] city will look for the one who pierced.
[48:11] We will mourn with the one pierced.
[48:17] But only my daughters,
[48:21] oh sons of Abraham,
[48:26] I will wash you with water.
[48:30] I will offer the lamb.
[48:34] Though your sins were like scarlet,
[48:39] they'll be wider than snow.
[48:43] I will always be with you.
[48:48] I will never let go.
[48:53] I will bring you back home. I'll bring
[48:56] you back home. All my children,
[49:00] [Music]
[49:02] you will no longer roll. Lost and alone
[49:07] in the night.
[49:11] There is nothing on earth that can take
[49:14] you away. Once I gather you under my
[49:18] wings,
[49:19] I will bring you all back home
[49:25] again.
[49:27] I'll die again.
[49:32] I
[49:33] am
[49:36] I
[49:37] [Music]
[49:44] am and I am here
[49:49] and I am
[49:52] Ryan and I am here.

[50:20] of praise. Amen.

[56:07] Shine
[56:08] on me.
[56:11] Let the light
[56:13] from the light
[56:16] shine
[56:17] on me. Let us say a few words to the
[56:20] Lord. Father, we thank you this morning.
[56:22] Thank you to be in your house this
[56:24] morning. Father, as each individual,
[56:26] Father, is speaking to you this morning,
[56:28] Father, as a prayer, Lord, may you shine
[56:31] upon our heart. May you speak to our
[56:33] heart, Father. Lord, may we prepare our
[56:36] heart to receive from you, Lord. Only
[56:38] the word of God can change. Not a man
[56:40] understanding, not a man ideas. As we
[56:43] heard the prophet this morning, we
[56:45] cannot lean on our own understanding,
[56:47] Father. But we want to take you by
[56:48] faith. Take your word, take you at your
[56:51] word, Father. May you come, Father, and
[56:53] speak to our heart. There are many needs
[56:55] among us. For those who are sick,
[56:56] Father, may you heal them as the word
[56:59] will come forth, Father. May the healing
[57:01] power, Father, touch their bodies,
[57:02] Father. Lord Jesus Christ, for those who
[57:05] need the Holy Ghost. We all need more of
[57:07] the Holy Ghost, Father, as the word of
[57:09] God will come forth, Father. May you
[57:11] fill our heart once again of you, Lord.
[57:13] We desire refilling more of you, Father.
[57:16] We love you. We appreciate you. Shine
[57:18] upon our heart, Father. Let the light
[57:20] come and shine upon the seed so the seed
[57:23] can produce the life. We give you the
[57:25] glory and the honor. Thank you for every
[57:26] gift this morning. Thank you for the
[57:28] special. Thank you for the song leading.
[57:30] Thank you for each individual. Father,
[57:32] we love you. In the name of Jesus
[57:34] Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen.
[57:38] Oh to be like Jesus.
[57:43] That's our desire to be like Jesus.
[57:51] on earth
[57:57] to be like him.
[58:02] Oh to my journey.
[58:06] [Music]
[58:08] All the glory.
[58:13] I only ask
[58:17] to be like him.
[58:22] Brother and true. To be like Jesus.
[58:29] To be like Jesus.
[58:34] on earth I long
[58:39] to be like him.
[58:44] Oh through life's journey
[58:49] from it to glory
[58:52] [Music]
[58:54] I only ask
[58:58] to be like him.
[59:04] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[59:09] Good morning, friends. Good morning.
[59:11] Let's all just have our seat for a
[59:13] minute. Thank you. It's all the singing
[59:15] we'll do. I appreciate that. It's good
[59:17] to see each and every one of you. It's
[59:20] good to be in the house of the Lord,
[59:21] isn't it? Amen. I was just driving the
[59:24] other day by Breton actually, and I
[59:26] thought, wonder how brother Peter's
[59:28] doing. Doing well. How's your wife
[59:30] doing? How's sister Feroza?
[59:34] She's getting well.
[59:37] Wonderful. Wonderful. We're happy to
[59:39] hear that and happy to hear you've been
[59:41] reunited in home. Amen. And uh it's
[59:46] always good to just be gathered together
[59:49] with saints of like precious faith.
[59:52] Amen. And to see what the Lord's doing
[59:53] in different places. And I so appreciate
[59:56] brother Moses, brother Zigg. Thank you
[59:59] for the opportunity just to come and
[1:00:02] share my heart with you. And and I know
[1:00:04] brother Moses said he's on call this
[1:00:06] morning. He still works a 9 to5 and you
[1:00:09] know when you're a pastor, brother Zigg,
[1:00:11] you know, you're always on call. So you
[1:00:14] just kind of get used to it. But uh you
[1:00:17] know that's that's how it is as a
[1:00:19] servant of God. You know as servants of
[1:00:20] the Lord we're we're servants to the
[1:00:22] bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. You know, I
[1:00:25] was telling the church end time message.
[1:00:27] I said, 'You know, when we go and preach
[1:00:29] different places and sometimes we
[1:00:30] minister in churches in the same city.
[1:00:33] Why do you do that? Because we're a
[1:00:34] we're a servants to the bride of Christ.
[1:00:38] And there's the bride of Christ right
[1:00:39] here. Amen. You believe you want to put
[1:00:41] your name there and say, I'm a part I'm
[1:00:43] a part of that. And you know, as
[1:00:45] ministers, we're not called to just be
[1:00:47] in one little place and this is my us
[1:00:49] three and no more. but rather if we can
[1:00:51] encourage one another, you know, and as
[1:00:54] as those of you that are not ministers,
[1:00:56] but you all have a ministry, our
[1:00:59] ministry is to Christ. He says, "I've
[1:01:01] made you kings and priests." Amen.
[1:01:04] You've got a place. You've got
[1:01:05] something, a work, and a purpose. God
[1:01:07] doesn't do anything without a cause,
[1:01:09] without a purpose behind it. Amen. God
[1:01:11] always has a reason. So, good to see
[1:01:14] you, brother Ben. It's good to see you
[1:01:15] there. I appreciate that song. just in
[1:01:18] the spirit just allowing the Lord to
[1:01:19] move. You know, you can do that a lot
[1:01:21] more in a small church where you can
[1:01:23] just allow the Lord to move and lead.
[1:01:25] And thank you for the special this
[1:01:27] morning, sister. It was wonderful. Holy,
[1:01:29] holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.
[1:01:32] Amen. Amen. I wonder if we wouldn't just
[1:01:36] take our Bibles together and and uh I
[1:01:39] was just reading in the back there this
[1:01:41] morning. Let's just go to Hebrews
[1:01:42] chapter 6.
[1:01:49] I really wasn't sure where to start, but
[1:01:51] we'll just kind of take it as the Lord
[1:01:54] would leave it. I I lead it. I believe
[1:01:55] this would be pertinent this morning.
[1:01:57] And Amen. Amen.
[1:02:03] It's good to see you, brother France.
[1:02:06] Sister Shauna,
[1:02:08] where's Brother Paul at? Is he hiding
[1:02:10] back there behind sister Kathy? There
[1:02:12] you are, buddy. Sister God bless you.
[1:02:15] Amen.
[1:02:17] It's lovely song. Oh daughters of Zion.
[1:02:21] We got a promise.
[1:02:24] I where I I go to prepare a place for
[1:02:26] you that where I am there you may be
[1:02:29] also. He said if it wasn't so I would
[1:02:31] have told you. We have this by two
[1:02:34] immutable things. Number one, God cannot
[1:02:36] lie. Amen. He told us the truth and he
[1:02:39] won't lie to us. What a wonderful thing.
[1:02:43] Hebrews chapter 6, if we would just
[1:02:46] start in verse one says, "Therefore,
[1:02:48] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[1:02:51] of Christ, let us go on unto perfection,
[1:02:54] not laying again the foundation of
[1:02:56] repentance from dead works, and of faith
[1:02:59] toward God, of the doctrine of baptisms,
[1:03:03] and of laying on of hands, and of
[1:03:05] resurrection of the dead, and of eternal
[1:03:07] judgment. And this will we do if God
[1:03:10] permit. For it is impossible for those
[1:03:13] who were once enlightened and have
[1:03:15] tasted of the heavenly gift and were
[1:03:17] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[1:03:19] have tasted of the good word of God and
[1:03:22] the powers of the world to come. What a
[1:03:24] wonderful taste. Oh, taste and see that
[1:03:27] the Lord is good. People that have
[1:03:29] really felt the presence of God have
[1:03:31] seen that there is a real God. But he
[1:03:34] says, "If they would fall away to renew
[1:03:36] them again unto repentance, seeing they
[1:03:39] crucify to themselves the Son of God
[1:03:42] aresh, and put him to an open shame. For
[1:03:46] the earth which drinkketh in the rain,
[1:03:49] and cometh off upon it, bringeth forth
[1:03:51] herbs, meat to them by whom it is
[1:03:54] dressed, receiving receiveth the
[1:03:56] blessings of from God. But that which
[1:04:00] beareth thorns and briars is rejected
[1:04:03] and is nigh unto cursing, whose end is
[1:04:06] to be burned. But beloved, we are p
[1:04:10] persuaded better things of you and
[1:04:13] things that accompany salvation through
[1:04:17] or though we thus speak. For God is not
[1:04:20] unrighteous to forget your works and
[1:04:23] labor of love, which ye have shown
[1:04:26] toward his name, in that ye have
[1:04:28] ministered to the saints, and do
[1:04:30] minister. And ye, we desire that every
[1:04:33] one of you do show the same diligence to
[1:04:36] the full assurance of hope unto the end,
[1:04:39] that ye be not slothful,
[1:04:42] but followers of them who through faith
[1:04:45] and patience inherit the promise.
[1:04:49] Amen. Let's just bow our heads together
[1:04:51] one more time. Maybe tonight you just
[1:04:53] want to welcome the Lord to your seat
[1:04:55] this morning. And you want to raise your
[1:04:58] hand as brother Brandham says that would
[1:04:59] be to defy gravity. You've got to push
[1:05:02] against the natural elements of the
[1:05:04] world and press into the kingdom. Maybe
[1:05:06] you want to raise your hand to the Lord
[1:05:08] this morning and say, "Father, come meet
[1:05:10] me in my chair. Come by my way, Lord. Go
[1:05:14] beyond brother Andrew. Go beyond the
[1:05:17] people beside me, Lord, and meet me
[1:05:19] where I am. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus,
[1:05:22] we come humbly, Lord, into your presence
[1:05:24] this morning. So thankful, Father, to be
[1:05:27] gathered with saints of like precious
[1:05:28] faith. Lord, thankful, Lord, even for
[1:05:31] brother Scott, Lord, the simplicity of
[1:05:33] the prayer this morning, Lord, as he
[1:05:35] just stood up here and said, "Lord, I
[1:05:37] want to thank you for the sunshine,
[1:05:39] Lord." How often we complicate it and if
[1:05:41] there's not a miracle in our lives,
[1:05:43] we're hardly thankful. We can't hardly
[1:05:44] raise our head. But oh God, Lord, you
[1:05:48] gave us breath in our lungs. Lord, you
[1:05:50] gave us life, Lord, light to see, Lord.
[1:05:53] Father, you gave us sunshine to warm us,
[1:05:55] Lord, to bring forth the good herbs,
[1:05:57] Lord, and the water upon the soil. And
[1:05:59] Father, food to eat, Lord, clothes on
[1:06:01] our back, roofs over our heads. Lord,
[1:06:04] how grateful we are, Lord. Those are
[1:06:06] natural things. But Father, you've
[1:06:08] opened our eyes with spiritual
[1:06:10] understanding that Lord, we could see
[1:06:12] the message of the hour. Lord, when
[1:06:14] there's a world in gross darkness, Lord,
[1:06:16] groping about, wondering, Lord, to and
[1:06:19] fro and just grasping at scriptures, not
[1:06:22] knowing, but Father, you've given us
[1:06:23] light. You've raised us into heavenly
[1:06:25] places that we could see. Oh, Father,
[1:06:29] how lovely you are. Thank you, Lord
[1:06:32] Jesus, for these wonderful mercies.
[1:06:34] Thank you for your grace. Thank you for
[1:06:36] your love. I pray you come by our way
[1:06:39] today. Meet every need that's here
[1:06:40] present. Lord, go beyond my own ability.
[1:06:43] Father, take my voice, my tongue, my
[1:06:45] thoughts, Lord, my body. Lord Jesus,
[1:06:48] take it in your hands and use it as you
[1:06:50] see fit. For, Father, I'm unable in
[1:06:52] myself to help any one person. But Lord
[1:06:55] Jesus, you are more than able. Father,
[1:06:58] we commit them now into your hands in
[1:07:00] the lovely name of our Lord Jesus
[1:07:01] Christ. Amen.
[1:07:04] Amen. God bless you. You may have your
[1:07:06] seats if you'd like. As I said, I was
[1:07:09] just reading in the back and there's
[1:07:10] notes I have and things, but as as we
[1:07:13] just wait upon the Lord, you know, you
[1:07:14] read this in Hebrews chapter 6, Paul
[1:07:17] begins to speak about different things.
[1:07:19] And often times we spend so much time
[1:07:22] laying foundations and wondering. And he
[1:07:24] says, "But therefore, leaving the
[1:07:26] principles of the doctrine of Christ,
[1:07:28] let us go on into perfection, not laying
[1:07:30] again the foundation." In other words,
[1:07:32] he says, listen, it's not that we do
[1:07:34] away with them. It's not that we do away
[1:07:36] with the principles of God. We don't do
[1:07:39] away with holiness. We don't do away
[1:07:41] with living right, with justification,
[1:07:43] with sanctification. We don't even do
[1:07:45] away with the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:47] All of these things are important, but
[1:07:49] he says we don't need to lay it every
[1:07:51] service. We don't need to lay it every
[1:07:53] day. He says it's time to build. And
[1:07:55] we've had a master builder in our day as
[1:07:58] we appreciate and we know we had a
[1:08:00] prophet that came in our day. Amen. We
[1:08:02] believe you got it written right there.
[1:08:04] Leodysia, the church age messenger,
[1:08:06] brother Brandham. Amen. And he came. He
[1:08:08] was a a master builder that was able to
[1:08:11] build upon and not just lay a
[1:08:12] foundation, but build a house. Build a
[1:08:15] build turn a corner and not just build a
[1:08:18] wall, but build a something that could
[1:08:20] house somebody. Something that you could
[1:08:22] step into, something that could be a
[1:08:24] dwelling place, something that God could
[1:08:26] come into and God could fulfill his
[1:08:28] word. Amen. He laid, in other words, as
[1:08:31] it was, the blueprints that you and I
[1:08:33] could build a house for God. Amen. As he
[1:08:36] said in in he preached the message,
[1:08:38] "What house will you build me?" He
[1:08:39] titled it that thy house. He called in
[1:08:42] one place. We're looking not just to to
[1:08:44] to look upon a house. Amen. We don't
[1:08:48] want to be uh sorry for saying it this
[1:08:49] way, bums on the street.
[1:08:52] Looking at somebody in a house saying,
[1:08:53] "I wish I could." But he says, "What
[1:08:56] will you do? Will you build a house?
[1:08:59] We've laid a foundation. You I've
[1:09:01] repented. I've given my life to Christ.
[1:09:04] But are you building upon that?
[1:09:05] Something that goes beyond just a
[1:09:08] foundation, just a hole in the ground,
[1:09:09] but rather come to a place of
[1:09:12] perfection. Amen. Perfection isn't to be
[1:09:15] without mistake, but rather that that is
[1:09:18] maybe one interpretation of it, but
[1:09:19] perfection is also completion. Come to a
[1:09:22] place of completion. Come to a place
[1:09:24] where God says, "This is the thoughts
[1:09:26] that I have towards you." Amen. Because
[1:09:29] we are a part of the thoughts of God.
[1:09:32] Amen. God had thoughts that are eternal.
[1:09:36] I'm just quoting to you out of the
[1:09:37] church age book. God's thoughts are
[1:09:39] eternal thoughts. He cannot think a new
[1:09:41] thought. Amen. He's He's eternal. In
[1:09:44] other words, if God ever thought of you,
[1:09:46] you were always on his mind. Amen. You
[1:09:48] You aren't a thought that he just had
[1:09:50] one day when you become born. Brother
[1:09:52] Peter, God didn't think, "Oh, yeah,
[1:09:53] Peter Girtson." No, you were a thought
[1:09:55] of God before the foundation of the
[1:09:57] world. Amen. And this just was the time
[1:10:00] that God had to manifest that thought.
[1:10:03] God had to bring you to a place. Amen.
[1:10:06] Because he had thoughts of Paul. But
[1:10:08] this isn't Paul's day. Amen. He had
[1:10:11] thoughts of of of of Irenius. But this
[1:10:13] isn't Irenous days. He had these
[1:10:14] thoughts of Polycarp and of Martin and
[1:10:17] of of Columba and of Luther and all of
[1:10:19] the different messengers and the saints
[1:10:21] that would come out in those days. All
[1:10:22] of them a part of the gentile bride in
[1:10:24] their age. But in this age, God still
[1:10:27] had thoughts to be expressed. Amen. And
[1:10:30] as he says in Romans chapter 8, that all
[1:10:32] of creation was groaning for the
[1:10:34] manifestation of the sons of God. Amen.
[1:10:37] That word there, manifestation, as it
[1:10:39] reads in Romans chapter 8, you can pick
[1:10:41] it up when you go home. Romans chapter 8
[1:10:43] says, it's manifestation. That's the way
[1:10:46] the King James version reads it. But if
[1:10:47] you go back into the Greek, it's the
[1:10:49] word apocalypsis.
[1:10:51] In other words, apocalypsis is
[1:10:53] revelation. that creation was groaning
[1:10:56] for the revelation of the sons of God.
[1:10:59] In other words, all through seven ages,
[1:11:01] there's been sons being made manifest,
[1:11:03] but the fullness of the revelation of
[1:11:06] what a son of God is had not yet come.
[1:11:09] Amen. It took a master builder. It took
[1:11:12] a prophet to come in our day in this age
[1:11:15] to bring forth by spiritual revelation
[1:11:19] what a son of God really is. Who we
[1:11:22] really are, who we were in the thoughts
[1:11:24] of God and what we're going back to.
[1:11:27] Because the only way you can go back to
[1:11:28] God is to be in the thoughts of God in
[1:11:31] the first place. Hallelujah.
[1:11:35] See, what about salvation? Yes, there's
[1:11:37] those that will be saved, but the bride
[1:11:39] of Christ
[1:11:41] is a elected
[1:11:43] eternal thought of God.
[1:11:46] Amen. That has come forth in her decreed
[1:11:49] season.
[1:11:50] Amen. And we today are living in a in a
[1:11:53] in a great place, a great plateau of
[1:11:57] privilege that God has given the
[1:12:00] revelation of what the sons of God
[1:12:03] really are. Amen. Not just laying a
[1:12:06] foundation again, just repent. Just
[1:12:09] repent. Just get right with God. But go
[1:12:12] beyond that. Come up into heavenly
[1:12:14] places. Understand who you really are in
[1:12:17] God. Understand that all that Adam lost
[1:12:21] is come back into the hands of the
[1:12:23] believer. That as he stood there in
[1:12:26] perfection, as he was there in the
[1:12:28] Garden of Eden, oh, think of the love
[1:12:30] that Adam had. Adam lived in perfect
[1:12:33] perfection,
[1:12:34] but in all of that perfection, he was
[1:12:37] looking around and he said, "But I don't
[1:12:39] have a helpmate, but there's nothing
[1:12:41] that I could have fellowship with on the
[1:12:44] same level as me." He could have
[1:12:47] fellowship with with the lion and with
[1:12:49] the dog and with the cat and with the
[1:12:51] the orangutang. He could even have
[1:12:52] fellowship with the serpent. The serpent
[1:12:55] in of itself was not evil. It wasn't
[1:12:57] until Satan entered into it.
[1:13:00] So he could have fellowship with him and
[1:13:02] he could talk. But he realized there's
[1:13:03] nobody that really understands me. I
[1:13:06] want to help make for myself. And God
[1:13:08] had to put him to sleep and take from
[1:13:10] his own side. Take Eve. And because of
[1:13:12] that, there came such a love that Adam
[1:13:14] loved Eve that Adam chose. When Eve
[1:13:16] fell, Adam was not deceived. Eve was
[1:13:19] deceived. And Adam chose.
[1:13:22] Hallelujah.
[1:13:24] He chose to fall. He chose love. He
[1:13:27] chose the object of his love over
[1:13:30] perfection.
[1:13:32] He chose to go out of the garden with
[1:13:34] Eve because that was the very object of
[1:13:37] his love. He loved that more.
[1:13:40] Oh my. Than everything that could be in
[1:13:42] perfect order. He could speak and it
[1:13:44] would be and he could do anything
[1:13:46] because he was the son of God and he was
[1:13:49] in his perfect state. But he said no
[1:13:51] without that.
[1:13:53] And that was the first Adam. By one all
[1:13:56] man fell, but by one salvation was
[1:13:59] wrought. The second Adam, Jesus Christ,
[1:14:03] that when he came forth, why? Because
[1:14:06] God living in perfection,
[1:14:09] God living in the seventh dimension, God
[1:14:11] living where there was no sin, there was
[1:14:14] nothing that could possibly go wrong. He
[1:14:16] wasn't content with just being there.
[1:14:19] The object of his love was lost.
[1:14:24] The thoughts of God had gone astray.
[1:14:27] There were thoughts that was being made
[1:14:28] manifest, but God had to come to redeem
[1:14:31] them back to himself because he wasn't
[1:14:34] willing to just be there with no
[1:14:36] fellowship.
[1:14:38] God desired fellowship.
[1:14:41] Well, there's no big eyes or little U's
[1:14:43] in God. The Bible says there's no bond
[1:14:46] or free.
[1:14:48] Sometimes we look at it and we look at a
[1:14:50] brother that not he understands all
[1:14:51] mystery and he's he's just got such
[1:14:53] revelation and we want to be like him
[1:14:55] and he's such a wonderful brother but
[1:14:57] that doesn't make him any greater than
[1:14:58] the one who can't put two sentences
[1:15:00] together without stumbling over his own
[1:15:02] words. And the trap of the devil with
[1:15:04] that man is that he gets lifted up in
[1:15:06] his knowledge and thinks I'm somebody.
[1:15:08] And the trap of the devil in the other
[1:15:10] man is that he gets down on himself and
[1:15:11] says I'm nobody. No, they're both a son
[1:15:14] of God. They're both in the thoughts of
[1:15:17] God. They both are equally as important
[1:15:20] to God. Amen. Oh my. Felio love. Our
[1:15:24] love. I I don't I I don't not have any
[1:15:26] notes this morning. I've got a lot
[1:15:28] sitting right here, but I'm just kind of
[1:15:30] preaching. Hope that's okay. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:33] Felio love is quite easy to get into a
[1:15:36] trap.
[1:15:38] Where we love this one because they are
[1:15:41] more precious to us. They may have done
[1:15:43] things that please us more than the
[1:15:45] other person. So we love that person
[1:15:48] more. That's felio love. That's not
[1:15:52] God's love. That's a perverted love.
[1:15:55] Yeah. Brother Brandham says that that
[1:15:57] felio love will make a man when when
[1:15:59] someone insults his wife, he'll want to
[1:16:00] go cute that man because he insulted his
[1:16:03] wife. That's felio love. But agapo love
[1:16:05] doesn't do that. A goppo love would have
[1:16:07] that man pray for the other man
[1:16:12] because that's the love of God that God
[1:16:14] looks at. He says it does to him. He
[1:16:16] loves them because they're his. We love
[1:16:19] him because he first loved us. Amen. The
[1:16:22] Bible says in John 3:16, God so loved
[1:16:25] the world that he gave his only begotten
[1:16:27] son. And and the world of the the
[1:16:29] nominal church takes that scripture on
[1:16:31] such a face value and they want to say
[1:16:33] God loved the world. God loves
[1:16:34] everybody. And you can take it at that
[1:16:37] value, but it's showing you deeper into
[1:16:39] the thoughts of God. God loved his
[1:16:41] creation, not the perversion. God loved
[1:16:44] the world. The one that he said in the
[1:16:46] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:16:48] the earth and he saw that it was good.
[1:16:52] Amen. God loved that and he just gave
[1:16:54] his only begotten son for what purpose?
[1:16:56] To redeem it back to the original
[1:16:59] creation. To redeem fallen souls back to
[1:17:03] what they were always meant to be. So
[1:17:05] that you as a son of God could come back
[1:17:07] to what Adam lost. So that you could
[1:17:10] speak like Adam could speak. So that you
[1:17:13] could believe like Adam could believe.
[1:17:15] So you could have faith. So that Christ
[1:17:17] in you, the hope of glory, wouldn't just
[1:17:20] be just a hope, but it would be a faith.
[1:17:24] Because faith is a revelation.
[1:17:26] Hope is an expectation.
[1:17:29] When you have hope of something, you
[1:17:31] have an expectation of that thing to
[1:17:33] come to pass. But a revelation of
[1:17:35] something is a reality.
[1:17:37] It's something that's real to you. It
[1:17:40] goes beyond just what I'm expecting
[1:17:41] them, but you know it's going to happen
[1:17:44] because that's what faith does. Faith is
[1:17:47] the substance of things hoped for.
[1:17:52] Oh, hallelujah. Amen.
[1:17:55] We're not laying again the foundation of
[1:17:57] of repentance from dead works and of
[1:18:00] faith toward God, of the doctrines of
[1:18:02] baptism, of laying on of hands, and of
[1:18:05] resurrection of the dead and of eternal
[1:18:07] judgment. In other words, he's saying,
[1:18:08] "Listen, these things are a foundational
[1:18:10] doctrine.
[1:18:12] The doctrines of baptism, repent every
[1:18:14] one of you, be baptized in the name of
[1:18:16] the Lord Jesus Christ." He says, "That's
[1:18:18] foundational."
[1:18:20] So, when people get all worked up, I'm
[1:18:22] just going to say it this way. I hope I
[1:18:23] have enough liberty here. When people
[1:18:25] get all worked up and say, "Well, you
[1:18:27] know, the denominational churches,
[1:18:28] they're really good people." They are
[1:18:30] good people, but they're still fighting
[1:18:32] over the right way to be baptized.
[1:18:34] The Bible says that's a foundation.
[1:18:38] They haven't got past pouring the
[1:18:40] concrete in the hole.
[1:18:43] They're still trying to figure out, do
[1:18:45] you need the keyway? Do you make the 90°
[1:18:47] here? What do we use? 2x4s, 2x6, 2x8? I
[1:18:50] don't know. He says that's foundational.
[1:18:53] It's the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:56] Amen. You shall receive the gift of the
[1:18:58] Holy Ghost. He says, "And of the
[1:18:59] resurrection of the dead." The Sadducees
[1:19:01] couldn't get past that.
[1:19:04] They couldn't. The Pharisees believed
[1:19:05] that in the resurrection, the Sadducees
[1:19:07] didn't believe. That's why they were
[1:19:08] sad, you see, because they didn't
[1:19:10] believe that you could be resurrected
[1:19:11] from the dead. They didn't see all that.
[1:19:13] They couldn't go past just a
[1:19:14] foundational doctrine. They were stuck
[1:19:17] on that. Lord, help us that we don't
[1:19:19] become stuck on something. Amen.
[1:19:23] He says, "And of eternal judgment,
[1:19:27] that God is the judge."
[1:19:30] Amen. That God has eternal salvation.
[1:19:33] God has eternal judgment. We can't get
[1:19:35] past. What are they still stuck on? Is
[1:19:36] there really predestination?
[1:19:39] How could somebody be predestinated? How
[1:19:41] could somebody else be lost? And do they
[1:19:43] not even the mind of God? No, they
[1:19:45] weren't.
[1:19:47] But all life comes from God. Uh-huh.
[1:19:50] Because God's the giver of life. But God
[1:19:51] also put laws in place.
[1:19:58] He says, "But it's impossible."
[1:20:01] He says, "And this will we do if God
[1:20:04] permit." In other words, listen, we
[1:20:06] can't get beyond the foundation if it
[1:20:07] wasn't for God.
[1:20:12] That's why they're still struggling.
[1:20:13] Many people are still struggling over
[1:20:15] the foundation because they kicked God
[1:20:16] out.
[1:20:18] That's what Revelations chapter 3 says.
[1:20:20] He's on the outside of the church
[1:20:21] knocking, trying to get back in. They
[1:20:24] kicked Christ out and then they're
[1:20:25] trying to get beyond the finishes. If
[1:20:26] God permit, we'll get beyond it. But
[1:20:28] without God, we're not going to get
[1:20:30] beyond that. It takes Christ. It takes
[1:20:32] that original revelation that you must
[1:20:35] be born again. Amen. It takes the spirit
[1:20:38] of God, the comforter to lead and guide
[1:20:40] you into all truth. Amen. That's not
[1:20:43] some fuzzy wuzzy wish I was a but rather
[1:20:46] it's the living God coming into an
[1:20:48] individual and making it a reality more
[1:20:52] real than what you see with your eyes.
[1:20:55] Amen. That the six sense goes beyond the
[1:20:58] five senses of the flesh. They said, "I
[1:21:00] don't smell it. I don't see it. I don't
[1:21:02] hear it. I don't touch it. I don't any
[1:21:03] of these things." But the six sense says
[1:21:05] it's real. Just like it was for Abraham
[1:21:08] who believed in hope against hope.
[1:21:10] Against hope, he believed in hope. In
[1:21:12] other words, when people said there is
[1:21:14] no hope. How can you expect to have a
[1:21:16] child? Abraham says, "I'm expecting it
[1:21:18] any day now because he said so."
[1:21:21] Regardless of what the senses say,
[1:21:23] regardless of the deadness of Sarah's
[1:21:25] womb, regardless of how much anybody
[1:21:27] would want to say, it's impossible. God
[1:21:30] says it's possible and with God all
[1:21:32] things are possible. Amen. To him who
[1:21:35] would believe all things
[1:21:39] are possible.
[1:21:41] Oh hallelujah. It's impossible though
[1:21:43] for those who were once enlightened. Oh
[1:21:46] my. It's impossible for those who God
[1:21:49] showed himself to who God shone the
[1:21:52] light upon them and they tasted of the
[1:21:56] heavenly gift. They were made partakers
[1:21:58] of the Holy Ghost. Oh my. But they
[1:22:02] couldn't go all the way. They couldn't
[1:22:04] surrender themselves to it. They tasted
[1:22:06] of it. They seen that it was real. They
[1:22:08] knew that it was true. They knew that
[1:22:10] there was a kingdom to come. They tasted
[1:22:12] the good word of God and the powers of
[1:22:15] the world to come. Think of Judas for a
[1:22:17] minute.
[1:22:21] A man that tasted the powers of the
[1:22:23] kingdom that was to come. a man that God
[1:22:26] gave him. Christ gave him power to go
[1:22:30] and cast out devils
[1:22:32] and he was with them rejoicing as they
[1:22:35] came back and they said they were
[1:22:36] rejoicing when they came back to Jesus
[1:22:38] said and the devils are subject to us.
[1:22:42] Jesus says don't rejoice because of that
[1:22:44] but rejoice because your names are
[1:22:46] written in heaven. Amen. There's a
[1:22:49] greater rejoicing than just, oh my, the
[1:22:52] devils are such. Of course, there's
[1:22:53] something to do. I beheld Satan fall
[1:22:55] from heaven as lightning. I was the one
[1:22:58] that kicked him out of heaven. Of
[1:22:59] course, when I give you power over him,
[1:23:01] he has to go because there's no other
[1:23:04] name, the name of Jesus Christ. It has
[1:23:07] to happen that way. I was there in the
[1:23:09] beginning. I was there that kicked him
[1:23:10] out. I'm the one that's here to redeem
[1:23:13] you back to where I was. That where I
[1:23:15] am, you may be also. Hallelujah.
[1:23:19] He says, "Show us the Father." He says,
[1:23:21] "I've been so long with you and you
[1:23:23] haven't known me. The Father's right
[1:23:26] here." Oh, glory be to God.
[1:23:32] He says they tasted of it. Judas tasted
[1:23:35] of it, but oh, he couldn't go all the
[1:23:37] way. He couldn't, in other words, get
[1:23:40] rid of his own ideas to go with it.
[1:23:44] He had to figure it out.
[1:23:48] Judas figuring it out
[1:23:52] thought he could betray Jesus for money
[1:23:55] and Jesus would get through it.
[1:23:59] This is the way Satan always works.
[1:24:02] He never shows you the end result.
[1:24:06] He works in your reasonings
[1:24:08] to try and make you think it's going to
[1:24:11] work out all right. If you just do this
[1:24:15] and before you know it, the Bible says
[1:24:16] sin will take you further than you want
[1:24:19] to go. Sin will take you further than
[1:24:22] you ever conceived that it would.
[1:24:26] But you know the beautiful thing about
[1:24:28] it, the grace of God, no matter how deep
[1:24:31] in sin you are,
[1:24:33] his grace can reach you. Amen.
[1:24:37] Amen.
[1:24:39] Judas could have had time to repent
[1:24:44] right there at the last supper when
[1:24:46] Jesus said, "The one that I saw that I
[1:24:48] hand this up to."
[1:24:51] Haven't you ever wondered why didn't
[1:24:52] Judas say, "No, thank you. I'm out."
[1:24:57] Because there was something in there
[1:24:58] that just couldn't.
[1:25:01] Just I I just have to do this. Why the
[1:25:03] predition? the son of predition. The
[1:25:06] evil one entered into him in that
[1:25:07] moment. He gave himself over to a
[1:25:10] different spirit. Regardless of the
[1:25:12] power, regardless of all of the the the
[1:25:15] goodness of God, the word of God that
[1:25:17] he's he manifested and the the thousands
[1:25:19] healed. And John would say the books
[1:25:21] couldn't contain it. If we wrote all the
[1:25:23] miracles that Christ did, all of the
[1:25:25] wonderful things, it couldn't contain
[1:25:27] the whole of it. Judas was there for
[1:25:30] that.
[1:25:33] But blessed are your eyes.
[1:25:37] Blessed are you who have not seen and
[1:25:39] yet believe.
[1:25:42] Blessed are you who have not seen. I I
[1:25:44] was wasn't there in the meetings of
[1:25:45] brother Brandham. I wasn't there for all
[1:25:48] of these mighty miracles. I wasn't there
[1:25:49] in the time of Christ, but I believe it.
[1:25:52] I know it's true. I know it's real
[1:25:54] because God showed me. Because God made
[1:25:57] it real. There's a faith in my heart
[1:25:58] that goes beyond the five senses.
[1:26:07] He says, "That's an that's a
[1:26:09] foundational doctrine, eternal judgment,
[1:26:12] that God knew who Judas was and he chose
[1:26:15] him anyways."
[1:26:18] Hallelujah.
[1:26:22] He says, "If they should fall away, it's
[1:26:25] impossible for them if they should fall
[1:26:27] away to renew them again to repentance.
[1:26:31] For they crucify to themselves the son
[1:26:34] of God aresh and put him to an open
[1:26:38] shame. The Brown preaches the message
[1:26:40] and he says he's either on your heart or
[1:26:44] he's on your hands.
[1:26:47] Talks about Pilate,
[1:26:49] how Pilate tried to wash the blood of
[1:26:51] Christ off his hands. He said couldn't
[1:26:53] do it.
[1:26:54] No matter how hard he tried, there was
[1:26:56] no way that water could wash that blood
[1:26:59] from his hands. So you need to accept
[1:27:01] him into your heart.
[1:27:04] He says, "For the earth which drinkketh
[1:27:06] in the rain,
[1:27:08] the earth," in other words, Paul begins
[1:27:10] to draw a type and a parable to show
[1:27:13] there's something that that shows when
[1:27:15] the earth receives rain, it brings forth
[1:27:17] hurts.
[1:27:19] He said, "But yet when some people
[1:27:21] receive the reign of the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:23] the blessings of God, they refuse to
[1:27:26] bring forth." He says, "But the earth
[1:27:29] also will bring forth thorns."
[1:27:32] Right? How many you ever grown a garden
[1:27:35] before?
[1:27:37] How many of you planted thorns?
[1:27:40] How many all planted the quack grass and
[1:27:43] all the things that you just can't wait
[1:27:45] to get out of there? But it comes
[1:27:47] anyways.
[1:27:50] It's just there and it's growing up and
[1:27:51] you got your potatoes and you got your
[1:27:52] corn, you got everything else. You're
[1:27:53] like, man, this is fantastic, but I
[1:27:54] always out there weeding,
[1:27:57] pulling it out, getting rid of this.
[1:27:58] It's choking out the life. It's taking
[1:28:00] the nutrients. It's getting rid of the
[1:28:02] things that should go into my vegetables
[1:28:03] that I would one day eat, but now I got
[1:28:05] all this junk growing up with. I didn't
[1:28:06] plant you here. He says, "But it
[1:28:09] happens." It's the same thing. God says,
[1:28:11] "In the last days, I'll pour out my
[1:28:13] spirit upon all flesh."
[1:28:16] Some will bring forth thorns and
[1:28:17] thistles. Some will bring forth the good
[1:28:19] wheat and the grain. It's going to
[1:28:20] happen. He says, "But they'll grow
[1:28:23] together until the end time. But the end
[1:28:25] of the thorns and thistles is to be
[1:28:28] burned.
[1:28:29] But not that's not the end of the wheat.
[1:28:32] That's not the end of the corn. That's
[1:28:34] not the end of the good harvest." I
[1:28:36] wonder if we wouldn't turn with me to
[1:28:37] Isaiah chapter 55. If you would
[1:28:53] chapter 55 says, my Bible titles this as
[1:28:56] the great invitation.
[1:28:59] It says, "Oh, everyone that thirsteth,
[1:29:02] come ye to the waters.
[1:29:05] It doesn't differentiate and say, "Well,
[1:29:08] the good ones will take at the waters.
[1:29:09] The bad ones, you stay away. Everyone
[1:29:12] that's thirsty.
[1:29:14] If you want more of God, come to the
[1:29:16] waters." If you need more of Christ,
[1:29:18] come to the water. He says, "And he that
[1:29:21] hath no money, sorry, it's too expensive
[1:29:23] for you."
[1:29:25] No, it says, "Come, ye, buy, and eat."
[1:29:29] He says, "But I don't have no money." In
[1:29:31] other words, you can't buy it with
[1:29:32] money. It's free. Come and eat. Yay.
[1:29:35] Come and buy wine and milk without money
[1:29:39] and without price. What an invitation.
[1:29:42] Come and dine. The master callth. Come
[1:29:44] and dine. Jesus has a table spread where
[1:29:47] the saints of God are fed. Amen. Is it
[1:29:49] all saints feeding there? No. There was
[1:29:51] a Judas at the table. There was somebody
[1:29:54] else. But says there's three kinds of
[1:29:55] believers in every church. They're there
[1:29:57] feasting and picking and choosing. I
[1:29:58] want this. I don't want that. I'll take
[1:30:00] this, but don't take that. But there's a
[1:30:02] real believer that's saying, "Lord, fill
[1:30:04] my cup. Fill my plate. Let me eat it
[1:30:06] all. Whatever you have for me, Lord, I
[1:30:08] want to take it all in. Come on down. I
[1:30:11] don't have anything to offer. I don't
[1:30:13] got money. I don't got anything of
[1:30:15] value, but you're going to give me the
[1:30:16] wine, the stimulation of revelation."
[1:30:19] Oh, even so, come Lord Jesus. Says,
[1:30:22] "Wherefore do you spend money for that
[1:30:24] which is not bread?"
[1:30:26] Oh, isn't that just a type of our day?
[1:30:30] people feeding on all kinds of things,
[1:30:33] spending money on subscriptions for all
[1:30:36] kinds of spiritual food, but it isn't
[1:30:39] spiritual food. It's just poison.
[1:30:43] How many of you want to go in at a
[1:30:45] restaurant that just feeds rat poison?
[1:30:48] 50 bucks a plate.
[1:30:50] Here, take my money. No, you wouldn't do
[1:30:53] that. What? What was wrong with this
[1:30:54] place? You guys are insane.
[1:30:57] Well, that's the war we're living in.
[1:30:59] here. You pay for this subscription,
[1:31:01] that subscription. You watch sports and
[1:31:03] it comes with all of the entertainments
[1:31:05] and the commercials and you can watch
[1:31:06] movies and you can watch Netflix and you
[1:31:08] can go ahead on this one and this social
[1:31:10] media and that one and this one and all
[1:31:12] these different things. You spend money
[1:31:13] for something that ain't feeding your
[1:31:15] soul,
[1:31:16] but it's killing you.
[1:31:21] He says, "You spend money for that which
[1:31:23] is not bread, and your labor for that
[1:31:25] which satisfaithth not. Hearken
[1:31:27] diligently unto me. Eat ye that which is
[1:31:30] good, and let your soul delight itself
[1:31:33] in fatness. Incline your ear, and come
[1:31:36] unto me, hear, and your soul shall
[1:31:40] live."
[1:31:42] Faith comes by hearing, hearing by the
[1:31:44] word of God. Hallelujah. You need to
[1:31:46] hear the word. Why do we preach on some
[1:31:48] things? so often. Why? Because faith
[1:31:51] comes by hearing. Why do we preach you
[1:31:54] must be born again so often? Because
[1:31:56] faith comes by hearing. Faith is a
[1:31:59] revelation. You're not going to get that
[1:32:00] revelation unless you hear it. The rest
[1:32:02] is how would they heard? And but the
[1:32:04] Bible says Paul teaches how would they
[1:32:06] hear unless somebody went and preached.
[1:32:07] Unless there was a minister to go and
[1:32:09] share the gospel. How would they hear
[1:32:10] it? It takes somebody to minister the
[1:32:13] word of God. So that way there could be
[1:32:15] a hearing of the word. Amen. Not just a
[1:32:18] written word, but a spoken word that
[1:32:20] would take a re residence in your soul
[1:32:24] that you could believe on it and rejoice
[1:32:27] in the fatness of it that you should
[1:32:28] live. And I will make you an everlasting
[1:32:31] covenant with you, even the sure mercies
[1:32:34] of David. Behold, I have given him for a
[1:32:37] witness to the people, a leader and
[1:32:39] commander to the people. Behold. Oh my
[1:32:43] David. We've heard. We've received the
[1:32:45] son of David. Jesus Christ. The real
[1:32:48] general.
[1:32:50] Oh, hallelujah. Amen. Sometimes we get a
[1:32:53] little too worked up about other men.
[1:32:56] That man's a general. That man's a
[1:32:57] general. We have one general.
[1:33:00] That's Christ.
[1:33:03] Amen. If he decides to use a man to lead
[1:33:05] God's people, wonderful. That's Christ.
[1:33:10] Sorry, I just threw that in there. If
[1:33:11] you want to throw that out, take it as a
[1:33:13] pit. That's fine.
[1:33:15] He says, "Behold, thou shalt call a
[1:33:17] nation that thou knowest not. And
[1:33:20] nations that knew thee knew not thee
[1:33:24] shall run unto thee, because the Lord
[1:33:27] thy God, and for the holy one of Israel,
[1:33:30] for he said, for he hath glorified
[1:33:33] thee." People who didn't know God, who's
[1:33:36] that? Gentiles,
[1:33:38] nations that didn't know God. That's you
[1:33:41] and me, brothers, sisters.
[1:33:44] But he says, "I'm calling them, and
[1:33:45] they'll run to the Lord." Amen. Seek ye
[1:33:49] the Lord while he may be found. Call ye
[1:33:53] upon him while he is near. That's why we
[1:33:57] encourage you at the end of a service
[1:33:58] while Lord is near. If you need
[1:33:59] something, just raise your hand. Just
[1:34:01] come to the altar. Call on God. Call on
[1:34:03] him while he is near. Don't wait till
[1:34:05] you're out there again and going, "Oh,
[1:34:07] God, why didn't I?" No. Do it now.
[1:34:10] Take what you have need of. Taste and
[1:34:12] see that the Lord is good. Amen. He
[1:34:15] says, "Let the wicked forsake his way
[1:34:17] and the unrighteous man his thoughts.
[1:34:20] Let him return unto the Lord, and he
[1:34:23] will have mercy upon him. Blessed be the
[1:34:26] name of the Lord. Let the unrighteous
[1:34:29] man I've walked in a perverse way,
[1:34:31] Brother Andrew. Then turn to God. Repent
[1:34:34] of your ways. Go back unto him. Amen. He
[1:34:36] says, "He will have mercy upon him and
[1:34:38] the Lord, and he will abundantly pardon.
[1:34:41] For my thoughts are not your thoughts."
[1:34:43] Amen. Neither are your ways my ways,
[1:34:46] sayaeth the Lord. Hallelujah. He's got a
[1:34:49] higher way. I'm talking about in Isaiah,
[1:34:52] we're talking about there's a way and
[1:34:53] there is a highway. Amen. Not a
[1:34:55] four-lane highway, but there is a
[1:34:57] highway. A place that God says none can
[1:34:59] walk up there, but the pure in heart.
[1:35:02] Amen.
[1:35:04] He says, "And as the heavens are higher
[1:35:06] than the earth, my ways are higher than
[1:35:08] your ways, my thoughts than your
[1:35:10] thoughts, but as the rain cometh down."
[1:35:14] I love this scripture. Sometimes we stop
[1:35:16] at the one before. Yep. God's higher
[1:35:18] than us. We'll never understand.
[1:35:21] But as the rain,
[1:35:24] for as the rain cometh down, and and the
[1:35:27] snow from heaven and returnneeth not
[1:35:30] thither. Oh, hallelujah. Once God gives
[1:35:33] a revelation, he doesn't pull it back
[1:35:34] again. Ah, they weren't ready for it.
[1:35:36] No, no. Once he gives it, he says,
[1:35:38] "Receive it. Don't let it go to waste.
[1:35:40] I've given it to you. As it comes down,
[1:35:42] I'm not pulling it back up. It's for
[1:35:43] you. Drink it up. You can't buy it.
[1:35:47] Drink the wine. Drink it to rejoice in
[1:35:49] the fatness."
[1:35:50] He says, "As the rain cometh down the
[1:35:52] snow from heaven and returneth not
[1:35:54] thither, but waterth the earth, and
[1:35:55] maketh it bring forth and bud."
[1:35:59] I love how it says and it gives it
[1:36:00] doesn't say it gives it a chance. Says
[1:36:03] it makes it.
[1:36:06] It makes it. A believer can't help it.
[1:36:09] The good soil can't help but produce.
[1:36:12] There's something about a real believer
[1:36:14] that can't help but say amen because
[1:36:16] it's a predestinated seed that God put
[1:36:18] in there that when the word goes forth,
[1:36:20] it responds. Something on the inside,
[1:36:22] deep, deep on the inside that when it
[1:36:24] hears the word, it just says amen. Amen.
[1:36:27] I don't know how. I don't know why. I
[1:36:30] don't understand it. I can't explain it.
[1:36:32] But it's true. Amen.
[1:36:36] He says, "It makes it bring forth and
[1:36:39] bud that it may give seed to the sewer
[1:36:43] and bread to the eater." Other words,
[1:36:46] it's not just for beauty. It's got a
[1:36:49] purpose.
[1:36:52] So shall my word be that goeth forth out
[1:36:55] of my mouth. It will not return unto me
[1:36:59] void. Amen. Hallelujah. It shall
[1:37:02] accomplish that which I please. It shall
[1:37:05] prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
[1:37:10] God will have a bride. Amen. He will
[1:37:14] have a perfect, spotless, virtuous
[1:37:17] virgin bride because he sent forth the
[1:37:20] message of Malachi 4. He sent forth the
[1:37:23] seventh angel messenger that all the
[1:37:25] mystery of God should be finished. He
[1:37:27] says, "And it will it will prosper in
[1:37:30] the thing where I sent it to." Amen.
[1:37:33] Eleazar did not come back to Abraham
[1:37:36] saying, "I couldn't find nobody."
[1:37:39] No, he went and he found a Rebecca. He
[1:37:41] went and he found somebody. How did he
[1:37:43] find her? He prayed.
[1:37:46] He got on his knees and he had
[1:37:48] relationship with God. Amen. And he
[1:37:51] asked God, "Lord, let it be the right
[1:37:52] way one." That when I would ask, she
[1:37:54] would say, "Let me water your camel."
[1:37:56] And all the grace of God that he goes up
[1:37:58] to the first one.
[1:38:02] The Bible doesn't record anybody else.
[1:38:04] It's the first one that heard the word.
[1:38:07] God isn't wasting his time. Amen. He's
[1:38:10] not looking for another bride. Maybe
[1:38:12] we're not the first one. Maybe it's got
[1:38:13] to be. No, you're the one. God's not
[1:38:16] going to get rid of you and say, "All
[1:38:18] right, you didn't get it. Somebody
[1:38:19] else." know you're the one that said,
[1:38:21] "Yeah, I'll give you a drink and let me
[1:38:23] water your camels, too. Let me give
[1:38:25] glory where glory is due."
[1:38:29] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:38:33] says, "For ye shall go out with joy and
[1:38:36] be led forth with peace, and the
[1:38:39] mountains and the hills shall break
[1:38:41] forth before you into singing. And all
[1:38:44] the trees and the field shall clap their
[1:38:47] hands. Instead of the thorn shall come
[1:38:50] up the fur tree." Amen. And instead of
[1:38:53] the brier shall come up the myrtle tree.
[1:38:56] And it shall be to the Lord for a name
[1:38:58] and an everlasting sign that shall not
[1:39:01] be cut off. Oh, blessed be the name of
[1:39:04] the Lord that he will go forth. And he
[1:39:07] says, "This one, if the tree of life
[1:39:09] ever puts forth another branch, it will
[1:39:11] write a book of acts behind it." Amen.
[1:39:13] He says, "Men been plenty of them to be
[1:39:15] grafted in, grafted in." He says, "But
[1:39:17] this last day bride is a new branch that
[1:39:20] has come forth out of straight out of
[1:39:22] Christ. I am the vine. You are the
[1:39:25] branches. Amen. What does it produce?
[1:39:27] The original fruit. Oh, blessed be the
[1:39:31] name of the Lord. It produces the
[1:39:33] original fruit. Exactly what Adam was.
[1:39:36] Exactly what Eve was. This is the second
[1:39:38] Eve. And the B and Brother Brandon says,
[1:39:40] "This Eve will not fall." Oh,
[1:39:44] hallelujah. There's been brides, brides,
[1:39:46] churches, churches. But there's coming a
[1:39:48] bride. And she's here today. She's the
[1:39:50] first one that has received. There's
[1:39:53] been a lot that have heard, but the
[1:39:54] first one that received it into her
[1:39:57] heart, cuz that seed once it takes place
[1:39:59] into the soul, you can't receive another
[1:40:02] seed. There can't be another
[1:40:04] impregnation. Once she's pregnant with
[1:40:06] the word of God, she will bring forth
[1:40:08] the unadulterated pure word of God.
[1:40:11] Amen. There will be a fruit that will
[1:40:13] come forth just like it was a Solomon.
[1:40:17] That'll bring forth. Think of it that oh
[1:40:19] my lord who you have time for this. You
[1:40:23] with me still
[1:40:25] that as David
[1:40:28] looked out over and seen Bashibba,
[1:40:32] we look at it so many times from such a
[1:40:34] negative angle
[1:40:36] because David did approach it wrong.
[1:40:40] David desired to have Bashibba. But who
[1:40:42] is Bashibba? Bashibba was a Jew
[1:40:46] but she was married to a gentile.
[1:40:52] You as a son and daughter of God but the
[1:40:55] B says you always were a son.
[1:40:59] Other words your first nature was not
[1:41:01] gentile.
[1:41:03] Who you really are
[1:41:05] is heavenly. You're a heavenly being.
[1:41:09] But brother Brandham would say and in
[1:41:10] and in in I think it's invisible union
[1:41:12] or or it's in uh who is this MelkiseDC.
[1:41:14] He says but you are married by your
[1:41:17] first nature. You're married to this
[1:41:20] gentile nature. Amen. By your first
[1:41:23] birth, sorry. You're married to this
[1:41:25] gentile nature. Just like Bashibba was
[1:41:28] married to a gentile, but the king had
[1:41:31] desired her.
[1:41:34] You were born a natural birth buried to
[1:41:37] a gentile. But the king desired you
[1:41:41] because he saw something in you that
[1:41:43] wasn't gentile. It was him. It was what
[1:41:46] he desired all along. So he Christ made
[1:41:49] a way. The son of David made a way for
[1:41:51] you to kill
[1:41:54] your first nature. The says you can't
[1:41:58] just divorce it and come back to it. You
[1:42:00] can't. it'll produce a bastard child.
[1:42:03] That's the way it was with Basheba. That
[1:42:05] first child that was born, it had to
[1:42:07] die. Why? Because her first husband was
[1:42:09] still alive when it was conceived. It
[1:42:12] couldn't be the one. But when that
[1:42:14] husband was dead, and there was a union
[1:42:17] between the king and Basheba. Then there
[1:42:19] came forth one that brought on the
[1:42:21] millennium,
[1:42:23] a Solomon.
[1:42:25] Oh, hallelujah. When we die to ourselves
[1:42:29] and the first husband is dead, then we
[1:42:32] come into union with Jesus Christ. And
[1:42:35] that will produce the millennium seed
[1:42:38] that will pull the bride out of the
[1:42:40] world and right into a rapture.
[1:42:43] Oh, how he desires to be with you. Amen.
[1:42:49] Remember I preached a whole service and
[1:42:51] multiple times, multiple services
[1:42:53] actually around the world called thy
[1:42:55] husband calleth for thee.
[1:42:58] God desires to be with you. He wants
[1:43:02] fellowship with you. He's calling for
[1:43:04] you. He whom he forneew, he did
[1:43:07] predestinate to be conformed into the
[1:43:09] image of his son. Whom he did
[1:43:10] predestinate, he is also what? Called.
[1:43:13] And them who he called, he also
[1:43:15] justified. And them who he's justified,
[1:43:18] he has also glorified.
[1:43:21] Oh, hallelujah. When he justified you,
[1:43:23] it wasn't just as though. Brother
[1:43:25] Brandham says, "What is justification?"
[1:43:26] He says, "It's as though you never did
[1:43:28] it in the first place." But
[1:43:29] justification actually has two parts. It
[1:43:31] goes beyond that. Because to justify
[1:43:34] means to mean means to make make
[1:43:35] something just or to to to uh approve
[1:43:39] your choosing. When God justified you,
[1:43:42] he didn't just take away all the sin,
[1:43:44] but he said, "I'm justifying my choice.
[1:43:48] I'm justifying my calling that I have
[1:43:50] called you. And now by taking away your
[1:43:53] sin, I'm showing you it was me that did
[1:43:55] the calling. I'm showing you it was me
[1:43:57] that that did the choosing. It was me
[1:44:00] that did the election. Amen. And it's me
[1:44:03] that's already now not justified you,
[1:44:05] but has already glorified you." Because
[1:44:08] in the mind of God, it is a finished
[1:44:10] work. Let me say it this way. In the
[1:44:12] thoughts of God, you are not a sinner.
[1:44:16] In the thoughts of God, you are a son
[1:44:18] and daughter of God. You are a perfect,
[1:44:20] a completely whole son and daughter of
[1:44:23] God. As the Bible says in Hebrews
[1:44:25] chapter 6, it says, "Beloved, we are
[1:44:27] persuaded better things of you." Amen.
[1:44:31] Beloved, we're persuaded you will not
[1:44:34] taste and run away. You will not taste
[1:44:36] and not be able to renew again. But we
[1:44:38] are persuaded better things of you that
[1:44:40] you will be able to come to perfection
[1:44:44] because the thoughts of God of you are
[1:44:46] perfect thoughts. Amen. There's no
[1:44:48] perversion in God.
[1:44:51] Hallelujah. There's no perversion in
[1:44:53] God. He's a creator and he has created
[1:44:56] you a new creature in Christ Jesus by
[1:45:00] the power of his blood. Oh, if we don't
[1:45:03] have the token applied, I'd suggest we
[1:45:04] get it there.
[1:45:11] I'm persuaded better things of you. If
[1:45:13] you flip over in your Bible to Hebrews
[1:45:15] chapter 12, maybe we won't read too much
[1:45:17] of it, but it says it talks about the
[1:45:20] mountain that the Hebrews came to as
[1:45:22] they came to Mount Si and how that if
[1:45:24] anyone would touch it, how that they
[1:45:26] would be killed and how all of these
[1:45:28] things would happen. And it says in the
[1:45:30] sound, excuse me, and for ye, but he
[1:45:32] says, you are not come to the mount that
[1:45:35] might be touched. Amen. They came to a
[1:45:38] mountain that God had to tell them,
[1:45:40] don't touch it, but you are not come to
[1:45:42] that mountain. Hallelujah. Says, you are
[1:45:45] come to a different mountain. Remember
[1:45:48] there was a there was a vision that that
[1:45:50] that the or a dream that the king had of
[1:45:52] an image Nebuchadnezzar and Daniel
[1:45:54] interpreted the dream of an image that
[1:45:57] had a head of gold and it had silver and
[1:45:59] had brass and had iron and had feet. But
[1:46:02] he said in the end there was a rock that
[1:46:03] was hewing out without hands. And that
[1:46:05] rock came down and it shattered the the
[1:46:07] the whole image and the image was like a
[1:46:10] chaff from the wheat that was spread out
[1:46:11] in the wind. But what happened to that
[1:46:13] rock? It grew up into what? A mountain.
[1:46:16] a kingdom that cannot be destroyed. He
[1:46:20] says, "But you are come." He says, "You
[1:46:22] are not come to that mountain." He says,
[1:46:24] "And unto the and that bird to the
[1:46:27] mountain that might be touched with
[1:46:28] hands," he says, "and the burning of
[1:46:29] fire, nor the blackness, nor the
[1:46:31] darkness, nor the tempest, and of the
[1:46:33] sound of trumpets, and the voice of
[1:46:35] words, which voice they heard, which
[1:46:37] voice they that heard and treated, that
[1:46:38] the word might not be spoken to them
[1:46:41] anymore." Oh my, what a thought. We knew
[1:46:45] it was God's provided way. But God spoke
[1:46:47] out of the darkness, out of the
[1:46:48] mountain, and they said, "Don't let God
[1:46:50] speak anymore. Let Moses speak."
[1:46:54] But he says, "But I'm bringing it back
[1:46:56] around to something." Says, "For they
[1:46:58] could not endure that which was
[1:46:59] commanded. And if so much as the beast
[1:47:02] touch the mountain, it shall be stoned
[1:47:04] or thrust through with a dart. And so
[1:47:07] terrible was the sight thereof that
[1:47:09] Moses said, I exceedingly fear and
[1:47:11] quake." says, "But you are come unto
[1:47:14] Mount Zion." Amen. You are come to a
[1:47:18] spiritual mountain. You are come to one.
[1:47:21] He says, in other words, you didn't
[1:47:23] come. Look at what he lists out. You
[1:47:25] didn't come to the one that can be
[1:47:26] touched, the burning of fire, the
[1:47:28] blackness, the darkness, the tempest,
[1:47:30] the sound of trumpets, the voice of
[1:47:32] words, the voice that they heard and
[1:47:34] that that heard and treated that the
[1:47:35] word should not be spoken anymore. He
[1:47:37] says, "You're not come to these. Don't
[1:47:38] look for outward signs.
[1:47:41] Don't look, I need outward
[1:47:42] manifestation. I need this. I need that.
[1:47:44] He says, you're not come to that
[1:47:45] mountain. You're come to a different
[1:47:47] mountain. Well, just like Paul said,
[1:47:49] Hebrews chapter 6, the foundation of
[1:47:51] laying on of hands. Sometimes we need
[1:47:52] that. And we need to go back to that.
[1:47:53] That's still in the promise. But he says
[1:47:55] that was for the Jews. The Gentiles were
[1:47:58] to have faith in the word of God, to
[1:48:00] believe the word that's spoken, and it
[1:48:02] happened right there. Yes, the Bible is
[1:48:04] still true. It says, "Lay their hands
[1:48:05] upon the sick and they shall recover."
[1:48:07] It still applies. But you as being
[1:48:09] called as the son of God can go beyond
[1:48:11] that to step up in say Lord I claim it
[1:48:14] for myself cuz I have come to a mountain
[1:48:17] one that I can step into a spiritual
[1:48:21] mountain mount Zion that I am a part of
[1:48:24] to the city of the living God and the
[1:48:26] heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable
[1:48:28] company of angels to the general
[1:48:30] assembly of the of the and church of the
[1:48:33] firstborn which are written in heaven
[1:48:35] and to God the judge of all and to the
[1:48:37] spirit of just man made perfect. Oh, we
[1:48:41] could spend forever on each and every
[1:48:42] one of those. Says and the Jesus and to
[1:48:45] Jesus the mediator of the new covenant
[1:48:50] and to the blood of sprinkling
[1:48:54] that speaketh better things. Amen. I am
[1:48:58] persuaded
[1:49:00] better things of you because not why?
[1:49:03] Not because you're so great or I'm so
[1:49:06] great, but because of the blood
[1:49:09] of Jesus Christ that speaks better
[1:49:12] things than that of Abel speaks better
[1:49:15] things. Other words, it's not judgment,
[1:49:17] it's grace.
[1:49:19] Amen. See that you refuse not him that
[1:49:22] speaketh. For if they couldn't escape
[1:49:23] him that spake on earth, how much more
[1:49:25] shall we not escape? If we turn away
[1:49:27] from him that speaketh from heaven,
[1:49:28] whose voice then shook the earth, but
[1:49:31] now shall shake the not the earth only,
[1:49:33] but also heaven. And this word yet once
[1:49:36] more signify the removing of those
[1:49:39] things that are shaken. Amen. If you're
[1:49:42] not in Christ, there's a shaking. But
[1:49:45] why is it when I'm in Christ, I I don't
[1:49:47] feel this? I don't feel that. I I've
[1:49:49] wondered it sometimes and I've got
[1:49:50] around people go, "Are you sure about
[1:49:51] this? What about this? Have what about
[1:49:53] that?" and politics this and this one
[1:49:54] that and Trudeau and Carney and Trump
[1:49:57] and this and that and you look at it and
[1:49:59] you're shaking and you're worried and
[1:50:00] you're trembled and I go I
[1:50:04] don't worry me. I don't know why. It
[1:50:07] just doesn't. Why? Because I'm hidden
[1:50:10] away. There's a greater peace that's
[1:50:13] deeper than that. All these things and
[1:50:15] there are things you need to sometimes
[1:50:17] understand because we still live in this
[1:50:19] world. But rather, there's a piece that
[1:50:20] goes deeper to know that what it's God
[1:50:22] that gives and God that takes away.
[1:50:25] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:50:28] Just like Job who had to say that a man
[1:50:29] that had everything. And God took it all
[1:50:33] away. And what did he say? The Lord
[1:50:36] give,
[1:50:38] the Lord took away.
[1:50:40] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:50:43] Amen. And then God when he came to that
[1:50:46] revelation, when he God come down, oh,
[1:50:48] think of it. I'm feel like I'm all over
[1:50:50] the place. I trust this is okay. But
[1:50:52] when Job was there all down in the
[1:50:54] dumps, God came to him.
[1:50:58] He had three friends that came. They
[1:51:01] became known as accusers.
[1:51:04] You did this wrong. You did that wrong.
[1:51:05] You did this wrong. You did that wrong.
[1:51:07] Sometimes God lets us get to those low
[1:51:09] spots.
[1:51:10] But I'm I'm a son of God and I know I
[1:51:12] ought to be living above the world.
[1:51:14] Uhhuh. You ought to. But sometimes God
[1:51:18] leads us because he's wants to try you.
[1:51:24] What son is he who does not endure to
[1:51:26] chastisement?
[1:51:29] You have to go through that. You have to
[1:51:31] go through that chastisement. You know
[1:51:32] what that is? That's God saying, "You're
[1:51:35] worthy."
[1:51:38] That's God saying, "You're worth my
[1:51:39] time.
[1:51:41] You're worth the discipline."
[1:51:45] We discipline our own children after our
[1:51:47] own nature. As fathers and as mothers,
[1:51:50] we do that. Why? Because they're worth
[1:51:52] our time. We want to raise them, right?
[1:51:55] Amen. Brother Zigg, you raised Brother
[1:51:58] Steven, right? You raised Sister Ramona.
[1:52:00] You did a wonderful job. Your children,
[1:52:02] why? But they they required discipline,
[1:52:04] didn't they? They're not here, so I'll
[1:52:05] pick on them. They they they required
[1:52:07] that kind of discipline. They took that.
[1:52:09] Why? But they were worth your time. It
[1:52:12] was worth it in the end when you look at
[1:52:13] you see what God's using them for and
[1:52:15] doing different things. But you look and
[1:52:16] say, "Praise God. I I had a little part
[1:52:18] in that because I was able to raise them
[1:52:20] in the nurture and admonition of the
[1:52:22] Lord." Thank God for that. But God's
[1:52:23] saying, "You're worth my time.
[1:52:26] I'm going to put you through trials to
[1:52:28] try you and to make it hard on you. Why?
[1:52:30] Because you're worth my time to make
[1:52:32] sure my character is molded in you. to
[1:52:35] make sure that this gold that is tried
[1:52:37] in what? The fire. I counsel of you to
[1:52:39] buy of me gold tried in the fire. He
[1:52:41] said that's a that's a commandment to
[1:52:43] this age. You need the character of
[1:52:44] Christ. You need to get there. How am I
[1:52:46] going to do it? Suffering.
[1:52:50] That's exciting.
[1:52:53] But it's going to happen. How many ever
[1:52:56] had a trial?
[1:52:58] Yeah, we've all been there. We've all
[1:53:01] had those times we feel like, Lord, is
[1:53:02] this ever going to end? Job went through
[1:53:05] those kind of times. Lord, is this ever
[1:53:06] going to end? But God finally stood up
[1:53:08] and said, "Where were you, Job?
[1:53:11] Where were you when the sons of God
[1:53:13] shouted for joy? Where were you when I
[1:53:15] hung the morning star? Where were you
[1:53:16] when all these things happened?" Job
[1:53:19] begin to something begin to strike on
[1:53:20] the inside.
[1:53:22] That's right. This little life of mine,
[1:53:26] it isn't worthy to be compared with the
[1:53:28] glory that shall be revealed in us.
[1:53:30] Amen. The Bible says it has not even
[1:53:33] entered into the hearts of men. The
[1:53:35] things that God has prepared for them
[1:53:39] that love him. Oh, it makes me so
[1:53:42] excited when I listen to future home and
[1:53:44] brother Brandon begins to describe
[1:53:46] because you know what that says to me.
[1:53:48] It's better than that because it hasn't
[1:53:51] entered into the hearts of men.
[1:53:53] When I see a minister get up and he
[1:53:55] begins to talk about the streets of gold
[1:53:56] and how the the the river of life and
[1:53:58] the tree of life and the bride dwelling
[1:54:00] and the home that he's prepared for you.
[1:54:02] I go, "Man, that's amazing. It's better
[1:54:04] than that." Cuz it hasn't entered his
[1:54:07] heart either.
[1:54:10] So, I love fellowshipping on it. You
[1:54:12] just tell me the best. You just describe
[1:54:13] it the best way you can because I want
[1:54:15] it to be better than that.
[1:54:18] Oh, how wonderful God is. His ways are
[1:54:21] higher than our ways. His thoughts are
[1:54:23] higher than our thoughts, but in due
[1:54:25] season they come down. And we're living
[1:54:27] in such a time that the former latter
[1:54:29] rain are falling together. Oh my. And
[1:54:31] God is bringing forth a harvest that is
[1:54:34] fit
[1:54:36] for the gardener.
[1:54:38] Oh, doesn't he love you? He says,
[1:54:39] "Wherefore we receive a kingdom which
[1:54:42] cannot be moved.
[1:54:44] Let us stomp on everybody else and tell
[1:54:48] them how much better we are than them."
[1:54:50] No, it says, "Let us have grace."
[1:54:54] Oh Lord, help us. Let us have grace
[1:54:58] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[1:55:00] reverence and godly fear. For our God is
[1:55:04] a consuming fire.
[1:55:08] Beloved, I am persuaded better things of
[1:55:11] you. Oh, let's just bow our heads
[1:55:14] together.
[1:55:20] We've been down the road a long ways,
[1:55:24] some longer than others.
[1:55:27] I feel like I'm very young. I haven't
[1:55:30] been a long ways down. But when you look
[1:55:32] back and you stand, you look back at
[1:55:34] life, you realize, Lord, you've brought
[1:55:35] me through a lot of things.
[1:55:37] Been through trials, been through
[1:55:39] hardships.
[1:55:41] But in all of it, I want to ask you this
[1:55:44] question.
[1:55:45] Where were you?
[1:55:48] Where were you when the sons of God
[1:55:50] shouted for joy?
[1:55:52] Were you there?
[1:55:55] I can't put you there. That's a personal
[1:55:58] revelation.
[1:55:59] That's between you and God that you
[1:56:01] could look up to him and say, "Lord, I
[1:56:03] know that you could stand that day like
[1:56:06] Job vision and see. I know my redeemer
[1:56:10] lives.
[1:56:12] And though the skin wor my skin worms
[1:56:13] destroy this flesh, yet in my flesh
[1:56:16] shall I see God.
[1:56:20] I know, Lord. I I've repented and I I've
[1:56:22] been baptized. I believe I've received
[1:56:24] the gift of the Holy Ghost. But I the
[1:56:27] spirit I've received isn't just about
[1:56:30] birth. It's about adoption.
[1:56:33] It's about going on to perfection. It's
[1:56:36] about coming into the image of Jesus
[1:56:38] Christ.
[1:56:40] It's about being the manifestation of
[1:56:43] the thoughts that he had of me.
[1:56:47] So brother Benham would say in one place
[1:56:48] he said when we change when we take a
[1:56:52] body change it just changes these five
[1:56:54] senses
[1:56:56] because we become so much like him.
[1:57:00] Oh hallelujah. As first John chapter 3
[1:57:03] says when we see him we'll know him
[1:57:05] because we'll be like him.
[1:57:08] will have so fed upon and feasted upon
[1:57:11] and drank of the wine of revelation and
[1:57:15] rejoiced in the fatness and just feasted
[1:57:18] at his table that when it comes to that
[1:57:20] day said Lord you and I we're one
[1:57:24] as the prophet said she's him she's
[1:57:27] flesh of his flesh he's bone of his bone
[1:57:29] spirit of his spirit life of his life
[1:57:31] and when we change from mortal to
[1:57:32] immortality it's just this coral body
[1:57:35] that drops away and we pick empathy off
[1:57:38] anybody that you're hearing from it this
[1:57:40] morning. I trust
[1:57:44] I can't bring you to any place, but I
[1:57:46] encourage you this morning. If you need
[1:57:49] an experience with God, seek it with all
[1:57:51] your heart.
[1:57:54] If you need the baptism of the Holy
[1:57:55] Ghost, if you're there's anything in
[1:57:57] your heart that you want to say, "Lord,
[1:57:59] I don't know if I have it." Make sure
[1:58:01] you know.
[1:58:03] Don't leave it to chance.
[1:58:05] Don't leave it to maybe.
[1:58:08] Don't leave it to just well the pastor
[1:58:11] said, the preacher said, but I need to
[1:58:13] know down in my soul
[1:58:16] that it's Christ in me, the hope of
[1:58:19] glory.
[1:58:21] Heavenly Father,
[1:58:24] Lord, as these closing
[1:58:27] comments, Lord, and just
[1:58:30] not at all how I expected the service to
[1:58:32] go this morning. prepared some notes and
[1:58:35] thought I'd preach just on hope.
[1:58:38] But Lord, you you're sitting in the back
[1:58:40] reading the scripture. You just took it
[1:58:41] in a different way. Brought to my
[1:58:43] remembrance a number of things.
[1:58:46] Father, I pray Lord, you just make it
[1:58:48] more real to our hearts.
[1:58:51] Lord, we plant in another waters, but
[1:58:55] you're the one that gives the increase,
[1:58:57] Lord.
[1:58:58] Father, I pray Lord as Lord, Brother
[1:59:01] Moses, Brother Zigg, Lord, how they've
[1:59:03] planted, Brother Zigg, how he's labored
[1:59:05] for years,
[1:59:07] Lord, in the lives of many of these
[1:59:09] believers here. Bless him, Father. Be
[1:59:11] his portion, Lord. Remember Sister
[1:59:14] Anita, oh God, been such a faithful wife
[1:59:16] and how you've loved her, how you've
[1:59:18] kept her. Lord, may you be her portion.
[1:59:21] I pray remember her, Lord, in this time
[1:59:24] of transition, Lord, in this assembly.
[1:59:27] and brother Moses and Sister Sharifa.
[1:59:30] Lord, I pray you give them grace. Lord,
[1:59:33] not just in your eyes, but in the eyes
[1:59:34] of the people. Father, may you be
[1:59:37] glorified. May you be at the center of
[1:59:40] every decision. Be at the center,
[1:59:42] Father, of every service, of every life
[1:59:45] that's here, Lord. Father, may there be
[1:59:48] a revival here in restored word. Lord,
[1:59:51] may it go deeper, Lord Jesus, than just
[1:59:53] a surface, Father. But Lord, let it
[1:59:55] bring souls to you, Lord. May this
[1:59:58] little lighthouse shine brighter than
[1:59:59] ever before, Father. Lord, we commit
[2:00:02] them into your hands, Lord. Each one
[2:00:04] that's here under the sound of my voice,
[2:00:05] recognizing, Lord, that they're your
[2:00:07] sons, they're your daughters, Lord. You
[2:00:09] said you started the work and you'll be
[2:00:11] faithful to finish it. Lord Jesus, I
[2:00:14] pray you bring them, Lord, to a place,
[2:00:17] Lord, where you could say, "That's
[2:00:18] that's my son. That's my thought
[2:00:22] expressed. That's exactly as I seen it.
[2:00:24] That's the one, Lord Jesus. Bring that
[2:00:27] forth here in this assembly, I pray. Use
[2:00:30] Brother Moses, Lord, in a mighty way.
[2:00:33] Father, bring us, Lord, beyond the
[2:00:34] foundation. Bring us into perfection, we
[2:00:37] ask. We commit it into your hands, Lord.
