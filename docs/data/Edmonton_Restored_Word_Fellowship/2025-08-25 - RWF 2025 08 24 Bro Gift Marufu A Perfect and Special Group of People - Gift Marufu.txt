[Music] Amen. God bless you. There's a a request here for brother Menow to sing and there's an exclamation point at the end. So I think they really want that to happen. So we'll we'll just sing uh soon and very soon as as you'd come [Music] soon and very soon we are going to see the king. Soon and very soon we are going to see the king. Soon and very soon we are going to see our king. Hallelu. Hallelu. We are going to see our king. No more dying. There we are going to see our king. No more dying. There we are going to see our king. No more dying. There we are going to see our king. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are going to see our king. [Music] &gt;&gt; Well, the Lord bless you all. It's good to be here and uh to everything there is the first time once in life there's something for the first this is the first time I've been in this congregation and um usually of course you're all familiar we meet where the big when we gather in the middle of the year usually but um it's good to be here tonight I've got kind of a special reason for coming not altogether because this is not an opportunity which It is. But uh uh I feel a bit like St. Paul of old. Uh I mean of old. [Music] And uh when Timothy, he instructed Timothy along the way. I was just happened to open my Bible and dropped over to Timothy this morning. And I think brother gift has been like a Timothy to me. He sold with us for 22 years. And Emmon Jr. you know, they they mean they're part of our congregation. And and um I feel greatly honored whenever he goes. He said, "Well, uh I was going to come last weekend." He said, "Well, I'm going to Brother Jerry's." And I said, "After that," he said, "Well, the following weekend, I'm going to be Brother Zigg and and uh Brother Hammermeister." And I said, "Well, we'll take the second one then. I get an opportunity to be here with you." So, it's a blessing. It is a real blessing. this part here now that uh you know my voice is not what it used to be and uh in fact that remains for the whole being of me is not what I used to be uh this is what I used to be but it's good to be here and uh I'm supposed to sing the greatest morning ever let me tell you something I believe it we are so close to it I woke up this morning wondering Could this be the day when those who beneath us are resting would arise to bring on that new day. Then my heart began to beat for joy knowing what day that will be. When the bride will go to meet Jesus, the bride whom she so long to see. It will be the greatest morning ever when our loved ones again we behold. This time we'll meet never to part with Jesus. We'll always be. The signs and times are telling us that this is the day he'll return. There's wars and earthquakes everywhere. Hearts failing for the trouble they see. And a prophet has cried out again. Oh people return back to God. For Jesus is coming for a bride whose garments are spotless and white. Oh, it will be. Please sing it with me. Greatest morning ever when our loved ones again we behold. This time we'll meet. Never tooart. With Jesus we'll always be. Oh, it will be the greatest morning ever when our loved ones again we behold. This time we'll meet. Never to part with Jesus. will always be will be. God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He he sung that whole song without any lyrics on there. And so I think he's uh he's being humble when he says he's not what he used to be. I can't even remember what I had for lunch yesterday. So thank thank you for singing.

You son came every day. Still praying as I'm onward bound. &gt;&gt; Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. Lord, lift me up and let me stand by faith on heaven's table. A higher plane than I have found. Oh Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. My heart has no desire to stay. where doubts arise and fears dismay. Though some may dwell where knees abound, my prayer, my aim is higher ground. Lord, lift me up and let me stand by faith on heaven's table. A higher plane that I have found. Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. I want to live above the world. Though Satan's darts at me are heard, for faith has called the joyful sound. Oh, the song of saints on higher ground. Lord, lift me up and let me stand. My faith on heaven table, &gt;&gt; a higher place than I have found. Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. I want to scale the utmost high and catch a gleam of glory bright. But still I pray till heaven I found. Lord lead me onto higher ground. Lord, lift me up and let me stand by faith on heaven's table land. A higher place than I have found. Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire this morning? We may take our seats just for a few moments. I have a pleasant surprise to see uh my elder brother Meno and sister Irene there. We are thankful to to be together this morning. Uh like uh he said I'm like a Timothy to him. If I had to ch had a church that I would be pastoring and he would just walk and uh show up uh right away I would uh stop preaching and give him to uh continue. So we are very thankful sat under his ministry 23 24 years and uh the lord was gracious work together uh shaped me to be the preacher I am today. never preached in my country Zambia until I came here. And uh like the Bible would say uh it wasn't Timothy uh poking at Paul uh to want to preach. It was that Paul recognized the gift that was in Timothy. And that's why there's something about elders that we need to respect. Uh because they have walked where we have not walked yet. So uh we thank uh uh it's the first time to be in this church. I'm not sure if brother Zik Claw is is here or there. We we heard about you many many years dear brother. Uh during the years of brother Herod Hildebrand uh we would come for those conventions there and uh your name always popped up. Uh such a veteran uh been serving the Lord with all your heart. God bless you richly with your dear wife and family and uh we are thankful to be in the house of the Lord together. Um we pray that uh you keep throwing another share and helping us young ones go along with uh with the word of God. Amen. We uh thank brother Mosa here and Dala uh and his dear wife and family for uh receiving us. um and um uh inviting us to come and speak here this morning. Uh brother Mosa has been a friend over a few years now and uh even coming to Saskatoon and here in Edmonton we have uh crossed paths uh last time you hosted us uh and we had that uh really really nice African food. Uh uh it had been a long time since we had that and when I took a bite of it, oh my, that was uh and the sister can cook. And so it was very good uh to to to have that. Uh and um I bring you greetings from uh um Zambia. Our pastor, brother Ronica Pisha. Um some of you may know him. uh um that's who we are sitting under uh is our pastor and uh he says wherever you go uh make sure to greet the saints. Uh him and his dear wife sister Deborah um was just communicating with my wife that they are praying for us. So we thank uh we feel that warmth of the people and the whole Hebron tabernacle. uh our church is about uh uh quite a number now about 2,000 people and uh so we thank God that um uh the whole host is praying for us this morning and all the other sister churches. Um this morning I'm privileged to have uh with me my wife here, Sister Emma. Um she's been uh on my side uh year in and year out. uh we go doing miss missionary work together uh and and witnessing and and uh sometimes we've been in the markets uh and and distributing message books uh sometimes uh uh we we we've traveled within the country extensively uh Zambia and uh also outside the country Malawi, Zimbabwe, South Africa and uh the Lord has been gracious that we are together. Uh I was just telling some brothers I said uh uh we've been uh to places where uh fully uh infested with bed bugs on the on the bed and uh we have uh we've slept on beds that are uh sink in on the middle. Uh, one time I was at this place and I was preaching and uh that that that that room was infested with rats and uh and and this rat come and uh bit me on my uh right toe and blood oozing. I was very angry with that uh with that rat and uh but uh while I was looking for it, it had gone already. So we thank the Lord that uh she's by my side and and our last born junior there is with us and uh so we're thankful to the Lord. Um we uh I'll just ask you to stand. I just wanted to uh let these things out and uh just be here and um we're going to uh cruise for a little bit and uh just to encourage the people just by way of exhaltation and um we are not here to preach anything new. Uh we are just here to encourage you by the word of God. This message has come and uh it's irre irreplaceable. Nobody can replace this message of the hour. I've always said we don't need another messenger. We already have a message. We don't need another message. We already have the message of the hour with thus sayith the Lord. And no man, no message can replace this one. Because this is that which will bring to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine. This message uh carries with it that rapturing faith. 1 Corinthians chapter 2. I will zero in at verse 4. Amen. I love the Lord this morning. I sure enjoyed the song service. Where the spirit of God is, there is liberty. And uh so uh verse four of 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God. How bet we speak wisdom among them that are perfect. Yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world that come to not. But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory. which one of the prince which none of the princes of this world knew. For had they known it, they would have not crucified the Lord of glory. But as it is written, I hath not seen nor ear heard, neither h have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed the them unto us by the by his spirit. For the spirit searchth all things, yeah, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God, which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. That's powerful. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolish unto him, neither can he uh can can he known them uh because they are spiritually designed. But he that is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May the Lord add blessing to the reading of his word. Let's pray one more time. Dear Lord, we stand before you. Prayers has went forth. Lord, we have confessed our shortcomings. We have asked of the blood of Jesus Christ. The token has been applied. We know you are not just our judge, but you are also our lawyer. And we thank you this morning that our case has been already dismissed as the prophet would say it. So we come boldly before you Lord crying aba father help us this morning just a few words of encouragement lord this little just few little group of people but lord you preach to three people you preach to 12 you preach to 5,000 number is not anything in your sight Lord it's the quality that you're looking for help us this morning Lord to receive thy word help me Lord as I humble myself before thee and before your people. Help me Lord with clarity of mind to bring this word of God, just the thoughts you have imprinted on my heart. May they be a blessing to us all. We ask that you bless the reading of thy word to our heart this morning. We ask that Lord you bless young and old alike and in between. We commit our our ourselves unto thee and commend this service into your hands in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. We may take our seats this morning. I just want to uh touch on a little subject that I I I I felt uh to bring to your attention this morning. And uh and uh I'm sure we've come ready to receive of the word of God cuz uh where the carcass is, that's where you'll find the eagles. And eagles don't eat on dead dead food from yesterday. They eat of h fresh food and fresh mana of today. &gt;&gt; What was preached last Sunday, we are thankful for it. But we need more for this Sunday &gt;&gt; and more for next Sunday and more for next Wednesday. How many believe that to be the truth? &gt;&gt; I'm preaching on a little subject I've I've titled a perfect and special group of people. These are they a perfect and special group of people. These are they who are these people? These are the people that Paul is talking about here with the Corinthians that I came not with preaching of my own enticing words of wisdom. But I I came in demonstration of the of the of of the spirit and the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. May I uh encourage you this morning that the power of Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; This message will never be defeated by the enemy at any time, any hour, at any place, under any circumstances, this message will always win. I am here to encourage you that you are on the winning side this morning. You may have come gloomy and discouraged. But this word of God should be able to encourage you that you are a son. You are a daughter of the living God that you have passed on unto life. &gt;&gt; Sons of the living God are led by the spirit of God. And Paul says, we know that we've passed from death unto life because the spirit of God himself bears witness with our spirit. You don't you don't have to have anybody tell you whether you're a true Christian or not. Your own spirit within you will tell you because that's what the Bible says. Beareth witness that you're a child of the living God. That you have passed from death unto life. That no matter the circumstances, you have already made it into glory. Because those that he forneew, he predestinated them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And those that he predestinated, he justified. And those that he justified, he sanctified already. And those that he sanctified, he has already glorified. You are a glorified bunch of people this morning. May I say, and the devil can't do nothing about it. &gt;&gt; Don't let the circumstances of yesterday define who you are, my brother. Rise up as a child of the living God. If you fell yesterday, rise up again. Dust yourself up and keep moving. Blessed be the name of the Lord this morning. You love the Lord this morning. I can see this group is on fire for the Lord already. Brother Brennham says, "Whatever you do, do it to the best of your ability. If you're a housewife, be the best housewife. If you're a preacher, be the best. And if you're a teacher, be the best teacher. My brother, my sister, whoever you are, whatever the Lord has given you, use it to the glory of God this morning. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; The enemy would like to tell you and whisper in your ear that no, you know what? You're always full of mistakes. You're always down. You're always down. Let me tell you, my brother, rise up. Speak back to the enemy. That's your mountain. The Bible says if you can speak to this mountain, that mountain being moved and be cast into the sea and you don't doubt in your heart, it shall happen. &gt;&gt; Then the prophet qualifies it to say, even if it's one grain of sand, that starts to move. You are already on the victory side, my blood. That mountain has already started moving. What's your mountain this morning, my brother? speak it out of it and let the child of God move forward. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we like to glorify the devil too much. Sometimes we have people that are always complaining and murmuring. This year, brother Moses, this year my theme has been on this. Stop complaining and start claiming. &gt;&gt; Claim that which is yours, my brother. &gt;&gt; If Satan has squatted or and somebody has squatted into your yard, you have the right to say, "Get off of my property." &gt;&gt; Right now, our children have been robbed by the devil. They've gone wayward. Right now, many of us are quite discouraged. Right now, many are starting to question this message of the hour. I'll tell you my brother, they are too late for me. As for me and my house, we shall serve the Lord. I was telling the church in Spruce Grove, I say they may take our Bibles. Time may come, they may take our Bibles, our message books, but they are too late, my brother, because we have become the true bride has become one with the message. &gt;&gt; We are not just part of it, we are all of it. Remember, we are the ones predestined &gt;&gt; to actually receive this message. &gt;&gt; You have to have the ability to receive it. There's many people where you flash the message before them and they don't know nothing about it. But you and me, my brother, the Lord has given us the ability to actually believe it. I was watching not long ago, some time ago anyway, watching soccer. There was two teams that were, you know, in the professional league. And I was flipping through the channels in my hotel room and and and come to find out those two teams that were really high up there. And there there were two commented commentators that were talking and you know how they do before the team the team start playing and and they they they're examining both teams and the the the weaknesses and the strengths of each team and and the characters that are going to play in there and how they play together and and and I looked at them as I as they were talking. I I I waited a little bit and had them more. But there's one time that it caught my attention. This one commentator said about one team. He says, "The goodness with this team is that whether they play bad or they play good, they always win. Flip flip it spiritually speaking, my brother. What about you and me? We are on the winning side." The prophet says whether we are discouraged, it doesn't matter. We will rise up again. Whether the enemy strikes, it doesn't matter. We will rise up again. That's what I'm trying to encourage you this morning that you are not born of man. You are born of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Here's another example. In 2012, brother Mos we we Zambia went to the Africa Cup of Nations. And we're over there. We we went through the phases there, the the the the quarterfinals, the semifinals, all the way to the final. Where are we at this morning? We are right at the finality of things, my brother. &gt;&gt; We went all the way to the finals and we were playing Ivory Coast. And Ivory Coast is a team of giants. They're real big and most of them they play their their soccer in the European League in England. Zambia didn't have anybody that was playing in the Premier League at the time and they went to the finals with Ivory Coast and everybody everybody predicted that Ivory Coast would carry the day. Don't be discouraged by what people say about you. &gt;&gt; Be encouraged by what God thinks about you. What God says about you, brothers. This what God says about you, my elder. You've passed through many dangers, tors and snares. It &gt;&gt; is grace that has brought you this far. And grace will lead you home, my brother. &gt;&gt; And when we apply, they were playing. They started playing. We went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth all the way to the last minute. And Zambia scored the last winning goal. &gt;&gt; And all those giants walked out of there. When they walked into the stadium, they were like this. When they walked out of there, they were like this. Now, &gt;&gt; David said, "The Lord is the lifter of my head. May he lift your head right now. Whatever the situation you are in, family, church, whatever at personal level, whatever is bothering you, may God whisper in your ear that you are still your his child this morning. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So BBC and CNN they asked our captain, Zambian captain say, "How did you make it to fight these giants and win them?" And the captain said, "We talked about it in the locker room. We said, "Yeah, they are giants, but don't look at them. Look on the ball. If you look at them, you'll be very, very intimidated. Eyes on the ball. Eyes on the ball. What am I saying this morning? Eyes on the word of God. Eyes on this message. Don't look at that Goliath. He's so giant right now. But don't look at him. Look on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Cuz the word will defeat the enemy at any time, any place under the any circumstances. May the Holy Ghost in your life begin to whisper that you are a winner, not a loser. And the only loser is the devil himself. &gt;&gt; You are actually free to say Satan go to hell. &gt;&gt; Because hell was created for the devil and his angels. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A special and perfect group of people. How are you made perfect? We are not perfect on our own. But he that started the work in us through Jesus Christ is also able to finish it, my brother. &gt;&gt; I'm sure he's doing the finishing touches right now. He's horning and shaping us, my brother. Like that great sculpture that that that that like mangelo was. But a greater than Michelangelo is here this morning. That's our Lord Jesus Christ. He's the one who started the work in you. He will also finish it. Don't worry about the mistakes of yesterday. Don't let the setbacks of yesterday bring you down. Rather, use those setbacks as setups for comebacks and claim your victory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this morning. This message will never lose its power to the true believer. When you apply it and you mean it in your heart, the Lord is duty bound to come for you, my brother. It's very true. People are wondering about healing. Healing. Brother Bram says healing is children's bread. &gt;&gt; Then you hear a lot and it's okay. You hear a lot about physical healing. Physical healing. There's hardly anything that's brought for prayer for spiritual healing. &gt;&gt; How many people right now are suffering spiritually speaking? God help us in this hour that we are in that will be on fire for the Lord Jesus Christ. Not only physically but also spiritually speaking. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. We need people that would confess like Shanga of God and that that would say certain you have robbed me enough and enough is enough and I'm drawing a line here. Brother Gift, how do you know? Each time the devil reminds me of that diabetes that was killing me in 2007, but miraculously God healed me of that disease. But each time the devil whispers, each time I'm not feeling well, the devil said, "Oh, it's back." I say, "Satan, you are a bluff. By his stripes, I'm already healed." &gt;&gt; The same God who healed you yesterday will heal you today. He'll heal you tomorrow. The same God that saved you, the prophet says he can't save you today and lose you tomorrow. No, my brother, you are locked in already. &gt;&gt; You are a special group of people. A perfect group of people. Because why? He that is in you is perfect &gt;&gt; and is greater than he that's in the world this morning. Who are these people, my brother? It's a special group of people that were not born a buzzard. It's a special group of people that were not born a crow. It's a special group of people that were not born just a nominal church. This is a special group of people that we heard the cry of the papa ego that say come out of h my people. I was telling the church in Lusaka, nobody brought me in. No man brought me in. No man will take me out. This message you are not called by a man. &gt;&gt; This message you don't give each other revelation. &gt;&gt; Revelation comes from almighty God. My brother &gt;&gt; and no man can give each other revelation. The Bible says go into the world and preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; It didn't say give revelation. Just preach it and let the chips fall where they may. God himself will do the work from the inside and pushing out and giving you Zoe life &gt;&gt; and overcoming power. Brother Gif, can I overcome there? This is a pro promise in the Bible. There's a group of people that have been predestined to overcome &gt;&gt; in this hour that we are living in. You hear people talk about the dark ages and how it was son fed to lions thrown into the fires. If you read Fox book of matters, those people were going into there into the fires into the lions willingly. &gt;&gt; They had the anointing for that hour. We are not going to be fed to lions. &gt;&gt; No. Because this is another dispensation, my brother. &gt;&gt; And all those spirits from the first church age all the way to Laia have accumulated together. This is the most evil and treacherous church age that we are in. &gt;&gt; It's the most evil of all of them. It's the most deceitful of all of them. And people will wonder, "How did you make it?" Oh brother, by the grace of God, no matter how dark it is, there's a group of people that have been predestinated to withstand the chaos of this this this dispensation. We will crest every wave &gt;&gt; by the grace of God, my brother. We will find ourselves on the other shore by the grace of God. Because why? It's not you and me that's holding on to him. It's him that's holding on to you, my brother. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; What am I looking at here? I'm looking at a bunch of people that are likened unto Davids that can slaughter that Goliath, &gt;&gt; kill him, and chop his head off. &gt;&gt; Why are we? We are serpent trumpers this morning. We are people that have been ordained &gt;&gt; to put down Satan &gt;&gt; and throw him where he belongs. &gt;&gt; We are overcomers because the Bible says Jesus Christ will have overcomers in this hour that we are living in. Somebody's not is going to overcome. &gt;&gt; We would say like brother Brennham say if somebody has higher faith than I have, I better step out of the way and let them go. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not here to hinder each other. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you sister there. Every time you raise your hand, you are receiving answer from the living God. Every time you say amen, God is pleased with that because you're not saying amen to me. You're saying amen to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Exposition of the seven churches. Brother Pam says of Jesus Christ that he's not only the word of God, but he's also the God of the word &gt;&gt; and not only the God of the word, he's also the God of the amen. So your amens are unto him, my brother. &gt;&gt; I say amen to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because we are worshippers. That's what we were created for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This morning, &gt;&gt; I'm just enjoying myself here. Brother Mo, Brother Meno, Brother Zeke, I'm just enjoying myself here as a young preacher man. You know, I better expend my energy while I'm still young. &gt;&gt; You young people, serve the Lord with all your heart. &gt;&gt; This message is still real. &gt;&gt; It will give you the right job that you need. It will give you the right wife, the right husband. This message will give you will lift you up that people don't know what to do and Satan doesn't know what to do with you. &gt;&gt; The other day I had my tie on preparing to go to church and then the button here wouldn't wouldn't fit in. And usually my wife helps me when that happens. And uh sometimes she has uh kind of uh uh what you pinched me while trying to while trying to fix my partner and uh all of a sudden I went to the other room. I was looking for her to come help me. Then all of a sudden I was looking for my tie so for me to take to her so she can uh she can uh fix it for me. And I went to this room, no tie. Went to the bed, no tie. I couldn't where is my tie? I was getting frustrated. Come to find out I had my tie. I had it on. Young people, serve the Lord with all your heart. &gt;&gt; There may come time that you leave one room to go to the other room and forget what you went there for. &gt;&gt; There may come time there may come come time that you're looking for your phone and yet you're talking on your phone. There may come time that you're looking for your car keys and yet they're in your hands. So while you can serve the Lord, &gt;&gt; I heard the prophet say this the other day. The prophet says it used to be time that I would just jump out of bed. &gt;&gt; But he says, "Now I've crossed 50. I have to examine my leg. Bring it out of bed one at a time. Is this working?" &gt;&gt; All right. Yeah, that's working. How about the other one? Is it working? &gt;&gt; Yeah. What about my hand? &gt;&gt; And then you carefully stepped out. &gt;&gt; Wow. You are able to serve the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Serve him with all your heart. Testify to others. Tell him about how you came to the message. Tell him about how good this God that you serve is. That he's a God of glory and mighty in battle. He's a warrior this morning. That's our Lord Jesus Christ this morning. is more than able to hear your heart's cry. &gt;&gt; You parent maybe your children wayward. I know of a brother that his son had gone wayward. And this brother, this man, he went to prayer sincerely. He's a preacher. He's a pastor. and said, "Lord, in my loins, you didn't give me serpent seed. &gt;&gt; I claim my son." &gt;&gt; And within a week, that son had come back crying like a baby. And today, he's a minister of this gospel of the hour. Our God is more than able to do it. I'm just coming back from Zuzu Malawi where I took six services in a row where in the northern part of Malawi there the pastor of that church begin to tell his testimony his son was always the last in school. Our God is God of knowledge and wisdom. &gt;&gt; Ask and it shall be given. Don't just ask little. Ask abundantly. The Bible says But first of all, put him first. &gt;&gt; Put him first. When you put him first, all other things will fall in line, my brother. &gt;&gt; And this pastor, each time over there, they read out who is number one and who is the last one. And everybody knows. So they would start reading the names and then they would say and the last one that boy what a humiliation that the pastor went to prayer the brother went to prayer he says Lord you didn't create my child to be a laughingstock in that school I didn't birth him so that he would be the laughingtock. You gave him to me. As the Bible says, you are not the tail, &gt;&gt; you are the head. &gt;&gt; And he started pouring out his heart. Listen my brother, the God of William Brennham is still present today. The God of William Brham still answers prayer today. I don't care what the skeptics, what the critics say, &gt;&gt; but I'll tell you when you are in real real need of a situation, our God will come through for you, my brother. &gt;&gt; He answers prayer even today. &gt;&gt; And the brother prayed say, "Lord, unlock, &gt;&gt; unlock his head. &gt;&gt; Twist it the other way around, Lord. &gt;&gt; He's still in that business. And the following term the boy who was lost &gt;&gt; came tops. &gt;&gt; You see he's still the God of miracles. &gt;&gt; Because where God is, there is miracles. Now I'm not saying look for miracles because you are the miracles yourself. &gt;&gt; You don't have to look for power. You have the power in you. &gt;&gt; You don't have to look for a church to say I need a church which is on fire. You be the fire yourself. Don't leave the church and say there's no Holy Ghost here. You be the Holy Ghost in the church. &gt;&gt; The hypocrites, you be the real one. Because every time there's a counterfeit, it means there's also a real one, my brother. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And that boy was consistently topped. Today he's a doctor &gt;&gt; in medicine &gt;&gt; and performing brain surgery. &gt;&gt; Our God is more than able to you hear your heart's cry. If something is to encourage you young people now maybe the elderly, maybe you may have a need of your own. But all I'm saying is that he's the God of all. &gt;&gt; He's the God of the young, the middle age is the God of the elderly. And our needs are different. So whatever your needs are, Jesus is a person of God. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Who are this special group of people. &gt;&gt; Let me go back cuz there is a special group of people. These are there that God has put his eyes on. Even to the point Jesus Christ said not even a hair of your head will be lost. &gt;&gt; These are there my brother that belong to this special group of people a perfect group of people. These are they where healing is children's bread. &gt;&gt; These are they who are the oil and the wine of the Lord Jesus Christ. These are they who have been born again &gt;&gt; with the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you my brother like Nicodemus said and Jesus we asked him asked Jesus Jesus answered unless you be born again. &gt;&gt; We arrive we have arrived in this hour now you must be full of the spirit of God if you have to go into heaven my brother. &gt;&gt; This is not a free ticket to everybody. It's only to those that are filled with the oil and the wine of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; God has no grandchildren. God has sons and daughters of God and only those that fulfill the part they were that are victorious in this age. These are the the they where victory belongs to them. You know, victory is not always like you're always winning. Sometimes we go down, but victory is to raise up again. &gt;&gt; And say, "Satan, you're a bluff." Yes, you took me down, but the Lord raised me up again. Victory is when you are discouraged and all of a sudden something sweep over your soul and say, "What am I murmuring and complaining about? I'm a child of the living God. Get thee behind me, Satan. &gt;&gt; There's victory." Victory is when a brother or sister or somebody out there, they're always poking at you and you get to a point where where you're so frustrated. Victory is to where you can say, "I forgive you &gt;&gt; and I'm praying for you." Look at Elisha when those 42 troo kids there were making fun at them at him cuz he was baldheaded. Elisha got angry. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says that wasn't the anger of God. That was a prophet who was angry. &gt;&gt; K those children and bear came and killed them all. Fast forward it to this time &gt;&gt; with the prophet of the hour &gt;&gt; in front there when he was preaching sitting boy and girl and carrying on and kissing &gt;&gt; right when the prophet was preaching and the angel of the Lord says whatever you say it shall happen &gt;&gt; he tried to tell them stop what you're doing they wouldn't stop the angel of the Lord say say whatever if they have to be packed out of here dead they'll be packed out of here dead the prophet something overcame him came upon him and it was forgiveness and he pronounced I forgive you now that's overcoming my brother because this message is a message of grace it's a message of reconciliation it's a message of forgiveness if you can't forgive you will not be forgiven also That's what this message is about my brother. It has taught us that whatever the situation is, we can rise up again. &gt;&gt; These are they who would declare like Job would declare to say, I know you're making fun of me. I know you are mocking me. Even my wife, you want me to curse God so that he can kill me. He said, you speak like a w the foolish woman. He didn't say you are a foolish woman. He said, "You speak like a foolish woman. Come tell come time that you know God will never allow pressure on you that you can't withstand." The Bible says to some it just seems it's a roller coaster. It doesn't necessarily mean that they are sinners. Sometimes it's God wanting to show his power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because if he allowed the same to another person, they may not handle it. &gt;&gt; God rich in mercy, my brother. He's still merciful. Like the Bible says, his mercies are new every day. &gt;&gt; So the Lord come up to Job at his last moment and lifted him up and gave him that vision. Where were you, Job? When the sons of God rejoiced, where were you when the start? He started asking those questions. Finally, finally, Job knew it was revealed who he is that he was in God's mind before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And Job in boldness gathered all the critics. Let me tell you, it's time to shame the critics this hour that we are living in. Job gathered all of them and said, "Come over here. Let me tell you something. You've been laughing at me, but let me tell you something. I know my redeemer liveth." &gt;&gt; These are they right now. I'm looking at them. That would declare that Jobs that although I am sick, but I know my redeemer liveth. Although I'm down, my redeemer liveth. That should be the confession of the believer. &gt;&gt; You ask people, "How are you feeling?" saying, "Oh, you know, I'm not feeling well. I'm not." We are glorifying the devil. We should confess like that Shunomite woman. All is well. That's the confession of a believer. How are you feeling today? All is well. &gt;&gt; She had her child dead from heat stroke. But she raised up to that prophet and say when he asked her, "Ah, is everything well with you?" &gt;&gt; She said, "All is well." &gt;&gt; Ah, let me be let that be my confession. Regardless of how I'm down, regardless of my roller coasters, may I confess that Jesus is still faithful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need in this hour a replica of the three Hebrew children. &gt;&gt; Look at the boldness and their faith. Yeah. &gt;&gt; To that King Nebuchadnezzar had put up an image and had declared made a decree that everybody should worship the gods of Nebuchadnezzar. Those three children they refused. &gt;&gt; We are not going to bow down to that image and we are not going to worship those gods. How many gods do you think are here in this hour with over 200 million demons released &gt;&gt; to bombard not only the young, the middleage and the elderly? We are all fighting the same devil. &gt;&gt; See the devil is so evil that even if you remove the D, he's still evil. That's how bad the devil is. The Bible says come to steal, kill, and destroy. &gt;&gt; But we will not be destroyed, my brother. We have passed from death unto life. We are the for overcomers of this hour. We are the ones that Jesus Christ himself described by the prophet of the hour. He says, "I don't call you church anymore. I call you Mrs. Jesus. I call you the bride of Jesus Christ." And here she's standing all over the world, even in the jungles of Africa. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She's standing on her two feet without a headquarters, my brother. Because our headquarters is not here on earth. &gt;&gt; Our headquarters is in heaven, my brother. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. God is no respector of man. God is respector of his own word, my brother. Those that are in him. Ah, who are these people? Resurrection belongs to them. Rapture is already lying in them already. &gt;&gt; You know we rapture is coming. Rapture is coming. Yes, it's coming. The little change of these bodies. But this word is already bringing rapture within us and rapture is lying within you and me. &gt;&gt; We have the fullness of the word. Now the other church ages, they only saw in part. But today we are looking at this word of God in the fullness of it. &gt;&gt; Look what the seven seals have done. Opened the way for us. Even brother Brham says when those seals were opened the Bible became new to me. &gt;&gt; If it became new to him, it's new to us. My brother, &gt;&gt; we know who has called us. We know where we are. We know where we are going. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if this morning somehow maybe you're disoriented a little bit like the northern uh the fishermen of northern England, they would go to the high seas to fish at night and sometimes the clouds would come and they would finish fishing and the clouds covering the skies. They didn't know where they were going. Sometimes they would get disoriented and start going the opposite direction. They would be singing songs like Jesus is the rock in a weary land, a shelter in the time of storm. And by and by the winds would come and blow &gt;&gt; the clouds. Just because you see the sun doesn't mean the sun is not there. &gt;&gt; The sun is still there. It's still shining just as much. &gt;&gt; Just because God dwells in a weak vessel doesn't mean God is weak. &gt;&gt; He's still God. He's still Jehovah Gyra. He's still the resurrection and the life. And he that cometh to him must know that he is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "I'm the resurrection and the life. He who believeth on me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Believest thou this?" We are believers of this hour. We are believers of this message. &gt;&gt; We've come from death unto life already. Blessed. That's I'm encouraging you today that you are that kind of people. You're that bunch of people. Don't you ever let anybody bring you down. Don't let even yourself bring you down. &gt;&gt; Don't be like uh Paul of Romans 7 complaining and murmuring about the flesh. But watch Paul in Romans 8 where he says there's therefore no more condemnation &gt;&gt; to them that are in Christ Jesus. He realized it wasn't him. It was Jesus Christ. If the Lord doesn't pick you up, my brother, we are nothing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's the one that knew us. Jeremiah 29 11 says, "I know the thoughts that I have for you." &gt;&gt; Thoughts of peace. &gt;&gt; When the devil comes to you and rob you of your peace, take it back. Take your peace back and say, "Devil, that's enough. I am claiming my peace in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." And move forward. Moses was told, "Don't cry to me." See, the prophet is gone, but the pillar of fire is still there. &gt;&gt; He's still leading his children, my my brother, through the fires, through the hot waters, through thin ice. He's still leading his children, my brother. &gt;&gt; Follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit. It would come time that God told Moses that Moses look at the pillar of fire and follow that pillar of fire and let the children of Israel follow you. He's still the same. I wish I could preach on the God of order. He has not changed. His order has to be followed &gt;&gt; if we have to go to the other side. Even in church, the order has not changed. &gt;&gt; So here is the pillar of fire leading Moses and the children of Israel to a dead end. In front of them the Red Sea. Behind them the armies of Pharaoh. On one side high mountains, on the other side steep valleys. Nowhere to go. Sometimes you are found in those situations. Trust in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Trust in the Lord. He's still the way maker today. He's still the chain breaker today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The children of Israel were crying, "You've brought us here. So we die. We would rather have been where we were in Gan." Yeah. Goshan was in Egypt but Egypt wasn't in Goshan. &gt;&gt; We are in this world but we are not of this world my brother. &gt;&gt; Always remember that. &gt;&gt; We are not of this world. We are in this world but we are not of this world. &gt;&gt; Let them ride to the dead end. Moses cried and Lord said why cry? Speak. &gt;&gt; We have arrived in that hour. &gt;&gt; It's not coming. It's already here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Speak the word of God and go forward. If you, the Bible says, not if me, if you, &gt;&gt; said to this mountain, &gt;&gt; the Lord has laid it in our lap. Now, &gt;&gt; it's up to us. But don't use it foolishly like the prophet says, Lord, I want a tree created here. No, I want a No, we have that. But he's a God of order and principle. And Moses says when he got that revelation, oh brother, it pays to have revelation. If there's anything we need in this hour is revelation. &gt;&gt; Rapture is going to be a revelation. And &gt;&gt; Moses declared to the children of Israel to say, "You, you see these Egyptians here, all these Egyptians with their chariots, the Egyptians that you see today, you will see them no more forever." &gt;&gt; I can hear a parent say, I can hear a brother say, "These demons that have been bothering me, I will see them no more forever. These temptations that have been bothering me, I will see them no more forever. You declare that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and move forward. &gt;&gt; What's your Red Sea this morning? May it be parted? I was asking the church back home. I said, "What formula, those of you that have done physics, what formula did God put in place &gt;&gt; to stay the water and build that wall of water and dry the ground?" &gt;&gt; And what timing did he put in place so that every one of them were the children of Israel? &gt;&gt; Not only the people, but their belongings and their animals. Because Moses had said, "Not even a hoof will be left behind." &gt;&gt; We're not leaving behind anybody. As the body of the Lord Jesus Christ, we are going, everybody that's predestined, we'll be there, my brother. So whether we hate each other or love each other, we will be there, my brother, together. We need grace one for another. Thy loving kindness is better than life. David said, "So, Roy, God, so I said, let's ask Uncle Google." So, I said, "Can you can we type on our phones what formula could God have used to stay the waters?" And Google said it is impossible to calculate this. That's the God that we worship. That's the God that we serve. Even Google can't do nothing about it. He's the God of almighty formula. He knows how he brought you in. He knows how where you were and how he would bring you in. We have come all we have come with different avenues of life. But God rich in mercy somehow work something out that we would meet like this here this morning. Who are these people? These are the people that have refused to bow down to the devices of the enemy. These are the people that have refused to bow down to social media. These are the people who that have re refused to gossip. These are the people. These are they that are standing upright by the by the mercy and grace of God. These are the people that have said like David, thy word have I hid in my heart that I will not sin against thee. These are they, oh blessed be the name of the Lord. These are they who would say like David, I was glad, very glad when they said to me, let us go to the house of the Lord. There will be singing, there will be shouting, there will be victory. Somebody is going to walk out of here victorious. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; These are they who would say like Job, the Lord has given and the Lord has taken. Blessed be the name of the Lord. These are they who would declare like Joshua who said, "Choose ye this day whom you shall serve, but as for me and my house, we shall serve the Lord." These are they who would declare that in this day God sent a prophet &gt;&gt; with a with a sure message. These are they that the Lord has said in Revelation 6:6, "A measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of bal for a penny, but of the oil and the wine, don't hurt them." &gt;&gt; Because why? These are mine. These are they. These are mine. Don't touch the oil. And who are the oil and the wine? I'm looking at them right now. You're filled with the oil of the Holy Ghost. And we are filled with the wine of God, which is the stimulation coming by revelation. That's you, my brother. Don't ever estimate yourself. You're child of the living God. You see, stop beating yourself about the mistakes of yesterday. &gt;&gt; Because many times the devil comes to remind us. &gt;&gt; Oh, what about that? &gt;&gt; What about this thought? You think you're a Christian? As long as we are in this flesh, &gt;&gt; we'll make mistakes. &gt;&gt; But there's something that's redeemed, that's here, my brother, that will not make a mistake. That will confess that Jesus is Lord all the time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The redemption of this shall come as well in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. It will come, my brother. These are they that have been predestined not to go to hell. You have the right to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Who is that tree of life? The Lord Jesus Christ himself. And when those fishermen would look, the winds would blow. They would look at one star. They would be looking for brother Brennham calls it the North Star. Every geographer, every GPS on your vehicle, on your ship, airplane, every GPS is tied to the North Star. It's the only star that doesn't revolve. Every other star revolves around the North Star. A greater than north star is here. That's our Lord Jesus Christ. When they would see the north star, they will find their way home. That's what we are doing this hour. That's what the word of God is doing. When we look at the North Star, Jesus Christ, we will find our way home. My brother, he's the way, the truth, and the life. Even today, this hour. Blessed be the name of the Lord. He's here to hear to our hearts cry. is here to say, "I died for you and for your sins, for your trouble, that hard trouble. He's more more than able to make and create a new one. He's still a creator." &gt;&gt; If he can create things into existence, he can create things out of existence as well. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of a God that we are. God is limitless. You cannot limit God. Oh, no, no. God is limitless. And when God says something, he doesn't backpedal on it. He means what he says and he says what he means. These are they who believe the true word of God from cover to cover. These are they that even when they are rebuked, they will say, "Lord, be it unto me according to your will." These are they that they will take correction by the word of God. These are they that will walk and say, "Lord, help me walk right. Help me look right. Help me do right. help me act right. These are they that will confess and admit to their faults. &gt;&gt; You know there are people who don't want to who don't really they feel when they admit their mistakes they they feel like they are inferior. You are actually more powerful when you admit your mistakes and you're teaching somebody something. The Hebrew children they refused. Ah may we fashion at them. These are they that Daniel said in the last last days, they that know their God shall perform exploits. &gt;&gt; These are called believers. Believers of this word of the hour. Somebody's going to believe. Somebody's going to say a though none go with me yet I'll follow. Somebody is going to say like had it right to say this is even when you push play something deep calling to the deep something in you will agree and say this is nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; I don't know how it's going to happen but it will happen. &gt;&gt; How is rapture going to happen? I don't know. That's not my business. That's his business my brother. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I know he says he would have a bride without spot or wrinkle. &gt;&gt; I know that's what he said and I believe it. &gt;&gt; I know my redeemer liveth and I'll do like David says, "Satan, you come to me after your gods and and and with sword, but I'm coming to you in the name of the Lord, God of the armies of Israel." &gt;&gt; Let's go that way, my brother. You hear the phrase armed and dangerous. We should be that way to the devil, armed and dangerous. Satan, back off because a child of God is coming and passing through. &gt;&gt; Amen. You of my black people, I was preaching back home. So much witchcraft over there, but over here witchcrafted is a stubborn spirit to the word of God. It's as good as leprosy. &gt;&gt; We need mellow hearts. Hearts that will say, "Lord, I believe." Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not to understand. We're called to believe it. &gt;&gt; And by and by, God will drop that revelation in our heart. &gt;&gt; What's witchcraft to you? What's wizard to you and me, my brother? What are those? What's a curse? That all there's a curse on our family. You hear so much of that back home. The curse remover is here. &gt;&gt; The overrider is here. He can override everything you have ever done in your life. Make you a new my brother, my sister. That's a kind of a God that we serve. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This morning, &gt;&gt; oh, what you're suffering from is from your great great grandmother, great-grandfather. That's a bunch of nonsense. &gt;&gt; We don't belong to that family anymore. We belong to the family of the living God. The blood of Jesus Christ has encircled us. We are of another family. We are of another DNA. We are of another genes, my brother, that's laying in oil. The blood of Jesus Christ is flowing in your heart. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Our God is more than able. You love the Lord this morning. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. These are the people that Jeremiah chapter 1 said, "Before I formed you, I &gt;&gt; before I formed you in your mother's womb, &gt;&gt; I knew you &gt;&gt; and I ordained you to be a prophet." &gt;&gt; What's the message to you and me, Sister Irene? Before I formed you in your mother's womb, I knew you would be a believer, &gt;&gt; a believer of this urge, my brother, that when everything else with gross darkness all over us, there's still stars that are shining and giving the light to this dead world. My brother, one of these days, the bride will be taken out of here and to meet the Lord in the air and go to the marriage supper of the lamb. Then gross darkness, total darkness will engulf the earth. Watch the tribulation then. But I'm so glad the prophet of the hour. He wasn't just a messenger. He was a prophet messenger. But not only a prophet messenger, he was a sealer. &gt;&gt; Somebody who would go into God's mind and pick out and tell us what happened in the Garden of Eden. Even not if it's not written in the in the in the Bible, he would go into the mind of God and actually tell us what actually happened to Abraham and Sarah. &gt;&gt; There is something with names. My brother, the prophet even says, "Who sinned? Who lied? Was it Abraham or Abraham? &gt;&gt; Who was a suppler, a liar, a shy star? Was it Israel or Jacob? &gt;&gt; You can go down the line and down the line, down the line. The Bible says, brethren, it does not the way we are right now. That's not who we are &gt;&gt; like in this flesh. &gt;&gt; We have another name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That God himself hasn't. One day he will call &gt;&gt; and I will &gt;&gt; and when your name is called, you shall know that it's you who is being called. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he calls for brother Meno, I can't jump in there and say it's me. Only him will know. &gt;&gt; When he calls for me, only me will know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why our spirit bears witness with the spirit of God. We are children of the living God. &gt;&gt; It was Abraham who had Ishmael. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it was Abraham &gt;&gt; who had Isaac. I'm sure if these two boys would go to school, one of them they asked their names would say, "I am Ishmael Abraham." And Isaac would say, "I am Isaac Abraham." &gt;&gt; What a difference in name. &gt;&gt; And that's why whatever we do, the Bible says, do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Don't use any other names. That name has power. Power to save, power to redeem, power to heal, power to make a way for you and for me. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Gift, I seem to be encouraged. And two days later, I'm down again back and forth. It's a cycle. Jesus Christ is a cycle breaker, my brother. &gt;&gt; He'll break that cycle in his own name because his name is above all names. and every tongue shall confess that he is Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my believers now this ah let me just leave you with this I like as a preacherman I like to filter my thoughts with with what the messenger of the hour has said. &gt;&gt; Then when I'm preaching to the people I am very confident I am on firm ground and I know what I'm preaching is exactly what the prophet preaches. exposition of the seven churches. You know, this one doesn't have paragraphs, but if you can type it, you can type it where he zeros in on putting these verses together, we see that there is only one group of people, &gt;&gt; a blessed group of people. a special group of people, &gt;&gt; a perfect group of people &gt;&gt; because he is perfect. &gt;&gt; I've always said our Lord Jesus is the greatest project manager. &gt;&gt; If they ask you who are you, you said I'm a project of Jesus &gt;&gt; and a project, he doesn't run out of resources. No, he will use the same resources to make because he's the porter we are declare. He doesn't discard us. He just changes our appetite, the way we think, what we eat. Spiritually speaking, that's what he does. And that's what this message has done in our lives. One of these days, my brother, my sister, we shall begin to lose gravitation. Somebody is going to walk out of this earth. Somebody's going to be changed in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; From this pedest house into a glorified body. &gt;&gt; We believe that with all our heart. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says this, putting these verses together, we see that there's only one group of people and that a very special group of people. &gt;&gt; That's why I got my title this morning. A very not just a special group of people, a very special group of people &gt;&gt; who are able to hear what the spirit says in each age. &gt;&gt; Look at their ability. If somebody would walk out of here in into here from the denominational outfit, it would choke them to death. And if we also went there with what we know now and we sit there and listen to the way they preach, it'll choke us to death as well. &gt;&gt; This is where we belong. &gt;&gt; It's like my testimony of coming to the Lord Jesus Christ. When this man had testified, this brother testified, invited me to his home, he said, "Come and see." &gt;&gt; That's a good one. When I say then say come and see, John went and pipped. But he was told to seal up the book. It's not for your time. It's not for your time. Because a special envoy, &gt;&gt; a special ambassador, &gt;&gt; a special alazar &gt;&gt; would come our way to reveal the seven seals. Daniel wanted to reveal them. Paul wanted, John wanted, but they were told shall seal off the book cuz one was to come that God had ordained for this hour. When I went to that house that day, left my church, the United Church, I was the choir director there, and something kept saying, "Go that way. Go to that man's house." I went there. I found him preaching hard to his wife and two-year-old boy. And I said, "Wait a minute. This is the church." &gt;&gt; Few times I wanted to get out and get out. But brother, when the grace of God is upon you. &gt;&gt; See, the grace is what it puts us in. &gt;&gt; Mercy is what keeps us in. Without the mercy of God, we wouldn't be here this morning. I went there. I I want to leave and something something would say, "Sit down." When the service was over, not an audible voice, but that still small voice said to me, "This is where you belong." And from that time, I've never looked back. This is the message, the truth. &gt;&gt; No man would pull you in, my brother, except God himself. All that my father has given me will come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And no one will pluck them out of my hand cuz their names are engraved in my palm. &gt;&gt; Here we are, this hour that we are living. God rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how low you've sunk. He'll pull you out. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how far you've gone, &gt;&gt; he'll draw you back in. &gt;&gt; If there seed in there, if the seed of God is in there, he'll never leave you nor forsake you. He'll be with you, even with you to the end of the world. He says, "Bif, I made a lot of mistakes. Everybody else, but it's God who keeps us in, my brother." &gt;&gt; Listen what he says. A very special group of people who are able to hear what the spirit says in each age. It is one special group that receives the revelation for each age. That group is of God. Because the group that cannot hear is not of God. The group and he says John chapter 8 42-44. The group that can and does hear what the spirit is saying and receives the revelation thereof is that group described in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 6-16. That's what we read. They are the ones who have the spirit of God. They are the ones that are born of God. They are baptized into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ by his spirit. &gt;&gt; They are baptized with the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; to further bring out what we have just said and to also use a scripture that should be born in mind as well as we talk about who it is that is baptized with the Holy Ghost. See what Jesus says in John 6:45. It is written in the prophet, "And they shall all be taught of God, but turn to Isaiah 54:13 when this is taken." And it reads, "And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord." &gt;&gt; The all of God are the children of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thus it is that the evidence of being a true child of God. He whom the spirit has come upon and indwells is again set forth as one taught by the word by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We have arrived. &gt;&gt; Taught by the Bible led by the spirit. The song says that's who we are looking at here. Brother, sister, if they not meet again, stay with the message of the hour. Stay with us, say the Lord. It will reach you home, my brother. It will take you home. It will give you strength during your trials and tribulations. It will whisper to your ear that you are a child of the living God. It will confirm with your spirit that no matter what you're going through, you are still a child of the living God. Who are these people? These are they a special group of people. a people that have been handpicked, &gt;&gt; chosen by God himself &gt;&gt; from eternity. And now we know where we are going. We're going back to eternity. My brother, &gt;&gt; brother Brennham says God had to slaughter us in. He says a hickey of time, just a little time frame for man to be there and to receive this word and for church urges to to be ushered in and show the power of the living God that no matter how the caterpillar, how the conquer worm, how the h locus, everything, how they add up that crop, it's still raised up again. And today she's on her two feet. She has matured. She's ready for the Ghana. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're just ripening now, &gt;&gt; being turned back and forth by the word of God. Turn this way, turn that way, receive sun, the s to ripen further, to bring the moisture levels to be at the right time. So, we can't put the a a grain that hasn't arrived or reach the moisture content that God wants. It can't go into the Ghana. It has to be harvested at the right time. And that time soon and very soon like that song that has been sang that time is coming soon my brother. &gt;&gt; Better stay in line. We better know where we stand with this word. We better say let like the Bible says let the weak say there I am strong. Let the sick say I am healed. Let the downtrodden say I'm cheerful now. Because why? The word has been dropped in my heart. That's the word of God. That's a word of a blessed assurance. Don't worry about the undertaker. Don't worry about what's going to happen to you tomorrow. Worry about the upper taker, the one that's going to raise you from the dead. Because the Bible says if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, there is already another one waiting for me. My brother, &gt;&gt; you don't have to worry. You step out of this one, you step into the other one right away in a moment. Our God is more than able. Look at what happened to the three Hebrew children. Brother Benham begins to dramatize. Bedigo maybe said, "Mish, you are the one in front." Cuz they're walking them franken and in line like that. Are we ready? That's a question I can ask myself. Gift, are you ready? And each one of you can ask yourself. And Mishk says, "I am ready." &gt;&gt; That's a confession of a believer. If the Lord is ready, I am ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the three Hebrew children, we're going into the fiery furnace. We all have fiery furnaces in our lives. And Gabrielle rises up, goes to the throne, said, "Lord, have you seen what they doing to your children?" And God, the Lord said, "Yes, I've sinned, but the anchor holds." They are of that kind of material that will withstand the fire. Wood said, "You know, you sent me in anti- Deluvian church, Noah's time, and I flooded the whole thing. Why don't I go and flood that whole furnace?" God said no. Remember in the scripture when they brought those three boys, Nebuchadnezzar asked them, "Is it true that you won't bow and you won't worship the the gods?" And they said, "It's true. We will not bow." I can hear somebody here saying, "I will not bow to the devices of the enemy. and he got angry. See, that's where the devil is. Always angry. I'm winding down now. They got there and he begins to declare. Nebuchadnezzar says, "Who is that God &gt;&gt; that will deliver you from my hand?" &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Who is that angel?" He didn't say, "Who is that Gabriel? Who is that wmud?" He didn't just say he didn't say who is that serum or cherbam. He says who is that God? &gt;&gt; The challenge was to God himself. &gt;&gt; And God said the challenge is not to you Gabriel. It's not to you angel or anybody else. The challenge is to me. So devil bring it on. &gt;&gt; Gathered up the four winds northwest, southeast. Brother Brenham say God climbed the rampant of glory right into the eternal garden plucked a palm leaf ordered the winds say you drive me right back to earth into that fiery furnace. Brother Brandham says God zigzagged through eternity all the way and before they threw those three children God was already there. Brother Barham says he was using the same palm leaf to fan off the heat. May I say this? May God fan off the heat in your life. May God give you air conditioning in your life. &gt;&gt; By the time those three children were thrown into there, yes, the fire was there, but it was nice and cool where they were. It was nice and cool. What about the children of Israel? After they crossed the Red Sea and and and and Miriam took the tambourine, started playing. All the sisters joined in. They were happy. They walked for 3 days and they were thirsty. There was no water. They started murmuring to Moses and crying to Moses. Finally, they found a body of water. They tried to drink and the water was so bitter they couldn't drink it. Sometimes we go through those stages in our lives. &gt;&gt; And those waters were bitter. We were crying to Moses. Moses cried to God and God said, "Moses, come up. Come over here. Come over." When God wants to deal with you, he deals with you as an individual. He's an individual God. &gt;&gt; We are here as a group, but we are individuals, my brother. Each one we have to fight for what belongs to us &gt;&gt; with fear and trembling. Took him aside said look that tree there out of all the trees there was only one tree &gt;&gt; that would give life. &gt;&gt; There's only one tree that that eternal tree that will give life. &gt;&gt; Cut down that tree. Throw it into the water. And they did. I assume it it's Moses that took the first gulp of drink and the waters were sweet. The waters of Mara. May God sweeten that problem. May he turn that sickness into health. May he turn that trouble into a testimony that we are going to give as an overcomer. &gt;&gt; How many would say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Let's rise to our feet this morning. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. May he sweeten your waters of mara this morning because why? You are a special group of people. You are a predestinated group of people. A royal priesthood. A city that's put on a on a hill. A city that you are worthy to see. New Jerusalem. I can almost see the lights of that city. They're there. It's a real city. John saw it. And John saw you and me in that city. You have to believe you're part of it. They asked brother Brennham, "How do you know you're going to make it?" &gt;&gt; And he said, "I have to believe that I'll make it. You have to believe. I have to believe that we are seeds of the living God. We come from God. We're going to God. We are marching to Zion." Amen. I believe that's where we're going this morning. &gt;&gt; We are m Maring to Zion. Oh, beautiful, beautiful Zion. We are maring up to Zion Zion, that beautiful city of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, we are maring. &gt;&gt; We are maring to Zion. Oh, beautiful [Music] king of zillord [Music] and let our joys be known. Join in a song with sweet accord in a song with sweet accord and just surround the throne and thus surround the throne. &gt;&gt; We're marching to Zion. Zion, &gt;&gt; beautiful, beautiful Zion. We're marching upward to Zion, that beautiful city of God. &gt;&gt; We used to sing who never knew our God. But children of the heavenly king, but children of the heavenly king may speak their joys above. They speak their joys abroad. &gt;&gt; We're maring. &gt;&gt; We're maring to Zion. Beautiful. Beautiful Zion. We're maring upward to Zion. Zion, that beautiful city of God. The hill of Zion yields a thousand sacred sweets. Before we reach the heavenly field. Before we reach the heavenly fields. Oh, walk the golden streets. Oh, walk the golden street. &gt;&gt; We're maring to Zion. &gt;&gt; Zion. The beautiful, beautiful Zion. Zion. We're maring upward to Zion, that beautiful city of God. And let our song let our songs abound and every tear be dry. We're marching through Emmanuel's ground. We're marching through Emmanuel's ground to fairer worlds on high to fairer worlds on high &gt;&gt; we're maring &gt;&gt; we're maring to Zion Zion &gt;&gt; beautiful beautiful Zion we're maring upward to Zion That beautiful city of God. &gt;&gt; One more time. We're maring to Zion. Beautiful. Beautiful Zion. We're marching upward to Zion, that beautiful city of God. Let's give a hand to the Lord this this afternoon. We thank God for his word. Praise be to his name. Glory to his name. Wonderful message. How many are happy in the Lord? Thank God for the word of God this morning. Praise be to God. Thank you, brother Gift. God bless you richly for yielding this morning. It was just wonderful, wonderful to hear the word of encouragement to see oursel to see what God think of us. How God sees us. Amen. Special group, special people. Amen. Sometimes we don't feel like we are special but in God's eyes we are very very special. Only the message of the hour can tell us you know we can't God can't live without us. &gt;&gt; It feels a little bold bold to a bold saying but only the messenger can say such things such statement God can't live without us. &gt;&gt; We cannot perish as God can never perish because we are very special in God's eyes. You know, sometimes we feel like Gideon. No, you are a man of valor. Really? Me? Me? Look what I did yesterday. You know what I did yesterday? No, no, no, no. That that's someone else. May maybe it's the deacon. It's you. You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you. Special in God's eyes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The masterpiece. That masterpiece. You are the masterpiece of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. How many are decided I'm I'm not going back. I keep going all the way. Nothing will hinder me because it's not me holding. It's God holding. &gt;&gt; Let's sing together. I am resolved. I am resolved. [Music] &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; I am resolved to longer to jump by this world's deep.

Oh, I am resolved to go to the Savior living my sin and strive. [Applause] He is the true one. He is the just one. He has the words of love. Oh, I will listen to him. And so glad and free. My Jesus Jesus, he's the greatest highest. I will come to thee. [Music] I am resolved to follow my savior. Faithful and true each day. I will heed what he saith. I'll do what he will. He is the living way. How we how we how we sing to him so glad and free for Jesus greatest highest I will come to thee. &gt;&gt; Verse four. Oh, I am resolved to enter the kingom leaving the path of sin. Oh friends may oppose me, foes may beset me. Still I will enter in. I will hasten to him. So glad and free. Oh Jesus, the greatest highest I will come to thee. Let just each one of us just praise the Lord and thank him for what he think about you and how how he considers you and yourself. How you have seen yourself in the word of God. Just praise him. Just thank the Lord. Raise your hand to him and praise the Lord. Father, Lord, we thank you once again for your grace this morning. Thank you for your word. Thank you, Father, that he came with power and demonstration. Thank you father that came to reveal to us to remind us who we are in in your mind father in your heart that we are special people special people could receive the word of god who could testify that this is nothing else but the truth we have been chosen like Mary was chosen we are father the elect lady of this age father we are predestinated ordained unto life father no devil no hell nothing can separate us from the love of god We are part of you Lord. We thank you father the grace in our life. We love you Lord. We appreciate you. We thank you. We thank you father that you chose us before the foundation of the world. We thank you father Lord Jesus Christ that nothing can put us nothing can separate us Lord for our victory. We are on the winning side. Father as the team has expressed it at the beginning. We are the team that is winning because Jesus is on our side. You already won the battle Lord. We just have to accept the word and walk with you. Lord, we could not even save ourselves, but you saved us. You chose us. That the most important thing, Father, we thank you, Father, for your grace. We thank you for the love of God in our life. We thank you, Jesus Christ, that hell and he hell will pass away. Earth and earth, earth and heaven will pass away, but your word shall never pass away. The C genes inside of us will come to perfection. The rapturing lays within us. Father, for those who are born again, they have already have the resurrection inside of them. Thank you, Father, for that. For making us part of you, part of the body of Christ, member of one body. Lord, thank you for the victory. Thank you for deliverance. Thank you for healing. Thank you for saving our loved ones. Thank you for bringing us Lord in a higher level of revelation the vine and the oil Lord those who cannot be touched you have put an h around us we thank you we love you Lord may you bless your people may you bless the servant he used this morning brother Gift as you'll be again ministering this evening restore the strength within you father we commit everything to you we love you and appreciate you in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ we pray amen Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; You may if you came maybe a little bit a bit low on the low side, but after after such a great message, you just feel, oh, you know, I can face anything now because God has recharged me. Amen. And knowing that I'm I'm the David of today. I'm the Shamga of today. I'm the true Hebrews children of today. I'm Joshua of today. I'm Caleb of today. Give me my mountain. No matter how the giant is this mountain belongs to me. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Just want to read one scripture as he was reading. Says don't look at don't don't don't complain. Start start claiming. You know sometimes we complain we look at the situation we look at this. We look at this. No. Don't look at those situation. Keep your eyes on the ball. Keep your eyes on the word of God. That's where your victory is. Don't look at Romans 7. Romans 7 is our flesh and the ups and down, but Romans 8 is the inside. And let's read Romans 8 once again. You know the scripture, but just want to let read it once again. Romans 8:33. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? Think about it. It is God that justifith. Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that died here rather that is risen again. Who is even at the right hand of God who also make intercession for us? Amen. Put yourself for you. He's making intercession for you. Who shall separate us from the love of God? Who can separate you from the love of God? Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall tribulation mean tribulation will come? shall distress distress will come. Persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword, those things may come. Amen. As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. But nay, in all these things, in all these things there, though they might come, we are more than conqueror through him that loved us. &gt;&gt; We didn't even love him first. He's the first who loved us. Because he loved us, we know we are going to overcome him because his love can never change. For I am persuaded that neither death, neither nor life, angel or principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any creature shall be able to separate me, separate you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
