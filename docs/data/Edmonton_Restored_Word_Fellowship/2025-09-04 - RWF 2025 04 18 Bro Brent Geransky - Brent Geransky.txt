Amen. Well, I want to thank brother Mo. Can I call you Mo? I just seems like I want to call you Mo. Brother Mo. Thank Mo for being me here and brother Zigg. Thanks for the opportunity to come here today and be with you all. You know, I don't uh I can say I guess I don't know a lot of you real well, but I can say this. I do know your father very well. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. And you know my father in fact we have the same father. Amen. Amen. That makes us brothers and sisters in the body of Christ. Amen. So it's so wonderful to be here today and you know sharing the same goal, the same focus. You know it's be to be a representative of him on earth. Amen. That's what Calvary did to show to the world at the character of Jesus Christ to a dying world. That's really what we're supposed to show here. Because when Christ comes into your life, your goal, your focus now becomes to reflect Christ to that dying generation out there so they can see Jesus Christ. He didn't die just die in a tomb, but he actually raised and now he's living in your heart and working through your flesh. Amen. Amen. My You know what? May not be big in quantity here, but you know, God's looking for quantity. He's looking for quality. Amen. &gt;&gt; It don't take many people to have the Lord Jesus to come where two or three are gathered. And we're so thankful. I count a lot more than that here this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're so thankful he's in our presence. And Amen. We know that God is good to us and he's faithful and always comes where he's invited. So, did you invite him here this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust you bought your little lick of fire. Brother says, "And we all bring our licks of fire that brings the pillar of fire." Amen. Amen. Well, God bless you all. I have a subject on my heart. I was going to I brought it here last last summer back home, but I'd like to turn to the scripture here. We'll get right into the word here to kind of save a little bit of my time here and I don't want to preach too long to you though. But um we'll see if we can get through this here in reasonably good time. Amen. Good to see you, brother Blaine. Good to see you. The other ones here. So listen, God bless you. A few of the other ones. God richly bless you. I've seen some of you around. Don't really know your name that well, but you know what? So thank to be part of the kingdom of God. Amen. Amen. Let's turn to Job chapter 19. And it's along the lines of what uh of the Good Friday. Of course, we want to make that kind of our theme, but want to take a a bit of an angle here that maybe I'm sure you probably heard, but maybe on a slight different angle. You know, the word of God is so just you you can't preach it. There's so many there's so many different avenues you can go with with the word and the scripture. It's just never ending, you know. Amen. Job chapter 19 25 and 26. And we all know this scripture very well. Read your Bible. heard it preached, heard it on tapes. We know that it's a very familiar scripture, but we want to kind of look at Job. Just look at what he's talking about here this morning. And you know, thousands of years before Christ came, here's what he's talking about. Amen. Let's read verse 25. And we all know the scripture says, "For I know I know that my redeemer liveth &gt;&gt; and that he shall stand at this l at the latter day upon the earth. And though the skinworms after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh I shall see God. &gt;&gt; Now we can see that and say, "Oh yeah, of course we can see we we're going to see it come to pass over." But Job live thousands of years before this happened. That's quite a revelation for a man to have. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go just a couple of chapters down to Job 23:es 3-6. And and now now let's let's think how Job's thinking here now because he wanted to see God. He wanted to see him. He wanted to know him in a more personal way. And that's what he was trying to that's what he was kind of expressing to himself here as we as he goes along here. And he said this in verse three. Oh that I oh that I know knew where I might find him. Think of that. that I might come even to his seat. For I would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments that pleadings and so forth. For I would know I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me. Will he plead against with me with his great power? No. But he would put strength in me. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh, isn't that wonderful? Joel was just You could just enter into that, can't you? You just see a suffering. Amen. Go to finish off with Romans chapter 5 verse 10. Romans chapter 5 verse 10. Chapter 5 verse 10. Very good. Amen. And it reads like this. For if when we were enemies, think of this now. enemies, not friends, enemies. We were reconciled to God by the death of his son. Much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You have your seats. So, as we're looking at this at the scripture here and so forth, and as we look at Job and his and his suffering and and so forth, we we we can enter into Job's suffering to some degree, can't we? You know, we look at his at his suffering and so forth. But, you know, many of us haven't faced the things that Job faced, but you know, we we enter into it because we we realize there's something in his heart that's just really wanting to come out and to see a manifestation of the word of God. Amen. So he, you know, and he and Job lived a holy life and he obeyed the commandments and so forth and he did everything that he had a revelation of. Now think of that now. Job had a certain revelation and everything that he did, he had a re he had a revelation of that he he did and so forth in his children. He said, "Well, per adventure that they might sin and so forth, I'll offer a sacrifice for my children." And that's all that was available is blood of bulls and goats and so forth. But he offered a sacrifice because Job was a righteous person and he wanted to see his family saved. Amen. And that still should be true today. Amen. We still see all the sin and the rampage and so forth and we should be able to make sacrifices of of worship and praise and and sacrifices of prayer for our children. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when so we look at Job and and you know and he you know God looked at on him as well and and God you know bragged to Satan on to about Job. Amen. You know, and he and that's quite something for God to do that when you think of it. Now, wouldn't you want God to brag on you a little bit to Satan? Say, "Look at my son. You know, look at my daughter at Edmonton. You know, if sin's all rampant, and there's this sickness and sin and disease and all these things around and so forth, but my son and my daughter are right in the midst of Edmonton, worshiping me, living a good, clean life. And I'm proud of them. Look at them. I can put my confidence in some of those people." Amen. Oh my. Why would that be nice to hear that God say that of us? And I believe he does. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, so so yet, you know, uh, you know, Job didn't have a complete revelation of God. We know that it was limited and so forth. Yet we we look at his ways and so and and you know the thing about it is is when Job was fearing and brother B talks about that and and Job was c fearing certain things and you know many times let me just say this right now many things that you don't understand in your life many things that you don't have answers for in your life right there Satan is right there to create a fear in your life that's exactly what happened to Job said exactly what Job feared came upon him &gt;&gt; you So, Satan's going to be right there when there's the unknown and you don't know what to do about a situation. I don't know how this is going to turn out and I can't see down the road very far. Just remember, don't let fear slip in because fear and doubt is what Satan uses in this day to keep you back from God. &gt;&gt; And if we've ever fought fear and doubt and we've ever had that, it's in this lady age. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, there might not be a whole lot of fear, but it's the it's the state of being fearful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you think of it, what have you got to fear? &gt;&gt; What have you got to fear? &gt;&gt; That's it's a good question, isn't it? &gt;&gt; You're you're here and you're healthy and so you might not be healthy, but regardless, God's got a promise and so forth, and God provided all your needs and all these things, but yet we struggle with that, don't we? Some more than others. But we won't get into that too much here today. But but look at this now. Right. Right. It's that that's where fear is sitting. Right at that door is when you don't know what to do about a situation or how it's all going to turn out. Now look what brother says here in the book of Job. It says here Job feared and what he feared it actually happened. What brought it? His fear did. &gt;&gt; See that's what made it happen. His faith would have kept him. Oh. Oh. Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh. His faith would have kept him from it. Oh, I see. So, so when you have faith, you can't have fear. So, why why do you think Satan tries to get you to fear so much? is because you can't have faith and what God wants to see. He says, "Will I find faith when I come back?" Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, we got to know the tactics of the enemy &gt;&gt; because soon as that fear slips in, faith cannot have a good foundation to believe God and believe for his promises, believe for his blessings, and believe for everything that you have need of. Right? &gt;&gt; Let me finish it though. He said it brought it to him. He was scared it was going to happen. It did happen. Now, I would be knowing it wouldn't have happened. It wouldn't have happened. But see, see what I mean? If you're afraid when you come by the prayer line, well, maybe I just haven't got this face sufficient. Oh, okay. It'll never happen. Don't worry. See, but if you know what's going to happen, it'll happen. It's actually a substance of something. You see, so it actually has to be in you. And you can't doubt. You actually has to have a substance. Something saying, "I believe God's promises. I got faith. I see it in the scripture. And I'm applying it to my life. I'm just going to keep it nice and simple and say, "God, if you said it and you promised it, I believe it." And that settles it. &gt;&gt; It's just simple, friends. We over we overdo it so much. We think so complicated about faith. It's just like just like it just it's so common. Just like just like faith when Moses when he when he struck it just simple common weed. That's all it is. You have faith to leave here, right? You have faith right now that your car's in the parking lot, don't you? Yeah, &gt;&gt; even though it's a bad city, &gt;&gt; you locked your car and you have faith. You're not even thinking about it now. Maybe you are now cuz I mentioned it, but in general, you're just going to walk out there and you're going to take out your keys and your car is going to be right around the corner. &gt;&gt; That's just simple faith. &gt;&gt; That's all it is. &gt;&gt; Just simple. Just think exactly the same way with the word of God. It just says it. So, I believe it and I'm resting on it. And there nothing more needs to be said. My life's in his hands. I believe his words. Because just remember, friends, we can't lose this thing. When we if we get sick and say, "Well, what if God would take my life?" Well, what if God would take your life? You're going through a far better place. &gt;&gt; So, what have you got to lose in this thing? You're not my subject here, but let's let's keep going. Maybe somebody needed that. Think of this now. You can't figure things out. See See, God's faith in you comes to the rescue. You realize that? See, God's got a place of faith inside of you. You see, when you come to Christ, and you know, how many believes the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; Amen. How many are Christians? Amen. So, when you come there and you come, the only way you could come is that God supernaturally had to place that seed of faith in your life in order for you to even believe what you're believing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't even believe unless there's a seed of God, there's a faith inside of you to believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you wouldn't be here. You wouldn't believe it. You say, "It's just nothing but this and that, whatever. I don't care. I'm not believing. I'm just going forth." Yeah. You don't got the faith. &gt;&gt; When his faith is placed inside of you, &gt;&gt; whole different story. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. But you can see now how it consumed Job and his thinking and and and you and he looked at nature and he and he saw a pattern. Amen. And and he looked at every tree, how it lives and how it dies and then how it lives again. He looked at every every every blade of grass, how it is living and and I see it dying and and then all of a sudden comes forth again. Wh why why is that? And you know every flower and all of nature is acquainted with resurrection. You see, so Job didn't have the answer. And he says, "And everything lives and everything dies and and everything lives again." He says, "But what about mankind? What about us? What happens to us? What is our end result? Why don't we live again? I see people going into the grave, but what's the final answer? What's going on here is God? There's got to be something else. &gt;&gt; I'm not seeing here. &gt;&gt; Now, that's the foundation of a good Friday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where Good Friday had to come. &gt;&gt; Think of this now. Everything has this, but man has no resurrection. What what what what happens here? And and you see that did cause a fear in Job. You see, any man that's got, you know, any man that's got any sense of God about him in this day would realize and and would start looking ahead at his future after death, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And say, "Okay, okay, I live till 30, 40, okay, I'm going to keep myself in shape. I'm going to run. I'm going to jog. I'm going to, you know, lift weights. I'm going to keep myself really buff. And I'm going to eat all this all this stuff and organic and healthy and all those things." That's good. That's fine. You might live another 10 years, 20 years. You might live till 80, 90, 95, but what about after that? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, well, well, something will be figured out. No, you're going to get old. I don't care. Your bones are getting old. You're getting old. Your skin's getting wrinkly. Your heart's getting weaker. And all those things are coming upon you. You have a day that you have to prepare for. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. So wouldn't it behoove all of us and we I trust all of us have here but any common sense thinking person would think yeah there's uh I I got to be looking at my life here past this &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; now think of this now you're preparing to make ready for the next life now you're not looking to live in this carnal flesh and you realize that this carnal flesh has a certain amount of days and certain amount of years and it's all over no matter how healthy you are or what you do and how you live. You've got to face that someday and you've got an appointment with God. Amen. So, you're not looking under this world system and and but rather what you are is you're looking for a home. You're really looking for a land beyond the river. You're looking for the saints that have gone before. You're looking for something crying out in your heart. There's got to be something more than this. I I've never seen it with my eyes. And my five senses don't declare, but my six sense faith declares that there's something beyond this other realm that I can't see, I can't feel, I can't smell or taste, but I know it is there. That's your six sense. That's faith speaking right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something. See, that's what brings your healing. See, if you know that you know that you know that just beyond this last breath there is life, can't you take that same faith and ask God to deliver you, to heal you? &gt;&gt; Can't you do that if you know that you know that you know you see we even gave him an extra special blessing in in this in this generation that we lived in. God knew how sinful it was going to be and so forth. And God had a man by the name of William Brandham. And God allowed him by grace to go over and see just beyond this last breath. Now, if that ought to give you an encouragement, friends, I don't know what will because God allowed him to see just beyond the last breath. And not only for him, but for you and for you and for the bride in this last age. We've got something to look forward to. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just beyond &gt;&gt; this last breath, &gt;&gt; there's something something inside of me. &gt;&gt; That I can't explain that my five senses don't declare, but I know that I know that I know. And I believe that vision that the prophet had. And you know what? I'm going to be a partaker of that vision. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be one of those ones and say, you know what? We are resting on that. We are resting on the message that you sent through your prophet. We are resting on the restoration that what you said and those messages are the truth and it's backed up by the Bible. We don't need any more proof. We've got all the proof we need. We know what is true and we're standing on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think of this now. See, so something inside of Job's heart was beating just like what you had. You can't prove anything with a natural eye, but he just knew that he knew that he knew. And he just saw a matter of there, but he see the saw the huge chasm between God and man and what the difference was of sin that separated them two. &gt;&gt; He saw man over here so sinful and remember the days of Noah had, you know, and so forth had already passed and, you know, here is Job on the other side of it and so forth. You see how sinful man God got God and God to destroy it. And here he sees over here and a holy God and a righteous God. So perfect, so holy. A million sons, brother M says, will be black in his sight. Oh my. Wow. What a holy God. &gt;&gt; What a sinful man. &gt;&gt; What a huge chasm that is. &gt;&gt; That's huge. &gt;&gt; Absolutely astronomical. I can't even think. Then he had a revelation of that and he saw that huge chasm. And so that's why you go out. If I could if I could only speak to you somehow. If I could just if I could just go to you, go to your door and knock and just look at you eye to eye like a human to human and just just just have a little talk over with you. Said, "No, no, no, no. He wouldn't he wouldn't he wouldn't build he wouldn't tear me down and he wouldn't kick me in the dirt." No, but he would put strength in me. &gt;&gt; You have that much of a revelation of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. But look at Job. All these things that happened to him. Look at the revelation Job had. This is coming right now. He said how he faced all the suffering, all the suffering, all the suffering. How could he say he'd put strength in him? Why? Cuz there was something holding Job through all those trials, all those temptations, all those tests. And he said, "No, if I would talk to him face to face, he would put strength in me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's a strength giver &gt;&gt; through all those trials. &gt;&gt; He's the one that gives strength. &gt;&gt; Oh my What a God. &gt;&gt; That's what he's thinking. There's got to be someone. There's got to be something someone somewhere somehow that could bridge that gap. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Someone somewhere. Job said, you know, I I want to do right, you know, and you see, I want to act right. I I want to live right and talk right. And you see people in this world and they're all confused and they see the churches over down the road over here in these certain denominations. Think, well, yeah, that's that's fine. I want to live holy. So, but I don't see them living holy. I don't see them talking holy. They live like the world. They act like the world. They talk like the world. They dress like the world. There's nothing in it but a bunch of hypocrites. I can understand that, right? You see, but there's something inside wanted to do all those things. Let me just say to you today, that's God's faith in you. If you can take it and God will reveal the truth to you, you'll see a truth and God will open himself right up to you. &gt;&gt; But just see that in this day. I have a sword for some of those people and you and you try to talk to them and so forth. But you know, you know, but Job was saying, you know, I have that I live right, act right, you want to talk right, and do all those things, but I need more than what I got right now. &gt;&gt; How many can say that? I love the Lord. I got the message. I I I trust I got the Holy Ghost, but I I need more. I need more of God in my life. There's certain things hanging on me that shouldn't be hanging on me. There's certain things I got to go through and certain things I faced from my family members over the years and it's come right through and I can see I face the same temptations and I struggle and I got weights. Let me just tell you there and you don't have to live that way. God's got a deliverance for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think of this now. I got a desire to do right. Who can change my sinful nature? Who can take the desire? There it is right there. Who can take the desire &gt;&gt; of sin away? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where I just want to sin all the time. You know, that's a really good example of where you're at with the Lord. If you really got some, am I born again, Brother Brand? I don't know. But I tell you one thing. Check your desires. If you still have the desires of the world and still feeding on those things and you enjoy it and you love it and you just that's your element. Just remember the spirit of God can't be in there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see that's simple. That's nuts and bolts preaching, but that's absolutely the truth. &gt;&gt; You've got to check your life. I got to check my life. &gt;&gt; Is God there? What am I feel? What do I want to feel? What is my desire? Do I get it? Do I get pleasure in being in the presence of the Lord or is it just like a constant constant ah I got to get out of here. I got to get out of here. Why? Because you feel conviction. That's why so many sinners they don't want to be in church. They want to be able to sing. So when the Holy Spirit comes down and they don't want that in their life and they don't they're resisting resisting resisting it's very uncomfortable to be in church, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. It is. &gt;&gt; Think of this now. But now Job was saying when he caught the vision, he says, "I I I I couldn't tell you the name." He says, "You didn't know the name. All he knew is I knew him by a title. And his title is the re my redeemer. He says I know my redeemer liveth. But now we can boldly say thousands of years later we know of a man. Amen. We know of a man. I say I can't heal myself. I can't save myself. I can't do anything of myself. But one thing I do know, I know of a man that can do it. Amen. And he is the one that can bridge the overwhelming gap between God and man. And his name is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, we got a revelation of that &gt;&gt; and we are the recipients of that. &gt;&gt; That's right. So, we're going f 2,000 years past Job and seeing and 4,000 years actually now, but we're seeing more closely to the end of the book because we're in the end of the book right now. Amen. We're seeing all these things come to pass. Think of this now, Brother Ram said here, see what what was what was he doing? See, he was bridging that huge gap that seemed so impossible to gap. And I can't, you know, we I can never build a a far enough uh side here or here to make it far enough for you to realize how far of a gap that was. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But now think of this. Look at brother says he's right in the midst of his distress. Job right while the very darkest of hour was just in that g great crucial moment. Then came down the little lieuh and began to speak to him telling him that the flower had not sinned but he but he was the one that sinned and that there was there would be a resurrection. someday there would be a just one who would come make conformable to this world and in the form of God's image. Now think of this now. He's telling him now that there's going to be someone that you eventually can go knock on his door and say hello mister. Hello God. Can I just sit down and talk with you for a little while? &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; What a man would take upon him the form of sinful flesh otherwise and would stand in the breach. Look at this now. between an angry holy God and a sinful man and would put his hands on both of them. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; and bridge the way. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; If you could just get a grasp on that, just truly get a revelation of that, things would be different for in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you realize the love that flowed out from God himself to you to you to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You put your name in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at this. My redeemer liveth. See, Job have a See, look at this. How Job's incredible revelation was in the back of that day. See, Job had a revelation of where to be buried. You know that he said, "Don't bury me anywhere here. here. Bear me in this area because that area is going to be called Palestine and I'm actually going to be buried there. But you know what? The others down through the ages said, "Don't bury me here. Don't bury me in Egypt." And Joseph had that same revelation. Says, "When you come out of this land, which you are, because God promised it through his prophet." He says, "When you come out, don't bury my bones here, take my bones with me because I want to be buried in Palestine." Isaac, Jacob, all the patriarchs, they got buried there because that is where they want to bury. And that's the same revelation that we have in this day. Don't bury me in sin. Don't bury me in this denomination. But bury me in Christ. That's all I want to be buried in. Just let me die with Christ so I can live again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just let me be buried with Christ. &gt;&gt; Because we're buried with Christ. We raised with Christ. &gt;&gt; You see, Christ is already raised. So that's why we're not we're not living. We're not seeing a a tomb full of bones in Jerusalem. And we're seeing an empty tomb and an empty grave showing what that there will be an empty grave. There will be an empty tomb of our loved ones that have gone before cuz there will be a resurrection in this day. And God will take all that flesh that had died under all those years and make them come right out of the grave again. &gt;&gt; My goodness. That's what your God's capable of. Not only capable, he say he's going to do it. &gt;&gt; Bury me in Christ. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you do. I don't care where else you go. See that revelation they all had? &gt;&gt; And you fast forward it to this day. I don't care what happens. I don't care what goes on. That's why we same thing. You know, friends, that's why we got to teach our kids that the same thing is I don't care what you do. Just remember one thing. Serving the Lord is the most important thing important decision you'll ever make in life. Yeah, you'll buy a home, you'll buy a car. You make those think those are important in the natural. Yes, they are important. We need to have them in this day and day. But just remember one thing. There's nothing more important in your life than surrendering your heart to Jesus Christ and give it to him and letting him use your flesh in this day. That's what you were created for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my It's more important than anything. Brother says it's the most important decision you'll make in your life. &gt;&gt; Anybody know the second most? &gt;&gt; Marriage. &gt;&gt; That's really important, too. &gt;&gt; Look at this now. So, Brother Bam talks about a bridge, God bridging the way for mankind. I want to take a natural type just so you can kind of go through the types and so forth. Bman talks about about a famous bridge and he talks about the Sydney Harbor Bridge in Sydney, Australia. How many have ever gone across a Sydney Harbor Bridge? Nobody. All right, that's pretty far. It's pretty far. It's in Sydney, Australia. You see, and and he says it connects the central business district to the north Sydney. So, it's a connection between the between the between the the water and so forth. So the Sydney Harden Bridge say I find it interesting that the bridge he uses from the natural to the spiritual type was actually built in an area full of previous convicts and criminals. You know that's what Australia was, right? They sent all the criminals there. All the convicts. And I tell you what, that's in the natural. But I tell you what, if there's ever a place ever a way that needed to be bridged for convicts and criminals say, "Well, brother Ben Brand, I never stole. I never did this. I never been charged on life. You might have a clean record according to the police report and so forth in the natural. But I tell you what, we were enemies with God one time. And we were convicts and criminals in his eyes. But God took that very same bridge and he put it right in the heart of all the convicts, all the criminals, all the worst of the worst. And said, "That's where I'm going to build my bridge." Cuz those are the people that need me, that want me, that desire me. Not the people that think they have everything and they don't need God. Boy, do we ever see that in this day. &gt;&gt; I don't need God. &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't need God. Okay. Well, just wait till you go on your deathbed here. &gt;&gt; You'll see how much you need God. &gt;&gt; You see that? You see, you can see the worst sinner. Many of times they'll say God in some form or fashion. They'll reach out to some higher power than them. &gt;&gt; Oh, God says, "Be careful. Don't do it all. Don't mock me all your life because at your death, but I'll just laugh. Find me when I can be found. &gt;&gt; Brother, do you believe in a death, bur resurrection? Absolutely I do. The thief on the cross had one. &gt;&gt; I tell you, I don't want to wait till that time. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just barely squeak in, barely last minute. I want God to take my life. And when I'm a young boy and I can serve him when I'm a young boy, I don't care if you're 5 years old, 10 years old, 15 years old. You can do something for the kingdom of God. But I don't want it to stop there. I'm to take him right through my teenage years and my adult years in my marriage and in my grandchildren. I want to see a life fulfilled where I can serve the Lord and be a help and edify the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Not just barely get in. Amen. Not just barely get in. Think of this now. See, these are the ones, the people that aren't the big somebodyies, the people that think they got everything. And many times, and I'm not saying you can't be rich in this day, but God doesn't always take the popular and the rich and all the famous people of the world because he cannot use them. There's nothing in them that he can use. See, you're placed in those in those people. Look at all the generations all throughout time. It's many of the simple people that could might not have much of the world's good, but they could receive a God. They could receive it and say, "I'm nothing. I always will be nothing." And you know what? God, you're so holy, and I'm just a sinner, but God, you you said you have a way for me. And that opens up that bridge. Amen. Look at this. Now, brother says this. Now, in this word, in this way, we like to like in the word of God. God is a great architect. He's a great builder as God puts in his building nothing but the very best. And I would liken him this to the story I read of the great Sydney Bridge in Sydney, Australia. Many years ago, they decide to build a bridge across the great straight of water there that connected north and south Sydney. Many come to bid, but up into England coming a renowned contractor who had a reputation behind him that he wanted to build this bridge. Now, though his prices was high, the people Sydney didn't mind that they wanted the bill the bridge built right. &gt;&gt; All right. So it took them 55 years to build that bridge. &gt;&gt; 55 years to build that bridge. &gt;&gt; That's crazy in our terms nowadays. We think 1 2 3 4 5 years maybe with the advanced technology. We have 55 years to build that bridge. The price was high. Very high. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I'm always thinking spiritually now. This gospel came with a great price. &gt;&gt; This gospel came with a very high price tag on it. But God said, "I'm not going to cheap out. I'm not going to get some cheap garbage and so forth to build it with. I want the best of the best of the best to be built in that bridge because there's going to be many depend on that bridge one day and it's got to be built right for my children. &gt;&gt; The price was very high. &gt;&gt; Very very high without money without price. But there takes a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; It remains the tallest steel arch bridge in the world today. This tallest steel arch bridge. Brother says, "I think every Christian ought to take the same attitude." That's right. We want to know where we're standing. We don't want our eternal destination built upon the shifting sands of some church theology, right? Built on but on the eternal word of the living God. Because remember, every one of you sitting here tonight, stormy times is going to hit that building you're sitting in tonight. &gt;&gt; What's your building? Your flesh. &gt;&gt; Stormy times are going to hit your building. &gt;&gt; And you're going to come up through some hard times. death's going to strike and you better know what kind of sand it's built on or what kind of a foundation that it has. &gt;&gt; This man's name was John Bradfield, chief architect from England. He started planning. The planning started in 1914. Could that Oh, thanks, buddy. Forgot one. Why do I need one? Well, I get excited about the word of God. If there's anything we need to get excited about is the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We may get excited about sports and about a certain food and we get all excited about those things, but man, we should never get more excited than the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, the planning started in 1914 and the construction started in 1923. Now, think of this now. Sorry. When I took them and said took them 55 years, I'm in 55 years to pay off. I'm sorry. I made a mistake there. took him 55 years because the price was high. So it took him 55 years to pay this bridge off but the construction took six years to build 1923 to 1929. So it took numerous years to build but the price was very high. The debt was very high for for for Australia but they wanted it built done built right. It took them 55 years to pay that off. So uh when you think of this now the planning started when it when it did 1920 or construction 1923. See, it took a lot more planning than it did actually building. &gt;&gt; Now, think of this. Now, God before the foundation of the world knew that there had to be something. &gt;&gt; God had planned it way, way before you were born, way before Job was born, way before the world was constructed, way before all he was was an eternal presence. Not even God yet. But in his mind and his planning, he said, "There will be a man on this earth that I can call a savior that I'm going to come and I'm going to redeem mankind." That planning took thousands, millions, trillions of years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But planning for that one day, &gt;&gt; one day, &gt;&gt; one day, &gt;&gt; today, &gt;&gt; Good Friday, &gt;&gt; all that took so long to plant. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; But look what he did. Christ was only on the earth for 33 years and yet thousands of years. All the prophets, all the sages, all the ones prophesied, he's coming. He's coming. He's coming. Job says, "I want to see him." Ezekiel said he's the me wheel in the middle of the wheel. And here comes Elisha and Moses. There'll be a prophet like unto me. All of them prophesying, prophesying, prophesying, prophesying. And here he comes on this earth. There he is. I am standing on this earth right now and I'm here to do my job that was commissioned to me before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Think of this now. Everyone prophesying is going to come. See, many architects came from all around the world. All around the world. You see what happened was is they dug up the soil and they dug it all up and they dug it up and they took samples of sovere like any good architect would and they took it up and they said to said they said to Sydney they said that bridge cannot be built. There's way too much quicksand there and he said it just cannot be built. It's absolutely impossible. He said but brother said it took a man a vision. Oh. Oh. Someone just then the ordinary common area common guy actually had to have someone with a vision and seeing and not only looking what's present right in front of him but actually looking into the future and seeing something that was actually possible although considered impossible are you men of &gt;&gt; are you men of vision are you women of vision &gt;&gt; do you see the vision of your life oh my friends it's so nice to see prophecy and we read in this book all the prophecies of what's coming to pass and the lady Osia And we see all these promises to the believer. But let me ask you a question, friends. It's good when it's in here, but can you place yourself inside of this book? Can you place yourself inside of these prophecies and realize I am not only just looking at the prophecies and reading in the prophecies? I am come part of the prophecy. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am fulfilling prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everyone's fulfilling prophecy in this day. You know that. &gt;&gt; Whether good or bad, they're all fulfilling prophecy. Look at Pharaoh. He was fulfilling prophecy. &gt;&gt; Look at Moses. He was fulfilling prophecy. Two people fulfilling one for the good, one for the bad. &gt;&gt; There's only one question to ask yourself. &gt;&gt; What side of this prophecy are you fulfilling? &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, they all said it just cannot be done. No, just can't be done. Too much quick sand. Forget it. You bunch of convicts and criminals. It ain't never going to get this bridge done. There's no way. There's no possible way. So, forget it. We're not doing it. And it just will have to be this way. You have to take the boat, whatever would be. It's just it's just inconvenient. I know. But, you know, this bridge cannot be built. So John Bradfield had a little bit different vision though. He think he saw everyone thought it was impossible to build but he looked at it from a different perspective. You see you think of this now brother said but this man was a man of vision and he knew that what he was talking about for something down in him told him he could do it. Look what brother says. God give us men in the church like that. &gt;&gt; Give us people in this church here this morning. Give us people in other churches here this morning that can look at the promises, look at the blessings, look at this word and saying, "I know it was written and I know it's on the pages. I can read it, but I want to become part of it. And I realize that if my faith can actually contact these promises if I believe, &gt;&gt; I want to make this book real &gt;&gt; because it is real. It's just how you're looking at it, friends. If you can receive it by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. My oh my. Men, someone there, they're fighting something that they're fighting for. What are you fighting for? Figure that out. Why are you here this morning? You're fighting the devil. You You're showing God what side you're on. &gt;&gt; Number one, right? Just like that blind was blind and a blind lady and so forth or deaf, I think, whatever it was. Or she's really severely disabled. They say, "What? What do you go to church for? He said, "Well, you know, nothing else, I always want to show the devil what side I'm on." Amen. &gt;&gt; I might not get a lot out of it, bear, but I'm just letting you know. That's why I'm coming. I'm showing God. I'm showing to the devil what side I'm on. And this is the side I'm on. I'm on the right side of prophecy. I'm on the right side of the book. And I believe it. I can say amen to it. &gt;&gt; Look at this. Now, pick up that sword. You see, you're commanded, you have a sword. You're commanded to not only take it out of the sheath, but you actually commanded to use that sword. And God's given you that sword for a specific time and for a specific reason for your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Each one of us has it. Jesus used it against the devil, right? &gt;&gt; And it was absolutely perfect. So if he's still God used the sword and it worked for him in his day, and if he's given you that sword, what do you think it'll do for your life? &gt;&gt; Think of this now. Brother Bam talked many times about that story. He said the Jefferson fire uh Jeffersonville Fire Department would come and he says there's a big fire one day and he says they come out and they How many knows that story? &gt;&gt; Jefferson fire. All right. He said he comes out and he says, you know, he says they come out and all the men are there and the captain comes out and he says, you know, squirt a little water over here, boys. Squirt a little water over here. And he looks over squirt a little water over here. He says there a bunch of a bunch of amateurs. He said, "Here comes a Louisville fire department up banging down, clanging down." And he comes out and here comes He says, "Who else but the chief captain himself." He comes and he steps on the ladder. He takes an axe. He throws it through the window and he says, "Come on, boys." He didn't say, "Go on, boys." He led by example. That's what Christ came to do. He came to pave the way for us so we can access all those promises in God's word. He didn't say go on boys. He said come and follow me. &gt;&gt; Come on boys. &gt;&gt; Come on girls. &gt;&gt; Are you going to follow me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, it may be tough. It may be little. You may have some un unanswered questions over here and over here. You may not see what's around the corner, but I've already made the way. Just follow my way and I will guarantee you. I will promise to you eternal life. &gt;&gt; Just follow my path. Come on, boys. Think of this now. Look what brother says. I like a man of vision. I like I like a people that's got something they're fighting for. &gt;&gt; Not just lay around. Well, whatever comes along, that'll be all right. Oh, be up and at it. And Lincoln never again let his education stand in the way. You may say, I got 10 degrees. I got one degree. I may not even finish high school. Fine. I didn't either. Yeah, I'd be considered just like a low life in in today's world. But that really doesn't matter in so many aspects of our life. It's your your relationship with Christ. Get that right first and God will lead you what you need to do. Amen. If it's education, no, whatever it is, just commit your ways to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some I think every Christian ought to be that way. Find your purpose and go do it. &gt;&gt; Wow. Every member of this chapter, not just, well, we have a breakfast once a month. That isn't it. or once every Saturday. Have a purpose in life, something you're going to do. God has placed you here. Let's do something about it. &gt;&gt; Every member, oh, here it is. Every member of every church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That includes all of us. &gt;&gt; All in Edmonton, all in Calvary, all in Saskatchewan, includes every member of every body. If God took the time to save you, God's going to take the time to keep you. And God had a purpose for you. That's why he saved you. Not for you to sit around and do nothing. But God's got a plan for you. He says, "I want you to build up my body. You're part of the body. You've got a purpose. So go find your purpose and go do your purpose." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. God just don't waste time saving people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Think of it. What kind of a God would that be? &gt;&gt; He just saves them. Okay, whatever. Yeah, okay. Go, go sit down. You have to wait for the rapture. Come on. I'm not saying this in an illegalistic way. We got to work. That has nothing to do with it. But you know, friends, that's the difference. So when you become a Christian, you don't look at it in a legalist way. Well, I better come to church because you know what? What will so and so think? Well, you know what? Well, it's just the right thing to do, so I I better do it. You know, you know, I should give to this person because it's the right thing to do cuz I'm a Christian. You see, a legalistic way, you know, brother said justice comes naturally from your heart. You do that and when you see what the bridge created for you to bring you back into fellowship, someone just emanates from you. I just do this cuz I want to show my appreciation to God for what he did for me. And I'm just doing this from my heart. &gt;&gt; There's the difference. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; There's the difference. See, I don't want to live a legalistic life. I don't have to do nothing for my salvation. God says it's a free gift. &gt;&gt; I have to work for it. I have to keep working for it to keep it. Once you're saved, you're saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, brother also talks I'm getting off track here, but I hope this is okay. He he talks about he talks about inheritance, though. &gt;&gt; You know that. &gt;&gt; You see, you see, depending on on what kind of life you live, if you're saved and God truly saved here, you're going, you have eternal life. Once you're saved, it's a complete work. It's done. You received it. You're on your way. But between here and here lies your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. What kind of inheritance do you want up there? &gt;&gt; Well, you know, Brother Bren, I don't need a gold house and all these things. Oh, but but what about your family? &gt;&gt; You realize that's part of your inheritance? &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, so that makes it a lot more important now. My Oh, yeah. You mean through my right decisions and my good living and helping out and and doing what I can and so forth and living on example Christ, you mean I can actually have inheritance and and get an inheritance in my family? Oh yeah, you can. You go look that up. I wish we had time. We'd go into it. But think of this now. Let's keep going. I I got off track here. But so here here he goes here now. So the John Bradfield, what he did is he came he he couldn't say yes or no to the bridge. He said, "I got to go test them myself." That's a very good thing for you to do. You see many critics in this day. Wow. This person over here, this group over here, this denomination over here, all these things, all these people that did a bunch of hypocrites, so forth. Why don't you go find out for yourself? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother says, "Go do that." That's the best thing he said Nathaniel did. says he went and saw for himself if it was the truth or not. So he came and tested the soil and he said he looked at it and he came to the conclusion. He says I will build that bridge. He says I'll build that bridge. Christ oh keep your thing spiritual thinking caps on here. &gt;&gt; Christ looked at you and he looked at you right down through time and he looked at your very being, your very soul, your very heart. He looked at all mankind and he says, "Is it worth to suffer so much for them? Is it worth it?" He had to ask that. He had to answer that question. You know that. &gt;&gt; Is this worth it? What I got to suffer for them? Is it worth it? Oh my. He said, "I see the great gulf, the great chasm, and I see how sinful they are." and he counted up the cost and he realized how how incredibly hard this was going to be. And the most sweetest the most important words, the greatest words you'll ever hear in your life came out of his mouth. &gt;&gt; He says, "I will build that bridge." Amen. I will build that bridge. I will be the goto. I will be the go-between between man and God. Amen. I will restore fellowship. I'll restore that relationship. I will be that chasm between law and grace. Now, we're talking about that bridge. Just remember John Bradfield's reputation was at stake. Christ's reputation was at stake. Amen. every there said there therefore every bolt and every piece was tested before went into building that bridge. He said but the most critical every a magnet get this he had to have he put a magnet on every single bolt that went in to make sure it was a steel bolt. Every bolt think of that now how many thousands of bolts he tested every single one of them. He didn't do a halfways job friends. Christ when he came didn't do a halfways job. He didn't go half-heartedly. He looked at you and he looked at me and with his full heart and with full confidence looked and realized he said, "I will die for mankind because I love them before they first loved me." &gt;&gt; Oh, I got to quit here right aways. I don't like to be one of those long-winded preachers. You know, I get I keep people for about 45 minutes to an hour. You know, that's just maybe it's a psychological thing, but you know, unless you really got on people something they're very interested in, but you know, in general, we're human beings, right? We get tired. But I'm almost done here. Now think of this. Now he say he so he dug and he dug and he dug until he found that foundation. And that's why when he looked at the at the soil he realized that way beyond that quickening sand there laid a foundation there. And if he just dug far enough and long enough he's going to come to a solid foundation. and friends and you may be in this life. You might be digging and digging and digging and it doesn't seem like you're getting anywhere. You're digging through all the quicksand in your life and the quick sand in your life. But one day that quickening sand, if you keep digging, will turn into a quickening power and you'll come and you'll reach that foundation, Christ Jesus. And you can come to that and you can build your life upon that foundation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think of this now. &gt;&gt; Wow. How God did that? Brother says, "When between the old New Testament, he spanned his plan of salvation and hoisted up an endgth hill. It was timeested." Oh yeah. And that bridge is still there today. Years, hundred years later, that bridge is still good. People are still using that bridge. It still is working. Everything that he went to putting into that bridge is still today. Let me tell you something, friends. 2,000 years ago when Christ died, that was great. But it's still in effect today. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Look at this now. Just a little more. Did you notice he couldn't die on earth and he couldn't die in heaven. Oh, so what was So he was the bridge between. See, that's why he died between the heavens and the earth. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a beautiful type. &gt;&gt; That's why he went to the cross. &gt;&gt; That's why he wasn't on earth and he wasn't in heaven. Who's the gap &gt;&gt; between man on earth and a god in heaven? Oh my think of this now. We become part of you as we come become part of that bridge. Do you realize that? &gt;&gt; Every bolt of your bridge will be tested as well. You see, because you're going to be a time tested true Christian. You see, because you're we're coming down to some harder times. I don't mean to scare you and this is just the reality of it. You're going to be coming through some harder times and you and all these things. Yeah. Just like a soldier when he's going through training. Brother M talks about that man and the sixcond smith whatever his trainer and he said just just hammer me out and he knocked him out of the ring. Says K like you know when he was a noticeably heavier him says why have you been so tough on me? Just being so tough on me. He's like you don't have to like kill me early. He says he says you may not appreciate it now. He says, "But you wait till you get into that ring." And he says, "Your body can take a lick and you'll keep the blood keep flowing." And he says, "I found out he was very right when I got into the ring." And that's what Christ is doing. Christ is molding your life and putting you through trials. Why? Because you have to be able to be tested to go into the great rapture. &gt;&gt; I don't want to live a soft, easy life and never get trials, never get test. What kind of character we would have, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oh my. But just as God gives them. I don't love trials. That's why I hate trials. Hate them. &gt;&gt; Never want them. God, give me more trials. Please. I guarantee those never come out of your mouth. God, just please give me suffering. No. No. I don't want it. But I realize inside something says, "But even so, whatever it is, Lord, you need to me to get ready for the rapture. Please &gt;&gt; allow me to go through it so I'm ready for that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think of this. We'll finish up here. It's your fault I'm preaching so long by the way. I feel good. He said, you see, was a see you see the bridge was there to bridge mankind. But do you realize that bridge between? See, God needed a bridge to be able to bless his children with certain things. And he needed some chasm. He needed a chasm built in between. He needed something going in between. So now, brother Ram says is that when God br Jesus Christ came and and created that chasm or created that bridge between the two, he says now he says God could flow all his blessings, all his goodness, all the gifts and he went and sent down gifts to man. Do you realize all the gifts that we have in the body of Christ, it was because of Christ? &gt;&gt; Brother says he's just rolled them down the bridge right to mankind. Rolled them down the bridge. It's all through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's who gets the glory. It's not mankind gets the glory. No one else does. It's Jesus Christ that gets the glory in every one of our lives. It's not about us, friends. Never has been. It's not about me. I don't preach to show that I'm saved. And I don't preach because God I preach because I'm called. Yes, I feel that way. But you know, if I wouldn't preach, brother says, I never preach another sermon in my life. I'd still be saved. &gt;&gt; Really? Oh. See, because you're saved, you're saved. You're saved when you're there. When you've come, God's provided way. He says, "But I do it because I love him." &gt;&gt; And that's what it is. It becomes a love relationship between you and Christ. I do it because I want to do something for the kingdom of God and I want to glorify him. And if God so choose me for this, great. What does he choose you to do to glorify him? He is looking at your life in particular. He's calling out your name and saying, "Son, daughter, I want to use you to glorify my name." &gt;&gt; What a privilege. &gt;&gt; What an honor &gt;&gt; that you are sitting here this morning and can see through the eyes of Revelation that God wants to use you for something in this last day. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; That That's humbling, isn't it? &gt;&gt; How could we ever turn that down? &gt;&gt; Think of that. How could we ever get so carnal in our mind and or or so discouraged in our mind to think, "Oh, God's got no purpose for me and I'm just so and so and I don't got any talents. I don't got anything." All God wants is your heart. It's all he wants. When you think you can do something, you just better back right up. I don't think I can preach. I can't preach. I can't. But one thing I can do is say, "God, you can do it. If I just get myself out of the way and you speak to your children, that's fine. And if you want to use me for that, but I got no talents. I got no gifts to offer you. All I can offer you is a surrender being. Say, "God, you take over. You do it. And you get the glory." No man gets glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As soon as you do, just remember one thing. You're going downhill. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And ask the musicians to come up. Come on. We're going to be done here. &gt;&gt; Remember, we're still on a holiday, you know. We're in holiday mode, right? &gt;&gt; Think of this. Now, I want to something I just got last night. I want to insert this because a lot of times people when they look at Calvary and they look what it did, but here's a here's really the essential reality of what Calvary did. You see the atonement, what the atonement did for you. You see, there's three parts here and they're all so beautiful. Where do you want to play? You're Peter, aren't you? Peter. God bless you. Nice to see you. I like I know him. I know him. He's like, "Yeah, brother Peter Dirkson. God richly bless you. So nice to see you again." Amen. Yeah. Just play whatever you feel in your heart, brother. Think of this now. There's three beautiful parts to it. The first one is expeation. You see, when God died at Cal Christ died at Calvary, he said there's a first part. He said, "Was it the experation part?" You think experation? What was that? What is that? Expeation means to pay for the wrong that has been done. You see, and that's what Christ came to do was to pay for all the wrong that you had done. All the wrong that all of mankind had done and to absolutely pay pay the debt unconditionally and completely wipe it. That was the experation part. And Christ came to do that for you. That's what a good Freddy Friday represented and paid for your sins individually, took them upon himself and went to Calvary. That's why the That's why you can say that debt is paid and and you we sing all those songs and the debt's been paid and that that great debt to mankind and all those things and and my and me personally all the sins that I remember I did back in here and and over here and over here and over here and every debt every sin that I ever committed and all the iniquity I committed. It's all forgiven me. If you've come, he's provided way and repented of it. It's all forgiven. And you think, "Wonderful, brother Brent. Wonderful." And you know what? It feels so good to be justified, &gt;&gt; doesn't it? &gt;&gt; And there's so many people, I'll just go one step further. There's so many people in this world that have experienced that justification. And it feels really good to get that,000bs off your shoulders. But I tell you what, it goes a little bit further than that, though, too. It's not justification, although wonderful as it as it as it feels. Here's the next part. I want to give an example actually. Let's say brother Moses say brother Moses forward my car. Moses, brother Brent, I need a car for a for a for a couple days or whatever. All right, no problem. Here's the keys, brother Mo. All right, takes it away. don't hear from him for a while. And after a week or two, whatever, or two weeks later, he comes back and said, "Here's your car back." Okay. I look at it. He, "Oh, by the way, um, I got into an accident." But, um, but I tell you what, I'll tell you what. I went to the body shop and I got all the parts, all the right parts, everything. Everything's all fine. You look Look at it. It's all It's all good. It's all good. Okay, that's good. See, that's what experation did. It actually took something and it actually took away all the wrong and replace that and say all the sin's gone, all it's gone and so forth and now you have your own carpet. But you know what? There had to be another step with Christ. God paid the whole debt. But just because brother Mo made the car back and paid that debt and made everything back, that doesn't necessarily mean I've got a proper relationship back. You see, I really appreciated brother Mo when he when he took my car. We had a good relationship. when he comes back, my relationship might not be the same, would it? Well, yeah, but I forgive you, but our relationships may be a little different. Like, but emoji, you never told me like, you know, I'm sorry, but like it's, you know, it's going to take a little bit here to restore the relationship. You see where I'm going with this? You see when Christ in order for Christ to come back to the relig original relationship with Adam in the Garden of Eden, he actually had the had to have the ability to forget every sin that you ever have create committed or ever will commit. God had to actually completely forget that he ever committed a sin. And if I never remember, brother Mo did that, my relationship is just the way it's always been. I'm no big deal. I don't remember anything. I don't remember an axle that you got in my car because but we have the ability to remember but Christ at Calvary took upon himself the ability to forget every sin that you ever have committed or brother says ever will commit. &gt;&gt; Oh &gt;&gt; what do you mean ever will commit? That's what Calvary did. Not just the past but it covers your future too. every sin that you will commit. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, it's already forgiven. So, what do I have to do? You just have to repent when it comes up. When you sin, say, "God, I forgive you." He says, "It's already paid for. I knew you were going to do it. I knew you're going to ask for repentance. It's already forgiven and right to your final destination." &gt;&gt; See how powerful it is to be able to forget something when you did somebody wrong. Don't you wish you you you have regrets in your life? I wish I would have said that to so and so. I wish I would have done this terrible thing in my life. Now imagine if that individual completely forgot about it. Would it make you feel good? &gt;&gt; And they treat you like nothing ever happened. Oh, wouldn't that feel good? That's the same thing Christ did with you. That's the same way Christ looks at you today. Like you never sinned, you never committed a sin. You never will commit a sin. You're perfect, justified under the perfect blood of Calvary in his sight. Amen. Oh my. And what's the last part? Just what we read. Reconciliation. That's putting expeation and putting propitiation together to form a full reconciliation, a full relationship restored. You see what that bridge did? did so much. All you ever did, h how could you turn them down? How could people turn them down in this day when they realize the price that was paid and all the things that happened in my life and they're all completely forgotten and forgiven and the sea of God forget God's forgetfulness. And if Satan ever tries to bring that up and tries to bring up your old sin, just put a sign on that in the sea and say, "No fishing allowed. You may have I may have done this but God can't remember it. So if you remember it that's fine but my God that's perfect can't remember it. I'm not trying to remember it. It's from the sea of his forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand. Let's all stand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Think of this now. Let's be a bridge builder. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you realize God predestinated you to be a bridge builder, too? &gt;&gt; How do you build bridges in your day? &gt;&gt; What's your name again, sir? God bless you, brother Andrew. I don't know you, but God bless you. I sure love you. I appreciate you, buddy. You just serve the Lord with all your heart. You do what God's promised and wanted you to do in this last day. Amen. God bless you. You go to the other churches, too. Say, "God bless you, brother." You build those bridges and you keep those bridges built. Just remember the body doesn't have any shism in it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So if you truly believe someone's in the body of Christ, you be the bridge builder as well. So we love you guys who are praying for you and you see a need in another church might not be in your own church. Let's go a little bit further friends and need another church. Say, "Oh, you know what?" Or send a text or you might do something, say, "I heard you going through such and such." Just to let you know our church, we're praying for you guys. Wow. I mean, you can be a bridge builder. Sure you can. Let's be that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's be the bridge builder that Christ wants us to be. Let's sing a couple songs. All right. &gt;&gt; You sing a couple songs. &gt;&gt; You know that song, Won't We Have a Time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that song, Key of A. You know key of A is the Canadian key, right? Amen. Won't we have a time? Oh, we'll have a time. All because of that bridge. Oh, won't we have a time? When we get over yonder, won't we have a time?

God bless. Go all the glory to God. Amen. May God bless his servant. We really enjoyed it. It was It was good. It was marvelous. We thank God for the bridge. &gt;&gt; If he didn't come, if he didn't come, if we didn't have that bridge, where will we be? &gt;&gt; Yes. He represented that cross. We were right here at the bottom &gt;&gt; and he's right here on the top. If we didn't have that bridge, &gt;&gt; where would we be &gt;&gt; still here? Nothing. No way to go up. &gt;&gt; But he had to come down to our level &gt;&gt; to bring us up to his level. &gt;&gt; That's God's grace in our life. &gt;&gt; Why would you reject that? Why would you reject that grace? It doesn't condemn you. Sometimes we condemn oursel because we reject to hang on that bridge to cross over. But this morning it has been so well preached that God I want to cross that bridge. I want to walk with you on that bridge. Keep me near the cross. Keep me near you, Lord. Keep near me.
