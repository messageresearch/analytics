He has forive me. My sins have been washed from his memory. [Music] By the blood of the lamb on calary him he has spoken me.

Let brother Steve take over right away and thank you for for for the for all the worship. God bless you richly. Brother Steve, let's sing the same song he has. Oh, he has forgiven me.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we are coming into your presence this morning knowing that we've been forgiven. Lord, &gt;&gt; more than that, Lord, we've been justified. &gt;&gt; Lord, we know, Lord, that in your eyes, we never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Amen. And &gt;&gt; Lord, we've been restored to be standing in your presence, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I pray, Lord, that you may come down this morning and as you already did through the worship, but now we're looking forward, Lord, for you to come down through your word and teach us and guide us in all truth as you promise. &gt;&gt; Be with us this morning and take every spirit under your control because Lord, we are united in this desire. We want your spirit to move &gt;&gt; to move in our lives, Lord. And we don't want to leave any door closed and uh any rocks unturned, Lord. We we want you, Lord, to to be to have the freedom to move in our lives and in our families, in our marriages, Lord, because you have the keys of all those things. And may you help us this morning as we surrender oursel to you. &gt;&gt; Give us Lord a good time in your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray Lord in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. Certainly happy to be in the house of the Lord again and to be with you. And so this is our second service. I don't know if there's a lot of new people this morning that were not there last night. Last night we kind of did an an introduction and I I thought we would be able maybe to dive right away last night but I just felt that the Holy Spirit made us dwell into the church transition the pastor's office and also a little bit to deal about sometime the misunderstanding that we have in our ranks about how we view the message and how this this prophetic can al also be scaled down to be appliable in your in our houses, in our marriages, in our families. And I explained last night how much of a a burden I have for families coming from a broken background, fatherless home and many different things has caused many hardship for me. And as God dealt with me and to bring answers and and healing, it became a burden to share with the the people of God. And I've been had the privilege to do it. in many places around the world and know Moses heard me in Edmonton and different places, family camps and so he wanted me to come and just to share and open my heart and so this morning we will go right into some um I'd say basic principles of the word of God that are appiable for our life and it's my my prayer that this would be a help. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So um we will turn in the book of Genesis chapter 2 24 as our opening scripture. So unfortunately I won't be able to repeat everything I said last night. So if you if you're jumping on board this morning, well you have to you have to jump in with us. Amen. Genesis chapter 2 verse 24. So I want to thank brother Moses for his invitation and also I really felt last night that we were free and at ease just to share those things and we had I believe a wonderful atmosphere &gt;&gt; and and that is that is a blessing because we can all relax in the presence of God. No tension no and just hear what God has for us. Amen. Genesis chapter 2 verse 24. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh. And since we're there, we can also uh go uh just a little bit before at verse 18. So this morning, I'm going to use both of those scriptures to lay some principle. And as you can see, we're in the book of Genesis. This is where it all starts. And we will have also have to go to the genesis of our life where everything started when we were a child. A lot of problem we face today are related to the genesis of our life. A lot of problems we face in this society 2025, they try to fix problems in 2025 with 2025 solution. It doesn't work. A prophet brought us back to Genesis and revealed the mystery of the trauma &gt;&gt; our world and our society and and and and in human nature and human creature experience a trauma in the book of Genesis. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then it got hidden. Nobody knows what happened. &gt;&gt; It was an apple. It was this. It was that. No, no. something happened so seriously that it jeopardized &gt;&gt; and threw off course &gt;&gt; everything after that &gt;&gt; you got to go back to the genesis of the problem &gt;&gt; so if this applying for this world and our civilization it applies to our lives too &gt;&gt; amen so that's why we start with the book of Genesis so Genesis chapter 2:18 and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him help me for him. Amen. May the Lord add the blessing upon the reading of the word. You can be seated. &gt;&gt; You might pull my PowerPoint. Thank you, brother. Want to thank that tech text tech support in the back. They're doing an amazing job. I felt like this morning there's a special theme that outside of all the the songs were about the Lord and all thing. I kind of find a a trend of of there's a lot of French songs. So I felt really I felt felt at home here. Felt at home with all those French song. For those who doesn't know me, I'm from Quebec. So I'm a French Canadian and so all our service back home is French. I preach in French all the time. And so we felt at home this morning with many wonderful songs. Amen. So for those who were not there last night, so I got I got a great burden for families first of all because I come from a broken one. no sibling, no father, just a mother and try to make it. I was raising the message and and and and then I married a pastor's daughter who came from a family of five, raised with two wonderful parents and a and a good balanced church. And and me, the broken guy, comes in happy to serve the Lord and have the Holy Spirit, but a bit a bit clueless about family. Doesn't know what a father's supposed to do. And and and and living on my own all my life. Um, I've read the scripture. It's not it's not good for men to be alone. I can talk about loneliness. &gt;&gt; I was raised with that overwhelming feeling of loneliness. So, I can talk about loneliness, how it's not good and it was it was not God's plan for us because he saw Adam and Adam was alone. He says that's not good for you. It's it's not good for anyone. So, as we're starting to have one kids, two kids, I'm clueless is what I'm getting into. And on the third kids, that's where I realized, okay, that I'm missing something here. Uh, and and and it was a great adjustment for me. My wife was all happy. That was her life, you know, the house full of kids. For me, it was like, whoa. And so I had to go through a lot of unlearning and then a lot of learning not to wreck those wonderful children. I had to change course after the third kid. I had to change course because I was heading the wrong way. And so a lot of things that on my heart as a pastor and having teach on family many places and it's I preach that in many places not because that's the only thing I preach about but I get invited because of that because people feel that I have something to share and it it comes from a burden. And so we've we've had the privilege to raise those four daughters and a and a son in in the presence of God. We did we did many mistakes, but when you learn the principles, you catch your mistakes quickly. &gt;&gt; And then by God's grace, you're like, "Okay, I just crossed this principle here." And if and I and I and if if I keep crossing that principle, I'm going to reap something bad. I need to undo this. Also, a problem we have a lot with parents, and I went through that myself, is that when we realize we're not going it the right way with our kids, we change course, but we don't inform our children. We kind of put it under the carpet. It's like, oh, that's a bad way I'm going to do this. But we don't resolve the confusion in their minds like, yeah, dad used to be this way. He never said a word, but then he changed like he why was it? Was it me? Was it him? He's too full. he's too proud to kind of acknowledge that he made a mistake. And there's this idea that if if if parents, you know, go to their kids to apologize because they they went at it the wrong way that that would jeopardize their authority. And then that's wrong. That's wrong. It's actually it's the contrary cuz we don't fool the kids like inside of them. They know like he was wrong, now he's doing it differently and that doesn't say a word like nobody knows. We all know it. Then the kids talk to each other like, you know, dad, you know, he used to be this way. And then he never said a word. Like what's the problem? Is that humility? And and so I've I've learned to sit with my kids and do family counsel. And it's like, you know, dad was doing this and that's not the way. It didn't please the Lord. So we're going to change course. And you know what it caused? It doesn't remove your authority. It build respect in your children. It's like, okay, if my dad allow himself to make mistake and own it, then I'm allowed to make mistake and own it myself. &gt;&gt; Then as parents, then we going to blame our children. Why? Why don't you ever own your mistake? Then the child's confused like, "Yeah, what's my problem?" Well, we see as we see the we do as we see the father doing. That's a biblical principle. Jesus said, "I'm I'm I'm doing what I see the father doing." That's a law. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, we don't all just hear the words of our parents. We do what they &gt;&gt; we do what they do. So, I'm getting way ahead of myself. So there's a lot of pull in in this place right now there. People are hungry. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we we set last night a sets of sets of rules. We just want to go quickly. But none of none of the principles and you kind of got a taste last night how can it be it can be really sensitive and those can be used as a weapon to attack parents, pastor blame somebody. So none none of the content the material we want to bring in the word or principles are there to blame parents member at church blame the pastor blame somebody it's not about to blame it's about first of all to understand those principles it's to get corrected if if we have to change course and then it's also to find healing or say okay okay that I was raised in this and and and then that for the first time I hear that that's not God's way God says Jesus said I came to heal the brokenhearted there is any broken people then it's all linked to childhood. &gt;&gt; So God's God is interested to resolve the confusion in our mind because many people were raised in confused family. Well they love the Lord. They went to church but back home it was not 10 on 10. It was it was there was a lot of confusion. Uh I was causing a lot of confusion in my own house. I was preaching I filled with the Holy Ghost and God was moving in the ministry. But when I was stepping inside the home, I was causing more despair than good because of a mindset of how I think family should be run. I was I was I was working against my own interest and I didn't know it. So we can be great at church and have great faith and all so maybe we can have effective ministry, but that doesn't give you success at home. Ask Moses. &gt;&gt; His own son was not circumcised. &gt;&gt; He did. He did he did such an amazing thing. He brought Pharaoh to his knees through the power of God. Opened the opened the the the river and and and led like he's a leader. But when he go back home and you think that God gave him a pass? No. He sent an angel says you have this great ministry but you're not even taking care of your son &gt;&gt; and he had a wife to step on the scene and and did it for him. And so it's not and I think that sometime we have this we have that thought that because we're Christians and because we believe the message we get it pass. Well I applied the token so everything's going to be fixed by itself. We got to get rid of this magical thought. Family is work. &gt;&gt; It's how much you invest. This is how much you're going to reap. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's a family series that won't be much of a series because we have we have little like we have just this morning and tonight and last night was more like an introduction. I thought that we could dive in, but I felt the Holy Spirit kind of make us go different avenues. So, we want we don't want to come with a with a set of program. We want to follow the leading of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But I feel like this morning we have green light. So, we're diving. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So one principle and so we're going to lay few principles and the reason is it is really hard to be a parent. It's really hard to be a husband and it's really hard to be a wife unless we know oursel actually we read the verse yesterday in book of Ephesians where where where God is asking the husband to love his wife as you love yourself. So the capacity that's a law that's a principle in the Bible love your neighbor as you love yourself. So the capacity or being able to love somebody is related. How do you view yourself? So if you don't know yourself, you don't know your makeup, you don't know where you come from. It's really hard to be able. So myself, I came from a broken past, but I didn't know I was broken. I thought I was fine because I was a Christian and and I married a wonderful person and I was effective in many areas of my life. And so I thought I was fine, but I didn't realize that family-wise and father-wise I was I was broken. And because I I was broken, I didn't know. I didn't realize I couldn't love my my my children properly. Because it was part of myself was not doing good. Okay. So one principle here is then uh when there's a law here that a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh. So this word cleave mean they going to bind together. Okay so God's purpose so if you're going to bind with your wife and become one it means that before that you were bind with your parents and before you were bind with your parents you were one with your mother. We don't have time this morning to talk about the transition. As a young age, you're a son or a girl are one with the mother. They were inside. They're they're so linked. They're so synchronized. They're so together. Like almost like when they get born, uh the the the father is almost like a stranger. I'm sure you brothers know how it feels. Uh when when it's baby, you take it, he cries, and he cries. You give it to mom and he's happy. He's like, "Okay, well, I guess I'm just a visitor here." And we don't realize that our season comes later &gt;&gt; and sometime sometime we get discouraged like I got discouraged at one point because it feels like well they're not my children there's they're Esther's children and and I didn't realize that it was there's a season for the mother and and not that that one is totally not there and but but they get me there's a season where they relay at a young age is mostly about the mother but that's going to take a turn at at one point right around the age of 12. That's exactly what Jesus went through. He went to the temple and then Mary's like, "Where's my baby boy? Where's where's my baby Jesus?" Well, Jesus was not a baby anymore. But she ran tried to protect him. Oh, where is he? Where is he? And then Jesus stepped in and he said, "I'm about my father's business." So somehow there was a transition where where Jesus turned from his mother to the father. And that transition is so important. And there's a series I've preached just on that. We that's not the topic this weekend but it's it's just to say that and then from there from the mother to the father then the man or the woman will cle the woman will cleave to a man's vision and they'll become a separate unit or the man will come will will go from the mother transition to the father which a lot of transition are fail because this concept is totally missed and especially North America in North America we don't understand the principles of what is a father, what is his role. &gt;&gt; That's why that's why there's many fathers who quit. &gt;&gt; Uh they just walk away. My father just walked away and so they walked away because they don't realize the role they have. &gt;&gt; We have example in the Bible because God when Jesus got baptized, God steps and trinitarian really like that because for them it separates God's and tree three but but it's not the idea of a trinity. It's the idea of a principle that the voice of God as a father said about his son. This is my son in whom I love. He's my beloved. &gt;&gt; And so what he's doing is that the father and that's a law and many culture has this ceremonial transition around 12 years old. This ceremony where the boy has to leave the mother and go to the father. and he's been called in the men's world. And when you don't have that ceremony, you have a lot of men that are being little boys inside, stuck in a woman's world. And that's why they struggle so much with women because they're never been called out of the woman's world to become real men. And so he's a little boy inside and he's stuck in a woman's world and stuck in the denominational world because he's never been called out. But that principle has been laid by God when he said not only once but he said it twice showing the progression in the sun first of all it says this is my son. There's many men here still waiting for their dad to say this is my son and I'm so proud of him &gt;&gt; but that day never came and because of that you have a little boy confused inside still waiting to be called by the father and praise the lord that there's amazing grace. My father never called me out, but one day caught God did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as as as this special song we heard this morning, we are in our father's house. &gt;&gt; And so you're not doomed. You're not you're not you're not cursed if your dad never did it because God wanted us to step in on the scene and say this is my son. &gt;&gt; But God did it. God did it twice &gt;&gt; and then he he put him in a position. We understand those things. But those things are not just like big prophetic big thing. As I said, we need to be able to use those great big principle prophetic large like spiritual thing and scale it down to understand that if those were there, they need to be applied in the natural. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So once once the father call the son then the son's going to be become a unit by itself and then he's going to get attached to his wife and then become one. So there's there's something that needs to happen. And so another key, another principle, those are not just simple scripture. You have to see those as laws of nature. Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old, he will not depart from you. We we we hear a lot that scripture when when when a teenager goes astray or something goes bad, then we claim this scripture and rightfully so that well I train up the kid, right? and so it's going to turn out right so I put my trust and yes I agree but we need to understand that sometime we're like I train up the child the right way so we think and because we brought him to church we brought him to Sunday school we read Bible story but we're going to listen we going to we're going to study this morning how the prophet explained that God requires more than us than just to read Bible story and bring the kids to church It's not a guarantee of success because there's many thing in the recipe that need we need to do in which the prophet explained but as I explained last night we don't have time there's a great misunderstanding in our ranks we've we've went so spiritual and so prophetic that we've missed the simple principle of family life and call that psychology and a bunch of nothingness and this is just material for denomination. We're the bride. We're above this. until the family totally collapsed and like we're like and then we're confused. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're going to study those principles this morning. And and and and so God never intended for you to feel or to be lonely. Says the preacher was lonely all his life. So, it's not good for a human being to be alone. And we read that in that scripture. Now, is it amazing that when God says that to Adam, because I hear that sometime, well, I don't need nobody in my life. I have I have God. I'm a son of God. I have God. That's all I need. Well, I'm sorry to tell you that God disagree with you &gt;&gt; because Adam was a son of God living in a perfect garden in a perfect body born straight out of the word of God. &gt;&gt; But he was alone. &gt;&gt; He had the greatest connection with God a human being ever had. &gt;&gt; But still he was alone. And when God looked at Adam, he says that loneliness will kill you in a sense. Not die, but it because it's not good. The word good is you will not prosper. You will not you will not do good &gt;&gt; because God is love and he created man human being according to his image. And if God we heard that again big prophetic big thing God was alone with his thoughts wanted to express those attributes he wanted to be worshiped he wanted to have fellowship he transfer those things to us too. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are creature of love like God is creature of love. He's not a creature. You understand? He's a being of love. And and we are also creature of fellowship. We need to communicate. We need to connect not only with God but we need a connection, a lateral connection. &gt;&gt; But when people want to be so spiritual and so up there, they're like, "Well, I don't need those. I don't need anybody." Well, some when when somebody talks like that, you can see that he's been hurt in the past because you're not born with that feeling. &gt;&gt; I don't need no one. I don't trust no one. I I I got God and that's good enough for me. &gt;&gt; It's not truth. You talk out of your pain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're broken and you don't know and that's why you're like this. But God doesn't want you to be alone. And so loneliness will cause a lot of things where you'll you'll need to compensate. So few important principles before we really dies in in those things. So the other thing we need to understand is the subconscious. That's also an underestimated topic where the prophet thought on those things but the subconscious obviously is everything you're not aware of about yourself. Science has many expla explanation about the subconscious and and and and science says that it's it's it's the inner inner man that that you're you're you don't have access to but has it has recorded everything about you your life everything you saw everything you heard every feeling every smell everything and it's all there recording it's like a hard drive that you can't access you cannot access it and it's and then the conscious part. So science says and these are just numbers. I don't know if they're true but it's just to give you like a scale but science says that you know smart people really smart people would have three% maybe 5% I don't know the numbers but something like that of consciousness. So so you you're able to be aware of the three four 5% maybe all the rest you forget. You're like well that's just a fast well I know. Yeah, I know. I was, you know, I was raised and I was horrible. That's just the past like, you know, everything. And and many Christians sometime they think they they they forgave, but they just try to forgot it. They just try to forget it. They didn't forget. They they they never erased it. And in the greatest battle ever fought, the problem says that's the prophet says that's the problem with so many blowup Christians. It's because, we're going to read that quote later, but he says it's because they don't clean up the channels. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the channels of memory, imagination, and so all those things that we went through, imagination, memories, and all that, it's all inside of us. And so there's many qu related to that that that would be like a full sermon by itself. We're just touching it quickly. But he says, you know, you got a subconscious, don't you? We are conscious of that. Well, no, we are not conscious of our subconscious. What he's trying to make us conscious, we have a subconscious. &gt;&gt; Well, okay. So that's the fellow. That subconscious is causing you all the trouble tonight. It don't agree with this one out here. It's scared and backs up. And when it becomes in harmony with this one and this one becomes in harmony with God's word, then you're you're you're going. Then I'll give you an example how it works. I think one day there was a man who was wanted to to to he was doing a challenge that he would cross falls. I don't think I I don't remember if it was Niagara Falls, but anyway, it was Big Falls and it was a rope. And he says, "How many think?" And then he said he was able to to cross the falls with the with a wheelbarrow on a line, you know, on a rope across the falls. And there's journalists on the side and people watching. And then he asked the question to the crowd, "How many believe that I can cross those falls?" And everybody's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." A bunch of believers. Yeah. Then he asked the second question. How many wants to get in the wheelbarrow &gt;&gt; and then he had a whole quiet bunch of people. &gt;&gt; So that's the difference between what you think &gt;&gt; you believe &gt;&gt; and the inside that when you're confronted with your belief, you're like, "Well, no, I'm not going." &gt;&gt; Something inside of you kicks in. It's like somebody that you know they're like young young, I don't know, young boys, they want to do something crazy. Hey guy, let's go bungee. You know what is bungee? You get attached to an elastic, you know, and and you dive off something to something really high and and yeah guys, that's going to be so fun. You know, getting the boys together and we're going bungee together and get and and all the guys, I don't know, they might be 10 guys. They all sure that every all the 10's going to do bunggees and then they get close to it and then they get the helmet and the arness and everything get attached and and then they all excited. Everybody believe a bunch of believers in bunggees. Then he steps on on the side. He's all harness and helmet. Yeah. Yeah, guys. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Selfie. Yeah. Yeah. Step is like, "Oh, oh my goodness." &gt;&gt; What happened on the conscious part? He thought Bungie's great. But something inside says no. And this is the hardest thing to understand. Why did I thought I could do this? &gt;&gt; Why did I thought I could love my wife and be faithful? Why I could Why did I think that I could I could be there at home and I promise myself I'll never be like my dad and I'll stay at home and I'll play with my kids and I'll I'll put them a priority. And then when you have kids, you're do exactly the opposite. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet explained. That's the subconscious. There's something inside you that says no. And that's what happened to me. I started a family. I married a Christian girl, sister. I I started having kids. It's going to be great. I'll be a father until one kid, two kid, three kids. And something inside was saying no. I was so confused and I didn't know why. Then we can and if we're Christians and we're sincere then we start banging oursel we start whipping oursel and what's wrong with me and then the devil gets in and we feel guilt and shame and and because the prophet says that's your worst enemy. &gt;&gt; So when you hear the prophet says William Brahim is my worst enemy and you we understand that we are our worst enemy. &gt;&gt; What part of you you think is your worst enemy? It's that subconscious part that has recorded every trauma, everything you went through. And when we when we talk about trauma and I I made it I made it I make certain that I use modern words. Sometime people are so used to message words that they they missed the point. &gt;&gt; I am not afraid to use modern words. That's right. &gt;&gt; But trauma is something that is overlooked, &gt;&gt; especially in our ranks because we think that when we got born again &gt;&gt; that all the trauma got erased. But I got news for you. Prayer lines and discernment &gt;&gt; proved that childhood trauma would be able to carry across your new birth. &gt;&gt; The prophet was with in prayer lines. The woman is nervous and the and the discernment would run back, right? &gt;&gt; Oh, I see a dog. &gt;&gt; You're a little girl. This and that and made you nervous and you know, so a trauma in a genesis of our life that's hidden. That's what the Holy Spirit does. It will expose had it exposed the trauma of the creation in the garden of Eden because the devil his trick is always to come create a shock a trauma break your innocence and then covers his tracks &gt;&gt; and that's why denomination the Christian world were lost because they're trying they're still trying to find the cause of sin why is our is our our creation and human nature this way and a prophet comes and the same spirit who could discern the genesis of the life of a little girl could also discern what went in the garden of Eden. So we can return and be restored and there is no restoration. That's why this message of restoration had to deal with the trauma of the book of Genesis. For us to return to Adam condition, we had to know how it got broke. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's the big prophetic picture. Everybody says amen. But if we scale it down to your life, it's the same pattern. It's the same principle. &gt;&gt; So we could explain the the con subconscious and the conscious as the parable of the iceberg with brother Donnie Donnie Reagan preach a amazing message. I think he called it the parable of the iceberg. I think I took it from him. But preach I think one or two wonderful message on the subconscious and and subconscious is is like when you see iceberg The ice everything you see on top is just a little portion. When I see you, I see a what's above the water. But there's an inner world inside that have no clue. Maybe your spouse have no clue. Maybe you have no clue. &gt;&gt; And that is why the Bible says that the word is a discerner of the heart. &gt;&gt; Why is the b the word? Because we cannot discern our own heart. Even David says, "Lord, seek my heart." &gt;&gt; I'm still trying to find a scripture where the Bible says that we are able to seek our heart. &gt;&gt; We can try, but we don't have access to that. &gt;&gt; Cuz Jeremiah says our heart is deceitful above everything. And then when we see that scripture, it's like, "Oh yeah, when I was when I was a sinner, my heart was deceitful." No, no, no. The principle of deceitful mean it hides itself from his own owner. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the heart is subconscious and that's why it's only when the word comes that we see ourselves in the mirror. &gt;&gt; That's why some people are afraid to be sitting on the real preaching of the word because it will expose their intention and their motive and why they're doing things. And well, every time I sit in church, I feel like I'm judged. Well, welcome. judgment start by the house of God because the word will judge discern your intention &gt;&gt; or what you're about to do cuz we don't see oursel. &gt;&gt; Amen. David thought he had played a trick with Uriah's wife and Bath Sheba and all that and got him killed and all good good and now she's pregnant looks like all good and and then Nathan comes and when the prophet comes what he does he he he he preached the word because and then when when when when when the prophet gave him the example of the shepherd with one sheep many sheep David is like well you know we should kill that man for stealing this his only sheep like how clueless like he totally forgot God. &gt;&gt; But when the word says, "You are that man." Then the word exposed his heart, he was like, "Oh my goodness, I'm a mess." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And because David was a accord a man according to God's heart. Sometime we think that a man according to God's heart, some not somebody's going to make any mistake. No, David made mistake. But the difference with David between Saul is that David when David was exposed to his mess and that his heart was discerned he would he would repent. &gt;&gt; That's what we need to do. &gt;&gt; So God wants to heal our hearts. That's what he says when in Luke he says,"I came to heal the brokenhearted." Well, I'm not broken. Well, God knows your state. Maybe you don't. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Maybe your wife knows or your husband knows. But then we don't want to listen. So, the prophet says, "We I we got the I got the biggest enemy. He's got I got is William Brham." And so, we got different quotes for that. We I just skipped because we need we got a lot of material this morning but you get you get the point. So that's a principle we want to remember is that the subconscious is running the show. He makes do things or don't do things based on on his own sets of rules that has been fashioned and patterned in your lifetime. traum the subconscious works by what he remembers. It's like a computer, you know, those in the computer world, you understand anti virus. Anti virus is that they're going to detect a threat and then that's why you always need to download the next new version of the anti virus because there's a new threat. So it defines itself to block this. Defines, okay, now we have not to block this. Now we have to block this. The problem with our with our subconscious and our heart is that if we don't forgive and and bring it to the Lord and erase it, it's going to become so much restrictive that it's going to block so many. That is why you have you have and and even the prophet says you don't want to crown your Christian life with a bitter spirit. &gt;&gt; But that's why there's people that as as as they go into life they can be Christian. They isolate themselves even more. They stop fellowshing fellowship because everybody's a threat. And then as they suffer from social phobia. Oh, I I hate to see people. They always, you know, and and and and what they don't know when they talk like that is their anti virus inside that tried to shield them from pain and shield them from disappointment and shield them from betrayal and shield them from this, from abuse, whatever they went through. And they never forgive. They just put it on the shelf shelf. But what they don't realize it that inside of them it's blocking blocking blocking blocking and making them so nervous and so anxious that everything is a threat. &gt;&gt; Because they don't solve anything ever. &gt;&gt; There's a conflict. They run away. Oh, I hate those situations. Oh, I hate that. I hate that. And then at one point they can't move and they trap. &gt;&gt; That's why the greatest things we need in our life is forgiveness. True forgiveness. where we go to God with tears and say, "Lord, that really hurt me &gt;&gt; and I gave you my heart. I was so disappointed, but Lord, take it. Forgive them." They didn't know what they did. And and to really go to a really cleaning of a heart &gt;&gt; and when we don't do that, then the prophet says, "We have so many blow up Christians &gt;&gt; because they don't clean the channels." &gt;&gt; So God is a key for us to clean the heart and to heal the heart so we can remain free. Free for what? Free to love. &gt;&gt; The hardest things when we are hurt is to love. &gt;&gt; And last principle, no the fourth one which a lot of people don't like is that parents are responsible for juvenile delinquency. So this quote a lot of people says amen until they have they have kids themselves and then their kids start have a problem. Then when you tell that quote then then it's not a fun quote &gt;&gt; but it's a rule it's a principle. So our prophet says okay I'm going the wrong direction here. Prophet says that what brought on juvenile delinquency was parents delinquency. The parent failing to take care of the children. The key word here is care. And we all have to define what care is. For many years, we thought care for a man was to bring put the paycheck on the table. And I done my job. I'm sorry, brothers, but when you put your paycheck on the table, it's just starting. Because if it was just about money, then it means rich people have great success with their families, &gt;&gt; which is not often the case. So care is a totally different definition. I'll tell you I think today we have such juvenile crime wave across the nation but really I think it started in the home. I think the parents begin to let go. So that's a really an important principle and when I call it principle it's it's a law of nature. You cannot override those laws. &gt;&gt; It's like the law of gravity. If if a Christian jump off a 30-foot building and an unbeliever jump a 30-foot building, both of them will have to submit to the law of gravity. &gt;&gt; Mo both of them will probably have broken legs. &gt;&gt; So Christian doesn't get a pass. It's not because you're a Christian and born again. You get a pass on laws of nature. And thus I think that's a great misunderstanding because we thought I love the god. I love Lord. I bring the kids my to the church and I I read them the Bible. So then it's the recipe for a great success. It's part of it. Obviously you need God in the house. It's a great thing. But how we saw brother Fandler last night. He's a Christian. He believed the message but then he tried to imitate the prophet and he's trying to cast a demon out of his wife every night. He could have done how how long you think he could have done that until he ran his marriage to the ground, &gt;&gt; but he applied the word, &gt;&gt; but he didn't know how to apply it. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; All right. And the last principle is that there is a cause to everything. Sometime some sometime you know uh the wife files for divorce the husband files for divorce the kids run away it's like I don't know it's just suddenly and and and when I counsel with people and in in which in the message we call interviews just to reassure you uh uh interviews when we sit with people and try to counsel them this is something that that I've heard many time I don't know what happened to my son like it's it's suddenly he turned wild suddenly like and and and we like that word suddenly because because then we don't feel responsible. It's like, you know, it's it's the devil, you know, it that spirit jumped on him and suddenly turned wild and like we we don't understand. We read in the Bible, we brought him to church and like, you know, there was no cause outside of suddenly. No, there's a cause. There's a chain of effect. And we're going to study that this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. So prophet sometimes says we find people going prayer line out across the nation. They just run up and think that the Lord ought to heal them right then. But if said but there is something way down in there. We're talking about subconscious again. And we sat before the Lord until he reveals that what that is. And there is something there's a reason for everything. And you've got to find the reason first and then you can find what to work on. And we got a got have a great example when when when brother Brandham went through a crisis with his daughter Rebecca at 18. And maybe Lord willing, I don't know, but maybe Lord willing tonight we might study just tonight could be just to study the quote. Rebecca didn't start slapping door like oh suddenly she's slapping doors. No, when you read the quote suddenly realize something inside of her was boiling for many years. And then God, the prophet realized, oh, okay, we got to change course here. &gt;&gt; So there's a remedy when you understand what's going on inside of them. But we need to care because if you don't care, you'll never know. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, seasons of innocence, uh, we did talk a little bit about it, so we don't have to dwell a long time on it, but we all had what we call a season of innocence. And in the garden of Eden, the prophet called it the God's economy of innocence. So, he says, call the garden of Eden, he says, notice what happened. The garden of Eden was God's economy of innocence. And that's what one of the dispensations. The first dispensation was innocent. The people know no sin and they didn't know anything about sin. Both Adam and Eve were naked and they were hid from their nakedness and but God, you know, had a veil in their own mind. They didn't know what was right and what was wrong. But they didn't know any evil either. And so if Adam and Eve went through that in our we had a season of our life that we also were in an age of innocence. And and I remember, you know, my you would some of the kids, it was so funny. You change you change your diapers and you got a just a moment you turn and then you're like an easy run. You run and like there was something about them young age like you removed the being naked and running everywhere was so fun. &gt;&gt; It's like come back here and it such an innocence. But at at at one point feel like doing that anymore. Something changed. They lost their innocence. Okay. So, at that age, you're so pure. Even though you're born in sin, you're so pure. You're so innocent. You think it's almost dangerous because you think everybody's nice. And then you have to warn them. If a stranger comes and wants to give you candy, say no sir, I don't want come to mommy. Let And you got to teach them that not you don't want to you don't want to traumatize them before. man. Well, you try to put in a way that, you know, trust just daddy and mommy and be careful. You go and you try to teach them without over, you know, being over the top, but like this is an evil world. You don't know yet. You'll you'll know later. And and you kind of don't want to break their innocence, but you want to you want to teach them. But that innocence, the devil wants like he did with the serpent came. The serpent was watching you as you watch Adam and Eve and says, "How can I step in and ruin that for good? How can I set this young girl or this young boy on the on the off of the track off track quickly?" And on top of that, how can I do this without their parents noticing? &gt;&gt; Because if if if mommy and and daddy realize that something inside just got broken, they're going to care. And love heals. &gt;&gt; But what if and I could in in Adam what what when Adam lost his innocence and Eve what did they do? They hid it because it comes with a shame. Whatever he did it it can be sin or but it can be also be trauma and we underestimate those things. &gt;&gt; We're going to study what happens after. So Satan's role is what? Is to pervert from innocence. And so that innocence was also in an atmosphere. So as we talk tonight, this morning, I'm talking to everyone right now as a kid. Don't think only about your kids. You have to think about yourself. You had a genesis of your life. You were shaped in environment. Some of you had a good environment. Some of you didn't have environment, a good one. But even in a good environment, I believe I raised my children in a good environment. And even though the serpent has tried many ways to come in different way to cause to cause hurt, to cause damage, to break something. and sometime to try to hide it from us. &gt;&gt; So let's talk about the relationship between a baby and a mother. As I said at the beginning of the service, when a baby is born, he is one with the mother. There's in in a such unity. You remember man shall leave his father and mother and cleave become one with his wife. Well, that oneness was with the mother. And that oneness, the prophet explained that it would bring so much satisfaction, so much quietness. It was it was the greatest the link as a baby, your link with your mother was the greatest pill for anxiety. Baby's anxious. Blah blah blah blah. Daddy takes it. Shake it. Shake it. Shake it harder. Come on. You At one point, you have to give up. Okay. Okay. Here's your anxiety pill. go see mama. &gt;&gt; And then the prophet says he's all satisfied, quietened. The mother picks him up and puts on her breasts and begins to hum and rock him back and forth and he feel his mother. and and and more than that science now is discovering with the with the raising of the cell phone and all that that that that when when a mother breastfeed and and the contact in the eyes looking the baby in the eyes bring calms the baby so much and science has just discovered that because now mom is on her cell phone she nurse but she's scrolling Facebook the baby's like nursing but she's baby's trying to find the eyes of the mother but can't find it and they realize realize that babies are more anxious &gt;&gt; because there's not a connection. &gt;&gt; So the connection is broken too early &gt;&gt; and and and science realize it makes it makes it sets the kid with already sets him up for anxiety because there's a loss of connection &gt;&gt; and that loss of connection ties us back to the first principle. It's not good for men to be alone. Men being human being. So when that baby is drawing from the breast but there's no connection he's feel lonely he doesn't know it but something inside of him know him in the subconscious register you don't have to be smart and your brain might not be developed but at six month there's trauma that can be registered &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; there's register that that trauma registered when you were in your mother's womb &gt;&gt; so the prophet explained and and those quotes we overlook for for for us we we we want we want to be so prophetic unless There's the word seal or to the third pool. We read read those quotes like like it's just a little side note like well this just a side note it's not a side note &gt;&gt; he's laying principles simple ones but that we need to learn from these things &gt;&gt; amen. So that connection will make that baby satisfied and day by day he will grow stronger and stronger but not not just physically but emotionally because that is that's the problem right now. Um you humanity is not just weak physically but we are weak emotionally. Everything makes us anxious because something is broken. &gt;&gt; We lost track and we lost sense of fellowship and connection. Everybody is so connected &gt;&gt; to everything else &gt;&gt; than each other. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's a trap. That is one of the root cause of anxiety because we are alone in a super connected world. You can be you can feel alone in a house full of people &gt;&gt; because everybody's going at it but nobody cares really. You know I can ask brother Moses, hey brother, you know God bless you. How are you? &gt;&gt; How are you? Well, you said very good but I don't care. &gt;&gt; How are you? You know, but if I come to brother Moses, brother Moses, amen. How's it going? &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Now look at me in the eyes. &gt;&gt; Do you see the difference? &gt;&gt; Now I care. &gt;&gt; I want to know. Are you good? Are you good, bro? I'm with you. &gt;&gt; Uh, hey, brother. God bless you. It doesn't mean that when we shake hands in the church, we're like looking for this connection and trying to But in the house, in the home, between a husband and a wife, between children, we we we like, "How was the day at school?" Oh, mama. Like, okay. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How was the day at school? You know, we're already doing something else. Or if we sit in the kitchen, sit down. Sit down. Put your put your school bag here. How was your day today? And if you want to know and you're interested and you have eye contact, &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; words going to come start coming up &gt;&gt; connection. That's that's how we spell care. &gt;&gt; But the prophet what causes juvenile delinquency is the lack of care. &gt;&gt; It's not a lack of food, not a lack of roof, not a lack of reading the Bible, a lack of care. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet preached two message. God cares. Do you care? And in those message he explains the the concept of complexes and things of the past that try to ruin marriages. The new the new that just came back from their honeymoon and already they were going astray. They're already falling apart and they went in the office and it's the prophet explained the complex was a dark shadow over this young man trying to bring something from the past. We bring baggage in our marriage because we don't understand. Both of them, both of us bring baggage in in in in in marriage that's going to hinder us. And so care is a big thing. &gt;&gt; And for that, you need a connection. And that connection is the thing that stopped the loneliness. I'm not alone in this. Somebody's in with me. &gt;&gt; So we need that in a marriage. We need that between the husband and the wife. We need to stop and connect. &gt;&gt; And it's important because if we had an argument during the day and we kind of shove it off and like, oh, I always laugh. We know that if we ask, "How do you do?" Well, she's going to come up again with this and it's unsolvable. And we developed this thing that to be able to connect, we have to agree. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Do you know that you can put a disagreement on the side and tell I want you to know that I love you more than this disagreement? &gt;&gt; I care for you more than I care for whatever opinion I'm trying for you to see. &gt;&gt; I care. Okay, we argue. You want a green car? I I I prefer red. I don't know what we're going to do with that, but let's put the red and the green on the side. And I want you to know because when there's do you know that the devil is an expert to fill the silence to fill the void &gt;&gt; when you stop talking do you know the devil that's where he start talking &gt;&gt; so when he does that's why those words you know how even as as God the father's role uh the father's office affirm his son with words we need to affirm our marriage marriage and affirm our children with words, caring words and that for that we need to be able to put aside disagreement. But sometime we cut fellowship until we solve if the god the car is going to be green or red. I'm giving a foolish example but we all have issues. We all have disagreement. &gt;&gt; We're doing renovation bought a house. It's a big project at home. You know that that's many many couple get divorced when while they're building a house. Many church split when they're building a new church program. &gt;&gt; It's a pattern. And you know why? It's because you have so many choices to do. And that's where you realize that you don't want the same thing and you don't like the same thing. And then the devil steps in and says you're not meant to be together. Me and my wife were so different. Sometime it's scary. It is. My wife was worried. She's like what unites us now? Obviously we love each other but our service for God unites us strongly. But if we talk about hobbies and we have different taste for she's an artist, she like painting. She likes drawing. I'm bad. I have no interest for that. I'm I'm in sport and I like computer. She hates computer. So we're trying to find something in common. My wife sometime we talk about she says, "Honey, I'm worried when we going to be retired. I'm wondering what we're going to do." like like, well, we'll see. We'll see. The Lord shall provide. And then we're doing renovation and we doing landscape and whatever I say. Oh, let's do it this way. No, it's not good. It's like, okay, okay, we'll do it your way. And then I think we should lay it. No, no, no, it's not good. It's like, well, is do I've got like, do I have like one good idea? And we can let those things pile up in frustration. And that's where at one point we need to stop and not to and that's where we we we exhaust oursel because we want to base our union on agreement &gt;&gt; and seeing eye to eye which that is called a conditional union. &gt;&gt; God as we don't have a conditional agreement with him. He gave his life. He died for us while we were still a sinner. And that's where we understood it was only by grace. So we need to apply grace to our own couple that okay, we disagree on that. Let's put it on a shelf. Let's put it. Lord, let's pray over this. Lord, help us to solve this. But in the meantime, honey, I love you. &gt;&gt; I want to be with you. You're precious. I care. And so, Satan will fill the void, but we need to remain connected. So, I'm getting way ahead of myself. So, let's go back to the season of innocent. You're pulling me in all kind of direction. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's talking about love. So you cannot do that. Everything I just said, you cannot do it until you have love. &gt;&gt; Perfect love cast out all fear. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If I want to contribute anything to the success of the ministry among people is there's one thing. It's because that I love people and people knows that &gt;&gt; this minister cares for me. &gt;&gt; He's not there to build his kingdom kingdom. He's not there to build a following. He is there because he cares so much for us. He wants me to be better. And because of that the prophet says this was the success of the ministry because I care and people know your wife know if you care. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You remember the story prophet telling you know somebody brother leaves man leaves out the door to go work kiss his wife I love you walks then he returns back and he's like then he gives a real one &gt;&gt; the first one like he's you're not connected. Have you done that before? is like you okay honey by and then you go it's like no honey come back I was not there now I'm there now I care connection it's it's a great fight it's a great battle to stay connected he says you you take a little three months baby the baby three months old he doesn't know nothing he's got a mind of that isn't developed he doesn't know nothing the doctor doctors say they can see light might see your hand but He can only follow it and he will just be kicking his little heels and screaming to the top of his voice. Well, here comes some kind of woman some along passing him says, "Well, dear." He just kicks right on. He don't know who the woman is. He don't know nobody. But let that mother walk up just put her hands on him. Now the prophet says his brain, it's not his brain who knows. He might he might barely be able to see because his vision is not yet developed. But the prophet says his little spirit knows. That settles it. Now he don't know his mother, but his little spirit knows there's something about that spirit there that nothing else can inject that mother love to him. No matter how much the other person's love, it ain't the mother's love. Is that right? And she lays her hand on him, he will dry up. See, he's ready because that mother, there's a love about her that goes to the baby and that the baby's little spirit recognize that. And that's the love that no other love is. &gt;&gt; That's a law. That is a law. So if you have a baby who was right away was taken off of his mother, sent somewhere of an orphan. I've just preached those things in India. I had I had a many orphans sitting in front of me and I talked about my testimony how the touch of a father and I I'll give you the example. But when he's talk about that when when the mother lays his hand on the baby, that connection and and then the love of the mother would would would remove all the anxiety of the baby. It brings such calmness. The father has the same touch. And later on, and because I was not raised without a father, I was clueless. I didn't know the power that I had as a father. I didn't know what fatherhood was outside of keep everything straight, make sure you're strict, don't lose control. So everything about my fatherhood when I started, I started bad. It was about discipline. So when you love your children in just one channel like okay just being strict discipline well all the love you have for them will be channeled at being strict guess what you'll be too strict because you need other channel caring giving attention spending time with them and so all that love can be channeled in so many different ways so then you're less strict not to lose control but I was over overbearing make a long story short I don't have time to give my testimony this morning. But at the age of 40, I said to myself, if if if there's a time where I need to meet my father, it's I need to try to find him. My I'm Greek, so my father lived in Greece. So I tried I pulled some strings and contact my mother, some restaurant owner, because Greek, they own restaurants. That's what they do. So guess what? I like restaurants. I was almost born in one. So I was raised in one for sure. And um so ended up being able to contact my father, do my first trip to Greece. I'm sitting in a restaurant because he doesn't welcome me in his house because his wife is there and she doesn't know that he has another son. Says it's complicated. So I'm not welcome in my father's house, which is a great pain. Let me give you that testimony first, then I'll give you this other one. So when we're trying to make arrangement to go to Greece to meet my father first of all he says Steve he says first at first he says I'm going to welcome you in my house and I'm going to introduce you I got two brothers that doesn't know me they don't even know I exist I know they exist I have their pictures and when I found my father the way I was able to find him is on through Facebook I was try to search his name and my brother's name and it's all Greek and all that I spent a whole evening digging on Facebook trying to find this this this and I couldn't find it until I saw a picture of my father doing barbecue with my brother. And when I saw that picture, my world just turned me turned upside down. It was such a painful p that picture was asking such a difficult question. Why is he allowed to do barbecue with his father? That's my father. He's my brother. He's I'm not. And then a whirlwind. &gt;&gt; So much pain. And that's where I realize it's the first time I touch at the because when a father leaves, it's called an invisible pain. &gt;&gt; If your father's beat you, you have scars. I had a bad father. I suffered. It was painful. You can you can heal more that easily and bring it to God because you can identify the pain. Fatherless when the parents abandon you, it's difficult because it's an invisible thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; I thought all my life that on the side of my father I was all good until I saw that picture. And when I saw that picture, it was all like a volcano inside of me that erupted. And people that want it easy said, "Well, Steve, it's easy. You should have never looked at the picture." &gt;&gt; No, that picture was the beginning of the healing. &gt;&gt; A painful one because that volcano was inside of me, &gt;&gt; but I didn't know it. It was totally disconnected. But what that picture did is that it brought that deep deep pain, that heaviness that I was carrying all my life, not knowing it was that. And when I that picture transferred that huge burden, heaviness, depression, spirit from within deep inside of me and brought it to the surface and so it exploded. So then I'm able to reach him. We have phone calls and then he says, "Steve, you know what? You're going to come in my house. I'm going to introduce you to your brothers." And I'm so just his words are so like, "I'm going to finally be welcome at my father's house." I'm so happy. I hang up the phone to go see my wife. We're going to Greece. I'm going to my father's house. I'm be welcome in his family. And it's such it is such a healing. It is such is so good. And I don't know maybe a week later or two weeks later we we call back and he says you know Steve he says I've changed my mind he says Greece not and then Greece was in like huge financial problem riots in the street depression my my brothers lost their business lost a lot of money so they were not doing good he says your brothers are not doing good I don't want to bring this things and on upon them so we going to meet in a restaurant and when he said I hung up the phone and I was crushed &gt;&gt; because I was not welcome and then I opened my Bible. I sat on my in my office in my lazy boy and I opened the Bible. I don't know, it's a couple of years ago. I I don't remember if I cut through the Bible or I was there in my daily reading. I I forgot that detail. But that scripture, I'm going to read it to you just quickly here. But Jesus says, "Let your heart, let not your heart be troubled." &gt;&gt; Amen. Ye believe in God, believe also in me. &gt;&gt; In my father's house, &gt;&gt; are many mansions. &gt;&gt; If it were not, I would have told you, but I go to prepare a place for you. &gt;&gt; And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, they may be also. I I started crying. I went upstairs to see my wife. I said, "Wow, God, just step in." And it was the first time that God stepped in my life as a father. He had stepped in my life as a savior. He had stepped in my life as a lord. Uh and someone I want to serve. And I was a minister. I think I was already p yeah I was a pastor. I I knew him as lord. I knew him as a savior. I knew him at many things. But I didn't know him as a father. &gt;&gt; And that day was the first time that God stepped in and spoke to me as a father. And that was the beginning of the healing, not the total healing because there was a long journey for me. I had a I needed to learn a lot of things. But just to tell you that whatever void in your life you have, God wants to step in. &gt;&gt; You don't have to go across the world try to find your dad if if God allows it. Like in my story, it didn't work. It can work like we don't want to try to apply everything that every story is different. But in my story ended up that my dad never step in as a real dad and now he passed away right after COVID. But God did and it changed me and because I opened that kind of worm in my life. If first it was a was it was a volcano. If it if it was not for the grace of God that volcano would have lost me because it was beyond what I could bear. It brought a lot of confusion in my mind. It was really difficult. Well, the anchor of the Holy Ghost hold me and led me through the process of healing. And what is amazing is after that I lost this heaviness, this deep deep heaviness that every time every morning I would get up is gloomy. I love the Lord and it would confuse me like Lord why is it that I am so blessed in your presence? I'm so happy. I got full joy but then the next day I'm gloomy again. I've got I'm heavy again. And I was trying to find is it because of this? Is it because of that? Lord, I I want to be free from that until I opened that count of warm and I realized, okay, this is it. This is was so heavy that that that it was like exactly and he cares do you care. The prophet is talking about this young man. He says there's a there's he's talking about complexes and he says you all it's all wrapped around you. It's like when the prophet explained complexes, he has different way to explain it. It's a shadow dark cloud follow you. It's all wrapped. It's it's a darkness. It's something, but it's darkness. And that darkness is attached to a feeling. It's attached to a trauma. It's attached to something you believe. And God wants to deliver you from that. &gt;&gt; So, when I ended up going to Greece, I was sitting in a restaurant. I got over the fact that, okay, not quite over the fact, but I was in a restaurant. We're talking. And then, um, you order a coffee and my dad really liked those um, uh, what's it called? &gt;&gt; Yeah, espresso. But espresso on steroids. I mean he he talked to the waiter like he said okay. And he talking he talking Greek like and I'm listening you know he's like and so I see what do you want and I'm like for the first time I can do like my father right I did as I see my father I was like same like brickly would say like double it and then um then uh they bring that goodness I was drinking coffee I thought that thing was so strong my head would turn and then I told look my dad I says daddy I I says I thought I told you I'm not drinking alcohol cuz I thought there was he says there's no alcohol in that it was just caffeine anyway it was so strong and then he started explaining me things and then he does something that I never happened to me probably at a young age but I forgot but as he explained we're sitting at a table and then he put his arms his hands on my arms like this and when he did that when he touched me I felt like you know when when the world when the room turns like this. &gt;&gt; I felt like something was turning. It's like, you know, I was like, oo. It's like I felt like, you know, a bit of nausea. It's like when it touched me, now he's not a Christian, unconverted Greek man, but he's my father. &gt;&gt; Then when I real when he touched me, I was like, whoa. It something about my being. Science says that when a father touch his children, he's actually telling them you exist. You are material. &gt;&gt; I've experimented. I mean, it was so drastic because you usually we grow up and you know, we we don't know. There's not a before and after, &gt;&gt; but I was 40ome years old. And when he did it, it was so big because it's like boom, you're you exist. The the touch of a father. So that's where I got the revelation. So guess what? When I came back home, I had five kids. I became so touchy in a in a proper way. Get me, you know, but I became so, you know, you I realized I had I had I had power that not just my words, you know, I did I didn't know that it it meant something until it was done to me. &gt;&gt; Then I got the revelation. &gt;&gt; And to this day, you know, my girls are growing up, so there's a different way. But sometime also brothers, you're like, "Okay, now she's 16. She's in a puberty. So now I'm going to step off because it's all sacred and we make a big thing out of it." If you do that, you're going to confuse her. She's going to think there's something wrong about me. My father's not touching me anymore. &gt;&gt; There's a proper way to keep it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To keep it where I hug, I hug them. I hold them by the hands. I take their hands. doing it a proper way, but we still keep a connection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't, then they're gonna pray for it. And then there's going to be another young boy's going to step in. And when he going to touch his her harm, she's going to feel the touch of a man's life. I've been craving for that. And you're going to set her up. &gt;&gt; You're going to set her up &gt;&gt; for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the love we give our children is so is so protective. &gt;&gt; We protect them. &gt;&gt; I went ahead of myself again. Not a problem. Good. &gt;&gt; So the prophet says mother is first and she has a great responsibility of what that child will be will be based upon the way that mother starts that child on the path that he must travel. Mother has a responsibility from God to place that child on the right road. And I think that's why mother has a special touch. He's talking about a I know a boy in the city. I think his mother present now. He's almost my age. And I don't say this to hurt the mother because that she has enough hurts of all mothers. But the boy drinks and he drinks heavy. But when he gets real drunk, he will come home and jump into bed with his mother and put his arm around her. And he's got grandchildren. Why is he doing that? He's still looking for that connection. So he means he's stuck there but so he's so hurting he's he's drinking has a drinking problem because there's probably issues with his own father so he's stuck with needs his mother because something is lacking okay but just he's the prophet is using that example to show that the connection but there's something about just the pat of a mother that seems to take a different place than anything else can touch and that is in this life humanly speaking but sometime People are like, they want to be so spiritual. They don't look at those things because it's just, oh well, it's humanly speaking. This is not important. It's just psychology. It's a bunch of nonsense. We're the bride of Christ, brother. The rapture is tomorrow. Let's let's get over this and it's a big mistake. And with that approach, I grew up in a church that had that approach. You know, the rapture is tomorrow. Like we like what if we care? Like teaching kids to do a budget and having youth camp and build a next generation. We don't have to build the next generation. We're out of here. That's not what the prophet said to do. Prophet says, and it seems like the prophet did say, it's not like he didn't warn us. He warned us, plant your potatoes like you live a hundred years, but be ready as is it tomorrow. &gt;&gt; The prophet has asked us to chew gum and walk at the same time, but we choose to do one and not the other because it didn't look spiritual. But the prophet says, "Plant your potatoes mean plant for the next generation, &gt;&gt; but be ready as if it's tomorrow. And this is the balance approach. So then he's talking about Moses and he says, "If I could credit anything to his character, it was because he had a God sent mother." &gt;&gt; So it's not just election. It's not just reading the Bible, but there's he's talking about humanly spearing speaking the care, the touch, the connection. These are the recipes to to raise su a successful family. &gt;&gt; So what is it about? So it's the parenthood. So you're the one in the middle. Remember I'm talking to you this morning as if you were all you were when you were kids. This was God's will. a season of healthy parenthood where you're the kid in the middle and you got two parents and in that you're in kind of a you're you're in the presence of God. So your heart as you see I put a little heart there. Where is your heart? Your heart is inside the house. Your heart is in the home. Okay. So we are entering a something here. It's a season of innocence, spiritual headship by parents, strong emotional connection with no sexual thoughts or desire because it's a season of innocence. So when you have that connection and it's pure, that's why when you have one parents that try to use the connection to bring now there's kids here so we're going to be uh we're going to be uh parental guidance. Uh uh so when a father brings something else you know abuse and it it is such a confusion because it's not supposed to be like that. It's supposed to be a strong emotional connection with purity and then it creates something healthy in the child where he he grows up where he's safe and he knows what love is. So, it's a pure, innocent, and fulfilling relationship. So, that's a super important stage. If you didn't have that, as I'm telling my testimony, I've missed a lot of that. Later on, there's holes in your life that God wants to heal because it's going to be difficult to be a balanced father or to be a balanced mother if you're missing huge parts. But God, it's not like, well, sorry you're curse or sorry you didn't have it. I got good news for you. God is in tr God cares. &gt;&gt; Do you care? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God cared for me. &gt;&gt; He sent me and it's later on in life. I'm 40 years old and it was part of my middleage crisis at 40. You know, sometime they're like, "Oh, you know, 40 years old men quit their wife, marry a young one, buy a bicycle, and do everything they dream about." And we think that's only the people in the world to experience that. No, every man, it's a it's a something it's something physical. It's physiology. And it's also a a a So some men here maybe you pass that, you've experienced, you didn't know it was that, but let let me explain to you quickly what it is for for men because men goes through it. We know women menopause it's it's it's a huge challenge but men around 40 we realize when we reach that fatal four you know 29 30 is like it's rough but it's still a three it's not that bad you know I'm I'm still young but that four that four kills you because you know the next one is five and five is like you're you're an old man and and there's something subconscious inside of you and you feel like it's like watching a train all your life. All your life you say, "One day I'm going to do this. One day I'm going to do this. One day I'm going to do this." And when you reach the age 40, it's like you watch a train and this is the last wagon and if I don't jump in, I'll never do it. And so if if if if your marriage was was difficult for all those years and you're like, "Well, I need I want" and then at 40 you're like, "It's my last chance to start over again." or I wanted to ride a bike. I wanted to I don't know climb the Everest. Whatever you thought in your life you wanted to do. Sometimes these are crazy things but for me was like I need I want to meet my father and at 40 I was like I'm 40. He's probably around 70 up there. It's my last chance. And it was my last chance. And so I went for that. So we need we need to bring that season that middle age where we we have a craving for something we always wanted to do that seems to contradicts the commitment we have towards our kids and family. We need to bring this in front of God to overcome and to kind of see through that. not totally squash it, but to bring it in front of God and say, "Lord, help me to navigate through that deep feeling that I must do this or I must do that and bring it to God." Amen. So, we're touching many many things this morning. So we have such juvenile uh crime wave across the nation but I think it really started at home and I think the parents began to let go and if the child had been raised up in a good oldfashioned godly home I don't say it would be all over certainly not but it would certainly give that child that child the right kind of influence and I think many times at homes that children has been brought up wrong turn loose on the street and just live for themsel while the mother stays on Facebook uh barroom and the mother and so forth. And sometime we think the problem is the barroom. No, it's not the problem. What? Barroom is a problem. But the first problem is that mommy is some something else. &gt;&gt; So we see barroom is like, well, praise God. And like I'm a mother. I'm not in a barroom. Yeah, but you are so your mind is so about something else. Try to be noticed on social media. try to be noticed somewhere else instead of being noticed in your spiritual position. Well, I don't get this. I don't get fulfilled by raising those children. If you don't get fulfilled, you don't get this satisfaction, it's because you've been contaminated &gt;&gt; by this modern age &gt;&gt; that sends you the message that if you're a mother and motherhood has no value &gt;&gt; and you're nothing unless you have a degree. You're nothing unless you're on the workforce. You're nothing unless and and and and we don't realize how much the society brainwash us &gt;&gt; just every advertisement about any product man is washing dishes and the woman is in the workforce. They sell you a computer, it's a woman working on it. Even Microsoft, they advertise a computer. Okay, I show the examples of the church, but Microsoft want to sell you a computer. And so the they want to sell computer to men. So men is have the he has the computer on the counter while he's washing dishes. Advertisement, Microsoft advertisement. But then the woman, they want to sell computer to woman. She's sitting in the office while the man is at home. And so they put everything just to confuse everything. &gt;&gt; So it has an impact where humanly even though spiritually we know it's our position humanly we we don't feel value and we don't feel fulfillment in transferring that love and raising the next generation because the society says it's stupid. You're wasting your time. Send your kids to the government. I'll take care of it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they don't take care of this. So mom stays in the barroom, the father's on a golf course or whatever. He's somewhere else. He's he's busy. He has project. He wants to build five businesses. He wants to have his life that he always dreamed of. He has so many plans, but there nothing's related to his children. &gt;&gt; What do you think we reap then? Yeah. &gt;&gt; If we don't invest, our our kids heart will drift away. &gt;&gt; And we're going to we're going to enter into this right now. They don't love it and give it the affections to take it up. It's young. You've got to teach it to love and respect and to read the Bible. So there's a spiritual element to it because as you can see it's deeper than that care, love, affections, connection. Why? Because it's not good for men to human being to be alone. If there's not that connection, they will seek that connection somewhere else. &gt;&gt; And that's where we lose them on the c on the curve. We lose our wife on the curve. We lose our husband on the curve because we are so busy. We have so many other project. &gt;&gt; Marriage is the project. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Raising the family is the project. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; But but but we lose track of that because it's not valued. &gt;&gt; We we get married, we we have kids so we can go along with whatever we wanted to do. But then later on we realize what what's wrong with my family. We're so disconnected. They they want to be gone. They're like, "Oh, if I can get 18, get my apartment, if I can be out of here." &gt;&gt; Why? Because they are they are dying inside. They're looking for fellowship and they don't get it in the house. And it's not like because I don't know one thing or two about it. I got five children that four of them are now adults. So we've we've crossed on the other side of maintain and cultivate fellowship for me to go down to their level. What do they like to talk about? What what do they want to do? Go play volleyball with them, play music with them, being part of their life. Not always that if I they want to do something, they come they have to come on my ground. But what if I go on their ground? &gt;&gt; That's fellowship. Fellowship is not come on my side. It's let's join, &gt;&gt; let's meet. Most quote where the prophet talks about that prostitute woman in in in the time of Jesus. You will always relate. We when we think about prostitute and hill fame woman right away we're like yeah this is such vile it is it's so horrible even last night I said something wrong when I talk about this man who is abusing children in the church I call him a monster I want to pull that back even himself he if he ended up this way like a prostitute or a man does have bad behavior it's linked to something &gt;&gt; and not to justify it I mean We we we not we explaining and justify it's two things differently. &gt;&gt; Those spirits enter their life in a certain way. &gt;&gt; You know that the Holy Spirit is a comforter. &gt;&gt; For many years before I realized I was broken, I was always wondering why is the Bible says the Holy Spirit is a comforter. Like what's the need of comfort? Like what's until the Lord Lord showed me Steve you're broken. You need a comforter. Then then I realized, oh my goodness, &gt;&gt; he didn't use the word comforter, which is is comforting and healing and there's there's a lot with that word. &gt;&gt; But do you know that the evil spirits also are comforters? &gt;&gt; They're fake one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But spirits want to enter your life to comfort you. &gt;&gt; Go read the message. He cares. Do you care? The prophet says, "Women dress this way because they try to draw comfort out because they're well put, they're well done, they're they're nice, they're beautiful, and they're such in the distress." And so that's what evil spirit does. &gt;&gt; What is a drinking problem if you're not seeking for comfort? &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; You're seeking to be comforted. Drinking, gambling. Look at every sin. It's related to an evil spirit. But that evil spirit is using what ground inside of you? He's using your distress. He's using the hole inside of you. He's using a trauma to say, "I know you can't bear it. You cannot make it. You're so anxious. So invite me in your life. It's your drinking. Feel better." &gt;&gt; If you show your body, you're going to feel better. If you if a man's look at you, you're going to feel better. So all the the spirit world enters into human life selling themsel as a comforter. But the Jesus says, "I will sell you thee." There's only one comforter that when he comes in your life, he's not just a patch or a band-aid. He's a healer. He wants to go deep in your life and not just cover the hole, fill the hole. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, he's talking about the prostitute woman. The prophet says, "The lady was born in that nervous condition. Her father and mother died and she was a child baby raised up and tossed her everywhere and never had a proper love care that a baby has." You know, mother, I want to tell you something. I know got a little boy back there and he's really rankly spoiled, but I would rather have him that way. I believe it'll make him a better man out of him. If God lets him live, let him than to let him scream and cry and upset his little self. Listen, a few years ago, some normal witch doctor said, "Let that baby cry. Don't pick it up. Don't let grandma touch it." And you know what? They hatched out. You see what it is? A juvenile delinquency. A bunch of neurotic. God made a baby to be loved. So he's linking anxiety and neurotism and all that to the fact that they had at one point, you know, it was all bad, you know, don't don't breastfeed. We got we got the perfect formula. Don't take don't let med at one point medicine in the 70s and prophet links it back to the 50s was really bad. They they went against nature almost in everything. &gt;&gt; Now there's a return to nature. &gt;&gt; Breastfeeding and many things. They return, they realize that God's first idea is always the best one. &gt;&gt; God made a baby to be loved. Well, that's deep, deep theology. This a deep mystery. It's amazing because we got so caught up in the deep mysteries that the simple principle of life has become to us deep mysteries. We got to return. That's why you made a baby, a mother to love a baby. Uh That's why we're supposed to be this way. God made it that way. And anytime that you upset God's program, you must remember you're wrong. &gt;&gt; And you will be wrong as long as you're upsetting God's program. Follow God's program. Do it the way God said &gt;&gt; do it. &gt;&gt; I'm sure some of you are amazed this morning saying, "I didn't know there was so much quotes about those things. It's been overlooked. &gt;&gt; It's been overlooked. &gt;&gt; There's much. I'm just giving you a sample. &gt;&gt; Just a little sampling. What brought juvenile delinquency was parent delinquency. Parents failing to take care of the children. Remember a few years ago when my boy was born that been about I think he's about 19 now. I remember the doctor told my wife just let that kid squall. Let him cry. Ain't going to hurt him. And grandma comes along to pick him up. Take her keep her keep her hands off of him. Wow. It's great wisdom. We ought to be quibb broke at six months old. You know better than that. Sounds like talking to a witch doctor instead of a real doctor. And then you know what it hatch out? It hatch out a bunch of neurotic and bunch of gangster. God gave you that labor baby to love. I don't care how you spoil it. How about you spoil it? Love it anyhow. That's why I love it. If you don't love it now, it'll grow up in a cold home and indifferent. &gt;&gt; Now, we're reaching a key point here. &gt;&gt; Cold home and indifferent. Indifference is nobody cares. &gt;&gt; They seem to care, but they don't care. And when that happened, when if our homes were cold or or are cold and indifferent, then it'll seek love somewhere. That's right. &gt;&gt; Or something and it'll make out light for somewhere. Mother, take that baby and give it fellowship and love. Now, make it part of you, which it is &gt;&gt; and not like it and hugg it and kiss it and love it. Don't be too cold with the things of the world. God gave you that as a treasure. Raise it right. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a key. There's a lot of keys in that quote, but one one is make it part of you. Make it part of you as at at a young age your children is are looking for fellowship. They they crave for fellowship and fellowship for them is is they want to do what you're doing. &gt;&gt; But how many time you know your little girls show up in the kitchen and like mommy I want to help you cook. Like okay go play with your doll. Mommy's busy. Daddy's coming and mommy's busy buzzy and it's boiling and oh I know you want to cook honey. But when she comes and she says, "Mommy, I want to help you." She's saying, "I'm looking for fellowship." &gt;&gt; Why don't you pull a chair, give him a plastic knife, and whatever in &gt;&gt; she's going to cook with you. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "Make it part of you. Make it part of your life." And we don't realize that. I've done that when they were young. Later on, I realized, but it took me took me a while. What we don't realize is every time we tell them go away, go play, we reject them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We're breaking the fellowship. We send them back to the room and obviously they're going to make a a mind on themselves and they're going to play. They're going to seem to enjoy it. They're going to be quiet because they don't realize they've just been rejected. It's like a father is just building a shed and you got, you know, Tommy boy comes with his his plastic hammer and his his plastic saw, all his tool belt that you you gave him last Christmas was last birthday gift and he comes, "Daddy, I want to build a shed with you." Yeah. Yeah, it's good, Sunny Boy. Daddy's busy. He's got just Saturday to build it. Daddy's working, so go play with your friends. He's five. And the problem when we do that is that we have no vision. We have no vision because what we see is a 5-year-old boy. Period. &gt;&gt; And Samuel got caught in the same thing when it was time to anoint a king. Even David's father got caught up &gt;&gt; because he didn't invite David to the ceremony. &gt;&gt; Saul's Samuel's coming to anoint a new king and and they don't they don't even even bother to to ask David to come. What an insult. Imagine David's testimony is like, "Yeah, one day it was time to anoint a king. My dad didn't even invite me. &gt;&gt; I felt great that day." &gt;&gt; But then he expect all the sons, none of them. And then they say like, "Don't you have another son?" And then then uh what's his name? Jesse. Because in French it's another name. So Jesse's like, "Yeah, I got another one." But it's just a kids with, you know, with sheep like like don't bother. Samuel's like, "We're not going anywhere until you ask him to come." So they invite this young boy in. He's so young. Even Saul thought he's young. Even Goliath's laughing like everybody laughs like, "God, [Laughter] everybody laughed at David's age." But God, when man sees a boy, &gt;&gt; God saw a king. And that's why we need vision for our children. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; You we need to invest in them at an age you know in you know what the basic of investment is &gt;&gt; today. I'll take one company that's really high. Okay. Today well you can say well today tomorrow I'm going to buy I'm going to invest in Google stock. Yeah you can invest in Google stock but it's not huge of investment. It probably already reaches climax. investment is to find a treasure that's not up there yet, but you know the potential and you invest in the future &gt;&gt; and and and and maybe we have good brothers here that you're good in investment, but we are poor in HR, human resources. We are poor in in our own family where we don't invest. Well, they're just kids. They're just kids. They're just kids. And overnight realized like you turn around and now he's taller than you and you're like, "Oh, where you've been &gt;&gt; and men and men fathers were like that. We don't see the man until he becomes a man." &gt;&gt; But then when he becomes a man, he's 16 years old. Then we realize, oh well, we have got a man. We have a man here. &gt;&gt; But then we're frustrated because now that man, all he thinks about is to play. Right? &gt;&gt; You want to play with his friend. He wants to play with his video games. But what you don't remember is that when he was five, you told him to go play. &gt;&gt; Go play. Go play. Go with your friends. Go away. Go away. Go away. Go away. At one point, he resolved in his heart, okay, I'm not wanted here, so I'll go play and I'll go have fun. And it becomes his life. But who set him up on that journey? when he had the desire, when there was a like a when there was a seed of manhood springing in his in his 5-year-old heart, you could have invest in that and make him part of your life. That's what the that's why, you know, so there's such a treasury when the prophet says make it part of you. That's what it means. &gt;&gt; Make it part of your life. Invest. &gt;&gt; That's a huge key. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So many frustrated parents with their teenagers don't realize that they've missed the season. They've missed the curve. They missed the investment time. Well, brother, what do we do? Is it too late? No, it's not too late. It's never too late. But it comes first to own it, to say, "Okay, I missed this &gt;&gt; and I need to return and have a true meaningful conversation." I had those conversation with my my children almost all of them sitting in their bedroom just me and them to say daddy needs to talk to you. I fail. No daddy you're great. You're such a great father. You know that there's something wonderful with children. They are so forgiven. Hey, they're not programmed unless unless they get really bitter and really really hurt. But even a rebellious spirit, do you know that a rebellious spirit comes on a grieving teenager, a brokenhearted one and say, you know, sometime I don't know if you call it this in English, but in French they all we always talk teenagers year as a crisis. Oh yeah, it's I don't know how you say it in English, but in French we we call it the teenage cre crisis. Well, yeah, they're a teenager. It's a crisis. It's a crisis. A crisis is a volcano. But how do we build a volcano? We build volcano over years with pressure, pressure, pressure on resolve, unresolved, unresolved, unresolved, unresolved. Confusion, unresolved, rejection, blah blah. Boom. And then a spirits come and says, "I think you need your my help here. Your parents are clueless. They don't get it. You need to kind you need to punch holes in the walls a little bit. You need to you need to slap some doors here. You need to wake them up. You need to shake this. Everybody's sleeping and then start throwing and so that rebellious spirit will step in their life cuz he was able to sold something to them as a solution. Obviously a rebellious spirit is not the solution. &gt;&gt; But it looks like one when you're stuck. &gt;&gt; That's why we can avoid those things by having meaningful conversation. And so I had those conversation with my own children sometime in a group sometimes separately when I realized and my wife did the same when we realized okay oh my goodness we've missed it we've missed it how how we were so blind we went back and sat and have come no daddy you're so good you're such a great father I said thank you being nice it's okay I know you love me but in reality you have suffered you've suffered because it's a principle and me as a father was not allowed to let that go, whatever it was. And it says, I want to pray, first of all, I want to ask you forgiveness. And then I want to pray together that God would with would by his blood. You know the power of the blood, the Clorox, it dissolves sins. It dissolves, &gt;&gt; sorry, it dissolves parents' mistakes. &gt;&gt; We applied the token apply the blood. It's also that it's not just a throwing the TV out and like we we we we read quotes sometime and they are truth but but but they are deeper than &gt;&gt; than that and when we don't do that the prophet says notice that's what the matter we got away from the things of God you get away from nature then you're out of the will of God. So it's not just the great spiritual things that God is asking of us. It's also the little natural thing that some people call psychology wise bunch of family counseling stuff. Oh yeah, they invited that minister. He's talking about family you know like it was stupid and we get those reaction in our ranks. No wonder sometime what we reap and I don't know what kind of spirit got in our churches and maybe it's not here. Praise the Lord. But where I come from and I've I've I've I've many places I've I've encountered that attitude like it was something you know that's denomination are doing that like everything denomination do is trash. &gt;&gt; No. Where's that attitude come from? What did did the prophet had that attitude? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; He didn't have that. Well, we're the bride. We're above that. Said who? &gt;&gt; That's not the quotes. I'm reading this morning. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but most of the quotes you read are before before 63. So, it doesn't really apply. Well, he cares. Do you cares is after &gt;&gt; I know all the mind games going on. I've been raised in the message. &gt;&gt; I know where people goes and mind. Yeah. Well, this this opening la. And that's why sometime we're stuck. You want to claim great spiritual things but marriage are crumb crumbling and families are crumbling. You get away from nature and then you're out of the will of God. You opening the seals doesn't cancel that. &gt;&gt; I want you to notice Job think Job thinking of his children. He said pure adventure they got out and so he's he's telling just to save some time but he's telling about how he made sacrifice for children. He he didn't forget. He says, "Mother and father, if you quit spending money on children, learning tap dancing and things like that and some kind of how to be an actor and put more time pleading the blood of Jesus over them and showing them love and fellowship." &gt;&gt; Not just the blood, love and fellowship, we'd get along better. The child would too teach your child. So as you see every time you talk about children he's talking about care affections Bible applying the blood fellowship part of your life a warm home not a cold one a caring home not an indifferent one you see it &gt;&gt; it's clear as it can be but what happened when it's not there well when it's not there something progressively happened and it's because and I'm almost done but for those who are worried I was giving extra time this this morning because yesterday I was short. So um when it's not there when fellowship and connect strong connection is not in the home something happened and that happened on the subconscious level but the heart because it's not good for men to be alone. You seek fellowship and you don't have it. You seek fellowship you're rejected. Mommy's busy, father's busy, my sibling, whatever. Whatever happen, whatever is the recipe. If you're lonely, something's going to progressively happen without you noticing. But your heart is going to drift away from the house and you're going to still live in the house. &gt;&gt; And that can happen to a spouse, too. If the marriage is not really well connected, the spouse, the husband or the wife, the heart's going to drift away. And they're because you seek fellowship at all costs. Listen to me. You're seeking love, care, fellowship at all costs. If you don't have food, you're going to eat in a trash can. You don't have fellowship, if you don't have good, nourishing, spiritually wise, and good fellowship, you're going to seek it somewhere else, and you might end up in a spiritual trash can, too. And so when your heart leaves the home, you're not protected under parenthood anymore because that's God's protection. Parenthood, God, parents. And so that's a trap. And today with a modern age, you don't have to leave the house for your heart to be out there. You lock yourself in the room with the Wi-Fi, which is another problem. You give unlimited access to your children and you give them a device for them to to to commit spiritual suicide &gt;&gt; with a device connected where they everywhere doing all kind of things and you thought you gave them a gift at Christmas. you give them a loaded gun. &gt;&gt; And if you have a house where you're not connected, and that's also a problem. When a father feels guilty that he's not connected with family. And if a mother feels guilty, guess what we do? We overwhelm them sometime with gifts because we try to compensate. So we give them all kinds of stuff. All they ask, "Are you want the iPad I'm going to give you?" Or, "You want a computer?" And then we we give them all kinds of devices with the Wi-Fi on. And guess what happened? Their heart drifts even further away while they're s while they're in the room. You think they're in the house. They are everywhere getting all sort of connection everywhere. And that is where you get so much problem because they're seeking an emotional connection through so many we got a little font problem here but uh so texting chat social media Romans bad friends influence they're seeking remember the quote the prophet says if they're if you are raised in a cold home and indifferent then they'll seek love somewhere or something &gt;&gt; and they're going to fed they're going to feel emotionally ly fed by the wrong thing. But it's a law. It is not good for men to be a human being to be alone. So they're going to fill that void at all cost. Well, the problem at that point is they're not under godly influence anymore. They under even though they still in your house, they are and they're slowly going to start hearing from your children, "Oh, I can't wait to be out of here." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And when they start saying that, it's it's a huge red alert because their their body is still in the house, but they have no interest, no desire. They want to be out because they're looking to be loved and they found it somewhere else. And that's exactly what the prophet warned us. And he says, "Be careful because they'll seek love somewhere else." And that's where you get in trouble because then you get all kinds of problem. The lust, the flirt, the fantasy, girlfriend, boyfriend, pornography, fantasy, all that. It's all comforting spirits. Not that texting is bad, but if you use it to replace the genuine love, &gt;&gt; texting is not a connection. &gt;&gt; It's amazing when I see young people, they courtship through text. They fall in love with a green or blue bubble. They have no clue or they try to resolve their courtship and they break up. They break up by texting. They are so crippled. They're so emotionally crippled that they cannot even talk to someone because they've not been trained. And we can laugh at the other generation because they are emotionally socially crippled. But who should have teach fellowship in the house? Who should have done outside of sitting in living room says well I sit my kids in the living room. We read the Bible. Yeah, that's good. But it can be done in such a disconnected way. Read the Bible, close the Bible, everybody runs in their room. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry to tell you, but you didn't have you didn't make a lot of progress. Oh yeah, daddy's always we have to sit and listen to his Bible reading and so you're gonna do it. Are you done? &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Where I was? Okay, guys. I'm sorry where we were. Okay. Yeah. Now, let's kill more dudes. Let's kill more dudes. &gt;&gt; What if we close the Bible and say, "Okay, how many is happy to living in this house?" I'm not sure you want to ask that question. That'd be taking the bull by a horn. But you can put, as I said, the devil prosper in taboos. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you're afraid to talk about a certain topic, &gt;&gt; you can be sure because you're afraid, you can be sure that the devil is already sitting in that topic. &gt;&gt; And that's why you're afraid. You're afraid to cast that demon out of your house because it going to cost you something. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; I had to bring up tough subject where I would that bringing that topic would expose me as a poor father. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; that's what we call husband love your wife the way Christ laid his life. God left his throne. Sometime we want to sit on a throne of I'm the father. I'm the head of this house. But we got to step out of that throne and give our life. God didn't have to plead guilty to anything. But us, we have to step out of our big throne. Well, I'm a father. I'm this. I need respect. And so I've put topic, me and my wife put difficult topics on the table where we knew we would get the truth, but it brought healing in our home. &gt;&gt; Amen. And by God's grace, if I feel there's a taboo, there's something I see, you know, I I'll give you cues. Okay, teenager, I'm sorry. I'm going to I'm going to spill the beans. You know, this this famous roll of the eyes. You know, &gt;&gt; you're saying something and then your teen's like, &gt;&gt; you know, that that we got people laughing here. I'm not looking. &gt;&gt; But it means something is going on. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. &gt;&gt; Then you can say, well, you roll your eyes. That's rebellious. That's not respectful. When you say that, you squat. You you are you are shutting their mouth. &gt;&gt; What you can do is later tonight that that night says, "Okay, let's all sit in the living room." It says, "Okay, hey folks." Or whatever you want to call them, group, gang, family, whatever. I realized today I said something and one of you just roll the eyes and I want to know you're you're trying to say something. I annoy you. I annoy you. So I want to know what did I do over the years to reach this because I don't think this going to be healthy for a relationship and I don't want to annoy you. I tell my kids often my worst nightmare is me as a father to annoy my teenagers and I'm annoying fathers. You know what you are annoying. You are Bible says father don't irritate. Is it irritate? Because I'm French. What's the word? &gt;&gt; Provoke. &gt;&gt; Provoke. Okay. In French we say irritate. &gt;&gt; Don't provoke. So father we have a tendency we call dad's joke. We are so boring. Okay. We get we get on their nerves. And it's often time I tell my I tell my I call them my kids. Now they're adults. through the years I told him I says my wor nightmare nightmare he says if I annoy you so much that you just want to be out of here so I said I want to have fellowship with you in a way that I'm respecting you you're we and we have a common respect it's really hard to ask respect you know something that we cannot demand respect &gt;&gt; that's true &gt;&gt; it's something that the children the the Bible God is asking you to honor and respect God is asking you so you have to do it but me my role as a father is to gain respect If I'm respectful, they'll respect me. &gt;&gt; If I'm disrespectful, they'll have to be respectful, but I'm going to annoy them in a way that they just don't want to be in my presence anymore. And then we don't have fellowship. And if we don't have fellowship, we're not connected. And if we're not connected, that means that when they go to the park, I got beautiful girls. So if a guy comes to the park and says, "Hey, beauty. Has someone ever told you that you're you're beautiful?" and that your dad never said any word, any affirming word. And and my daughter are clueless, that they're beautiful, they're they're loving, and they're this and they're that. And that a boy, like the prophet called a slicker, comes around. &gt;&gt; The slicker comes with a hot rod, and he says, "Hey, beauty, you want to spend a great night. You're so beautiful. There's somebody." And then I joke around because I I I keep saying to my girls, I have this connection with them how much I love them and how much I'm proud of them and and and and whatever. And so I joke and when I preach on that my girls listening to that so they they think it's funny but I said I think my girls would tell that slicker. Yeah. My dad tells me that every &gt;&gt; day. &gt;&gt; What else you have to tell me I don't know already. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's that connection. So love in the home is so protective. So filling the void everything can fill the void. In the modern age, you know, movies, music, gaming, sports, whatever. And and some of these things, not everything is bad there. But when we use those things to fill the void, we going to overdo it. &gt;&gt; It's going to become something that we are a slave of because we use it to survive. We can do sports just for fun when when we have a strong connection at home or we can do it to be praised by so many people because it's the only place that I be I'm I'm being appreciated and I do it to survive. All right, we're closing. So if we wrap it up so at the end so that's why when when we think that well overnight you I don't know my kids my my teenager run away it's it suddenly it happened so if we go back to this famous word suddenly suddenly slams door suddenly he run away suddenly doesn't want to talk to me it didn't happen suddenly it's a buildup &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; it's a buildup and we don't know we're building something and redemption comes from the father redemption for the kids comes from the father and the mother. It's our role to try to reestablish community. It will come at a price. I've I've I've experienced that. It will come at a price. Who needs to pay the price? Parents needs to pay the price. Who paid the price for us? Humanity was bankrupt. Who came down? &gt;&gt; A blameless one came down. He paid the price. That's the love God is asking us to have in the book of Ephesians. Husband, love your wife as Christ loved the church that he gave his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, guess what happened once their heart is out? And at one point, what's going to happen is that the body will follow. And that's where some girls get married way too early and with the wrong guy because they wanted to be out there. So, the wrong guy becomes the the slicker becomes the savior. I talked to fathers or even a husband as wife, whatever. But it's like I don't know. Father's super frustrated because this young girl loves this guy. And I don't know what she sees in him. He's he's doesn't have a job. He He smells bad. He's he's stupid. And and and she loves him. And I'm like, before she loved him, you were supposed to be his first love. How was he able to? If you if you think if you if you look at this guy, you despise him so much, but he replaces you. She used him to replace you. So something has happened. So those things are important and what we don't realize is that once we get married we can repeat those pattern. When you were young when you were a teenager and things were doing bad at home instead of facing it as a teenager and and try to reestablish fellowship you ran away in this this this this that. If at a young age you're a teenager and you were struggling with your mother struggling and you ran into pornography, guess what you're going to do when you're going to get married and then you have a strong problem of of connection at your home? You're going to run into the same comfort &gt;&gt; because you train yourself when there's a when when there's a problem with someone, I run to discomfort. &gt;&gt; But when I'm going to get married, it's going to be I got to oh, I can't wait to get married. It's going to be all solved. That's what I do when when I prepare when I prepare young premarital advice counsel when I sit with young people we go over these things and I'm asking question how do how do you solve problem at home how what's your relationship with your father talk to me about your father talk to me about your mother oh my mother this my father this and then I listening and listening and listening and I'm like okay I see now that you've not find the key to solve dispute and to find a way to establish connection. How do you think you're going to be able to do it once you get married? Because it's going to get tough. I understand now everything is rosecolored glasses. Everything looks great and oh, it's going to be different. Our story will be different. Yeah. Yeah. Wait. You're going to run away the same way that you ran away. You hit it. It's amazing. You were young. Tension house. You jump in the car. You ran off. You're married. tension in the car, tension in the house, run in the car, run away. Do the exact same thing. &gt;&gt; I was doing the same thing. I was raised in restaurants all the time. Guess what? When when there was tension in the house and I was not feeling good, guess where I was going? I was getting up in the morning, get in my car, go have breakfast in my at restaurant on my own. And my wife was confused like, why why is he doing that? Why is he leaving? Even my my even my kids like why? I'm the father. They're together. But but but but for me I didn't feel part of like at first when they were really young I didn't feel part of the family. So when there was tension I was off I was getting and I I was getting comfort of eating on my own in a restaurant because that was my childhood. So when gets things to get tough in the house we run to we we resort we we uh what's the word? &gt;&gt; Resort to our childhood plan because that's the only thing that we know that make us feel good. That's why we need to resolve those things. I know it's heavy. I know it's a lot this morning but but but these are principles. Okay, we try to find we're closing here. So there's a lot what we need to finish. So I just explained this. So the prophet is giving here. He says he says man so if man he was made to want to be com converted comforted. So then if he doesn't accept God's way, then he'll take it away for himself and he'll try to substitute something something to take the place of that Holy Spirit. Oh, I want you to listen to it. A man or woman that will not accept the Holy Spirit, the comforter will try to comfort themselves with some violent substitute that Satan will present to them. Satan just got plenty of substitute. But why do we have to have substitute when the Pentecost skies are full of the real? Why would I eat from a garbage can when a clean stables setting full of choice food? There would be something mentally wrong with me if I did that. Now, what a pity if it is to see that men will try to substitute something to take that place. Sometimes he'll try to ease his conscience by going out and etc, etc. So, you see the principle. There's a comforter, but then there's violent substitutes. There's a real connection you can have with your wife, which is healthy intimacy. Then there's pornography, which is a violent substitute. Pornography is violence. &gt;&gt; It's violence. Um, you can you can have healthy activities with people, but you can go play uh video games with full of violence. And so that quote is amazing because Satan's offers is substitute, violent substitute. You enter into a bad relationship with the wrong boy, it's going to be violent. Your heart's going to be crushed. It's a violent substitute. You don't get out of those fake substitute, not broken and bruised. &gt;&gt; It's violent substitute. &gt;&gt; The only the only real thing is the Holy Ghost. He's a healer. It brings healing oil. &gt;&gt; But when we replace the genuine love, the genuine connection and replace with something else, we're going to get bruised. We're going to get broken. We're going to get hurt. So God, those kind of teaching this morning is not to bash people to make them feel bad. It's it's it's so it's it's it's bring protection because God God wants to stop the carnage. God wants to stop the the the the the violence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And some of way some of you and I'm closing and musicians can come, but maybe some of you this morning feels a bit overwhelmed and I mean I'm with you. I've I've I've experienced that many times. Feel overwhelmed that says, "Okay, my lord, I'm bankrupt. I'm I'm past redemption. Don't let Satan step in this morning and sell you that it's a lie. &gt;&gt; And let me give you a word of hope and conf and and tonight we're going to we're going to we're going to probably Lord willing I feel that we're going to do the Rebecca story today. We're going to like do an in-depth analysis you and and you're going to see what the step the prophet took to get out of that rut. He was he was stuck with Rebecca slamming door and wanted to be out of the house with friends playing music, &gt;&gt; rock and roll. He was he was stuck. She's 18. It it was done by then. It was done. The prophet knew it ends off. We're done. But then he took few steps. So we're going to study that together. I think I think you're going to enjoy it to give you hope. He took one step after the other. And it was stuff. His wife was like, "Honey, it's my daughter." Prophet was like, "It's my my daughter. My daughter, too. But let me explain you one one also one rule that I saw in in I've helped I've worked with a lot of families. I've worked with a lot of couples. Restoration is always a miracle in a sense that even if you had 10 years of tough marriage disconnected it doesn't take it does it never takes 10 years to fix it. It's never a ratio for one to one. &gt;&gt; Redemption and healing of God is so powerful. Love is so more effective than destruction. &gt;&gt; Love is so much powerful than all the negligence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I cannot give you a ratio, but it's amazing. And I've saw I saw a couple on on on rampage and and like on destroying mode, destruction mode for 10 years, 15 years within couple of months of applying the right principle with the forgiveness of the Lord be able to rapidly rapidly covering, fixing, bringing back within couple. And so the ratio is amazing. But when we invite God to restore, thing can go fast. But but I'm not selling you something easy either. &gt;&gt; You got to be patient. You don't try what I'm saying this morning. You have to become it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, brother Sam, I'm ready to try your recipe first. It's not a recipe and it's not something you try. &gt;&gt; You got to have it within yourself. You need Christ inside of you. It's not something you try. It's not something you do. It's something that you become. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When God stepped down on on earth, he didn't try. I'm going to try redemption. I'm going to try die on the cross. That's who he was. &gt;&gt; And sometime we get stuck in religion where we do things. We try to do things. The gospel is not doing things. It's becoming somebody. &gt;&gt; I'm not doing this. This who I am. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we felt your presence this morning and I know Lord somehow it is it it is also corrective. But I pray Lord this morning that people felt your love and felt mine too and the caring. And I don't know Lord anything about this church or the families. Almost everyone here I never met before. [Music] But I know Lord human nature is human nature. And there's something also with our ranks in the message that I've seen everywhere around the world. There's a huge misunderstanding. And I've seen Lord a lot of family neglect around the world because we took things for granted. Somehow we misunderstood something and we thought that if we go about the deep spiritual things, the simple things would take care of itself. And there's a huge price that's been paid by a whole generation. But I see something turning right now around the world. People start to think and listen and don't want to make the same mistake again. And Lord, I pray Lord, not knowing anyone here, but I pray to in Lord that you inspired Men of God, women of God, teenagers. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Open their hearts, Lord, so we receive your love and knowing that with you everything is possible. Nobody's beyond redemption. We need to stop saying those things about I think you crossed the line and crossed the line. It's something that's been said for so many years. We don't know who crossed the line. We should quit talking about lines like we're trying to get rid of people, Lord. We should throw a love line instead and show redemption and and prepare the if if some has left. If if we have runaway teenagers in this church or runaway husband or runaway whatever situation, Lord, way may we make the ditch smaller. May we throw a lifeline somewhere, Lord. A love line, an apology of just owning where we stop pointing fingers and just own what what's on our side and say, "I didn't help. I'm sorry. I made things worse." And it's only when we change that we give hope to those people around us. Says, "I see it's not just words, but it means that he's a different person." Grant us, Lord. Grant us, Lord. You've changed me so much. Even my daughter lately told me, she said, "Daddy, you've changed so much. It gives me hope that God can change me, too." She said, "You've set such an example that nothing in your life is impossible that cannot be changed." You showed us. And she said, "It gave me hope that God can change some of the things in me also." The greatest example we can give is when God change us. &gt;&gt; It's not what we say, but it's what we do. And it's what we do, not expecting a result like we're trying it. We do it because this is who we are. Inspire us. I pray Lord tonight, this morning in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Grace. Let's stand up. God's grace. Grace that will pardon and cleanse with it. Grace, grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all of our sin. [Music] proving Lord grace that exceeds our sins not our guil outp [Music] was pure you. Oh grace, grace, &gt;&gt; God's grace, grace that will pardon and cleanse we grace.

It take me forever. I said, "You know, friends, I got a bucket list." Again, they're not things, they're people. My bucket list, my grandbabies, the salvation of my grandkids, my children, my wife.
