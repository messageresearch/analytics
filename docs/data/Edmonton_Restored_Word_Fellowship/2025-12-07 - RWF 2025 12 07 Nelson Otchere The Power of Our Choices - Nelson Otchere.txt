Summary of "The Power of Our Choices" — Sermon preached by Brother Nelson Otchere from Ghana.

In this sermon, Brother Nelson teaches that every believer lives daily with the sacred responsibility of making choices—choices that shape their spiritual direction and eternal destiny. Drawing first from Joshua 24:15, he reminds the congregation that Joshua faced the people with a simple but life-altering challenge: “Choose you this day whom ye will serve.” Likewise, Deuteronomy 30:19 declares that God has placed before humanity “life and death, blessing and cursing,” urging us to deliberately choose life. Brother Nelson emphasizes that attending church, forgiving others, resisting negativity, and walking faithfully are all choices rooted in the heart and mind. He stresses that believers came to church not to see one another, but to meet God, who promised His presence wherever two or three are gathered.

Brother Nelson then explains that human life is influenced by two spiritual powers—God’s Spirit and the enemy—and every decision is shaped by one or the other. From Genesis 2:17, he reminds listeners that Adam and Eve faced two trees, representing life and death, obedience and disobedience. Quoting Brother Branham, he teaches that the Tree of Life symbolizes Christ and the tree of knowledge represents Satan, showing that choice has always been central to spiritual survival.

He further cites Brother Branham’s teaching that there are only two classes of people in the last days—those sealed by the Holy Spirit and those who reject it and bear the mark of apostasy. Brother Nelson pleads with the congregation not to hide behind religion or church membership but to genuinely choose God with sincerity, humility, and Christlike character.

A major portion of the sermon focuses on inner transformation, forgiveness, and guarding the mind. Brother Nelson use...

Your sons are gathered. Your sons and daughters are gathered before your presence this morning. Father Lord Jesus. The reason why we are gathered this morning is for a purpose. and the purpose is what you know and I pray the father may your will be done upon our lives. May we put our will aside and your will take total absolute control. Thank you for the pastor of the church. Thank you for the church officers. Thank you for the instrumentalist. And thank you for each and every member in this house this hour. &gt;&gt; And if there be that the service is also being streamed, we also commit all those watching via live streaming.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know there's one thing I always love the house of the Lord. There's liberty. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've never ever seen any place that is so sweet and so comfortable than the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the house of the Lord is the only place where you come in, you put your trouble there, you leave there very empty. &gt;&gt; You know out there there's so much of a burden. Our daily life is filled with burdens and trials. Our lives the step you even take are very heavy. Your minds are filled with worry. You're filled with a lot of things. thinking of what you eat in the morning, thinking of what the children is going to wear, thinking of what you're going to wear, thinking of how you're going to get to work, thinking of the lovely weather, thinking of everything. But when you come to the house of the Lord, you drop everything &gt;&gt; at the feet of the mighty God and he will take care of the rest. &gt;&gt; And I always love being in the house of the Lord. That's why David said, "I was glad when they said unto me, let us go to the house of the Lord." &gt;&gt; He didn't say that for fun. He said for a purpose. &gt;&gt; And I want you to know that you being here is not by an accident. It's not by chance. It's by the will and the grace of the mighty God. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Once again, as pastor said, my name is Nelson. That's my full name. Here is my wonderful brother and friend. We grew all the way from Nigeria so young through Sunday school God has brought us this far and we thank God for the life God has given to us and I also want to really appreciate him for the good work he's doing when I was coming over I said don't worry I'll talk to the will of the Lord be done and this morning I am here with my precious brother Daniel as well and I want to pastor for giving us the privilege to stand before you and share what we have. You know it's very difficult for a pastor to give his to you. You know the reason why there are a lot of falsehoods going around. So of that you want to put that barricade around the pulpit and be very careful for the kind of spirit that doesn't come in and destroy the church or dabilize the church. And I want to thank the pastor to bless you for giving us this opportunity and I pray that the almighty God would bless each and every one of us this morning. It shouldn't be my words and it's not my words because I have nothing to give. I can't even put down together the ABCs. Almighty God knows how to put down everything in our lives. So without much ado, why don't you stand to your feet and stand with me to the book of Joshua chapter 24. We are reading from two places from the scripture this morning. I'm trusting almighty God to be brief. I don't know how many gi God give to us will be a blessing to each and every of you. We're going to read from the 15th verse of the 24th chapter of the book of Joshua. Joshua chapter 24 and verse 15. I wouldn't rush. I'll take it slowly so that we all can be part of it. I read and it says, "And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom you serve, whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But as for me, &gt;&gt; will you say the same thing? &gt;&gt; Say that. As for me, &gt;&gt; for me &gt;&gt; and my house &gt;&gt; and my house, &gt;&gt; we will serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Is that your prayer this morning? &gt;&gt; Is that your prayer this morning? &gt;&gt; Let's say that said, but as for me, &gt;&gt; as for me, &gt;&gt; just say it after me. But as for me, &gt;&gt; But as for me, &gt;&gt; and my household, &gt;&gt; and my household, &gt;&gt; we will serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; We will serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's no other God we can serve. &gt;&gt; There's no other God. &gt;&gt; Turn with me again to the book of Deuteronomy chapter 30. Deuteronomy 30 and we're reading the 19th verse. Deuteronomy 30 and verse 19. I call heaven and earth to recall this day against you that I have set before you life and death. I said I'm taking very seriously. Just pay attention please. I have called heaven and earth to record this day against each and every one of us in here this morning that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing. Therefore, choose life. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible is saying. Therefore, choose life that both thou and thy seed, I'm changing that seed to the house, just as we read in the book of Joshua, that both you and your household may do what? May the Lord add his rich blessings to the words. Amen. Rich bless you this morning. As I said, I'm trusting Almighty God to help us. We just want to take for a thought the power of our choices. The power of our choices. The prophet makes us know that we are all free moral agency on this earth. We have the right to make choices. And before I go on, I want to say this. Everything that is related to our life, every question that you have got, everything that is troubling you, God has given us the answers in the scriptures as well as the end time message. And that is why the prophet came in to set in order anything that would bring doubt, anything that will be discrepancies. Anything that will be confusion no brothers as long as you get a revelation of God's word you at peace. If you want to find fault in the word of God you will find it. If you want to find negativity in the word of God you will surely find it. But look in everything you need to do just put it before God and he God his spirit will direct you to its perfection. &gt;&gt; So this morning it's not my words. We have everything pertaining to the thought we're going to share and we're going to read it as we move ahead. And now let's move back. The power of our choices. This morning you had a choice to be in the house of God. You also had you also had a choice to be in your house and sleep and even make an excuse that the weather is so cold [laughter] and put on the heater and sleep. &gt;&gt; But he said, "I will go to the house of the Lord." Why did you come to the house of the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Brothers, you didn't come here so that you can see me. You didn't come here to see the pastor. You didn't come here to see your brother or your sister. You came here to meet the Almighty God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And look, the almighty God is already here. For he said in his word, that for where two or three are gathered, &gt;&gt; I am in their midst. &gt;&gt; So he God is already here. So you are here to meet him &gt;&gt; so IF THERE'S ANYTHING TROUBLING YOU, channel everything to his feet &gt;&gt; and he will surely answer it and do it according to his which is in glory. There are two sources of power. We have the power of God and we have the power of the enemy. Now the power of Gods down to the book of Genesis. Turn with me to the book of Genesis chapter 2. Let's read verse 17. [snorts] Genesis chapter 2 and verse 17. And what does it say? Genesis 2 and verse 17. It says, "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. So which means from the scriptures we just read, there were two trees in the garden of Eden. And the two trees are this. There is one, the tree of life, and there's another one, the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Let's read something here from the prophet. It says in the garden of Aan verse two trees one was knowledge and one was faith. One was life one was death of knowledge. Other was life by faith. And as long as they eat by faith of this tree they lived. But when he got on this tree, he died. It says we start with the fact that there are two trees in the midst of the garden. The tree of life was Jesus. The other tree is definitely Satan because of what came forth of the tree. Because of what came forth of the fruit of the tree, this what the prophet is saying here, we have two choices to make. And that's what happened in the garden of Eden. And the book of Romans chapter 6 and verse 23 says, "For the wages of sin is death." Let me see if I can see. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal through Jesus Christ our Lord. You can put it down. That's the book of Romans chapter 6 and verse 23. Now in the garden of heaven, God's children have the choice to make. And that is where we are this morning. We are I want to turn this into the garden of heaven. We have a choice to make this morning. What is your choice? I don't know the kind of choice you want to make. But he that believeth in him has something. &gt;&gt; And in the book of Mark 16:6, it says that he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. &gt;&gt; But he that believeth not shall be what? Damned. I'm not the one saying it. is the scriptures from the book of Joseph. I said, "Choose you this day." There was a very nice, lovely young man in the Bible, the rich young ruler. &gt;&gt; He saw the master and he realized within himself that there was something missing on the inside of him. Church, as you're sitting down here, if there's something missing in you, you know it. &gt;&gt; But don't let time leave or don't let him go and sit down and said I will do it today or I'll do it tomorrow. Time might not be there for you. Make your choice and make your decision today. &gt;&gt; MAKE YOUR STEP THIS VERY HOUR. Where am I going to? This rich young realized that there was something missing in him. He had everything. All the riches on earth, he had it. And when he saw the master, he realized that there was something. He went over to him. He said, "Master, what may I do that I may inherit what? Eternal life." Listen. He said, "Go over. Do you know whatsoever is in the scriptures? You know the ten commandments. Look at what he said." He said, "I have done all those things from what?" Church, I want to throw this challenge to you, pastor. Please get the key doors ready. If anybody answers us the same thing, we'll close the service and go home. Who amongst us can say the same thing as that rich young ruler? Who service continues? Nobody. HE SAID I HAVE [screaming] DONE EVERYTHING FOR MY YOUTH. But you and I, we are we are culprits of it. BUT HE THAT HAS DONE ALL THIS STILL LACK SOMETHING. HOW MUCH MORE YOU AND I THAT DO THIS MISTAKE EVERY DAY OF OUR life &gt;&gt; that we act as if we are so righteous. He said, "Master, I have done all this, all the commandments, thou shall not steal. I have done it. Thou shall not lie. Oh, I've never lied in my life. Thou [snorts] have done this. I have done all everything." The master said, "But you lack one thing." He said, "Yes, that's why I've come before you, church. You and I have a choice to make this morning or this afternoon. I am I am a sinner saved by grace." Amen. &gt;&gt; You are a sinner saved by grace. &gt;&gt; His grace is why HE CAME DOWN ON EARTH HERE TO SHED HIS BLOOD FOR YOU AND I. &gt;&gt; HOW MUCH MORE WOULD YOU SAY, LORD, HAVE MERCY ON ME? &gt;&gt; Let me read this. There are two influences of power on earth. [snorts] And I want to read from the message atonement. The prophet said, "Just below the regions of mortal beings lay the realms of demon power. Just above that lays the soul of the unjust. Below it lays the very domain of Satan which is hell. Then [snorts] just above us lays the Holy Spirit. Then under that under the altar lays the souls of the just man. Then the next is God himself. One going downward, one going upwards. Two choices. One going where? Downwards and one going upwards. The two spirits are here on earth influencing the people of this earth. So which means that we have two spirits influencing us. Every decision we make under two influences. That's why Joshua said, "Choose you this day &gt;&gt; whom you will serve." church, who do you want to serve today? Don't tell me that I've been a church member for the past 10 years. That doesn't count. You know, most of times we are the people that are even the worst enemies and worst corporates. We come to church and use that as a covering. Get that out. Let the almighty God be the covering of your life. &gt;&gt; Don't use church or don't use religion as a covering. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't take us anywhere. two spirits, one downwards, one upwards, one above us, one below us. Now, these two spirits, he says there's only going to be two classes of people in the last day. Both of them is going to wear a mark. The mark of God is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you love that church? &gt;&gt; The mark of God is the Holy Spirit. Which means if you have the spirit of God in you, &gt;&gt; he says that you are sealed until the day of what? Redemption. &gt;&gt; I love this. &gt;&gt; Without a shadow of doubt. And then all that was not sealed by the Holy Spirit was all those that were not sealed by the Holy Spirit will take the mark of the beasts. And the mark of the beast is the mark minute please is the mark of apostasy which is rejecting the Holy Spirit. church as we getting it right now here it says that there are two what spirits but I want to be associated with the spirit of the almighty God &gt;&gt; that is why I'm here I'm not here for any kind of sake I'm not here to please anybody look church if you come to church and you want to please somebody then you're making a mistake if you're living your life to please somebody you're making a mistake. If you're living your life to please the pastor, you're making a mistake. The pastor is not the one you're you're looking up to. The only person that you have the right to look up to is the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Look at him and leave. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's one time we're having a discussion and I come to realize that whatsoever that we tend to do, whatsoever that we tend to say, it should be seived by the word of God. Our life should be seed by the word of God. Our speeches should be seived by the word of God. Our relation to our brothers and sisters should be seed by the word of God. Even our work ethics should be saved by the word of God. Why? Because we are not like them. We are different. &gt;&gt; It says what is it? The mind is the womb for the spirit to take in or let out. That was his knowledge. His mind the womb of his mind. the battlegrounds where the battle is fought in the mind. Now look at this. We are being told of how to make our decisions. You and I have got to make a decision. And that decision that we need to make starts from somewhere. It starts from the mind. And this has been one thing that is so key to our life. The mind of Christ in you makes you live a Christlike life. But the mind of the enemy makes you live a different life altogether. But my prayer this morning is that may our life, our minds be renewed in line with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is why you are here in the book of Romans. It says that Romans 8 and verse 7 says because the cannon mind is enmity against God. That's what it says. For it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. In each of us, I want to say this. In each of us, there are two dogs. &gt;&gt; In each of us, there are two dogs. &gt;&gt; I don't know which dog leads you this morning, but let me just read something. These two dogs, there is one which is good and there's one which is evil. The one which is good, it is of joy, peace. These are the attributes of the of the dog that is good. It is of joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness. Look, you can't tell me that, oh, I don't have one of this, but I'm still of God. The Godhead dwelleth fully in the bride of Christ. There is not a single one omitted from it. So if you tell me that oh I love my brother I do this I do this but I don't have the spirit of humility then I'll question what kind of life it is or what kind of spirit is in you because the life of God gives this lovely and sweet attributes. Now amongst we brethren one of the simplest virtue that we even find so difficult to give out is the spirit of forgiveness. &gt;&gt; BRETHREN, &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE DOING? AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD FORGAVE THE &gt;&gt; WORER. &gt;&gt; And you are TELLING ME THAT GOD IS YOUR father and this same God is in you &gt;&gt; that you're able to hate your brother. &gt;&gt; God be merciful unto us. &gt;&gt; Abraham said, "If you have the love of Christ in you, you would love your worst enemy. He didn't say your enemy. He said your what? &gt;&gt; So worse enemy. But you come and tell me, "Oh, that's my brother." But you hate the brother. The brother has offended you. Forgive the brother is an issue. Your wife has offended you. Forgive your wife is a problem. Your husband has offended you. Forgive your husband is an issue. Your pastor has made a mistake. Look, let me tell you, every one of us in here are capable of making mistakes. &gt;&gt; We are not immune to mistakes. &gt;&gt; We would make them. &gt;&gt; We will continue to make them. But the point is this. When you realize that you've made A MISTAKE, GO BACK AND MAKE IT RIGHT. &gt;&gt; That is what the scripture says. &gt;&gt; And when you go back and make it right, you the person have offended should be able to say, "Brother, I have even forgiven you." That is the love of God. Oh, I love God. God is in my heart. What kind of love do you have when you can't forgive your your own self? Oh, if you're not able to forgive your brother, it's a reflection of your character. &gt;&gt; I don't care how many prayer tongues or whatsoever you give or prophecies you give. If you can't forgive, I don't know why I'm dwelling on this this morning. &gt;&gt; It's horrible. We all brothers. We all sisters. I would offend you. Please. Your mouth. In your mouth, you have your teeth in there. You have your tongue in there. It gets [snorts] to a point in time, those two, they fight. Oh yes, they fight. And when they fighting, don't know when they fight. They fight over food. When there's food in your mouth and you're eating, the teeth will just slam the tongue and you go like, it's painful. But at the end of it all, the two are STILL LIVING IN THE SAME MOUTH. &gt;&gt; THE TWO ARE STILL THERE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ABLE TO EAT. So if I offend you and you come to church like God bless you. &gt;&gt; Look this God blessing is even a curse. &gt;&gt; Don't say it. &gt;&gt; Go and repent and come back and tell me that God bless you. &gt;&gt; God merciful to us. We have two doors. One is good, one is evil. But my prayer is the Lord, may we have the good one. May we make the right choice this hour. May we make the right choice this morning. If you don't have any choice to make, say, Lord, may your will be done upon my life. &gt;&gt; That's all we need for. And this starts from one place, from your mind. I wrote something. He said, "Your thoughts becomes your words. Your words becomes your actions. Your actions becomes your habit. Your habit becomes your attitude. And your attitude becomes your character. And your character shows me who you are." And that's the reason why prophet said character a godly character is victory because if you have the character of Christ in you there is nothing you can never overcome on this earth. I don't care what the challenges will be. It might be so huge. The almighty God will give you that character to overcome it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. The prophet said now it's a strange thing that this is so much taught of people they say well I am weak my faith is not very much I am not a very good Christian says that's just what the devil wants you to stay &gt;&gt; you are just talking his language right You're talking the devil's language. Oh, I don't have the strength. I'm not that good. Who is good? Who is good? He said, you must never say that. Don't never let your testimony be negative. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; LET IT BE POSITIVE ALL [screaming] THE TIME. &gt;&gt; He didn't say sometime. He said what? [snorts] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am saved." That should be your testimony. &gt;&gt; I have God in my heart. &gt;&gt; I believe him with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Do you believe in DIVINE HEALING? WITH ALL MY HEART. &gt;&gt; Do you believe you ARE SAVED? WITH ALL MY HEART. &gt;&gt; DO you believe YOU ARE BLESSED? WITH ALL MY HEART. CHURCH, don't say something negative about your life. &gt;&gt; You know our mouths, the words out of your mouth are powerful. &gt;&gt; There are two edges sword. I would always want to say something positive about myself. &gt;&gt; When I say something about positive about myself, then I say something positive about everybody around me. I've always said that look the reflection of who I am is the same thing of those around me. If I speak positive I always have people that speak positive around me instead of oh but sometimes you know oh yeah sometimes but let your reflection reflect in them. If you know the God you serve let that be a reflection in the life of those you're working with. Don't let if they're able to influence you, go back in there and take complete inventory of your life. Choose you this day whom you will serve. &gt;&gt; If you're going to serve God, serve him in the complete fullness of his glory. If you want to serve the devil, that's up to you. But Joseph said, "For me and my household, we will serve the Almighty God." It says, "And God can only bless you as you confess that he has done it for you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God can only bless you as you confess that he has done it for who? for you. &gt;&gt; He is the high priest of your confession. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He can only do for us as we accept it. &gt;&gt; And believe it and confess it. &gt;&gt; Look at the three. It says what he can only do for us as we accept it. That's right. &gt;&gt; If you don't accept it, IT CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; And you believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe I am healed. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the devil would do. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the devil will plan against my life. As long as I believe that I am healed, I am healed. &gt;&gt; Oh, pastor has prayed for me so many years. Everything is not working out. Believe it. &gt;&gt; I am growing. I don't know when I'm going to get married. Believe it. You will surely get married. I have been praying for the seed of the womb all these years but I don't know where church believe it. &gt;&gt; Let it be the confession of your mouth. &gt;&gt; Let everything about you be positive. &gt;&gt; We are always cloud with negativity. &gt;&gt; When things go way we don't know the god we're serving. Then we go like what is going on? Look, the moment you start complaining, &gt;&gt; I've always been saying this forever. I said, look, the moment you start complaining, that problem wouldn't go, but that problem will continue multiplying. Do you know why? Because you are watering the problem. &gt;&gt; The more you complain, you've taken water and watering that problem. And you know what going to do? because you are worshiping it and you're complaining about it, it will keep growing. It will keep growing. But when that problem is in there and say you I have a God. &gt;&gt; He said in his word, &gt;&gt; he is never never going to leave me nor forsake me. &gt;&gt; He also said in his word, I am not fighting against flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; He also said in his word that the Lord is my shepherd. He also said in his word, I am the alpha and the omega. &gt;&gt; He also said in his word that whosoever asks, it shall be GRANTED UNTO HIM. &gt;&gt; YOU [screaming] THIS EVIL OR WHATSOEVER obstacle it is, I am victorious. &gt;&gt; Do you know what you do? You suppress the problem. &gt;&gt; Believe it and confess it. Jesus Christ is my savior. All things are mine by God. &gt;&gt; Church, when we're coming this morning, we had a lot of conversations, but there's something that came in and I want to encourage you. This end time message, God has given us every promise in his word. But this end times it tend to we've always surrounded in a way that it seems that we don't prosper. It seems that we don't grow. We tend to we tend to uh h um portion like being prosperous as evil. Look, I can give you in the message where the prophet the brah himself talked about being prosperous. He said that I will buy a certain type of car. My son will buy something different and the other one will buy something greater. Look at the possession. Look, we need to believe in God that God has given us everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; The point is the motive behind what he has given to you and how you're going to use it. &gt;&gt; When money comes in, it tends to bring in pride. &gt;&gt; That's that's the whole thing. You tend to feel so high and mighty. You tend to do respect. But look, it's no wrong to be blessed. &gt;&gt; It's not wrong to be rich. &gt;&gt; It's no wrong to be prosperous. &gt;&gt; It has been given to us in this word. And he said, "I have given everything." &gt;&gt; He didn't say some. &gt;&gt; He said, "What?" Everything. [screaming] So everything on on earth here is for me. &gt;&gt; Abraham said, "Never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it. When it starts, don't entertain it. &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "I can't help the thoughts from coming." It's true. You can't help it. It will surely come. Sometimes in the especially when somebody has done something against you, you want to open your mouth annoyed if you can strike this person. Oh yeah. Sometimes we do that. I hate this brother. Who gave you a spirit of hate? I dislike this sister. Really? I come to the house of God. He said, "Well, I can't help the thought from coming." The prophet said, "Like the farmer that said he couldn't he couldn't stop the bears from flying over his place. But he could sure stop them from roosting. You can't help the thoughts when they come. But don't entertain them. Just let them pass. &gt;&gt; Look, negative thoughts will always come. &gt;&gt; This mind of always is always revolving. &gt;&gt; As you're sitting down here, listen to me. There are a lot of thoughts rumbling in your minds. Oh yes, some is thinking about oh I need to go to work. Someone is thinking that when we close service, what food am I going to eat? Someone is thinking tomorrow the children will be going to school. There are a lot of thoughts rumbling in there. But you know what? Don't let the negative ones have that effect upon your life. We tend to let these negative thoughts affect us to the extent that our faces become so crumbled when we are walking. Oh yes, you see people's faces instead of you being so bright and praising almighty God. They look so crumbled like they are fighting with you. They're not fighting with you. They're fighting with themselves. DROP THIS BURDEN. &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "LEAVE THEM AT my feet. &gt;&gt; He's surely going to handle them for you." &gt;&gt; Look, there's no problem or burden that you can solve. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. I'm telling you church, everything that you've solved is not by your grace. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's by the grace of the almighty God. &gt;&gt; He has done it for you. &gt;&gt; So why don't you put every burden at his feet? &gt;&gt; If you can't pay your bills, put it at his feet. He will surely grant it. &gt;&gt; If there's sickness, put it at his feet. He's surely going. Look, he is the healer. &gt;&gt; He is the provider. &gt;&gt; He is our comforter. Amen. &gt;&gt; He is our shield. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he has promised us that I'll be with you &gt;&gt; even in you, &gt;&gt; today, &gt;&gt; tomorrow, and when? &gt;&gt; To the end of the world. &gt;&gt; So, did I put smile on your face? &gt;&gt; Let's give a clap offering to the mighty God. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is one thing as children of God. I know that we need to make a choice. But I should believe that I know the choices you are making. And the choice is to follow Jesus. I want to follow Jesus the rest of my life. &gt;&gt; And if I know the man I am following, I'll always create a very good atmosphere around me. The prophet said you create your own atmosphere around you. Don't never have no negative testimony. It says testify positive. &gt;&gt; Jesus has healed me. I am well. &gt;&gt; Go and you receive your healing. These are creating that atmosphere around you believing that the almighty God has done it. Let me give a little testimony here. There was a sister and a brother got married. They've been seeking for the fruit of the womb for quite a long time. They had struggled it every medical help and staff and prayer and everything. They've done it. But according to that testimony, they said they went down to a servant of God and the servant of God told them now says, "Do you believe that God can give you?" said, "Yes, I believe it." He said, "Then go and start preparing for it." Do you know what she did? She created her own atmosphere. Church, let's create our own atmosphere. &gt;&gt; She went back home, prepared a room. Honey, let's go and buy the court. Let's go and buy this. What sex do you want? She said, "Oh, I think this should be a female. Let's buy all the pinky pinky stuffs. You know ladies and pinky color and ladies love pinky colors. That's your nature. Don't worry. Bought all the pinky pinky stuff. Dress the whole place. You enter to the room, the whole place is so pinky pinky. So you get to see that this is a baby girl coming. She believed in HER OWN TESTIMONY. SHE CREATED HER OWN ATMOSPHERE AROUND IT. And do you KNOW WHAT? BY THE GRACE OF GOD, SHE GAVE birth to a baby girl. &gt;&gt; Church. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have testimonies you can give. &gt;&gt; What's your testimony this morning? &gt;&gt; What's your testimony? Is it testimony of negativity? Till when? Lord, till when? Don't ask God that question. &gt;&gt; DON'T ASK HIM TILL WHEN. What you need to ask God is that Lord, I thank you for what you have given me [laughter] &gt;&gt; and I thank you for what you are still giving me &gt;&gt; and I'm thanking you for what you even have in store for me &gt;&gt; and I KNOW AT THE RIGHT TIME &gt;&gt; LISTEN AT THE WHAT AT THE RIGHT TIME &gt;&gt; you will give it to me. You see this watch? This time is not God's time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What's the time right now? Almost half 11 if I'm right. Good. According to God's time is not half. God is preparing his own time. &gt;&gt; If you are seeking for something, let me encourage you this morning. If you're seeking for something, if you want to get married and you're getting old, look, let that old age be a beauty of your life. &gt;&gt; Don't let anybody pressure you. Don't anybody push you and you are GETTING LOOK IF ANYBODY TELLS YOU THAT WHEN WILL YOU GET MARRIED SAY when will you die? ASK THE PERSON WHEN WILL THE PERSON DIE. If you are asking ME WHEN WILL I GET MARRIED. God bless you brother. God bless your sister. [laughter] Please when will you also die. &gt;&gt; You asking ME WHEN I GET MARRIED. I DON'T KNOW. &gt;&gt; JUST AS YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO DIE. &gt;&gt; SO PRAISE GOD FOR MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; Hey sister, you're getting too old brother. Hey everybody's getting sister please when is your casket also getting ready we don't make fun behind the pulpit but what I'm telling you is the truth &gt;&gt; I don't know when a brother is going to get married I don't know when a sister is going to get married just the same way I don't know when I'm going to die all I just need to do is I need to thank God for the kind of life I am living. &gt;&gt; I need to live in line with the word of God. As long as I've chosen to serve God, all I do is I put my trust in him. &gt;&gt; I put my belief in him. I PUT EVERYTHING OF MY LIFE ON GOD AND HE WILL DO IT ACCORDING TO HIS RICHES IN GLORY. &gt;&gt; Please tell me, married ones, those that have children, when did you know when you're going to give birth? Oh no, let's talk about this. &gt;&gt; There are certain things we need to talk in the house of God. Don't let us talk about it outside. Let's talk about it in the house of God. &gt;&gt; When did you know you're going to give birth to your your 12-year-old son? Pastor, so sorry I'm using him. &gt;&gt; God gave him to you in his own appointed time. &gt;&gt; That is the same way he's going to work everything for your good in his time. Child don't rush things. All it just need is just to believe. Say, "Lord, I believe you. I believe in your steps. I believe in your direction. I believe in your blessing. When the time is right, I know you will make it right. When the time is right, he will make it beautiful. &gt;&gt; Look, &gt;&gt; just put your trust in the Almighty God. Oh Lord, I've been desiring this. Lord, when? Lord, when? Lord, when? Look, if you want to ask God when, challenge him. I'm giving a secret to that. Challenge him. Do you know the almighty God has given us the the the the step to challenge him? Do you know that &gt;&gt; I'm almost the victim? I don't know the vote. I'm just bringing across. It says that whatsoever you want me to do, challenge me. It's in the scriptures. But you don't challenge him. You go to him. Look, if pastor son wants something, he stand up and goes to pastor. Pastor, daddy. No, he wouldn't use pastor. Sorry. Daddy, my teacher says that I need to bring this and this and this and that. Do you know what the son has done? He's given his orders. He doesn't care how you're going to provide. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you getting it? &gt;&gt; Ah, church get the revelation of this. &gt;&gt; When it goes to mama, mommy teacher says that I need to do this. the head mistress or head master says I you need to do this and this and he has put his request. HE DOESN'T CARE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want to know how you're going to do it. &gt;&gt; All he wants that it should be done. &gt;&gt; That's right. [laughter] &gt;&gt; At the end of it, &gt;&gt; it will be done. &gt;&gt; GO TO GOD. TELL HIM THAT LORD, I HAVE SAVED YOU WITH MY LIFE IN SINCERITY and in honesty. &gt;&gt; I HAVE PAID MY DUES. I'VE PAID MY TITHE. CHURCH, there's one thing we tend to omit. &gt;&gt; And this I know majority of ministers find it difficult to see, but I'm going to say it here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am a minister of which I always pray to God that God should open up the blessings for his children. &gt;&gt; And if you want to receive the blessings of God, do you know what it is? It says bring your tithes and offering to the house. &gt;&gt; Look, paying of tithe, don't assume that pain of tithe is for your pastor. &gt;&gt; Don't assume that paying of tithe is for the for the enrichment of your pastor. Lord, &gt;&gt; if you get the revelation of the pain of tithe, when you pay tithe, you are opening an account in heaven. &gt;&gt; Church, get this very well. When you pay your tithe, you are opening an account in heaven. And that account in heaven is the bank is the bank of heaven. When the moment you pay your tithe, you are deposited in your account. If your account is Nelson, it will bear the name Nelson. When I when I pay my tithe, it goes into my account. It doesn't go into the account of Bati. It goes into my own account. And when it gets into my account, you know doing what I'm doing. I'm counting my blessings. &gt;&gt; I want to feel free. Pastor, I hope I'm I'm I'm I'm at God bless you. &gt;&gt; When you open that account, that account has lot of blessings. &gt;&gt; Oh church, are you getting this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That account in THAT ACCOUNT THERE'S EVERY BLESSING OF GOD IN IT. ALL you need to do is pay your money into your account. That account don't assume that account is for somebody. It's your name. &gt;&gt; Inscribed with the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's yours. &gt;&gt; So as you're putting it in there, you are feeling your blessings. &gt;&gt; So when IT COMES TO THE POINT OF WHEREBY YOU WANT TO GO DOWN TO YOUR ACCOUNT AND WITHDRAW THE BLESSINGS FOR HEALING, hold on. If you have a bank account and you have money in it, when you're going to the bank, you go with your chest out, your shoulders high. Why? Because you know that you have money in there. &gt;&gt; You are going to withdraw. But when you have just about just two pound or five pound, would you go to the bank with your shoulders high? You are even ashamed going. Amen. &gt;&gt; You ashamed going. That's the same way in your heavenly account when it's empty and you're going before God. &gt;&gt; Lord, Lord have mercy on me. But when you have it full and you go there, say, Lord, I want my healing. &gt;&gt; The almighty God says, test me. &gt;&gt; I love that word. HE SAID, "TRY ME [screaming] &gt;&gt; AND SEE IF I WOULDN'T OPEN UP THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN &gt;&gt; AND BLESS YOU." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PLEASE, is it in the word of God or not? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I the one saying it? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Oh, church, answer me. Am I the one saying it? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; God is challenging you. &gt;&gt; Put it in there. When you go, the Lord, I have served you faithfully. I have paid my tithe and offense. I have served it diligently. Look, this time this situation is coming. I want to lose my job. And I've been faithful to you. I don't know why they want to do this. Father, may your everlasting presence come and take control. &gt;&gt; No, God will be there at that very moment. Even if you lose that job, &gt;&gt; he will open up a wonderful window for you. &gt;&gt; No, there are a lot of things you can challenge God &gt;&gt; for your healing. Go to that account. And that account, God is sitting there. He is the bank manager. He's watching it as he flows. Oh, okay. My son is doing fine. My daughter is doing good. Okay. He's always looking at your account every day. Look at your account. The moment you go there and you ring the bell and say, "Lord, master," he said, "Yes, my son, my daughter. Here I am. What is it?" Said, "Lord, I'm coming to cash out of my account." &gt;&gt; What are you coming to cash out? I'm coming to cash out my wedding ceremony. &gt;&gt; What are you coming to cash out? I'm coming to cash out my son. What are you coming to cash? I'm coming to cash out my daughter. &gt;&gt; What are you coming to cash out? I'm coming to cash out my blessings. &gt;&gt; Church, look, we have a living God. &gt;&gt; I know that the choice you've made today is to follow Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And if you if you've decided to follow him, let's do what is required of him. &gt;&gt; And let's stop the complaints. We are more than the complaints. We have the power over every complaint. Create the positive atmosphere &gt;&gt; in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you believe it, if you work on it, it will reflect on you. Let me read this from the prophecies. I just want to say there's so many people passing through here that suffering with mental oppression, demon manifestation, but oppression is from the devil. The prophet said, "I seen a vision break before me of a young lady. She went back there and sat down a few minutes ago that she thinks she's crossed the separating line." He says, "Don't let Satan tell you that as long as you love God and God still loves you, DON'T LET THE devil tell you that &gt;&gt; Lord, my end has come to an end." What end is come to an end? &gt;&gt; Who created thy end? &gt;&gt; Who brought thy end? You look the scripture says as long as God hasn't said it, it would never be. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can ever befall you until the purpose of God in your life is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; If everything God has destined for your life isn't been fulfilled, you are going nowhere. &gt;&gt; Let the devil DO WHATEVER WANTS. LOOK, LET ALL THE DEVILS OF HELL, &gt;&gt; THE VOODOO IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES, let them come. Oh, you have the power to overcome them. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the enemy would do. Look, you know, the devil is just a funny fool. &gt;&gt; When it comes in, he's just wingling his to he's wingling his tail. Look, the moment he comes in and he's just shaking and just and you're also scared, &gt;&gt; then it stops and it start popping off. But when it comes and see you yourself, you're strong and powerful. Then it starts panicking. &gt;&gt; Don't give room to the enemy. &gt;&gt; Church, don't let us give room to him. &gt;&gt; He has no power over you. &gt;&gt; He has no power over us. &gt;&gt; We have the victory. &gt;&gt; Church, I said we have the victory. &gt;&gt; We have the victory. Don't let Satan tell you that as long as you love God, God still loves you. It says it has to be a creator to create that creation in your heart to make you love God. Isn't this beautiful? Go believing with all your heart that Christ loves you. church. We can talk more. There is lot more. But I want us to have a little reflection this hour and probably close around this time. You are not here on this earth by chance. You are not bought on this earth to come over and suffer. God brought you here for a purpose. And that purpose is to live a victorious life. &gt;&gt; I Nelson I said I believe it. &gt;&gt; He brought you here to live a victorious life. &gt;&gt; But we have given the enemy the chance to toy with us. And you know what he does? Instead of we having the love of God in our lives, he has rather put enmity in our lives. Then things that we can overcome with love, we are trying to overcome it with en with envy. Maybe a brother can help you out of a certain situation. You hate the brother. A sister can help you out of that situation. You hate THE SISTER. WHY? JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING SOME political issue. Where is the virtue of forgiveness? Do you know that forgiveness is also a virtue? It is. Just as love is a virtue, forgiveness is in there. Don't tell me that you love God and you're unable to forgive. Don't tell me that you love God and you're not able to help one another. And we live hypocritical life and we come here every day then we sing and praise the almighty God. Whom are we serving? choose you this day whom you will serve. &gt;&gt; I and my household, we shall serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Church, let the team of our life be God. &gt;&gt; Everything we are going through is just a face of life. Every challenge you're going through, I said is what is a face &gt;&gt; because he God has given us the power to overcome and in his time we would overcome everything. And I can even say probably right now you are even overcoming. &gt;&gt; So why don't you believe it? Why the moment? Why the pain? Why are you giving up? People would come to church and because they not able to see, they go like the church there's no love. You are the [clears throat] first culprit of lack of love. &gt;&gt; It's not the church. There's always love in the house of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Find your position in the house of God and do what's expected of you and leave the rest to God. &gt;&gt; May the Almighty God help us. &gt;&gt; May he help you. &gt;&gt; May he guide you. &gt;&gt; May he protect you &gt;&gt; and may he make you see the light that's before you. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever the devil is taking away from you in the might name of Jesus, may it be restored back to you. Whatsoever the devil is trying to put around your path that is making you shaky, may it be put behind you. &gt;&gt; Stand on the word of God, stand on the CROSS &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "LORD, [screaming] HAVE MERCY ON ME. &gt;&gt; I AM BELIEVING IN YOU. I choose this day to follow you the rest of my life." &gt;&gt; Who's ready to do that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "Who's ready to do that?" Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't you stand to your feet with your eyes closed, your heads bowed? I want you to just quiet and just have a reflection of your life. Don't look at who is on your right and who's on your left. I said, eyes closed. Ask the almighty GOD, LORD, WHERE HAVE I GONE WRONG? Today I have decided to follow you Lord. I am not turning back again and I have if I have come and I go back I come and go back today I am not going back anymore. &gt;&gt; I want to create that positive atmosphere of my life. You have spoken to me. He said there is no negativity at all in Christianity. It's all positive done paid for. It is finished. Where was it finished? On the cross of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Everything about YOUR LIFE IS FINISHED. EVERYTHING. WHY IS THE WORRY? WHY IS THE BED IN CHURCH? Why can't you see the GLORY OF GOD AMONGST US? But the glory of God is among us. here. It's just that we don't believe. It says, think of it. It's all completed. It's all finished. It says God cannot do anything else. It's already completed. when he died at Calvary, every sin that was ever committed or ever would or ever would be committed was forgiven right there on the basis of the shed blood. But it says, "But it will never do you no good until you accept it." &gt;&gt; Choose you this day whom you receive. The power of our choices. When you're going to get get married, the choice of partner is you. Whatsoever you get into that marriage happens. It's your choice. There is more we can talk about, but there's no time. I just want us to have this reflection. Think of the choice you're making today. I believe that you've all decided I want to follow Jesus. The less live in line with his word. Every promise in his word is given to you and I. Let's claim it by faith. Who has decided to walk with Jesus today? I have decided to walk with Jesus today of my life. Talk to him and say, "Lord, have your way in my life." Talk to him. Say, "Lord, have mercy on me." Talk to the almighty God and ask and say, "Lord Jesus, I want to make the right Today I have decided to follow you. I'm not turning back again. May almighty grace and mercy lead me. May you guide me. May you direct me. Direct my path. May every path of my life be you. Everything of my life from A to Z be you. Every breath of my life, let it be you. Even when I speak, may it be you. The step I take, may it be you. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. No turning back. No turning back. Hold your keyboard. Hold your keyboard. I have this to follow you. Oh, I have [screaming] decided to follow [screaming] Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; No turning [singing] back. No turning back. I want to ask the church this morning or afternoon who would want to make every commitment to follow Jesus this hour. Take it that almighty God is standing before you this hour. Look at him on the cross of Calvary. LOOK AT HIS BLOOD SHED FOR YOU BECAUSE OF YOU. AND ON THAT BUS IS CRYING AND SAY IT IS FINISHED. He's finished everything for you and I. &gt;&gt; Where do you want to turn to right now? &gt;&gt; Why don't you rededicate your life once again to him and say, "Lord, I have your way in my life." COMMIT YOUR HUSBAND TO THE ALMIGHTY GOD. COMMIT YOUR WIFE TO ALMIGHTY GOD. BRING YOUR CHILDREN TO THE ALTAR OF THE MIGHTY GOD. BRING YOUR HOUSEHOLD TO him and SAY, "LORD, I AND my household, WE SHALL SERVE THE Lord and he will surely grant your heart desires. Young ones, make it this day. Choose you this day whom you will serve." LOOK, BE A REFLECTION OF GOD IN WHEREVER YOU ARE. In your school, your workplace, in your house, in your community, wherever you are, be that reflection of God. And before you can be a reflection of him, that is when you've taken him completely as your own. Ah Lord to us before I hand over to the pastor I want to ask the church if you want to be remembered in prayers the pastor will pray for us if you know that You've wandered away from him. You've wandered far in sin. Wandered far away and unbelief and you want to come home. Why don't you signify by the raising of your hands? If you want to also approach the altar and I want all eyes closed, please all eyes closed. If you want to approach the altar, you can do so this hour. Say, "Lord, have mercy on me." Don't let it be too late. Don't let it to be tomorrow. If you feel led, just do and say, "Lord, here I am." If you also want to raise your hand, you can just raise your hand wherever you are and say, "Lord Jesus, have your way in my life." And as we sing this song, we invite the pastor to take over to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. No turning back. &gt;&gt; No turning back. &gt;&gt; I have decided. I have decided &gt;&gt; to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have to follow Jesus. The world behind me. &gt;&gt; The world behind me. &gt;&gt; Cross before me. The world behind me. Turn. Amen. Coming home, Lord. I'm coming home. And if you know a song, Lord, I'm coming home. Coming. Oh, never to open. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm coming. One more time. Coming home never more to roll.

And sure indeed the father was there his arms wide open to receive him. He did not judge him. He did not go through all history. You made the wrong decision there. You see you are paying it off now. I say my son come. I've been waiting for you for so many years. I knew you'll come back. Why don't you come? That invitation we had this morning. Oh my son, my daughter, maybe you have been through many negativity. Why don't you come home? I'm your open my arms wide open for you to receive you and to walk with you.

We acknowledge the weakness in us that Lord there is nothing that we can do but we know that Lord you went to the cross. You nailed all our weaknesses. You given us the strength to overcome. Lord, you fought the battle for us. And you said that we are more than overcomers. The only thing we need to do is to make a decision to walk with you. The power of decision is in our hands. Joshua said, "For me and my household, we will worship the Lord." We are also making a decision this morning that we want to follow through. It doesn't matter what happens, Lord. We are not turning back because we know that there's nothing good out there. There is nothing good out there. The world is crumbling. Everything is turning bad.
