[10:09] Jesus, Lord. And we do need the faith of
[10:12] Jesus Christ. Not our own human faith,
[10:15] but we need the faith of Jesus Christ in
[10:18] our lives. So Lord, we know that Lord
[10:20] Jesus, the power is already in the
[10:23] skies. It's already already there. The
[10:25] Holy Spirit has been poured out and
[10:28] we're expecting Lord Jesus to rise up a
[10:31] little higher as we hear the word of God
[10:33] this morning. Thank you Lord for
[10:35] everyone that has come. Thank you for
[10:37] brother Menow and his wife Lord. And
[10:39] Lord Jesus, we bring our sister Sharifa
[10:42] before you. Oh God, she needs comfort.
[10:45] She needs strength in this hour, Lord.
[10:47] She needs your comfort, Lord. Our
[10:50] comfort, our condolences,
[10:53] Lord, are just human. But Lord Jesus,
[10:55] you can condole her, Lord. You can
[10:57] comfort her with your comfort, Lord.
[11:00] Bless her, Lord Jesus, today that she
[11:03] might be able to receive the word of God
[11:06] because we've got promises in the word
[11:08] of God, and we thank you for that. Bless
[11:10] brother Andrew as he leads us in song.
[11:13] Bless every exercise. Lord, we remember
[11:15] our sister Agnes. Lord, trusting that
[11:18] she's doing better. In the name of
[11:20] Jesus, I pray that you would raise her
[11:23] up completely.
[11:25] And those, Lord, that are in need, that
[11:28] are in pain, that are sick this morning,
[11:31] those that are not here this morning.
[11:33] Lord Jesus, I pray that you'd bless them
[11:36] wherever they are. And may your spirit
[11:39] move upon every one of us. Give us a
[11:41] revival in our soul. The bride's
[11:44] revival. I know there's no revival out
[11:46] there, Lord Jesus. But Father, we need a
[11:49] revival. Your bride needs a revival. We
[11:52] need a renewing of your spirit, Lord. We
[11:56] pray that in this morning, Lord, that we
[11:58] will receive our portion. Hallelujah.
[12:01] Thank you, Lord. We're expecting you to
[12:03] move by your spirit. Bless the service
[12:06] this morning in Jesus' name. Amen. And

[12:46] New heights. I'm gaining
[12:50] every day.
[12:53] Still praying as
[12:56] I'm onward bound.
[12:59] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[13:03] ground.
[13:05] Lord, lift me up
[13:09] and let me stand
[13:12] by faith on heaven's
[13:16] table land.
[13:19] a higher plane
[13:22] than I have found.
[13:25] Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
[13:31] My heart has no
[13:34] desire to stay.
[13:38] Where doubts arise
[13:41] and fears dismay.
[13:44] Though some may dwell
[13:47] where these abound,
[13:50] my prayer, my aim is higher ground.
[13:56] Lord, lift me up
[13:59] and let me stand
[14:03] on faith by heaven's
[14:06] table land.
[14:09] a higher plane
[14:12] than I have found.
[14:16] Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
[14:21] I want to live
[14:25] above the world.
[14:28] Though Satan's dogs
[14:31] and me are heard,
[14:34] for faith has come.
[14:37] The joyful sound,
[14:41] the song on higher ground.
[14:46] Lord, lift me up
[14:49] and let me stand
[14:53] by faith on heaven's
[14:56] table land.
[14:59] A higher plane
[15:02] than I have found.
[15:05] Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
[15:11] I want to scale
[15:14] the utmost
[15:18] and catch a gleam
[15:21] of glory bright.
[15:24] But still I pray,
[15:27] still heaven I found.
[15:30] Lord, lead me onto higher ground.
[15:36] Lord, lift me up
[15:39] and let me stand
[15:42] by faith on heaven's
[15:46] table and
[15:49] a higher plane
[15:52] than I have found.

[15:59] ground.

[18:53] There's a a request here for brother
[18:55] Menow to sing and there's an exclamation
[18:57] point at the end. So I think they really
[19:00] want that to happen. So we'll we'll just
[19:02] sing uh soon and very soon as as you'd
[19:04] come
[19:09] [Music]
[19:10] soon and very soon we are going to see
[19:15] the king.

[20:00] We are going to see our king.
[20:03] [Music]
[20:06] &gt;&gt; Well, the Lord bless you all. It's good
[20:08] to be here and uh to everything there is
[20:12] the first time
[20:14] once in life there's something for the
[20:16] first this is the first time I've been
[20:18] in this congregation
[20:20] and um usually of course you're all
[20:24] familiar we meet where the big when we
[20:27] gather in the middle of the year usually
[20:30] but um it's good to be here tonight I've
[20:32] got kind of a special reason for coming
[20:34] not altogether because this is not an
[20:37] opportunity which It is. But uh uh I
[20:40] feel a bit like St. Paul of old. Uh I
[20:43] mean of old.
[20:45] [Music]
[20:47] And uh when Timothy, he instructed
[20:50] Timothy along the way. I was just
[20:52] happened to open my Bible and dropped
[20:54] over to Timothy this morning. And I
[20:56] think brother
[20:58] gift has been like a Timothy to me. He
[21:02] sold with us for 22 years. And Emmon Jr.
[21:07] you know, they they mean they're part of
[21:10] our congregation. And and um I feel
[21:13] greatly honored whenever he goes. He
[21:15] said, "Well, uh I was going to come last
[21:17] weekend." He said, "Well, I'm going to
[21:18] Brother Jerry's." And I said, "After
[21:20] that," he said, "Well, the following
[21:21] weekend, I'm going to be Brother Zigg
[21:23] and and uh Brother Hammermeister." And I
[21:25] said, "Well, we'll take the second one
[21:27] then. I get an opportunity to be here
[21:29] with you." So, it's a blessing. It is a
[21:32] real blessing.
[21:34] this part here now that uh you know my
[21:37] voice is not what it used to be and uh
[21:40] in fact that remains for the whole being
[21:42] of me is not what I used to be uh this
[21:45] is what I used to be but it's good to be
[21:46] here and uh I'm supposed to sing the
[21:50] greatest morning ever
[21:53] let me tell you something I believe it
[21:54] we are so close to it I woke up this
[21:59] morning
[22:02] wondering Could this be the day
[22:07] when those who beneath us are resting
[22:13] would arise to bring on that new day.
[22:19] Then my heart began
[22:22] to beat for joy
[22:25] knowing what day that will be.
[22:31] When the bride will go to meet Jesus,
[22:37] the bride whom she so long to see.
[22:42] It will be the greatest
[22:46] morning ever when our loved ones again
[22:51] we behold.
[22:54] This time we'll meet
[22:58] never to part with Jesus. We'll always
[23:04] be.
[23:06] The signs and times are telling us
[23:12] that this is the day he'll return.
[23:17] There's wars and earthquakes
[23:21] everywhere.
[23:23] Hearts failing for the trouble they see.
[23:29] And a prophet has cried
[23:32] out again. Oh people return back to God.
[23:40] For Jesus is coming for a bride whose
[23:46] garments are spotless and white.
[23:51] Oh, it will be. Please sing it with me.
[23:54] Greatest morning ever when our loved
[23:58] ones again we behold.
[24:03] This time we'll meet.
[24:06] Never tooart. With Jesus we'll always
[24:12] be. Oh, it will be the greatest morning
[24:19] ever when our loved ones again we
[24:23] behold.
[24:25] This time we'll meet.
[24:29] Never to part with Jesus. will always be
[24:39] will be.
[24:44] God bless you all.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; He he sung that whole song without any
[25:00] lyrics on there. And so I think he's uh
[25:05] he's being humble when he says he's not
[25:07] what he used to be. I can't even
[25:08] remember what I had for lunch yesterday.
[25:10] So thank thank you for singing.
[25:15] And uh Sister Raheima and Sister Esther
[25:17] have a song also. So, let's just um

[25:22] and very soon as they go.
[25:25] Soon and very soon we are going to see
[25:30] our king.
[25:33] Soon and very soon we are going to see
[25:37] our king.
[25:39] Soon and very soon we are going to see
[25:44] our king.
[25:46] Hallelu.
[25:47] Hallelu.
[25:49] We are going to see our king.
[25:56] We are going to see our king.

[43:08] Jesus Christ.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing that song we sung. uh
[43:13] earlier uh
[43:16] I'm pressing on the upward way.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; I I believe that's why we are here in
[43:21] the house of the Lord.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; I'm pressing on
[43:28] the upward way.
[43:31] You son came
[43:35] every day.
[43:38] Still praying as
[43:41] I'm onward bound.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
[43:49] Lord, lift me up
[43:53] and let me stand
[43:56] by faith on heaven's
[43:59] table.
[44:02] A higher plane
[44:05] than I have found.
[44:08] Oh Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
[44:14] My heart has no
[44:17] desire to stay.
[44:20] where doubts arise
[44:23] and fears dismay.
[44:26] Though some may dwell
[44:29] where knees abound,
[44:33] my prayer, my aim is higher ground.
[44:38] Lord, lift me up
[44:41] and let me stand
[44:44] by faith on heaven's
[44:48] table.
[44:51] A higher plane
[44:54] that I have found.
[44:57] Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
[45:02] I want to live
[45:06] above the world.
[45:09] Though Satan's darts
[45:12] at me are heard,
[45:15] for faith has called
[45:18] the joyful sound.
[45:21] Oh, the song of saints on higher ground.
[45:27] Lord, lift me up
[45:30] and let me stand.
[45:33] My faith on heaven
[45:37] table,
[45:39] &gt;&gt; a higher place
[45:42] than I have found.
[45:45] Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
[45:51] I want to scale
[45:54] the utmost high
[45:57] and catch a gleam
[46:00] of glory bright.
[46:04] But still I pray
[46:07] till heaven I found.
[46:10] Lord lead me onto higher ground.
[46:15] Lord, lift me up
[46:18] and let me stand
[46:21] by faith on heaven's
[46:25] table land.
[46:28] A higher place
[46:31] than I have found.
[46:34] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[46:38] ground.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire this morning?
[46:43] We may take our seats just for a few
[46:45] moments.
[46:48] I have a pleasant surprise to see
[46:53] uh my elder brother Meno and sister
[46:55] Irene there.
[46:57] We are thankful to to be together this
[47:00] morning.
[47:02] Uh like uh he said I'm like a Timothy to
[47:05] him. If I had to ch had a church that I
[47:10] would be pastoring and he would just
[47:13] walk and uh show up uh right away I
[47:16] would uh stop preaching and give him to
[47:19] uh continue.
[47:21] So we are very thankful sat under his
[47:24] ministry 23 24 years and uh the lord was
[47:29] gracious work together
[47:31] uh shaped me to be the preacher I am
[47:34] today. never preached in my country
[47:37] Zambia until I came here. And uh like
[47:41] the Bible would say uh it wasn't Timothy
[47:45] uh poking at Paul uh to want to preach.
[47:49] It was that Paul recognized the gift
[47:51] that was in Timothy.
[47:54] And that's why there's something about
[47:55] elders that we need to respect.
[47:58] Uh because they have walked where we
[48:01] have not walked yet.
[48:04] So uh we thank uh uh it's the first time
[48:07] to be in this church. I'm not sure if
[48:10] brother Zik Claw is is here or there. We
[48:13] we heard about you many many years dear
[48:16] brother. Uh during the years of brother
[48:18] Herod Hildebrand uh we would come for
[48:21] those conventions there and uh your name
[48:24] always popped up. Uh such a veteran uh
[48:28] been serving the Lord with all your
[48:30] heart. God bless you richly with your
[48:32] dear wife and family and uh we are
[48:36] thankful to be in the house of the Lord
[48:38] together. Um we pray that uh you keep
[48:43] throwing another share and helping us
[48:46] young ones go along with uh with the
[48:48] word of God.
[48:50] Amen. We uh thank brother Mosa here and
[48:54] Dala uh and his dear wife and family for
[48:57] uh receiving us. um and um uh inviting
[49:02] us to come and speak here this morning.
[49:06] Uh brother Mosa has been a friend over a
[49:09] few years now and uh even coming to
[49:12] Saskatoon and here in Edmonton we have
[49:15] uh crossed paths uh last time you hosted
[49:18] us uh and we had that uh really really
[49:22] nice African food. Uh
[49:25] uh it had been a long time since we had
[49:28] that and when I took a bite of it, oh
[49:31] my, that was uh and the sister can cook.
[49:34] And so it was very good uh to to to have
[49:38] that. Uh and um I bring you greetings
[49:43] from uh um Zambia. Our pastor, brother
[49:47] Ronica Pisha. Um some of you may know
[49:50] him. uh um that's who we are sitting
[49:53] under uh is our pastor and uh he says
[49:57] wherever you go uh make sure to greet
[50:00] the saints. Uh him and his dear wife
[50:02] sister Deborah um was just communicating
[50:06] with my wife that they are praying for
[50:08] us. So we thank uh we feel that warmth
[50:12] of the people and the whole Hebron
[50:14] tabernacle. uh our church is about uh uh
[50:18] quite a number now about 2,000 people
[50:20] and uh so we thank God that um uh the
[50:24] whole host is praying for us this
[50:27] morning and all the other sister
[50:30] churches.
[50:31] Um this morning I'm privileged to have
[50:34] uh with me my wife here, Sister Emma. Um
[50:38] she's been uh on my side uh year in and
[50:41] year out. uh we go doing miss missionary
[50:45] work together uh and and witnessing and
[50:48] and uh sometimes we've been in the
[50:51] markets uh and and distributing message
[50:54] books uh sometimes uh uh we we we've
[50:59] traveled within the country extensively
[51:01] uh Zambia and uh also outside the
[51:04] country Malawi, Zimbabwe, South Africa
[51:07] and uh the Lord has been gracious that
[51:09] we are together. Uh I was just telling
[51:12] some brothers I said uh uh we've been uh
[51:15] to places where uh fully uh infested
[51:20] with bed bugs on the on the bed and uh
[51:24] we have uh we've slept on beds that are
[51:27] uh sink in on the middle. Uh, one time I
[51:31] was at this place and I was preaching
[51:34] and uh that that that that room was
[51:38] infested with rats and uh and and this
[51:42] rat come and uh bit me on my uh right
[51:45] toe and blood oozing. I was very angry
[51:49] with that uh with that rat and uh but uh
[51:52] while I was looking for it, it had gone
[51:54] already.
[51:56] So we thank the Lord that uh she's by my
[51:59] side and and our last born junior there
[52:02] is with us and uh so we're thankful to
[52:05] the Lord. Um we uh I'll just ask you to
[52:09] stand. I just wanted to uh let these
[52:12] things out and uh just be here and um
[52:17] we're going to uh cruise for a little
[52:19] bit and uh just to encourage the people
[52:22] just by way of exhaltation
[52:25] and um we are not here to preach
[52:27] anything new. Uh we are just here to
[52:30] encourage you by the word of God. This
[52:33] message has come and uh it's irre
[52:36] irreplaceable.
[52:38] Nobody can replace this message of the
[52:41] hour. I've always said we don't need
[52:44] another messenger. We already have a
[52:47] message. We don't need another message.
[52:50] We already have the message of the hour
[52:52] with thus sayith the Lord. And no man,
[52:55] no message can replace this one. Because
[52:59] this is that which will bring to pass
[53:03] the tremendous victory in the love
[53:05] divine. This message uh carries with it
[53:09] that rapturing faith.
[53:12] 1 Corinthians chapter 2.
[53:16] I will zero in at verse 4.
[53:21] Amen.
[53:22] I love the Lord this morning. I sure
[53:25] enjoyed the song service. Where the
[53:27] spirit of God is, there is liberty.
[53:31] And uh so uh verse four of 1 Corinthians
[53:35] chapter 2 verse4
[53:38] and my speech and my preaching was not
[53:41] with enticing words of man's wisdom but
[53:44] in demonstration of the spirit and of
[53:47] power that your faith should not stand
[53:49] in the wisdom of men but in the power of
[53:53] God. How bet we speak wisdom among them
[53:56] that are perfect.
[53:59] Yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of
[54:02] the princes of this world that come to
[54:06] not. But we speak the wisdom of God in a
[54:09] mystery, even the hidden wisdom which
[54:13] God ordained before the world unto our
[54:17] glory.
[54:19] which one of the prince which none of
[54:22] the princes of this world knew. For had
[54:25] they known it, they would have not
[54:27] crucified the Lord of glory. But as it
[54:30] is written, I hath not seen nor ear
[54:33] heard, neither h have entered into the
[54:36] heart of man the things which God hath
[54:39] prepared for them that love him. But God
[54:42] hath revealed the them unto us by the by
[54:46] his spirit. For the spirit searchth all
[54:49] things, yeah, the deep things of God.
[54:53] For what man knoweth the things of a
[54:55] man, save the spirit of the man which is
[54:58] in him? Even so the things of God
[55:01] knoweth no man, but the spirit of God.
[55:04] Now we have received not the spirit of
[55:07] this world, but the spirit which is of
[55:09] God, that we might know the things that
[55:13] are freely given to us of God, which
[55:16] things also we speak, not in the words
[55:19] which man's wisdom teacheth, but which
[55:22] the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing
[55:25] spiritual things with spiritual.
[55:30] That's powerful.
[55:32] But the natural man receiveth not the
[55:34] things of the spirit of God, for they
[55:36] are foolish unto him, neither can he uh
[55:40] can can he known them uh because they
[55:43] are spiritually designed. But he that is
[55:46] spiritual judges all things, yet he
[55:48] himself is judged of no man. For who
[55:52] hath known the mind of the Lord, that he
[55:54] may instruct him? But we have the mind
[55:58] of Christ. Hallelujah.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add blessing to the reading
[56:03] of his word. Let's pray one more time.
[56:05] Dear Lord, we stand before you. Prayers
[56:08] has went forth. Lord, we have confessed
[56:11] our shortcomings.
[56:14] We have asked of the blood of Jesus
[56:16] Christ. The token has been applied. We
[56:19] know you are not just our judge, but you
[56:22] are also our lawyer. And we thank you
[56:25] this morning that our case has been
[56:28] already dismissed as the prophet would
[56:30] say it. So we come boldly before you
[56:33] Lord crying aba father help us this
[56:37] morning just a few words of
[56:39] encouragement lord this little just few
[56:42] little group of people but lord you
[56:45] preach to three people you preach to 12
[56:48] you preach to 5,000 number is not
[56:51] anything in your sight Lord it's the
[56:53] quality that you're looking for help us
[56:56] this morning Lord to receive thy word
[56:59] help me Lord as I humble myself before
[57:01] thee and before your people. Help me
[57:04] Lord with clarity of mind to bring this
[57:07] word of God, just the thoughts you have
[57:09] imprinted on my heart. May they be a
[57:11] blessing to us all. We ask that you
[57:13] bless the reading of thy word to our
[57:15] heart this morning. We ask that Lord you
[57:18] bless young and old alike and in
[57:20] between. We commit our our ourselves
[57:23] unto thee and commend this service into
[57:25] your hands in the name of our Lord Jesus
[57:28] Christ. Amen.
[57:30] Amen. We may take our seats this
[57:32] morning.
[57:34] I just want to uh touch on a little
[57:38] subject that I I I I felt uh to bring to
[57:42] your attention this morning. And uh and
[57:45] uh I'm sure we've come ready to receive
[57:49] of the word of God cuz uh where the
[57:52] carcass is, that's where you'll find the
[57:55] eagles. And eagles don't eat on dead
[57:58] dead food from yesterday. They eat of h
[58:03] fresh food and fresh mana of today.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; What was preached last Sunday, we are
[58:08] thankful for it. But we need more for
[58:11] this Sunday
[58:12] &gt;&gt; and more for next Sunday and more for
[58:14] next Wednesday. How many believe that to
[58:17] be the truth?
[58:18] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching on a little subject I've
[58:20] I've titled a perfect and special group
[58:23] of people.
[58:25] These are they
[58:27] a perfect and special group of people.
[58:31] These are they who are these people?
[58:34] These are the people that Paul is
[58:37] talking about here with the Corinthians
[58:40] that I came not with preaching of my own
[58:42] enticing words of wisdom. But I I came
[58:46] in demonstration of the of the of of the
[58:49] spirit and the power of the resurrection
[58:52] of Jesus Christ. May I uh encourage you
[58:56] this morning that the power of Jesus
[58:58] Christ is still the same yesterday,
[59:00] today and forever.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; This message will never be defeated by
[59:05] the enemy at any time, any hour, at any
[59:08] place, under any circumstances, this
[59:11] message will always win. I am here to
[59:14] encourage you that you are on the
[59:16] winning side this morning. You may have
[59:18] come gloomy and discouraged. But this
[59:21] word of God should be able to encourage
[59:24] you that you are a son. You are a
[59:26] daughter of the living God that you have
[59:28] passed on unto life.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Sons of the living God are led by the
[59:34] spirit of God. And Paul says, we know
[59:38] that we've passed from death unto life
[59:40] because the spirit of God himself bears
[59:43] witness with our spirit. You don't you
[59:46] don't have to have anybody tell you
[59:49] whether you're a true Christian or not.
[59:51] Your own spirit within you will tell you
[59:53] because that's what the Bible says.
[59:56] Beareth witness that you're a child of
[59:59] the living God. That you have passed
[1:00:01] from death unto life. That no matter the
[1:00:03] circumstances, you have already made it
[1:00:06] into glory. Because those that he
[1:00:09] forneew, he predestinated them.
[1:00:11] Hallelujah.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; And those that he predestinated, he
[1:00:14] justified. And those that he justified,
[1:00:17] he sanctified already. And those that he
[1:00:19] sanctified, he has already glorified.
[1:00:22] You are a glorified bunch of people this
[1:00:24] morning. May I say, and the devil can't
[1:00:28] do nothing about it.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Don't let the circumstances of yesterday
[1:00:32] define who you are, my brother. Rise up
[1:00:36] as a child of the living God. If you
[1:00:38] fell yesterday, rise up again. Dust
[1:00:40] yourself up and keep moving.
[1:00:44] Blessed be the name of the Lord this
[1:00:45] morning. You love the Lord this morning.
[1:00:48] I can see this group is on fire for the
[1:00:50] Lord already.
[1:00:54] Brother Brennham says, "Whatever you do,
[1:00:57] do it to the best of your ability. If
[1:00:59] you're a housewife, be the best
[1:01:01] housewife. If you're a preacher, be the
[1:01:04] best. And if you're a teacher, be the
[1:01:06] best teacher. My brother, my sister,
[1:01:09] whoever you are,
[1:01:11] whatever the Lord has given you, use it
[1:01:14] to the glory of God this morning.
[1:01:19] You love the Lord this morning.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; The enemy would like to tell you and
[1:01:23] whisper in your ear that no, you know
[1:01:26] what? You're always full of mistakes.
[1:01:27] You're always down. You're always down.
[1:01:29] Let me tell you, my brother, rise up.
[1:01:31] Speak back to the enemy. That's your
[1:01:33] mountain. The Bible says if you can
[1:01:36] speak to this mountain, that mountain
[1:01:39] being moved and be cast into the sea and
[1:01:42] you don't doubt in your heart, it shall
[1:01:45] happen.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Then the prophet qualifies it to say,
[1:01:48] even if it's one grain of sand,
[1:01:51] that starts to move. You are already on
[1:01:54] the victory side, my blood. That
[1:01:56] mountain has already started moving.
[1:01:58] What's your mountain this morning, my
[1:02:00] brother? speak it out of it and let the
[1:02:03] child of God move forward.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we like to glorify the devil
[1:02:11] too much.
[1:02:14] Sometimes we have people that are always
[1:02:17] complaining and murmuring.
[1:02:21] This year,
[1:02:23] brother Moses,
[1:02:25] this year my theme has been on this.
[1:02:29] Stop complaining and start claiming.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Claim that which is yours, my brother.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; If Satan has squatted or and somebody
[1:02:39] has squatted into your yard, you have
[1:02:41] the right to say, "Get off of my
[1:02:43] property."
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Right now, our children have been robbed
[1:02:49] by the devil. They've gone wayward.
[1:02:52] Right now, many of us are quite
[1:02:54] discouraged. Right now, many are
[1:02:56] starting to question this message of the
[1:02:58] hour. I'll tell you my brother, they are
[1:03:00] too late for me. As for me and my house,
[1:03:03] we shall serve the Lord.
[1:03:07] I was telling the church in Spruce
[1:03:09] Grove, I say they may take our Bibles.
[1:03:11] Time may come, they may take our Bibles,
[1:03:14] our message books, but they are too
[1:03:16] late, my brother, because we have become
[1:03:18] the true bride has become one with the
[1:03:20] message.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; We are not just part of it, we are all
[1:03:23] of it. Remember,
[1:03:27] we are the ones predestined
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; to actually receive this message.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; You have to have the ability to receive
[1:03:37] it. There's many people where you flash
[1:03:40] the message before them and they don't
[1:03:42] know nothing about it. But you and me,
[1:03:44] my brother, the Lord has given us the
[1:03:47] ability to actually believe it.
[1:03:52] I was watching not long ago, some time
[1:03:55] ago anyway, watching soccer. There was
[1:03:58] two teams that were, you know, in the
[1:04:00] professional league. And I was flipping
[1:04:02] through the channels in my hotel room
[1:04:05] and and and come to find out those two
[1:04:08] teams that were really high up there.
[1:04:11] And there there were two commented
[1:04:13] commentators that were talking and you
[1:04:16] know how they do before the team the
[1:04:18] team start playing and and they they
[1:04:21] they're examining both teams and the the
[1:04:24] the weaknesses and the strengths of each
[1:04:26] team and and the characters that are
[1:04:29] going to play in there and how they play
[1:04:31] together and and and I looked at them as
[1:04:35] I as they were talking. I I I waited a
[1:04:38] little bit and had them more. But
[1:04:40] there's one time that it caught my
[1:04:43] attention.
[1:04:45] This one commentator said about one
[1:04:48] team. He says, "The goodness with this
[1:04:50] team
[1:04:52] is that whether they play bad or they
[1:04:55] play good, they always win.
[1:05:01] Flip flip it spiritually speaking, my
[1:05:03] brother. What about you and me? We are
[1:05:05] on the winning side." The prophet says
[1:05:08] whether we are discouraged, it doesn't
[1:05:10] matter. We will rise up again. Whether
[1:05:12] the enemy strikes, it doesn't matter. We
[1:05:15] will rise up again. That's what I'm
[1:05:17] trying to encourage you this morning
[1:05:19] that you are not born of man. You are
[1:05:21] born of the spirit of God.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:05:27] Here's another example. In 2012, brother
[1:05:30] Mos we we Zambia went to the Africa Cup
[1:05:34] of Nations.
[1:05:36] And we're over there.
[1:05:38] We we went through the phases there, the
[1:05:42] the the the
[1:05:44] quarterfinals, the semifinals, all the
[1:05:47] way to the final.
[1:05:49] Where are we at this morning? We are
[1:05:51] right at the finality of things, my
[1:05:53] brother.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; We went all the way to the finals and we
[1:05:58] were playing Ivory Coast. And Ivory
[1:06:01] Coast is a team of giants.
[1:06:06] They're real big and most of them they
[1:06:08] play their their soccer in the European
[1:06:11] League in England.
[1:06:13] Zambia didn't have anybody
[1:06:16] that was playing in the Premier League
[1:06:18] at the time
[1:06:20] and they went to the finals with Ivory
[1:06:22] Coast and everybody everybody predicted
[1:06:26] that Ivory Coast would carry the day.
[1:06:32] Don't be discouraged by what people say
[1:06:34] about you.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Be encouraged by what God thinks about
[1:06:39] you. What God says about you, brothers.
[1:06:42] This what God says about you, my elder.
[1:06:45] You've passed through many dangers, tors
[1:06:47] and snares.
[1:06:50] It
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; is grace that has brought you this far.
[1:06:52] And grace will lead you home, my
[1:06:54] brother.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; And when we apply, they were playing.
[1:06:58] They started playing. We went back and
[1:07:00] forth, back and forth, back and forth
[1:07:03] all the way to the last minute.
[1:07:06] And Zambia
[1:07:08] scored the last winning goal.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; And all those giants walked out of
[1:07:15] there. When they walked into the
[1:07:17] stadium, they were like this. When they
[1:07:20] walked out of there, they were like
[1:07:22] this. Now,
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; David said, "The Lord is the lifter of
[1:07:26] my head.
[1:07:28] May he lift your head right now.
[1:07:30] Whatever the situation you are in,
[1:07:32] family, church, whatever at personal
[1:07:34] level, whatever is bothering you, may
[1:07:37] God whisper in your ear that you are
[1:07:39] still your his child this morning.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:07:47] So BBC and CNN
[1:07:51] they asked our captain, Zambian captain
[1:07:54] say, "How did you make it
[1:07:57] to fight these giants and win them?"
[1:08:03] And the captain said,
[1:08:06] "We talked about it in the locker room.
[1:08:09] We said, "Yeah, they are giants, but
[1:08:12] don't look at them.
[1:08:14] Look on the ball.
[1:08:17] If you look at them, you'll be very,
[1:08:19] very intimidated.
[1:08:21] Eyes on the ball. Eyes on the ball. What
[1:08:24] am I saying this morning? Eyes on the
[1:08:26] word of God. Eyes on this message. Don't
[1:08:29] look at that Goliath. He's so giant
[1:08:31] right now. But don't look at him. Look
[1:08:33] on the word of God.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Cuz the word will defeat the enemy at
[1:08:38] any time, any place under the any
[1:08:40] circumstances. May the Holy Ghost in
[1:08:43] your life begin to whisper that you are
[1:08:45] a winner, not a loser. And the only
[1:08:47] loser is the devil himself.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; You are actually free to say Satan go to
[1:08:54] hell.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Because hell was created for the devil
[1:08:58] and his angels. The Bible says,
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; A special and perfect group of people.
[1:09:06] How are you made perfect? We are not
[1:09:08] perfect on our own. But he that started
[1:09:11] the work in us through Jesus Christ is
[1:09:14] also able to finish it, my brother.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; I'm sure he's doing the finishing
[1:09:18] touches right now. He's horning and
[1:09:21] shaping us, my brother. Like that great
[1:09:23] sculpture that that that that like
[1:09:26] mangelo
[1:09:27] was. But a greater than Michelangelo is
[1:09:30] here this morning. That's our Lord Jesus
[1:09:33] Christ. He's the one who started the
[1:09:35] work in you. He will also finish it.
[1:09:38] Don't worry about the mistakes of
[1:09:40] yesterday. Don't let the setbacks of
[1:09:43] yesterday bring you down. Rather, use
[1:09:46] those setbacks
[1:09:47] as setups for comebacks and claim your
[1:09:51] victory in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:54] Christ this morning.
[1:09:56] This message will never lose its power
[1:09:58] to the true believer. When you apply it
[1:10:01] and you mean it in your heart, the Lord
[1:10:04] is duty bound to come for you, my
[1:10:06] brother.
[1:10:08] It's very true.
[1:10:11] People are wondering about healing.
[1:10:13] Healing. Brother Bram says healing is
[1:10:16] children's bread.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Then you hear a lot and it's okay. You
[1:10:23] hear a lot about physical healing.
[1:10:24] Physical healing. There's hardly
[1:10:26] anything that's brought for prayer for
[1:10:29] spiritual healing.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; How many people right now are suffering
[1:10:33] spiritually speaking? God help us in
[1:10:36] this hour that we are in that will be on
[1:10:39] fire for the Lord Jesus Christ. Not only
[1:10:42] physically but also spiritually
[1:10:43] speaking.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. We need
[1:10:48] people that would confess like Shanga of
[1:10:51] God and that that would say certain you
[1:10:54] have robbed me enough and enough is
[1:10:57] enough and I'm drawing a line here.
[1:11:00] Brother Gift, how do you know? Each time
[1:11:02] the devil reminds me of that diabetes
[1:11:05] that was killing me in 2007, but
[1:11:08] miraculously God healed me of that
[1:11:10] disease. But each time the devil
[1:11:12] whispers, each time I'm not feeling
[1:11:14] well, the devil said, "Oh, it's back." I
[1:11:16] say, "Satan, you are a bluff. By his
[1:11:19] stripes, I'm already healed."
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; The same God who healed you yesterday
[1:11:27] will heal you today. He'll heal you
[1:11:29] tomorrow.
[1:11:31] The same God that saved you, the prophet
[1:11:33] says he can't save you today and lose
[1:11:36] you tomorrow. No, my brother, you are
[1:11:38] locked in already.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; You are a special group of people. A
[1:11:42] perfect group of people. Because why? He
[1:11:45] that is in you is perfect
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; and is greater than he that's in the
[1:11:50] world this morning.
[1:11:52] Who are these people, my brother? It's a
[1:11:54] special group of people that were not
[1:11:57] born a buzzard. It's a special group of
[1:12:00] people that were not born a crow. It's a
[1:12:03] special group of people that were not
[1:12:05] born just a nominal church. This is a
[1:12:07] special group of people that we heard
[1:12:10] the cry of the papa ego that say come
[1:12:12] out of h my people.
[1:12:16] I was telling the church in Lusaka,
[1:12:19] nobody brought me in. No man brought me
[1:12:23] in. No man will take me out.
[1:12:26] This message you are not called by a
[1:12:28] man.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; This message you don't give each other
[1:12:31] revelation.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Revelation comes from almighty God. My
[1:12:35] brother
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; and no man can give each other
[1:12:38] revelation. The Bible says go into the
[1:12:41] world and preach the gospel.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; It didn't say give revelation. Just
[1:12:47] preach it and let the chips fall where
[1:12:49] they may. God himself will do the work
[1:12:52] from the inside and pushing out and
[1:12:54] giving you Zoe life
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; and overcoming power. Brother Gif, can I
[1:13:00] overcome there? This is a pro promise in
[1:13:02] the Bible. There's a group of people
[1:13:04] that have been predestined to overcome
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; in this hour that we are living in.
[1:13:11] You hear people talk about the dark ages
[1:13:15] and how it was son
[1:13:17] fed to lions
[1:13:20] thrown into the fires.
[1:13:23] If you read Fox book of matters,
[1:13:28] those people were going into there into
[1:13:32] the fires into the lions willingly.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; They had the anointing for that hour.
[1:13:39] We are not going to be fed to lions.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; No. Because this is another
[1:13:43] dispensation, my brother.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; And all those spirits from the first
[1:13:48] church age all the way to Laia have
[1:13:51] accumulated together. This is the most
[1:13:54] evil and treacherous
[1:13:57] church age that we are in.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; It's the most evil of all of them. It's
[1:14:02] the most deceitful of all of them. And
[1:14:05] people will wonder, "How did you make
[1:14:07] it?" Oh brother, by the grace of God, no
[1:14:11] matter how dark it is, there's a group
[1:14:13] of people that have been predestinated
[1:14:16] to withstand the chaos of this this this
[1:14:20] dispensation.
[1:14:23] We will crest every wave
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God, my brother. We will
[1:14:28] find ourselves on the other shore by the
[1:14:31] grace of God. Because why? It's not you
[1:14:34] and me that's holding on to him. It's
[1:14:37] him that's holding on to you, my
[1:14:38] brother.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; What am I looking at here? I'm looking
[1:14:47] at a bunch of people that are likened
[1:14:50] unto Davids
[1:14:53] that can slaughter that Goliath,
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; kill him, and chop his head off.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Why are we? We are serpent trumpers this
[1:15:02] morning. We are people that have been
[1:15:03] ordained
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; to put down Satan
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; and throw him where he belongs.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; We are overcomers because the Bible says
[1:15:13] Jesus Christ will have overcomers in
[1:15:16] this hour that we are living in.
[1:15:18] Somebody's not is going to overcome.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; We would say like brother Brennham say
[1:15:24] if somebody has higher faith than I
[1:15:27] have, I better step out of the way and
[1:15:30] let them go. Amen.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; We are not here to hinder each other.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you sister there. Every time
[1:15:38] you raise your hand, you are receiving
[1:15:41] answer from the living God. Every time
[1:15:43] you say amen, God is pleased with that
[1:15:46] because you're not saying amen to me.
[1:15:47] You're saying amen to the word of God.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Exposition of the seven churches.
[1:15:55] Brother Pam says of Jesus Christ that
[1:15:58] he's not only the word of God, but he's
[1:16:00] also the God of the word
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; and not only the God of the word, he's
[1:16:05] also the God of the amen. So your amens
[1:16:08] are unto him, my brother.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; I say amen to the word of God.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Because we are worshippers. That's what
[1:16:15] we were created for.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This morning,
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; I'm just enjoying myself here. Brother
[1:16:23] Mo, Brother Meno, Brother Zeke, I'm just
[1:16:26] enjoying myself here as a young preacher
[1:16:28] man. You know, I better expend my energy
[1:16:32] while I'm still young.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; You young people, serve the Lord with
[1:16:37] all your heart.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; This message is still real.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; It will give you the right job that you
[1:16:43] need. It will give you the right wife,
[1:16:46] the right husband. This message will
[1:16:48] give you will lift you up that people
[1:16:50] don't know what to do and Satan doesn't
[1:16:52] know what to do with you.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; The other day I had my tie on preparing
[1:17:00] to go to church
[1:17:03] and then the button here wouldn't
[1:17:05] wouldn't fit in. And usually my wife
[1:17:09] helps me when that happens.
[1:17:12] And uh sometimes she has uh kind of uh
[1:17:17] uh what you pinched me while trying to
[1:17:21] while trying to fix my partner
[1:17:24] and uh
[1:17:27] all of a sudden I went to the other
[1:17:29] room. I was looking for her to come help
[1:17:32] me.
[1:17:33] Then all of a sudden I was looking for
[1:17:36] my tie
[1:17:38] so for me to take to her so she can uh
[1:17:42] she can uh fix it for me. And I went to
[1:17:45] this room, no tie. Went to the bed, no
[1:17:49] tie. I couldn't where is my tie? I was
[1:17:52] getting frustrated.
[1:17:55] Come to find out I had my tie.
[1:17:59] I had it on.
[1:18:03] Young people, serve the Lord with all
[1:18:05] your heart.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; There may come time
[1:18:09] that you leave one room to go to the
[1:18:11] other room and forget what you went
[1:18:12] there for.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; There may come time there may come come
[1:18:17] time
[1:18:19] that you're looking for your phone and
[1:18:20] yet you're talking on your phone.
[1:18:23] There may come time that you're looking
[1:18:25] for your car keys and yet they're in
[1:18:27] your hands. So while you can serve the
[1:18:29] Lord,
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; I heard the prophet say this the other
[1:18:32] day. The prophet says it used to be time
[1:18:36] that I would just jump out of bed.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; But he says, "Now I've crossed 50.
[1:18:43] I have to examine
[1:18:45] my leg. Bring it out of bed one at a
[1:18:48] time. Is this working?"
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; All right. Yeah, that's working. How
[1:18:53] about the other one? Is it working?
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. What about my hand?
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; And then you carefully stepped out.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Wow. You are able to serve the Lord
[1:19:04] Jesus.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Serve him with all your heart. Testify
[1:19:08] to others. Tell him about how you came
[1:19:10] to the message. Tell him about how good
[1:19:13] this God that you serve is. That he's a
[1:19:15] God of glory and mighty in battle. He's
[1:19:18] a warrior this morning. That's our Lord
[1:19:21] Jesus Christ this morning. is more than
[1:19:23] able to hear your heart's cry.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; You parent maybe your children wayward.
[1:19:36] I know of a brother
[1:19:39] that his son had gone wayward.
[1:19:44] And this brother, this man,
[1:19:47] he went to prayer sincerely. He's a
[1:19:49] preacher. He's a pastor. and said,
[1:19:52] "Lord, in my loins,
[1:19:56] you didn't give me serpent seed.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; I claim my son."
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; And within a week, that son had come
[1:20:04] back crying like a baby. And today, he's
[1:20:07] a minister of this gospel of the hour.
[1:20:10] Our God is more than able to do it.
[1:20:15] I'm just coming back from Zuzu Malawi
[1:20:17] where I took six services in a row
[1:20:20] where in the northern part of Malawi
[1:20:22] there the pastor of that church
[1:20:26] begin to tell his testimony his son was
[1:20:30] always the last in school.
[1:20:33] Our God is God of knowledge and wisdom.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Ask and it shall be given. Don't just
[1:20:39] ask little. Ask abundantly. The Bible
[1:20:41] says
[1:20:44] But first of all, put him first.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Put him first. When you put him first,
[1:20:50] all other things will fall in line, my
[1:20:52] brother.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; And this pastor, each time over there,
[1:20:56] they read out who is number one and who
[1:21:00] is the last one. And everybody knows. So
[1:21:04] they would start reading the names and
[1:21:06] then they would say and the last one
[1:21:10] that boy
[1:21:12] what a humiliation
[1:21:15] that
[1:21:16] the pastor went to prayer the brother
[1:21:20] went to prayer he says Lord
[1:21:23] you didn't
[1:21:25] create my child to be a laughingstock
[1:21:29] in that school
[1:21:32] I didn't birth him so that he would be
[1:21:35] the laughingtock.
[1:21:37] You gave him to me. As the Bible says,
[1:21:41] you are not the tail,
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; you are the head.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; And he started pouring out his heart.
[1:21:49] Listen my brother, the God of William
[1:21:51] Brennham is still present today. The God
[1:21:54] of William Brham still answers prayer
[1:21:56] today. I don't care what the skeptics,
[1:21:59] what the critics say,
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; but I'll tell you when you are in real
[1:22:04] real need of a situation, our God will
[1:22:07] come through for you, my brother.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; He answers prayer even today.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; And the brother prayed say, "Lord,
[1:22:15] unlock,
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; unlock his head.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Twist it the other way around, Lord.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; He's still in that business. And the
[1:22:27] following term the boy who was lost
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; came tops.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; You see he's still the God of miracles.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Because where God is, there is miracles.
[1:22:40] Now I'm not saying look for miracles
[1:22:42] because you are the miracles yourself.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; You don't have to look for power. You
[1:22:47] have the power in you.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; You don't have to look for a church to
[1:22:51] say I need a church which is on fire.
[1:22:53] You be the fire yourself.
[1:22:57] Don't leave the church and say there's
[1:22:58] no Holy Ghost here. You be the Holy
[1:23:00] Ghost in the church.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; The hypocrites, you be the real one.
[1:23:04] Because every time there's a
[1:23:06] counterfeit, it means there's also a
[1:23:08] real one, my brother.
[1:23:12] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:23:15] And that boy was consistently topped.
[1:23:19] Today he's a doctor
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; in medicine
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; and performing brain surgery.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Our God is more than able to you hear
[1:23:31] your heart's cry. If something is to
[1:23:33] encourage you young people now maybe the
[1:23:35] elderly, maybe you may have a need of
[1:23:38] your own. But all I'm saying is that
[1:23:40] he's the God of all.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; He's the God of the young, the middle
[1:23:44] age is the God of the elderly. And our
[1:23:46] needs are different. So whatever your
[1:23:49] needs are, Jesus is a person of God.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Who are
[1:23:56] this
[1:23:57] special group of people.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Let me go back
[1:24:03] cuz there is a special group of people.
[1:24:07] These are there
[1:24:10] that God has put his eyes on.
[1:24:14] Even to the point Jesus Christ said not
[1:24:16] even a hair of your head will be lost.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; These are there my brother
[1:24:25] that belong to this special group of
[1:24:26] people a perfect group of people. These
[1:24:30] are they where healing is children's
[1:24:32] bread.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; These are they who are the oil and the
[1:24:37] wine of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:24:40] These are they who have been born again
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; with the spirit of God.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you my brother like
[1:24:47] Nicodemus said and Jesus we asked him
[1:24:50] asked Jesus Jesus answered unless you be
[1:24:53] born again.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; We arrive we have arrived in this hour
[1:24:57] now you must be full of the spirit of
[1:25:00] God if you have to go into heaven my
[1:25:02] brother.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; This is not a free ticket to everybody.
[1:25:06] It's only to those that are filled with
[1:25:08] the oil and the wine of the Lord Jesus
[1:25:10] Christ.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; God has no grandchildren. God has sons
[1:25:15] and daughters of God and only those that
[1:25:19] fulfill the part they were that are
[1:25:21] victorious in this age. These are the
[1:25:24] the they where victory belongs to them.
[1:25:27] You know,
[1:25:31] victory is not always like you're always
[1:25:35] winning.
[1:25:38] Sometimes we go down, but victory is to
[1:25:41] raise up again.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; And say, "Satan, you're a bluff." Yes,
[1:25:46] you took me down, but the Lord raised me
[1:25:48] up again.
[1:25:50] Victory is when you are discouraged
[1:25:54] and all of a sudden something sweep over
[1:25:57] your soul and say, "What am I murmuring
[1:25:59] and complaining about? I'm a child of
[1:26:02] the living God. Get thee behind me,
[1:26:04] Satan.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; There's victory."
[1:26:08] Victory is when a brother or sister or
[1:26:11] somebody out there, they're always
[1:26:14] poking at you
[1:26:16] and you get to a point where where
[1:26:19] you're so frustrated. Victory is to
[1:26:22] where you can say, "I forgive you
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; and I'm praying for you."
[1:26:30] Look at Elisha when those 42 troo kids
[1:26:33] there were making fun at them at him cuz
[1:26:37] he was baldheaded.
[1:26:41] Elisha got angry.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says that wasn't the
[1:26:48] anger of God. That was a prophet who was
[1:26:51] angry.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; K those children and bear came and
[1:26:55] killed them all.
[1:26:58] Fast forward it to this time
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; with the prophet of the hour
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; in front there when he was preaching
[1:27:07] sitting boy and girl and carrying on and
[1:27:10] kissing
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; right when the prophet was preaching
[1:27:16] and the angel of the Lord says whatever
[1:27:19] you say it shall happen
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; he tried to tell them stop what you're
[1:27:24] doing they wouldn't stop the angel of
[1:27:26] the Lord
[1:27:27] say say whatever if they have to be
[1:27:29] packed out of here dead they'll be
[1:27:31] packed out of here dead the prophet
[1:27:34] something overcame him came upon him and
[1:27:37] it was forgiveness and he pronounced I
[1:27:40] forgive you now that's overcoming my
[1:27:42] brother because this message is a
[1:27:44] message of grace it's a message of
[1:27:46] reconciliation it's a message of
[1:27:49] forgiveness if you can't forgive you
[1:27:51] will not be forgiven also
[1:27:56] That's what this message is about my
[1:27:58] brother. It has taught us that whatever
[1:28:00] the situation is, we can rise up again.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; These are they who would declare like
[1:28:07] Job would declare to say, I know you're
[1:28:10] making fun of me. I know you are mocking
[1:28:12] me. Even my wife, you want me to curse
[1:28:15] God so that he can kill me. He said, you
[1:28:18] speak like a w the foolish woman. He
[1:28:20] didn't say you are a foolish woman. He
[1:28:22] said, "You speak like a foolish woman.
[1:28:26] Come tell come time that you know God
[1:28:30] will never allow pressure on you that
[1:28:33] you can't withstand." The Bible says
[1:28:37] to some it just seems it's a roller
[1:28:39] coaster.
[1:28:40] It doesn't necessarily mean that they
[1:28:42] are sinners.
[1:28:45] Sometimes it's God wanting to show his
[1:28:48] power.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because if he allowed the
[1:28:51] same to another person, they may not
[1:28:54] handle it.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; God rich in mercy, my brother. He's
[1:28:59] still merciful. Like the Bible says, his
[1:29:02] mercies are new every day.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; So the Lord come up to Job at his last
[1:29:09] moment
[1:29:10] and lifted him up
[1:29:13] and gave him that vision.
[1:29:16] Where were you, Job?
[1:29:19] When the sons of God rejoiced, where
[1:29:22] were you when the start? He started
[1:29:25] asking those questions. Finally,
[1:29:28] finally, Job knew it was revealed who he
[1:29:31] is that he was in God's mind before the
[1:29:36] foundation of the world.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; And Job in boldness gathered all the
[1:29:42] critics. Let me tell you, it's time to
[1:29:45] shame the critics this hour that we are
[1:29:47] living in.
[1:29:49] Job gathered all of them and said, "Come
[1:29:51] over here. Let me tell you something.
[1:29:54] You've been laughing at me, but let me
[1:29:56] tell you something. I know my redeemer
[1:29:59] liveth."
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; These are they right now. I'm looking at
[1:30:02] them. That would declare that Jobs that
[1:30:05] although I am sick, but I know my
[1:30:07] redeemer liveth. Although I'm down, my
[1:30:09] redeemer liveth. That should be the
[1:30:11] confession of the believer.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; You ask people, "How are you feeling?"
[1:30:17] saying, "Oh, you know, I'm not feeling
[1:30:18] well. I'm not." We are glorifying the
[1:30:20] devil. We should confess like that
[1:30:22] Shunomite woman. All is well. That's the
[1:30:26] confession of a believer. How are you
[1:30:28] feeling today? All is well.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; She had her child dead from heat stroke.
[1:30:33] But she raised up to that prophet and
[1:30:35] say when he asked her, "Ah, is
[1:30:37] everything well with you?"
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; She said, "All is well."
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Ah, let me be let that be my confession.
[1:30:45] Regardless of how I'm down, regardless
[1:30:48] of my roller coasters, may I confess
[1:30:50] that Jesus is still faithful.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; We need in this hour
[1:30:58] a replica
[1:31:01] of the three Hebrew children.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Look at the boldness and their faith.
[1:31:09] Yeah.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; To that King Nebuchadnezzar
[1:31:13] had put up an image
[1:31:16] and had declared made a decree
[1:31:20] that everybody should worship the gods
[1:31:23] of Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:31:25] Those three children they refused.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; We are not going to bow down
[1:31:33] to that image and we are not going to
[1:31:36] worship those gods.
[1:31:38] How many gods do you think are here in
[1:31:40] this hour with over 200 million demons
[1:31:45] released
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; to bombard not only the young, the
[1:31:49] middleage and the elderly?
[1:31:52] We are all fighting the same devil.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; See the devil is so evil that even if
[1:31:59] you remove the D, he's still evil.
[1:32:08] That's how bad the devil is. The Bible
[1:32:10] says come to steal, kill, and destroy.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; But we will not be destroyed, my
[1:32:16] brother. We have passed from death unto
[1:32:18] life. We are the for overcomers of this
[1:32:20] hour. We are the ones that Jesus Christ
[1:32:23] himself described by the prophet of the
[1:32:26] hour. He says, "I don't call you church
[1:32:28] anymore. I call you Mrs. Jesus. I call
[1:32:31] you the bride of Jesus Christ." And here
[1:32:34] she's standing all over the world, even
[1:32:37] in the jungles of Africa.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; She's standing on her two feet without a
[1:32:42] headquarters, my brother. Because our
[1:32:44] headquarters is not here on earth.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Our headquarters is in heaven, my
[1:32:49] brother.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. God is
[1:32:54] no respector of man. God is respector of
[1:32:57] his own word, my brother. Those that are
[1:32:59] in him. Ah, who are these people?
[1:33:03] Resurrection belongs to them. Rapture is
[1:33:05] already lying in them already.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; You know we rapture is coming. Rapture
[1:33:12] is coming. Yes, it's coming. The little
[1:33:14] change of these bodies. But this word is
[1:33:17] already bringing rapture within us and
[1:33:20] rapture is lying within you and me.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; We have the fullness of the word. Now
[1:33:26] the other church ages, they only saw in
[1:33:28] part. But today we are looking at this
[1:33:30] word of God in the fullness of it.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Look what the seven seals have done.
[1:33:38] Opened the way for us. Even brother
[1:33:39] Brham says when those seals were opened
[1:33:42] the Bible became new to me.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; If it became new to him, it's new to us.
[1:33:47] My brother,
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; we know who has called us. We know where
[1:33:50] we are. We know where we are going.
[1:33:52] Amen.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; And if this morning somehow maybe you're
[1:33:57] disoriented a little bit like the
[1:34:00] northern uh the fishermen of northern
[1:34:02] England,
[1:34:04] they would go to the high seas to fish
[1:34:07] at night and sometimes
[1:34:10] the clouds would come
[1:34:14] and they would finish fishing and the
[1:34:16] clouds covering the skies. They didn't
[1:34:20] know where they were going. Sometimes
[1:34:23] they would get disoriented
[1:34:26] and start going the opposite direction.
[1:34:30] They would be singing songs like Jesus
[1:34:32] is the rock in a weary land, a shelter
[1:34:34] in the time of storm.
[1:34:38] And by and by the winds would come and
[1:34:41] blow
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; the clouds.
[1:34:46] Just because you see the sun doesn't
[1:34:48] mean the sun is not there.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; The sun is still there. It's still
[1:34:54] shining just as much.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Just because God dwells in a weak vessel
[1:35:00] doesn't mean God is weak.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; He's still God. He's still Jehovah Gyra.
[1:35:06] He's still the resurrection and the
[1:35:07] life. And he that cometh to him must
[1:35:11] know that he is God.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:15] He said, "I'm the resurrection and the
[1:35:17] life. He who believeth on me, though he
[1:35:20] were dead, yet shall he live. And
[1:35:21] whosoever liveth and believeth on me
[1:35:24] shall never die. Believest thou this?"
[1:35:26] We are believers of this hour. We are
[1:35:29] believers of this message.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; We've come from death unto life already.
[1:35:34] Blessed. That's I'm encouraging you
[1:35:35] today that you are that kind of people.
[1:35:38] You're that bunch of people. Don't you
[1:35:40] ever let anybody bring you down. Don't
[1:35:44] let even yourself bring you down.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Don't be like uh Paul of Romans 7
[1:35:53] complaining and murmuring about the
[1:35:54] flesh. But watch Paul in Romans 8 where
[1:35:58] he says there's therefore no more
[1:36:00] condemnation
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; to them that are in Christ Jesus. He
[1:36:05] realized it wasn't him. It was Jesus
[1:36:07] Christ. If the Lord doesn't pick you up,
[1:36:10] my brother, we are nothing.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's the one that knew us.
[1:36:17] Jeremiah 29 11 says, "I know the
[1:36:21] thoughts that I have for you."
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Thoughts of peace.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; When the devil comes to you and rob you
[1:36:28] of your peace, take it back. Take your
[1:36:31] peace back and say, "Devil, that's
[1:36:33] enough. I am claiming my peace in the
[1:36:35] name of the Lord Jesus Christ." And move
[1:36:37] forward.
[1:36:40] Moses was told, "Don't cry to me."
[1:36:45] See, the prophet is gone, but the pillar
[1:36:48] of fire is still there.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; He's still leading his children, my my
[1:36:52] brother, through the fires, through the
[1:36:54] hot waters, through thin ice. He's still
[1:36:56] leading his children, my brother.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Follow the leadership of the Holy
[1:37:01] Spirit.
[1:37:03] It would come time that God told Moses
[1:37:07] that Moses look at the pillar of fire
[1:37:10] and follow that pillar of fire and let
[1:37:13] the children of Israel follow you.
[1:37:21] He's still the same.
[1:37:23] I wish I could preach on the God of
[1:37:26] order.
[1:37:28] He has not changed. His order has to be
[1:37:32] followed
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; if we have to go to the other side. Even
[1:37:35] in church, the order has not changed.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; So here is the pillar of fire
[1:37:44] leading Moses and the children of Israel
[1:37:47] to a dead end.
[1:37:51] In front of them the Red Sea. Behind
[1:37:53] them the armies of Pharaoh. On one side
[1:37:56] high mountains, on the other side steep
[1:37:58] valleys. Nowhere to go. Sometimes you
[1:38:02] are found in those situations.
[1:38:04] Trust in the Lord.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Trust in the Lord. He's still the way
[1:38:08] maker today. He's still the chain
[1:38:10] breaker today.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The children of Israel were
[1:38:16] crying, "You've brought us here. So we
[1:38:18] die. We would rather have been where we
[1:38:20] were in Gan."
[1:38:24] Yeah.
[1:38:25] Goshan was in Egypt but Egypt wasn't in
[1:38:29] Goshan.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; We are in this world but we are not of
[1:38:34] this world my brother.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Always remember that.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; We are not of this world. We are in this
[1:38:41] world but we are not of this world.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Let them ride to the dead end. Moses
[1:38:46] cried and Lord said why cry? Speak.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; We have arrived in that hour.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; It's not coming. It's already here.
[1:38:54] Amen.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Speak the word of God and go forward. If
[1:38:58] you, the Bible says, not if me, if you,
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; said to this mountain,
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; the Lord has laid it in our lap. Now,
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; it's up to us. But don't use it
[1:39:09] foolishly like the prophet says, Lord, I
[1:39:11] want a tree created here. No, I want a
[1:39:13] No, we have that. But he's a God of
[1:39:15] order and principle.
[1:39:21] And Moses says when he got that
[1:39:23] revelation, oh brother, it pays to have
[1:39:26] revelation. If there's anything we need
[1:39:28] in this hour is revelation.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Rapture is going to be a revelation. And
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Moses declared to the children of Israel
[1:39:39] to say, "You, you see these Egyptians
[1:39:41] here, all these Egyptians with their
[1:39:45] chariots,
[1:39:46] the Egyptians that you see today, you
[1:39:48] will see them no more forever."
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; I can hear a parent say, I can hear a
[1:39:54] brother say, "These demons that have
[1:39:56] been bothering me, I will see them no
[1:39:59] more forever.
[1:40:01] These temptations that have been
[1:40:03] bothering me, I will see them no more
[1:40:05] forever. You declare that in the name of
[1:40:08] the Lord Jesus Christ and move forward.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; What's your Red Sea this morning? May it
[1:40:14] be parted?
[1:40:16] I was asking the church back home. I
[1:40:19] said, "What formula,
[1:40:22] those of you that have done physics,
[1:40:24] what formula did God put in place
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; to stay the water and build that wall of
[1:40:31] water and dry the ground?"
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; And what timing did he put in place so
[1:40:38] that every one of them were the children
[1:40:40] of Israel?
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Not only the people, but their
[1:40:44] belongings and their animals. Because
[1:40:46] Moses had said, "Not even a hoof will be
[1:40:50] left behind."
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; We're not leaving behind anybody. As the
[1:40:57] body of the Lord Jesus Christ, we are
[1:40:59] going, everybody that's predestined,
[1:41:01] we'll be there, my brother. So whether
[1:41:03] we hate each other or love each other,
[1:41:05] we will be there, my brother, together.
[1:41:09] We need grace one for another.
[1:41:12] Thy loving kindness is better than life.
[1:41:14] David said,
[1:41:17] "So, Roy, God, so I said,
[1:41:21] let's ask Uncle Google."
[1:41:25] So, I said,
[1:41:27] "Can you can we type on our phones
[1:41:32] what formula could God have used to stay
[1:41:35] the waters?"
[1:41:37] And Google said it is impossible
[1:41:42] to calculate this. That's the God that
[1:41:45] we worship. That's the God that we
[1:41:47] serve. Even Google can't do nothing
[1:41:50] about it. He's the God of almighty
[1:41:53] formula. He knows how he brought you in.
[1:41:56] He knows how where you were and how he
[1:41:59] would bring you in. We have come all we
[1:42:01] have come with different avenues of
[1:42:03] life. But God rich in mercy somehow work
[1:42:07] something out that we would meet like
[1:42:09] this here this morning.
[1:42:13] Who are these people? These are the
[1:42:15] people that have refused to bow down to
[1:42:18] the devices of the enemy. These are the
[1:42:21] people that have refused to bow down to
[1:42:24] social media. These are the people who
[1:42:26] that have re refused to gossip. These
[1:42:29] are the people. These are they that are
[1:42:31] standing upright by the by the mercy and
[1:42:34] grace of God. These are the people that
[1:42:37] have said like David, thy word have I
[1:42:40] hid in my heart that I will not sin
[1:42:42] against thee. These are they, oh blessed
[1:42:46] be the name of the Lord. These are they
[1:42:48] who would say like David, I was glad,
[1:42:50] very glad when they said to me, let us
[1:42:53] go to the house of the Lord. There will
[1:42:55] be singing, there will be shouting,
[1:42:57] there will be victory. Somebody is going
[1:42:59] to walk out of here victorious.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. You
[1:43:05] love the Lord this morning.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; These are they who would say like Job,
[1:43:08] the Lord has given and the Lord has
[1:43:10] taken. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:43:15] These are they who would declare like
[1:43:17] Joshua who said, "Choose ye this day
[1:43:20] whom you shall serve, but as for me and
[1:43:23] my house, we shall serve the Lord."
[1:43:28] These are they who would declare that in
[1:43:30] this day God sent a prophet
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; with a with a sure message. These are
[1:43:37] they that the Lord has said in
[1:43:40] Revelation 6:6, "A measure of wheat for
[1:43:44] a penny and three measures of bal for a
[1:43:47] penny, but of the oil and the wine,
[1:43:51] don't hurt them."
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Because why? These are mine. These are
[1:43:55] they. These are mine. Don't touch the
[1:43:57] oil. And who are the oil and the wine?
[1:43:59] I'm looking at them right now. You're
[1:44:01] filled with the oil of the Holy Ghost.
[1:44:03] And we are filled with the wine of God,
[1:44:06] which is the stimulation coming by
[1:44:08] revelation.
[1:44:10] That's you, my brother. Don't ever
[1:44:13] estimate yourself. You're child of the
[1:44:15] living God. You see, stop beating
[1:44:17] yourself about the mistakes of
[1:44:19] yesterday.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Because many times the devil comes to
[1:44:23] remind us.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, what about that?
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; What about this thought? You think
[1:44:28] you're a Christian? As long as we are in
[1:44:31] this flesh,
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; we'll make mistakes.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; But there's something that's redeemed,
[1:44:36] that's here, my brother, that will not
[1:44:38] make a mistake. That will confess that
[1:44:41] Jesus is Lord all the time.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:45] The redemption of this shall come as
[1:44:47] well in a moment, in a twinkling of an
[1:44:49] eye. It will come, my brother. These are
[1:44:52] they that have been predestined not to
[1:44:55] go to hell. You have the right to the
[1:44:59] tree of life.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Who is that tree of life? The Lord Jesus
[1:45:03] Christ himself.
[1:45:06] And when those fishermen would look,
[1:45:10] the winds would blow.
[1:45:12] They would look at one star. They would
[1:45:14] be looking for brother Brennham calls it
[1:45:16] the North Star.
[1:45:19] Every geographer,
[1:45:21] every GPS
[1:45:24] on your vehicle, on your ship, airplane,
[1:45:27] every GPS is tied
[1:45:31] to the North Star. It's the only star
[1:45:34] that doesn't revolve. Every other star
[1:45:37] revolves around the North Star.
[1:45:40] A greater than north star is here.
[1:45:43] That's our Lord Jesus Christ. When they
[1:45:45] would see the north star, they will find
[1:45:47] their way home. That's what we are doing
[1:45:50] this hour. That's what the word of God
[1:45:52] is doing. When we look at the North
[1:45:54] Star, Jesus Christ, we will find our way
[1:45:56] home. My brother, he's the way, the
[1:45:58] truth, and the life. Even today, this
[1:46:00] hour.
[1:46:02] Blessed be the name of the Lord. He's
[1:46:05] here to hear to our hearts cry. is here
[1:46:08] to say, "I died for you and for your
[1:46:11] sins, for your trouble, that hard
[1:46:14] trouble. He's more more than able to
[1:46:17] make and create a new one. He's still a
[1:46:19] creator."
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; If he can create things into existence,
[1:46:24] he can create things out of existence as
[1:46:26] well.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of a God that we are.
[1:46:31] God is limitless. You cannot limit God.
[1:46:34] Oh, no, no. God is limitless. And when
[1:46:37] God says something, he doesn't backpedal
[1:46:40] on it. He means what he says and he says
[1:46:42] what he means.
[1:46:44] These are they who believe the true word
[1:46:46] of God from cover to cover. These are
[1:46:49] they that even when they are rebuked,
[1:46:51] they will say, "Lord, be it unto me
[1:46:53] according to your will." These are they
[1:46:55] that they will take correction by the
[1:46:57] word of God. These are they that will
[1:47:00] walk and say, "Lord, help me walk right.
[1:47:03] Help me look right. Help me do right.
[1:47:06] help me act right. These are they that
[1:47:09] will confess and admit to their faults.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; You know there are people who don't want
[1:47:16] to who don't really they feel when they
[1:47:18] admit their mistakes they they feel like
[1:47:21] they are inferior.
[1:47:23] You are actually more powerful when you
[1:47:25] admit your mistakes and you're teaching
[1:47:27] somebody something. The Hebrew children
[1:47:31] they refused. Ah may we fashion at them.
[1:47:35] These are they that Daniel said in the
[1:47:37] last last days, they that know their God
[1:47:41] shall perform exploits.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; These are called believers. Believers of
[1:47:46] this word of the hour. Somebody's going
[1:47:49] to believe. Somebody's going to say a
[1:47:53] though none go with me yet I'll follow.
[1:47:57] Somebody is going to say like had it
[1:47:59] right to say this is even when you push
[1:48:03] play something deep calling to the deep
[1:48:07] something in you will agree and say this
[1:48:09] is nothing but the truth.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know how it's going to happen
[1:48:14] but it will happen.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; How is rapture going to happen? I don't
[1:48:17] know. That's not my business. That's his
[1:48:20] business my brother.
[1:48:21] Hallelujah.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; But I know he says he would have a bride
[1:48:25] without spot or wrinkle.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; I know that's what he said and I believe
[1:48:29] it.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; I know my redeemer liveth and I'll do
[1:48:32] like David says, "Satan, you come to me
[1:48:35] after your gods and and and with sword,
[1:48:38] but I'm coming to you in the name of the
[1:48:40] Lord, God of the armies of Israel."
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Let's go that way, my brother. You hear
[1:48:47] the phrase armed and dangerous. We
[1:48:49] should be that way to the devil, armed
[1:48:51] and dangerous. Satan, back off because a
[1:48:54] child of God is coming and passing
[1:48:57] through.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You of my black people,
[1:49:02] I was preaching back home. So much
[1:49:04] witchcraft over there, but over here
[1:49:07] witchcrafted is a stubborn spirit to the
[1:49:10] word of God. It's as good as leprosy.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; We need mellow hearts. Hearts that will
[1:49:16] say, "Lord, I believe." Amen.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; We're not to understand. We're called to
[1:49:22] believe it.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; And by and by, God will drop that
[1:49:25] revelation in our heart.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; What's witchcraft to you? What's wizard
[1:49:31] to you and me, my brother? What are
[1:49:33] those? What's a curse? That all there's
[1:49:35] a curse on our family. You hear so much
[1:49:37] of that back home.
[1:49:39] The curse remover is here.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; The overrider is here. He can override
[1:49:46] everything you have ever done in your
[1:49:48] life. Make you a new my brother, my
[1:49:50] sister. That's a kind of a God that we
[1:49:52] serve.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This morning,
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; oh, what you're suffering from is from
[1:49:58] your great great grandmother,
[1:50:00] great-grandfather.
[1:50:01] That's a bunch of nonsense.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; We don't belong to that family anymore.
[1:50:06] We belong to the family of the living
[1:50:08] God. The blood of Jesus Christ has
[1:50:11] encircled us. We are of another family.
[1:50:15] We are of another DNA. We are of another
[1:50:17] genes, my brother, that's laying in oil.
[1:50:20] The blood of Jesus Christ is flowing in
[1:50:22] your heart.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:50:28] Our God is more than able.
[1:50:32] You love the Lord this morning.
[1:50:35] It's good to be in the house of the
[1:50:37] Lord.
[1:50:39] These are the people
[1:50:41] that
[1:50:43] Jeremiah chapter 1 said, "Before I
[1:50:47] formed you, I
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; before I formed you in your mother's
[1:50:53] womb,
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; I knew you
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; and I ordained you to be a prophet."
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; What's the message to you and me, Sister
[1:51:03] Irene? Before I formed you in your
[1:51:05] mother's womb, I knew you would be a
[1:51:07] believer,
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; a believer of this urge, my brother,
[1:51:12] that when everything else with gross
[1:51:14] darkness all over us, there's still
[1:51:16] stars that are shining and giving the
[1:51:19] light to this dead world. My brother,
[1:51:22] one of these days, the bride will be
[1:51:25] taken out of here and to meet the Lord
[1:51:27] in the air and go to the marriage supper
[1:51:29] of the lamb. Then gross darkness, total
[1:51:32] darkness will engulf the earth. Watch
[1:51:34] the tribulation then. But I'm so glad
[1:51:36] the prophet of the hour. He wasn't just
[1:51:39] a messenger. He was a prophet messenger.
[1:51:42] But not only a prophet messenger, he was
[1:51:44] a sealer.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Somebody who would go into God's mind
[1:51:49] and pick out and tell us what happened
[1:51:51] in the Garden of Eden. Even not if it's
[1:51:53] not written in the in the in the Bible,
[1:51:58] he would go into the mind of God and
[1:52:00] actually tell us what actually happened
[1:52:02] to Abraham and Sarah.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; There is something with names. My
[1:52:09] brother, the prophet even says,
[1:52:13] "Who sinned?
[1:52:16] Who lied?
[1:52:19] Was it Abraham
[1:52:21] or Abraham?
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Who was a suppler, a liar, a shy star?
[1:52:32] Was it Israel or Jacob?
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; You can go down the line and down the
[1:52:39] line, down the line. The Bible says,
[1:52:41] brethren, it does not
[1:52:45] the way we are right now. That's not who
[1:52:48] we are
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; like in this flesh.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; We have another name.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; That God himself hasn't. One day he will
[1:52:58] call
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; and I will
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; and when your name is called, you shall
[1:53:03] know that it's you who is being called.
[1:53:05] Hallelujah.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; When he calls for brother Meno, I can't
[1:53:09] jump in there and say it's me. Only him
[1:53:12] will know.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; When he calls for me, only me will know.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; That's why our spirit bears witness with
[1:53:19] the spirit of God. We are children of
[1:53:22] the living God.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; It was Abraham who had Ishmael.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; But it was Abraham
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; who had Isaac.
[1:53:34] I'm sure if these two boys would go to
[1:53:37] school, one of them they asked their
[1:53:39] names would say, "I am
[1:53:41] Ishmael Abraham."
[1:53:45] And Isaac would say, "I am Isaac
[1:53:47] Abraham."
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; What a difference in name.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; And that's why whatever we do, the Bible
[1:53:54] says, do it in the name of the Lord
[1:53:57] Jesus Christ.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Don't use any other names. That name has
[1:54:02] power. Power to save, power to redeem,
[1:54:04] power to heal, power to make a way for
[1:54:07] you and for me.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Gift,
[1:54:12] I seem to be encouraged. And two days
[1:54:14] later, I'm down again back and forth.
[1:54:17] It's a cycle.
[1:54:19] Jesus Christ is a cycle breaker, my
[1:54:22] brother.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; He'll break that cycle in his own name
[1:54:26] because his name is above all names. and
[1:54:29] every tongue shall confess that he is
[1:54:32] Lord.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my believers now this ah let me just
[1:54:38] leave you with this I like as a
[1:54:41] preacherman I like to filter my thoughts
[1:54:45] with with what the messenger of the hour
[1:54:47] has said.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Then when I'm preaching to the people I
[1:54:51] am very confident I am on firm ground
[1:54:54] and I know what I'm preaching is exactly
[1:54:56] what the prophet preaches.
[1:55:02] exposition of the seven churches.
[1:55:05] You know, this one doesn't have
[1:55:07] paragraphs,
[1:55:10] but if you can type it, you can type it
[1:55:13] where
[1:55:14] he zeros in on putting these verses
[1:55:17] together, we see that there is only one
[1:55:21] group of people,
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; a blessed group of people.
[1:55:29] a special group of people,
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; a perfect group of people
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; because he is perfect.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; I've always said our Lord Jesus is the
[1:55:41] greatest project manager.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; If they ask you who are you, you said
[1:55:47] I'm a project of Jesus
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; and a project, he doesn't run out of
[1:55:53] resources.
[1:55:55] No, he will use the same resources to
[1:55:58] make because he's the porter we are
[1:56:00] declare. He doesn't discard us. He just
[1:56:03] changes our appetite, the way we think,
[1:56:05] what we eat. Spiritually speaking,
[1:56:07] that's what he does. And that's what
[1:56:10] this message has done in our lives. One
[1:56:12] of these days, my brother, my sister, we
[1:56:14] shall begin to lose gravitation.
[1:56:17] Somebody is going to walk out of this
[1:56:20] earth. Somebody's going to be changed in
[1:56:23] a moment, in a twinkling of an eye.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; From this pedest house
[1:56:29] into a glorified body.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; We believe that with all our heart.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says this, putting
[1:56:36] these verses together, we see that
[1:56:38] there's only one group of people and
[1:56:41] that a very special group of people.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; That's why I got my title this morning.
[1:56:48] A very not just a special group of
[1:56:50] people, a very special group of people
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; who are able to hear what the spirit
[1:56:57] says in each age.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Look at their ability. If somebody would
[1:57:04] walk out of here in into here from the
[1:57:06] denominational outfit, it would choke
[1:57:09] them to death.
[1:57:12] And if we also went there with what we
[1:57:14] know now and we sit there and listen to
[1:57:17] the way they preach, it'll choke us to
[1:57:19] death as well.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; This is where we belong.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; It's like my testimony of coming to the
[1:57:26] Lord Jesus Christ. When this man had
[1:57:28] testified, this brother testified,
[1:57:30] invited me to his home,
[1:57:33] he said, "Come and see."
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; That's a good one. When I say then say
[1:57:38] come and see, John went and pipped. But
[1:57:41] he was told to seal up the book. It's
[1:57:44] not for your time. It's not for your
[1:57:45] time. Because a special envoy,
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; a special ambassador,
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; a special alazar
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; would come our way to reveal the seven
[1:57:58] seals. Daniel wanted to reveal them.
[1:58:01] Paul wanted, John wanted, but they were
[1:58:03] told shall seal off the book cuz one was
[1:58:06] to come that God had ordained for this
[1:58:09] hour.
[1:58:12] When I went to that house that day, left
[1:58:15] my church, the United Church, I was the
[1:58:18] choir director there, and something kept
[1:58:20] saying, "Go that way. Go to that man's
[1:58:23] house." I went there. I found him
[1:58:26] preaching hard to his wife and
[1:58:29] two-year-old boy.
[1:58:32] And I said, "Wait a minute. This is the
[1:58:36] church."
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Few times I wanted to get out and get
[1:58:42] out.
[1:58:45] But brother, when the grace of God is
[1:58:47] upon you.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; See, the grace is what
[1:58:54] it puts us in.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Mercy is what keeps us in. Without the
[1:59:00] mercy of God, we wouldn't be here this
[1:59:02] morning.
[1:59:04] I went there.
[1:59:08] I I want to leave and something
[1:59:10] something would say, "Sit down."
[1:59:13] When the service was over,
[1:59:16] not an audible voice, but that still
[1:59:19] small voice said to me, "This is where
[1:59:23] you belong."
[1:59:25] And from that time, I've never looked
[1:59:28] back.
[1:59:29] This is the message, the truth.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; No man would pull you in, my brother,
[1:59:36] except God himself. All that my father
[1:59:39] has given me will come.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; And no one will pluck them out of my
[1:59:43] hand cuz their names are engraved in my
[1:59:46] palm.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Here we are, this hour that we are
[1:59:51] living.
[1:59:52] God rich in mercy.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how low you've sunk.
[1:59:59] He'll pull you out. Hallelujah.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how far you've gone,
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; he'll draw you back in.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; If there seed in there, if the seed of
[2:00:08] God is in there, he'll never leave you
[2:00:11] nor forsake you. He'll be with you, even
[2:00:13] with you to the end of the world. He
[2:00:14] says,
[2:00:17] "Bif, I made a lot of mistakes.
[2:00:19] Everybody else,
[2:00:22] but it's God who keeps us in, my
[2:00:23] brother."
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Listen what he says.
[2:00:28] A very special group of people who are
[2:00:31] able to hear what the spirit says in
[2:00:34] each age. It is one special group that
[2:00:38] receives the revelation for each age.
[2:00:41] That group is of God. Because the group
[2:00:45] that cannot hear is not of God. The
[2:00:49] group and he says John chapter 8 42-44.
[2:00:53] The group that can and does hear what
[2:00:57] the spirit is saying and receives the
[2:01:00] revelation thereof is that group
[2:01:03] described in 1 Corinthians chapter 2
[2:01:07] 6-16. That's what we read. They are the
[2:01:11] ones who have the spirit of God.
[2:01:14] They are the ones that are born of God.
[2:01:18] They are baptized into the body of the
[2:01:21] Lord Jesus Christ by his spirit.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; They are baptized with the Holy Ghost
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; to further bring out what we have just
[2:01:28] said and to also use a scripture that
[2:01:31] should be born in mind as well as we
[2:01:34] talk about who it is that is baptized
[2:01:37] with the Holy Ghost. See what Jesus says
[2:01:40] in John 6:45.
[2:01:42] It is written in the prophet,
[2:01:46] "And they shall all be taught of God,
[2:01:49] but turn to Isaiah 54:13
[2:01:53] when this is taken." And it reads, "And
[2:01:56] all thy children shall be taught of the
[2:01:59] Lord."
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; The all of God are the children of God.
[2:02:03] Amen.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Thus it is that the evidence of being a
[2:02:07] true child of God. He whom the spirit
[2:02:10] has come upon and indwells is again set
[2:02:13] forth as one taught by the word by the
[2:02:16] Holy Ghost.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; We have arrived.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Taught by the Bible led by the spirit.
[2:02:23] The song says that's who we are looking
[2:02:26] at here. Brother, sister, if they not
[2:02:29] meet again, stay with the message of the
[2:02:31] hour. Stay with us, say the Lord. It
[2:02:35] will reach you home, my brother. It will
[2:02:37] take you home. It will give you strength
[2:02:39] during your trials and tribulations. It
[2:02:42] will whisper to your ear that you are a
[2:02:45] child of the living God. It will confirm
[2:02:47] with your spirit that no matter what
[2:02:49] you're going through, you are still a
[2:02:51] child of the living God. Who are these
[2:02:53] people? These are they a special group
[2:02:56] of people. a people that have been
[2:02:58] handpicked,
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; chosen by God himself
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; from eternity. And now we know where we
[2:03:07] are going. We're going back to eternity.
[2:03:08] My brother,
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; brother Brennham says God had to
[2:03:12] slaughter us in. He says a hickey of
[2:03:15] time, just a little time frame for man
[2:03:18] to be there and to receive this word and
[2:03:21] for church urges to to be ushered in and
[2:03:25] show the power of the living God that no
[2:03:27] matter how the caterpillar, how the
[2:03:29] conquer worm, how the h locus,
[2:03:32] everything, how they add up that crop,
[2:03:35] it's still raised up again. And today
[2:03:38] she's on her two feet. She has matured.
[2:03:40] She's ready for the Ghana. Amen.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; We're just ripening now,
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; being turned back and forth by the word
[2:03:49] of God. Turn this way, turn that way,
[2:03:52] receive sun, the s to ripen further, to
[2:03:56] bring the moisture levels to be at the
[2:03:58] right time. So, we can't put the a a
[2:04:02] grain that hasn't arrived or reach the
[2:04:04] moisture content that God wants. It
[2:04:07] can't go into the Ghana. It has to be
[2:04:10] harvested at the right time. And that
[2:04:12] time soon and very soon like that song
[2:04:14] that has been sang that time is coming
[2:04:17] soon my brother.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Better stay in line. We better know
[2:04:22] where we stand with this word. We better
[2:04:25] say let like the Bible says let the weak
[2:04:28] say there I am strong. Let the sick say
[2:04:31] I am healed. Let the downtrodden say I'm
[2:04:34] cheerful now. Because why? The word has
[2:04:37] been dropped in my heart. That's the
[2:04:40] word of God. That's a word of a blessed
[2:04:42] assurance. Don't worry about the
[2:04:44] undertaker. Don't worry about what's
[2:04:46] going to happen to you tomorrow. Worry
[2:04:48] about the upper taker, the one that's
[2:04:50] going to raise you from the dead.
[2:04:52] Because the Bible says if this earthly
[2:04:54] tabernacle be dissolved, there is
[2:04:56] already another one waiting for me. My
[2:04:58] brother,
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; you don't have to worry. You step out of
[2:05:02] this one, you step into the other one
[2:05:04] right away in a moment. Our God is more
[2:05:07] than able. Look at what happened to the
[2:05:10] three Hebrew children.
[2:05:13] Brother Benham begins to dramatize.
[2:05:16] Bedigo maybe said, "Mish, you are the
[2:05:18] one in front." Cuz they're walking them
[2:05:20] franken and in line like that.
[2:05:25] Are we ready?
[2:05:28] That's a question I can ask myself.
[2:05:29] Gift, are you ready? And each one of you
[2:05:31] can ask yourself. And Mishk says, "I am
[2:05:34] ready."
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; That's a confession of a believer. If
[2:05:38] the Lord is ready, I am ready.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the three Hebrew children,
[2:05:46] we're going into the fiery furnace. We
[2:05:49] all have fiery furnaces in our lives.
[2:05:54] And Gabrielle
[2:05:57] rises up, goes to the throne, said,
[2:06:00] "Lord, have you seen what they doing to
[2:06:01] your children?"
[2:06:03] And God, the Lord said, "Yes, I've
[2:06:06] sinned, but the anchor holds."
[2:06:10] They are of that kind of material
[2:06:12] that will withstand the fire.
[2:06:18] Wood said, "You know, you sent me in
[2:06:22] anti- Deluvian church, Noah's time, and
[2:06:25] I flooded the whole thing. Why don't I
[2:06:28] go and flood that whole furnace?"
[2:06:32] God said no.
[2:06:34] Remember in the scripture when they
[2:06:37] brought those three boys,
[2:06:39] Nebuchadnezzar asked them, "Is it true
[2:06:43] that you won't bow and you won't worship
[2:06:47] the the gods?" And they said, "It's
[2:06:50] true. We will not bow." I can hear
[2:06:53] somebody here saying, "I will not bow to
[2:06:56] the devices of the enemy.
[2:07:00] and he got angry.
[2:07:02] See, that's where the devil is. Always
[2:07:04] angry.
[2:07:07] I'm winding down now. They got there and
[2:07:12] he begins to declare. Nebuchadnezzar
[2:07:14] says, "Who is that God
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; that will deliver you from my hand?"
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Who is that angel?"
[2:07:24] He didn't say, "Who is that Gabriel? Who
[2:07:26] is that wmud?"
[2:07:28] He didn't just say he didn't say who is
[2:07:30] that serum or cherbam. He says who is
[2:07:34] that God?
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; The challenge was to God himself.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; And God said the challenge is not to you
[2:07:41] Gabriel. It's not to you angel or
[2:07:44] anybody else. The challenge is to me. So
[2:07:46] devil bring it on.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Gathered up the four winds northwest,
[2:07:52] southeast.
[2:07:55] Brother Brenham say God climbed the
[2:07:57] rampant of glory right into the eternal
[2:08:00] garden
[2:08:02] plucked a palm leaf
[2:08:06] ordered the winds say you drive me right
[2:08:09] back to earth into that fiery furnace.
[2:08:14] Brother Brandham says God zigzagged
[2:08:16] through eternity all the way and before
[2:08:19] they threw those three children
[2:08:22] God was already there. Brother Barham
[2:08:25] says he was using the same palm leaf to
[2:08:27] fan off the heat. May I say this? May
[2:08:30] God fan off the heat in your life. May
[2:08:33] God give you air conditioning in your
[2:08:35] life.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; By the time those three children were
[2:08:40] thrown into there, yes, the fire was
[2:08:43] there, but it was nice and cool
[2:08:46] where they were. It was nice and cool.
[2:08:49] What about the children of Israel? After
[2:08:51] they crossed the Red Sea and and and and
[2:08:54] Miriam took the tambourine, started
[2:08:56] playing. All the sisters joined in. They
[2:08:59] were happy. They walked for 3 days and
[2:09:02] they were thirsty. There was no water.
[2:09:07] They started murmuring to Moses and
[2:09:09] crying to Moses. Finally, they found a
[2:09:12] body of water.
[2:09:15] They tried to drink and the water was so
[2:09:17] bitter they couldn't drink it.
[2:09:21] Sometimes we go through those stages in
[2:09:23] our lives.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; And those waters were bitter. We were
[2:09:28] crying to Moses. Moses cried to God and
[2:09:30] God said, "Moses, come up. Come over
[2:09:33] here. Come over." When God wants to deal
[2:09:35] with you, he deals with you as an
[2:09:37] individual. He's an individual God.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; We are here as a group, but we are
[2:09:42] individuals, my brother. Each one we
[2:09:45] have to fight
[2:09:48] for what belongs to us
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; with fear and trembling.
[2:09:54] Took him aside said look that tree there
[2:09:56] out of all the trees there was only one
[2:09:59] tree
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; that would give life.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; There's only one tree that that eternal
[2:10:05] tree that will give life.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Cut down that tree. Throw it into the
[2:10:11] water. And they did. I assume it it's
[2:10:14] Moses that took the first gulp of drink
[2:10:18] and the waters were sweet. The waters of
[2:10:21] Mara. May God sweeten that problem. May
[2:10:25] he turn that sickness into health. May
[2:10:28] he turn that trouble into a testimony
[2:10:31] that we are going to give as an
[2:10:32] overcomer.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; How many would say amen to that?
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Let's rise to our feet this morning.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. May he
[2:10:42] sweeten your waters of mara this morning
[2:10:45] because why? You are a special group of
[2:10:47] people. You are a predestinated group of
[2:10:50] people. A royal priesthood. A city
[2:10:53] that's put on a on a hill. A city that
[2:10:57] you are worthy to see. New Jerusalem. I
[2:11:01] can almost see the lights of that city.
[2:11:05] They're there. It's a real city.
[2:11:09] John saw it. And John saw you and me in
[2:11:12] that city. You have to believe you're
[2:11:15] part of it. They asked brother Brennham,
[2:11:17] "How do you know you're going to make
[2:11:18] it?"
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I have to believe that
[2:11:22] I'll make it. You have to believe. I
[2:11:24] have to believe that we are seeds of the
[2:11:27] living God. We come from God. We're
[2:11:29] going to God. We are marching to Zion."
[2:11:33] Amen. I believe that's where we're going
[2:11:35] this morning.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; We are m Maring
[2:11:42] to Zion.
[2:11:44] Oh, beautiful, beautiful Zion.
[2:11:49] We are maring up to Zion Zion, that
[2:11:55] beautiful city of God.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, we are maring.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; We are maring to Zion.
[2:12:04] Oh, beautiful
[2:12:07] [Music]
[2:12:11] king of
[2:12:13] zillord
[2:12:18] [Music]
[2:12:25] and let our joys be known.
[2:12:30] Join in a song with sweet accord
[2:12:36] in a song with sweet accord and just
[2:12:41] surround
[2:12:43] the throne and thus surround the throne.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; We're marching
[2:12:52] to Zion. Zion,
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; beautiful, beautiful Zion.
[2:13:00] We're marching upward to Zion,
[2:13:05] that beautiful city of God.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; We used to sing who never knew our God.
[2:13:19] But children of the heavenly king, but
[2:13:25] children of the heavenly king may speak
[2:13:31] their joys above. They speak their joys
[2:13:37] abroad.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; We're maring.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; We're maring
[2:13:42] to Zion.
[2:13:45] Beautiful. Beautiful Zion.
[2:13:49] We're maring upward to Zion. Zion,
[2:13:54] that beautiful city of God.
[2:13:59] The hill of Zion yields a thousand
[2:14:05] sacred sweets.
[2:14:08] Before we reach the heavenly field.
[2:14:14] Before we reach the heavenly fields. Oh,
[2:14:19] walk the golden streets. Oh, walk the
[2:14:25] golden street.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; We're maring
[2:14:30] to Zion.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Zion. The beautiful, beautiful Zion.
[2:14:36] Zion.
[2:14:38] We're maring upward to Zion,
[2:14:43] that beautiful city of God. And let our
[2:14:47] song let our songs abound and every tear
[2:14:55] be dry.
[2:14:57] We're marching through Emmanuel's
[2:15:01] ground. We're marching through
[2:15:05] Emmanuel's ground to fairer
[2:15:10] worlds on high to fairer worlds on high
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; we're maring
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; we're maring
[2:15:19] to Zion
[2:15:21] Zion
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; beautiful beautiful Zion
[2:15:26] we're maring upward to Zion
[2:15:31] That beautiful city of God.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; One more time. We're maring
[2:15:38] to Zion.
[2:15:41] Beautiful. Beautiful Zion.
[2:15:46] We're marching upward to Zion,
[2:15:50] that beautiful city of God.
[2:15:55] Let's give a hand to the Lord this this
[2:15:58] afternoon. We thank God for his word.
[2:16:00] Praise be to his name.
[2:16:03] Glory to his name. Wonderful message.
[2:16:07] How many are happy in the Lord? Thank
[2:16:09] God for the word of God this morning.
[2:16:12] Praise be to God. Thank you, brother
[2:16:14] Gift. God bless you richly for yielding
[2:16:16] this morning. It was just wonderful,
[2:16:19] wonderful to hear the word of
[2:16:21] encouragement to see oursel to see what
[2:16:24] God think of us. How God sees us. Amen.
[2:16:28] Special group, special people. Amen.
[2:16:31] Sometimes we don't feel like we are
[2:16:32] special but in God's eyes we are very
[2:16:35] very special. Only the message of the
[2:16:38] hour can tell us you know we can't God
[2:16:40] can't live without us.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; It feels a little bold bold to a bold
[2:16:44] saying but only the messenger can say
[2:16:47] such things such statement God can't
[2:16:49] live without us.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; We cannot perish as God can never perish
[2:16:55] because we are very special in God's
[2:16:57] eyes. You know, sometimes we feel like
[2:16:59] Gideon. No, you are a man of valor.
[2:17:02] Really? Me? Me? Look what I did
[2:17:05] yesterday. You know what I did

[2:23:41] Amen. Amen.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord this morning?
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; You may if you came maybe a little bit a
[2:23:49] bit low on the low side, but after after
[2:23:52] such a great message, you just feel, oh,
[2:23:54] you know, I can face anything now
[2:23:57] because God has recharged me. Amen. And
[2:24:00] knowing that I'm I'm the David of today.
[2:24:02] I'm the Shamga of today. I'm the true
[2:24:05] Hebrews children of today. I'm Joshua of
[2:24:09] today. I'm Caleb of today. Give me my
[2:24:12] mountain. No matter how the giant is
[2:24:14] this mountain belongs to me.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Just want to read one
[2:24:20] scripture as he was reading. Says don't
[2:24:22] look at don't don't don't
[2:24:24] complain. Start start claiming. You know
[2:24:27] sometimes we complain we look at the
[2:24:29] situation we look at this. We look at
[2:24:30] this. No. Don't look at those situation.
[2:24:33] Keep your eyes on the ball. Keep your
[2:24:35] eyes on the word of God. That's where
[2:24:38] your victory is. Don't look at Romans 7.
[2:24:41] Romans 7 is our flesh and the ups and
[2:24:43] down, but Romans 8 is the inside. And
[2:24:47] let's read Romans 8 once again. You know
[2:24:49] the scripture, but just want to let
[2:24:53] read it once again. Romans 8:33. Who
[2:24:57] shall lay anything to the charge of
[2:24:58] God's elect? Think about it. It is God
[2:25:02] that justifith. Who is he that
[2:25:05] condemnth? It is Christ that died here
[2:25:07] rather that is risen again. Who is even
[2:25:10] at the right hand of God who also make
[2:25:13] intercession for us? Amen. Put yourself
[2:25:16] for you. He's making intercession for
[2:25:18] you. Who shall separate us from the love
[2:25:21] of God? Who can separate you from the
[2:25:24] love of God? Amen.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; Shall tribulation mean tribulation will
[2:25:29] come? shall distress distress will come.
[2:25:33] Persecution, famine, nakedness, peril,
[2:25:37] sword, those things may come. Amen. As
[2:25:40] it is written, for thy sake we are
[2:25:42] killed all the day long. We are
[2:25:43] accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
[2:25:45] But nay, in all these things, in all
[2:25:49] these things there, though they might
[2:25:51] come, we are more than conqueror through
[2:25:54] him that loved us.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; We didn't even love him first. He's the
[2:26:00] first who loved us. Because he loved us,
[2:26:03] we know we are going to overcome him
[2:26:05] because his love can never change. For I
[2:26:08] am persuaded that neither death, neither
[2:26:10] nor life, angel or principalities, nor
[2:26:13] powers, nor things present, nor things
[2:26:15] to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any
[2:26:18] creature shall be able to separate me,
[2:26:22] separate you from the love of God which
[2:26:26] is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Praise be
[2:26:30] to God.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to his name.
[2:26:35] His banner over me is his love. And I'm
[2:26:38] going to invite brother Mano since you
[2:26:40] are here if you can close for the
[2:26:41] service for us and make a little bit
[2:26:43] comment of the elect lady. I like the
[2:26:46] way you always say the elect lady.
[2:26:50] Amen.
