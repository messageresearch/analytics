Thank you to be in the house of the Lord again this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. It has been a wonderful, wonderful weekend. Wonderful weekend &gt;&gt; from yesterday, this morning. Oh, the Lord has again something in store for us &gt;&gt; this evening. &gt;&gt; We have been blessed. I hope we don't leave it just in church. &gt;&gt; I hope we bring it home. Amen. What we learn, we apply it. We ask the Lord &gt;&gt; to make it life, man. To change our heart. What we heard, maybe we can't do it on our own abilities, but we ask constantly, Lord, I want to match what the word of God has taught me. Things that I have put aside, maybe I've neglected it, but now you have unveiled it. Lord, help me. help me to get to that maturity of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Steve, for coming all the way from Quebec. But God knows and discerns the thought and the intent of the heart. He visited our houses. He knows our addresses. He he picked things that we were doing there and he brought it in the surface. We remember the rules not to criticize one another but ourself personally. &gt;&gt; My life has been exposed. &gt;&gt; And I thank God that it has been exposed. &gt;&gt; So I can identify where I can change personally myself. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Thank you for the visitors. I came here. Thank you for for pastor. God bless you and um uh visiting us and is a family that is a pastor. Thank God that they came papa zed calling papa zed. Thank for honoring the invite and coming and god bless you richly and and mama good and visitors good friends Brent and brother Jeff and others and and another my friend. God bless you all and come name all of you and God bless you and love you. Thank you very much for coming and just want to invite the word of God right away. Brother Steve just let you as as we go to the word of God. God bless you richly. I have the liberty and then and God lead you. Heavenly father I appreciate you just as we invite the word. Heavenly Father, Father, I appreciate God bless you. &gt;&gt; You, I love you. Adore you. I bow down before you, heavenly father. I appreciate you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Greetings again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good to see you again. &gt;&gt; Again, in the house of the Lord, I think we had a a good meal this afternoon. I want to thank all the sisters, whoever participated. We had a special barbecue specialist. And so he had to be It was so smoky. I heard that he had to be replaced at one point because he had too too much smoke in the eyes. And so he had to had to take a break there. Like I'm not crying. I'm okay. I'm okay. Amen. Lord's been good to us. It's I've I can say it's already the last service, but I can say I truly enjoy this time. It's been it's been a blessing to share those things with you. It's been such a atmosphere of of opening where we just we were able to open our hearts without any feeling like we had to I don't know no resistance and just be able to dive in the word. And so it makes it makes my life like the minister's life much much easier. And I think at the end of the day you get more blessing because the word is flowing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so again, I want to thank brother Moses for the invitation. And so I was really happy to be here right right away tomorrow morning. First hour going to fly back home. We we have a we have a church also to take care. So Andre Pet, my father-in-law was preaching this morning and my family told me it was a great service. So then I'm happy. I'm happy was I I was covered. Amen. Amen. God is taking care of his children. Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll turn the in our Bible tonight, Book of Jeremiah. I want to greet my friends here tonight, Jeff. Jeff, Stephanie, and brother Brent. Thanks for thanks for coming. Amen. So, we're going to turn in the book of Jeremiah, chapter 17. Now, Jeff and Brent are good friends, but Jeff's kids and my kids brought friendship to another level. They are all these kids just flew in Quebec. I think it's a month ago, and they went on a trip to uh Prince Rhode Island camping. And my my those young people, they live in a bigger world than I live in when I was young. I never I never been to Prince Edward Island, I think. Amen. But those friendship when you're young are these these are precious. &gt;&gt; These are precious. Good friends, something's precious. That's also a a principle that uh you know when you have kids, you know, to give them sometime it's a sacrifice. Uh sometime maybe good friends are not in the neighborhood. They might be uh in the next neighborhood. It takes a sacrifice to drive them. But if you see that they they can they can be surrounded by by good friends then you know you invest in that. Amen. You invest in that. I think that it's um it's a good thing. Amen. Sometime good friends can be in other province and sometime it turns into marriage and and that's another question. All right. Jeremiah chapter 17:9. I did mention that this morning. It was uh so we're going to read it tonight. I think that's a scripture sometime that's misunderstood. It was misunderstood by me because I thought the heart was deceitful when I was a sinner and when I got became a Christian then my heart doesn't deceive me anymore. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you. Uh our heart needs to be guarded at all time. And so we we we study this morning that that the reason it's deceitful is because it's hiding from us because it's the subconscious part. But the word is a discerner of the thoughts of the hearts. &gt;&gt; And that the word will expose the motive and objective and the intention of the heart which sometime we make an excuse. Oh like I want to do this, I want to do that and then the word comes and shows the true motive behind and it was not godly but we made it. Sometimes as Christians we we're good at ma making stuff look good. Even sometime we hide a bad motive or resentment or something and then well I have on my heart well that that sometime is is big right so that's why when you come to the house of the lord and we are being exposed to the preaching of the word sometime it's not just amen sometime it's ouch &gt;&gt; and some people they don't want to feel this way so they like I hate to go to your church I feel judged but the judgment start by the house of the lord &gt;&gt; there's no purgatory somewhere it's it's now that god wants to purge purge purge us you know of oursel amen so let's read it 17:9 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can who can know it &gt;&gt; and so when we know when God ask a question like that who can know it it means nobody knows it &gt;&gt; I the Lord I said this morning nobody's asked in the scripture seek your own heart because the word says the god search the heart &gt;&gt; I try to reign even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings. Amen. Let's bow our head. Lord Jesus, we we want to thank you, Lord. It's been a blessing to be with friends and brethren, Lord. And even though, Lord, I didn't know a lot of people here right away, Lord. We know under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and the fellowship of the word, we know we come from the same place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're going to end up in the same place &gt;&gt; because we we we we've been in that atmosphere. And this is what is so amazing traveling around the world. When we dive, we we might talk about culture and culture is different, food's different, and drive on the other side of the road and drive on the other side of the car and so many different things. But when we open the word, suddenly we're all on the same side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Lord, bless this church as went through a transition we spoke about last night. Bless them richly and may prosper them, Lord. And make them grow in your presence and being fruitful for your kingdom, Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless your word tonight. It's already blessed, but open our mind and our hearts and take every spirit under your control so you may be glorified and that your spirit may be free to move. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. And so tonight is going to be a service and I can say in two parts and I'll explain why. So this morning um uh uh there is a little part I needed to finish and I was not sure I would I intended to cover it but I was not quite sure how. And then at lunch there's a couple of brothers we were sitting at a table and then they start to talk about a topic and and then we start to exchange on on on on the topic of trauma. And I told the brothers, I says, "Okay." I said, "You know what?" I says, "We we going to cover that tonight." &gt;&gt; And so, there's going to be part one tonight, and we try to make it short, but just hit the high the high notes. And then we're going to go through the story of Rebecca, Becky, as we said we would. Uh, and just also to just to do an like in-depth analysis of of what they went through as I explained this morning. And what is the uh what is what what does a prophet change course on couple of things because he wanted different results with his daughter and there's a lot of things we can learn from that. All right. So is everybody's on board? &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So uh we just read that scripture. So the word deceitful it means it's sly it's insidious. Okay. and and and and and but the word desperately wicked, it means that it's weak, it's sick, it's frail, it's incurable. But we know the cure, the cure is the word of God. But on the on a on a human side, when our heart is wicked, there's nothing we can do. Man cannot change itself. Man doesn't have the power to change his heart, but God has the power to change his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Couple of years ago when I was studying on that topic, I I I I ended up on a Bible commentary which I thought was so precise, so good because it really resembled in exactly what the prophet was saying. And so that this Bible commentary, I don't know who made it, but the truth is truth. So it says who can know it? It even hides itself from itself so that it its owners does not know it. A corrupt heart is the worst enemy the fallen creature can have. Remember this morning we studied we are our worst enemy. But what part of us is our worst enemy? It's the subconscious part. &gt;&gt; It is full of evil devices of deceit, of folly and abomination. And its owners knows not what's in him till it boils over &gt;&gt; and is often past remedy before the evil is perceived. Therefore, trust not in a man whose purposes are constantly changing and who is actuated only by motives of self-interest. Now, what is amazing here is that in that Bible commentary, and I find it as so being so right, is that it says the owner knows not what's in him till it boils over. Have you ever found yourself to be um I don't know, you're just going through something and suddenly you think out of nowhere you explode. it boils over and then you're like, "Oh my goodness, I think I got I think I'm sick of that. I think I got I'm over my head with that, but like I didn't realize." And that's where sometime if we don't know ourself, we we we wake up in a position where we went too far, said too much because it boils over and we didn't realize like that was getting under my skin, but it was hidden. Like you didn't realize how much you had enough. Then you explode to your wife or husband or to the kids or whatever in church like suddenly a sister comes to you and then here she goes again and then suddenly you just lose it in front of everybody and then you're like oh my goodness like I was able to hide that bitterness from everybody but now there's no chance I'm hiding anymore. No, everybody knows now. So this is how the hearts work. You know sometime it's even hidden from yourself but when it boils over you're like oh my Luther said same in the same spirit of what the brother brother Brandham said. I am not afraid of my own I am more afraid of my own heart than of the pope and all his cardinals. I have within me the great pope self. The enemy is not this big guy out there. Whatever situation we are fighting with ourself &gt;&gt; to have the right attitude to stay in love to stay in forgiveness. Amen. And so where I was this morning, so sorry that we have visitors tonight. And so maybe if you're not there this morning, you're just jumping on a moving train. So be careful your step. You know, it's we we were not stopping. So it's like a station, but we don't stop. So jump in. So because it's fresh, it's just this morning, so we just can't move on. So this morning the next slides where I was uh was you remember this this morning we we talk about the cause and effect of things like it thing doesn't appear suddenly and many parents sometime or even marriage was like well suddenly like I received the papers from the lawyers and now she wants to file divorce and then like suddenly no these these things doesn't happen suddenly it's a it's a buildup &gt;&gt; or your your kids run away and it's like I don't know what's wrong with him like yesterday he was smiley and we were having a meal at the table and we were joking. He seems not he seems he was okay and now today he ran away. It's like suddenly and I hear often people that's that's what they say because they were so clueless about what was going on in their marriage. So clueless about what was going or even a split like suddenly like half the church went &gt;&gt; suddenly. &gt;&gt; No, this is a buildup for many years. That's frustration that's under and under and sometime we don't realize what's going on &gt;&gt; till it boils over. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we need to be sensitive because if we're sensitive and if we care like this morning we we showed how we care for others then we'll get some information. We need to be able to expose also um inconvenient conversation in families ask those taboo question &gt;&gt; because if we if we if we're silent on a topic it means that the devil is sitting right on that topic and he's talking &gt;&gt; oh he's doing the talking while you are afraid to bring it up because you know if you bring it up you're going to look like bad a bad dad. Well, let's go bad dad. Look bad and get better. I've I've had those inconvenient conversation with the kids where I knew like I'm asking the tough questions like I know like I told the girls like um I remember told the girls this is I my mo my my my my greatest fear is that I don't want to be this annoying dad where where I speak you're like here goes again when you start to get those rolling of the eyes like you're so annoying and so and so so this morning we taught on this chain of effect that will bring the heart of somebody in the house can be the husband, the wife, the kids, the the heart to drift away. &gt;&gt; When the heart drifts away, gets outside somewhere. They can be in their room, but they're connect to a computer and they're living out there somewhere else, but they're not their heart is not at home anymore. So now we want to look at in a different angle and and and to try to map how how does it pile up? How does it turn from a wounded spirit to a lock heart? Because most of the time is where we we realize we have a trouble a problem with either a a spouse or a kid or as a pastor it can be also somebody in church. Sometime when we wake up to realize we have a problem it's already too late because the heart is locked. And so we want to learn how we can intervene and discern much earlier in the process where when it's still flexible and when you can still access the heart before it gets locked. Okay. So, we're going to look at how this works. So, first of all, the prophet is saying again things doesn't h appear suddenly. He says if you went into a doctor's office and told him you were sick and told him your symptoms and he was in a hurry, he would probably give you a quote a a little prescription with some anesthetic and well, it's just a little scripture. Take the scripture. It's going to fix everything. Some sort of aspirin. The doctor is mereily trying to get rid of you &gt;&gt; just at that time because he hasn't time or he doesn't care. But a real good husband pastor doctor before he gave you the medicine. Sorry my guess I'm slip here. He would diagnose that case thoroughly &gt;&gt; till he found out what was wrong and then give you the medicine. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometime we find people going through these prayer lines out across the nation and they just they just run up and run up and think that the Lord ought to heal them right then. But there is something maybe down in there that was set before the Lord. And we set before the Lord until he reveals that what that is and there is something that God there's a reason for everything. And you got to find the reason first and then you can find what to work on. But sometimes for us we go straight to the symptoms. Well, you're being rebellious and the and the word is clear on that. &gt;&gt; No, I know I'm rebellious. My rebellion is not the problem. &gt;&gt; The problem is causing me to be rebellion. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we want to understand and we we laid those principle with quotes this morning as the prophet taught us that he's talking about the prostitute. He's talking about about many example and he he says it started in the home even abandoned kids left in the street nobody cares there's there's something that's happened to you and so ways that I've been hurt now also another principle that I've discovered many like years much year later for many years churches been concerned with sin if if if there's sin then everybody Everybody's like, "Red alert, there's sins. We got to solve the sin question. We got to get rid of sin. We got to clean sin." But what we don't realize is that hurt or trauma or a wounded spirit will have the same effect on a person than sin. And both of them needs to be brought to we need to bring our sins to the cross. But we need to bring our wounds and our hurt to the cross &gt;&gt; because God when Jesus died on the cross, we know it's a double atonement. He the blood of Jesus is for healing and for the forgiveness of sin. Now that's another sermon, but it's it's it goes both way and it's divine healing &gt;&gt; and to get rid of sin question and get rid of sickness. But when we talk about sickness sometime we just think about cancer, diabetes or something. But but we're talking about divine healing from the inside because Jesus says I came to heal the brokenhearted. So healing is not healing of the body which is which we we've heard so much and and that's what a problem sometime. I remember years ago when when when my father-in-law had had a depression and he had a nervous breakdown. He couldn't sleep anymore. He couldn't eat anymore. The church had no clue. I had no clue what to do with it. Now, if he'd had cancer, he had diabetes, we would we we would all come come and have a prayer for him, everybody, all the church life because we we've been trained how to deal with sickness, &gt;&gt; but we've not been trained how to deal with inward wounded spirits, &gt;&gt; emotional meltdown, &gt;&gt; anxiety disorder, &gt;&gt; uh all those inward, it's a mystery for the church. Somebody comes with a broken arm with a a cast you say and everybody wants to sign their name on it. Oh, brother, can I sign mine? Everybody runs. Oh, you broke your arm and you have a cast. They all sign a name. Somebody comes in church depressed. Everybody runs. Oh my. That's that sister. May she's she Oh my. That's that's trouble. &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to sign up for being surrounded by somebody that's an emotional breakdown. &gt;&gt; Why? because we don't understand those things. So that's why we need to teach on those things &gt;&gt; and that I was I'll be honest now I'm going another route so it's an extension but I was troubled when my own father-in-law so I was the assistant pastor and my own father-in-law goes on a breakdown there's two reason why I went that road of teaching on those things first it was my inability to be a father okay so I'm a minister God bless blessed the ministry. Some people love my ministry. God is in there. Holy Spirit is in there. But I come back home and I'm a poor father. And at one point I had to be honest. It's not working. So that number one, this I'm missing something. &gt;&gt; And the second reason why I started studying those things is my own father-in-law, which the pastor of a church has an emotional breakdown, nervous breakdown. He's tired. His his nervous system breaks and he can't sleep anymore. He's he he was trembling. He couldn't eat anymore. It was a serious condition. And nobody knew what to do with that. And on top of that, some people in the church was like, "Well, maybe something hiding here." And and maybe he did something and and and everybody's like like, you know, Job's friends. &gt;&gt; Everybody's clueless, but everybody and I start to call around some pastors like, "What do we do?" Like, I have a pastor. He's down. And I don't know. and and I I I didn't get zero support, zero understanding. And I said, "This is wrong. There is something wrong within our ranks. We h we don't know what to do with depression." &gt;&gt; It's like it's not supposed to happen. If you're full of the Holy Ghost, you're not supposed to go through these and it's probably some hidden sins or God is trying to tell you you're not at your place and so much theories. And I was not buying none of that. &gt;&gt; But I didn't have the answer. So that's where I started to to dig in and try to start to study and try to find answers. There is answers in the word for that. &gt;&gt; But it was overlooked &gt;&gt; because all those years wounds of the body. Oh my. Come in in prayer. &gt;&gt; Wounds of uh of the soul. It's a sin question. Well, go to the cross. Wounds of the spirit. Psychology. Put that in the garbage. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the church was forbidden of helping people on the emotional level &gt;&gt; and on the wounded spirit because it was labeled psychology. &gt;&gt; But what we what we've missed is that the prophet says that the greatest battle ever fought was in the mind. &gt;&gt; But when people's mind breaks because they lost a battle on the field, then the church is like, "Well, you know, &gt;&gt; we're going to pray for you. like go away. &gt;&gt; It's inconvenient because we don't know what to do with you. &gt;&gt; So when I talk about ways I have been hurt right away people are like well hurt. What is he talking about? I'm filled with the Holy Ghost. I live in the presence of God. I'll never get hurt. Well go that go tell that to brother Brandham. And standing in the gap he says I've been cut. I've been wounded. I've been on a battlefield. I've been scarred all over. And I'm so grieved that I I want to live in the wood and I don't want to mess with preachers anymore and churches anymore. And I just want to be this rugged guy. I don't have to cut my hair. I don't have to do my beer and I I'm going to trap my wife and we're going to live in the woods. Well, that sounds a great plan for a healthy marriage. When God talked to the prophet, he says, "Carry your plan and your wife's going to leave you." We overlook these things. But what God is telling him is that if you keep that complex that you have cuz you're so hurt, you're going to bring your marriage to the ground cuz she's going to leave you. &gt;&gt; If it was not for the grace of God, those wounds in his spirit would have and and and greater than that. I was I was having fellowship with brother Moses on that topic and and there's a full sermon on that. Maybe one day we can come back and preach on that. But just just a short thing on it and and we I've for many years I've studied standing in the gap and for many years I've missed the most important part and the most important part was brother Roy Border's dream. Nobody knows what I'm talking about probably. But brother Roy Roy Border's dream was and he he tells the dream be when he start the sermon standing in a gap but he gives the interpretation of the dream at the end of the sermon and most of the time we don't connect the dots together but the dream was Roy Borders he says we were sitting there at the ta lord's table the lord's table is communion table and he says the pillar of fire came brother I took you away and brought you somewhere else and he says I was crying bring him back bring him back where is the prophet And then he says later on he says the pinfari brought you back but you had been changed. And so the prophet says remember now being changed because later I'll tell you what it means. Then he goes on sorry then he goes on to the story of having a complex being scarred losing the feeling for the people wanted to live in the woods like Elijah. And that's what Christian do when we have a complex and we're wounded we'll try to find a scripture and make disguise our complex as something spiritual. And that's what he did. Well, he told God, "Am I not a prophet like the Old Testament so I can live in the woods?" But he says, "I was just being selfish. Just wanted to go fishing and hunting. I wanted to be a guide all my life." And so also all his life, he had this desire to be something, a guide, but that's not what God planned. God's plan for him for him was was to be a prophet and do the work of an evangelist. And so at the end of the sermon, he says, the prophet says, "I need, he says," my heart's not right. I've built a complex. And it's so easy to build a complex, and I lost I lost my heart, my burden for the people. And he says, "Something needs to be changed." He says, "You see now, brother Roy Borders, that's what it meant. Being changed. Something needs to been changed. My heart needs to change because I still think that he should have listened to me. I'm still hurting. So that dream is really important because since the prophet gave it an interpretation, it's equivalent to a vision. &gt;&gt; And that vision was that God took the prophet away from the communion table to change him. So God took this complex seriously. &gt;&gt; So complex is not just a little side note, right? &gt;&gt; But a complex is a set. So in psychology because the word complex comes from the psy come it's a it's a it's a it's a term from psychology which the prophet used &gt;&gt; and he explained what a complex is in the spiritual world he called it a dark cloud or a complex wrapped around you he says it is so easy to build one but why so Christian says well if you're filled the holy ghost you'll never have one it's not true it's a great misunderstanding like we have so much. &gt;&gt; So the prophet has this this complex he he's he's in that. So a complex the the term complex mean it's a so the word complex first of all it's not the first term is not uh in psychology is complex is it's a combination of thing. So if you combine couple of different material and you make something you call it a complex. It's a complex. It's a you've mix different things, you put it together, and it's a complex. But in psychology, it's a it's different feelings that gets together and becomes a person a personal trait that you have. It becomes like your new personality. But it's a sets of negative feelings you have that you had through a wound. You're not born with those complex. Even though some can be traced back to genetic and and like your the prophet gives the example of Irish and this like some cultural that are passed by. But main the main the main complex is something you went through and it becomes like a trauma. We're going to explain how trauma works after we've shown that diagram and how to get rid of trauma, how to get delivered from that. So ways that I've been hurt is what we call a wounded spirit. Remember this morning we talked about the age of innocence. &gt;&gt; So Adam and Eve were in their innocence and the devil came and strike and and and and since then humanity never recovered. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. So but a wounded spirit something happened to you and even the discernment in prayer line the prophet would discern those things you remember I think it's on video yes it on video in Chicago &gt;&gt; the sister is there prophet saw a vision he says oh I see you this nervous condition so nervous condition in modern language it's it's it's anxiety disorder and anxiety disorder is caused by a trauma unresolved trauma And if you pile them, then you become more anxious because trauma tends to invite the next one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And invite the next one until you're totally locked in a corner. You have social phobia. You don't want to see anyone. You you hear somebody's talking about you like, I hate people. They talk about me, so don't say anything about me and this and that and and you become you become totally lock in your life. We're not called for that. We're called for freedom. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're called to be delivered of those things and to walk in full freedom with no fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's possible. &gt;&gt; But that's what a wounded spirit will do. And so in this prayer line in Chicago, um the prophet says, "Oh, you see it's a nervous condition and and and oh, I see it's a lie. Oh, it's a minister." He said, "Imagine you're in prayer line. The minister says out loud, you're a witch. Imagine the church that that believe this evangelist. Now she's a witch. Oh great. Talk about a her and talk about a trauma in the church. Everybody looks you at a witch now. &gt;&gt; She didn't recover from that. &gt;&gt; Until the truth was exposed. &gt;&gt; Go your way sister. And he exposed this was a lie. You are not a witch. &gt;&gt; But she was traumatized and it wounded her spirit. And when your spirit is wounded, whatever happened to you and it's unresolved, it will make you feel a certain way. &gt;&gt; So wound will create a feeling and when it creates a feeling, it becomes an emotional issue. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You think about it all the time. You cry. You can't sleep. You can't get over it. You talk about it all the time. And your husband or your wife doesn't know really what to do with it because we don't know how to approach these things. And we don't know how to pray. We don't know how to lead a wounded spirit that has an emotional issue. We don't know how to lead them in prayer to get their freedom. &gt;&gt; We don't know how to do that. Lord, help me. Lord, help me. But we're stuck with it. It doesn't work. Lord, help me. We talk about it. We cry. But it's still there. &gt;&gt; It's like a prison. And then because we're stuck with it, now we're looking for comfort. So a wounded spirit, this is the way you've been hurt. How it makes you feel cause an emotional issue. But if it doesn't make it, if you don't get healed, then you will start to act upon it. What it makes me do. You start slamming door. You start to avoid people. Uh that sister been called a witch. Guess what? There's an evangelist in town. You should come. Do you think she's excited? Oh, praise the Lord. I'll be called a witch another time. I'll stay home. Thank you. &gt;&gt; I've done that. So, she's not coming anymore. What? So, then it becomes a spiritual problem because every time there's an evangelist doing a prayer line, she stays home. &gt;&gt; And it looks like a great solution, but it's not because it's now keeping her from the house of the Lord. But we can blame the sister. It's a shame. That sister, she's been for with us for so many years, but every time it evangelist show up in town, she stays home. What a shame. She's should be ashamed of herself. So I call this other sister into church. And I told her that and then ended up she hears about it. Now she's got another problem. Now she doesn't come to church ever because everybody's talking about her. That's right. &gt;&gt; So she's finding solution to her emotional issues, but all the solutions are bad. And that's where it becomes what it makes me do. Then it becomes a spiritual issues. And what if that she in her background there's some drinking in the family and now she's so anxious she developed an anxiety disorder. And and because you know alcohol is a problem in the family, then she started drinking just a little bit to to to feel a bit better about it because when she drinks it makes her feel calmer for a little while. We know what it does and then it's worse or she needs now she needs pills, she needs medication, she needs something to do. And so so this is how the buildup how it's piling. So we had quote this morning. And I didn't have time to read, but you take you take a a you take a girl that's been What amazes me also in the office when I talk with people and we when we counsel is the power of words. &gt;&gt; People remember stuff they heard when they were young &gt;&gt; in school. A comment. I was dealing with a young man um a couple of time ago and and a guy in school told him, "Man, you look like a gay." It didn't look like much. But that word hit him so hard that he started doubting like the power of word. You know we we talk often time we talk about spoken word &gt;&gt; but spoken words works for positive &gt;&gt; but it works also for the bad words is power words are weapon &gt;&gt; and it amazes me sometime you're sitting in the office you're 30-year-old 40year-old time doesn't remove those words and then when you when I try to trace back because then that person has a certain belief she believes something about herself or himself and like where did you get this where's the first time you heard that and People keep thinking, "Yeah, yeah, I remember. Yeah, I was in school. Yeah, the guy you said that and it it hit me and it stayed with me. I was hunt." So the devil took those words and haunted you with that and it became something unresolved. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then then the guy wants to prove he's not he's not gay. So he start to go out with girls and try to sleep with them just to prove himself that he's and so it becomes now a spiritual issues &gt;&gt; because now that emotional issues will lead him in sin if he doesn't get it resolved with the Lord. But then if you keep doing what you're doing, try to resolve with false solution and false comforting, drinking, drugs, pornography, uh you know, sinful life, whatever you've choose to to do to cope, stay away from church, whatever. And then you know those people that avoid church and they avoid church and this this is why a lot of people that are and I don't want to hurt any feelings but a lot of people that are in that movement of tape only in homes you scratch the surface you don't have to scratch the surface a lot to discover that under that behind they're hiding their pain &gt;&gt; they've been hurt in church &gt;&gt; by ministers or something and then when that doctrine came it sounded like a great idea and their spiritualize a wound that well anyway I didn't trust those preachers well anyway I didn't trust church &gt;&gt; so yeah the bride of Christ will be something special I'll be in my home listening to tapes everybody will listen so I'm on my own so I won't get hurt anymore that's just one example &gt;&gt; how we can spiritualize it make it sound really message &gt;&gt; while it's totally contrary to the word but why did you why did that spirit that say quit church and play tapes in your home and that's like the great things to make the rapture. Why did it appeal to you but not this one? &gt;&gt; Because you needed that. &gt;&gt; But then when those things are not dealt and they don't find healing, then that's where it becomes that's you don't do it anymore. That's what you become. And that's where you become a lock heart. And when somebody is locked in his heart, that's where it's so hard to reach them &gt;&gt; because now they're set in their ways. They forgot that they've been wounded. They forgot that they had an emotional issues because they don't feel it anymore because now the heart is hard. They don't cry anymore about it. &gt;&gt; No. No. I I forgave them. &gt;&gt; No, you didn't forgave. A lot of a lot of Christians think they forgive, but what they did is they just excused that person. Well, you know, they didn't meant it. It's it's okay. It's okay. &gt;&gt; That's not forgiveness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The hurt is still there. &gt;&gt; So, most of the law I see a lot of Christian in my office that don't know what forgiveness is. They think if they stop talking about it and so I I'll show you what what what what Christians do when they think they forgave. So they get they get hurt, you know, boom. And now it hurts them and they're okay. And and they're like, "Ah, ah, I need to forgive." And then when they forgive, they're like, and then they take it all inside. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I have forgive. That's not forgiveness. &gt;&gt; You didn't give it to the Lord. &gt;&gt; You took it inside because you want to be you'd want to I had the right attitude and sincerely we do that. We swallow because we don't know how to. And then we call that forgiveness. But when we bring it deep inside like that, it change who we are &gt;&gt; because it's still there. Every time we see that person If your heart turns when you see that person or you're close to the same situation, it's because it's still inside of you. &gt;&gt; It's still affecting you. It's still causing you. And I'm not talking about you remember. You can remember in a way, but it but if your heart rate goes up or you sweat or or or it's not it's not solved. It's still inside of you and it's controlling you. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's true. &gt;&gt; And you have to cope. you have to do something else to do to compensate. So, but in our ranks and in most in the Christian world, I'd say because I've I've I've heard about it. We don't recognize the first two. The first two wounded spirit emotional issues is labeled psychology. We don't go there. So, the only thing most churches recognize is spiritual issues. He's drinking. He doesn't go to church. He ran away. He's slamming door. He didn't respect his parents &gt;&gt; and he's locked. I talked to him. He's stubborn. He doesn't want to. And now we now we have a problem. So most of the time we wake up when there's spiritual issues. Well, he started he started drinking. So suddenly &gt;&gt; he ran away. He slammed door. But the red flag should start earlier. And that's why we need to teach on these things because if we're parents and we need to guard our children, our spouse and all that when when when our child is or or or a wives or a husband is deeply hurt about something, we should raise a red flag say okay we need to stop and deal with that because if if we don't attend and that's why God even was blaming shepherds because he says they don't bind the wounds, they don't heal them. So then there's infections then it spreads in other area. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; well you say well there's evil spirit involved in that. Absolutely evil spirits get involved around that stage. Demons will enter. So demons demons thrive and prosper on a wound. wound is an entry door. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's how they enter your life. And they enter your life as a com &gt;&gt; because now because you're wounded and you don't know how to get benefit from the comforter because the comforter, Holy Spirit wants to come and heal you. Jesus says, "I came to heal the brokenhearted." But because we're not too much aware, we don't understand too much how this works. We kind of stay with it. We try to cope. A lot of people we cope. We try to just try to make make it work but it doesn't work. And so and I understand sometime people you know they some try to find answers in in just pure psychology and it doesn't work. The answer is not there. Some try to find the answer just in dealing with sins, dealing with behavior like I don't care like you're you're dying inside that's fine. But when your behavior is wrong, then I get aware. &gt;&gt; That's why church or families that just focus on rules and behavior, you're missing the point &gt;&gt; because we get alerted by bad behavior, but we never get alerted by bad insight in the sense that he's wounded. He's not doing good. Like I said this morning, how was your day? But we were not interested to know. Do we really care about what's going on inside? And if we really care about what's going on inside, then we can care. We can attend. We can bring healing. We can pray with someone. &gt;&gt; If I go to church and I walk and I walk around as a pastor, I do it with my family. I do it my wife. I look at my wife's eyes. I don't even have to look at her. when we become sensitive and we become connected to our wife. I remember it's funny even my kids sometime I remember one day one of my daughters I'm in the kitchen and I'm she's by me but I feel her because we're so connected and I'm like I was about to say her name but anyways I says are you good? She says yeah daddy I'm good. I says no you're not. Some there's there's a heaviness with you. There's something. And she says, "No, I'm fine." And what's a that that time? It really amazes me and it amazes her because she didn't even realize yet that she was carrying something and I pick it up before she did. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So, this is the level of connection that you can have. Now, think, "Oh, Brother Steve, it's so nice. It's because you're such a great father." No, no, you don't you forget don't forget my beginning. My beginning, I didn't care. I didn't care. My kids were sad. They were afraid of me. That's the guy I am. But when you connect to such a level that you're so closely and you you you have this this this fellowship of the heart then I then when when I said no you're not there's there's something there you carry some heaviness I don't know what it is and she says no I'm fine then she start thinking we kept we were in the kitchen I don't know and this and then she started crying she says I yeah you're right then she started crying and then she was like you pick it up before I did and then we were able to pray together and saw it was not a big deal but she was just having a burden something and I felt it. And same thing with my wife. Sometime I'm like, "Honey, there's something." And and sometimes she doesn't want to tell me cuz she doesn't want to bother me. Let's say I said something the the night before and it hurt her, but she doesn't want to complain. She loves me. She's like, "Yeah, it's my husband. I know he doesn't want to hurt me, but she carries it because I hurt her anyway. Even though she wants to be nice and don't want to bring it up." And then the next day I'm like, "Are you good?" "Oh, yeah, honey. It's okay." I says, "No, you're not." No, I know you. There's something here. No, honey. I'm telling you. I says, honey, you're not good. Let's sit down. Talk to me. She said, I hate it. I cannot hide you anything. You can be connected where you care &gt;&gt; and you attend. And so, she was wounded. It was not even emotional that much because she's not crying. She looks okay, but I felt the heaviness. And she does the same for me. She my wife look at me in the eyes and she knows she knows Steve like no yeah it's a bit tough right now and so when we become sensitive like that as a pastor now I can walk in the church and I I look at people in the eyes people I know and I know you know when people are you're about to shake their hands and they they can't look in the eyes because they have to hide because you know the eyes is the door to the heart this is something I invite couples to It's pretty pretty intimidating. Okay, I'll give you a challenge. Before you go to bed, you got to sit in front of each other. Now you're laughing because it's a huge challenge. Sister, that's what I do in my office sometimes when when when when couples don't understand when I when I talk about connecting, they don't get it. It's like, "What do you mean connecting? What do you mean connecting?" I says, "Okay." I said, "Do you want to try it?" They're like, "Okay." I said, "Okay, put your chairs one in front of the other." They're like, "Okay, so chairs one for us." Just say, "Hold your hands. Now look at each other in the eyes and stare. Stay there. Lock yourself in in your spouse's eyes." That's amaz that that exercise tells a lot. And then one side if crack if it crack diversion because they don't want to be somebody to look in their heart. Some will start crying because when you look somebody in the eyes and you care, you're asking not a braintobrain connection, but your heart is asking for a heart connection. If the heart is wounded in a relationship, the other one will not be able to do that. &gt;&gt; And then I asked the question, okay, what is your thought? Why can't you look? And then right away they're going to say because of this. And sometime it's because of certain things and then we have to solve it. Then we try it again. It's a it's a huge challenge. Pretty intimidating. Okay. But when we talk about connection, it's it's because most of the time a couple we look in the same direction. We want to look, but we never look at each other. Have you done this? Yeah. You know this. We're partners. We we walk side by side and it's it's part of the journey, but we have to stop sometime and look at each other. Are you good? No, I'm not good. Lately, it's been rough. You've been you've been rough with me and I'm hurting. &gt;&gt; Yes, you're right. I've been going through this and I'm not been patient. And so, me and my wife have those conversation more than more than once a month that we have to stop and say, "Okay, we've been busy lately. We forget each other. we have to reconnect because and when you reach that connection you get it's like uh you get used to it like you you know now the level you can reach but most of us didn't have that at home or mother maybe never looked at us in the eyes cuz she like it's weird and for some of you like whoa that's weird because we're not you we are so disconnected &gt;&gt; and that's why we live in such a lonely world. &gt;&gt; So, it's a challenge. So, anyway, let's go back to this. I need I I I I told myself I got certain time for first part. So, I'm almost done for the part one. So, first part is just label psychology. Second part it's behavior. So, some some people are just behavior. Other they just the psychology word they're just world they're just and and other everything is spiritual. It's a demon. It's a demon. It's a demon. It's sidamine. And I would say everybody's right, but everybody's wrong because it's a combination of three. It's emotional, then it becomes spiritual, and then spirits get involved, and then you got a problem. Do you realize it's a balancing? It's not just demons. It's not just emotions. It's not just hurt. And I feel like in my heart, this brings a lot of answers. And that when when then it it carries for too long and you got a runaway teenager. When he when he has courage enough to run away from the house or when when the spouse has courage enough to file papers or to say I'm going at my parents or I'm renting an apartment that's tough because it means that it you needed to be locked to be able to make such a stand. You had to think about it for a long time. And when you reach that don't say too late it's too late but sometime it's too late for that moment like sometime people are like can you meet my son and and like I know I I've been watching I've met him before sometime I've met it much earlier in the process but we cannot resolve it's it's and then then and sometime parents are sometime brother Steve can you meet my son can you help him I'm like yes I will sit with him but I know in my heart that thing is locked I will do it because when I went in the Well, nobody called me. Like, brother Steve, what's wrong with you? You don't show up in church. I stopped going to church. Nobody called. Nobody. Nobody said anything. I just walked away from church. No deacons call, no pastor, nobody. I just disappear. And I don't know. It was probably convenient like, well, it's time. It's about time he leave. Anyway, what was he doing in church anyway? He didn't take communion and uh and they're sitting in the back and they leave like they were not interested. So uh yeah you know good riddance because church can be locked also lock heart &gt;&gt; well they lose the burden for souls &gt;&gt; and and then people who struggle they become inconvenient &gt;&gt; like whether we look like it's such a bad testimony &gt;&gt; church needs to be hospital again &gt;&gt; where the sick can come &gt;&gt; blue hair and pursing and tattoos and well we're going to look like well Jesus that's what the Pharisee hated cuz he was about he was he was with those kind of people cuz he says that's the one who need a doctor. &gt;&gt; But when the church becomes so polished &gt;&gt; and we want to have everything so much in order. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When we're so focused on behavior, people need to behave because this other church going to think that we are now worldly and that we accept worldly people. So we want to straight the people's behavior before God fix the inside. And church put a lot of pressure on the outside appearance. &gt;&gt; We start by the hair and the skirt and the TV before we care by about the inside. And that's a huge mistake &gt;&gt; cuz people did conform on the outside not knowing that God wanted to heal from deep deep inside. &gt;&gt; That's what we call religion. Religion, it's an outside process to make us feel good and look better. But God is not interested in religion. That's why when Jesus came, he went contrary to the religion of that moment. He was he was going to people that needed &gt;&gt; when Jesus went to Zakius, did he say, "By the way, man, shame on you." Like, "Yeah, I came in your house for supper, but let's talk, man. You're a thief. You should be ashamed of yourself. &gt;&gt; No. Jesus, and this is a big mystery, but Jesus bypasses behavior &gt;&gt; and care for Zakius. &gt;&gt; And when he did that, the love of God unconditional that doesn't look at your behavior like do you think Jesus didn't know he was a thief? Imagine all the town looking at Jesus like of all people like he going he's going for supper like it's like if he was a prophet like if you believe the message you would know like he chose the worst house in town. &gt;&gt; Did you see the party he lit last night and now Jesus showing up there like oh my goodness discernment. Hello. &gt;&gt; But Jesus didn't care what he looked like. He went in the worst town. Not worst town. The worst house in town. the the worse. &gt;&gt; And when he went, it was not to to talk about Zakius's behavior. &gt;&gt; Scripture doesn't even mention that he talked about his behavior. &gt;&gt; But God visited him that night. And then Zakius because do you know what? He knew he was wrong. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So at the end of the supper, he says, "You know what, Lord? I'm going to fix this." probably Jesus his heart's like, "Yeah, I knew you would. That's why I came." Praise the Lord. Okay, we got to move on. But it's so good. It's &gt;&gt; so good. This is the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, we get hypnotized by people's behavior and it's a mistake. If somebody doesn't dress like we we give them the cold shoulders like, "Oh, you know, if we feel this way, it's we have too much religion inside of us." Right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so what's the remedy? We we I've mentioned that quote all the service before. Um, oh, just this one before because I got mixed I got notes here and notes that's on there and so they're the same but they're not the same slides. So, the prophet is is giving us here a key that that explain the diagram at the top. We find out that many people try to find comfort by drinking. Now drinking is it becomes a sin. It's a spiritual issue. You know we have saying this which is pretty well known among us today that many minister drink sometime before going to the pulpit. Take a good heavy drink of intoxication. It's been known to seeing minister on the platform that even stagger under the influence of liquor and that not that ought not to be like prophets obvious like that's wrong but it should not be but is because many time we might condemn the man when maybe we ought not to do that do that we ought to find back what's the trouble many of them were converted from alcohol and we found it that they're in that condition it's a disgrace and reproach but no more reproach than it would be to lie, steal, or lust after a winner or any other things. That's a commandment. So, he's saying we should ought not condemn the behavior, but we should go back and try to find there's a reason why he's going that road. And when we care for people, we care to find the cause. &gt;&gt; And believe me, I've done so many hours with people in the office. When you find the cause, which we now we're going to go into trauma, then when you find the cause and you bring it to the Lord, you dissolve in the blood of Jesus the reason why you're drinking. Why do you need pornography? Why do you need this fix? When Jesus touches that, the woman at the well, did Jesus told the woman, "You should stop now. You're at your sixth guy. Come on." Okay. Did you learn a seven will not fix Jesus didn't even he mentioned it but her question was deep where do we worship &gt;&gt; right when she realized that that that that man was a man of God her deep question was like I don't understand men her question was where do we worship the Jew says this and Samaritan says that and but I Well, she had the deep conspiritual confusion inside of her and she started talk to Jesus. Jesus answered her deepest question. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, how do we do that? Well, we we read this uh I've mentioned it and but now we can read it together. What was the matter? You had to open the channel first. You've got to get the soldier, the Holy Spirit placed in that at the battlefront that takes God's word. He is the word and he stands there and there's nothing going to stop it then. There's nothing. Every one of the other channel is cleared out just like an old boiler with the flu stooped up. You put a fire and it'll blow your thing up. That's what the matter with so many blowup Christian is because they don't clean the channel out. They don't go down to the inside. So when we try to fix people just by fixing their behavior, we're wrong because the behavior is not the problem. The problem is the inside. You've got to clean it. Conscience, memory, thoughts, laying aside everything and coming from the inside out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, there's some cleaning. So, and the cleaning is what? Clean what? Clean the behavior. The prophet says, "No, you clean the inside. There's been a wound. There's something there. And a lot of people don't realize when when you do stuff, there's a reason why you're doing it, but you forgot. And so the question I always tell people is you're not born that way. When did it start? Well, I remember and then we have a conversation and I take notes. Well, I remember the first time I did it was in school and my friend came offered me that. I says, "Okay, so that's when you started. But how was how was life at home then? Well, the week before I my daddy announced that he was leaving my mom. Okay. And you don't think it's related? No. No, it's not related. Okay. But how did you react? Well, I went in my room and I cried all night and couldn't sleep and Okay. And then you start to draw paint some because they forgot everything. And as you draw a painting of what it was then and what happened and what and then that that drug that thing became a a comforting and then you lay it out at one point it happens all the time tears start rolling and that's what the prophet was doing. He was doing that by vision. &gt;&gt; But we often time these days we don't have much vision but we still can care and ask questions because the prophet laid the principle. The Holy Spirit went back. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit went back. Oh, it's a dog. Oh, it's an evangelist who called you a wish. Oh, and there's many prayer lines. So if the Holy Spirit was going back to explain your anxiety disorder or whatever habit you had or whatever you're carrying, it means that we need to go back too. &gt;&gt; Well, Steve, brother Steve, that's complicated. Well, are you worth it? &gt;&gt; Are you worth the complication? &gt;&gt; There's a doctor. Amen. So, quickly now, trauma. So trauma is a wound. We were talking about the brother. I don't know if they're here tonight. Other brothers that were talking at lunch were I think. Yeah. Okay. You were the brothers are there. Okay. So they were explained to me that you know there's you know the congalles people are African people. Some of you left you know your refugees and it was tough. You know your mother running with you under bombs and and wars and and you know this is like we could say real trauma and yes absolutely real trauma. But there's a misunderstanding with trauma because trauma is not how big it was of of an event, but it's how you perceive it. The level of trauma is perception. I'll give you an example. You got a 5-year-old boy. He's going to school. It's I don't know. It's his first week and he get off the bus and mom's not used to Junior going and she's at grocery and she got delayed in traffic and she comes home 15 minutes after you Junior got off the bus. Now Junior got off the bus. He he enter in in in mommy's in in in his in his parents' home and the house is empty. Then he panics. He thinks mommy's dead. And for 15 minutes he goes to the process of mourning. He's sobbing. He's crying his life out. He's he's he's an orphan. Okay. Then mom comes in 15 minutes later and she finds Junior, you know, balling. He's panicking. He's shaking. He He He went through this whole thing. And mommy's like, "No, no, sweetheart. No, no. Mommy just came. Just came 15 minutes late. It's okay. I was just at the grocery. Just just all these little words saying that. No, no, you're not experiencing that right now. It's just because we have our adult mind, but we won't realize that at the scale of a 5-year-old what he went through. But since that day, every time he got off the bus, he's he's sweating, he's nervous, and then he he because it's how he perceived it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he can develop an anxiety disorder just with a simple things like that. And I'm talking about real things now. And it's amazing what I discovered in my office and the level of of a kid what he understood. I'll give you one example of one of my daughters, Mary, my oldest. One day my wife was so exhausted. She's homeschooling, pastor's wife, homeschooling kids and all that. And one day she's so exhausted. She says, "Oh, I'm so tired. I I feel like I got so much to do. I feel like I'm going to die." But my daughter heard that. And from that day, she started to do all the chores at home with my wife. And my wife was like, she was so impressed. She says, "Mary, she's amazing." She says, and so she couldn't sleep because when she heard what she when she was hearing my my wife doing dishes. She was in bed hearing the dishes and she couldn't sleep because she think she's still doing dishes. She might die. So, she was getting up and says, "Mommy, I want to help you. I can't sleep anyway." And so my wife was like, "Well, okay, sweetheart. You're so nice." And so Esther was like, "She's all happy. It looks something great." Like, "Wow, she's so devoted. She's so devoted, but she became devoted in the house out of a troll mine. Fear that she couldn't sleep because mommy." And so she was working like a slave. Not a slave, but just to make an image because she was trying to keep mom alive. That's a trauma. &gt;&gt; A word, &gt;&gt; perception. Years. It took us years. And you know how she discovered that? My wife, she discovered that when she took time with Mary in her room, she took I went on a trip and she said, "You know what, Steve? I'm going to do while you're on this, I don't know what trip went preaching somewhere probably." She says, "I'm going to take one kid a night, sleep with them. They're going to sleep together in the room and have a chat in the bed, you know, special time before bedtime." And she says, "I'm going to have one night each. They'll have." And and during that that time, she discovered because she cared, took time. How you doing? How do you feel? And that's where my wife discovered that. And then when and it what's amazing is that when Mary said it even for herself, she realized that she was doing all that to try to keep in. Guess what they did? They prayed and they removed that trauma through prayer. &gt;&gt; So trauma, bombs, wars, but again, it's not the level, it's how you perceive. If you you could have been a refugee and going through all those things believing without a shadow of that you're coming out that alive and it will not affect you as much as Junior that came out of the bus and totally had a meltdown because he thought mom died. &gt;&gt; So we cannot compare our past. Well, you had it tough. I had it easy. Well, I didn't have much. No, it's what you went through and how you perceived it. So this why sometime many time often time we minimize the trauma of a kid because we think as an adult so we don't take care and we don't bring healing was like well Donnie you know Junior just mommy was just at the grocery I just arrived 15 minutes later you were always safe you were fine and Junior's like okay you try to convince him what you just experienced is not real but it was real for him &gt;&gt; okay so This is what trauma. So trauma is not measure on on on on on sometime and I'll give you another example message example. The twins there's twins both girls come from holiness background they go to school one gets mocked both get mocked at church at school because they're virgin and oh you're wasting your life in religion and you don't know anything about boys and one of the girl is like go take a walk like like I don't care what you're thinking. I'm a Christian. I like what I do. The other one took it at heart &gt;&gt; and she had a meltdown. She it became she became so obsessed with those words that she heard. She ended up in in in in mentaliz. So you cannot have more close than that. They went through the same experience, same background, but one perceived it this way. And so it's just to tell you you can go through the same thing and the other one walks out &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; and the other one dive in and your life changed forever &gt;&gt; till a prophet came contacted her spirit. So her spirit became a wandering spirit trauma that's what it caused you live somewhere because you got to avoid pain. So she and then and you know what the prophet ca did he says you always wanted to marry a preacher when he saw a vision and when he died he did contact his spirit and brought back her identity because before the trauma before we before the devil despised the fact that she's a virgin she was sanctified and she was she had a call to marry a minister the devil messed that up but the prophet took her spirit and brought her back to her real estate her state condition before the trauma and then her eyes open. She came back to herself. So God wants to restore you prior to what has destroyed you. &gt;&gt; But how does it destroy you? Okay, we have keys now. So, oh, I thought I'd show trauma. So, trauma, trauma breaks your innocence. And what trauma will do is that you view life in a certain way, but then when you get wounded, you change your sets of belief. I'll give you an example. I'll take Mary again. So Mary, she sleeps at night. My wife could have been up vacuuming, washing dishes. Mary's sleeping. My mom is okay. Now she hears my my my wife says, "Man, I'm so so overwhelmed. There's so much I feel like I'm going to die, you know, just in just, you know, and then it it shocks her." And after that, she have a new belief system and that belief is not the truth. So that new so belief that are caused by trauma are unbelief. So trauma is there to bring unbelief in your life. Someone in church betrays you. So you come in church, you have a new church, all happy, everybody's nice. Everybody's there for the good. And then somebody betrays you, lie on you, whatever happened, misunderstanding. And then then you're like, before the trauma, everybody was nice. After the trauma, it's like I can't trust anyone in church. &gt;&gt; So what did the trauma induce? The trauma induced a change of belief. And that change of belief is not the truth is unbelief which is sin by the way. So trauma brings us into sin if we change our beliefs. &gt;&gt; You raise you you you you raise up in a Christian family. You want to get married and then a man cross your life a stranger or somebody in a church he's inappropriate. You get touched whatever of somebody family whatever you get abused and then you change your definition. All men are evil. I'll never get married. But before you say, "I'll never get married because that's the next stage." The first stage is all men are dangerous. They're all bad. They all dirty. New belief. It's unbelief. It's not true. God doesn't want. Yes, there's bad men out there, but there's a good one for you. This is how God wants to view this. But unbelief, the devil wants to to to put you in prison. So, he will put Christians and well, he will put human being in prison with trauma. That is that's his that is his greatest tool but it's unsuspected. There's many example if we go back to as a sisters called in a witch by an evangelist. Guess what? All evangelists are bad. If there's an evangelist in my church, it's not safe. I better stay home. Unbelief. It's not true. There was good evangelists out there that would not pretend to discern where they're just mocking the thing. &gt;&gt; But but but the devil cause trauma and then he'll say he'll give you your new belief. You see, you can't trust preacher. You see, you can't trust churches. &gt;&gt; You see, you can't trust your husband. Look at what he did. Isn't your husband dangerous? Lock your heart. You'll be better. Don't ever trust any man. Don't ever trust whatever new belief. But it doesn't stop there because that new belief now you have to take the next step to protect yourself. And that's where we come into what we call an oath. I will never trust a preacher again. I'll never step in a church again. I'll never open my heart to a pastor again. I'll never open my heart to my dad again. I tried. He He didn't even listen. He was looking at his cell phone. I'll never I'll never I'll never and it's amazing when I counsel people I'm waiting I'm looking for three things trauma belief oath and believe me I find them 99% of the time and it's what's amazing is I'm just asking question and people are people are telling me without me asking it is amazing every time I smile I write okay I find the oath okay I find the belief. People are telling you, "Yeah, I went through this and it was so difficult and and I told myself, you know what? They're all bad belief." And then I said, "You know what? I'll never go there." Oath. The problem with oath is you bound yourself with your own words. And then the devil, what it does, he takes the trauma, the new belief, the oath, you wrap it up and he hides it from you. And now you become enslaved to an invisible thing. And so you get girls like that that you know has been traumatized by boys, whatever, and then they're like, I'll never never get married. And then they forget about it. And then finally they they they there's this young men like, oh my goodness. Then they forget their oath. So they enter in courtship but they didn't lock down and courtship fails and they're they're they go in courtship for one month and then they back off and I don't know what's wrong with me. Every time he gets close to me I I'm like you know interestingly he's like a good guy but then when I want to open my heart doesn't work and I back off. And so the courtship goes from on off on off when when that happen there's something going on. You're fighting. You want to move but there's something like a leash pulling you back. I don't know that sister or that brother's weird. It's not weird. Something is going on here. I had to deal with those situation where you sit with the sisters. Okay, there's there's there's an issue there. And then you find yeah, my dad never got interested in my and and then usually it's related but but but you would you will find a trauma belief and oath. But how do we get rid of that? This is the great part because once you identify those things, that's where you need. So, uh, I got a scripture here I want to show you. The Bible says, "Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth." Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. So, a note is something we pronounce and then we forget. &gt;&gt; Death and life are in the power of the tongue. And we bind oursel when we make a note. I will never trust again. I will never do this. I will never open my heart. I will never trust anyone. All mens are bad. So I will never whatever it is. You bind yourself but then you forget you did it. So what we do when when we counsel people and I found all three it's amazing because when I found all three I'm smiling because I know freedom is just around the corner because it is so easy because and this is what psychology cannot do &gt;&gt; because we invite Jesus in the office &gt;&gt; and we invite the blood of Jesus because what's amazing is that the blood of Jesus this chloride can dissolve a note that you did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can and it works and it works. You can be set free from words you said, "I'll never, never, never." Whatever you said, you're not bound with it. If you bring it to the cross and you dip that oath in the blood of Jesus, it'll be dissolved. &gt;&gt; It'll be gone. You don't have to respect it anymore. And you'll have the freedom to move. All right? But how do we do this? How do we do this? We have to confess with our mouth. So salvation is that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth we are so we we're such a in intellectual people how do you call it where we brain we we say in French celebr is that we are we are mental we're mental I thought about you know I've been thinking and I thought I thought I know you're going to a trial so I thought about you well you should have called &gt;&gt; you should have spoke the word not thinking what what you know well I was in God's mind before the father. We we like the mind thing and but we we don't but the Bible is clear. Thou shalt confess with thy mouth because spoken word is powerful. You thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shall believe in thine heart. So it's inside. It's out there out in the mouth has raised him from the dead. Thou shalt be saved. For with the heart men believe it unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. So that same principle we apply to undo an oath. The prayer is so simple is Lord Jesus and you talk with your mouth. &gt;&gt; You take a moment. You shut the door. I don't have I tell the people I don't have to be there. It's not a confession to a priest. The only reason why I'm here it's because you're stuck. &gt;&gt; I'm a towing. Pastors also do a towing job. That's the only reason why I'm there. It's not because you confess to a priest. You came to me because you're stuck. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to help you because a pastor is a guide. I'm going to guide you out of this. And so sometime the trauma is so heavy that they cannot even pronounce the words. I says, "Do you think you can make this prayer on your own, brother Steve?" No. says, "Okay, if you can't, I'll lead I'll lead you to I'll lead you in a prayer and I'll make you confess things and say things that you don't feel the strength to say." So, close your eyes and repeat after me. Then then because I ask all the question, what did you went through and all this and and when it's it's something sexual abuse with a woman, I'm like, you don't have to tell your story to a man because you don't have to. You can talk to my wife. I don't need the details. All I need to know is how you felt and how you perceived that. That's all I need to know. And what did you believe after that? And what promise did you make to yourself? That's all I need. With that, I can lead you to Jesus in freedom. &gt;&gt; Sometimes they can talk to my wife in private to go to details if they need to. Then I just need a report on what what did it cause you? How did you feel? What I felt dirty? That's all I need to know. We can bring that feeling to Jesus &gt;&gt; because he's he feels for in our infirmities. &gt;&gt; He has the feeling. He feels for us. &gt;&gt; And so then the prayer is something similar. So I took notes of how they felt when it happened. And so Lord, it's a simple prayer. Lord Jesus, when I was that age, I was in that school and this happened to me. And at that moment when that happened to me, I felt in such and such a way and inside of me and then I use the word they use whatever they use the term my heart collapsed or I felt in danger. Whatever they use I use their own words and then Lord it broke my heart. It brought it into peace. I it got shattered. whatever they say it in their own words. But Lord Jesus, you you promise that you would heal the wounded spirit. You promise that you would heal the brokenhearted. I come to you with this broken heart. Sometime we want to present oursel to Jesus as a whole. I Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. We're all shattered, but we pro we come to Jesus like we're all good. We're not used to present oursel to Jesus in the way we are. &gt;&gt; That's also something we need to learn. You're broken. go to Jesus broken &gt;&gt; he likes that actually that's what he wants &gt;&gt; and then and Lord because of that I started to believe that I don't know all pastors and angels people whatever and I realized today that that belief is not true but it was caused by that he hurt I give you that belief but then Lord also I made a promise to self. And when you pray like that, most of the time it's not an easy prayer, there's silence. There's sobbing because it's it's a real deal. We're not make up stuff like we try to pretend we have a pain. We're talking about real issues of life. Stuff that I forgot. Stuff that they never Many people told me, "Brother Steve, what I'm going to tell you, nobody knows. My parents, nobody. You're the first one." I says, "You don't have to tell me. Like, I'm not a Catholic priest, but if it helps you, I'm with you. I'm listening if it helps you &gt;&gt; because then I can lead you so you can because some people a lot of people it's amazing but they cannot tell those things to Jesus with their mouth. They they they can't they don't even find the strength to pronounce those things because it was so hard and then said Lord I made a promise to myself that I would never and I realize I'm bound. I live in a prison based on my own words, my own oath and and I and I did that Lord in in in ignorance. But today I come and I I dissolve this in your blood. Can you come Lord and erase that oath? Change the belief and restore me. Restore me what I was before that Satan came and hit me. Lord, I pray in Jesus name. This is how we pray. And then God can bring you into freedom. &gt;&gt; And it works. It works because it involves the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; And it works because it it it involves the law of confessing of your mouth. &gt;&gt; Many time we go to difficult times and we pray in our mind. &gt;&gt; Lord help me. This has been difficult. But we think about it. There's not a lot of power in a thought if it's not expressed. Imagine if if imagine if God thought about Genesis 1. God thought about let it be light but light was not &gt;&gt; because he thought about it but he forgot to say it. &gt;&gt; We made it according to the image of God. So it's the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is it. trauma new belief oath. I hope it's helping. &gt;&gt; Hope it's helping. &gt;&gt; But it was it was it was life-changing even for me because I used to get stuck with those things not knowing what to do. Then when I realized I could come to Jesus and pray this way. So it's it's we need to be taught how to pray to resolve those issues. Jesus says come to me he that are heavy burden the scriptures we all know by heart but we don't know how to do it so we get stuck with our burdens and we cope and we try to make it true all right it's already late I've been an hour 17 minutes so we can we can stop here for tonight I don't know brother &gt;&gt; keep going &gt;&gt; keep going you've aspirated so okay I'll try to go quickly for Becky's story because I said it was a two-part you're really pulling. So we we linger and linger and linger and so we'll go to Becky. So we're changing the picture totally even though it's in the same theme. Okay. So how to resolve a crisis at home. So resolving a crisis at home. We're going to read the quote together. And what I'm going to do to save time is I'm going to give the cue the the the clues as we go. It's usually I read the whole story and then we go line by line. But we have to try to save some time here. So the prophet says, "I just went through an experience with my Rebecca." See, just committed to God when she got to be a little teeny and she was going with some girl when we first went out going run over to some girl's house taking music lesson. I come by one day and here this girl was sitting there at the piano playing rock and roll. Well, that was just enough for me. So, I told her to stay away from over o from over there and then she said, "Well, it's the only place I go to take music." You know how teenies get, you know. And I said, "Every kid has to go through that practically. Everyone goes through that age. You did. I did. First key." And we got to think their thoughts. So we're going to give all the keys as we go instead of all at usually I do at the end and we do it a full session with it. Even sometime what I do I did I think last the other year at the brother Eugene's family camp we read the quote and then I told the people what did you find in this quote and so it was fun. I was writing on the board and it was really a a good time but we're going to do it different tonight for to save some time. So the first key the prophet says we have to think their thoughts. So as I said most mistake we do us as adult as an adults. So you have a 10-year-old, you're a 30-year-old, you think like a 30-y old, you think as an adult, but you forgot that you were 10 once. And how do they think? How do they perceive what's going on and we try to put an adult or maturity on them? They they don't have it. So to to we have to stop and to go at at at their level. So then a few days after that, her mother got her after her for something and she sassed her. Now that's not Rebecca at all. She took off and slammed the door almost and knocked the things off the wall and went to school. So that's a rebellious spirit. So now you got a rebellious spirit on your daughter. Now if you remember diagrams, rebellious spirit is a spiritual issue. So when when you see that kind of behavior, right away if you're Christian, you're going, "Well, I discern my daughter has a re rebellious spirit." Well, good for you. You got discernment. But it's just the beginning of it. Why is she slamming door? Why is she boiling over? That's the next question which the prophet's going to solve, by the way. So the the mistake we do when people when our kids have bad behavior is we focus on the bad behavior instead of listening. We're like stop slamming door. We don't accept that this in his in this house. If you want to slam the door, you'll find another place to stay. Now we felt we feel good about oursel because I won't tolerate that spirit in my house. But what you did, you didn't solve anything. You probably sealed you probably locked their heart. When you do that, you lock them with that spirit because you dissoci in wanting to dissociate with from that rebellious spirit which your kid is associated to. you get rid of your kids at the same time &gt;&gt; and you lose communion. &gt;&gt; So you got to bypass the rebellious spirit for a season to try to reach their heart like Jesus did with Zakius. &gt;&gt; So she's slamming door. So the prophecy says, "I ought to have seemingly just taken my belt off and followed her in the yard and brought her back with ws around her." Well, it would have not fix anything. It would have locked Becky with that rebellious spirit and he would have lose contact with her for many years. So instead of running after her and beating her with a belt, which is not a good idea, especially at 18. Um, oh, and by the way, sometime I'm asked a qu like I've I've dealt with this spanking thing and I will give you just a quick example because it's not a difficult issue like sometime parents was like should we spank, should we not? And the question is not should we or should we not. And I will use the image of a cop. A police officer has different tools. And his training is how he needs to use those tool. If he does an intervention for someone, he's going to training to learn escalation &gt;&gt; in your intervention. So if if the cops stop you for speeding and I'll take the spanking as the ultimate weapon. So spanking is when you pull your gun and you shoot the person because I don't know what you can do worse than spanking after that you you won't beat him bring blood you you you you don't do more than that. Right. But if a cop pull you on the side of the road, what's the first weapon he use against you to show you that what you're doing is wrong? First of all, he will talk to you, sir. Do you know why I'm pulling you over? Like, he doesn't come with his gun, you know? Get out of your car. Like, what are you going to think? Like, he's like, man, are you crazy? Some parents we res we we go for the gun all the time &gt;&gt; and we don't even ask question. We shoot the car. Oh, sorry. My radar was off. Have a nice day. Okay. So, first of all, he's going to talk to you. Sometimes just the flash &gt;&gt; and the pulling over sometime before that. The other day I was with a brother, a minister, and we driving on the road. We're going visiting a church and I didn't realize I was speeding. Maybe maybe I don't know, maybe 25 or whatever. And I and I and I cross a cop and and I'm like, "Oh no." And all he did was flick his light, turned it off, and he never stopped. And just that my heart's like who ba. He didn't do much, but because he has authority, and this is something I did not understand when I was at a young age, I was pulling the gun on my kids all the time. I was I didn't realize because I never had a father. So, I didn't know that me as a father, just the fact that I look at my children, I'm disappointed in their behavior was already huge for them. Like, daddy's not proud of me. And that had a I didn't know the impact. I didn't even know the touching was important. And so my wife sometimes like, "Steve, you're too much. You're too much." So my kids were afraid of me. We had good moments, but when they did something bad, they never knew what was coming because I didn't learn the escalation. &gt;&gt; Imagine when you're speeding and and the cops shoots at your car. &gt;&gt; Imagine the level of fear. &gt;&gt; So that that time I just got the light signal. It's like, "Oh, praise the Lord." But sometimes you get the like signal. He turns around, pull you over, draw your window. Do you know why I'm pulling you over? Well, I think I maybe I was going too fast. Yes, sir. You were too fast. But you know what? I'm going to give you a pass today. Have a nice day. Level number two. Right. And just that is like, "Oh, praise the Lord. Such a merciful God." And it's and then you take the road again and and you know what? You learn something. He had he didn't have to shoot the car. He didn't have to put you in jail. Just that was just enough. &gt;&gt; But then his other weapon is that he flicks the light, turn, pull you over, talk to you, and then he takes his pen. That's another weapon. &gt;&gt; $300. Have a nice day, sir. All nice. All good. &gt;&gt; But you're learning &gt;&gt; now. If if he does that and you you get close to the car and you just slam the the gas and and then now it's a car chase. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When they stop your car, he's coming at you with a gun. &gt;&gt; And if you don't get out of the car and you try to draw something on the floor &gt;&gt; or you you you you press the gas to hit his car, now he's shooting at you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, it's not should we spank, should we not spank. It's that we don't us parents, a lot of parents like, well, the Bible says you don't spare the rod. It's like, yeah, I get it. I get it. &gt;&gt; But we need to learn escalation. And every kids is different. &gt;&gt; I would say that I've I've I've hurt my son. My son was the oldest. I have damaged this boy when he was really a young age. I've traumatized him because I didn't realize because I was not sensitive and because I was a in my fatherhood I was locked because obviously I was locked because I didn't have a father so I needed to healing in the fatherhood before I could be a father but I didn't know that William was a sensitive sensitive just the fact that I would disagree with his behavior was way was enough he didn't need more than that but I didn't know that when kids are small they're really sensitive. So, and then if they don't get it, we escalate slowly. Obviously, we escalate because we want to resolve these things. But my wife was so much better than me because I was focusing so much on the behavior. And my wife, I would get frustrated because I would escalate and escalate and I would yell and and I would and then then the kids like he's in panic and I'm I said I always said I would I would I would be really bad as a hostage negotiator because because they would they would shoot the hostage everyone because I don't negotiate and I thought that was a quality then called me to be a pastor that's funny. So I I needed to learn a lot because pastoring is negotiating. Let's reason together. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; but I was not negoti and Esther was so good. She would she would come in and and and I was watching and it would frustrates me. It's like she would be able to resolve things while when I was coming I was making a big it was a small thing. The kid just did a little thing and I was coming with my big shoes, you know. No, that's not right. Now you need to apologize to your sister. Now it's like and then he looks at you. He locks and then he doesn't say anything. I said apologize. You don't listen to me. And then it's like it's a small thing. But now the whole house is upside down. Now everybody's crying. I exaggerate. you know, it was maybe not that bad, but it's just to give you an example. When we don't know how to approach these things, we make it so worse. So, we need to learn, we need to love first, but we need to learn how we escalate if we need to escalate. So, the prophet is first reaction is, I'm going to fix this with my belt. And he says, okay, now let's not do that. I'm not pulling the gun on her because she slammed the door. You get the point? Yeah. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Wait a minute." It's a good and and we have to wait a minute sometime &gt;&gt; if we feel that's why we don't want to escalate or take an action in anger because most of the time we're angry and disappointed and because of those feelings it it it it it it messes up our judgment. So he says, "Wait a minute. I thought I got to think 18 year old thoughts. That's a key. I got to think what Steve, what did you think at 18? Well, parents are boring. Okay. Well, then that's what they think. So, let's accept that. What can you do now? So, mother, I know she started crying. Meta and I know you done all you can. I done all I can. Now, it's out of our hands. we have to take the next step. So now they acknowledge she's 18, she's slamming doors, we cannot fix this with spanking. We have to take the next step. So their assessment is changing. This is this is amazing. They re-evaluate their approach and the next step is she's 18. What can we do? She's locked now in that. She says, 'Well, look honey on me now. You've got to listen to me. It's hard for you to do this. I'm your husband. But people drive across the nation and around just for a few words of advice. Like all the world comes to me from an advice, but my wife's not listening to me. I talked to her the other day and she just walked away from me. Now, Becky never did that to me. So, even she walked away from Brother Brandham. And when her mother said something about it, she slammed the door and said, "You expect me to sit here and be a wallflower on my life?" So while she slammed the door, she's giving crucial information. She's actually saying, "What is the problem?" And the problem is said, "I'm stuck here. You expect me to be a wall flower all my life." So when there's a crisis at home, it can be your wife, it can be the husband, it can be your kids. When there's a crisis, a lot of time they're giving you the key. They're giving you what is the problem. But you know what parents do? Don't talk to your parents like that. &gt;&gt; And we we go on behavior and you're being disrespectful instead of listening to what they say. And so what we should say is that I don't really like the tone, but I get your point. I need we need to sit down calmly. So maybe let's let's cool off this. Let's not escalate more than is this right now. Let's let's talk tonight. Let's cool off. Go cool. I'll go cool. And tonight I I'll take it from what just because I found it interesting that you're saying that you feel like you have to be a wallflower all your life. So, we'll talk about that because I hear you and I care. If you say this, it's because you feel this way. And it's hard for sometime because again, in my mind, as an adult, I might think that's not what I'm causing. But if my kid is saying that, I'll go on you for a little while and see that reasoning where it comes from &gt;&gt; and we'll have a conversation on your ground, not mine. I'll go on your ground and try to figure out where did you get this? No, we like you're disrespectful and that's not true. Well, that's your world. It's that maybe is and we do that with our wife or we do that with our husband. &gt;&gt; Failure of communication is when two person try to be understood at the same time. &gt;&gt; Do you know to have meaningful conversation and to be understood one needs to be on listen mode, &gt;&gt; caring mode, &gt;&gt; understanding mode while one expresses each other. Is it? But what we do when we're fighting is while the other people is talking, we're preparing our answer. Failure of communication doesn't work. &gt;&gt; So we have to agree. Okay, I'm going to listen to you sincerely. Go at it. Well, that's not true. No, you didn't listen. Let me finish the whole thing. And sometime for us it doesn't make sense because a man's world, woman's world is different. We don't perceive things the same way. We don't feel the same way. And then we got to meet somewhere in the middle. Same thing for the children. So failure communication is when we are hurting and the other one is hurting. And both need to be comforted at the same time and to be understood at the same time and to be cared for at the same time. And nobody understand, nobody care and nobody heal. &gt;&gt; And we make the ditch deeper, wider. And we fail the communication. We fail communication. We fail communication until we end up in a ditch. So when there's a crisis, most of the time you will get crucial information. You need to listen. Then the prophet goes back when she was two years old. Becky was two years old. Andy then he says when she was two years old she uh I remember the first two years of her life she cried. We go in restaurant and eat and walk on her on the street while Mida eat and then I she'd walk while I eat. Just cried and cry. And one day up here in Canada cried all night and I couldn't rest and everything. We be standing there and something said to me, "It's the devil getting at your ministry." I said, "Hand me that baby." I said, "Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ, you take your hands off of her." She stopped right then and never cried no more. She's the quietest kid I got. From that very hour, it was gone. You have to get that. You have to get You have to have that in you though before you can do it. But mid about an hour I said may I take your hands off. So what he's saying is that at two years old a demon was attacking a two-year-old baby without free will. And so the prophet on dirty inspiration of God could cast that devil that torment the baby like this. But at 18 year old, he couldn't do it because that spirit is there because Becky allowed it. &gt;&gt; And this is something we misunderstand. We try that's what brother Fandler tried. He tried to cast the unbelief spirit out of his wife because she didn't believe the message. And prophet says this is not how we do it. Why do you cast spirit off people on the prayer line? Because they want that. if they want that because the prophet says if they worship that spirit there's nothing you can do. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; So when somebody is locked with an evil spirit caused by a wound or something, you got to work your way to with understanding and caring and and and and conversation and reasoning and try to win the person's will so they don't want that spirit anymore. &gt;&gt; It's tough. But we want shortcut. We like, you know, you know, I cast that spirit off of you. It's like, forget it. And we make things worse and we think we're spiritual. Well, apply the word. She's not listening. So, he's giving the example between two years old and 18 years old. It's not the same approach. &gt;&gt; You got the point. &gt;&gt; Important. So, there's so many keys in that quote. So he says, "May I take your hands off me?" Oh, sorry. I didn't move the quote. Sorry. So Satan, so two years old because I move here and don't move there. I should just close my iPad. So So it says, "Uh, may I take your hands off me? That's my kid." Well, he said, "Is it mine, too?" So both of them tried to understand each other and well, it's my kid. Well, it's my kid. pretty standard conversation between a couple &gt;&gt; and it's a blessing that he would open his house like that &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; like I open mine and I shared to you private information about my family but it's it's it's just to show that these things happens in in life and and and there's keys to resolve those things all right I said if she was dying this morning you have to commit her to God for her eternal destination. Why can't we commit her to God now for a hurt leader journey? Well, she said, "Well, that's my kid." Well, it's mine, too. So, they kind of So, how couple when we talk, we talk in circle. We're not going anywhere now. Can you take your me not say nothing to her? I said, I never said that, but quit scolding her. Just advise her. &gt;&gt; Well, here you go again. Well, and then it becomes such a negative atmosphere in the house. Every time we talk to them, it's about what they're doing wrong. Guess guess why they want to be out of there. Then he gives another key. She needs a buddy. And you're the one, the parents. You're the one to be her buddy. You and I, we're her parents. And these kids today needs a buddy. If they had a mother and a father would stay home and take care of them. Now we go to the care again instead of out there on Facebook or running barroom running around all night and things like that. It wouldn't have juvenile delinquency, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They got away from the Bible. They all went to church and men bonkong games and things like that. You're trying to polish up like Satan's ground up Hollywood. You could never bring Hollywood into the church. You've got I mean bring the church into Hollywood. You've got to bring Hollywood to your grounds, not go on their grounds. let them cover over for uh uh over there. We've got something they know nothing about. So we so we there got down on our knees and committed to God. I say I know she's 18 years old will be in a few days and she and I and a girl that age will think about boyfriend and we've kept her in. So when she says, "I don't want to be a wild flower in my all my life." The prophet admit, "I never wanted to see her get married." So she was right. She felt trapped and she was trapped. I want to put her in the office here to do the work. I want to see her filled with the spirit and live like that. So the prophet's plan for his daughter was she's going to be filled with the Holy Ghost. She's going to be my secretary and she'll never get married. That's what he says. &gt;&gt; That sounds like a great plan, but Becky was not buying it. So, the pressure and and I'm guess the prophet, you know, you know how dad we are. Now, I'm making this up, but that would be my style. You know, honey, you'll never get married. You got to work with daddy. You know that, sweetheart. She's like, "Yeah, I know that." But that was his desire. And every parents has desire for their kids. &gt;&gt; That's normal. &gt;&gt; But we don't we don't always have it right. &gt;&gt; So when she slams the door and says, "You expect me to be a wall flower all my life?" She is right. But he had to come to a point where she slams door and she becomes rebellious then to get some attention about this is a problem. &gt;&gt; I choke here. &gt;&gt; You get it? &gt;&gt; So parents sometimes does this mistake. You're going to study where I tell you to study. You're going to do that kind of career and you're going to and all the parents have all laid it out for their kids. &gt;&gt; It doesn't always work. Because when we do that, we break a rule which is called free moral agency. That's one of the first law. &gt;&gt; God made choices for us, but he waited for us to see it. But God is God, so he knew all things. We don't know all things. As much as I think I'm spiritual, I had to walk with my children to as they try to figure out what they're going to do in life and what they want. Unless I have a vision, &gt;&gt; which I don't. And I don't think the prophet had a vision about her daughter. He had a desire &gt;&gt; which is different. He had a desire for Billy Paul to take his place. Then it didn't work. He had a desire for brother Joseph to to carry the Bible to take his place. He had a desire for Rebecca. parents. I mean, brother Brandham was a human being like us also. &gt;&gt; He had desires for his kids. People turned those desires into almost thus said the Lord. May you be a prophet. That's what he said. May you be a prophet. That's what he told about brother Joseph. That was his desire. So he says, "Well, we all wanted that." She says, "Well, we can't do that." She just won't listen to it. That was not her calling. And it's funny because I'm touching on that and Brother George Smith is preaching on the other side of town right now. We had fellowship with him on Friday night. We had good time. I said, "Wait a minute. We've raised her all weekend. Now put her in the hands of God. Commit her." And I said, "Then when she does anything, says Becky, darling, mother, don't want you to do that, but I'm your pal. I'll stick by you." So that means whatever you do, I'm not going anywhere. I'll stick by you. And that's also another mistake when when when children start to do things that we don't like, we resent them. &gt;&gt; And and sometime it can escalate like, "Yeah, you want to have like you see this door? If you cross that door, you're not coming back. And then we make it we make it like we we say things out of anger. We go too far. &gt;&gt; We have to learn this is not how we approach those things. &gt;&gt; She says, "I'll stick by you. Let her know that you love her. She's going to get somebody to love her and it might be the wrong woman." Now in 1964 be find a love with another woman meant something but in 2025 it means another level &gt;&gt; if you get what I mean &gt;&gt; and I'm talking about real things now that we have encountered so as we've seen this morning when the love of the parents are not present so they don't care they seek love somewhere else &gt;&gt; this is exactly what he says let be the one who does the loving Because if the parents stop loving because the behavior behavior is not right because we use love as a manipul as a leverage. We do the silent treatment. We stop the fountain of love until they behave better and we teach them that love is conditional which is not God's love. God's love is unconditional. &gt;&gt; And we mix love with approval. And that's that's another mistake. We feel like if we show left to them, we approve their behavior, which is not what we're doing. It's like, I love you so dearly. You're my son. You'll always be my son. I don't like what you're doing, but I'll stick with you anyway because you're my son. We can love and disapprove at the same time. We can chew gum and walk at the same time. We should, right? We can multitask. I'm sure we can multitask. Praise the Lord. You be the woman does the loing. I said, 'Honey, that sound kind of crude, but people come everywhere and said on personal interviews and things. I said, I'm so common. We're common to one another because we're husband and wife, but we'll never let that happen. You remember this is the name of the Lord. So now he's going and telling her what what he's giving from advice right now came from God. So that approach is sealed also by a prophet. He's not just telling a testimony, but he says this is thus sayith the Lord. this is what we need to do. So this is serious. So she said, "All right." She knew better. If she says, "This is the name of the Lord." She says, "Okay, it's all right." We got down and committed to God. Said we'd take our hands off of it. That afternoon she come and she says, "Well, I guess you're still saying I ain't going over there." Meta said, "No, I never said nothing about it." I said, "You know, mother, don't want you to do that. So you don't approve." And that that's that's a misunderstanding. So modern day parents now they we they want to be so loving with their children. They think that love is to say yes to the kids all the time. &gt;&gt; No, we have to love in truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But this modern generation, they want to spoil the kids so much and then they they tell Junior, "Yeah, it's okay. Oh, yeah. You go." Yeah. And tell and give them everything they want. And that and that that creates monsters. &gt;&gt; No, we got to love and truth. Like, no. Like, I love you, but I don't think it's good for you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when they're old enough, like it's like it's your choice. You're 19. What? Like, lately had a conversation with one of my daughter and I like, "What would you do?" She's old enough. Like I could I could say, "I'm the father and and I decide, but she's 19." I says, "What will you do? What would you do?" I said, "You know what? On this, I will let you decide. Make the decision." And for me, it was a test to see what she's going to choose. &gt;&gt; I can see where she's at &gt;&gt; on little things. Little things just to see how does she measure stuff? How does she judge? &gt;&gt; What she's going to base it upon. And I just watch on little things. Right? We need to teach them at a certain age to start to let them making choices on small things and then they can learn. So later on later on they they so they can develop their own judgment. If we override their judgment called all the time all the time because we have most of the answers. So we can decide for them 247 until they're they're 20 if we want to. But we're not helping them &gt;&gt; because they're not making their own judgment. So we need to train the child &gt;&gt; not dictate &gt;&gt; train. It's a training. &gt;&gt; So you know mother don't want you to do and and I you know it like to kill your daddy when he heard you up there playing that boogie woogie music ever what it was where that girl said now he didn't want you to do that and we don't want you to do that Becky but we just committed to the Lord and I want you to know we love you. Whatever you do, unconditional love. Whatever you do, you can make all the bad choices you want. We don't approve, but we love you. It's unfortunate, but some Christian father, they almost disone their children because they're not serving the Lord. And almost like, don't talk to you. Like, don't ever come back here unless you're a Christian. So bad. Now he's like, I thought I was in a cult. Now it got confirmed, &gt;&gt; right? because you don't get out of a cult. You are ostracized. You are, you know, you are demolished. They demolish you when when you try to get out of church. But that's not who we are. And and and is it hard to see people walk away? It breaks our heart. But when people their heart is broken, sometimes they go too far in what they're saying. We should bring our griefs to the Lord instead of unloading all that grief on that person that's having a hard time or a bad time. So whatever you do, we still love you. It's tough. It's tough when our kids makes the wrong decision. It's tough, but God will give you grace. She hollered and said, "I'm going anyhow." Said, "All right, dear." So we went ahead said, "All right, I'll have supper ready when you get back." So she's can she can make a bad choice and return and have a meal. She never did go. Guess what? That's so that's another principle. When you restore freedom of will, &gt;&gt; they don't have to to block and to push and to affirm because now since they're free, &gt;&gt; since she was free, she didn't need to go anymore. &gt;&gt; So guess why she was going? She was going to try to claim her freedom she didn't have. But when her freedom was given, then she didn't have to go. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Is it amazing? &gt;&gt; Now, this one, this one seems quite easy. It doesn't always always go like that. Sometime it takes patience and &gt;&gt; and time, but it's not something we try. It's something that we are. &gt;&gt; She never went since. See, not long after that, she met George. George in town. George is a Christian. And that settled it. Then why did George marrying George settled it? Because that was her problem to begin with. She wanted to get married. So guess what? When she's allowed to marry George, the problem is fixed. &gt;&gt; You got it? &gt;&gt; So that's what we call a depth, a deep analysis of a quote, line by line. But you you you can go back and and and print. So you know sometimes that's one quote I give when when when when parents goes through difficult time with their teenager we have a discussion then as I apprent this I says study this study this because it is line by line almost like a protocol let it go give it to God and then we do that as parents but then the next day we take it back then we got to let it go again because it's not because you let it go yesterday in tears that three days later a lack of faith in it's like Peter he walked on water but he he but he he he went down also. So sometime we walk on water in a crisis and like we feel like oh god was there and I felt like yes and but then two three days later you see another symptom is like oh no no no they want to know it's not working this is not working. All right so may the lord bless you. I hope we we we we covered so much so much but I think it was it was a blessing to do it together. Amen. May the Lord bless you. Let's pray together because in all that without the Lord it doesn't work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those principle without God doesn't work. Without prayer it doesn't work. We need the presence of God with us. We need Christ in us. Because those principles is not just something we do. It's something that Lord wants us to become. We need to become agape love. We need to become unconditional love. It's not something we learn. It's something we accept and it's just something we become. Lord Jesus, we've covered so much. This group of people has been so awesome. It has been it has been a great blessing to walk through these teaching with them. And Lord, there's I don't I don't know this church and I don't know the people, but I'm sure every one of them, nobody's immune. If Moses went through these things and the prophet and even myself, everybody goes through that. Well, we've found so much precious nuggets in your word this weekend. So much things that we can draw from. And I pray that you give grace to everyone. the grandfathers, the grandmothers, the parents, the couple, the marriage, [Music] the children, the teenagers, everyone, those who left, maybe couples are separated right now, whatever situation, may your grace come down, Lord. There's people who they're going to go home and they will have a conversation with you, Lord, because they realize they could walk out of a trauma with the confession from their heart to through their mouth and bring it to you. You promise, Lord, to set the captives free. You promise to heal the brokenhearted. And we know Lord when you speak it, it's the truth. And you back every word you say. &gt;&gt; I pray Lord that you even through the preaching of the word, some got free. Maybe others they need a conversation with you. Close shut the door in their secret closet and have a deep conversation to reach touch to freedom. Inspire this church. inspire this new pastor Lord with his family. Bless them. Bless this church. I pray Lord in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Let's stand up in prisoner chain. [Music] Let's pray that night and in their pain began to see their chains were loose and they were free. I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you all. I give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. [Music] How if you should find that you're in a pre zone in your throne. Reach out and pray. [Music] defy those chains and they will fall in Jesus name. I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you all. I give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. &gt;&gt; One more time. I bless your name. I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you all. I give you praise. You are the life, [Music] the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. Praise be to God. Praise be to God. Did you enjoy it? Let's give it a hand to the Lord. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I did enjoy it. I did enjoy it from the bottom of my heart. I did enjoy it. So many so many good things. I did enjoy it. Wow. Wow. One thing I don't want to elevate a man here, but one thing we really had a prophet. &gt;&gt; When you look at that, then you see, oh God, we were really privileged to have a prophet &gt;&gt; in this last age. &gt;&gt; The end time message shall meet end time conditions. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a marvelous message of the hour. &gt;&gt; You look at it sometime looks so simple, but let the gift take the what the prophet says and expound it. Then you see, oh, how great message we have received. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the prophet of the age. Thank God for the anointing over the eagle. But the anointing of a pastor can take the eagle anointing and put in the pastor level and see the needs in the church. See the needs in the families. We needed that. I needed that and I believe we needed that. Amen. May God help us. Thank you, brother Steve. So many thing I could say but it's a personal thing. personal thing go home digest it make it your reality but the key one of the key and I think it came to me many times and it's the caring the secret of brother Bana ministry is love he loved the people and people knew that he loved them &gt;&gt; because he cared for them that was the level of of a of a prophet level of a of a of a pastor. If he love the people, if he care for them, oh, he might make mistakes, might, but they know that he cares for them. That's the secret for that level of the parents. Parents make mistakes. My parent made mistakes. Oh, but once I know that they care for me, they love me unconditionally. Oh, that's the key. That's the key because you don't you even friend when you have a friend it's because you think he cares for you right because he loves you he understands you but if that love you can find it in the parent then you don't want to lose that there's there's no price to that to that love that safety or knowing of someone cares for me someone loves me but as we heard today or sometimes we want to make that love negotiable. That's where we that's where we fail. May God help us. Amen. But the solution is in Christ. Amen. The solution is in Christ. When the tempter comes, when when Jesus comes, the tempter power is broken. We put the theme as a challenges. But this last service just saw how to solve those challenges. Oh, praise be to God. How to solve those challenges? It's in Jesus Christ. Do you know that song? Help me feel. And the sister is helping me. [Music] When Jes when Jesus comes, the tempest power is broken. When Jesus comes, [Music] the tears are up. The way it takes takes away and fills the with glory for his share. When Jesus comes to stay again when Jesus comes the temptor's power is broken. When Jesus comes, the tears are wondering. He takes the glory. His life with glory fall when Jesus comes to save. I'll try verse one. One sat alone. No. One sat alone. Beside the highway being his eyes were blind. &gt;&gt; He could not see. He touched the ram and shivered in the shadows. When Jesus came and bes [Music] when Jesus comes fills our walk the way he takes the gloom and fills the life with gloom. Glory for all change when Jesus comes to stay. &gt;&gt; How many can I have a testimony that before the services started you were different? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that you are ending the services, &gt;&gt; something has changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something has changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we don't want the devil to rob us from what has changed. No matter what we are going to encounter outside, I want to stay with what I've learned, what God has taught me, and something has changed in my life. Not to try, but I want to become what I've heard. Amen. Can we make that decision to the Lord this evening? Let's sing Way Maker. Way maker. You know that song. Way maker.

I don't say just to make the the service long. I know we are tired maybe, but just think about the things for a moment as the music is playing just softly. I'm giving just one minute maybe just just to think deep for what we have heard. Lord Jesus Christ, sometimes the problem is not the other person. Sometimes the problem is me. My heart has deceived me Lord Jesus Christ. But help me Lord. Help me to humble myself. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. Help me Lord Jesus Christ to remove my ego. Help me father Lord to have that unconditional love. Help me Lord to be able sometimes to agree to disagree to give the free moral agency to the other person. But I still love him. I still love her. Oh God, help me to be that savior. Help me to be the one that can do the work of redemption. Oh God to be on the side of the one suffering but for the purpose of redeeming the other person. Oh God help me Lord help me. Might be my marriage, might be the church, might be in my family. Help me to be the one doing the part of redemption with that love. Lord grant it. Lord bless your people. Father Lord &gt;&gt; bless the church. Lord have been patient. Father, we you know the needs among us, Father, and they have been patient and bless them richly, Lord.

I missed to thank the church but he got it and thank the church for for the potluck. That was very good. Right on time. Thank God for that. So I appreciate you for all the sacrifices that you made.

We want you to be free every for one week. Just teach us. Teach us. God bless you Rich. That was wonderful. Amen. [Music] [Applause] Brother Brent, I will come I'll call you to close the service is uh is one of the reasons maybe also to put me uh he invited me to the camp. I uh uh I was blessed there. It was a challenge and I said no I can't keep it for myself. I have to share that with the church and he's the one who invited me to that camp. So Amen. God bless you, saints. Good to be in here together. And God bless you, brother Steve. Enjoyed that tonight. I've heard some of those things before. He's like, "You're going to hear it. You've already heard this stuff." But you know what? There's just always something. The Lord will always open up, turn over another rock here, another rock there. Amen. There's just always something that we can learn and grow. Amen. Amen. God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, Lord, we just come before you this evening, Lord. Just thank you, Lord, for the gift that you've placed in our brother Steve's life, Lord. And many times these things, it's not just study that brings it. It comes from from pain that he's endured himself and and struggles in his own life and and scars that he's had to work through and these things. He's speaking from from experience and many of these things. And just seeing what the Lord has done in his life and his family is such a testimony. I've always appreciated that just seeing his family, Lord, and how you've just worked through him and you've he's led his family and it encourages me as a father myself, Lord, that I could each one of us as fathers and mothers this evening, Lord, and husbands and wives and even young people that we can take these things and apply them to our life. And just so many times, Satan tries to take these things that we've endured and and hide these things. And that's where Satan can have that stronghold and and whether these traumas I just find it so interesting this morning I was laboring myself on just talking about an open door and the open God you've given us an open door. You said, "Come up hither. Come up higher for us, each one of us." But just as you've called us up higher, Satan has opened up doors. And he uses open doors to bind us through these traumas and these things in our lives. But I pray this evening that these doors have been blown open, Lord. That you've called us up higher. that Satan's stronghold that he would be defeated in our lives that each one would take this and as we go forth from this place just go with us and your spirit would be present in us. We love you. Bless each and everyone here. Brother Moses, his heart I just uh real privileged to be here tonight. Lord, we love you. We want to thank you. Go with us. We pray. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask all things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Can &gt;&gt; God bless you richly. You are dismissed. &gt;&gt; Brother Steve send our greet. We send our greetings to the church, the family. God bless you richly. Amen. appreciate you. I love you. I know you bow down before you see she left. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
