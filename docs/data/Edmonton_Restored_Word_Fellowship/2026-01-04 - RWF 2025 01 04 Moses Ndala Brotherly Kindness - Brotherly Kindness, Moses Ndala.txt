We love you and appreciate you Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. invite you as we go [music] to our studies of a statue of a perfect man is a scripture and as we are going to the last virtue. Thank you musicians. God bless you richly and um the last virtue before the capstone is the brotherly love and brotherly kindness. Just want to read that on first Peter chap 2 second Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 verse 7 to save time and to godliness second Peter chapter it's towards the end as I hear your Bible turning it's a good sign I like I I I like the real Bible. The physical Bible not always sometime we have on the phone sometime helps but also like the the physical Bible and uh one time one brother said you know what if you are in the train or the public bus or anything if you're just reading your Bible on the on the phone no one knows what you are doing but when you take the real Bible &gt;&gt; then people say oh that's that's the real thing. One time I was going to just came to my mind. I was I was going to London and I I missed my plane because I wanted to see my wife, you know, when you're in love just so I forgot about the plane. So, no, I can miss it. And then and I missed it and I went back to get another one. Say, "Okay, sir, you missed it." I said, "I know I missed it." And so, okay. So, what how much I pay? I was willing to pay anything, you know, in love. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; paid anything. I can pay anything whatever price it is. And I said, "Okay." And the person was I had my Bible in my hand like this. And the person was so sir um what do you I see you're holding a a holy book. Say yes sir. So because because you are holding that holy book, not going to pay anything. Just promise me that you are going to read it. Said yes, I'll read it. And I took my flight back. Thank God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Second Peter chapter one. Chapter one. Yeah. Verse 7. And to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. And if these things be in you, not only be in you, but if they also abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he that lackth these things is blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. Wherefore the rather brethren give diligence, give diligence to make your calling and election sure. So give diligence, make an effort that that you make your calling and election sure, real. Because if you do these things, not only if you believe these things, but if you do these things, then you shall never fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless his word and the reading of it and give us the context of the word this morning. Personally, it has been a long trip for for for this study and thank you for bearing with me and on this long study as Pastor Zigg told one time you you have plenty of time. You don't have to rush. Just take your time and thank you for just we just took our time almost almost one year on this topic. I believe it has been a blessing to you. Personally, it has been a blessing to me just to revisit those things and to have a balance in the things and just strengthen my faith and my walk with God and my desire for that to become reality. Not just to be in the book, not just to be in the message, not just to be put there. No, but I I want it to be reflected in my life. I want that to be a reality in my life. The prophet said one one place he says the Philadelphiaian church age was the Methodist church age the church age of brotherly life the reformation says when rank Calvinist has sprang up in the Anglican church in England where they didn't have a revival no more went planned off into haste god God raised John Wesley as a legalist to take the Armenian doctrine sometimes it's good to have the balance on the sometimes we just things but I want I like when it becomes practical that's what brings sometimes a revival amen so we are going to talk about brotherly kindness for a few months prophet himself didn't take too much time as in the message of the statue of a perfect man and myself I was wondering why uh uh it's why why talk about brotherly kindness why speak about Bradley Khan. It seems like a tiny thing and but but strange enough it it is the virtue for our age is the virtue for the Laudisian age and brother Banam is the messenger of Laudian age. Amen. And says but strange enough that that that's where we should be that where we should that what should be uh that was the emphasis and I was I was personally I was thinking about it why is it so important? Why brotherly kindness so important in our age? I see why why the prophet had to emphasize in in other messages what is in relation to it. I I I'll confess maybe with you that maybe tomorrow it became more real to me and oh I see why I see why I see why it's important. Amen. So we just want to go lead into that this morning. And so why do we need filio? The question that I'm just trying to answer myself is why do we need fil love when we are just about to get agapa love? Why do we need your love when agapa love is the most important one? Why do we still need fil love? The prophet says from for that but let me tell you a little secret. The most powerful force in the world isn't speaking in with tongues or interpreting tongues or being honored by God to be a minister or to be an evangelist or to be a prophet. The most powerful weapon that I've ever found in my life is love. Amen. &gt;&gt; It says the says that's the most powerful weapon is love. Amen. that says the fio love the fo love which the Greek word comes from friendship like you have for your wife there is a difference it will make a mother for that for that baby run through a blazing fly fire fire or life means nothing that fill your love but what will aapo do says the godly love we must love divinely love one another then you don't see your brother brother's mistake anymore says if he does make a mistake take you never you look over the top of it you love him anyhow say that is love those who that love you that doesn't then does not does not the sinner it says love those that love you then does not the sinner do the same thing but love those who doesn't love you that's what shows the spirit of God is new amen because he loved you when you were his enemy and he loved you and if That spirit is in you, it will make you love your enemy as you do your friend. So divine love makes you makes you for forgive your brother and see behind his m beyond his mistakes. It makes even you pray for your enemies. It makes you love them. Makes you uh focus on the eternal life. Amen. So that's the most important thing. I don't want to to to to belittle that. That the most important thing is a power love. Amen. And that's what we desire to go and that's what we desire to go and that what we desire in our life. And another place you will say many times the church gets that mixed up and they're trying to apply feel love which means friendship to be like agapa love but there is a difference. If you love your wife as you should and some men would insult your wife you would kill him because you would be jealous of her. That's what fio love would lead to. But agapa love will make you pray for his lost soul. That's the difference. So the attitude of expression is different. The feel of love will maybe just go and because of jealousy because of because you and and and actually you should be jealous. I mean it's not like you you just whatever it does to your wife and you just ignore it. No, you you should be you should be jealous. Something should happen in your heart. You should not become indifferent. Uh I remember one time I preached and says um brother Bham says that but don't don't don't try to insult my wife. [laughter] You will be in trouble. You might see the other face of myself. So that's still true and but the reaction how you react and I pray that my reaction doesn't just not become connal becomes is measured and it comes with love. You look at the consequences you help the other person to understand. Amen. So the the so it's there but and it should be there brother I'm say you should love your life you should have the feel of love but should have the feel of love but the reaction it need to be under the power of the agapa love amen &gt;&gt; so let's first of all let's give them let's give the definition of that brother has already defined it but the Greek word for the brotherly love says is Philadelphia is brotherly kindness which literally love for for brothers, love for for sisters. The brother love comes naturally when there is a connection often easier to show to people you like or you know it involves feelings of closeness and mutual care. That's so so so real and so important. I mean I I love you all. I love all the sisters and and brother says all the wonderful sisters I have here and the beautiful and good character and everything and and I love you all and I want everybody to be saved and everything but there's still only one that's called my wife. So there is still one that called my wife. She goes with me and there is a is a portion of love that is there that is different from the other sisters that and that that's the filio love and it has to be there. Amen. Praise be to God. It has to be there. And if you see that, so there is a character of a spiritual love, but there is also a a natural love. It looks like a natural life, which is a filio love that also needs to be there in the believers among the believers. So the love for your brothers, the love for your sister has to be there. Every man, if you go outside here, let me tell you, if you go outside here, you love any sinners that pass. You should love any sinner because you have a gap love. You should love it. But let me tell you there is also a different love from those who are here in the church. &gt;&gt; You should it should be the the what makes you love those in the church more because there is a closeness. There is a connection. There is a relationship. There is there is a mutual contact. There is there is something that MAKES YOU CLOSER THAN OTHERS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE IT HAS to be there. You can't just say no I love you with a gapa love. Yes we should love everybody with a gapa love but there is something that should be put people a little bit closer when and you need that affection. You need that brotherly kindness. And brother Vanam was so we might go to brother Vanam was so so so against denominations. Even though everybody was Christians, they didn't have that closeness. They couldn't fellowship with one another. &gt;&gt; Even though they were just saying, "No, we love one another." But they couldn't fellowship one another. And Ban says, "No, I hate denominations because it bringing barriers. It brings separations. It doesn't bring people closer." Amen. I want PEOPLE TO BE CLOSE. I want people to have connections. I WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE INTERACTIONS. IT'S PART OF THE STATURE OF A PERFECT MAN. YOU CAN'T JUST IGNORE IT. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY, "NO, I HAVE AGAPA LOVE." YES. BUT YOU NEED THAT closeness as well too. &gt;&gt; Now agapa love comes now from the agape and it's translated in the King James version is a charity. It's self-sacrificing. It's unconditional. So you can say it's like a power. It's unconditional. Whether you are sinner, whether you are brothers, whether you have to love them. God has put that you have to love them. But let me tell you the example of the brothers. If someone hurt your wife or hurt your children and you forgive them with a power love, but let me next time you will be a little bit more careful to leave your children next to that person. &gt;&gt; That's right. If you don't, there is a problem. &gt;&gt; That's my opinion. There is a problem. You'll be a little bit more careful. Okay, I love you. I want to be saved and everything, but you know, let me be careful. Let me watch your attitude. Let me see how you change. Let me see your character. Let me see how things are. And it has to be there. &gt;&gt; The same thing as well for the church. So, so there there is there is a portion of a life that has to be manifested that above that that that that unconditional love there is something that you have to entertain to make sure that the affilio love is maintained as well and that part is is is it comes I believe it comes by interaction by closeness by communication by connection that's that's what the the definition of a brotherly love for your brothers and sisters. Like in your family, WE YOU ALL LOVE EVERYBODY, but the love for YOUR BROTHER IN MY family is still a little bit different. I'm sorry to confess that, but it's still different. And I'm sure it's the same for you. He's a believer. Especially when he's a believer and he's in the family, there's just something he can call me at any time and then why they just he's my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if is so disconnected and no connection then it becomes like okay then uh okay [clears throat] amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in simple terms brother love is I love you because you are my brother and my sister and agap love I love you because God loves you. Because God doesn't love the sin but he loves the sinner. So you love unconditionally. So important agapa love is a greater love and is a more mature love. But we still need to make sure that we have the feel your love. Amen. Why in the stretch of a perfect is to have one than the other after the other. You can look it for yourself. And as I said for that said in first John 4:20 says if a man says I love God and hateth of his brother is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother from whom he had seen, how can he love God whom he had not seen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you need to love your brother. You need to love your sister. And that of the way you are loving your brother, the way you are loving your sister shows that you are loving God. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY CAN SAY I LOVE GOD. But if you don't love your brother, don't love your sister. WE START DOUBTING YOUR LOVE. &gt;&gt; WE START QUESTIONING YOUR LOVE. ACTUALLY YOURSELF SHOULD BE QUESTIONING. Not even others. Yourself should be questioning that love. Am I really loving God the way I say I love God? If I don't love my brother, if I don't love my sister, GOD, HELP ME. CHANGE YOUR CHANGE all those feelings. Remove the bitterness. Maybe there is a spirit of unforgiveness that is there. Lord, remove it. Help me to love my brother. Help me to love my sister. &gt;&gt; Prophet will now I'll just go to what the prophet said. The prophet says in the in in the message here, I just read this. It says let's add the Bible says just a few few quotes from from brotherly love. Adding brotherly love. Brotherly kindness. Now that's a good one right here. The six seven. All right. Adding brotherly kindness. When we get to that brotherly kindness, it put yourself put yourself in his place on the matter. So if you have a brother, if you have your sister, you put yourself in the place on any matter that the brother who the sister is going through. My brother sinned against me, said Peter. Shall I forgive him? He said seven times a day. He said 70 times seven. See brotherly kindness. Now you see if a brother is all out of tune, don't be impatient with him. No, no, no. Be kind to him. Go hang out. says somebody said not letting go said how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the assemblies of God and to oneness and all rest of them you see putsy brotherly kindness hoping someday see patient within see temperant enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes remember it it is in his heart that what is virtue in yourself is to let it go out with kindness and meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring him in. So for me the definition of body love is when you can put yourself in the place of the other. You can have compassion for the other for the other one. You feel affection for the other one. You feel compassion for the other one. You can stand in the step of the other person. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe for me brotherly kindness or brotherly love is the same and a gap love is the same relationship as faith and works. If agap love is present towards God, it must show itself in how you treat others. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you really love, you have the agapo love, it has to be expressed on how you treat others. You can't say you have a gap love and if you don't still express the love in the affection way there is a problem. You can't say I love God if you don't love your brother first. Imagine if you say to your wife that just to those are married. If if that my wife I love you, I love you with a gap love but no expression of love. No sweetness, no taking care. &gt;&gt; No buying some some something. Woman needs some buying. &gt;&gt; No buying something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would say she start doubting your gap. Even though I'm sure you are lover with a gap love because you want her to be saved but if you don't express it in certain ways there is a certain problem &gt;&gt; prophet says you need to express your love towards your wife &gt;&gt; towards your children you need to express it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her that in filio the prophet says how about in a gapo to God how can it be if you don't love God if you said you love your wife and never tell her about it brothers it's important to tell your wife you love her &gt;&gt; don't just remind her you know that 10 years ago when we were married I promised you that I loved you no that's not It's good to repeat to your wife, I love you, honey. &gt;&gt; You are so beautiful. &gt;&gt; I still love you. The older I'm getting, I don't see things, BUT THANK GOD I DON'T SEE THAT. I STILL [screaming] LOVE YOU. You need to make the love refreshed and and and and good and nice. DON'T LEAVE THE HONEYMOON only for 10 and 20 years and 40 years. Make it fresh every year. Renew it. Make her make her your queen. Oh my &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; your wife is the best gift that God has given you &gt;&gt; after salvation. So you take care of her. She's she's God's God's daughter. She she's a she's a princess in God's eyes. So you take care of her. You you you make sure that she she's she's brother. She's she's flourishing. Where's brother go? She she she she she's enjoying her marriage. &gt;&gt; Just put in natural. You take you take someone's daughter to make her miserable. Oh, &gt;&gt; it just doesn't make sense. Yeah, &gt;&gt; someone who grew up with her father and siblings and she was happy and you one day you present yourself there and you know on the first few days you are very nice and everything and then once she comes your house you start mistreating her and that that just human not even a Christian that not even a Christian just a naturally it doesn't make sense you you need to love her she she she's a human being she's not an object she's She's not just for you as an object. No, she's a person, a full person like you. So you treat her, you take care of her, you make sure that she she's happy where she is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If our wives are happy at home, we will have some in the church. SOMETIME WE DON'T HAVE IT BECAUSE THE HUSBAND IS always a military man AT HOME AND YOU WANT HIM TO REJOICE IN CHURCH DOESN'T WORK BROTHER. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO WORK. &gt;&gt; MAY GOD HELP US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; She's a weak vessel. She has a temperament and emotional or all that. It's well known. I don't like TV shows and everything but I think I was at my sister whatever I don't have a television at home so but they were doing some some some jokes at some point you know switch wives you know just take for one day and see how they doing so you think that your wife is the worst you just want the other wife okay just one day just for during the day how she's cooking and then they switch the wives then just the other one is cooking then realize this one is also actually worse than my wife [laughter] she's leaving things dirty she NO NO NO GIVE BACK MY wife [laughter] Satan is sometimes playing on us right do you think that you just see THAT SISTER AT CHURCH [screaming] THAT ONE should be a beautiful sister good WIFE OH NO SHE HAS THE SAME PROBLEMS AS YOUR JUST LOVE HER, EXPRESS HER, make her feel comfortable. I always say if Christ made us and gave us the authority where we are today, we are the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we claim that we are the final voice to the final age and all the authority has been given to us and all that we claim in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; But it's Christ taking us in our weakness in the WAY WE ARE &gt;&gt; UNWORTHY AND WE are preacher. If we really believe is for Christ then we should do that the SAME THING FOR OUR WIVES. &gt;&gt; LOVER AFFECTION LOVE BROTHER LOVE WITHOUT FILL YOUR LOVE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BUILD MARRIAGE ONLY WITH AGAPA LOVE. &gt;&gt; NO DOESN'T WORK. &gt;&gt; So sister I'm going to read what the prophet says in this situation. wife you be submitted to your husband in the situation that WHAT YOU HAVE NO SHOW LOVE CARE TAKE CARE OF HER AND BABY HER IF you can &gt;&gt; English word they say baby so it's really your baby [laughter] French we don't use that one time my first time my wife talk to me call me babyh I'm your husband how can you call me baby when courtship so my baby is I'm not your baby I'm your husband I'm your future husband then as you grow in the culture okay the English people call the sweetheart baby or that okay okay [laughter] we had a little bit of tension at the beginning so it's your baby and now I like to be called maybe. [laughter] &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's part of it. Feel your love. It's important. Amen. If you never tell her about it and never sit down and [clears throat] and make love to her, express it to her, kiss her, hug her, hug her in during the day. Can I believe it? My my children know me. We run in the house with my wife. She doesn't like me to hug her, but I'm running. KIDS, YOU SEE, MOMMY DOESN'T LIKE TO HUG AND THEN MOMMY, HOW YOU [screaming] DON'T LIKE YOU? DADDY to hug you. Then then when I catch her, I hug her. Give her a kiss. &gt;&gt; Women are like that. They always run. But you just run after her. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Makes them appreciate. It's okay. It's fine. As a Christian, the prophet touch on those element. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's important. &gt;&gt; Can't just focus on agapa love. It's good and it's mature. One day prophet says on the other side there was no filio love anymore because there was no there's no glands anymore it was just aapar love and that's where we uncondition love and that's where we are aiming and it's important but don't neglect also &gt;&gt; brotherly kindness feel your love it's part of it &gt;&gt; and if you never tell her that she's the best cook in the country. Hey, when you get invited somewhere else, that's nice, sister. Hey, but in your house, never say, "Sweetheart, &gt;&gt; come on now. &gt;&gt; What you are cooking is so nice. I enjoyed it. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. Thank you very much." But no, just just other places. And the wife becomes jealous. She become frustrated. Then you call pastor or the deacon, paratender and it goes. No, no, no. But maybe start for the few small things there. &gt;&gt; So sweetheart, I love what you cook today. &gt;&gt; Oh, beautiful. &gt;&gt; I'll say sometimes even you you you make it you exaggerate it a little bit. It's okay to exaggerate. &gt;&gt; It's too salty. Don't say it's too salty. It's beautiful city. It's okay. It's okay. Is it okay? Oh, no. I Let's just go restaurant. Sometimes it's good to bring her to the restaurant, too. Once in a while. Not too much though. But once in a while, bring her to the restaurant. Make her the rest. Let her have a little bit. You have a sweetheart and give her a little bit of a restaurant. She enjoys that time. And so she feel loved. If you love a wife, she will produce that love more than what you expected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A woman is a womb. Whatever you give her, she multiplies it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you give her a little bit of love, she will multiply that love more than you can expect. So it's important to love our wives &gt;&gt; and our mothers. So all the things that you know and how pretty she is, how pretty she is, it's good to emphasize to your wife. Sometimes to our daughters, those that made the the girls to be loved and be appreciated. The prophet says it's important to tell, "Oh, you look pretty, you're beautiful. This is a nice dress." If a sister dresses long dress and nice decent dress, you never say it's pretty. The next time she dresses a little bit and she goes on the street, oh hey people look at her and then draw attention then you're so wondering why why you according to the word of God you should dress properly. Yes, but it also need to be expressed. Oh, you look beautiful today. That's so nice. Oh, I love it. Oh, thank you. Did I buy that? Oh, no. I just bought it myself. Okay. I'm preaching but I need to leave that as well. May God help me. Amen. &gt;&gt; How much you love her. If you don't do that, she'll never know it. That's the way. If you do love her, you express it. &gt;&gt; That's the way we do to God. When we love him, we tell him about it. We sit down and we adore him. We worship him. See, love drives us to that. And what if something has got to be done for your wife? Well, it will throw you into desperation to get it done. What if somebody says your wife is got cancer? If somebody says your wife got TB, she's fixing to die. Yet you will do anything. See, it will throw you into desperation. The same thing as well has to happen to our brothers and sisters. If if [snorts and clears throat] there is a problem or there's a need, we need to express that through the love. It need to be expressed. brothers you know I miss you the church I don't see I didn't see you I miss you where are you and that connection needs to be there &gt;&gt; if there is not that connection no I can say you can't just say I have agapa I want them to be saved no it need to be expressed it need to be shown it need to be manifested it need to be it need to be need it need to become real as if it was expressed with feelior love even God himself loves us loves us with agapa love but God loves us also with filio He's express it in in a way that is tangible. Amen. Romans 12:10 says, "Be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love in order preferring one another." So brotherly love is not something to ignore is important of part of the statue of a perfect man. Is actually the platform for which the agapa love will come upon. Without brotherly love, the agapa love cannot come upon it. So it is important to have both of them. The prophet says in the super sign I think that the most and the granded word is the grandest word is love. It's broken down in two different words. The love that's called filio love that the love that we have one for another the natural one. And then there is a gap love which comes from God that the godly respect and love. I'm so glad to be here in this fellowship this afternoon where both phases of love is operating fellowship one with another and the love of God shared abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. So the love of God is the most important thing the love of God but you see there are two phases. So the fellow love is one phase of the love of God. &gt;&gt; It's fellowship one with another. The prophet says it's important that we have fellowship with one another. We can't just rely on the love of God shed in our heart by the Holy Ghost. In it need we need also one phase which IS FELLOWSHIP WITH ONE ANOTHER. AMEN. WE NEED FELLOWSHIP WITH one another. It's important to have communion. It's important to have fellowship. It important to have interaction. Amen. A church that doesn't have interaction I would say it's just a political a political group we I I'm part of many I grew up part of many groups you know many groups we are part of it we just inter you there you listen a little bit of here and after that after the meeting is over and I close it and I go back my home I have no interaction people I just want to hear that BUT THAT'S NOT HOW IT SHOULD BE WITH CHURCH NEED INTERACTIONS YOU NEED TO SHAKE HANDS YOU NEED TO FIND OUT ABOUT YOU HOW YOU DOING AND EVERYTHING FINE? I CAN I HELP YOU? YOU NEED TO HAVE THAT INTERACTION OTHERWISE IT'S NOT A CHURCH. &gt;&gt; It becomes we we we can make we we we can make this we CAN WE HAVE A CHOICE EITHER TO MAKE THIS A CHURCH where believers are having fellowship real fellowship or it becomes just a clan where we meet sometimes here and there. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Like you go to the university class, you just in that class you listen to a teacher. He teaches he teaches you and that you have not. Then you go to your own on your own room and then you continue your life. But that's not that's not church. No, there's no there's no fil love there. Do you have a gapola when you go when you go to that classroom? Yes. You want all of them to be saved. You still love them. You don't you don't you don't hate them but you don't have fellow love with them necessary. No, there's no connection. You just listen to a teacher and you go home. But that's not the same thing for church. We are brothers and sisters. WE ARE PART OF THE [screaming] FAMILY. WE ARE PART OF THE ONE BODY. WE SHOULD HAVE INTERACTIONS. YOUR STRENGTH IS MY STRENGTH. YOUR WEAKNESS IS MY WEAKNESS. IF YOU ARE WEAK, I'M ALSO WEAK BECAUSE I'M DEPENDING ON YOU. YOU ARE PART OF THE SAME BODY. AMEN. YOU CAN'T SAY READING THE word of God, YOU CAN'T SAY THIS ARM IS NOT PART OF THE EYE. WE ARE PART OF THE SAME BODY. WE ARE PART OF THE SAME CHURCH. YOUR WELLBEING IS MY WELLBEING. YOUR I WANT YOU TO BE GOOD. AMEN. I WANT YOU TO PROSPER BECAUSE &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T PROSPER, I'M NOT PROSPERING THERE. AMEN. WE ARE PART OF THE SAME CHURCH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Feel your love, affection alone. Feel your love is a phase of love. They say feel your love alone fades when people disappoint us. It avoids sacrifice. It depends on mutual feeling. That's true. Agapa loves carry when feel love runs out. Without the expression love everybody can hide behind the agapa love claiming that they have the agapa love. Without the filio manifestation I would say the agapa love could look impersonal. The Bible say Jesus loved Lazarus and his sister personally. John 11 I look it up. John 11:36 that said the Jews said behold he loved him. He loved Lazarus. That love that was a filio love. But Jesus is divine. But he had a filio love. He had interaction with Lazarus. When Lazarus died in the tomb he cried. It's expression. It has to be expressed. You have to he he he put himself in in in in their shoes in their situation like a human being. IT HAS TO BE PART OF IT. OTHERWISE, WE'LL BE HIDING JUST BEHIND AGAPA AND AND WE DON'T EVEN HAVE it sometimes but we just say WE HAVE IT. NO, IT HAS TO BE EXPRESSED. HAS TO BE SHOWN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SOMEONE who's in need you you it has to be shown. YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE. SISTER, IS IT OKAY WITH YOUR FAMILY? MY BROTHER, IS IT OKAY? Is it fine with your job? IS IT? &gt;&gt; IT HAS TO BE PART OF IT. [screaming] AMEN. &gt;&gt; The Bible says John 5:20 say the father loveth the son and showed him all things that himself do. Look it up in the Bible. FILO LOVE. GOD HAVING filio love. Think about it. It kind of blew my mind a little bit because I thought God is only agap love. Yeah, he expressed it with filio love, too. It emphasized the fellowship in affections. John 16:27, for the father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed. We have believed that I came out from God. That one was also feel love. It was a relationship closeness is a friendship. Jesus affection shows that the father loved him. It has an expression towards him. Not just a duty or not just a commandment, not just a a something that is that is not being manifested. It has to be manifested. So brotherly kindness is is part of a Christian virtue. One more time, it's growing out of godly character leading towards agapa. Like I said earlier, it's a platform for the capstone to lay on. It was the virtue of the Laudisian age. We are in the bright age but it was the virtue of the loudian age. Without heat it the capstone could not find a platform where it could lay on. So it's just so important. Amen. &gt;&gt; And from here we can go different places but we have made it a habit just calling brothers and sisters. And I just want to say here when you say brotherly love is a brother is a is a love for your brother is a love for your sister and sometimes we have make it just calling brother and sisters as a habit and we lose the meaning of it but if you really take a moment to think about it is my brother is my sister we have a little bit of connection to natural it's like in the when in the in in the family body when is your brother when is my sister as my brother was here I will tell tell you when this was at my place I felt so good that my brother in the flesh was there I felt happy I felt good if the same thing can be also for the brothers in the church as really my brother my real family I think we'll come to a certain level that is a little bit higher &gt;&gt; we will become less indifferent to one another &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; because sometimes we become too indifferent right oh that's just his problem that's just know that we we we lose that connection between oursel &gt;&gt; sometimes sharing brother I'm a shy person it doesn't look like it but I'm a shy person I'm a very shy person or maybe I used to be shy and I feel embarrassed I'm not necessarily a contact person but I'm making an effort making an effort to greet you and ask you and a little bit of time and maybe I I lack words and I'm not a communicator as a per se, but I'm making that effort because it it's part of it. I realize it's part of it. You have to connect with people. You can't just say, "No, I'm too spiritual and stay on my corner." No, you have to connect with people. It's part of it in order to put sometimes sometimes there people who some people who calls me more than others in this church. I would tell you I feel so connected to them than others. It's just normal. Not I don't love you but they just oh I'm there with them. One pastor brother Boris said the sheep that cries the most. I don't know if they say that the sheep you take care of the most. &gt;&gt; It's just natural. And thank God it's part of the statue of perfect man. If there is no connection, you just you you just become okay. Okay. But when there is that connection, it brings bonds. It it it's it firm. I'm encouraging the church to create that connections. &gt;&gt; Thank God for what we had on the 31st. It was good to have that connection. It brings us closer. It bring us as a family. We know each other a little BIT BETTER. IT'S PART OF THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; A CHURCH CAN'T BE STRONG WITHOUT THAT CONNECTION. You can't be just alone by yourself. I'm just a single. I come here and I and I disappear. Just wonder is message f don't know your name. We don't know anything. But but when we'll be in eternity we spend eternity together. [laughter] &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; we are missing something. &gt;&gt; Thank God for bringing the balance on Lord. Brother Baram, brother Baram liked connection. You remember brother Bam says you know for his wife talking walking with the wife and the other one say hello sister Ma sister she pass says she greeted you. Yeah I responded I just I just smiled said what's that? That's that's not real. She she greeted you and greet back. &gt;&gt; HELLO, HOW ARE [screaming] YOU? EVERYTHING IS GOOD. Praise be to God. No, just and then you say and easy. Oh, she need a silly green. He call it a silly green. That's you need a real handshake AND SAY YEAH. HOW ARE YOU DOING? GOD BLESS YOU. PRAISE BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; Take it up in the message. Many times he says, you know, oh brotherly love, we used to have it back then, but we don't have it anymore in our churches. We don't have it anymore. We found out that the other the the neighbor died. We find out in the newspaper. &gt;&gt; We don't know what our neighbor is going through. &gt;&gt; That's in a nutshell. But also in our church sometimes WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE going through. &gt;&gt; But then we will find out one day you know I was going through this. I was going through this, you know, no, no one cared for me. Huh? No connection. YOU ISOLATING YOURSELF AND &gt;&gt; BRING TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; BRING TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; I HAVE I'M GOING through this. I'm going through this problem. Can you pray for me? We pray for you. It brings connection. We feel part of one another. We move together. YOUR SUFFERING IS OUR SUFFERING. IF WE ARE NOT MATURE YET, HELP US TO GET MATURE SO THAT WE FEEL THAT. WE NEED THAT AS WELL. &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T JUST BE LIKE A CHURCH. THERE IS NO PROBLEM. WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS, BUT WE ARE HIDING IT OURSELVES. NO, I DON'T KNOW. But you're not helping yours to move around. &gt;&gt; Maybe your PROBLEM IS TO HELP ME TO FEEL COMPASSIONATE. &gt;&gt; If I don't feel compassionate, GOD MAY GOD CORRECT ME. &gt;&gt; We will find out two years, five years after that. That's not I think we are missing something. &gt;&gt; That's my point of view. I think we are missing something. So it's more than just a group. I'm sorry. Said sometimes in the church you can have a church within a church. There's a church as a body and people can join. That's true. But there's also a church where there is also a little bit of connection and people feel together part of the family and I want that to be part of the family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we so this is my family we will spend eternity together &gt;&gt; as as brother Andrew said one time if we can't if we can't spend a little bit of eternity here &gt;&gt; where what eternity are we going to spend together? &gt;&gt; So true. Brother will talk the order of resurrection. says I I know the people I know and I'll be the final voice to the final age when I'm being my my resurrection will bring the resurrection of the other one the resurrection of the other one that the other resurrection it's going backwards right from what the people you know you know you know you know so if there is no connection there's no knowing &gt;&gt; what resurrection are you going to be just your own resurrection but there's no backwards resurrection &gt;&gt; wow &gt;&gt; no connection the believer's position in Christ. The same spirit that was in Christ is in you and in me and you are fellow citizens. Oh my, that's the word I want to be playing around in Africa to get fellow citizens of the spiritual kingdom. Citizenships, aren't you happy to get into in tonight? We are citizenship. We are citizens of the same kingdom. &gt;&gt; We are part of the same kingdom. Amen. Whether nationality sometimes in the natural you are born here, you are born here, you are born here. That's not the most important thing. The most important thing we are part of the same family in Christ. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I don't even like that express you know and and and it's getting around now. Sometimes I hear from this no restored word fellowship is the church of the congalles of the church of the Africans. No, that's not the church of the Africans. That the church of believers. &gt;&gt; That the church of Christians. We are all citizens OF THE SAME KINGDOM. THERE'S no Congali. There's no Zimbabwean. There's no Ghanaian. There's no Nigerian. There's no Canadian. There's no German. WE ARE ALL CITIZEN OF THE SAME KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE PART OF THE SAME BODY OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; MY SISTERS FROM COLOMBIA, WE ARE ALL PART OF THE SAME OF THE SAME KINGDOM OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHY sometime you know I I sang on sang the song in French last I I had it in my heart for a long time. I mean yeah but some I I want the whole church to benefit. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we we want everybody to benefit. It's not only French. It it lingual. YOU CAN SING IN THE but make sure that when you are singing, you make EVERYBODY ELSE BE PART OF IT BECAUSE IT THE SAME CHURCH FOR EVERYBODY. WE WANT EVERYBODY TO BE EDIFIED. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ONLY ONE PART, NOT EVERYBODY. THE CHURCH OF ALL THE NATIONS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Is it okay? &gt;&gt; We don't want division in the church. We don't want clans in the church. We don't want a group of only this. This is a group only of Filipinos. This is a group only of of of Congalles. This only Zimbabwean of Ghanaians. No, we don't want that. No. No. It's the WHOLE CHURCH FOR JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; It says I belong to the Baptist church and in that spirit was going the banana was so against it. We are all working for one place. I belong to the Baptist church the assemblies to the oneness to the the threeness or the fiveness or whatever it was. We want to be working for one principle. That's for our heavenly father to get bornag again Christians into that kingdom up there. It's not about group. It's not about ethnicity. It's not even by your preference. You know that in this church we have many we have many Catholics. We have many Baptist. We have many Pentecostals. We have we have different groups in this church here. But they are born again. &gt;&gt; They have been changed. means by that I mean you you are sometimes inclined to certain things. I call myself a baptist born again because I like fundamentals. I like teaching. I like that that's my way. I'm made up and I am but there are some people that are Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Born again. They like the shouting. They like hallelujah. They like oh yeah when it's their time I'm also joining them. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are some people just metalist [laughter] that moment for them too. Sometimes a song of and sometimes you see me sometimes I cry. I I I become medist at that time too. THANK GOD WE ARE ALL [screaming] OF THE SAME GROUP. &gt;&gt; Don't form any spirit of clan or any spirit OF DIVISION HERE. NO BROTHERLY KINDNESS [screaming] AMONG US &gt;&gt; TO MAKE A PLATFORM FOR THE CAPSTONE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But says a true minister to call the church one big body. A true minister will never draw lines. Just because you don't believe with me, you're not in it. No. We all recognize one another as brothers because Jesus died for all of us. &gt;&gt; Jesus died for all of us. So we don't want any division. Amen. Amen. Sometimes we defer on our gifts. We defer on our functions. We defer on a on a way of expressing one another. And it's okay. Jesus Christ did not pray. This is my note. Jesus Christ did not pray for for for for uniformity that everybody to be the same way to speak the same way to have the same tonality you know that's not how he called us to be and we can never be the same Andrew and Peter were different Peter was just the one who is exuberant and andrew was a little bit was calm and everything but both of them were part of the kingdom of God your nature you can be a little bit quiet the other one is more EXPER AND THANK GOD AMEN &gt;&gt; SO NO, NO, NO. I DON'T WANT THAT. GO THAT CHURCH, AFRICAN CHURCH. A LOT OF NOISE. You are missing something. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE JUST EXPRESSING THE WAY THEY ARE. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. LET THEM EXPRESS THE WAY THEY ARE. [screaming] AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE ALSO AFRICANS WHO ARE QUIET. &gt;&gt; Me and brother Abel. We are VERY QUIET. WHERE'S BROTHER ABEL? &gt;&gt; WE ARE VERY QUIET BROTHERS. AND THAT'S HOW WE ARE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But he called us to be one. to be one. &gt;&gt; Not to have uniformity, but to be one. Amen. &gt;&gt; John 17:11 says, "Now I am no I am no more in the world, but these are in the world that I come into thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom you have given me that they may be one as we [clears throat] are." We want to be one. The love of God will bring us to be one. Amen. &gt;&gt; That they may all be one. Thou Father art in me and I in them. That they also may be one in us. that the world may believe that thou has sent me. The glory that which thest me, I have given them that they may be one even as we are one in them and thou in me and they be made perfect in one that the world may know that they have sent me and I loved me and I love thou has loved me. How will the world know that we are Christians when we have love for one another? &gt;&gt; It's not how when we teach one another. It's not how we know more than than others. No, the world will know when we have love for one another. &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO EXERCISE THAT LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER. IT'S IMPORTANT to exercise that love for one another. &gt;&gt; Brother love allows us to appreciate different callings without jealousy. Recognize sincere believers beyond denominational doctrinal lines. To walk together in humility while still growing in truth. Amen. So 1 Corinthians 12, he put it very well. 1 Corinthians 12 comes before 1 Corinthians 13, which is the charity, the agap love. But he's stressing in 1 Corinthians 12 about the gift about the the love. Listen to what he's saying as you bear with me. If you can go that I just go through this this this the scripture I think is the one that that summarize everything so well. So there are diversities of gift but the same spirit. 1 Corinthians 12:4. There are diversities of gift but the same spirit. There are differences of administrations by the same Lord. There are diversities of operations but it is the same God which workketh all in all. So it's God in the song service. I believe it's God in the deacons. &gt;&gt; It's God in the Sunday school &gt;&gt; teachers. It's God in the ministry here. Different gift but the same God. AMEN. THERE'S NO ONE THAT IS GREATER THAN the other. WE ALL NEED ALL OF THEM FOR THE CHURCH TO OPERATE. There is we need you your special when there people singing specials here. THE MUSICIANS WE NEED ONE ANOTHER DIFFERENT GIFT BUT THE SAME GOD AND WE RESPECT AND AND CHERISH EACH GIFT IN THE IN THE BODY OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And he says but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit without. So those manifestations are for us to profit. For to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit, to another faith by the same spirit, to another the gift of healing by the same spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirit, to another diverse kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these work of that one and the same all these work of that one and the same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will. You know sometimes we have made mistakes in the past where we have overemphasized only one gift. &gt;&gt; You know the message went through two phases right at some point in during the during the day it was only one gift. If you don't preach like my pastor preaches, I don't feel the anointing. &gt;&gt; And we made that gift that oh that that that's the gift. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, oh, everybody has oh miracles. IF THERE IS NO MIRACLES, NO, THEN THEN THEN WE EMPHASIZE ONLY ON THAT AND WE MAKE it I would say we make it a a a a denominations &gt;&gt; because it becomes just the focus of everything. It's important and I want IT AND WE DESIRE IT and our church we have it &gt;&gt; BUT WE NEED TO HAVE ALL OF THEM. &gt;&gt; SOME OF THEM just they have wisdom. Some people just have the gift of wisdom. Some ministry can be built just on the wisdom and and he's just advising and giving a small that's the way it built and if that the way it is PRAISE BE TO GOD &gt;&gt; ALL OF THEM WE NEED THEM. IT'S NOT ONLY ONE GIFT THAT THAT HAS TO TO BE THE TOP OF ALL THE OTHER GIFT. NO, WE NEED ONE ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE PASTOR is he is IN GOD'S EYES. THE ONE brother say the one place the one who got saved yesterday is important in God's eyes &gt;&gt; as the ministers. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just got saved yesterday. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is as important the ministers have been for 40 years &gt;&gt; in God's eye. But you know why sometimes we try to make one bigger than the other one? No, we just need one another. &gt;&gt; The prophet says discernment of the spirit. There is so much in the day that we live in pertaining to gift. So many people judge people by gift that they have. And I always say sometimes it it gift can be deceiving. You can have a gift but you don't have a relationship with God. &gt;&gt; And you just rely on your gift and you think you are saved because of that gift. No, &gt;&gt; salvation is not based on your merit. It's not based on that free gift of natural gift you have. No, you still need the blood of Jesus Christ. You still need to be born again. Even with that gift, even if you have a good preacher, I'm I'm just talking to myself. If you're not a good preachers that people don't see, I'm pointing to them. You have a good preachers and anything, but you still need the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some people have just the gift of healing. &gt;&gt; And I' I've seen that in my life. Just just pray for a simple prayer and you're healed. Oh, how many people flock that and and then sometimes they distort the word of God &gt;&gt; but people don't see it because they see just the gift. &gt;&gt; Oh, but you are being this there is there is a there is there is there's probability to be deceived there. No, the gift doesn't confirm. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's the word of God that confirms the gift, &gt;&gt; not the other way around. So don't be deceived by gift. Even those who have gifts, don't be deceived by the same gift you have only. You you need to work on that gift. You need still to have brother say every gift is a ministry. You need to pray. You need to dedicate yourself. YOU NEED TO SANCTIFY YOURSELF. THAT WORD IS CONFIRMING THAT GIFT. DON'T neglect the gift that INSIDE OF YOU. HOW CAN YOU NEGLECT that gift? IF YOU DON'T PRAY, if you don't read the Bible, if you don't consecrate yourself, you are neglecting that gift. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So many people judge people. So many people judge people by the gift they have. Well, I believe that these things are gift. I believe that we see take place is gift and they are Godgiven gift. But if we if we do not use them in the right way that God intending them to be used, then we can do more harm with the gift than we could if we did not have the gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh God, help us. &gt;&gt; Help us so that we use those gift for your glory and for your honor. &gt;&gt; Not to exalt ourself, not to not to prove ourself, not for our own popularity, not not to be loved, not no that's not how God give the gift those gift is to glorify God and God only. Amen. Good thing that he says in that message the discernment of the spirit says if I had discernment of spirit enough to know that's wrong no matter how great a teacher is how powerful is how intellectually is or how his gifts operate if it isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of Christ your own spiritual discernment will tell you that that's wrong no matter how accurate how perfect how it is it's wrong if it isn't used for the body of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; to achieve something. Maybe it's God a great gift that he could draw people together with a great intellectual or a spiritual power that he could draw people together. Maybe he's trying to take that gift and make himself famous so that you will have a big name so that other brethren will look up to him as some big person said that's wrong. Maybe he's trying to edify a certain thing here that he wants everybody has to get out of the picture and let him and his group be the picture. That's still wrong. &gt;&gt; But if he has a gift of God and he's trying to edify to edify the body of Christ, I don't care what he belongs to. We are not discerning the man. We are discerning the spirit, the life that's in the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what God has told us to do. Not at one time was he ever commissioned to discern the man group, but he was constrained and commanded by God to discern the spirit in the man. What he's trying to do, what the spirit in his life is trying to lead him to. And when if we can find out that he's trying to lead the people, not to break them up, but to bring them together, to bring the church of the living God to not all to one denomination, but to an understanding, a fellowship, a unity with Christ. That was my prayer, Lord. I don't want to bring people to me. I don't want people to love me because of my natural character or anything. No, I want to bring people to you, Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm a unique. I have no seed. I have no life on myself. &gt;&gt; I want them to receive your life, your Holy Spirit. Father, I want to prepare them for the rapture. I don't have power to rapture any person. YOU, LORD, HAVE THE power to rapture THEM. IT'S YOUR BRIDE. IT'S NOT MY PEOPLE. LORD, LEAD YOUR PEOPLE. FATHER, GIVE THEM THE HOLY SPIRIT. HELP ME JUST TO BE THERE AS A HELPER TO EDIFY THEM. BUT IT'S YOUR PEOPLE, LORD. &gt;&gt; BLESS YOUR PEOPLE, LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And if I'm staying a little bit away, help me to bring me back in the right balance. &gt;&gt; I'm a good listener. I will listen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I want people to be part of the fellowship with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Says the spirit that's in him, no matter what move it belongs to, the spirit in him is trying to point the people to Calvary away from himself and away from anything else. But his only achievement, he has to point them to Calvary. He doesn't care whether he's even n or not. Doesn't care whether even his own movement, which is fine. It's good if he's a Methodist, a Presbyterian, a Roman Catholic, whatever he wants to be by denomination. But what he's trying to do, the purpose of his heart that he's trying to get, then you can see what's in the man's life. Whether he his motives for his denomination or whether it is for himself, whether it is for the worldly fame, whether it's for big names to say I predict that come just exactly to pass. So someone can say I predict that and it just came to pass. So I'm the one you see that's a wrong right there to begin with. But if he's trying to use what God has given him as a teacher, as a prophet, as a seer and etc to edify the people and bring them to Christ, that's the most important thing. &gt;&gt; At the same time, the victory day says, "Brother love, we should have for one another and understand one another and to love one another and to worship with one another." They sometimes people they degrade a man because of his clothes. he wears the education he has the color of his skin or something like that. Therefore, it separates the people and makes them off take them off of that. It never gives the unward man a chance to operate. We are in tune in soul, body and spirit. Jesus came to the Samaritan woman. She almost missed it. Says, "Why are you talking to me? You are a Jew. We are Samaritans. We have no relationship with you." It's as if you knew the gift was this is just talking to you. &gt;&gt; Go beyond the nationalities. Go beyond the things. Go beyond the culture. Go beyond the color of skin. Go beyond all those different things. Go beyond all that brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Then you can see the Christ in the brother, the Christ in the sister. Amen. Beyond all that. &gt;&gt; And you have you have you have the spirit flowing through you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we look at the natural things and oh may God help us. Amen. Brother love, closeness, connection. If you take those gift that we have now, we say in a good way and use them correctly and orderly in the church, this little church will grow like everything. &gt;&gt; And we want this church to grow like everything. But let the gift of God operate correctly in the body of Christ. We brotherly love with divine love. All that together. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12. But as the body is one have many members and all members of of one body being many are one body also is Christ. For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body. Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, see his workers. Whether we be born or free, have be all made to drink into one spirit. For the body is not one member, but many. If the foot shall say, "Because I'm not the hand, I'm not of the I'm not of the body." Is it therefore not of the body? If the ear shall say, "Because I'm not the eye, I'm not of the body." If Is it therefore not of the body? If the whole body was an eye, where where were the hearing? Just imagine if your whole body was just an eye. If the whole were hearing, where this where were the smelling? But now, as God said to the members, every one of them in the body as he has pleased him. If they were all one member, where were the body? But how are they many members? yet by one body. If the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee. Nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Name much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble and necessary. And those member of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our undily part have more abundant candiness. Sometimes that's what we think. I'm I'm I'm not I'm not useful to the to the church when I'm there. When I'm not there, there's no difference, you know. [snorts] Nobody cares about I'm just nothing. Oh yeah. Thank you for that humility. Sometimes don't put that humility too far. &gt;&gt; The church needs you. &gt;&gt; The church needs you. Like the part of the body you don't Have you ever hidden sometimes one of the fingers? You don't care about it. But the day you hit now, now you realize that every time you move anything, it connect with that one. Oh. Oh. Oh. So it's that important though. I didn't know that I was holding this until Oh, that's so that's God when looks at us, he needs each one of you in the church. WHY DO YOU FEEL LIKE IMPORTANT not important? There is a PLACE FOR YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE A BLESSING FOR SOMEONE ELSE. &gt;&gt; This is something that is boiling in my heart. Maybe I might preach this is the message influence. &gt;&gt; You are always influencing someone. &gt;&gt; Always whether you don't sometimes you are not aware of it but you are still influencing someone. Now think sometimes we take some actions in our lives here. We think that I just myself I did it and then it's okay. No it is repercussions because someone was watching you and you have been influencing her. What if what you are doing everybody has to do what you're doing? What will be the church? &gt;&gt; I always ask my wife and sometimes I just think about what you're doing. If everybody in the church was doing what you're doing, &gt;&gt; what will be the church? If what I'm doing everybody was doing what I'm doing, what will be the church? Influence one another. Part of the message. My life influences you. Your life is influencing me or is influencing my kids? Is he influencing a teenager? So this always that may God help us. For our family part have no need. But God has tempered the body together, having given more abundant honor to that part which lackth. that there should be no schism in the body, but he that members should have the same care one for another in brotherly love to care for one for another. Amen. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; May God help us. Give me a few more minutes. We're closing soon and get there for some part I won't touch but says God oh God if we have to take every miracle now read again the scripture verse 26 where the one member suffer all the members suffer with it one member be honored all the members rejoice with it now we are the body of Christ and members in particular and God has said some in the church first apostles Secondly, prophet. Thirdly, teachers. After that, miracles. Then gift of healings helps government diversity of tongues. The prophet says, "Oh God, if we have to take every miracles out of the church, if we have to take all the pipe organs out and the flash pews and give us back to and give us back to that godly love, brotherly love among the people and fellowship. If we have to do all that, take it back to that again. life life once again said that's not life some people is brought to a place to get him drunk and then it goes on then it says another place says divine love says we have faced a day when it prophesied that the brotherly love will be a strange thing among people now this crying it becomes selfish life &gt;&gt; becomes your own life your own own myself my my my myh I don't care becomes a separate isolated and everything loud life. No brotherly love anymore. My brother, my sister, no only in words, not in action. Says, "Prophesy that the brotherly love will become a strange thing among people. It's to my humble belief that there is the greatest of all the gift that there is in God's Bible. If the Lord Jesus should stand on the platform tonight and look me in the face and say, "I'm going to give you your choice. You be a great person, a great minister, I'll give you a gift of preaching the gospel. I'll give you the gift of teaching the word. I'll give you the gift of divine healing. I'll give you the gift of prophecy. I'll give I'll make you a prophet. And any of the fine gift of faith, any of the gift that's in the Bible, I'll give them everyone to you then. But then I will withhold love from you or either I'll give you love and withhold the gift from you. I would say Lord take all the gift and let me have the love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See for no matter how many gift we got, they will never do us any good except the love of God. The motive behind the gift we must have love. But then as I see this great day appearing that we are now living in where listen now where the selfishness and indifference among people, human beings, tribes of the earth, it grieves my heart. It grieves God heart when we have that indifference to one another. Sometimes ourself we we may God help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And bring that divisions and talking to Corinthians. at the church that were saying you know we are from we are from Paul we are from from Cifas we are from this and we are this and those are great men good men and one of them said I mean some of them say we are for Christ we are only for for the tapes just looking for them trying to find divisions Bible says it's only for denominations no it's also in the church in message churches it's sometimes there too we try to make it the prophet says the devil doesn't want you to be united. You want to make cleans out of it. Clenish the spirit. But if you see that come no now come bind yourself together. Pray for that brother. Pray for that sister. MAKE YOURSELF ONE. AMEN. PRAY FOR ONE ANOTHER. BE UNITED. GOD MAKE US ONE in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This is where the selfishness and indifference amongst people, human beings, tribes of the earth, it grieves my heart. Amen. I'll finish with this thought. The restoration of the bride tree as said the first thing that the Pentecost produced was brother love. Brother love Jesus said musicians can come already. I'm pray softly as I'm reading this. Says it down the middle war of partitions and made a brotherhood to such a way that they had everything in common. I mean the Bible says a brotherhood. Paul spoke of this brotherhood and he gave all the gift of the Pentecostal church. Then said in 1 Corinthians 13, "Though I speak with tongues as man and angel, I have not this love which brings the brotherhood. I'm nothing. And though I have the knowledge to understand all the mysteries of God, I'm still nothing without the love, the love of the brethren." Jesus said, "This will all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one for the other." &gt;&gt; Amen. They will not know that you are my disciples when you have the message book. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; That says, "Oh, this is a message Buddhist must be a Christian." No, that's not that way. They say they will know that you are message believers when when when when you speak a certain language or speaking. No, that's not that. It's when we have the love for one another and not only love in words but love in expression, love that is being manifested, loving that is being shown. Amen. Praise be to God. As as as a brother Andrew said, it just be a token, a public thing that is shown, that is visible, that is is real. We we are we are tired of words. &gt;&gt; I I don't want words only that doesn't have a life. I want a real life expressed. That's what is the most important thing. God, make the love of God real in my heart, manifesting for another. Remove remove that indifference. Remove that indifference. &gt;&gt; Make me be the one caring for the others, caring for one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. says in the same message the restoration of the bride tree. So Jesus spoke this and said Paul this said rather let brotherly love continue. Can I just consume a little bit here? &gt;&gt; So Pentecost is it's a long quote but let me just read it. Pentecost had I'm speaking Pentecost meaning the first group of apostles and disciples they had a brother that wasn't greedy. They sold everything they had for the furthering of the church. They were so together till even one heard the other one died they says let us go and die with him. Such a feeling. Now Jesus spoke to this and says all this says rather says let brotherly love continue brotherly love continue that was in the first church but something taken place and there was a fellow come in by the name in the former world and when he began to eat that vine of brother-in-law that was no he says no that that that that insect came the first thing that he had to take in the church was that brotherly love, that connection, that feeling to one another. Once you remove in the church, it becomes only a political group. &gt;&gt; You can say a few words and everything, it becomes a political group. But we need that love and connection for one another, brothers and sisters. THAT'S WHAT MAKES US A CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So when begin to eat that vine of the brother love he cut the very sap line of it because it doesn't make any difference how smart we are how much we think we know how much we want to be different from somebody else and as long as that brotherly feeling isn't among us we are fighting a losing battle that's right we can't win there is no way for us to win if there is not THAT BROTHER BUT THANK GOD, GOD HAD A PROMISE. I WILL RESTORE. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR &gt;&gt; THAT CAME TO RESTORE THAT BROTHERLY LOVE, THAT COMMUNION AMONG [screaming] THE BROTHERS AND WE HAVE IT. AMEN. THANK GOD. ONE BROTHER CAME HERE AND I ALWAYS I always remember what he said. He told us, "OH BROTHERS, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE IN THAT LITTLE CHURCH. THAT LITTLE CHURCH IS SO UNITED. THAT RESTORED WORD FELLOWSHIP IS SO UNITED. THANK GOD FOR THE BROTHERLY LOVE AMONG US. THANK GOD FOR MAKING US ONE FAMILY. AMEN. AND I'LL SAY THE SAME THING EVEN IN YOUR OWN FAMILY WHERE YOU ARE.
