Summary of the Sermon: “To Be Found In Him”

In this sermon, Brother Stephen begins by reading Paul’s words in Philippians 3:8–15, where Paul declares that everything in life is worthless compared to knowing Christ, and that his great desire is “to be found in Him” rather than trusting in his own righteousness 

Brother Stephen emphasizes that even though Paul had deep spiritual experiences—including being caught up into the third heaven—he still confessed that he had not yet “arrived,” but continued pressing forward in his relationship with Christ. This becomes the foundation of the message: the Christian walk is a continual journey, where God leads believers step by step into deeper truth and greater maturity. Just as daily bread was part of Jesus’ teaching (Matthew 6:11), Brother Stephen reminds the congregation that spiritual growth requires fresh daily surrender rather than resting on past experiences.

The sermon then stresses the need to follow the Holy Spirit without resisting the steps God places before us. Even when believers have read the message or the Bible many times, new understanding comes when God reveals what is needed for the present moment .

Brother Stephen warns against becoming distracted with material worries, reminding the church of Jesus’ promise in Matthew 6:33 that all necessary things are added when the Kingdom is put first. Drawing from the life of Paul again, he urges the congregation to desire above all things to “be found in Him”—not caught in personal ideas, pride, or worldly pursuits, but hidden fully in Christ. This includes rejecting self-righteousness, recognizing that every victory and every change in our lives comes from God and not our own strength.

Brother Stephen then turns to the theme of perfect faith, using Brother Branham’s teaching from Perfect Faith where the prophet said that substance faith isolates a believer from the world and brings them into “bride material” ...

And [music] I think that's all the singing that we'll do, sister. Thank you for the song service this morning. Sure appreciated it. Enjoyed the specials. Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles. We're going to turn to chapter 3. Brother Sig was doing such a good job up here. I was hoping he was just going to carry right on and very familiar scripture to us. I think by this time in our walk with the Lord, there's not too many scriptures that aren't become familiar to us. Amen. But the more we hear them, the more we fall in love with the word of God. Amen. Just before we read, why don't we just bow our heads together in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, you have given us this opportunity to be together. Lord, gathered with saints of like precious faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, our desire this morning is not to come and be seen of one another, but Lord, that we might come into your presence, oh God. That we might be seen of you, Lord. And that you might look down upon us. And because Lord, you know our needs, oh God. And you know our trials that we are facing. And Lord, you know the the struggles. You know the way we are made, Lord, because you have formed us, oh God. And Lord, you molded us in this way that we would be the person that we are today. But Lord, we know that we have not yet arrived, Lord, where we want to be. We have not yet arrived, Lord, where you are bringing us to. For Lord, if we were at that place, we wouldn't be here in this body of mortal flesh this morning. But we would be on the other side rejoicing with the saints. But Lord, we believe that you have gathered us here this morning because you have something more for us, oh God. Because you want to take us deeper into your word. And Lord, as the Apostle Paul said, Lord, his desire was that we would know the depths of the love of God, the breadth of it, the height of it. And Lord, it is our desire to know you in that way, Father. Lord, you have opened your word to us in this day, Lord, as we have received the message of the hour. And Lord, we are just wanting to know you in the way that you desire to re to us. And Lord, we know the only thing that hinders us from going deeper with you is ourselves, oh God. And we just want to get ourselves out of the way, Lord. And Lord, we are our own enemy, Lord. And we just want to lay down this flesh. We want to lay down our carnal ideas. We want to lay down our own mind and we want to put on the mind of Christ. And Father, we just desire tonight that you would this morning that you would come and that you would just take the reading of the word and that you would anoint it. Father, bless the reading of it and bless the hearing of it. Lord, bless each one that has come this morning, Lord. And may you just take us into your presence this morning and of life. We pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ. A &gt;&gt; amen. Let's read from verse eight of Philippians chapter 3. It says, "Yay, doubtless I count all things but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God, by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection &gt;&gt; and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death. If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead, not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded. &gt;&gt; Amen. And may the Lord add his blessing to the word. You could have your seats. I want to speak this morning. If we were going to title the the service this morning, we would call it to be found in him. &gt;&gt; So Paul Paul is saying here, you know, we look to Paul as the example and brother Brandham looked to Paul as the example. And when he went on the other side and and he was caught up onto the other side and he seen the saints there and and he said they they he was gathered they said you're gathered with your people and and you'll have to give an answer for what you have said and and he said well will Paul have to give an answer and they said yes Paul will have to give an answer also. And and he said well I preached just what Paul preached &gt;&gt; and they said we're resting on that. We're resting on that. So, so, Brother Brandham looked to Paul as an as his example. He looked to the word and and the way that first church age messenger went out and and went with the with the the truth of the word, not compromising, not straying from the gospel, not uh turning right or left, but just staying with the word of God. And and that was his desire. And now Paul even being that example, even as he says in one place, being caught up to the third heaven and seeing things that he that it was not lawful for him to speak of and and all of these things that he saw yet he says it's it's my desire. I I don't run as though I have already attained. He saw things that we did not see. He was caught up into places that we have not been caught up into. So if anybody could say I've arrived, Paul could say I arrived. But he says I count not myself to have arrived. I count not myself to to have got to the place where where God is bringing me to. I but I I don't. He says not as though I already attained either were already perfect, but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which I am apprehended of Christ. So he's saying Christ called me for a purpose &gt;&gt; and it is my desire to fulfill that purpose to fulfill all that I am called to be and and and to be all that God has made me to be. And he says that's my desire. I don't count myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before. You know 10 years ago maybe you came to a place where you thought my I have never seen the word of God like I see it today. I have never felt so close to God as I feel today. But now today you can look back 10 years ago and say my I I didn't hardly know God back then. Yet back 10 years ago you felt like my I really know him. I feel so close to him. What is it? The Holy Spirit is always moving forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's always bringing us deeper into Christ and bringing us deeper into the truth of what God has for us, of who he is and of who we are. &gt;&gt; And and so Paul is saying, I'm I'm not looking back there. I'm not saying, well, I I'm not holding my anchor back on something else, but but I want to know Christ today. As Jesus when he taught us to pray, he said we ought to pray give us this day our daily bread. &gt;&gt; Not Lord keep the bread from yesterday good for today but Lord give me today what I need today. &gt;&gt; Every one of us needs to take a step forward today. &gt;&gt; Maybe you took a step forward yesterday but today is a new day. &gt;&gt; Today is another day. And and the Lord wants to bring you further today than you were yesterday. So he's saying, "Walk with me. Come further with me. Take another step with me." And if and if our hearts are open and and our minds are open to receive the word of God, he will take us step by step all the way into a rapture, &gt;&gt; all the way into a body change. &gt;&gt; We know that rapturing grace lies in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; We know it's all lying there. But having those books on the shelf doesn't give us rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Reading those books, well, I read I read every message book, therefore I must have rapturing. No, but God is taking your faith to a place where your your faith will be rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; But we can't in our human minds, we can't comprehend it all at one time. So God, it reveals just as much as we can handle to take us the next step. &gt;&gt; So as long as we refuse to take the step that God has given us to take, then we can't go no further. &gt;&gt; Then we're stuck there. Well, well, we I'll just wait for the I'll just wait for the next word that God's then then maybe I'll take that one. But Lord, I don't want this one. This one's too hard. This one's too difficult. I I don't want to have to go through this. I don't want to have to deal with this, Lord. It's It's too hard. As long as we refuse to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit, we can't go no further. &gt;&gt; So, we've got to take the word that God has given us and apply it in our lives. And and as you feed on the message of the hour, you you those of you that have been in the message for a long time, you know this that that you read the same message that you read last week, the same message you read last year, and it seems like you're reading a whole new message. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God is is opening your eyes to something that you need today. &gt;&gt; Last week, last year, you needed something different. But today, God has something for you for what you have need of today. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So Paul says, I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. Nothing else matters in life. Nothing else matters but to know him. That's right. &gt;&gt; We've got to recognize where our blessings come from in life. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you." &gt;&gt; Says, "Having food and raignment, be content." Says, "The heavenly father knows that you have need of all these other things." So, you know, we we get a new car, we get a new job, we get we get married, we have children, we get a home, and we begin to worry about those things. We begin to worry, well, well, how do I keep if if I don't keep this job, how am I going to keep this car? If if I don't keep if I don't get this promotion, how am I going to afford my mortgage payment? &gt;&gt; But the that's not what the Lord told us. He said, "Seek first the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; and all these things shall be." So if you were seeking the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; and you found yourself with a good job, it was a blessing from the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you were seeking the kingdom of God and he provided you with the vehicle, it was a blessing from the Lord. If you were seeking the kingdom of God and and he provided you with the home, it was a blessing from the Lord. So why should we worry about our homes? Why should we worry about our cars? Why should we worry about our jobs? &gt;&gt; He knows what we have need of and and he will give us a blessing according to our needs. &gt;&gt; So but what he's called us to do is he's called us to seek after the kingdom of God and his righteousness. &gt;&gt; So let us not get distracted in this leodyian age about all of these things that are around us. All of these things that we can have, all of these things that we can add to our life, allow God to do the adding. &gt;&gt; And if he has done the adding, then no man can take it away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. But if it's us that did the adding, if it's us that that that that got the debt, and it's us that that struggled, and it's us that pushed, and it's us that had to have the new car, and it's us that had to have the nice house, and it's us that that had to have the the beautiful clothes, and and and the expensive things all adding. It's us that, well, I just have to have it. I just ha I gotta look like sister so and so. I gotta drive like brother so and so. And we got to have then then no matter how much we struggle, we're not going to be able to hold on to those things. &gt;&gt; So we've got to let go and we've got to let God have his way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I counted all but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I've suffered the loss of all things, and to count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him. Where do you want to be found?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When your name is called, when your time comes, where do you want to be found? &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you want to be found caught up in your own ideas? Do you want to be found caught up in your own dreams, caught up in your own ambitions? Or when the Lord calls your name, do you want to be found in him? &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be found in Christ. &gt;&gt; I want to be found when someone looks for me. Where where can I find brother Stephen? You can find him in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Put your name in there. &gt;&gt; Let us be found. That was Paul's desire. Oh, that I might be found in him, not having my own righteousness. You know, we we we sometimes struggle with that when we've been in the message for a while and and and God has molded our lives and and God has washed the world out of our lives and and God changed our desires and God changed who we were and transformed our lives into what we are today. The devil likes to come on sit on on our shoulder and say, "Oh my, you've got it figured out. My look at brother so and so. It's too bad he doesn't have it figured out. Look at sister so if only they could live like you. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't you that got that way. It was Christ that came into your life. &gt;&gt; It was Christ that changed you. It was Christ that blessed you. It was Christ that molded you and brought you to the place that you are today. It wasn't anything to do with you, but it was all him working on your life. &gt;&gt; So, let us be like Paul and let that be our desire that we might be found in him not having our own righteousness, not coming to a place where we think, "Ah, I've now I'm a believer. If anybody's a believer, they can just look at me. I'm a real example." like the Pharisee in the temple that Jesus saw praying and oh I thank thee Lord that I'm not like this publican and then there was the publican smiting his breast saying oh Lord forgive me I'm a sinner Jesus said that man went home justified let us not be like the Pharisee but let us be like the publican recognizing and never forgetting where we came from and who made us into the person that we are today that it's not our own righteous iousness, but it's his righteousness. &gt;&gt; Not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, &gt;&gt; the righteousness which is of God by faith. &gt;&gt; Let us be found in him. The message perfect faith, brother Brandham says. So when a man lives by faith and walks by faith, I mean substance faith, he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ. &gt;&gt; My we think when we get perfect faith, when we get sub, then the world is going to see who we are. &gt;&gt; Then we're really going to stand out. then we're going to show everybody the power of God. &gt;&gt; But no, Brother Brandham says when you're walking by faith, you're isolated from the entire world. &gt;&gt; This is not about everybody else. This is about you and God alone. &gt;&gt; This is about a personal relationship. &gt;&gt; He's isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ. there. Now you're getting into bride material. See? Amen. Isn't that the day that we're living in? &gt;&gt; This is what we're looking towards. This is what we're hungering for. This is where we want to get to. This is where the word is bringing us to. &gt;&gt; The bride age, the uniting time. &gt;&gt; When the word and the bride become one. Amen. &gt;&gt; It says when you're walking by substance faith now you're getting into bride material. See you're getting into rapturing condition. Now &gt;&gt; that means for each one of us so we don't put it off to anybody else. Brother Brham says that means for each one of us not just the pastor deacons trustees. The pastor is not going to bring us into a rapture. The pastor is not going to change our mortal bodies. &gt;&gt; But no, it's it's our relationship with God. It's that personal walk. It's you getting What was the third poll? It was that little room &gt;&gt; where each individual went in by themselves. A personal meeting with that pillar of fire in that room coming out the other side. What happened in there? I don't know what happened, but I'm not the same person that I was when I went in there. &gt;&gt; That's the third pole is a personal relationship between you and God alone. &gt;&gt; Shut away, isolated from the entire world. Brother Brandham says &gt;&gt; so it's it's not just the pastor, deacons, trustees. That means for the leoty. This is the message that you believe. Every individual walks in a world with God alone. &gt;&gt; Are you ready to accept that? &gt;&gt; Are you ready to be alone with God? &gt;&gt; Bible says it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Lord. Are you ready to fall into the hands of God? Are you ready to place your trust completely in him? &gt;&gt; Where it's not you and mom and dad and God. &gt;&gt; It's not you and your wife and God. &gt;&gt; It's you and God alone. &gt;&gt; There's nobody to hold your hand. But God &gt;&gt; wants to be known to you. &gt;&gt; He wants to hold your hand. &gt;&gt; He wants to be your guide. Bible says in Psalms 23, "The Lord is my shepherd. &gt;&gt; I shall not want." &gt;&gt; You're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God. &gt;&gt; My what a place. &gt;&gt; He gives the orders and you pack them out. Whatever he says, there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere. You walk right on. If the Lord says this, there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You go right on just the same. Now, you're coming into perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Perfect perfection that cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That faith never fails. Yes, he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith. And so it is now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others. &gt;&gt; In him, &gt;&gt; let us be found in him. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1 and verse 5 says this. It says, "Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will." This was the good pleasure of his will. It wasn't something that somebody forced him to do. It wasn't something that that well, all right, they've they've worshiped hard enough. They've they've pressed in. They've sacrificed enough. They've they they've done it. No, but it was the good pleasure of his will. &gt;&gt; You were in the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was the good pleasure of his will to bring you into Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; to predestinate you unto the adoption of children. &gt;&gt; Predestinated. When he was thinking about you before the foundation of the world, what did he think about you? He thought, "They're going to come to the adoption. They're going to come to the maturity. I'm going to have children, and they're not going to just be babies, but they're going to grow up and and they're going to become mature believers. They're going to reach maturity. They're going to reach a place where they have absolute confidence in my word. They're going to reach a place where nothing can shake them. They're going to be reach a place where they're just like me. As a matter of fact, I'm going to put my spirit within them." and and and their my spirit is going to bear record with their spirit that they are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; And there's going to be a cry within them that cries out, "Aba, Father." They're going to have a desire to be just like me because they're my children. They're my sons and my daughters. &gt;&gt; They're going to grow up and they're going to be just like me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't have a choice because they are mine. They are my seed. And when that seed begins to manifest, it's going to manifest me. &gt;&gt; You know, our our children, they don't have a choice. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; When they're born, they're our children. &gt;&gt; When they're babies, we see a little bit of mom in there. We see a little bit of dad in there. and and and you know, somebody sees a little bit of grandpa or a little bit of grandma or whatever, but you know, they're just a baby. They're just a little little baby. They can't all they can do is cry and scream and and and and and uh laugh and make happy noises. &gt;&gt; They can't really communicate, but they're are our child and we love them. There's there's an attachment. They are an expression of us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But they have not yet manifested their potentials. &gt;&gt; They've not yet reached the maturity. We can't We don't take that baby and and set them set them in the workplace and say, "All right, now you go build those houses like I build those houses. You go fix those IT problems like I fix those IT problems." Come on. What's your problem? It's just a baby. It just needs to be fed. But the so one day they're going to be just like their father. &gt;&gt; The only thing that can keep them from being like their father is if they don't eat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If they don't eat, they're going to perish. If they don't eat, they're going to die. &gt;&gt; But as long as they eat, that which is inside of them will be manifested on the outside. They will continue to grow. They will continue to learn until one day they're just like their father. &gt;&gt; And so is it with sons and daughters of God. When you've been born again by the word of God, the seed of God has been quickened in your heart. &gt;&gt; You're just a baby. You don't understand exactly who you are. You don't ex understand exactly where you're going, exactly what your place is in Christ. You don't understand what the adoption means. You don't understand the placing of sons, but you know that that's your father and you're his child. There's something within you that cries out, "Aba, Father." No matter how big of mistakes you make, no matter how many times you backslid, there's something in your heart that brings you back to God, &gt;&gt; saying, "Lord, there's something crying out within me." &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a sieging of God that's been quickened by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now, as long as you feed upon the word of God, you will become just like him. &gt;&gt; But if you refuse to eat, you will die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why it's so important that we feed, that we read our Bibles, that we pray every day, that we feed upon the message of the hour, which is Christ revealed in your day. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's &gt;&gt; because without that you cannot become who you were meant to be. &gt;&gt; You cannot manifest that which is inside of you. He has predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved. in the beloved. Not accepted because of the beloved, &gt;&gt; but you are accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; You are accepted through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You are accepted when you come into him. As long as you stay out living by your own works, by your own ideas, by your own righteousness, &gt;&gt; our righteousness is as filthy rags before him. It's unacceptable. We are unable to achieve a place. We are born in sin. We are shaped in iniquity. We come in the world speaking lies. We are unable right from our birth. We we we are born in sin and and unable therefore to come into his presence. There is only one way to come into his presence and that is through the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But now when you come into Christ, you receive him and you're born again by the spirit of God. You've come into Christ and now you are accepted because you are in the beloved &gt;&gt; in whom we have redemption through his blood. in whom. Not just because you you believed, oh, I believe the message is true. Oh, I I believe that's right. I believe what those people say is is is right and and true. I believe that's the Bible. I believe that's we're living in the end time. I believe that there's going to be a rapture. I believe there's going to be But have you received him? That's right. &gt;&gt; You can believe the message. The Bible says the the devils believe and tremble. &gt;&gt; So you can believe that the message is true. But have you received the message? &gt;&gt; Because it's as many as received him. &gt;&gt; To them gave he power to become the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Even as many who who as who believe on his name. &gt;&gt; So yes, you must believe. But now that you have believed, have you received? What did Paul say? Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? &gt;&gt; Have you received him? Oh, have you come into him? &gt;&gt; Because only in him are you accepted. &gt;&gt; In him was life. John 1 vers4 in him was life and the life was the light of men. Not being near him, not listening to the word, but in him was life. &gt;&gt; Let us get in there. &gt;&gt; Let us get where there's life. Not just around the message. That's not where where life is. That's not where the new birth is. Not just going to the right church. Not just dressing the right way. Not just saying the right things, but when you come into him, that's where there's life. &gt;&gt; That's where there's quickening power. John 14:20, Jesus says, "At that day, you shall know that I am in my father and you are in me." &gt;&gt; And I am in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; At that day, at in this day, the day when he was revealing himself, the day when when when he's quickening who he is, when he's unveiling, then you won't just know who I am, but you'll know who you are. &gt;&gt; At that day, you'll know that that I'm in the Father and that you are in me. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Revelations 19 verse 7 says, "Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come." bride time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham spoke about perfect faith. When you're walking with substance faith, that's bride material. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; The marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; How did she make herself ready? Did Did she Was it her own righteousness? Was it her own robes? Was it her own her own ability to to to put together something? No. It says to her was granted &gt;&gt; that she should be arrayed in fine linen, &gt;&gt; clean and white. &gt;&gt; For the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. &gt;&gt; This righteousness didn't come by her own self, but it was given to her. &gt;&gt; To her was granted to her was given &gt;&gt; to to put on this righteousness, to put on this pure linen, clean and white. Amen. &gt;&gt; To her was granted. The Bible says, "He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything is in him. &gt;&gt; That's what we were singing about in the song service. It's all in Christ. &gt;&gt; He is everything. you know, we want to we want to leave behind a legacy. You know, I've been I've been working in an old folks home the last few weeks and and and it kind of gives you a different perspective on life &gt;&gt; and and you see all these elders that are that are in their last few years living out their final days on earth and they all have their names on the on their doors. But who are these people? Yeah. &gt;&gt; No doubt in their youth, no doubt when they were young, they they they had jobs. They had families. &gt;&gt; They were part of something. They they they were important in their circle. They they were they were crucial to to the role that that they played to the organization or the family they were part of. They were they were critical to that. But now here they are tucked away in this home where you wonder who were these people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What did they do? We may never know. &gt;&gt; We may never hear their names again. &gt;&gt; They maybe they've already been forgotten at work. &gt;&gt; Some of them already forgotten by their own families. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nobody visits them. Just there all alone. &gt;&gt; What do you want to leave behind you? You're here today. The Bible says our life is but a vapor. &gt;&gt; Here today and gone tomorrow. &gt;&gt; We might we we become so important in our own eyes. &gt;&gt; We think nobody can do without me. My family can't make it without me. &gt;&gt; One day they'll have to make it without you. &gt;&gt; My workplace can't make it without me. One day they're going to have to make it without you. That's right. &gt;&gt; One day your family's going to forget about you. &gt;&gt; Maybe not your children, but maybe your children's children, maybe their children. They won't even know their great grandparents name. They won't even they won't even the the workplace, you know, as as as employees change over and management changes soon, you know, somebody will come, hey, did you know so and so? No, never never heard of them. That was before my time. So what do we leave behind us? &gt;&gt; We have no matter how important we can become. You know, even think about presidents of the United States. How many here can name all of the presidents of the United States? I know I certainly can't. &gt;&gt; You know, you can remember George Washington. You can remember Abraham Lincoln. Why? Because they're written all over pages of history. But many of them were either had short terms or or you know they just didn't do nothing drastic happened during their during their uh um time their term. Thank you. And and so so you forget about them. &gt;&gt; And somebody asks you, "Do you know who this is?" No, never heard that name. Oh, they were a president of the United States. So it doesn't matter how important we think we are. One day we become forgotten. &gt;&gt; You know, we can probably name more presidents of the United States than we can prime ministers of Canada. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, we are so easily forgotten no matter what position we hold, no matter what place we hold. So what do we want to leave behind us? &gt;&gt; What is it that we want to share to others? What good is it if we try to share oursel with somebody? It's here today and gone tomorrow. But if we can share Jesus Christ with somebody, &gt;&gt; that is something that is eternal. &gt;&gt; That is something that will never be lost to time. &gt;&gt; That is something that will never be forgotten. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here we are thousands of years later, 2,000 years after the death of Christ, and we still know him. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he is the same &gt;&gt; yesterday, today, and forever. He will not be forgotten upon the pages of a history book. &gt;&gt; He will not be forgotten somewhere down on a family tree. But he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. So if you want to leave something lasting, excuse me, something lasting in your family, leave Jesus Christ in your family. &gt;&gt; You want to leave something lasting on your job, leave Jesus Christ on your job. &gt;&gt; You want to leave something lasting in your school, take Jesus Christ into your school with you. &gt;&gt; He's the one that will not be forgotten. &gt;&gt; Amen. He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. Brother Brandham says in the present stage of my ministry he says I hope he will crown my ministry of this of letting me take the close of the word. Now here we see Revelations 19 coming into manifestation. Let that he would let me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the clo in the cloth of the word and for his righteousness. &gt;&gt; That was brother Brandham's desire when when when he cried out to the Lord, Lord, what what do you want me to do? as he was having those dreams that he was he was sherking his job at at the the the hydro company. It wasn't hydro but at the power company and he was sherking his job at at this other place and he said, "Lord, what what am I doing?" And he tried to make that right. Is there anything that I that I that I did wrong and go to his bosses and try to find out if there was something wrong? And then then it came to him, well, maybe I've been sherking on the Lord's job. and he picked up his Bible and opened the scripture and and and he found his place. The scriptures open and there he began to read about Eleazar going to get a bride for Isaac. &gt;&gt; And he recognized that that's his place. That's what God had called him to do was to go and hunt a bride for Christ. &gt;&gt; And so he began to lay in the word. He began to to preach those messages that he'd been hesitant to preach in other places and began to to to lay out this word that would call the bride. But not just call the bride, but that would clothe the bride. &gt;&gt; For we are not clothed in our own righteousness, but we are clothed in his righteousness. &gt;&gt; I want to go back to that quote that we read from perfect faith. and read it to you once again now that we've come to this place in our minds. When a man lives by faith and walks by faith, I mean substance faith, he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ. There now you're getting into bride material. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; What's your faith in? Your faith is in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't have perfect faith in a man's idea because man's ideas will fail. &gt;&gt; You can't have perfect faith in a system &gt;&gt; because heavens and earth will pass away &gt;&gt; but my word shall never fail. &gt;&gt; So when you begin to walk by substance faith, you're you're not walking by faith in an idea in a concept. You're walking by faith in the word of God. &gt;&gt; And we're feeding upon the unfailing body word of the son of man. That's familiar familiar quote to us all. Feeding upon the unfailing body word of the son of man. So so as we feed upon the word of God, that's what's building our faith. Faith comes by hearing. Hearing by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so as as now the word as we become united with the word, as the word begins to fill our hearts, as the word begins to fill every fiber of our being, that's what's bringing us to a place of substance faith. That's what's bringing us to a place of perfect faith is when we become one with the word. &gt;&gt; That's what brings us into bride material. &gt;&gt; That's a relationship. bride and bridegroom is a relationship, &gt;&gt; a re an intimate relationship of union. When you come into a union with the word, &gt;&gt; an inseparable union, the Bible says, "What God hath joined together, let no man put us under." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You come to this place of union. Husbands, love your wives even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her. &gt;&gt; That's right. So when you come to this place of union with the word, a place where you in the word are in such a relationship that you have an absolute confidence in the word &gt;&gt; that he will not fail. &gt;&gt; Before you come into relationship, you can you you we many times just think of the word as well the word we're just speaking of the Bible. We're just speaking of of what you read on the on of the scriptures of these pages. But when you come into relationship with the word, you recognize that the word is is not just writings upon a page, but the word is a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word is an individual. In the beginning was the word, not this Bible, but in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. And that word became flesh. All that was written and prophesied of in here became flesh &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; So when you come into a place of union, a place of relationship with the word so intimate that you now become inseparable because you have become wed together. &gt;&gt; Now that's bride material. That's substance faith &gt;&gt; is when you become inseparable from the word. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in one place he says it was I and my father are one back there and it's I and my father are one here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to become one with the word. &gt;&gt; You it's got to come off of the these pages and into your heart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're in rapturing condition. Each one of us, the leoty, every individual walking in a world with God alone baptized into this kingdom. Nobody in there but you and God. He gives the orders and you pack them out. Whatever he says, [snorts] this is now your husband because your bride material when you come to this place. Whatever he says, whatever your Lord says, there's nothing. He says, whatever he says, there's not a shadow of doubt anywhere. &gt;&gt; Why? because you know who said it &gt;&gt; more than just it was written on the pages of this book this book but I know the one who wrote it on the pages of this book I know the one that spoken in this day I know the one that is speaking to me today &gt;&gt; if the Lord says this there's Nobody in the world can talk you out of it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's a husband and wife relationship. &gt;&gt; They don't care what the wife doesn't care what other people's husbands have to say about her. &gt;&gt; She only cares what her husband has to say. [cheering] &gt;&gt; The bride doesn't care what other husbands have to say. She doesn't care what the devil says about her. She doesn't care what the doctors say about her. She doesn't care what what the banker says about her. She doesn't care what what anybody says about She only cares what her Lord says about her. &gt;&gt; And her Lord says she is a spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The the question is, have we recognized who we are? When you recognize that you are the bride of Jesus Christ, then you will stop taking what these others tried to plant in your mind. &gt;&gt; Others that knew you before you were saved. Oh no, I know you. I know the way you used to drink. I know the way you used to run around. I know the way you used to live. But that's not me anymore. you you no longer care what they have to say about you because now you are married to the word &gt;&gt; and he is the only one that is important. His is the only opinion that you care &gt;&gt; and when you go to that's when you come to a place where circumstances become irrelevant. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's when you go to a place where no matter what the doctor says, the word says, "By his stripes, I'm healed." &gt;&gt; It might not look like it. It might not feel like it. &gt;&gt; You might not know when it's going to happen, but the word says, "By his stripes, I am healed." &gt;&gt; The word says he's my deliverer. &gt;&gt; I might not know when this this issue is going to get out of my life. I might not know when I'm going to overcome this problem. I might not know when I'm going to overcome this desire. But he is my deliverer. &gt;&gt; Therefore, deliverance has to come because the word said so. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, you'll always have this problem. It runs in your family. It doesn't matter if it runs in the family. The word says I am free. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now you're coming to perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Perfect perfection that can't fail. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's not you getting to a place of strength. It's you getting to a place of weakness &gt;&gt; where &gt;&gt; you have no confidence in this flesh. &gt;&gt; But all of your confidence now rests in Jesus Christ. That's a place of perfection. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which I which also I am apprehended of Christ." Brethren, I count on myself to have apprehended. But this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. [snorts] Let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded. &gt;&gt; Perfect means completeness. or maturity. &gt;&gt; That's what the word perfect means. &gt;&gt; Can look it up in the Bible, reference it to Strong's concordance, completeness, maturity. More confidence in the word, less confidence in the flesh. &gt;&gt; I love this scripture. Paul says in Philippians 3:3, he says, "For we are," this is the same chapter. a little further back. We are the circumcision. So those He's not talking about natural circumcision. He's talking about the new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you would think that, well, once I was born again and once I've been walking this way for a long time, now I've gotten to a place where I can do it. &gt;&gt; But no, we know that that the the new birth is the personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you. &gt;&gt; And so now Paul is saying we are the new birth who are rejoicing in Christ Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; We've received a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to us. We're rejoicing in him. We recognize who he is. We recognize what he's done for us. And what does it do? It causes us to worship God in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Not just in the flesh realm, not just because it feels good, but but because we have recognized who he is. But another evidence Paul is saying that you've that you've been quickened. Another evidence Paul is saying is that you have no confidence in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My We don't like to think about that. We like to think, well, when I really got it, I won't make mistakes anymore. But Paul's saying, when you really got it, you won't have no more confidence in this flesh. &gt;&gt; When you really got it, you'll recognize where this flesh come from. You'll recognize that you were born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come in the world, speaking lies. You'll recognize that it's by grace that you're saved, not of works, lest any man should boast. You'll recognize that he won't share his glory with any man, but he wants to express his glory through your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The glory of Jesus Christ. So as we come to this place of maturity, we come to a place where we have more confidence in the word, less confidence in oursel. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in perfect faith. He's he's reading from the scripture. He says he says, "Therefore," and this is where I want to get to this morning. He says, "Therefore I say unto you, what things soever you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them &gt;&gt; and you shall have them." Oh, this is the place we want to get to where we just we can just ask and we know it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; We love those scriptures and we we love to claim those promises. Lord, you said if I ask anything, you said wherever two or three would agree on anything. Lord, you you said this. Lord, you said that. And Lord, I'm asking. We love those promises. Whatsoever you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them and you shall have them. &gt;&gt; A place of faith, place of perfect faith. And when you stand praying, forgive. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a place of maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Forgiveness is not for children. Forgiveness is for a place of maturity. &gt;&gt; When you stand praying, forgive if you have ought against any, that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you of your trespasses. When you get to a place where you have the kind of faith that you can ask what you would and it'll be done unto you &gt;&gt; in that place, in that maturity, in that time. Now, when you come and ask, be sure to forgive. &gt;&gt; You're the bride of Jesus Christ. Now, forgive. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know who you are and you know how to ask for what you need. Now forgive. &gt;&gt; This place of maturity where we still have transgressions. We still make mistakes. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say when you get to this place now you're at a place where you're beyond transgression. Now you're at a place where you're you're beyond sin. You're beyond mistakes. You're beyond faults. No. The Bible says if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us &gt;&gt; of our sins. &gt;&gt; But when you come to this place now, he says when you stand praying, forgive if you have ought against any that your father also. He doesn't say if if somebody has something against you, Lord, this one's got something against me, Lord, make them come. No, you forgive. &gt;&gt; This isn't about them. Remember, this is a place of perfect faith where it's you and God alone. There's nobody else in this room. This is not about them. This is about you. He says, "Now when you stand praying, when you're shut in with God in that secret place and it's just you and him alone in this place, now when you stand and you begin to commune with that one, with your with your bridegroom, you begin to commune with him. Now forgive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have ought against any, that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you of your transgress trespasses. But if you do not forgive, well, I I I'll forgive. I can't forgive right now. It was it was too bad. It was it was it was too negative. It was too harsh. It was too critical. I just I can't I can't forgive them right now. If you do not forgive, neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trans trespasses. &gt;&gt; Then he makes this statement. This is a quote. Now brother Brandham was reading the scriptures and then now he makes this statement. Now faith is based on forgiveness. That &gt;&gt; my you come to a place of perfect faith. You come to a place where you know who you are. You come to a place where you are united with the word. That faith is based on forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What kind of a people should we be? &gt;&gt; Not a proud people. &gt;&gt; Not a not a people that says, "Oh, they should listen to me. I'm the bride. I got the answers. I know what's happening. I I know where we're going. I know what's been done. I I know what the problem is. No, we should be a humble people. &gt;&gt; We should be a people that forgives. &gt;&gt; Faith is based on forgiveness. Then &gt;&gt; one day there was a man walking in perfect faith of who he was. The man Christ Jesus our Lord. He was perfect and he had perfect faith. He had perfect confidence in what the word says about him. He knew who he was. He knew what he came for. He knew what he had to do. He knew his position. And there as he stood on the on the mountain one day and and and and the Lord came down and and he was arrayed in in white and and Peter said, "Oh, here's Moses and Elijah and Jesus. Let us make three altars." and and and a voice comes down from heaven and and cries out, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Here's this one that was perfect. Here's this one that was the beloved son. This one that walked by substance faith. This one that walked knowing who he was without a shadow of a doubt. And as he hung there upon the cross, he said, "Know ye not that I could call for 10,000 angels, 10 legions of angels, and my father would send them right now? Put up your sword. This one that held the keys to the power of God. This one who was the son of God. This one who was the the image of the invisible God. &gt;&gt; This one who was God walking in flesh. The word became flesh and dwelt among us. And as he's walking yet so humble yet so humble that Satan came down, he knew the prophecies. He knew the coming son. He knew all of these things that were written. But when he came down and he saw the one that was fulfilling the prophecies, he said, "Can this be the one? There's no way that this could be the one to fulfill those. There's no way that this could be." So he come to Jesus and he says, "If thou be the son of God." What was it? He didn't believe. &gt;&gt; He knew what the word said. &gt;&gt; He knew what had to come. But now as it was being fulfilled, he says, "What? This is the one. &gt;&gt; This is the almighty God dwelling in flesh. This is the one upon whom the spirit comes down and remains upon. This is the one in whom the fullness of the God does dwell. If you're really the son of God, &gt;&gt; turn these stones into bread. If you're really the son of God, cast yourself down off the temple. If you're really the son of God, bow down and worship me and I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world. Let's make this happen. Let's get this ball rolling. Let's see some power. &gt;&gt; But the spirit of God doesn't clown for the devil. That's right. &gt;&gt; And as the bride begins to be manifest, as you begin to be manifest in your day, all of creation groaning, crying out in expectation for the manifestation of the sons of God. And as those sons of God begin to be manifested, begin to walk out upon the face of the earth, begin to get up in the morning and stretch and and eat their breakfast and go to work, and the devil looks down upon your lives and says, "This is the one." And he begins to come and sit on your shoulder and say, "Well, if you're if you're really a son of God, Let's see some manifestations. Let's see some power. Let's see you put some money in that empty bank account. If you're really a son of God, let's see you overcome that sickness. If you're really a son of God, let's see you do this. Let's see. And and it's a temptation. &gt;&gt; We think, well, and we begin to think about those things. Where do those thoughts come from? Brother Brandham says those your thoughts either come from God or they come from the devil. &gt;&gt; So now as there begins to be thoughts going through your mind saying, "Well, if I'm really a son of God, why why do I struggle with this? If I was a son of God, surely I would just ask and and I would speak it and I would walk into perfect health and and and I would walk in perfect strength. I would have that promotion that I want. I would I would have this. Where are those thoughts coming from? The same one that said to Jesus, "If thou be, why don't you do this? Why don't you do that? Why don't you show me?" But the power of God did not come for himself. It came for others. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, as he hung there upon the cross, fulfilling every prophecy that was written about him, he cried out. What did he cry out? What did he cry? Lord, it's done. You can now judge the earth. Lord, it's done. Destroy. Let fire fall from heaven. destroy the temple, destroy those priests, destroy those. So no, as he hung there upon the cross, &gt;&gt; at the finishing of his work, at the maturity, at the his placing, at his coronation day, as as he fulfilled the word that was written about him, he cried out, "Father, &gt;&gt; forgive them. &gt;&gt; They don't know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; How should we be any different?" the bride of Jesus Christ. How could we be any different than our bridegroom when we come into manifestation? When we begin to recognize who we are, when we begin to recognize that it's the spirit of God working through us and doing these mighty works and and and expressing his life through out through these unworthy vessels, &gt;&gt; how could we be any different than to cry, "Father, forgive them." &gt;&gt; They don't know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved. He was the beloved son and we have been accepted in him. We were in him there as he hung upon the cross. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now that word that was in him there, that attribute as that Holy Ghost now broke out upon the upon the the church in the upper room and and and and fell upon the 120 in the upper room and and begin to fall upon upon the others as on the day of Pentecost and and as the spirit went out and and and Peter said, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you. You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This promise is to you." And it's to your children and to them that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. &gt;&gt; You were in him there. And now here you are expressed in your day, manifested in your day. &gt;&gt; Not relying on yourself, not becoming a different expression of of something different, but the expression of the beloved. &gt;&gt; You're in the beloved now. expressing him out through your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "And it is the rising of the sun." It says, "As he being the groom, the bride has to come forth because it's part of him. And it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoken of the bride. What are you going to express? You're not going to express your own hopes, your own dreams, your own ambitions, but you're going to be a manifestation, an express, an expression of what the word says about you. Amen. &gt;&gt; All that the word says about the bride, you are going to express &gt;&gt; out from your life. &gt;&gt; It's you and him alone. So musicians come. Maybe we could sing that little song. Shut in with God in a secret place. &gt;&gt; It's you and him shut in to this secret place. Nothing can come between you and him. &gt;&gt; Nothing can separate you from his love. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "What can separate us from the love of God? Shall tribulations, shall persecutions, shall death, sickness, sorrows, nothing can separate. Why? Because you have become inseparable from the word of God. You are united with him as you feed on this word, as you as as you labor to enter in. The Bible says the law and the prophets were until John. But from that time, every man presses into the kingdom of God. And as you [music] now press into the word of God, you're pressing into a relationship, you're pressing into a union that you and the word might become one. &gt;&gt; This isn't about your family. This isn't about trying to be what mom and dad want you to be. This isn't about trying to impress your brother, your sister, but this is about you and God alone. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what they think. It matters what God thinks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that God's not going to speak through them because God uses moms and dads and and and and the the Bible tells us children obey your parents. Tells us to honor our father and mother. If you got godly parents, what are they doing? They're trying to push you to meet Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; because it's not good enough. It's not good enough to know that mom and dad know Jesus Christ. That won't bring you to heaven. But you have to know Jesus Christ. It's not good enough that your pastor knows Jesus Christ. It's not good enough brother Moses knows Jesus Christ or Brother Zigg knows Jesus Christ. It's not good enough that the musicians know him or the song leader knows him. [music] But you must know Jesus Christ and you must press into him as he begins to knock upon your heart. You must press in. You must press begin to push yourself out of the way. &gt;&gt; Begin to open the doors of your heart. Those doors that you won't let anybody else inside. Those doors that you won't let your brother inside. You won't let your sister inside. You won't let your wife, your husband inside. You won't let anybody know about these things that you've been through, but let Jesus Christ inside &gt;&gt; that you can become shut in with him &gt;&gt; in a secret place. &gt;&gt; He's not going to go telling everybody what you told him. But no, he's a personal God. &gt;&gt; He cares about you. He'll send ministers by your way that will minister directly to your heart, directly to that need that you have shared with him and him alone that nobody else could possibly know about. &gt;&gt; In brother Brandham's day, under that gift of of discernment, as people would come up and he would tell them things that nobody else could possibly know about, &gt;&gt; that brother Brandham could not have possibly known. But what was it? It was Christ expressing to them that I know you, &gt;&gt; that I know your troubles. And and we don't have that gift here this morning, but we have the same Lord Jesus Christ here this morning that knows your troubles. And maybe he was speaking to you this morning. Maybe he was speaking to your heart. Maybe he was speaking to your address about your situation, about your trouble. &gt;&gt; It's because he cares about you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's because he wants to increase your faith. &gt;&gt; It's because he wants to draw you into his presence. &gt;&gt; It's because he wants to meet your need. And he doesn't want you to rely upon the things of this world that you've been relying upon. But he wants you to lay those things aside and come into his presence [music] and rely upon him and him alone that you might come to a place of perfect faith, &gt;&gt; a place of rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; That you might come into bride material &gt;&gt; that you might be ready to step over into a new body &gt;&gt; to step over into that place. It's it's not it's not about the new body. It's not about the perfect health. It's about being with him forever. That shikina glory, that supernatural presence that you come in from time to time and you say, "Lord, don't ever let me leave this place. Don't ever let me leave this presence." when you come into that place. But we have obligations. We have things we have to do. We have to look after our families. We have to we have to go to work. We have to and and we go into places and the spirit of God that that that anointing leaves us and and and we just long for that time when we can once again get into the presence of God. But this is about this is about where he can finally take us to a place where we will never have to leave that presence again. &gt;&gt; Where we will never have to leave that chakina glory again. &gt;&gt; Where we can ever be with the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible says comfort one another with these words. When Paul talked about when he talked about the body change and he talked about about the Lord himself shall come with a shout and he talked about the dead in Christ rising. He didn't say get excited about these words although they do excite us. He didn't say rejoice about these words, although we do rejoice in them, but he said these words will bring comfort, &gt;&gt; knowing that there's coming a day &gt;&gt; when we will no longer have to ever leave that presence, that holy presence, that all knowing presence, that supernatural presence where prayers are met, where needs are met, where questions are answered forever. When we get on that side, we will forever live in that presence where every question can be answered. Where every need will be met. He said before they even pray, I will answer them. &gt;&gt; That's the place we're coming to. Amen. &gt;&gt; The the sufferings the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christ in you the hope of glory. Let's stand together. Shut in with God in a secret [singing] place. There in the spirit beholding [singing] his face, [music] &gt;&gt; gaining no power to run in the race. Oh, I long to be shot in with God. Or do you have a need this morning? Just reach out to him. [singing] with God in that secret place. All he knows &gt;&gt; there in the spirit. Behold in his [singing] face, gaining more power to run [music and singing] in the race. Oh, I long [singing] to be [music] shot in with God. Oh, sing it one more time. Oh, shining [singing] the way [music] of God in a secret [singing] place. There in the [singing] spirit, behold in his face any [singing] more power to ride [singing and music] in the race. &gt;&gt; Yes, I long to be [music] shouting with God. Oh, let's sing that song. He is all I need. He is all I need. Jesus is all I need. He is all I need. &gt;&gt; Oh, is he all you need this [music] morning? He's all I need. Jesus [singing] is all I need. Oh, he is all I need. He is all I need. Jesus is all I need. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's sing it to him. You are all I need. Oh, you are all &gt;&gt; Oh, can we lift our hands? Oh, you &gt;&gt; you are all I need. [music and singing] Yes, Jesus. You're all [singing] I need. [music] &gt;&gt; You are all I need. You &gt;&gt; You [singing] are all I need. &gt;&gt; Jesus, [music and singing] you're all I need. Oh, I will worship [music] him. Yes, I [singing] will worship him. &gt;&gt; I will worship him. &gt;&gt; Yes, his spirit and truth. Oh, I will [singing] worship him. &gt;&gt; I will [singing] worship him in spirit [singing and music] and in truth. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be his name. As we bow our heads together, let's just softly sing that little chorus. He carth for you. He [music] carth for you. With our eyes closed and our heads bowed, he carth for [singing] you. &gt;&gt; It's personal this morning. He car for you &gt;&gt; through [music] sunshine [singing] or shadows. &gt;&gt; He car for you. Can you sing? He carth for me. Oh, he [music and singing] carth for me. &gt;&gt; He knows what you're going through. Yes, he [singing] car for me [music] &gt;&gt; through sunshine or shadows. care for me. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, we believe that this morning, Lord, that you care for us &gt;&gt; for you are our bridegroom, Lord. And your word says, [music] Lord, that husbands should love their wives even as you loved the church. Even as you loved us and gave yourself for us, Lord, your word says that you so loved the world that you gave your only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Lord, we believe you this morning. We believe your word, Father. We believe that you care. We believe that you know what we are going through this morning. You know the needs that we have. Lord, you know if there is any sickness in here this morning that someone is suffering. You know their suffering. You know their pain. Lord, maybe there's someone suffering pain in their heart this morning. heartaches, brokenheartedness, oh God. Lord, heartaches that come from the suffering and the sorrow that we endure in this life. But Lord, you said you said those sufferings that we're going through, Lord, they're not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed. Lord, you said this suffering is but for a season. a season that it might mold us, that it might bring us to perfection, that it might bring us to a perfect rest, that it might bring us to a comfort in you, that it might bring us to a place where we have an absolute confidence in you. Where Lord, we're no longer relying upon oursel. We're no longer rely upon our education. we no longer rely upon upon our our ideas, upon our bank accounts, but that Lord, our confidence rests just in you. &gt;&gt; Lord, you're bringing us to a place of perfect faith. And Lord, may we just rest in that this morning, Lord, knowing that Lord, you know the situations. Lord, Father, as you stood in the church, Lord, in Revelations 2 and you you stood and you said, "I know. I know your tribulations. I know your heartaches. I know your suffering. Lord Jesus, we love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we know that, Lord, though sometimes life is hard, we know you said that all things will work together for good to them who love you, who are called according to your purpose. And we pray that you would just take every situation here this morning under your control, Lord. And Father, may we just place it in your hands this morning, knowing, Lord, that you will look after it, oh God. And may we just walk as Abraham walked, Lord. May we walk with that kind of a faith that Lord, no matter what circumstances look like, no matter how impossible it looks, you are the God of the impossible. because nothing is impossible to you, Lord. We rest in your promises this morning. And we just commit each one to your hands. Lord, you see every hand that is lifted. You see every need that's represented here this morning. Maybe some not even asking for themselves, but maybe for others that are at home or abroad, Lord. Father, you know every need, Father. And you are a present help in a time of trouble. Lord, we just rest in you this morning. And we pray that that these few words that were spoken here would just lift up our confidence and increase our faith that you will perform. You will complete that which you have started in our lives, Lord. Blessed be your name. Go with us, Father, and be with us. We pray. We just [music] rest in you, Lord. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I want to turn the service over to brother Zigg this morning. Maybe we could sing that song. Do you know that song? On Christ the solid rock. Of course you know that song. On Christ the solid rock I stand all other grounds. My hope is built on nothing less. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My hope is built on nothing [singing] less than Jesus blood and righteousness. I dare not trust the [music] sweetest friend [singing] but a holy on Jesus name. &gt;&gt; On Christ the solid [singing and music] rock I stand. All other ground is sinking [music] sand. All around is sinking sand. And darkness seems [music] to hide his face. I rest on his unchanging grace. [music] In every high and stormy he anchor [singing] hold within the veil on Christ the solid [singing] rock I stand. [music] All other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking [singing] sand. His oath is [music] covered in [singing] his blood. Support me in the whelming flood. And all around my soul gives [music and singing] way. Even is all my hope is [music and singing] the solid rock I stand. All other ground is sinking [music and singing] sand. All other ground is sinking sand. When he shall come with trumpet sound, oh may I then in [music] him be found in his rightousness [singing] alone, fought lest to stand before the throne. On Christ [music] the solid rock I stand. All [singing] other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is [music] sinking sand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother Stephen. Wasn't a good message. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to be in Christ in the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah. That's our desire. Praise God. That's what the message is all about. Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother Steve. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Let's say that. Amen. In closing, uh, victory is mine, but we put the announcements on there just real fast. Next Sunday, we have brother Gideon. How many know brother Gideon? &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a wonderful minister as well. Amen. So, expecting great things from the Lord. Amen. I believe the Lord has spoken to us this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Each one of us individually, &gt;&gt; we got to be sh with God more and more. &gt;&gt; We got to get back to the basics of the message. Find out what the prophet said. Amen. And it's renewed every time we listen to the message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Victory is my name. &gt;&gt; Victory is mine. &gt;&gt; Victory is mine. Victory today [singing] is mine. I told Satan [music and singing] to get behind. Victory today [singing] is mine. [music] Love is mine. Love [singing] is mine. Love today is [music and singing] mine. I told Satan to [music] get behind. Love today is mine. You are mine. Joy is mine. Joy [singing] today is mine. I [singing] told Satan to get [music] me joy to [music and singing] &gt;&gt; When I woke this morning, I didn't have no doubt. I knew that the Lord would bring me out. [singing] &gt;&gt; So I got down on my knees. I said, [music and singing] "Lord, help me please." I got up singing and shouting, "Victory, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Victory [music] is [singing] mine. &gt;&gt; Victory is mine. &gt;&gt; Victory [music] today [singing] is mine. &gt;&gt; I told Satan to get behind. [singing and music] Victory today is mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's victory here this morning because of Jesus. Not because of our own self, because of the word of God that has brought us deliverance. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Peace is mine. Peace is [singing] mine. Peace [music] today is mine. I told Satan [music and singing] to get behind. Peace today [singing] is mine. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Elisha, would you come? Amen. I was trying to eye you. Amen. You were looking the other way. God bless you. Pray in English, will you? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Mercy. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord God of grace and of mercy. We are thankful for this grace that you've given us this morning. It's not easy, Father God. But by your grace, oh Lord Jesus, you've spoken us, Lord, showing that you we supposed to be there, that place that has been prepared for us. It's a place that I should just be you and I. We thank you, Lord Jesus, for that. We invite your holy name so that he can assist us this morning. Lord, let this prophetic word that came forth this morning, Lord. May he be with us wherever we be so that he may transform our lives, so that we may continue thirsting after you, Lord. Do not hide your face from us. Accept that we may continue to be in your presence, Lord. So that in your presence there's peace, Lord. In your presence, we will have rest. Rest from all our iniquities, rest from all our weaknesses. We can only find peace in you, Lord Jesus. Come and bless the preacher that you've used this morning. Remember his family. May you grant to him more revelation so that he may come forth another time and speak to us. &gt;&gt; Bless this assembly, Lord. Bless our pastor. Bless those who have gone for mission work. Pastor Moses and Pastor, may you be with them, Lord. Deploy your heavenly hammer so that you can there can be insecurity. Create a spiritual atmosphere wherever they'll be, Lord. And as we've heard this morning this morning, let us desire more of this word that have been preached this morning because in your presence that's where we find answers to our questions. Manifest yourself Lord Jesus. Bless every one of us as we are going back home. Lord, you know that some came with questions. Lord, be the answer to all their questions. Manifest yourself. Uh be with us in our homes. We are driving things that are made by men. Uh protect all the vehicles, Lord. In your mighty name Jesus Christ, if you grant us another opportunity to be in this place, we we thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; Can we all say one word in French? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's say it in German. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. God bless you. Go God be with you this afternoon. Amen. God bless you. Praise God.
