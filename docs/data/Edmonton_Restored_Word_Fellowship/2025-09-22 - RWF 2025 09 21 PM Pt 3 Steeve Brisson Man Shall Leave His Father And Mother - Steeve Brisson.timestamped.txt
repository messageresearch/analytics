[22:07] Oh, the Lord has again something in
[22:10] store for us
[22:11] &gt;&gt; this evening.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; We have been blessed. I hope we don't
[22:16] leave it just in church.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; I hope we bring it home. Amen. What we
[22:21] learn, we apply it. We ask the Lord
[22:25] &gt;&gt; to make it life, man. To change our
[22:28] heart. What we heard, maybe we can't do
[22:31] it on our own abilities, but we ask
[22:33] constantly, Lord, I want to match what
[22:36] the word of God has taught me. Things
[22:39] that I have put aside, maybe I've
[22:42] neglected it, but now you have unveiled
[22:45] it. Lord, help me. help me to get to
[22:48] that maturity of the word of God.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Steve, for coming all
[22:54] the way from Quebec.
[22:56] But God knows and discerns the thought
[23:01] and the intent of the heart. He visited
[23:04] our houses. He knows our addresses. He
[23:07] he picked things that we were doing
[23:10] there and he brought it in the surface.
[23:13] We remember the rules not to criticize
[23:15] one another but ourself personally.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; My life has been exposed.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; And I thank God that it has been
[23:24] exposed.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; So I can identify where I can change
[23:28] personally myself.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; Thank God.

[25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; It's good to see you again.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Again, in the house of the Lord, I think
[25:14] we had a a good meal this afternoon. I
[25:17] want to thank all the sisters, whoever
[25:19] participated. We had a special barbecue
[25:21] specialist. And so
[25:25] he had to be
[25:30] It was so smoky. I heard that he had to
[25:32] be replaced at one point because he had
[25:34] too too much smoke in the eyes. And so
[25:36] he had to had to take a break there.
[25:38] Like I'm not crying. I'm okay. I'm okay.
[25:42] Amen. Lord's been good to us. It's I've
[25:44] I can say it's already the last service,
[25:46] but I can say I truly enjoy this time.
[25:49] It's been it's been a blessing to share
[25:52] those things with you. It's been such a
[25:54] atmosphere of of opening where we just
[25:57] we were able to open our hearts without
[25:59] any feeling like we had to I don't know
[26:03] no resistance and just be able to dive
[26:05] in the word. And so it makes it makes my
[26:09] life like the minister's life much much
[26:11] easier. And I think at the end of the
[26:13] day you get more blessing because the
[26:16] word is flowing. Amen.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so again, I want to thank
[26:19] brother Moses for the invitation. And so
[26:22] I was really happy to be here right
[26:24] right away tomorrow morning. First hour
[26:26] going to fly back home. We we have a we
[26:29] have a church also to take care. So
[26:32] Andre Pet, my father-in-law was
[26:34] preaching this morning and my family
[26:36] told me it was a great service. So then
[26:38] I'm happy. I'm happy was I I was
[26:40] covered. Amen. Amen. God is taking care
[26:42] of his children. Amen.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; We'll turn the in our Bible tonight,

[26:51] Stephanie, and brother Brent. Thanks for
[26:54] thanks for coming.
[26:56] Amen.
[26:58] So, we're going to turn in the book of
[26:59] Jeremiah, chapter 17.
[27:13] Now, Jeff and Brent are good friends,
[27:15] but Jeff's kids and my kids brought
[27:18] friendship to another level.
[27:21] They are all these kids just flew in
[27:24] Quebec. I think it's a month ago, and
[27:27] they went on a trip to uh Prince Rhode
[27:29] Island camping. And my my those young
[27:32] people, they live in a bigger world than
[27:34] I live in when I was young.

[27:51] principle that uh you know when you have
[27:54] kids, you know, to give them sometime
[27:56] it's a sacrifice. Uh sometime maybe good
[27:59] friends are not in the neighborhood.
[28:01] They might be uh in the next
[28:03] neighborhood. It takes a sacrifice to
[28:04] drive them. But if you see that they
[28:06] they can they can be surrounded by by
[28:09] good friends then
[28:11] you know you invest in that. Amen. You
[28:14] invest in that. I think that it's um
[28:17] it's a good thing. Amen. Sometime good
[28:19] friends can be in other province and
[28:21] sometime it turns into marriage and and
[28:24] that's another question.
[28:27] All right. Jeremiah chapter 17:9. I did
[28:30] mention that this morning. It was uh so
[28:33] we're going to read it tonight.
[28:35] I think that's a scripture sometime
[28:36] that's misunderstood. It was
[28:37] misunderstood by me because I thought
[28:40] the heart was deceitful when I was a
[28:42] sinner and when I got became a Christian
[28:45] then my heart doesn't deceive me
[28:46] anymore.
[28:48] Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you.
[28:51] Uh our heart needs to be guarded at all
[28:53] time. And so we we we study this morning
[28:56] that that the reason it's deceitful is
[28:58] because it's hiding from us because it's
[29:00] the subconscious part. But the word is a
[29:02] discerner of the thoughts of the hearts.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; And that the word will expose the motive
[29:09] and objective and the intention of the
[29:11] heart which sometime we make an excuse.
[29:14] Oh like I want to do this, I want to do
[29:15] that and then the word comes and shows
[29:17] the true motive behind and it was not
[29:19] godly but we made it. Sometimes as
[29:21] Christians we we're good at ma making
[29:23] stuff look good. Even sometime we hide a
[29:26] bad motive or resentment or something
[29:28] and then well I have on my heart well
[29:30] that that sometime is is big right so
[29:34] that's why when you come to the house of
[29:36] the lord and we are being exposed to the
[29:38] preaching of the word sometime it's not
[29:39] just amen sometime it's ouch
[29:42] &gt;&gt; and some people they don't want to feel
[29:44] this way so they like I hate to go to
[29:45] your church I feel judged but the
[29:48] judgment start by the house of the lord
[29:51] &gt;&gt; there's no purgatory somewhere it's it's
[29:53] now that god wants to purge purge purge
[29:56] us you know of oursel amen so let's read
[29:59] it 17:9 the heart is deceitful above all
[30:02] things and desperately wicked who can
[30:05] who can know it
[30:06] &gt;&gt; and so when we know when God ask a
[30:08] question like that who can know it it
[30:10] means nobody knows it
[30:12] &gt;&gt; I the Lord I said this morning nobody's
[30:15] asked in the scripture seek your own
[30:17] heart because the word says the god
[30:20] search the heart
[30:22] &gt;&gt; I try to reign even to give every man
[30:25] according to his ways and according to
[30:27] the fruit of his doings. Amen. Let's bow
[30:29] our head. Lord Jesus, we we want to
[30:31] thank you, Lord. It's been a blessing to
[30:34] be with friends and brethren, Lord. And
[30:37] even though, Lord, I didn't know a lot
[30:38] of people here right away, Lord. We know
[30:42] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[30:43] and the fellowship of the word, we know
[30:45] we come from the same place.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; And we're going to end up in the same
[30:48] place
[30:49] &gt;&gt; because we we we we've been in that
[30:51] atmosphere. And this is what is so
[30:53] amazing traveling around the world. When
[30:55] we dive, we we might talk about culture
[30:57] and culture is different, food's
[30:59] different, and drive on the other side
[31:01] of the road and drive on the other side
[31:02] of the car and so many different things.
[31:05] But when we open the word, suddenly
[31:07] we're all on the same side.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Lord, bless this church as
[31:13] went through a transition we spoke about
[31:15] last night. Bless them richly and may
[31:18] prosper them, Lord. And make them grow
[31:21] in your presence and being fruitful for
[31:23] your kingdom, Lord.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Bless your word tonight. It's already
[31:26] blessed, but open our mind and our
[31:28] hearts and take every spirit under your
[31:30] control so you may be glorified and that
[31:32] your spirit may be free to move. We pray
[31:35] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may be
[31:38] seated.
[31:41] And so tonight is going to be a service
[31:43] and I can say in two parts and I'll
[31:45] explain why. So this morning um uh uh
[31:50] there is a little part I needed to
[31:51] finish and I was not sure I would I
[31:54] intended to cover it but I was not quite
[31:56] sure how. And then at lunch there's a
[31:59] couple of brothers we were sitting at a
[32:00] table and then they start to talk about
[32:02] a topic and and then we start to
[32:04] exchange on on on on the topic of
[32:07] trauma. And I told the brothers, I says,
[32:09] "Okay." I said, "You know what?" I says,
[32:11] "We we going to cover that tonight."
[32:13] &gt;&gt; And so, there's going to be part one
[32:15] tonight, and we try to make it short,
[32:17] but just hit the high the high notes.
[32:20] And then we're going to go through the
[32:21] story of Rebecca, Becky, as we said we
[32:23] would. Uh, and just also to just to do
[32:27] an like in-depth analysis of of what
[32:32] they went through as I explained this
[32:34] morning. And what is the
[32:37] uh what is what what does a prophet
[32:40] change course on couple of things
[32:44] because he wanted different results with
[32:46] his daughter and there's a lot of things
[32:47] we can learn from that. All right. So is
[32:49] everybody's on board?
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So uh we just read that
[32:54] scripture. So the word deceitful it
[32:57] means
[32:59] it's sly it's insidious. Okay. and and
[33:02] and and and but the word desperately
[33:04] wicked, it means that it's weak, it's
[33:06] sick, it's frail, it's incurable.
[33:09] But we know the cure, the cure is the
[33:12] word of God.
[33:14] But on the on a on a human side,
[33:18] when our heart is wicked, there's
[33:19] nothing we can do. Man cannot change
[33:22] itself. Man doesn't have the power to
[33:25] change his heart, but God has the power
[33:28] to change his heart.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Couple of years ago when I was
[33:31] studying on that topic, I I I I ended up
[33:34] on a Bible commentary which I thought
[33:36] was so precise, so good because it
[33:39] really resembled in exactly what the
[33:42] prophet was saying. And so that this
[33:43] Bible commentary, I don't know who made
[33:45] it, but the truth is truth. So it says
[33:48] who can know it? It even hides itself
[33:51] from itself so that it its owners does
[33:55] not know it. A corrupt heart is the
[33:58] worst enemy the fallen creature can
[34:01] have. Remember this morning we studied
[34:03] we are our worst enemy. But what part of
[34:06] us is our worst enemy? It's the
[34:07] subconscious part.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; It is full of evil devices of deceit, of
[34:11] folly and abomination. And its owners
[34:13] knows not what's in him till it boils
[34:17] over
[34:19] &gt;&gt; and is often past remedy before the evil
[34:22] is perceived. Therefore, trust not in a
[34:24] man whose purposes are constantly
[34:26] changing and who is actuated only by
[34:28] motives of self-interest. Now, what is
[34:30] amazing here is that in that Bible
[34:33] commentary, and I find it as so being so
[34:35] right, is that it says the owner knows
[34:39] not what's in him till it boils over.
[34:42] Have you ever found yourself to be um I
[34:46] don't know, you're just going through
[34:47] something and suddenly you think out of
[34:49] nowhere you explode. it boils over and
[34:53] then you're like, "Oh my goodness, I
[34:54] think I got I think I'm sick of that. I
[34:57] think I got I'm over my head with that,
[35:00] but like I didn't realize." And that's
[35:02] where sometime if we don't know ourself,
[35:05] we we we wake up in a position where we
[35:08] went too far, said too much because it
[35:10] boils over and we didn't realize like
[35:13] that was getting under my skin, but it
[35:15] was hidden. Like you didn't realize how
[35:17] much you had enough. Then you explode to
[35:20] your wife or husband or to the kids or
[35:22] whatever in church like suddenly a
[35:24] sister comes to you and then here she
[35:26] goes again and then suddenly you just
[35:28] lose it in front of everybody and then
[35:30] you're like oh my goodness like I was
[35:32] able to hide that bitterness from
[35:33] everybody but now there's no chance I'm
[35:35] hiding anymore. No, everybody knows now.
[35:39] So this is how the hearts work. You know
[35:42] sometime it's even hidden from yourself
[35:44] but when it boils over you're like oh my
[35:50] Luther said same in the same spirit of
[35:53] what the brother brother Brandham said.
[35:55] I am not afraid of my own I am more
[35:57] afraid of my own heart than of the pope
[35:59] and all his cardinals. I have within me
[36:02] the great pope self.
[36:05] The enemy is not this big guy out there.
[36:07] Whatever situation we are fighting with
[36:10] ourself
[36:11] &gt;&gt; to have the right attitude to stay in
[36:14] love to stay in forgiveness. Amen.
[36:17] And so where I was this morning, so
[36:19] sorry that we have visitors tonight. And
[36:21] so maybe if you're not there this
[36:23] morning, you're just jumping on a moving
[36:24] train. So be careful your step. You
[36:26] know, it's we we were not stopping. So
[36:29] it's like a station, but we don't stop.
[36:30] So jump in.
[36:32] So because it's fresh, it's just this
[36:34] morning, so we just can't move on. So
[36:36] this morning the next slides where I was
[36:39] uh was you remember this this morning we
[36:42] we talk about the cause and effect of
[36:44] things like it thing doesn't appear
[36:46] suddenly and many parents sometime or
[36:48] even marriage was like well suddenly
[36:49] like I received the papers from the
[36:51] lawyers and now she wants to file
[36:53] divorce and then like suddenly no these
[36:55] these things doesn't happen suddenly
[36:57] it's a it's a buildup
[36:59] &gt;&gt; or your your kids run away and it's like
[37:01] I don't know what's wrong with him like
[37:02] yesterday he was smiley and we were
[37:04] having a meal at the table and we were
[37:06] joking. He seems not he seems he was
[37:08] okay and now today he ran away. It's
[37:12] like suddenly and I hear often people
[37:15] that's that's what they say because they
[37:17] were so clueless about what was going on
[37:19] in their marriage. So clueless about
[37:21] what was going or even a split like
[37:23] suddenly like half the church went
[37:25] &gt;&gt; suddenly.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; No, this is a buildup for many years.
[37:28] That's frustration that's under and
[37:30] under and sometime we don't realize
[37:32] what's going on
[37:33] &gt;&gt; till it boils over. Amen.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; And so we need to be sensitive because
[37:38] if we're sensitive and if we care like
[37:40] this morning we we showed how we care
[37:43] for others then we'll get some
[37:45] information. We need to be able to
[37:47] expose also um inconvenient conversation
[37:51] in families ask those taboo question
[37:56] &gt;&gt; because if we if we if we're silent on a
[37:58] topic it means that the devil is sitting
[38:01] right on that topic and he's talking
[38:03] &gt;&gt; oh he's doing the talking while you are
[38:06] afraid to bring it up because you know
[38:08] if you bring it up you're going to look
[38:10] like bad a bad dad. Well, let's go bad
[38:13] dad. Look bad and get better. I've I've
[38:17] had those inconvenient conversation with
[38:19] the kids where I knew like I'm asking
[38:21] the tough questions like I know like I
[38:25] told the girls like um I remember told
[38:27] the girls this is I my mo my my my my
[38:31] greatest fear is that I don't want to be
[38:32] this annoying dad where where I speak
[38:34] you're like here goes again
[38:37] when you start to get those rolling of
[38:38] the eyes like you're so annoying and so
[38:42] and so so this morning we taught on this
[38:44] chain of effect that will bring the
[38:46] heart of somebody in the house can be
[38:48] the husband, the wife, the kids, the the
[38:50] heart to drift away.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; When the heart drifts away, gets outside
[38:54] somewhere. They can be in their room,
[38:56] but they're connect to a computer and
[38:57] they're living out there somewhere else,
[38:59] but they're not their heart is not at
[39:01] home anymore.
[39:04] So now we want to look at in a different
[39:06] angle and and and to try to map
[39:11] how
[39:12] how does it pile up?
[39:16] How does it turn from a wounded spirit
[39:21] to a lock heart? Because most of the
[39:24] time is where we we realize we have a
[39:27] trouble a problem with either a a spouse
[39:30] or a kid or as a pastor it can be also
[39:33] somebody in church. Sometime when we
[39:35] wake up to realize we have a problem
[39:37] it's already too late because the heart
[39:38] is locked.
[39:41] And so we want to learn how we can
[39:43] intervene and discern much earlier in
[39:46] the process where when it's still
[39:48] flexible and when you can still access
[39:51] the heart before it gets locked. Okay.
[39:53] So, we're going to look at how this
[39:54] works.
[39:57] So, first of all, the prophet is saying
[40:02] again things doesn't h appear suddenly.
[40:05] He says if you went into a doctor's
[40:07] office and told him you were sick and
[40:08] told him your symptoms and he was in a
[40:10] hurry, he would probably give you a
[40:12] quote a a little prescription with some
[40:14] anesthetic and well, it's just a little
[40:16] scripture. Take the scripture. It's
[40:17] going to fix everything. Some sort of
[40:19] aspirin. The doctor is mereily trying to
[40:22] get rid of you
[40:24] &gt;&gt; just at that time because he hasn't time
[40:27] or he doesn't care. But a real good
[40:29] husband pastor doctor before he gave you
[40:32] the medicine. Sorry my guess I'm slip
[40:35] here. He would diagnose that case
[40:38] thoroughly
[40:39] &gt;&gt; till he found out what was wrong and
[40:42] then give you the medicine.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometime we find people going
[40:46] through these prayer lines out across
[40:48] the nation and they just they just run
[40:50] up and run up and think that the Lord
[40:52] ought to heal them right then. But there
[40:53] is something maybe down in there that
[40:55] was set before the Lord. And we set
[40:57] before the Lord until he reveals that
[40:59] what that is and there is something that
[41:01] God there's a reason for everything. And
[41:03] you got to find the reason first and
[41:06] then you can find what to work on.
[41:10] But sometimes for us we go straight to
[41:12] the symptoms. Well, you're being
[41:13] rebellious and the and the word is clear
[41:15] on that.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; No, I know I'm rebellious.
[41:19] My rebellion is not the problem.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; The problem is causing me to be
[41:22] rebellion.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we want to understand
[41:28] and we we laid those principle with
[41:31] quotes this morning as the prophet
[41:33] taught us that he's talking about the
[41:35] prostitute. He's talking about about
[41:37] many example and he he says it started
[41:39] in the home
[41:41] even abandoned kids left in the street
[41:43] nobody cares there's there's something
[41:46] that's happened to you and so
[41:53] ways that I've been hurt now also
[41:55] another principle that I've discovered
[41:57] many like years much year later for many
[42:00] years churches been concerned with sin
[42:03] if if if there's sin then everybody
[42:05] Everybody's like, "Red alert, there's
[42:07] sins. We got to solve the sin question.
[42:09] We got to get rid of sin. We got to
[42:10] clean sin." But what we don't realize is
[42:13] that hurt or trauma or a wounded spirit
[42:18] will have the same effect on a person
[42:23] than sin. And both of them needs to be
[42:26] brought to we need to bring our sins to
[42:28] the cross. But we need to bring our
[42:31] wounds and our hurt to the cross
[42:34] &gt;&gt; because God when Jesus died on the
[42:36] cross, we know it's a double atonement.
[42:39] He the blood of Jesus is for healing and
[42:42] for the forgiveness of sin. Now that's
[42:44] another sermon, but it's it's it goes
[42:46] both way and it's divine healing
[42:48] &gt;&gt; and to get rid of sin question and get
[42:51] rid of sickness. But when we talk about
[42:53] sickness sometime we just think about
[42:54] cancer, diabetes or something. But but
[42:57] we're talking about divine healing from
[42:58] the inside because Jesus says I came to
[43:01] heal the brokenhearted. So healing is
[43:03] not healing of the body which is which
[43:06] we we've heard so much and and that's
[43:08] what a problem sometime. I remember
[43:10] years ago when when when my
[43:12] father-in-law had had a depression and
[43:14] he had a nervous breakdown. He couldn't
[43:16] sleep anymore. He couldn't eat anymore.
[43:18] The church had no clue. I had no clue
[43:20] what to do with it. Now, if he'd had
[43:22] cancer, he had diabetes, we would we we
[43:25] would all come come and have a prayer
[43:27] for him, everybody, all the church life
[43:29] because we we've been trained how to
[43:31] deal with sickness,
[43:32] &gt;&gt; but we've not been trained how to deal
[43:35] with inward
[43:37] wounded spirits,
[43:38] &gt;&gt; emotional meltdown,
[43:41] &gt;&gt; anxiety disorder,
[43:44] &gt;&gt; uh all those inward, it's a mystery for
[43:47] the church.
[43:50] Somebody comes with a broken arm with a
[43:52] a cast you say and everybody wants to
[43:54] sign their name
[43:57] on it. Oh, brother, can I sign mine?
[43:59] Everybody runs. Oh, you broke your arm
[44:01] and you have a cast. They all sign a
[44:02] name. Somebody comes in church
[44:04] depressed. Everybody runs. Oh my. That's
[44:06] that sister. May she's she Oh my. That's
[44:08] that's trouble.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to sign up for being
[44:13] surrounded by somebody that's an
[44:14] emotional breakdown.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Why? because we don't understand those
[44:19] things.
[44:20] So that's why we need to teach on those
[44:22] things
[44:24] &gt;&gt; and that I was I'll be honest now I'm
[44:27] going another route so it's an extension
[44:30] but I was troubled when my own
[44:33] father-in-law so I was the assistant
[44:35] pastor and my own father-in-law goes on
[44:37] a breakdown
[44:39] there's two reason why I went that road
[44:41] of teaching on those things first it was
[44:44] my inability to be a father
[44:48] okay so I'm a minister God bless blessed
[44:50] the ministry. Some people love my
[44:52] ministry. God is in there. Holy Spirit
[44:54] is in there. But I come back home and
[44:55] I'm a poor father. And at one point I
[44:58] had to be honest. It's not working. So
[45:00] that number one, this I'm missing
[45:02] something.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; And the second reason why I started
[45:06] studying those things is my own
[45:07] father-in-law, which the pastor of a
[45:09] church
[45:11] has an emotional breakdown, nervous
[45:14] breakdown. He's tired. His his nervous
[45:16] system breaks and he can't sleep
[45:17] anymore. He's he he was trembling. He
[45:20] couldn't eat anymore. It was a serious
[45:21] condition. And nobody knew what to do
[45:24] with that. And on top of that, some
[45:26] people in the church was like, "Well,
[45:27] maybe something hiding here." And and
[45:30] maybe he did something and and and
[45:32] everybody's like like, you know, Job's
[45:34] friends.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Everybody's clueless, but everybody and
[45:37] I start to call around some pastors
[45:39] like, "What do we do?" Like, I have a
[45:41] pastor. He's down. And I don't know. and
[45:44] and I I I didn't get zero support, zero
[45:48] understanding. And I said, "This is
[45:49] wrong. There is something wrong within
[45:51] our ranks. We h we don't know what to do
[45:54] with depression."
[45:56] &gt;&gt; It's like it's not supposed to happen.
[45:57] If you're full of the Holy Ghost, you're
[45:59] not supposed to go through these and
[46:00] it's probably some hidden sins or God is
[46:03] trying to tell you you're not at your
[46:04] place and so much theories. And I was
[46:06] not buying none of that.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; But I didn't have the answer.
[46:11] So that's where I started to to dig in
[46:13] and try to start to study and try to
[46:15] find answers. There is answers in the
[46:17] word for that.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; But it was overlooked
[46:21] &gt;&gt; because all those years wounds of the
[46:24] body. Oh my. Come in in prayer.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Wounds of uh of the soul. It's a sin
[46:30] question. Well, go to the cross. Wounds
[46:33] of the spirit. Psychology. Put that in
[46:36] the garbage. Amen.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; So the church was forbidden
[46:41] of helping people on the emotional level
[46:44] &gt;&gt; and on the wounded spirit because it was
[46:46] labeled psychology.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; But what we what we've missed is that
[46:50] the prophet says that the greatest
[46:52] battle ever fought was in the mind.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; But when people's mind breaks because
[46:58] they lost a battle on the field, then
[47:01] the church is like, "Well, you know,
[47:03] &gt;&gt; we're going to pray for you.
[47:06] like go away.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; It's inconvenient because we don't know
[47:10] what to do with you.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; So when I talk about ways I have been
[47:15] hurt right away people are like well
[47:16] hurt. What is he talking about? I'm
[47:20] filled with the Holy Ghost. I live in
[47:21] the presence of God. I'll never get
[47:22] hurt. Well go that go tell that to
[47:25] brother Brandham. And standing in the
[47:27] gap
[47:28] he says I've been cut. I've been
[47:30] wounded. I've been on a battlefield.
[47:32] I've been scarred all over.
[47:34] And I'm so grieved that I I want to live
[47:37] in the wood and I don't want to mess
[47:38] with preachers anymore and churches
[47:40] anymore. And I just want to be this
[47:42] rugged guy. I don't have to cut my hair.
[47:44] I don't have to do my beer and I I'm
[47:46] going to trap my wife and we're going to
[47:48] live in the woods. Well, that sounds a
[47:49] great plan for a healthy marriage.
[47:52] When God talked to the prophet, he says,
[47:54] "Carry your plan and your wife's going
[47:57] to leave you."
[47:58] We overlook these things. But what God
[48:00] is telling him is that if you keep that
[48:02] complex that you have cuz you're so
[48:04] hurt, you're going to bring your
[48:07] marriage to the ground cuz she's going
[48:08] to leave you.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; If it was not for the grace of God,
[48:12] those wounds in his spirit would have
[48:15] and and and greater than that. I was I
[48:17] was having fellowship with brother Moses
[48:19] on that topic and and there's a full
[48:21] sermon on that. Maybe one day we can
[48:23] come back and preach on that. But just
[48:25] just a short thing on it and and we I've
[48:29] for many years I've studied standing in
[48:30] the gap and for many years I've missed
[48:32] the most important part and the most
[48:35] important part was brother Roy Border's
[48:37] dream.
[48:39] Nobody knows what I'm talking about
[48:40] probably. But brother Roy Roy Border's
[48:42] dream was and he he tells the dream be
[48:45] when he start the sermon standing in a
[48:48] gap but he gives the interpretation of
[48:49] the dream at the end of the sermon and
[48:52] most of the time we don't connect the
[48:53] dots together but the dream was Roy
[48:56] Borders he says we were sitting there at
[48:58] the ta lord's table the lord's table is
[49:01] communion table and he says the pillar
[49:02] of fire came brother I took you away and
[49:05] brought you somewhere else and he says I
[49:06] was crying bring him back bring him back
[49:09] where is the prophet And then he says
[49:11] later on he says the pinfari brought you
[49:14] back but you had been changed.
[49:16] And so the prophet says remember now
[49:18] being changed because later I'll tell
[49:20] you what it means. Then he goes on sorry
[49:23] then he goes on to the story of having a
[49:25] complex being scarred losing the feeling
[49:28] for the people wanted to live in the
[49:30] woods like Elijah. And that's what
[49:32] Christian do when we have a complex and
[49:34] we're wounded we'll try to find a
[49:35] scripture and make disguise our complex
[49:38] as something spiritual. And that's what
[49:40] he did. Well, he told God, "Am I not a
[49:43] prophet like the Old Testament so I can
[49:45] live in the woods?" But he says, "I was
[49:47] just being selfish. Just wanted to go
[49:49] fishing and hunting. I wanted to be a
[49:51] guide all my life." And so also all his
[49:53] life, he had this desire to be
[49:55] something, a guide, but that's not what
[49:57] God planned. God's plan for him for him
[49:59] was was to be a prophet and do the work
[50:02] of an evangelist.
[50:04] And so at the end of the sermon,
[50:07] he says, the prophet says, "I need, he
[50:11] says," my heart's not right. I've built
[50:14] a complex. And it's so easy to build a
[50:16] complex, and I lost I lost my heart, my
[50:20] burden for the people. And he says,
[50:22] "Something needs to be changed." He
[50:24] says, "You see now, brother Roy Borders,
[50:26] that's what it meant. Being changed.
[50:29] Something needs to been changed. My
[50:31] heart needs to change because I still
[50:33] think that he should have listened to
[50:34] me. I'm still hurting. So that dream is
[50:37] really important because since the
[50:39] prophet gave it an interpretation, it's
[50:41] equivalent to a vision.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; And that vision was that God took the
[50:46] prophet away from the communion table to
[50:48] change him. So God took this complex
[50:51] seriously.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; So complex is not just a little side
[50:55] note, right?
[50:57] &gt;&gt; But a complex is a set. So in psychology
[51:00] because the word complex comes from the
[51:03] psy come it's a it's a it's a it's a
[51:05] term from psychology which the prophet
[51:09] used
[51:10] &gt;&gt; and he explained what a complex is in
[51:12] the spiritual world he called it a dark
[51:14] cloud or a complex wrapped around you he
[51:18] says it is so easy to build one
[51:21] but why so Christian says well if you're
[51:23] filled the holy ghost you'll never have
[51:24] one it's not true it's a great
[51:28] misunderstanding like we have so much.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; So the prophet
[51:34] has this this complex he he's he's in
[51:38] that. So a complex the the term complex
[51:42] mean it's a so the word complex first of
[51:44] all it's not the first term is not uh in
[51:48] psychology is complex is it's a
[51:50] combination of thing. So if you combine
[51:53] couple of different material and you
[51:55] make something you call it a complex.
[51:56] It's a complex. It's a you've mix
[51:59] different things, you put it together,
[52:00] and it's a complex. But in psychology,
[52:03] it's a it's different feelings
[52:06] that gets together
[52:09] and becomes a person a personal trait
[52:13] that you have. It becomes like your new
[52:15] personality. But it's a sets of negative
[52:18] feelings you have that you had through a
[52:20] wound. You're not born with those
[52:22] complex. Even though some can be traced
[52:25] back to genetic and and like your the
[52:28] prophet gives the example of Irish and
[52:30] this like some cultural that are passed
[52:33] by. But main the main the main complex
[52:36] is something you went through
[52:39] and it becomes like a trauma. We're
[52:42] going to explain how trauma works after
[52:44] we've shown that diagram and how to get
[52:46] rid of trauma,
[52:48] how to get delivered from that. So ways
[52:51] that I've been hurt is what we call a
[52:54] wounded spirit.
[52:56] Remember this morning we talked about
[52:57] the age of innocence.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; So Adam and Eve were in their innocence
[53:01] and the devil came and strike and and
[53:04] and and since then humanity never
[53:07] recovered.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Okay. So but a wounded spirit
[53:15] something happened to you
[53:18] and even the discernment in prayer line
[53:20] the prophet would discern those things
[53:21] you remember I think it's on video yes
[53:23] it on video in Chicago
[53:25] &gt;&gt; the sister is there prophet saw a vision
[53:27] he says oh I see you this nervous
[53:29] condition so nervous condition in modern
[53:31] language it's it's it's anxiety disorder
[53:35] and anxiety disorder is caused by a
[53:37] trauma unresolved trauma
[53:40] And if you pile them, then you become
[53:42] more anxious because trauma tends to
[53:44] invite the next one.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; And invite the next one until you're
[53:49] totally locked in a corner. You have
[53:50] social phobia. You don't want to see
[53:52] anyone. You you hear somebody's talking
[53:54] about you like, I hate people. They talk
[53:56] about me, so don't say anything about me
[53:58] and this and that and and you become you
[54:00] become totally lock in your life. We're
[54:02] not called for that. We're called for
[54:04] freedom.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're called to be delivered of
[54:06] those things and to walk in full freedom
[54:09] with no fear.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; And that's possible.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; But that's what a wounded spirit will
[54:15] do. And so in this prayer line in
[54:19] Chicago,
[54:22] um the prophet says, "Oh, you see it's a
[54:25] nervous condition and and and oh, I see
[54:28] it's a lie. Oh, it's a minister." He
[54:30] said, "Imagine you're in prayer line.
[54:32] The minister says out loud, you're a
[54:33] witch. Imagine the church that that
[54:36] believe this evangelist. Now she's a
[54:37] witch. Oh great. Talk about a her and
[54:41] talk about a trauma in the church.
[54:42] Everybody looks you at a witch now.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; She didn't recover from that.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Until the truth was exposed.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Go your way sister. And he exposed this
[54:51] was a lie. You are not a witch.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; But she was traumatized and it wounded
[54:56] her spirit. And when your spirit is
[54:59] wounded, whatever happened to you and
[55:00] it's unresolved, it will make you feel a
[55:03] certain way.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; So wound will create a feeling and when
[55:09] it creates a feeling, it becomes an
[55:11] emotional issue.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; You think about it all the time. You
[55:16] cry. You can't sleep. You can't get over
[55:19] it. You talk about it all the time. And
[55:21] your husband or your wife doesn't know
[55:23] really what to do with it because we
[55:24] don't know how to approach these things.
[55:26] And we don't know how to pray. We don't
[55:29] know how to lead a wounded spirit that
[55:32] has an emotional issue. We don't know
[55:34] how to lead them in prayer to get their
[55:37] freedom.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; We don't know how to do that. Lord, help
[55:41] me. Lord, help me. But we're stuck with
[55:43] it. It doesn't work. Lord, help me. We
[55:45] talk about it. We cry. But it's still
[55:48] there.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; It's like a prison.
[55:52] And then because we're stuck with it,
[55:58] now we're looking for comfort.
[56:02] So a wounded spirit, this is the way
[56:04] you've been hurt. How it makes you feel
[56:06] cause an emotional issue. But if it
[56:09] doesn't make it, if you don't get
[56:10] healed, then you will start to act upon
[56:14] it. What it makes me do.
[56:20] You start slamming door. You start to
[56:22] avoid people. Uh that sister been called
[56:25] a witch. Guess what? There's an
[56:26] evangelist in town. You should come. Do
[56:28] you think she's excited? Oh, praise the
[56:30] Lord. I'll be called a witch another
[56:31] time. I'll stay home. Thank you.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; I've done that. So, she's not coming
[56:37] anymore. What? So, then it becomes a
[56:39] spiritual problem because every time
[56:40] there's an evangelist doing a prayer
[56:42] line, she stays home.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; And it looks like a great solution, but
[56:45] it's not because it's now keeping her
[56:47] from the house of the Lord. But we can
[56:50] blame the sister. It's a shame. That
[56:52] sister, she's been for with us for so
[56:54] many years, but every time it evangelist
[56:55] show up in town, she stays home. What a
[56:57] shame. She's should be ashamed of
[56:59] herself.
[57:00] So I call this other sister into church.
[57:02] And I told her that and then ended up
[57:04] she hears about it. Now she's got
[57:06] another problem. Now she doesn't come to
[57:09] church ever because everybody's talking
[57:12] about her. That's right.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; So she's finding solution to her
[57:15] emotional issues, but all the solutions
[57:17] are bad.
[57:21] And that's where it becomes
[57:25] what it makes me do.
[57:28] Then it becomes a spiritual issues.
[57:31] And what if that she in her background
[57:34] there's some drinking in the family and
[57:37] now she's so anxious she developed an
[57:39] anxiety disorder. And and because you
[57:42] know alcohol is a problem in the family,
[57:44] then she started drinking just a little
[57:45] bit to to to feel a bit better about it
[57:48] because when she drinks it makes her
[57:49] feel calmer for a little while. We know
[57:52] what it does and then it's worse or she
[57:55] needs now she needs pills, she needs
[57:56] medication, she needs something to do.
[57:58] And so
[58:00] so this is how the buildup how it's
[58:03] piling.
[58:09] So we had quote this morning. And I
[58:10] didn't have time to read, but
[58:13] you take you take a a you take a girl
[58:16] that's been What amazes me also in the
[58:18] office when I talk with people and we
[58:20] when we counsel is the power of words.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; People remember stuff they heard when
[58:26] they were young
[58:27] &gt;&gt; in school. A comment.
[58:30] I was dealing with a young man um a
[58:33] couple of time ago
[58:35] and and a guy in school told him, "Man,
[58:40] you look like a gay."
[58:43] It didn't look like much. But that word
[58:46] hit him so hard that he started doubting
[58:49] like
[58:51] the power of word. You know we we talk
[58:53] often time we talk about spoken word
[58:55] &gt;&gt; but spoken words works for positive
[58:58] &gt;&gt; but it works also for the bad words is
[59:00] power words are weapon
[59:03] &gt;&gt; and it amazes me sometime you're sitting
[59:05] in the office you're 30-year-old
[59:06] 40year-old time doesn't remove those
[59:09] words and then when you when I try to
[59:12] trace back because then that person has
[59:15] a certain belief she believes something
[59:17] about herself or himself and like where
[59:19] did you get this where's the first time
[59:21] you heard that and People keep thinking,
[59:25] "Yeah, yeah, I remember. Yeah, I was in
[59:28] school. Yeah, the guy you said that and
[59:30] it it hit me and it stayed with me. I
[59:33] was hunt." So the devil took those words
[59:35] and haunted you with that and it became
[59:38] something unresolved.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; And then
[59:42] then the guy wants to prove he's not
[59:44] he's not gay. So he start to go out with
[59:46] girls and try to sleep with them just to
[59:49] prove himself that he's and so it
[59:51] becomes now a spiritual issues
[59:53] &gt;&gt; because now that emotional issues will
[59:56] lead him in sin if he doesn't get it
[59:58] resolved with the Lord.
[1:00:01] But then if you keep doing what you're
[1:00:04] doing, try to resolve with false
[1:00:06] solution and false comforting, drinking,
[1:00:10] drugs, pornography,
[1:00:12] uh you know, sinful life, whatever
[1:00:13] you've choose to to do to cope, stay
[1:00:16] away from church, whatever. And then you
[1:00:18] know those people that avoid church and
[1:00:20] they avoid church and this this is why a
[1:00:23] lot of people that are and I don't want
[1:00:25] to hurt any feelings but a lot of people
[1:00:27] that are in that movement of tape only
[1:00:29] in homes
[1:00:31] you scratch the surface you don't have
[1:00:34] to scratch the surface a lot to discover
[1:00:36] that under that behind they're hiding
[1:00:39] their pain
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; they've been hurt in church
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; by ministers or something and then when
[1:00:44] that doctrine came it sounded like a
[1:00:46] great idea and their spiritualize a
[1:00:49] wound that well anyway I didn't trust
[1:00:51] those preachers well anyway I didn't
[1:00:53] trust church
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; so yeah the bride of Christ will be
[1:00:56] something special I'll be in my home
[1:00:58] listening to tapes everybody will listen
[1:01:00] so I'm on my own so I won't get hurt
[1:01:02] anymore
[1:01:05] that's just one example
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; how we can spiritualize it make it sound
[1:01:09] really message
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; while it's totally contrary to the word
[1:01:13] but why did you why did that spirit that
[1:01:16] say quit church and play tapes in your
[1:01:18] home and that's like the great things to
[1:01:19] make the rapture. Why did it appeal to
[1:01:22] you but not this one?
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Because you needed that.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; But then when those things are not dealt
[1:01:30] and they don't find healing, then that's
[1:01:32] where it becomes
[1:01:36] that's you don't do it anymore. That's
[1:01:39] what you become.
[1:01:41] And that's where you become a lock
[1:01:43] heart.
[1:01:44] And when somebody is locked in his
[1:01:46] heart,
[1:01:48] that's where it's so hard to reach them
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; because now they're set in their ways.
[1:01:55] They forgot that they've been wounded.
[1:01:57] They forgot that they had an emotional
[1:01:59] issues because they don't feel it
[1:02:01] anymore because now the heart is hard.
[1:02:04] They don't cry anymore about it.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; No. No. I I forgave them.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; No, you didn't forgave. A lot of a lot
[1:02:13] of Christians think they forgive, but
[1:02:15] what they did is they just excused that
[1:02:17] person. Well, you know, they didn't
[1:02:18] meant it. It's it's okay. It's okay.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; That's not forgiveness.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; The hurt is still there.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; So, most of the law I see a lot of
[1:02:29] Christian in my office that don't know
[1:02:31] what forgiveness is.
[1:02:33] They think if they stop talking about it
[1:02:36] and so I I'll show you what what what
[1:02:38] what Christians do when they think they
[1:02:40] forgave.
[1:02:41] So they get they get hurt, you know,
[1:02:43] boom. And now it hurts them and they're
[1:02:47] okay. And and they're like, "Ah, ah,
[1:02:51] I need to forgive." And then when they
[1:02:53] forgive, they're like,
[1:02:57] and then they take it all inside.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I have forgive.
[1:03:03] That's not forgiveness.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; You didn't give it to the Lord.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; You took it inside because you want to
[1:03:09] be you'd want to I had the right
[1:03:11] attitude and sincerely we do that. We
[1:03:14] swallow because we don't know how to.
[1:03:16] And then we call that forgiveness.
[1:03:20] But when we bring it deep inside like
[1:03:22] that, it change who we are
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; because it's still there.
[1:03:28] Every time we see that person
[1:03:33] If your heart turns when you see that
[1:03:36] person or you're close to the same
[1:03:37] situation, it's because it's still
[1:03:39] inside of you.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; It's still affecting you. It's still
[1:03:42] causing you. And I'm not talking about
[1:03:44] you remember. You can remember in a way,
[1:03:47] but it but if your heart rate goes up or
[1:03:50] you sweat or or or it's not it's not
[1:03:52] solved. It's still inside of you and
[1:03:55] it's controlling you.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's true.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; And you have to cope. you have to do
[1:03:58] something else to do to compensate.
[1:04:03] So, but in our ranks and in most in the
[1:04:06] Christian world, I'd say because I've
[1:04:08] I've I've heard about it.
[1:04:11] We don't recognize the first two.
[1:04:15] The first two wounded spirit emotional
[1:04:18] issues is labeled psychology. We don't
[1:04:20] go there. So, the only thing most
[1:04:22] churches recognize is spiritual issues.
[1:04:25] He's drinking. He doesn't go to church.
[1:04:27] He ran away. He's slamming door. He
[1:04:29] didn't respect his parents
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; and he's locked. I talked to him.
[1:04:35] He's stubborn. He doesn't want to. And
[1:04:37] now we now we have a problem. So most of
[1:04:40] the time we wake up when there's
[1:04:42] spiritual issues. Well, he started he
[1:04:44] started drinking. So suddenly
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; he ran away. He slammed door.
[1:04:51] But
[1:04:53] the red flag should start earlier. And
[1:04:56] that's why we need to teach on these
[1:04:57] things because if we're parents and we
[1:04:59] need to guard our children, our spouse
[1:05:01] and all that when when when our child is
[1:05:04] or or or a wives or a husband is deeply
[1:05:07] hurt about something, we should raise a
[1:05:09] red flag say okay we need to stop and
[1:05:11] deal with that because if if we don't
[1:05:14] attend and that's why God even was
[1:05:16] blaming shepherds because he says they
[1:05:19] don't bind the wounds, they don't heal
[1:05:21] them. So then there's infections
[1:05:25] then it spreads in other area.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; So
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; well you say well there's evil spirit
[1:05:35] involved in that. Absolutely evil
[1:05:38] spirits get involved around that stage.
[1:05:42] Demons will enter.
[1:05:44] So demons demons thrive and prosper on a
[1:05:49] wound.
[1:05:51] wound is an entry door.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; That's how they enter your life. And
[1:05:57] they enter your life as a com
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; because now because you're wounded and
[1:06:02] you don't know how to get benefit from
[1:06:04] the comforter because the comforter,
[1:06:06] Holy Spirit wants to come and heal you.
[1:06:08] Jesus says, "I came to heal the
[1:06:09] brokenhearted." But because we're not
[1:06:11] too much aware, we don't understand too
[1:06:13] much how this works. We kind of stay
[1:06:16] with it. We try to cope. A lot of people
[1:06:18] we cope. We try to just try to make make
[1:06:20] it work but it doesn't work.
[1:06:24] And so
[1:06:27] and I understand sometime people you
[1:06:29] know they some try to find answers in in
[1:06:32] just pure psychology and it doesn't
[1:06:34] work. The answer is not there. Some try
[1:06:37] to find the answer just in dealing with
[1:06:40] sins,
[1:06:42] dealing with behavior
[1:06:44] like I don't care like you're you're
[1:06:46] dying inside that's fine. But when your
[1:06:48] behavior is wrong, then I get aware.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; That's why church or families that just
[1:06:54] focus on rules and behavior, you're
[1:06:56] missing the point
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; because we get alerted by bad behavior,
[1:07:03] but we never get alerted by bad insight
[1:07:06] in the sense that he's wounded. He's not
[1:07:08] doing good.
[1:07:10] Like I said this morning, how was your
[1:07:11] day? But we were not interested to know.
[1:07:15] Do we really care about what's going on
[1:07:18] inside? And if we really care about
[1:07:20] what's going on inside, then we can
[1:07:22] care. We can attend. We can bring
[1:07:24] healing. We can pray with someone.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; If I go to church and I walk and I walk
[1:07:32] around as a pastor, I do it with my
[1:07:35] family. I do it my wife. I look at my
[1:07:37] wife's eyes. I don't even have to look
[1:07:38] at her. when we become sensitive and we
[1:07:41] become connected to our wife. I remember
[1:07:45] it's funny even my kids sometime I
[1:07:47] remember one day one of my daughters I'm
[1:07:49] in the kitchen and I'm she's by me but I
[1:07:52] feel her because we're so connected and
[1:07:53] I'm like I was about to say her name but
[1:07:56] anyways I says are you good? She says
[1:08:00] yeah daddy I'm good. I says no you're
[1:08:03] not. Some there's there's a heaviness
[1:08:06] with you. There's something. And she
[1:08:07] says, "No, I'm fine." And what's a that
[1:08:10] that time? It really amazes me and it
[1:08:12] amazes her because she didn't even
[1:08:14] realize yet that she was carrying
[1:08:16] something and I pick it up before she
[1:08:18] did.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; So, this is the level of connection that
[1:08:22] you can have. Now, think, "Oh, Brother
[1:08:24] Steve, it's so nice. It's because you're
[1:08:25] such a great father." No, no, you don't
[1:08:27] you forget don't forget my beginning. My
[1:08:29] beginning, I didn't care. I didn't care.
[1:08:32] My kids were sad. They were afraid of
[1:08:33] me. That's the guy I am. But when you
[1:08:36] connect to such a level that you're so
[1:08:38] closely and you you you have this this
[1:08:40] this fellowship of the heart then I then
[1:08:42] when when I said no you're not there's
[1:08:44] there's something there you carry some
[1:08:46] heaviness I don't know what it is and
[1:08:47] she says no I'm fine then she start
[1:08:49] thinking we kept we were in the kitchen
[1:08:51] I don't know and this and then she
[1:08:52] started crying she says I yeah you're
[1:08:54] right then she started crying and then
[1:08:56] she was like you pick it up before I did
[1:08:59] and then we were able to pray together
[1:09:01] and saw it was not a big deal but she
[1:09:02] was just having a burden something and I
[1:09:06] felt it. And same thing with my wife.
[1:09:07] Sometime I'm like, "Honey, there's
[1:09:10] something." And and sometimes she
[1:09:11] doesn't want to tell me cuz she doesn't
[1:09:13] want to bother me. Let's say I said
[1:09:14] something the the night before and it
[1:09:16] hurt her, but she doesn't want to
[1:09:18] complain. She loves me. She's like,
[1:09:19] "Yeah, it's my husband. I know he
[1:09:21] doesn't want to hurt me, but she carries
[1:09:23] it because I hurt her anyway. Even
[1:09:25] though she wants to be nice and don't
[1:09:26] want to bring it up." And then the next
[1:09:28] day I'm like, "Are you good?" "Oh, yeah,
[1:09:31] honey. It's okay." I says, "No, you're
[1:09:33] not." No, I know you. There's something
[1:09:35] here. No, honey. I'm telling you. I
[1:09:37] says, honey, you're not good. Let's sit
[1:09:40] down. Talk to me. She said, I hate it. I
[1:09:43] cannot hide you anything.
[1:09:46] You can be connected where you care
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; and you attend. And so, she was wounded.
[1:09:52] It was not even emotional that much
[1:09:54] because she's not crying. She looks
[1:09:56] okay, but I felt the heaviness.
[1:10:00] And she does the same for me. She my
[1:10:01] wife look at me in the eyes and she
[1:10:03] knows she knows Steve like no yeah it's
[1:10:08] a bit tough right now
[1:10:10] and so when we become sensitive like
[1:10:12] that as a pastor now I can walk in the
[1:10:15] church and I I look at people in the
[1:10:17] eyes people I know and I know you know
[1:10:20] when people are you're about to shake
[1:10:22] their hands and they they can't look in
[1:10:23] the eyes because they have to hide
[1:10:25] because you know the eyes is the door to
[1:10:27] the heart this is something I invite
[1:10:30] couples to
[1:10:32] It's pretty pretty intimidating.
[1:10:34] Okay, I'll give you a challenge. Before
[1:10:36] you go to bed, you got to sit in front
[1:10:38] of each other. Now you're laughing
[1:10:41] because it's a huge challenge.
[1:10:43] Sister,
[1:10:46] that's what I do in my office sometimes
[1:10:48] when when when when couples don't
[1:10:49] understand when I when I talk about
[1:10:51] connecting, they don't get it. It's
[1:10:52] like, "What do you mean connecting? What
[1:10:53] do you mean connecting?" I says, "Okay."
[1:10:55] I said, "Do you want to try it?" They're
[1:10:57] like, "Okay." I said, "Okay, put your
[1:10:59] chairs one in front of the other."
[1:11:00] They're like, "Okay,
[1:11:02] so chairs one for us." Just say, "Hold
[1:11:04] your hands. Now look at each other in
[1:11:06] the eyes and stare. Stay there. Lock
[1:11:08] yourself in in your spouse's eyes."
[1:11:12] That's amaz that that exercise tells a
[1:11:14] lot.
[1:11:16] And then one side if crack if it crack
[1:11:20] diversion because they don't want to be
[1:11:23] somebody to look in their heart.
[1:11:26] Some will start crying
[1:11:28] because when you look somebody in the
[1:11:31] eyes and you care,
[1:11:33] you're asking not a braintobrain
[1:11:35] connection, but your heart is asking for
[1:11:38] a heart connection. If the heart is
[1:11:39] wounded in a relationship, the other one
[1:11:41] will not be able to do that.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; And then I asked the question, okay,
[1:11:47] what is your thought? Why can't you
[1:11:49] look? And then right away they're going
[1:11:52] to say because of this. And sometime
[1:11:54] it's because of certain things and then
[1:11:56] we have to solve it. Then we try it
[1:11:58] again.
[1:12:00] It's a it's a huge challenge. Pretty
[1:12:01] intimidating.
[1:12:03] Okay. But when we talk about connection,
[1:12:06] it's it's because most of the time a
[1:12:09] couple we look in the same direction. We
[1:12:11] want to look, but we never look at each
[1:12:12] other. Have you done this? Yeah. You
[1:12:14] know this. We're partners. We we walk
[1:12:16] side by side and it's it's part of the
[1:12:18] journey, but we have to stop sometime
[1:12:20] and look at each other. Are you good?
[1:12:23] No, I'm not good. Lately, it's been
[1:12:26] rough. You've been you've been rough
[1:12:27] with me and I'm hurting.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, you're right. I've been going
[1:12:31] through this and I'm not been patient.
[1:12:34] And so, me and my wife have those
[1:12:35] conversation
[1:12:37] more than more than once a month that we
[1:12:40] have to stop and say, "Okay, we've been
[1:12:43] busy lately. We forget each other. we
[1:12:45] have to reconnect because and when you
[1:12:48] reach that connection you get it's like
[1:12:51] uh you get used to it like you you know
[1:12:54] now the level you can reach
[1:12:56] but most of us didn't have that at home
[1:12:58] or mother maybe never looked at us in
[1:13:00] the eyes cuz she like it's weird and for
[1:13:03] some of you like whoa that's weird
[1:13:07] because we're not you we are so
[1:13:10] disconnected
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; and that's why we live in such a lonely
[1:13:14] world.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; So, it's a challenge. So, anyway, let's
[1:13:18] go back to this. I need I I I I told
[1:13:21] myself I got certain time for first
[1:13:22] part. So, I'm almost done for the part
[1:13:24] one. So,
[1:13:27] first part is just label psychology.
[1:13:30] Second part it's behavior.
[1:13:34] So, some some people are just behavior.
[1:13:37] Other they just the psychology word
[1:13:39] they're just world they're just and and
[1:13:41] other everything is spiritual. It's a
[1:13:43] demon. It's a demon. It's a demon. It's
[1:13:44] sidamine. And I would say everybody's
[1:13:46] right, but everybody's wrong because
[1:13:49] it's a combination of three.
[1:13:52] It's emotional, then it becomes
[1:13:54] spiritual, and then spirits get
[1:13:56] involved, and then you got a problem. Do
[1:13:59] you realize it's a balancing? It's not
[1:14:01] just demons. It's not just emotions.
[1:14:05] It's not just hurt.
[1:14:08] And I feel like in my heart, this brings
[1:14:10] a lot of answers. And that when when
[1:14:13] then it it carries for too long and you
[1:14:17] got a runaway teenager. When he when he
[1:14:20] has courage enough to run away from the
[1:14:22] house
[1:14:24] or when when the spouse has courage
[1:14:25] enough to file papers or to say I'm
[1:14:29] going at my parents or I'm renting an
[1:14:30] apartment
[1:14:32] that's tough because it means that it
[1:14:35] you needed to be locked to be able to
[1:14:37] make such a stand. You had to think
[1:14:39] about it for a long time. And when you
[1:14:41] reach that don't say too late it's too
[1:14:43] late but sometime it's too late for that
[1:14:45] moment like
[1:14:47] sometime people are like can you meet my
[1:14:49] son and and like I know I I've been
[1:14:52] watching I've met him before sometime
[1:14:55] I've met it much earlier in the process
[1:14:57] but we cannot resolve it's it's and then
[1:15:00] then and sometime parents are sometime
[1:15:02] brother Steve can you meet my son can
[1:15:03] you help him I'm like yes I will sit
[1:15:05] with him but I know in my heart that
[1:15:07] thing is locked I will do it because
[1:15:09] when I went in the Well, nobody called
[1:15:11] me. Like, brother Steve, what's wrong
[1:15:13] with you? You don't show up in church. I
[1:15:14] stopped going to church. Nobody called.
[1:15:16] Nobody. Nobody said anything. I just
[1:15:18] walked away from church.
[1:15:20] No deacons call, no pastor, nobody. I
[1:15:22] just disappear. And I don't know. It was
[1:15:24] probably convenient like, well, it's
[1:15:25] time. It's about time he leave. Anyway,
[1:15:27] what was he doing in church anyway? He
[1:15:29] didn't take communion and uh and they're
[1:15:31] sitting in the back and they leave like
[1:15:32] they were not interested. So uh yeah you
[1:15:35] know good riddance
[1:15:38] because church can be locked also lock
[1:15:40] heart
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; well they lose the burden for souls
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; and and then people who struggle they
[1:15:46] become inconvenient
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; like whether we look like it's such a
[1:15:49] bad testimony
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; church needs to be hospital again
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; where the sick can come
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; blue hair and pursing and tattoos and
[1:15:59] well we're going to look like well Jesus
[1:16:01] that's what the Pharisee hated
[1:16:03] cuz he was about he was he was with
[1:16:05] those kind of people cuz he says that's
[1:16:07] the one who need a doctor.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; But when the church becomes so polished
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; and we want to have everything so much
[1:16:15] in order.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; When we're so focused on behavior,
[1:16:18] people need to behave because this other
[1:16:21] church going to think that we are now
[1:16:22] worldly and that we accept worldly
[1:16:24] people. So we want to straight the
[1:16:26] people's behavior before God fix the
[1:16:29] inside. And church put a lot of pressure
[1:16:32] on the outside appearance.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; We start by the hair and the skirt and
[1:16:36] the TV before we care by about the
[1:16:39] inside. And that's a huge mistake
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; cuz people did conform on the outside
[1:16:45] not knowing that God wanted to heal from
[1:16:48] deep deep inside.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; That's what we call religion. Religion,
[1:16:56] it's an outside process to make us feel
[1:17:00] good and look better. But God is not
[1:17:02] interested in religion. That's why when
[1:17:04] Jesus came, he went contrary to the
[1:17:06] religion of that moment. He was he was
[1:17:09] going to people
[1:17:12] that needed
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; when Jesus went to Zakius, did he say,
[1:17:17] "By the way, man, shame on you." Like,
[1:17:19] "Yeah, I came in your house for supper,
[1:17:22] but let's talk, man.
[1:17:24] You're a thief. You should be ashamed of
[1:17:26] yourself.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; No. Jesus,
[1:17:31] and this is a big mystery, but Jesus
[1:17:33] bypasses behavior
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; and care for Zakius.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; And when he did that, the love of God
[1:17:41] unconditional that doesn't look at your
[1:17:43] behavior like do you think Jesus didn't
[1:17:45] know he was a thief? Imagine all the
[1:17:47] town looking at Jesus like of all people
[1:17:51] like he going he's going for supper like
[1:17:54] it's like if he was a prophet like if
[1:17:56] you believe the message you would know
[1:17:58] like he chose the worst house in town.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Did you see the party he lit last night
[1:18:03] and now Jesus showing up there like oh
[1:18:06] my goodness discernment. Hello.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; But Jesus didn't care what he looked
[1:18:12] like. He went in the worst town. Not
[1:18:14] worst town. The worst house in town. the
[1:18:16] the worse.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; And when he went, it was not to to talk
[1:18:21] about Zakius's behavior.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Scripture doesn't even mention that he
[1:18:25] talked about his behavior.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; But God visited him that night. And then
[1:18:31] Zakius because do you know what? He knew
[1:18:34] he was wrong.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; So at the end of the supper, he says,
[1:18:39] "You know what, Lord? I'm going to fix
[1:18:41] this."
[1:18:44] probably Jesus his heart's like, "Yeah,
[1:18:45] I knew you would. That's why I came."
[1:18:48] Praise the Lord. Okay, we got to move
[1:18:49] on. But it's so good. It's
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; so good. This is the gospel.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:56] All right. So, we get hypnotized by
[1:18:58] people's behavior and it's a mistake. If
[1:19:01] somebody doesn't dress like we we give
[1:19:03] them the cold shoulders like, "Oh, you
[1:19:05] know,
[1:19:06] if we feel this way, it's we have too
[1:19:09] much religion inside of us." Right.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so what's the remedy? We
[1:19:16] we I've mentioned that quote all the
[1:19:18] service before. Um, oh, just this one
[1:19:22] before because I got mixed I got notes
[1:19:24] here and notes that's on there and so
[1:19:26] they're the same but they're not the
[1:19:28] same slides.
[1:19:30] So, the prophet is is giving us here a
[1:19:32] key that that explain the diagram at the
[1:19:35] top. We find out that many people try to
[1:19:38] find comfort by drinking. Now drinking
[1:19:41] is it becomes a sin. It's a spiritual
[1:19:42] issue. You know we have saying this
[1:19:45] which is pretty well known among us
[1:19:46] today that many minister drink sometime
[1:19:48] before going to the pulpit. Take a good
[1:19:50] heavy drink of intoxication. It's been
[1:19:52] known to seeing minister on the platform
[1:19:54] that even stagger under the influence of
[1:19:55] liquor and that not that ought not to be
[1:19:58] like prophets obvious like that's wrong
[1:20:00] but it should not be but is because many
[1:20:03] time we might condemn the man when maybe
[1:20:06] we ought not to do that do that we ought
[1:20:10] to find back
[1:20:13] what's the trouble
[1:20:15] many of them were converted from alcohol
[1:20:17] and we found it that they're in that
[1:20:19] condition it's a disgrace and reproach
[1:20:21] but no more reproach than it would be to
[1:20:24] lie, steal, or lust after a winner or
[1:20:25] any other things. That's a commandment.
[1:20:27] So, he's saying we should ought not
[1:20:30] condemn the behavior, but we should go
[1:20:32] back and try to find there's a reason
[1:20:35] why he's going that road. And when we
[1:20:39] care for people, we care to find the
[1:20:41] cause.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; And believe me, I've done so many hours
[1:20:46] with people in the office. When you find
[1:20:49] the cause, which we now we're going to
[1:20:51] go into trauma, then when you find the
[1:20:54] cause and you bring it to the Lord, you
[1:20:57] dissolve in the blood of Jesus the
[1:20:59] reason why you're drinking. Why do you
[1:21:02] need pornography? Why do you need this
[1:21:05] fix?
[1:21:07] When Jesus touches that, the woman at
[1:21:11] the well, did Jesus told the woman, "You
[1:21:13] should stop now. You're at your sixth
[1:21:15] guy. Come on." Okay. Did you learn a
[1:21:18] seven will not fix Jesus didn't even
[1:21:22] he mentioned it but her question was
[1:21:26] deep
[1:21:28] where do we worship
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; right when she realized that that that
[1:21:32] that man was a man of God her deep
[1:21:35] question was like I don't understand men
[1:21:40] her question was where do we worship the
[1:21:43] Jew says this and Samaritan says that
[1:21:45] and but I Well, she had the deep
[1:21:48] conspiritual confusion inside of her and
[1:21:50] she started talk to Jesus. Jesus
[1:21:52] answered her deepest question.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; So, how do we do that? Well, we we read
[1:22:02] this uh I've mentioned it and but now we
[1:22:06] can read it together. What was the
[1:22:08] matter? You had to open the channel
[1:22:10] first. You've got to get the soldier,
[1:22:11] the Holy Spirit placed in that at the
[1:22:13] battlefront that takes God's word. He is
[1:22:16] the word and he stands there and there's
[1:22:17] nothing going to stop it then. There's
[1:22:19] nothing. Every one of the other channel
[1:22:21] is cleared out just like an old boiler
[1:22:23] with the flu stooped up. You put a fire
[1:22:25] and it'll blow your thing up. That's
[1:22:26] what the matter with so many blowup
[1:22:28] Christian is because they don't clean
[1:22:30] the channel out.
[1:22:33] They don't go down to the inside.
[1:22:37] So when we try to fix people just by
[1:22:39] fixing their behavior, we're wrong
[1:22:42] because the behavior is not the problem.
[1:22:44] The problem is the inside.
[1:22:47] You've got to clean it. Conscience,
[1:22:50] memory, thoughts, laying aside
[1:22:52] everything and coming from the inside
[1:22:56] out.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; So, there's some cleaning. So, and the
[1:23:02] cleaning is what? Clean what? Clean the
[1:23:04] behavior. The prophet says, "No, you
[1:23:06] clean the inside. There's been a wound.
[1:23:09] There's something there.
[1:23:14] And a lot of people don't realize when
[1:23:16] when you do stuff, there's a reason why
[1:23:18] you're doing it, but you forgot.
[1:23:22] And so the question I always tell people
[1:23:24] is you're not born that way. When did it
[1:23:28] start? Well, I remember and then we have
[1:23:30] a conversation and I take notes. Well, I
[1:23:33] remember the first time I did it was in
[1:23:36] school and my friend came offered me
[1:23:38] that. I says, "Okay, so that's when you
[1:23:40] started. But how was how was life at
[1:23:43] home then?
[1:23:44] Well, the week before I my daddy
[1:23:46] announced that he was leaving my mom.
[1:23:49] Okay. And you don't think it's related?
[1:23:51] No. No, it's not related. Okay. But how
[1:23:55] did you react? Well, I went in my room
[1:23:56] and I cried all night and couldn't sleep
[1:23:59] and Okay. And then you start to draw
[1:24:03] paint some because they forgot
[1:24:04] everything.
[1:24:06] And as you draw a painting of what it
[1:24:09] was then and what happened and what and
[1:24:11] then that that drug that thing became a
[1:24:14] a comforting and then you lay it out at
[1:24:16] one point it happens all the time tears
[1:24:20] start rolling and that's what the
[1:24:22] prophet was doing. He was doing that by
[1:24:23] vision.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; But we often time these days we don't
[1:24:28] have much vision but we still can care
[1:24:31] and ask questions because the prophet
[1:24:33] laid the principle. The Holy Spirit went
[1:24:36] back.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit went back. Oh, it's a
[1:24:40] dog. Oh, it's an evangelist who called
[1:24:42] you a wish. Oh, and there's many prayer
[1:24:44] lines. So if the Holy Spirit was going
[1:24:47] back to explain your anxiety disorder or
[1:24:51] whatever habit you had or whatever
[1:24:53] you're carrying, it means that we need
[1:24:56] to go back too.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Well, Steve, brother Steve, that's
[1:24:59] complicated. Well, are you worth it?
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Are you worth the complication?
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; There's a doctor. Amen. So, quickly now,
[1:25:10] trauma.
[1:25:12] So trauma is a wound. We were talking
[1:25:15] about the brother. I don't know if
[1:25:16] they're here tonight. Other brothers
[1:25:17] that were talking at lunch were I think.
[1:25:19] Yeah. Okay. You were the brothers are
[1:25:21] there. Okay. So they were explained to
[1:25:23] me that you know there's you know the
[1:25:25] congalles people are African people.
[1:25:27] Some of you left you know your refugees
[1:25:29] and it was tough. You know your mother
[1:25:30] running with you under bombs and and
[1:25:32] wars and and you know this is like we
[1:25:37] could say real trauma and yes absolutely
[1:25:39] real trauma. But there's a
[1:25:41] misunderstanding with trauma because
[1:25:44] trauma is not how big it was of of an
[1:25:47] event, but it's how you perceive it.
[1:25:53] The level of trauma is perception.
[1:25:57] I'll give you an example. You got a
[1:25:59] 5-year-old boy. He's going to school.
[1:26:02] It's I don't know. It's his first week
[1:26:03] and he get off the bus and mom's not
[1:26:06] used to Junior going and she's at
[1:26:07] grocery and she got delayed in traffic
[1:26:10] and she comes home 15 minutes after you
[1:26:13] Junior got off the bus. Now Junior got
[1:26:16] off the bus. He he enter in in in
[1:26:18] mommy's in in in his in his parents'
[1:26:20] home and the house is empty. Then he
[1:26:23] panics. He thinks mommy's dead. And for
[1:26:27] 15 minutes he goes to the process of
[1:26:30] mourning. He's sobbing. He's crying his
[1:26:32] life out. He's he's he's an orphan.
[1:26:37] Okay. Then mom comes in 15 minutes later
[1:26:40] and she finds Junior, you know, balling.
[1:26:44] He's panicking. He's shaking. He He He
[1:26:46] went through this whole thing. And
[1:26:48] mommy's like, "No, no, sweetheart. No,
[1:26:49] no. Mommy just came. Just came 15
[1:26:52] minutes late. It's okay. I was just at
[1:26:54] the grocery. Just just all these little
[1:26:56] words saying that. No, no, you're not
[1:26:58] experiencing that right now. It's just
[1:27:00] because we have our adult mind, but we
[1:27:02] won't realize that at the scale of a
[1:27:04] 5-year-old what he went through. But
[1:27:07] since that day,
[1:27:09] every time he got off the bus, he's he's
[1:27:12] sweating, he's nervous, and then he he
[1:27:14] because it's how he perceived it.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; And he can develop an anxiety disorder
[1:27:20] just with a simple things like that. And
[1:27:23] I'm talking about real things now. And
[1:27:25] it's amazing what I discovered in my
[1:27:27] office and the level of of a kid what he
[1:27:29] understood.
[1:27:32] I'll give you one example of one of my
[1:27:34] daughters, Mary, my oldest. One day my
[1:27:37] wife was so exhausted. She's
[1:27:39] homeschooling, pastor's wife,
[1:27:41] homeschooling kids and all that. And one
[1:27:43] day she's so exhausted. She says, "Oh,
[1:27:46] I'm so tired. I I feel like I got so
[1:27:48] much to do. I feel like I'm going to
[1:27:50] die."
[1:27:51] But my daughter heard that. And from
[1:27:54] that day, she started to do all the
[1:27:58] chores at home with my wife. And my wife
[1:28:00] was like, she was so impressed. She
[1:28:02] says, "Mary, she's amazing." She says,
[1:28:05] and so she couldn't sleep because when
[1:28:07] she heard what she when she was hearing
[1:28:09] my my wife doing dishes. She was in bed
[1:28:12] hearing the dishes and she couldn't
[1:28:14] sleep because she think she's still
[1:28:16] doing dishes. She might die.
[1:28:19] So, she was getting up and says, "Mommy,
[1:28:20] I want to help you. I can't sleep
[1:28:22] anyway." And so my wife was like, "Well,
[1:28:24] okay, sweetheart. You're so nice." And
[1:28:25] so Esther was like, "She's all happy. It
[1:28:26] looks something great." Like, "Wow,
[1:28:28] she's so devoted. She's so devoted, but
[1:28:30] she became devoted in the house out of a
[1:28:32] troll mine. Fear that she couldn't sleep
[1:28:34] because mommy." And so she was working
[1:28:36] like a slave. Not a slave, but just to
[1:28:38] make an image because she was trying to
[1:28:41] keep mom alive.
[1:28:44] That's a trauma.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; A word,
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; perception.
[1:28:49] Years. It took us years. And you know
[1:28:51] how she discovered that? My wife, she
[1:28:53] discovered that when she took time with
[1:28:55] Mary in her room, she took I went on a
[1:28:57] trip and she said, "You know what,
[1:28:58] Steve? I'm going to do while you're on
[1:29:00] this, I don't know what trip went
[1:29:02] preaching somewhere probably." She says,
[1:29:04] "I'm going to take one kid a night,
[1:29:06] sleep with them. They're going to sleep
[1:29:07] together in the room and have a chat in
[1:29:09] the bed, you know, special time before
[1:29:10] bedtime." And she says, "I'm going to
[1:29:12] have one night each. They'll have." And
[1:29:15] and during that that time, she
[1:29:17] discovered because she cared, took time.
[1:29:19] How you doing? How do you feel? And
[1:29:21] that's where my wife discovered that.
[1:29:23] And then when and it what's amazing is
[1:29:25] that when Mary said it even for herself,
[1:29:28] she realized that she was doing all that
[1:29:31] to try to keep in. Guess what they did?
[1:29:34] They prayed and they removed that trauma
[1:29:37] through prayer.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; So trauma, bombs, wars, but again, it's
[1:29:46] not the level, it's how you perceive. If
[1:29:48] you you could have been a refugee and
[1:29:50] going through all those things believing
[1:29:52] without a shadow of that you're coming
[1:29:54] out that alive and it will not affect
[1:29:57] you as much as Junior that came out of
[1:29:59] the bus and totally had a meltdown
[1:30:02] because he thought mom died.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; So we cannot compare our past. Well, you
[1:30:08] had it tough. I had it easy. Well, I
[1:30:10] didn't have much. No, it's what you went
[1:30:12] through and how you perceived it.
[1:30:15] So this why sometime many time often
[1:30:18] time we minimize
[1:30:20] the trauma of a kid because we think as
[1:30:23] an adult so we don't take care and we
[1:30:27] don't bring healing was like well Donnie
[1:30:29] you know Junior just mommy was just at
[1:30:31] the grocery I just arrived 15 minutes
[1:30:33] later you were always safe you were fine
[1:30:35] and Junior's like okay
[1:30:38] you try to convince him what you just
[1:30:40] experienced is not real but it was real
[1:30:42] for him
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; okay so This is what trauma. So trauma
[1:30:46] is not measure on on on on on sometime
[1:30:50] and I'll give you another example
[1:30:51] message example. The twins there's twins
[1:30:54] both girls come from holiness background
[1:30:57] they go to school
[1:30:59] one gets mocked both get mocked at
[1:31:01] church at school because they're virgin
[1:31:04] and oh you're wasting your life in
[1:31:06] religion and you don't know anything
[1:31:07] about boys and one of the girl is like
[1:31:10] go take a walk like like I don't care
[1:31:12] what you're thinking. I'm a Christian. I
[1:31:14] like what I do. The other one took it at
[1:31:16] heart
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; and she had a meltdown. She it became
[1:31:20] she became so obsessed with those words
[1:31:22] that she heard. She ended up in in in in
[1:31:25] mentaliz.
[1:31:28] So you cannot have more close than that.
[1:31:31] They went through the same experience,
[1:31:32] same background, but one perceived it
[1:31:35] this way. And so it's just to tell you
[1:31:37] you can go through the same thing and
[1:31:38] the other one walks out
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; okay
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; and the other one dive in and your life
[1:31:45] changed forever
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; till a prophet came contacted her
[1:31:48] spirit. So her spirit became a wandering
[1:31:50] spirit trauma that's what it caused you
[1:31:52] live somewhere because you got to avoid
[1:31:54] pain. So she and then and you know what
[1:31:56] the prophet ca did he says you always
[1:31:58] wanted to marry a preacher when he saw a
[1:32:00] vision and when he died he did contact
[1:32:02] his spirit and brought back her identity
[1:32:05] because before the trauma before we
[1:32:08] before the devil despised the fact that
[1:32:10] she's a virgin she was sanctified and
[1:32:13] she was she had a call to marry a
[1:32:15] minister the devil messed that up but
[1:32:18] the prophet took her spirit and brought
[1:32:19] her back to her real estate her state
[1:32:21] condition before the trauma and then her
[1:32:24] eyes open. She came back to herself.
[1:32:28] So God wants to restore you prior to
[1:32:30] what has destroyed you.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; But how does it destroy you? Okay, we
[1:32:35] have keys now. So, oh, I thought I'd
[1:32:37] show trauma. So, trauma,
[1:32:41] trauma breaks your innocence.
[1:32:45] And what trauma will do is that you view
[1:32:48] life in a certain way, but then when you
[1:32:51] get wounded, you change your sets of
[1:32:54] belief.
[1:32:56] I'll give you an example.
[1:33:00] I'll take Mary again. So Mary, she
[1:33:02] sleeps at night. My wife could have been
[1:33:04] up vacuuming, washing dishes. Mary's
[1:33:07] sleeping. My mom is okay.
[1:33:10] Now she hears my my my wife says, "Man,
[1:33:13] I'm so so overwhelmed. There's so much I
[1:33:16] feel like I'm going to die, you know,
[1:33:17] just in just, you know, and then it it
[1:33:21] shocks her." And after that, she have a
[1:33:26] new belief system
[1:33:29] and that belief is not the truth. So
[1:33:33] that new so belief that are caused by
[1:33:36] trauma are unbelief.
[1:33:41] So trauma is there to bring unbelief in
[1:33:44] your life.
[1:33:45] Someone in church betrays you. So you
[1:33:47] come in church, you have a new church,
[1:33:49] all happy, everybody's nice. Everybody's
[1:33:51] there for the good. And then somebody
[1:33:53] betrays you, lie on you, whatever
[1:33:54] happened, misunderstanding. And then
[1:33:56] then you're like, before the trauma,
[1:33:58] everybody was nice. After the trauma,
[1:34:00] it's like I can't trust anyone in
[1:34:02] church.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; So what did the trauma induce? The
[1:34:05] trauma induced a change of belief. And
[1:34:08] that change of belief is not the truth
[1:34:10] is unbelief which is sin by the way. So
[1:34:13] trauma brings us into sin if we change
[1:34:16] our beliefs.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; You raise you you you you raise up in a
[1:34:22] Christian family. You want to get
[1:34:24] married and then a man cross your life a
[1:34:27] stranger or somebody in a church he's
[1:34:28] inappropriate. You get touched whatever
[1:34:30] of somebody family whatever you get
[1:34:32] abused and then you change your
[1:34:34] definition. All men are evil. I'll never
[1:34:36] get married.
[1:34:38] But before you say, "I'll never get
[1:34:40] married because that's the next stage."
[1:34:41] The first stage is all men are
[1:34:43] dangerous. They're all bad. They all
[1:34:45] dirty. New belief. It's unbelief. It's
[1:34:47] not true. God doesn't want. Yes, there's
[1:34:49] bad men out there, but there's a good
[1:34:50] one for you. This is how God wants to
[1:34:52] view this. But unbelief, the devil wants
[1:34:55] to to to put you in prison. So, he will
[1:34:58] put Christians and well, he will put
[1:35:01] human being in prison with trauma. That
[1:35:04] is that's his that is his greatest tool
[1:35:08] but it's unsuspected.
[1:35:12] There's many example
[1:35:14] if we go back to as a sisters called in
[1:35:16] a witch by an evangelist. Guess what?
[1:35:19] All evangelists are bad. If there's an
[1:35:21] evangelist in my church, it's not safe.
[1:35:22] I better stay home. Unbelief. It's not
[1:35:25] true. There was good evangelists out
[1:35:26] there that would not pretend to discern
[1:35:29] where they're just mocking the thing.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; But but but the devil cause trauma and
[1:35:35] then he'll say he'll give you your new
[1:35:37] belief. You see, you can't trust
[1:35:39] preacher. You see, you can't trust
[1:35:42] churches.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; You see, you can't trust your husband.
[1:35:45] Look at what he did. Isn't your husband
[1:35:48] dangerous? Lock your heart. You'll be
[1:35:50] better. Don't ever trust any man. Don't
[1:35:52] ever trust whatever new belief.
[1:35:56] But it doesn't stop there because that
[1:35:58] new belief now you have to take the next
[1:36:01] step to protect yourself.
[1:36:04] And that's where we come into what we
[1:36:06] call an oath.
[1:36:09] I will never trust a preacher again.
[1:36:13] I'll never step in a church again. I'll
[1:36:16] never open my heart to a pastor again.
[1:36:18] I'll never open my heart to my dad
[1:36:20] again. I tried. He He didn't even
[1:36:23] listen. He was looking at his cell
[1:36:24] phone. I'll never I'll never I'll never
[1:36:28] and it's amazing when I counsel people
[1:36:31] I'm waiting I'm looking for three things
[1:36:34] trauma belief oath
[1:36:37] and believe me I find them 99% of the
[1:36:40] time
[1:36:42] and it's what's amazing is I'm just
[1:36:44] asking question
[1:36:47] and people are people are telling me
[1:36:49] without me asking it is amazing every
[1:36:52] time I smile I write okay I find the
[1:36:53] oath okay I find the belief.
[1:36:56] People are telling you, "Yeah, I went
[1:36:58] through this and it was so difficult and
[1:37:00] and I told myself, you know what?
[1:37:02] They're all bad belief." And then I
[1:37:05] said, "You know what? I'll never go
[1:37:06] there." Oath.
[1:37:10] The problem with oath is you bound
[1:37:14] yourself with your own words.
[1:37:19] And then the devil, what it does, he
[1:37:22] takes the trauma, the new belief, the
[1:37:23] oath, you wrap it up and he hides it
[1:37:25] from you. And now you become enslaved
[1:37:29] to an invisible thing.
[1:37:32] And so
[1:37:34] you get girls like that that you know
[1:37:35] has been traumatized by boys, whatever,
[1:37:38] and then they're like, I'll never never
[1:37:40] get married. And then they forget about
[1:37:41] it. And then finally they they they
[1:37:44] there's this young men like, oh my
[1:37:45] goodness. Then they forget their oath.
[1:37:47] So they enter in courtship but they
[1:37:49] didn't lock down and courtship fails and
[1:37:52] they're they're they go in courtship for
[1:37:54] one month and then they back off and I
[1:37:56] don't know what's wrong with me. Every
[1:37:56] time he gets close to me I I'm like you
[1:37:59] know interestingly he's like a good guy
[1:38:01] but then when I want to open my heart
[1:38:02] doesn't work and I back off. And so the
[1:38:04] courtship goes from on off on off when
[1:38:07] when that happen there's something going
[1:38:10] on. You're fighting. You want to move
[1:38:12] but there's something like a leash
[1:38:15] pulling you back.
[1:38:18] I don't know that sister or that
[1:38:19] brother's weird. It's not weird.
[1:38:22] Something is going on here.
[1:38:25] I had to deal with those situation where
[1:38:27] you sit with the sisters. Okay, there's
[1:38:29] there's there's an issue there.
[1:38:32] And then you find yeah, my dad never got
[1:38:34] interested in my and and then usually
[1:38:36] it's related but but but you would you
[1:38:39] will find a trauma belief and oath. But
[1:38:42] how do we get rid of that?
[1:38:44] This is the great part because once you
[1:38:47] identify those things,
[1:38:50] that's where you need. So, uh, I got a
[1:38:52] scripture here I want to show you.
[1:38:56] The Bible says, "Thou art snared with
[1:38:59] the words of thy mouth." Thou art taken
[1:39:02] with the words of thy mouth. So, a note
[1:39:05] is something we pronounce and then we
[1:39:07] forget.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Death and life are in the power of the
[1:39:12] tongue.
[1:39:15] And we bind oursel when we make a note.
[1:39:18] I will never trust again. I will never
[1:39:22] do this. I will never open my heart. I
[1:39:26] will never trust anyone. All mens are
[1:39:29] bad. So I will never whatever it is.
[1:39:34] You bind yourself but then you forget
[1:39:36] you did it.
[1:39:38] So what we do when when we counsel
[1:39:40] people and I found all three it's
[1:39:43] amazing because when I found all three
[1:39:44] I'm smiling because I know freedom is
[1:39:46] just around the corner because it is so
[1:39:48] easy because and this is what psychology
[1:39:52] cannot do
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; because we invite Jesus in the office
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; and we invite the blood of Jesus because
[1:39:58] what's amazing is that the blood of
[1:40:00] Jesus this chloride can dissolve a note
[1:40:02] that you did.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; It can and it works and it works. You
[1:40:06] can be set free from words you said,
[1:40:09] "I'll never, never, never." Whatever you
[1:40:11] said, you're not bound with it. If you
[1:40:13] bring it to the cross and you dip that
[1:40:15] oath in the blood of Jesus, it'll be
[1:40:16] dissolved.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; It'll be gone. You don't have to respect
[1:40:19] it anymore. And you'll have the freedom
[1:40:21] to move. All right? But how do we do
[1:40:23] this?
[1:40:25] How do we do this? We
[1:40:28] have to confess with our mouth. So
[1:40:31] salvation
[1:40:32] is that if thou shalt confess with thy
[1:40:35] mouth we are so we we're such a in
[1:40:39] intellectual people how do you call it
[1:40:41] where we brain we we say in French
[1:40:43] celebr is that we are we are mental
[1:40:47] we're mental I thought about you know
[1:40:49] I've been thinking and I thought I
[1:40:52] thought I know you're going to a trial
[1:40:53] so I thought about you well you should
[1:40:55] have called
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; you should have spoke the word not
[1:40:58] thinking what what you know well I was
[1:41:00] in God's mind before the father. We we
[1:41:02] like the mind thing and but we we don't
[1:41:04] but the Bible is clear. Thou shalt
[1:41:06] confess with thy mouth because spoken
[1:41:09] word is powerful. You thou shalt confess
[1:41:12] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shall
[1:41:14] believe in thine heart. So it's inside.
[1:41:16] It's out there out in the mouth has
[1:41:18] raised him from the dead. Thou shalt be
[1:41:19] saved. For with the heart men believe it
[1:41:22] unto righteousness and with the mouth
[1:41:25] confession is made unto salvation. So
[1:41:27] that same principle we apply to undo an
[1:41:30] oath. The prayer is so simple
[1:41:34] is Lord Jesus
[1:41:37] and you talk with your mouth.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; You take a moment. You shut the door. I
[1:41:42] don't have I tell the people I don't
[1:41:44] have to be there. It's not a confession
[1:41:45] to a priest. The only reason why I'm
[1:41:47] here it's because you're stuck.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; I'm a towing. Pastors also do a towing
[1:41:52] job. That's the only reason why I'm
[1:41:55] there. It's not because you confess to a
[1:41:56] priest. You came to me because you're
[1:41:58] stuck.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to help you because a
[1:42:00] pastor is a guide. I'm going to guide
[1:42:02] you out of this. And so sometime the
[1:42:05] trauma is so heavy that they cannot even
[1:42:08] pronounce the words. I says, "Do you
[1:42:11] think you can make this prayer on your
[1:42:12] own, brother Steve?" No. says, "Okay, if
[1:42:16] you can't, I'll lead I'll lead you to
[1:42:18] I'll lead you in a prayer and I'll make
[1:42:20] you confess things and say things that
[1:42:22] you don't feel the strength to say."
[1:42:26] So, close your eyes and repeat after me.
[1:42:29] Then then because I ask all the
[1:42:31] question, what did you went through and
[1:42:33] all this and and when it's it's
[1:42:34] something sexual abuse with a woman, I'm
[1:42:36] like, you don't have to tell your story
[1:42:38] to a man because you don't have to. You
[1:42:41] can talk to my wife. I don't need the
[1:42:43] details. All I need to know is how you
[1:42:45] felt and how you perceived that. That's
[1:42:47] all I need to know. And what did you
[1:42:49] believe after that? And what promise did
[1:42:52] you make to yourself? That's all I need.
[1:42:54] With that, I can lead you to Jesus in
[1:42:57] freedom.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Sometimes they can talk to my wife in
[1:43:00] private to go to details if they need
[1:43:02] to. Then I just need a report on what
[1:43:05] what did it cause you? How did you feel?
[1:43:08] What I felt dirty? That's all I need to
[1:43:11] know.
[1:43:12] We can bring that feeling to Jesus
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; because he's he feels for in our
[1:43:18] infirmities.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; He has the feeling. He feels for us.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; And so then the prayer is something
[1:43:27] similar. So I took notes of how they
[1:43:29] felt when it happened. And so Lord, it's
[1:43:32] a simple prayer. Lord Jesus, when I was
[1:43:35] that age, I was in that school and this
[1:43:39] happened to me. And at that moment when
[1:43:42] that happened to me, I felt in such and
[1:43:44] such a way and inside of me and then I
[1:43:46] use the word they use
[1:43:49] whatever they use the term my heart
[1:43:51] collapsed or I felt in danger. Whatever
[1:43:53] they use I use their own words
[1:43:57] and then Lord it broke my heart. It
[1:44:01] brought it into peace. I it got
[1:44:02] shattered. whatever they say it in their
[1:44:05] own words.
[1:44:07] But Lord Jesus, you you promise that you
[1:44:09] would heal the wounded spirit. You
[1:44:11] promise that you would heal the
[1:44:13] brokenhearted. I come to you with this
[1:44:15] broken heart. Sometime we want to
[1:44:16] present oursel to Jesus as a whole. I
[1:44:19] Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:21] We're all shattered, but we pro we come
[1:44:23] to Jesus like we're all good.
[1:44:26] We're not used to present oursel to
[1:44:28] Jesus in the way we are.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; That's also something we need to learn.
[1:44:32] You're broken. go to Jesus broken
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; he likes that actually that's what he
[1:44:37] wants
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; and then and Lord because of that I
[1:44:44] started to believe that
[1:44:47] I don't know all pastors and angels
[1:44:49] people whatever and I realized today
[1:44:51] that that belief is not true but it was
[1:44:54] caused by that he hurt I give you that
[1:44:56] belief
[1:44:58] but then Lord also I made a promise to
[1:45:01] self. And when you pray like that, most
[1:45:04] of the time it's not an easy prayer,
[1:45:07] there's silence. There's sobbing because
[1:45:09] it's it's a real deal. We're not make up
[1:45:11] stuff like we try to pretend we have a
[1:45:13] pain. We're talking about real issues of
[1:45:15] life.
[1:45:16] Stuff that I forgot. Stuff that they
[1:45:18] never Many people told me, "Brother
[1:45:20] Steve, what I'm going to tell you,
[1:45:21] nobody knows. My parents, nobody. You're
[1:45:23] the first one." I says, "You don't have
[1:45:24] to tell me. Like, I'm not a Catholic
[1:45:26] priest, but if it helps you, I'm with
[1:45:30] you. I'm listening if it helps you
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; because then I can lead you so you can
[1:45:35] because some people a lot of people it's
[1:45:36] amazing but they cannot tell those
[1:45:39] things to Jesus with their mouth. They
[1:45:42] they they can't they don't even find the
[1:45:44] strength to pronounce those things
[1:45:46] because it was so hard
[1:45:50] and then said Lord I made a promise to
[1:45:51] myself that I would never and I realize
[1:45:54] I'm bound. I live in a prison based on
[1:45:57] my own words, my own oath and and I and
[1:46:00] I did that Lord in in in ignorance. But
[1:46:03] today I come and I I dissolve this in
[1:46:06] your blood. Can you come Lord and erase
[1:46:07] that oath? Change the belief and restore
[1:46:10] me. Restore me what I was before that
[1:46:12] Satan came and hit me. Lord, I pray in
[1:46:14] Jesus name.
[1:46:16] This is how we pray. And then God can
[1:46:20] bring you into freedom.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; And it works. It works because it
[1:46:26] involves the blood of Jesus.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; And it works because it it it involves
[1:46:30] the law of confessing of your mouth.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Many time we go to difficult times and
[1:46:36] we pray in our mind.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Lord help me. This has been difficult.
[1:46:40] But we think about it. There's not a lot
[1:46:42] of power in a thought if it's not
[1:46:44] expressed. Imagine
[1:46:46] if if imagine if God thought about
[1:46:49] Genesis 1. God thought about let it be
[1:46:51] light but light was not
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; because he thought about it but he
[1:46:55] forgot to say it.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; We made it according to the image of
[1:47:01] God. So it's the same thing.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; So
[1:47:09] this is it.
[1:47:12] trauma new belief
[1:47:15] oath.
[1:47:17] I hope it's helping.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Hope it's helping.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; But it was it was it was life-changing
[1:47:22] even for me because I used to get stuck
[1:47:25] with those things not knowing what to
[1:47:28] do. Then when I realized I could come to
[1:47:30] Jesus and pray this way. So it's it's we
[1:47:34] need to be taught how to pray to resolve
[1:47:37] those issues. Jesus says come to me he
[1:47:40] that are heavy burden the scriptures we
[1:47:42] all know by heart but we don't know how
[1:47:44] to do it so we get stuck with our
[1:47:47] burdens and we cope and we try to make
[1:47:50] it true
[1:47:52] all right it's already late I've been an
[1:47:55] hour 17 minutes so we can we can stop
[1:47:57] here for tonight I don't know brother
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; keep going
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; keep going
[1:48:03] you've aspirated so okay I'll try to go
[1:48:06] quickly for Becky's story because I said
[1:48:07] it was a two-part you're really pulling.
[1:48:09] So we we linger and linger and linger
[1:48:12] and so we'll go to Becky. So we're
[1:48:16] changing the picture totally
[1:48:20] even though it's in the same theme.
[1:48:22] Okay. So how to resolve a crisis at
[1:48:25] home.
[1:48:31] So resolving a crisis at home.
[1:48:34] We're going to read the quote together.
[1:48:35] And what I'm going to do to save time is
[1:48:37] I'm going to give the cue the the the
[1:48:39] clues as we go. It's usually I read the
[1:48:41] whole story and then we go line by line.
[1:48:43] But we have to try to save some time
[1:48:45] here. So the prophet says, "I just went
[1:48:48] through an experience with my Rebecca."
[1:48:50] See, just committed to God when she got
[1:48:53] to be a little teeny and she was going
[1:48:55] with some girl when we first went out
[1:48:57] going run over to some girl's house
[1:48:59] taking music lesson. I come by one day
[1:49:02] and here this girl was sitting there at
[1:49:04] the piano playing rock and roll. Well,
[1:49:06] that was just enough for me. So, I told
[1:49:08] her to stay away from over o from over
[1:49:10] there and then she said, "Well, it's the
[1:49:12] only place I go to take music." You know
[1:49:15] how teenies get, you know. And I said,
[1:49:17] "Every kid has to go through that
[1:49:19] practically. Everyone goes through that
[1:49:21] age. You did. I did. First key." And we
[1:49:25] got to think their thoughts. So we're
[1:49:28] going to give all the keys as we go
[1:49:30] instead of all at usually I do at the
[1:49:32] end and we do it a full session with it.
[1:49:34] Even sometime what I do I did I think
[1:49:36] last the other year at the brother
[1:49:38] Eugene's family camp we read the quote
[1:49:40] and then I told the people what did you
[1:49:42] find in this quote and so it was fun. I
[1:49:44] was writing on the board and it was
[1:49:45] really a a good time but we're going to
[1:49:47] do it different tonight for to save some
[1:49:49] time. So the first key the prophet says
[1:49:52] we have to think their thoughts. So as I
[1:49:54] said most mistake we do us as adult as
[1:49:57] an adults. So you have a 10-year-old,
[1:49:59] you're a 30-year-old, you think like a
[1:50:01] 30-y old, you think as an adult, but you
[1:50:03] forgot that you were 10 once. And how do
[1:50:06] they think? How do they perceive what's
[1:50:07] going on and we try to put an adult or
[1:50:10] maturity on them? They they don't have
[1:50:13] it. So to to we have to stop and to go
[1:50:18] at at at their level. So then a few days
[1:50:21] after that, her mother got her after her
[1:50:23] for something and she sassed her. Now
[1:50:25] that's not Rebecca at all. She took off
[1:50:27] and slammed the door almost and knocked
[1:50:29] the things off the wall and went to
[1:50:31] school. So that's a rebellious spirit.
[1:50:34] So now you got a rebellious spirit on
[1:50:36] your daughter. Now if you remember
[1:50:38] diagrams, rebellious spirit is a
[1:50:40] spiritual issue. So when when you see
[1:50:43] that kind of behavior, right away if
[1:50:44] you're Christian, you're going, "Well, I
[1:50:45] discern my daughter has a re rebellious
[1:50:47] spirit." Well, good for you. You got
[1:50:49] discernment. But it's just the beginning
[1:50:51] of it. Why is she slamming door? Why is
[1:50:55] she boiling over? That's the next
[1:50:57] question which the prophet's going to
[1:51:00] solve, by the way.
[1:51:02] So the the mistake we do when people
[1:51:05] when our kids have bad behavior is we
[1:51:08] focus on the bad behavior instead of
[1:51:10] listening. We're like stop slamming
[1:51:13] door. We don't accept that this in his
[1:51:15] in this house. If you want to slam the
[1:51:17] door, you'll find another place to stay.
[1:51:19] Now we felt we feel good about oursel
[1:51:21] because I won't tolerate that spirit in
[1:51:23] my house. But what you did, you didn't
[1:51:26] solve anything. You probably sealed you
[1:51:30] probably locked their heart. When you do
[1:51:33] that, you lock them with that spirit
[1:51:36] because you dissoci in wanting to
[1:51:39] dissociate with from that rebellious
[1:51:41] spirit which your kid is associated to.
[1:51:44] you get rid of your kids at the same
[1:51:46] time
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; and you lose communion.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; So you got to bypass the rebellious
[1:51:52] spirit for a season to try to reach
[1:51:55] their heart like Jesus did with Zakius.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; So she's slamming door. So the prophecy
[1:52:02] says, "I ought to have seemingly just
[1:52:04] taken my belt off and followed her in
[1:52:07] the yard and brought her back with ws
[1:52:09] around her." Well, it would have not fix
[1:52:11] anything. It would have locked Becky
[1:52:15] with that rebellious spirit and he would
[1:52:17] have lose contact with her for many
[1:52:20] years.
[1:52:23] So instead of running after her and
[1:52:26] beating her with a belt, which is not a
[1:52:29] good idea, especially at 18.
[1:52:33] Um, oh, and by the way, sometime I'm
[1:52:36] asked a qu like I've I've dealt with
[1:52:38] this spanking thing
[1:52:41] and I will give you just a quick example
[1:52:43] because it's not a difficult issue like
[1:52:46] sometime parents was like should we
[1:52:47] spank, should we not? And the question
[1:52:50] is not should we or should we not. And I
[1:52:53] will use the image of a cop.
[1:52:56] A police officer has different tools.
[1:53:00] And his training is how
[1:53:03] he needs to use those tool. If he does
[1:53:05] an intervention for someone, he's going
[1:53:08] to training to learn escalation
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; in your intervention. So if if the cops
[1:53:15] stop you for speeding and I'll take the
[1:53:19] spanking as the ultimate weapon. So
[1:53:23] spanking is when you pull your gun and
[1:53:25] you shoot the person because I don't
[1:53:27] know what you can do worse than spanking
[1:53:32] after that you you won't beat him bring
[1:53:35] blood you you you you don't do more than
[1:53:37] that. Right. But if a cop pull you on
[1:53:41] the side of the road, what's the first
[1:53:44] weapon he use against you to show you
[1:53:46] that what you're doing is wrong? First
[1:53:49] of all, he will talk to you,
[1:53:52] sir. Do you know why I'm pulling you
[1:53:53] over? Like, he doesn't come with his
[1:53:54] gun, you know? Get out of your car.
[1:53:58] Like, what are you going to think? Like,
[1:53:59] he's like, man, are you crazy?
[1:54:02] Some parents we res we we go for the gun
[1:54:05] all the time
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; and we don't even ask question.
[1:54:10] We shoot the car.
[1:54:12] Oh, sorry. My radar was off.
[1:54:16] Have a nice day.
[1:54:19] Okay.
[1:54:21] So, first of all, he's going to talk to
[1:54:23] you. Sometimes just the flash
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; and the pulling over sometime before
[1:54:30] that. The other day I was with a
[1:54:32] brother, a minister, and we driving on
[1:54:33] the road. We're going visiting a church
[1:54:35] and I didn't realize I was speeding.
[1:54:38] Maybe maybe I don't know, maybe 25 or
[1:54:40] whatever. And I and I and I cross a cop
[1:54:43] and and I'm like, "Oh no." And all he
[1:54:46] did was flick his light, turned it off,
[1:54:49] and he never stopped. And just that my
[1:54:52] heart's like who ba. He didn't do much,
[1:54:56] but because he has authority, and this
[1:54:58] is something I did not understand when I
[1:55:01] was at a young age, I was pulling the
[1:55:03] gun on my kids all the time. I was I
[1:55:06] didn't realize because I never had a
[1:55:08] father. So, I didn't know that me as a
[1:55:10] father, just the fact that I look at my
[1:55:13] children, I'm disappointed in their
[1:55:15] behavior was already huge for them.
[1:55:18] Like, daddy's not proud of me. And that
[1:55:20] had a I didn't know the impact. I didn't
[1:55:22] even know the touching was important.
[1:55:24] And so my wife sometimes like, "Steve,
[1:55:26] you're too much. You're too much." So my
[1:55:29] kids were afraid of me. We had good
[1:55:31] moments, but when they did something
[1:55:32] bad, they never knew what was coming
[1:55:35] because I didn't learn the escalation.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Imagine when you're speeding and and the
[1:55:41] cops shoots at your car.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Imagine the level of fear.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; So that that time I just got the light
[1:55:49] signal. It's like, "Oh, praise the
[1:55:52] Lord." But sometimes you get the like
[1:55:55] signal. He turns around, pull you over,
[1:55:58] draw your window. Do you know why I'm
[1:55:59] pulling you over? Well, I think I maybe
[1:56:01] I was going too fast. Yes, sir. You were
[1:56:03] too fast. But you know what? I'm going
[1:56:04] to give you a pass today. Have a nice
[1:56:06] day.
[1:56:08] Level number two. Right. And just that
[1:56:10] is like, "Oh, praise the Lord. Such a
[1:56:12] merciful God." And it's and then you
[1:56:15] take the road again and and you know
[1:56:17] what? You learn something. He had he
[1:56:19] didn't have to shoot the car. He didn't
[1:56:21] have to put you in jail. Just that was
[1:56:23] just enough.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; But then his other weapon is that he
[1:56:27] flicks the light, turn, pull you over,
[1:56:29] talk to you, and then he takes his pen.
[1:56:33] That's another weapon.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; $300.
[1:56:39] Have a nice day, sir. All nice. All
[1:56:42] good.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; But you're learning
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; now. If if he does that and you you get
[1:56:49] close to the car and you just slam the
[1:56:52] the gas and and then now it's a car
[1:56:55] chase.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; When they stop your car, he's coming at
[1:57:00] you with a gun.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; And if you don't get out of the car and
[1:57:05] you try to draw something on the floor
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; or you you you you press the gas to hit
[1:57:10] his car, now he's shooting at you. Yeah.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; So, it's not should we spank, should we
[1:57:16] not spank. It's that we don't us
[1:57:19] parents, a lot of parents like, well,
[1:57:21] the Bible says you don't spare the rod.
[1:57:23] It's like, yeah, I get it. I get it.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; But we need to learn escalation. And
[1:57:28] every kids is different.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; I would say that I've I've I've hurt my
[1:57:33] son. My son was the oldest. I have
[1:57:35] damaged this boy when he was really a
[1:57:38] young age. I've traumatized him
[1:57:41] because I didn't realize because I was
[1:57:43] not sensitive and because I was a in my
[1:57:45] fatherhood I was locked because
[1:57:46] obviously I was locked because I didn't
[1:57:48] have a father so I needed to healing in
[1:57:51] the fatherhood before I could be a
[1:57:53] father but I didn't know that
[1:57:57] William was a sensitive
[1:58:01] sensitive just the fact that I would
[1:58:03] disagree with his behavior was way was
[1:58:06] enough he didn't need more than that but
[1:58:08] I didn't know that
[1:58:11] when kids are small they're really
[1:58:14] sensitive.
[1:58:16] So, and then if they don't get it, we
[1:58:18] escalate slowly.
[1:58:20] Obviously, we escalate because we want
[1:58:22] to resolve these things. But my wife was
[1:58:25] so much better than me because I was
[1:58:28] focusing so much on the behavior.
[1:58:32] And my wife, I would get frustrated
[1:58:33] because I would escalate and escalate
[1:58:36] and I would yell and and I would and
[1:58:38] then then the kids like he's in panic
[1:58:41] and I'm I said I always said I would I
[1:58:43] would I would be really bad as a hostage
[1:58:46] negotiator
[1:58:48] because because they would they would
[1:58:51] shoot the hostage everyone because I
[1:58:53] don't negotiate and I thought that was a
[1:58:55] quality then called me to be a pastor
[1:58:58] that's funny.
[1:59:00] So I I needed to learn a lot because
[1:59:03] pastoring is negotiating. Let's reason
[1:59:05] together. The Bible says,
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; but I was not negoti and Esther was so
[1:59:11] good. She would she would come in and
[1:59:13] and and I was watching and it would
[1:59:15] frustrates me. It's like she would be
[1:59:18] able to resolve things while when I was
[1:59:21] coming I was making a big it was a small
[1:59:23] thing. The kid just did a little thing
[1:59:27] and I was coming with my big shoes, you
[1:59:29] know. No, that's not right. Now you need
[1:59:31] to apologize to your sister.
[1:59:34] Now it's like and then he looks at you.
[1:59:36] He locks and then he doesn't say
[1:59:38] anything. I said apologize. You don't
[1:59:41] listen to me. And then it's like it's a
[1:59:44] small thing. But now the whole house is
[1:59:47] upside down. Now everybody's crying. I
[1:59:50] exaggerate. you know, it was maybe not
[1:59:52] that bad, but it's just to give you an
[1:59:54] example. When we don't know how to
[1:59:56] approach these things, we make it so
[1:59:58] worse. So, we need to learn, we need to
[2:00:02] love first, but we need to learn how we
[2:00:05] escalate if we need to escalate. So, the
[2:00:08] prophet is first reaction is, I'm going
[2:00:10] to fix this with my belt. And he says,
[2:00:13] okay, now let's not do that. I'm not
[2:00:16] pulling the gun on her because she
[2:00:17] slammed the door. You get the point?
[2:00:19] Yeah.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Wait a minute." It's a good
[2:00:23] and and we have to wait a minute
[2:00:25] sometime
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; if we feel that's why we don't want to
[2:00:29] escalate or take an action in anger
[2:00:32] because most of the time we're angry and
[2:00:34] disappointed and because of those
[2:00:36] feelings it it it it it it messes up our
[2:00:39] judgment.
[2:00:43] So he says, "Wait a minute.
[2:00:47] I thought I got to think 18 year old
[2:00:51] thoughts.
[2:00:53] That's a key. I got to think what Steve,
[2:00:56] what did you think at 18? Well, parents
[2:00:59] are boring. Okay. Well, then that's what
[2:01:01] they think.
[2:01:03] So, let's accept that. What can you do
[2:01:06] now?
[2:01:08] So, mother, I know she started crying.
[2:01:10] Meta and I know you done all you can. I
[2:01:12] done all I can. Now, it's out of our
[2:01:14] hands.
[2:01:16] we have to take the next step. So now
[2:01:19] they acknowledge she's 18, she's
[2:01:22] slamming doors, we cannot fix this with
[2:01:24] spanking.
[2:01:28] We have to take the next step. So their
[2:01:31] assessment is changing. This is this is
[2:01:34] amazing. They re-evaluate their approach
[2:01:37] and the next step is she's 18. What can
[2:01:40] we do? She's locked now in that.
[2:01:45] She says, 'Well, look honey on me now.
[2:01:46] You've got to listen to me. It's hard
[2:01:48] for you to do this. I'm your husband.
[2:01:50] But people drive across the nation and
[2:01:52] around just for a few words of advice.
[2:01:54] Like all the world comes to me from an
[2:01:55] advice, but my wife's not listening to
[2:01:57] me.
[2:02:01] I talked to her the other day and she
[2:02:03] just walked away from me. Now, Becky
[2:02:05] never did that to me. So, even she
[2:02:07] walked away from Brother Brandham. And
[2:02:09] when her mother said something about it,
[2:02:11] she slammed the door and said, "You
[2:02:12] expect me to sit here and be a
[2:02:14] wallflower on my life?" So while she
[2:02:18] slammed the door, she's giving crucial
[2:02:20] information.
[2:02:22] She's actually saying, "What is the
[2:02:24] problem?" And the problem is said, "I'm
[2:02:27] stuck here.
[2:02:29] You expect me to be a wall flower all my
[2:02:34] life."
[2:02:37] So
[2:02:38] when there's a crisis at home, it can be
[2:02:40] your wife, it can be the husband, it can
[2:02:42] be your kids. When there's a crisis,
[2:02:45] a lot of time they're giving you the
[2:02:47] key. They're giving you what is the
[2:02:49] problem. But you know what parents do?
[2:02:51] Don't talk to your parents like that.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; And we we go on behavior and you're
[2:02:58] being disrespectful instead of listening
[2:03:01] to what they say.
[2:03:04] And so what we should say is that I
[2:03:07] don't really like the tone, but I get
[2:03:09] your point. I need we need to sit down
[2:03:12] calmly. So maybe let's let's cool off
[2:03:15] this. Let's not escalate more than is
[2:03:17] this right now. Let's let's talk
[2:03:19] tonight. Let's cool off. Go cool. I'll
[2:03:23] go cool.
[2:03:24] And tonight I I'll take it from what
[2:03:26] just because I found it interesting that
[2:03:29] you're saying that you feel like you
[2:03:30] have to be a wallflower all your life.
[2:03:32] So, we'll talk about that because I hear
[2:03:34] you and I care. If you say this, it's
[2:03:37] because you feel this way. And it's hard
[2:03:39] for sometime because again, in my mind,
[2:03:41] as an adult, I might think that's not
[2:03:43] what I'm causing.
[2:03:44] But if my kid is saying that, I'll go on
[2:03:47] you for a little while and see that
[2:03:49] reasoning where it comes from
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; and we'll have a conversation on your
[2:03:53] ground, not mine. I'll go on your ground
[2:03:55] and try to figure out where did you get
[2:03:57] this?
[2:03:59] No, we like you're disrespectful and
[2:04:01] that's not true. Well, that's your
[2:04:04] world. It's that maybe is and we do that
[2:04:07] with our wife or we do that with our
[2:04:08] husband.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Failure of communication is when two
[2:04:14] person try to be understood at the same
[2:04:16] time.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Do you know to have meaningful
[2:04:19] conversation and to be understood one
[2:04:21] needs to be on listen mode,
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; caring mode,
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; understanding mode while one expresses
[2:04:27] each other. Is it? But what we do when
[2:04:29] we're fighting is while the other people
[2:04:31] is talking, we're preparing our answer.
[2:04:35] Failure of communication
[2:04:38] doesn't work.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; So we have to agree. Okay, I'm going to
[2:04:42] listen to you sincerely. Go at it. Well,
[2:04:46] that's not true.
[2:04:48] No, you didn't listen. Let me finish the
[2:04:52] whole thing. And sometime for us it
[2:04:53] doesn't make sense because a man's
[2:04:55] world, woman's world is different. We
[2:04:57] don't perceive things the same way. We
[2:04:59] don't feel the same way. And then we got
[2:05:02] to meet somewhere in the middle. Same
[2:05:03] thing for the children. So failure
[2:05:05] communication is when we are hurting and
[2:05:08] the other one is hurting. And both need
[2:05:10] to be comforted at the same time and to
[2:05:12] be understood at the same time and to be
[2:05:13] cared for at the same time.
[2:05:16] And nobody understand, nobody care and
[2:05:19] nobody heal.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; And we make the ditch deeper, wider. And
[2:05:25] we fail the communication. We fail
[2:05:26] communication. We fail communication
[2:05:28] until we end up in a ditch.
[2:05:31] So when there's a crisis, most of the
[2:05:35] time you will get crucial information.
[2:05:38] You need to listen.
[2:05:41] Then the prophet goes back when she was
[2:05:43] two years old. Becky was two years old.
[2:05:45] Andy then he says when she was two years
[2:05:47] old she uh I remember the first two
[2:05:49] years of her life she cried. We go in
[2:05:51] restaurant and eat and walk on her on
[2:05:53] the street while Mida eat and then I
[2:05:54] she'd walk while I eat. Just cried and
[2:05:56] cry. And one day up here in Canada cried
[2:05:58] all night and I couldn't rest and
[2:05:59] everything. We be standing there and
[2:06:01] something said to me, "It's the devil
[2:06:03] getting at your ministry." I said, "Hand
[2:06:05] me that baby." I said, "Satan, in the
[2:06:07] name of Jesus Christ, you take your
[2:06:08] hands off of her." She stopped right
[2:06:10] then and never cried no more. She's the
[2:06:13] quietest kid I got. From that very hour,
[2:06:15] it was gone. You have to get that. You
[2:06:17] have to get You have to have that in you
[2:06:19] though before you can do it. But mid
[2:06:21] about an hour I said may I take your
[2:06:22] hands off. So what he's saying is that
[2:06:24] at two years old a demon was attacking a
[2:06:28] two-year-old baby without free will. And
[2:06:31] so the prophet on dirty inspiration of
[2:06:33] God could cast that devil that torment
[2:06:35] the baby like this.
[2:06:38] But at 18 year old, he couldn't do it
[2:06:42] because that spirit is there because
[2:06:45] Becky allowed it.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; And this is something we misunderstand.
[2:06:51] We try that's what brother Fandler
[2:06:54] tried. He tried to cast the unbelief
[2:06:56] spirit out of his wife because she
[2:06:57] didn't believe the message. And prophet
[2:06:59] says this is not how we do it. Why do
[2:07:01] you cast spirit off people on the prayer
[2:07:04] line? Because they want that. if they
[2:07:07] want that because the prophet says if
[2:07:08] they worship that spirit there's nothing
[2:07:10] you can do.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; So when somebody is locked with an evil
[2:07:16] spirit caused by a wound or something,
[2:07:18] you got to work your way to with
[2:07:20] understanding and caring and and and and
[2:07:22] conversation and reasoning and try to
[2:07:25] win the person's will so they don't want
[2:07:28] that spirit anymore.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; It's tough. But we want shortcut. We
[2:07:33] like, you know, you know, I cast that
[2:07:35] spirit off of you. It's like,
[2:07:39] forget it. And we make things worse and
[2:07:41] we think we're spiritual.
[2:07:45] Well, apply the word. She's not
[2:07:46] listening.
[2:07:49] So, he's giving the example between two
[2:07:51] years old and 18 years old. It's not the
[2:07:53] same approach.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; You got the point.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Important. So, there's so many keys in
[2:07:58] that quote.
[2:08:00] So he says, "May I take your hands off
[2:08:02] me?"
[2:08:05] Oh, sorry. I didn't move the quote.
[2:08:06] Sorry.
[2:08:09] So Satan, so two years old because I
[2:08:12] move here and don't move there. I should
[2:08:13] just close my iPad. So
[2:08:16] So it says, "Uh, may I take your hands
[2:08:18] off me? That's my kid." Well, he said,
[2:08:20] "Is it mine, too?" So both of them tried
[2:08:22] to understand each other
[2:08:24] and well, it's my kid. Well, it's my
[2:08:26] kid.
[2:08:28] pretty standard conversation between a
[2:08:31] couple
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; and it's a blessing that he would open
[2:08:35] his house like that
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; right
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; like I open mine and I shared to you
[2:08:41] private information about my family but
[2:08:44] it's it's it's just to show that these
[2:08:47] things happens in in life and and and
[2:08:50] there's keys to resolve those things
[2:08:55] all right I said if she was dying this
[2:08:56] morning you have to commit her to God
[2:08:58] for her eternal destination. Why can't
[2:09:00] we commit her to God now for a hurt
[2:09:02] leader journey? Well, she said, "Well,
[2:09:04] that's my kid." Well, it's mine, too.
[2:09:05] So, they kind of So, how couple when we
[2:09:08] talk, we talk in circle. We're not going
[2:09:09] anywhere
[2:09:11] now. Can you take your me not say
[2:09:13] nothing to her?
[2:09:16] I said, I never said that, but quit
[2:09:18] scolding her. Just advise her.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Well, here you go again. Well, and then
[2:09:24] it becomes such a negative atmosphere in
[2:09:26] the house. Every time we talk to them,
[2:09:27] it's about what they're doing wrong.
[2:09:29] Guess guess why they want to be out of
[2:09:31] there.
[2:09:33] Then he gives another key. She needs a
[2:09:36] buddy.
[2:09:39] And you're the one, the parents.
[2:09:42] You're the one to be her buddy. You and
[2:09:45] I, we're her parents. And these kids
[2:09:50] today needs a buddy. If they had a
[2:09:53] mother and a father would stay home and
[2:09:55] take care of them. Now we go to the care
[2:09:57] again
[2:09:58] instead of out there on Facebook or
[2:10:00] running barroom running around all night
[2:10:02] and things like that. It wouldn't have
[2:10:05] juvenile delinquency,
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; They got away from the Bible. They all
[2:10:09] went to church and men bonkong games and
[2:10:11] things like that. You're trying to
[2:10:13] polish up like Satan's ground up
[2:10:14] Hollywood. You could never bring
[2:10:15] Hollywood into the church. You've got I
[2:10:18] mean bring the church into Hollywood.
[2:10:19] You've got to bring Hollywood to your
[2:10:20] grounds, not go on their grounds. let
[2:10:23] them cover over for uh uh over there.
[2:10:26] We've got something they know nothing
[2:10:27] about. So we so we there got down on our
[2:10:30] knees and committed to God. I say I know
[2:10:32] she's 18 years old will be in a few days
[2:10:35] and she and I and a girl that age will
[2:10:38] think about boyfriend and we've kept her
[2:10:43] in. So when she says, "I don't want to
[2:10:46] be a wild flower in my all my life." The
[2:10:49] prophet admit, "I never wanted to see
[2:10:51] her get married."
[2:10:55] So she was right. She felt trapped and
[2:10:58] she was trapped.
[2:11:01] I want to put her in the office here to
[2:11:03] do the work. I want to see her filled
[2:11:06] with the spirit and live like that. So
[2:11:08] the prophet's plan for his daughter was
[2:11:11] she's going to be filled with the Holy
[2:11:12] Ghost. She's going to be my secretary
[2:11:15] and she'll never get married.
[2:11:19] That's what he says.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; That sounds like a great plan, but Becky
[2:11:24] was not buying it.
[2:11:28] So, the pressure and and I'm guess the
[2:11:29] prophet, you know, you know how dad we
[2:11:31] are. Now, I'm making this up, but that
[2:11:33] would be my style. You know, honey,
[2:11:35] you'll never get married. You got to
[2:11:36] work with daddy. You know that,
[2:11:37] sweetheart.
[2:11:40] She's like, "Yeah, I know that."
[2:11:46] But that was his desire.
[2:11:48] And every parents has desire for their
[2:11:50] kids.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; That's normal.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; But we don't we don't always have it
[2:11:54] right.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; So when she slams the door and says,
[2:12:01] "You expect me to be a wall flower all
[2:12:04] my life?" She is right.
[2:12:08] But he had to come to a point where she
[2:12:11] slams door and she becomes rebellious
[2:12:13] then to get some attention about this is
[2:12:16] a problem.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; I choke here.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; You get it?
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; So parents sometimes does this mistake.
[2:12:25] You're going to study where I tell you
[2:12:26] to study. You're going to do that kind
[2:12:28] of career and you're going to and all
[2:12:30] the parents have all laid it out for
[2:12:32] their kids.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; It doesn't always work.
[2:12:38] Because when we do that, we break a rule
[2:12:42] which is called free moral agency.
[2:12:44] That's one of the first law.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; God made choices for us, but he waited
[2:12:52] for us to see it. But God is God, so he
[2:12:55] knew all things. We don't know all
[2:12:57] things. As much as I think I'm
[2:12:59] spiritual,
[2:13:01] I had to walk with my children to as
[2:13:03] they try to figure out what they're
[2:13:05] going to do in life and what they want.
[2:13:07] Unless I have a vision,
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; which I don't. And I don't think the
[2:13:11] prophet had a vision about her daughter.
[2:13:14] He had a desire
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; which is different. He had a desire for
[2:13:17] Billy Paul to take his place. Then it
[2:13:19] didn't work. He had a desire for brother
[2:13:20] Joseph to to carry the Bible to take his
[2:13:22] place. He had a desire for Rebecca.
[2:13:24] parents. I mean, brother Brandham was a
[2:13:27] human being like us also.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; He had desires for his kids. People
[2:13:32] turned those desires into almost thus
[2:13:34] said the Lord.
[2:13:36] May you be a prophet. That's what he
[2:13:38] said. May you be a prophet. That's what
[2:13:40] he told about brother Joseph. That was
[2:13:42] his desire.
[2:13:45] So
[2:13:48] he says, "Well, we all wanted that." She
[2:13:52] says, "Well, we can't do that." She just
[2:13:56] won't listen to it. That was not her
[2:13:59] calling. And it's funny because I'm
[2:14:01] touching on that and Brother George
[2:14:02] Smith is preaching on the other side of
[2:14:04] town right now.
[2:14:08] We had fellowship with him on Friday
[2:14:10] night. We had good time. I said, "Wait a
[2:14:12] minute. We've raised her all weekend.
[2:14:15] Now put her in the hands of God. Commit
[2:14:17] her." And I said, "Then when she does
[2:14:19] anything, says Becky, darling, mother,
[2:14:22] don't want you to do that, but I'm your
[2:14:24] pal.
[2:14:26] I'll stick by you."
[2:14:30] So that means whatever you do, I'm not
[2:14:32] going anywhere. I'll stick by you. And
[2:14:34] that's also another mistake when when
[2:14:35] when children start to do things that we
[2:14:37] don't like, we resent them.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; And and sometime it can escalate like,
[2:14:42] "Yeah, you want to have like you see
[2:14:44] this door? If you cross that door,
[2:14:46] you're not coming back. And then we make
[2:14:48] it we make it like we we say things out
[2:14:51] of anger. We go too far.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; We have to learn this is not how we
[2:14:55] approach those things.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; She says, "I'll stick by you.
[2:15:01] Let her know that you love her. She's
[2:15:05] going to get somebody to love her and it
[2:15:08] might be the wrong woman." Now in 1964
[2:15:12] be find a love with another woman meant
[2:15:15] something but in 2025 it means another
[2:15:18] level
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; if you get what I mean
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; and I'm talking about real things now
[2:15:23] that we have encountered
[2:15:25] so
[2:15:29] as we've seen this morning when the love
[2:15:31] of the parents are not present so they
[2:15:33] don't care they seek love somewhere else
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; this is exactly what he says let be the
[2:15:38] one who does the loving Because if the
[2:15:41] parents stop loving because the behavior
[2:15:43] behavior is not right because we use
[2:15:46] love as a manipul as a leverage.
[2:15:49] We do the silent treatment. We stop the
[2:15:52] fountain of love until they behave
[2:15:54] better and we teach them that love is
[2:15:56] conditional which is not God's love.
[2:15:59] God's love is unconditional.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; And we mix love with approval. And
[2:16:04] that's that's another mistake. We feel
[2:16:06] like if we show left to them, we approve
[2:16:08] their behavior, which is not what we're
[2:16:10] doing. It's like, I love you so dearly.
[2:16:12] You're my son. You'll always be my son.
[2:16:14] I don't like what you're doing, but I'll
[2:16:15] stick with you anyway because you're my
[2:16:16] son. We can love and disapprove at the
[2:16:20] same time. We can chew gum and walk at
[2:16:23] the same time. We should, right? We can
[2:16:26] multitask. I'm sure we can multitask.
[2:16:29] Praise the Lord. You be the woman does
[2:16:32] the loing. I said, 'Honey, that sound
[2:16:33] kind of crude, but people come
[2:16:35] everywhere and said on personal
[2:16:37] interviews and things. I said, I'm so
[2:16:38] common. We're common to one another
[2:16:40] because we're husband and wife, but
[2:16:42] we'll never let that happen. You
[2:16:44] remember this is the name of the Lord.
[2:16:45] So now he's going and telling her what
[2:16:48] what he's giving from advice right now
[2:16:50] came from God.
[2:16:53] So that approach is sealed also by a
[2:16:56] prophet.
[2:16:57] He's not just telling a testimony, but
[2:17:00] he says this is thus sayith the Lord.
[2:17:01] this is what we need to do. So this is
[2:17:04] serious.
[2:17:06] So she said, "All right." She knew
[2:17:08] better. If she says, "This is the name
[2:17:10] of the Lord." She says, "Okay, it's all
[2:17:11] right." We got down and committed to
[2:17:13] God. Said we'd take our hands off of it.
[2:17:16] That afternoon she come and she says,
[2:17:17] "Well, I guess you're still saying I
[2:17:18] ain't going over there." Meta said, "No,
[2:17:20] I never said nothing about it." I said,
[2:17:22] "You know, mother, don't want you to do
[2:17:24] that. So you don't approve."
[2:17:26] And that that's that's a
[2:17:28] misunderstanding. So modern day parents
[2:17:31] now they we they want to be so loving
[2:17:33] with their children. They think that
[2:17:34] love is to say yes to the kids all the
[2:17:36] time.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; No, we have to love in truth.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; But this modern generation, they want to
[2:17:43] spoil the kids so much and then they
[2:17:45] they tell Junior, "Yeah, it's okay. Oh,
[2:17:47] yeah. You go." Yeah. And tell and give
[2:17:49] them everything they want. And that and
[2:17:50] that that creates monsters.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; No, we got to love and truth. Like, no.
[2:17:56] Like, I love you, but I don't think it's
[2:17:58] good for you.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; But when they're old enough, like it's
[2:18:01] like it's your choice. You're 19.
[2:18:04] What? Like, lately had a conversation
[2:18:06] with one of my daughter and I like,
[2:18:08] "What would you do?" She's old enough.
[2:18:10] Like I could I could say, "I'm the
[2:18:12] father and and I decide, but she's 19."
[2:18:15] I says, "What will you do? What would
[2:18:17] you do?" I said, "You know what? On
[2:18:19] this, I will let you decide. Make the
[2:18:21] decision." And for me, it was a test to
[2:18:23] see what she's going to choose.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; I can see where she's at
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; on little things. Little things just to
[2:18:34] see how does she measure stuff? How does
[2:18:36] she judge?
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; What she's going to base it upon. And I
[2:18:40] just watch on little things.
[2:18:43] Right?
[2:18:46] We need to teach them at a certain age
[2:18:48] to start to let them making choices on
[2:18:51] small things and then they can learn. So
[2:18:54] later on later on they they so they can
[2:18:58] develop their own judgment. If we
[2:19:00] override their judgment called all the
[2:19:02] time all the time because we have most
[2:19:03] of the answers. So we can decide for
[2:19:06] them 247 until they're they're 20 if we
[2:19:09] want to. But we're not helping them
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; because they're not making their own
[2:19:13] judgment.
[2:19:16] So we need to train the child
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; not dictate
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; train. It's a training.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; So
[2:19:28] you know mother don't want you to do and
[2:19:29] and I you know it like to kill your
[2:19:32] daddy when he heard you up there playing
[2:19:33] that boogie woogie music ever what it
[2:19:35] was where that girl said now he didn't
[2:19:37] want you to do that and we don't want
[2:19:39] you to do that Becky but we just
[2:19:41] committed to the Lord and I want you to
[2:19:43] know we love you. Whatever you do,
[2:19:45] unconditional love. Whatever you do, you
[2:19:48] can make all the bad choices you want.
[2:19:50] We don't approve, but we love you.
[2:19:53] It's unfortunate, but some Christian
[2:19:55] father, they almost disone their
[2:19:57] children because they're not serving the
[2:19:59] Lord. And almost like, don't talk to
[2:20:00] you. Like, don't ever come back here
[2:20:02] unless you're a Christian.
[2:20:05] So bad. Now he's like, I thought I was
[2:20:08] in a cult. Now it got confirmed,
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:20:14] because you don't get out of a cult. You
[2:20:17] are ostracized. You are, you know, you
[2:20:21] are demolished. They demolish you when
[2:20:23] when you try to get out of church. But
[2:20:26] that's not who we are. And and and is it
[2:20:29] hard to see people walk away? It breaks
[2:20:31] our heart. But when people their heart
[2:20:33] is broken, sometimes they go too far in
[2:20:35] what they're saying. We should bring our
[2:20:37] griefs to the Lord instead of unloading
[2:20:39] all that grief on that person that's
[2:20:42] having a hard time or a bad time. So
[2:20:44] whatever you do, we still love you.
[2:20:47] It's tough. It's tough when our kids
[2:20:50] makes the wrong decision. It's tough,
[2:20:52] but God will give you grace. She
[2:20:55] hollered and said, "I'm going anyhow."
[2:20:57] Said, "All right,
[2:21:00] dear." So we went ahead said, "All
[2:21:02] right, I'll have supper ready when you
[2:21:04] get back." So she's can she can make a
[2:21:06] bad choice and return and have a meal.
[2:21:11] She never did go. Guess what? That's so
[2:21:14] that's another principle. When you
[2:21:17] restore freedom of will,
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; they don't have to to block and to push
[2:21:22] and to affirm because now since they're
[2:21:24] free,
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; since she was free, she didn't need to
[2:21:26] go anymore.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; So guess why she was going? She was
[2:21:30] going to try to claim her freedom she
[2:21:32] didn't have. But when her freedom was
[2:21:33] given, then she didn't have to go.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Is it amazing?
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Now, this one, this one seems quite
[2:21:41] easy. It doesn't always always go like
[2:21:44] that. Sometime it takes patience and
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; and time, but it's not something we try.
[2:21:50] It's something that we are.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; She never went since. See, not long
[2:21:56] after that, she met George. George in
[2:21:58] town.
[2:22:00] George is a Christian. And that settled
[2:22:03] it. Then why did George marrying George
[2:22:06] settled it? Because that was her problem
[2:22:08] to begin with. She wanted to get
[2:22:11] married. So guess what? When she's
[2:22:12] allowed to marry George, the problem is
[2:22:14] fixed.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; You got it?
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; So that's what we call a depth, a deep
[2:22:21] analysis of a quote, line by line. But
[2:22:25] you you you can go back and and and
[2:22:26] print. So you know sometimes that's one
[2:22:28] quote I give when when when when parents
[2:22:30] goes through difficult time with their
[2:22:32] teenager we have a discussion then as I
[2:22:34] apprent this I says study this study
[2:22:36] this because it is line by line almost
[2:22:39] like a protocol
[2:22:41] let it go give it to God and then we do
[2:22:45] that as parents but then the next day we
[2:22:46] take it back
[2:22:49] then we got to let it go again because
[2:22:50] it's not because you let it go yesterday
[2:22:52] in tears that three days later a lack of
[2:22:55] faith in it's like Peter he walked on
[2:22:56] water but he he but he he he went down
[2:22:59] also. So sometime we walk on water in a
[2:23:01] crisis and like we feel like oh god was
[2:23:03] there and I felt like yes and but then
[2:23:05] two three days later you see another
[2:23:07] symptom is like oh no no no they want to
[2:23:09] know it's not working this is not
[2:23:10] working. All right so may the lord bless
[2:23:13] you. I hope we we we we covered so much
[2:23:16] so much but I think it was it was a
[2:23:19] blessing to do it together. Amen. May
[2:23:21] the Lord bless you.
[2:23:29] Let's pray together
[2:23:32] because in all that without the Lord it
[2:23:33] doesn't work.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; Those principle without God doesn't
[2:23:37] work. Without prayer it doesn't work. We
[2:23:40] need the presence of God with us. We
[2:23:44] need Christ in us. Because those
[2:23:47] principles is not just something we do.
[2:23:50] It's something that Lord wants us to
[2:23:52] become. We need to become agape love. We
[2:23:56] need to become unconditional love.
[2:23:59] It's not something we learn. It's
[2:24:00] something we accept and it's just
[2:24:02] something we become. Lord Jesus, we've
[2:24:05] covered so much. This group of people
[2:24:08] has been so awesome. It has been it has
[2:24:10] been a great blessing to walk through
[2:24:12] these teaching with them.
[2:24:16] And Lord, there's I don't I don't know
[2:24:19] this church and I don't know the people,
[2:24:20] but I'm sure every one of them, nobody's
[2:24:23] immune. If Moses went through these
[2:24:25] things and the prophet and even myself,
[2:24:28] everybody goes through that.
[2:24:32] Well, we've found so much precious
[2:24:34] nuggets in your word this weekend.
[2:24:38] So much things that we can draw from.
[2:24:41] And I pray that you give grace to
[2:24:43] everyone.
[2:24:45] the grandfathers, the grandmothers, the
[2:24:47] parents, the couple, the marriage,
[2:24:49] [Music]
[2:24:51] the children, the teenagers, everyone,
[2:24:53] those who left,
[2:24:55] maybe couples are separated right now,
[2:24:58] whatever situation,
[2:25:01] may your grace come down, Lord.
[2:25:06] There's people who they're going to go
[2:25:08] home and they will have a conversation
[2:25:11] with you, Lord, because they realize
[2:25:13] they could walk out of a trauma
[2:25:18] with the confession from their heart to
[2:25:21] through their mouth and bring it to you.
[2:25:25] You promise, Lord, to set the captives
[2:25:28] free. You promise to heal the
[2:25:31] brokenhearted. And we know Lord when you
[2:25:33] speak it, it's the truth. And you back
[2:25:36] every word you say.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; I pray Lord that you even through the
[2:25:41] preaching of the word, some got free.
[2:25:45] Maybe others they need a conversation
[2:25:47] with you. Close shut the door in their
[2:25:49] secret closet and have a deep
[2:25:52] conversation
[2:25:54] to reach touch to freedom.
[2:25:59] Inspire this church. inspire this new
[2:26:02] pastor Lord with his family. Bless them.
[2:26:06] Bless this church. I pray Lord in Jesus
[2:26:09] name. Amen. Amen.
[2:26:14] Let's stand up
[2:26:18] in prisoner chain.
[2:26:21] [Music]
[2:26:30] Let's pray that night
[2:26:34] and in their pain
[2:26:38] began to see
[2:26:42] their chains were loose
[2:26:46] and they were free.

[2:27:11] the truth, the way.
[2:27:15] I bless your name.
[2:27:19] I bless your name.
[2:27:22] [Music]
[2:27:27] How
[2:27:29] if you should find
[2:27:33] that you're in a pre
[2:27:37] zone in your throne.
[2:27:42] Reach out and pray.
[2:27:45] [Music]
[2:27:46] defy those chains
[2:27:51] and they will fall
[2:27:55] in Jesus name.
[2:27:59] I bless your name.
[2:28:04] I bless your name.
[2:28:09] I give you all.
[2:28:13] I give you praise.
[2:28:18] You are the life,
[2:28:22] the truth, the way.
[2:28:27] I bless your name.

[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; One more time. I bless your name. I
[2:28:36] bless your name.
[2:28:40] I bless your name.
[2:28:44] I give you all.
[2:28:49] I give you praise.
[2:28:53] You are the life,
[2:28:56] [Music]
[2:28:57] the truth, the way.
[2:29:02] I bless your name.
[2:29:06] I bless your name.
[2:29:13] Praise be to God. Praise be to God. Did
[2:29:16] you enjoy it? Let's give it a hand to
[2:29:17] the Lord.
[2:29:18] [Applause]
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; I did enjoy it. I did enjoy it from the
[2:29:30] bottom of my heart. I did enjoy it.
[2:29:34] So many so many good things. I did enjoy
[2:29:37] it.
[2:29:40] Wow. Wow. One thing I don't want to
[2:29:44] elevate a man here, but one thing we
[2:29:49] really had a prophet.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; When you look at that, then you see, oh
[2:29:54] God,
[2:29:56] we were really privileged to have a
[2:29:58] prophet
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; in this last age.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; The end time message shall meet end time
[2:30:07] conditions. Amen.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a marvelous message of the
[2:30:12] hour.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; You look at it sometime looks so simple,
[2:30:16] but let the gift take the what the
[2:30:18] prophet says and expound it. Then you
[2:30:22] see, oh,
[2:30:25] how great message we have received.
[2:30:28] [Music]
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the prophet of the age.
[2:30:32] Thank God for the anointing over the
[2:30:34] eagle. But the anointing of a pastor can
[2:30:38] take the eagle anointing and put in the
[2:30:40] pastor level and see the needs in the
[2:30:43] church. See the needs in the families.
[2:30:46] We needed that. I needed that and I
[2:30:49] believe we needed that. Amen. May God
[2:30:52] help us. Thank you, brother Steve.
[2:30:56] So many thing I could say but
[2:31:00] it's a personal thing.
[2:31:02] personal thing go home digest it
[2:31:07] make it your reality
[2:31:09] but the key one of the key and I think
[2:31:12] it came to me many times and
[2:31:15] it's the caring
[2:31:18] the secret of brother Bana ministry is
[2:31:20] love
[2:31:22] he loved the people and people knew that
[2:31:26] he loved them
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; because he cared for them that was the
[2:31:31] level of of a of a prophet level of a of
[2:31:34] a of a pastor. If he love the people, if
[2:31:38] he care for them, oh, he might make
[2:31:41] mistakes, might, but they know that he
[2:31:43] cares for them. That's the secret for
[2:31:47] that level of the parents. Parents make
[2:31:50] mistakes. My parent made mistakes. Oh,
[2:31:53] but once I know that they care for me,
[2:31:56] they love me unconditionally.
[2:31:59] Oh, that's the key. That's the key
[2:32:01] because you don't you even friend
[2:32:05] when you have a friend it's because you
[2:32:07] think he cares for you right because he
[2:32:10] loves you he understands you but if that
[2:32:12] love you can find it in the parent then
[2:32:16] you don't want to lose that there's
[2:32:18] there's no price to that to that love
[2:32:20] that safety or knowing of someone cares
[2:32:23] for me someone loves me but as we heard
[2:32:27] today
[2:32:29] or sometimes we want to make that love
[2:32:32] negotiable.
[2:32:34] That's where we that's where we fail.
[2:32:36] May God help us. Amen. But the solution
[2:32:39] is in Christ. Amen. The solution is in
[2:32:42] Christ. When the tempter comes, when
[2:32:44] when Jesus comes, the tempter power is
[2:32:47] broken.
[2:32:52] We put the theme as a challenges.
[2:32:54] But this last service just saw how to
[2:32:57] solve those challenges. Oh, praise be to
[2:33:00] God. How to solve those challenges? It's
[2:33:03] in Jesus Christ.
[2:33:06] Do you know that song? Help me feel. And
[2:33:09] the sister is helping me.
[2:33:14] [Music]
[2:33:21] When Jes when Jesus comes,
[2:33:26] the tempest power is broken.
[2:33:31] When Jesus comes,
[2:33:34] [Music]
[2:33:35] the tears are up. The way it takes
[2:33:41] takes away
[2:33:43] and fills the with glory
[2:33:49] for his share.
[2:33:52] When Jesus comes to stay again
[2:33:57] when Jesus comes
[2:34:01] the temptor's power is broken.
[2:34:07] When Jesus comes,
[2:34:11] the tears are wondering.
[2:34:16] He takes the glory.
[2:34:20] His life with glory
[2:34:25] fall
[2:34:28] when Jesus comes to save.
[2:34:32] I'll try verse one. One sat alone.
[2:34:36] No. One sat alone.
[2:34:40] Beside the highway being
[2:34:45] his eyes were blind.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; He could not see.
[2:34:54] He touched the ram
[2:34:57] and shivered in the shadows.
[2:35:02] When Jesus came
[2:35:05] and bes
[2:35:07] [Music]
[2:35:18] when Jesus comes
[2:35:22] fills our walk the way
[2:35:26] he takes the gloom
[2:35:29] and fills the life with gloom. Glory
[2:35:34] for all change
[2:35:37] when Jesus comes to stay.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; How many can I have a testimony that
[2:35:44] before the services started you were
[2:35:46] different?
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; Now that you are ending the services,
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; something has changed.
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; Something has changed.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; And we don't want the devil to rob us
[2:35:57] from what has changed. No matter what we
[2:35:59] are going to encounter outside, I want
[2:36:02] to stay with what I've learned, what God
[2:36:04] has taught me, and something has changed
[2:36:07] in my life. Not to try, but I want to
[2:36:10] become what I've heard. Amen. Can we
[2:36:13] make that decision to the Lord this
[2:36:14] evening?
[2:36:16] Let's sing Way Maker. Way maker.
[2:36:20] You know that song. Way maker.

[2:41:29] just to make the the service long. I
[2:41:32] know we are tired maybe, but just think
[2:41:36] about the things for a moment as the
[2:41:38] music is playing just softly. I'm giving
[2:41:39] just one minute maybe just just to think
[2:41:42] deep for what we have heard.
[2:41:46] Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:41:49] sometimes the problem is not the other
[2:41:52] person.
[2:41:53] Sometimes the problem is me.
[2:41:56] My heart has deceived me
[2:42:00] Lord Jesus Christ. But
[2:42:03] help me Lord. Help me to humble myself.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. Help me Lord Jesus Christ to
[2:42:09] remove my ego. Help me father Lord to
[2:42:13] have that unconditional love.
[2:42:16] Help me Lord to be able sometimes to
[2:42:19] agree to disagree
[2:42:21] to give the free moral agency to the
[2:42:23] other person. But I still love him. I
[2:42:26] still love her. Oh God, help me to be
[2:42:30] that savior. Help me to be the one that
[2:42:33] can do the work of redemption.
[2:42:36] Oh God to be on the side of the one
[2:42:38] suffering but for the purpose of
[2:42:40] redeeming the other person.
[2:42:43] Oh God help me Lord help me. Might be my
[2:42:47] marriage, might be the church, might be
[2:42:49] in my family. Help me to be the one

[2:43:52] is a continuation of the fellowship that
[2:43:54] we had earlier. You can go there and
[2:43:57] spend some time over there for those who
[2:43:59] wish to go there and finish up the food.
[2:44:02] Amen. God bless you richly. Thank you.
[2:44:05] Um I like the heart of the of of Pastor
[2:44:08] Steve there. I missed to thank the
[2:44:10] church but he got it and thank the
[2:44:11] church for for the potluck. That was
[2:44:14] very good. Right on time. Thank God for
[2:44:16] that. So I appreciate you for all the
[2:44:18] sacrifices that you made. God bless you.
[2:44:20] Pastor Steve, there's a request of a
[2:44:22] brother says three days is not enough.
[2:44:25] We will pray for one week that you come
[2:44:28] for one week that you continue. We we
[2:44:31] pushed you a little bit. We want you to
[2:44:33] be free every for one week. Just teach
[2:44:36] us. Teach us. God bless you Rich. That
[2:44:38] was wonderful.
[2:44:40] Amen.
[2:44:42] [Music]
[2:44:43] [Applause]
[2:44:46] Brother Brent, I will come I'll call you
[2:44:49] to close the service
[2:44:51] is uh is one of the reasons maybe also
[2:44:55] to put me uh he invited me to the camp.
[2:44:58] I uh uh I was blessed there. It was a
[2:45:02] challenge and I said no I can't keep it
[2:45:05] for myself. I have to share that with
[2:45:07] the church and he's the one who invited
[2:45:10] me to that camp. So
[2:45:15] Amen. God bless you, saints. Good to be
[2:45:17] in here together. And God bless you,
[2:45:19] brother Steve. Enjoyed that tonight.
[2:45:21] I've heard some of those things before.
[2:45:23] He's like, "You're going to hear it.
[2:45:24] You've already heard this stuff." But
[2:45:25] you know what? There's just always
[2:45:26] something. The Lord will always open up,
[2:45:29] turn over another rock here, another
[2:45:30] rock there. Amen. There's just always
[2:45:32] something that we can learn and grow.
[2:45:35] Amen. Amen. God bless you all.
[2:45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, Lord, we just come
[2:45:40] before you this evening, Lord. Just
[2:45:42] thank you, Lord, for the gift that
[2:45:44] you've placed in our brother Steve's
[2:45:45] life, Lord. And many times these things,
[2:45:50] it's not just study that brings it. It
[2:45:52] comes from from pain that he's endured
[2:45:55] himself and and struggles in his own
[2:45:58] life and and scars that he's had to work
[2:46:00] through and these things. He's speaking
[2:46:02] from from experience and many of these
[2:46:04] things. And just seeing what the Lord
[2:46:07] has done in his life and his family is
[2:46:09] such a testimony. I've always
[2:46:11] appreciated that just seeing his family,
[2:46:13] Lord, and how you've just worked through
[2:46:16] him and you've he's led his family and
[2:46:18] it encourages me as a father myself,
[2:46:22] Lord, that I could each one of us as
[2:46:24] fathers and mothers this evening, Lord,
[2:46:26] and husbands and wives and even young
[2:46:29] people that we can take these things and
[2:46:31] apply them to our life. And just so many
[2:46:33] times, Satan tries to take these things
[2:46:35] that we've endured and and hide these
[2:46:38] things. And that's where Satan can have
[2:46:41] that stronghold and and whether these
[2:46:43] traumas I just find it so interesting
[2:46:46] this morning I was laboring myself on
[2:46:50] just talking about an open door and the
[2:46:52] open God you've given us an open door.
[2:46:54] You said, "Come up hither. Come up
[2:46:56] higher for us, each one of us." But just
[2:46:59] as you've called us up higher, Satan has
[2:47:01] opened up doors. And he uses open doors
[2:47:04] to bind us through these traumas and
[2:47:07] these things in our lives. But I pray
[2:47:10] this evening that these doors have been
[2:47:14] blown open, Lord. That you've called us
[2:47:16] up higher. that Satan's stronghold that
[2:47:18] he would be defeated in our lives that
[2:47:21] each one would take this and as we go
[2:47:23] forth from this place just go with us
[2:47:27] and your spirit would be present in us.
[2:47:29] We love you. Bless each and everyone
[2:47:31] here. Brother Moses, his heart I just uh
[2:47:35] real privileged to be here tonight.
