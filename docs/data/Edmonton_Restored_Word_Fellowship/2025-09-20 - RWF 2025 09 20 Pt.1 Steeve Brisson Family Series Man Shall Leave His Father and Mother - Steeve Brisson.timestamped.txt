[0:01] We go walk
[0:05] in the darkness.

[0:41] [Music]
[0:43] Dear heavenly merciful Lord,
[0:46] we thank you for gathering us together
[0:49] this evening, oh Lord, under the banner
[0:52] of your word.
[0:55] Your word which is a promise. Your word
[0:57] which is lifegiving. Your word which
[1:01] heals, which satisfies our hearts and
[1:03] souls. Oh Lord, this evening Lord, we
[1:06] are just here not to see one another,
[1:09] not to just be present, Lord, but so
[1:13] that we can hear your word and expect
[1:16] some something to happen within us,
[1:18] Lord, as we hear the word. Lord, I pray
[1:22] for this weekend services, Lord,
[1:24] starting with this one.
[1:26] There are needs amongst us, oh Lord, in
[1:29] each heart, in each in each household
[1:32] represented here, oh Lord.
[1:35] Father, I ask that you be with each
[1:38] heart. Prepare us. Give us peace. Once
[1:42] we have peace, Lord, we know you can
[1:44] work miracles. We know you are the
[1:47] miracle worker, as the song says.
[1:49] Father, we appreciate your your love.
[1:54] You have given us this life, not just to
[1:56] live it, Lord, but to show the world who

[2:15] Lord. May your word heal us. May the
[2:18] song service just take care of every
[2:21] need. Can you forgive us all Lord for
[2:23] all our our shortcomings Lord so that
[2:27] when your word comes Lord it will not
[2:29] find a speck of of of of sin within us
[2:32] Lord that will hinder the progress of
[2:34] your word. We want your word to come in
[2:36] and settle within our hearts and we will
[2:39] ponder and say wasn't the Lord good when
[2:41] the word was being preached. We thank
[2:44] you Lord. We honor you. We thank you for
[2:47] the visitors that are amongst us, Lord.

[13:15] that what matters the most and thank you
[13:17] Lord I will just um I would invite the
[13:20] word of God I'll invite brother brother
[13:23] Steve I think most of you know brother
[13:25] Steve I know brother Steve from from
[13:28] from couple of years and uh I've been to
[13:32] some I've been to the camp family camp
[13:34] I've been to the services that he he
[13:37] preached in the end time message
[13:39] regarding the family and it had been a
[13:41] blessing and I believe we all going to
[13:44] be blessed. Amen. I just want before I
[13:47] invite him, I just want to say one
[13:49] story, a small story. When I was young,
[13:52] when I was young minister, I was a
[13:54] single back then and I had a I had I had
[13:56] a roommate. I just put put you a
[13:58] picture. I had a roommate and I was a
[14:01] preacher and then one time his wife was
[14:03] back home and he called and he and he
[14:06] told to the wife and he was he was
[14:08] speaking to that in mother tongue. I
[14:10] couldn't understand everything he said.
[14:11] when he end up and I said brother that's
[14:14] not how he talk to the wife it's your
[14:17] love and everything and I was like know
[14:20] I'm I'm a young minister so telling to
[14:22] him he was a good friend of mine and he
[14:24] just saw brother Moses brother Moses I
[14:29] respect you a lot but when you'll be
[14:31] married
[14:32] &gt;&gt; then we can talk
[14:37] and when when I got married as I think
[14:40] of him as oh Brother Marshall.
[14:44] So that's what brother brother Steve is.
[14:46] So he's a he's he's married. He has
[14:49] children. He has a children who went
[14:52] through a teenager. He has a child who
[14:55] got married. Now he has a he's a
[14:58] grandpa. So he he can tell from
[15:01] experience.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; So uh uh maybe if I I'd say some advices
[15:06] here, some of them I say, "No, we wait
[15:08] for your children to be teenagers. We'll
[15:10] see uh how many remember on end time
[15:13] message I pre I preached one message on
[15:16] how to keep the kids in order in the
[15:18] church young kids and I didn't have any
[15:20] child there I spoke so hard and one
[15:24] brother of mine a friend of mine well
[15:26] later on when I had kids and said how
[15:28] how are you keeping the kids in the
[15:29] church so okay now I I preach by
[15:32] experience if I preach the same message
[15:34] by experience I will have a little bit
[15:37] of humility
[15:39] but when We are hearing today from God
[15:41] speaking to us but also someone who has
[15:44] experienced. So we come to learn you
[15:47] know the Holy Ghost is a gift but a
[15:49] character is something you have to work
[15:51] on. So we are here to learn God maybe
[15:55] our character mold us help us shape us.
[15:59] There are things we have to arrange.
[16:00] Help us Lord Jesus Christ to become
[16:03] better father, better husband, better
[16:06] wife, better mother, whatever God wants
[16:09] us to be. Are you willing to God?
[16:12] &gt;&gt; And I desire more of you.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; That's what we put it a little bit as a
[16:16] team as a challenges that we face, but
[16:18] don't only look at the challenges. Babam
[16:21] says the word of God, the anti- message
[16:24] will meet every conditions, every
[16:27] challenge. So we are here to learn from
[16:29] God so we can meet those challenges.
[16:31] Amen. And so we invite the word of God.
[16:33] Brother Steve, God bless you richly

[21:50] you.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; And so um it's my first time here and
[21:53] it's my first time to meet most of you.
[21:57] So I had the privilege to uh to meet uh
[22:00] the now I would say former pastor. I
[22:03] understand there's been a transition and
[22:05] so I wanted to pay my respect to my
[22:08] elder to my brother for your ministry
[22:12] and also for the support. So I bring you
[22:14] greetings from brother Andre Pet some of
[22:16] you know him. He's my father-in-law and
[22:19] so I bring greetings from from him and
[22:21] his wife. And also I want to thanks this
[22:24] church for the support you've been given
[22:26] to brother Andre and the mission field
[22:29] and so we are really uh grateful
[22:32] grateful for that and I want to uh
[22:35] congratulate the church and for a
[22:39] orderly transition changing a pastor is
[22:41] a huge challenge it is a huge challenge
[22:44] I've been uh there's been a transition
[22:46] between me my father-in-law 17 years ago
[22:49] uh this November unfortunately Certainly
[22:52] it was not an orderly transition because
[22:54] my father-in-law had a health issue and
[22:57] so it came upon the church suddenly and
[23:00] his his health was not doing fine and uh
[23:03] he felt in his heart that Lord was
[23:05] asking to move in in the mission field
[23:08] but it was it was it was sudden even
[23:10] though I was assist I was I was the
[23:12] assistant pastor since two weeks
[23:16] and two weeks after I was voted as the
[23:18] assistant pastor we thought me andre
[23:20] will work we we were already working
[23:22] together, but to work in that new
[23:24] capacity and we didn't have a chance
[23:26] because right away two weeks after he
[23:29] called me and his health was not doing
[23:32] good and the church was a bit in a
[23:34] turmoil and so when the pastor is not
[23:37] doing good and the church is already
[23:39] going through something then it became
[23:40] much worse and so I became the pastor in
[23:44] the middle of that and it it was a it
[23:45] was a difficult it was a long transition
[23:48] not to blame anyone but when a church
[23:51] can go through that process in in
[23:53] orderly way. I I I I cherish to to see
[23:57] that and I want to I want to to to say
[24:00] to the church it is a blessing. It
[24:02] doesn't make it easy. It doesn't make it
[24:04] easy. It's a change. Every man is
[24:05] different. That's why the prophet says,
[24:07] you know, they cannot be two heads in
[24:09] the church because every man will do it
[24:11] a certain way. And and me and my
[24:14] father-in-law had different different um
[24:17] totally different character. We love
[24:18] each other, but we're not built the same
[24:20] way. And so the church had got to use to
[24:23] me and and some it was difficult for
[24:25] them to get used to me. Well, he's not
[24:27] like brother Andre. Yes, I'm sorry for
[24:29] that. I
[24:31] even though I would try, I have to be my
[24:33] be myself. And so we we need the grace
[24:36] of God.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Church, a church to stand together, it
[24:40] needs it needs it needs God. It needs
[24:42] God. uh uh in in every place in the
[24:46] world they try to keep things together.
[24:48] It's they they try to keep a
[24:50] hockey team together. They try to keep
[24:53] have motivation and keep people together
[24:55] and they try every tricks in the book
[24:57] and it it's sometime a lot of time it
[25:00] doesn't work.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; They have to change a coach. They have
[25:03] to change a spirit. They have to change
[25:04] things all the time because there's no
[25:06] unity.
[25:08] So the miracle is when a group of people
[25:12] that are from different horizon and
[25:15] different makeup that we could walk
[25:18] together and accept the differences. You
[25:21] know sometimes the people want church to
[25:23] be like I don't know a a communist
[25:25] system where everybody's the same,
[25:27] everybody thinks the same. No, we should
[25:30] we should you know you know that there's
[25:32] the unity of faith and then there's the
[25:34] unity of spirit. The Paul says we should
[25:37] thrive for the unity of spirit until we
[25:39] reach the unity of faith.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; And unity of faith the prophet says he
[25:45] says when we going to see Jesus eye to
[25:47] eye then when we going to be with Jesus
[25:50] then he says we going to have unity of
[25:52] faith then we're going to see eye to
[25:54] eye. Until then to see eye to eye the
[25:56] prophet says he says I disagree even
[25:58] with my own wife.
[26:01] But but sometime people thought that
[26:02] unity of spirit was to everybody would
[26:05] see eye to eye exactly the same way
[26:08] every comma. I'm sorry to disappoint
[26:10] you. I don't think that's possible until
[26:12] we have a body change. There's things
[26:15] that there there's going to be you know
[26:17] there's those great theme that we agree
[26:19] but then when we going to fall into the
[26:21] small details there's there's
[26:22] differences.
[26:24] That's why that's why Paul taught to to
[26:26] to to to everybody to go after their own
[26:30] conscience.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; The Bible teaches that Romans, you know,
[26:33] and and and so because what we have a
[26:35] different conscience for for somebody
[26:36] this this seems okay and this other
[26:38] brother is like, "Oh my goodness, like I
[26:40] don't like this brother is doing this
[26:42] and and everybody wants the other people
[26:44] to be like them."
[26:46] &gt;&gt; And it caused many division. It caused
[26:47] many you it stirs the church and it's
[26:49] it's not it's not good.
[26:51] So, may the Lord bless you
[26:53] &gt;&gt; and and and and you all look good
[26:56] tonight. And so, I'm really happy to be
[26:58] with you. I'm happy, brother Moses, uh,
[27:01] for the fellowship. Um, he obviously he
[27:04] has interest in Quebec. His brother is
[27:06] there. His his brother is assistant
[27:08] pastor in a church in in Montreal, not
[27:10] too far away from home. So, he came
[27:12] visiting us and preach at our church.
[27:14] And I met him in Edmonton. And so,
[27:16] brother um when he texted me and he said
[27:19] that he wanted me to come by and he was
[27:21] a pastor uh I was like what?
[27:25] Okay. And then I told him I says I don't
[27:27] know if I should congratulate you or
[27:29] wish you my condolences. I I I I
[27:33] didn't know what to say. You know
[27:36] it is a blessing but being pastor is a
[27:39] is a huge is a huge challenge. It's not
[27:42] only a personal challenge. It's a p it's
[27:43] a it's a it's a challenge in your
[27:45] marriage. It's a challenge for your
[27:48] family. Um you can be seated. I feel
[27:51] like I I'm breaking the ice here. Sorry
[27:53] for for keeping you standing.
[27:58] Um I'm off note. I'm off script right
[28:00] now. I just feel on my heart to maybe
[28:02] talk a little bit about pastoring.
[28:06] When
[28:08] when my wife um realized
[28:12] that I was about to become the next
[28:14] pastor,
[28:16] she would cry. She was crying.
[28:18] And I was shocked because I looked at
[28:20] her. I was like, "Why are you crying,
[28:21] honey? I mean, this is this is God's
[28:24] calling. This is this is precious, you
[28:26] know." But I didn't realize she's a
[28:28] pastor's daughter,
[28:30] so she knew what she was getting into. I
[28:33] didn't know.
[28:36] So, we had to sit down and have our
[28:37] conversation together. And she explained
[28:39] to me what she went through as a kid
[28:42] when the the father became a pastor. She
[28:45] felt like a vacuum swallowed daddy
[28:49] &gt;&gt; and she felt like we lost daddy when he
[28:52] be because my father-in-law became the
[28:55] pastor when the church was splitting
[28:57] because the other pastor left the
[28:59] message with half of the church. So
[29:01] there that was not an orderly
[29:02] transition. So our church has been
[29:05] there. So the first pastor was there 17
[29:07] years. Then the second one's been 17
[29:10] years. I'm in my 17 years. And some of
[29:12] them I'm wondering Lord what's coming.
[29:17] But I see there's a change right now in
[29:19] our church. Might not be a change of
[29:20] pastor, but something something is
[29:22] changing. Church, you've been there for
[29:23] years. God is still challenging the
[29:26] church. challenge the church to be
[29:28] better and to enter more in our uh in
[29:30] our calling. And so I had to sat down
[29:33] and and listen instead of just saying,
[29:34] "Well, if you cry, it's a lack of faith
[29:37] and you should just shake out of it." I
[29:39] didn't do that. I sat down and listened
[29:41] to her heart and understood it was not a
[29:43] lack of wanting to serve God is that she
[29:46] she just knew what was the price. And
[29:49] then we made a covenant together. I had
[29:51] to make a covenant with her that I would
[29:54] I would by the grace of God not forget
[29:58] the family. But at first in my mind
[30:00] that's not what I had in my mind as a
[30:02] pastor because I was like Lord you know
[30:04] I have uh many children but if you call
[30:06] me to as a pastor then you ask me to to
[30:08] to take uh care of your people then you
[30:12] Lord you'll have to take care of my
[30:14] children while I take care of your
[30:15] people. And no, I see your reaction now.
[30:20] The Lord didn't want to do that deal
[30:21] with me. And he reminded me of Moses.
[30:24] Moses, you know, was leading the people
[30:27] of God. But his own son,
[30:30] &gt;&gt; his own son was not circumcised. He
[30:32] would preach that every Sunday. You need
[30:34] to be circumcised and we need to apply
[30:36] the token or whatever he was preaching.
[30:38] But at home,
[30:40] but he had a wife.
[30:43] She helped him good that day when the
[30:45] angel came. The angel didn't give him a
[30:47] pass because well, since you're taking
[30:50] care of my people, I'll give you a pass
[30:51] on your family. And so for me, these
[30:54] were the first lessons as God is calling
[30:56] me pastoring was my my wife's reaction
[30:59] and and then my uh my conception of what
[31:04] my life would be. Then God right away
[31:06] told me this this is this won't be it.
[31:09] If I'm asking you to be a pastor, I'm
[31:10] asking you more.
[31:13] And then then I realized, okay, this is
[31:15] serious. This is there's no pass. And so
[31:19] it's a it's a it's a it's a blessing.
[31:21] It's a great calling. Some people think
[31:23] sometime that is glamorous. You know,
[31:26] you have a title, people respect you,
[31:27] but sometime they don't. But you know,
[31:30] you get both. You know, you get both.
[31:33] And and uh Quebec is a different
[31:35] culture. I I know here maybe Edmonton is
[31:37] conservative and and and back in the US
[31:39] they they have their this appreciation
[31:42] day for pastor like it's almost like a
[31:44] national thing you know appreciation day
[31:46] for pastors that's a we don't know known
[31:48] such thing in Quebec
[31:50] in Quebec the background is Catholic so
[31:53] people are rough with the church people
[31:55] are rough not talking about church
[31:57] people but but there's there's a stigma
[31:59] with with pastor because it it reminds
[32:02] them of priests and priests have caused
[32:04] a lot of doubt damage in Quebec. And so
[32:07] there is there is that stigma when you
[32:09] say you're a pastor. People are like,
[32:11] "Ah, is it like a priest?" I'm like,
[32:14] "Yeah, but I have kids and I'm married."
[32:15] Oh, that's good. That's good.
[32:18] [Laughter]
[32:20] So, may the Lord bless this church in
[32:22] this transition.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Be patient.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Be patient. It's not because things have
[32:29] been done physically,
[32:31] vote and this and that. it doesn't mean
[32:33] that
[32:35] it's it's completed.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; So be patient. Be patient with what's
[32:39] one another. Be patient with the new
[32:41] pastor.
[32:43] And and and just walk slowly as the Lord
[32:46] is completing
[32:48] the transition in the spiritual realm.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; One pastor told me that was pastor many
[32:55] years before me. He says, "Brother
[32:57] Steve, I don't want to discourage you,
[32:59] but he says, he says, I felt it took me
[33:01] seven years
[33:03] to really feel like I was fully the
[33:06] pastor." And then I went realized a
[33:09] couple of years later, I went in the
[33:10] Bible and it took seven years for David,
[33:13] you know, that he was first pastor of
[33:14] Judah for seven years until the rest of
[33:17] Israel was like they were watching him.
[33:21] you know the house of Saul and and and
[33:24] the rest of the tribes they were
[33:25] watching David from far like can we
[33:27] trust him? Will it be like Saul? Will it
[33:30] be like this? Will it be not saying the
[33:32] old pastor was Saul? No, no, no, no, no,
[33:33] no, no. But just just the difference,
[33:35] you know, and and then the rest and it
[33:37] took he was a king. He was king seven
[33:40] years and then God dealt with the heart
[33:44] of the rest of the Israel.
[33:47] And so we don't run into into these
[33:50] things. We cannot rush. We cannot push
[33:52] other like well you should accept the
[33:53] new pastor. You should you push. We
[33:55] don't push these things. God is in
[33:57] control.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; We believe God started this church
[34:01] &gt;&gt; and what he started he will finish.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; All right. So this was not premidated.
[34:06] It's off script but I just felt in my
[34:08] heart just to encourage you.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; We've been we've been through those
[34:12] transition and just felt in my heart to
[34:14] encourage you. God bless you.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. We will stand tonight. read a a
[34:20] portion of the scriptures in the book of
[34:21] Ephesians 5 28-33
[34:26] and um and then after that uh honestly I
[34:30] don't know how much I'm going to preach
[34:31] and I'm much I'm going to share with my
[34:34] own heart uh what the burden I have for
[34:38] families the burden I have for
[34:41] &gt;&gt; for marriage and you'll I I'll give you
[34:44] a little bit of my background after we
[34:45] read the scriptures maybe you'll got get
[34:48] um some understanding. Ephesians 5
[34:50] 28-33.
[34:55] So ought men to love their wives as
[34:57] their own bodies. He that loveth his
[34:59] wife loveth himself.
[35:03] For no man ever yet hated his own flesh,
[35:05] but nourisheth and cherisheth even as
[35:08] the Lord the church.
[35:12] For we are members of his body, of his
[35:14] flesh, and of his bones. For this cause
[35:17] shall a man leave his father and mother,
[35:19] and shall be joined unto his wife, and
[35:22] they shall two, and they too shall be
[35:25] one flesh. This is a great mystery, but
[35:28] I speak concerning Christ and the
[35:29] church. Nevertheless, let every one of
[35:31] you in particular so love his wife even
[35:34] as himself, and the wife see as she as
[35:37] she reverence her husband.
[35:41] May the Lord have the blessing upon the
[35:43] reading of the word. You can be seated.
[35:47] So as uh brother Moses in his is his his
[35:50] introduction
[35:52] I'm used to call him.
[35:55] Okay.
[36:07] Amen.
[36:20] I'm telling my Congalles friends, I'm
[36:22] guessing some of them are Congalles,
[36:24] that I'll be in Congo. So, I was
[36:26] speaking French. So, Lord willing, I'll
[36:28] be in Congo next month. I've been
[36:30] wanting to go. I had on my heart to go
[36:32] since over 10 years. And the Lord never
[36:35] opened the door, but I knew I know in my
[36:37] heart that I needed to go. And finally,
[36:40] the Lord made a way. And so we will be
[36:42] in Congo next uh next month. So as our
[36:46] brother introduced me talking about my
[36:48] family. So yes, we we have a a tribe. Um
[36:53] it's uh the Bison.
[36:55] And so my um my oldest son is married
[36:59] and got married a year ago and now they
[37:03] have a baby. They didn't wait for a long
[37:05] time. They were I guess they were ready
[37:08] and so now I'm a grandpa. So that's a
[37:10] new season of life. So there's a brother
[37:12] elder in my church says, "Brother Steve,
[37:13] we should expect some grandpa sermon
[37:15] soon." You know, the the the ministry of
[37:17] the grandpa. And so yes, maybe that's
[37:20] going to come, but it's all new to me. I
[37:21] need I need to learn. So you have
[37:23] brother Andre and sister Suzanne. So we
[37:25] just celebrated their 50th wedding
[37:27] anniversary uh last month. And so it was
[37:30] last May, but to get all the kids spread
[37:33] across America, their children to be
[37:36] together, it had to be in September. So,
[37:40] so yes, our our children is from 16 to
[37:45] uh 23. All of them are are um all of
[37:49] them are serving the Lord. And um but
[37:52] it's it's been a challenge. And I would
[37:55] say that tonight it's it's going to be
[37:57] partially, you know, obviously I'm
[37:59] preaching the word of God, but it comes
[38:02] it comes from also from from experience
[38:05] and and
[38:09] I was raised in the message. So when in
[38:11] 1979 my my my mother gave her life to
[38:13] the Lord. I was two years old. I was
[38:15] raised in a church and at 17 I back. So
[38:18] at seven actually uh my my father left
[38:21] for Greece. So so I'm half Greek or I'm
[38:25] my father's Greek, my mother is French
[38:26] Canadian and he left for Greece and I
[38:29] never saw him until I was 22 and I got
[38:31] married. he kind of show up and and so I
[38:34] was raised without a father and I always
[38:35] thought that it's not a big deal but I
[38:38] was raised with no sibling just with my
[38:39] mother she's working try to make a
[38:41] living no father and so it was it was a
[38:44] pretty lonely lonely childhood and
[38:48] raised in an environment that was not
[38:50] always positive and and as you grow up
[38:54] so at 17 I I I can't my my mom left you
[38:57] know usually teenagers go through rough
[38:59] time and they run away but this time my
[39:01] mother went through a difficult time and
[39:03] she ran away. She left the house and she
[39:05] went to live with a man and I ended up
[39:08] at 16 years old alone living on my own.
[39:11] Tried to do your own laundry and all
[39:13] that. And I didn't realize it was when
[39:17] you go through that you just cope. You
[39:18] just cope. But it's when my son turned
[39:21] 16, I realized I looked at my son when
[39:24] he turned 16. I'm like this is when my
[39:26] mom left.
[39:28] My goodness. That that's
[39:31] That's a crime. I mean that's
[39:33] &gt;&gt; this this is serious
[39:35] &gt;&gt; start to dawn on me that okay something
[39:38] I was raised but like there iso big
[39:40] holes in my life and you think it
[39:43] doesn't affect you
[39:45] &gt;&gt; or you think that your new birth will
[39:48] fix the holes as a you know the new
[39:52] birth will fix you spiritually you know
[39:55] but there is there is things in in the
[39:57] background that we tend to repeat
[40:01] because We we learned certain things. We
[40:04] I grew up without a father. So when I
[40:06] started having children, I was asking my
[40:08] wife, "So what did your dad do when this
[40:10] happened? What did you I was looking for
[40:12] a model.
[40:14] Did Jesus say, "I do what I see the
[40:16] father doing?"
[40:18] But when you're raised in a fatherless
[40:21] home, you are clueless because you're
[40:24] never if Jesus was doing what the father
[40:26] was showing him. If if Jesus as he
[40:29] walked on earth had words from the
[40:31] father saying this is my beloved son.
[40:36] I never had that moment of affirmation
[40:38] where a father declare his son.
[40:42] But but but God is showing that as a
[40:45] model of fatherhood. Amen.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; So when you don't have those moment, you
[40:49] don't make a big deal out of it because
[40:51] you don't know what you don't know.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; You know, if you have a father that that
[40:56] that really, you know, you know, abuse
[40:58] you physically, you know that he hurt
[41:00] you. You know that he was bad. But
[41:03] fatherless home is an invisible pain, is
[41:06] an invisible scar. You don't know that
[41:09] you're damaged because it's invisible.
[41:12] It took me many many years to see that I
[41:15] was crippled in a certain in my
[41:17] humanity. Now I was a servant of God. I
[41:20] had many experience with God,
[41:21] supernatural experience with God. Caught
[41:23] in the ministry, married a wonderful
[41:25] daughter of God. But in my fatherhood, I
[41:27] I was as a human being, I was crippled
[41:29] in many areas of my life and I didn't
[41:32] know it until I start to raise those
[41:35] precious treasure and I started to
[41:38] repeat some of the patterns.
[41:41] Then I realized there's something wrong
[41:43] with my fatherhood.
[41:46] But then I didn't know better. And so
[41:48] that was a long process to for me to go
[41:51] and and find healing and find answers
[41:53] for myself to become the father I never
[41:56] had, which is is a great challenge. So
[41:59] for me, that's where
[42:02] family and and marriage became a burden
[42:05] because I knew how crippled and how much
[42:08] the first three we we laugh sometime
[42:10] now. We can laugh about it, but the
[42:12] first three kids, especially the first
[42:15] two, they I started I I really started
[42:17] on a bad I would say on a bad way of
[42:20] approaching and dealing with them. And
[42:22] and I could see in their eyes that
[42:26] I didn't have it. I was causing distress
[42:28] in them. I was causing more. They had
[42:30] something I would I would make it worse.
[42:33] I try to keep it straight, but I was too
[42:34] strict. And and I would I would
[42:36] overwhelm them with my my discipline.
[42:38] And I I I I didn't know how to do it. I
[42:41] love the Lord. I could preach. Boy, I
[42:43] could preach.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; You know, you may be a great preacher.
[42:48] That's okay.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't make you a great father.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; You can know the message and you can
[42:53] read and have some experience with God.
[42:56] I mean, Moses is a great example for
[42:58] that. How he could lead millions of
[43:00] people,
[43:02] but not taking care of his home
[43:05] &gt;&gt; until God had to send an angel. say you
[43:08] got it all wrong
[43:10] and so it is a great burden and and and
[43:13] some maybe some of you heard me preach
[43:15] on these so back home I don't preach on
[43:17] these theme all the time I preach you
[43:19] know we have a prophetic message there's
[43:22] there's there's you know there's the
[43:23] open word there there's so many things
[43:25] that we were blessed but there's that
[43:26] theme so and when when a pastor called
[43:29] me and I and I preach on family in many
[43:31] places around the world I just come back
[43:32] from India we did a family series had a
[43:34] great great impact I did in New Zealand
[43:36] it had a great impact back. So when I go
[43:39] out, most of the time it's because a
[43:40] pastor is like, "Brother Steve, we have
[43:42] a family camp. We want you to come." So
[43:44] it has kind of become something that I
[43:47] do, especially when I go out because of
[43:49] of the background I had. And because
[43:51] maybe because my background is so
[43:54] broken, it made me study that more and
[43:57] it's been a help around the world. And
[43:59] so maybe some people think, well, that's
[44:00] all he preached. That's all we hear.
[44:02] Because when I go out, that's what I do
[44:04] back home. It's not just what we deal
[44:07] upon. The word is uh the word is there's
[44:10] so many things. It's not just family.
[44:12] But where I come from and where I was
[44:14] raised, it those topic was totally
[44:16] overlooked.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Totally overlooked. God sent a prophet.
[44:20] This is the end time. Rapture is at
[44:22] hand. Just a prophetic view. It was just
[44:24] a prophetic view. But the pastoral view
[44:28] of strong families make strong church
[44:32] &gt;&gt; was totally over totally overlooked. So
[44:35] we were raised in a clueless environment
[44:37] about how to raise kids, how to build
[44:40] strong families. We God sent a prophet,
[44:43] you know, we believe these things. But
[44:45] because they went so much on a prophetic
[44:47] side, they forgot the pastoral side.
[44:51] So this is my background. So if I make
[44:53] some comments, so I don't know you, I
[44:55] don't know. So it it's not because of
[44:57] what I think about you, but what I'm
[44:59] going to preach tonight is or if I'm
[45:01] critical, it's it's it's because of the
[45:05] background that I come from. So my
[45:09] prayer tonight, this this this can be a
[45:11] a help.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Um now I want to start with with a
[45:16] quote. Now obviously sometime I such a
[45:18] bunch of rules. I I I might go I think I
[45:23] got a little problem with the rem. Okay.
[45:26] Okay, let's go to rules quickly because
[45:29] I'm going to teach tonight can be
[45:31] something that can be misused. Okay, so
[45:34] the principle and teaching and we're
[45:37] going to learn through these meetings
[45:38] going to be tonight, tomorrow morning
[45:40] and tomorrow night. Tomorrow night so we
[45:43] it's tonight is a slow start. We need to
[45:44] break the ice. You need to understand
[45:46] where I come from. Why do I preach? I I
[45:48] talk like I talk. But one thing for sure
[45:51] is that we cannot use this to attack to
[45:55] blame our parents or members of our
[45:56] family. So this as we expose those
[46:00] things obviously we going to expose
[46:01] things that we're lacking.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[46:04] &gt;&gt; And to be honest even though I learned
[46:06] so many principles I still have to go
[46:08] back and sit with my children as adults
[46:10] now. My oldest is 23 my second is 22 the
[46:13] other one is 28. I sit with them and if
[46:16] they go through something I realize okay
[46:17] that pattern what you're doing right now
[46:19] this is because of me or this is because
[46:21] of your mother the way we the way we
[46:23] approach this with you made you call and
[46:24] so we we have an open discussion and we
[46:26] are we are aware of our failure as
[46:29] parents so we every parents if you think
[46:32] you had it perfectly you might need to
[46:34] revise we did our best so it's it's
[46:37] nothing about to blame anyone but it's
[46:39] to bring a a greater understanding so we
[46:42] cannot also use this teaching to blame
[46:44] or attack the pastor or local church.
[46:45] Well, if only the pastor. Well, if only
[46:47] the church. If if only someone. We're
[46:50] not here to blame. We're here to learn.
[46:52] And if something we need to we're here
[46:54] to heal in the presence of God.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; All right. So, this teaching is meant to
[47:00] help you in your personal walk and not
[47:02] to point fingers.
[47:04] All right. So, do do we have an
[47:06] agreement?
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Really important because I'm I'm I'm I'm
[47:09] giving information. I'm giving advice
[47:11] and in principles that can be used as a
[47:13] weapon to attack somebody else to blame
[47:15] somebody. So it needs to be taken in the
[47:18] right spirit and also you don't go home
[47:20] try to fix your parents or try to fix
[47:22] your family if you're children or try to
[47:24] fix your church. uh it's for you
[47:27] personally when I preach that to I did
[47:29] preach these same things to youth camps
[47:31] for children to understand for the kids
[47:33] to understand that they need to react in
[47:37] a better way even though the family
[47:39] sometime they struggle they have a role
[47:42] to try not to fix it but their attitude
[47:46] because the Bible says Paul says in the
[47:47] book of Corinthians it's not for the
[47:48] children to lay for the parents
[47:51] &gt;&gt; we cannot place the burden to embed the
[47:54] family to the kids and sometime you know
[47:56] when when that's a big mistake parents
[47:59] do if if they if if the marriage is
[48:01] fighting then the mother start confiding
[48:04] in the daughter well you're that your
[48:05] father is like this and and he's doing
[48:07] this and then she puts all unload all
[48:09] the burden the problem marriage to the
[48:11] children don't ever do that because the
[48:13] children now is going to try to do
[48:15] something to fix it and it's a it's a
[48:17] it's such a burden that they cannot bear
[48:19] it'll damage them they need to be
[48:22] children become before they become the
[48:24] wife especially if there's the that
[48:27] their dad is not the husband there's
[48:29] it's it's their dad okay so I to I get
[48:32] was ahead of myself so the children are
[48:33] not to lay up for the parents but it's
[48:35] the parents that need to carry the
[48:36] burden to lay for the children also you
[48:41] cannot use the teaching to justify your
[48:42] wrong habits and behavior oh now I
[48:44] understand why I'm this ambador or why
[48:46] I'm delinquent it's because it's because
[48:49] you you'll find that the prophet lays
[48:50] reasons why there's neurotics and
[48:53] gangsters and street. There's many
[48:55] quotes and in many place those quotes
[48:57] been overlooked. We're going to study
[48:58] them tonight and tomorrow. It's all
[49:00] laying there. The prophet is point the
[49:02] finger, point the cause and effect. If
[49:05] those gangster neurotic turns in the
[49:07] street, why why are they like that? So,
[49:09] we can now blame, well, okay, now I know
[49:11] why I'm a gangster. Well, we cannot use
[49:14] that as an excuse because God has a way
[49:18] out. If you're a gangster, if you're
[49:20] neurotic, if you're if you're a hidden
[49:22] delinquent, God will find you. And God
[49:26] wants to take you out of that pattern
[49:28] because God God have called Christians
[49:31] out of every bad situation, off the
[49:35] streets, off the New York gang,
[49:37] gangsters, and whatever. God God can. So
[49:40] we have no excuse to remain in in in in
[49:45] if we're stuck in a rut somewhere we
[49:47] have no excuse to stay there. But there
[49:49] is explanation though. There is the
[49:51] prophet brought those things. All right.
[49:54] So we have a contract together.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; All right. You all signed up. That's all
[49:58] good.
[50:00] I will start with a quote, a simple one
[50:02] and it will give you maybe uh a better
[50:05] understanding of the mistake where I
[50:09] come from. Again, I will always put it
[50:11] where I come from.
[50:13] But I've traveled many places and I
[50:15] realized there was a pattern in in our
[50:17] ranks in the message. There was a
[50:19] pattern that I could see many many
[50:21] places. Seems like it's been uh uh the
[50:25] same mistake. And that mistake we find
[50:27] in that quote. So the prophet says not
[50:30] long ago we were going together across
[50:32] the country and he said to me talking
[50:35] about brother Fendler he says brother
[50:37] Brandham you know my wife don't believe
[50:38] in this. So she didn't believe the
[50:40] message and said every night when I go
[50:42] to church and come home oh she just
[50:43] start balling me out when I hit the
[50:45] door. And I said I get her I get her by
[50:47] the hand. She's little and hold her and
[50:49] I try to to cast that devil as hard as I
[50:52] can. And it remind me of your message
[50:54] this morning, sir. Said, I tried to cast
[50:56] that devil out. I says, "Devil, you come
[50:58] out of my wife. Devil, you come out of
[51:00] my wife. Honey, you're possessed with
[51:02] the devil. Come out of there, devil."
[51:05] Well, I said, "That's fine, Brother
[51:07] Fendler, but you go at it the wrong
[51:09] way." Now, I got a question for you. Did
[51:11] that brother believe the message?
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Obviously, he did.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; So, he believed the message.
[51:19] He he and he's trying to apply what he
[51:22] would say. He's trying to apply the word
[51:25] to his marriage.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; We hear that many time. Well, I applied
[51:29] a word and she left.
[51:31] Oh, praise the Lord, brother. You You've
[51:33] been faithful. Well, we should ask the
[51:36] next question. How did you handle it?
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Right? So, sometimes the thought of like
[51:42] if you believe the message, you believe
[51:43] everything the prophet said, your
[51:45] marriage going to turn right.
[51:48] It depends. Did you get it? Because this
[51:52] brother and also he's taking inspiration
[51:54] from the prayer lines because he says,
[51:56] "I've watched you on the pulpit how you
[51:59] deal with demons."
[52:01] And he he he tried to bring that and
[52:04] apply it at home the same way. Now, I'm
[52:08] wondering how many time can you squeeze
[52:11] your wife, hold your hands, and squeeze
[52:13] her tight and and and cast the devil
[52:15] out. I'm I'm wondering how much can you
[52:18] do that until you run you literally run
[52:21] your wife away from the house
[52:23] and once she leaves you say well she's
[52:25] serpent seed
[52:30] and I'm glad that this example is there
[52:34] because and and and I think it's like an
[52:36] exaggeration. I I I I didn't see that a
[52:40] lot, but I know that a lot of people
[52:41] when they came to the Lord and the
[52:44] spouse was kind of late and not coming,
[52:46] they made they made s they they poison
[52:49] the atmosphere of the house because the
[52:51] other one was not serving the Lord.
[52:54] Instead of bringing the love in the
[52:55] house,
[52:56] &gt;&gt; they brought war. It's not always the
[52:59] the unbeliever who brought war. In this
[53:02] case, you know, he didn't react well.
[53:05] She she was not happy.
[53:08] Imagine she if if the wife this wife
[53:11] think my husband is in a cult.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Okay. He was not. But she thought
[53:17] obviously she probably thought so.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Now when he start doing this it kind of
[53:23] confirms to her. Yeah. That's what I
[53:25] thought.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; So the prophet had to correct him and
[53:31] give him marital advice. That's right.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; And he told he says, "You go at it a
[53:38] wrong way."
[53:40] &gt;&gt; So
[53:42] he said, he says, "When you come home,
[53:45] buy her a box of candy."
[53:48] Well, someone said, "Well, that's just a
[53:49] bunch of psychology."
[53:52] Prophet says,
[53:53] &gt;&gt; "Go it the wrong way."
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Give it to her. When you come in at the
[53:57] door, put your arms around her and say,
[53:59] "That's the way you cast out devil."
[54:02] Love cast out fear. So actually she was
[54:06] afraid because her husband is in a
[54:08] church and is this and that and she's
[54:10] afraid and now he's afraid that she's
[54:13] going to be lost. And so fear clash with
[54:15] fear
[54:17] &gt;&gt; and the devil has a party while they
[54:19] destroy each other.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; So ones has to show love, real love. And
[54:24] love is redemp love is to bring love is
[54:26] redemptive.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. like we we preach about redemption
[54:30] and and Ruth and Boaz all great themes
[54:32] spiritual theme but it can be applied in
[54:34] the home naturally that's what's great
[54:36] is those those big prophetic things that
[54:38] we learn if we scale it down we can
[54:42] enjoy the blessing when we apply those
[54:44] principle in the natural realm it's not
[54:47] just principle spiritual principle so
[54:49] friends the world is dying for love
[54:53] that's one of the great blessing that we
[54:55] leave out of Pentecostal blessing too
[54:58] of it is love that mixth together. The
[55:00] mortar that makes gift and all the
[55:02] things of God operate perfectly is love
[55:06] one for the other. And this is all this
[55:08] will all men know that you're my
[55:11] disciples.
[55:13] So the prophet took the concept the
[55:16] brother had of c casting demons out of
[55:18] your wife and exchange that for a box of
[55:21] candy and telling your wife I love you.
[55:25] Now some of us try to sometime we would
[55:27] like to say okay well I'll try that but
[55:29] then when the box of chocolate is thrown
[55:33] against the wall then we're like well it
[55:35] didn't work
[55:37] because sometime we want quick result.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; We we use love as a money exchange. Okay
[55:44] then I'll I'll I'll try the candy and I
[55:46] and I'll try love. No, you don't have
[55:48] love. You don't try love. You are love.
[55:53] Love is not a currency. Love is a
[55:56] person.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; You know we have the pyramid there. The
[55:59] charity at the top is not an emo. That
[56:02] love is not an emotion. It's not a
[56:03] feeling. That love at the top there.
[56:05] It's Christ in you.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Christ I came down.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; We our first scripture we read is
[56:14] husband love your wife as you love
[56:18] yourself.
[56:21] Are we good?
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I want to explain another
[56:26] principle
[56:28] is that
[56:31] and this is really um peculiar not
[56:34] peculiar uh this is really related to
[56:37] our movement. So in our ranks, in our
[56:40] movement, we have we have received a
[56:42] prophet. We have received such a
[56:44] prophetic gift and and and and it even
[56:47] though the prophet after the seals, he
[56:49] says, don't change anything.
[56:52] Don't go out and become weird, you know,
[56:56] stay humble and plant your potatoes.
[56:58] Don't change anything. Yes, this great
[57:00] revelation, but you know what? My my
[57:04] I think we've changed a lot of things.
[57:07] And we change sometime also how church
[57:11] operates
[57:13] and now we see the exaggeration now
[57:15] because everything became prophet
[57:18] prophetic prophet as and then
[57:23] the pastor's office the pastoral role
[57:27] has changed in the side the people
[57:29] because the prophetic ministry is so big
[57:32] that prophet a pastor had to to try to
[57:36] navigate and exercise their ministry in
[57:38] a shadow of a such a great prophet
[57:41] that the role of the pastor or the the
[57:45] qualities or the attributes of a
[57:47] pastoral heart has been forgotten by the
[57:50] people. That's right. And and it seems
[57:53] like even the pastor a lot of places has
[57:56] lost their authority and and and when
[57:58] they speak now they need quotes all the
[58:01] time because
[58:03] his burden and what he has on his heart
[58:06] is not enough. It needs to be back up
[58:09] backed up by
[58:11] the prophetic side. Now I want you to I
[58:14] want to show something to you here and
[58:17] maybe it can it can help you understand
[58:19] what I'm trying to say. So in the book
[58:21] of Romans, Paul justifies
[58:24] by faith. He justify Abraham by faith.
[58:27] You you know those things. I so I'll go
[58:29] quickly. But James, when James talks, he
[58:33] justify Abraham by works.
[58:36] For many years, people thought the Bible
[58:38] contradict himself until the prophet
[58:40] came and gave the explanation.
[58:45] But it seems that those two minister
[58:47] contradicts it themsself
[58:50] obviously. Yeah. Therefore being
[58:52] justified by faith or justified by works
[58:54] it seems like a contradiction. But then
[58:56] the prophet comes and says you know the
[58:58] two men that were talking on faith Paul
[59:00] justify Abraham by what God saw
[59:04] &gt;&gt; in Abraham but James justify Abraham by
[59:06] what men saw.
[59:10] And so actually the prophet says it's
[59:12] the angle the point of view that are
[59:14] different.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; But when you look at the nature of those
[59:17] two men's Paul was an apostle but Paul
[59:19] was also a prophet but James was a
[59:22] pastor.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; And those two anointing are totally
[59:26] totally different. The the anointing of
[59:29] an evangelist and a prophet it's the
[59:31] eagle anointing is totally different
[59:36] than the pastor's anointing which is an
[59:38] ox.
[59:40] And sometime pastors are blamed for not
[59:44] being spiritual enough
[59:46] too too earthly, too grounded and and
[59:49] but exact. It's it's exactly and it
[59:51] brought to such a misunderstanding
[59:53] through all those years like James
[59:55] contradicts Paul's who we think he is.
[59:57] He was not contradicting. It's because
[59:59] since he's the ox, he has four feet on
[1:00:01] the ground and what he saw is what
[1:00:03] Abraham did.
[1:00:06] But the prophet could see Paul, it could
[1:00:10] see that when he did in his heart, it
[1:00:13] was a done deal.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; But the pastor is watching
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; because he's earthly.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; He has no wings.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; So the prophet even says he's a
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; burdenbearer.
[1:00:28] That's right.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; So, and prophet talks about you know
[1:00:30] evangelist comes to town and everybody's
[1:00:32] like oh wow we were so blessed last
[1:00:34] lately we had an evangelist coming and
[1:00:36] and brother said well I could hear that
[1:00:38] every week like oh it was so we were so
[1:00:40] blessed like well thank you I feel good
[1:00:42] you know
[1:00:45] and and and but happen so so those
[1:00:48] flying eagle they could be the
[1:00:50] evangelist or prophet put such a shadow
[1:00:53] in and and our movement is be it has
[1:00:55] become extreme in a sense that Now so
[1:00:58] many people they want to hear a tape.
[1:01:01] They don't want to hear the pastor. Or
[1:01:02] if they allow the pastor to preach, he
[1:01:04] has to quote all the time. He's not
[1:01:07] allowed to be a pastor. He has to be a
[1:01:09] prophet reading quotes.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; And and so there's different level, but
[1:01:16] it has all the same thing in common.
[1:01:20] the backfire of God sending a prophet as
[1:01:24] people as has cornered and tied the pro
[1:01:27] the pastors in a corner where he has not
[1:01:30] he has not liberty anymore to exercise
[1:01:33] his ministry on a pastoral level. That's
[1:01:37] right.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Neville preached a message at
[1:01:41] Brennham Tabernacle. And you know what
[1:01:43] what it was? The prophet says, "Brother
[1:01:44] Neville preached a great evangelistic
[1:01:46] message and he and he and he and he and
[1:01:49] he preached a sermon on kids and
[1:01:51] malnutrition
[1:01:55] a pastor and he's preaching in his
[1:01:58] church on how kids eat too much and eat
[1:02:01] bad food."
[1:02:04] I'm wondering how many pastor message
[1:02:06] would be would be allowed to do that.
[1:02:10] There's a portion there's a natural
[1:02:12] element of the pastor's office that
[1:02:18] has been and I've watched it has been
[1:02:20] despised
[1:02:23] for many year which as and I remember
[1:02:26] even my father-in-law in my own church
[1:02:29] he would preach off the Bible and and
[1:02:31] simple things try to apply simple
[1:02:34] principle and people in church called
[1:02:36] him a Baptist pastor
[1:02:38] and despite surprises pastor's heart
[1:02:41] because he says you're not message
[1:02:43] enough saying you're not prophet enough.
[1:02:48] So this
[1:02:50] this attitude is a is a misunderstanding
[1:02:52] to the level of brother Fendler's
[1:02:54] misunderstanding.
[1:02:56] There's a lot of misunderstanding that
[1:02:58] it caused problem or big holes in our
[1:03:02] church where we were not allowed to
[1:03:04] apply simple principle Bible principle
[1:03:07] about family raising children making
[1:03:12] marriage stronger because it was it was
[1:03:14] called and labeled psychology
[1:03:17] and I remember many years ago when I
[1:03:19] started preach those things people were
[1:03:21] accusing me brother Steve you're trying
[1:03:23] to do the job as a psychologist I says
[1:03:25] You got it reverse.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Says before psychologist came around,
[1:03:30] who was doing that kind of job?
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; As the pastor was in charge of the
[1:03:35] flock, he was taking care of the people.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; But because the church has let down and
[1:03:40] and and now people are going for life
[1:03:43] coach and for advice and they're getting
[1:03:45] a bunch of nonsense out there, but
[1:03:47] people are seeking guidance for their
[1:03:49] soul.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; And I understand that the first guidance
[1:03:53] of the soul is to be filled with the
[1:03:54] Holy Ghost. I get that. But God also has
[1:03:57] sent pastors to help you with natural
[1:04:01] things where we should be allowed to
[1:04:04] teach teach simple principles. Yes,
[1:04:06] there's this huge prophetic the
[1:04:08] prophetic view is like the view of 13 13
[1:04:11] thou 30,000 ft. You see the old age you
[1:04:15] see before the foundation of the world.
[1:04:17] Bless your heart. It is such a blessing
[1:04:19] and we need to preach those things. It's
[1:04:21] and it's been covered abundantly I'm
[1:04:22] sure. Mhm.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; But then when we we make a close up with
[1:04:26] the same principle, we can talk about
[1:04:28] Boaz and Ruth and scale it down and
[1:04:31] bring it right in our house.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; And we need to be able to go up there
[1:04:37] and down there. But when we go too down
[1:04:39] there, I know because because I covered
[1:04:42] those topic out of a necessity necessity
[1:04:46] for me, my own family, my own five kids,
[1:04:49] my own background, my own troubled
[1:04:51] childhood sitting in a mess church,
[1:04:54] message church.
[1:04:58] When I was young, there's been a scandal
[1:04:59] in the church where men started to abuse
[1:05:02] little children, young my friends.
[1:05:06] And some of one one of them confided in
[1:05:08] me and I'm the one who talked to my mom
[1:05:11] and finally
[1:05:14] we exposed the thing. He was cast away
[1:05:16] and and all that. But we were clueless
[1:05:21] that those kids
[1:05:24] were heavily damaged. They had a whole
[1:05:27] we we were clueless that something
[1:05:30] needed to be done. Now that you got rid
[1:05:32] of this monster,
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; we thought the rest was okay.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; My own family,
[1:05:42] my own friend left and he never came
[1:05:45] back. And when when I gave my heart to
[1:05:49] the Lord, he he says he says, "I don't
[1:05:52] understand why my my my friend would
[1:05:54] return to a place where they abuse
[1:05:56] children because that's all he had in
[1:05:57] mind because it did not get resolved in
[1:06:00] his heart.
[1:06:01] And it's not because nobody cared
[1:06:03] because people were not careless. They
[1:06:05] were just clueless.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; So what I'm talking about is real life
[1:06:14] issues. It's real things that cannot
[1:06:17] it's been overlooked for too long.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; And it's not a lack of care. It's a
[1:06:24] misunderstanding
[1:06:26] of God's will for his church.
[1:06:29] We have forgot
[1:06:32] the pastoral ministry.
[1:06:35] But the prophet says
[1:06:40] even James is a pastor. And what is he
[1:06:42] talking about?
[1:06:44] He says if if if if you tell the needy,
[1:06:47] you know, I'll pray for you. He says
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; depart in peace and warm and still and
[1:06:52] you don't give him nothing.
[1:06:54] like my father-in-law sometime he was
[1:06:56] blamed like blame in Haiti because he
[1:06:57] was printing books opening churches but
[1:07:00] also sending money to orphanage and
[1:07:02] feeding the poor and some accus him well
[1:07:04] is your work a mission work or humanit
[1:07:07] like your red cross like you could just
[1:07:10] go spiritual but if you go natural
[1:07:13] you're off the word and I understand the
[1:07:15] prophet says that's money is not you
[1:07:17] don't build hospital because now the
[1:07:19] exaggeration is denomination became all
[1:07:21] about just hospital and just the natural
[1:07:23] and they lost spiritual side. But
[1:07:25] sometime we swing on one side, then we
[1:07:27] sing totally on the other side and we're
[1:07:29] supposed to left the orphan star because
[1:07:32] oh we we're going to give him a tape or
[1:07:34] we're going to give him a message book.
[1:07:36] But the Bible says if you don't give him
[1:07:38] anything. So why James is talking like
[1:07:40] that? Because he is a pastor.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; He sees the needs in the people.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Now obviously the pastor is going to
[1:07:52] preach a prophetic. Absolutely. We have
[1:07:53] such a great message,
[1:07:56] but there's there's the natural element
[1:07:59] that needs also to be covered. And so
[1:08:04] it's like a young man comes and he talks
[1:08:07] to the pastor and he says, "You know,
[1:08:08] brother, I want to get married." He
[1:08:10] talks to the pastor and I have this
[1:08:11] sister in a church I'm interested into
[1:08:13] and Lord showed me and I I listen to a
[1:08:16] tape every day and I pray and I fast and
[1:08:18] Lord showed me. And a pastor's like,
[1:08:19] "Well," and and and this young brother
[1:08:21] thinks he's going to impress the pastor
[1:08:23] because like he's so spiritual. The
[1:08:24] pastor's like, "Okay, do you have a
[1:08:26] job?"
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; No. No. But God showed me and and he
[1:08:33] wants to go spiritual. You want to go up
[1:08:35] there, but the pastor keeps him down
[1:08:36] there like, "Do you have a car?"
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; And then the brother's all offended. My
[1:08:41] sp my pastor is not spiritual. He he
[1:08:43] didn't see the spiritual vision that I
[1:08:45] have. Like you might be up. you I don't
[1:08:47] question your spiritual vision but now
[1:08:49] it needs to be manifest on this on this
[1:08:51] earth
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; we need to land this vision on earth
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; all right so
[1:09:01] probably for the sick he he maybe it
[1:09:04] reminds him of some of the experience he
[1:09:06] had giving counsel sometime to people
[1:09:08] that are so Lord God show me God show me
[1:09:11] I get it but what I see is your wife is
[1:09:13] crying
[1:09:17] And so
[1:09:19] the prophet says that
[1:09:23] the pastor is a burden bearer.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; He's the ox of the team.
[1:09:29] And what amazes me with that quote is
[1:09:31] that he says he's a man that can sit
[1:09:34] down.
[1:09:36] And that quote when he describes the
[1:09:37] pastor, he doesn't he doesn't even
[1:09:39] mention how much he preach. Obviously,
[1:09:42] we know that he preaches, but that
[1:09:44] quote, he says he sits down with
[1:09:47] families.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; He's a man that could sit down when
[1:09:50] somebody's got something against
[1:09:51] somebody else and he sit down with them
[1:09:53] two families and take it and reason it
[1:09:56] out.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Reason.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; He's using reasoning
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; and bring it back into sweetness. He's a
[1:10:03] pastor and he knows how to take care of
[1:10:05] these things.
[1:10:07] You put an evangelist between two
[1:10:09] families.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Well, he's going to apply the word,
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; but the pastor is built for that.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; So, he's the ox on the team. He's the
[1:10:20] ox. He's built for that. He sit with
[1:10:22] people. He sit with I spend more time
[1:10:24] with people
[1:10:26] than sometime
[1:10:28] the numbers of hour in the week that I
[1:10:30] spend behind the pulpit versus the
[1:10:32] number of hours I spend talking to
[1:10:35] people. I talk more with people than I
[1:10:37] stand behind the pulpit
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; because there's a real need. And and
[1:10:42] when the prophet was asking to people
[1:10:44] for interviews,
[1:10:46] he says, "How many want an interview?"
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Now the modern word for interview today
[1:10:50] is counseling. We call it counseling.
[1:10:52] The message word for counseling is
[1:10:53] interviews.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Okay? So
[1:10:57] call it counseling, call it interviews.
[1:10:59] Is the same thing. You're sitting in an
[1:11:01] office with a man of God.
[1:11:04] that try to apply the word and try to
[1:11:06] give you godly advice with what you're
[1:11:08] going through.
[1:11:10] And so the prophet said at one point he
[1:11:13] says well who don't want one because he
[1:11:15] how many wants like all the hands raised
[1:11:17] like who doesn't want one then you think
[1:11:19] well obviously everyone want to sit with
[1:11:21] the prophet but then the prophet says no
[1:11:23] every one of those needs are genuine
[1:11:24] needs and he says some of these things
[1:11:26] cannot be dealt behind the pulpit
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; so there's always so also that idea that
[1:11:32] I've heard in our ranks that every
[1:11:35] problem should be solved by the
[1:11:36] preaching of the word the preaching of
[1:11:38] the world word cast most of the spirits
[1:11:41] out and the preaching of the word ca
[1:11:43] solves a lot of problem but not all of
[1:11:46] them the prophets you can go find out I
[1:11:48] was not I didn't I didn't know I would
[1:11:50] dwell so much on that but I just follow
[1:11:52] the leaning of the lord
[1:11:54] but the prophet says he says some of
[1:11:56] those issues these about life and he
[1:11:59] says they only can be dealt in the
[1:12:01] office
[1:12:03] but he says I have too much prophet says
[1:12:05] I have and then other people will say
[1:12:06] well only the prophet could do that well
[1:12:08] again you got it wrong a lot of
[1:12:10] misunderstanding. So first of all, if
[1:12:12] there is a place that every if if there
[1:12:15] is a place on earth at one time that
[1:12:17] your problem could be solved by the
[1:12:19] preaching of the word behind the pulpit
[1:12:20] was at the Brham tabernacle sitting
[1:12:22] under brother Brham in human flesh and
[1:12:25] then he said some of those interviews
[1:12:29] could only those situation could only be
[1:12:31] fixed behind doors where we can have an
[1:12:35] open discussion.
[1:12:36] So the preaching of the word behind the
[1:12:38] pulpit doesn't sol the prophet says he
[1:12:40] said it doesn't solve every situation
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; and then this idea that only the prophet
[1:12:46] could do it since he passed away now
[1:12:48] only the preaching can solve the prophet
[1:12:51] when at the end of his ministry he says
[1:12:53] I'm he says I cannot do interviews
[1:12:54] anymore but he says there is ministers
[1:12:57] sitting here he says that can help and
[1:12:59] then he names minister that are sitting
[1:13:01] here he says go see those brother they
[1:13:03] believe the message and there's as
[1:13:05] qualified as me to do it. Obviously, we
[1:13:08] know the prophet had vision. You would
[1:13:09] know before you enter the office. He had
[1:13:11] the answer. I wish I had that sometime.
[1:13:15] For many years, I thought I wish I had
[1:13:16] that. But again, sometime gifts in the
[1:13:18] church can help for that. But
[1:13:21] but so the prophet is pointing at men of
[1:13:24] God in the church and he says, "They're
[1:13:25] going to help me." And Moses reached
[1:13:27] that point sometime in his life where
[1:13:29] the burden was too much for him because
[1:13:31] he spent so many hours sitting with
[1:13:34] people trying to help them. God didn't
[1:13:36] say, "Well, quit counseling. Those
[1:13:38] people are stubborn." No. God said, "Now
[1:13:40] find 70 people
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; because there is needs in the body of
[1:13:46] Christ." Right.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; And
[1:13:57] so as you see tonight before we start
[1:13:59] addressing the families and marriage,
[1:14:03] I'm addressing
[1:14:05] the misunderstandings.
[1:14:08] And those misunderstanding, I found them
[1:14:11] everywhere I go. Even though I don't
[1:14:12] know you, I found them
[1:14:16] in India. I find them in New Zealand. I
[1:14:18] found them across. There is if you want
[1:14:21] to understand those, you listen to
[1:14:22] question and answers.
[1:14:25] Especially one in 64. The four message
[1:14:27] in 64
[1:14:29] almost all those questions became a
[1:14:32] false doctrine later. Even though he
[1:14:34] answered black and white,
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; it became later on something that people
[1:14:38] kept believing. It's kind of unique. It
[1:14:41] seems it shows that spirits don't die.
[1:14:45] Now, another misunderstanding is that
[1:14:50] because you're born again and you're a
[1:14:51] new creature and believe that that God's
[1:14:55] will to will totally ignore your natural
[1:14:59] side.
[1:15:02] And there's a quote here where the
[1:15:04] prophet would give an advice to someone
[1:15:07] based on its nature.
[1:15:10] Not just saying, well, you're new.
[1:15:12] You're the word of God said this and and
[1:15:14] like we don't care. I apply the word.
[1:15:17] So, um, I'm going to read you this quote
[1:15:20] and then you're going to see how the
[1:15:21] prophet would would approach those
[1:15:23] things. He says, "I found someone,
[1:15:24] excuse me, in the interview this
[1:15:26] morning." So, it's in interviews or
[1:15:28] counseling that I realized that a person
[1:15:31] uh had a question about a genuine
[1:15:33] person, a real person. They live right
[1:15:35] and they've heard me say the evidence of
[1:15:37] the Holy Ghost wasn't speaking in tongue
[1:15:39] and is and it it isn't. But I advise
[1:15:41] that person to ask God to let them
[1:15:43] either speak in tongue or prophesy
[1:15:45] because it's the nature.
[1:15:48] The first thing I went to that person
[1:15:50] and found their birthplace and what sign
[1:15:53] that they were born under and I could
[1:15:55] tell what their birth was and which way
[1:15:58] is set in their natural nature sets them
[1:16:00] in a certain line.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Then when they're reborn again they're
[1:16:05] over here in that other nature.
[1:16:08] And when you find into this nature
[1:16:10] that's in conscious inside conscience
[1:16:13] but the outside conscious moves you in a
[1:16:15] one way. That's your natural birth. And
[1:16:18] then they'll make up something and and
[1:16:19] it puts them what? Under four. And it
[1:16:21] puts them in a split condition. They
[1:16:24] don't know what to do. They'll say, "The
[1:16:25] Lord wants me to do this." So the
[1:16:27] prophet realized that if you're born a
[1:16:29] certain way, you lean a certain way, but
[1:16:30] then your new birth make you lean in
[1:16:32] another way. And I'm not talking mean
[1:16:33] leaning on a sinful way. Just leaning in
[1:16:35] a certain way the way your makeup is.
[1:16:37] And so for that person, she was probably
[1:16:40] somebody and I don't know, but the
[1:16:41] prophet would go as far as your
[1:16:42] birthplace under what sign
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; to try to determine
[1:16:48] who are you and what's your nature. Then
[1:16:52] he could understand that's why you have
[1:16:54] a question like this and then he would
[1:16:57] give an advice. I'm wondering how many
[1:16:59] pastor could stand up and say well I I
[1:17:02] advised that person to pray the speaking
[1:17:04] tongue. Well, the prophet condemned the
[1:17:06] thing.
[1:17:08] He gave an advice that looked contrary
[1:17:11] to his teaching.
[1:17:14] Why?
[1:17:15] Because he could discern the nature and
[1:17:18] the need of that person. And he says,
[1:17:20] "My advice for her is to let he said ask
[1:17:23] the Lord to let you do it because you're
[1:17:25] built a certain way." So maybe that
[1:17:27] person is a practical person, whatever
[1:17:29] she needed.
[1:17:31] The prophet when he did interviews is is
[1:17:35] is like in a pastoral role
[1:17:38] and he have a tailor made
[1:17:42] counsel to that person to help them with
[1:17:45] their
[1:17:47] to harmonize their nature and that
[1:17:52] spiritual birth and the natural side of
[1:17:55] it.
[1:17:56] And the prophet could do those things
[1:17:58] because he said it's been one of the mo
[1:18:01] most amazing thing that I have noticed
[1:18:03] along the lines of my ministry for the
[1:18:05] Lord Jesus is the peculiarity of people
[1:18:09] and the study of human life is one of
[1:18:12] the greatest things that a person can
[1:18:14] study to watch nature of people. So the
[1:18:19] prophet was not only interested in
[1:18:22] supernatural and spiritual thing but he
[1:18:24] says one of the greatest study you can
[1:18:25] have is also to study human nature or
[1:18:28] human life so you can understand how
[1:18:30] people are different and they're built
[1:18:32] different way
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; and so when you sit with them you
[1:18:36] understand where they come from what
[1:18:37] kind of background
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; that's why before I started tonight I
[1:18:41] gave you my background now you know why
[1:18:43] I take those things at heart
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; because my background is I'm a a and a
[1:18:48] kid that was abandoned by his father,
[1:18:50] raised alone
[1:18:53] and many other things I'm skipping. But
[1:18:57] we were built a certain way and for many
[1:19:00] years I wondered Lord why why my father
[1:19:03] abandoned you? Why I was raised like why
[1:19:04] I couldn't have like a normal family
[1:19:06] like my wife? My wife was raised with
[1:19:08] mother sister Suzanne you know five kids
[1:19:11] and godly home. I was raised in a godly
[1:19:14] home. It says my mother was a Christian.
[1:19:15] And by the way, my mother after she
[1:19:17] backslid, I left one year later and I
[1:19:20] spent four years in the world. When I
[1:19:22] came back, I was 21 years old. When I
[1:19:24] came back to the Lord, I was on fire.
[1:19:26] And one year after I started preaching,
[1:19:27] I was 22 in 1999.
[1:19:30] And my mom never missed one sermon. She
[1:19:33] was she was in the world, but every time
[1:19:34] I preached, she showed up in church
[1:19:36] until I I brought her back to the Lord.
[1:19:38] And now she's in our church and serving
[1:19:40] God and being happy. But we we went to
[1:19:43] through some some tough time. And I was
[1:19:45] I was I was I was feeling like a victim
[1:19:48] for many years until God showed me. He
[1:19:50] says, "Do you see where when you preach
[1:19:52] on those things who comes to see you
[1:19:55] after the service?" I remember South
[1:19:57] Africa. I preach Johannesburg and I I
[1:19:59] touch a little bit on those things. And
[1:20:01] after there was a thousand people,
[1:20:02] there's a big family camp. And after the
[1:20:04] service, who do you guess who was coming
[1:20:07] see me after the service? It was those
[1:20:08] fatherless.
[1:20:10] those sons fireless that came to me
[1:20:12] says, "Brother Steve, you're the first
[1:20:13] man of God I hear talk about these
[1:20:15] things. I don't feel alone anymore." And
[1:20:17] I was in India the other day and I had
[1:20:19] orphans sitting there because where I
[1:20:21] preached, brother Samuel Kotraad
[1:20:23] uh it used to be an orphanage. So
[1:20:25] there's many orphans sitting there and
[1:20:27] as I sharing my testimony and and and
[1:20:29] their life is changing and they come to
[1:20:31] see me after you're touching there's
[1:20:34] many people sitting in churches with
[1:20:36] different horizon who are not coming
[1:20:38] from the same mold.
[1:20:42] And so that's why God is is asking and
[1:20:45] he's talking to shepherds.
[1:20:48] Shepherds are pasture. And he says,
[1:20:50] "Thus said the Lord, woe to be shepherds
[1:20:52] that do not feed them that do feed
[1:20:55] themselves. As should not the shepherds
[1:20:57] feed the flock. Ye eat the fat and ye
[1:21:00] clothe with the wool. Ye kill them or
[1:21:01] that are fed, but ye feed not the
[1:21:03] flock." Then feed we know feed. We we
[1:21:06] preach the word. I fed the word of the
[1:21:07] hour. It's awesome. But verse four says,
[1:21:10] "The disease have ye not strengthened,
[1:21:13] neither have ye healed that which was
[1:21:15] sick, neither have ye bound up which was
[1:21:18] broken,
[1:21:20] neither have ye brought up again that
[1:21:21] which was driven away, neither have ye
[1:21:23] sought which was lost, but with force
[1:21:25] and cruelty have you ruled them." And so
[1:21:28] God is frustrated with shepherd that
[1:21:31] that that that we're doing half of their
[1:21:33] their feeding or not feeding or not
[1:21:36] taking care.
[1:21:39] So God God is a is is a God who and and
[1:21:44] I told I told I remember not long after
[1:21:47] I became the pastor I sat with the
[1:21:48] deacon board and I said brother I said I
[1:21:51] said you need to understand you deacons
[1:21:53] and me sheeps are more important than
[1:21:56] the pastor and the deacons because we
[1:21:58] were sent towards the sheep sometime we
[1:22:02] just view the authority of
[1:22:05] but the authority of is to be able to
[1:22:07] lead. Yes, but God want us to take care
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; of the flock. And the same thing for the
[1:22:14] father. The father is the head. And
[1:22:17] sometime he's the head means he's the
[1:22:19] boss. So he decides and he doesn't care.
[1:22:21] But but but the Bible is clear. We have
[1:22:24] to love our families as we love oursel.
[1:22:28] So it's also related to your
[1:22:29] self-esteem.
[1:22:32] Do do you take care of your own self?
[1:22:37] Amen.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; And so when I approached pastoring,
[1:22:46] that's what I had in my mind. Lord, I'm
[1:22:48] going to take care of you people. You're
[1:22:49] going to take care of my family. And
[1:22:51] right away, God says, "No, no, you got
[1:22:54] it all wrong." And when I saw the tears
[1:22:57] in my wife's eyes, saying, "I don't want
[1:23:00] my children to lose their father."
[1:23:03] And it says, "Wow."
[1:23:06] Okay, that that that that got me
[1:23:09] thinking.
[1:23:10] Then I realized, okay, we have a we have
[1:23:12] a challenge here.
[1:23:14] We have a challenge.
[1:23:17] And so not to be not to be critical as I
[1:23:22] said this is how
[1:23:25] I would say difficult
[1:23:28] and challenging the mentality the
[1:23:31] message mentality that I was raised in.
[1:23:34] It had consequences
[1:23:36] in my generation. My generation in my
[1:23:39] church when I was young when we were
[1:23:41] teenagers we all went in the world.
[1:23:45] We have the greatest message
[1:23:48] and then
[1:23:51] we all left
[1:23:54] and I don't think we have time tonight
[1:23:55] because the time is already run so we
[1:23:58] might enter into this tomorrow morning
[1:24:02] but we going to we going to study again
[1:24:05] not based my opinion or based on a
[1:24:08] psychology book but based on quotes.
[1:24:11] We're going to study tomorrow morning
[1:24:13] why
[1:24:14] does people leave.
[1:24:16] We're going to study why our teenager
[1:24:20] leaves.
[1:24:21] We're going to get it straight.
[1:24:24] The sometime we're like it it's it's
[1:24:27] we're like
[1:24:31] a teenager's runaway and we're like oh
[1:24:34] my goodness he left. It's like something
[1:24:37] that it happened overnight. It didn't
[1:24:39] happen overnight.
[1:24:41] Before it was transferred into the
[1:24:42] physical realm, something inside was not
[1:24:44] going. Not at all.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Or uh one of the one of the spouse
[1:24:51] husband or wife files for divorce. It's
[1:24:53] like, well, I don't get it. It was our
[1:24:55] wedding anniversary last week and he
[1:24:56] bought me flowers and then he I received
[1:24:58] the p lawyers paper this week. It's like
[1:25:01] it happened suddenly. No, no, no.
[1:25:04] We're going to study how from the inside
[1:25:07] something start changing and nobody
[1:25:09] notice it. And if we don't watch for
[1:25:12] these things and don't ask the right
[1:25:13] question, we realize there's trouble in
[1:25:16] the house when it's almost too late. Not
[1:25:18] too late on the long term, but too late
[1:25:21] on the short term.
[1:25:23] And then we wake up and then we want to
[1:25:26] and as I as I went, you know, with my
[1:25:29] and also we're gonna study brother
[1:25:31] Brandham's
[1:25:33] reaction maybe, Lord willing, tomorrow
[1:25:35] night and I I'm not trying to set up
[1:25:37] something. We're going to see how the
[1:25:38] Lord leads but because I got so much I
[1:25:40] could we could preach every night for
[1:25:42] the rest of keep you one week and I got
[1:25:45] I've preached so much on that but so I'm
[1:25:47] trying just to concise and like to do a
[1:25:50] power pack in three meetings. Okay.
[1:25:53] But the prophet went through the same
[1:25:54] thing with Rebecca when she was 18 when
[1:25:56] she starts slamming doors. Prophet says,
[1:25:58] "Okay, we got a problem. She's slamming
[1:26:01] doors and then it it started a chain
[1:26:04] reaction and there's so much to learn
[1:26:06] and and I think it's seven seven or
[1:26:08] eight paragraphs. Prophet told the whole
[1:26:10] story and every details and how it got
[1:26:12] solved." So we read the quote, but we we
[1:26:15] were going to do an indepth analysis of
[1:26:18] that quote and every steps that brother
[1:26:21] Brandham took in every change. I used to
[1:26:23] do this. Now we won't do this anymore. I
[1:26:25] I thought this way now I get I got to
[1:26:27] change the way and he changed and he
[1:26:28] changed and the one who changed the most
[1:26:32] in the three brother Brandham his wife
[1:26:34] and Rebecca it's the parents who changed
[1:26:37] the most and it's in the quote. It is
[1:26:40] there but it's been overlooked. We read
[1:26:43] these as little stories, but these are
[1:26:47] awesome, great lesson. And when we apply
[1:26:50] those things, we get great benefit.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; But most of the time, it's been
[1:26:56] overlooked as a little side story
[1:27:00] because we want the meat of the word. We
[1:27:02] want the the seals and we want, you
[1:27:04] know, God and the unveiling of God and
[1:27:06] who is this MelzDC and and those things
[1:27:09] are great. And so when he tells a story
[1:27:11] about Rebecca, we're like, "Oh, yeah.
[1:27:12] This is a little side note, you know,
[1:27:14] let's go back to Melzdc."
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Well, because Melzdc wants you to
[1:27:21] understand
[1:27:22] that you need how to solve your your
[1:27:24] your things at home.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; In those principle, I start after three
[1:27:31] kids. I had to wake up because I was I
[1:27:36] was having it wrong. Totally wrong.
[1:27:39] If if if I if how I started my three
[1:27:42] firsts,
[1:27:44] if I kept this way, I think all my kids
[1:27:46] would be in the world right now. I was
[1:27:49] heading the wrong way. It has nothing to
[1:27:52] do with their salvation. It has nothing
[1:27:53] to do with eternal life. But I would
[1:27:55] have sent them on the wrong path and
[1:27:57] they would have to learn the hard way
[1:27:58] and then come back.
[1:28:01] But there's and so
[1:28:04] I have five. So I have I have William as
[1:28:07] a boy and I got four girls. And four
[1:28:09] girls, they're all different. We think
[1:28:10] sometime boys and girls and that's all.
[1:28:12] It's there's two too kind. No, no.
[1:28:14] Everyone is a kind.
[1:28:17] And the challenge of being a father and
[1:28:20] and to follow your kids without being
[1:28:24] overwhelming controlling, it's being
[1:28:27] more like overwhelming caring.
[1:28:30] And there's a difference between
[1:28:31] controlling and caring.
[1:28:34] And how does the free moral agency plays
[1:28:37] into that?
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; You're going to see that when brother
[1:28:39] Brandham had problems with Rebecca when
[1:28:41] she was two years old and when she was
[1:28:43] 18, he use a totally different approach.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Totally different approach because at
[1:28:48] two, there's no free will.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; At two, you're the one who take control
[1:28:53] of the spirit.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; At 18, she has a rebellious spirit and
[1:28:56] slamming door. You cannot really cast
[1:28:58] that spirit out if she feeds the thing.
[1:29:01] you have to solve why it does she needs
[1:29:03] that spirit.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; That's a different question.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; So, because we've we've used a lot of
[1:29:10] time tonight, I don't know. I don't I
[1:29:12] lost track of time, so I I don't know
[1:29:14] where I'm at right now. But but
[1:29:16] tomorrow, we're going to we're going to
[1:29:18] we're going to study just the
[1:29:20] relationship of the relation between
[1:29:22] it's a chain of effect. It's a series of
[1:29:25] event that happen. And we're going to go
[1:29:27] back to the Genesis. We're going to go
[1:29:29] back to the garden of Eden which we call
[1:29:31] the season of innocence. And we all had
[1:29:33] in our life at one point a season of
[1:29:35] innocence. And that season of innocence,
[1:29:37] you thought life would be great. There
[1:29:39] is no pain. Nobody's dangerous. Nobody's
[1:29:42] evil. Everything is good. I live in a
[1:29:44] perfect world and my family is perfect.
[1:29:46] Season of innocence. And the devil wants
[1:29:48] to come and wreck that in a in the most
[1:29:52] fear fearful forceful way to traumatize
[1:29:56] you in a such a way to break you in such
[1:29:59] a way that you to that that it it you
[1:30:03] know the prophet says that the devil is
[1:30:04] allowed a blow in your life.
[1:30:07] Well, he wants to break that season of
[1:30:10] innocence to make you somebody bitter
[1:30:14] and some life would experience sometimes
[1:30:16] some of you is going to recall painful
[1:30:18] thing. It might it might be at one point
[1:30:20] during the the weekend you might you
[1:30:23] might experience some oh my goodness I
[1:30:25] forgot about that. But I want you to
[1:30:27] know there's a place you can run into
[1:30:29] tonight or tomorrow or this weekend. you
[1:30:33] can bring those forgotten burdens which
[1:30:36] the prophet says are laying in the
[1:30:38] subconscious.
[1:30:39] That's another thing we'll try to cover
[1:30:41] just a little bit but it's a whole
[1:30:43] sermon two ser full sermons if you
[1:30:45] preach just only on the subconscious
[1:30:47] prophet talk about that says that's your
[1:30:50] worst enemy the guy in there that he
[1:30:52] controls the if he says no it's no
[1:30:55] you think oh praise the lord I'm going
[1:30:56] to I'm going to do this when I'm going
[1:30:58] to get married I'm going to do this when
[1:30:59] I get married I'm going to do that you
[1:31:01] get married you do nothing of that why
[1:31:03] there's somebody inside says no why does
[1:31:05] he say no because well some somewhere
[1:31:07] somewhere something happen.
[1:31:12] And so that's why the prophet says in
[1:31:14] the greatest battle ever fought, he says
[1:31:15] you need to clean those channels, the
[1:31:18] channels of memory, the channels of
[1:31:19] affection, which is emotion, the seat of
[1:31:22] imagination, those he says that's why
[1:31:24] there's so many blow up Christians
[1:31:26] because they don't clean those channels.
[1:31:30] So sometime we think because we're
[1:31:31] Christian, well, it doesn't matter. It's
[1:31:33] all in the sea of forgetfulness. A lot
[1:31:34] of people think it's the sea of
[1:31:35] forgetfulness, but it's not forgotten at
[1:31:37] all. It's just put on the shelf and when
[1:31:39] the shelf is full, it cracks.
[1:31:42] And the prophet says, "This why we have
[1:31:43] so many blow up Christians
[1:31:46] because we don't clean the channels."
[1:31:49] And so when we don't clean the channels,
[1:31:51] it has a chain of effect until we blow
[1:31:53] up. And when we blow up, it causes
[1:31:55] damage to us. If a father blow up, if a
[1:31:58] mother blow up, the impact is on all the
[1:32:01] church. When the pastors blow up,
[1:32:02] there's impact everywhere.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we need really we need the
[1:32:07] grace of God. And so, we're going to try
[1:32:10] to cover a little bit this tomorrow
[1:32:11] morning and from there we're going to
[1:32:13] see how how the Lord leads. And so, I
[1:32:16] realize tonight we stay mostly on on on
[1:32:18] the on the big bigger picture of what is
[1:32:22] our belief system that we have
[1:32:24] developed. And and and we need to we
[1:32:28] really need we really need the the grace
[1:32:30] of God to understand that those simple
[1:32:34] things they're simple principles
[1:32:37] are allowed to be preached in a church
[1:32:39] because God cares about those those
[1:32:42] little things and God cares for these
[1:32:45] things. Amen. Let's bow our head. for
[1:32:47] Jesus.
[1:32:50] It's just Lord just an almost like an
[1:32:53] opening statement.
[1:32:56] There is so much Lord to
[1:32:59] to tackle.
[1:33:01] Well, I hope Lord that it it gives a
[1:33:03] little bit of a greater understanding of
[1:33:06] the misunderstanding.
[1:33:09] There's been a misunderstanding Lord I
[1:33:11] feel in many places. I don't know about
[1:33:13] here Lord but I know many places
[1:33:18] we really got excited Lord because a
[1:33:20] prophet came but then we saw Lord and we
[1:33:24] were seeing the climax of that
[1:33:25] exaggeration these days where even
[1:33:28] church and pastors and five-fold
[1:33:30] ministry everything got true outside the
[1:33:32] window because they are prophet only
[1:33:37] but Lord we see there's many levels of
[1:33:39] that deity spirit
[1:33:43] that are crippling our church and
[1:33:46] that are crippling the pastor's ministry
[1:33:49] where he's not allowed to be
[1:33:52] a simple pastor who can also teach
[1:33:54] simple principles.
[1:33:57] It'll be labeled that he doesn't preach
[1:33:59] the meat and he's not deep enough and we
[1:34:02] don't want to hear about family things.
[1:34:04] And
[1:34:06] [Music]
[1:34:08] even the disciples like send the kids
[1:34:10] away. Don't let the kids bother Jesus.
[1:34:13] And Jesus is like, "No, you don't get
[1:34:16] it." What a misunderstanding. What did
[1:34:19] they had in mind? They thought Jesus not
[1:34:21] interested in kids. He says, "Let it let
[1:34:24] those children come. You don't get it.
[1:34:26] You don't get it, do you? Unless you
[1:34:29] unless you're like them, you're going to
[1:34:31] miss it."
[1:34:33] And the prophet has warned us, don't
[1:34:35] change anything.
[1:34:38] Brother Neville was such a simple man.
[1:34:41] Such a simple man. When the prophet
[1:34:42] passed away, they got rid of him.
[1:34:46] I guess he was not deep enough.
[1:34:49] Preaching on malnutrition.
[1:34:53] Obviously, they got rid of him.
[1:34:56] And that happened many places, Lord.
[1:34:59] They got rid of simple pastor who wanted
[1:35:01] to lead the flock in simplicity.
[1:35:06] Cuz all what people wanted to hear is
[1:35:08] the deep things of God. and to meet
[1:35:12] and we appreciate those things. Lord,
[1:35:16] but Lord, I feel in my heart it's time
[1:35:18] to look and see, have we forgot
[1:35:22] something?
[1:35:25] When we see our children walking away,
[1:35:28] when we see divorce rates in our
[1:35:30] churches going high,
[1:35:34] it's the condition of the time. Yes,
[1:35:36] Lord. But
[1:35:38] is there something we could have done
[1:35:40] differently?
[1:35:42] Have we fed? Have we preached a whole
[1:35:46] council of God?
[1:35:48] Lord, you said you came to heal the
[1:35:50] brokenhearted,
[1:35:52] the wounded in spirit,
[1:35:56] but Lord, we don't know what to do with
[1:35:58] them. We don't know what to tell them.
[1:36:01] We don't understand human nature.
[1:36:05] Teach us Lord.
[1:36:09] Teach us Lord to be able to take care of
[1:36:11] our wives to to listen. When the prophet
[1:36:15] went through that season, Rebecca, he
[1:36:17] said, "We need to think 18 years old
[1:36:20] thoughts." He realized he was thinking
[1:36:23] like an adults. Well, I never wanted her
[1:36:26] to get married. No wonder she's slamming
[1:36:29] doors. Then he says, "I got to think 18
[1:36:33] years old. She need a friend.
[1:36:36] And when he landed in his own house, he
[1:36:38] realized
[1:36:41] he realized his daughter that slamming
[1:36:43] doors and look like she's rebellious.
[1:36:46] She needed something and then he saw it.
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:53] If Moses went through that, if if
[1:36:56] brother Brandham in a certain way went
[1:36:57] through that with Rebecca and Billy
[1:36:59] Paul, Lord, what about us?
[1:37:02] Lord, forgive us, Lord. We have
[1:37:04] overlooked those things sometime. We got
[1:37:07] caught up, Lord, and and got excited,
[1:37:10] Lord. And it's all okay, Lord. We're not
[1:37:12] here to blame tonight. We We want to
[1:37:14] remember the rules that the opening of
[1:37:16] the church, this is not a blaming. I
[1:37:18] told the church, it was really
[1:37:20] sensitive,
[1:37:21] but it comes from a it comes from a a
[1:37:24] heart that doesn't want to blame anyone.
[1:37:31] I was heading on such a wrong path,
[1:37:33] Lord.
[1:37:36] And when I saw the sadness in my son's
[1:37:38] eyes, when I saw the question mark in my
[1:37:42] third child looking at me, not
[1:37:44] understanding why I was so
[1:37:47] such a bad father.
[1:37:50] Those kids questions, they had no
[1:37:52] malice. But I could see in their eyes,
[1:37:54] they were confused. Why? Why are we
[1:37:56] afraid of dad?
[1:37:59] Why am I afraid of dad?
[1:38:02] And when I saw the fear in their eyes,
[1:38:04] they were afraid of me. I knew I was
[1:38:06] wrong.
[1:38:08] I love the Lord. And I I saw the pillar
[1:38:10] of fire in my life. I I I had
[1:38:13] supernatural experience and I was
[1:38:14] preaching and the Holy Ghost was falling
[1:38:16] and there was converts and I would pray
[1:38:19] for people. But when I got home, it was
[1:38:21] not working.
[1:38:25] And my I was troubled my heart. Lord,
[1:38:27] how can it be, Lord, that I am so
[1:38:29] blessed in your presence, but my
[1:38:31] children are afraid of me?
[1:38:35] But you heard my cry, Lord.
[1:38:40] Lord, I didn't want to repeat
[1:38:44] the mistake of the other generation.
[1:38:48] Help us, Lord. We need your grace. We
[1:38:51] need to be humble, Lord. You've humbled
[1:38:54] me.
[1:38:56] So, see if you need to learn everything
[1:38:58] and you need to unlearn the ways how the
[1:39:02] Bisson the Bryson how they do it is all
[1:39:04] bad. They all they got it all wrong. I I
[1:39:07] used to be proud Lord of how our
[1:39:09] families raise children.
[1:39:11] Why did I forgot that I was miserable
[1:39:13] when I was young?
[1:39:17] I didn't like it, but I was doing it the
[1:39:18] same way.
[1:39:22] Lord, if we walk with you, you're going
[1:39:24] to show us your way. I pray, Lord, that
[1:39:28] you inspire this church. You inspire the
[1:39:31] fathers because it starts with them.
[1:39:34] They have to set the tone. They have to
[1:39:37] set the atmosphere in their house. It
[1:39:39] starts with them.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, it also starts with the sets of
[1:39:45] belief that we have.
[1:39:49] Open our eyes tonight, I pray.
[1:39:52] in Jesus name.
[1:39:55] Amen.
[1:39:57] Amen.
[1:40:00] May the Lord bless you. I know I know
[1:40:02] these are not easy things to bring, but
[1:40:05] it comes from a
[1:40:07] it comes from a sincere heart, out of a
[1:40:09] out of a burden, out of a out of a cry.
[1:40:13] And
[1:40:16] I just want to say how much I love you
[1:40:19] and I wish I want the best of I I have
[1:40:23] the privilege for now of not knowing you
[1:40:26] which is better now tonight cuz I'm
[1:40:28] clueless about what this church went
[1:40:31] through whatever I I have no clue. So it
[1:40:34] gives me just the freedom just to open
[1:40:35] my heart.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; But don't take it as an attack or
[1:40:38] blaming. I am not. I I hope you feel the
[1:40:41] atmosphere.
[1:40:42] We I you know one day my son told me he
[1:40:45] says, "Daddy, I want to be like you." I
[1:40:47] says, "You don't want to be like you.
[1:40:49] You want to do better than me.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; I've tried to I've tried to fix the
[1:40:55] things I've learned from I do what the
[1:40:58] Lord showed me and and tried to raise
[1:41:01] the standard higher in the way." But it
[1:41:03] says, "You take it from there and you do
[1:41:05] an even better job." Oh yeah.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; That should be if we're not competing.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; I was talking to our first pastor.
[1:41:14] [Music]
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Brother Steve," he said,
[1:41:19] he says, "I hear you preach." And he
[1:41:20] says, "Never in the world I would have
[1:41:22] bring those things." And he says, "Never
[1:41:25] I would be able to preach like you." And
[1:41:26] he had like a complex. And he keep
[1:41:28] repeating that and it bothered me. I
[1:41:30] said, "You don't get it, brother." I
[1:41:32] said I said the reason I'm preaching
[1:41:35] like that is because in 1970 and 1980s
[1:41:38] you fought and you open a way when there
[1:41:41] was no way. There was it was it was all
[1:41:44] the while you you so you had you had
[1:41:46] your big chainsaw and you cut the trees
[1:41:48] and and now we are able to walk and
[1:41:50] refined it
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; because you you did the the heavy
[1:41:55] lifting.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Now we can think about think about those
[1:41:59] things. Amen.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; I told him I said we have where I live,
[1:42:04] we have, you know, the snowmobile
[1:42:06] Bombardier BRP. They're built right
[1:42:08] right in my neighborhood.
[1:42:11] I said, Bombardier, the guy who invented
[1:42:14] snowmobile,
[1:42:16] I said, did you see the snowmobile then?
[1:42:18] How it looked like and the snowmobile
[1:42:21] how it looks today? I mean, it's such
[1:42:23] stronger, faster, more agile. This I
[1:42:26] mean there we cannot compare. But it
[1:42:27] says, what do you think? Do you think
[1:42:29] that Bombardier that the engineer today
[1:42:31] do you think they're smarter and better
[1:42:34] engineer than Bombardier was because the
[1:42:36] machine is built today is so much
[1:42:38] better? He says, "Oh, no, not at all."
[1:42:40] And he started bragging about
[1:42:41] Bombardier.
[1:42:43] Well, I says, "You are Bombardier."
[1:42:46] And when I said that, he started crying.
[1:42:48] Then he got it. He says, "Oh, I get it."
[1:42:50] Yeah. There was no snowmobile. He made
[1:42:54] one. It's easy to take this and then
[1:42:56] bring it to the other level
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; and so take it take it as that there's
[1:43:01] it should be that other ministry God
[1:43:03] rise up they're going to take the flame
[1:43:05] or the torch and they're going to bring
[1:43:07] it higher not because they're better
[1:43:08] it's because we have the privilege to
[1:43:10] take it from here instead of take it
[1:43:12] from there.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; So there's no thought that this
[1:43:16] generation is better. We are just we're
[1:43:18] just taking you know how do you call it
[1:43:20] the race the relay race. for taking the
[1:43:22] baton and and we run with it.
[1:43:25] Hallelujah. May the Lord bless you.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Moses,
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:41] That's it.
[1:43:43] A red
[1:43:45] like me.
[1:43:50] I once
[1:43:52] was lost,
[1:43:54] but now
[1:43:59] was found,
[1:44:01] but now
[1:44:03] I see.
[1:44:08] was grace
[1:44:10] that taught
[1:44:12] my heart
[1:44:14] to
[1:44:17] grace
[1:44:19] my fears.
[1:44:22] [Music]

[1:44:28] the
[1:44:30] thy grace

[1:44:47] angels.

[1:44:51] [Music]
[1:44:55] rain.
[1:45:01] His grace
[1:45:04] has brought
[1:45:07] [Music]
[1:45:16] [Music]
[1:45:32] as the sun.

[1:45:41] to sing
[1:45:43] God's praise.

[1:47:54] [Music]
[1:47:58] to be like.
[1:48:01] [Music]
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Is that the desire of your heart
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; to be more like Jesus Christ? Amen. Did
[1:48:08] you like the sermon this evening?
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Wasn't it just wonderful?
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Thank God for that. Thank you, brother
[1:48:15] Steve. God bless you richly.
[1:48:18] That exactly what you know, I was just
[1:48:21] thinking about it. You know we can't um
[1:48:24] we can't put God in a box
[1:48:27] you know even in a theme like we said
[1:48:29] okay we'll be on the theme like that but
[1:48:31] God took it in a certain angle but we
[1:48:35] could not expect it will go in that
[1:48:36] angle but no matter how
[1:48:40] even it went that angle we still say God
[1:48:43] thank you thank you you know our needs
[1:48:45] you know what we have need and u
[1:48:50] maybe as a pastor of the church. I say
[1:48:53] okay um was it directed to the pastor
[1:48:56] only? I don't think so.
[1:48:59] I think it's for each and every one of
[1:49:01] us.
[1:49:03] The mother has a she's a pastor of a
[1:49:05] certain church. She's a ministry upon
[1:49:08] our church. It's good mother to you
[1:49:11] spend spend a lot of time with your
[1:49:14] children that interview your children
[1:49:17] because you talk with them the friend
[1:49:19] that interview it's important bring that
[1:49:22] to the level of a of a local church in
[1:49:26] your house. So okay I will I give
[1:49:28] sometimes I'm give advices I preach I'm
[1:49:31] an evangelist you have to do this this
[1:49:33] but certain time no just okay let have
[1:49:35] an interview is everything fine is
[1:49:38] everything good
[1:49:40] same thing for the husband you are a
[1:49:42] pastor can give too many orders and be
[1:49:46] an evangelist or be a a prophet
[1:49:50] but there's a time we have to come down
[1:49:52] and
[1:49:54] and create that relationship ship, that
[1:49:57] friendship with your wife, with your
[1:50:00] children.
[1:50:01] Amen.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Same thing for the pastor. It's not God
[1:50:06] help me. Not just a pastor here. I'm a
[1:50:09] pastor. I have a title and everything.
[1:50:12] People respect me. Pastor,
[1:50:15] I like that that quote. You are more
[1:50:17] important than the pastor. God, brother
[1:50:21] Bam. God was so hard on brother Ban. so
[1:50:25] hard on brother Bana. Why? Because of
[1:50:29] because of us.
[1:50:32] Brother Bana had to suffer a lot because
[1:50:34] God want the bride to receive the purity
[1:50:38] of the word without any man ideas.
[1:50:43] You show how important God cares for us.
[1:50:46] Same thing. God cares for you more than
[1:50:48] than myself.
[1:50:50] And may God help us to have that
[1:50:51] attitude. Amen. just say
[1:50:55] I want to be a pastor for my church. I
[1:50:57] want to be a pastor for my family. I
[1:50:59] want I want to have that caring bear
[1:51:02] care bearing of burden burden bearer
[1:51:07] for my family. Amen. Can can we do that?
[1:51:10] Can we have a Lord help me to become a
[1:51:13] better pastor in my church in my family?
[1:51:15] Help me to become a better pastor in my
[1:51:18] family.
[1:51:19] Not only when things
[1:51:22] I was saying I like the way you put it.
[1:51:24] Not only when things go wrong
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; then you wake up before they get wrong.
[1:51:31] Spend already the time when things seem
[1:51:33] okay on the surface. Spend time spend
[1:51:37] time with your family. Spend time with
[1:51:39] your family. Very important because a
[1:51:42] strong church
[1:51:45] can only have a strong church if you
[1:51:46] have strong families.
[1:51:49] We can't we can't we we can't rely on on
[1:51:54] people who testify today and tomorrow
[1:51:56] they leave the church. How many people
[1:51:58] have visited this church? We have seen
[1:52:00] so many visitors. Do they make this
[1:52:02] church? No. What makes this church is
[1:52:05] those few stable people
[1:52:09] sometimes empty church sometimes. Today
[1:52:11] we are privileged to have uh many
[1:52:14] visitors but those those few people on
[1:52:17] the corner here that's what make the
[1:52:19] church those pillars there
[1:52:23] how much more we need to become even
[1:52:25] better stable families
[1:52:28] oh god I it just break my heart just
[1:52:32] break my heart because um I'm a family
[1:52:35] person too and um a little bit like him
[1:52:39] I was privileged to be raised in in a
[1:52:41] family
[1:52:43] far from my father but um but I was in a
[1:52:47] good family. Caleb's uh parents were
[1:52:49] good good thank God good good parents to
[1:52:52] me they raised me very good very good
[1:52:55] parents and they brought me to the
[1:52:56] message very good I'm privileged that I
[1:52:59] was raised in the right way and they
[1:53:02] built that confidence in me and loved me
[1:53:04] and everything but but that relationship
[1:53:08] as I that I had with them oh I wish I
[1:53:12] could portray that to my kids wish every
[1:53:15] family could portray that to the kids
[1:53:18] uh because
[1:53:20] that's deep to me. Um what saved me in
[1:53:24] the message? What what brought me in the
[1:53:25] message? It was not the mysteries
[1:53:28] although they're good. I understood
[1:53:31] um or I the the I I was marveled by it.
[1:53:35] Oh wow. How wonderful.
[1:53:39] But deeper than that, it was a family
[1:53:42] life that I saw like hm
[1:53:45] can actually people have a family life
[1:53:48] like this on earth that strike me. So
[1:53:54] I'm it's deep deeper than me. When you
[1:53:57] have strong families,
[1:53:59] it's more than quotes, more than
[1:54:03] so may God help us to have that life.
[1:54:05] Amen. Are you with me? Hopefully
[1:54:08] hopefully I didn't add more than and and
[1:54:10] we will go to tomorrow. Uh the deacon
[1:54:13] was just encouraging me to press on on
[1:54:15] the brother. Can you give him more time?
[1:54:17] He still have 1 hour. Actually, he still
[1:54:19] has 1 hour. He still has 1 hour to
[1:54:21] preach. So I I I I took 1 hour from him
[1:54:26] um because we could finish at 9:00
[1:54:29] today.
[1:54:30] That was the deacon was trying to
[1:54:32] negotiate there and I feel like he was
[1:54:34] led to leave at this time I think. So we
[1:54:37] allow just the Holy Spirit to go this
[1:54:39] way. But tomorrow if it's possible um
[1:54:43] 9:30 we start the songs if it's possible
[1:54:45] make a so that we give him time that we
[1:54:48] talk from him today. 9:30
[1:54:52] song service start 9:30 song service
[1:54:54] start tomorrow. I'll try to put that for
[1:54:57] the local church 9:30. Sometimes put the
[1:55:00] time that we put we usually put it for
[1:55:02] the tape to play for 15 minutes and then
[1:55:06] but tomorrow let's make an exception
[1:55:08] that make it
[1:55:10] 9:30 for the song service to start if
[1:55:13] possible.
[1:55:15] Can we sing again to be like Jesus Lord
[1:55:17] make me like you. Make me like you. To
[1:55:20] be like Jesus.
[1:55:22] Oh to be like Jesus.
[1:55:28] to be
[1:55:31] Jesus
[1:55:35] on earth. I long
[1:55:40] to be like him.

[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Let each person pray on his own way.
[1:59:07] Just speak to the Lord in your own way.
[1:59:11] Father, Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you.
[1:59:13] Thank you for your word.
[1:59:17] Thank you Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:59:20] Father you turn away nice.
[1:59:26] We just want to be humble with him and
[1:59:28] accept the way he lead us. But maybe we
[1:59:32] have taken it in the wrong way. I
[1:59:34] thought your brother was taking the
[1:59:36] wrong way
[1:59:38] to be
[1:59:42] that he was behaving like the prophet
[1:59:44] was behaving but in reality was
[1:59:48] from the real way. We have misunderstood
[1:59:51] so many times. Father, what we desire to
[1:59:54] be to do in the right way. How we can be
[1:59:58] nice to our to our to our wives. We can
[2:00:02] be nice to our husbands. How we can be
[2:00:05] nice to our children, to our rebellious
[2:00:07] children, our as as children, we can be
[2:00:12] oh God the right way to our parents.
[2:00:15] Father, we are here to learn. We desire
[2:00:18] to humble ourselves. Father, teach us.
[2:00:21] Mold us. Change our heart, change our
[2:00:24] minds, our thinking. Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:00:27] we want to be teachable. We want father
[2:00:29] to be like lamb to be led. We recognize

[2:03:58] sing it.
[2:04:00] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk

[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; that the comforter, the Holy Spirit,
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; abides with us.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; He's in us.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; He's going to give us power
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; and wisdom
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; to do all those things that are written
[2:05:26] in the word. Amen.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; He'll give us wisdom.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why they're preaching like
[2:05:32] this. It's bringing dust right down to
[2:05:34] earth
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; so that we can learn and have the wisdom
[2:05:38] how to take care of our families.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; That each each one of our children might
[2:05:42] serve the Lord.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; We've got to teach them the right way.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. When they're two, yes. Amen. You
[2:05:52] They have to listen. Amen. You give them
[2:05:55] directions. But when they're 20, they or
[2:05:58] 18, they become your friend.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got to treat them
[2:06:03] different. Amen. We've been teaching
[2:06:04] that
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; all along. Praise the Lord. Right,
[2:06:07] Sister Marie? Praise God. So, we're very
[2:06:10] happy that we're hearing it again.
[2:06:13] Praise God. Let's just pray together and
[2:06:15] let's come tomorrow morning, shall we?
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Invite those that should come,
[2:06:20] families, young young couples, we all
[2:06:23] can learn. old couples we can learn.
[2:06:27] Lord Jesus, tonight we're grateful for
[2:06:29] our brother Steve,
[2:06:31] oh God, for leading him, Lord, and
[2:06:34] guiding him to speak the word of God to
[2:06:36] us. Bless him richly and give him wisdom
[2:06:40] for tomorrow.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Give him what we have need of for
[2:06:43] tomorrow, Lord. Add to what we have
[2:06:46] heard today. Oh yes, Lord Jesus, we want
[2:06:50] to be good pastors.
[2:06:52] We want to care for the sheep. We want
[2:06:55] to love them and care for them.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; But I pray, Lord Jesus, that you would
[2:06:59] give us all wisdom.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; How to follow your word.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Because that's what we want to do. We
[2:07:06] want to eat of your word.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Man shall not live by bread
[2:07:10] alone, but by every word that proceeds
[2:07:13] out of the mouth of God. And so we want
[2:07:15] to eat of that word
[2:07:17] whether it's simple or whether it's a
[2:07:19] little bit more difficult, more
[2:07:21] prophetic or more pastoral. We want to
[2:07:24] just eat the word of God and we want to
[2:07:26] make it in the rapture. We want our
[2:07:28] children. We want our families to make
[2:07:30] it. Lord, help us dear Jesus is my
[2:07:33] prayer. Thank you for everyone that has
[2:07:35] come. Bless them Lord Jesus in a special
[2:07:38] way. The visitors like we already said.
[2:07:41] bless them and bring in those Lord that
[2:07:44] may have stayed home today.
[2:07:46] May you, Lord Jesus, speak to their
[2:07:48] heart. Lord, we all can learn something.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we thank you for your mercies.

[2:07:56] love you.

[2:08:03] us, and caring for us. Lord, you're the
