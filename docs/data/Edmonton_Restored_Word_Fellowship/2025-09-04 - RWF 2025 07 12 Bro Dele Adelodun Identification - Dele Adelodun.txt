The Lord bless you, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I don't keep us standing. I'll just humbly request that we read the Bible. &gt;&gt; Then when we take the comfort of our seats, I will greet us as I should. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. You're welcome. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles with you, please turn to the book of John 5 verse 39. John chapter 5, the 39th verse. If you are there, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Search the scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which testify of me. &gt;&gt; May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of his holy word. Amen. God bless you. You may please be seated. &gt;&gt; I want to thank the Lord tonight for making it possible for me to be in the midst of the believers &gt;&gt; in this part of the world. &gt;&gt; I thank God for granting it and uh I want to appreciate uh our dear pastors as it were. Amen. Uh my first pastor here is brother CL. Amen. God bless you sir. Amen. And uh now I have brother Moses. Amen. And uh I thank them for extending this arm of love to me &gt;&gt; to come and be of servicemen &gt;&gt; trusting to God that somewhere along the line we can be of a blessing. I bring the greetings of the saints back in Nigeria. &gt;&gt; Everyone is doing well. My wife, the children and all the members of my house, they all send their greetings. &gt;&gt; The local assembly that I represent also send their greetings. &gt;&gt; And uh I came into Canada on Wednesday. We had a service at Calgary on Wednesday and we had another one yesterday in Leedbridge before I traveled down here today. All the saints along that line also pass their regards to every one of you here. &gt;&gt; So it's nice to see you all again. Both the old faces that I know and the new faces I'm getting acquainted with. Is that brother Lucky? Okay. Wonderful. God bless you. Amen. God bless every one of you. God bless you, my brother. Amen. And uh I am sure glad to see everybody and I trust that the Lord will bless our time together. &gt;&gt; Amen. So for a little exhortation tonight, I would like to speak on identification. &gt;&gt; Identification. And uh if time permits and God help us, I want to look at it from three angles. Uh we identifying ourselves in the Bible. That is we identifying ourselves in the Bible. &gt;&gt; When we are inspired to locate our identity, &gt;&gt; it's very important. We shall start from there tonight. Then uh also the word identifying who we are. That is the second aspect. Amen. The word identifying who we are. And number three is uh who we also identify with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Very very important. &gt;&gt; If time permits uh we will see how God will help us. But if I do not finish and God did not lead that way tomorrow, I will leave the rest to brother Moses to continue. I'm used to giving assignments to the local pastor. &gt;&gt; So, brother Moses be on guard. Amen. The Lord bless you, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, I took inspiration for this subject from, you know, the message of the prophet himself on identification. &gt;&gt; But something struck me uh I don't know if it's possible to put it on the board, but if it's not, I will just read. Something struck me in two of the quotations where the prophet was speaking on identification. He preached identification about three or four places. Amen. And uh in one of the places the one he preached uh 63-0123 63- 0123 paragraph 33 it said may the Lord add his blessings uh to the reading of his word. I would like to take for a few minutes of your time on what I would call or like to say a text called identification. Identifying. Identified in the likeness of Bible characters. Being identified in the likeness of Bible characters. Then in paragraph 35 he says, "I'm sure tonight that we ought to find ourselves somewhere in some character of the Bible so that we will know the outcome of that character and know what our outcome will be. &gt;&gt; That is what struck me." Now, Apostle Paul said he was speaking about Paul and the rest, you know, of the characters of the scripture and it described their life as an allegory unto us. Some call it allegory, whichever one you call it. And when you look at the meaning of that, it's an event taking place not for itself, but something taking place now to speak of a future. So that follows that the life of Paul and most of these characters of the Bible that we are reading for an example are mere shadows. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are prophecies. &gt;&gt; And today we to whom the end of the world are come are the fulfillment of those prophecies. &gt;&gt; In fact our life will explain their own life better. Amen. &gt;&gt; The details we didn't get from their life, we shall get by our life. &gt;&gt; You know why? If you look at a shadow, all shadows look black. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; They don't give so much details, but you will. The shadow can tell enough as to show you the shape of the object you are looking at. &gt;&gt; But the color of that object, you cannot see by shadow. But when the real substance come, the substance gives the entire detail of what the shadow is projecting. &gt;&gt; So we become the entire details of all the Bible characters who are seeds of God. &gt;&gt; That is why the Bible said they without us &gt;&gt; the number is not complete. We represent the church of the capstone that will put perfection on the entire work of God bringing redemption to mankind throughout all the ages. &gt;&gt; So something struck me here. He said if we could look at the characters of the Bible and see what their outcome turn out to be, we will have an idea of what our own outcome will be. &gt;&gt; Because if you are seeing the shadow of an elephant, when the substance come, it will not be a rat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You agree with me on that, church? &gt;&gt; It's going to be an elephant with better details. All right, let's go gradually then in the identification the one he preached in 1964 paragraph 27 he said I just you know he was uh giving us a background here he was talking about a young boy who hadn't seen a mirror before and uh he was raised in the village but during occasions it came with a mother to see the aunt in the city And as they were walking up the steps, you know, uh, in the stairway, uh, there was a standing mirror, you know, facing them. So this boy, as he was walking up the steps, he saw another boy walking up the steps. &gt;&gt; And he was thinking somebody was coming to meet him. &gt;&gt; But by the time he got near the mirror and stood, the boy also stood. &gt;&gt; Then he was watching. Now, he couldn't immediately realize that that was him because he hasn't seen his own face before. &gt;&gt; It was his first time of seeing a mirror. So, he waved at the boy. The boy waved back at him. &gt;&gt; He smiled, the boy smiled. He jumped, the boy jumped. Everything he did, the boy did. Then he turned to mama. He said, "Mama, that's me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the prophet says, "So I just wonder today if we couldn't look in the Bible and say that's me &gt;&gt; as we wonder which one is it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which character in the Bible would we look like? Because the Bible is a mirror. &gt;&gt; When we come in here, we either come for treatment or for check off. &gt;&gt; That is why this is God's grace clinic. &gt;&gt; And that is why he is called the great physician. The sick people comes for treatment in the clinic. But if you see a healthy man come to the clinic, he is coming for check off. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you are healthy tonight, you need a checkup. &gt;&gt; If you are sick tonight, you need a healing. &gt;&gt; And the gospel does all. &gt;&gt; The Bible does all because it's the mirror that X-rays our life and show us our picture. May the Lord be our help tonight. &gt;&gt; Which character would look like? And uh let's just take that for a little text now and stay with it for a while. As we look into God's word, let's identify ourselves for he give others in there for examples of what we are. &gt;&gt; Are you following church? &gt;&gt; Now remember that God takes his spirit or takes his men but never his spirit. Satan takes his man but never his spirit. So let's see if we can identify our present state now with Bible characters. The Bible said all those things happened back in those days for example for us they are examples. So it's a cardinal strong touch that the prophet is projecting that the characters in the Bible are representations of some characters today and if we can get inspired enough in his presence we'll be able to locate our own identity &gt;&gt; in the Bible. There's a character that fit us &gt;&gt; and it fit us perfectly. And what is good for me is that if we'll see the outcome of that character, in other words, if that character made it, &gt;&gt; then it will give us faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we will also make it. &gt;&gt; If that character went through challenges, Amen. and you are also going through challenges. If that character wasn't defeated, then you know you will never be defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because your shadow can never fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe this was the inspiration that sister that brother said, "Let us call Auntie Jamaima." &gt;&gt; This was the grace she had. &gt;&gt; Take note, Auntie Jamaima was not even a message believer &gt;&gt; at the time of the report. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the principles of the word is just the same and is going to work for anyone, believer or saint. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why the prophet said sometimes a prostitute or an unbeliever would come in and receive his or healing when the children of the kingdom are struggling &gt;&gt; to get their blessings because the blessings of God walk by principles. &gt;&gt; So if we could come by his word tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; I like it when it said when you see the outcome of that character, you already know what your outcome will be. That is a way to build faith in ourselves. &gt;&gt; So this auntie Jumima had a very serious condition. Her son was sick and uh the son was nearing death. He was going to die and he began to she began to pray for her son. Then you know the trouble the challenge got so much on her till she began to think on her ways and somehow the mercy of the Lord came down. While she was looking at the story of our life she find something that looks like her &gt;&gt; a story that matches with us &gt;&gt; right in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Then she exclaimed I is that Shunamite woman. Amen. &gt;&gt; When that realization struck her, &gt;&gt; she didn't even have to pray. &gt;&gt; Is it does it mean you don't believe in prayer? I believe in prayer. Prayer. Prayer. Prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what I'm saying is that you have to pray with understanding. &gt;&gt; Something must inspire your prayer. When that sister prayed through, God inspired her to locate her identity &gt;&gt; in the word of the Lord. And at that moment, by that location alone, her prayer was already answered. &gt;&gt; She said, "I shunite woman." Then all she needed to do is to look at how it worked out for her. Then she can tell what her own outcome will be, whether she pray or not. It's a powerful realization. &gt;&gt; Then as she found her identity in the scriptures, then she said to herself, "Where is your Elijah?" &gt;&gt; It was a thought. It was an expression. &gt;&gt; Where is your Elijah? &gt;&gt; And the Lord of Elijah, &gt;&gt; the Lord who knows where Elijah was, &gt;&gt; went and locate Elijah for her. Amen. &gt;&gt; Elijah was in the plane traveling &gt;&gt; amongst many other travelers &gt;&gt; who had important businesses &gt;&gt; appointment to go and keep &gt;&gt; but the appointment did not matter again because a daughter of God located the identity &gt;&gt; in the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; By that location she became the number one preference. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May God help us to enjoy the blessings &gt;&gt; that God has freely given unto us. &gt;&gt; If you just know how to mind the wealth of the wedge, &gt;&gt; life will be victorious for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. There were a lot of people in that plane, but it didn't matter to God at that time because a daughter of God said, "Lord, if I am the Shunamite woman, &gt;&gt; then where is your Elijah?" Because the picture has got to become perfect. &gt;&gt; We have the Shunomite woman. We have the son that has been struck by disease. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was she was going to die. Then for the picture to become perfect, there must be an Elijah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't matter whether it is season or out of season. &gt;&gt; Because when the Shunami woman went to her husband, he says, "Saddle me and us." It will be today. get me a car and a driver. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Where are you going?" He said, "I'm going to see the prophet of the Lord." And the husband said, "It is neither the new moon nor the this and that." Hallelujah. In other words, it is not the season to go and see the prophet. But the woman said, "Whether it is in season or out of season, all will be well." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I tell you tonight, whether it is in season or out of season, &gt;&gt; God overrides every season. &gt;&gt; Because he is the God of all season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was out of the season for the prophet to turn around and come and attend to a sick call because she was actually in the air traveling somewhere among many other people. There might have been many CEOs and big people who were going to sign multi-million billion dollar deals, but it never mattered to God because of a woman who found her identity in the word of the Lord. And it wouldn't matter to God when your case is at stake. If you could find your identity, &gt;&gt; in the word of the Lord, search the scriptures. &gt;&gt; In them, you think you have eternal life. They are they that testify who I am. &gt;&gt; They testified of the bridegroom. They must testify of his bride. &gt;&gt; Because the same scripture that applies to the groom applies to his bride. &gt;&gt; And the bride will be word of his word, power of his power, life of his life. She will be him. &gt;&gt; Same characteristics. &gt;&gt; So God unplugged the knot on the aeroplane. And it signaled emergency &gt;&gt; and the pilot said we have to do a force landing &gt;&gt; and the only place they could land the only place they could land for you to know it was the guiding hand of the Almighty. The only place they could land was in Memphis, Tennessee. &gt;&gt; Right in the town where the woman lives. &gt;&gt; That is not a coincidence. That is the power of God &gt;&gt; responding to the need of his own daughter. He is still the same God tonight. Whatever your needs are, &gt;&gt; this is another avenue for you to receive your blessings. Begin to get in the spirit. Begin to locate your identity &gt;&gt; in the scripture. If you are in a state of suffocation, if there's no place to move in the front, and there's no back to turn to, no side to pull over, remember it has happened like that in the Bible before. There was a time Israel following God's leadership find themselves before the Red Sea. Find the Egyptians behind them. The hills and valleys were here. But what was the outcome? If they were never consumed, you can never be consumed. No matter how your experiences are getting tough and suffocating, only believe all things are possible. &gt;&gt; If they were never consumed, you can never be consumed. That is the way to have faith in the promises of God. Begin to locate your situation. Begin to locate your person in the word of the Lord tonight. And it will give you a new faith. It will awaken the giants of the faith in you to look positive in the face of any situation and mock the devil. &gt;&gt; Mock your fears tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; Friends, &gt;&gt; the plane did force landing &gt;&gt; right in Memphis, Tennessee. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the prophet asked the people, the technicians, the pilot and so forth, how long will it take to fix this plane? I think they said about four hours. He said that is enough time for me to do some postages. &gt;&gt; So he thought it was letter posting that God put him down for. But God had a different appointment. &gt;&gt; So when he carried his pouch or his bag to go and post letter, the spirit said keep moving. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where you got the song, keep moving. &gt;&gt; The spirit told brother Abraham. That was where the song came from. He said, "Keep moving." &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't bring you here to post letters. I brought you here as an answer to the yearning of my daughter who found identity &gt;&gt; or did they look do you know our situation identity in the word of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know what? Before the day broke that day, God had also told the woman &gt;&gt; that Elijah you ask for is on the way. &gt;&gt; Because he works on both hands. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is why you must never take the matter upon yourself. &gt;&gt; Let go and let God. &gt;&gt; He knows how to fix it. He knows how to arrange it. &gt;&gt; Christianity is peace. &gt;&gt; Christianity is rest. Rest little bride &gt;&gt; because all is well. &gt;&gt; The strength of Israel can never lie. Nothing can get out of his hand. He came four days late in Lazarus matter and yet he wasn't late. &gt;&gt; What was the outcome? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So as he was going with the pouch and start moving, brother Bram said, "Not knowing where I was going. It was just following the spirit. The Lord went back to tell that lady, "Come, the Elijah you asked for is on the way." And because over the night in the dream, she had seen how she was going to be dressed for you to know it wasn't a coincidence &gt;&gt; that Brother had to touch down in Memphis. &gt;&gt; It was all the working of God. &gt;&gt; That woman who was never a message believer &gt;&gt; saw Elijah. So how can you live today and deny the prophet as Elijah? What would you tell the woman of Memphis when she asked for Elijah and God sent her William and you are still in doubt who the Elijah of this hour is. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's a sin to disbelieve. &gt;&gt; It's a sin. &gt;&gt; It's a sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it started going. It started going. The woman was so sure of her revelation. You know what she did? She came out. &gt;&gt; She stood by her gate. &gt;&gt; If any neighbor ask her what were you doing? Say I'm waiting for Elijah. &gt;&gt; Which Elijah? &gt;&gt; Elijah of this hour I ask for Elijah. And the neighbor is going to say you must be out of your mind. &gt;&gt; And brethren, it takes to be out of our mind before we can believe God. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are not ready to lose your mind, &gt;&gt; you won't take the mind that was in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Be out of your mind tonight. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "If you want to believe the open word, you've got no thought coming." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Because things will come better than your personal understanding. &gt;&gt; The Bible must become a new book in your hand. That sister stood outside waiting for Elijah &gt;&gt; and Elijah appeared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when she looked, okay, yeah, that's the bag I saw. That's exactly the color of the suit he was wearing. That's the tie. That's the shirt. Okay. He's even having the heart. Okay. It must be the one. &gt;&gt; All right. And Elijah had no idea where he was going. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the goodness of God? That woman had better revelation than the prophet for that moment. &gt;&gt; She knew what was to happen. &gt;&gt; Elijah never knew what was to happen. But Elijah, it is enough that Elijah was in the will of God &gt;&gt; just doing what the Lord says. &gt;&gt; And as Elijah was passing by, the woman said, "Good morning person." &gt;&gt; And good morning person. Brother Abraham turned back. He said, "When I looked at her, she was old enough for me to call her auntie. And she and he said, "Good morning, auntie. How did you know him?" Auntie said, "In fact, this is where you should you were coming." &gt;&gt; Really? And she gave her testimony. And brother Arab said, "I still don't understand." But her testimony was so real, I couldn't turn her down. Then he went with her. And when they came inside, he said, "You see, I am that woman." Amen. &gt;&gt; She introduced herself again as a shamite woman. What a conviction that was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I never had a child. I trusted God for one, he gave me." And Yeshuna might never had a child. She trusted God and God gave. &gt;&gt; He said, "As my son grow up, uh he he got instructed. I tried to raise her up in a nice way, in a godly way, but he took the wrong road and it caught social disease and he's going to die. Now the Shunamite woman, brother Abraham said, maybe God's son stroke &gt;&gt; or something like that and he died. And the sister said and the auntie said, you know what? uh if God is going to take him that's okay but I want him to confess Christ &gt;&gt; before he is taken &gt;&gt; that struck me very deep &gt;&gt; that even in the hour of the deepest desperation &gt;&gt; the woman what she wanted was the kingdom of God first &gt;&gt; in other word if he's going to survive this he must be ready to live for God Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Lord, if you are pleased to take him, it is fine. But let me have the testimony &gt;&gt; that he confessed you because that will be the only guarantee that I was I will see mama's boy again. &gt;&gt; Brother said even in his condition, he still addressed him as mama's boy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a love. &gt;&gt; And that looks to me like the love of God himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The love of God is unconditional. &gt;&gt; He said while we were yet sinners. &gt;&gt; He commended his love towards us. &gt;&gt; You never did anything to impress him before he loved you. &gt;&gt; His love was in election. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When when when he elected you in his heart to be one of his own, he placed a gym a gin &gt;&gt; or a gem, a soul of life in there. Are you with me, brethren? &gt;&gt; You were not born empty. &gt;&gt; You were born with a seed gene. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is not everybody that carries that. &gt;&gt; And it is that gene of God that makes you a son, &gt;&gt; a daughter of God, not even your new birth. &gt;&gt; Ah, now you go quiet on me. &gt;&gt; All right. I didn't It wasn't a slip of tongue. I meant what I said. &gt;&gt; It is not a new birth that makes you a son &gt;&gt; or a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; The new birth brings you to the realization &gt;&gt; of your sunship and your daughtership. &gt;&gt; What makes you a son or a daughter of God is election. &gt;&gt; That is the meaning of the love of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world, &gt;&gt; he ordained you to life &gt;&gt; and he puts the seed of life. Remember, it was before you received the Holy Ghost that you started thinking about Christ. You started thinking about a change. Brother Brown said it is the deposit of God in you &gt;&gt; that was hungering and testing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. for life at that time and it staggered you to the church or it made you listen to the gospel one more time and it struck a hold. &gt;&gt; What strikes a hold was the quickening of the seed. &gt;&gt; So what the spirit does is to wake up, &gt;&gt; is to sprank to like &gt;&gt; what was already in you. &gt;&gt; Brother said that was actually to be you. But because we were born natural, you understand the way we were born. That birth was a program between Satan and Eve &gt;&gt; and it was the devil's way of injecting his own nature into mankind. So as many as were born that way have a nature of the devil imposed. That is why the pro Bible said we were by nature the children of rot fitted only for destruction. But that nature that I'm sorry is it okay? &gt;&gt; God bless you. Sometimes I like to connect with my audience. &gt;&gt; Amen. That nature that fits you for destruction. Amen. It didn't come from God. It wasn't your real you. &gt;&gt; The real you is the one that lays dormant like a little button armless inside of you. Amen. But because your first manifestation on earth was flesh and blood, that is the nature that became activated and it started controlling you. Satan stole your identity &gt;&gt; to do many things. Amen. They saw you here. They thought it was you stealing. It wasn't you. &gt;&gt; They thought it was you uh living immoral. It wasn't you. They thought it was you fighting. It wasn't you. It was an identity theft by the devil. Lord, your real you cannot fight. Lord, ye you cannot steal. &gt;&gt; Your real you cannot even commit sin. It doesn't have it in him to do. This is why the Bible say it that is born of God does not commit sin because the seed of God abideth in him. Why is he not a sinner? because it doesn't have a desire for it. &gt;&gt; That is what makes the difference. &gt;&gt; But your first appearance didn't look like that. &gt;&gt; Born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you keep on doing like that until you appointed season. &gt;&gt; When your season came, you at the same word you've been hearing. It came strangely this time around because your real you &gt;&gt; is ready to come to life. &gt;&gt; And that and your real you and that old nature don't dwell together. &gt;&gt; One must give way for the other. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; This is why when God comes with the baptism of the Holy Ghost to give a quickening to your real you, he also comes with fire &gt;&gt; to do what? to burn the nature &gt;&gt; to his roots and an elate it completely. &gt;&gt; Brother Arab said the way is redeeming you is the way is redeeming the earth &gt;&gt; that you are going to live in. That is why before the first quaset is set in here and eternity begins, there must be another annihilation by firemen, &gt;&gt; a cleansing of fire to renovate the earth. As your heart is being renovated for God to take full occupation. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; You love him tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's come back to auntie Jamaima's house &gt;&gt; because if we go that way we won't leave here tonight &gt;&gt; except you are prepared for a night all night. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you saints. &gt;&gt; So it's a I just need that testimony &gt;&gt; that he meets God before he dies. And uh when a when a person thinks like that, I think it's always like God to give them bonus &gt;&gt; because you know why she was seeking the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; even first in the face of death. &gt;&gt; And there's a principle seek ye first the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; and its righteousness then all other things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. those other things whether you pray for them or you do not pray for them it's a given &gt;&gt; as long as you seek the kingdom that is the principle you seek the kingdom then all other things you know why every other thing it's in the kingdom &gt;&gt; brother said when you receive the Holy Ghost all that you need and all that you will ever need even to your rapture it's already in you &gt;&gt; come on charge &gt;&gt; everything you need, &gt;&gt; every blessing as you water that seed of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Growing it start manifesting pushing out your blessings. &gt;&gt; Amen. At the appointed time, it pushes out your wife, &gt;&gt; pushes out your husband, pushes out your children, it pushes out your jobs, it pushes out your house, it pushes out every blessing. That is why God said take no thought &gt;&gt; if our faith can rise to it. Jesus said do not be anxious for nothing &gt;&gt; because all things are already yours but the kingdom of God in your heart. &gt;&gt; This is the rest of the believers. Because she sought for the kingdom, &gt;&gt; God was ready to offer her bonuses. &gt;&gt; Let's say the bonus by a woman who located identity &gt;&gt; in the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham said, &gt;&gt; I was still trying to come to terms with what she was saying. Then I said, you know what, auntie, you pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know when they all entered that boy was saying it's getting dark in here. &gt;&gt; Meaning the shadows of death &gt;&gt; were already covering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Abraham said auntie began to pray and you can tell that auntie is used &gt;&gt; to talking to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mamas &gt;&gt; be used to talking to God. &gt;&gt; You need it very well. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "A praying mother can do much more in the life of a child even than a pastor &gt;&gt; behind the pulpit." &gt;&gt; God makes you the kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; I'm using the words of the prophet. You are the nearest king to those children. This is why your prayer done righteously must avail &gt;&gt; in their lives. You are one of those who must wave the token over your family. We've got four things to wave the token over our children. Then we can say, "Lord, it is in your hand." &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Live a life worthy before them." &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Keep the right atmosphere in the home. Put out things that are evil out of your house." He said, "Then brother said find time to sit with them and share the word." Then number four, he said, "Learn to be on your knees. Pray for those children." If you have done those four things, he said, "Leave the rest." Amen. &gt;&gt; into the hands of the Lord &gt;&gt; day by day. Tell them no matter how they are behaving, &gt;&gt; if they are behaving contrary &gt;&gt; to the values of the word, tell it to yourself. It is mere symptoms. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet call it. He said don't look at symptoms. Look at the promise. &gt;&gt; If it get worse with her or with him, look at the promise and tell the child I have claimed you for Christ. You have no option at God's appointed time. Hallelujah. You must come to his saving grace. It's the principle of the word. Brother said, "I've seen it so effective that even when some mamas have gone on to the Lord." God put their prayers in a bank waiting for the appointed time to reckon with it. That was why he could tell some folks when they come to the altar. He said, "Do you know what is happening today? It is the prayer of your mother that has long gone that God has brought to remembrance and that is what has brought you to the altar. You've got the power my sister &gt;&gt; let us enjoy the blessings that God have put in our hand. &gt;&gt; Brother the prophet said auntie pray &gt;&gt; and auntie prayed like she's used to talking to God &gt;&gt; and you know all the prophet did was to endorse our prayer. &gt;&gt; That's all he did. He endorsed the prayer of that woman and the boy who said it's getting dark in here started saying it's getting light in here. &gt;&gt; It's getting light in here. It's getting light in here. In the midst of the revival and joy, brother Arab left to run to the airport. And when he got to the airport, he was being called for the last time. &gt;&gt; William Brown, final call for your body &gt;&gt; because the mission has been accomplished. Two years later, &gt;&gt; he met the same young man in one of the ports, airports or so, and they couldn't recognize him again. &gt;&gt; And the boy walked up to the prophet and said, "You couldn't you can't recognize me, Brother Abraham." He said, "No, I doubt. I'm sorry. We made a lot of people, you know." He said, "Yes, I am that Auntie Juba's son, &gt;&gt; whom you came to play for &gt;&gt; two years ago." He says, "Since that time, I've been healed and I've cleaned up my life. I've settled down and married with a child and I'm serving the Lord, preaching the gospel." [Applause] &gt;&gt; So, the mama got a bonus &gt;&gt; for placing the kingdom of God first. That is the power of those who located their identity &gt;&gt; in the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You love him tonight. &gt;&gt; One time in Bram tabernacle. The old man would know more about this than I do. They are reservoirs of histories of the message. But this one I read so I'm fine. One time you know they were contemplating I think a renovation or an expansion of the church and uh they were taking the pledges from people you know voluntary pledges whoever wants to be a support and there was an old widow woman very popular among us sister ate right and uh from the account of the prophet Ahan Hennings was $100 Then, &gt;&gt; yeah, $100 digging potatoes as laborers for farm people, for farm owners. And this woman came and pledged $50, half of our annual wages. She's a widow. She's so poor even by the poverty or standard of living index at that time. But she was so committed to the things of God. I think our life is an inspiration &gt;&gt; for those of us who might think that it is when we have money that we'll do things for the Lord. You see, if you don't do it when you don't have, &gt;&gt; you cannot do it when you have. &gt;&gt; Because resources isn't what makes you committed. &gt;&gt; Commitment comes from the heart. &gt;&gt; It's a victory in itself. That is why you see somebody with $10 for the kingdom, you will still want to pinch out of it. Whereas somebody with $10,000, you say, "Let me have $100,000 before I serve the Lord." &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not uing your feelings. &gt;&gt; Or I'm just preaching the gospel. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But this woman, $100 a whole year and she pledged 50. And as a commitment to demonstrate her seriousness, she has redeemed 20 $20. So the boards, the dickens and the the board were you know telling the prophet when giving report when it came around they were giving it excitingly and the prophet was shocked in his heart. If we need people's money it's not that kind of our own money. She's a poor woman. So, brother Abraham made up his mind to return Sister Attorney in a very stylish way. &gt;&gt; The wife gave him $20 to buy an to buy some eggs and so forth. He said, "I better go to Hat's house to go and drop this money." And you watch this. When he was going, the Lord began to deal with him. &gt;&gt; And the Lord just gave him a scripture. You know what in the Bible there was a widow woman &gt;&gt; who gave let me use the word maybe cent today who gave two cents or $2. &gt;&gt; And uh there were a lot of people who gave so much in that meeting but I the Lord said she gave the most &gt;&gt; because those who gave thousands gave out of their plenties. But she gave out of nothing. &gt;&gt; So God was using the law of relativity, not absolute &gt;&gt; figures. In other word, she gave 100% of a 100%. &gt;&gt; Whereas a $10,000 of somebody might just be 1% of several. You get it? So if we look at it in percentages, the woman gave the highest. And he was telling the prophet, "Perhaps if you were there that day, you would have stopped her." &gt;&gt; He said, "But I didn't stop her then, &gt;&gt; and neither should she be stopped." Now, &gt;&gt; what was God showing? &gt;&gt; He was showing that that widow woman &gt;&gt; was a shadow identity &gt;&gt; of sister, right? &gt;&gt; My goodness. &gt;&gt; Are you following? Amen. &gt;&gt; So the rest of the story about the widow woman that we couldn't see in the shadow, we can find out in our own life. &gt;&gt; Because our story never ended with that pledge money. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother said it was because God knew what he had for her &gt;&gt; along the road. That was why he inspired her &gt;&gt; to do such a thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the prophet became very humble and uh said, "Well, I'm on my road anyhow, but we'll forget about this $20 business." I thought we don't need it, but God said he needs it. &gt;&gt; So, let the Lord have it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And by the time she he got to the house of the sister, he met some brothers there. Now we call this woman I've always wondered we called her a very poor woman but her house is always filled with brethren. &gt;&gt; Most account of what you will read about sister aie her father uh mother it's all about them entertaining the brethren. &gt;&gt; So why would a poor why would people be so much attracted to the house of a poor sister? What does she offer? What did she offer them &gt;&gt; that would have been sweeter, better, nicer, sumptuous &gt;&gt; than what they could have gotten elsewhere? &gt;&gt; I think it is the atmosphere that she created around herself. And I think it is the love with which &gt;&gt; she presented her peanuts. &gt;&gt; She might not have more than peanuts, but the love with which she presented it &gt;&gt; endeared her to the people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the prophet got there and settled down with the brethren and one thing led to the other discussions were going on and as they started talking about the testimony of the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh this sister also got interested but you know what she did she started playing Mary and matter combined. I think we can learn from her. You said, "What do you mean?" The prophet told us that she positioned herself, I think, by the door of the kitchen because she was trying to cook something for her guests, &gt;&gt; but at the same time, she was interested &gt;&gt; in the testimony. &gt;&gt; So with her hands, she was working in the kitchen, but with her heart, she was connecting with the word. &gt;&gt; Matter was so busy with kitchen things to the detriment of the word. Mary will sit to listen to the word money tonight to the detriment of the house. &gt;&gt; So we need a combination. &gt;&gt; Amen. The house must be kept in it. &gt;&gt; And yet we must hear the gospel. &gt;&gt; We must spare time to pray. &gt;&gt; We must spare time to listen to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So while she was there sitting in the middle, Amen. The prophet was laboring &gt;&gt; to convince the brothers that were seated with him at the table. He was saying, "You know what? That thing wasn't a myth. It wasn't a vision. I killed the squirrel. It bled. We cooked it. We ate it." &gt;&gt; And yet they were still looking. &gt;&gt; Some of you come to the house of the Lord with skeptic ideas. And some of you get so full of yourselves &gt;&gt; until even the spirit cannot break you. &gt;&gt; The only thing that breaks you is dozing in church &gt;&gt; is sleeping in church. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that breaks. Outside of that, people don't know who you are moody with. &gt;&gt; You say it's my nature. It's a bad nature for a Christian to have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the spirit of the Lord take over your life, it changes your nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let us go with a song and a smile. &gt;&gt; The world is exuberance in the things of the world. &gt;&gt; They go to their games. You don't tell them to say, "Man, you don't tell them to rejoice there." They don't sit there moody. &gt;&gt; They get connected in order to enjoy their game. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is the emotional drive. Here is where we come to express our own emotions and we must be exorbitant in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Don't let your grace pass you by friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. Respond to the word. &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Lord was moving. One day the pillar of air was moving and it was descending from seat to seat. That was how a brother sat looking at the prophet when his life was being talked about. He was so lost. He was just looking. Then the pillar of fire thought that he wasn't ready. He just moved to the next person. That was when he woke up. Brother Abraham said, "Mr. This, you missed it." &gt;&gt; And he missed it completely because the pillar of never came back to him. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This was why those brothers in their watch it took a woman who wasn't seated close to the prophet &gt;&gt; to give comfort the prophet needed. &gt;&gt; It said brother Abraham that is nothing but the truth &gt;&gt; and the Lord honored it. &gt;&gt; The moment she said that everywhere change &gt;&gt; and brother Brown says sister ate you have found favor before the Lord. Ask anything you want. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is still in that business of giving blanket checks. &gt;&gt; Brother said we live in the times that God will put it amongst human being &gt;&gt; to ask and it shall be given. &gt;&gt; It said so. It didn't tell us those times are taken off. &gt;&gt; Your right mental attitude. &gt;&gt; That was why he said your right mental attitude to every promise of God to the word of God will determine your blessings. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can leave here tonight packing bonuses of blessings. &gt;&gt; And while another person may leave and say, "I feel no virtue." &gt;&gt; He felt no virtue because he wasn't connected. &gt;&gt; How did it take a woman sitting at the kitchen door to give the right comfort? Whereas those who were sitting by the prophet at the table were looking. [Music] Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And said, "I don't know what to ask." You know what the prophet said in another place? He said, "God knows the characters he gives blanket check to." &gt;&gt; So Arty has gotten to that realm of maturity. She's coming to a climax to know what to do with the blessings of God &gt;&gt; right here on earth. And you all know the rest of the story &gt;&gt; because somebody located our identity. &gt;&gt; Don't forget that somebody saw our identity in the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Mind who you identify with. &gt;&gt; We can go on and on. We have we have we have finished on identifying yourself in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Now mind who you identify with. Because who you identify with do not sometimes only determine your fortune. &gt;&gt; It cannot affect the fortunes of your generation. &gt;&gt; And I have that by the scripture. Don't move with people who have negative energies. The congregations of I cannot, I cannot, I cannot. &gt;&gt; We be not able. &gt;&gt; If you are within the circles of friends that when you finish conversation, they leaves you vile. &gt;&gt; Then you get to them. You must change your company. &gt;&gt; Mind who you identify with. You must move with characters that provoke you &gt;&gt; to good works. &gt;&gt; Iron must sharpen iron. He was a righteous man. Hear me. Hear me. Good. Joseph was such a righteous man. But he lost all because of poor discret discretion of who to move with. &gt;&gt; Even when God had mercy upon him to escape certain fatalities, as a repercussion for his indiscretion. His generation didn't time will fail me to trace it because we'll go through about seven chapters to do that. But let me give you a summary. The prophet said Aab and Jehoshaphat and were not exactly the same. Jehoshaphat was a worshshiper of God who was committed. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes you ask yourself, why do bad things happen to good people? &gt;&gt; This can be why. &gt;&gt; This is one of the wise. Not all of the wise, but this is one. &gt;&gt; There could be positive reasons also, but this is a negative one which I want you to learn from. The Bible's description of Aab was that there was not a man so wicked who sold his art to do evil like Aab. How many ever read that in the Bible? That was the Bible's description of this character &gt;&gt; because he joined himself into idol worship &gt;&gt; by a poor marriage. That's right. &gt;&gt; And it was by him the prophet taught us that we shouldn't marry unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Always marry believers. &gt;&gt; Mixed marriages have never worked. That's one of the mixed marriages the prophet talked about. &gt;&gt; He said it never worked. When Solomon joined himself to strange women, &gt;&gt; the wisest king on the earth died and had a worshshiper. &gt;&gt; That's the scripture. And it was this action of ease that made the kingdom of Israel that was united as one to be divided into two. &gt;&gt; Read your Bible. &gt;&gt; And the reason God had to divide it was because God wanted to spite and humiliate Solomon &gt;&gt; for what he did by handling over the kingdom of Solomon to his own errand boy. But Jerobam wasn't of the seed of David &gt;&gt; who had an inheritance of perpetuity of kingdom. &gt;&gt; So for the sake of David, God had to divide the kingdom so that he can retain his promise to David of giving him a perpetual kingdom. &gt;&gt; But the major part of Israel was handed over to Eron boy of Solomon. because of this. And the Bible said when Jeroboam came, that guy was too evil &gt;&gt; until his evil became a stain that couldn't be bleached out of Israel. Every king that came, no matter most of them, no matter how great a revival they had, you will hear the Bible say, "But he did not depart &gt;&gt; from the sin of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin." His sin was too much. But as if that was a light thing, Ahab added dimensions. That was who we was. I'm giving you a background. &gt;&gt; Now for a righteous man, king of Judah, Jehoshaphat to come and join an affinity with such a character. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. You yourself, you are rejecting it in your heart. But that was it. That was what happened. The Bible said Jehoshaphat visited Ahab. And the Hab knowing himself to be a troublesome man who has gotten an acclaim as a troublemaker &gt;&gt; is looking for a way to legitimize his actions. When those weward brothers are dragging you, conscripting you into their projects, they are only looking for legitimacy &gt;&gt; for their poor lives. &gt;&gt; And it takes somebody standing pure and righteous &gt;&gt; to stand as the cover. Aab remained unrepentant. He wasn't willing to change. &gt;&gt; Brother said he always has an axe to grind with everybody. It doesn't feel good when everything is peaceful. &gt;&gt; He must simulate and create problem situations. &gt;&gt; I'm describing his character by the prophet. &gt;&gt; So when Joseph maybe by invitation or whatever came to meet him, the prophet said, "Watch what he did first." &gt;&gt; He first approached him with an hospitality that was so generous. He killed him with kindness. &gt;&gt; Not because Jehoshaphat himself wasn't a rich man. But you see, when you want to be polite when somebody went all the way out for you, you want to be polite to turn, you know, to appreciate them. &gt;&gt; But be careful the kind of appreciation you offer. Amen. &gt;&gt; And be careful the kind of gift you accept &gt;&gt; because the cost of repayment may be too great for you. &gt;&gt; Aab never disclosed his mission. He only offered hospitality. You see when you study the Bible and the Bible is giving you details of some things. It's because that thing is profound. &gt;&gt; He wants you to give attention. He said Ahab slaughtered a lot of cles this that and the other just for one man and his entourage. He was using all those things to arise his psychology &gt;&gt; and to get him to submission for the plot that is coming &gt;&gt; and that is why it's he wants he want young sisters he said that slick guy that could dump the can of his mama's vaseline mama's you know jelly on his head and look so great &gt;&gt; if he started spoiling you with some kindness &gt;&gt; with some generous gift he said he's putting you up &gt;&gt; for a showdown. &gt;&gt; Are you getting it? &gt;&gt; Because he's come to ask for a he's come he's come to ask for a repayment of that favor and the cost may be too great. &gt;&gt; Don't be carried away. &gt;&gt; Why is he buying you an iPhone? Why is he placing you on contract and he said don't let mama knows &gt;&gt; I just feel led &gt;&gt; that is not apostolic brethren if you want to be kind to the if you are itchy if you have enough to spend don't direct it to an innocent girl &gt;&gt; bring your blessings to the deacons they know who have need &gt;&gt; that is Why? That was how deacon deacons began in the Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that the blessings can even out. &gt;&gt; Don't single out a young sister in that innocent mind and become a predator in our life. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Am I making the seat hard for you? &gt;&gt; Truth must be preached anyhow. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you young ladies to don't be weward &gt;&gt; to be accepting gifts &gt;&gt; from people. &gt;&gt; Even if somebody's in cship with you. &gt;&gt; The best place I know where the prophet plays gifting is when he's engaged to you. &gt;&gt; He said when he's engaged to you, start giving you love tokens &gt;&gt; beginning with an engagement ring. If he wants to buy car, buy house for you, he can do it. He's already locked inside &gt;&gt; because your vow seals the deal &gt;&gt; don't get carried away. Gift corrupt, gift blind. &gt;&gt; If you are taking decision, take it out of your pure heart. &gt;&gt; Huh? Not because this, not because that, these things weaken the body. God bless you, sir. &gt;&gt; After I hear about offered hall, that was when he brought out his joker. Ramad Gillad belonged to us. He had it in mind all along. &gt;&gt; But he wanted to put Jehoshaphat in a condition where he cannot refuse. And they said Joshua said, "Okay. But that's fine if you want us to go to battle. Your people are as mine. &gt;&gt; Mine is yours. Our God is the same. &gt;&gt; When you hear the prophet preach on that scream said, "No, they are not the same." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jehoshaphat is a worshshiper of God. Ahab is a worshshiper of Ba. How can they be the same? &gt;&gt; We are not the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; But you see when you have been corrupted with hospitality, &gt;&gt; you can you lose your senses. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; That was what happened. But the God factor in Jehoshaphat made him to make a small request. &gt;&gt; He said, "Even though this battle looks nice for us to go, can we please ask the Lord?" &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Aab said, "I got that covered. I know you are too righteous to go to anywhere without asking the Lord. I've got it covered. He called his 400 prophet. They said, "Go." The divine instinct, the measure of discernment &gt;&gt; that God placed in every child of God to guide them against error came up again in Jehoshaphat. &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Isn't there a prophet of the Lord?" &gt;&gt; Can you underline that statement? meaning that these ones are your own prophet. &gt;&gt; I want to hear from the prophet of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh man. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And also answered he said he said that's where the problem is. &gt;&gt; We have one actually but I hate him. &gt;&gt; He loves his own prophet but he hates the prophet of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Shouldn't you run from such a man? &gt;&gt; What affinity should you have with such a person? What identification should we have with a character like that? Joaba said, "Let not the king say so." &gt;&gt; Well, said it and we have heard it and it's been written. &gt;&gt; They brought Micaiah after all deal to compromise that the prophet of the Lord rejected. &gt;&gt; You all know the story. I'm just quoting it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Micaiah even showed him &gt;&gt; the secret behind all his prophets saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; Did you catch that? &gt;&gt; He revealed all the entire mysteries to him. &gt;&gt; But because he is not of the Lord, &gt;&gt; he can't he couldn't catch it. &gt;&gt; It so Jehoshaphat. Wait, this is the danger. This is what I'm pointing out. It so bad Jehoshaphat. But Jehoshaphat was too carried away &gt;&gt; because he doesn't want to ought Ahab. Now he was the one who asked for a second opinion. The opinion had come and yet he remained too weak &gt;&gt; to take a decision by the genuine opinion. &gt;&gt; And that was why Jehoshaphat sealed his own doom. the doom of his generation. What he should have done at that moment is to say, "Hey, at this moment, I think I don't mean to hurt you." &gt;&gt; But if you take it as ought forgive me, I can't go any further because let me tell you, somebody has got to be ought in the process. &gt;&gt; When you are not oughting man, you are oughting God. Have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons? &gt;&gt; Are you with me brethren? &gt;&gt; Jehoshaphat went to that battle and it was Ahab's plan to donate Jehoshaphat to use Jehoshaphat as a ransom for himself. That's why the prophet said the children of this world are smarter and wiser. &gt;&gt; Even though weaker, they are smarter in their generation. &gt;&gt; They are good, but they will push you to the guillotin and jump over it &gt;&gt; while you as a lamb, you will stick your neck inside. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; Even Aam knew better than to joke with the words of Micaiah. &gt;&gt; That was why out of panic and fear, he said, "You know what? I will change the battle strategy. &gt;&gt; I will not dress as a king this time. &gt;&gt; But you, Jehoshaphat dress as a king. &gt;&gt; What? What is that?" &gt;&gt; And Jehoshaphat was too dull &gt;&gt; to see the plot. &gt;&gt; And God said, "Don't kill nobody else than here." He told the Syrians, "Leave my he leave my people of Israel alone. Target to that guy." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the Hab has disguised himself &gt;&gt; till the battle was over. Nobody could get here. &gt;&gt; But the Lord who can identify who was &gt;&gt; he told one Syrian soldier, he said, "You came with this spear all the way from your country, right?" He said yes. And you carried an heavy load coming and you didn't achieve your him and you are carrying the load back again. Is that not double trouble for one man? &gt;&gt; Are there no more rods and ions to make more spears in &gt;&gt; in Syria? He said yes there are. So why waste your time? Just throw it away. &gt;&gt; And he said that makes sense. That makes sense. And he threw it. He just look at let me let me eat that fruit and the angel of the Lord pick it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because thus say the Lord &gt;&gt; can never fail. &gt;&gt; And he picked the spear and he came to where because only God can identify here. &gt;&gt; And he came to where here was. He said, "Thus say the Lord can never fail. [Music] &gt;&gt; Jehoshaphat escaped it &gt;&gt; by God's providence." You know the Syrians wanted to kill him &gt;&gt; until he identified himself. That was what wanted to do. &gt;&gt; All right. But when he came back home, God told him &gt;&gt; God welcomed him with a prophecy &gt;&gt; that should have make that man quick and repented. &gt;&gt; But you know what? Jehoshaphat repeated the class again &gt;&gt; by joining affinity with the son of Ahab. And from there family uh family friendship began. That was where the son of Jehoshaphat became attracted to the daughter of Jezebel &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; and he married her. &gt;&gt; And when the son of Jehoshaphat took over the throne, they called him Jehoram. The Bible said he was too wicked. the wickedness that was not in his lineage. He showed it until he killed all his own brothers who were not struggling the throne with him. He wiped out all the generations of Jehoshaphat because the Bible said he has the wife, he has the daughter of Jezebel &gt;&gt; as his wife. &gt;&gt; So you saw where it came &gt;&gt; and from there go and look at it. It was the daughter of Jezebel who eventually took over the throne. That's right. &gt;&gt; of Judah atallayah &gt;&gt; and wiped out the rest of the remnant. &gt;&gt; It was only the mercy of God to David &gt;&gt; that preserved one seed for Jehoshaphat. Everything was wiped out &gt;&gt; because of poor identification. Don't bequitch evil to your generation. &gt;&gt; You love him tonight. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's on the negative side. Let me give you one on the positive side and we can see if the world can identify us if there is time. If there's no time, bro, Moses will take care of that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; One day Jesus was invited to Simon's house. &gt;&gt; Simon the Pharisee. Do you remember him? &gt;&gt; Amen. It looks like an honorable invitation, but it turned out to be a setup. And you will wonder why Jesus our Lord we allowed himself to be set off. Is it that he didn't know? The Lord knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; He's the master of all circumstance. &gt;&gt; Whatever the devil taught as a ploy to disgrace God will turn out a blessing for somebody. &gt;&gt; Simon the Pharisees invited our Lord to his feast. Brother Aram said Jesus keep all his appointments. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If he could honor the invitation of Simon the Pharisee, he can honor the invitation of his children. &gt;&gt; So just invite him into your heart tonight &gt;&gt; and you will find him there. &gt;&gt; He's going to come to your home. He's going to come to your job. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet told us when Mr. Cabbury Foodcraft and the rest of them were struggling with their businesses. He said one of them woke up one day and heard a loud voice. He said, "Make Jesus your partner." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Go and read their story. Great Christian men who set up enduring multinational legacies. &gt;&gt; Said make Christ your partner. And the men woke up and said today Christ is the partner of this business. And that is why after they have gone, their business is still surviving &gt;&gt; because all may change. Jesus never. &gt;&gt; So invite him into your life. &gt;&gt; Invite him into your home. &gt;&gt; If you bring him to your home, don't make him a guest. &gt;&gt; That's a poor position. &gt;&gt; Because brother Arab said wherever you put him, that's where he stays. &gt;&gt; So make him the householder &gt;&gt; so that he can take responsibility for whatever goes out or whatever comes in. Let him be the land owner. &gt;&gt; You'll be more protected that way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So they brought Jesus to the party or to the feast. But even though he came by special invitation, yet he wasn't treated any special. They didn't wash his feet. They didn't, you know, towel his body, anoint him with handments to give him some cool effect and a refreshing effect in order to gather with the rest of the crowd. So, because these things were not done, he found himself out of place because he has been burning in the heat of the eastern sun, sweaty and everything. So, he found himself out of place to move with the rest of the highs who were sitting and doing their things. So Jesus was left alone in a corner &gt;&gt; and they must have been celebrating to Mr. Simon the Pharisee. Ah, you got a big cash for us today. Let's make a spot out of him. See how he's there sitting down like a defeated like a conquered guy. Just look at him. Oh, congratulations. You're a big man. They were happy. &gt;&gt; But you see, Jesus had a purpose for everything. Do you know why he kept the appointment? Because that was God's appointed day for a bigger picture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; While the celebration was going on, we didn't know how this lady came in. &gt;&gt; Maybe she great crashed. Maybe she came as an escort to one of the big men. Maybe she was it was in her neighborhood and she heard that do you know that Jesus of Nazareth is in that feast is in that feast and we do everything I can to enter that place &gt;&gt; we don't know the circumstance that got her inside &gt;&gt; but when she came inside &gt;&gt; she chose to identify &gt;&gt; glory &gt;&gt; with the person that was rejected And it was this identification, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; that rewrote our life. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ our Lord said, "Wherever the gospel of Christ is being preached, mention will be made of her." &gt;&gt; Tonight, this scripture &gt;&gt; is fulfilled again. &gt;&gt; What did she do when she looked perfectly and truly assertaining that that is Jesus Christ of Nazareth? She said, "I won't miss today." &gt;&gt; The Bible said she went back to her house &gt;&gt; to do what? To empty all our savings. That's the language of the word. Everything she had because the kind of oil, the perfume oil she was going to buy will cost everything. &gt;&gt; Is a big box of alabaster oil. And in Israel, they told us that this box of alabaster oil that this woman purchased, uh, the cost of it equals the annual wages, not monthly wages, of six elitist soldiers, imperial guards of the majesty. So you could imagine how much they'll be earning when you put the annual wages of six of them together. That was why Judas is carry You know why he was mad? Said, "Why such a waste?" He forget it was being done to his master. &gt;&gt; He said, "This this money could have been used to set up a foundation that might have taken care of maybe 200 poor families &gt;&gt; and we're just wasting it one time." Even though it looked as if he had consent for the poor, &gt;&gt; the Bible said no. &gt;&gt; No, he said he's a thief. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible said. Because he holds the bag. &gt;&gt; Even if he did they seeded the money to do the foundation, he's already looking at the percentages that he will swallow out of it. &gt;&gt; That was his interest, not the poor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said not that he cared for the poor. Mhm. &gt;&gt; But I'm trying to show you how costly that oil was. &gt;&gt; And it took a hall. &gt;&gt; It's got to take you all &gt;&gt; to serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said, not minding what people will say, she brought the oil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She started weeping. &gt;&gt; Gathered enough tears. I don't know the quantity, but it was enough to do what Simon couldn't do &gt;&gt; to wash his feet. And she turned her hair to towel to wipe the feet. And she poured the oil on my Lord. &gt;&gt; And when Judas was annoyed with that, Jesus told them, "Why? &gt;&gt; You thought I came to eat rice. I came to eat potatoes." Yeah. Some turkey slices of some chicken here. &gt;&gt; Grilled saloin steak. You think that was why I came here? I came here to be anointed for my burial. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This was the chosen place. &gt;&gt; He said, "This woman has done this for my burial." &gt;&gt; That was why when Jesus died and the sisters were bringing spices to anoint the body, read your Bible. Did they succeed? They couldn't find a body to anoint because it's been anointed already for the burial. &gt;&gt; That was how powerful the revelation of the sister was. And that was why Christ had to keep that appointment. She identified &gt;&gt; with the Lord Jesus Christ and it's under eternal life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When she was doing that, Simon and his friends, they said, "We got them. We got them." And they called all the press men that came and said, "Give us strategic pictures because we got to make an headlines tomorrow." And they were already congratulating themselves. Sir, you are too intelligent. We must make you a night of St. Order of John. &gt;&gt; How you will get us get this man so we can oh, we can deal with this matter once and for all. And Jesus heard what they were saying, but he waited for the woman to finish. And when he finished, he said, "Simon, come over here." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have someone to tell you. &gt;&gt; Let me give you a small quiz if you can answer. &gt;&gt; Uh there are two fellows who hold their master. One hold the master $100,000 Canadian dollars &gt;&gt; and another $10,000 Canadian dollars and he forgave the two of them. Who do you think will love the master most? Simon said that's a simple equation. It's even arithmetic. It's not mathematics. I thought you were going to give me a complex quadratic equations. That one is simple, master. The simple answer, the man to whom he forgave much. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, you answered well. &gt;&gt; You are very smart. &gt;&gt; So now let's bring it home. &gt;&gt; So you invited me here since I came. You neglected me. &gt;&gt; You are minding your friends, having good times, and enjoying yourself. But guess what? Since this woman discovered me, &gt;&gt; she hasn't ceased to do this and to do that. Now, our sins, which are many &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She got the forgiveness of our sins by identification. Our sins which are many, &gt;&gt; the ones that you are building cases for, &gt;&gt; that you are trying to build scandal in the newspapers tomorrow for, they are all forgiven. &gt;&gt; When your journalists go to the press tomorrow, tell them to add this also. &gt;&gt; That was the end of the plot. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She got eternal life and she hand her place in God's kingdom by the right identification. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. Time wait for me to continue on that. Let's drop this. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Brother Bram said when the seals are opened. &gt;&gt; You know we have three phases of the ministry. Sign in the hand. The ability to tell the secret of heart healing service. Then the opening of the word. Brother Abraham said those first two things are sign &gt;&gt; and there must be a voice behind every sign. &gt;&gt; The voice is actually the one that separated the bride &gt;&gt; from the crowd that we attracted by signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; Pro Moses will expand on it. &gt;&gt; All right. But this is what I want to say. And the message anointed once at the end time. &gt;&gt; The prophet said when the seals are opened &gt;&gt; which is the opening of the word which it described as the shout in the message rapture &gt;&gt; which is the first stage of the condescension of the Lord. The coming of the Lord by which we know towards rapture and body change is a process. The prophet said that when those seals are opened, when that shout is sounded, three things will happen. &gt;&gt; One, the world will be in a sodom condition. &gt;&gt; You don't need to be told. &gt;&gt; It's all around you. &gt;&gt; Number two, James and Jambers will arise. &gt;&gt; He's presently working. That's the current revival. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anything that stands against the message of the Exodus that attacks it either from outside or from inside is by the anointing of James and Jambers. &gt;&gt; You remember James and Jabas were Egyptians &gt;&gt; who never even followed in the Exodus. You remember that? But there were those who carried the anointing &gt;&gt; and were following the Exodus. They Quran and Habiran. &gt;&gt; Aha. &gt;&gt; So there will be outside one, there will be inside one. So when you see people who have preached the message for 40, 50 years and are now attacking the message, nothing is out of place. &gt;&gt; Don't let your faith be discomforted. In fact, that should make you love the message the more &gt;&gt; that should vindicate to you the more that the message is the truth. If those things are not happening, then the sermon is not correct. Because the prophet in the message anointed once, &gt;&gt; how appropriate that message was and how appropriate it is for him to drop it in that message. He said three things will happen. &gt;&gt; The world will be in the Sodom condition. &gt;&gt; James and Jambers will arise. Then number three, there will be the revelation of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Now you must get what he meant there. He is the one that brought the revelation of the son of man. But he also told us there will be the revelation. The son of man will be revealed. &gt;&gt; What is he saying? Brother Arab said I must talk about that because that is you. Now amen. Brother Abraham said the revelation of the son of man ministry Luke 17:30 &gt;&gt; is to unite the head with the body. &gt;&gt; Christ and his bride &gt;&gt; in what? In marriage. &gt;&gt; That's right. Are you with me brethren? &gt;&gt; Why will it take the opening of the word for these three things to happen? Because brother said that is the unbeliever, the make believer and the believer being identified. Why will it take those three things to happen to be identified by the opening of the word? Because the opening of the word is the light of the hour. &gt;&gt; And every seed must interact with sunlight. Every vegetative life must interact with sunlight in order to develop &gt;&gt; in their different stages of growth and manifest the character that they are. The power of transformation is not to change a mango to an apple, but is to make an apple to grow in different stages of development until it comes to a point of fruition. So the sun is not going to change grass to wheat. &gt;&gt; Neither is it going to change mango to orange, but it's going to make each of them grow. So both the good plants and the bad plants will grow by the same sunlight. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. So because the dynamics of all this plantage plant life is in the hand of one son. &gt;&gt; All plant life manufactur their food through the process of photosynthesis by sunlight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No plant will survive good or bad without sunlight. Is that telling you something? The light of the hour must shine &gt;&gt; for every seed whether good or bad &gt;&gt; to come to fruition. &gt;&gt; So nothing is wrong with the message of the how. &gt;&gt; The message represent the only light &gt;&gt; to quicken every seed. &gt;&gt; This is why Judas's scariot needed to interact with Jesus as much as Peter needed it. By their interaction, Judas will not become Jesus. Neither will Judas will not become Peter. Neither will Peter become Judas. &gt;&gt; No matter what happened. But Peter will grow to be Peter and manifest as Peter. Judas will grow to be Judas and manifest as Judas. In fact, when Judas was ripe &gt;&gt; for his service, it was Jesus that gave him his anointing. &gt;&gt; That which thou doest, &gt;&gt; do quickly. The Bible said he gave him a sword and by the time he received the sword a strange spirit entered him. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the only person conscious of what was happening and he said Judas get busy and do your job. &gt;&gt; The dynamics of the false church, the dynamics of the true church is in the hand of only one man. The message of the hour. &gt;&gt; So there's nothing wrong with the message. But why James and Jambers are living true to their identity and unbelievers are crashing &gt;&gt; and becoming so apostate and and evil. &gt;&gt; Let us show that the bride of Christ is becoming glorious. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you if the marriage wasn't contracted brother would not have left here. &gt;&gt; I close with this line. He said, "What God sent me to do is to establish a relationship, a union between God and man, &gt;&gt; bring them in marriage." And when the prophet saw that accomplished, what did he do? He offered a thanksgiving message, invisible union. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "This message is my own thanksgiving." America was celebrating their thanksgiving. He said, "But that's not what he's celebrating now." He said, "He's celebrating his own thanksgiving." The purpose for which God brought him, &gt;&gt; he saw it accomplished. And when his purpose was accomplished, he already told us it doesn't need to be here again. That was why he preached it in November. In December, the Lord took him home. &gt;&gt; The bride came in marriage with the groom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The union is necessary. &gt;&gt; Because the bride must reproduce. He needs to encounter a male &gt;&gt; to bring forth Christ again &gt;&gt; on two feet. It is the bringing of Christ again &gt;&gt; by the unity that comes with the revelation of the son of man that is the son of man again revealed. &gt;&gt; This is the hour we are in friends. &gt;&gt; This is why we come to the church tonight. You could have been doing other things but you came to lay in the presence of the SOM to pack the seed of your husband &gt;&gt; in God's own secret place. Hallelujah. Where relationship consummation is possible so that you can be what? Impregnated by your husband to bring forth. Don't forget this job must testify. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy. The he said he must prophesy. The testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of that prophecy. You must reproduce Christ again on two feet. So you become the final revelation of the son of man. &gt;&gt; That is the message of the hour. The revealed word identifying you, blessing you in your position as the bride, as the elect. God bless you. Enjoy the journey. Shalom. [Applause] Bless you, sir. Thank you. I have a lot of homeworks to work on. But it was wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We have been blessed this evening. Amen. God has been good to us. Praise be to God. Amen. Brother Joseph will need you as well just to help me as well from time to time if you don't want mind. Praise be to God. I don't know what to add on top on top of that. I just say Lord I accept your word. &gt;&gt; I accept your word. As a as a as a pastor daily said at the beginning we come to we come to the to the house of God. It's a the place like going to the hospital either to be healed or for a checkup. Father Lord, if there is anything that is that is not correct, Father, take it away. Father, thank you for helping me to to check up my life to look into the mirror of the word to realize Lord, where am I? I want to see myself in the mirror of the word of God and say, "Oh, it's me, mama. It's me." Amen. How many want say Lord I I I want I I I want to be the revelation of Jesus Christ as Jesus Christ was the revelation of the father. I want to be the revelation of Jesus Christ. That's my desire. I I want to serve you more. I I want to search in the scripture in the volume of the book it's written of me. I want to find myself. I want to identify myself in the word of God. I want to know my place in the scripture. And as I identified it, Lord, I I want I want to hang on it. Amen. Think about that. Auntie Jeremiah. She was so sure that he is going to come. No matter what, he is going to come. Why? Because the scripture cannot be broken. The type cannot be broken. He's going to pass here. I might wait longer. I might take time, but I know he's going to pass here. Amen. &gt;&gt; The message of the Yahweh we have received can never fail. &gt;&gt; The same pillar of fire will lead us into the millennium.
