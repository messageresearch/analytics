[6:27] &gt;&gt; to to react to it. And I I I've felt a
[6:30] piece when he said it. I just felt a
[6:32] piece telling me it's done.
[6:35] &gt;&gt; It's healed and I don't have it. Um, I I
[6:39] remember a while ago when I started
[6:41] looking for a family doctor, my
[6:43] siblings, they were telling me, "Why do
[6:44] you want to find a you're not sick?" And
[6:47] I just said, "I just need to know how my
[6:49] body's doing." And they said, "Well,
[6:51] some people when they got the hospital,
[6:52] that's when they get they die because
[6:54] they were they told they told stuff and
[6:56] then it gets worse." And I said, "I'm
[6:59] not going there to look for what they
[7:00] the doctor is saying. I'm going there to
[7:02] look for what God will say about me."
[7:04] Amen.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; So as I started, I knew it's not going
[7:08] to be an easy journey because people go
[7:10] there and come back very broken. So I
[7:14] was ready for it and I just want to
[7:17] thank God for it.

[17:22] I just send a message to the musicians,
[17:24] song leaders, musicians and and
[17:27] instrumentalist those who play the
[17:29] music. It's just just amazing how
[17:32] they make a difference in our life and
[17:34] sometimes during the week and I just
[17:37] remember special that sister sang or the
[17:40] song leader sang and how it was played
[17:42] and just has been a blessing. God bless
[17:44] you richly. We appreciate you a lot.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you richly. Amen.
[17:49] Um, John 14:20
[18:01] is that maybe John 14:18.
[18:13] I will not leave you comfortless. I will
[18:16] come to you yet little while on the and
[18:21] the world seeth me no more but ye see me
[18:25] because I live you shall live also
[18:28] &gt;&gt; at that day you shall know that I am in
[18:30] the father and ye in me and I in you
[18:35] &gt;&gt; amen that's a promise for today
[18:39] as he was in the father was in him and
[18:42] he also be in us and us in him amen
[18:45] Amen.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; That's the time of union, time of
[18:48] oneness. So, we're going to listen to a
[18:50] tape of the prophet and on oneness. But
[18:52] I just before we go that just want to
[18:54] put a little bit emphasis that are
[18:56] thinking about. So listen to that tape.
[19:00] It's time of union, time of units. The
[19:03] prophet says in unity time and sign says
[19:05] we see the nations uniting. We see the
[19:08] world uniting. We see the churches
[19:10] uniting. You know we see in the world
[19:13] how things are being united all
[19:14] together. I was just reading in the news
[19:17] there the s the pope is going to be
[19:20] having a prayer with the with the king
[19:22] of England with the head of the Anglican
[19:25] church the first time after many
[19:28] centuries just to show that how the
[19:30] churches are uniting and the world are
[19:33] uniting. There are many see nations
[19:35] maybe uniting behind Trump and all
[19:37] different things. So there's a little
[19:39] bit of uniting there on the west side,
[19:42] western side and the eastern side as
[19:44] well. Uniting on that block. But it's a
[19:47] time of union. The prophet says there's
[19:50] that as the world we see in seen the
[19:51] sign. But there's also another union
[19:53] that is happening.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; There's union between God and his bride.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; And then he continued the court. He says
[19:59] we see the bride uniting uniting with
[20:02] the word. Why? The word is God. As the
[20:06] word, as the bridegroom being the word
[20:08] and the bride being the earer of the
[20:10] word, they come together in a union.
[20:14] They unite like a wedding. They're
[20:16] getting ready for a wedding. They become
[20:18] one.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; The word becomes you and you become the
[20:22] word.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's our prayer this evening.
[20:25] God, I want to become the word
[20:27] &gt;&gt; and I want the word to become me. Amen.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; As Jesus said, at that day you will know
[20:32] it. The all all the father is I am all I
[20:36] am. You are all you are. I am. In that
[20:40] day you will know that I am in the
[20:41] father. The father in me and I in you
[20:44] and you in me. The prophet says see at
[20:47] that day. What day? This day. It's this
[20:50] day. So these promises Jesus gave there.
[20:53] It's a promise for our day. Amen. We
[20:56] find out that the great hidden mysteries
[20:58] of God being revealed. Oh, I like it
[21:01] said the prophet. Amen.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; May God bless you and may just uh um
[21:06] just listen to the tape as we prepare
[21:09] for that. At the end the prophet will
[21:11] ask people to stand up. I think we you
[21:13] can stand up if you want but you can
[21:15] also just stay until it finishes and
[21:17] then we'll have our prayer time. So God
[21:19] bless you richly and listen to the tape.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; God g the elect of the earth.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; He said he'd send angels and gather
[21:30] them. Is that right? Gather them
[21:32] together.
[21:33] Separate them from the terriers.
[21:36] Amen. The terriers will be burnt, not
[21:38] the wheat.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Dry. But they're so headstrong. They're
[21:45] going to have it or not. Don't make any
[21:46] difference.
[21:49] But God's chosen ones are commanded to
[21:53] come out from among.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; Be separated, saith God. and I will
[22:00] receive you. Touch not their worldly
[22:02] things and I'll be a father to you or
[22:05] God. You'll be my sons and daughters.
[22:09] Yoke yourself not up with unbelievers.
[22:12] But come out of it.
[22:16] God wants separation from the world.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; He wants to be unionized with you
[22:22] himself. No man-made scheme of
[22:25] organization, denomination, or any
[22:27] man-made theories will ever stand. It'll
[22:29] take God the Holy Ghost in you to unite
[22:32] you to God. And how you know you got it?
[22:34] The Holy Ghost that wrote the word will
[22:36] bear record with every word. And the
[22:37] same things that the Holy Ghost did in
[22:39] the Old Testament, you'll do in the New
[22:41] Testament will do now just the same.
[22:43] Because Jesus Christ is the same
[22:45] yesterday, today, and forever. And
[22:47] you're not yolked with organizations in
[22:49] the world.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; You're not yolked with them. Yoke
[22:52] yourself not up among them, but come out
[22:54] from among them. Ye are yolked to
[22:57] Christ.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Yolked to the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[23:02] Bible says in the last days there'd be
[23:04] churches, another power of Babylite that
[23:07] have a form of godliness and to deny
[23:09] God's word and power, the power of his
[23:12] word. And what is the word? What is the
[23:14] kingdom of God? We've got to belong to
[23:16] the kingdom before we can ever be
[23:17] subjects of the king.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; How many knows that? Say amen.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Well, how do you get the kingdom? The
[23:24] kingdom of God is the word of God made
[23:26] back in power.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:31] They power
[23:34] taken away sin
[23:36] giving signs. What kind of signs? If
[23:40] it's the same word that brought Moses
[23:42] out, it'll bring the same sign. It's the
[23:44] same thing as separated lukewarm lock.
[23:47] Now, we know Lot was lukewarm. Jesus
[23:48] said that'll be the sign of the end
[23:50] time. Lukewarm Lot sitting down there.
[23:52] He was religious. Sure. Him and his wife
[23:54] and they belong to all kinds of parties
[23:56] and he is the mayor of the city and oh
[23:58] there's a whole lot of things going on.
[23:59] He was very religious. He could
[24:00] entertain the evangelists and all of
[24:02] them come by. He was all right that way.
[24:05] Oh brother,
[24:07] he wasn't that elected.
[24:09] Look what happened.
[24:12] Why? The same God that separated and
[24:15] come to Abraham and showed him the
[24:18] vindication of his separation.
[24:20] [Music]
[24:23] Oh God, how I wish I wish I could could
[24:27] do something to let you see it.
[24:31] God showed Abraham then that he had
[24:34] separated himself. He showed him the
[24:36] vindication of it
[24:39] &gt;&gt; that he was with him and right in his
[24:41] midst. And Jesus said the same thing
[24:44] will take place in the last days.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Not a nation was Abraham.
[24:52] He is in a minority.
[24:54] But God was with him. It separated him.
[24:58] We're supposed to separate ourselves in
[24:59] this last days. You know, God gave a
[25:02] sign to Moses, to Israel, anointed
[25:04] prophet, a pillar of fire. He gave a
[25:07] sign to Abraham. He He gave a sign to
[25:09] Israel. He gave a sign to the disciples.
[25:12] Same sign every time. Same sign. Pillar
[25:15] of fire. Paul when he's on his road down
[25:16] to Damascus. There shined a pillar of
[25:19] fire before him that he put his eyes
[25:21] out, knocked him to his knees. Nobody
[25:23] else saw it. Everybody stand around.
[25:24] They didn't see it. And a voice said,
[25:26] "Saul, why do you persecute me?" He
[25:28] said, "Lord, who are you?" Said, "I'm
[25:29] Jesus."
[25:31] &gt;&gt; A sign. What was he? The apostle to the
[25:35] Gentiles.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Here we are in the end time.
[25:40] coming from the east and west, north and
[25:43] south. What are we doing? Getting ready
[25:45] for that rapture.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Getting ready for holding ourselves
[25:49] steady for a few minutes to ever fibers
[25:52] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[25:55] and she'll go up.
[26:00] calling his people together
[26:02] to himself in the true oneness with
[26:06] himself because it's his one Holy Spirit
[26:10] by one spirit are we all individually
[26:14] baptized into one body collectively the
[26:18] body of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ
[26:21] living with his spirit in our flesh is
[26:24] serving the church and doing the same
[26:26] things he did as a as a sign as an in
[26:30] sign to the world that we're in the last
[26:32] days
[26:34] &gt;&gt; getting ready for the rapture. Oh, I
[26:36] love him. Don't you?
[26:37] &gt;&gt; I got a book here yet,
[26:39] &gt;&gt; but I just can't go any longer. We're
[26:42] getting too late. Might pick it up some
[26:44] other time. We are in the end. Oneness.
[26:47] Are you so one with God? That's where
[26:50] you're going to have to be. Yeah. We're
[26:53] going to have to be one with him to let
[26:56] the mind that was in Christ be in you.
[26:59] Then Christ is on mind and you will
[27:01] recognize every word that he wrote
[27:04] that did in the apostles
[27:06] rightly dividing the scripture which is
[27:08] the truth. The Holy Spirit if it is the
[27:11] truth and he'll bear record of it by
[27:12] bringing the same sign that he gave to
[27:15] Moses. Same sign he gave to Abraham.
[27:18] Same sign he did by Christ. same sign he
[27:22] did by Paul. We're in the end time. He
[27:25] said that that would be we're in the end
[27:28] time. The church collectively is getting
[27:31] together in a union. One here and one
[27:34] there making up. He said there'll be two
[27:36] in a field. I'll take one. One there.
[27:38] Look, two in a field. That's in the
[27:40] daytime harvest. I'll take one and leave
[27:43] one. There'll be two in a bed the other
[27:45] side of the world. I'll take one and
[27:47] leave one at the coming of the son of
[27:50] man. And it's so imminent. It's so close
[27:53] at hand. Don't Don't Adam, Adam, Eve,
[27:58] Adam, I mean, cry out to you.
[28:02] Don't listen to Allah the devil anymore.
[28:05] Stay with God's word. It's thus sayeth
[28:08] the Lord. Stay with his word.
[28:12] to separate from it is breaking your
[28:15] fellowship with God. God's oneness of
[28:18] the Holy Spirit. Then if you say you got
[28:20] the Holy Spirit and it's not in agree
[28:23] with the word, then you're not oneness
[28:25] with God. This is God's oneness. When
[28:28] you the the spirit that you got agrees
[28:30] with this word and manifests this word
[28:33] and makes this word power to act the
[28:34] same way it did there. Let's say it
[28:37] together. Oneness
[28:39] &gt;&gt; oneness
[28:39] &gt;&gt; with God
[28:40] &gt;&gt; with God
[28:41] &gt;&gt; is to have
[28:42] &gt;&gt; is to have
[28:43] &gt;&gt; God's spirit
[28:44] &gt;&gt; God's spirit
[28:45] &gt;&gt; in you
[28:45] &gt;&gt; in you
[28:46] &gt;&gt; agreeing
[28:47] &gt;&gt; with the word
[28:48] &gt;&gt; with the word
[28:49] &gt;&gt; all the word
[28:50] &gt;&gt; all the world
[28:51] &gt;&gt; the whole world
[28:52] &gt;&gt; the whole world
[28:52] &gt;&gt; and to make it
[28:55] &gt;&gt; manifested
[28:56] &gt;&gt; in power
[28:58] &gt;&gt; there you are that's oneness with God
[29:00] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[29:01] &gt;&gt; when that power works in me
[29:04] &gt;&gt; and it works in you
[29:05] &gt;&gt; we are one
[29:06] &gt;&gt; hallelujah Amen.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Brother kids,
[29:11] &gt;&gt; when the power of the Holy Ghost in me
[29:14] works in you,
[29:16] &gt;&gt; there's no disagreement. The word there,
[29:19] &gt;&gt; it works.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; It makes it what it is.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; God,
[29:25] &gt;&gt; made flesh in you by his word.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; The word made power among you. Every
[29:32] word.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; Now remember, the devil takes a whole
[29:35] lot of that word. 99 and 99% of it. 99
[29:40] hundreds and 99% of that hundreds. He'll
[29:43] make it just exactly right. But then
[29:44] he'll jump off here. That's one cause of
[29:46] death right there. That breaks the chain
[29:48] right in the middle. Down you go. Every
[29:52] word. What did Jesus say? Man shall not
[29:54] live by bread alone, but by every word.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Not by a few of God's words shall he
[30:00] live. Not but 999% of it God's words,
[30:03] but by every word that proceedth out of
[30:06] the mouth of God. Man shall live by
[30:09] that. Satan took him up there and said,
[30:11] "It's written." See, it's like he said
[30:13] to Eve. It's written. It's written.
[30:18] Jesus said, "It's also written." He
[30:21] said, "It's written. He'll give the
[30:22] angels charge over thee." The Bible said
[30:25] so. Boy, he's a scholar. It's written.
[30:30] He'll give these angel charges
[30:32] concerning thee, lest the dash foot
[30:33] against stone and bury up. He said,
[30:34] "It's also written, thou shalt not tempt
[30:36] the Lord thy God."
[30:42] &gt;&gt; They said, "We got the scripture." Acts
[30:45] 19, we've been baptized with John. Paul
[30:48] had something else. He said, "That don't
[30:51] work no more."
[30:53] John only baptized, he didn't disbelieve
[30:55] John's word. He said, I'm tell you what
[30:57] John said. John said he baptized unto
[31:00] repentance, not for remission sins, the
[31:02] sacrifice hadn't been killed. He said he
[31:05] baptized unto repentance, saying, you
[31:07] should believe on him that was to come.
[31:09] And when they heard this, they were
[31:10] baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus
[31:12] Christ. Paul laid his hands upon them so
[31:15] full of the word, and the Holy Ghost
[31:16] came upon them. They be to prophesy,
[31:19] speak in tongues, magnify God, and what
[31:21] a time.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; How big a church was it? 12.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh, God don't deal in big numbers.
[31:29] He deals in honest hearts.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Let us have that kind of a heart. Do you
[31:33] love him?
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[31:42] Oh my beloved wonderer,
[31:46] have you looked at the daughters of
[31:48] Moab?
[31:49] Or have you seen the daughters? I'm
[31:51] talking of churches
[31:53] of Cain.
[31:55] how far off of the word they stray.
[31:59] Have you, my
[32:02] precious friend, have you noticed in the
[32:04] last days that these things has come to
[32:07] pass? Have you been noticing recently
[32:10] about how the word of God has been made
[32:12] manifest?
[32:14] How that the revival that did once
[32:17] strike has quietened down? There's not
[32:20] much left. What is it? It's a low before
[32:23] the storm.
[32:25] The judgments are ready. Have you been
[32:28] denoting these things? Have you compared
[32:30] scripture with scripture, Bible word
[32:32] with Bible word, evidence with evidence?
[32:35] Have you compared the word of Jesus that
[32:38] he said that the devil in the last days
[32:40] would be so close like the real thing to
[32:42] if it was possible
[32:45] he would deceive everyone
[32:48] except the elected?
[32:51] the elected one
[32:54] just think that scriptural teaching is
[32:56] going to be so close.
[33:00] Oh, we believe in the Holy Ghost. Bless
[33:02] God forever. We got the Holy Ghost. We
[33:03] speak in tongues and then turn around
[33:05] deny the word.
[33:09] Yeah.
[33:11] Will deceive the very elected if
[33:14] possible.
[33:15] If there is someone in here that's not
[33:17] right with God, if there's someone in
[33:19] here that's sick or afflicted,
[33:21] these handkerchiefs and things laying
[33:23] here to pray over,
[33:25] I don't care what you have need of.
[33:27] Every promise in the book belongs to
[33:29] you. It's yours. I've brought you the
[33:32] word. Brought it from Genesis plum down
[33:34] to this day we're living in.
[33:37] Just hitting the places and showing you
[33:39] many hundreds of places I could have hit
[33:41] besides that. I don't have time.
[33:43] But surely in that you can see that this
[33:46] organization stuff is out. It's a false
[33:50] conception of the devil trying to
[33:52] organize man with the unity of their own
[33:54] mind and thinking
[33:57] when it's the Holy Spirit that we're
[33:58] joined to God as one by. And the Holy
[34:01] Spirit agrees with the word of God. See
[34:03] the Bible said Jesus said that they'd
[34:05] even confess it. You see, deceive the
[34:07] very elected if possible.
[34:11] You see where we're standing now? Pick
[34:13] up this word of God and that hand of
[34:16] faith. What do you have need of this
[34:18] morning? You have need of water baptism
[34:21] in the name of Jesus Christ, the pool's
[34:23] open. You have need of the baptism of
[34:25] the Holy Ghost, he's trying to press his
[34:27] way into you.
[34:30] You have need of healing while the very
[34:32] Holy Ghost himself, the word that's been
[34:35] made power is right here now.
[34:38] The very power of discernment looking
[34:40] out upon this audience right now and
[34:42] seeing that light whirling around like a
[34:45] globe.
[34:48] Have I ever told you anything wrong?
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Have I ever as as a prophet said to
[34:54] Israel before they got him a man-made
[34:56] king?
[34:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Have I ever told you anything?
[34:59] Have I ever took your money? Have I ever
[35:00] come down and begged you for money and
[35:02] and ride around and live in great big
[35:05] palaces and build great big things and
[35:07] take your money from you? Have I ever
[35:08] asked you for a penny? Never.
[35:11] Have I ever told you anything in the
[35:15] name of the Lord, but what God brought
[35:17] it to pass? Have I ever spoke in his
[35:20] name or what it was so? Have I ever told
[35:22] you a vision over the audience for what
[35:24] was exactly the person raised up
[35:26] stranger or whatever he might be but
[35:28] what if he said that's the truth. Have I
[35:30] ever told you anything went wrong? And
[35:33] let me tell you now
[35:36] thus saith the Lord.
[35:41] Receive the Holy Ghost, the spirit that
[35:45] will take the word of God in them hands
[35:46] of faith. Move out on earth. The whole
[35:50] kingdom belongs to you. It's yours,
[35:53] children. Why do you come from Georgia,
[35:56] from across the country, from Ohio, from
[35:58] Kansas, everywhere for a little meeting?
[36:01] I think the tape's off now. So, I can
[36:04] say this. See, why are you coming like
[36:07] this? What makes you do it?
[36:10] What is it? I see people here from
[36:13] Arkansas, from hundreds of miles away.
[36:16] last night coming and plum in from
[36:17] Kansas City. A little Polish brother
[36:19] standing back there come led said,
[36:21] "Brother Bramson, first heard you back
[36:23] down in Kansas many years ago. The
[36:25] things that you've seen and done, I've
[36:27] checked them right through right back
[36:28] and forth up and down and said, "Not one
[36:31] of them has ever been wrong."
[36:34] He's probably Polish Catholic.
[36:37] Here he comes taking the tapes, going
[36:40] out and playing them, meeting opposition
[36:42] ministers who ought to be with me and
[36:44] helping us.
[36:45] but denying the power thereof, denying
[36:48] the truth of the word, and claiming to
[36:50] have the Holy Ghost.
[36:54] I have not called myself a prophet.
[36:56] You've done that.
[36:59] But if it is so, then where does the
[37:00] word of the Lord come from? How do we
[37:02] know whether it's true or not? Unless
[37:04] there's something to back it up. That's
[37:05] God's word. You're the written word.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; And then if the written word is backed
[37:09] up, then it's God in that word making
[37:11] that word truth.
[37:13] Paul said, "Follow me as I follow
[37:15] Christ."
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Now, if you got a need of God for
[37:20] sickness, for salvation, what or get rid
[37:24] Some of you women that hasn't got the
[37:25] grace enough to let your hair grow. Some
[37:28] of you men that hasn't got grace enough
[37:29] to quit smoking cigarettes.
[37:32] Some of you preachers hasn't got grace
[37:33] enough to accept the truth of the water
[37:35] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ.
[37:37] Some of you sick people sick and sick to
[37:40] die.
[37:42] Why don't you take this word this
[37:43] morning?
[37:45] I'll tell you now, it's flesh among us.
[37:48] Take that word in your hand. Your hands
[37:50] a picture on the wall of the angel of
[37:52] the Lord. The same one that led the
[37:54] children of Israel. Same one that met
[37:57] Paul. The same one that was in Christ.
[37:59] And the same Holy Spirit is in you. In
[38:03] you. Uniting you as one.
[38:06] What makes our hearts draw together for
[38:08] hundreds of miles?
[38:11] There's nothing like it in the country.
[38:14] Come into the word.
[38:16] There is a fountain filled with blood
[38:19] drawn from Emanuel's veins where
[38:22] unbelievers plunged beneath the flood
[38:24] and lose all their guilty standing.
[38:27] Ever since by faith I saw that stream,
[38:30] thy flowing moon is supplied. Redeeming
[38:33] love has been my theme and shall be till
[38:35] I die. Our heavenly father
[38:39] laying here is a bunch of handkerchiefs,
[38:41] gloves.
[38:43] They may go out in the mail. I don't
[38:45] know who laid them here. Maybe Billy,
[38:46] maybe the people here in the audience.
[38:50] I just feel to do this now. Lord,
[38:53] there's nothing in my hands,
[38:56] nothing in me as a human being. I
[39:00] couldn't rely upon my own human
[39:02] understanding. I don't understand why
[39:04] this is so, but I'm following what you
[39:07] said. They took from the body of Paul.
[39:10] Handkerchiefs and aprons
[39:13] and evil spirits went out of the people.
[39:16] It wasn't because he was a great man. It
[39:20] was because that God was with him in
[39:22] word and power.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he never consulted the
[39:27] apostles but found out when they met
[39:28] together that the same gospel, the same
[39:31] form of baptism, the same everything
[39:34] that they were doing was eye to eye the
[39:36] same.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Now I'm asking Lord for these precious
[39:40] people that's believing you that you'll
[39:42] heal them. Them in the audience, heal
[39:46] them, Lord. May their faith just reach
[39:48] up and get a hold of that word right now
[39:51] and say, "Tumor, sickness, evil,
[39:55] you might as well leave. I'm cutting
[39:57] with the sword of God. I'm believing. My
[40:00] faith is strong. I'm pressing the sword
[40:02] deep. Move out of my way. I'm rising
[40:06] from my seat to be well. I'm laying my
[40:09] hand upon my father, upon my sister, my
[40:12] child, upon my neighbor.
[40:16] I'm believing
[40:18] your word is truth. I'm in oneness with
[40:21] you.
[40:23] The works that you said that you did, we
[40:25] do also. Lord God, I believe every word
[40:29] and I'm coming forward. Coming forward
[40:32] to claim it, to pick it up this morning.
[40:36] Oh God, why I can think when the church
[40:38] was on the move, when Moses got a little
[40:40] scared down there at the sea, he began
[40:42] to cry to the Lord. And the Lord said,
[40:44] "Why are you crying to me?
[40:47] Why are you crying to me?
[40:50] Speak and go forward. Haven't I
[40:53] commissioned you to the job?
[40:56] Speak. Speak what? The word of God. It's
[40:59] in you.
[41:02] Speak and go forward. Don't cry unto me.
[41:05] Go forward. Lord God, today I come in
[41:09] the name of the Lord Jesus.
[41:12] I come yielding this sword of faith,
[41:15] claiming the oneness of God in man by
[41:18] the Holy Ghost through the mercies and
[41:20] sacrifice of Jesus Christ, his son. I
[41:23] defy every devil that's bound anybody in
[41:26] any way in this building, whether he be
[41:29] boy or girl, man or woman.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; I defy every sickness.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; I defy every doubt.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; I defy every fear. I defy everything
[41:40] that's ungodly.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Leave this audience in the name of Jesus
[41:44] Christ. Come out of this audience
[41:46] &gt;&gt; that we can be one with God and can
[41:50] serve God without sickness or fear.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; May the power that made us one with God.
[41:58] How can that devil squawk himself around
[42:00] of the anointed?
[42:03] How can that devil stand out there and
[42:07] squawk himself like a Goliath
[42:11] when David come into the camp and said,
[42:13] "You mean you let that uncircumcised
[42:15] Philistine stand there and defy the
[42:18] armies of the living God?"
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Oh God, make man and women rise in the
[42:23] power of the spirit.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let that unconverted, that
[42:27] dejected devil that's harmed the human
[42:30] race down to the age stand here and
[42:33] defile the church of the living God.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Satan, come out and leave in the name of
[42:38] Jesus Christ. Jesus,
[42:42] &gt;&gt; bless your name.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Now you that's got strength enough to
[42:48] yield a sword.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. Now that you've got
[42:52] understanding enough in God's word to
[42:54] claim it to be your personal property,
[42:57] &gt;&gt; who can pick up the word of God now in
[43:00] your hand?
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Hold it out in the hand of faith and
[43:03] say, "I'll take my side with the Lord."
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; I'll be on this with my God from this
[43:09] on. I'll heal this sort of spirit in
[43:12] this word and I'll cut the devil to
[43:14] every promise that God promised me.
[43:17] If you believe that with all your heart,
[43:20] &gt;&gt; I ask you then sincerely with all my
[43:22] heart in the name of Jesus Christ, stand
[43:25] to your feet and accept.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Praise this one.
[43:36] Hallelujah.
[43:39] Hallelujah.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Do you mean it?
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Are you sincere? God's
[43:45] &gt;&gt; is a word in your hand.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Is your hand your faith?
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Raise your physical hand to God. Say,
[43:53] "God, by this, by my uplifted hand, I
[43:56] pledge all my life. I pledge my soul. I
[44:00] pledge my thinking. I pledge everything
[44:02] to the word of God. Let the Holy Spirit
[44:06] take my faith now and give to me the
[44:08] thing. Cut every doubt away from me.
[44:12] By faith, I receive the promise that I
[44:16] asked for this morning.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Let this membership.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; If you believe it, say amen now.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Say amen again.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And amen.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to Jesus. Hallelujah.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Then if you mean that with all your
[44:32] heart in the name of Jesus Christ, I
[44:35] promise you what you ask.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Believe it with all your heart.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:41] God bless you brother.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.

[1:18:03] precious heavenly father, Lord Jesus
[1:18:06] Christ, that's what we are claiming Lord
[1:18:08] this evening. We claim the blood of
[1:18:10] Jesus Christ. Father, that by your
[1:18:13] stripes we are already healed. That
[1:18:16] blood has not lost its power. Father,
[1:18:18] it's still real. It's still working.
[1:18:21] Father, Lord Jesus Christ. We thank you,
[1:18:23] Father Lord, this evening, Lord, as the
[1:18:25] prophet pronounced the blessings upon
[1:18:28] the elect, upon the bride of Jesus
[1:18:30] Christ because of the word of God that
[1:18:33] came, Father Lord, so that we can be
[1:18:35] united with the word of God. Father, he
[1:18:38] proclaimed healing upon us. He
[1:18:40] proclaimed, Father Lord, the salvation
[1:18:42] upon us. He proclaimed, Father Lord,
[1:18:44] that because the kingdom of God is
[1:18:47] within us by the Holy Spirit, Father
[1:18:49] Lord, we believe, we accept the word of
[1:18:51] God. Father, we accept what the blood of
[1:18:54] Jesus Christ was already purchased for
[1:18:56] us for the healings, for the needs, for
[1:18:59] salvation, for the baptism of the Holy
[1:19:02] Ghost, for deliverance. Oh father, Lord
[1:19:04] Jesus Christ. Oh God, we pray and accept
[1:19:07] what you have already done. Lord, we
[1:19:09] praise you. We glorify your name. We
[1:19:12] thank you, Father, for the peace. We
[1:19:14] thank you, Father, Lord, for the comfort
[1:19:16] you put in our heart to know that your
[1:19:18] word is here. Amen. God, give us the
[1:19:21] patience. Give us, Lord, the faith that
[1:19:23] we can, Lord, grasp the promise of God.
[1:19:26] We love you, Lord Jesus Christ. We
[1:19:28] glorify your name. Father, we thank you
[1:19:30] for the oneness that you are performing
[1:19:33] now, Lord Jesus Christ. The word
[1:19:35] becoming us and us becoming the word.
[1:19:38] You said, "Father, if you abide in my
[1:19:40] word and my words abide in you, you
[1:19:42] shall ask whatever you have need us and
[1:19:44] it shall be given unto you, Lord. We
[1:19:46] thank you for the word of God abiding in
[1:19:48] us, Lord Jesus Christ." Oh God, because
[1:19:51] of the word of God, we proclaim healing
[1:19:54] upon our loved ones, Lord, upon the
[1:19:56] church, Lord, this evening, Lord, upon,
[1:19:59] Father, Lord, the families, the churches
[1:20:01] around us, Father Lord. We pray God
[1:20:04] Jesus Christ for all the requests that
[1:20:05] have been made for those who are here
[1:20:07] and for those who are far off. Lord
[1:20:09] Jesus Christ the same power of God will
[1:20:12] touch them. The same healing power will
[1:20:14] touch them. Father will hear testimonies
[1:20:17] more and more Lord because you have the
[1:20:19] last word. You have the last word for
[1:20:22] every situation. You have the best
[1:20:24] report and your report says by your
[1:20:27] stripes we are healed. Your report says
[1:20:30] our children are saved. Your report
[1:20:32] says, Father, our spouses are saved,
[1:20:34] Father. Your report says, Lord Jesus
[1:20:36] Christ, more of you, more of the Holy
[1:20:39] Ghost. We love you. We appreciate you,
[1:20:41] Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you, Father.
[1:20:43] Lord Jesus Christ. May you bless, Lord,
[1:20:45] even every person, every church, every
[1:20:47] head of home. Lord Jesus Christ, as we
[1:20:50] commit ourself to you, as we go our
[1:20:52] separate ways, Lord, we just want to
[1:20:54] remember the promise of God that we are
[1:20:56] walking with you, that we are one with
[1:20:58] you, Lord Jesus Christ. You have been
[1:21:00] restoring the oneness with you. We
[1:21:03] accept it. We love it, Lord. And we
[1:21:05] desire to abide in you because without
[1:21:08] you, we are nothing. Rely only on your
[1:21:10] grace, your mercy. Bless your people,
[1:21:12] Father, in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
