Summary of the Sermon: “The Election of Grace”

In this sermon, Brother Moses Ndala teaches that the foundation of the Christian life is God’s sovereign grace, not human effort. He begins with Deuteronomy 7:6–8, where God tells Israel that He chose them not because they were strong or numerous, but simply because He loved them “for you were the fewest of all people… but because the Lord loved you” 

Brother Moses explains that this same love now applies to spiritual Israel—the Bride of Jesus Christ. Natural Israel was loved and protected despite weakness, and believers today should rest in the same confidence: “I didn’t choose Him, He chose me… it’s by grace that I’ve been redeemed” 

This truth should bring comfort, joy, and stability to every believer.

Brother Moses then shows how God’s grace operated in the lives of Abraham and Paul. Abraham was not chosen because of works or worthiness, but because of God’s sovereign decision: “God just put His eyes upon Abraham… What have you done? Nothing.” 

Likewise, Paul—formerly a persecutor—could only say, “By the grace of God I am what I am” (1 Corinthians 15:10). Brother Ndala emphasizes that believers today are placed in this final age by that same grace: “Are you better than Paul? No. But God has put you by grace in that age… to magnify how great He is.” 

This echoes Brother Branham’s teaching that the Bride is God’s sovereign choice, made before the foundation of the world.

The sermon then reminds believers that grace not only saves, but keeps, shapes, guides, and restores. Brother Moses gives simple personal examples—God sparing him in danger, waking him while driving, correcting him when he once cheated on an exam, and blessing him when he acted honestly.

He ties this to Scriptures such as Ephesians 2:8–9 and Romans 11:5–6, showing that salvation and spiritual growth are entirely God’s unearned favor, not human merit. Even trials, he says, are guided by grace...

And whenever he there were times that he would he'll be quick, he go before that thing happens, everything before everything falls in line, and it would never work.

You no wonder some people just kill themselves because you'll be dealing with it's a personal thing, you know. It's just like faith. You faith is a personal thing.

I'll go to the word of God as I only have a few moments here and u just want to convey the greetings of brother Victor as well and just want to called me today and we've been exchanging before time difference but we managed to talk today confirming that it's coming this weekend and just thank God for that. that will be here and thank God and if I if I had known a little bit earlier confirmation a little bit earlier the schedule could have been a little bit different but since I was not sure so many unpredictability in Africa so just I wanted to let him until things get sorted out and confirmed and it'll be on on on Sunday on Wednesday on on on Saturday and on Sunday we're going to meet and then talk a little bit more but we are happy that he's here unfortunately sister day be staying and in Africa so so we we'll talk more find out but we are happy that Lis is here can help us well and when I'm away can help um I don't know if you put the announcement I didn't but I probably put the announcement we have so we have service on brother Jeanasi will take the service on on on this coming Sunday and um and after that be brother Steven do I'll be away brother Gideon Gideon and the 30th the 30th I'll be back so we'll talk um a bit with we'll talk a bit more with um with with brother see take that service but um if he's not there I might take it as well and then after that brother Nelson brother Nelson actually wanted to take the 30th but I said no I'll be away so much but can't take that one so pushed him back on the 7th but at 7th we might have communion as well it's the Sunday of communion that fall on that Sunday so just confirm when you come back it my for his birthday. He has been has been planning shall I say it? Can I say it? Can I say it? He's been planning a batism on his birthday. So that thank God for that. So he's a little bit sad when I said communion because it's going to interfere with desire of baptism. But just keep that in the Lord's in the Lord's hand. Amen. Um besides that, I invite you to go to Deuteronomy chapter 7. Let's continue praying for brother Ed. seems to be it looks good and still looks good and everything but um certainly behind the scene it's affecting him just need to keep him in prayer. Amen. Deuteronomy chapter 7 verse verse six say for thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth. Amen. Amen. The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you because you were more in number than any people, for you were the fewest of all people. But because the Lord loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had swn unto your fathers, had the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of the bond man, from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. May God bless you and have your seat. Amen. before I travel and before I just felt like to touch a little bit on the on God's grace for a moment here and uh as you stay and might uh whatever whichever the Lord will feel to lead and speak um might be correction might be instruction might be wherever the Lord chooses to go as a as well be away and just f want to I just felt to leave a little bit of foundation of grace so that um so that yeah so that you know remember that it's by grace that God saved you and God chose you. Amen. and u and but but the zik is there he will be closing and so he will be if it's too hot he will be putting a little bit of oil so that people don't go heads down so so he's a pastor he knows how to to handle it but just felt to to leave that foundation so just in case anything hard the lord will lead but still it's we just leave that to the lord to lead. But the church, like I said, it's a good church. You you're mature, you know, you accept whichever God leads. It's just you accept it and say, "Amen." Thank you, Lord, for correction. Um, but I just fa to speak a bit of an on grace. As he as he's speaking to Israel, he says, "Thought and holy people unto the Lord thy God. The God that God has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself." So, it's God's choosing. So the election is of grace is God's choosing. God has chosen them. God has has put his eyes upon Israel because he wanted them to be special unto himself above all other people that are upon the earth. This natural Israel and he loved them. The Bible says God did not did not set his love upon Israel nor choose Israel because they were more in number than any other people. But but he says you are the fewest of all the people. In other words, you can say you you you are maybe even the weakest of all the people. Moses will call them stiff stiff necked people. But but God still loved them. God still chose them. God still prefer them above any other people to the point that even today if you say one word against Israel, if you curse Israel, you are you there's a curse upon you. If you bless Israel, you are blessed. just to show how much God loved them. He still loves them. Amen. That's that the love of God. And the same now that's in the natural Israel. Now think about the spiritual Israel. Think about you and I. You know that Israel Israel when they will be restored. There will be the 144,000. They will be restored. They'll be restored. But there will still be the servants. But you and I, we are the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. We have special importance in the eyes of God. Amen. And to realize that it should give us comfort. To realize that should give us rest. To realize that should give us joy. Amen. To know that I'm so special in the eyes of God. Amen. I didn't choose him. He chose me. It's by grace that I'm being saved. By grace that I've been redeemed because he chose me. The same way that he chose Israel even chose me. Amen. Says because the Lord loved thee. Because the Lord loved Israel. the same thing for you and me because the Lord loved you. Amen. Praise be to God. God chose Israel not because of their size, not because of their power, not because of their special qualities. No, he chose them just the way they were simple people. But God loved them. Amen. God loved Abraham not because Abraham was special. Not Abraham was intellectual. Abraham did a lot of actions or or did a lot of good things or good services. No, God just put his eyes upon Abraham to Gabbraham, I love you. I choose you and I will give you an inheritance. Amen. What have you done? Nothing. But I will give you I will make you a father of nations. Amen. Wow. Why Abraham? Yes. Because God is sovereign and his grace is sovereign. He has put his eyes upon Abraham and he loved Abraham. Glory to God. Praise be to God. Amen. Paul will take that. It says in 1 Corinthians 15 1:10 says, "For I am the least of the all the apostles." Think about it. Apostle Paul was the one who persecuted the Christians. the one who was who was even approving the killing of Stephen, he was the one who's he was putting them in jails doing so evil things to the point where when God God saved him or met him on the way to the to Damascus and then then and then and he told his prophet no you have to go and pray for Paul the prophet even have to question God are you really sure I'm putting my terms there are you really is the one was killing how can I go and bless him. No, no, no. That's beyond my understanding. In other words, if if Satan is looking and see how God has done in your life, you look behind. But this is the person was lying. It was a person was stealing. The person was doing these bad things. How can you save them? They don't deserve it. Yes, they don't deserve it. But my grace is upon them. I have chosen them. Praise be to God. He says, I have chosen him and he has a great work to do for me. Glory be to God. God could have put in you in the first age, on the second age, on the third age, but he put you in the seventh age for you to experience the rapture. Are you better than Paul? No. But God has put you by grace in that age. Amen. To magnify how great he is. God delight himself in his grace. Glory to God. Praise be to God. Then he says, "I'm the least of the apostles and I'm not meant to be called an apostle, but because I persecuted the church of God, but by the grace of God, I am what I am." Who are you? How come you are what you are? It's not me. It's the grace of God in my life. We are nothing outside of God's grace. Amen. I like that song. Crisism song. I see the that that's not my righteousness. It's God's righteousness. Amen. Where would I be if God's grace didn't meet me? Where would I be? Would be all lost. No one can present himself before God as being righteous. It's only God's grace. And he says, "And his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than they all." Says, "Why? Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me." Amen. In other words, we say the grace of God has labored a lot through me. How can you do those things? It's not me. Amen. Once you have the revelation of the grace of God, actually you don't become arrogant. When you have the revelation of the grace of God, realize that it's not you. It was only given to you by God's desire and God's purpose, God's election. Everything is about God electing. We didn't choose him. He chose us. Look at the disciples. It they didn't choose him. They were not looking for him. They so we we we all we are looking everywhere for you and then we found you. No, it was him going around and said you I choose you. You I choose you. You I choose you. Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. The same thing for you. Amen. Sometimes we Oh, I hope that we don't forget that someone who talks to you and share with you a book of the message and share with you. Oh, it was God's grace coming to you and calling you. Amen. Many people the word of God has been shared to them, but it just passed over their head. They don't understand. They don't know. Well, what are you believing? Are you a cult? And they don't understand. But God put something inside of you that can respond to that. Says, "Oh, that's my name being called." Amen. When the message is being preached, your name is being called. The mystery reveal. It's your name. Amen. You can identify to that. What identification? Your name is your identification. Amen. The message when it's being preached, you identify to that. That's my identification. That me that correspond to the truth. How come they don't see it? I see it so clearly. Amen. God's grace. It's like an image in a sculpture. You know, sometimes they put an image in a sculpture. Can't you see brother in that mountain there? You know, I was showing to my kids one. Can't you see, brother? I don't see daddy. I don't see. I don't see. Then one of them caught it. So, oh, I see it. The other ones, but I don't see at all. I don't see. And then finally, oh, I see. I see. I see. Oh, I see. I see. Amen. Praise be to God. The same thing with the message of the hour. People don't see it, but you see it. Oh, I see. My name is written in the book of life. No one can erase it. Amen. Even my own mistakes, even your own decisions cannot erase your name from the lamb's book of life. Amen. You might try, you might try, but he will pull you. You have already swollen the bait. You can't go nowhere. You will just hurt yourself. You will come back no matter what. Amen. That's the power of the election of the grace of God in your life. You can't send yourself to hell. Impossible. If you are the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ, you will come back no matter what because his purpose of election must be fulfilled. Praise be to God. Oh, we thank God for that. So when you are coming into prayer, you don't come begging. So God change your plan, make me your son, make me your daughter today. No, you are a daughter of God. You are a son of God. Keep believing what God has promised. God, thank you for your grace in my life. I thank you for your grace. Your grace changed me. Your grace called me. Your grace justified me. Your grace sanctified me. Your grace gave me the Holy Ghost. Your grace healed me. Your grace will provide to my needs. Your grace will give me the rapture. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Amen. With the grace of God, you don't come to prove to God that you are a son of God. You don't come to God to prove that you are a Christian. Lord, I want to prove that I'm a Christian, so accept me. No, no, no, no. He accept you and then he prove that you already accept you. So your life that you are living, it's proving that he already accepted me. You're not living to be accepted. No, you have been accepted and then you are proving that you have been accepted. God chose you before. Amen. Glory to God. Our attitude is not God, I want to show that you can choose me now. No, no, no, no. God already chose you and now God, I live the life I'm living because you expressed to me that you chose me. That's why he was telling to Israel and they made the biggest mistakes. Oh no God, I want to choose the law so I can prove to you that I can do something to you and then then then you can choose me. And I said, "No, no, no. That's the greatest mistake. I've given you a prophet. I've given you the pillow fire. I given you the cloud." Doesn't that represent something to you? I've given you all these things. Now you have to accept in it and walk in it. Wherever the clouds go, you go. Wherever the purifier goes, you go. Amen. That's your grace. Amen. That's what we have accepted. Amen. We are accepting the word of God. We just follow where the where the word of God says. See the word says this. We say amen. The purifier goes there. We say amen. Amen. We we want healing. We just we just look at that so at the present serpent. Look and see. Look and live. We look at it and we are healed. Praise be to God. Is it yourself who healed? No. It's the grace of God. Can you imagine just looking at the brazen serpent and you are healed? Wow. Wow. That's right. Moses, can you tell for two for two, thou two million people, how do you do heal? Dr. Moses, what is your prescription? My only pres prescription that I have, the Lord health all thy diseases. Amen. Oh, praise be to God. And for those who sin, what? And look, the serpent. Oh, no. That they just need to look and look and leave. Just look at us that it's provided. The same thing for us. Amen. When we come in prayer, Lord, you have already provided. Help me just to look and live. Help me to believe. Help me to accept the provided way. The provided way of grace, grace, grace, grace. When the capstone comes down, what is shouting? Grace, grace, grace, grace to the right. What is shalom to the bride? Grace. Amen. Everything is about grace. Amen. Romans 11:5 says says even even so then at this present time are there there is a remnant according to the election of grace for if by grace then it is no more of works and otherwise grace is no more grace but if it is of works then there is no more grace otherwise work is no more work then Israel had not obtained that which is it seeketh For for the election had obtained it and the rest were blinded. The election obtained it. What is going to give you perfection? Your perfection is not by yourself. Your perfection is election. Amen. Our perfection through the blood of Jesus Christ is election. Because we were elected, that's why he died. He died. He died. He He died. The lamb was slain before the foundation of the world because he could not lose us because he already predestinated us. That's why he died. Amen. Because he was already predestinated us. So the perfection was already done way before we even came. So when God is looking at you, he's not looking at you in the special time that you are going through the portion of time. He's looking at you the way he saw you before the foundation of the world. He's looking at you on the perfection. Amen. And in the time you are working through it, you are living through it and you're asking God grace and all the different things. But when you have the revelation, you Lord, I'm not trying to become something that I was not. I'm trying to become what you already made me from the beginning. I want to be what you know about me, Lord. I want to accept what the word of God says about me. The flesh is telling you something else. Amen. because it's corrupt, it perverse, it will put you down. It's telling you something different from who you are. Amen. But now by faith you are look, you are claiming what you are. Lord, I am a son of God. Lord, this thing is bothering me and these things, oh father, Lord, may you take it away because it's not part of me. It's not part of me because it's not part of you. I am part of you, Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise be to God for his grace. Amen. I like what Paul says. For by grace I am what I am. And his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain. The grace was not found vain. For grace in in Paul was not found vain. God's grace is not empty. Is not ineffective in in those who receive it by by faith. It transforms. God's grace transforms. God grace redeems. God's grace sustains us. It's marvelous indeed to look back on on on one's life and see the grace that was born that has borne fruit. Amen. First Corinthians 15:15. For by grace of God I am what I am. And his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain. The grace in your life is not in vain. The grace in my life is not in vain because it has done great things. Today God has done great things and it is still producing great things. God's grace in our life has produced faith has produced humility has produced good works. Amen. God's grace like he said in Ephesians 2 8:9 for by grace are you saved through faith and not of yourself. It is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast. Amen. It just shows that salvation, every spiritual blessings come not from our merit but it's from God God unearned favor. All is just God's grace in our life. The good works you can do. You can be a good preacher. You can be you can be healing the sick. You can be performing all the great miracles. You can be have a gift of help. A gift of singing. Whatever you have, it's just God's grace. Amen. Glory to God. By his grace, we have been saved. His grace will save us also in the future. His grace has accompanied us through our life.

Sister brother and can help me papa mat and sister. Um I just want to thank the Lord uh for healing me. Um I was just uh cleaning out um a drawer in our bathroom or whatever and throwing out a whole bunch of stuff. Um and I found a cream that um the doctor had given me to use um on this rush that would come back um continually and um I had um given testimony before saying that um even though I I haven't seen um the healing yet um the fruits of it, I'm still claiming it and thanking the Lord. And when I saw that cream, I just I said in my heart again, I said to the Lord, I was like, I don't I don't need this. I'm not using it. I'm not allowing for there to be any credit to any doctor or to any man. The the healing goes to the Lord. The glory goes to the Lord. So, I just threw it in the garbage. And um I noticed that it spread to another part of my body, but I said to the Lord, I was like, "Just because it spread doesn't mean you're not a healer." And I just keep thanking the Lord for it. And I told the Lord that I would just give testimony again because the Lord really impressed upon my heart that as John Ryan just kept going around testifying and handing out the newspapers and thanking the Lord, that we're supposed to do that, too. So, I just want to say thank you, Lord. And um there had been a song um that had come to my heart in the morning um about um the the blood of Jesus and the stripes that he took for our healing. Um and that by his stripes we are healed. Um and uh I had wanted to sing it as a song special and it it just didn't work out at the time, but the word of the Lord is true and I just want to thank the Lord for that. So, thank you Lord for my healing. And um I just have a prayer request. Andrew had shared with me that um one of his co-workers or whatever um is going through something right now. Um and uh him and his spouse are are not in agreeance and um the man is concerned about um his marriage. And I said to Drew um at supper time tonight, I said um even if they're not serving the Lord, the Lord can still come on the scene for their marriage. And um so just remember them in your prayers, I believe that the Lord can help them to sort out their problems and to keep their marriage together. Correct. It's important. Amen. Thank you. Thank you, Sister Kine. Amen. Amen. They are blessed to have a believer working in the same company and then can bring that to the Lord. Amen. And we keep confess for your for your healing. The body shall obey the confession of your mouth. Amen.

I have to give them access to to the building and to take care of their belonging. all the the vehicles outside. I have to uh I have to monitor on computer uh doing security of every um every uh belonging to the police of Edmonton. Then I was happy because I did computer engineering, electronics and I I know that that job was mine. I did orientation, I did everything. But when I came back to uh uh from the wedding of my daughters, they never give me the job. But they were sending me one once in a while to cover people. Uh and I was doing that. Uh now a month ago they called me are you still willing this position? I said yes of course. Then they confirmed me.
