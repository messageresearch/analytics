[23:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Sister Karthy, for that song.
[23:19] That was intense.
[23:21] Um, quick story about the song we're
[23:23] about to sing. Um, it's a song that God
[23:26] gave me back
[23:29] back in 2017 when I was going through a
[23:31] blood issue. He was preparing me. That
[23:33] was before I went through a blood issue
[23:35] for two straight years. It started in
[23:38] 2019. And uh, I didn't understand the
[23:41] meaning of the song. I didn't understand
[23:43] why God gave me that song. But then
[23:45] while I was going through it, um I
[23:50] I was listening to a tape and I don't
[23:53] remember the the title of the tape, the
[23:56] the preaching, the sermon, I mean, and
[24:00] I stayed until the end and the prophet
[24:03] was praying for for the sick and he was
[24:06] discerning people's problems and it came
[24:09] across he started he started talking
[24:12] about this sister a colored sister and
[24:15] he said between you and I there's blood
[24:17] and and he was talking about my
[24:19] situation and he he prayed and from
[24:25] there
[24:26] I started getting my healing and that
[24:29] that's when I understood the meaning of
[24:31] that song. So bear with me it's not I
[24:34] didn't practice it.
[24:39] You're the
[24:45] [Music]
[24:47] healer of every pain I feel.
[24:54] The satisfier of every void within.
[25:02] You're the redeemer that came to set me
[25:05] free.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; You're the supplier of everything I
[25:13] need.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; You're the healer of every pain I feel.
[25:26] the satisfier of every void within.
[25:34] You're the redeemer that came to set me
[25:38] free.

[42:22] Psalm 136.
[42:26] It's a long long chapter, but um
[42:55] you're turning your Bible or I just have
[42:57] a suggestion that I'm thinking and maybe
[42:59] praying about it. Well, I'm thinking to
[43:02] separate the the the the Sunday school
[43:06] into two groups and the younger one and
[43:10] also I
[43:12] myself or someone else can take the
[43:16] older one maybe from 10 or 11 to to to
[43:21] whoever want to be in the Sunday school.
[43:25] I just want to take that so that to
[43:27] separate that. So we might have to
[43:29] alternate one Sunday. So I can just take
[43:32] with the older one so that the young one
[43:34] can stay with a bit of the lower class
[43:38] and then I can take someone who can
[43:41] volunteer take from 10 up. Um but just
[43:46] something to think about it and I'm
[43:48] praying about it but let's see how might
[43:50] go. um Psalm 136.
[43:55] I would like to the brother the brothers
[43:57] and to read the verse. Let's read it
[44:01] together. Um and then the sisters and
[44:04] the children to read for his mercy
[44:07] endures forever. And then the brothers
[44:10] just read and what God be have to be
[44:12] thankful about and the sisters and the
[44:15] children read for his mercy endureth
[44:18] forever. Let's start together. Oh, give
[44:22] thanks unto the Lord for he is good.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; For his mercy endures forever.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, give thanks unto the God of gods.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; For his mercy endures forever.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, give thanks to the Lord of lords.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; For his mercy endures forever.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; To him who alone doeth great wonders.

[44:48] by wisdom made the heavens,
[44:52] &gt;&gt; mercy endureth forever.

[45:13] &gt;&gt; For his mercy endureth forever. To him
[45:16] that smote Egypt in the firstborn,
[45:19] &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever,
[45:22] &gt;&gt; and brought out Israel from among them,
[45:25] &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; With a strong hand and with a stretched
[45:30] out home,
[45:31] &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; To him which divided the Red Sea into
[45:37] parts,
[45:38] &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever. and made
[45:41] Israel to pass through the midst of it.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; For his mercy endureth forever,
[45:46] &gt;&gt; but overthrew Pharaoh and his host in
[45:48] the Red Sea,
[45:50] &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; To him which led his people through the
[45:54] wilderness,

[46:24] servant,
[46:25] &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever,
[46:27] &gt;&gt; who remembered us in our law estate,
[46:30] &gt;&gt; for his mercy endures forever,
[46:32] &gt;&gt; and hath redeemed us from our enemies.
[46:36] for his mercy endures forever.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Who giveth food to all flesh
[46:41] &gt;&gt; for his mercy endures forever.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, give thanks unto the God of heaven.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; For his mercy endures.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[46:51] He's worthy to be praised. He has
[46:54] blessed us tremendously. Has been good
[46:57] to us.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; He has healed us from our sicknesses.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; He has redeemed us.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; And he's still walking with us. Amen.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will never leave you. He never
[47:07] forsake you. He will always be with you.
[47:09] Amen.

[47:19] you richly. Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; And we have your seat. Amen.
[47:28] So always be thankful to the Lord for
[47:30] what he has done in our lives.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:36] I invite you again to go to Isaiah 59.
[48:01] Isaiah 59
[48:04] familiar scripture. Just want to take it
[48:06] a bit in a different angle or maybe the
[48:09] same angle, but
[48:12] Isaiah 59
[48:15] 18
[48:17] says, "According to their deeds,
[48:19] according he will repay fury to his
[48:22] adversaries,
[48:24] recompense recompense to his enemies, to
[48:28] the islands. He will repay recompense.
[48:32] So shall they fear the name of the Lord
[48:34] from the west and his glory from the
[48:36] rising of the sun. When the enemy shall
[48:40] come in like a flood, the spirit of the
[48:43] Lord shall lift up a standard against
[48:47] him.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; So go to Lord in prayer. Let's just say
[48:52] thank you Lord. Let's just go to the
[48:53] Lord in prayer. Father, we thank you
[48:56] again Lord as we have opened the holy
[48:58] scripture. Father Lord, we
[49:02] realize that no man can help another man
[49:05] unless you use that man, Father, with
[49:07] the Holy Spirit and anoint him, Father
[49:10] Lord. So Lord, we just pray that you
[49:13] anoint the speaker, anoint the hearers,
[49:15] Lord, this morning. Lord, this has been
[49:18] a busy weekend. Maybe you are tired in
[49:20] the body and but Father, Lord Jesus
[49:23] Christ, help us to just give you a
[49:24] little bit of attention this morning.
[49:27] Just Lord, as we hear from you, Lord,
[49:29] put the men aside, the men's ideas
[49:31] aside, but you take the full preminence.
[49:34] Father, we just want to say thank you
[49:36] for what you have done in our lives,
[49:37] Lord, and continue to do. And as we
[49:40] desire just to walk with you, Father, we
[49:43] give you the glory and the honor in
[49:44] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Like to speak, share with you a small
[49:52] thought this morning.
[49:54] on the
[49:56] the standard that's raised by the spirit
[49:59] of the Lord. As the promise says there,
[50:04] when the enemy shall come
[50:06] in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord
[50:09] shall lift up a standard against him,
[50:13] against the enemy. Just put the title,
[50:16] the spirit of the Lord shall lift up the
[50:18] standard against him. the standard
[50:22] raised by the spirit of the lord. Amen.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; I just g
[50:31] a a description of what they said here
[50:34] definition of as the standard. He said
[50:37] in ancient warfare a standard was a flag
[50:40] or a banner used to rally troops or
[50:44] signal a response. So to lift out a
[50:47] standard, a standard means
[50:51] God will raise a battle flood and lead a
[50:55] counterattack or defense pushing back
[50:59] the enemy. You know when the enemy comes
[51:02] as a flood, you know the flood the flood
[51:05] is so powerful things you know the flood
[51:07] when it comes destroys everything. It
[51:10] destroys everything you have can't stand
[51:12] it. If it comes with such power, you can
[51:14] try to stop it. You can try to do
[51:16] different things. But if it is if if the
[51:20] stren if it's so powerful, you can't you
[51:22] can't stand it. It just erase
[51:24] everything. It just destroys everything.
[51:27] It's there to destroy and and sometimes
[51:30] it start very very slowly, right?
[51:34] Sometimes if if you have blocked
[51:36] everything to be just going under the
[51:38] door and slowly slowly and then the
[51:40] water will be rising rising slowly
[51:42] slowly before you realize then you have
[51:44] to to jump and you have to run away. The
[51:47] only way really if if it's so powerful
[51:50] the only way to be above the only way to
[51:53] to to to overcome it is to be above it.
[51:56] The only way to be overcome the flood is
[51:59] just to be above it and you have to fly
[52:01] above it in order to be an overcome. So
[52:04] I said that is an idea just to realize
[52:06] that when the enemy comes as a flood
[52:09] what God is asking you is that what God
[52:11] is going to do is to is just to live
[52:14] that the standard just to make you a
[52:16] little bit live above that flood just
[52:19] don't don't don't stay in the flood
[52:21] don't try to overcome it from from the
[52:23] bottom from the bottom try to go higher
[52:27] than that then we realize oh it's
[52:30] destroying other things but it can't
[52:31] destroy you because you are above the
[52:34] flood.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; So God have make sure that when the
[52:37] enemy comes as a flooding, he will lift
[52:39] up a standard. Amen. Above that flood.
[52:42] And that's the promise that God has
[52:43] given us. God can never even allow
[52:45] trials that are greater than what you
[52:47] can stand because he knows he knows that
[52:50] you can never you can never be defeated.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; He knows he can never lose you. Amen. He
[52:56] knows that he can never permit anything
[52:58] that the enemy will destroy your soul.
[53:00] He can destroy the body. He can even try
[53:03] to entertain the mind but he can never
[53:05] destroy your soul. Amen. God can never
[53:07] allow something that will make his son
[53:10] to lose his son to lose his daughter.
[53:12] That's our God. Amen.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Glory to his name.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; So when it happens when it happens we
[53:20] know when it standard when when when the
[53:22] enemy comes he comes there just to
[53:24] destroy. He's there to destroy. The
[53:27] prophet will say and I want to take this
[53:29] as a as a as actually the thought that I
[53:32] want to go from the this quote prophet
[53:34] says in the junction of time it says
[53:38] notice another thing that he did back
[53:39] there we notice it during the time of
[53:41] this great turmoil when men's heart
[53:44] begin to wax cold and away from God
[53:47] woman became such an idol when the sons
[53:50] of God seen the daughters of men when
[53:52] they were fair be became a sexual order
[53:55] it says look at Today what we are living
[53:58] in not speaking against honorable women
[54:00] no sir that God's instrument but those
[54:03] who cares not for themsel how there is
[54:05] so many in the opposite side going about
[54:08] marrying giving in marriage God said so
[54:11] God said so in the Bible Jesus said
[54:13] before Noah's time at the end there were
[54:16] marrying and giving in Mary how the
[54:18] great turmoil is in the world today and
[54:21] realize that and this is what what I
[54:23] want to put the emphasis now one thing
[54:25] that caused that the Bible said that the
[54:27] spirit great spirit came down, evil
[54:30] spirit got into these people and done
[54:33] these things and we see the same evil
[54:35] spirit working in our day. Now notice
[54:38] again that not only that but when all
[54:42] hell turns loose all heaven turns loose
[54:46] also. Amen. When the enemy comes in like
[54:49] a flat and he quotes that the spirit of
[54:52] God raise up a standard against it and
[54:54] these two forces is always showed up at
[54:57] the junction. I believe we are living in
[55:00] the time of the junction. We are living
[55:02] in the time of the junction with the
[55:04] time the junction leaving from the
[55:05] churches into going into the the the
[55:08] bride age the time of junction the time
[55:11] of sjunction for the church for the
[55:13] bride to go into the millennium. It's
[55:15] also a time of junction, precious times.
[55:17] But during those time of junctions, the
[55:20] evil spirit, the evil spirit comes in
[55:22] order to fight. But God is not just is
[55:25] not defenseless. God has to provide a
[55:28] way also to overcome the enemy.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; God has given the bride the greatest
[55:33] weapon in order to overcome the enemy.
[55:35] In the time we are living in as the
[55:37] world is getting is getting worse and
[55:39] worse and and we sometimes we put too
[55:42] much emphasis on that and sometimes for
[55:44] the good reasons the world is getting
[55:46] insane and different things it's hell
[55:49] turning loose we understand that we see
[55:51] that we realize that we see the mind of
[55:54] the people we see how they are thinking
[55:56] they're think they have lost their mind
[55:58] they can't reason properly the virtues
[56:01] have been destroyed and their mind are
[56:03] not thinking properly But the the the
[56:06] God doesn't leave the bride defenseless.
[56:08] God has provided a way. All heaven is
[56:11] also turned loose in order to give the
[56:14] bride what she needs, what she needs in
[56:17] order to overcome. Amen. Do you believe
[56:19] that? And God is making us not only to
[56:23] be the one who has to be on the defense,
[56:26] but he also has provided what we have in
[56:28] order to be on the offense. Amen. We
[56:31] have all the weapon. We got into details
[56:33] maybe further the Lord allows. Amen.
[56:43] And then it says
[56:46] and and then and then and then you go on
[56:48] and we go on on that that beginning. But
[56:51] as as as I'm just trying to put here it
[56:53] says and how can I overcome says when we
[56:56] sometimes tempted to go back many of you
[56:59] tempted to go back to the denomination
[57:01] go back and take up goes all the world
[57:03] say what denomination you belong to what
[57:06] church are you affiliated with? You are
[57:07] tempted to do that. All of us are our
[57:10] sisters are tempted to go back go back
[57:12] in join up with some of the rest of the
[57:14] churches with some of the assemblies and
[57:16] churches of God. Some of them still be
[57:18] Pentecostal. Let your hair cut off and
[57:21] dress dress just about any way you want
[57:24] to. You are tempted to do that. Go back
[57:26] and be popular with the wicked
[57:28] generation that you are living with.
[57:31] When this is the major sin in our days
[57:34] is the major sin among the people.
[57:36] Worldliness. Worldliness is the major
[57:39] sin. Because that's what the enemy comes
[57:41] and he just put a little bit of a
[57:42] worldly habit, worldly behavior, worldly
[57:46] thinking. Amen. And that's what the
[57:48] enemy is just like a flat. Sometimes you
[57:50] realize comes full force. Sometimes come
[57:52] just a little bit slowly and slowly and
[57:54] it's getting but worldliness is coming
[57:56] in and oh world but I'm still dressed
[57:58] properly and everything. Yeah. in the
[58:01] dressing properly it's it's good but
[58:03] sometimes it's just the thinking just oh
[58:05] worldly thinking or we start reasoning
[58:07] you start you start you start if if if
[58:10] you don't stay in the channel of the
[58:12] word of God if you don't stay in the
[58:13] channel of of the channel of prayer you
[58:17] might think you you might not realize it
[58:19] but you start thinking like the world
[58:20] thinks
[58:21] &gt;&gt; says oh oh you know I think we're
[58:24] talking I forgot the sisters you know oh
[58:28] you know now a sister you You you have
[58:30] to be working you know you have to be
[58:32] professional how you have to be who can
[58:35] put in a resume housewife that's that's
[58:38] old time but you don't realize it
[58:41] becomes worldly thinking a little bit of
[58:43] worldly thinking or or a man what is a
[58:46] man a real man you know you can never
[58:48] admit that you are wrong always
[58:52] you have always to be the one the chief
[58:54] the chief you cannot admit that you are
[58:55] wrong worldly thinking a little bit
[58:58] going and you don't realize it and it's
[59:00] just a little bit subtle. It's getting
[59:01] there. But it's it's worldly thinking.
[59:04] But when you stay in the channel of the
[59:06] word of God, when you stay in prayer,
[59:08] when you stay in the right atmosphere,
[59:11] then you become sensitive to the things
[59:13] that doesn't belong to the word of God.
[59:16] Oh, I can sense that that's not good.
[59:17] You know, you maybe you bit going on on
[59:21] the low part where you start easily
[59:22] criticizing easily different things and
[59:24] and then when you stay in the channel
[59:26] word of God, you become sensitive to
[59:28] that. the Holy Spirit will bring you
[59:30] back and realize, oh no, I'm a son of
[59:32] God. I should stay positive. I should
[59:35] stay confessing. Maybe you're struggling
[59:38] with a little bit of sickness. You know,
[59:39] if you don't stay in that channel of the
[59:41] word of God, you start thinking what the
[59:43] doctor says. And you start think, oh no,
[59:45] no. According to the medicine, it has
[59:47] never happened that someone can be
[59:48] healed from that and you start if you
[59:50] don't not be careful, you are carried
[59:52] away by that. Oh, how come? What's
[59:55] happening? How come I start thinking
[59:56] like the world is thinking? I'm a son of
[59:59] God. I'm a daughter of God. By his
[1:00:01] stripes, I'm healed. I stand on God
[1:00:04] promises. I know that he can never be
[1:00:06] defeated. The word of God will defeat
[1:00:08] the enemy any time under any
[1:00:11] circumstances. So stay in the word of
[1:00:13] God. The word of God is the greatest
[1:00:16] weapon that God has given you. Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; The major sin is worldliness. It is what
[1:00:25] the world is thinking. You start copying
[1:00:27] what the world is thinking. And the
[1:00:29] greatest battle have a thought is in the
[1:00:31] mind. Sometimes it's not in the flesh
[1:00:33] but it is the mind. That's why we need
[1:00:35] to be more careful. How am I thinking?
[1:00:38] Am I thinking like God is thinking? Am I
[1:00:40] thinking as the word of God says? My
[1:00:43] thought has to be God's thought. Amen.
[1:00:45] My thought has to be God's word. Amen.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:54] The message pended. Jezebel says, "An
[1:00:56] old Methodist preacher f friend of mine,
[1:00:59] brother Kelly, him and sister Kelly used
[1:01:01] to sing a song, we let down the bars. We
[1:01:03] let down the bars and we compromised.
[1:01:05] We've seen we let down the bars. The
[1:01:08] sheep got out. How did the gods get in?"
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; We are wondering how did the gods get
[1:01:14] in? How come I'm doing this thing? How
[1:01:16] come this? How come this? Why allow
[1:01:18] this? Why allow? But you let down the
[1:01:20] bars. Amen.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; You put the standard so low. Of course,
[1:01:24] the goats will get in. Of course, the
[1:01:26] sheep will get out. But no, don't put
[1:01:29] the standard low. Put the standard high.
[1:01:31] Keep it high.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Let leave the message and let it high.
[1:01:35] Let the message stand with a higher
[1:01:37] standard.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; But that's that was standard in the old
[1:01:39] times. It was you. But no, it's the
[1:01:42] message never dies. It never get
[1:01:46] expired. It's still life. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:49] Because we are leaving behind the veil,
[1:01:52] the inner veil where the mana stays
[1:01:54] fresh. The message of the hour is the
[1:01:57] one that bring us into the millennium.
[1:01:59] It can never die. It can never
[1:02:01] deteriorate. It can never be expired. It
[1:02:04] stay alive.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; So what is a standard? And then the
[1:02:10] definition in the dictionary gives again
[1:02:12] a standard is an idea or thing used as a
[1:02:14] measure a normal model in comparative
[1:02:18] evaluations. So when you have something
[1:02:20] that is a standard if if I almost I
[1:02:24] thought but I forgot you know when you
[1:02:26] you have that line if it says it is
[1:02:30] horizontal those who are in the build
[1:02:32] that that that thing that shows the
[1:02:34] level right if you put a level if it's
[1:02:37] not straight it very well if it's not
[1:02:39] straight
[1:02:40] you can't be arguing of it no but I know
[1:02:44] that I build it properly but this level
[1:02:46] is not saying that it's not straight so
[1:02:48] it's not straight it
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; because this level is the standard.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; If it shows there, that's what it shows.
[1:02:54] Amen.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; If you put in the vertical, if it shows
[1:02:57] that that no, that wall is not vertical.
[1:02:59] No matter what you say, but that
[1:03:01] standard of the level says it's not
[1:03:03] vertical. So, it's not vertical. If it
[1:03:07] says it's vertical, then it's vertical.
[1:03:09] No matter how you see it, but it looks
[1:03:12] like it's looks like according to my
[1:03:14] opinion, it's not vertical. It's not
[1:03:17] your opinion that matters. It is that
[1:03:19] standard there, that level. If it stays
[1:03:22] it vertical, it stays vertical. That
[1:03:24] what comes with the word of God. When
[1:03:26] the God says it, we just say amen.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; We might not understand. We might not
[1:03:31] see it properly. But if the word of God
[1:03:33] says amen, if the Bible says it, we just
[1:03:36] believe.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Because that's the standard. That's the
[1:03:39] level. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ himself says, "He that
[1:03:43] rejected me and received not my words
[1:03:46] and one that judgeth him the word that
[1:03:49] have ever spoken, the same shall judge
[1:03:51] him in the last days." What will judge
[1:03:54] the people? The word of God. The word of
[1:03:56] God is the standard. It's not religion.
[1:03:59] You is not a church. Is not you can't
[1:04:02] say, "Oh, this church if this church is
[1:04:04] right and then this church will be is
[1:04:05] not right." It's not about church. It's
[1:04:07] about the word of God. The word of God
[1:04:09] is the absolute. The word of God is the
[1:04:11] supreme judge. The word of God is the is
[1:04:14] the ultimate, is the referee, is the one
[1:04:17] that decides behind beyond the word of
[1:04:19] God. You you can't go beyond the word of
[1:04:22] God. If you take from the word of God,
[1:04:24] it's your own life that is being taken
[1:04:25] out because the word of God is the
[1:04:27] standard. Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Keep that in your mind. That's what John
[1:04:32] says in Revelation 11:22 says, "For I
[1:04:35] testify unto every man that hear the
[1:04:37] words of the prophecy of this book. If a
[1:04:39] man shall add unto these things, God
[1:04:41] shall add unto him the plagues that are
[1:04:44] written in this book. If any man shall
[1:04:46] take away from the words, God shall take
[1:04:48] away his part after of the book of
[1:04:51] life." So God warns against tampering
[1:04:53] with his word. Lowering the standard,
[1:04:56] watering it down or twisting it leads to
[1:04:59] judgment. You can't blow it down. You
[1:05:01] can't make it fit your traditions. You
[1:05:03] can't make it fit your thinking or your
[1:05:05] background. You can't even judge by your
[1:05:07] own experiences. No, it's the word of
[1:05:10] God. The word of God stands is the
[1:05:12] absolute. Amen. And that's why we are
[1:05:15] faithful to the word of God. We are
[1:05:17] faithful to the message of the hour
[1:05:18] because it is the standard. Amen. In
[1:05:21] this time, in order to overcome, we need
[1:05:23] to stay with the standard that God has
[1:05:26] raised. Amen. God has raised the
[1:05:28] standard in order to fight the
[1:05:30] conditions we are in. If you don't take
[1:05:32] the standard, you are bound to fail. You
[1:05:35] have to stay with the standard. The
[1:05:37] prophet will say, notice here that Jesus
[1:05:39] by the spirit in every age addresses
[1:05:41] himself to only one person relative to
[1:05:44] the word for that age. Only one
[1:05:46] messenger for each age receives what the
[1:05:49] spirit has to say to that age. And that
[1:05:52] one messenger is the messenger to the
[1:05:54] true church. So we can't add another
[1:05:57] messenger. We can't have another me.
[1:05:59] Those are the basic things but sometimes
[1:06:01] I feel so it just breaks my heart how
[1:06:05] those foundations and you see people
[1:06:07] becoming another messenger another but
[1:06:10] what those are basics I mean what what
[1:06:12] brought us in the message because we
[1:06:14] have one messenger
[1:06:16] otherwise you know I don't know we stay
[1:06:17] in determinations we have one messenger
[1:06:20] and one message and we have to stay
[1:06:22] faithful to that message not a man's
[1:06:24] idea nothing you know not man
[1:06:28] interpretation
[1:06:29] But one standard you can't be because
[1:06:32] you have the greatest church you become
[1:06:34] the one who can correct the prophet.
[1:06:35] Then then let's take John also because
[1:06:38] he had the biggest church.
[1:06:40] What is what is the reference now? What
[1:06:42] is the standard now? The word of God is
[1:06:44] the standard.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; So he speaks for God. He speaks for God
[1:06:51] by revelation to the church is both true
[1:06:53] and false. The message is then broadcast
[1:06:56] to all. But but though it is broadcast
[1:06:59] for all who come with range within range
[1:07:01] of the message that message is received
[1:07:04] individually by only a certain qualified
[1:07:08] group in a certain way. Each individual
[1:07:12] of that group is the one who has the
[1:07:14] ability to hear what the spirit is
[1:07:17] saying by way of the messenger. So the
[1:07:20] messenger, we have one messenger and
[1:07:22] each individual has to hear what the
[1:07:25] messenger says and each individual has
[1:07:27] to have a personal revelation of what
[1:07:30] the messenger says.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; You can't rely on the revelation of the
[1:07:34] church. Says, "No, I'm just part of that
[1:07:36] church and then I'm saved." No, it has
[1:07:39] to become a personal revelation. Has
[1:07:41] become individual affair with God. You
[1:07:44] have to be born again. Amen. Personally
[1:07:46] have a personal experience with God.
[1:07:48] Amen. Are you with me this morning?
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; And that's very important. Lord, reveal
[1:07:53] the word of God to me personally.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; I can't just rely on my wife. I can't
[1:07:58] rely on my husband. I can't rely on my
[1:08:00] parents. I can't rely on my children.
[1:08:02] Lord, I want a personal revelation.
[1:08:05] Lord, I want I want a I want a
[1:08:07] conference with you. I want a reality. I
[1:08:10] want a burning bush experience with you.
[1:08:12] It's required for every age, even in our
[1:08:15] age. Amen.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Are you following me? Amen.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; I know you are foreign. Thank God. Each
[1:08:20] individual of that group is the one who
[1:08:22] has the ability to hear what the spirit
[1:08:24] is saying by the way of the message.
[1:08:26] Those who hear are not getting those who
[1:08:29] hear are not getting their own private
[1:08:31] revelation. You can't say no I hear what
[1:08:34] the prophet say but now I have my own
[1:08:36] revelation. I have my own understanding
[1:08:39] of what this what is the own
[1:08:41] understanding. Yes. Is it matching what
[1:08:43] the prophet says or is it your own
[1:08:45] understanding outside of what the
[1:08:46] prophet says? Because God reveals his
[1:08:49] word only. He opens the word only to a
[1:08:52] prophet.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; He can't open the word beyond the
[1:08:56] prophet. Amen. Amen. But the prophet
[1:08:58] gives a revelation and we take that
[1:09:00] revelation. Of course, we applies it in
[1:09:03] our lives. We expand it in our life. We
[1:09:05] expand in our example in our life. The
[1:09:07] minister will take what the prophet says
[1:09:09] and make it and make it developed on it
[1:09:11] in. Oh wow. You see why it is then?
[1:09:13] Because the Bible says here, the Bible
[1:09:15] says here, the Bible say give you a lot
[1:09:17] of examples to back up what the
[1:09:19] revelation has been given to the
[1:09:20] prophet. But you don't come up with your
[1:09:22] own revelation that's outside of the
[1:09:25] blue.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:32] said those who hear are not getting
[1:09:34] their own private revelation nor is a
[1:09:36] group getting their collective
[1:09:37] revelation but each person is hearing
[1:09:39] and receiving what the messenger has
[1:09:42] already received from God says below
[1:09:46] down is seven exposition seven churches
[1:09:48] they add here and take away here and
[1:09:50] soon the message is no longer pew and
[1:09:53] the revival dies down how careful we
[1:09:56] must be to hear one voice
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; for the spirit has but one voice which
[1:10:01] is the voice of God.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Let me say brother Bam's voice is not
[1:10:07] the voice of God. The little voice is
[1:10:10] not the voice of God. But what is saying
[1:10:13] is the wall is the voice of God.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; The word of God that comes is the voice
[1:10:20] of God.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; So we have to hear the voice of God.
[1:10:24] Amen.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; So Paul warned them to say what he said
[1:10:27] even as a as Peter did. Likewise he
[1:10:30] warned them that even he Paul could not
[1:10:33] change one word of what he had given by
[1:10:35] revelation. How important it is to hear
[1:10:38] the voice of God by way of his
[1:10:40] messengers and then say that what has
[1:10:43] been given them to say to the churches.
[1:10:45] Paul gave a revelation and he said in
[1:10:48] Galatians 1 says I gave I I gave you
[1:10:50] revel. God gave me re I didn't learn
[1:10:52] that from school. I didn't learn that
[1:10:54] from different but God gave me the
[1:10:55] revelation and the revelation that God
[1:10:57] God gave me that revelation I've been
[1:11:00] preached to you and based on that
[1:11:01] revelation I even myself I can't change
[1:11:04] that revelation
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; even other ministers comes and preach
[1:11:08] something against what I've preached to
[1:11:10] you let him be cursed
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; he had the authority because he was the
[1:11:14] prophet for that age
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; and no one could preach something beyond
[1:11:18] what he has preached even himself could
[1:11:21] not contradict what he has preached
[1:11:22] because he was not his thought. It was
[1:11:24] God thought. Amen.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; People can complain say but why you it
[1:11:28] looks like you are following a man. We
[1:11:30] are not following a man. We are
[1:11:31] following the word of God. Nothing else
[1:11:34] but the word of God. But God has a way
[1:11:36] to expand himself. He uses different
[1:11:39] gift to expand himself. And the gift of
[1:11:42] opening the word of God and making it
[1:11:43] clear to the people to a generation. God
[1:11:46] uses a prophet. Amen.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we are so thankful for
[1:11:51] what God has done in our lives.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Can't you see why I'm so happy?
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Because God has given me a prophet to
[1:11:59] open the word of God. Now the Bible has
[1:12:01] become a new book for me. It's not the
[1:12:04] book of history now. Now to the reality
[1:12:06] I see myself in the book of Ruth. I Ruth
[1:12:09] I see myself in the book of Joshua. I
[1:12:12] see myself in the in in the book of
[1:12:14] Esther. the world, the Bible has become
[1:12:16] a new book to me because of what God has
[1:12:19] given us in our time.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; But it goes on and says, "Every fresh
[1:12:24] and true revival will be because men
[1:12:26] have gotten back to the word for their
[1:12:28] age. The cry of every age is the rebuke
[1:12:32] you have left the word of God. Repent
[1:12:34] and come back to the word from the first
[1:12:36] book of the Bible, Genesis, to the last
[1:12:38] book of Revelation." There is only one
[1:12:40] reason for God displeasure leaving the
[1:12:42] word. And there is only one remedy to
[1:12:45] regain his favor is going back to the
[1:12:48] word because if you leave that word you
[1:12:51] leave you left you have left God that
[1:12:54] thus he's presenting himself to the
[1:12:56] church at Pgamus and indeed all churches
[1:12:58] of your I am the word. If you want deity
[1:13:01] in your midst then welcome and receive
[1:13:04] the word. Do you want deity among you?
[1:13:07] Do you want deity in your heart? Then
[1:13:09] welcome and receive the word.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give hospitality to the word of
[1:13:14] God.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, the word of have have preminence in
[1:13:17] my house.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Have pre have a seat there. What do you
[1:13:21] want the word? Oh, the word says, you
[1:13:22] know, I want this down. I want I don't
[1:13:25] want that thing to be out in your house.
[1:13:27] Take it out. I don't want these things
[1:13:29] to take too much of your time. Those
[1:13:30] play games and take it out a little bit.
[1:13:33] Is the word having preminence and you
[1:13:35] welcome the word. Oh, thank you the
[1:13:36] word. I receive you in my house. Amen.
[1:13:41] Amen. Don't ever let anyone or anything
[1:13:44] get between you and that word.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; This which I'm giving you, the word is a
[1:13:50] revelation of myself. I am the word.
[1:13:52] Remember, I wonder and the prophet says,
[1:13:55] I wonder if we are sufficiently
[1:13:57] impressed with the word in our midst.
[1:13:59] Are we sufficiently impressed? Oh God,
[1:14:02] thank you for the word that you have
[1:14:04] given me or we take it just as a theory
[1:14:06] or knowledge based. But let it become a
[1:14:09] reality. Amen.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; I'm doing a little bit of reading here
[1:14:14] but to make a background. So when a
[1:14:16] spirit born, spiritfilled man in faith
[1:14:19] takes that word into his heart and
[1:14:21] places it upon his lips. Why? That is
[1:14:24] the same as deity speaking. What I'm
[1:14:27] trying to say is to show you the
[1:14:29] importance is to raise the standard God
[1:14:33] has to follow a process. So God send his
[1:14:36] word. He send his word. He send his
[1:14:38] prophet. You receive the prophet and you
[1:14:41] receive a prophet in the quality of a
[1:14:42] prophet you will have the reward of a
[1:14:44] prophet
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; and God has given us a prophet and the
[1:14:47] prophet the Bible comes to reveal the
[1:14:49] word of God and once you reveal the word
[1:14:51] of God people have to receive that word
[1:14:54] of God as you receive the word of God
[1:14:56] especially in our time especially in
[1:14:58] this time of the junction especially in
[1:15:00] this time where we have to go we will be
[1:15:03] going into rapture you need to receive
[1:15:05] the whole word not only a portion of the
[1:15:08] word but the whole word of God and
[1:15:11] welcome it in your heart. Amen.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; As you receive the word of God, you are
[1:15:16] receiving deity among you. Amen. That is
[1:15:19] the same as de as you receive the word
[1:15:21] of God, it must not only stay on the
[1:15:24] stage of knowledge. Must not only stay
[1:15:26] in the knowledge of the mind, but you
[1:15:28] have to put it in your heart.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Let that the word of God become reality
[1:15:32] in your heart. Once becomes reality on
[1:15:35] your heart as you speak the word of God
[1:15:37] is deity speaking. Amen. It's not a man
[1:15:40] speaking anymore. It's deity speaking.
[1:15:43] When you are saying by his stripes I'm
[1:15:45] healed. It's deity speaking.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; When you are saying my children will be
[1:15:49] saved is deity speaking. It's not your
[1:15:52] word is God's word through your lips.
[1:15:54] Amen. You become part of the word of
[1:15:56] God. You want dity among you receive the
[1:15:59] word of God. You want this to speak,
[1:16:01] speak the word of God because God is the
[1:16:04] word. The beginning was the word. God
[1:16:06] was with the word and our God is the
[1:16:08] word made flesh. Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. The
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; prophet says every mountain has to go.
[1:16:15] Satan cannot stand before that man. If
[1:16:18] the church way back there in in that
[1:16:20] third age had only held on to the
[1:16:22] revelation of the living word in their
[1:16:24] midst, the power of God would not have
[1:16:26] faded as it did in those days, in those
[1:16:29] dark ages. And right today, when the
[1:16:31] church returns to the word in faith, we
[1:16:34] can say without doubt that the glory of
[1:16:36] God and the wonderful act of God will be
[1:16:39] in her midst again. We have not received
[1:16:43] only a partial a partial interpretation
[1:16:46] or or or a man interpretation. We have
[1:16:49] received the perfect interpretation of
[1:16:52] the word of God with perfect
[1:16:54] vindication. We have received the whole
[1:16:56] word of God because we have received the
[1:16:58] whole word of God. Now the glory of God
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; and the wonderful act of God will be
[1:17:04] among his people. We should be expecting
[1:17:07] God to work mighty among us, mightily
[1:17:10] among us because we have received the
[1:17:12] word of God, the whole word of God, not
[1:17:16] the partial word of God, not a
[1:17:18] reformation. It is the full restoration
[1:17:21] of the word of God restored to the
[1:17:23] bride. Amen.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; So now
[1:17:33] there always two forces
[1:17:36] the forces of hell and the forces of
[1:17:39] heaven. I touched that on Wednesday.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Those two forces are spirits
[1:17:46] and the spirit are working and and we
[1:17:48] see that very visible.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; In the world.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Oh no,
[1:17:54] someone full of things. How what's
[1:17:56] happening? Feel sorry for that person.
[1:17:59] Sometimes I take the traum and go
[1:18:01] downtown.
[1:18:03] So uh it breaks my heart. Oh why? Why?
[1:18:07] But the person is under certain
[1:18:09] anointing and the spirit just breaks my
[1:18:13] heart to see people in that situation.
[1:18:15] So if you could only know
[1:18:18] why to have the right mind
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; and the mind of Christ.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Because they wrapped up into a certain
[1:18:25] anointing a certain spirit is taking
[1:18:27] hold of them and they just go in that
[1:18:29] direction.
[1:18:31] But now put it in a positive way. Now
[1:18:33] they're under certain spirit. But now
[1:18:36] the bride is also under certain
[1:18:38] anointing.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; God can only work through the a spirit
[1:18:42] can only work through a body
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; through a body. If the evil spirit is
[1:18:47] working through a body and they're doing
[1:18:49] those bad things, the Holy Spirit as
[1:18:51] well works through a certain body and is
[1:18:54] the body of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:57] So we have just to make ourselves
[1:18:59] available to the spirit to use us
[1:19:02] because God is looking for the bodies
[1:19:04] that can make vessels that can make
[1:19:05] themsel available and that God can use
[1:19:08] them in a mighty way. The word of God
[1:19:11] has to become flesh in the age that we
[1:19:14] are living. God wants the word of God to
[1:19:17] become flesh. He want himself to work
[1:19:20] through his bride. He is the word but he
[1:19:22] wants the word to become flesh in
[1:19:24] individuals.
[1:19:26] Not only stop at the knowledge stage,
[1:19:28] not only start intellectually, but
[1:19:30] becomes a reality, becomes flesh. I want
[1:19:34] to be the husband the word of God is
[1:19:36] talking about. I want to be the wife the
[1:19:39] word of God is talking about. I want to
[1:19:41] be the father the word is talking about.
[1:19:43] I want to be the deacon the word is
[1:19:45] talking about. In this last age, amen. I
[1:19:48] want to be the preacher the word is
[1:19:50] talking about. I want to be the a
[1:19:52] congregation member the word is talking
[1:19:54] about. Amen. A real one, total one.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; That's my desire.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Prophet, take the example of the first
[1:20:10] disciples.
[1:20:11] When the enemy comes in as a flag, I
[1:20:13] will raise up a stand against God will
[1:20:15] do it when all the gates of torment is
[1:20:18] pressing against that little church.
[1:20:20] Yet, it will never prevail. She will go
[1:20:23] right on. I think of the disciples in
[1:20:25] the early days when there are just a
[1:20:27] little handful of people with no
[1:20:30] education, no ability, earthly speaking.
[1:20:33] They had no degrees. They had they had
[1:20:35] no denomination behind them. They had
[1:20:37] nothing but one thing and that was that
[1:20:40] was the Holy Spirit that they had
[1:20:42] received on the day of Pentecost. That's
[1:20:44] why the Holy Ghost is very important.
[1:20:47] Amen.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; You can't do it on your own. You can't
[1:20:49] you can try. You can try. You can try.
[1:20:52] You are bound to fail. But when the Holy
[1:20:54] Spirit comes and take control,
[1:20:58] that's when you start talking. Amen.
[1:20:59] That's when the reality of what God want
[1:21:01] is the Holy Spirit to take control. I'm
[1:21:04] tired of of trying to pretend.
[1:21:11] Even myself, I'm I'm try sometime I'm
[1:21:13] tired to pretend. I want I I don't want
[1:21:16] to pretend. I want the reality. If I
[1:21:18] don't have it, I don't have it. And I
[1:21:20] show that I don't have it. I want more.
[1:21:23] Amen.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you pretend, you you you
[1:21:25] you're trying to hide. You you're not
[1:21:27] realizing that you are lacking something
[1:21:29] because you are pretending. I don't want
[1:21:31] to pretend anything. If I don't have it,
[1:21:33] I don't have it. If I don't have, but at
[1:21:35] least I want lo. I don't have it. I want
[1:21:38] more, Lord. I want the reality. I want
[1:21:40] the Holy Ghost. I want a refilling of
[1:21:42] the Holy Ghost. I want a rebaptism of
[1:21:45] the Holy Ghost. More and more of you.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; One brother was giving, I think it was
[1:21:49] in Winnipeg, one brother was giving a
[1:21:51] testimony. He says, "You know what?
[1:21:53] Brother Bam was was playing a tape a
[1:21:55] tape and then at the end of the tape,
[1:21:57] brother Bham said, those who want the
[1:21:58] Holy Ghost raise your hand." And and the
[1:22:03] pastor, he was a pastor. The pastor
[1:22:04] raised his hand.
[1:22:06] After service, people came, "Pastor, you
[1:22:08] don't have the Holy Ghost. How can you
[1:22:11] raise your hand?" And the prophet says,
[1:22:13] he says, "Yeah, I I believe I have the
[1:22:16] Holy Ghost, but I want more of the Holy
[1:22:19] Ghost. more and more of the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:22] Not just one feeling, but a refilling of
[1:22:24] more and more and more and more until I
[1:22:28] come to the stature of perfect man.
[1:22:30] That's what I've desire. I don't want to
[1:22:31] be stagnant and say, you know, now I'm
[1:22:33] looking for who? Raise a hand. Oh, you
[1:22:34] don't have the Holy Ghost. No God, I
[1:22:36] want more of the Holy Ghost, more of the
[1:22:39] reality, more of your life so that you
[1:22:41] can express yourself through me, Lord.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:45] Amen.
[1:22:52] says
[1:22:54] and they hear him the same go that was
[1:22:56] really didn't finish it
[1:22:59] they had no denomination behind them
[1:23:00] they had nothing but one thing and that
[1:23:02] was the Holy Spirit that had received on
[1:23:04] the day of Pentecost they didn't need no
[1:23:06] more for God had already said upon this
[1:23:09] inspiration I will build my church why
[1:23:11] the ecclesiastic world of that day was
[1:23:14] well able to shut them out the great
[1:23:16] sahedron court wouldn't have turned them
[1:23:18] down if they had been standing on their
[1:23:20] own philosophy, on their own theology.
[1:23:23] They would have smoldered out in the
[1:23:25] beginning. But 1900 years has passed and
[1:23:28] the gates of hell still is against it.
[1:23:31] But she's moving on and will be moving
[1:23:34] on for Jesus said it cannot inspire that
[1:23:39] we'll take the rich man the poor man the
[1:23:41] beggar whoever he is and set them
[1:23:43] together and call each other brother and
[1:23:46] we who will worship the Lord together
[1:23:48] without shame shame shame faith fist
[1:23:51] fist fistness shamefacness
[1:23:58] if they could not conquer them. Think
[1:23:59] about it. Those fishermen if they could
[1:24:02] not conquer them, they tried to stop
[1:24:04] them. They tried different things. This
[1:24:06] is the first age. They try even to kill
[1:24:08] them. They tried different things, but
[1:24:10] they could not they could not quench
[1:24:12] that fire. They could not destroy. They
[1:24:15] could not destroy that.
[1:24:18] You know, sometimes you go through the
[1:24:19] trial, you feel like, you know, I'm this
[1:24:22] is too much for me. I'm done. I'm I'm at
[1:24:24] the end of heaven.
[1:24:27] But something keeps like brother say
[1:24:29] something keeps drawing you. Something
[1:24:31] keeps pulling you. Something keeps
[1:24:34] making you move further. It's that thing
[1:24:36] that God put inside of you that the
[1:24:38] enemy can never take away.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; That's something that that's the
[1:24:41] precious thing that God has put inside
[1:24:43] of you that can the devil can never take
[1:24:45] away.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; But God wants us to be raised again more
[1:24:49] and more. He want to raise that more and
[1:24:51] more. He wants So if you're going to a
[1:24:53] thing, don't just put your head down.
[1:24:55] say I'm more than a conqueror. I'm more
[1:24:58] than an overcomer through Jesus Christ.
[1:25:01] If they could not conquer them in the
[1:25:02] first age, the second age and all the
[1:25:04] other age, they could not conquer Luther
[1:25:06] in the age of of Saudis, they could not
[1:25:09] conquer him in our day, they can never
[1:25:12] conquer us. They will never conquer us.
[1:25:14] Sometimes I look at my children, I look
[1:25:17] in this age of iPad and different things
[1:25:20] and oh Lord be merciful on my children.
[1:25:24] Look at them.
[1:25:25] Their mind seems like just going through
[1:25:27] that that everything is just oh lord we
[1:25:30] were not raised up in those situations.
[1:25:35] I feel a little bit kind of this not
[1:25:37] human speaking like but then something
[1:25:39] just know you know what God has given us
[1:25:42] something that is more powerful than
[1:25:44] what the enemy is trying to put in there
[1:25:45] this year. No matter how much technology
[1:25:47] they put and everything there will be a
[1:25:50] bride. There will be an overcomer. There
[1:25:52] will be a generation that will be part
[1:25:54] of the resurrection. There will be a
[1:25:56] generation that will be part of the
[1:25:57] rapture. The enemy can never conquer the
[1:26:00] bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. She is
[1:26:03] an overcomer and she will be an
[1:26:05] overcomer. Amen. Because God will give
[1:26:08] her the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is
[1:26:10] more than enough. Amen. To conquer
[1:26:12] anything that the enemy will report.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; When the enemy comes like a flood, God
[1:26:17] will raise up a standard.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:29] Prophet says, "Same Holy Ghost that
[1:26:31] saved the Lutterians,
[1:26:33] that sanctified the Methodist and
[1:26:35] baptized the Pentecostal is now setting
[1:26:37] in order the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:40] Christ. It will be so powerful that body
[1:26:43] will come into this group, a church that
[1:26:45] will draw the rest of them from the
[1:26:47] grave. There will be a resurrection.
[1:26:49] That's what the Holy Ghost is for. What
[1:26:51] is the Holy Ghost? Without us, they
[1:26:53] cannot be made perfect.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; They lived in one day. Under that, we
[1:26:57] live in another day. When the enemy
[1:26:59] comes in like a flood, the spirit of God
[1:27:02] will raise the standard against it. We
[1:27:04] are in a day now. We are the last. We
[1:27:07] are in the day now. Now, put we are the
[1:27:09] last runners in God's plan. You know,
[1:27:12] the first one they have to run. They
[1:27:13] have to run to run. But now, we are the
[1:27:16] first the last one in that race. We are
[1:27:18] the one who will go with we will go
[1:27:20] entering into the millennium. We are the
[1:27:22] one who will be carrying the battle into
[1:27:24] the rapture. We will not be defeated.
[1:27:27] Amen. No matter what the enemy is
[1:27:28] putting, we are not going to be
[1:27:30] defeated. We'll keep pressing on.
[1:27:33] Actually, God is going to raise you as
[1:27:35] part of a standard.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Says I'm raising the Holy Spirit, but
[1:27:38] that the Holy Spirit I'm putting in
[1:27:40] those individuals. No matter how weak
[1:27:42] they might appear, they will be my
[1:27:45] standard in the last age. Amen. They
[1:27:47] will be the one that will be waving say
[1:27:48] you see those ones. You see that bride
[1:27:51] in this time of laia. These are the
[1:27:54] standard I raised in that time of this
[1:27:56] year. When the enemy came as a flat I
[1:27:58] raised my sister. I say I raised that
[1:28:01] sister. I raised that sister. That
[1:28:03] brother
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; that little girl in the school she was
[1:28:06] my standard there.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; She was the one that I could say oh this
[1:28:10] is the one I have I'm pleased to dwell
[1:28:12] in. Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. If they could not
[1:28:16] overcome Peter in those days generation,
[1:28:18] they cannot overcome in this generation.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Because we are part of God.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; We are actually part of the rapture.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; The rapture cannot go without us. Amen.
[1:28:30] Because we are part of the rapture. They
[1:28:33] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:28:35] caught up together with them in the
[1:28:37] clouds. We are the one remaining. We be
[1:28:40] caught up into the rapture, man. Because
[1:28:42] the rapture, the prophet says when the
[1:28:44] bride will recognize who she is, the
[1:28:45] rapture will go. Why the rapture will
[1:28:47] go? Because you are the rapture. We are
[1:28:49] part of the rapture. We are part of the
[1:28:51] standard that God is raising in this
[1:28:53] generation.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; We are the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:01] Prophet says the way God is trying to do
[1:29:03] to his church is to beat till to beat it
[1:29:06] till it all the creeds and all the
[1:29:08] nonsense and all the world is beat out
[1:29:10] of it till it reflects back the life of
[1:29:13] Jesus Christ. Why you going through all
[1:29:16] this beating? Because God want to
[1:29:18] reflect what is inside of you. The
[1:29:20] quality that you have to reflect doesn't
[1:29:23] come from outside.
[1:29:25] The quality that's inside of you is
[1:29:27] already inside of you. Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; The beauty of Jesus Christ that you have
[1:29:31] to reflect is not coming from the
[1:29:32] outside. It is already inside of you.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; It's going through some beating of the
[1:29:37] word of God. The word of God say have to
[1:29:39] beat you sometimes and beat you and beat
[1:29:41] you and beat you. But you say they thank
[1:29:43] God for beating me. Amen. Because you
[1:29:46] are reflecting. You are removing the
[1:29:48] things of the world so that I can
[1:29:50] reflect more of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Why is he talking upon that subject
[1:29:56] again? and he goes
[1:29:58] that's my weakness why is it on that
[1:30:01] don't comp don't have that attitude but
[1:30:03] rather say God thank you Lord
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; for exposing that because you want me to
[1:30:07] reflect you more and more
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; because you want me to show the
[1:30:11] character of Christ
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; remember the church I've just come off
[1:30:14] the great meetings at home where the six
[1:30:16] seals and the sixes or seven seals or
[1:30:19] that sixth one was the purification of
[1:30:21] the church the church of course goes
[1:30:24] through the tribulation period for its
[1:30:25] purify ing the church will go through
[1:30:28] the tribulation period. But the bride is
[1:30:31] raptured is the difference between the
[1:30:33] bride and the church.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; We are don't want just to be the church.
[1:30:37] We are the bridemen
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; because the church is preparing for
[1:30:41] tribulation.
[1:30:42] You know you see in the denomination
[1:30:44] they prepare for the tribulation. Oh,
[1:30:45] let's prepare the because great
[1:30:47] tribulation is coming and that the
[1:30:49] anointing upon them and it's okay
[1:30:51] because that the anointing but the bride
[1:30:53] is not preparing for the tribulation.
[1:30:55] Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; We are going through our purification
[1:30:57] right now. The word of God is purifying
[1:31:00] us. The word of God is sanctifying us.
[1:31:02] The word of God is cleaning us. The Holy
[1:31:04] Spirit is washing us. Amen. The Holy
[1:31:06] Spirit is cleansing us, giving us the
[1:31:08] glory of Jesus Christ. Then be because
[1:31:11] we'll be part of the rapture. Amen.
[1:31:14] Prophet says, do you notice that the
[1:31:16] real church is supposed to do in the Old
[1:31:18] Testament when they had the sacrifice?
[1:31:20] They killed one bird and put the blood
[1:31:22] of one upon the other, the dead mate,
[1:31:24] and flew across the earth, spreading the
[1:31:26] blood of the of the dead mate. When the
[1:31:29] church becomes the real bride of Jesus
[1:31:31] Christ, she will carry the blood of
[1:31:33] Jesus Christ with her, sprinkling it
[1:31:35] upon the ground, calling holy, holy unto
[1:31:38] the Lord. Her atmosphere, every bit of
[1:31:41] her will be of God. Her whole makeup
[1:31:44] will be of God. You can't expect
[1:31:46] something nothing else because she's
[1:31:49] just part of God. Amen.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; You can't expect nothing else. As the
[1:31:54] prophet says, one day there will come a
[1:31:56] blast from heaven and the dead in Christ
[1:31:58] shall rise first. The denomin testament
[1:32:01] saints came back wonder who were waiting
[1:32:03] will blast forth and come off of there
[1:32:06] come come out of there first and go into
[1:32:08] the resurrection. We'll drop right in
[1:32:10] line going in the sky. these old moral
[1:32:12] bodies, mortal bodies changed and made
[1:32:15] like unto this glorious body. What a
[1:32:18] parade that will be when it starts
[1:32:20] heaven word. Some of these days as the
[1:32:23] song leader says, "Oh, what a day that
[1:32:25] will be." Some of these days it will be
[1:32:27] that day for us. That's what we are
[1:32:29] looking for. We don't just come and have
[1:32:32] a church. We are getting ready for the
[1:32:34] rapture.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, is my heart ready for the rapture?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:42] Some of these days in that rapturing
[1:32:44] time that lays ahead oh proudly
[1:32:46] displaying the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:32:48] upon their chest the message of God in
[1:32:51] the hour that they have lived in. So the
[1:32:53] message of the hour in that we have
[1:32:56] received is the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:32:59] You want to display the blood of Jesus
[1:33:01] Christ take the word of God receive it
[1:33:03] in your heart and display it in your
[1:33:05] life. That's the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:07] Because even that day what will be
[1:33:09] displaying? It will be the message of
[1:33:11] God in the hour that we have received.
[1:33:15] The promise that you will be the
[1:33:16] manifestation in my note. The promise
[1:33:18] will be that you'll be the manifestation
[1:33:20] of the word despite what the enemy says
[1:33:22] of that you will be the manifestation.
[1:33:25] This is the only letter where God is not
[1:33:27] rebuking the church of God because she
[1:33:29] is the bride. She he him. You know, when
[1:33:32] the prophet took the the the letter and
[1:33:35] the Holy Spirit inspired him, take pick
[1:33:37] up the the pen and write. As he's
[1:33:39] writing that letter to the bride, it's
[1:33:42] the only letter of the messenger God
[1:33:45] gave to the messenger. That doesn't
[1:33:46] rebuke the church. It's not rebuking
[1:33:48] you. You're not saying see what you have
[1:33:51] done. You have you allowed Jezebel. You
[1:33:53] have allowed Bellam. You have allowed
[1:33:55] different things. No, he's not rebuking.
[1:33:57] He's not saying you are lukewarm. No,
[1:33:59] he's talking to the bride. He's telling
[1:34:00] you a love letter expression of what
[1:34:03] you'll be. Listen some of them what he's
[1:34:05] telling says
[1:34:08] the law of reproduction is that each
[1:34:09] specy
[1:34:11] brings forth after its own kind even
[1:34:14] according to Genesis 1:11 that God
[1:34:16] speaking to you. So God said let the
[1:34:18] earth bring forth grass and the herb
[1:34:20] yielding sealed and the fruits tree
[1:34:22] yielding fruits of after this kind whose
[1:34:24] seed is in itself upon the earth as it
[1:34:27] was and it was so. Whatever life was in
[1:34:30] the seed came forth into a plant and
[1:34:33] dance into fruits. The very same law
[1:34:36] applies to the church today. Whatever
[1:34:39] seed started in the church will come
[1:34:41] forth and will be like the original seed
[1:34:44] because it is the same seed. In these
[1:34:47] last days, the true bride of church,
[1:34:49] Christ seed will come to the headstone
[1:34:52] and she will be the super church, a
[1:34:54] super race as she nears him. As you near
[1:34:58] the capstone, you become the super
[1:35:00] spiritual super race. They in the bride
[1:35:02] will be so much like him that you will
[1:35:05] even be in his very image. This is in
[1:35:09] order to be united with him. These are
[1:35:12] the words and expression that God is
[1:35:14] speaking to the church. Not to the
[1:35:15] church, to the bride. There's a
[1:35:17] difference between the church and the
[1:35:18] bride. God is speaking to the bride.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; The bride is only the elect that can be
[1:35:23] part of the rapture.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. The church can be saved. They will
[1:35:27] go into the the tribulation, the last
[1:35:29] age. But the bride is the one that will
[1:35:32] go into the rapture. And we are part of
[1:35:34] the bride.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; So this in order to be united with him,
[1:35:38] they will be one. There will be the very
[1:35:40] manifestation of the word of the living
[1:35:43] God. Denominations cannot produce this.
[1:35:46] It's a wrong seed. They will produce
[1:35:48] their creeds and their dogmas. Mix it
[1:35:50] with the word. This this mongrelizing
[1:35:53] brings forth a hybrid product. Then down
[1:35:56] then says from a little group of the
[1:35:58] true seed of the word, God will present
[1:36:00] Christ with a beloved bride. She's a
[1:36:03] virgin of his word. She's a virgin
[1:36:05] because she knows no man-made creeds of
[1:36:08] dogma by and through the members of the
[1:36:11] bride will be fulfilled. All that was
[1:36:13] promised of God to be made manifest in
[1:36:16] the virgin.
[1:36:19] The God God's intention in this last age
[1:36:22] is to make the word of God become
[1:36:25] manifest.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Because God has a plan with the bride.
[1:36:31] God in this bride coming of Christ,
[1:36:33] Christ doesn't just want he he want to
[1:36:36] work through you. I like what brother
[1:36:39] Chad said the other day as he expressed.
[1:36:41] It says you know what sometimes we want
[1:36:43] to become um we want to become God and
[1:36:47] God wants to become us.
[1:36:49] The intention the goal of God
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; was so that God can become us.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; He he manifested it in Jesus Christ.
[1:36:57] Jesus Christ is the full expression of
[1:37:00] God.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; The full revelation of God.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; How you want to see God? I want you to
[1:37:05] know God. If you want to see that you
[1:37:08] have to see it in Jesus Christ.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. But why he was not in a
[1:37:12] supernatural way like an angel as oh
[1:37:14] this is God in the form of an angel. The
[1:37:17] form an angel doesn't express God as God
[1:37:20] wanted to express.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; God want to be expressed as a man.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; And he put that as a Jesus Christ. Jesus
[1:37:27] Christ was the one that was the full
[1:37:30] expression of God. You want to know God?
[1:37:32] Look at Jesus Christ.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; But today you can't see Jesus Christ in
[1:37:36] the flesh.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Now God want to manifest himself. What
[1:37:40] he put is Jesus Christ as an example. He
[1:37:42] was the first fruit to show that there
[1:37:44] will come many more in the field that
[1:37:47] will be like Jesus Christ.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; And now God wants you and I to be like
[1:37:52] Jesus Christ
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; in the man doing the job, doing your
[1:37:56] work, going to school and doing
[1:37:58] different things. The natural things
[1:37:59] that you do that's what God want to
[1:38:02] express himself in the natural things.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we want to be Christians only
[1:38:07] at church. Then you put your best robe,
[1:38:09] your best dress and everything. You
[1:38:11] hallelujah and everything and look like
[1:38:14] Christian. That's not the full
[1:38:16] expression of God. The full expression
[1:38:18] of God is back home in the school in the
[1:38:21] place where you are. You stand with the
[1:38:23] standard of the word of God showing who
[1:38:26] Christ is. That's God being expressed.
[1:38:29] Amen. That's God being manifested. Amen.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Of course, we want people in the church.
[1:38:34] Of course, we'll come to the church.
[1:38:36] Jesus Christ was going to the church.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; It was even say form his habit to go to
[1:38:41] the church. It was not something forced
[1:38:43] upon him. It was natural things just to
[1:38:45] go to the church. That was Jesus God
[1:38:47] expression of God.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; He's going to church.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine Jesus Christ listening
[1:38:53] to to a preacher to a priest?
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; He was not preaching all the time.
[1:38:57] Sometimes he stay in the church.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:15] James tells for us that the body without
[1:39:17] the spirit is dead. For as the body
[1:39:19] without the spirit is dead. In the same
[1:39:21] way the Holy Spirit works through our
[1:39:23] bodies, God partners with his people to
[1:39:26] accomplish his will on earth. When God
[1:39:29] delivered Israel, he said, I am come
[1:39:31] down to deliver them. We touch on
[1:39:33] Wednesday. have come to deliver them.
[1:39:35] Come now, therefore, and I will send
[1:39:37] thee unto Pharaoh." God coming down. But
[1:39:40] God couldn't finish the work without
[1:39:42] Moses. He needed Moses, a man to work
[1:39:45] through it. God comes down. Jesus Christ
[1:39:48] come down. The mighty angel comes down.
[1:39:50] Now, he needs you. He needs me to
[1:39:52] accomplish the work, to fulfill the work
[1:39:54] that was promised for the bride. He
[1:39:56] needs you. He needs me to do that. God,
[1:39:58] help us to make oursel available for
[1:40:01] you. Amen. That's the standard God
[1:40:03] wants. Isaiah proclaims when the enemy
[1:40:05] shall come that the scripture read the
[1:40:07] spirit of God shall lift out the stand
[1:40:08] against him. That standard is not only a
[1:40:11] banner but also God's people in his
[1:40:13] living witness. We are his chosen
[1:40:16] instrument to resist the devil that the
[1:40:18] enemy must flee. Amen. The prophet says
[1:40:21] in putting on the old hammer, God just
[1:40:23] brings his word more positive all the
[1:40:25] time. We don't have to refortify it and
[1:40:28] bring something else up. He makes his
[1:40:31] word more real all the time. The Bible
[1:40:34] said when the enemy and because that the
[1:40:36] spirit of God rais stand against it.
[1:40:38] When the enemy comes in like a flood and
[1:40:40] God fortification to his people to
[1:40:42] fortify them is the word of God. So he
[1:40:46] just raises the word a standard against
[1:40:49] him. But how God is raising the word is
[1:40:52] the enemy comes do you just present it
[1:40:54] and say no hey read? No it becomes your
[1:40:58] life. The enemy comes and say no now the
[1:41:02] word of God become flesh inside of you
[1:41:04] and say no God I stand upon the word of
[1:41:06] God
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; I don't want to look on the negative
[1:41:08] thing I don't want to look the symptoms
[1:41:09] I stand upon the word of I see the enemy
[1:41:11] coming but I don't want to rely on my on
[1:41:13] my five senses I stand upon the word of
[1:41:15] God the Bible said so then you become
[1:41:18] the standard
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; against what the enemy is bringing you
[1:41:21] become the one God is raising there's
[1:41:23] pressure at school one pressure school
[1:41:26] everybody's doing everybody's doing
[1:41:27] everybody's doing You don't just go say,
[1:41:29] "Hey,
[1:41:31] you put the word or the God take the
[1:41:33] word of God and and raise it." No, he
[1:41:36] raises you there. You stand, you know,
[1:41:38] the others are doing that. I'm not doing
[1:41:39] that because I'm a son of God. I'm a
[1:41:42] daughter of God. I stand upon the word
[1:41:43] of God and I'm a believer.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; God raised you as a standard.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; You know, on the judgment,
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; we read it. The word of God will be
[1:41:53] judging. Amen.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; But is it going to be just the word of
[1:41:57] God, the letter,
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; or is it the saints will be judging?
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; God will say, "You see that one went
[1:42:05] through the same pressure as you at
[1:42:07] school, the same pressure as you at
[1:42:09] school,
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; but she stood for the word of God."
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; And then that's the standard I raised on
[1:42:14] that time.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Now you see, she can now give a
[1:42:17] testimony. Now she testifying about no I
[1:42:19] went through that and but God stood with
[1:42:21] me and by God's grace I stood upon the
[1:42:23] word of God.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you judge because the word of
[1:42:27] God became life inside of you. Amen.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:37] Prophet says exposition of seven
[1:42:40] churches
[1:42:42] as he has cried out in this last age.
[1:42:43] You have the word.
[1:42:46] You have more Bibles than ever. But you
[1:42:49] are not doing anything about the word
[1:42:51] except dividing and hiking it into
[1:42:53] pieces.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Taking what you want and leaving out
[1:42:57] what you don't.
[1:42:59] You are not interested in living it but
[1:43:01] debating it.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Bibles are good.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Bibles are good. But don't stop just at
[1:43:08] the letter.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; You have to be interested in living the
[1:43:12] word of God. Amen.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Because God wants the life of the word
[1:43:15] of God. Says you are not interested in
[1:43:18] living it but debating it. It will be it
[1:43:20] will it will soon know you were cold or
[1:43:24] hot. If you were cold or reject it will
[1:43:26] stand. If you could get white hot to
[1:43:30] know it truth and live it I will praise
[1:43:32] you for that. But when you simply take
[1:43:34] my word and don't honor it I in return
[1:43:37] must refuse to honor you. I will spew
[1:43:40] out of for he's talking about Leodia but
[1:43:43] we are the bride. Amen.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Is that what Paul said? Do we begin
[1:43:48] again to command ourselves or need we as
[1:43:52] some others epistles of commandation to
[1:43:55] you or letters of commandation from you.
[1:43:58] You are our epistle written in our heart
[1:44:00] known and read of all men. For as much
[1:44:03] as you are manifestly declared to be the
[1:44:05] epistle of Christ, ministered by us,
[1:44:08] written not with ink, but with the
[1:44:10] spirit of the living God, not in tables
[1:44:12] of stone, but in fleshly tables of the
[1:44:15] heart. And such trust we through Christ
[1:44:18] to God word. Not that we are sufficient
[1:44:21] in ourselves to think anything of
[1:44:23] ourselves but our fish our sufficiency
[1:44:26] is of God who has also made us able
[1:44:30] ministers to the new testament not of
[1:44:32] the letters but of the spirit for the
[1:44:34] letter kid but the spirit give us life
[1:44:37] so we just put recommendations I'm this
[1:44:40] Paul and see Paul can you write can you
[1:44:42] speak properly and different things for
[1:44:44] say none of this but your life is a
[1:44:46] proof of my ministry
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:44:49] Let our life put the proof of the
[1:44:50] ministry that we have received. Oh, I
[1:44:54] when we receive the revive, when the
[1:44:55] revival will come, when and no, don't
[1:44:57] put that in the future. Say, I'm the
[1:44:59] revival.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; I'm the message of the hour.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; I'm what Bam spoke about. It's not about
[1:45:05] theology and even things you understand.
[1:45:07] Now look, if you want to see what he
[1:45:09] preach about, I'm the life. I'm the
[1:45:11] representation. I'm the revival. You
[1:45:14] want to see Christ manifest, I'm the
[1:45:16] one. Not in a bustful way but say God by
[1:45:18] God's grace I believe it and I want to
[1:45:21] be it. All my mistakes I want him to
[1:45:24] overcome them because I will he will
[1:45:27] never be defeated.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; That's what not a recommendation of a
[1:45:30] letter but Lord my life is a testimony.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Wonderful quote that we always read all
[1:45:37] the time but make it more real all the
[1:45:40] time. How we need in Jeffersonville
[1:45:42] thousands of lived voices. The thunder
[1:45:45] of God thundering out in sweetness and
[1:45:48] holiness, purity, undefiled lives,
[1:45:52] walking around in the earth today
[1:45:55] without a blemish. Yes, sir. Real
[1:45:58] Christians don't thunder against the
[1:46:00] enemy. The enemy don't care how loud you
[1:46:03] can holler. The devil don't care how
[1:46:05] much you can jump and how much you can
[1:46:07] do this or shout. But what hurts the
[1:46:10] devil is to see that sanctified.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; That holy life consecrated to God.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Consecrated to God,
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Lord. Consecrate me to your service.
[1:46:22] Consecrate me more to you, Lord.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Consecrated to God. Say anything to him.
[1:46:28] Call him anything. You just as sweet as
[1:46:31] it can be. And move right on. Stay
[1:46:34] focused on Christ.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Stay focused on Christ. Oh my. That
[1:46:39] throws him away. That's the thunder that
[1:46:41] shakes the end the devil just like oh
[1:46:44] well you say if I could preach like a
[1:46:45] Billy Graham or Hora Robert or somebody
[1:46:48] a great influ influential speaker. Oh
[1:46:51] no. Sometimes the devil just laughs at
[1:46:53] that. Says, "Oh, just want to put
[1:46:56] something on and look and everything,
[1:46:58] pretend and everything." No, he doesn't
[1:47:00] pay no attention to that then nothing.
[1:47:04] But you get all the theology and
[1:47:05] theology want to and all the seminary
[1:47:07] training and the devil just sit back and
[1:47:09] laugh at it when he sees that life. But
[1:47:11] when he sees that life, the little life
[1:47:14] of Jesus Christ, the token, the baptism
[1:47:17] of the Holy Ghost, then he's scared of
[1:47:19] that. is scared of that thunder. That's
[1:47:21] the most important thing, the life of
[1:47:23] Jesus Christ. John Baptist was not
[1:47:27] scared on how things went or the tomalt
[1:47:29] and the different things. He was the
[1:47:31] manifestation of the word of God for
[1:47:33] that hour. He knew what the scripture
[1:47:35] was talking about him. He knew his
[1:47:37] position upon the word of God. I'll be
[1:47:38] closing soon already. Let me finish
[1:47:41] where I want to go. He knew his position
[1:47:43] where he was standing. He knew his
[1:47:44] place. John the Baptist knew his
[1:47:47] position. You know, I'm the voice of I'm
[1:47:49] the voice of one crying in the
[1:47:51] wilderness. He knew his place. The bride
[1:47:54] needs to know her position in the
[1:47:55] scripture. Because in order to have
[1:47:57] perfect faith, you need to believe what
[1:48:00] the word of God says about you and your
[1:48:03] your position in the word of God. Not
[1:48:06] look at your failures. You look at what
[1:48:09] the word of God says and you stay
[1:48:11] focused on the word of God
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; and being interested in living God's
[1:48:16] word. Amen. Have faith in what the word
[1:48:19] of God says you are. The prophet says,
[1:48:22] "Have faith in what the word of God says
[1:48:24] you are." Jesus had faith in the word of
[1:48:27] God that said what he was. It is written
[1:48:30] of me. Malachi 4 is written about you.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Your heart, my heart will be changed.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; My heart will be changed.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I don't know. But as as I'm
[1:48:44] feeding upon the word, as I'm staying in
[1:48:46] the channel of the word of God, I'm
[1:48:47] staying in the channel of reading the
[1:48:49] word message or praying, God is changing
[1:48:52] my heart. God is purifying my mind. God
[1:48:55] is changing my heart. Amen.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Because the word of God says, I'm part
[1:48:59] of the scripture.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; John writes to Jesus, "The word was made
[1:49:07] flesh and dwelt among us." Jesus said to
[1:49:09] himself, "I'm the light of the world."
[1:49:12] You know that what is the light? Prophet
[1:49:14] will give an explanation. The light is
[1:49:16] the manifestation of the word of God. As
[1:49:19] long as it's still the word is not light
[1:49:21] yet. But when that word becomes
[1:49:23] manifested, then it is the light.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Let the light, let the light be, that
[1:49:29] was not the light yet. But when that
[1:49:32] word become manifest, the sun comes out,
[1:49:34] it becomes physic. Oh, now it is the
[1:49:37] light because the word of God made
[1:49:38] manifest. Now the word of God says you
[1:49:41] are the light of the world. How can you
[1:49:43] be the light of the world? The word of
[1:49:45] God for your age now become a
[1:49:47] manifested.
[1:49:49] Now I am the light.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Because I am the word of my age being
[1:49:53] manifested. Amen. You can't manifest the
[1:49:56] light in the time of previous ages. It
[1:49:58] won't work. You have to be the light of
[1:50:00] the word in your age that you have
[1:50:03] received.
[1:50:09] The end time messenger and message
[1:50:11] should meet with end time conditions.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Don't you think so? This message could
[1:50:17] not have been preached 40 years ago or
[1:50:20] 100 years ago or before. No, the end
[1:50:23] time message and messenger has got to
[1:50:25] meet back there in them days. They had
[1:50:28] it probably wouldn't have not worked.
[1:50:31] You know that you have been
[1:50:32] predestinated for this age. If you were
[1:50:34] in the other age, you may may be
[1:50:36] struggling.
[1:50:38] But God ordained you to be in this age.
[1:50:41] You have been ordained. No matter how
[1:50:43] that I said at the beginning, I'll
[1:50:44] repeat myself again. No matter what laia
[1:50:47] is putting upon us, we are predestinated
[1:50:50] to overcome.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we have been ordained to
[1:50:54] be overcome in this age. Back then, them
[1:50:57] days they had it probably wouldn't have
[1:50:59] not worked. But it's got to cope with
[1:51:01] end time conditions. Be converted.
[1:51:03] Believe the gospel signs that the
[1:51:05] message of today wash your souls in the
[1:51:07] blood of the lamb and believe the gospel
[1:51:10] that the end time signs are here. The
[1:51:12] seed of the gospel has been taking
[1:51:14] place. Amen. That's why this message was
[1:51:17] waiting for the end time conditions. It
[1:51:19] was waiting for the end time sodomite
[1:51:21] conditions. You were predestinated to
[1:51:24] meet the sodomite conditions. But as we
[1:51:26] see the sodomite conditions, so the
[1:51:29] revelation of the son of man is
[1:51:30] prevailing as well. Why? because it was
[1:51:33] meeting the end time conditions. The
[1:51:36] word of Moses time did not work in the
[1:51:38] days of Jesus time. No, the word in the
[1:51:40] days of the apostles does not work in
[1:51:42] these days. It's a promised word for
[1:51:44] this day. They say themselves and spoke
[1:51:46] it by the Holy Ghost. What will take
[1:51:49] place in the last days? How the churches
[1:51:51] will be heady, high-minded, how the
[1:51:53] roar, the war will rise up and the
[1:51:55] harlots will be right with her. They
[1:51:58] will take on the hedge and the last age
[1:51:59] and the loudia. Jesus will be completely
[1:52:02] taken from the church. The prophet goes
[1:52:04] on. But
[1:52:06] that's the message of that age could not
[1:52:07] work in our days.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Like brother Herald used to put the
[1:52:10] illustration says when that on that day
[1:52:12] on the rapture on the other side every
[1:52:15] age will be passing. Oh the first age
[1:52:17] comes. Oh. Oh these are the age of
[1:52:19] Ephesis. Oh really? That's why you had
[1:52:21] to fight and everything. You see when
[1:52:23] the heresy was coming you see how you
[1:52:25] fought and oh then the second age dark
[1:52:28] ages have come. Oh, how could you stand
[1:52:30] that there would be murder m killing you
[1:52:33] and you was just willing to go through
[1:52:35] that? What happened to the it was not
[1:52:38] us. It was the anointing upon us.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; God prevail in our house because when
[1:52:43] the enemy comes, God send another
[1:52:45] anointing to overcome until they come to
[1:52:48] the last age.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; L to the age of Luther. Lut how could
[1:52:52] you how could you overcome that powerful
[1:52:55] the powerful religion the Catholic
[1:52:57] system? It was not me. It was just the
[1:52:59] anointing upon me.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; And then the last age will come on. You
[1:53:04] were in the loudest year age
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; really with internet and
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; artificial intelligence and and and
[1:53:13] Facebook and WhatsApp and talk tick tock
[1:53:16] talk
[1:53:20] Instagram and all the different things.
[1:53:22] We can't keep up of all those things.
[1:53:25] What happened to you? Mhm.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; How did you prevail? Oh, it was not us.
[1:53:31] It was the eagle anointing upon us. God
[1:53:34] sent the eagle anointing to give us
[1:53:36] overcoming powers. That's why we made
[1:53:39] it. Amen. And God use us as we yield
[1:53:41] oursel to him. God use us to bring the
[1:53:44] standard higher, higher, not lower,
[1:53:47] higher and higher and higher. We shall
[1:53:50] prevail again.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; God bless you richly. Amen.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:06] Amen.
[1:54:12] [Music]
[1:54:22] Amen. Let's sing that one.
[1:54:25] We are
[1:54:28] conquerors
[1:54:32] over
[1:54:34] in this time.
[1:54:39] We will be victorious
[1:54:45] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:54:50] [Music]
[1:54:52] We made more than
[1:54:59] over
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:08] glorious
[1:55:12] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:55:19] Amen.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Was that that song that he s I feel the
[1:55:23] pool. But the other the other song that
[1:55:26] something keeps holding me. Something is
[1:55:28] holding me. Yeah.

[1:55:47] I see
[1:55:50] is telling Heat. Heat.
[1:55:54] [Music]
[1:56:01] Heat. Heat.
[1:56:16] is a reality.
[1:56:20] Something keeps falling.
[1:56:27] Something keeps
[1:56:30] me

[1:56:40] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:56:51] He's got me
[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:57:02] [Music]
[1:57:04] a reality
[1:57:07] for something.
[1:57:12] Sisters, can you help us on verse one?
[1:57:16] The tri
[1:57:22] and stronger.
[1:57:25] [Music]
[1:57:28] The more I felt
[1:57:31] was more than I could bear.
[1:57:40] And I was on the verge.
[1:57:45] I'm getting all
[1:57:51] the strength with myself
[1:57:56] just
[1:58:13] helping Fully
[1:58:17] overcome
[1:58:19] my
[1:58:30] gtory.
[1:58:36] He's a reality.
[1:58:40] Jesus is holy.
[1:58:48] S lay before me his tempation
[1:58:59] of his desire to steal away my
[1:59:09] [Music]
[1:59:11] heart
[1:59:13] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:59:23] Heat. Heat.
[1:59:30] [Music]
[1:59:37] Every day I see
[1:59:42] he's helping me faithfully
[1:59:46] to
[1:59:48] my
[1:59:54] me.
[1:59:59] It's giving me victory.
[2:00:04] He's a reality.
[2:00:09] Something
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; praise be to God. Let's bow our heads.
[2:00:21] The music is playing softly
[2:00:26] in this time of junction.
[2:00:30] different things
[2:00:32] but God just want you to focus upon him.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; you know sometimes
[2:00:39] can be nervous and different things
[2:00:41] happening.
[2:00:43] You feel like you have been trying
[2:00:45] yourself on your own. You have the
[2:00:48] impression that you are not an
[2:00:50] overcomer.
[2:00:52] You try and you fail. You try and you
[2:00:54] fail. Sometimes you make a decision. You
[2:00:56] feel like you are determined and and
[2:00:59] then it works for a few days and after
[2:01:01] that you feel like again like you go
[2:01:02] back again to the whole habit feel like
[2:01:05] you and you you have lost trust in
[2:01:08] yourself and and the devil comes on top
[2:01:12] of that. So you feel like you're a
[2:01:14] Christian but you are just a hypocrite.
[2:01:16] You know you you you just pretending.
[2:01:20] But how many can just say you know Lord
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; I just want to surrender myself to you.
[2:01:27] You promised that you'll raise the
[2:01:29] standard not myself. You promised
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; just one Lord to heal myself to the
[2:01:34] anointing of the age to the word of God.
[2:01:38] As the prophet says, the only thing you
[2:01:40] need is just to love him to love him
[2:01:42] more and to take all the frustration
[2:01:45] away if you just tell him the Lord I
[2:01:48] love you. You know I love you. I have my
[2:01:50] mistakes but I love you. But Lord, today
[2:01:53] I want to yield myself more to you and
[2:01:56] God you will take over. Just raise your
[2:01:59] hand to him and he knows your need. He
[2:02:01] knows your situation you're going
[2:02:03] through. Just express to him something
[2:02:06] keeps holding me. And the prophet went
[2:02:08] through trials. He say it was not my was
[2:02:10] not me keeping the religion. I was not
[2:02:12] trying but it was that religion as you
[2:02:15] call it religion but it was that reality
[2:02:18] of God that kept me moving. It was not
[2:02:20] me holding but it was him holding me and
[2:02:24] that's what I just want to hold his
[2:02:25] hand. His unchanging hand something
[2:02:29] keeps holding me. Talk to him. talk to
[2:02:30] the Lord as I'll be praying for all of
[2:02:33] you and my son.
[2:02:36] Father Lord, we thank you once again
[2:02:39] Lord presence this morning.

[2:04:33] receive the word of God, deity will be
[2:04:35] among us, Father. Heaven will turn
[2:04:38] loose, Lord, and all the power will be

[2:04:42] Father, Lord, we accept your word. We

[2:04:52] may they, Father, be healed. For those
[2:04:54] who Lord Jesus Christ are still bound,
[2:04:56] may they be delivered this morning in
[2:04:58] the name of Jesus Christ. May the
[2:05:01] standard be raised for us God. Father

[2:05:05] it might be, it might be through
[2:05:06] sickness, might be through the children,

[2:05:10] conditions, might be through the
[2:05:12] situations, might be Father Lord the
[2:05:14] status, might be different things that
