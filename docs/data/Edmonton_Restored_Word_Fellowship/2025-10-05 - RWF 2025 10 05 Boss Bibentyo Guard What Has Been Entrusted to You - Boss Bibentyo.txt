Sister Wendy God bless you richly. &gt;&gt; Good morning. Um I was asked to sing this song. Uh it's not really my vocal range but I'll do my best. I trust it's a blessing. [Music] The news came to Jesus. Please confess. Lazarus is sick and without your help. Mary watch their brother die. They waited for Jesus. He did not kill. The death watch was over buried for days. Somebody said he'll soon be here. holds on his way. Martha [Music] and she cried, "Lord, if you'd been here, you would have healed me and still be alive." But you're four days late and our hope is gone. Lord, we don't understand why you've waited so long. But his ways, God's ways, not yours are mine. And isn't it easus? [Music] Show me the grave. She said, "Lord, you don't understand. He's been there for days." The great stone was back. Then Jesus is going alone. Lazar was comfort. Then somebody said he's alive. He may be fighting a battle of fear. You've cried to the Lord. We need you now, but he has not appeared. Friend, don't be discouraged. He's still the same. He'll soon be here. He'll roll back your stone and he'll call out your name. When he's 40 days late and our hope is gone, Lord, we don't understand why you waited so long. But his way is God's way, not yours, mine. And his great part is late. He's still tired. Isn't it great when he's 40 days late? He's still on time. God's still on time. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Sister Wendy. God bless you richly. God is always on time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whoever put that request for that song, God bless you. It was needed. God is always on time. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you want to push things and do it your own way, but God knows the best and he will do it on his own time. There's that song that says on his time, in his time, that's the best thing on his time. On Wednesday, we heard them message, nice message, exhortation to have the right attitude in every situation. That's what Martha had. Prophet says she could she humanly speaking she could have had something to say. say you know I've done everything lost done everything but why didn't come on that time but no she says Lord whatever you say &gt;&gt; whatever you say &gt;&gt; if you say whatever you say I just won't believe you are the life the resurrection and that's what we need to what tell him Lord we love you no matter what can we sing in a moment like this in a moment like this and And we invite brother brother boss his name is boss like boss. So um we whether you like it or not you call him boss. So he's he's our boss today and we welcome him. I was there I was blessed in in Manitoba. Forgot to say last time Sister Devin I met her in Manitoba there and she was she was she was just good to see her in Manitoba there. forgot to present her the other time when she came back but um and he was there and he was helping brother Boris and many things is very gifted in so many things very good help there and uh you will enjoy and we will be blessed this morning he's a little bit soft soft spoken but you hear the word of God as we heard this morning is the voice that's the most important God speak to me in a moment like this sing out the in like I sing out. &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. I sing out a love song to Jesus. In moments like these, I lift up my hand. I lift up my hands to the Lord singing I love you Lord. We love you Lord. Singing I love you Lord. singing. I love you, Lord. I love you. Oh, singing singing. I love you, Lord. Singing. I love you, Lord. Singing. I love you, Lord. I love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. It's a privilege to be here in Edmonton with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I haven't been to this lovely city in a while. I think the last time I was here was probably eight or nine years ago. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you very much. And you all seem like lovely people. &gt;&gt; I'm not here by myself. I'm here with my wife. Her name is Deine as well. She's over there. And uh I came with my two little girls, Allora and Eloise. And I also came with my in-laws of my brother-in-law Sam, my sister-in-law Leia and Sarah. We all came together. [Applause] Uh if you had asked me at the beginning of the week whether I will be in Edmonton. Sure. I didn't know I would be here. But it uh it so happens that my father-in-law who lives in Calgary was sick. So I decided to come and see him. And uh seeing that I was only a few hours away, I said why not? I'll just come and see brother Moses. &gt;&gt; So here we are this morning. I drove from Calgary. I used to think Winnipeg was cold, but I realized that mountain is really cold. So I was showing me on my car there, it's minus 3 and I said, "Lord, I thought Winnipeg was cold, but this one is worse." But uh I just hope that that cold is only outside. Inside we are still warm. All right. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh so uh as the brother said, I'm soft spoke and I don't really scream. And you'll probably notice that my style of preaching is slightly different, &gt;&gt; but the message is the same. &gt;&gt; So, if I say something you don't agree with, find the nearest trash can and throw it there, but don't throw me there. All right? I'm still your brother. &gt;&gt; I still love you. &gt;&gt; And uh we don't I personally don't have a message. uh when God was addressing to the seven church ages, &gt;&gt; he was addressing himself to the angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And every age has an angel &gt;&gt; and the message is to the angel &gt;&gt; and we all are just faithful to receive from the angel &gt;&gt; and to present it to the people of God. &gt;&gt; That is God's way of working. &gt;&gt; So uh I I will not take much time. That's also another thing about me. I don't preach for long. So, uh we will uh we'll probably have a short service. Uh so, if you will stand, we'll go to the reading of the scriptures. &gt;&gt; We'll read in two places and then uh we will add uh our little comments on that and we'll see how the Lord will lead us. &gt;&gt; That's mine. So, first place where we will read from this morning is in Matthew chapter 4. We'll read the first four verses from there and then we'll go to the book of uh Timothy and read from there. So Matthew chapter 4 verse 1 to4. I'm reading the New King James version. The Bible says, are you there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus was led up by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. And when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights, afterward he was hungry. Now when the tempter came to him, he said, "If you are the son of God, command that these stones become bread." But he answered and said, "It is written." And that is the part I want you to remember. It is written. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not I heard. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not my pastor said it, &gt;&gt; but God said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone, &gt;&gt; but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; Now we'll go in the second place. It's first Timothy chapter 6. We'll read verse 20 and 21. The Bible says in 1 Timothy chapter 6 verse 20 and 21, oh Timothy, this is Paul who's addressing Timothy. He considered him like his own son. So he's addressing to him the way a father would speak to his child. He says, "Oh Timothy, guard what was committed to your trust. Avoid the profane and idol babblings and contradiction of what is falsely called knowledge. By professing it, some have strayed concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Gracious Father, we thank you this morning for the opportunity to come into your house. We know as we have read, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of your mouth. You have given us your word. We have read it. I am a man, Lord. My words will carry death, but your words, they carry spirit and life. May your spirit follow your words, dear God, to quicken them into our hearts &gt;&gt; so that they will be like the seed that fell on good ground, &gt;&gt; yielding forth a hundfold. &gt;&gt; Bless your word in the hearts of your children. Myself as a man, I commit my mind, my thoughts, my entire being into your hands. &gt;&gt; I pray that you will use me as a vessel of honor to bless your children. And Lord, I also pray that you'll set me out of their way and just speak through me. &gt;&gt; Bless your children as they sit and they listen. Oh Lord, may your word penetrate deep inside their hearts that they will go from here saying like the disciples who heard you speak to them on their way to Emmas. Truly our hearts burnt within us as he spoke to us. &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll forgive our sins, dear God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wash us and sanctify us in your blood &gt;&gt; so that nothing will hinder your presence from freely moving among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember the needs in the hearts of your children. Father, &gt;&gt; I am a man. It is pointless for them to tell me their needs. But you are the God who searches the innermost part of a man. And you know our needs because you are a faithful father. &gt;&gt; Even before we ask, you're ready to provide. Lord, I pray that you'll grant to each person in here according to their faith in you. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, if there be any sick people among us, &gt;&gt; we have a blessed assurance in the scriptures that says, "I am the God who heals all your diseases." Father, &gt;&gt; with you, there is no disease that is out of the question. Father, &gt;&gt; you are the God who heals it all. And it's by your stripes that we are healed. And by the Holy Spirit, we still have access to those stripes today. and I pray that you'll provide healing whatever trouble your children may have. Lord, you're more than a match for their problems. Father, we bless your name and we invite you in the name of Jesus Christ, we have prayed. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. So for a topic this morning, I want to draw from the subject guard. What has been entrusted to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. As uh brother said, I come from Winnipeg and in Winnipeg we try to guard what has been entrusted to us. &gt;&gt; And I come to Edmonton. I find you gathered. I know that you're also guarding what has been entrusted to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Dein. I remember you're from Winnipeg. &gt;&gt; You know, God has his children everywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the criteria for being a child of God is different. We are not children of God because we come to church. &gt;&gt; The devil also goes to church. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; We are not children of God because we believe. &gt;&gt; The Bible says even the devil believes &gt;&gt; and he trembles. &gt;&gt; So what makes you then a child of God? &gt;&gt; You're born by his spirit. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; The devil is not born of the spirit of God. You and I are born of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And when we are born of the spirit of God, we become partakers of the divine promises that God has given us. &gt;&gt; And through these promises, we have a right to an an inheritance. And that inheritance is the kingdom to come. &gt;&gt; We want to be a part of that kingdom to come. The one that shall never pass away. &gt;&gt; Everything that we see here on earth has a beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Considered something has a beginning. As long as it has a beginning, it has an end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we know that there is a God who has no beginning. &gt;&gt; We know that there is a God who has no end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for you to live eternally, eternity must first come in you. &gt;&gt; And it will transform you from a creature of of time &gt;&gt; to a creature of eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we come to church under expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; To receive from him who can only give eternity. &gt;&gt; We can preach the word, you can hear the word, but it will require personal connection with God. &gt;&gt; And uh we just create the right atmosphere for people &gt;&gt; to get into that connection with God and we let God do the rest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So like uh Moses told uh the Lord in Exodus 23, I believe, you know, if you'll not go with us, there is no point sending us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, you are the God we are coming here to look for. &gt;&gt; You are the God who answers all our needs. &gt;&gt; You are the God who has taken us from Egypt. Now God is faithful. He doesn't take you from Egypt to leave you in the wilderness. Whenever you see someone stop their journey in the wilderness, &gt;&gt; you have to know something. It's not God who left them. &gt;&gt; They left God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God never begins something to leave it halfway. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Whatever he begins, he will finish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he said about the work of Zerubbabel. &gt;&gt; You can stand against it, but he will finish his work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can doubt it, but he will finish his work. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can say all you want about it, but in the end, God's word will be true, and every man's word will be a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That means your opinion of what God is is a lie if it doesn't align with the word of God. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Let God be true and every man be a liar." &gt;&gt; So that means your last medical report that said you have cancer is a lie. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because God didn't say you have cancer. &gt;&gt; That's the doctor who said that. God said by my stripes &gt;&gt; you are healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That also means you may fail in school &gt;&gt; but God didn't call you a failure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The teacher can say you failed. The bank may say you're broke. We are going to repossess your your house. We are going to repossess your car. The immigration can say get out of this country. &gt;&gt; But God didn't say that. Amen. &gt;&gt; God says, "I know the plans that I have for you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now what we need to do &gt;&gt; is to go up to the mountain, go up to God &gt;&gt; and find the plan that he has for us. &gt;&gt; Then by faith we pull that plan down to our dimension. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. That's the difference between receiving and possessing. &gt;&gt; All right. We have the promises of God, but we need to possess them. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we possess them by going up and bringing them into our dimension. They become our reality. &gt;&gt; So he says, "I have good plans for you. They are plans of prosperity. They are not plans of sorrow because it is the blessing of the Lord that makes rich." &gt;&gt; And he adds no sorrow to it. &gt;&gt; Every blessing that comes with sorrow, then you know where it came from. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It didn't come from God. No, &gt;&gt; sometimes we want things that God says that's not for you. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we want things God says if you only knew how many tears you'll cry after you got that, &gt;&gt; you wouldn't be crying for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see, God being a father, &gt;&gt; sometimes he says the best way to teach you a lesson is to let you shed a few tears. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if I keep saying no, no, no, no, no. You will say this man doesn't love me. &gt;&gt; So he says, I'll let you have your way from time to time. &gt;&gt; He won't stop you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know why God will not stop you? God created you in his image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the in the image of God, you have attributes of God. &gt;&gt; God is sovereign. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what God also does, he also gives you your own sovereignty. &gt;&gt; He gives you free will. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So there are things God will say, I've given you my word. It's up to you to choose to do it. &gt;&gt; That's why you're in the image of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you choose to do it, blessed are you. &gt;&gt; If you choose not to do it, you will pay the price. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out where we are at here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't want to go I don't want to go ahead of people. I don't want to go behind you, you know. I want to I'm trying to to discover the depth of the waters that we are swimming in. &gt;&gt; Brother. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, uh and I hope that I don't lose you. You know, my aim has never been to preach mysterious things. Amen. &gt;&gt; My aim is to always take the things and make them simple &gt;&gt; because Christ is revealed in simplicity &gt;&gt; it pleased God to use a servant greater to preach to us the message. &gt;&gt; Yet sometimes you try to make the message as if you need a PhD to understand it. &gt;&gt; That is wrong. &gt;&gt; If God wanted us to have all PhDs to know the message, he would have created universities in the Garden of Eden. The only institution that God put in the Garden of Eden was marriage. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; He never put schools. &gt;&gt; He never put prisons. &gt;&gt; He never put, you know, governments. &gt;&gt; You know why God didn't do that? Because you don't need them. &gt;&gt; The only thing that man needs is to figure out where God wants him to be. &gt;&gt; And in there, keep his fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; So Adam, when God created him, God puts him in the Garden of Eden. As long as you are in the Garden of Eden, you keep your fellowship with God, all your needs are taken care of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will not need no government, no hospitals. The minute you fall sick, God is there to heal you. &gt;&gt; How can you be sick when you're feeding on heavenly mana? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's impossible. &gt;&gt; But the minute we walk out of God's plan, then there is where the problem comes in. Death comes in. And you know when death comes in, with death comes sickness, &gt;&gt; old age, &gt;&gt; with death comes you know heart problems, disobedient children. All of that is death calling you. &gt;&gt; Death pulling you closer and closer and closer. Before man sinned, he never had to toil to eat. God simply told uh Adam to take care of the garden, but he never told him, "You shall eat at the sweat of your forehead." No, his food was part of God's economy for him. &gt;&gt; But when man sinned, then God said, "Well, go fend for yourself. &gt;&gt; Go figure it out." &gt;&gt; Much like teenagers today, you know, you're only 14, you're only 15. You begin to tell your parents, "I cannot wait to go and live on my own." Well, they may laugh at you and say, "You know, child, you don't know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of your rules in this house." They only look at you and they say, "If you only knew." &gt;&gt; There was something my mother used to do to me when I was a kid. I was in a system where we finished school at around 1:00 p.m. So, I'll go back home and my mom will tell me, "Go take a nap." Say, "Mom, I don't like naps." Says, "Go take a nap. One day you'll appreciate these naps. &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I wish someone could take tell me to take a nap today. &gt;&gt; Right. You begin to see that they are protecting you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what they call protection, disobedience calls it rules. &gt;&gt; It's disobedience. &gt;&gt; An obedient heart looks at the promises of God and they say, "They are not a burden to me. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they are easy to do. &gt;&gt; So when man sins against God, God kicks him out of the garden, then he has to go and work and toil to get a basic needs. And we we have never had enough. By the way, &gt;&gt; no matter how much you work, you still don't have enough. &gt;&gt; There is no man who can tell you my bank account enough. &gt;&gt; Every day has its own needs. But we have a God who shows us the difference. So in Genesis 3, he tells man, you shall eat at the sweat of your forehead. &gt;&gt; Now when you go to Matthew 6, what does he tell us? He says, seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness. &gt;&gt; And then what will happen? Everything else will be added. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he tells you, don't worry about what you will eat. Don't worry about what you will wear. Why? God knows that you need those things before you even ask for them. &gt;&gt; So when we find people who are stressing and worried about these things, that's a sign that those people don't know what God needs of them. &gt;&gt; I often tell people that there are prayers we make to God that we shouldn't be making. Imagine you're praying to God to give you food. God says, "I led Israel in the wilderness for 40 years. &gt;&gt; I fed them morning and evening." And God says, "I am God and I changed not." &gt;&gt; All right, let's go into my topic. I see we are together. &gt;&gt; So Paul is speaking to Timothy and he tells Timothy guard what was committed to your trust. &gt;&gt; This implies that there is something that Timothy received that is of great value and Paul is giving him advice to protect and cherish the thing that he was given. There is a trust that God puts in you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because God and his word are one. &gt;&gt; You cannot separate God from his word &gt;&gt; to make him any other thing but his word. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in the beginning was the word. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. Now when you go to Revelation, I believe it's in Revelation 19 and you see the white horse rider who's coming with a sword and you see the word that is written on him for his name. It is the word of God. &gt;&gt; So in the beginning there is the word in the end shall be the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So you and I we have to always remember that God cannot be detached from his word and remain God. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's possible. &gt;&gt; You and I are also God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God spoke us into existence. &gt;&gt; In Genesis 1, God said, "Let us make man in our image." &gt;&gt; God spoke man. He created man out of nothing in his image. That man that God created in Genesis 1, the Bible says he was a spirit. &gt;&gt; Because in Genesis chapter 2, the Bible tells us there was no man on earth to teal the ground. &gt;&gt; Yet God had already created. &gt;&gt; So when God goes into Genesis chapter 2, he doesn't create again. &gt;&gt; God goes and he forms man from the dust of the earth. Now remember to form is to make something out of something else. So the Bible says he forms man from the dust of the earth. So the dust was there he forms you. And brother Brandham says in his days the dust that made each one of us was a few cents. I believe 80 cents. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But the spirit you can't put a price on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when the Bible says that God so loved the world, you look at yourself and you say, "God loved me." &gt;&gt; Then the question is this, what about me did God love? &gt;&gt; What about me did God love so much that he gave his only begotten son? &gt;&gt; Now we are beginning to step into our topic. &gt;&gt; Amen. He gave his only begotten son for something that he loved. &gt;&gt; Now you don't have to worry about that thing is it is you. &gt;&gt; Now forgive the word thing but I want you to picture yourself as an object for a second. &gt;&gt; Okay? God so loved you that he gave his only begotten son for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he says, "If you will believe on his son, &gt;&gt; you will not perish." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will have eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you will believe in his son, now this son, the Bible says he is the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is who the son of God is. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the son of God is God in bodily form. &gt;&gt; We called him Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; After his death and his resurrection, he went back to being God. &gt;&gt; But now we have the grace of knowing that if we ever look for a name for that man, we shall call him Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because when Paul was walking on his way to Damascus, he met the great pillar. &gt;&gt; The same great pillar that led Israel, Paul now meets it along the way. Paul asks that pillar, "Who are you?" &gt;&gt; He doesn't say, "I'm Elohim." &gt;&gt; Why? Revelation has gone a step further. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, Elohim was there, the self-existing one, but no one had known him yet as Christ. He became God when he had objects to worship him. &gt;&gt; But now he has become a man like you and I. &gt;&gt; He has walked on this earth. He knows the burden of working 8 hours a day. &gt;&gt; He knows the burden of going a few days without food. He knows the burden of being so tired that you sleep in the midst of a storm. He knows all of those things. &gt;&gt; So there is no situation that you have gone through that you can say God you don't know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; So that means you are without excuse. &gt;&gt; If he overcame and you truly believe that he is living in you. &gt;&gt; You must also overcome. &gt;&gt; So now we know what has been committed to us. That which has been committed to us is Christ not in human form anymore, but it is Christ in spirit form coming to dwell in us. &gt;&gt; We call that the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Now that Holy Spirit, Paul is telling us, guard what has been committed to you. &gt;&gt; Picture this. You know, when you have a few gold bars in this world, they're worth a few thousand dollars maybe. You feel so insecure about walking with them in your pocket. &gt;&gt; You go to a bank and you open a deposit, a safe &gt;&gt; and you say, "Guard this for me. &gt;&gt; Protect it." We sign a contract that you cannot lose it. &gt;&gt; And if you lose it, you will repay me the value of that gold. &gt;&gt; Now, God's son is worth more than the gold. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yet we don't take as much time to protect him. &gt;&gt; We have to guard the son of God in us. &gt;&gt; We have to guard and protect the Holy Spirit in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Spirit is more valuable than anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we can receive in this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. So guard what has been committed to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we still together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, you can say, "Well, brother Boss, I don't have the Holy Spirit yet." If that's your condition, I would say, "God bless you." It takes sincerity to realize you don't have what you need. Because pride will make you believe you have what you don't need. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Pride will make you believe you have the Holy Ghost when indeed you're still a sinner. Because brother Brham says the devil is good at confusing people. &gt;&gt; He will go to those that have it and try to make them believe they don't have it. &gt;&gt; And then he will go to those who don't have it and make them believe that they have it. You see how the devil works? &gt;&gt; All right. He goes to Eve and he tells Eve, God knew if you eat from this tree, &gt;&gt; you will be like God. &gt;&gt; You see the lie? &gt;&gt; You will be like God. But you're already in the image of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You will be like God. He is good at twisting the word. Twisting the word. Twisting the word with one purpose to get you out of God's program. &gt;&gt; And then when you get out of one go out of God's program, he says, "I got you." &gt;&gt; He's very subtle. So guard what was committed to you. &gt;&gt; So uh if you're projecting the verse Paul tells Timothy verse 20 verse 20 he says avoid the profane and idol bubblings. In other words avoid useless talk. &gt;&gt; I want to take a minute just to to emphasize on that. You know, not not every talk is useful. &gt;&gt; There are some conversations that are nothing but a waste of time. &gt;&gt; That is true. &gt;&gt; Do you think when Pilate was asking Jesus Christ all those questions, &gt;&gt; when the scribes and the chief priests were asking Jesus the questions and he remained silent, was because he didn't have anything to say? &gt;&gt; No. at the cross. Do you think he only said a few words because he had nothing to say? &gt;&gt; So you have to watch what you say. &gt;&gt; Because the devil the devil knows that if he can get you to grieve the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; he got you. And the easiest way to grieve the Holy Spirit is to speak words because words are powerful. He will bring you a situation. Look at Peter. There is no doubt that Peter loved Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now love doesn't mean overcoming. I want you to remember that. &gt;&gt; Amen. There are some men who cheats on their wife and they say, "Honey, I still love you." &gt;&gt; There are some people who go to the divorce court and they say, "It's just irreconcilable differences, but we still love each other." Love doesn't mean overcoming. &gt;&gt; There is a part that you have to do on top of loving. &gt;&gt; You have to obey. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Peter in his zeal, in his love for Jesus, he tells Jesus, "Master, if I have to die with you, &gt;&gt; I will die with you." &gt;&gt; Oh, he was so confident. &gt;&gt; It's like brothers and sisters today, me and this message, we shall die together. &gt;&gt; So serious when they're saying it. so serious when they're telling you, "Brother, if the prophet said it, I believe it." &gt;&gt; And we say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "Don't stay home when the doors are open." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You did not see that coming, right? Oh my. &gt;&gt; There are things out of zeal and love we claim. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when it comes to facing the situation, as we say, walking the walk. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You see, God knows our weaknesses. &gt;&gt; Then we begin to justify Then we begin to show as if God has some people he favors over others. &gt;&gt; It's not the case. &gt;&gt; So that's why we began by reading, "Man shall live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no word of God that is of any less value than another. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When we begin to ascribe value to one, we are greater than God. &gt;&gt; Amen. What God said, you believe it. &gt;&gt; Take God at his word. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says full obedience to the word of God entitles you to the talcan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay? Full, complete, total obedience to the word of God. &gt;&gt; So in other words, there is none of that word that you put aside. &gt;&gt; You know what full obedience means? Recognizing when you're wrong. &gt;&gt; Now, this is where sisters, I need you to pray for me. &gt;&gt; Because sisters easily accept when they are wrong. But the man, &gt;&gt; you see, they are the only ones who are saying amen. &gt;&gt; I need you to pray for me. I'm here alone. &gt;&gt; The man Ah, yes. I will I will [Laughter] &gt;&gt; It's not a surprise. It's not a surprise that when you read Mark 16, you see that the people who were worried about the resurrection of Jesus Christ were women. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's not a surprise that the church of Christ is compared to a woman. &gt;&gt; It's not a surprise that she was also the first to be deceived. &gt;&gt; She wants to believe something. &gt;&gt; She wants to believe that the Messiah, even if he's still dead, I still have access to his body. &gt;&gt; She wants to believe something. But the men are called to be the people who will be the shepherds of their homes. So that means the man must stand on his post of duty. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To protect her, &gt;&gt; to make sure she doesn't go astray. To make sure she's walking in line with the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the surprising thing is this. In many houses, the women are the ones who are taking the leadership. Sometimes for good reasons, sometimes for bad reasons. &gt;&gt; The man is so busy. He's so busy. &gt;&gt; He's so busy with work. He's so busy with projects. Now the sisters remember my firstborn is going to die if we don't put the blood on the doorpost. &gt;&gt; So she tries, she says, "I will go get this lamb." And God is looking at it and he says, "You're trying to do a good thing, but it is out of order." &gt;&gt; So men, stand on your post of duty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is an irresponsible thing to have a child if you're not going to put the blood on the doorpost. &gt;&gt; God will hold you accountable. &gt;&gt; And the blood of Jesus Christ is not literal anymore. The blood of Jesus Christ is the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Stay under the revealed word. Make sure your children are receiving the re revealed word. Dwell there. They shall live. &gt;&gt; There is a guarantee. There is an assurance. &gt;&gt; The angel of death will pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is not if. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; It's a question of when. &gt;&gt; He will pass. &gt;&gt; You don't want your children to be found outside. &gt;&gt; You don't want your children to be found in a house where there is no blood on the doorpost. You want them to be found in a place under the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To get the blood, you have to make some sacrifices. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm here to remind you, you have to make some sacrifices. &gt;&gt; That means you may have to forsake that Wednesday night job &gt;&gt; because you love your child. That means you'll have to refuse that Sunday morning shift &gt;&gt; because you love your children. &gt;&gt; You can say, "Well, me, I'm good. I already know what I believe." Yes. They don't. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Everything that you're working for shall remain here. &gt;&gt; God on the day of judgment, you will never say, "You see, brother, you had one job, so I understand." No. He will ask, "What did you do of my word?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we can go into idol talk. We can go into arguments. We show you one scripture, you show another one. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, a good debate does not bring conviction. &gt;&gt; It takes Christ manifested &gt;&gt; to bring conviction. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can debate. &gt;&gt; But debates do not glorify God. &gt;&gt; We glorify God by submitting ourselves to the word that he has given us. Or we try to look for things in the message that don't align. Anytime you begin to look for mistakes in the plan of God, you think to know better than God. &gt;&gt; But brother boss, they're here. I can prove them. Sure, you can prove them. So what? After you've proved them, so what? &gt;&gt; Ask yourself that question. &gt;&gt; After you've proved that this quote is not right, what will happen? &gt;&gt; What about the other quote that is right? We cannot take one thing and say because I found something that I don't agree with everything else is wrong. &gt;&gt; No. Let me remind you my brothers and sisters this message that we have received many people don't know what it is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This message that we have received many people do not know what it is. There are some people who think the message is William &gt;&gt; Brano &gt;&gt; and so that when the minute they find a mistake in the life of a man they negate the message. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; The message is not William brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is bigger than a man. He cannot make a a man his message. &gt;&gt; But the man must believe the message to become one with the message to bring people to believe him so that not even cancer can stand in his way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you say well there is a message in the message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will tell you. How will you know what is the message then and what is not the message? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If you say there is a message in the message, then you will need someone to help you filter out what is the message in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You see the problem with that? &gt;&gt; You will have to know more than the prophet. &gt;&gt; Are we ready to read some quotes? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sorry, that's just how I preach. I preach as if I'm talking to one person, right? &gt;&gt; So bear with me, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh so I want to read a few quotes here and then uh we'll circle back to my idea because we have to understand what has been committed to us what God has given us so we can understand how to protect it and how to cherish it. &gt;&gt; You know if someone doesn't understand their responsibility they will never know how they will be judged. It's the end of the year. Many of us are approaching year end evaluation performance reviews at work. Imagine you've spent all these years you've been working but you don't know what you're supposed to be doing. So the prophet God told him if you can get people to believe in you not even cancer will stand in your way. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Because in his days cancer was as high as they come in forms of sickness. Now today we give every sickness the name of cancer. &gt;&gt; Some people are even dying of cancers that they don't have. But here's what brother Brham says in the sermon gifts and calling are without repentance from 1950. I think it says 030 0. Brother Brham says I don't know if you're projecting them but it's in paragraph 21 says he told me if I get the people to believe me. Okay. And then brother Brham says that seems strange for me to say this. You believe me? Aren't you supposed to believe God? You must believe that. Is someone projecting them? Cuz I don't want after I leave here people say that brother came and he read some quotes that we cannot find. All right. So no, I don't want that. It's a 50-03000. And then it's in paragraph 21. You must believe that you must believe God and believe Christ. And then he says, you must believe the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 21. Okay. Then after believing all of them, God wants you to believe me. &gt;&gt; Yes. That one right there. Paragraph 21. Right there where you are. I see that. All right. If I can if I can get people to believe me. He says, "That seems strange for me to have to say this. You believe in me." Brother Brown is speaking. Aren't you supposed to believe in God? You must believe that. You must believe God and believe Christ and believe the Holy Ghost. Then let's read this part together. Then after believing all of them, God wants you to believe me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God wants you to believe his prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That means even if you think the prophet did something wrong, leave it up to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't give yourself a responsibility that God did not give you to correct a man that God sent. &gt;&gt; Just accept it. &gt;&gt; Go on the day of judgment and say, "God, I believed your servant. I believe the one you sent to us." and leave it at that. &gt;&gt; Are we still together? &gt;&gt; Now you can believe a man &gt;&gt; and still the gift won't work for you. The reason today people believe in God, it's still Jesus, right? So he's developing a thought in here to explain to us that we don't just stop us saying I believe the Bible this book we believe it he is not denying that but he is saying after you have believed this Bible you need to believe the voice of God in your day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to believe the voice of God in your day so that you can receive God's blessing for your day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you go with me to the book of Mark, Mark chapter 10, it's the story of the young rich ruler. Jesus said to him, "Why do you verse 18, why do you call me good? No one is good but one that is God." So he said, "You know the commandments. Do not commit adultery. Do not murder. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Do not defraud. Honor your father and your mother. All of those things are good. It's the law of Moses. They are equivalent today of our Bible. Verse 20. And he answered and said to him, "Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth." Then Jesus looking at him, Jesus loved him. There was a an attribute about this young man that Jesus loved. He obeyed what he knew. But Jesus said to him, "You lack one thing, not many things." Many of us are not missing heaven because of many things. We are missing heaven because of one thing. Go your way. Sell whatever you have. the law of Moses, you go sell that. I will explain that in a minute. Okay? And give it to the poor. The physical material, the things that you have, you love so much, go give them to the poor. As if those poor people don't need God. They also need God. And then he says, "You will have a treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me." &gt;&gt; So Christ did not come to abolish the law of Moses. &gt;&gt; He says, "I came to fulfill the law." &gt;&gt; So there is no contradiction between who Christ is and what the law is. But the thing is this, the law was never meant to be doctrine. The law was only a shepherd, a guardian to point us to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't meant to be doctrine. &gt;&gt; When we begin to make thou must, thou must not the doctrine of the church, we kick people of God out of the church. &gt;&gt; I hope you can see that. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we begin to rule people with an iron fist, &gt;&gt; we will send God's children out &gt;&gt; because we will tell you if your skirt doesn't reach the floor, you're not a bride. &gt;&gt; Did God give us a measurement? &gt;&gt; So why are we putting rules on God's children that God did not put? &gt;&gt; You read the Bible, it tells you, "Let the strong bear with the weak. You take the weak, you kick them out because they don't look like you. &gt;&gt; Where is the bearing with one another partner? &gt;&gt; That brother is still struggling with uh alcohol. You say, "We don't want you in our church." &gt;&gt; The best place for a sinner to be is in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We come here for transformation. &gt;&gt; And you hope that someday the word will hit the person and they will say, "Wow, amazing. grace. I was blind today. I see. &gt;&gt; But we say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. If it doesn't look like us, it doesn't talk like us. It doesn't listen like us. We are kicking it out. And Jesus Christ says, for this reason, I came in the world. &gt;&gt; I came to bear record of the truth. &gt;&gt; I came to bear record of the truth. That means I came so you can have a standard of what is truth. &gt;&gt; Because he told us up until he came, every man had a right to their own opinion of who God was. For some people, God was Moses. For some people, God was Elijah. But he says, none of those was God. I am God. &gt;&gt; I came to bear a record of the truth. I am the way. I am the truth. And I am the life. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in other words, from now on, if you want to know what God looks like, look at me. &gt;&gt; If you want to know how God acts, look at me. I am God. I gave the law. If a woman is caught in adultery, she shall be stoned to death. That is the law of Moses. They catch a woman in adultery. They bring him to the lawgiver. They say, "What does the law say?" He looks at them and he says, "Whoever is without a sin, &gt;&gt; let him be the first one to cast a stone, &gt;&gt; did the word break the word? &gt;&gt; Why are we trying to make the word break the word?" Then &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy on us. &gt;&gt; We must wake up and realize that God has called us to believe his word. &gt;&gt; God did not call us to kick his other children out. Our attitude in the house of God says a lot about us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me give you a story. The prodigal son. &gt;&gt; The prodigal son one day he gets enough of his father's house. Now I will ask you a question. I want you to be sincere. Have you ever been a prodigal son at any point in your life? I'll say yes many times. All right. You just get fed up of the things in the house of your father. You say, "God, just fill me with the power of William Brham and then I'll go out there and live my life the way I want to live it. God, just fill me with the revelation of the word. I'll go out there and I'll do whatever I want to do." Don't think like that. William Brham had the revelation. He had the power, but he did not amuse himself any way he wanted. &gt;&gt; We are constrained by the love of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just because I love God and I know the word of God does not mean I can do anything I want. &gt;&gt; May I remind you that God does not give any man authority without limit. &gt;&gt; Husband, love your wives. Wives be submissive to your husband. &gt;&gt; Husbands will sit there and say, "Now I'm a king. You must treat me like a king." Mhm. &gt;&gt; No sir. No sir. Watch out. That's right. Because God didn't say she will be submissive to you unto death. No sir. &gt;&gt; She said you love her as Christ loved his bride. &gt;&gt; So if there is anyone who must die for the other in that relationship, it's you the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz Christ died for his bride. And at no point did Christ ask the bride to die for her. For him. &gt;&gt; No. He laid down his life so she can have life. &gt;&gt; So God doesn't give any man authority to become a dictator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He gives you enough authority to become a humble servant. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Recognizing that without this authority of Christ, I am nothing. &gt;&gt; I'm here for Christ and I serve Christ only. So the prodigal son said, "Father, give me my authority. Give me my inheritance. I'll go live my life however I want." Father says, "Sure, one day it will be yours. Prove your quality. Show that you are mature enough. You will have it. Go to the upper room and wait for it." Try in Jerusalem until you're filled with power. You say, "Lord, that's too much for me. I don't want that. I'll go live my life however I want it to be." So the father says, "I cannot bind you. I won't keep you a prisoner in my own house because I'm a god of love and I'm also a god who sets people free. &gt;&gt; I will set you free. The prodigal son goes out there with his wealth. But who does he live in the house? His older brother. And many of us rejoice and say at least the father had one son left in the house. If the prodigal son had never come back, we wouldn't have known that the father stayed with a sinner in the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not until the son comes back that we hear him saying, "Why are you doing this for that unworthy son of yours?" Very good. &gt;&gt; We look at the sinner out there. We say, "God, why do you bless those sinners out there? You don't bless me." Now, the good thing is this. The prodigal son did not come to his older brother's house. &gt;&gt; He came back to the house of his father. Yes. &gt;&gt; So you go on your knees and you cry, "Our Father, who art in heaven," but you believe you're the only child. At what point do you stop and look at other children of God and say, "We need to go after the lost souls." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the best way to go after the lost souls is to live a life that will be salty enough for them to draw them back to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, the older brother says, "No, no, no, no. I've been with you all my life here. Not even a goat have you given me to slaughter with my friends. But this one who went and he wasted his life. He comes back. Look at the fist you're throwing for him." So, you're just happy to be in the house of God, &gt;&gt; but you live there with hatred. &gt;&gt; I still show up to service. The pastor can't tell me anything wrong. You're in church, you're dying with pride. The pastor doesn't mind. I just show up in church. I pay my tithe. Do you really think God died for your tithe? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; God died for your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Ezekiel comes and he tells us, "The soul that sins is the soul that shall die." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if your soul is not yet born again, we can rest assured of one destination. &gt;&gt; Death leads to hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes tells us that the way in which a tree leans is the way it falls. &gt;&gt; That means death does not change your eternal destiny. &gt;&gt; It simply takes you there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. your decision and your choices while you're still alive, they are the ones that determine your eternal destiny. &gt;&gt; So don't be the prodigal son. Don't just rejoice to show up in church. Don't just rejoice to say, "I am still in my father's house." But you live in your heart with every bad habit. That will not help you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That will not help you. So Jesus looked at his disciples and he says the first shall be last. &gt;&gt; But this young rich ruler where we were in Mark, Jesus tells him, "Go sell everything that you have and give it to the poor and then you take up your cross and follow me." &gt;&gt; Now what is Jesus asking him to follow? Jesus was the revealed word of their day. Jesus is telling him the law and everything that you have done was good for a time but that will not open the way to heaven. Now you have to believe the revealed word of your day which is Jesus Christ. Take up your cross and follow the revealed word of your day. Today we can say take up your cross and follow this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So it's not just oh they also preach the Bible. I can go there. &gt;&gt; That's not the revealed word of your day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Catholic preach the Bible. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Pentecostals preach the Bible. &gt;&gt; The Baptists preach the Bible. We say thank you God for that. But here's the thing. The bride is more than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride realizes that there is a portion of the word that God leaves for each generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible is complete. &gt;&gt; Let me help someone see this. This is the will of God for every human being. &gt;&gt; Amen. This &gt;&gt; is the will of God for every human being. &gt;&gt; But in this will of God, there is a will of God for every dispensation, &gt;&gt; for every age. So whenever you look there, you have to know it's not just steps. We are climbing higher and higher and higher and higher. Times are changing, &gt;&gt; seasons are changing, &gt;&gt; but we know the master of it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the master of times and seasons. And in every time, in every season, he reveals himself differently. &gt;&gt; I am God. I change not. We say amen. But my revelation &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My revelation does not remain the same. &gt;&gt; A revelation changes. And as revelation changes, the bride is the group that identifies that which is revealed in their day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They identify with it. They believe it. They become it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So if you want to know whether you are the bride, it's not church attendance. &gt;&gt; The bride doesn't come to church. &gt;&gt; Listen to this carefully. The bride doesn't go to church. The bride is the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're still together. &gt;&gt; I can stop here or we still have energy for a few &gt;&gt; All right. Let us read a few quotes here in the United under one head. I believe it was actually the sermon that the brother was playing here this morning. Brother Brandham says in paragraph 75 we notice uh that's 58-0326 united under one head. Now we notice then God takes the heart he takes control right God takes control of your heart. So that's why God asks you to love him with your entire heart. Not just to love him with your lips. You come to church, you sing hallelujah, praise the Lord. Amen. But the heart is far from him. So he tells us in the Bible, in the Old Testament, these people approach me only with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. So the Bible says as a man thinks in his heart, so is he. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, not so he will become. &gt;&gt; So is he right now? What you think of the word of God in your heart is what you are. So God takes the heart. Paragraph 75. He takes control. God wants to be in control of your heart. Now when sin came in and upset your heart and the devil come in and it blocked it all off, what? The connection with God was severed because of sin. But then God sent his own son made in the likeness of sinful flesh to cleanse the heart so that he could come in. So God sent his own son to do what the blood of animals could not do. The blood of animals could not pave the way for God to come and dwell in your heart. Because the blood of animals could not take your sins away. It could only cover it. That is why in the Old Testament, if you read carefully, the requirement for a lamp was a one-year-old lamp. The age of the animal determined the longevity of the purification of the atonement. All right? It was one year old. So every year they had to go back. They had to go back. But Christ who is without age, eternal when he died and offered his blood in the holiest of holies, because it has no age, the question of sacrifice is ended. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you know. &gt;&gt; Okay. Christ is without age. &gt;&gt; When he died here on earth, when he was crucified at the cross of Calvary, there are three things that took place and I want you to remember them for the rest of your life. They are very important. On earth, the curtain of the temple was torn. Amen. &gt;&gt; All of these are written in the Bible. Okay. The curtain of the temple was torn. People can now see the holiest of holies. When they look in there, no more glory. &gt;&gt; Why? The glory is right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In hell, his soul went to hell. &gt;&gt; That's what Peter tells us. And brother Brandham says he went in there to take the keys, &gt;&gt; that which was binding the children of God. &gt;&gt; That power, keys are power. &gt;&gt; That power that Satan thought he had over us when Christ died when we call upon the name of Jesus Christ, every demon in hell on that day &gt;&gt; recognized that a greater power than us is here. &gt;&gt; They gave him the keys. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the third thing that happened, he went to heaven, &gt;&gt; to the innermost place in the very presence of God. He went there as a high priest, not with the blood of animals, brothers. He went there with his own blood. &gt;&gt; And that pleased God. &gt;&gt; There was no sin in that. Yes. &gt;&gt; From that day on, he says, "When you sin against me, I will not require your blood anymore. &gt;&gt; I will look at that of my son." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, don't let Satan hold you captive by the sins you did yesterday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan remind you of what you did 10 10,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, God saves your soul. He doesn't wipe your memory. &gt;&gt; Amen. God saves your soul. He doesn't wipe your memory. It's your own responsibility to tell your memory yesterday is gone. &gt;&gt; Another day has come. &gt;&gt; Do something new in my life. &gt;&gt; Today is a new day. &gt;&gt; Let God do something new. &gt;&gt; You know that also means something else. The Bible tells us the mercies of God are renewed every day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't outrun the mercies of God. &gt;&gt; Just stay with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, brother Brham is trying to show us that God took control by those three events that happened. Every realm, every dimension, God went there and he conquered. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, what he tells his children is to believe on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe on him. Accept the word of God. Believe the word of God. Don't let Satan hold you captive by what happened yesterday. The sins of yesterday are forgiven. &gt;&gt; Your brothers and your sisters, they may not forget what you did yesterday. Because there are some human beings who don't go fishing. The only time they go fishing, it's in God's sea of forgetfulness. They go over there to start looking for what you did yesterday. &gt;&gt; But you remember last year you did this. God says, "I don't remember that. &gt;&gt; Love God. &gt;&gt; Obey his word. &gt;&gt; Apply the blood on your soul. &gt;&gt; Your sins are forgiven. &gt;&gt; Men may condemn you. Men may remember what you did. But God will look at you and say, "That's my beloved son. I'm pleased in him. I'm pleased in my daughter. So let not the condemnation of men and their judgments be the reason why you backslide. &gt;&gt; Are we still together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought I didn't have enough to preach this morning. &gt;&gt; We'll read one more quote and then we'll stop there. in the sermon trying to do God a service without being his the will of God. So 650718 18 yeah trying to do God that one paragraph 177 brother Brham says the word the evening message must carry evening results. The evening message must carry evening results. &gt;&gt; Not first church age results. No, they had faith. Yes, we want faith. But God has added to that faith. &gt;&gt; Right? Don't get stuck on faith and say, "I believe." No. By the authority of the word, we know that even Satan believes. &gt;&gt; Yes. So go beyond that. &gt;&gt; You know the Bible says all things are possible to them that believe, &gt;&gt; right? But he never said in what you believe. &gt;&gt; In all all things are possible to them that believe. You can have faith in a wrong thing. &gt;&gt; You can have faith in the wrong thing. Faith is not what determines righteousness. God is the one who determines righteousness. &gt;&gt; Your faith can be in the wrong thing. But here's the surprising thing. It can still produce results. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want me to tell you something that will shock you? You can believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and you'll still be saved because all you have to do is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation. &gt;&gt; The names are not Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They are titles. &gt;&gt; You can believe on that and still be saved. That's salvation. &gt;&gt; That's not the baptism of the Holy Spirit. All right. Now, brother Brham goes on and he says, he goes even further in discerning of spirit. He says you can have the baptism of the Holy Spirit under that belief. Church is quiet, so we have to read it so you don't say, "I'm so &gt;&gt; Church is very quiet, so I have to read you the quote so you don't say, "Brother Boss, you brought a lie in church." So let's read it together. All right. In demonology in demonology. So that's 530609A. Uh that's the religious realm. You're in you're in the physical realm. All right. So let's begin from paragraph 45 somewhere around there. See I told you I don't have a message to preach to you. I only take what the prophet gave and I give it to you. &gt;&gt; God is responsible for his word. I'm not responsible. &gt;&gt; If you haven't picked it up by now, I believe everything the prophet said. &gt;&gt; No exception. I don't try to make it work. All right. So now scroll down a little bit. Yes. I was right up here in Indiana at a certain group, certain place called Mishawaka. The first group of Pentecostal people I ever seen. They were called the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ, I believe, or something like that. Wonderful bunch of people. Now they have organized together and called them United Pentecostal. They break up from the rest of them because of an issue of water baptism. That doesn't make them any hypocrite. So I hope first of all you can see the thought of the prophet. Don't ever call a brother a hypocrite because he believes something you don't agree with. Okay? Says there there is many a genuine real genuine Holy Ghostborn again Christians in their ranks. read the next part. &gt;&gt; Okay. And then Am I the one who say that? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; All right. Why God give them the Holy Ghost who obeys him. &gt;&gt; You can have the right doctrine and disobey God. &gt;&gt; That is the reason brother Branam says doctrine does not save. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll repeat it. Doctrine does not save. &gt;&gt; It's obedience to what you know that saves you. If we are talking of doctrine, Judas had a good one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Judas, &gt;&gt; he believed on Jesus Christ, but he did not obey Jesus Christ. Because when it came to fulfilling the righteousness of God, he chose money. Now if you just forget and them that wants to be one way, let them be. You go ahead and be brothers. Don't break fellowship over things of doctrine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't break fellowship over the issue of doctrine. But we have over,200 sermons, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Did brother Brandham preach preach all those sermons in the in the churches that had his doctrine? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Why do message believers then accept the message but don't accept the conduct of the messenger? &gt;&gt; And I want you to know I am not trying to emphasize or tell you go to the denominations. Far from that. Get out of there. come out from among them. &gt;&gt; But this is what I want you to know. If you believe you have the truth, you should have no problem going in the house of Simon. &gt;&gt; But if you're afraid to go in the house of Simon, it's because you're not sure of what you believe in. &gt;&gt; Jesus was sure of what he believed in. I Paul says, "I know in whom I have believed." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Be sure of the one you believe in. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you are sure of the one you believe in, you will have no problem going there even if you know he will not entertain you. But you're not going there for Simon. You're going there for that prostitute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So let us go back to the meat of our sermon. &gt;&gt; I promise you this time I'm finishing. &gt;&gt; So the evening message must carry evening results. Amen. &gt;&gt; The evening message must sow evening seeds, not morning seeds. Evening seeds. But the evening time message will show will show evening time light. It will show evening time results. The evening time message. &gt;&gt; So in the same sermon, he continues, we're still in trying to do God a service without being the will of God. He says, how will he take his bride? By the word. Not by a new cart. Not by some theologian's idea, but according to his word, he will identify her. Don't put one thing to eat or take one thing from it. Now, leave it the way it is. That's how we accept the word of God. So, as I finish, I want to tell you this. God has given us his word. When we accept the word and we show God that we believe, he comes and he seals it with a seal, the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Brothers and sisters, don't let anything make you fall short of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Sometimes troubles come in your life. Remember something. Trouble comes from Satan. God is not a troublemaker. &gt;&gt; God will allow you to to go through trials. He's trying to prove your character. After those trials, there is a reward. &gt;&gt; Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Accept the trials. Don't look at the trials and say, "This is too hard for me." No, simply say, "Lord, you allowed for this to come because you know by the faith that you have put in me through your word, I will overcome." &gt;&gt; Because no temptation will overtake you that exceeds your faith. &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ by the authority of the word, he has told us resist the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he will flee from you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's how you guard what has been entrusted to you &gt;&gt; by the help of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So let us read this last scripture here as I finish. Lego. Go with me in the book of Timothy. 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 13 and 14. The Bible says hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me. The messenger of the age is speaking. That is Paul speaking to his age. I want you to just remember there it applies to us as well. 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse3. Hold first the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. That good thing which was committed to you keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want to overcome, receive the Holy Spirit. He will help you overcome. &gt;&gt; God bless you, [Applause] &gt;&gt; brother Moses. Thank you. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. I enjoy that. Beautiful. I warned you it will be soft but nice. Very well cooked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we enjoy it. Let's give a hand to the Lord once again. Thank you, Lord, for that. Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, brother. God bless you, Rich Larry. There's so many things uh so many good nuggets and just some proper food. But may God help us just to to good and to keep what has been committed to us. We have the perfect word, the perfect interpretation with perfect vindication, [Music] perfect love may just help us to keep us to keep it and to value it the more and more as we see the day passing. Amen. Did you enjoy the word of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's let's let's sing that song. Every promise in the book is mine. Every &gt;&gt; every promise in the book is mine. Every chapter, every verse, every line. I am trusting in his love divine. Every promise in the book is mine. Every promise for the bride is mine. Every message, every goal, every line. I am trusting in his love divine. Every promise for the bride is mine. Oh mine, mine, mine. Jesus is mine. Oh mine. When I'm weary, my man, [Music] my mind. Jesus is mine. Jesus is mine all the time. And I love him better every day. Close by his side. I will. I love you better every day. Oh, that's enough to make me sing. That's enough to make me sing. My sins are all forgiven and I'm on my way to heaven. That's enough to make me Make me sing. Oh, give me all in my l keep me burning. Give me all in my l I pray. Give me all in my keep me burning. Oh give me burning till the break of day. [Music] Sing hosana. Sing hosana. Sing hosana to the king of kings. Sing hosana. Sing hosana. Sing hosana to the king. One more time. Sing hosana. Sing hosana. Sing hosana to the king of kings. Oh, sing hosana. Sing hosana. Sing sing hosana to the king. Amen. Do you know that song ageless one? So yeah, let let's see them. I like that thought. You know each lamb has one year but this one has no age no no no year. So when he come and he dies for you it's eternal salvation. &gt;&gt; You are not saved today and next year you have to come God save me one more time. No. If you are saved and filled with the Holy Ghost is until destination. If he has washed your sins they are put in the sea of forgetfulness not to remember them anymore. &gt;&gt; That's why it's a good report. Amen. What the doctor is saying is not the final report. What God says is the final report. Amen. Whatever you are going through, trial, whatever you are going through, God, you have the last word. &gt;&gt; Because you are the ageless one. You have the final word, Lord. And I want to love you. Not only love you, but I want to obey you. Oh, thank you, brother. I want to go to the next step. I want to obey you. I want to follow your word. Not only doctrines but I want the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh ageless one faithful and so unchanging one. You're my rock of peace. Lord of host, I depend on you. I call out to you to you again and again. I call out to you. Again and again, [Music] &gt;&gt; you are the rock. Oh, in times of trouble, you lift me up. Sister, you have to help me &gt;&gt; for the all through the storm. Your love is the anchor. My hope is in you. Let's try to reduce a little bit. I think I'm struggling there. &gt;&gt; Faithful one, so unchanging, ageless one. You're my rock of peace, Lord of all. I depend on you. Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; I call to you again and again. I call to you. [Music] Again. [Applause] You are my in times of trouble. You lift me up when I fall down all through the storm. Your love is the anchor. My hope is in you. Oh Lord, you are my rock. One more time. You are my rock in times of trouble. You lift me up when I fall down all through the storm. Your love is the anchor. My hope is in you alone. &gt;&gt; Let just all of us go to the Lord in prayer. The music is just playing softly. Tell him Lord I want to keep by your grace what you have committed unto me. You have given me Lord the message of the hour. You have given me the Holy Ghost. You have given me father message that's changing my heart. that has to change my heart to be a heart like yours. Father Lord, help me by your grace to be more obedient to you, to love you more and to express my love towards you by living what you have given me to do. Just let the good Lord in prayer each individual. [Music] Father, we thank you Lord Jesus Christ this morning as the word came spoke to our heart. Father Lord we thank you father for the servant that we have used. Thank you father for the vessel that you have sanctified and put aside but you also put him into service to speak to our heart this morning. Father Lord we came Lord expecting we are returning our homes changed. We are returning the home father filled as we have been feisting upon the word of truth. Father, thank you for the warning. But sometimes, Lord, we think that we might be the filtering of your word and to know like this prophet says this, but I believe this part and I leave the other part. But, Father Lord, we desire to God what you have given us to keep it the way it has been given to us without compromising it. Father Lord without hybridating it father if we hybrid what we have we receive it won't be pure anymore and won't produce the result anymore as the court said father Lord the evening message comes to produce the evening result the word that we have received father shall meet the challenge of the age but as long as we keep it pure as long as we accept it Lord you have given us a recommendation to accept the word to receive the book and to eat it up, Father. Not to take a part of it, but to eat it up the all of it in our heart and to receive it, Father, at what we desire to do, Lord, to accept your word, to accept you, to take you at your word, to believe it. Lord, help the men of home, the heads of home, Lord, to take the position as we have been Lord recommended this morning. Help us to apply the token with love to apply the token father Lord with commitment like to show our life by example Lord that our life might match what the word of God says align yourself with you Lord we realize that we cannot do it on our own it's only by your grace father give us Lord that give us more of the Holy Spirit Lord that we can come to the place where it's not you not us living but it's you living your own life through But Lord, we desire our heart to be willing. What we desire is to surrender ourself to you. Lord, this evening, this morning, we open our heart to say, Lord, we surrender all to you. We surrender all everything to you for you to have the preeminence as the secret is being unfolded. The three-fold secret of God, purpose of God, Lord, you have been manifested in Christ. As has been preached this morning, Christ was Lord, the transition from the Lord to the grace. But now, Father Lord, the bride is the manifestation of Christ. Lord, you want to have the full preeminence in the bride. Lord, we surrender ourself to you, Lord. So that you can have the primance in our heart. Lord, we surrender our whole to you, Lord. So that you reign and rule in our heart, in our house, Lord, the husband, the wives, the children, Lord, that you reign and lord. Father, thank you Lord for the word. Thank you for the message of the hour. Thank you for your servant. Thank father for the revelation you have unfolded once again this morning. You don't change but the revelation of God increases Lord. Thought the revelation of the word that we have today is greater than revelation in time of Luther is greater than revelation in time of Wesley greater the revelation in time of the Pentecostal. Father we have received a greater revelation of the same God who does not change. Father help us to get into that revelation that becomes a reality to us. Lord we love you. We appreciate you. Thank you for the brother. Thank you for the sister that came this morning. the leak of fire Lord that we could Lord benefit from one another Lord encourage one another we love you and appreciate you Lord it's good to be in your house to be good good to be in the body of Christ father we came sometimes weak but when we see our sister praising the Lord we see our brother praising the Lord oh God we feel encouraged we see Christ working as you have reminded us this morning Lord the bride is not only Lord the coming to church but the bride is the church. We are the church. Father, when we see one another, oh God, we see you working through my brother, do you working to my sister, oh God, we feel encouraged. Thank you for giving me a brother. Thank you for giving me a sister. Thank you for giving me a father. Thank you for giving me a mother, Lord, in the church. Lord, thank you for giving me children, oh God, that we can help one another. We are so thankful for what you have done. We give you the glory and the honor. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful message this morning. &gt;&gt; Very good. Amen. Brother, may you visit us more. &gt;&gt; Not only for circumstances. We we will pray. Uh let's pray for our father-in-law. Amen. Father-in-law that he came to visit. We need also to pray for him and for full recovery. Is it okay if you give me one moment just to pray for that knee? just comes to my mind for a moment just to unite our faith and for that let's bow our heads once again for the Lord Jesus Christ the prophet says we can never pray enough Lord we just comes to my mind right now once again Lord for the need Lord for the father-in-law Lord that I had a health issue father Lord but Lord as we heard this morning you are the one who has the last word you are the one who have the final say father Lord and your report is always good. By your stripes, we are already healed, Lord. So Lord, we send the word to our father where he is Lord in Calgary or on the area of Calgary. May you touch him, Father. May you restore him, Lord Jesus Christ. May the strength, Lord, come back and and increase greater and greater and greater, Lord. Father, we commit him to you, Lord. Father, maybe you have you have you have you have allowed this to happen here so that maybe maybe maybe so that someone today could be blessed through the ministry. But Father, now as we have been blessed, would you please Father restore him completely? Father, Lord Jesus Christ, you are in control of every situation. God, you are never late. As we heard in the song say, you are never late. Father, we just want to trust you. Have that right attitude. Say father let father let your name be praised and glorified even in the midst of this trial. Lord you will get the glory and the honor. Father we thank you and appreciate you. Father we pray that you visit the family and restore them in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's sing one last song and we'll be dismissed. I'm just taking my repository and brother Andrew took one of my song if I been think to sing then sings my soul. How great the heart has been in my heart and then he sang it this morning and I was like oh we're in the same channel but it's hard when the one person takes a song when you're in the same channel. So but it's good. It was a I just want to say let let's give it the I we shall see the king and we shall see the king &gt;&gt; then this one time. Oh, it may be evening, morning or afternoon.
