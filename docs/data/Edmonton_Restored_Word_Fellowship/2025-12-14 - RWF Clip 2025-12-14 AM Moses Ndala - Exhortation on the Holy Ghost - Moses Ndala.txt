TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Wonderful. Thank God for that. Thank God for now. I don't know which way to go. Everything has been covered, but we just thank the Lord how God has been leading and God has been to God. There's no nothing as important as Holy Ghost. Without the Holy Ghost, you just church member and one of the categories of those tribulation. Not trying to put the just trying to say that the Holy Ghost is a must. is a must not an option. It's a must must be born again must receive the Holy Ghost. Thank God for that inspiration from really each believer to be not in a doubtful way not try to create fear but just check me Lord am I born again I'm not I desire again there is one thing brother said so We can preach about it but only God can give you the Holy Ghost. No preacher can give you the Holy Ghost. No parent can give you Holy Ghost. God must be desire and God is just the Holy Spirit leading us. Think it was a very wonderful service on Sunday past Sunday morning. Those were not just very wrong side but it's good the power of choice of decision I think it was a prep service you must make a choice you have where you have to make a choice where you have to make a decision. God doesn't just fill you the Holy Ghost without you making then that would be wrong. Okay, I'm a son of God. One day I'll be saved and just la your life. No, that's wrong. That's not the message. So, you have to be serious. Make a decision. You are determined. Do your part. Do your mechanic. God has to do the dynastic part. Be baptized in the water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The remission of your sins and then you be filled with the Holy Ghost. So there's a partition of where you have to be serious. You have to be sincere. And then we went to that Jacob. Jacob was elected before he was even born already. But he had that he had that something you have. It has to be but the preacher can come and try to to wake you up on that area. So you know you a son of God. So this is the part and then because each part each person is different. I was brought in the message not by teaching by life soiet not the message preaching on the ship. I like I tell that story many times the masterpiece a young boy of 10 years what a masterpiece message found that started me but I was desiring that life and then what a masterpiece and my mind over 10 years old I want to be and since then I've always been longing for that life. That's how my makeup is. It's different from others. Another person it is if you don't repent tomorrow you are dead and then he wakes up otherwise if something happens I'm dead and separated from God and that seat get another one was Just a paper and read a paper that's each one is made different but God brings you brother Philip no one talk to me just came to a church let me visit that church I always pass a neighborh just Right. But still my point is is to align with the brother I need the Holy Ghost. I desire the Holy Ghost. I want the Holy Ghost. So Sunday, Friday and brother said this message for the people of children you must be the Holy Ghost. And it is a promise for you. It is a promise for you. God has given people and it's important and it's our burden for us. We want you want to receive and obedience. You need obedience. You can't have the Holy Ghost without obeying the word of God. So you can't be la. No, you have to obey the word of God. You have to be obedient to your stress on that. You have to be obedient to the word of God. You read Lord, I want to align with you might be weak in the flesh, might be struggling, but your desire is I want to. I want I want the Holy Spirit. No, you know, you have to allow the seed that to be expressed fully, not only one time anointing or one time service when you leave the service and then it's a different life. No, it has to be the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the anointed, but has to be a person. There has to be a relationship. There has to be a life. Amen. Thank God for how he's bringing all these things. I want to give you one one scripture. Luke 11:30. If he then if he being evil if he then being evil know how to give good gift onto how much more how much more shall your heavenly give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him, how much more can he give the Holy Spirit to them that ask? If you ask him sincerely, sincerely, he will give you the Holy Spirit. If he doesn't give you the Holy Spirit, Father, I have prayed. I have done my part. I've been obedient. I have I've done my I'm asking, father, you promised me you will give me the Holy Spirit. If my natural father can give me good things because I insist. I ask. How much more the Holy Spirit when I realize the importance of how much does it answer the question?
