[26:04] Amen. I invite you to take your Bibles
[26:06] in second Peter's second Peter
[26:11] chapter 1.
[26:24] I had a rough night on from Friday to
[26:27] Saturday to the point I was wondering.
[26:30] And so now when I wake up, I think the
[26:33] Lord allows me to to sleep a little bit.
[26:36] I've just called I don't think I'll be
[26:38] able to prepare for Sunday and call
[26:41] brother Max and an evangelist is usually
[26:45] always on time.
[26:47] Evangelist does not need a lot of
[26:49] preparation, you know. So
[26:53] he's a I just you call spare tire there
[26:56] in Edmonton. So I would just call him
[26:58] and then as the day was going and I was
[27:01] feeling better and better. So God I'll
[27:04] just just speak on the on the virtue of
[27:07] temperance today.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Second Peter 1
[27:14] 5 and 6 small verse. And besides this,
[27:19] giving all diligence add to your faith
[27:21] virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to
[27:25] knowledge temperance, and to temperance
[27:28] patience, and to patience godliness, and
[27:32] to godliness brotherly kindness, and to
[27:35] brotherly kindness charity. For if these
[27:38] things be in you and abound, they make
[27:41] you that you shall neither be barren or
[27:44] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[27:46] Jesus Christ. But he that lackth these
[27:49] things is blind and cannot see a far off
[27:52] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[27:55] from his old sins.
[27:59] Wherefore the rather brethren, give
[28:01] diligence to make your calling and
[28:03] election sure. For if you do these
[28:05] things, you shall never fall.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless his word. You can
[28:10] have a seat.
[28:23] We had a wonderful service on Friday
[28:26] with the young people. Just wonderful.
[28:28] And uh God bless them richly and just
[28:32] bless those meetings. So we try to do
[28:34] them regularly. We talk about um
[28:37] accountability and how God likes to see
[28:41] reliable people, reliable Christians.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; And uh in the professional work, it's
[28:46] the same thing. You can't have you. Oh,
[28:49] I'm an employee, but I come whenever I
[28:51] want. No, you're not going to be you're
[28:54] not going to last there for
[28:56] a long time. So I'll do whenever it
[28:59] pleases me then I'll do it and then then
[29:01] then you you can't build anything
[29:04] &gt;&gt; if you're not reliable. God wants people
[29:06] are reliable.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; And I think as a Christian as a church
[29:10] and even a family you have to be
[29:12] reliable.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; Imagine you have a husband today is
[29:14] husband tomorrow is not husband. I come
[29:17] whenever I come to I come whenever I
[29:19] want.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; I will take care of you whenever I want
[29:21] you know but
[29:22] &gt;&gt; no you have to be reliable. It's
[29:25] &gt;&gt; just and they responded that may God
[29:27] bless them richly. They just responded
[29:30] to that in a very nice way and I'm
[29:32] committed and just want to build on that
[29:34] and more and more. Amen. God bless you.

[30:44] just want to make his day comfortable.
[30:47] So thank you for taking that s that
[30:48] sacrifice
[30:50] &gt;&gt; for Sunday as well. Amen. So today I
[30:54] just want to speak on the on the fourth
[30:57] virtue there. Temperance
[30:59] after faith after virtue after
[31:02] knowledge. Now we have temperance.
[31:05] Temperance is a prophet doesn't talk too
[31:08] much about it. It's just one if you have
[31:12] this book it's just one page or one two
[31:15] pages. So one leaf but two pages but
[31:19] just wonderful things that he's saying
[31:20] there. So we're just going to comment on
[31:22] some of them in this morning as a study.
[31:25] I hope it's fine. Amen.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Just go. And says paragraph 221 he says
[31:32] temperance does not mean stop drinking
[31:35] alcohol here either.
[31:39] Says not it's not it's not it's not
[31:42] necessary stop drinking alcohol here
[31:44] neither. No, no, temperance doesn't mean
[31:48] alcohol, alcoholic cure. Not in this
[31:52] case. This is Bible temperance. This is
[31:55] Holy Spirit temperance. So the title of
[31:58] my message that why I took it, it's a
[32:00] holy spirit temperance.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; As is saying that it does not mean to
[32:04] stop drinking alcohol doesn't mean that
[32:06] you have you can continue to drink
[32:08] alcohol.
[32:10] just say you know in this case it
[32:12] doesn't apply to that because it's it's
[32:15] going to be something way further than
[32:17] that but not in another case by other
[32:20] alcohols it's already be something you
[32:22] should already the holy spirit would
[32:24] have already dealt there before when
[32:26] you're at the level of the new birth
[32:28] because before you get new birth you
[32:30] need you need you need justification you
[32:33] need sanctification you need the holy
[32:35] ghost and then during sanctification as
[32:39] the holy spirit is cleansing you then we
[32:41] take rid of the alcohol, take rid of the
[32:44] wine and all things. I like what what
[32:46] the minister preached the other time
[32:48] brother Steve he says you know uh all
[32:51] the spirit most of the time are just are
[32:53] just um are just comforters spirits are
[32:56] comforters
[32:58] they they just want to comfort you they
[33:00] are substitute mean you are lacking
[33:02] something you maybe you are burden on
[33:04] something I just want to I just want to
[33:06] release myself then you will get on
[33:09] something it might be might be spirit of
[33:12] games and you just video games and
[33:14] something that that's where you feel
[33:16] relaxed and things like that or
[33:17] different things and then if it takes
[33:19] over then it becomes a spirit right and
[33:22] then then the same thing with maybe
[33:25] smoke maybe been battling with smoke and
[33:28] it it at the beginning it started as as
[33:30] a relief something that is helping you
[33:32] to to to feel comfortable those who are
[33:35] going drugs it just start with something
[33:37] you know feel a bit relaxed and I feel I
[33:41] feel high as they call it I feel you
[33:43] know out of worry is out the thing then
[33:46] I feel a little bit better but it's a
[33:47] spirit but but don't let it take it over
[33:51] don't take it on when it take over then
[33:53] it becomes it becomes it's not good so
[33:56] the the best the best thing is don't
[33:58] even start there don't even go there
[34:00] amen that's why the prophet was told the
[34:03] prophet never never never ne never use
[34:06] alcohol never never smoke never alcohol
[34:09] never never defile your body if the
[34:11] woman are things are spirit man once you
[34:14] start on that it will take you over and
[34:16] then even when sometimes you become a
[34:19] Christians that the things that they
[34:21] leave scars on you and you feel like
[34:23] they're still there you are battling
[34:24] upon that then don't even go there don't
[34:27] even start there don't you know you are
[34:29] you are a Nazerite you know a Nazerite a
[34:32] Nazerite is is is one who's dedicated to
[34:35] God if you're dedicated to God you don't
[34:37] even want to touch none of these things
[34:39] don't even get closer to them amen don't
[34:42] even have friends who who like those
[34:44] things because it becomes becomes it
[34:46] becomes a temptation. It becomes
[34:48] something you have to struggle with.
[34:50] Shine any appearance of evil. Leave
[34:52] those things aside. Separate yourself
[34:54] from those things. They have no part in
[34:56] you. God want to use your body for his
[34:59] glory. But don't don't let that the
[35:01] enemy comes upon it and use it for him.
[35:04] But you let your body be used by God
[35:07] through sanctification. Amen. So you
[35:09] separate yourself from those things. It
[35:11] can it can can it can be anything. Can
[35:13] be it can be alcohol, it can be smoked,
[35:16] it can be wine, it can be oh no, I just
[35:19] want to take a little bit. Oh,
[35:22] brother said watch out
[35:25] because once you start there, it'll go
[35:27] over. Amen.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; But there's a sign of a Nazerite. You
[35:32] know Nazarite is Samson was a Nazarite.
[35:35] John the Baptist will say abstain from
[35:37] from those things. Take away from those
[35:39] things. You know when you go to work why
[35:41] they don't put on work why do on work
[35:44] they put you know don't don't bring
[35:47] alcohol to work don't smoke at work all
[35:50] those things they put that if they can
[35:52] do that to work why why you want to do
[35:54] that in church
[35:56] &gt;&gt; no one I think was sharing with someone
[35:59] say I was surprised someone was telling
[36:01] me I forgot to was so I was surprised I
[36:04] saw the priest drunk
[36:07] so you are surprised Well, we we used to
[36:10] have a priest on our family back home.
[36:12] He was a priest. But when there is a
[36:14] party, you forgot that he's a priest.
[36:16] He's completely drunk. Can you imagine a
[36:19] priest drunk? Someone who's supposed to
[36:22] help you. Someone who be supposed to be
[36:24] an example. Then he's drunk. Lost his
[36:26] mind and he's doing anything. Alcohol
[36:29] breaks families. Alcohol breaks
[36:31] marriages. Alcohol destroys families.
[36:34] All that things. So don't the Christians
[36:36] should not be it's not my subject but I
[36:38] just want to put as a comment the
[36:39] prophet saying there no don't go there
[36:42] don't start there don't let it don't be
[36:44] a slave of those things amen
[36:47] &gt;&gt; because it's a mocker wine is a mocker
[36:49] strong drink is a raging whatever it is
[36:51] deceived there that what the Bible says
[36:54] in proverbs 21 is a deceiver but the
[36:57] proverbs 31 says it is not for kings or
[37:00] lameu it is not for kings to drink wine
[37:03] not for princes strong drink Let lest
[37:05] they drink and forget the law and
[37:07] pervert the judgment of any of the
[37:09] afflicted. What is it? It means means it
[37:12] means if you are a king or queen, you
[37:14] should not even be there. And you are
[37:15] queen king and queens. Amen. King or
[37:18] queen because they lose your judgment.
[37:20] You lose your your your your mental
[37:22] judgment. Your your mental capacity puts
[37:25] you in a certain status. It makes you
[37:28] hit your wife. It makes you uh hit your
[37:31] children. It makes you lose money.
[37:34] Just negative things, negative for a
[37:37] moment where you think like you lost,
[37:38] you'll be the happy but it brings you
[37:40] more more problem.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; I say that's not my subject but just
[37:54] want to put a comment. It says it's not
[37:56] about drinking that doesn't mean
[37:57] permission you can go on that not to
[37:59] drinking. You know Jesus all those
[38:02] things are just habit and most of the
[38:03] things are just habit. Temperance in
[38:06] normal way in a normal way if you're not
[38:08] talking about temperance temperament
[38:09] means abstain from doing certain things
[38:12] and that's what's the the usual
[38:14] temperance that we call you know
[38:16] restrain yourself. It's self-control
[38:18] restrain yourself from certain things
[38:20] but you know certain things usually they
[38:21] are just habit but you know habit start
[38:24] by smolding.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Sure. Usually you just you know have you
[38:28] seen a baby we I had my niece she used
[38:31] to to lick her finger suck a thumb.
[38:36] Thank you. That's the right expression.
[38:41] I always like to be the front because
[38:42] she call she's my dictionary English
[38:44] dictionary.
[38:46] So stack of a thumb it started as small
[38:48] thing but then it take over and over and
[38:50] then and then when she grew up it was
[38:53] hard to get rid of it. We put we put we
[38:56] we tried to put things we put bit things
[38:58] and then she put a moment she put and
[39:03] then she just put it
[39:05] put it back again. Oh wow. Then we tried
[39:08] different things and then when she grew
[39:10] up when she then she had a little bit of
[39:13] ah
[39:15] a little bit of something
[39:17] and then when she got when she wanted to
[39:19] get married then she condemned the
[39:20] parent. Why did you leave me with
[39:25] you should have done all the things why
[39:27] now look how I look if you know how we
[39:30] struggle in order to change you but it
[39:34] started as a small things it's just a
[39:35] habit that how habit start just prophet
[39:38] preached from that time on
[39:41] &gt;&gt; you know sometimes oh I the first time
[39:43] that you do something that is wrong it
[39:45] hurts the conscience I shouldn't have
[39:47] not done it and the second time you do
[39:49] it again It hurts you. The third time
[39:52] becomes usual and then and then before
[39:55] you find it, you already gone in certain
[39:57] habit.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; But you know how how to change habit.
[40:01] It's just a habit
[40:03] &gt;&gt; and then the spirit goes in that habit.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; But you know there is also another way
[40:07] to change a habit. Change a different
[40:10] habit.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Start with a small steps and so this is
[40:13] what has been leading me but now I'm
[40:15] taking the opposite. Prophet says you
[40:17] know sometimes the solution to something
[40:20] take the opposite of it
[40:22] &gt;&gt; or usually I'm you know I'm prone to be
[40:24] late or start a little bit early
[40:27] &gt;&gt; 5 minutes a little bit early then become
[40:29] 10 early then becomes 20 early don't
[40:31] just becomes oh that's my habit that's
[40:33] how I'm made no that's not how you made
[40:36] you studied one day and you end up being
[40:38] this way amen so oh this is my this is
[40:42] my way this is my way of being this is
[40:44] my just my way no that's not your way
[40:46] you are not born that way. You made
[40:48] yourself that way. But now take a step.
[40:50] Amen. Take a habit. Jesus had good
[40:53] habit. Good habit.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; He had good habit. The Bible says he was
[40:58] that it was his habit to go and pray.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; That's a good habit. It start maybe for
[41:04] you for us it will start slow. Maybe
[41:06] it's just five minute. But then it
[41:09] becomes a habit. It becomes a habit. I
[41:11] know it's not the Holy Ghost yet, but I
[41:13] I rather have good habit without the
[41:16] Holy Ghost than bad habit without the
[41:18] Holy Ghost.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; That's why we train our children in a
[41:22] good way. That's why the Bible says
[41:24] chain train your child from youth.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; What even means put good habit on the
[41:29] child.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Then when he's older, it becomes harder
[41:33] for him to get away from it. Even if he
[41:36] doesn't have the Holy Ghost yet, but
[41:37] when you start with the good habit, the
[41:39] good thing, the good training, then he
[41:42] will be leaning that way. Amen.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; And the devil even if he comes with
[41:46] different temptation himself, he has not
[41:48] been trained that way. It will be hard
[41:50] for him to move the other way.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Ask example to those who have been
[41:56] married late in life. It's hard
[41:59] marriages when you are married late
[42:02] because you have been stubborn all the
[42:03] way and now to correct the other way.
[42:06] No, this is the way my mother and the
[42:09] I'm your wife is not your mother.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; That was your mother. This is your wife.
[42:14] You have to change different things now.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; But when you're married late, then it
[42:18] becomes harder. I was married late. I
[42:20] was stubborn. She suffered a lot. I'm
[42:23] taking example for myself
[42:26] because it's hard when you're married. I
[42:28] that all my life has been and you
[42:30] thought that it was right but now we
[42:32] have to correct it becomes hard but now
[42:35] when you come from the church we need to
[42:37] change some habit amen have good habit
[42:40] let now let the holy spirit comes upon
[42:42] those habit and becomes automatic you
[42:44] know sometimes you don't have to think
[42:45] about it and it becomes the holy ghost
[42:48] the prophet will go a bit further than
[42:50] that says not only on the natural but it
[42:52] has to go on a certain high level than
[42:54] that amen
[42:59] In the natural, the Bible says
[43:04] Paul uses in the 1 Corinthians 9:25
[43:06] says, "Every man that striveth for the
[43:08] mastery is temporate in all things. Now
[43:10] they do it to obtain a corruptible
[43:13] crown, but we incorruptible an
[43:15] incorruptible crown." Just like athletes
[43:18] they discipline their bodies to win a
[43:20] race, believers must also exercise
[43:22] self-control in certain areas where you
[43:25] have yourself to be tempered into
[43:27] certain areas. You don't you make you
[43:29] make you become a discipline of certain
[43:31] things. You become disciplined not in
[43:32] the natural you become disciplined. A
[43:34] Christian is a disciplined
[43:37] person.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; A Christian should be the best worker.
[43:42] You know, you know when when the message
[43:44] came, sorry to have I can only relate to
[43:46] what I I've lived. When the message came
[43:48] in our country, people many companies
[43:52] wanted to hire only message believers.
[43:54] That's true.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Because they were examples. Oh, if you
[43:57] if you if you hire a message believer,
[43:59] oh, you you will be he will be on time.
[44:02] You'll be in he will be sincere. He'll
[44:04] be he won't be in corruption. It it was
[44:08] it was the it was it was the testimony
[44:10] everywhere. Amen.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Papa Matendo has the same testimony for
[44:14] his work. They have to hire him because
[44:16] think because he was a message believer.
[44:19] If you if you if you hire a message
[44:21] believer, oh for sure it's going to stay
[44:24] very very very
[44:27] full of integrity. Amen. But but over
[44:30] time then sometimes you see that become
[44:32] different things but we don't want to go
[44:34] that way. When a person realizes that
[44:36] he's an inferior complex, the prophet
[44:38] says, or some sort of complex, how may
[44:41] he overcome this, should it be, should
[44:44] it be if he was the only child caused
[44:47] this in his early youth? The prophet
[44:50] says to answer that question, if he
[44:53] finds he have an inferior complex or
[44:55] some sort of complex, how may he
[44:56] overcome this? Prophet says take exactly
[44:59] the opposite. If you are always wanting
[45:03] your way and that one little brat that
[45:05] you want to always have everything your
[45:08] way, turn right back around and give
[45:10] everything you got to the other way. If
[45:13] you are selfish and you want to hold
[45:14] everything, then start giving away what
[45:17] you got. Not only your attention upon
[45:20] yourself, now start giving away. That
[45:22] means you have been having a certain
[45:24] habit where everything has to be upon
[45:25] you. Now you start in the opposite way.
[45:28] You start giving. Start little. Amen.
[45:30] Just go the vice versa that the way to
[45:33] overcome anything is an antidote. My old
[45:36] southern mother used to say hair off the
[45:39] dog back is good for the bite. That
[45:42] applies this way too. Amen. So if you
[45:44] find yourself doing something wrong,
[45:46] just take the opposite. Amen. That's why
[45:48] as I say that's why it's important to
[45:50] start with the children in the right way
[45:52] because it will be hard for them to
[45:54] depart from it when they become older.
[45:56] That's why the Bible says, "These words
[45:58] that I command thee, turn unto me." Say,
[45:59] "These word that I command thee this day
[46:02] shall be in thine heart, and thou shalt
[46:03] teach them diligently unto thy children,
[46:06] and they shall talk and shall talk of
[46:09] them when thou sitest in thine house,
[46:11] and when thou walkest by the way, and
[46:13] when thy lies down, and when thy when
[46:15] thy rises up." It's very important to
[46:18] instruct the children diligently, not
[46:21] occasionally, not sometimes, but you
[46:23] stay persistent. You stay if if it's if
[46:26] an instructions you have to stay if you
[46:28] have you have to stay consistent and
[46:31] persistent in that instruction. Don't
[46:33] waver here then wherever here. Oh, I'm
[46:36] just trying to be nice. Today you are
[46:38] here. Today you are here is not going to
[46:39] work.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; You have to be persistent on a certain
[46:43] instructions and stay firm in that
[46:45] instructions. Amen.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the Bible says. But
[46:49] what we want is the Holy Ghost. We want
[46:52] the Holy Ghost to fill our heart. We
[46:54] want the Holy Ghost to have the full
[46:55] preeminence. We want the Holy Ghost to
[46:58] be the one who's in control of every
[47:00] situation. Even in natural what you do
[47:03] the mechanic in order, but you want the
[47:04] Holy Ghost to come and take over. Amen.
[47:07] We want the Holy Ghost to control in
[47:09] every situation.
[47:11] The Bible says be not drunk with wine
[47:13] wherein is a sexist. This is just an
[47:15] example. But be filled with the spirit.
[47:18] You know in many things what we desire
[47:20] is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit will
[47:22] make a a difference.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't emphasize very often
[47:26] on the Holy Spirit, but let me tell you,
[47:27] the Holy Spirit is the only thing that
[47:29] can give life because the Holy Spirit is
[47:32] God himself.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit changes. The Holy Spirit
[47:35] delivers. The Holy Spirit is the spirit
[47:38] that raised Christ from the dead. If it
[47:40] could raise Christ from the dead, the
[47:41] Holy Spirit has power to break every
[47:43] chain, to break every bondage, to break
[47:46] every feather. The Holy Spirit can
[47:48] deliver you. Amen. The Holy Spirit is
[47:50] here. Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; I believe the Holy Spirit, there's
[47:53] nothing that can can resist the Holy
[47:55] Spirit. If you believe the word of God
[47:57] and yield yourself to the word of God,
[47:59] if you humble yourself, the Holy Spirit
[48:02] can deliver you. Amen.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that is more powerful
[48:06] than the Holy Ghost.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Don't say, "No, I can't. I tried it one
[48:10] time, it didn't work." And then, but let
[48:11] me tell you, just yield your yield
[48:13] yourself to the God. God will deliver
[48:16] you. Amen.
[48:22] You know sometimes when people say you
[48:24] know I'm still on the first paragraph
[48:27] there first line. You see people tell
[48:30] Christians once you become a Christians
[48:32] you're not going to be free anymore. So
[48:35] I'm free now. I'm free. I'm a I'm not a
[48:37] Christian so am I free. I can do
[48:39] anything I want. You know a Christian
[48:41] does everything he wants.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; A Christian does everything he wants. A
[48:46] real Christian does everything he wants.
[48:48] Actually, the one who's a slave is the
[48:51] one who's not a Christian. I will show
[48:53] you why. Because the one who's a the one
[48:57] who's the one who a Christian, if you're
[48:59] a Christian, a born again Christian, you
[49:02] do everything you want, but you do the
[49:05] things that you want from your heart.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; A crow and a dove, they do everything
[49:10] they want. But a dove cannot take the
[49:13] things that the crow does because
[49:15] they're different nature.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit can only feed upon the
[49:20] word of God.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; And the crow can eat anything and he's
[49:23] satisfied. The crow can tell to the
[49:25] dove, you are not free. You know, be
[49:28] like me. I can eat anything I want. So
[49:30] yeah, but the dove can say I'm free too
[49:33] &gt;&gt; and I eat only what I want.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Why you want to push me to eat the
[49:37] things that you take? Because we are not
[49:40] of the same nature. Once I have the Holy
[49:42] Ghost, my desires change. My inner being
[49:45] change and I'm feeding only upon what
[49:48] the Holy Spirit want. Amen.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; So I cannot follow what the world the
[49:52] world want because I'm not of the same
[49:54] nature. Once I have the Holy Ghost, the
[49:56] Holy Ghost has changed me, has
[49:58] transformed me. Amen.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; So the the the real bornagain Christian
[50:03] is free.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Why is free? Because he has been set
[50:06] free by the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; They're being set free by the son of
[50:09] God.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Who the one the son of God set free is
[50:13] free indeed. Amen.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; He said if you hear the truth, the truth
[50:16] shall set you free.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; The word of God will set you free. Amen.
[50:20] And God is here to set you free.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; And you will do whatever the Holy Spirit
[50:25] wants you to do. Amen.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; So don't follow what the world wants.
[50:29] There is always there is always a battle
[50:31] between the flesh and and the soul and
[50:33] the spirit. I I'm aware of that. But
[50:35] don't succumb to the flesh constantly.
[50:37] If you fall, stand up.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; If you find yourself captive, stand up.
[50:42] Amen. Because you are a king. You are a
[50:44] queen. You are you are the the the
[50:46] chosen generation. You are the royal
[50:49] seed of Abraham. You are the bride of
[50:51] Jesus Christ.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; You are the one who is elected for the
[50:54] rapture. Amen.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; You are here to make it. Amen.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; You're not here to be bound by the
[50:59] earth. You are here to go into the
[51:00] rapture.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; You are a son and a daughter of God.
[51:04] Amen. I'm here to proclaim that Satan
[51:06] has no has no authority over you. If
[51:10] you're a son and daughter of God, you
[51:12] are born to be free and you are free.
[51:14] Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Don't be bound by anything of the enemy.
[51:18] You know the the crow and the prophet
[51:20] the prophet talk about that story that
[51:21] that the crow he was already free but he
[51:24] was thinking that he was still bound
[51:26] because he for a long time all his life
[51:28] he has lived with that thing and and
[51:30] then Johnny Johnny thought that oh no
[51:33] I'm still bound by that thing no if
[51:36] after this service how am I going to get
[51:38] out of this you know I'm so used to just
[51:40] to go in my relaxed time just to go on
[51:42] YouTube and watch whatever I want and
[51:44] everything what am I going to don't
[51:47] think about what you are going to do.
[51:49] Just accept the word of God. I'm free
[51:53] &gt;&gt; and God will do the work. Amen.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; The prophet says now if you go away well
[52:02] I can do that. I always do what I want
[52:04] to do. But if you're a Christians you
[52:06] don't want to do the things that's wrong
[52:08] because the very life in you the very
[52:11] foundation if you want to do wrong it
[52:13] shows the wrong thing is in here. How
[52:16] can bitter and sweet water come from the
[52:18] same fountain? So you've been all mixed
[52:20] up on some kind of emotion, fabulous
[52:22] something and other sensation. Forget
[52:24] it. Go back to the altar and say, "God,
[52:27] take my old sinful life away and put me
[52:30] in such a condition that my whole
[52:32] desire, he that is born of God does not
[52:34] commit sin." That's right. He has no
[52:37] desire to do so. Amen.
[52:42] Some say that Christian is not free.
[52:44] Look at him. He might actually be the
[52:45] one who is addicted himself. Addiction
[52:48] is a form of bondage. When someone is
[52:51] mastered by mastered by by by a sinful
[52:54] habit or desire, they become a servant
[52:56] or slave to it. Says, "Oh, if I can't
[53:00] take a cigarette, you know, I feel
[53:01] shaky."
[53:04] But you tell to the Christian, you know,
[53:05] you are not free.
[53:08] You are the one who are not free. You
[53:10] are you are slave to that secret
[53:13] &gt;&gt; because if you don't get it then you
[53:14] become shaky if I don't have it
[53:18] sometimes if I don't have this this oh
[53:24] what kind of life are you
[53:30] &gt;&gt; if I'm don't if I don't do this I'm if I
[53:32] don't if if and now in a new generation
[53:37] that becomes now you see not only
[53:39] children even grown up people. So it's
[53:41] not after church, you know what I time
[53:44] is to spend just to be there playing
[53:46] games and everything. If I don't if I
[53:48] don't do it, I feel like what's going
[53:50] on,
[53:52] something is missing.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; I would like to be bondage to Christ.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; I'll be slave to Christ, prisoner to
[54:00] Christ.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; If I don't go to church, I feel like I'm
[54:03] dying. I would like to have that desire.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; If if I don't pray, I feel like
[54:08] something is is is missing. I would like
[54:10] to have that desire then to go on the
[54:12] other side and you know what if I don't
[54:16] have that
[54:18] I want to be a prison of Christ. Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; I want to be free and prison of Christ.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; The prophet says the Bible says all
[54:26] things are lawful unto me but all things
[54:29] are not expedient. All things are lawful
[54:32] for me but I will not be brought under
[54:34] the power of any. A believer is not born
[54:38] under the power of anything
[54:40] &gt;&gt; except the power of God.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Except the control of the Holy Spirit.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Addiction is something like substance,
[54:48] habit or desire that controls of a
[54:50] person.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; And a Christian should not be bound by
[54:54] any addiction. If anything is bounding,
[54:57] you feel like you can't you can't get
[54:59] rid of it and it have a hold upon you,
[55:02] be careful.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; It's an addiction.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't mean that you are lower.
[55:06] Doesn't mean that you are lost. But
[55:08] because as still as you have life in
[55:11] you, I just want to remind you, you are
[55:13] a son and daughter of God.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; If you feel like you are bound by
[55:17] anything, today is your day of
[55:19] deliverance.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; God has the power to deliver you. As
[55:23] your sister sang, the more I surrender.
[55:25] If you just yield to God, God has the
[55:28] power to deliver you
[55:29] &gt;&gt; if you just surrender yourself to him.
[55:31] Because you must not be under the power
[55:34] of anything except to be under the power
[55:36] of the Holy Ghost. To be a prisoner of
[55:39] Christ. You have been put on earth to be
[55:42] a son and daughter of God. A prisoner to
[55:45] Christ. Not to be prisoner of any other
[55:47] thing. So come to the court of the
[55:49] prophet says here in the statue of
[55:51] perfect man. Temperance doesn't mean
[55:53] stop drinking alcohol either here
[55:56] either. No no temperance doesn't mean al
[55:58] alcoholic. Not in this case. This is
[56:00] Bible temperance. Holy Spirit
[56:02] temperance. Not just one of the last of
[56:05] the flesh. But we are talking about the
[56:07] Holy Spirit temperance. That means how
[56:10] to control your tongue, not to be a
[56:12] tattler, how to control your temper, not
[56:15] to fly off every time anybody speaks
[56:18] cross to you. Oh my.
[56:23] The temperance we are talking about goes
[56:25] beyond addiction cure. As I said,
[56:27] addiction cure one of the steps to be
[56:30] free by the Holy Ghost. So, it goes
[56:32] beyond that. The temperance that the
[56:34] talking here is the temperance of the
[56:36] character. The Holy Ghost temperance is
[56:38] a virtue produced in the life of a
[56:40] believer who walks with God by the Holy
[56:43] Ghost. It is spirit empowered
[56:44] self-control. You can't just say from
[56:47] from that day on I will have temperance.
[56:50] It will fail. Says no. From that on I
[56:52] will from after the service I will be so
[56:54] much with temperance now. it won't work.
[56:58] But if you realize that you lacking that
[57:01] godliness temperance,
[57:04] the Holy Spirit temperance is just to
[57:06] surrender. Lord, help me in that area.
[57:09] Help me in that area that I will have
[57:12] the Holy Spirit temperance.
[57:16] Paul says in Galatians 5:22, "But the
[57:19] fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace,
[57:22] longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
[57:24] faith, meekness, temperance. Against
[57:26] such there is no law." So temperance is
[57:30] a fruit of the Holy Spirit. It's not
[57:32] something you can build up yourself. It
[57:34] has to come from God once you recognize
[57:37] that I need it. Amen.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; It controls your tongue not to be a
[57:41] tattler.
[57:43] You know I like what James says is James
[57:46] as a spirit he as a minister of a pastor
[57:49] he was someone who's on down on earth as
[57:52] among the epistles is one who really put
[57:55] the emphasis about the power of tongue
[57:57] &gt;&gt; in James 3 that's right
[57:59] &gt;&gt; as a pastor he realize what happens in
[58:01] the churches and things know it's
[58:04] usually the problem is the tongue we
[58:06] talk too much we try to express too much
[58:09] that's where the problem is so he
[58:11] addresses that In James 3, let's read it
[58:13] together. James 3 says, "My brethren, be
[58:17] not many masters."
[58:19] That's sometimes where the problem is.
[58:22] Become too many masters. Everybody has,
[58:25] we thank God for, we thank God for the
[58:28] table. We thank God for all the
[58:29] messages. Sometimes when we have all the
[58:32] messages, everyone becomes a master. So
[58:35] I know it. I know it. I know it. I know
[58:37] it. And then it says, "No, be not many
[58:39] masters. know that we shall receive the
[58:42] greater condemnation, but in many things
[58:44] we offend all. If any man offend not in
[58:47] word, the same is a perfect man, and
[58:50] able also to brittle the whole body.
[58:54] Behold, we put beats in the horse's
[58:56] mouth, that they may obey us, and we
[58:58] turn about the whole body. Behold also
[59:02] the the the ships the the the ships
[59:05] which though they be so great and driven
[59:08] or fierce wings yet are they turned
[59:10] about with a very small helm with
[59:14] sosoever the governor listeth. Even so
[59:17] the tongue is a little member and boast
[59:19] of great things. Behold how great a
[59:22] matter a little fire can live. The
[59:25] tongue usually is the problem in the
[59:28] whole body. The tongue can the one be
[59:30] boasting the most and great things and
[59:32] saying things just a small thing. A
[59:35] small member but a very dangerous
[59:37] member.
[59:40] The tongue is a fire a world of
[59:42] iniquity. So is the tongue among our
[59:45] members that it defileth the whole body
[59:48] and set on fire the cause of nature and
[59:51] is set on fire on fire of hell. It's not
[59:54] what Jesus Christ says. It's not what
[59:55] defiles is not what comes in. It's what
[59:57] comes out. Comes out the tongue.
[1:00:02] Problem of the tongue.
[1:00:05] Says for every kind of beast and of
[1:00:07] birds, of serpent, of things in the sea
[1:00:09] is tamed and have been tamed of mankind.
[1:00:12] But the tongue can no maintain. It is
[1:00:15] unruly evil full of deadly poison.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; In the church, the daily poison
[1:00:21] sometimes is a tongue.
[1:00:24] Therewith bless we God, even the Father.
[1:00:27] There we There we bless we God, even the
[1:00:29] Father. There we've cursed we man, which
[1:00:32] are made after the similitude similitude
[1:00:34] of God. Out of the same mouth proceedth
[1:00:37] blessing and cursing, my brethren, these
[1:00:40] things ought not so to be ought not so
[1:00:44] to be. The prophet says in the message
[1:00:48] says the temperance that we are talking
[1:00:50] is to control your tongue not to be a
[1:00:52] tattler. A tattler is a person who
[1:00:54] reports another's wrongdoing.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; There's so many may God be merciful upon
[1:01:00] us so that we don't become tattlers.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Those who report other people's
[1:01:04] wrongdoing.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; The prophet says I think brother shared
[1:01:08] that quote the other day. You know the
[1:01:10] real Christian way is to hide everything
[1:01:12] you can from a brother. Don't tell his
[1:01:15] bad things. Just tell his good things.
[1:01:20] Just tell what you know about him that
[1:01:22] is good.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; If you can take that as a principle will
[1:01:26] have less problem in the church.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Only tell the things that are good about
[1:01:31] someone else.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; If anything is bad, let it alone. Poor
[1:01:36] fellow has got enough against him
[1:01:38] anyhow. Don't try to take a pole and
[1:01:41] shove a man further into the ditch. The
[1:01:43] Christian attitude is to pick him up and
[1:01:46] take him out of the ditch. He's already
[1:01:48] down. If he hear that you talk about his
[1:01:50] negative things to someone else, you
[1:01:52] just putting him down further. But you
[1:01:54] have to come and raise him up. A
[1:01:56] Christian is to take someone who's down
[1:01:58] and raise him up again. So you see,
[1:02:00] don't never try to shove him down. He's
[1:02:02] down already. Try to help him up. But
[1:02:04] too many of us today, too many people
[1:02:07] today, I might say, try to do that. If
[1:02:09] they could just get something another
[1:02:11] then they could say that was really bad.
[1:02:15] You know what the principle of the Bible
[1:02:16] says? It's right settle in the Bible how
[1:02:19] to do handle with problems in the
[1:02:21] church. Amen. Are you with me this
[1:02:23] morning?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Talking about spiritual temperance.
[1:02:28] The principle is set properly in Matthew
[1:02:30] 18:14. He says, "Even so, it is not the
[1:02:34] will of your father which is in heaven
[1:02:36] that one of these little ones should
[1:02:38] perish."
[1:02:40] That's the first statement. God, you
[1:02:44] don't want that person to perish. God
[1:02:47] doesn't want that person to perish.
[1:02:49] Your desire has to be I don't want that
[1:02:52] person to perish.
[1:02:54] I want I want to help that person. I I
[1:02:56] you can't wish hell to even to the worst
[1:02:58] of the enemy. So don't that have to be
[1:03:01] the first attitude. I don't want that
[1:03:02] person to I I'm burdened for that
[1:03:04] person. And then you go further says
[1:03:07] moreover if thy brother shall trespass
[1:03:09] against thee go and tell him his fault
[1:03:12] between thee
[1:03:15] and the pastor.
[1:03:18] No. Go tell him and the deacon. No.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Go tell him and put it on Facebook. M
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; go tell him and spread that in
[1:03:30] Instagram.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:03:33] go tell him between thee and him alone.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Because you have that burden in your
[1:03:40] heart. You wish him good. Go say, you
[1:03:43] know, my brother, my sister, I I've been
[1:03:46] burdened. I prayed. I prayed about it
[1:03:47] and I I feel like it's something that is
[1:03:50] putting a bit down. Do you mind if I
[1:03:52] just spend a little time we talk
[1:03:54] together then we talk and I see like
[1:03:56] this was happening what do you think
[1:03:58] about it and
[1:04:01] sometimes I'm guilty of not doing that I
[1:04:04] agree but if we have to take that other
[1:04:06] approach
[1:04:08] we'll have less problem in the church
[1:04:11] less problem in the families sometimes
[1:04:18] then if shall he or thee and thou gain
[1:04:21] witness thy brother. But if he will not
[1:04:23] hear thee, then take with thee one or
[1:04:25] two more, that in the mouth of two or
[1:04:27] three witnesses, every word may be
[1:04:29] established. Now listen, if he shall
[1:04:33] neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
[1:04:35] church. But if he neglect to hear the
[1:04:37] church, let him be unto thee as an
[1:04:40] heathen man or a publican. Verily, I say
[1:04:42] unto you, whatsoever you shall bind on
[1:04:44] earth shall be bound in heaven.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And whatsoever you shall loose on
[1:04:49] earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I
[1:04:52] say unto thee that if do or if if two of
[1:04:56] you shall agree on earth as touching
[1:04:58] anything that they shall ask, it shall
[1:05:00] be done for them of my father which is
[1:05:03] in heaven. For where two or three are
[1:05:05] gathered together in my name, there am I
[1:05:08] in the midst of them.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Those are wonderful promises of God.
[1:05:13] Wonderful promises of that. And we we I
[1:05:15] pray about that. We pray about it. God,
[1:05:17] we are here in the midst of that because
[1:05:19] two or three are gathered in your name.
[1:05:20] We are here more than two gather in your
[1:05:22] name. But do you know the premises of
[1:05:24] that that that promise here is if you
[1:05:27] have a burden for one another, if you
[1:05:30] can talk to one another freely, if you
[1:05:33] can confess your sins to one another
[1:05:35] freely, otherwise it will be just we
[1:05:38] think that we are agreeing but actually
[1:05:39] we are not agreeing
[1:05:42] because I have something against you but
[1:05:43] I can't tell you because for this reason
[1:05:46] or this reason and then we just pretend
[1:05:48] just to be together.
[1:05:50] No wonder sometimes God doesn't work
[1:05:52] because we don't agree together first
[1:05:55] and the prophet will say it himself
[1:06:05] taking side with Jesus. Are you with me
[1:06:07] this evening?
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; I know it's a little bit of a pastoral
[1:06:10] things but I think it's important. I
[1:06:12] can't just skip it. I think it's
[1:06:14] important to mention it. Now for
[1:06:16] instance if one of you brethren will
[1:06:18] make a mistake and do something that is
[1:06:20] wrong which you are subject to it and I
[1:06:23] am too every one of us as I was sharing
[1:06:25] the young people so you know I was
[1:06:27] reading the prophet says one place says
[1:06:29] God will make your pastor to fail just
[1:06:32] to show that he's a man so that you
[1:06:34] don't put your trust on a man
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; you should expect I will make mistakes
[1:06:40] and someone will make me your brother
[1:06:41] will make mistakes
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; just to show to you that he's a man But
[1:06:46] now it's on your your attitude. What is
[1:06:48] your attitude? When you see your brother
[1:06:50] fall, when you see your pastor fall,
[1:06:51] your deacon fall and someone fall. What
[1:06:54] is your attitude? That where the problem
[1:06:55] is. We are all bound to fail and we will
[1:06:58] fail. Just to show that we are man and
[1:07:00] God we have to rely on God. We have to
[1:07:03] depend on God.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Your wife, the wife will see the husband
[1:07:06] fall and fall sometimes very bad just to
[1:07:09] show that he's a man.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; But what is your attitude towards him?
[1:07:13] That's where the question is. Amen.
[1:07:14] Amen.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Says we are brothers but as long
[1:07:20] but as we go along let's remember we are
[1:07:23] brothers. We are brothers and if we got
[1:07:25] any fighting let's fight with one
[1:07:27] another. Bring it together. Bring it
[1:07:29] before our brethren and settle it. Now
[1:07:32] they used to in the braom the Branham
[1:07:34] family if one of the little ones done
[1:07:35] something they was going to tell Bill
[1:07:38] about it because I was the biggest and I
[1:07:40] have to stand there and see what is
[1:07:41] right and wrong. Well, my decision was
[1:07:43] that which one was right and wrong. And
[1:07:45] if they still don't believe it, then
[1:07:46] they get around behind my back and for
[1:07:48] it out again. They were still brothers.
[1:07:50] You see, they would fight in the
[1:07:52] backyard with one another and fight in
[1:07:54] the front yard for one another.
[1:07:58] How how come the standards become so low
[1:08:01] with now things I don't want to put on
[1:08:04] negative, but things being on the public
[1:08:07] and things where where where are we
[1:08:10] going?
[1:08:12] We are those brands who can fight in the
[1:08:14] behind behind the court there behind but
[1:08:18] in the front are fighting for one
[1:08:19] another. Amen.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; So that the way it was see well we are
[1:08:23] still brothers. We got to do this. If
[1:08:25] you got something against somebody you
[1:08:27] brother don't tell somebody else about
[1:08:29] it.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; If it's wrong go to him and tell him
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; then if he's going to argue with you
[1:08:36] then take somebody else with you. Then
[1:08:38] bring it up the way the Bible says. But
[1:08:40] Jesus, they try to find every little
[1:08:42] shadow that they could find. Try to
[1:08:44] belittle him in the sight of the people.
[1:08:46] That's what the devil wants. They want
[1:08:48] they want to hurt your influence before
[1:08:51] the people. That's the way you want to
[1:08:53] watch careful what you do. Sometimes you
[1:08:56] don't know what you're doing. You are
[1:08:58] doing it. You are under spirit which is
[1:09:00] trying to hurt the influence of the
[1:09:02] person before the people. Don't do that.
[1:09:05] Walk like real man of God. Talk like
[1:09:07] real man of God. Act like real men of
[1:09:10] God. Live like men of God because the
[1:09:13] devil your adversary is going about like
[1:09:16] a roaring lion trying to devour what he
[1:09:18] can. Amen.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Do you know what we are not doing
[1:09:22] anymore? People have be why why
[1:09:24] sometimes we don't want to correct
[1:09:26] people. So brother I have something to
[1:09:28] tell you
[1:09:30] and so yeah I feel like this can we pray
[1:09:34] together? I think that we can. Sometimes
[1:09:37] we don't do that anymore. You know why?
[1:09:39] Because people have become so sensitive.
[1:09:43] We have become so sensitive. Who are you
[1:09:47] to tell me? What what do you think you
[1:09:49] are?
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; You think that you know better than me?
[1:09:52] Yeah. And and because of that people I
[1:09:56] don't want I don't want to tell you I
[1:09:58] don't want problems.
[1:10:01] Sometimes I feel like telling that
[1:10:03] person I
[1:10:05] just leave it alone. you know just go to
[1:10:06] church pray and go that's not your
[1:10:09] problem
[1:10:11] sometimes we have taken attitude I've
[1:10:13] taken sometime that attitude I don't
[1:10:15] want problem
[1:10:18] but actually it's not right
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; you should come to the level where feel
[1:10:21] confident of brother I have that the
[1:10:23] burden I just want to help maybe I don't
[1:10:26] understand what is going here you know
[1:10:29] oh no brother maybe you don't see how it
[1:10:31] can be the other way oh the other way oh
[1:10:33] brother I didn't see that way thank god
[1:10:35] thank you for correct me. Thank you.
[1:10:37] Let's move on together.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; But we want big things, but we are we
[1:10:42] are forgetting that small basic things.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Church.
[1:10:47] Oh, you hurt my feelings.
[1:10:52] My wife is taking some courses for for
[1:10:54] daycare, home care or something like
[1:10:56] that. And that teaching her telling me
[1:10:58] teaching don't rebuke children because
[1:11:00] you don't want to hurt their feelings.
[1:11:04] So, oh now I understand why my some of
[1:11:06] my kids don't always daddy you hurt my
[1:11:08] feelings.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; You have to apologize. You hurt my
[1:11:12] feelings. So, okay. I'm sorry.
[1:11:17] And I imagine start from early age.
[1:11:19] Don't don't hurt people's feelings. If
[1:11:21] you hurt my feelings, you know what? I
[1:11:22] leave the church. I go, you know, then
[1:11:26] you see what you're going to do to me. I
[1:11:28] leave the church. We become so
[1:11:31] sensitive. so sensitive.
[1:11:34] Oh, may God help us.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; The attitude has become if you correct
[1:11:46] me then you know
[1:11:49] it says the prophet says little door we
[1:11:54] want to keep that door private
[1:11:56] and that says sometimes the problem is
[1:11:58] the pride because we I know it's a bad
[1:12:02] feeling to be corrected.
[1:12:04] It's a bad feeling. We have to be
[1:12:06] honest, right? You know, some brother,
[1:12:08] you've been doing this and it's kind you
[1:12:11] feel embarrassed. It's it's bad. I know
[1:12:13] that, you know, you want to be right. I
[1:12:17] know. I understand. We are human beings.
[1:12:19] It's hard. But you know, sometimes what
[1:12:21] the problem is, it's just pride
[1:12:24] because we we don't want we don't want
[1:12:25] to feel we don't want to be corrected.
[1:12:27] We don't want to be rebuked. It's hard.
[1:12:31] And but the problem sometimes just pride
[1:12:34] that door we want to keep it private.
[1:12:36] Don't touch there. No ministers, don't
[1:12:38] touch there. Pastor, don't touch deacon.
[1:12:40] Don't touch my brother. Don't touch my
[1:12:42] own life. Mind your business. This is my
[1:12:46] my life. It's my my business. I you I
[1:12:51] being a bit natural here, but I just
[1:12:52] want to put emphasis on the temperance.
[1:12:57] Mind your business. This is my me. If
[1:13:00] prophet says maybe it's that private
[1:13:02] door of pride.
[1:13:07] Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[1:13:09] The prophet says, "The next door is
[1:13:11] pride." I tell you, Lord, don't don't
[1:13:13] you tell me what I'm I'm up to put on on
[1:13:16] what I'm I'm to take off. You stay out
[1:13:18] of that room. You mind your business.
[1:13:21] I'll mind mine. Now, I wouldn't say
[1:13:24] that, but your action proves you that
[1:13:26] you do that. You say that. Like my old
[1:13:29] southern mommy tells me the actions
[1:13:31] speak louder than words. Your actions
[1:13:33] are so strong you can't hear a
[1:13:35] testimony. When you take people that act
[1:13:37] indifferent, don't tell me preacher what
[1:13:40] I have to do. I don't care what the
[1:13:43] Bible says. I know what I think in my
[1:13:45] own head. That's right. You are not
[1:13:47] thinking on your in your heart any
[1:13:49] longer. Prophet says, I know. Then you
[1:13:51] say, I know what to do. I don't need
[1:13:53] your advice. I don't want you to read me
[1:13:56] anything or these things. I don't need
[1:13:57] your advice. Who are you?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; God help us, Lord.
[1:14:02] But the bride will have the character of
[1:14:04] Christ.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; She'll be willing to be corrected.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to learn more. I want to
[1:14:09] hear more. I come to the house of the
[1:14:11] Lord to be corrected. Lord, change my
[1:14:13] mind. Remove the pride. Remove the
[1:14:16] arrogance. Lord, I desire to be
[1:14:18] corrected. I desire to be to to be to be
[1:14:21] humble and I want to be humble. The
[1:14:23] prophet says in the statue of perfect
[1:14:25] man says a lot of us going to fall off
[1:14:27] before we even get started on
[1:14:29] temperance. He says, "Then we wonder why
[1:14:31] God is not in his church doing miracles
[1:14:34] and things that they used to do." You
[1:14:36] wonder why we don't have those things.
[1:14:38] Maybe it's because we lack temperance.
[1:14:41] We don't want to be corrected. But the
[1:14:43] church is the house of correction. The
[1:14:45] church is the correction. We love the
[1:14:47] people. The prophet says, "I love the
[1:14:49] people, but sometimes I have to hurt
[1:14:51] them. I have to hurt their feelings
[1:14:53] because I have to tell the truth." Amen.
[1:14:55] As you come to church, you you you you
[1:14:57] come to the church to be corrected.
[1:14:59] Amen. Sometimes every service different
[1:15:02] that service where we have to lift up
[1:15:04] and we we like to be encouraged. But
[1:15:06] there are some services you come, oh
[1:15:08] Lord. Oh, I wish I wish I just trimmed
[1:15:11] this service
[1:15:14] because it looks like he was just
[1:15:15] pointing at me. But we won the house of
[1:15:19] correction. And let me tell you
[1:15:21] sometimes all correction don't come from
[1:15:23] the pulpit but it's a house of
[1:15:26] correction. We have sometimes to say for
[1:15:29] we have sometimes to rub each other.
[1:15:31] Someone has to tell you know the sisters
[1:15:33] you know I think that that's not correct
[1:15:34] the way you dressed. someone from the
[1:15:36] church, not the pastor, not the deacon,
[1:15:38] someone from the I think that what it
[1:15:40] will be transparent. It's showing the
[1:15:42] underwrites. Not I don't think I don't
[1:15:43] think it's correct,
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; you know.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Don't be frustrated and say who she
[1:15:48] does. She think she is the mind her
[1:15:50] business. I come to church. Is there a
[1:15:53] church? That's not correct.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; It's a house of correction.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Because you can stay in your home and
[1:15:59] you're independent and everybody. You
[1:16:01] come to church to be corrected.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; And not not every correction come from
[1:16:08] the church. That is important because he
[1:16:10] says the B otherwise Jesus Christ would
[1:16:12] have not said if you see your brother
[1:16:14] transparency you have to go and talk to
[1:16:17] him.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Why the why Jesus didn't say only the
[1:16:20] pastor has to talk to him. Means someone
[1:16:22] from the church can talk to that person.
[1:16:24] Amen.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; I share that this with the brothers the
[1:16:33] meeting there. Prophet says disagreement
[1:16:36] is not a reason to separate.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; You don't want to get like Oswald. If I
[1:16:43] can't disagree with you and things and
[1:16:45] then shake his hand, still have the same
[1:16:48] feelings towards him, then there is
[1:16:49] something wrong with you. If I can't
[1:16:52] disagree with a man bitterly, the
[1:16:53] prophet says bitterly means his opinion
[1:16:56] is different from your opinion. So he
[1:16:58] comes and say, "No, this is I think what
[1:16:59] you're doing is wrong." No, no, what I'm
[1:17:01] doing is right.
[1:17:02] And someone has his opinion, his opinion
[1:17:05] and you disagree completely completely
[1:17:08] disagree and you know this what this
[1:17:10] this this way is this what the way is we
[1:17:13] can be in the same church and different
[1:17:15] opinions and it's fine
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; sometime we want to see want everybody
[1:17:21] to see that the way I see it the way I
[1:17:23] see that the way it has to be the way
[1:17:27] let's take an example the way song
[1:17:30] leading is being done that's the way has
[1:17:32] to be because I as I was grown up that
[1:17:34] that has to be someone says no it has
[1:17:38] not to be I will grow up this way
[1:17:40] different opinions
[1:17:42] but you still come the same church
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; and if he li this way it's this way he
[1:17:47] li this way this way oh no the preacher
[1:17:49] that like like that preacher a preacher
[1:17:51] has to be here oh I like a preacher
[1:17:54] who's just quiet he's just reading his
[1:17:56] note and everything it's okay to have
[1:17:59] different opinions it's okay
[1:18:02] That's a mature church. Amen. That the
[1:18:04] church God wants. It's not a mold up
[1:18:07] just everything think different. No, we
[1:18:09] can have different opinions agree
[1:18:11] bitterally but still have the same
[1:18:13] feeling. I still love you. Still stand
[1:18:15] for you. I still work for you. Amen.
[1:18:17] That's what we desire.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; So he's still my brother. I'm still I'm
[1:18:23] trying to help him. But I'll never help
[1:18:25] him. Oh no, I skipped something. Still
[1:18:27] think as much of him as Christ would.
[1:18:29] Then there is something with my spirit
[1:18:31] if I haven't the spirit of Christ. All
[1:18:33] right, brother. Let's come together to
[1:18:35] reason you and I. We'll take it to
[1:18:38] ourself. We'll go over it in this room
[1:18:39] to ourself. We'll reason it out. And he
[1:18:42] just cuts me to pieces and I have to say
[1:18:44] things back to him. If in my heart I
[1:18:46] can't feel the same about it that he's
[1:18:49] still my brother and I'm trying to help
[1:18:51] him, then I will never help him. There's
[1:18:54] no way for me to help him. If I don't
[1:18:56] love him, what's the use of going over
[1:18:59] there anyhow? Tell him the first place.
[1:19:02] The first place first, brother. I don't
[1:19:04] love you. Let me get that out of my
[1:19:07] heart right here before we go in there
[1:19:09] because I can't help you until I love
[1:19:12] you.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; I like what the prophet said. Because
[1:19:16] sometimes we want to correct but we
[1:19:17] don't love the person.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; You just want to show that you are
[1:19:20] right.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; You want to show that you know
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; that a bad motives.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. you you know Jesus says
[1:19:27] you know he say the father doesn't want
[1:19:29] that person to perish to be lost so you
[1:19:32] have a burden you love that person
[1:19:34] that's why you carry you pray about you
[1:19:37] I want to go with the right attitude and
[1:19:40] say it the proper way
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; I understand sometimes you don't feel
[1:19:46] comfortable talking to others
[1:19:48] it happen
[1:19:50] sometimes you'll feel like know I don't
[1:19:53] feel like I can talk to that person but
[1:19:55] I feel like that I think can be okay you
[1:19:59] know some
[1:20:01] um it's a mother you don't feel like you
[1:20:04] can correct correct the mother and I
[1:20:06] think can take maybe to talk to to to
[1:20:09] the other person and then a nice way the
[1:20:12] other person go and say you know we have
[1:20:14] heard like this is it correct and I
[1:20:16] think I understand that it can happen I
[1:20:18] think it can happen for instance um I
[1:20:22] think it can happen
[1:20:24] But we have the have the right attitude.
[1:20:28] 1 Timothy 5:12 says, "Rebuke not an
[1:20:32] elder, but in treat him as a father, the
[1:20:35] younger man as a brethren, the elder
[1:20:37] woman as mothers, the younger sisters
[1:20:39] with all purity. You can't just go
[1:20:42] because you know it's right. Just go go
[1:20:45] to an elder and then rebuke him the way
[1:20:47] you want." No,
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; you can't rebuke an elder the way you
[1:20:51] want. There is a certain approach that
[1:20:54] elders in the church we have to respect
[1:20:56] them. We pray for them on Wednesday. You
[1:20:58] can't just go and take brother Daniel
[1:21:00] and just rebuke him any no you there is
[1:21:04] a certain approach you respect and if
[1:21:07] you don't feel comfortable and thank God
[1:21:10] example for us but Daniel example for we
[1:21:12] love you appreciate you brother Daniel
[1:21:15] brother Dan brother brother Zeke sister
[1:21:18] Anita Matendo and all the mothers you
[1:21:21] don't just go and approach them whatever
[1:21:23] you want it's an approach together
[1:21:25] respect respectfully Amen. And even to
[1:21:29] the younger one maybe we have made a
[1:21:31] mistakes we have just cons because
[1:21:33] younger one you can talk whatever you
[1:21:34] want to them. No there is a certain
[1:21:36] approach also a lot of respect. Consider
[1:21:38] them as your brothers certain respect
[1:21:41] that you have to approach them. Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; The Bible is very strict on that. The
[1:21:52] way to approach in Galatians 6:1 says,
[1:21:54] "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a
[1:21:57] fault, he which are a spiritual restore
[1:22:00] such as one in the spirit of meekness,
[1:22:04] consider thyself, lest thy also be that
[1:22:07] lest thy also be tempted." So in other
[1:22:10] words, you don't go and crush him and
[1:22:12] shame him. The goal of correction is
[1:22:15] healing and restoration. It's not
[1:22:17] judgment. You go in a spirit of meekness
[1:22:20] and then gently humbly aware of your own
[1:22:24] weaknesses. Maybe you don't have the
[1:22:26] same weakness as the other one has a
[1:22:27] weakness. So you consider thou yourself
[1:22:29] that yourself being a weak also. So you
[1:22:32] go and correct him in a gentle way, in a
[1:22:34] nice way. Amen. Second Timothy 2:24
[1:22:37] says, "The servant of God must not
[1:22:39] strive but be gentle unto all men and
[1:22:42] have to teach patient in meekness in in
[1:22:45] meekness in striking those that oppose
[1:22:47] themselves. If God venture will give
[1:22:49] them repentance to the acknowledgment of
[1:22:52] the truth. Ephesians 4:2 says, "With all
[1:22:55] loneliness and meekness, with
[1:22:57] longsuffering, forbearing one another."
[1:23:00] So all this you rebuke with humility,
[1:23:03] with with simplicity, not a show off,
[1:23:05] but you you are very humble, simple, and
[1:23:08] put in a nice way. Maybe we have failed
[1:23:10] on that. Maybe we we we we put the
[1:23:13] people away because we have it too harsh
[1:23:15] and it is the word of God but we
[1:23:16] approaching in a very harsh way and
[1:23:18] people get hurt and oh but that's not
[1:23:21] the right approach and then we then we
[1:23:23] lose everything.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; So but I I was quoting the word of God
[1:23:26] to him and yeah it's the word of God but
[1:23:30] which approach did you take? Was it with
[1:23:32] loneliness with meekness with
[1:23:34] gentleness? Was it was it to help him?
[1:23:37] He's already down. Why you going to
[1:23:39] crush him again? Help him to stand up a
[1:23:42] little bit.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm still on the same paragraph, but
[1:23:49] that's good. Is it good?
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Prophet says
[1:23:57] question answers number. Brother Banam,
[1:23:59] some some gets on me or steps on my
[1:24:02] toes. This might be a good one. Prophet
[1:24:04] says steps on my toes as the old saying
[1:24:06] is my temper rises. How can I overcome
[1:24:09] this thing? I know the Lord will have to
[1:24:11] do it but what can I do in my heart? I
[1:24:15] don't want this thing. Prophet says
[1:24:17] sweeten your temper with prayer.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Then make up your mind
[1:24:25] struggling with temper. You know when
[1:24:27] someone goes
[1:24:32] when I feel that in me I can't control
[1:24:35] it.
[1:24:37] The Holy Spirit has to control your
[1:24:39] emotions.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has to control your
[1:24:42] whole being.
[1:24:44] It has to be the Holy Spirit. It's not
[1:24:46] even the way brother will say that later
[1:24:49] on. He's not you know you know when I
[1:24:52] was not a Christian that person the way
[1:24:53] he approached me I would have shown him
[1:24:55] what kind of person I am
[1:25:00] the prophet himself will say no it has
[1:25:02] to be sweetness Lord I don't want that
[1:25:06] in me anymore but I forgive you amen and
[1:25:11] make up your mind make up your mind
[1:25:13] means yourself you don't want it anymore
[1:25:16] because sometimes we worship ship our
[1:25:19] own spirit. You cherish it because you
[1:25:22] think it helps you in certain cases
[1:25:25] because when there is an argument when
[1:25:27] you shout and everything then you think
[1:25:29] you have solved the problem because you
[1:25:31] raise your voice and things and oh it it
[1:25:34] helped me escape that. So you are
[1:25:36] cherishing it. It's just on the corner
[1:25:37] there. When everything is fine you
[1:25:40] behave very good. When something's wrong
[1:25:41] then you go and pick it up and helps
[1:25:43] you. No you are worshiping that spirit.
[1:25:47] Amen.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Put it aside. Put it aside. You have to
[1:25:50] make up your mind. I don't want it
[1:25:51] anymore. I don't want it anymore. God
[1:25:54] help me in prayer. God help me. And God
[1:25:58] is going to help you.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; It's a long quote here. Let me read it.
[1:26:04] But just put it. I don't guess there is
[1:26:06] too many people in this building ever
[1:26:07] had any more temper than I did to begin
[1:26:10] with. I had a mouth mashed all the time.
[1:26:13] I've taken lot of my meals out of a
[1:26:15] straw. My mother as you know was a half
[1:26:18] Indian. My my my father was an Irish
[1:26:20] man. A Kentucky Irish Irish man.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Irish
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Irish man. A Kentucky Irish adat. So
[1:26:28] both of them had enough temper to fight
[1:26:30] a baso. It means
[1:26:33] according to his nature. Brother Banam
[1:26:36] was was was inclined to be someone who
[1:26:38] has a high temper and he did had high
[1:26:41] temper. Anything small things and he
[1:26:44] will fight. He was able he was he was
[1:26:46] thinking to kill people because he was
[1:26:48] just full full of anger and I'm going to
[1:26:50] kill them.
[1:26:52] But listen to the story how it goes on.
[1:26:54] The Holy Spirit came and change.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit came and change
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; your old nature. The Holy Spirit can
[1:27:02] change that old nature and make it a new
[1:27:05] nature. Amen.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; You can't just take excuses and worship
[1:27:09] that that that old nature. This is my
[1:27:11] nature. This is my parent. This is how I
[1:27:12] used to be. this hour was raised. The
[1:27:14] Holy Spirit has the power to change your
[1:27:16] nature if you heal yourself to the Holy
[1:27:19] Spirit.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Says, "I thought I can never be a
[1:27:25] Christian, but when the Holy Spirit came
[1:27:27] into my life, it's done. I had a woman
[1:27:30] one time I went to have a cut to cut the
[1:27:34] lights off." No, it was an electrician
[1:27:35] working that day. I had I had hair on
[1:27:37] top of my head. And she said, "You
[1:27:40] little kinkyheaded idiotic."
[1:27:46] I told her, I said, "The woman, you
[1:27:48] ought not to curse like that. Don't you
[1:27:51] fear God?" She said, "You little
[1:27:52] kinkyheaded idiotic. If I wanted
[1:27:55] somebody to talk to me about things like
[1:27:57] that, I wouldn't get a half wheat like
[1:27:59] you." So, whoa. Then she called me a
[1:28:03] blanket a blankety a blankety name. Oh
[1:28:06] my. If that being a he or father, I'll
[1:28:09] always say a man that to strike a woman
[1:28:11] wasn't enough. Wasn't man enough to
[1:28:14] strike a man. But I might have broken
[1:28:17] that that time calling my mother a bad
[1:28:20] name like that. But you know what? It
[1:28:23] never even phased me.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; I said I will pray for you.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God.
[1:28:31] That's the character of Christ. That the
[1:28:33] temperance of Christ it even never faced
[1:28:37] him just oh just a small thing. Why?
[1:28:40] Because he was filled with the Holy
[1:28:42] Ghost. He was drunk with the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:45] Amen. Amen. Says my mother a bad name
[1:28:48] like you know I said I will pray for
[1:28:50] you. Never bothered knowing that knowing
[1:28:53] right then something had happened to me.
[1:28:55] Yes sir. Oh my. That's the same thing.
[1:28:59] You know the maniac when he came to the
[1:29:00] prophet the prophet didn't hate him. He
[1:29:02] feel so very sorry for him. Why? Because
[1:29:04] he was full of love. If you have love
[1:29:07] inside of you, no one can hurt you and
[1:29:09] you can't hurt no one. If you let the
[1:29:12] Holy Spirit be in the control tower. The
[1:29:15] Holy Spirit has to be in the control
[1:29:16] tower. The problem we don't have the
[1:29:19] spirit controlling us. We want the Holy
[1:29:22] Spirit to control our emotions, our
[1:29:24] temper, our tongue, our everything. We
[1:29:26] have to yield it to the God so that he
[1:29:28] can control us. Amen. And he want to
[1:29:31] control us. Amen. The prophet says you
[1:29:33] want him as a savior but you what about
[1:29:35] being your lord that will control you.
[1:29:38] Control your emotions, control your
[1:29:40] thinking, control your every fiber of
[1:29:42] you that you could say like the man
[1:29:44] years ago who let who let him in. For me
[1:29:47] I lead to live is Christ and to die is
[1:29:49] again. Let him is let him in the way to
[1:29:53] be ruler and lord over you. Amen.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Listen, a person without temperance is
[1:29:59] vulnerable. A person with temperance is
[1:30:03] stable, disciplined, spiritually strong.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; God can't build on someone who is a
[1:30:10] can't have self-control. He can't put on
[1:30:13] top of that because you are not you are
[1:30:16] vulnerable. You are not constant. You
[1:30:19] are not reliable. Once again,
[1:30:22] statue of a perfect man. When they say,
[1:30:24] "If thou be the son of God, turn these
[1:30:25] stones into bread. If he could have done
[1:30:27] it and show it, he was God." But he had
[1:30:29] temperance. When they called him
[1:30:31] Bezobel, be said, "I'll forgive you for
[1:30:33] it." That's right. They pulled handful
[1:30:36] of beard out of his face and spit in his
[1:30:38] face, he said, "Come down." They said,
[1:30:41] "Come down of the cross." He said,
[1:30:43] "Father, forgive them. They don't even
[1:30:45] know what they are doing." Oh, praise be
[1:30:48] to God. where the prophet had failed,
[1:30:50] where the saint of old testament had
[1:30:52] failed, but Jesus Christ succeeded.
[1:30:54] Jesus Christ prevailed because he was
[1:30:57] God in the flesh. Amen. Is God in the
[1:30:59] flesh, but the same spirit that was in
[1:31:01] Jesus Christ, the same spirit is now in
[1:31:03] the body of Christ. We should have we
[1:31:06] should pray to have give God to give us
[1:31:09] the godly temperance, the Holy Spirit
[1:31:11] temperance. Amen. So when you got that
[1:31:14] right kind of temperance like he had, it
[1:31:16] vulcanize. If you haven't just made
[1:31:19] halfway sus sed up belief of temperance
[1:31:24] or I ought to slap him down but maybe I
[1:31:27] better not because they might put my
[1:31:29] name in the paper about it. That's what
[1:31:32] I saying. So there is something that is
[1:31:34] preventing you. I would have slapped you
[1:31:35] but I'm a message believer so I leave
[1:31:38] you.
[1:31:40] You know I would have I could have said
[1:31:42] something bad but you know I hold it
[1:31:45] off. Next time you try it again, you'll
[1:31:47] see
[1:31:50] it's still still not there yet. Amen.
[1:31:55] Something is preventing you. But you
[1:31:58] know, you know the the the Muslims and
[1:32:01] everything what they doing they're
[1:32:03] putting the law from the outside
[1:32:05] preventing things from the outside. You
[1:32:07] know, we use one more time we use a we
[1:32:10] experience from the church where I was
[1:32:12] was a teacher. There was a sister who
[1:32:14] came and she was just havoc and
[1:32:16] everything. She was behave misbehaving.
[1:32:18] We tried to calm her down. No sister
[1:32:20] don't do that and no she was just
[1:32:21] misbehaving and everything and she was
[1:32:24] saying things and saying to pastor and
[1:32:25] everything
[1:32:29] we tried and we tried to help and we see
[1:32:30] that the evil spirit we tried them and
[1:32:32] everything but she was just misbehaving.
[1:32:36] Then the pastor's wife says, "You know
[1:32:37] what? Since you have done what we have
[1:32:40] done now, let's call the police.
[1:32:43] Let's call the police."
[1:32:45] Brother, you can't believe it. The
[1:32:47] sister became nice.
[1:32:56] So you feel more the police than the
[1:32:59] advices they giving you to the church
[1:33:01] because you know the consequences,
[1:33:03] right, of the police. Sometimes we be we
[1:33:06] we are very nice at work. We are very
[1:33:08] nice with people from the outside but we
[1:33:10] are not nice with the people from the
[1:33:12] inside the church because there is no
[1:33:14] external rule. There's no punishment
[1:33:16] from the outside. You feel like you can
[1:33:18] do anything. You can be like you can be
[1:33:20] respectful because there's no external
[1:33:23] pressure from the outside but there's no
[1:33:26] love of God from the inside. And
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:33:38] says, "But maybe I better because they
[1:33:40] might put my name in the paper about
[1:33:41] it." That isn't the kind of temperance
[1:33:43] he's talking about. Don't try to add
[1:33:45] that. It won't work. But when you can
[1:33:48] really with the sweetness from your
[1:33:50] heart, forgive every man. Hold your
[1:33:52] peace. Let it be gone. See, then it will
[1:33:55] vulcanize. Valkcanize the word to say
[1:33:57] then it will be together. me like it
[1:34:00] would be together to be like a a rubber
[1:34:03] when you valkconize under the heat then
[1:34:05] becomes together you can't separate them
[1:34:07] again that the Holy Spirit when it's the
[1:34:09] Holy Spirit producing that then then
[1:34:10] it's a natural from the inside
[1:34:12] supernatural from the inside then you
[1:34:14] can add that to your faith amen the Holy
[1:34:17] Spirit temperance then is not me say
[1:34:19] that two kinds of temperances the two
[1:34:22] kinds of temperance one thing is a
[1:34:23] prohibition mean something from the law
[1:34:26] from the outside that that not the kind
[1:34:28] of temperance you know I'm that God is
[1:34:30] talking about that's ungodly
[1:34:32] uncontrollable temper you got the things
[1:34:34] at your side and sus and fast those
[1:34:37] things because of prohibition that
[1:34:39] prevent you from doing those things but
[1:34:40] when there is no constraint from the
[1:34:42] outside let it come from the inside
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; that you can't do it anymore amen
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; be nice to your husband be nice to your
[1:34:49] wife be nice to your children be nice to
[1:34:53] one another is your wife worthy of the
[1:34:55] gospel the prophet says when this takes
[1:34:57] place they think you'll will do. You'll
[1:34:59] find that the spirit has come in from
[1:35:01] the new birth. You will believe and do
[1:35:04] everything that God says in his word is
[1:35:06] for you to do. Everything that the Bible
[1:35:08] quotes for you to do, you'll punctuate
[1:35:10] it with an amen. You'll not stop day or
[1:35:13] night until you receive it. That's
[1:35:15] right. That's right. In all time, you'll
[1:35:17] certainly you'll certainly above
[1:35:19] everything bear the fruit of the spirit.
[1:35:22] You say, "Will I speak with tongues?"
[1:35:23] You might do that. You might not. Will I
[1:35:26] shout? You might do that. You might not.
[1:35:28] But there is one thing sure you will do.
[1:35:30] You will bear the fruit of the spirit.
[1:35:33] The fruit of the spirit is love, joy,
[1:35:35] peace, faith, longsuffering, meekness,
[1:35:38] gentleness, patience. Your temper will
[1:35:41] not be, oh, just remember when you got
[1:35:44] that that poison the Holy Spirit away
[1:35:46] from you. When you get to a place that
[1:35:48] you want to fast with everybody you come
[1:35:51] along to, there is something wrong. When
[1:35:53] we get to a place where a minister will
[1:35:55] read from the Bible that's wrong to do
[1:35:58] certain things and just remember there's
[1:36:00] no and then you and you'll and then
[1:36:02] finish that sentence then just remember
[1:36:04] there's no Christianity there at all
[1:36:06] that now by their fruit you shall know
[1:36:09] them that what Jesus said if it's the
[1:36:11] word God said so that spirit in you will
[1:36:14] cope with that word and every time
[1:36:17] because genuine holy spirit will cope
[1:36:19] with the word of God because the word is
[1:36:22] life and spirit. Jesus said, "My words
[1:36:25] are life." I'll be closing soon. If
[1:36:28] you've got eternal life and is the word,
[1:36:30] how can the word deny the word? What
[1:36:33] kind of a person would you make God?
[1:36:35] There's one thing to know if you're a
[1:36:37] Christian when you can fully agree upon
[1:36:40] every word of God. Amen.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; You find yourself in love with your
[1:36:45] enemies. Somebody say, "Well, is is
[1:36:48] nothing but the holy roller?" Means
[1:36:50] something bad. It's just something who's
[1:36:52] pretending. You start you start to get,
[1:36:54] oh, be careful. Be careful. When you
[1:36:57] really find yourself that you love him,
[1:36:59] regardless of what they do, you still
[1:37:01] love them. When you when you begin to
[1:37:04] find your patience get from about that
[1:37:07] long till you just don't have no hand.
[1:37:10] Anybody just keep saying things about
[1:37:12] you, well, I don't care what you say.
[1:37:14] Don't get stirred up. If you get stirred
[1:37:17] up, you better go pray first before you
[1:37:19] talk to them again.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; If you get stirred up, don't try to
[1:37:24] react on when you are on when you are
[1:37:26] stirred up. No, no, it's going to bring
[1:37:28] bad result. Is is is worse is is
[1:37:32] actually worse than than than when you
[1:37:34] are drunk because you you actually lost
[1:37:36] your mind. Amen. So, no, don't do that.
[1:37:38] Don't get fast. Don't like to get in
[1:37:41] fast. If you like to see somebody raised
[1:37:43] in church, you know what I'll tell you.
[1:37:46] So, so did and so so say brother, shame
[1:37:48] on you. If you say, "Oh, that's so
[1:37:51] listen to that scandal. Watch out. The
[1:37:53] Holy Spirit is not a sessful." No, no.
[1:37:56] The heart is occupied by the Holy Spirit
[1:37:59] is full of holiness, purity, think no
[1:38:02] evil, doeth no evil, believe all things
[1:38:06] endureth all
[1:38:09] all things longsuffering. Don't fast
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; when the family get in a fast. Don't
[1:38:16] fast with them. It's the prophet
[1:38:18] speaking.
[1:38:20] Your mother said, "I you didn't have God
[1:38:22] up here and that old church anymore."
[1:38:24] Well, you think about now you letting
[1:38:26] your hair grow out. You look like some
[1:38:28] old grandma. Don't fast with her. Say,
[1:38:31] "Okay, mother. It's all right. I love
[1:38:33] you just the same. I'll be praying for
[1:38:36] you as long as I live."
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Don't fast. Temper breeds temper.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; First thing you know, you grieve the
[1:38:43] Holy Spirit away from you. You'll be
[1:38:45] fasting back. Then the Holy Spirit take
[1:38:47] its flight. Temper breeds temper.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Love breeds love.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; That's what I want you to keep in your
[1:38:55] life. Love breeds love.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; If you love one day, it will produce
[1:39:00] love again.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Be full of love. Jesus said this will
[1:39:03] all men know if you're my disciple my
[1:39:05] disciples when you love one another that
[1:39:07] the fruit of the holy spirit did you
[1:39:09] know that you are a little creator
[1:39:10] yourself you know that certainly you
[1:39:12] seen people that you love to be around
[1:39:15] you know you know why the just loving
[1:39:17] type of person have you seen that just
[1:39:19] as kind you like be around they create
[1:39:22] that atmosphere by the the life that
[1:39:24] they live they the the way they talk
[1:39:26] their conversation you are seeing that
[1:39:28] those every time you shan them all time
[1:39:31] they want to talk about some something
[1:39:33] evil, talk about somebody. Oh my, there
[1:39:37] they come. They're going to criticize
[1:39:39] somebody there. Here's here now. He's
[1:39:41] going to talk about this man. All
[1:39:43] they're going to do is tell dirty jokes
[1:39:45] or something about women, something like
[1:39:47] that. You just hate to get around them.
[1:39:50] They create seemingly pretty nice
[1:39:52] people, but they create the atmosphere.
[1:39:57] The prophet talks about the the three
[1:39:59] monkeys.
[1:40:01] is a brother or sister ready to put
[1:40:03] that.
[1:40:08] So the three monkeys
[1:40:11] the first one to the left there doesn't
[1:40:14] want to see bad things. Says that how we
[1:40:17] should be sometimes we don't want to see
[1:40:19] bad things negative things and we don't
[1:40:22] want even to look at bad things because
[1:40:24] it create an atmosphere. Whatever you
[1:40:26] look, whatever you like to enjoy that
[1:40:28] the bad things, it create an atmosphere
[1:40:30] about you.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; The things that you watch, the thing
[1:40:32] that you in life, if there are evil
[1:40:34] things, it create a wrong atmosphere
[1:40:36] around them.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Close your eyes to the bad things.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; The second one is the hearing. Whatever
[1:40:44] you are hearing, you know the same
[1:40:46] principle. Faith comes by hearing and
[1:40:48] hearing of the word of God.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; You know that that unbelief and evil
[1:40:51] things comes also by hearing. What you
[1:40:53] are hearing is if the bad things it
[1:40:55] create an atmosphere about you. The
[1:40:58] third one is speaking talking what you
[1:41:00] talk what you speak if you speak evil
[1:41:02] things and bad things negative things it
[1:41:05] create an atmosphere around you
[1:41:09] and the prophet says and continue the
[1:41:11] message says the things that you think
[1:41:13] on the things that you do the action the
[1:41:16] things that you talk about create an
[1:41:18] atmosphere I went into a man's office
[1:41:20] here in the city and the man is a trusty
[1:41:22] or deacon in the fine church and I went
[1:41:25] in to see that man about some business
[1:41:26] there is a radio over there and with
[1:41:28] that rock and roll and twist and every
[1:41:31] and ever what it was just as hard it
[1:41:33] could be I guess there was 40 pinups in
[1:41:37] his office of of nude women and and now
[1:41:40] you can't tell me how much deacon how
[1:41:43] much more you let me see what you look
[1:41:45] at or what you read and the kind of
[1:41:47] music you listen to the crowds you
[1:41:50] associate with I'll tell you what kind
[1:41:52] of spirit is in you
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; the things that you watch the things
[1:41:56] that you hear listen to the things that
[1:41:59] you talk about it create an atmosphere
[1:42:01] around you it brings evil spirit around
[1:42:04] you see you hear a guy say me do so and
[1:42:08] so and so bunch just remember don't care
[1:42:10] what he says his words speaks louder his
[1:42:13] actions speak louder than anything you
[1:42:16] could say he could testify he's a
[1:42:18] Christian sure but maybe do anything but
[1:42:20] just what kind of life he lives tells
[1:42:22] what he is
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; but we should learn from that those
[1:42:26] Every monkey is here. I hope it stays
[1:42:29] with us.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; I don't want to see bad things. I don't
[1:42:32] want to hear any bad things. I don't
[1:42:34] want to speak bad things. I want to
[1:42:36] dedicate my whole being to him.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was the example of
[1:42:42] temperance. When he had the gift, he
[1:42:45] knowed all things. For him was the
[1:42:47] fullness of the godhead bodily, the
[1:42:49] statue of a perfect man. They had seen
[1:42:50] him perform miracles and telling people
[1:42:53] that was wrong with them and so forth
[1:42:54] like that. They put a rag around his
[1:42:56] head like that around his eyes and hit
[1:42:59] him on the head with a stick and said,
[1:43:00] "Prophesy. Tell us we hit you. We
[1:43:03] believe you." He had temperance.
[1:43:06] Now if you get like if you got it like
[1:43:09] that, add it to your faith. If you still
[1:43:11] blow up and sass and fast and stew and
[1:43:13] carry on, oh, you doesn't have it. You
[1:43:17] can't have that because it won't add up.
[1:43:19] It won't vanize. I mean, it will fall
[1:43:23] somewhere. Jesus Christ had all the
[1:43:25] power but didn't use all his power. He
[1:43:28] accepted for a moment to forfeit for
[1:43:30] forfeit his right. Sometimes we the
[1:43:33] problem we're struggling is because we
[1:43:34] want to be right. Come back to
[1:43:36] temperance for a moment. We want to be
[1:43:38] right. You don't want to feel feel
[1:43:40] wrong. You want to be right and then you
[1:43:41] fight yourself. You fight your own
[1:43:43] battles and then your anger take over
[1:43:45] and you are still a Christian sometimes
[1:43:47] but say no then then you you don't have
[1:43:49] the real temperance. You know what
[1:43:50] sometimes is you you accept to be wrong.
[1:43:54] You accept to be wrong. So just not
[1:43:57] accept I'm wrong. Forgive me.
[1:44:01] Maybe another time you bring it up in a
[1:44:03] nice way. Then when you react under
[1:44:05] emotions, you fail. Elisha the prophet
[1:44:08] was he has a he was a prophet. He saw
[1:44:11] those kids and insulting him. Oh bold
[1:44:13] bald-headed man. Why you didn't go with
[1:44:16] Elijah? And he rushed on under hunger
[1:44:18] and he cursed those kids and a bear came
[1:44:21] and destroyed them. The prophet said,
[1:44:23] "Was it the spirit of Christ?" No, it
[1:44:25] was not a spirit of Christ. But Jesus
[1:44:27] Christ when they were pulling his beard
[1:44:29] just, "Oh God, forgive them." They don't
[1:44:32] know what they do. That's what we desire
[1:44:34] to be as Christ.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; And Christ, the character of Christ is
[1:44:39] going to be in the bride because you are
[1:44:41] predestinated to be the bride of the end
[1:44:44] time. will have the character of Christ
[1:44:46] because we have received the ministry of
[1:44:48] Christ. We have received the fullness of
[1:44:50] the Holy Ghost now in the church. The
[1:44:53] Holy Ghost was in the Jesus. God is the
[1:44:55] Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost was in Jesus
[1:44:57] Christ. Now the Holy Ghost is in the
[1:44:59] church to produce the same character. Be
[1:45:02] like Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; How many can say God I desire to have
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; that Holy Spirit temperance. Help me
[1:45:10] Lord. Help me Lord to have that.
[1:45:12] Musicians can come. God bless you.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow I surrender.
[1:45:36] Just sing the chorus for that.
[1:45:43] I surrender.
[1:45:47] I to my Lord.
[1:45:53] More that I release my faith.
[1:45:58] The more you take control.
[1:46:04] The more that I can humble myself,
[1:46:09] the more you lift me up
[1:46:14] every day.
[1:46:18] Lord, I love you more. One more time,
[1:46:23] the chorus. Oh, the more that I
[1:46:28] surrender,
[1:46:31] the light of my Lord,
[1:46:37] the more that I release my king. Oh, the
[1:46:42] more you take control,
[1:46:47] the more that I can humble myself.
[1:46:52] The more Lift me up
[1:46:57] every day I am
[1:47:01] Lord. I love you more.
[1:47:06] The worst enemy is myself.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; I want to die. There is a lot of Moes in
[1:47:13] me. A lot of Moes that want to show up.
[1:47:15] That's where the problem is. But I want
[1:47:18] to die so that Christ can live. I want
[1:47:21] to die to my pride, to my arrogance, to
[1:47:24] my to my be right all the time so that
[1:47:26] Christ can live inside of me. The more I
[1:47:29] surrender, help me to surrender, Lord.
[1:47:31] The more I surrender once again. Oh. Oh.
[1:47:34] The more that I surrender,
[1:47:40] the light of my Lord,
[1:47:45] the more that I release my car. Oh, the
[1:47:51] more you take control,
[1:47:55] the more that I can humble myself.
[1:48:01] Oh, lift me up
[1:48:05] every day.
[1:48:09] Lord, I love you more.

[1:48:17] heart, oh God. Let's stand together.
