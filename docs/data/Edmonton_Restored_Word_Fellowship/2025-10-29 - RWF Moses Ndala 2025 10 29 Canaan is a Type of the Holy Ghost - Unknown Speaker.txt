Description:
In this sermon, Brother Moses explains how the biblical story of Canaan isn't about a perfect future paradise like the millennium, but instead stands for receiving the Holy Spirit in our lives today. He starts with Abraham's journey from his home to Canaan, a land promised to his descendants. Ndala points out that Canaan was full of battles and enemies, just like how getting the Holy Spirit doesn't make life easy—it's where the real struggles begin. Think of it as leaving the old world (like Egypt), getting cleaned up in the tough times (the wilderness), and then settling in a place where you have to fight for what's yours with God's help.

Brother Moses stresses that having the Holy Spirit means claiming your rights, like joy, healing, and peace, but you have to battle doubts and temptations to keep them. He uses the idea of two dogs fighting inside you—one good, one bad—and the one you feed wins. So, feeding your spirit with positive beliefs and God's promises helps you overcome. It's not a restful vacation; it's a war zone where you push back against negative thoughts or habits, saying, "This is mine, back off!" He warns that without faith, promises don't stick, and you need patience because not everything happens instantly.

He concludes by saying we're in a special time now to grab all these benefits, unlike past generations who only got parts of it. Abraham had just a small plot, but later men of faith like Joshua and David took the whole of what God has given.  For example, areas of all Israel and Jerusalem. Today, it's our season to claim the full extent of God's promises — healing now, not waiting for some far-off perfect world. Ndala encourages fighting for it through prayer and belief, knowing that one day we'll move to true peace without struggles. It's about growing character step by step, trusting the process, and rejoicing even if progress is slow.

You know, I was just thinking I was talking to brother Moses out there. I don't know sometimes I don't know how brother Henry, brother Moses and brother Zig how they do it or they did it but sometimes it's so difficult during the week you got all these things to go through and then you still have to come to church and not just come to church we all come to church [music] but you have responsibilities like brother Andrew has to eat songs brother Moses has to preach like what brother Zig used to do you know sometimes you just got to thank them for doing what they do we thank God for them, having them in our lives. Let's go to the Lord in prayer if you don't mind. Heavenly [music] Father, we're just so grateful that you you are a loving father, a loving God. &gt;&gt; We just don't know what we would be if you weren't if you didn't love us.

God bless you, saints. &gt;&gt; Um, I just I don't know why I keep on standing here. Ive never been one to love singing in public, but um God has been working inside of me and I I just can't hold it back than to praise him. Um I'm not a singer. I'm not a musician. I'm not It's far from me. I live to to the singers. But I just want to make a joyful to the Lord &gt;&gt; for always being there and always helping me. And since I'm not a singer, please don't be an audience. Please worship with me. &gt;&gt; Just worship with me. I I I sing pretty easy songs so you could be able to worship together with me. &gt;&gt; Sing the Lord. Can you see what the Lord has done? &gt;&gt; What we waited for has come to pass. &gt;&gt; Can you see what the Lord [music] has done? &gt;&gt; Just sing with me.

See what [singing] the Lord has done. &gt;&gt; When brother Zigg told us that he was looking for someone to take over, I had a a fear [music] that who is going to come and take over this church? Are we going to be safe? And I just it's it's overwhelming to see what God is doing right now. how brother Moses is just yielding to everywhere God is taking him. He's he's been all over and just putting everything together. And I I I am I am mesmerized. I don't know what to say. I [music] just want to thank God that everything that we've been praying for, that we've been waiting for, &gt;&gt; he's bringing it into shape. a little church [music] that didn't no longer had people and just God has been bringing people from all over and we [music] can't be more grateful that he had has had given us a pastor that had pastored this church for many years and he had he had he listened to the leadership of the Lord because he would have been like any other man just continue being the p the pastor of this church but he had to listen and We don't know what God where don't know where God is taking us, but we're just believing. &gt;&gt; What we've waited for has come [singing] to [music] pass. See what [singing] the Lord has done. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] Someone to care. Someone to share all [music] your troubles like no other can [music] do. You [singing] come down from the skies and wipe [music] the tears [singing] from your eyes. You're his child [music] and he cares for you. When you're disappointments [music] come and you feel so [music and singing] blue, there is someone [music] who cares for you when you [singing and music] need a friend. A friend till the [singing and music] end. There is someone who's a friend to [music] you. Someone [singing] [music] to care. Someone to share all your trouble like [music and singing] no other can do. You come down [singing] from the sky and [music] wipe the tears from your [singing] eyes. You're his child and he cares for you. He'll [music and singing] come down from the sky and [singing] wipe the [music] tears from your eyes. You're [music] his [singing] child and he cares for you. Amen. Amen. Makes me think I was talking with one one of my one of my friends. He was confiding in me and he was just having just like a stressful time. Like they they just had another baby and life is very expensive and I I've known him since like first grade. best friends and and he was telling me was just kind of just unloading on me and I'm I'm there for him and I'm his friend and and I told him like I got your back and that's like all I needed to say and like I was like no matter what happens it's like I'm if I can help you financially I'm going to help you financially if I'm going to you know if if something breaks because he's worried about like if something breaks I'm like I'm like we'll fix it or like we'll figure it out. And like it just makes me think is like when we we read the word it's it's all affirmation to us &gt;&gt; because we're we're God's children where his bride and everywhere you see in the Bible like any bride any child was taken care of by their father. Everything that happened in the Bible was to was to fulfill the purpose of God to provide for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's Yeah. And and I told him in the end, I was like, I've been where you've been. And it just that's what's awesome about the Lord is we get so caught up and so uh like shut in and and caught up with the things and then God is still the same God he always was. like I've been my till you just turned eight and I don't know how I made it this far but you know as an as an adult and and like I don't I don't feel like an adult but the Lord's led me this whole way and &gt;&gt; he's provided even no matter how like shaken I've been or or how like lost I've felt in this world. It's just God's still the same and I'm still waking up every day in my house and I'm still going to work and the the Lord just has provided everything and you just forget what how stressed you were and and all the things that the Lord's provided for you. So I just yeah &gt;&gt; I just thank him that he yeah &gt;&gt; there's and even what Sister Estard said is you know like you you worry and and I just I always kind of had a burden on my heart for this church because it's just we're a small group and I don't want a small group to get lost in a big group and I'm not saying I'm not saying it's bad to to go to other churches and be part of them and like I enjoy I go to brother Edson Sunday but it's just yeah I want the Lord to have his way here and there as well. So &gt;&gt; amen. Um let's as brother Moses come, let's sing uh Oh happy day. Oh happy [music] day that fix my choice on thee my savior and my god. [music] Well, may this glowing heart rejoice [singing] until it rapures all abroad. Oh happy day, oh [music] happy day.

I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ evening. Good to be in the house of the Lord for a night of prayer [music] and fellowship with the Lord.

We thank God for brother Boris coming and being a blessing for us and just praising the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then way of announcement we have a youth meeting on Friday uh with at 6:30 quiet time and seven songs start. Just keep that in prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just go to the Lord and pray this evening. Father, we thank you once again to be in the house of the Lord. How thankful we should be Lord to know you and &gt;&gt; just to serve you father Lord and to know that we are your children both with a price of your own life that was shed for the the own blood that was shed and the life of God that he came out Father Lord so that today we can be beneficiary of that blessing in our life father we thank you for that. What a wonderful day Lord we have to be living in &gt;&gt; when the word of God has been opened father the Bible has become a new book for us &gt;&gt; father that you have restored Lord Jesus Christ what has been lost and the garden of Eden for being restored father to us to recognize that we are now bought back to the fellowship with our father Lord we can come to you Lord without any intermediary may another person another man between us and you but we can come directly have access to the throne of grace to the mercy seat. Have access, Father Lord, to the inner chamber with you with the king and have fellowship with you, Father, Lord Jesus Christ. The blood has restored us back, Lord, to the status of a son and daughter of God once again, Lord, even to the point where nature can obey to us, Father. Lord, we thank you, Father, that the sword of the word of God has been restored to the to man once again. Lord, the book that was lost has been res restored back to a man. Father, now we have the book of redemption in our heart. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you. We praise you, Lord Jesus Christ. As we commit this remainder of the service in your hand, Lord, thank you for the songs. Thank you, Father, Lord Jesus Christ, for the gift. Thank you, Father, Lord, for the song leader and the musician. Thank the atmosphere that has been created. Thank you for each one that brought liquor fire for this service, Lord, and the visitors. We bless them and welcome them father as we commit all the service to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to have you and good to see you matey. I was wondering on Sunday mat is never miss service where is she? [laughter] And I asked the children mommy traveled to Calgary. of of I don't want to lose mama mati. I will follow you wherever you are. She she's the faithful sheep. Never miss a service. Never never for whatever reason never miss a service. I was a little bit worried and pastor Boris apparently knows her because um her older sister is one of the few who started the s the church there and um how can I forget the name she's one of the few started the service when there was still a small group so on dedication she had to give a testimony how the struggle this small group they're moving from one place one but she has always been faithful. So now it seems like that that runs in the family. Mat has always been faithful. So he asked me how Mat said, "No, she's never missed a service." The only time I saw Mr. Service was when she had the dedication uh graduation for her daughter and she warned me that I won't be there. That's the only time I ever seen it. And on Sunday she was not there. I was like, "Huh? What's going?" [laughter] and requires no she traveled so she's excused justified that she's never done it. We appreciate you ma God bless you and um and we have James and Ruth have been already welcome I guess. &gt;&gt; So good to have you here and the children Mia and and Bon Bon God bless you richly feel welcome. Genesis 12, Genesis 12 Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, into a land that I will show thee." I've been on the subject of the possessing the the land for for a few Wednesdays now. And I will make of thee a great nation. I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing. and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curse thee, and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Abraham departed, and the Lord has spoken unto him, and Lot went with him. And Abraham was 70 and five years old when he departed out of Aaron, Heron. And Abraham took Sarai, his wife, and Lot, his brother's son, and all the substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Heron, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan, and to the land of Canaan. They came and Abraham passed through the land into the place of Sish, unto the plain of Morab. And the Canaanite was then in the land. And the Lord appeared unto Abraham, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land, and there buildeth an altar unto the Lord who appearth unto him. May God bless his word, and have seizing, unto thy seed will I give this land is the land of the Canaanite. and to thy seed will I give this land. I will talk about um canon the type of the Holy Ghost. Canon the type of the Holy Ghost for a few minutes before going to prayer here just want to put few comments here. In the book of Hebrews it also say that it was given to them as a promise. Hebrews chapter 4 says, "Let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it. For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them." But the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. It's talking about Israel coming out of Egypt and going into the promised land. It was those seed that that sea that should possess the land. But there there the the gospel or the word that was spoken to them was not mixed with faith. That's why they could not enter into the rest. And and then and then in verse 8 just to save time, Paul says, "For if Jo Jesus, which is Joshua here, if Joshua had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day, there remainth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his, let us labor. Therefore, to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. So in order to go into that rest, you need to have faith. &gt;&gt; You need to believe the word of God. Seems like a little bit contradictory where I will be going, but it was just good to put is a principle. The word of God has to be mixed with faith. You have to believe the word of God. Otherwise, the word of God is profitth nothing to reason. Doesn't do anything unless you believe what is been told to you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the thought that I'll take here is a simple thought the prophet spoken about many times in many places just caught my attention recently again as I listening to the tape says how many read back in Deuteronomy chapter one there where the spies went right in there and tested of the things from Canaan which Canaan is not the type of the millennium. So Canaan is not the type of the millennium. How many knows that you mean just one hand Junius? So the only &gt;&gt; brother Junior replied and said that's right. Says Kenan is not a type of the millennium. So it's not a type of millennium. We know as a believer there will be a millennium. &gt;&gt; We believe in the real millennium that will happen to us. A millennium is a place where the our bodies will be changed. As we heard on on Sunday, our bodies will be changed. We won't be having this body of of flesh that is still suffering that is full of full of diseases. It is a past house but we have a new body where there will not be sickness. There will be no tiredness. There will be no not even evil thought. Everything will be just be perfect. &gt;&gt; That's why our future is brighter. We're looking forward to that time. Amen. Where we won't have to die anymore. No more dying. Amen. No more crying even. It will be all joy forever in the presence of almighty God. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we'll be on that millennium and won't have anything. But the prophet says here canon is not a type of that millennium. But because it give the reason because they had wars and fightings and killings and everything else in Canaan. &gt;&gt; It's type to the holy and then stop there. Canaan is a type of the Holy Ghost. So Canaan is a type of the Holy Ghost. Egypt is the world that they came out. They came out of the wilderness is where they were they were sanctified called out church. Canaan is where they settled down with the Holy Spirit because they still had wars. If you don't believe you have wars, just get the Holy Spirit once. Praise be to God. I like what pastor Boris said it on on the Sunday no on the weekend. So no it's it's not it's not it's not an easy road sometimes you know Jacob had had the blessings from the time he had the blessings then problem start &gt;&gt; the same thing as well the moment you have the Holy Ghost that's where real wars start. Amen. That's where it becomes like that that that that chief that that that chief Indian was asked what how is it now? How is it now? Now that you have the Holy Ghost, how is it? So, oh no, now it's even worse, man. Because now I have two dogs fighting inside of me. There is a black one and there is a white one. And the chief, can you tell me which one is winning? Oh, I I can I can give you which one is winning. The one I feed the most is the one winning. &gt;&gt; I'm born again, but the one I feed the most is one that's winning. If I'm feeding on the negative things and things like that, oh, then I'm down, down, down, down, down. But if I feed my soul, if I feed the Holy Ghost with the word of God, then he's winning, then he's overcoming. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is to save is to to save you and also to make you a servant of God. So that you serve others with the Holy Ghost that you have inside of you. The Holy Ghost is do those things. But there's something else. In order to have an overcoming life, you need to feed that Holy Ghost with the word of God. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is there to help you to fight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost is not there as we sometimes we have the impressions, oh the Holy Ghost is a millennium. It's not a millennium in this flesh. The Holy Ghost, the cannon is not a millennium. The Holy Ghost is a place where there are still some fighting, something you have to overcome, something you have to struggle with. Oh, but I have the Holy Ghost. Yes, you have the Holy Ghost, but you still fight. You still press on. You still move on. AMEN. IT'S STILL A BATTLE. IS STILL something you have to continue working and God is giving you rest in the soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; But in the outside you STILL NEED TO PRESS ON. AMEN. &gt;&gt; PUT this body under subjection of the word of God. The body SAYS NO DON'T DO IT. YOU SAY NO I HAVE TO DO IT. AMEN. SO I FEEL LIKE PRAISING THE LORD AND THE HOLY SPIRIT SAID YOU have to praise the Lord. I DON'T FEEL LIKE RAISING MY HAND. YOU RAISE YOUR HAND. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING TO CHURCH. YOU HAVE TO GO TO CHURCH. DRAG THIS BODY TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE IN [screaming] THE WAR. AMEN. KEEP GOING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I don't feel like singing. Sing. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE IN THE WAR. [screaming] IF YOU HAVE THE HOLY GHOST, if you don't have the Holy Ghost, the body says, "I feel like doing it. I don't feel like doing it." Or then you just obey because there is nothing to press on. You just obey what the body says. If you, "Oh, I feel like doing this." And you just do what? because you are subject to something. There's no fight. There's no fight. Your conscience is just being so dimmed down that you just follow whatever the thought comes, whatever the body comes. But when you have the Holy Ghost, THERE IS A FIGHT. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A STRUGGLE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Says if you don't believe you have wars, just get the Holy Spirit once. So what are you doing? What do you do in Canaan? They were possessing the rights. They were possessing the rights. Another place they had the rights to have that land. It was given to them. But now outside of the land, you can't possess anything. You just in theory. So when I will be there, when I will be there. But once you are in the land, then you start possessing. I have to possess the joy of salvation. I have to possess it. Amen. Before that, if you possess it, it will just be an emotion here and then, here and there, here and there. But when you have the Holy Ghost, it becomes your right. YOU CAN CLAIM IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; But many times you will say, you know, you know, oh, healing can be given to everybody. You can be healed whether you're a son of God or not the son of God, you can be healed. But to maintain that healing, you have to believe. &gt;&gt; You maintain that healing, you have to believe. Amen. the [clears throat] same thing. Oh no, you know you you can feel so emotional, you're happy and everything and then it stays there. But in order to maintain there, you have to continue believe believing. You have to continue saying, "God, I take you at your word. I'm not following what my thought is saying. I'm not following what my body is saying. I'm I'm OBEYING WHAT YOUR WORD SAYS." AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU POSSESS your right. You claim your right. &gt;&gt; Say, "Glory." They were possessing the right. They could not possess the right till they got into Canaan. They didn't own nothing. They didn't own nothing in the wilderness. Then when they come into Canaan, then they had rights. We've got right. &gt;&gt; When you receive the Holy Ghost, you are in Canaan. You you you have to fight for it. Every inch of ground, you have to fight for it. &gt;&gt; The promise is given to you, but you have to fight for it. You have to fight for it. Yes sir. That's the reason people say you pray for me today. All right. We'll see. It says then it says get over in Canon once brother. And you realize where you belong. Watch prayer start being turned around. Yes sir. You say look here Satan. This is mine. I'm a possessor of this. GOD SAID SO. MOVE OUT. So that's right. That's right. Move off my ground. See your ground. Satan says, Satan says your ground and he says I have an abstract DEED TO EAT. MOVE OUT. &gt;&gt; ABSTRACT means you have a proof. Move out because now this land doesn't belong to you anymore. It used to pertain to Canonites, but now it's not yours anymore because I have the abstract deal. &gt;&gt; I belong to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Move out. You don't. I'll serve notice on you by the Holy Spirit guidance. He moves out. Sure. He has to. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. As I'm going on this side, Abraham was in Canaan, but it was not as he Abraham was in Canaan. I've expressing this thought for a couple of services now, but I feel like I can go back into it. Abraham when he was in Canaan, he did not possess everything. He did not possess all things at once. He didn't he didn't possess the whole canon at once. He he he had it potentially. It belong. He was the owner of it, but didn't he didn't possess everything all at once. He just bought one small land and it was a bearing place. Just a bearing place. Think about it. He's the owner of everything, but he just buy a a sweet humble bearing place. &gt;&gt; Just a symbol that this is a token for the land that God has given me. And not only to me, but to my seed as well. That's the place where they will be buried. Amen. PRAISE BE TO GOD. THANK God for having Abraham. &gt;&gt; Thank God for someone saying, you know, this is my land and I'm already putting there, you know, it's it's like Americans or other nations when they go to the moon. They used to do that in Africa and other places when the the first person who arrived there just have to put a flag. Once you put a flag, it belongs to you. It's a small sign, but it shows there already that no one can take that because it belongs to you. Thank God for Abraham putting a flag. They say I PUT THIS BY FAITH. BY FAITH, &gt;&gt; I've been find righteous by righteous by God. THEREFORE, WHOEVER WILL BELIEVE IN GOD WILL BE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR ABRAHAM putting that flag there. &gt;&gt; Today, we can COME BASED ON THAT. BECAUSE I BELIEVE, THY FAITH has saved thee. As the brother say, thy faith HAS SAVED THEE. BECAUSE I BELIEVE in the word of God, you are justified. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Abraham only had a small person. Isaac didn't have didn't have any like it was like a pilgrim in the land walking here and there walking here and there and then all he had to do is just to dig dwell wells to dig wells. So this is my place. This is the place of Abraham. But Isaac does do you know that it belongs to you? Yes, I know it belongs to me but I don't possess it yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Jacob came, he found that land that Abraham bought. But and you know there was some dispute here and there. It belongs to you. It doesn't belong to even I had to pay it once again. He pay again for me. No, I have to pay it and buy it because I believe that this belongs to us. Praise be to God. I believe that this belong to us. My thought here is to say that God has a season for every situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham had a promise but it was not the season for him to possess the whole land. &gt;&gt; It was not the season for him to possess the whole God knew that you will come at some point. &gt;&gt; God knew that he will send he will send Moses at some point and he will send Joshua at some point to divide the land for that season. &gt;&gt; God has as the prophet we call it five must. You can have a promise but that promise has to have a certain season for it to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Like Luther could never preach the message that we have because it was not a season for him to have the message that we have. &gt;&gt; Even though he have read the Bible, have written the Bible, he went through this, he have translated in German and all that, but he couldn't have the revelation of the word of God that we have received because it was not the season. It was not THE SEASON YET. IT HAD to come at the end time that God will send a prophet to open the word OF GOD FOR US. &gt;&gt; NOW WE CAN GO INTO THE LAND of the Holy Ghost and POSSESS ALL THE LAND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY THOUGHT. &gt;&gt; WE ARE IN THE season of possessing all the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are in the season of claiming all our rights in the land. It's not a season where we can start thinking you know what maybe maybe I can postpone it on the other time and you know the devil is a so is so smart is is a subtle enemy you know when it's not your season he will try to make you think it's that season amen and make you frustrated know why you don't get this and this and no it's just not your season just be patient it will come maybe One of my subject I like that subject actually very a lot because it's something I struggle with myself a lot. Patience. &gt;&gt; Patience is something that is lacking in this last generation that we are living. We want everything to be instantaneous. You know, just instantaneous. Oh, then oh yeah, then then I believe. Oh, sometimes you know no, the one you know if you have faith to have a miracle then you have faith. &gt;&gt; Says actually sometimes the opposite is the one who doesn't get it instantaneously and he still trust in God. He has sometimes more faith than the one we get instantaneously &gt;&gt; because patience is a hard thing to have. We want everything instantaneously. That's one side. The other side is you know it's your season to claim it but you will put it for another for you. No, it's not for you. It's for another time. for another time. In the millennium, you know, in the millennium, then you can sing as the way you want to sing. In the millennium, then you can rejoice when you see that you are really saved. No, you can start today rejoicing &gt;&gt; because THAT'S YOUR SEASON for rejoicing today. Amen. You can't put says people believe that only they will have divine healing only in the millennium. SO THERE IS NO NEED FOR DIVINE HEALING IN THE MILLENNIUM. DIVINE HEALING IS NOW. THAT'S YOUR SEASON. [screaming] NOW YOU HAVE THE EARNEST OF THE RESURRECTION. NOW IT'S YOUR SEASON. AMEN. PRAISE BE TO GOD. CLAIM IT. IT PART OF YOUR POSSESSION. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; WHO WILL BE SICK? &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHY you want to put in the millennium? Exactly. Who will be sick in the MIDDLE OF WE HAVE PERFECT BODIES. WHY WOULD WE require divine healing on the other side? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are in the season for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says in the exposition of the church age, he says those in the bride do only his will. No one can make them do otherwise. They have that save the law or or they keep still. They know that it has to be God's in them doing the works, fulfilling his own word. He did not complete all his work while in this earthly ministry. So now he works in you and through the bride. She knows that he works in and through the bride. She knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do. &gt;&gt; But he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time. &gt;&gt; EVEN THE LORD JESUS Christ didn't couldn't do anything that some part he has to put for the bride. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I will give you one example in Isaiah 51. As he's reading the scroll, it stops at the place to set the captive free but leave the day of vengeance another time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because it was our time. &gt;&gt; Vengeance doesn't mean all necessary judgment. Vengeance means God is giving put everything at the right place. So this is my son. This belongs to them. This is not my son. No, this is a [laughter] how to say it but no these are not part of of the covenant. Let's put that way. These are not part of the covenant. These are part of the covenant. Amen. So God is putting everything at this right place. He's telling the enemy, you know, these are my children. Never touch them. Never touch them. These, you know, don't even get close to them. That's God putting everything at the right place. Amen. The good thing about God's promise is the word of God can never return without being accomplished, without fulfilling the purpose for which it was sent for. &gt;&gt; No matter what, the unbelief only stops the unbeliever. God's word has to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Once God's words comes out, it can never it can never just disappear and never get fulfilled. Once it is pronounced, it has TO COME TO PASS. IS JUST LOOKING FOR THE TIME. He's looking for the person who can grab that word of God. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND NOW actually as I was thinking about it, you know, it's God's grace to know the season for a certain word to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; The evidence of the Holy Ghost is based upon recognizing the word of your time, &gt;&gt; recognizing the word of your season, recognizing the word of your day. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't recognize the word for your day, you are missing the point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Everybody believe the the message of Moses in the time of Jesus. &gt;&gt; We believe Moses. We believe Moses. We believe Moses. But it was another season. &gt;&gt; COMPLETELY ANOTHER SEASON. NOW WE ARE IN THE SEASON OF THE MESSIAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT BELIEVE MOSES, but if you don't believe what Moses spoke about the day of the Messiah, you are missing the point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody believes No, no, everybody believes in Jesus of Nazareth over 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; That's good. And we believe that, TOO. PRAISE BE TO GOD. HE WAS BORN AND HE WAS BORN IN A mansion and and he grew up and then he died on on the cross. That's wonderful. BUT THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST NOW HAS [screaming] TO COME IN OUR HEART TODAY. &gt;&gt; THE SAME THING THAT HE DID THERE HE HAS TO DO in the in your body IN YOUR HEART TODAY. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE of the the message the word of God has to become a REALITY TO YOU TODAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; ONCE YOU GET THE PROMISE FOR YOUR SEASON, that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's God's grace when you can see THE PROMISE FOR YOUR SEASON &gt;&gt; and once you get the promise of your season you can claim it according to your season. NOW ABRAHAM COULD NOT BE there and claiming you know God why I don't possess all the land says no your portion I've given to you you just believe what I've given to you that portion here but there will come a time &gt;&gt; where your seed will possess the whole land &gt;&gt; you know that Abraham didn't have Jerusalem &gt;&gt; he met the king of Salem [clears throat] but didn't have Jerusalem [laughter] &gt;&gt; think about it. &gt;&gt; There was a time where Israel my 30 minutes are almost over already. There was a time where Joshua came and he possessed the land, &gt;&gt; the whole the land they possess the land. But God told him, you know, Joshua, I want to remove all the enemy at once. All of that's all of them in one instant. No, it will be one by one, little by little, little by little until you possess the whole land. Because if I remove them all at once, the beast will take over. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And will overtake you. &gt;&gt; You know what the beast are? Beast is the character of is a man without character. But I'm the same says you see a man is full of muscles and everything is just a beast. That's just a beast part. Any man can have good muscle. You go leave the gym, it will pop up, right? That's nothing, right? But the character, &gt;&gt; going on your knees, that's what shows the character. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost is not the end of the result. The Holy Ghost is only the beginning. It's only the beginning. Once you have the Holy Ghost, then God start building upon the character. Removing all the beast part, all the beast part, all the beast part, little by little, little valley, little valley, little valley. Sometimes you can might be you might have the Holy Ghost, you're still struggling with temper. That's why we temperance. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You have the new birth, but you are growing. &gt;&gt; You're still struggling with temper. And then, oh God, help me. Help me. Help me. Then God removes that little by little. Oh, remove that little by little, little by little. But the good thing is you have to recognize that it's your promise. &gt;&gt; You have to RECOGNIZE IT'S YOUR SEASON. DON'T PUT THAT FOR ANOTHER SEASON. IT IS YOUR RIGHT. YOU CAN CLAIM IT. AMEN. THAT'S WHY WE COME TO THE PRAYER MEETING. LORD, I I I have these things. I'm struggling with this this or I see this thing. God, I'm not putting that for ANOTHER SEASON. IT'S MY SEASON. IT'S MY TIME. MY LORD, I'M CLAIMING IT. [screaming] I'M FIGHTING FOR IT. &gt;&gt; IT'S MY LAND. IT'S MY PORTION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, NO. Get away from from from Jerusalem. Now, Jerusalem was inhabited my name. Jerusalem was inhabited by Jebusite. The Jebusites were living properly there and even Joshua didn't didn't conquer Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; He killed the king of Jerusalem but didn't possess Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; It was not the season yet. &gt;&gt; But there come one day &gt;&gt; David with the anointing OF GOD WITH THE ROYAL ANOINTING UPON DAVID. HE SAID NO. WHY SHOULD WE WAIT THAT WE SHOULD TAKE that that city? That city NEED TO BE RECONQUERED ONCE AGAIN. JERUSALEM HAS TO BE RECONQUERED. AND HE CONQUERED JERUSALEM AND MADE IT THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL FROM DIE. AND IT WAS THE SEASON TO CONQUER THAT. WHY? BECAUSE HE HAD THE ANOINTING. NOTHING COULD STOP DAVID FROM HAVING JERUSALEM BECAUSE HE HAD THE ANOINTING. GOLIATH COULDN'T STOP HIM. THE BEAR COULD NOT STOP HIM. AMEN. YOU KNOW, THE LION COULD NOT STOP HIM. LET ME TELL YOU THE SAME THING FOR THE BRIDE IN THIS LIFE. BECAUSE IT IS HER SEASON, SHE WILL HAVE THE BODY CHANGE. NOTHING CAN STOP HER BECAUSE IT IS HER SEASON. IT'S THE SEASON OF THE RAPTURE. IT'S THE SEASON OF THE RESURRECTION. IT'S THE SEASON OF THE BODY CHANGE. IT'S THE SEASON ALSO TO CLAIM ALL OUR INHERITANCE. AMEN. WHATEVER YOU HAVE NEED OF, IT'S RE IT'S RIGHT IN THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; IT'S OUR LAND. &gt;&gt; Praise God. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THE ENEMY TELL YOU no no no no you can have only this portion this portion you can leave it. Oh yeah maybe it was in the time of Luther. Luther was still developed it last time long time ago. Luther was a was was a Christian but Luther could get drunk. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine Luther reformation but he could get drunk &gt;&gt; a portion a big portion he left &gt;&gt; untouched. [laughter] BUT IN OUR DAYS, OH, WE CAN walk in that land. OH, IT'S MY POSSESSION. IT'S MY INHERITANCE. IT'S MY SEASON TO GET INTO. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WESLEY HAD THE SANCTIFICATION, GODLINESS, SANCTIFICATION, but he didn't have the BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. Just seems to struggle. You know, if I was not a Christian, I would have done it. But But when the Holy Ghost comes, it's our land. &gt;&gt; Oh, I can go into that. I have no desire for it. &gt;&gt; It's there, BUT I HAVE NO DESIRE FOR IT. &gt;&gt; At the beginning, I'm saying, Lord, I don't want it. I'm I don't want it. I'm not I don't want it. You are forcing yourself. You're for You have to do that. But certain point, by God's grace, he comes. He gives you that rest in the soul. Oh, no desire for it anymore. They can put it on your noses. It actually makes me like I want to vomit. What is that? You wonder yourself how come I used to enjoy those things? What what what was happening in my because God HAS REMOVED THE DESIRE. PRAISE BE TO GOD. NOW IT BECOMES OUR PORTION OF THE LAND. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW THERE IS ANOTHER PORTION THAT COMING. The holy the canon is not the millennium is not the type of the mill. There's some fight but there is a time where the real millennium will come and we are just at the we are just close to it now because we at the end of the end time RIGHT CLOSE TO IT. ANYTIME SOON THERE WILL BE A WEDDING supper &gt;&gt; for three years and a half. After the wedding supper we come back here again in this land and this land is going TO BE OUR POSSESSION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; VERY SOON AND VERY SOON WE SHALL be there. You will see me in B with brother Bam IN THE MILLENNIUM ENJOYING AMEN MY TIME. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Like the sister say she's not a singer but you will also see me singing there. Amazing grace. How sweet IS THE SOUND? &gt;&gt; BY GOD'S GRACE I MADE IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Why we have become possessor of the land. Praise be to God. Let me read a quote. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message of faith prophet says there was a land looking like God will just go down there and send a plague and kill all the people out and said now the houses are laying there just go in and bury the dead or send a storm through and scare them all out or something. But instead of that he said now I've just given you the land. Now you've got something to do. Now the promise is yours. The land is yours. I've already given it to you. Now you go over and possess it. Now I'm not going to give it to you all in one year. If I give it to you all in one year, then the wild beast said will come in and multiply against you. But just as you push out and we are able to take the land, I'll give it to you. And just as you are able to take the land. What a beautiful thing tonight for divine healing. The promise is given to you. By stripes you are healed. It's yours by promise. Now we have to go in and take it. Maybe you can't take it all at one time. Maybe you can't you can just accept it tonight. Like I said this morning, if you wanted the oak tree in your front yard, somebody gives you an a knock on. You've already got oak tree. You've got it in seed form. The only thing you have to do is plant that seed. It will produce the tree. So as soon as you get the seed, you've got the tree in seed form. Just as soon faith comes by hearing, hearing of the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's what so if it if the Bible says you know if you have a if you if you have a if you have a faith like that master seed just a little master seed you can move a mountain &gt;&gt; but the mountain might not move all of a sudden at once maybe just a little grain of of sand moves from that MOUNTAIN START ALREADY REJOICING.
