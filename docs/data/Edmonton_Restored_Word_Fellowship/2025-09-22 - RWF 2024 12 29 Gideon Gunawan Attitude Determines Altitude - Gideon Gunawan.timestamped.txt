[31:26] Lord. Yes, I walk the narrow way. For
[31:29] the comforter abides
[31:32] with me.
[31:35] Why don't we raise our hand and thank
[31:36] the Lord? Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, this
[31:39] morning we're here to praise your name.
[31:42] We're here to hear your voice, Lord
[31:44] Jesus. Your voice makes the difference.
[31:47] And we thank you for that, Lord, for
[31:49] that voice that has sounded out. It
[31:51] wasn't only Brother Brandham's voice. It
[31:53] was your voice. It wasn't the preacher's
[31:56] voice. It was your voice that we hear,
[31:58] Lord. A voice through a voice. And we
[32:00] thank you for that this morning. Praise
[32:02] your wonderful name. Thank you that we
[32:04] can be here. Thank you for the saints of
[32:06] God that have gathered together in unity
[32:09] and in faith trusting in your mercies.
[32:12] We love you. Can we I love you Jesus. Oh
[32:16] Lord, we love you with all our hearts.
[32:19] Oh God, may the spirit of the Lord Jesus
[32:22] Christ just be amongst us. And may there
[32:24] be no hindrance in the name of Jesus
[32:26] Christ. We cast out every spirit that
[32:29] would be opposing the word. In the name
[32:32] of Jesus we pray. Amen. Let's sing that
[32:35] chorus one more time and then our
[32:36] brother will come. Brother Amen. Come,
[32:39] brother Gideon. Amen. Oh, he abides.
[32:43] Oh yes, he abides.
[32:46] Oh, hallelujah.
[32:48] He abides with me.
[32:53] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[32:57] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[33:03] with me.
[33:05] Oh, he abides.
[33:08] He abides.
[33:11] Oh, hallelujah.
[33:13] He abides with me.
[33:18] I am rejoicing night and day as I walk
[33:22] in the narrow way. Oh, the comforter
[33:26] abides
[33:28] with me.
[33:30] I was just looking looking around and
[33:33] some of us are singing half-heartedly.
[33:36] And do you realize he abides with us? He
[33:39] abides with us every day. Hallelujah.
[33:42] Let's sing it one more time. And let's
[33:44] sing it all together with to the Lord
[33:46] Jesus with all of our Oh, he abides.
[33:51] He abides.
[33:55] Hallelujah. He abides. Bless you. Bless
[33:59] you.
[34:00] Well, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[34:05] walk the way for the comforter abides.
[34:11] Let's sing. He abides in me. Oh, he
[34:14] abides.
[34:16] Oh, he abides.
[34:19] Oh, hallelujah. He abides in me.
[34:25] Oh, I'm rejoiceing night and day as I
[34:29] walk the narrow way for the comforter.
[34:34] Does he really abide? Let's sing it
[34:36] again. Where He abides.
[34:40] Oh, He abides.
[34:44] Hallelujah. He abides in me.
[34:50] Oh, I'm rejoicing
[34:53] as I walk the narrow way for the comfort
[34:57] to abide in me.
[35:02] Let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[35:04] praise.
[35:05] [Applause]
[35:09] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. Let's
[35:11] stand together
[35:12] and greet you all in the name of the
[35:13] Lord Jesus Christ this morning. Am I on?
[35:16] We're good. Can you hear me? Is anybody
[35:19] out there? Okay, that's good. That's
[35:21] good. Amen. Just greet you all in the
[35:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And man,
[35:25] it's wonderful to be with you again. And
[35:27] and uh it it sounds like our brother
[35:29] Dan's been a while. And so I feel
[35:31] honored that you're here. Amen. And to
[35:34] that I get to minister this morning and
[35:36] be in the service with you. Amen. But
[35:38] we're happy to be together. Amen. And I
[35:41] trust that um you all had a nice
[35:42] Christmas.
[35:44] I hope you realize that you are
[35:46] Christmas. Amen. You are Christmas.
[35:49] Because friends, if there were to be a
[35:50] nativity scene out in front of your
[35:52] church there, I trust you would be in
[35:54] there. Because the word has been born in
[35:56] your manger and you have actually become
[35:58] the Christ to this age. Amen. I I trust
[36:01] that friends, Christ was born again,
[36:04] friends, in the believer. Amen. The
[36:06] world wants to keep him in a manger. But
[36:08] you know why? Because friends, he
[36:09] doesn't say nothing. He doesn't speak
[36:11] against their sin. Oh, he's just a cute
[36:13] little baby. But friends, he grew up,
[36:15] amen, to be a savior and he had
[36:18] something to say. And friends, I'm
[36:20] thankful friends that we heard a message
[36:21] in this hour and that he is not, he's
[36:24] coming, but he has actually come. Amen.
[36:27] In a word, Amen. in and the word coming
[36:29] of of Christ. Amen. In Revelations 10.
[36:32] And we believe it. And we believe that
[36:33] he's here. And it's already been said
[36:35] that Amen. I believe by brother Andrew
[36:37] that, you know, all that was in God, he
[36:39] poured into Christ. But it didn't stop
[36:42] there. Aren't you thankful for that,
[36:44] friends? All that was in Christ, he's
[36:46] poured into his bride. And here you are.
[36:49] What a wonderful thing, friends. Amen.
[36:52] To look and to see the reality of God's
[36:54] word being made manifest in our day. And
[36:58] not just out there or outside there. But
[37:00] friends, I'm looking at the
[37:01] manifestation of the word in front of
[37:04] me. My goodness, friends, we ought to be
[37:06] the happiest people on the face of this
[37:09] earth, friends. Amen. When we look at
[37:11] Christmas friends, I I can say merry
[37:13] Christmas because I really know amen.
[37:15] The meaning of Christmas friends, the
[37:17] real spirit of Christmas is the Holy
[37:19] Ghost, the spirit of God in a believer.
[37:23] My we can we can have joy. Amen. Joy
[37:25] bells in our heart. Amen. Praise the
[37:28] name of the Lord. Amen. I I just we just
[37:30] love him and we just let's just approach
[37:33] him and ask God's blessing as we just
[37:36] approach the word. Father, we worship
[37:38] you this morning, Lord. I know we've
[37:41] passed Christmas, Lord, but a prophet of
[37:43] God would say, Lord, we don't celebrate
[37:44] Christmas. It's a day of worship where
[37:48] we come and we consecrate ourselves to
[37:49] you and bow before you in worship, Lord
[37:52] Jesus. And Father, we love you, Father.
[37:55] We thank you for this opportunity that
[37:56] we have, Lord, this morning. We don't
[37:58] want to pass it by, Lord. We don't want
[38:00] to, Lord, miss, Lord, this opportunity
[38:03] that lays before us. Father, I know
[38:06] you're going to do something this
[38:07] morning, Lord. Father, I believe, Lord,
[38:09] that you're going to do something real
[38:11] special, Father, this morning, God. I
[38:13] come with an expectation in my heart,
[38:15] Lord. Father, and sometimes we come,
[38:17] Lord, I know we come, Lord, with things
[38:19] on our mind. We come with different
[38:21] feelings and different expectations,
[38:23] Lord. But Lord, may we be able to you,
[38:25] Lord, just now, Lord, focus our minds,
[38:28] Lord, and on you, Lord, and just yield
[38:30] ourselves, Father. Not just the speaker,
[38:32] Lord, but Father, the body of believers
[38:34] that are here, Lord. Lord, there's
[38:36] enough power here, Lord, to turn to
[38:39] create worlds. There's enough power,
[38:41] Lord, in this room that nobody would
[38:43] have to leave sick, Lord. There's enough
[38:45] power in here, Lord, that Lord, our
[38:47] bodies could be transformed, Lord. Our
[38:49] our our minds could be transformed,
[38:51] Lord. Our situations could be changed,
[38:54] Lord, if we'll just believe, Lord, and
[38:56] focus on you, Lord, and come with the
[38:58] right attitude, Lord. Help us, Lord,
[39:00] this morning, Lord. Not just me, Lord.
[39:02] Father, let the let the saints Lord
[39:04] realize, Lord, that they operate the
[39:06] gift, Lord. And Father, Lord, if we can
[39:08] just get in one mind and one accord,
[39:10] Lord, you will do the unspeakable.
[39:12] You'll do the unthinkable, Lord. You
[39:14] will do the exceeding abundant, Lord,
[39:16] above anything that we could ask or
[39:17] think, Lord, to what we're thinking,
[39:19] Lord. You can do more than that, Lord.
[39:21] What I've expected for this morning,
[39:23] Lord, you can do more than that, Lord.
[39:25] And so, Lord, we're calling you on the
[39:27] scene, Lord. Father, to come and speak
[39:29] to us, Lord, and move amongst us and
[39:32] Lord. And let this service, Lord, just
[39:34] be a springboard into a new year, Lord.
[39:36] Father, where we have renewed vision,
[39:38] Lord, Father, a renewed, Lord, fervor, a
[39:41] renewed zeal, Lord, a renewed fire in
[39:44] our soul, oh God, to serve you in a
[39:46] greater way, Lord. Grant we pray. Bless
[39:48] this congregation, Father. Bless, Lord,
[39:50] its pastor and Lord, the officers, Lord,
[39:53] and everyone, Lord, from young to old,
[39:56] Lord. Lord, from the newborn, Lord, to
[39:58] the old, Lord Jesus. We just pray that
[40:00] your blessing would just be upon this
[40:02] body of believers, Lord. And bless them,
[40:04] Lord, with revelation. Bless them, Lord
[40:07] Jesus, with uncction, Lord. Bless them,
[40:09] Father. Lord, with an anointing, oh God,
[40:12] a refilling, Lord, the dynamics, Lord,
[40:15] on the mechanics, Lord. Oh, everything,
[40:17] Lord Jesus. We ask your blessing,
[40:19] Father. Bless the word now as we read it
[40:22] and as we speak of it, Father, in Jesus
[40:24] Christ's name we pray.
[40:26] Amen. Amen. That's all the singing will
[40:29] do. If you turn with me to James chapter
[40:32] 4,
[40:34] James chapter 4.
[40:44] I don't have very many slides, but I
[40:46] usually have the clicker, but I can just
[40:48] tell you when it's I don't have that
[40:50] very many.
[40:52] Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm feeling good
[40:55] this morning. Amen. Not just in my
[40:57] flesh, but in my soul. Amen. The prophet
[41:00] of God said, "I'm always happy."
[41:03] And you, man, you read the You read the
[41:05] message. I like, man, he talked about
[41:07] having the blues and being down, but he
[41:09] said, "I'm always happy in my soul."
[41:13] Amen. Praise the Lord. That's right.
[41:16] So, I trust friends, it don't matter how
[41:18] we come this morning. We might come
[41:20] discouraged, under deep trials, and
[41:22] Amen. things on our mind, you know, but
[41:25] friends, in your soul, you're really
[41:27] happy. You've got the joy of the Lord.
[41:29] Amen. And the joy of the Lord is your
[41:31] strength. So, let loose to it. And may
[41:34] may the strength of the Holy Spirit just
[41:36] move in this service. Let's read it
[41:38] together. James 4 verse 10. Humble
[41:42] yourselves in the sight of the Lord and
[41:46] he shall lift you up.
[41:48] Now, I'm going to say like brother Zeg,
[41:52] some of you need to get into the service
[41:54] this morning. Amen. So, let's read it
[41:55] together. Amen. Chapter 4, verse 10.
[41:58] Humble yourselves in the sight of the
[42:00] Lord and he shall lift you up. Amen. You
[42:04] may be seated.
[42:06] Amen. Give Let's give us the the next um
[42:09] slide if you don't mind. My my thought
[42:10] this morning is attitude determines
[42:14] altitude. Now, that's right. Amen. I I
[42:16] trust that I'm speaking to eagles this
[42:18] morning.
[42:20] Amen. And friends, eagles are born to
[42:24] fly. Eagles are not born to mope around
[42:27] on the ground. Amen. We're not chickens.
[42:31] Come on now, friends. Amen. We're not
[42:33] chickens, friends. Chickens have wings.
[42:35] They pretend to fly. Amen. They flap
[42:37] their wings real high, but real real
[42:38] hard, but they only get about a couple
[42:40] feet maybe off the ground. Amen. But you
[42:42] were not born, friends, to cluck around
[42:43] and peck at your brother and sister.
[42:46] Amen. That's what chickens do, friends.
[42:48] Right. Amen. With chickens, when when
[42:49] they smell blood or whatever, Amen. I
[42:51] hear that they peck at one another and
[42:53] they talk about this and they've always
[42:54] got their head down looking for the next
[42:56] thing on the ground. But friends, we're
[42:57] we are eagles. Amen. We were born, Amen.
[43:00] to live higher, much higher than just on
[43:03] the ground, friends, and to be tied down
[43:05] to the things of the earth. Amen. So, I
[43:08] trust I'm I'm speaking to eagles this
[43:10] morning. And eagles, friends, were born
[43:12] to fly. And not only to fly at a certain
[43:14] level, friends, crows can fly.
[43:17] A hawk can fly. Amen. But it can't fly
[43:19] as high as an eagle. You were
[43:21] predestinated, friends. Amen. To fly at
[43:24] a height. Amen. That's higher than any
[43:26] other age. Amen. Any other
[43:28] denominational bird. Amen. You were born
[43:30] to fly in the heights. What is your
[43:32] position in Christ, friends? What did
[43:34] the prophet of God teach us that our
[43:35] position in Christ is? It's in heavenly
[43:37] places in Christ Jesus.
[43:40] How many's living in the predestinated
[43:42] place?
[43:44] Hallelujah. Now I I just pray that Amen.
[43:47] Our our our our altitude Amen. will take
[43:50] a little higher. Amen. This morning
[43:52] because all we need to do, friends, is
[43:53] just stretch your wings. Amen. And and
[43:55] find that as that draft of faith is
[43:57] coming through the room. Amen. To just
[43:59] stretch your wings, say, "Lord, that's
[44:01] for me." And move into a higher
[44:03] altitude. It's going to be your
[44:05] attitude, friends.
[44:08] Amen. proving his word. Brother Brandham
[44:10] says it's your approach. The attitude is
[44:13] what it takes. And that's what it is
[44:14] tonight. And may I say this morning,
[44:16] dear friend, it takes the attitude. We
[44:19] are and we believe that we are in the
[44:21] presence of Jesus Christ. How many
[44:24] believe friends that we're in the
[44:25] presence of Jesus Christ this morning
[44:28] that but it's your attitude that brings
[44:30] the results.
[44:32] So what that tells me friends is we can
[44:34] be in his presence. He can be in this
[44:35] room, but it's our attitude that will
[44:38] actually bring the results.
[44:40] He says the mechanics is here, the word,
[44:43] and so is the dynamics. If you can just
[44:45] get started, God will do the rest.
[44:50] Well, praise be to God. Amen. That's
[44:52] good news this morning, friends. If we
[44:54] can just get started, if we'll just
[44:56] allow him. Amen. The mechanics are here.
[44:58] We've got the mechanics. The dynamics of
[45:01] the Holy Ghost is here, friends. Amen.
[45:03] that we can just get started and let
[45:05] him. If we can just let go and let God.
[45:08] How many just like to let go and let God
[45:10] then he'll do the rest.
[45:13] So I pray friends that we can just go a
[45:15] little higher this morning. Next slide
[45:17] please brother. Attitude in the
[45:19] dictionary actually is a noun that means
[45:21] the manner or disposition or feeling or
[45:24] position with regard to a person or a
[45:26] thing or a tendency or an orientation
[45:29] especially of the mind. So our attitude
[45:31] is our feeling or our disposition
[45:34] towards a person or a thing. Now don't
[45:36] don't think all carnally now friends
[45:38] because the first thing we think about
[45:40] oh that's my feeling towards so and so
[45:41] and my feeling towards this church and
[45:43] that church and that group of people
[45:45] whatever but think spiritually friends.
[45:47] Amen. What's your feeling and your
[45:48] disposition and your your your your um
[45:51] tendency orientation of your mind
[45:53] towards God's word? What's your what's
[45:56] your mind? Amen. Towards what God has
[45:58] promised.
[46:01] Amen. Because friends, we we have also
[46:03] this tendency towards God's word. Well,
[46:05] it it might not work,
[46:09] right? Amen. We see the promise of God.
[46:12] I mean, we see the promise of God. Oh,
[46:13] he's my he's my peace. He's my joy. Oh,
[46:16] but it will it work? We have that kind
[46:18] of an attitude. It's of doubt, actually.
[46:21] Right.
[46:22] Amen. But friends, Amen. Oh, I I'll ask,
[46:25] but I I don't know if I'll get it. Be
[46:27] sure you won't get it. If we approach
[46:30] with that kind of an attitude, I I don't
[46:32] know if it's going to work. I know he
[46:34] says he's my healer, but but but we
[46:36] won't get it. It's our attitude. And the
[46:40] angel of the Lord, Brother Bram says,
[46:41] "Tonight, I want to speak to you about
[46:42] the angel of the Lord, and it's just as
[46:44] true, friends. I can't make you believe
[46:46] it. You see, I can only speak what's
[46:49] truth." Watch this. And your attitude
[46:52] towards it will determine the success
[46:54] it'll be for you.
[46:57] For you. You see? So friends, the Holy
[47:00] Spirit, the angel of the Lord can be
[47:02] here and meet needs and meet this
[47:04] person's need and meet that person's
[47:06] need because of their attitude. Amen.
[47:08] But we can be sitting right in the same
[47:09] service and feel nothing
[47:12] and get nothing and leave worse.
[47:16] Why? Because our attitude,
[47:20] God help us.
[47:23] Watch this. Watch what attitude will do.
[47:25] Now remember, attitude determines our
[47:28] altitude. How high we're going to fly.
[47:30] Now watch this. In Jehovah Gyra, brother
[47:32] Bram says, "Just keep praying, raising
[47:34] your hands." Now he's at the end of the
[47:35] service. Watch this. Now, oh, he says,
[47:38] "That's wonderful. I'm just watching the
[47:40] Holy Spirit." You know, friends,
[47:42] something is happening. Your attitude
[47:45] towards Christ has brought the anointing
[47:48] of the Holy Ghost upon me.
[47:52] It was actually their attitude, amen,
[47:55] that be to anoint the prophet of God. He
[47:58] was a prophet the whole time, friends.
[48:00] The gift of discernment was on him. He's
[48:03] all Malachi 4 the whole time. He was
[48:05] Revelations 10:7 the whole time. Amen.
[48:08] But actually, their attitude towards
[48:10] that gift brought the anointing of the
[48:12] Holy Ghost. And guess what happened?
[48:14] Visions started happening. Healing
[48:16] started happening. Come on, friends.
[48:18] Amen. It's the same God this morning,
[48:20] friends, that's here in this building.
[48:22] If our attitude towards the Holy Ghost
[48:25] will be right, Amen. the anointing of
[48:27] the Holy Ghost will come upon this
[48:29] service and we will leave changed.
[48:33] Hallelujah.
[48:35] What's our attitude, friends? Because we
[48:37] can come in. We can come in, friends. I
[48:39] I bet your attitude would have been a
[48:41] little different if brother Brandon was
[48:42] the speaker this morning.
[48:46] We would have come a little different.
[48:47] What if Jesus was here? My we would just
[48:50] be on the edge of our seat. But let me
[48:53] present to you that Jesus is here.
[48:56] He just did not come in the form of a of
[48:59] a Galilean man dressed like a Jew and oh
[49:02] come with shoulder length hair. He
[49:03] didn't come that way. He come in a 5'6.
[49:05] Amen. Asian brother.
[49:09] He's still the same though
[49:13] in expectation. Brother Bram says we
[49:15] always get what we expect.
[49:18] When people expect anything, well then
[49:20] they usually get what you look for. So I
[49:23] I trust you come friends expecting God
[49:26] to move.
[49:28] We should come that way every service.
[49:33] That's the trouble sometimes, friends.
[49:34] We lay it all on the preacher. We lay it
[49:37] all on the musicians. Well, there's no
[49:38] musicians today, so I guess the ser the
[49:40] the song service won't be as good.
[49:41] That's our expectation. That's our
[49:43] attitude towards it.
[49:45] Help us, Lord. Is my Oh, friends, I get
[49:48] affected by that, too.
[49:51] Amen. But watch this. Amen. What we
[49:53] friends, if we come expecting to
[49:55] criticize, you know what the prophet
[49:57] said? Oh, he the devil will will give
[49:59] you plenty to criticize.
[50:02] my so and so's singing too loud and the
[50:03] the timing's off and this and that and
[50:05] brother so and so's shouting too loud
[50:07] and preacher's yelling too loud and the
[50:09] sound's not right and they're getting
[50:10] feedback on this or he'll give you
[50:12] plenty to criticize
[50:14] but you know what the prophet of God
[50:16] said but if you come expecting to be
[50:18] blessed God will see to it
[50:24] hallelujah praise be to God it's the
[50:27] mental attitude that you have remember
[50:30] this and ever forget it. Now he's
[50:33] saying, remember,
[50:36] don't forget it. Don't forget this. The
[50:39] right mental attitude towards any
[50:41] promise of God will bring it to pass.
[50:45] The right mental attitude towards any
[50:48] promise of God. Identify the promise you
[50:51] have need of this morning. Identify the
[50:53] promise that you've been looking
[50:54] towards. Oh, I'm looking towards that.
[50:57] And I'm looking towards my my my my
[50:59] child or my loved one or my husband or
[51:01] my wife or my healing, whatever it is,
[51:03] friends, the right mental attitude
[51:05] towards that. Oh, that's the truth.
[51:08] That's the truth, Lord. That's for me.
[51:10] Amen. Will bring it to pass. That's what
[51:13] a vindicated prophet of God said.
[51:17] So, let's check our attitude this
[51:19] morning, friends. What is our attitude
[51:20] towards God and his promise? Because let
[51:23] me say this, friends. Sometimes we do
[51:25] get disappointed in God.
[51:28] We do. Sometimes we even get angry and
[51:31] bitter against God. You say, "Yes, we
[51:34] do." Amen. You might be because of
[51:38] what's happening in your life or it
[51:40] seems like your prayers aren't being
[51:41] answered or it feels like you're not
[51:43] getting through and he's not speaking to
[51:45] you.
[51:47] Don't worry, friends. You're not alone.
[51:50] The prophet of God himself said, "He, I
[51:52] feel like an orphan.
[51:54] He hasn't spoken to me in whatever time.
[51:56] So friends, sometimes it seems like he's
[51:59] silent. But friends, let me remind you.
[52:01] He has never left you. He's not forsaken
[52:03] you. You're still a child of God. You
[52:06] are still his child, friends. And he
[52:08] loves you.
[52:10] Let me say this, friends. He has always
[52:12] loved you. Amen. I've heard it said this
[52:14] way. Amen. That he has loved you with a
[52:16] 10 out of 10.
[52:18] Hallelujah. Before the foundation of the
[52:20] world, when you were a sinner, when you
[52:22] were a low down sinner, he loved you a
[52:24] 10 out of 10. When you got saved, he
[52:26] loved you a 10 out of 10. When you
[52:28] started serving him, he loved you a 10
[52:30] out of 10. When you failed him after you
[52:32] gave your heart to the Lord, he loves
[52:34] you a 10 out of 10.
[52:36] That's elective love, friends. It's not
[52:39] a human love. We love one another on a
[52:41] scale. Well, this so and so did this for
[52:43] me and they gave me a compliment. They
[52:45] like they shook my hand today. I love
[52:46] them and Eve out of out of 10 now. No,
[52:48] it's not that kind of friends kind of
[52:50] love God loves you with. He loved you
[52:52] before the foundation of the world. He
[52:54] chose you.
[52:57] You're still his this morning.
[53:02] The right mental attitude
[53:06] because you know what? Sometimes we're
[53:08] like little kids.
[53:10] You know, God God wants us to be like
[53:12] little children in in our faith, right?
[53:13] To have childlike faith. But sometimes
[53:15] like we're like a kid when we don't get
[53:17] what we want. What do we do? What do
[53:19] kids do? They pout.
[53:22] Yeah. They pout. They
[53:27] stomp their feet a little bit. And we
[53:28] get like that
[53:30] cuz we're not quite getting it the way
[53:32] we want it, right?
[53:34] Guess what God does? He just lets you
[53:35] pow a little while.
[53:38] You remember the prophet of God? Let me
[53:40] give you an example. So you remember
[53:42] when that when that young lady, right,
[53:43] she she was she was having a baby. She
[53:46] had this septasemia or whatever. Amen.
[53:48] Brother Brown come and started praying
[53:50] for her and oh and and and and she
[53:52] started getting better and and but
[53:54] through that her her I believe her
[53:56] mother came back to the Lord. And
[53:57] brother Brown talks about their family,
[53:58] you know, they were kind of the type of
[53:59] family that would come and go and when
[54:01] things were going good, they'd be in
[54:02] church and when things were bad, they
[54:04] wouldn't be in church. Anyways, that was
[54:06] the kind of family they were. Amen. But
[54:08] through the sickness, Amen. Their family
[54:10] started coming back to the Lord,
[54:12] repenting and coming back to the Lord.
[54:13] And oh, it was a wonderful time. Amen.
[54:16] And she and and remember that one night
[54:18] in the hospital bed. Amen. She started
[54:19] to say to her mom, "Oh, mom, I'm going
[54:22] home."
[54:23] Right? And the mom said, "Yes, dear.
[54:25] Yes, dear. They'll be letting
[54:26] discharging you from the hospital in a
[54:27] couple days." "Oh, no, mom. I'm going
[54:29] home." And that night, she passed away.
[54:31] Right?
[54:33] And brother Brandham was distraught
[54:35] because you know the the family had been
[54:37] giving their heart to the Lord and she
[54:39] seemed to be getting better and what all
[54:40] of a sudden she dies and in that moment
[54:43] he said Lord you owe me an an
[54:46] understanding
[54:49] wrong attitude our prophet.
[54:53] So we can get the wrong attitude friends
[54:56] as children of God. You know what he
[54:58] said? He said, "The L God let me pout it
[55:00] out for a couple days."
[55:02] And in fact, it was a couple months or
[55:04] weeks or whatever it was, a period of
[55:07] time before God showed him a vision that
[55:09] she should have died in some creek there
[55:12] before, right? But she wasn't ready. So
[55:14] when her heart was right, that he could
[55:16] take her.
[55:18] But it wasn't until brother Brandon got
[55:20] his heart right, his attitude in the
[55:23] right place till God could show him. So
[55:25] sometimes friends, you might wonder, why
[55:27] ain't God showing me things? Why ain't I
[55:29] seem to be getting higher in my
[55:30] experience? Check your attitude.
[55:33] I hope that's okay.
[55:41] Hallelujah. Praise be to the Lord. Amen.
[55:43] What else does that word mean? Let's go
[55:45] to the next slide if you don't mind.
[55:47] Attitude is your position or posture of
[55:50] the body
[55:52] appropriate to or expressive of an
[55:54] action or an emotion. Attitude. You know
[55:57] what I'm talking about, right?
[56:00] You can just sense that attitude coming
[56:02] off somebody. They don't have to say a
[56:04] thing.
[56:07] You all know what I'm talking about.
[56:10] Brother Zigg probably knows. Oh my. You
[56:13] can just see somebody I mean sitting in
[56:15] their chair and there's just like
[56:19] my they're just slouch in their chair
[56:21] and they ain't amening no matter what
[56:23] you say.
[56:26] Oh my. Hallelujah. But contrast that to
[56:30] that's right. Amen. That's a different
[56:33] attitude
[56:34] towards the word. You see friends, we we
[56:36] we make it so carnal. Well, I I'll enter
[56:39] in because it's so and so. I'll enter
[56:42] the ser song service because it's so and
[56:43] so. Oh, come on, friends. We're just as
[56:47] carnal as can be, friends. I'm like you,
[56:49] too. I live in the same kind of flesh
[56:51] that you do. That old broken down, Amen.
[56:54] fallen flesh that that is a respector of
[56:56] persons.
[56:58] But God is no respector of persons this
[57:01] morning, friends. And he's going to
[57:02] speak to you this morning, friends. I
[57:04] trust that we can just open up our
[57:06] hearts to him. Hallelujah. Now this last
[57:09] definition of attitude I actually didn't
[57:11] know of before I started studying on
[57:13] this but it's the next slide here it's
[57:15] it's related to aeronautics so the way
[57:17] an airplane in aeronautics attitude
[57:20] refers to the orientation of an aircraft
[57:23] in relation to a reference frame
[57:25] typically the horizon or the earth's
[57:26] surface is defined by three rotational
[57:29] angles. So pitch, right? Roll and yaw,
[57:32] right? So in a three-dimensional. So, so
[57:36] if we took this to the spiritual, does
[57:38] it really mean that our attitude
[57:40] determines our position in Christ? I
[57:42] would present to you that it does. The
[57:45] position, you see, the attitude of an
[57:47] aircraft is actually its position in the
[57:50] air. The way it's positioned.
[57:54] Amen. And watch this now. The next
[57:56] slide. I'm getting through all my slides
[57:58] right quick here, but this is what we're
[57:59] talking about here, right? Is the pitch
[58:01] is the position of the nose. Is it up?
[58:04] Is it down? Is it going up or down?
[58:06] Amen. The roll is the wings are they
[58:08] going this way or that way? Yaw is like
[58:10] that. Now, why is this important? Why is
[58:13] this important? Now, because you know,
[58:15] brother Brandham, you know, he talks
[58:17] about so many times he says, now your
[58:20] attitude will determine your eternal
[58:22] destination. Your attitude towards the
[58:25] word, your attitude towards Christ
[58:28] determines your eternal destination. I
[58:30] thought, my goodness, because the
[58:32] attitude of this of this airplane, Amen.
[58:34] It will determine where it ends up.
[58:39] So, watch this now. So, how high it
[58:41] flies, right? Whether it's it gets to
[58:44] its intended destination, and it
[58:46] determines how sick anyone that's on
[58:48] there gets. Because it's just rolling
[58:50] and turning and up and down and all over
[58:52] the place. Friends, that's it's going to
[58:54] be hard to keep things down down to
[58:56] where it should be.
[58:58] That's why they have those bags, right?
[59:00] In airplanes, we have too much
[59:01] turbulence, right? You get sick. Amen.
[59:04] But watch this. Why is attitude
[59:06] important in in aeronautics? Stability
[59:09] and control. See, pilots must maintain
[59:12] the correct attitude for stable and safe
[59:15] flight.
[59:17] Now, think spiritually. Sometimes we
[59:19] wonder why our lives are so up and down
[59:22] and why we're we're turning upside down
[59:24] and here and there and we're just
[59:26] twisting all over the place. Check your
[59:28] attitude.
[59:31] Now, I found this really interesting.
[59:32] Next slide. Instrumentation. Pilots rely
[59:37] on the attitude indicator.
[59:40] It's actually an instrument. You've seen
[59:42] this maybe right in airplanes, but this
[59:45] is what a pilot would use to to
[59:48] understand its orientation. You see the
[59:50] brown is the earth and the blue is the
[59:53] sky and right where it's at there, it's
[59:56] level. It's right on the ground. So
[59:58] that's its orientation. And and actually
[1:00:00] that instrument is a gyroscope. So
[1:00:02] depending on the position, it'll twist
[1:00:04] and turn and you can see. And now think
[1:00:06] spiritually now if God is looking at
[1:00:08] your attitude indicator this morning,
[1:00:12] Guess what, friends? If that's all
[1:00:14] brown, it's all full of the earth. It's
[1:00:17] all full of the world.
[1:00:20] Guess where you're going? You're going
[1:00:22] down.
[1:00:25] Hello.
[1:00:27] But friends, if you're going up, guess
[1:00:28] what you see? All you see is blue. You
[1:00:30] don't see no earth. You don't see no
[1:00:32] world.
[1:00:34] Worldliness is gone. Oh, and we think
[1:00:36] worldliness is smoking. And I got rid of
[1:00:39] that. I I I don't drink. I don't smoke.
[1:00:41] I don't swear. I don't tell dirty jokes.
[1:00:43] You know what worldliness actually is,
[1:00:45] friends. Amen. It's the cares of this
[1:00:47] life.
[1:00:52] Amen.
[1:00:53] The care. What do they It chokes us,
[1:00:55] friends. Amen. How many have been
[1:00:57] affected by the world? I have.
[1:01:02] Amen. We need to get out of this world.
[1:01:03] Amen. We need to change our attitude
[1:01:06] that friends, it looks like this and all
[1:01:07] we see is the sky, the blue sky of the
[1:01:10] heavenlies.
[1:01:12] That's why the Bible says, "Set your
[1:01:14] affections
[1:01:16] on things above,
[1:01:19] not things on the earth." Yes, that's
[1:01:22] the truth. Now, Brother Bram says, "In
[1:01:24] the hour has come." Now, the right
[1:01:25] mental attitude. All you along here, do
[1:01:27] you understand what I mean when I say
[1:01:29] the right mental attitude?
[1:01:31] Your right mental attitude towards God
[1:01:34] divine God's divine promise will bring
[1:01:36] any promise to pass. Now maybe you don't
[1:01:40] believe that. You say, "Well, my faith
[1:01:42] is weak. I wouldn't confess it." Come
[1:01:45] on, brother.
[1:01:47] I wouldn't confess it. We might think
[1:01:49] it. The devil might even put it in your
[1:01:52] thoughts, but don't confess it.
[1:01:54] See, don't let the devil know that.
[1:01:57] Always say, "I've got good faith."
[1:02:00] Let's say it this morning. I've got good
[1:02:03] faith.
[1:02:05] I'm a child of God.
[1:02:08] I'm going in a rapture.
[1:02:12] Amen. Oh, he says, "I believe God with
[1:02:15] all my heart."
[1:02:18] You see, don't testify nothing of the
[1:02:20] devil. Then we're testifying, we're
[1:02:22] speaking his language, right? Amen. We
[1:02:24] don't speak the devil's language.
[1:02:27] We speak the queen's language.
[1:02:30] the queen of heaven language. It says
[1:02:33] all things are possible.
[1:02:35] God is of able. He's more than able.
[1:02:40] Don't testify nothing of the devil. And
[1:02:42] when you accept him as your healer,
[1:02:43] watch this. Don't never act like you're
[1:02:46] sick or crippled anymore.
[1:02:50] Whoa. Hallelujah.
[1:02:52] Or when you accept him as your healer,
[1:02:54] don't never act like you're sick. Amen.
[1:02:58] Oh, but I got this pain. Amen. Don't let
[1:03:01] them know that.
[1:03:05] Hallelujah. Because you know what
[1:03:07] happens, friends? I woke up this morning
[1:03:08] with a headache.
[1:03:11] It's gone. Yeah, it's gone. Amen. But we
[1:03:14] can wake up, oh, oh, I don't think I can
[1:03:17] go to church today. Oh, the devil sees
[1:03:19] that. I'm going to just pour it on even
[1:03:20] more.
[1:03:23] Oh,
[1:03:24] yeah. I'll just pour it on. pour it on.
[1:03:27] Amen. But what if we said, "Oh, I feel
[1:03:29] good.
[1:03:31] Victory is mine." And your body is
[1:03:34] saying exactly the opposite. So then in
[1:03:36] your mind, and then the devil says,
[1:03:38] "You're lying. You're lying."
[1:03:41] You're not lying. No way. Because the
[1:03:43] Bible says, "Amen." Jesus said, "Let
[1:03:45] every man's word be a lie and mine be
[1:03:48] the truth." What does his word say?
[1:03:51] His word says, "I'm the Lord that health
[1:03:53] all thy diseases." That's the truth. If
[1:03:56] that's the truth, I'm healed. I'm well.
[1:03:59] I'm happy. I'm the bride.
[1:04:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:04:06] Believe that you're healed. Take him at
[1:04:08] his word. Then it's all over on God.
[1:04:10] Then
[1:04:12] can I read that again? Take him at his
[1:04:15] word. Then it's all over on God. Then
[1:04:19] the thing about it is friends is we try
[1:04:21] to take it on
[1:04:24] when there's things in our h in our home
[1:04:26] in our life. Oh, I can control it. I can
[1:04:28] do it. I just got to work more to get
[1:04:29] out of this financial situation. I just
[1:04:31] got to do more. I just got to do that. I
[1:04:32] got to No. Give it on to God.
[1:04:37] Hallelujah. Praise be in the name of the
[1:04:39] Lord. See? Oh, then it's all over on God
[1:04:42] then and not on you. See, as long as you
[1:04:45] take God at his word, then the word will
[1:04:48] produce what it promised to do.
[1:04:54] The word will do what it promised if
[1:04:57] we'll have the right mental attitude
[1:04:58] towards it. We'll believe it. All he
[1:05:01] asks is for us to believe it and believe
[1:05:04] that it's for you.
[1:05:06] That's many times the problem, friends.
[1:05:08] We believe it. Oh yes, God's word is
[1:05:10] true for so and so.
[1:05:14] God's word is true for brother Brandham.
[1:05:17] God's word is true for brother Zigg. But
[1:05:19] what about you?
[1:05:21] What about you? That you're an
[1:05:23] overcomer.
[1:05:24] Hallelujah. That every devil is under
[1:05:27] your feet.
[1:05:30] Yes, sir. Oh, let let us just grasp onto
[1:05:33] it. Friends, I I encourage you, friends,
[1:05:35] if there's just a twinge of Yeah, that's
[1:05:37] the truth. Clutch onto it. That's God.
[1:05:41] Amen. trying to inject himself into your
[1:05:44] soul. Amen. To give you that faith and
[1:05:46] anoint the faith that's already in you.
[1:05:49] You realize, friends, that faith is
[1:05:51] actually unconscious because we think,
[1:05:53] "Oh, I got to feel it. I got to feel
[1:05:54] that super anointing." You've already
[1:05:56] You've already been anointed.
[1:05:59] You see, David had already been anointed
[1:06:04] before he met Goliath. He had already
[1:06:06] been anointed. It didn't matter if he
[1:06:08] felt like he was an overcomer when he
[1:06:10] went to meet Goliath. He was an
[1:06:12] overcomer.
[1:06:14] It's not based on feelings, friends.
[1:06:15] Let's stop basing our experience on
[1:06:18] feelings. It's not if you feel like it's
[1:06:20] right. It is right.
[1:06:23] God's word is right. Whether we feel
[1:06:25] like it or not. I don't feel like
[1:06:27] worshiping. Worship him anyway. He's
[1:06:29] worthy of it.
[1:06:31] It don't matter how we feel, friends.
[1:06:33] He's worthy anyhow.
[1:06:37] our attitude, friends. Oh, but let me
[1:06:40] let me tell you this friends. Amen. If
[1:06:41] if God would require something of us, if
[1:06:44] he requires us to sacrifice, wouldn't he
[1:06:47] sacrifice himself? He did.
[1:06:50] He wouldn't ask us to do anything that
[1:06:52] he has not done himself or he's willing
[1:06:54] to do himself. He asked us to sacrifice.
[1:06:57] He asked us to be obedient. He was
[1:06:59] obedient even unto death, even to the
[1:07:01] cross.
[1:07:03] So if he asked us to have the right
[1:07:04] attitude, what kind of attitude do you
[1:07:06] think he has? The right attitude.
[1:07:09] And I've got good news for you this
[1:07:11] morning, friends. His attitude towards
[1:07:13] you has already determined your
[1:07:15] altitude.
[1:07:17] Did you catch that? His attitude towards
[1:07:20] you has already determined your
[1:07:23] altitude. He chose that you would be
[1:07:25] bride. He chose that you would live in
[1:07:27] the golden age of Leadyia and overcome
[1:07:30] it and fly above it.
[1:07:34] His attitude towards you, friends, is
[1:07:36] that he chose you before the foundation
[1:07:38] of the world to be an overcomer. He
[1:07:40] chose you. He already seen in his mind.
[1:07:42] Amen. That you would overcome those
[1:07:44] demons that you feel like you're
[1:07:45] struggling so much with. He already
[1:07:48] thought his attitude towards you is you
[1:07:50] can fly above that. I made you. I gave
[1:07:53] you every capability. Amen. to overcome
[1:07:55] that demon of lust, that demon of
[1:07:58] depression. Come on. That demon of
[1:08:00] whatever, friends, greater is he that's
[1:08:03] in you. What's our attitude towards that
[1:08:06] this morning? I say amen. I say that's
[1:08:09] nothing but the truth.
[1:08:12] Glory be to God.
[1:08:14] You know friends, when you look at at
[1:08:16] the natural eagle friends, that mama
[1:08:18] eagle friend, she's got a she's got an
[1:08:20] attitude towards her little eaglet that
[1:08:23] they are going to fly.
[1:08:26] But you know when they're first born,
[1:08:29] oh, she just makes that nest all comfy,
[1:08:32] right? She she lines it with that rabbit
[1:08:34] fur. Oh, just warm and fuzzy and oh,
[1:08:38] that's so nice. And that's how it feels
[1:08:40] when we first come to the Lord, when
[1:08:42] we're first born. into the nest of the
[1:08:44] message.
[1:08:46] And friends, let me say this. Friends,
[1:08:48] when you were born into the message, you
[1:08:50] young people, the the the children and
[1:08:52] ones that have been born into message
[1:08:54] families, you know where the eagle puts
[1:08:56] its nest, high up in the cliff of the
[1:08:58] rock,
[1:08:59] where the foxes and the predators can't
[1:09:01] get to. You're already born high.
[1:09:05] But that is not your predestinated
[1:09:06] position. No. Are you hearing me? Oh,
[1:09:10] because we think, "Oh, we're in the
[1:09:12] message. We're not in a denomination.
[1:09:14] We're not in the world. I never did
[1:09:15] this. I never did that. I'm flying high.
[1:09:18] Oh, I'm living high. You were just born
[1:09:20] there.
[1:09:22] God has something even higher for you.
[1:09:26] That's why the the the mama eagle at
[1:09:30] some point cuz in her mind, her attitude
[1:09:33] is this is not their predestinated
[1:09:35] position
[1:09:37] in the nest, even though it's high up.
[1:09:40] So, what does she do? She starts ripping
[1:09:42] out that that comfort fur. She starts
[1:09:45] ripping it out. And the eagle is saying,
[1:09:47] "Mama, what are you doing?
[1:09:51] What's going on? What's going on? Church
[1:09:54] ain't as comfortable as it was.
[1:09:58] Oh, poke here, poke there. This is going
[1:10:01] wrong. So and so doesn't smile at me
[1:10:03] anymore. Oh, all these things." And you
[1:10:06] wonder why? Why? Why? Like those little
[1:10:09] eiglets. Why? Why? This was so nice,
[1:10:12] mama. You brought the food to me. I just
[1:10:14] opened my mouth. Oh, life was so grand.
[1:10:17] This Christian life was so grand
[1:10:20] until you ruined it.
[1:10:24] God allows the trials. God allows, you
[1:10:27] know, hurts.
[1:10:29] Poke here, poke there. Oh, so and so
[1:10:31] offended me. Oh, there's a reason. Don't
[1:10:35] get discouraged.
[1:10:38] Hallelujah. Oh, because they Oh, I'm
[1:10:41] enjoy my salvation. God lets you enjoy
[1:10:43] that for a while, right? Oh, he just
[1:10:45] lets you. Oh, everything is just
[1:10:47] heavenly. Oh, everyone in the church are
[1:10:49] angels.
[1:10:53] And then everyone stays angels.
[1:10:56] If we can just see with with with
[1:10:59] spiritual eyes.
[1:11:01] Oh, but friends, those little eagles,
[1:11:03] they ah ah ah but but remember her
[1:11:06] vision right of them is them flying.
[1:11:11] So she starts ripping out that fur and
[1:11:13] you know what she does? She takes her
[1:11:15] wings and she starts
[1:11:18] and oh they start they start
[1:11:20] experiencing that rushing mighty wind
[1:11:21] for the first time. But it's and it's
[1:11:24] blowing out those old worldly feathers
[1:11:26] and all those things and all the things
[1:11:27] of the world is blowing off of them. Oh,
[1:11:30] but the dust and the dirt from the nest
[1:11:32] is getting in there. Hey, M. What are
[1:11:34] you doing? I'm just preparing you for
[1:11:36] something greater.
[1:11:39] But I like where I'm at. I like just
[1:11:42] coming to church. I like just living my
[1:11:44] religion on Sunday.
[1:11:47] I got something greater for you.
[1:11:51] You're not asking me to move a little
[1:11:52] higher. Yes, I am. God's attitude is
[1:11:56] you're born to fly. You were born to be
[1:11:59] in the heavenlies. I'm not satisfied
[1:12:02] with you just being a message believer.
[1:12:06] Hallelujah. I made you an overcomer. I
[1:12:10] made you the final voice to the final
[1:12:11] age. So what does he do? He makes things
[1:12:14] uncomfortable. He brings on trials. He
[1:12:16] brings on tests and we wonder why. Why?
[1:12:18] Why? He wants you to fly higher.
[1:12:22] The eagle and nest. Oh, you can say I
[1:12:24] got my name on the book, but have you
[1:12:26] ever soared the heavenly?
[1:12:29] Hallelujah.
[1:12:31] Now, the chicken knows not what the
[1:12:33] eagle's talking about.
[1:12:36] Amen. I don't There's no chickens here.
[1:12:37] I trust. Amen. But a chicken is just is
[1:12:40] just satisfied with going to church.
[1:12:44] I go to church. I go to restored word.
[1:12:47] Brother Zigg is my pastor. I believe in
[1:12:48] Malachi 4. You can still be a chicken
[1:12:51] and say that. Amen.
[1:12:53] Yeah.
[1:12:56] Now, the chicken knows not what the
[1:12:57] eagle's talking about, but the mother
[1:12:59] eagle is certainly decided because she's
[1:13:02] a real mother. And she decides that her
[1:13:05] babies will not walk like chickens.
[1:13:08] I'm talking about her attitude. This is
[1:13:11] God's attitude towards his children. She
[1:13:14] will not have you walk like a chicken.
[1:13:17] So, she watches them until they fully
[1:13:19] feather out. She watches over them. And
[1:13:20] then one day she decides it's time to
[1:13:23] change the position.
[1:13:25] I'm so glad that God don't keep us
[1:13:27] stale.
[1:13:30] He's got something new all the time.
[1:13:33] Just one blessing after another.
[1:13:36] Oh, hallelujah. Sometimes it don't feel
[1:13:39] like a blessing because it's just trial
[1:13:41] after trial, test after test, trial
[1:13:43] after trial, test after test. Right? You
[1:13:46] all know what I'm talking about. What
[1:13:47] friends? Amen. It's for a purpose. God
[1:13:50] has in his mind to develop a character
[1:13:52] in you that's fit to rule. You see
[1:13:56] character, Amen. Apart, Amen. Amen. What
[1:13:58] is it? What is it? Power apart from
[1:14:00] character is satanic. But power with
[1:14:03] character is what? Fit to rule.
[1:14:06] That's what the prophet of God said.
[1:14:07] Amen. We need character. And character
[1:14:09] is not is not Amen. a gift.
[1:14:12] How many you know I'm quoting from the
[1:14:13] church age book. Character is not a
[1:14:15] gift. God just doesn't give it to you.
[1:14:17] He gives you the Holy Ghost. It's a
[1:14:20] gift. Amen. But your character, friends,
[1:14:22] is a victory.
[1:14:25] And it only comes by suffering. Oh, no.
[1:14:27] I didn't want to hear that. But you want
[1:14:29] character. You want something to take
[1:14:31] out of this world. Then God will give
[1:14:33] you testing. He'll give you trials.
[1:14:35] He'll let someone rub you the wrong way
[1:14:37] and say something offensive to you. It's
[1:14:39] just for your character. Say, "Thank
[1:14:41] you, Lord. Give me the strength. Give me
[1:14:44] the power to overcome that."
[1:14:47] Amen.
[1:14:49] Oh, she flies in and they have a mighty
[1:14:51] rushing wind. They never felt it before
[1:14:53] because they were born in the cliff of
[1:14:55] the rock. Why? They're eagles. But God
[1:14:58] changes it. He gives them something new.
[1:15:01] And as the church was born in the cliff
[1:15:02] of the rock, we cannot be satisfied
[1:15:06] there. Amen.
[1:15:09] We were born in the cliff of the rock.
[1:15:11] We were born as it were in a message. We
[1:15:13] were born into a mystical body of
[1:15:15] Christ. Amen. But we are not. We cannot
[1:15:18] be satisfied there. Don't get me wrong,
[1:15:20] friends. If you're not born again this
[1:15:21] morning, you must be born again. But
[1:15:24] don't stop there. Amen. Is this okay,
[1:15:28] friends? We We're not even so much even
[1:15:30] in the born again age. We're in adoption
[1:15:33] season. Amen. Hallelujah. God wants us.
[1:15:37] Amen. Paul said in Galatians 4, Amen.
[1:15:40] Though a son, yet he has to learn. Amen.
[1:15:42] Be a tutor.
[1:15:44] The tutor is the Holy Ghost. the tutors
[1:15:47] here this morning teaching us we must
[1:15:48] have the right attitude. We must have
[1:15:50] the right attitude towards God's word.
[1:15:52] We must have the right attitude towards
[1:15:53] God's gifts.
[1:15:56] Amen. Amen.
[1:15:59] Where we're in that season where sons
[1:16:01] and daughters of God are positionally
[1:16:03] placed in a body. Not just that you're
[1:16:07] in a body, but you're positionally
[1:16:08] placed.
[1:16:10] So friends, amen. Watch this now. Let me
[1:16:12] let me continue on. God stirs up the
[1:16:15] nest sometimes. Comes in with a mighty
[1:16:17] rushing wind like he did on the day of
[1:16:18] Pentecost.
[1:16:21] And all the old worldly loose feathers
[1:16:23] fly out.
[1:16:25] He sends a Pentecostal revival and
[1:16:26] shakes up the nest.
[1:16:29] We don't like that, but he shakes it up
[1:16:31] anyhow. Then he gives a certain scream
[1:16:34] and oh all the little eaglets know
[1:16:36] something is fixing to happen. They're
[1:16:38] eagles. That's the reason. Watch this.
[1:16:41] When you see a shaking time come, eagles
[1:16:45] are ready for a blessing. Amen.
[1:16:48] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. When you
[1:16:50] see a sh because friends, we always we
[1:16:53] see the shaking and what what is our
[1:16:54] response? Oh. Oh my. Look at what's
[1:16:57] happening around the world. Look what's
[1:16:58] happening in America. Look what's
[1:17:00] happening around us. Look what's
[1:17:01] happening in politics. Look what's
[1:17:03] happening in our family, in our church,
[1:17:05] in this and that in the message. Stop
[1:17:07] looking at it that way. Oh, there's such
[1:17:09] a shaking going on in the message. Say
[1:17:11] hallelujah. Praise God. There's coming a
[1:17:14] blessing.
[1:17:15] Eagles, when they see a shaking, they
[1:17:17] know there's a blessing coming. Oh, so
[1:17:20] if you're being shaken in your
[1:17:21] experience, oh, this and that, and my
[1:17:23] world just seems to be shaking. Get
[1:17:25] ready. God's about to give you a
[1:17:27] blessing.
[1:17:29] Glory be to God. Don't be alarmed,
[1:17:32] friends. Amen. Get ready. We sing a song
[1:17:34] back home. Amen. Brother, look up. Lift
[1:17:38] up your head. Your redemption is just
[1:17:41] ahead. Get ready for that great reunion
[1:17:44] like he said. Sister, look up. Lift up
[1:17:48] your head. Don't be looking at the fear
[1:17:50] and dread. You see, all the fear and
[1:17:53] dread is on the earth here. And if
[1:17:55] you're a chicken, then you're focused on
[1:17:57] that.
[1:17:58] But if you're an eagle, there was a
[1:18:00] certain scream that come and said, "Oh,
[1:18:03] you're meant to be up here.
[1:18:06] Oh, I heard an eagle scream and
[1:18:08] something in me echoed. That's the
[1:18:10] truth. That's the truth. Hallelujah.
[1:18:14] There's a magnet in you, friends. Why
[1:18:16] did you get attracted to this message?
[1:18:18] What attracted to you it? It was the It
[1:18:21] was the message in you, the Christ in
[1:18:23] you, that seed gene of God in you that
[1:18:27] was attracted. There was a certain
[1:18:28] attraction, a magnetic force. Oh, glory
[1:18:32] be to God. You ought to thank God for
[1:18:34] that.
[1:18:35] Not everybody, friends, there's a lot of
[1:18:37] humanity in this earth and that magnet
[1:18:40] comes across them and they don't see a
[1:18:41] thing. They don't feel a thing. They
[1:18:43] think, "What are they shouting about?
[1:18:45] What are they getting so excited about?"
[1:18:46] But something in your heart saying, "Oh
[1:18:48] my God, that feels like home to me." Oh,
[1:18:52] hallelujah. You ought to rejoice this
[1:18:54] morning.
[1:18:56] Hallelujah. I'm thankful this morning.
[1:18:58] There's something in my heart that
[1:19:00] echoes, "Oh, amen." That's nothing but
[1:19:02] the truth.
[1:19:04] Oh, glory be to God. The church is ready
[1:19:07] for something. The true church of God,
[1:19:09] when they see a shaking time coming.
[1:19:13] So, what does the mama eagles do then?
[1:19:16] She gets on the edge of that of that
[1:19:17] nest and she says, "Now, e kids, you
[1:19:20] grab onto my wing,
[1:19:23] right?" And so, they take their little
[1:19:24] beak and they latch on to that that
[1:19:26] feather or whatever it is. Oh, and what
[1:19:28] does she do? She just gives a couple and
[1:19:31] out she goes right into the heavenlies.
[1:19:35] Can you imagine, friends? It's their
[1:19:36] first time.
[1:19:41] Wow.
[1:19:42] Mama. Mama. Wow.
[1:19:47] My goodness. I never thought Oh, I never
[1:19:50] thought we could see like this.
[1:19:53] That's what the serpent seat is.
[1:19:56] That's what that means. Oh, that's what
[1:19:58] the seven seals is. That's what the
[1:20:00] seven church ages is. That's what the
[1:20:02] godhead is. Oh my. Oh wow. Hallelujah.
[1:20:05] This ain't what you know what I'm
[1:20:06] talking about. When she first takes you
[1:20:08] on her wings and oh just oh and you get
[1:20:11] into the heavenlies for the first time
[1:20:13] and oh God begins the spiritual amnesia
[1:20:15] begins to lift off of you and you begin
[1:20:17] to realize oh my this is what I really
[1:20:19] long for all my life.
[1:20:23] Oh you know you know what I'm talking
[1:20:25] about friends. Amen. When God begins to
[1:20:27] reveal to you what the message really
[1:20:29] is.
[1:20:31] Yeah. And that it's actually you. It's
[1:20:33] not about even just a prophet, but it's
[1:20:35] about you. It's just not about mommy
[1:20:38] eagle flying. Oh, she's wa mama eagle so
[1:20:40] great. Look at her fly. Look at her
[1:20:42] great big wings. That's you. That's you.
[1:20:46] That's what you're supposed to be.
[1:20:49] Amen. But watch. So there they are. Oh
[1:20:52] my. They're just having a Pentecostal
[1:20:54] hallelujah time in the heavenlies. Oh,
[1:20:57] and watch this. Brother Brham says,
[1:20:59] "Now, it's a very peculiar thing that
[1:21:01] she does." Then she goes just as high as
[1:21:03] she can go. Those little eaglets, not
[1:21:06] murmuring a bit. Why? They got their
[1:21:08] little beaks set in them feathers. They
[1:21:10] just can't murmur.
[1:21:15] Oh, they're just hung on to the word.
[1:21:18] And they can't murmur.
[1:21:22] They just got their little big set in
[1:21:24] them feathers. They just can't murmur.
[1:21:26] And that's the way God takes his church.
[1:21:28] If you're really set in the word, you
[1:21:30] don't murmur. You just hold on. If God
[1:21:33] made the promise, God can keep his
[1:21:35] promise. So, they just hold on. And she
[1:21:37] just takes them into places they never
[1:21:39] thought they'd ever be. When she's
[1:21:42] soaring up, oh, she goes into the bright
[1:21:44] blue sky. But the strange thing about it
[1:21:47] is when she gets up there, she shakes
[1:21:49] them everyone off.
[1:21:52] Oh, really?
[1:21:54] Oh. Oh, really?
[1:21:58] She must not love them. She must not
[1:22:01] care anymore. No. No. She's doing that
[1:22:04] cuz she loves them. She really cares for
[1:22:07] them. Oh, and we wonder after that
[1:22:10] initial and then boom, the trial comes.
[1:22:12] Oh, God don't love me. Oh, he loves you.
[1:22:16] He loves you. Hallelujah. That's the way
[1:22:19] God does his church. Shakes them off.
[1:22:22] Why? Fly for yourself.
[1:22:26] And the strange thing is she shakes them
[1:22:28] off. She doesn't leave them.
[1:22:30] She don't leave them. She makes a big
[1:22:33] circle and goes out and flies around
[1:22:35] watching them. And there those little
[1:22:37] fellows knowing what knowing what to do
[1:22:38] for the first time. They're flopping
[1:22:40] their little wings. My they don't quite
[1:22:43] know how to do it yet, right? That's how
[1:22:45] sometimes we were in our in our
[1:22:46] Christian walk, right? We we're trying.
[1:22:48] We're just trying to overcome. We're
[1:22:50] just trying to fly above the things of
[1:22:52] the world, right? Oh, they're turning
[1:22:54] over somersaults and everything else,
[1:22:56] but they're flopping anyhow. They're
[1:22:57] making some kind of an effort.
[1:23:01] What if those eagles had the attitude of
[1:23:05] I'm just waiting for the rapture.
[1:23:07] Come on, brother. I'm just waiting.
[1:23:11] Because brother Brandham did everything.
[1:23:14] Brother Zigg will do everything. The
[1:23:15] ministry will do everything. Mommy and
[1:23:17] daddy will do everything. They're going
[1:23:20] to lose altitude real fast, right? But
[1:23:23] they can hear mama scream, "Flop your
[1:23:25] wings on. Flop them wings. Get that Old
[1:23:29] Testament and New Testament flying."
[1:23:31] Right? That those wings are the Old
[1:23:33] Testament and the New Testament. Get
[1:23:36] them working together. Sometimes we're
[1:23:38] like this. We're just, oh, I I'm just
[1:23:41] about the mysteries and Revelation.
[1:23:42] That's it. You're just you're just
[1:23:44] flying with one. Come on now. There's a
[1:23:47] balance. Genesis to Revelations. Let's
[1:23:50] take it together. When you work
[1:23:52] together, Genesis to Revelations, you're
[1:23:54] going to soar. Hallelujah.
[1:23:58] Hallelujah. Amen. You've got the wings,
[1:24:00] son. Fly.
[1:24:03] Oh, daughter, just just try it. Give
[1:24:05] Give those wings a flap. I know it's in
[1:24:08] you. Oh, and he says, "If there ever was
[1:24:10] a time that the church needs to do some
[1:24:12] flopping, it's now." The little eagles
[1:24:14] are not wearied because they're
[1:24:15] altogether aware. She just flies down,
[1:24:18] swoops right under them, and oh,
[1:24:19] sometimes we we're just, "Oh, they don't
[1:24:21] know what's happening, and they're just
[1:24:22] dropping, dropping, dropping, dropping."
[1:24:24] What does she do? She swoops right under
[1:24:26] them, picks them up, and brings them
[1:24:27] back into grace again.
[1:24:30] How many's experienced that? Oh,
[1:24:33] sometimes, friends, we just, oh, we we
[1:24:34] don't even know which way is up or down,
[1:24:36] which way is left or right. We're like
[1:24:38] Job. I go forward, I don't find him. I
[1:24:40] go back, I don't find him. Left, right,
[1:24:41] I don't find him. Oh, but then he just
[1:24:43] she swoops down and picks us up and
[1:24:45] brings us back into grace again.
[1:24:48] Hallelujah. Oh, so don't be afraid of
[1:24:50] fanaticism or while our mother is
[1:24:52] watching over us. She makes those
[1:24:54] circles and is she fast, you should see
[1:24:56] her. And the thing of it is she can pick
[1:24:58] as many up. If a little fellow is
[1:25:00] exhausted, just turning over and over
[1:25:02] and over and can't catch his breath, she
[1:25:04] can catch one with a foot, the other
[1:25:05] with another foot, catching her mouth.
[1:25:07] Oh, the little eagles are so carefree.
[1:25:11] My I love that. Hallelujah. That's his
[1:25:15] attitude. You know what? I didn't read
[1:25:17] anything about him worrying or that
[1:25:19] eagle mama worrying or getting getting
[1:25:22] upset at them or impatient with them.
[1:25:24] No, I see a determination. They're going
[1:25:27] to fly. They're going to fly.
[1:25:30] Hallelujah. That's God's attitude
[1:25:32] towards you, friends. You're going to
[1:25:33] fly. You're going to be an overcomer.
[1:25:36] You're going to fulfill the word that I
[1:25:39] spoke of you in this day. And I'm going
[1:25:41] to bring you from a terrestrial
[1:25:44] to an extraterrestrial. Amen.
[1:25:46] Hallelujah. Amen. We're not meant,
[1:25:49] friends, to stay as as some caterpillar,
[1:25:51] right? You know, cuz the caterpillar,
[1:25:53] oh, it's walking. It's just eating.
[1:25:55] It just eats and eats and eats. That's
[1:25:57] what you got to do. It just goes on the
[1:25:58] leaf and eats and eats and eats. And
[1:26:00] then it comes into a secret place into
[1:26:02] that little room. Whoa. I like that. the
[1:26:05] little room of the cocoon and
[1:26:07] something's going on. Oh, you know, you
[1:26:09] know that that vision, right? The 10
[1:26:10] vision. Amen. That woman come in, she
[1:26:12] was crippled or what? On the stretcher
[1:26:14] and she come out of that little room.
[1:26:15] Oh, she was praising God. Oh,
[1:26:17] hallelujah. What happened? I don't know.
[1:26:20] But all I know is I was lame and I come
[1:26:22] out well in that cocoon. What's
[1:26:25] happening? It's changing. It's changing
[1:26:28] from glory to glory, from one form to
[1:26:31] another. What's happening now? Amen.
[1:26:33] There's a process going on.
[1:26:35] Metamorphosis, amen. And you're going to
[1:26:37] go from a terrestrial, amen, to an
[1:26:39] extraterrestrial, from a earthly to a
[1:26:42] heavenly. From mortality to immortality,
[1:26:45] from corruption to incorruption. That's
[1:26:47] your promise. I say yes, Lord.
[1:26:51] Hallelujah.
[1:26:55] You know, and let me let me just drop
[1:26:57] this in real quick, you know, because
[1:26:59] Amen. There's not a ton of young people
[1:27:00] here or whatever, but there are some
[1:27:01] kids. And I'll say this, parents, I
[1:27:04] mean, I just encourage you friends.
[1:27:05] Amen. You know, you want your kids to
[1:27:08] fly high, right? Spiritually, I'm
[1:27:10] talking about. Amen. Then watch your
[1:27:12] attitude.
[1:27:14] Because watch what the prophet says.
[1:27:16] Your attitude, he's talking about the
[1:27:18] parents, towards Christ will make a
[1:27:20] great impression on what your children
[1:27:23] will be.
[1:27:25] Your attitude towards what? Towards the
[1:27:27] word, towards the pastor, towards the
[1:27:31] ministry.
[1:27:33] Amen.
[1:27:35] Your life that you live before your
[1:27:37] family will make an impression on what
[1:27:40] your children will be. You see those
[1:27:41] eagles, they watch mama. Wow, I want to
[1:27:44] be like mama.
[1:27:46] I just see her come in. I see how she
[1:27:48] gets that salmon. I see how she just
[1:27:50] rips with her big. Oh, how that's that's
[1:27:52] what I want to be. You see, and when
[1:27:55] your kids see, oh, how they get so
[1:27:57] excited when the word is coming forth.
[1:27:58] That's what I want to be. There's power
[1:28:00] there. There's strength there. That's
[1:28:02] what I want. But when they see bickering
[1:28:04] and complaining and bad attitude here
[1:28:06] and bad attitude towards this person,
[1:28:07] bad attitude towards that family, they
[1:28:09] don't want that.
[1:28:13] I hope that's okay. But that's nothing
[1:28:15] but the truth.
[1:28:18] Hallelujah.
[1:28:20] Now, let's look at some scriptural
[1:28:21] examples if we could
[1:28:25] quickly. You know, when you look at
[1:28:26] Solomon, right? When Solomon was first
[1:28:30] crowned king, you would you you know,
[1:28:32] you would say, well, he was in line to
[1:28:33] be king, right? He was the son of David,
[1:28:35] but when he came, he was a young man.
[1:28:38] And the and the spirit of God, right? Or
[1:28:40] God come to him in a dream. You all know
[1:28:42] the story, right? and and said, "What
[1:28:45] would you like? What would you have me
[1:28:46] give you, Solomon?" Now, someone who's
[1:28:49] just come into power, someone who God
[1:28:50] has elevated into a position, sometimes
[1:28:53] we what you know what we see is an
[1:28:55] arrogance,
[1:28:56] right? Well, now everybody's got to
[1:28:58] listen to me. I'm in charge now. You got
[1:29:01] to listen to me cuz I got everything
[1:29:03] under control. I can do it. I There's a
[1:29:06] reason why I was chosen. All these kind
[1:29:08] of attitudes, right? Amen. But watch
[1:29:10] Solomon. Amen. You know, God says, "What
[1:29:13] would I?" He says, "Who am I? I'm not
[1:29:15] I'm but a little child." See, the
[1:29:18] humility, the attitude of humility. I'm
[1:29:20] but a child. And and I I how can I rule
[1:29:23] such a great people as this people?
[1:29:26] Give me wisdom. Give me an understanding
[1:29:29] heart to to to judge righteous judgment.
[1:29:33] And that so please God. That attitude of
[1:29:35] humility. that I that's why we read at
[1:29:38] the beginning, humble yourselves in the
[1:29:40] sight of God and he will raise you up.
[1:29:42] You see, brother Brown talks about, you
[1:29:44] know, that preacher that come up to the
[1:29:45] pulpit and he just come out with his
[1:29:47] chest out and his Bible under his arm
[1:29:48] because he had a PhD or whatever, right?
[1:29:50] And he come and it seemed like the the
[1:29:52] crowd wasn't really accepting what he
[1:29:54] was preaching and he gone down like
[1:29:55] this. And brother Bram said if he would
[1:29:58] have gone up the way he came down, it
[1:29:59] would have went a lot better. You see,
[1:30:02] because if we just humble ourselves, God
[1:30:04] will raise us up. If we raise ourselves
[1:30:07] up, God will obease us. He has a great
[1:30:09] way of humbling us. How many have ever
[1:30:12] experienced that? Oh, I can do this. I
[1:30:15] can do that. And it's a flop.
[1:30:20] Yes, I've had that before. Amen. You
[1:30:23] just think you can do it, right? I can
[1:30:25] do nothing.
[1:30:28] I can do nothing outside of him,
[1:30:30] friends. Especially this, friends. I can
[1:30:32] I I have nothing to give him. Amen.
[1:30:34] about this body. Amen. I say, Lord, just
[1:30:37] help me to yield. Help me to yield. My
[1:30:39] prayer this morning, Lord, help me to
[1:30:41] yield that something can be said that
[1:30:43] will help somebody.
[1:30:46] Hallelujah.
[1:30:49] But you know what? Amen. Solomon's
[1:30:50] kingdom. Amen. It became, oh, what? Look
[1:30:53] at look at his attitude. Amen. Caused
[1:30:56] that kingdom to soar, right? Oh, into
[1:30:59] God gave him wealth. God gave him
[1:31:01] riches. God gave him prestige. God gave
[1:31:04] him wisdom. All these things. Amen. His
[1:31:06] fame was known around the world. Queen
[1:31:07] of Sheba came. All these ones come to
[1:31:09] hear his wisdom. Amen. So God gave him
[1:31:11] all these things. And oh, it was like a
[1:31:13] millennial reign, right? Peace, no war,
[1:31:16] peace. Oh, and until until
[1:31:21] his attitude changed. And I'll present
[1:31:23] it to you this way is that Solomon took
[1:31:25] on a leadyan attitude.
[1:31:28] I'm rich. I'm increased with goods. Look
[1:31:31] at my chariots. Look at my horsemen.
[1:31:33] Look at this. Look at that. Look at the
[1:31:35] temple.
[1:31:38] Look at our church. I'm in the message.
[1:31:41] Look at my family. Look, oh, I'm rich.
[1:31:45] I'm increased with goods. I don't have I
[1:31:47] don't have to listen to the preacher say
[1:31:48] that about about my life. I don't have
[1:31:50] to hear I don't have to submit this and
[1:31:52] that.
[1:31:54] Oh my. And he began to think, I I don't
[1:31:57] need to be as fervent as I needed before
[1:31:58] because I'm just I'm in the I I I was
[1:32:00] born again. Amen. And I've had an
[1:32:02] experience with God. Amen. I don't have
[1:32:04] to be fervent. I don't have to have a
[1:32:05] prayer life like I used to.
[1:32:08] You see, because Solomon, you ask
[1:32:10] Solomon, Solomon, do you believe in God,
[1:32:12] the one true God? Yes, absolutely.
[1:32:16] Oh, but we find him worshiping at the
[1:32:18] altar of of Chimosh or whatever is a
[1:32:20] molec.
[1:32:23] Oh, he's appeasing his wives. Wives of
[1:32:26] what?
[1:32:28] Amen. You put your you put whatever you
[1:32:30] want in there. Entertainment,
[1:32:32] worldliness, fashion,
[1:32:35] work, the almighty dollar, those wives.
[1:32:40] Oh, is this okay? Amen. Brother Brandham
[1:32:43] said, "Oh, we would never say, "Oh, I'm
[1:32:44] not a prostitute."
[1:32:47] Brother Brown said, "You can prostitute
[1:32:49] more than just your body.
[1:32:52] You can prostitute your time. You can
[1:32:54] prostitute this and prostitute that."
[1:32:56] Friends, we're all guilty of that. Amen.
[1:32:58] And so I'm encouraging you as we close
[1:32:59] out 2024, friends, is that we not lose
[1:33:02] our focus. Don't let our attitude not
[1:33:05] take on a scene attitude of
[1:33:07] satisfaction.
[1:33:10] Cuz God has given us so much. He has
[1:33:13] given us riches beyond what we could
[1:33:15] imagine of the riches of God's word, the
[1:33:18] riches of revelation. But don't get
[1:33:20] satisfied on that, friends, on a past
[1:33:22] experience.
[1:33:24] Because Solomon had many, many past
[1:33:26] experience. I built the temple. I did
[1:33:28] this. I did that. Oh, I And he did
[1:33:32] through God. Oh, I judged righteously
[1:33:34] with those two women. I had such wisdom.
[1:33:36] Oh, I wrote the book of Proverbs. I
[1:33:39] wrote this. I did that. Oh, past
[1:33:41] experiences.
[1:33:43] But how high are you flying today?
[1:33:46] Oh, I used to fly in the heavenlies. I
[1:33:49] used to have such joy. Oh, I used to be
[1:33:52] able to forgive.
[1:33:55] Why? But why not now? Why can't we fly
[1:33:57] higher?
[1:34:00] I'm just challenging you this morning,
[1:34:02] friends. Where are you at? What's your
[1:34:03] altitude? What's your attitude indicator
[1:34:05] saying this morning? Oh, there's a lot
[1:34:07] of earth there. There's a lot of world
[1:34:09] there. Change that attitude.
[1:34:12] Say, God, give me some thrust of the
[1:34:15] Holy Ghost. Amen. And turn my turn my
[1:34:18] the position on my air on my wings to
[1:34:20] catch on to that faith and move a little
[1:34:22] higher. Change my attitude towards the
[1:34:25] things of God. Change my attitude
[1:34:27] towards the things of the Lord.
[1:34:30] Hallelujah.
[1:34:33] What about Esther? You know Esther, she
[1:34:36] was not born into royalty. She was a she
[1:34:39] was an orphan. She wouldn't have
[1:34:41] expected to become the queen. But God
[1:34:44] had predestinated her. Does that sound
[1:34:46] familiar?
[1:34:48] No one would have thought you that would
[1:34:50] be the bride of Christ. But God had
[1:34:52] predestined. He had already thought of
[1:34:54] you being his wife. But watch this. We
[1:34:57] won't go through the entire story, but I
[1:34:58] want you to notice Esther's attitude,
[1:35:01] right? In Esther chapter 2. And and
[1:35:04] compared to the other virgins, they were
[1:35:07] virgins that came with Esther, right? So
[1:35:10] it came to pass when the king's
[1:35:11] commandment that his decree was heard
[1:35:13] and when many maidens were gathered
[1:35:15] together unto Shushan the palace to the
[1:35:17] custody of Hagi. So notice now they come
[1:35:21] into the custody of Haggi and I know
[1:35:24] Haggi can be typed different ways but
[1:35:26] let me type it this way right I can
[1:35:28] imagine as they come in and Hagi
[1:35:30] standing there they might have said I'm
[1:35:32] not saying they said this but they might
[1:35:33] have said sisters this is your pastor
[1:35:39] let's just type it that way okay this
[1:35:41] morning he is going to tell you how to
[1:35:44] prepare to meet the king
[1:35:47] I know it can be typed brother around
[1:35:48] you. Don't get me wrong. I'm not
[1:35:49] minimizing anything. I'm just making a
[1:35:51] type, a shadow. But some of them, most
[1:35:54] of them, everybody else said, "I don't
[1:35:57] need that.
[1:35:59] I don't need to listen to a guy. Whoa,
[1:36:02] look at that." They were looking at all
[1:36:03] the jewelry. Oh, I can wear that. Oh,
[1:36:06] look at that skirt. Oh, look at that
[1:36:08] necklace. Oh, and hey guy would say,
[1:36:10] "Hey, the king don't like that.
[1:36:14] The king's not into that." Ah, what does
[1:36:16] he know? What does he know? I read the
[1:36:18] message. I I I have all 1100, 1200,
[1:36:21] 1400, whatever it is. I mean, messages
[1:36:23] on my phone. I can read it myself. I can
[1:36:25] get into the message myself. You need
[1:36:27] the ministry. We all do.
[1:36:30] God gave the gifts. When he ascended on
[1:36:33] high, he sent down gifts. They're gifts.
[1:36:38] I'm not elevating anybody. God did it
[1:36:41] for what? Oh, just just to be a just
[1:36:44] just to press play. No. Oh, ju just just
[1:36:47] to form time or fill time on a Sunday
[1:36:49] morning or on a Wednesday night or
[1:36:50] whatever. No, for the perfecting for the
[1:36:53] maturing of the saints for the
[1:36:56] edification for the for the work of the
[1:36:58] ministry. Until
[1:37:00] until we have all the knowledge. No,
[1:37:02] until Yeah. Until we come into the
[1:37:04] fullness, amen. Of the I can't you know
[1:37:06] the you know the the scripture. I'm bad
[1:37:08] at quoting scripture there, but you know
[1:37:09] what I'm talking about. Ephesians
[1:37:10] chapter 4:11. So God amen. Put that in
[1:37:13] the place. Amen. And so they said,
[1:37:15] "Well, we don't need that. I I know how
[1:37:17] to dress myself."
[1:37:20] Well, Esther didn't have that attitude.
[1:37:24] Esther had a different attitude. She
[1:37:26] said, "I'll listen to you, Haggi.
[1:37:29] I'll sit under you, Haggi. I'll sit
[1:37:31] under the ministry. I'll follow what's
[1:37:34] preached." Are you with me?
[1:37:38] Oh. And brother Bram says, "That's the
[1:37:40] bride of Christ." Esther was to become a
[1:37:42] bride. So she didn't want none of the
[1:37:44] adorning of the world. She wanted to go
[1:37:46] into the king just like she was. She
[1:37:48] adorned themselves like the Pentecostal
[1:37:51] women ought to but with a meek, humble
[1:37:55] spirit.
[1:37:57] Now sometimes we think, "Oh, that's just
[1:38:00] meek." No. What are we meek and humble
[1:38:03] to? To the word.
[1:38:06] That's what we're meek and humble to is
[1:38:08] the word. Oh, people think, "Oh, I'm so
[1:38:09] pious. Oh, you know the gentle priest."
[1:38:12] know that that ain't meekness because
[1:38:13] you face them with the word. Yeah,
[1:38:14] that's nothing. That's not true. It's
[1:38:17] three gods. It's a trinity. You don't
[1:38:19] have to know. See, but we always say,
[1:38:21] "Oh, that's the truth." Now, watch. I I
[1:38:23] don't want to get ahead of myself here,
[1:38:25] but watch this. When all these fancy
[1:38:27] first ladies come by with all their new
[1:38:28] fandango things, the king looked at them
[1:38:31] and put them in the chamber with the
[1:38:32] concubines. In other words, why? They
[1:38:34] weren't bride material.
[1:38:37] Can I say it this way? Their attitude
[1:38:39] disgusted him.
[1:38:41] because he could feel their attitude was
[1:38:43] all about themselves,
[1:38:45] all about what they could produce, their
[1:38:47] program, their church, their
[1:38:49] denomination.
[1:38:51] Yeah. But watch this. But when Esther
[1:38:54] come, he got a glimpse of that sweet,
[1:38:56] humble, meek spirit. Remember to the
[1:38:59] word. He said, "That's her. That's her.
[1:39:03] That's her. That's her. That's her.
[1:39:06] That's her." Hello, Esther.
[1:39:09] Amen. Go get the crown and put it on her
[1:39:12] head. That's it. Let them adorn
[1:39:13] themselves with that kind of a spirit.
[1:39:15] Not only the women, but the men, too.
[1:39:18] Adorn themselves with that kind of a
[1:39:20] spirit. Then you're becoming ready for
[1:39:22] the bride. Sweet Reverend Esther made
[1:39:25] her heart clean.
[1:39:27] Amen. So he said, "Now when the turn of
[1:39:29] Esther came, Esther 2:15, the daughter
[1:39:31] of Abel, the uncle of Mori, who had
[1:39:33] taken her for his daughter, was come to
[1:39:35] go into the king. She required nothing
[1:39:37] but what? Hagi the king's chamberlain,
[1:39:40] the keeper of the women appointed.
[1:39:43] And Esther obtained favor.
[1:39:47] I'm looking at the one, friends, that
[1:39:49] has obtained favor. Oh, the world looks
[1:39:52] at you. Ah, what's that?
[1:39:56] That ain't nothing to that. Where's the
[1:39:58] big building? Where's the robe choir?
[1:40:00] Where's this? And where's the program
[1:40:01] for the young people? Where's the
[1:40:02] program for the youth? And where's the
[1:40:04] program for the married women?
[1:40:07] We're we're we're we're doing the
[1:40:09] program right now
[1:40:11] by the foolishness of preaching.
[1:40:14] Souls will be saved.
[1:40:17] Oh, watch this. And and the king loved
[1:40:19] Esther above all the women. And she
[1:40:21] obtained grace and favor in his sight
[1:40:23] more than all the virgins. So that he
[1:40:26] said, and I love this because brother
[1:40:28] Brown said, "There will be brides,
[1:40:30] brides, churches, churches, brides,
[1:40:32] brides, but there'll only be one."
[1:40:34] I'm looking at her. I'm looking at her
[1:40:37] friends. Oh, there's Pentecostal Church
[1:40:38] and Presbyterian Church. And nothing
[1:40:40] wrong with the people, friends. They are
[1:40:41] wonderful people. But the system,
[1:40:44] friends, God has rejected because they
[1:40:46] why he said they wouldn't take on a
[1:40:48] further part of the word. Is that right?
[1:40:52] They would not go on further with the
[1:40:54] word to be pregnant. Oh my. But friends,
[1:40:58] our womb is open. It's actually if if we
[1:41:00] would just open up our hearts, it would
[1:41:01] be sealed and no other seed, no other
[1:41:05] man's idea can come in and pollute it.
[1:41:09] Glory be to God.
[1:41:12] Look at her ascension friends. So he
[1:41:14] sent the royal crown upon her head and
[1:41:16] made her queen instead of Ashtai. Look
[1:41:19] at her ascension friends. Amen. By her
[1:41:22] attitude of submission, humility,
[1:41:25] reverence, she'd become the queen.
[1:41:29] Humble yourselves in the sight of the
[1:41:31] Lord and he will lift you up. See your
[1:41:33] attitude. If it pleased the king, if it
[1:41:36] pleased the king, if it pleased the
[1:41:37] king. Finally, the king said, "You
[1:41:39] please me. You please me.
[1:41:42] Whatever you want to do, whatever you
[1:41:44] want to say, take take the pen, write
[1:41:46] the law.
[1:41:48] Glory be to God." And what did she do,
[1:41:51] friend? She wrote a new law. Because
[1:41:54] there was an old law of sin and death
[1:41:57] that Hmon, the devil, had written to
[1:41:59] destroy us all. Hallelujah. Amen. But
[1:42:02] Esther, oh, pen it right. Oh, there's a
[1:42:05] new law you can fight. You can fight.
[1:42:08] Defend yourself. God is giving you the
[1:42:11] word. He's giving you the sword of the
[1:42:12] spirit, which is the word of God. No,
[1:42:15] don't only put it in your hand. Put it
[1:42:17] in your mouth. Put it in your mouth.
[1:42:19] Amen. Say, "That's the truth. God is my
[1:42:21] healer. God is my savior. God is my
[1:42:24] deliverer. God is my joy. God is my
[1:42:26] peace. I speak it. I heard it spoken
[1:42:29] today." We speak healing. Amen. Into our
[1:42:31] brother's body. We speak Amen. We speak
[1:42:34] an anointing into this church. Amen. Of
[1:42:36] a of a power. Amen. To overcome and be
[1:42:39] what God wants you to be.
[1:42:42] Attitude determines altitude. Now, let
[1:42:45] me look at two more women and just try
[1:42:47] tie this together with the Lord's help.
[1:42:48] and we'll close. But there was a woman
[1:42:50] in the New Testament, friend. She wasn't
[1:42:52] a Jew. She was a Gentile. But she had a
[1:42:56] need and she knew that Jesus could meet
[1:42:58] that need. Amen. You know who I'm
[1:43:00] talking about. Amen. She come, Amen,
[1:43:02] with this, if I could say it, an
[1:43:04] attitude of this bulldog faith. But yet,
[1:43:07] she come with an attitude of submission.
[1:43:09] Now, you wonder, how could that be? But
[1:43:10] watch this. Amen. She had a need. Amen.
[1:43:12] She was the Sarapheneician woman. Amen.
[1:43:14] Her daughter was grievously vexed with a
[1:43:16] demon. Amen. and and and and she come
[1:43:19] and she seen Jesus. And so she cried
[1:43:21] out. She said, "Son of David, have mercy
[1:43:24] on me." And Jesus just kept walking,
[1:43:27] right? He just kept walking. He didn't
[1:43:29] pay her attention. He didn't get he
[1:43:31] didn't So she yelled louder, "Son of
[1:43:33] David," he just kept walking. The more
[1:43:35] he ignored her, the louder she screamed.
[1:43:40] She had an attitude. I'm I'm not going
[1:43:42] to be denied. You know, we sing that
[1:43:44] song, I will not be denied till Jesus
[1:43:46] comes and makes me whole. I will not be
[1:43:48] denied. She just kept knocking, son of
[1:43:50] David. She had no understanding. He
[1:43:53] wasn't the son of David yet, right? But
[1:43:56] she was crying out. Finally, his
[1:43:57] disciples said, "Jesus, would you just
[1:43:59] turn her away? Send her away. She's
[1:44:01] getting on our nerves. Her voice is real
[1:44:03] screechy, actually." Amen. Just she's
[1:44:05] annoyed all of us. So Jesus turns around
[1:44:08] and you know what he said? In other
[1:44:09] words, he said, "I'm not sent to your
[1:44:10] current. It's not right. I'm I'm not
[1:44:14] sent but to the lost sheep of Israel. In
[1:44:16] other words, you're the wrong race.
[1:44:21] My If it was in this day, there would be
[1:44:22] a riot. There would be looting. All
[1:44:25] sorts of stuff like that. Oh yeah. Oh,
[1:44:28] now now she's What did she say? She
[1:44:30] said, "Lord, help me." Oh, that caught
[1:44:34] his attention.
[1:44:35] He wasn't son of David. He wasn't sent
[1:44:38] to her race, but he was her Lord.
[1:44:41] Lord, help me.
[1:44:44] Oh, he she's going to get what she wants
[1:44:46] now, right? Oh, she's going to get it.
[1:44:49] He said, "It's not meat to take the
[1:44:51] children's bread and feed it to dogs."
[1:44:53] In other words, you're a racist dogs.
[1:44:55] You're just dogs.
[1:44:58] My goodness,
[1:45:00] my if a preacher come and called you a
[1:45:02] dog
[1:45:05] my How did she keep her right attitude?
[1:45:08] But she did. What does she say? Truth,
[1:45:11] Lord. That's the truth. I am a dog, but
[1:45:16] the dogs eat the crumbs.
[1:45:19] Oh, glory be to God. I wonder if we
[1:45:23] could have that attitude this morning,
[1:45:24] friends. Amen. Even if the word would
[1:45:26] just come and cut us. Oh, and even
[1:45:28] offend us if it's the truth. Yeah,
[1:45:33] that's the truth. You're right. I need
[1:45:36] to get right. I ain't been living right.
[1:45:40] That's nothing but the truth, Lord.
[1:45:43] Oh, something's going to happen.
[1:45:45] Hallelujah. Oh, but the cornal mind
[1:45:47] would say, "Submit to that racist.
[1:45:51] Humble yourself to that misogynist." You
[1:45:53] know all the words that they use
[1:45:54] nowadays? You how how could you worship
[1:45:58] him? But she had the right attitude.
[1:46:01] She had the right attitude. Oh, truth.
[1:46:04] Lord, you're right. And watch Brother
[1:46:06] Brandham, right? He takes that instance,
[1:46:08] right, and preaches, I think, 11 times
[1:46:10] on perseverance. Persever pers
[1:46:13] perseverant. Perseverance. Persever. He
[1:46:15] takes her character. She's not even a
[1:46:17] Jew. She's a gentile. And a prophet of
[1:46:19] God would take her character and preach
[1:46:22] about her. How we are to approach our
[1:46:24] approach, our attitude. Right at the
[1:46:27] beginning, it's our approach. It's our
[1:46:29] attitude. Amen. And here she come with
[1:46:32] an attitude. Amen. that wasn't going to
[1:46:34] be denied. But she come with reverence.
[1:46:37] She come with respect.
[1:46:40] And brother Brandon would say, "God
[1:46:41] demands respects." Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:46:45] Truth, Lord. And he and he says in
[1:46:47] perseverance, she had the right approach
[1:46:49] to God's gift. Faith. Faith admits the
[1:46:54] word is right.
[1:46:56] Reverent. Humble. I'm seeing a pattern
[1:46:58] here. Esther, the Saphenician woman,
[1:47:01] reverent, humble. And she come
[1:47:03] reverently, peacefully, reverently,
[1:47:06] humbly. You got to be humble. The way up
[1:47:08] is down always. He that humbles himself
[1:47:10] shall be exalted. He that exaltth
[1:47:12] himself shall be a base. Now watch. She
[1:47:14] admitted the real true faith. Always
[1:47:17] admits the word is right. Now watch.
[1:47:20] Always admitting the word is right.
[1:47:22] Truth, Lord. I'm nothing but a dog.
[1:47:26] You wasn't sent to my race. That is the
[1:47:28] truth. My
[1:47:33] this would not be a popular in Leadyia.
[1:47:38] She didn't want to see what this was or
[1:47:40] that was. She just admitted that the
[1:47:41] word was right. And the spirit of faith
[1:47:44] always admits the word is right.
[1:47:48] You see our her attitude was you're
[1:47:50] right, Lord. That's why people get hard
[1:47:53] don't hardly get anywhere with God
[1:47:55] because they think they're right.
[1:47:57] Are you with me? Amen. They think
[1:48:00] they're right. I know the word says but.
[1:48:03] No, there's no ifs, ends, or buts about
[1:48:04] the word of God. It's yay and amen. His
[1:48:08] word is the truth.
[1:48:10] Period.
[1:48:12] With that kind of attitude, watch her
[1:48:14] watch her altitude rise. You see
[1:48:16] friends, oh it that attitude. Amen. She
[1:48:19] come with the right attitude. And and
[1:48:21] finally Jesus said, "Oh woman,
[1:48:24] great is thy faith. Great is thy faith.
[1:48:28] be it unto thee
[1:48:31] even as thou wilt. Oh my man, I I'm
[1:48:35] seeing patterns here. God could have
[1:48:38] said that to Esther. Oh, great is thy
[1:48:40] faith. Be it unto thee according as thou
[1:48:42] wilt. I will that my house be saved.
[1:48:45] Can we apply that?
[1:48:48] Oh, hallelujah. She sword, friends, that
[1:48:52] Sarapheneician women woman soared. Now
[1:48:55] let's connect it to another woman,
[1:48:56] another gentile, but another gentile in
[1:48:59] our age, Sister Hadtie, right? What was
[1:49:02] her attitude towards the word? What was
[1:49:04] her attitude towards, Amen, the
[1:49:06] testimony that Brother Brandham gave of
[1:49:09] those squirrels?
[1:49:10] Because friends, I can show you another
[1:49:12] example of a brother that was with
[1:49:14] brother Brandham, hunting with brother
[1:49:16] Brandham, seeing a couple of the
[1:49:18] squirrels. His name was Brother Tony,
[1:49:21] right? And the one time, I can't
[1:49:23] remember which time it was because there
[1:49:24] was a couple times, right, where brother
[1:49:26] Brandham spoke squirrels, right? It
[1:49:28] wasn't just one time, but one of those
[1:49:30] times he couldn't find the third one.
[1:49:32] How many remember the story? He found
[1:49:35] the two, but it was getting dark. He
[1:49:36] couldn't find the third one. So, he come
[1:49:37] back to camp and this brother had some
[1:49:40] doubt
[1:49:42] in his mind. He didn't have the right
[1:49:43] attitude towards the gift of God,
[1:49:48] right? And so they ask him to pray and
[1:49:50] he says, "Lord, let brother Brandham
[1:49:52] find that squirrel tomorrow so that we
[1:49:54] can believe that what he's saying is the
[1:49:56] truth."
[1:49:58] Wrong attitude.
[1:50:00] But what about sister Hattie, right? She
[1:50:03] wasn't there. She never went hunting
[1:50:04] with brother Brandham. She never seen
[1:50:06] any squirrels.
[1:50:08] But as soon as brother Baron said, "Oh,
[1:50:10] the same God that created a ram for
[1:50:14] Abraham there on Mount Mariah is the
[1:50:16] same God that spoke to my lips and
[1:50:19] created those squirrels. He's still
[1:50:21] Jehovah Gyra." And let me say this
[1:50:24] morning, he's still Jehovah Gyra. The
[1:50:27] same God that was on Namariah was the
[1:50:29] same God that was with a prophet. In the
[1:50:31] words, he's the same God that's in a
[1:50:34] building. Amen. A restored word
[1:50:35] fellowship. He's still Jehovah Gyra.
[1:50:38] He's still Jehovah Rafa. He's still
[1:50:40] Jehovah Shaoo.
[1:50:42] Oh, all these things. The seven
[1:50:43] redemptive names of Jesus Christ of
[1:50:45] Jehovah. He's still the same yesterday,
[1:50:47] today, and forever.
[1:50:49] Our attitude towards it. What is our
[1:50:51] attitude towards that? That's nothing
[1:50:53] but the truth. Sister Hadtie said,
[1:50:55] right? Amen. When brother Brandham said
[1:50:57] that, what does she say? That's nothing
[1:50:58] but the truth. Brother Brandham. Amen.
[1:51:01] And my the Holy Ghost come into that pro
[1:51:03] into that room. Brother man said the
[1:51:05] greatest I've never felt that anointing
[1:51:07] before like that. Let me read it to you.
[1:51:10] Watch this. She said that's nothing but
[1:51:12] the truth. She said the right thing.
[1:51:15] What if her attitude had been skeptical?
[1:51:17] What if it had bunda? How that sounds
[1:51:19] kind of farfetched, brother R. She would
[1:51:20] have never got what she got that day,
[1:51:23] which was of eternal value.
[1:51:26] Watch this. And that super anointing
[1:51:29] swept over me. I said, "Tell Hadtie that
[1:51:32] she's found grace in the sight of God."
[1:51:34] Who would have thought?
[1:51:38] Who would have thought, Sister Haddie,
[1:51:39] right?
[1:51:41] My I was just watching it the other day
[1:51:43] here. How many Anybody ever heard of
[1:51:45] Brother Kenny Caps?
[1:51:47] Anybody know Brother Kenny Caps? Brother
[1:51:49] Kenny Caps is a messenger message
[1:51:51] believer. He preaches the message in the
[1:51:53] States, but he grew up in Brandham
[1:51:55] Tabernacle. And he gives a testimony of
[1:51:57] Sister Hadtie, Wright. You know what his
[1:52:00] testimony was? She was kind of strange.
[1:52:03] She was kind of a strange lady.
[1:52:05] She was different. You know what he
[1:52:07] said? She wasn't much to look at.
[1:52:10] He's just his as a kid. He was a kid and
[1:52:13] she was a sister in the church. He said
[1:52:15] she had long hair, but she didn't bother
[1:52:17] making it up like doing it right.
[1:52:20] She just kind of put it up and it just
[1:52:22] looked like a nest of hay. That's what
[1:52:24] he said.
[1:52:26] And she had missing teeth. I'm talking
[1:52:28] about friends because I'm saying this
[1:52:30] for a reason because sometime because he
[1:52:32] said as kids we were kind of scared of
[1:52:34] her. We didn't we want to we wanted to
[1:52:36] stay away from he was he was friends
[1:52:37] with the boys. This is brother candy
[1:52:39] caps but he didn't want he was kind of
[1:52:41] scared of her of their mom. We didn't
[1:52:43] want to be around her. He said we stayed
[1:52:45] away from her. So they never thought
[1:52:47] that's why I'm who would have thought
[1:52:51] the natural eye because sometimes we
[1:52:53] judge right oh that that that person God
[1:52:56] will do something in their life but the
[1:52:58] person comes in they don't bother to do
[1:52:59] their hair and maybe they have a little
[1:53:01] bit of bo and things like that we just
[1:53:05] right who would have thought who would
[1:53:08] have thought that sister had right would
[1:53:10] be the first human being that the third
[1:53:13] pull would be performed on
[1:53:16] Am I talking to somebody this morning?
[1:53:18] You might think, "Oh, nobody wants to
[1:53:19] have anything to do with me. Nobody
[1:53:21] thinks of me." God thinks something of
[1:53:23] you. God thinks something of you. Oh,
[1:53:25] we're just this little church in
[1:53:26] Edmonton. No, God thinks something of
[1:53:28] you.
[1:53:30] Hallelujah. Hello, Hattie. Right. If we
[1:53:33] can just have the right attitude towards
[1:53:35] God's word, that's nothing but the
[1:53:36] truth, Lord. Oh, it hurts, but that's
[1:53:38] nothing but the truth. Oh, said tell her
[1:53:41] to ask whatever she will. Then you speak
[1:53:43] it by this gift into existence. Whatever
[1:53:45] she asks, speak it into existence. I
[1:53:47] looked to sister Hattie, the first time
[1:53:49] ever performed on a human being, I said,
[1:53:51] "Sister Hattie, ask what you will. God
[1:53:54] is going to give it to you."
[1:53:57] Amen. Who would think? Who would have
[1:53:59] thought? And I say this morning, who
[1:54:01] would have thought this little church in
[1:54:05] Edmonton, who would have thought that
[1:54:07] God would visit?
[1:54:10] He bypassed all the other churches
[1:54:11] around here and come this morning,
[1:54:15] December 29th, 2024, to come visit you
[1:54:19] and speak to you.
[1:54:22] Hallelujah. I believe I'm speaking to
[1:54:24] sister Hattie writes this morning.
[1:54:27] Hallelujah. With the right attitude,
[1:54:28] saying the right thing. You're saying,
[1:54:30] "Amen." Oh, that's nothing but the
[1:54:32] truth. So be it. My question is, what's
[1:54:35] your attitude towards the word that's
[1:54:37] been spoken even this morning? That's
[1:54:39] nothing but the truth. That's right.
[1:54:41] You're right, Lord. Not my word. Your
[1:54:43] right, Lord. Your word is true.
[1:54:47] Hallelujah. Can I give you one more
[1:54:48] example as we close the Roman soldiers,
[1:54:51] right, that that that handled Jesus. Oh,
[1:54:53] they they arrested him. They beat him.
[1:54:56] They they robbed him with that scarlet
[1:54:58] robe, that purple robe. Oh, they touched
[1:55:00] him. They put on the crown of thorns.
[1:55:01] They were laughing and mocking him. They
[1:55:02] swed him. All these things. They touched
[1:55:04] him but they didn't get any virtue from
[1:55:07] him. Zero. Zero virtue. There was all
[1:55:11] this virtue in him but they got zero.
[1:55:13] But a little woman, humble woman with a
[1:55:16] blood issue. All she touched was the hem
[1:55:18] of his garment and she drew virtue.
[1:55:22] Why? Brother Brandon says it's your
[1:55:24] attitude. What kind of an environment
[1:55:27] you create around you by your belief or
[1:55:30] unbelief. So, can we humble ourselves
[1:55:33] this morning to the word of God? Let me
[1:55:36] quote it to you again. The right mental
[1:55:38] attitude towards any promise of God.
[1:55:42] Now, what promise are you looking to
[1:55:43] this morning? Is it for healing? Is it
[1:55:46] for deliverance?
[1:55:48] Is it for a joy, a refound joy of your
[1:55:50] salvation, of his salvation? Whatever it
[1:55:53] is, what promise? A body change? Let our
[1:55:56] attitude be right towards God. Let it be
[1:55:59] submissive to the word of God.
[1:56:03] Any promise of God will come to pass.
[1:56:07] Not might, not maybe, will come to pass.
[1:56:11] Let's stand together.
[1:56:13] Hallelujah. Praise be the name of the
[1:56:15] Lord.
[1:56:23] Can we sing set your wings? Do you sing
[1:56:24] that song here? Set your wings. Let's
[1:56:27] sing that.
[1:56:33] Let's pray Lord Jesus.
[1:56:36] Oh, we worship you Lord. We thank you,
[1:56:38] Father. Lord, let us just set our wings
[1:56:41] now, oh Lord, to the winds of faith,
[1:56:43] Lord. Lord, that have been has been
[1:56:45] building in this service, Lord. Lord,
[1:56:47] the sweep of the Holy Spirit, Lord, as
[1:56:49] you're just sovereignly, Lord, Lord,
