TRANSCRIPT
========================================
react to it. Now he wants to push me &gt;&gt; to to react to it. And I I I've felt a piece when he said it. I just felt a piece telling me it's done. &gt;&gt; It's healed and I don't have it. Um, I I remember a while ago when I started looking for a family doctor, my siblings, they were telling me, "Why do you want to find a you're not sick?" And I just said, "I just need to know how my body's doing." And they said, "Well, some people when they got the hospital, that's when they get they die because they were they told they told stuff and then it gets worse." And I said, "I'm not going there to look for what they the doctor is saying. I'm going there to look for what God will say about me." Amen. &gt;&gt; So as I started, I knew it's not going to be an easy journey because people go there and come back very broken. So I was ready for it and I just want to thank God for it. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; I don't mind waiting. I don't mind waiting. I don't mind waiting on you, Lord. I don't mind waiting.

Um just uh invite you to go to the word of God right away. going to listen to the tape and just good to be in the house of the Lord this evening and uh greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you for thank God for the gift among us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh uh that's just wonderful. I just send a message to the musicians, song leaders, musicians and and instrumentalist those who play the music. It's just just amazing how they make a difference in our life and sometimes during the week and I just remember special that sister sang or the song leader sang and how it was played and just has been a blessing. God bless you richly. We appreciate you a lot. &gt;&gt; God bless you richly. Amen. Um, John 14:20 is that maybe John 14:18. I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you yet little while on the and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also &gt;&gt; at that day you shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you &gt;&gt; amen that's a promise for today as he was in the father was in him and he also be in us and us in him amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the time of union, time of oneness. So, we're going to listen to a tape of the prophet and on oneness. But I just before we go that just want to put a little bit emphasis that are thinking about. So listen to that tape. It's time of union, time of units. The prophet says in unity time and sign says we see the nations uniting. We see the world uniting. We see the churches uniting. You know we see in the world how things are being united all together. I was just reading in the news there the s the pope is going to be having a prayer with the with the king of England with the head of the Anglican church the first time after many centuries just to show that how the churches are uniting and the world are uniting. There are many see nations maybe uniting behind Trump and all different things. So there's a little bit of uniting there on the west side, western side and the eastern side as well. Uniting on that block. But it's a time of union. The prophet says there's that as the world we see in seen the sign. But there's also another union that is happening. &gt;&gt; There's union between God and his bride. &gt;&gt; And then he continued the court. He says we see the bride uniting uniting with the word. Why? The word is God. As the word, as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the earer of the word, they come together in a union. They unite like a wedding. They're getting ready for a wedding. They become one. &gt;&gt; The word becomes you and you become the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's our prayer this evening. God, I want to become the word &gt;&gt; and I want the word to become me. Amen. &gt;&gt; As Jesus said, at that day you will know it. The all all the father is I am all I am. You are all you are. I am. In that day you will know that I am in the father. The father in me and I in you and you in me. The prophet says see at that day. What day? This day. It's this day. So these promises Jesus gave there. It's a promise for our day. Amen. We find out that the great hidden mysteries of God being revealed. Oh, I like it said the prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; May God bless you and may just uh um just listen to the tape as we prepare for that. At the end the prophet will ask people to stand up. I think we you can stand up if you want but you can also just stay until it finishes and then we'll have our prayer time. So God bless you richly and listen to the tape. &gt;&gt; God g the elect of the earth. &gt;&gt; He said he'd send angels and gather them. Is that right? Gather them together. Separate them from the terriers. Amen. The terriers will be burnt, not the wheat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Dry. But they're so headstrong. They're going to have it or not. Don't make any difference. But God's chosen ones are commanded to come out from among. &gt;&gt; Be separated, saith God. and I will receive you. Touch not their worldly things and I'll be a father to you or God. You'll be my sons and daughters. Yoke yourself not up with unbelievers. But come out of it. God wants separation from the world. &gt;&gt; He wants to be unionized with you himself. No man-made scheme of organization, denomination, or any man-made theories will ever stand. It'll take God the Holy Ghost in you to unite you to God. And how you know you got it? The Holy Ghost that wrote the word will bear record with every word. And the same things that the Holy Ghost did in the Old Testament, you'll do in the New Testament will do now just the same. Because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And you're not yolked with organizations in the world. &gt;&gt; You're not yolked with them. Yoke yourself not up among them, but come out from among them. Ye are yolked to Christ. &gt;&gt; Yolked to the Lord Jesus Christ. The Bible says in the last days there'd be churches, another power of Babylite that have a form of godliness and to deny God's word and power, the power of his word. And what is the word? What is the kingdom of God? We've got to belong to the kingdom before we can ever be subjects of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many knows that? Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, how do you get the kingdom? The kingdom of God is the word of God made back in power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They power taken away sin giving signs. What kind of signs? If it's the same word that brought Moses out, it'll bring the same sign. It's the same thing as separated lukewarm lock. Now, we know Lot was lukewarm. Jesus said that'll be the sign of the end time. Lukewarm Lot sitting down there. He was religious. Sure. Him and his wife and they belong to all kinds of parties and he is the mayor of the city and oh there's a whole lot of things going on. He was very religious. He could entertain the evangelists and all of them come by. He was all right that way. Oh brother, he wasn't that elected. Look what happened. Why? The same God that separated and come to Abraham and showed him the vindication of his separation. [Music] Oh God, how I wish I wish I could could do something to let you see it. God showed Abraham then that he had separated himself. He showed him the vindication of it &gt;&gt; that he was with him and right in his midst. And Jesus said the same thing will take place in the last days. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Not a nation was Abraham. He is in a minority. But God was with him. It separated him. We're supposed to separate ourselves in this last days. You know, God gave a sign to Moses, to Israel, anointed prophet, a pillar of fire. He gave a sign to Abraham. He He gave a sign to Israel. He gave a sign to the disciples. Same sign every time. Same sign. Pillar of fire. Paul when he's on his road down to Damascus. There shined a pillar of fire before him that he put his eyes out, knocked him to his knees. Nobody else saw it. Everybody stand around. They didn't see it. And a voice said, "Saul, why do you persecute me?" He said, "Lord, who are you?" Said, "I'm Jesus." &gt;&gt; A sign. What was he? The apostle to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here we are in the end time. coming from the east and west, north and south. What are we doing? Getting ready for that rapture. &gt;&gt; Getting ready for holding ourselves steady for a few minutes to ever fibers filled with the Holy Ghost. and she'll go up. calling his people together to himself in the true oneness with himself because it's his one Holy Spirit by one spirit are we all individually baptized into one body collectively the body of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ living with his spirit in our flesh is serving the church and doing the same things he did as a as a sign as an in sign to the world that we're in the last days &gt;&gt; getting ready for the rapture. Oh, I love him. Don't you? &gt;&gt; I got a book here yet, &gt;&gt; but I just can't go any longer. We're getting too late. Might pick it up some other time. We are in the end. Oneness. Are you so one with God? That's where you're going to have to be. Yeah. We're going to have to be one with him to let the mind that was in Christ be in you. Then Christ is on mind and you will recognize every word that he wrote that did in the apostles rightly dividing the scripture which is the truth. The Holy Spirit if it is the truth and he'll bear record of it by bringing the same sign that he gave to Moses. Same sign he gave to Abraham. Same sign he did by Christ. same sign he did by Paul. We're in the end time. He said that that would be we're in the end time. The church collectively is getting together in a union. One here and one there making up. He said there'll be two in a field. I'll take one. One there. Look, two in a field. That's in the daytime harvest. I'll take one and leave one. There'll be two in a bed the other side of the world. I'll take one and leave one at the coming of the son of man. And it's so imminent. It's so close at hand. Don't Don't Adam, Adam, Eve, Adam, I mean, cry out to you. Don't listen to Allah the devil anymore. Stay with God's word. It's thus sayeth the Lord. Stay with his word. to separate from it is breaking your fellowship with God. God's oneness of the Holy Spirit. Then if you say you got the Holy Spirit and it's not in agree with the word, then you're not oneness with God. This is God's oneness. When you the the spirit that you got agrees with this word and manifests this word and makes this word power to act the same way it did there. Let's say it together. Oneness &gt;&gt; oneness &gt;&gt; with God &gt;&gt; with God &gt;&gt; is to have &gt;&gt; is to have &gt;&gt; God's spirit &gt;&gt; God's spirit &gt;&gt; in you &gt;&gt; in you &gt;&gt; agreeing &gt;&gt; with the word &gt;&gt; with the word &gt;&gt; all the word &gt;&gt; all the world &gt;&gt; the whole world &gt;&gt; the whole world &gt;&gt; and to make it &gt;&gt; manifested &gt;&gt; in power &gt;&gt; there you are that's oneness with God &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; when that power works in me &gt;&gt; and it works in you &gt;&gt; we are one &gt;&gt; hallelujah Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother kids, &gt;&gt; when the power of the Holy Ghost in me works in you, &gt;&gt; there's no disagreement. The word there, &gt;&gt; it works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It makes it what it is. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; made flesh in you by his word. &gt;&gt; The word made power among you. Every word. &gt;&gt; Now remember, the devil takes a whole lot of that word. 99 and 99% of it. 99 hundreds and 99% of that hundreds. He'll make it just exactly right. But then he'll jump off here. That's one cause of death right there. That breaks the chain right in the middle. Down you go. Every word. What did Jesus say? Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word. &gt;&gt; Not by a few of God's words shall he live. Not but 999% of it God's words, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. Man shall live by that. Satan took him up there and said, "It's written." See, it's like he said to Eve. It's written. It's written. Jesus said, "It's also written." He said, "It's written. He'll give the angels charge over thee." The Bible said so. Boy, he's a scholar. It's written. He'll give these angel charges concerning thee, lest the dash foot against stone and bury up. He said, "It's also written, thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." &gt;&gt; They said, "We got the scripture." Acts 19, we've been baptized with John. Paul had something else. He said, "That don't work no more." John only baptized, he didn't disbelieve John's word. He said, I'm tell you what John said. John said he baptized unto repentance, not for remission sins, the sacrifice hadn't been killed. He said he baptized unto repentance, saying, you should believe on him that was to come. And when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Paul laid his hands upon them so full of the word, and the Holy Ghost came upon them. They be to prophesy, speak in tongues, magnify God, and what a time. &gt;&gt; How big a church was it? 12. &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh, God don't deal in big numbers. He deals in honest hearts. &gt;&gt; Let us have that kind of a heart. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Oh my beloved wonderer, have you looked at the daughters of Moab? Or have you seen the daughters? I'm talking of churches of Cain. how far off of the word they stray. Have you, my precious friend, have you noticed in the last days that these things has come to pass? Have you been noticing recently about how the word of God has been made manifest? How that the revival that did once strike has quietened down? There's not much left. What is it? It's a low before the storm. The judgments are ready. Have you been denoting these things? Have you compared scripture with scripture, Bible word with Bible word, evidence with evidence? Have you compared the word of Jesus that he said that the devil in the last days would be so close like the real thing to if it was possible he would deceive everyone except the elected? the elected one just think that scriptural teaching is going to be so close. Oh, we believe in the Holy Ghost. Bless God forever. We got the Holy Ghost. We speak in tongues and then turn around deny the word. Yeah. Will deceive the very elected if possible. If there is someone in here that's not right with God, if there's someone in here that's sick or afflicted, these handkerchiefs and things laying here to pray over, I don't care what you have need of. Every promise in the book belongs to you. It's yours. I've brought you the word. Brought it from Genesis plum down to this day we're living in. Just hitting the places and showing you many hundreds of places I could have hit besides that. I don't have time. But surely in that you can see that this organization stuff is out. It's a false conception of the devil trying to organize man with the unity of their own mind and thinking when it's the Holy Spirit that we're joined to God as one by. And the Holy Spirit agrees with the word of God. See the Bible said Jesus said that they'd even confess it. You see, deceive the very elected if possible. You see where we're standing now? Pick up this word of God and that hand of faith. What do you have need of this morning? You have need of water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, the pool's open. You have need of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, he's trying to press his way into you. You have need of healing while the very Holy Ghost himself, the word that's been made power is right here now. The very power of discernment looking out upon this audience right now and seeing that light whirling around like a globe. Have I ever told you anything wrong? &gt;&gt; Have I ever as as a prophet said to Israel before they got him a man-made king? &gt;&gt; He said, "Have I ever told you anything? Have I ever took your money? Have I ever come down and begged you for money and and ride around and live in great big palaces and build great big things and take your money from you? Have I ever asked you for a penny? Never. Have I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord, but what God brought it to pass? Have I ever spoke in his name or what it was so? Have I ever told you a vision over the audience for what was exactly the person raised up stranger or whatever he might be but what if he said that's the truth. Have I ever told you anything went wrong? And let me tell you now thus saith the Lord. Receive the Holy Ghost, the spirit that will take the word of God in them hands of faith. Move out on earth. The whole kingdom belongs to you. It's yours, children. Why do you come from Georgia, from across the country, from Ohio, from Kansas, everywhere for a little meeting? I think the tape's off now. So, I can say this. See, why are you coming like this? What makes you do it? What is it? I see people here from Arkansas, from hundreds of miles away. last night coming and plum in from Kansas City. A little Polish brother standing back there come led said, "Brother Bramson, first heard you back down in Kansas many years ago. The things that you've seen and done, I've checked them right through right back and forth up and down and said, "Not one of them has ever been wrong." He's probably Polish Catholic. Here he comes taking the tapes, going out and playing them, meeting opposition ministers who ought to be with me and helping us. but denying the power thereof, denying the truth of the word, and claiming to have the Holy Ghost. I have not called myself a prophet. You've done that. But if it is so, then where does the word of the Lord come from? How do we know whether it's true or not? Unless there's something to back it up. That's God's word. You're the written word. &gt;&gt; And then if the written word is backed up, then it's God in that word making that word truth. Paul said, "Follow me as I follow Christ." &gt;&gt; Now, if you got a need of God for sickness, for salvation, what or get rid Some of you women that hasn't got the grace enough to let your hair grow. Some of you men that hasn't got grace enough to quit smoking cigarettes. Some of you preachers hasn't got grace enough to accept the truth of the water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. Some of you sick people sick and sick to die. Why don't you take this word this morning? I'll tell you now, it's flesh among us. Take that word in your hand. Your hands a picture on the wall of the angel of the Lord. The same one that led the children of Israel. Same one that met Paul. The same one that was in Christ. And the same Holy Spirit is in you. In you. Uniting you as one. What makes our hearts draw together for hundreds of miles? There's nothing like it in the country. Come into the word. There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emanuel's veins where unbelievers plunged beneath the flood and lose all their guilty standing. Ever since by faith I saw that stream, thy flowing moon is supplied. Redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die. Our heavenly father laying here is a bunch of handkerchiefs, gloves. They may go out in the mail. I don't know who laid them here. Maybe Billy, maybe the people here in the audience. I just feel to do this now. Lord, there's nothing in my hands, nothing in me as a human being. I couldn't rely upon my own human understanding. I don't understand why this is so, but I'm following what you said. They took from the body of Paul. Handkerchiefs and aprons and evil spirits went out of the people. It wasn't because he was a great man. It was because that God was with him in word and power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he never consulted the apostles but found out when they met together that the same gospel, the same form of baptism, the same everything that they were doing was eye to eye the same. &gt;&gt; Now I'm asking Lord for these precious people that's believing you that you'll heal them. Them in the audience, heal them, Lord. May their faith just reach up and get a hold of that word right now and say, "Tumor, sickness, evil, you might as well leave. I'm cutting with the sword of God. I'm believing. My faith is strong. I'm pressing the sword deep. Move out of my way. I'm rising from my seat to be well. I'm laying my hand upon my father, upon my sister, my child, upon my neighbor. I'm believing your word is truth. I'm in oneness with you. The works that you said that you did, we do also. Lord God, I believe every word and I'm coming forward. Coming forward to claim it, to pick it up this morning. Oh God, why I can think when the church was on the move, when Moses got a little scared down there at the sea, he began to cry to the Lord. And the Lord said, "Why are you crying to me? Why are you crying to me? Speak and go forward. Haven't I commissioned you to the job? Speak. Speak what? The word of God. It's in you. Speak and go forward. Don't cry unto me. Go forward. Lord God, today I come in the name of the Lord Jesus. I come yielding this sword of faith, claiming the oneness of God in man by the Holy Ghost through the mercies and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, his son. I defy every devil that's bound anybody in any way in this building, whether he be boy or girl, man or woman. &gt;&gt; I defy every sickness. &gt;&gt; I defy every doubt. &gt;&gt; I defy every fear. I defy everything that's ungodly. &gt;&gt; Leave this audience in the name of Jesus Christ. Come out of this audience &gt;&gt; that we can be one with God and can serve God without sickness or fear. &gt;&gt; May the power that made us one with God. How can that devil squawk himself around of the anointed? How can that devil stand out there and squawk himself like a Goliath when David come into the camp and said, "You mean you let that uncircumcised Philistine stand there and defy the armies of the living God?" &gt;&gt; Oh God, make man and women rise in the power of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let that unconverted, that dejected devil that's harmed the human race down to the age stand here and defile the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; Satan, come out and leave in the name of Jesus Christ. Jesus, &gt;&gt; bless your name. &gt;&gt; Now you that's got strength enough to yield a sword. &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. Now that you've got understanding enough in God's word to claim it to be your personal property, &gt;&gt; who can pick up the word of God now in your hand? &gt;&gt; Hold it out in the hand of faith and say, "I'll take my side with the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll be on this with my God from this on. I'll heal this sort of spirit in this word and I'll cut the devil to every promise that God promised me. If you believe that with all your heart, &gt;&gt; I ask you then sincerely with all my heart in the name of Jesus Christ, stand to your feet and accept. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise this one. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you mean it? &gt;&gt; Are you sincere? God's &gt;&gt; is a word in your hand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is your hand your faith? &gt;&gt; Raise your physical hand to God. Say, "God, by this, by my uplifted hand, I pledge all my life. I pledge my soul. I pledge my thinking. I pledge everything to the word of God. Let the Holy Spirit take my faith now and give to me the thing. Cut every doubt away from me. By faith, I receive the promise that I asked for this morning. &gt;&gt; Let this membership. &gt;&gt; If you believe it, say amen now. &gt;&gt; Say amen again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then if you mean that with all your heart in the name of Jesus Christ, I promise you what you ask. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Believe it with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We believe it. Amen. Believe it with all our heart.
