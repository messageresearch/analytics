God bless you richly. Thank you. Thank you, brother. We go to the word of God right away. Save time. Amen. Singing so well. could just make a worship service this just so good. Amen. Praise be to God. Invite you to go to Jeremiah 29 11. A familiar scripture 11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, say the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thoughts of peace and not of evil. to give you an expected end. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then shall he call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you. &gt;&gt; Not I might hearken, not maybe, but it says for sure I will hearken unto you. That's the promise God is giving to the bride. So when we come for prayer, he's hearing our prayers &gt;&gt; and he's also answering our prayers and God is faithful. Then you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart. &gt;&gt; And I will be found of you say the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will turn away your captivity. I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I have driven you, say the Lord. and I'll bring you again unto the place once I caused you to be carried away captive. &gt;&gt; Praise be to his name. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we thank you for your grace, your mercy. Thank you, Father. Lord, for each individual this evening, Father, I came, Lord, create me atmosphere, welcoming you, Father, as you dwell in the midst of the praises and our worship, adoration. Father, I believe that you are you are satisfied. You are you are happy Father Lord for to see the believers singing for you and glorifying your name father despite the the the tiredness of the day and the different things but now to focus just on you lord that you become the center of our mind thank you the center of our s of our thought father may you have the preeminence father as we'll mention father we share the word of god for a moment as we prepare for prayer father may you be with us for the remainder of the service as we love you. We thank you for the promise that you have given us. Positive statement, positive promise, father and we are standing on those promises. Let your name be glorified in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And have a seat for a moment. Amen. Glory to his name. I just want to share with you a small thought as we go to prayer. aligning with God's thought. Aligning with God's thought. The thought of God are thought of peace. Thought of God are not thought of of evil but thought of G of peace because God has an expected end. God is looking at at a final goal. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God is looking at the final goal. No matter what which way you might go, things might turn out and everything, God is at peace because he knows the final goal. Amen. &gt;&gt; God God knows already the final at the end of the story. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he's not worried. That's why he's not under under stress. That's why God is not he's not going to and fro. God is not tossed to and fro. God is just at rest because he knows the end result. Amen. &gt;&gt; As it was in that boat with the disciples or Jesus Christ was not carried about and carried here and tossed about here and there. He knew where it was going to end up. He knew his position. He knew his place. He knew what that the mission that God has given. He knew that he's not going to be destroyed. He knew everything. So if we can align ourself with how God thinks and how God sees things, we will have the rest in our soul for sure. &gt;&gt; Many times is because we don't think God's thoughts. Amen. We put our own thoughts. Amen. That's where we fail and that's where the enemy knows our weakness sometimes because we try to think with our own thoughts. But let this evening remove our own thought, remove our own reasoning, remove how we can try to figure out things and let God's thought reign. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God thought has been expressed through his word. Amen. If you read the word of God, you are reading God thought. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where we have to find God today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Because God's purpose, God's end result can never be defeated. No matter what the enemy puts, God's purpose can never be defeated. &gt;&gt; If God has put, even we are here for one purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believe that they are here for a purpose? &gt;&gt; We are living on earth here for a purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet I was reading the prophet, he would say, you know, we have been here to rule and to reign to praise the Lord and to live for God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, "Oh, thank God. That's my purpose. is here to reign and to rule and also father to praise you and to live for you to honor you by my life. &gt;&gt; That's what I desire to be. &gt;&gt; Unbelief only stops the unbeliever. Unbelief does not stop God. &gt;&gt; Maybe it stops you may stop to see the result of God at the time where God wanted to show to you. It prolonged it. Maybe delayed it for a while. Amen. But the end result will come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Israel was supposed to receive Moses when he came but they rejected him. They didn't deserve the the gift. They rejected him. &gt;&gt; And then God say, "Okay, then you are going to wait for a little while." But the end result is still the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; Unbelief only stops the unbelievers but does not stop God. &gt;&gt; Because God's purpose will always come to pass. That's why saying he's saying here, you know, this time as Jeremiah is giving this prophecy, they are midst they they're about I think they're about to be carried away. So it's G is the one who has been giving all the the the promises or not the pro prophecy but the prophecies that relate to their captivity. &gt;&gt; He's the prophet like the one lament the weeping prophet. He's one who saying things that are not. It is a negative prophet. This a always telling about our destruction. always telling us how we are going to be kept capt always telling how Babylon is going to reign upon us but in the midst of all the prophecies here he's giving a promise to Israel &gt;&gt; I will never leave you because my thoughts towards you are thought of peace &gt;&gt; even if you are going through this trial even if I'm I'm allowing this to because you want to draw their attention on something &gt;&gt; sometimes God has to draw our attention sometimes you know you know you have been going different ways he like a good shepherd you know sometimes he has to break your legs a little bit. &gt;&gt; Says, "Oh, what happened?" Oh, let me go back to church now. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he has broken your leg. You say, "Thank you, Lord, for breaking my legs." Because if I was just wondering myself on my own, I'll be lost. I can't lead myself. I need to be brought back. Amen. &gt;&gt; So sometimes God can break the legs. But if thought is not to hurt, it's not the order of confusion. It's not the the order of frustration. Is the order of peace. Amen. The end result is for our good. Everything works together for those who have been called and those who love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the same thing for Moses. Moses was called for a purpose. But Moses failed. He made a mistake. Amen. He wanted to do things on his own and he failed. But even though in his failure, God never removed the purpose for Moses. God never removed the end result for Moses. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had still to call him. Amen. Even Moses start denying himself. So no, I I don't think I I'm fit for that work. I don't I don't think I can do that work. God says, "Oh, now you are ready to do the work because you can't rely on your own ability. Now you're ready to do the work. &gt;&gt; When you feel like you can do everything on your own and I'll say maybe you're in a bad position. You should be in a position. God, I depend completely on you. I depend on you. Amen. &gt;&gt; God wants us to pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just imagine if we didn't have any need. Oh, we feel like we all we are self-sufficient. We call ourselves small Elohims. No, God does not want that. He want sometimes to put us the needs among us. So, we cry onto him. Amen. Then God is going to show his attribute. He's going to show how great mother eagle is. Amen. so that we admire his wings. Oh beautiful mother, thank you for saving me. Thank you for rescuing me. Thank you for healing me. Thank you for saving my children. Thank you for baptizing me with the Holy Ghost. Thank you for giving me a life of victory. Amen. &gt;&gt; May God help us to align with his thought. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says in Isaiah 55, for my thoughts are not your thought. So God is making sure all sometime when you think no my thoughts are not your thoughts. Neither are your ways my ways. Say the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, my thoughts than your thought. Amen. Oh God, let me remove my thought about any situation and go through your thoughts because they are way higher than my thought. &gt;&gt; My thoughts are usually about worries. Oh, how is going to how it's going to turn out? How when because that those thought are affected by five senses &gt;&gt; and the five senses they put us in contact of this and we trigger something in the brain and we start thinking and but you know sometimes you start thinking you start going away from the word of God it's time to stop oh go pinch yourself oh no I should not be thinking those thought they are not God thought what does God thought says God say God thought says you know what by your stripes I'm healed &gt;&gt; that God thought for my situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. God thought this bride shall not fail. As he failed, this last eve will not fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; Despite my weaknesses, I will not fall. I will not fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will get to the end result. &gt;&gt; Prophet says in exposition church age, age of virtue says the eternal thought of God. Let me ask you, are the thoughts of God eternal? If you can see this, you will see many things. God is unchangeable in both essence and behavior. &gt;&gt; He says we have studied that and proven that already. God is infinite in his abilities. &gt;&gt; So therefore, God must be omnisient. &gt;&gt; God is omnisient means he knows everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz when you come to God in prayer, you don't come to God like you are telling him a new thing. Lucy you don't don't you see that don't you see that was the behavior of the disciples in the boat &gt;&gt; master don't you know that we are about to perish because they thinking he has to know he has to learn new things don't you see my situation the Israelite in wilderness Moses don't you doesn't god see what we are going through no that's not that's the wrong approach &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; oh god you know what I'm going through and you have already provided the a way. So I'm coming to you Lord to claim my inheritance. My promise you promised this and I'm standing on the ground of your word. I know your word is faithful and I'm standing on your word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then God says, "Oh, he knows who I am. He knows who he's talking to. He knows the person is he can trust." Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says if he's omnicient then he he's not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge. &gt;&gt; If he can add to his knowledge then he's not omnicient. The best we could say is that sometimes he will be so but that is not scriptural. He is omnisient. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has never had a new thought about anything because all he thought he has already had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus Christ, if I can understand that you know the end of everything before it even starts, the enemy might put it like he's starting with a new thing on you. No, that's not a new thing. God's already knew that you will come and he already put protection for you all the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, if you are predestinated, you have been foren, God has already put the protection all the way. The enemy is discovering things, but God knows everything. &gt;&gt; Like one time we are having fellowship. I like to like, you know, this game we are in, it's a little bit rigged. It's a little bit rigged because God is protecting you all the way because he knows he cannot lose you. &gt;&gt; So he makes sure that you will get to the end result. &gt;&gt; No matter which way you go, the king in that game can never be lost. Can never be killed. No matter how much you have lost along the game, but that king who is the end of the game can never be lost. &gt;&gt; That you, that king there, that king can never be lost. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. No matter which way it go, no matter how hard it is, no matter the circumstances, the end result is always a winning side. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Says then he knows the end from the beginning because he's God. That's the thought of God are eternal. They are real. Think about the thought of God are real. I would say they're even more real than what we see, &gt;&gt; than what we hear, than what we touch, than our feelings. Because God thought &gt;&gt; everything that we see, they used to be a thought of God, now there's been expressed. Amen. &gt;&gt; But now God is saying, "No, those even the things that you see, if they against my word, the word of God, don't don't put your emphasis on them. Put your emphasis on God thought." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up and which would and which one day will be translated into substance and form. You know a blueprint a man an architect put some blueprint. I would like the door to be here. I would like the door to be here. So those building make sure that you follow those those the the blueprint because if you do that you'll mess up in one way. Yes. The other way it's not that like that. God has already put the blueprint because he knows the end. He knows that it will be here, it will be here, it will be here, here. No matter the circumstances, the end result, I will have a house that will have that form. &gt;&gt; I will have a masterpiece bride. &gt;&gt; No matter the circumstances, &gt;&gt; positive statement from God. But listen what I want to say. But they are already real and eternal and part of God. So if you are thought of God, you are already real and eternal and part of God. You can never be lost as God can never be lost. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like that. He continues says, "Now he has chosen he has chosen us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world." Now that means that we were right with him in the mind and thought of God before the foundation of the world. If you're not thought of God at the beginning, you cannot be thought of God expressed at the end. &gt;&gt; Because you have to start by being thought God's thought. Amen. So sometimes we are on earth here. We think like okay let me I'm a earthly being. Oh God I want to make to I want to be in heaven. Let me try to find a way to get to heaven. No, you have already been eternal thought from God. Now you're just going back to where you used to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not trying to make something up out of yourself. No, you have already been in God. You're going back to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being expressed in thought, but you're being expressed now. That gives an eternal quality to the elect. You can't get away from that. An elect has an eternal quality to it. An eternal quality attached to it. Amen. It's not the quality that he has to improve or becoming better and everything and no you you you have already eternal quality. God want you to express that eternal quality because it's already seed inside of you. He want to express that eternal quality that you already have inside of you. Are you with me this evening? &gt;&gt; A few minutes here. So that's what made the that what was with Jesus Christ. That what made the Lord Jesus Christ have perfect faith. What was perfect faith? Perfect faith that Jesus Christ had is he knew what the word of God says about him. &gt;&gt; What is the word of God? The word of God is the eternal thought of God being expressed. &gt;&gt; In other terms, Jesus Christ was already aligned with the God's thought. God eternal thought. That's why he couldn't he couldn't be worried. He couldn't he couldn't be the circumstances could not shake him because he already had he was already aligned with God's thought. He knew what the scripture was saying about him and he knew that the scriptures can never be broken regarding him. The scriptures can never be broken. If we come to have the same perfect faith if we come to align ourself with God thought I will guarantee you we will have perfect faith because you don't depend on your thought. You don't depend on the circumstances. You depend on God's word. &gt;&gt; It says Jesus relied upon what he was. He relied in knowing that he was the word. He had faith in God who made him the word. He was God the word and they was in him and they give him faith because he understood his position. He know what he was because the scripture said he was this. every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he will be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you know that he go into the grave only with one scripture? The anointing shall not the anointing shall not see corruption. Only one scripture. How much more the bride? There's so many promises. God knows the expected end for the bride. &gt;&gt; What the expected end for the bride on this earth is the rapture. Amen. The body change. Amen. As you feed upon the word of God, you are manifesting those eternal quality that God already put inside of you. &gt;&gt; That's why the proverb say if you have the Holy Ghost, you you have everything inside of you. &gt;&gt; You have resurrection, you have the rapture, you have healing, you have the joy of salvation, everything is in that seed. Amen. Everything is in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So because the scripture said he was this and here every scripture I didn't prove. Therefore he relied upon what God had made him and if he did that then can't we rely upon what God made us as believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can rely on what God made us as believer because we do not make ourselves believers. God made us believers. &gt;&gt; And what is the believer? A believer is the faith of God that moves in you. &gt;&gt; Say I'm a believer. Yes. One body you're a believer. But when a believer is because God put the faith inside of you and that faith is moving you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why you you can say you you you you have the same quality of haterite. This is nothing else but the truth. &gt;&gt; Hatite. Did you see the squares? No. But I know this is nothing else but the truth. &gt;&gt; Hatite. Can you explain how the the squirrel were created? I don't know. But this is nothing else but dirt but the truth. &gt;&gt; That's the same quality that inside of you brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God gave her God gave her the salvation of her children. &gt;&gt; The deacon was there but he was doubting. I was fellowshiing one brother. You know you know the worst things about the deacon. He didn't even know that he was doubting because he denied us. No, I was not doubting. Oh Lord, I don't want to be in that position where you are doubting. You are not even aware that you are doubting. I want to be in a position of hating right. Oh Lord, this is nothing else but the truth. I can't explain it. I don't want any secondary proof. I don't want to any word. I just take you at your word and I keep moving on. Amen. I'm coming with the needs and you know my needs and I'm moving on knowing that you answer to my needs &gt;&gt; no matter how difficult they can be. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says let your testimony always and your thought in the law 55 never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it. When it's thought that don't entertain it well you say I can't help the thought from coming. Well, that would be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place, but he could sure stop them from roosting. So, don't so that that a good thing. You see, you can't have the thoughts that when they come, but don't entertain them. Just pass it on. No, sir. Jesus is my No, sir. Jesus Christ is my savior. All things are mine by God. &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep them. I'm going to testify of them. And God can only bless you as you confess that he has done it for you. Amen. So the third is to proclaim what God has already done for you. He's the high priest of our confession. Is that right? Hebrews 3, the prophet says, he said that he's the high priest of our confession. He can only do for us as we accept it and believe it and confess it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was one question asked the prophet and I like that question. Thank God for the sister as the brothers asked that question. Brother Bana, please explain how a person knows if he's thinking his own thought or if the devil is placing thoughts in his mind to make him think wrong. Especially if you know you do not want to think them. You can't they come they come. Especially when someone gossiped about someone else. Every time you see them, don't entertain that. Let me try to find out. Let me try to you entertaining that. You're entertaining that. But but how do you know? Sometimes you think that you are thinking good thing. But how do you know if that your thought was God's thought and says then it if it's contrary to the word, it's the devil thinking. If it is with the word is God thinking. &gt;&gt; We touch that a little bit on on on Sunday about knowledge. If you if the contrary to the word it's the devil thing. If it's with the word it's God thinking. &gt;&gt; Sometimes people don't even know if it's the word of God or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those are thinking that in a certain trend but they don't know that it's not the word of God. They're just thinking. They continue thinking and it's not God thinking. But what God's grace has given us that he has given out the word of God has been unveiled so that we can know the thought of God being expressed. So once you know the thought of God being expressed, you align with the thought of God. You reject your own thought. You take God thought which is the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If it's good thought of the word prophet of the word and of God, it's God thinking then the question continues. If the case may be that the devil is placing thought in in your mind about a certain thing, how may it be overcome or got rid of it? Gives the solution. Thank God. Take the very vice versa from it. If the devil makes you think that you are, if you know you're a Christian and he tries to make you think that you are not a Christian, just take the ver the versa the opposite of it not the terms and say I am a Christian. &gt;&gt; As long as your experience matches in God's word, say I am a Christian. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But but what about this? What about this? I look into the word of God and my experience matches the word of God. I am a Christian. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know sometimes what the enemy tries to put on our because we don't know our word. We don't know where to stand on the word of God. Jesus Christ knew where he was standing upon the word of God. That's why it's important. I'm going to message on Sunday. It's important to know the word of God. &gt;&gt; If you don't know the word of God, it will be playing with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Could be just one day saying today you feel like you're saved, tomorrow you're not saved. No, you need to know the word of God. I know the word of God. I know I I I repented. I I I I I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And I've been filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And I know my position. &gt;&gt; I know. How do you know that you are born again? Because I believe the word of God of my age. How do you know you're born again? Because the desires I used to have, I don't have them no more. &gt;&gt; Can you make mistake? Yes, I can make mistakes. But right away I repent and I align myself with God's word. &gt;&gt; So you know your position. So you kind of be oh today am I forgiven? I'm not. And every time every time you repent for the same mistakes over and over and you think that you're spiritual. You're not spiritual. &gt;&gt; It's just the devil trying to put them things upon you. You know your position repented for it and you stand on it and you move on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you don't open a door to that thing anymore. You protect yourself from that thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Each one of us has is is a weak spot. Amen. So you protect your weak spot. You know the enemy when he comes on that weak spot. It can be on internet. You close that window. You can be on a you can be your temper and then when it comes you cool down. You take the opposite. Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise you'll be a Christian because you don't know where to stand. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Prophet says in spiritual adoption in order to stay with God stay gentle. God is gentle. In order to stay with God stay with love. God is love. Stay meek. Not never be self-sufficient. Always rely upon him. &gt;&gt; Never use your own mind. Take his thought. &gt;&gt; Let his thought be your thoughts. That's my prayer. Oh God, I want my thoughts to be your thoughts. &gt;&gt; Help me. He has given us a secret. How to know that these are my thoughts. This the enemy thought is when it's not aligning with your word. &gt;&gt; That's my own thought that the enemy thought and I don't want to entertain that. They can come, but I don't want to entertain that. I move them away and I stay on God's word. Amen. said take them into your connal mind and you repeat them over. Isn't that a good secret? &gt;&gt; You take them put because this the mind is is the is the greatest that where the greatest battle is happening is in our mind. &gt;&gt; But very easily we take other things have I have my kids here when they go to school and they come home I find them singing the songs and different songs. What those songs come? Oh, we know quickly it goes in their mind, right? By the word of God. That way we should put in our mind. More of the word of God. More of the word of God in our mind. More the word of God. &gt;&gt; And you repeat them over and over. Oh, I'm healed. The word of God by his stripes I'm healed. &gt;&gt; I'm an overcomer. &gt;&gt; I will not fall. Amen. The promises of God. You take sometimes of the thing the promise of brother Bam. We we we have a wonderful chat there. Thank you for the quotes that come from Damsa because we want our mind to be on the word of God. Our mind to be you can do on day different things. But thank God for reminding me what the word of God says. Put them in your house. Put them in your car. Put them do so that your mind stays upon the word of God. Repeat them over and over and say, "Oh God, take all my doubt away and let my thought be your thought." And you sick people do what I do that as as we are repeat as we are speaking just take away cast away the thought of sickness take God's healing thought let them become your thought &gt;&gt; so you take your thought of sickness oh I'm sick and the doctor says this and everything oh yeah they do their work but take God's healing thought and let them become your thought &gt;&gt; you become them your thought I want to align with God's thought not my thought God thought that's where there is value in think upon these things the Bible says if there is any praise if there be any virtue think upon these things &gt;&gt; word becoming flesh says what kind says if becomes a real revelation of that you where am I just want to get somewhere when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or direct the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that you are moving your mortal being. What kind of people should we be? If the very Holy Spirit has as you so embodied and empowered that you don't use your own thoughts, you don't use your own mind, you don't use your own opinions by the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thought and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you. That's what we desire. God, I want you to express yourself through me. Amen. Through the Holy Spirit leading me to the word of God. I want you to be expressed through my life. It was God's thought. The thought of God has been expressed. It become God's word. Now the word of God need to be expressed in the believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be God thought expressed. I want to be attribute of God expressed. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to express any other thing but God's word. Amen. closing this. Isn't it wonderful? Think when we we mean that everything is surrendered. I'm no more my own thinking. I hasn't I haven't going I'm going I'm not going to think like I I will think. Lord, I'm just going to think like you think. &gt;&gt; And you promise that I I was healed. I think that &gt;&gt; I surrender my thinking. I won't no more think about my sickness. I won't think about the disease I had. I'm not going to be thinking about about nothing but thinking what you said. Now, right out in front of you stand a person just like he was a few minutes ago. He's talking to a person that you were sick down here, but there is a well person standing there. Jesus Christ is calling to that well person right beyond it. Amen. Now you just by faith you close your eyes, walk right into that well body then just keep on walking just keep on going. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you know you have it's not it's not fabricating an image. No that's not what he's trying to say. Say God already had a perfect image of you being healed. &gt;&gt; Because God word says that. Amen. He has a perfect image of you being walking in a victorious life. He has already had that perfect image. Now you need to align with the perfect image of God. Amen. Because that how God sees you. That how the word of God declares that you are. Amen. You see the Florence Netting if you see the picture of her. The prophet was looking at the picture of her says miserable place. I mean I I even wonder where the tears were coming from. Where is water? Where's the moisture coming from? She was so such a miserable place. But when the anointing came &gt;&gt; says now you can just walk into that well-being person that God has of you. Just keep confessing God I'm healed. See yourself in that well-being person that God has made you. You will see things change and we know the end result of Florence nothing. How you see the two pictures you can is it really the same person? But God was already looking at the last picture even though she was in a in a in a very bad situation. But in God's mind, he was already looking at the nice picture. The same thing for the bride. No matter where you can be, God is already looking at the very nice picture of you. Amen. The devil doesn't know. He knows maybe the the other picture, but we need to look God's word. That what has the right picture for us. Praise be to his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. musicians can come as we go through the word to prayer. Amen. Romans 12:2 as they're coming. Bible says, "Be not conformed to this world, but being transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good, acceptable, and perfect will of God." We desire to be transformed by the renewing of our mind. The greatest place, the the place where the greatest battle is happening is our mind where they're trying to get. He can't get to the soul, but he can get to the mind. So now we need our mind need to be transformed. We need to have the mind of Christ. How can you have the mind of Christ? Align yourself with the word of God. Because Christ is the word of God. Amen. [Music] Shout in the Lord. We've got [Music] in a secret place. Carrying the spirit beholding his face.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Anyone has a request this evening like to express it then the church will be going through. Someone has a request like to express to the congregation before we go in prayer a testimony. [Music] Um, I just have a short testimony. Last week, we put in a prayer request for paperwork for my brother's uh repatriation uh back home. I just want to thank God that um everything is going in order. All the paperwork has started. So they said by the end of the week uh they should have uh the final result and they should be able to repatriate the body back home. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise be God. &gt;&gt; Another one. I'd like to thank God. Last week, last week we prayed about um my little business and that we're waiting on God to provide us with um children. And this week we've gotten one child &gt;&gt; and we really thank God for providing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. It's one thing to ask for request, but God likes a a thankful heart. &gt;&gt; Come say, "Thank God for helping me." Amen. Brother Joseph, &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, I just want to thank the Lord for providing me with an opportunity to be in his house as often as I can whenever the doors are open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was offered with the same company. They offered me a new position that I didn't apply for. And I I I I actually don't know how it happened. &gt;&gt; It is just God. &gt;&gt; Um about a year and a half ago, my wife had a dream that they had offered me the same job &gt;&gt; and she told me, but I forgot about it. I you know, I I just don't have enough words to express how I can thank the Lord. It's I my background is accounting. I lost my job in Calgary uh in 2014 in accounting and I gave up. I got depressed. I stopped studying accounting. I don't have my designation and I went into labor. uh did full labor for seven years and from nowhere the company I work for just said we want you to be an accountant. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; I just don't know how it happened. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Our God is doing great miracles. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Our God is tremendous. &gt;&gt; Wonderful thing he does. Amen. Was someone else &gt;&gt; the Lord that um I had pain in my foot um and I just kept thanking the Lord for my healing. And then um I had gone to the chiropractor and he had done some adjustments on me. And then he um he'd obviously asked in the beginning how how my health was and whatever. And I mentioned my foot. And then as soon as I did that, I realized at that moment I was like, "Oh, you shouldn't have said anything." Because I hadn't said anything out loud. I was just thanking the Lord for my healing. And whenever my foot would hurt, I would just say, "Thank you, Lord, for my healing out loud, but I wouldn't say for my foot or anything like that because I didn't want Satan to know." And I was like, why did I say something? And I immediately con felt convicted. And then he said, oh, it's blah blah blah. And he gave a name for it or whatever. And right there in my mind, I said, "No, I refuse that. I'm not accepting that." And I was like, "Shame on me. I shouldn't have said anything." And so, um, then we got in the car and we're heading home and I said to Adeline, I was like, "I shouldn't have said anything." I was like, "My foot did hurt. It doesn't hurt anymore." And I said, "The Lord has healed my foot." And I was like, "He's given me my healing." And I said, "Um, your body um obeys the confession of your mouth." And I said, "So I said, remember that, Adeline?" I was like, "My foot is healed." And then it was only like two days later that I was talking to my mom on the phone and my foot had been hurting in the morning, but I wasn't acknowledging it. I was just saying, "Thank you, Lord, for healing me." And then as I was talking to my mom on the phone, I told her, I was like, um, mom, I have a testimony. And so I told her about my foot and everything and I said, "The Lord's healed me." And I said, as I'm talking to you on the phone right now, I was like, the pain is left and it's gone. And so I just want to thank the Lord that he's given me my healing. And not just for my foot, but for other things in my body. I just want to give the Lord praise. Thank you, God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Praise be to God. Praise God. He's the healer. Amen. Praise be to God. And the body shall follow the confession &gt;&gt; of our mouth. Yeah. Glory to God. Praise be to God. Gives you a job and he gives you a supervisor who is a message believer. You can't have better than that. Praise be to God. I wish I had one. He would allow me to go a bit on Wednesday a bit early. Praise be to God. Thank you, brother Joseph. God bless you richly. I will praise him. I will praise him.

If you don't pray for the congregation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. Closing prayer. &gt;&gt; Let's pray everyone. Heavenly Father, how sweet it has been to be in the house of God again today. &gt;&gt; From the worship to the word to the worship, we keep on praising you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You alone are worthy of all adoration and praise. &gt;&gt; Is your blood that paid our price, your redemption, your rising from the dead, Lord, giving us new life, Lord. And as our our hearts yearn to hear the word preached and hear the prophets spoken the word that will empower us, Lord, to write to look in the right direction, Lord, to receive the right word for our day, for our needs. We thank you for every testimony here tonight, Lord. every person represented here, Lord, who has brought along the fire of God with them and who takes it with them to share and to testify that the living God is real in our lives. &gt;&gt; And in the preaching of the word, though foolishness to man, Lord, it is golden. It is glorious, is eternal, and it is so filling. It is so good. Lord, &gt;&gt; I pray you'd strengthen our brother Moses and and everyone else who has been supporting him in prayer even during the service and those who are streaming. Lord, we pray you'd be with them and may they catch something, Lord, that will quicken their spirit, Lord, to be prepared, Lord, of your soon coming. For we know not when, any moment, any twinkling of an eye, Lord, you will come on the scene, Lord, just like you did today, Lord, in your word. You gave us a rich banquet. We've been blessed to receive the word again and we ask Lord that you'd bless everyone who's come Lord and those who couldn't make it Lord be with them. Think of the Mensas and others who would love to be here, Lord, would one reason other aren't able to, Lord, either working or whatever. But Lord, you are a rearranger of schedules, Lord. &gt;&gt; We also know that you bring about all things according to your purpose. &gt;&gt; What you have ordained, Lord, what you have foreseen and you've envisioned for us. Oh God, help us, Lord. We confess our faults. Unworthy though we are, Lord, we receive it gladly, Lord. &gt;&gt; This word that quickens us. We praise you. And Lord, I pray you'd go home with each believer and everyone who has been here in the house of the Lord, feeding on the word &gt;&gt; and comfort them and strengthen them and give them more faith and and also concerning sister Sharifa's brother, all that matter. Lord, we lift it up and give you praise for it. Lord, we're really grateful for that and for the smallest little thing, Lord, and for the big things you do, Lord. We're really grateful, Lord. and we so love you and we ask that you keep us until we meet again. Lord be with us. We pray in Jesus lovely name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Are dismissed. See you on Sunday. [Music] Lord, we lift our hands in worship as we lift your holy You deserve the glory and the honor.
