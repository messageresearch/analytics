[9:56] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts. Heavenly Father,
[9:59] we come before your presence.
[10:02] We are empty-handed, Lord. Our hearts
[10:05] are yearning for you. We're looking for
[10:07] a blessing from you, a word spoken, an
[10:10] encouragement given,
[10:13] something to lift us up, Lord, into
[10:15] those beautiful heavenlies.
[10:18] Lord, we've had a week which has
[10:21] challenged us, Lord, many of us. And
[10:23] we've had victory also, Lord. And you've
[10:26] provided all of our needs. We give you
[10:28] thanks and praise. Thank you for
[10:30] bringing us all together here that we
[10:32] could worship you in spirit and in
[10:35] truth. We ask Lord that you speak to
[10:38] each individual heart this morning.
[10:41] May the song service Lord bring you
[10:44] nearer and may we draw near. May we be
[10:47] lifted up into you. May we be found in
[10:50] Christ today Lord. May the preaching of
[10:52] the word and the accepting and embracing
[10:56] of your lovely lively presence and your

[11:02] Lord. We're reminded that your blood
[11:05] your blood has paid the price, Lord.
[11:08] That all our sins are cast into sea of
[11:10] your forgetfulness. We ask now, Lord,
[11:13] that you'd inspire the speaker and every
[11:16] person who hears, Lord, may we receive
[11:20] that blessing that's needed. for us to
[11:23] keep going in our journey. Lord, thank
[11:26] you for healing us. Thank you for for
[11:29] the transgressions, Lord, that put
[11:31] behind, Lord. We ask now, Lord, as we
[11:34] look by faith to Calvary, Lord, and to
[11:37] preached word, bless our brother Pas,
[11:40] our brother Moses, the pastor, Lord, and
[11:42] we ask your blessing, anointing on every
[11:46] officer of the church. pray a special

[12:10] in Jesus name amend
[12:13] bless you all
[12:18] sure you can have your seat
[12:22] Brother Gian asked me if I could tell my
[12:26] I had a little praise report. Uh so
[12:29] recently I was uh subbing in the schools
[12:32] and um they said, "Hey, you you can
[12:36] stay. They somebody's going on medical
[12:38] leave and so we need somebody to fill
[12:40] in." So I thought about it and I said,
[12:43] "Siz it up. Can I do this?" Yes, I know
[12:46] the kids from last year. This is a grade
[12:48] nine class and They are the ones who are
[12:51] slipping through the cracks. Those who
[12:54] not so well but the system pushes them
[12:56] through. So we're dealing with literacy
[12:59] issues and by teaching them math which
[13:01] is a core subject and English which is
[13:04] also a core subject and they're working
[13:06] at a certain level various as they
[13:08] always spread across this continuum.
[13:11] But uh I took on the challenge. I said
[13:14] yes because I I asked the Lord. He said
[13:17] do it. I'm with you. Fear not. I won't
[13:21] leave you. And so, he hasn't left me.
[13:23] He's been very faithful to me as I as
[13:26] I've now worked in a bit over a week
[13:28] with these students. And I've I've got
[13:31] about 80 students alto together and
[13:34] teaching them life skills and careers as
[13:36] well as I'm also a foods teacher. So, I
[13:38] get to cook which is kind of cool. But
[13:42] the math and and uh and the English it's
[13:45] coming along really nicely. Got great
[13:47] response. It's the Lord doing it every
[13:49] step of the way. Huge challenge with uh
[13:53] when we've got a whole class full of
[13:55] students who are not really at the level
[13:57] they should be. But the Lord is
[14:00] faithful. He he will not leave us
[14:02] destitute. He will always provide a way
[14:05] where there is no way. And so this job
[14:08] will continue at least till Christmas.
[14:10] And it's not sure. It may be longer. It
[14:12] may even be to the end of the year. But
[14:15] uh I don't know. It's Thank you, Sister
[14:18] Wendy, for taking Wednesdays. Gives me a
[14:20] chance to have something marked for
[14:23] Thursday so I can be in in to do my job
[14:26] properly. But God bless you. And I'll

[14:32] this as time goes. Lord bless you.

[34:45] could give a a short testimony and a
[34:47] song. Thank you brother Gosian for
[34:52] trying to put on the time but I just
[34:54] want to give him a little time as he
[34:56] asked for that and so everything is in
[34:59] order. I'm just going to give you a
[35:00] place for a moment for a short testimony
[35:02] and and then uh and then I we go to the
[35:07] word of God.

[41:54] provide needs of the family when God is
[41:58] keeping you safe for the place where
[42:00] you're working. I think it's a it's a
[42:02] great miracle for the father.

[42:38] and father
[42:41] gosh gave an exhortation prayer prayer
[42:45] prayer and then we had a small session
[42:47] of the young people and praying for the
[42:49] needs and personal needs. So just just a
[42:53] good atmosphere and how we can carry one
[42:56] another's burden just praying for
[42:58] another. It was it was just good that
[43:00] the simplicity of the children and just
[43:04] praying and it was just nice atmosphere
[43:07] and I pray that we continue having
[43:11] the the youth meeting and then and if
[43:14] you need transportation just let us
[43:16] know. We are willing to to transport and
[43:20] move you from one place to the other
[43:22] just to attend those meetings. Um, we
[43:25] have communion on the 14th of December.
[43:29] Just keep that in prayer 14th of
[43:31] December. We try to do that every three
[43:33] months. So, we can keep that on for the
[43:38] for the December the 14th. And next
[43:42] weekend, next weekend, we'll have a
[43:44] special visitor from brother Toby
[43:47] referred him to him to me coming from
[43:49] Kenya. I think be a blessing and also
[43:53] want to say thank you for the ministers
[43:56] were there when uh when I was not there
[43:58] and just replaced and help brother thank
[44:02] you also brother Victor [snorts]
[44:05] is in is in
[44:07] brother Victor and just thank you for
[44:10] for taking the Wednesdays and the other
[44:12] ministers
[44:14] ministers and thank you for the officers
[44:16] of the church and the presence of each
[44:18] and everyone Without
[44:20] you there's no church. So appreciate the
[44:23] presence. Brother Bham says you support
[44:25] the church by your presence as well and
[44:28] offering ties but the presence is
[44:30] important because without you there is
[44:32] no there's no church. Um so we
[44:35] appreciate that you're coming. Um I I
[44:38] failed to put um to start by by by the
[44:42] report a little bit but just greetings
[44:45] from the brothers and ministers and over
[44:47] there greeting the church and pastor
[44:50] Zeke for sure and sister Anita and um
[44:55] they've done a great work over there
[44:57] through all these years. Something
[45:00] telling I've learned a lot over there
[45:02] but one of the things that I've learned
[45:03] is
[45:05] appreciate Pastor Z more and Steve Moore
[45:09] for the work that has been done that was
[45:11] not visible the simplicity but a lot has
[45:14] been done over there
[45:16] and I I tease brother Steve like the CL
[45:21] family looks like eighth messenger in
[45:24] India [laughter]
[45:25] doesn't like that when I say that he
[45:28] doesn't like it but tease him a bit hard
[45:32] but we became friends so I could could
[45:34] almost say that but don't use that on
[45:36] him you might he might not smile at you.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[45:38] &gt;&gt; But
[45:40] because he said, "Brother, if you
[45:42] continue, I'll come out of the
[45:43] ministry." [laughter] So he was
[45:45] threatening me. But I was I was allowed
[45:47] after those two weeks of friendship to
[45:50] Cortis. It's just a tremendous work and
[45:53] respect them a lot. Respect him pastor
[45:56] pastor Zeke a lot and the work has been
[45:59] done, the patience through these years.
[46:02] And uh it's people coming from from
[46:05] denominations and
[46:07] you you bury them and help them and they
[46:11] found one key brother there. Maybe at
[46:13] the end I might give that more report.
[46:16] Um
[46:18] what do you think? Can I say can I can I
[46:20] just move on? I'm feeling a little bit
[46:22] sorry for pastor pastor for brother Bla
[46:26] who has to leave for work. I wanted to
[46:27] go in the work and the word of God. I'm
[46:29] feeling so that you don't come just to
[46:31] church for for song service and then you
[46:33] go back. I'm feeling for you. So that's
[46:35] why I want to go to the word of God.
[46:37] right away so that you get something
[46:39] before you go to work. Um but so but but
[46:43] we had a good time so I'll put that at
[46:46] the end so that we allow him to have to
[46:48] to have a little word of God. Um
[46:52] I lost my mind of thought. So brother
[46:54] Vam a precious man and we'll see that at
[46:57] the end is the one working printing the
[46:59] word of God and just tremendous man of
[47:02] God and and God has been using him the
[47:06] actually God's grace that Pastor Zeke
[47:08] found him because at the place where he
[47:11] can print at low price $2
[47:14] for [snorts] for printing and almost
[47:16] delivering or including two two Canadian
[47:19] dollars so it's just just a miracle you
[47:21] can find that place like that and he has
[47:24] two boys all of them are two ministers
[47:27] and they're helping me almost fulltime
[47:29] for that so it's just just amazing and
[47:32] 400 churches benefiting from that work
[47:35] 400 churches Think about it and just
[47:38] been a blessing or that and your your
[47:43] your participation is helping someone is
[47:46] helping churches there. Most of them
[47:48] don't speak English and
[47:51] even ministers don't speak English. Few
[47:53] people speak English. So the translation
[47:56] is really really needed. And we see on
[48:00] testimony one of them because they don't
[48:03] have food. [snorts] I have no food. They
[48:06] have to go in Christian libraries and
[48:08] read one book there, get a little bit of
[48:10] thought and then they can preach to the
[48:13] people
[48:15] of thought because they don't have the
[48:17] message. So what we are doing is really
[48:19] helping them. So God bless you richly
[48:22] and then let's go to the word of God and
[48:25] we'll put the testimony at the end.
[48:28] Keep your mind stayed on me as we go to
[48:31] the word of God.
[48:44] Stay
[48:46] on me.
[48:49] Stay
[48:51] on me.
[48:54] Faithfully.
[48:59] And I
[49:02] win
[49:05] perfect peace
[49:09] sweet
[49:11] release
[49:13] if you just keep your mind stay on me.
[49:21] One more time.
[49:24] In
[49:26] your [music] mind,
[49:29] stay
[49:31] on me.
[49:34] Stay
[49:35] on me.
[49:39] Faithfully.
[49:43] And I
[49:48] view your perfect
[49:50] peace,
[49:53] sweet,
[49:57] if you just keep your mind stay [music]
[50:02] on me
[50:06] as we go to the word of God. Just keep
[50:08] your mind on him for a moment.
[50:11] for what the Lord is [music] to you. How
[50:15] what he has done in your life, has been
[50:17] faithful, how he has helped you, how he
[50:21] has saved you, how he has healed you,
[50:24] has provided your needs and has been on
[50:26] your side. When you are weak, he's
[50:30] strong. Just think about the marvelous
[50:33] grace of God in your life and his mercy,
[50:38] forgiveness of our sins.

[54:00] Thank you musicians. Thank you.
[54:03] We have a
[54:05] special greetings to brother Andrew.
[54:08] He's known in India [laughter]
[54:11] because he was there said don't forget
[54:16] to greet brother Andrew and I would like
[54:19] you to be over there again. So
[54:25] I'd like to go to John 16
[54:29] 2028.
[54:58] John 16:208.
[55:08] Verily of verily I say unto you that you
[55:11] shall weep and lament and but the world
[55:14] shall rejoice and shall be sorrowful but
[55:17] your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
[55:21] A woman when she is in travail as sorrow
[55:24] because her horror is come but as soon
[55:27] as she's delivered of the child she
[55:29] rememberth no more the anguish for joy
[55:32] that the man is born in the to the
[55:35] world. And ye now therefore have sorrow,
[55:38] but I will see you again, and your heart
[55:41] shall rejoice, and your joy no man
[55:44] taketh from you.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; And in that day we shall ask me, you
[55:49] shall ask me nothing. Verily I say, I
[55:52] say unto you, whatsoever you shall ask
[55:54] the father in my name, he will give it
[55:56] to you. Hallelujah.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Either though have you asked nothing in
[56:01] my name, ask and you shall [snorts]
[56:02] receive
[56:04] &gt;&gt; that your joy may be full.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; These things have I spoken unto you in
[56:09] proverbs, but the time cometh when I
[56:11] shall no more speak unto you in
[56:13] proverbs, but I shall show you plainly
[56:15] of the Father.
[56:17] that day you shall ask in my name. And I
[56:20] say unto you, I say not unto you that I
[56:22] will pray the father for you. For the
[56:25] father himself loveth you because he
[56:28] have loved me and have believed that I
[56:31] came out from God. I come for from the
[56:34] father and I come into the world again.
[56:37] I leave the world and go to the father.
[56:41] May God bless his word and have a seat.
[56:48] Brother Banam used this scripture I
[56:50] believe and to preach on birth pains.
[56:54] Amen. And then go again Luke 128:34
[57:00] 38.
[57:02] And the angel came into her. I thought
[57:04] that I shared in India there like as
[57:07] well to share it here few moment.
[57:10] And the angel came unto her. Luke 1
[57:13] verse 28. And the angel came in unto her
[57:18] and said, "Hail, thou art highly
[57:20] favored. The Lord is with thee. Blessed
[57:23] art thou among women." And verse 34,
[57:27] "Then said Mary unto the angel, how
[57:30] shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"
[57:34] And the angel answered and said unto
[57:35] her, the Holy Ghost shall come upon
[57:37] thee, and the power of the highest shall
[57:40] overshadow thee. Therefore also that
[57:43] holy thing which shall be born of thee
[57:45] shall be called the son of God. And
[57:48] behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she had
[57:50] also conceived a son in her own age, an
[57:53] old age, and this is the sixth month
[57:56] with her, and was called barren. For
[57:59] with God nothing shall be impossible.
[58:02] And Mary said, "Behold the handmade of
[58:04] the Lord. Be it unto me according to thy
[58:07] word."
[58:08] &gt;&gt; And the angel departed from her. Amen.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; I share the thought there over there and
[58:20] I just want to speak about Mary's faith
[58:24] and brother Balam. will take the
[58:26] scripture of oh talking about Mary will
[58:29] go in different ways and we know that he
[58:31] will talk sometimes about Mary being
[58:34] just the incubator and and then the seed
[58:37] there is the real one so then put on the
[58:39] type with the the nominations and we are
[58:42] we are the seed proper seed sometimes as
[58:46] you speak the message of Mary's faith
[58:49] the faith of Mary and then and now he's
[58:52] talking to Mary as as a believer man as
[58:54] a true believer
[58:55] And and I want to take that that thought
[58:58] the faith of Mary and then go to that as
[59:01] the word was in Mary so the word is also
[59:03] in us. But when I'm speaking in a
[59:06] message uh peramum church age he took
[59:09] they take that that that is talking
[59:11] about what god gave him pick up the pen
[59:13] and write pick up the pen and write.
[59:16] Pick up the pen was an inspiration that
[59:18] the angel told the prophet or they had
[59:19] inspiration the prophet had an
[59:22] inspiration to write down. It's coming
[59:24] directly from God. For me, I consider it
[59:26] as a as a love letter.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Excuse me, my voice. My voice is still
[59:30] not completely recovered,
[59:32] but I hope it's fine. Amen.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; So, um, let me just drink a little bit
[59:38] here.
[59:46] Pick up a pan. You say that that letter
[59:48] for the for the bride. So, it's a love
[59:51] letter for the bride. It's like God
[59:53] speaking to you directly. God speaking
[59:55] to me. So he's writing that specially
[59:57] for the bride. Amen. It's not a letter
[1:00:00] that is being addressed to the to
[1:00:01] churches to denominations. It's a letter
[1:00:04] completely for the bride as he's
[1:00:06] speaking to you. It should be it should
[1:00:08] be something precious to you. For me,
[1:00:10] you know, remember when we in courtship
[1:00:13] before in courtship and all lots of time
[1:00:15] those were in the times where they
[1:00:16] didn't have they didn't have to to write
[1:00:18] in WhatsApp and Facebook and things they
[1:00:21] have to send the letter they send you a
[1:00:23] letter and then the letter takes one
[1:00:24] month and comes to you and then you and
[1:00:27] you really love when you receive that
[1:00:29] letter you keep that letter you cherish
[1:00:31] that letter right papa mat your time
[1:00:35] you take that letter you read it and you
[1:00:38] look at it you check it and you go ahead
[1:00:41] and some what does she mean by that and
[1:00:43] oh what does he mean by that and you
[1:00:46] really cherish that time amen it's not
[1:00:48] you might read one time but you go again
[1:00:51] you read it again you go again you read
[1:00:53] it again because you are in love the
[1:00:56] prophet says the Bible is a is is a love
[1:00:58] letter if you read the Bible you need to
[1:01:01] be in love with the author of the word
[1:01:02] of God says you read the Bible it's a
[1:01:05] love letter it's not a punishment it's
[1:01:07] not a dos and don't it's a love an
[1:01:10] expression of God to you. It's God
[1:01:12] telling YOU THAT HE LOVES YOU. Like he
[1:01:14] Jesus Christ is saying the father loves
[1:01:16] you. You have to be sure of that love
[1:01:19] towards you. Amen. Otherwise you you
[1:01:21] might take it as a law. No, it's not a
[1:01:23] law. It's a love letter. Amen. How many
[1:01:26] believe that it's a love letter?
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; So God is speaking to you and and the
[1:01:30] Bible is God speaking to you and the
[1:01:32] prophet takes it and is talking to the
[1:01:34] bride. say from a little group of the
[1:01:36] true seed of the word, God will present
[1:01:40] Christ with a beloved bride. So the
[1:01:43] prophet said that you are the BELOVED
[1:01:45] BRIDE. GOD LOVES YOU. GOD TAKES CARE of
[1:01:48] you. God is watching over you. God is
[1:01:51] thinking of you. If there is nothing
[1:01:53] else that is more important than YOU IN
[1:01:55] GOD'S EYES, GOD LOVES YOU. AMEN.
[1:01:58] Whatever the enemy is trying to put, no
[1:01:59] matter what you are going through, no
[1:02:01] matter the trials, there is love that is
[1:02:03] predominating over your life. WHY DOES
[1:02:06] HE LOVE YOU? BECAUSE HE CHOSE YOU BEFORE
[1:02:08] THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. THE WHOLE
[1:02:11] WORLD MIGHT DIE, BUT YOU CAN NEVER DIE.
[1:02:14] BECAUSE HE'S WATCHING OVER YOU. YOU ARE
[1:02:16] SO PRECIOUS IN GOD'S EYES. YOU ARE PART
[1:02:19] OF GOD. AMEN. YOU ARE THE BELOVED BRIDE.
[1:02:22] AMEN.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; MY WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT FOR ME THAT is
[1:02:26] just amazing to KNOW THAT GOD LOVES ME.
[1:02:29] I CAN NEVER DIE AS GOD CAN NEVER DIE.
[1:02:32] AMEN. I'M PART OF GOD. I'M SO CHERISHED
[1:02:35] BY GOD.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; IN ALL DESPITE BUT DESPITE WHAT I'M
[1:02:38] GOING THROUGH, GOD IS LOVE. GOD'S LOVE
[1:02:41] IS CONSTANTLY UPON YOU. HOW DO YOU KNOW
[1:02:44] THAT GOD LOVES YOU? BECAUSE HE CHOSE ME
[1:02:46] BEFORE THE foundation of the world.
[1:02:47] Because he put my name in THE LAMB'S
[1:02:50] BOOK OF LIFE. IT CAN NEVER BE ERASED.
[1:02:53] LIKE WE HEARD THE OTHER TIME FROM
[1:02:55] ETERNITY TO GO BACK TO ETERNITY. WE ARE
[1:02:57] IN THE TIME THE TIME HERE. NO MATTER
[1:03:00] WHAT CAN HAPPEN, NO MATTER YOUR
[1:03:01] MISTAKES, NO MATTER YOUR DOWN, THERE IS
[1:03:03] AN UNCONDITIONAL COVENANT HERE BECAUSE
[1:03:05] GOD LOVES YOU.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; HE CALLED YOU BELOVED BRIDE.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; My
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; go in India there. So they have their
[1:03:15] gods and then different gods. Oh, God is
[1:03:18] just do this, punishment, do this, do
[1:03:20] this. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A GOD WHO CALLS
[1:03:23] YOU BELOVED
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; MEAN HE LOVES YOU. HE WANT RELATIONSHIP
[1:03:28] WITH YOU. HE WANT A CONNECTION WITH YOU.
[1:03:31] HE DIED FOR YOU.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; YOU ACTUALLY THE PROPHET ONLY PROPHET
[1:03:35] CAN SAY THAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY MORE
[1:03:37] VALUABLE IN GOD'S EYES THAN HIS OWN
[1:03:39] BLOOD.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE COULD GIVE HIS OWN HIS OWN
[1:03:42] BLOOD. YOU LOOK AT OWN LIFE, OWN BLOOD.
[1:03:45] SO KNOW I I CAN GIVE THAT FOR HER
[1:03:48] BECAUSE I LOVE HER SO MUCH.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Beloved bride.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Say she's a virgin of
[1:03:57] his word. She's virgin of his word.
[1:04:00] She's a virgin because she knows no man
[1:04:04] made creeds or dogmas. Oh, you might
[1:04:06] have known, you might have gone through
[1:04:08] delination and everything. BUT ONCE YOU
[1:04:10] RECEIVE THE WORD OF GOD, THE WORD OF GOD
[1:04:13] IS CLEANSING YOU, IS WASHING YOU, IS
[1:04:15] MAKING YOU PURE. AMEN. IS REMOVING
[1:04:18] ANYTHING OF THE WORLD AND MAKES YOU
[1:04:21] VIRGIN IN GOD'S EYES. AND HE DECLARES
[1:04:23] YOU JUSTIFIED AS IF YOU HAVE NEVER DONE
[1:04:25] IT TO BEGIN WITH BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE CARES FOR YOU.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, EXPLAIN THAT. YOU KNOW, UH,
[1:04:34] excuse me for saying that, but you have
[1:04:35] to understand WHAT I'M SAYING. GOD LOVES
[1:04:38] YOU MORE THAN HE LOVED THE PROPHET. GOD
[1:04:41] CARES MORE FOR YOU THAN HE CARED FOR THE
[1:04:43] PROPHET. THAT'S WHY HE PUNISHED THE
[1:04:44] PROPHET BECAUSE YOU ARE SO PRECIOUS. The
[1:04:47] prophet's part of the bride, too. So,
[1:04:49] I'm saying you be careful what I'm
[1:04:50] saying. The prophet IS PART OF THE
[1:04:52] BRIDE. BUT TO KNOW IN THAT OFFICE, HE
[1:04:54] HAS TO BE FAITHFUL BECAUSE GOD WAS
[1:04:56] WATCHING OVER YOU. He wanted you TO BE
[1:04:59] SAVED. SHE CANNOT BE SAVED. IF SHE
[1:05:01] CANNOT RECEIVE THE CREEDS AND DOGMA OF
[1:05:03] DENOMINATIONS. SO YOU AS A PROPHET AS
[1:05:05] I'M SENDING TO YOU, YOU MAKE SURE THAT
[1:05:07] YOU STAY FAITHFUL BECAUSE I CARE FOR
[1:05:10] HER. I LOVE HER AND I WANT HER TO BE
[1:05:12] SAVED AND SHE MUST BE SAVED. MY WORD CAN
[1:05:16] NEVER BE COMPROMISED, CAN NEVER BE
[1:05:18] DEFEATED. MY PURPOSE IS THAT BRIDE
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; MY FROM ALL ETERNITY [screaming] GOD IS
[1:05:25] WANTING JUST TO BE EXPRESSED THROUGH YOU
[1:05:27] THROUGH ME. ALL THE ALL REDEMPTION
[1:05:30] STORIES IS ABOUT HIM AND YOU PERSONALLY
[1:05:34] YOU. AMEN. NOT SOMEONE ELSE. YOU
[1:05:37] [screaming] REALLY YOU. YES. YOU
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; BELOVED BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; MARY WAS THERE. She was not thinking
[1:05:45] that she was important in GOD'S EYES.
[1:05:47] BUT GOD was watching over her. AS SHE
[1:05:50] WAS A LITTLE BABY, GOD was watching over
[1:05:52] her. I WOULD SAY EVEN BEFORE SHE WAS
[1:05:55] BORN, THROUGH ALL THE GENERATIONS,
[1:05:57] THROUGH ALL THE THINGS SHE WENT THROUGH
[1:05:59] HER LIFE OR THROUGH HER PARENTS,
[1:06:01] GRANDPARENTS AND EVERYTHING, GOD WAS
[1:06:03] WATCHING OVER THAT SEED,
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; OVER THAT SEED, OVER THAT SEED. UNTIL HE
[1:06:08] GET TO MARY. MARY HAD TO BE THE
[1:06:10] FULFILLMENT OF THE WORD OF GOD FOR THAT
[1:06:13] SEASON.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; NO OTHER SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE, BUT GOD
[1:06:17] WATCH OVER MARY. SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE IN
[1:06:20] IN EDMONTON. SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE IN
[1:06:22] CANADA. GOD IS WATCHING OVER YOU.
[1:06:25] [screaming]
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; WANTS YOU TO BE SAVED AND YOU WILL BE
[1:06:27] SAVED.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT BECAUSE HIS LOVE IS
[1:06:32] CONSTANTLY UPON YOU.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Mary was probably wondering that's why
[1:06:39] she
[1:06:41] you are favored Mary you are favored.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Really? Me? What have I done?
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; NO, YOU ARE FAVORED. GOD'S EYES IS UPON
[1:06:49] YOU. I'VE CHOSEN YOU. I HAVE SELECTED
[1:06:52] YOU. I WANT YOU TO BE THE ANSWER FOR
[1:06:55] THAT PROMISE OF GOD. THAT PROMISE OF GOD
[1:06:57] THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 800 YEARS. FOR
[1:07:00] ISAIAH FOUND A WOMB IN MARY.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE OF YAHWEH FOUND A WOMB
[1:07:06] INSIDE OF YOU.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE REJECTED, BUT YOU HAVE
[1:07:09] ACCEPTED IT.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU ACCEPTED IT? BECAUSE GOD HAS
[1:07:13] PUT SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU THAT HAS THE
[1:07:16] ABIL ABILITY TO GRASP THAT WORD OF GOD
[1:07:19] [screaming] BECAUSE GOD LOVES YOU.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; NEVER LET THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE world
[1:07:25] try to to to diminish that love of God.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THE life of Mary having the
[1:07:32] baby. She suffered more
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; because she has to go that trip. She has
[1:07:36] probably she think wh why why?
[1:07:39] But that was inside of her was the
[1:07:41] blessing.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST BLESSING FOR HUMANITY.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST BLESSING FOR YOU IS WHAT
[1:07:46] GOD PUT INSIDE OF YOU.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; IT WILL MAKE YOU SUFFER, BUT IT'S YOUR
[1:07:50] BLESSING.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; IT MIGHT MAKE YOU SUFFER, BUT IT'S YOUR
[1:07:53] BLESSING.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; ONE DAY, ONE DAY AS A WOMAN, SHE GOES
[1:07:57] THROUGH MANY, BUT ONE DAY YOU WILL BE
[1:07:59] REJOICING.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; IT'S WORTH IT ALL. [screaming] THANK GOD
[1:08:02] FOR THAT YOU PUT INSIDE OF ME.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:10] OH, I feel like in India now.
[1:08:16] Oh [snorts] my my my.
[1:08:19] It says by and through the members of
[1:08:20] the bride will be fulfilled all that was
[1:08:24] promised of God to be made manifest in
[1:08:27] the virgin.
[1:08:29] really by you and through you God will
[1:08:33] fulfill the word of God that has to be
[1:08:36] manifested because you are the virgin
[1:08:39] bride of Jesus Christ in this time God
[1:08:42] could not do everything in time of Jesus
[1:08:43] Christ. God could not do even everything
[1:08:45] in TIME OF BROTHER BANNAM. GOD WANT YOU
[1:08:49] AND ME TO STEP IN TO DO THE REST OF THE
[1:08:52] WORK TO BE DEDICATED TO WORK FOR GOD TO
[1:08:56] BE CONSECRATED. AMEN. AND THEN GOD WILL

[1:09:05] SIMPLICITY. AMEN. BUT YOU ARE THE
[1:09:07] [screaming] GLORY OF GOD.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE WHERE GOD WANT TO MANIFEST HIS
[1:09:11] GLORY.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; YOU. AMEN.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; The word of promise came to the Virgin
[1:09:20] Mary. But that word of promise was he
[1:09:23] himself to be made manifest. God was
[1:09:27] made manifest. He himself acted at that
[1:09:30] time and fulfilled his own word of
[1:09:32] promise in the virgin. You what you need
[1:09:35] to have is just to take the word of God.
[1:09:37] Let it be done to me according to thy
[1:09:40] word.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT MARY HAD TO DO JUST TO
[1:09:43] ACCEPT THE WORD FOR HER SEASON.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Let be done TO ME ACCORDING TO THY WORD.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; MARY WAS FAVORED. SHE WAS CHOSEN. YOU
[1:09:51] ARE FAVORED. YOU ARE CHOSEN. MARY
[1:09:54] RECEIVED THE ANGEL. YOU HAVE RECEIVED
[1:09:56] THE ANGEL.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE PROPHET says the angel Gabriel
[1:10:01] CAME FOR THE FIRST VISITATION OF JESUS
[1:10:02] CHRIST. HE WILL COME FOR THE second
[1:10:04] visitation OF JESUS CHRIST. THE SAME
[1:10:06] WORD THAT WAS IN MARY, THE SAME WORD
[1:10:08] THAT IS IN YOU TOO. AMEN. SO YOU ARE
[1:10:10] FAVORED. AMEN. YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE

[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; The prophet says actually the angel was
[1:10:43] there 30 minutes before before Alza

[1:11:21] OWN UNDERSTANDING.

[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; It was not in my note. BUT [laughter]
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; JUST PICK IT UP AND EAT IT UP AND THEN
[1:15:40] PROPHESY.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; WHAT THE PROPHECY IS GOING TO COME FROM?

[1:15:47] EATEN. IT CAN'T COME OUT.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE WORD OF GOD, YOU
[1:15:52] READ THE WORD OF GOD, IT'S IN YOUR MIND,
[1:15:54] IT'S IN YOUR BEING, IT BECOMES PART OF
[1:15:57] YOU.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; THEY PUT YOUR ANESTISM. Sometime people
[1:16:01] put anesthesis, you know, when they go
[1:16:02] for surgery, then they start talking
[1:16:04] about yeah, ah this is what you have
[1:16:06] been feeding on.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE WORD OF GOD, PART
[1:16:10] OF YOU, PUT YOU ON AN ESTASIS. OH,
[1:16:12] PRAISE BE TO GOD. GIVE ME TO CHURCH.

[1:16:19] BECAUSE IT'S PART OF YOU. YOU PROPHESY

[1:16:29] SAVIOR. HE'S THE REDEEMER. HE WILL SAVE
[1:16:32] MY CHILDREN. HE WILL SAVE MY HUSBAND. HE
[1:16:34] WILL SAVE MY WIFE. I'M PROPHESYING THE
[1:16:37] WORD OF GOD.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS MARY'S ATTITUDE.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; LET BE DONE TO ME ACCORDING TO THY WORD.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; SHE CAME TO ELIZABETH. She didn't come
[1:16:46] and say Elizabeth you know this and
[1:16:48] political things and things happening
[1:16:50] here you know what is happening. No she
[1:16:52] came with the testimony of the word of
[1:16:54] God.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; The angel met me. Really? He met you.
[1:16:58] Who are you? Yes. He met you. HE MET
[1:17:02] YOU. HE MET YOU. HE MET YOU. HE MET ME.
[1:17:05] THE ANGEL MET ME. HE GAVE ME THE WORD OF
[1:17:07] GOD.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; AND HE TOLD ME EVEN YOUR SITUATION.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW THE POWER THAT IS IN THE
[1:17:13] WORD OF GOD. BUT ONCE YOU HAVE THE WORD
[1:17:15] OR YOU TESTIFY TO OTHERS, THERE ARE MANY
[1:17:18] JOHN BAPTIST THAT THERE IN PEOPLE'S womb
[1:17:20] there. BUT ONCE YOU TESTIFY ABOUT THE
[1:17:23] WORD OF GOD, THE JOHN [screaming] INSIDE
[1:17:25] OF THEM START DRIVEN.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. She come the angel met
[1:17:34] me and the angel MET ME AND HE TOLD ME
[1:17:37] THAT I WILL HAVE a child. You really
[1:17:39] mean that you will be raptured? You
[1:17:42] really mean that you'll be your body
[1:17:43] will be changed? How can that happen?
[1:17:47] Explain to me scientifically. I can't
[1:17:50] explain to you Elizabeth how it's going
[1:17:51] to be changed but I accepted what the
[1:17:54] word of God says to me because I
[1:17:56] accepted IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I DON'T
[1:17:58] KNOW HOW BUT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; MARY HAD THE FAITH FOR THE IMPOSSIBLE
[1:18:03] THINGS. AMEN. SHE WAS A BELIEVER. AMEN.
[1:18:07] IF IF SARAH HAD THE SAME FAITH AS MARY,
[1:18:10] SHE WOULD HAVE PRODUCED ISAAC RIGHT
[1:18:12] AWAY.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; SHE WOULD HAVE NOT NEEDED ISHMAEL, ISAAC
[1:18:16] WOULD HAVE COME RIGHT AWAY. IF EVE HAD
[1:18:19] THE FAITH OF MARY, SHE WOULD HAVE
[1:18:21] PRODUCED CHRIST
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; RIGHT AWAY. AMEN. CHRIST WOULD HAVE BEEN
[1:18:25] PRODUCED. IT WAS THE SAME FAITH OF
[1:18:27] ABRAHAM. IT WAS THE SAME FAITH OF ADAM.
[1:18:30] AMEN. BUT NOW GOD PRO GOD HAS promised
[1:18:33] Eve of the first one failed. But eve OF
[1:18:36] THE LAST TIME CAN'T FAIL. YOU CAN'T
[1:18:38] FAIL. AMEN. WHY YOU CAN'T FAIL? BECAUSE
[1:18:41] YOU HAVE THE WORD OF GOD IN INSIDE OF
[1:18:43] YOU AS THE HAVE THE FAITH OF MARY. YOU
[1:18:46] HAVE THE SAME FAITH OF MARY. YOU HAVE
[1:18:49] THE SAME FAITH OF ABRAHAM. YOU HAVE THE
[1:18:52] SAME FAITH OF THE IMPOSSIBLE THINGS. THE
[1:18:55] DOCTOR SAYS ONE THINGS, BUT YOU SAY,
[1:18:57] "NO, I BELIEVE WHAT THE WORD OF GOD
[1:18:59] SAYS.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; I AM HEALED."
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:05] THE SAME MECHANISM FOR MEN IN SPIRITUAL
[1:19:07] LIFE, IN THE NATURAL LIFE. THE PROPHET
[1:19:09] says she had a womb that was ready for
[1:19:11] the word of God. God make my womb to be
[1:19:14] ready for the word of God.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; That's what I desire, Lord. My womb to
[1:19:19] be ready for you.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SPEAK, I JUST SAY AMEN.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT to reason. I don't want to
[1:19:26] understand.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; A question was how would that be? He how
[1:19:29] would that HOW WOULD THAT BE POSSIBLE?
[1:19:32] Simple question because she's a young
[1:19:34] girl. How would that be possible?
[1:19:37] The angel the Holy Spirit will
[1:19:39] overshadow you.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Does he really explain anything? No. You
[1:19:44] look at it. No, that doesn't explain
[1:19:46] anything. Just overshadowing. BUT WE ARE
[1:19:48] IN THE CHURCH HERE. WE ARE BEING
[1:19:50] OVERSHADOWED BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; OVERSHADOW BY THE HOLY GHOST. AS YOU
[1:19:55] COME TO CHURCH, YOU ARE BEING
[1:19:56] OVERSHADOWED BY THE HOLY GHOST. IN THAT
[1:19:59] ATMOSPHERE YOU CAME MAYBE DRY AS THE
[1:20:02] stick of Aaron BUT WHEN YOU COME IN THE
[1:20:04] ATMOSPHERE OF GOD [screaming]
[1:20:06] OVER SHADOW BY THE PIT OF FIRE
[1:20:08] OVERSHADOW BY THE GLORY OF SHIKINA
[1:20:11] SOMETHING IS MOVING INSIDE OF YOU YOU
[1:20:14] DON'T KNOW BUT IT'S MOVING IT'S MOVING
[1:20:17] IT'S MOVING IT'S MOVING ONE DAY I'M
[1:20:20] HEALED ONE DAY I'M SAVED ONE DAY MY
[1:20:24] CHILDREN [screaming] COME BACK ONE DAY
[1:20:26] THE WORD IS MORE
[1:20:28] I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED, BUT I'VE
[1:20:30] BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; GLORY [screaming] TO GOD.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; That faith, man, Mary's faith. God, I
[1:20:47] just want my womb to be ready.
[1:20:51] But Zachariah,
[1:20:53] a Levite, a priest,
[1:20:57] he preaches every day. Preaches.
[1:21:01] [sighs and snorts] That's if Isaiah
[1:21:05] a virgin shall conceive uh uh God shall
[1:21:09] send a prophet. Uh
[1:21:13] the mountain will be low and and the
[1:21:16] valley will be high. No, a priest.
[1:21:20] But the angel come to him, you know,
[1:21:22] I've heard your prayer, Zachary.
[1:21:25] I have heard your prayer.
[1:21:28] You have heard my prayer. Yes, you will
[1:21:30] have a son. And Elizabeth will have a
[1:21:34] son. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:21:37] How is that possible? No, no, no, no,
[1:21:39] no. She's old. No, it's not possible.
[1:21:43] Start arguing with the angel. The angel
[1:21:46] said, "No, no, no, no." You have many
[1:21:48] examples, Zachary. You have many
[1:21:50] examples. You have Sarah. You have
[1:21:52] Hannah. You have many in the Bible. You
[1:21:55] have Rachel. You have many in the Why
[1:21:57] are you doubting? Why are you doubting?
[1:22:01] You are not going to be speaking.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; I I think many people should not be
[1:22:06] speaking.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Many negative things all
[1:22:10] my father died with that and you know
[1:22:13] it's many negative things. They should
[1:22:15] shut their mouth. negative thing. We
[1:22:18] have so many examples in in the Bible.
[1:22:20] So many example in the life of brother
[1:22:22] Bana. SO MANY EXAMPLES. WHY are you
[1:22:26] having that negative confession
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; just sorry for that but you know what I
[1:22:31] mean your mouth?
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; SPEAK THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; PRONOUNCE THE WORD OF GOD. PROPHESY.
[1:22:41] CONFESS POSITIVE. THIS BODY SHALL BE
[1:22:44] OBEDIENT TO THE CONFESSION OF YOUR
[1:22:46] MOUTH. [screaming] KEEP MOVING WITH THE
[1:22:48] WORD OF GOD. DON'T TRY TO REASON IT OUT.
[1:22:51] JUST CONFESS THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; OH, I DON'T HAVE A JOB. GOD WILL PROVIDE
[1:22:56] [screaming] A JOB.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; OH, NO. THE ECONOMY IS SO I DON'T KNOW
[1:22:59] THIS THING. YES, THE ECONOM YOU'RE NOT
[1:23:01] [screaming] PART OF THE WORLD ECONOMY.
[1:23:03] YOU ARE IN GOD'S ECONOMY.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE LIKE THAT WIDOW'S DIRECTOR. GOD
[1:23:07] HAS HIS EYES UPON YOU. HE LOVES YOU,
[1:23:10] BELOVED BRIDE. AMEN. KEEP MOVING.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you go see believers, true
[1:23:18] believers,
[1:23:20] they are going through trials. You go,
[1:23:22] you go to comfort them. They are the one
[1:23:24] comforting you.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; It's like, wow, I came to comfort him
[1:23:29] and now he's the one comforting. Oh God,
[1:23:32] make us MORE LIKE THAT.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; POSITIVE BELIEVERS, ENCOURAGEMENT
[1:23:36] BELIEVERS,
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; HELP YOU to move on. AMEN. BECAUSE THEIR
[1:23:40] TESTIMONY IS actually God sometimes make
[1:23:42] them to go through that so that can be
[1:23:44] an encouragement for many others.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; So but the angel's message was the word
[1:23:53] of God that have you have received. This
[1:23:56] is the word of God. The message of the
[1:23:58] hour is the word of God. It's not the
[1:24:01] thought of a man. It's not the thought
[1:24:02] of a sixth or seventh grade person. IT'S
[1:24:05] THE WORD OF GOD DIRECTLY FROM THE THRONE
[1:24:08] OF GOD TO SPEAK TO US. AMEN.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; THROUGH WORD OF GOD.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; As Mary receive the word of God. This is
[1:24:16] the word of God. For unto us a child.
[1:24:19] Isaiah 9:6. For unto us a child is born,
[1:24:22] unto us a son is given, and the
[1:24:24] government shall be upon his shoulder,
[1:24:26] and his name shall be called Wonderful
[1:24:28] Counselor, the mighty God, the
[1:24:30] everlasting father, the prince of peace.
[1:24:33] Amen. That's a promise. But it came
[1:24:35] fulfilled to that little young girl 16
[1:24:39] years old or so. Little young girl. But
[1:24:42] she just had the faith in the word of
[1:24:44] God. Prophet one thing says God give us
[1:24:46] more Marys. We want more Marys. Lord
[1:24:49] make me a Mary.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; MAKE ME A MARY. JUST ACCEPT YOUR WORD.
[1:24:54] LORD STAY IN THE ATMOSPHERE [screaming]
[1:24:56] OF YOUR WORD. FATHER KEEP MY MIND UPON
[1:24:59] THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; PROVERBS SAY her
[1:25:04] her secret, one of her secret was
[1:25:06] keeping the word of God in her mind.
[1:25:08] Thinking about the word of God, thinking
[1:25:10] about that scripture, think about what
[1:25:12] the preacher spoke there this morning.
[1:25:14] And she was thinking about meditating
[1:25:15] upon that. Prophet says the same thing
[1:25:18] for us. The more we meditate upon the
[1:25:20] word of God, the more the angel will
[1:25:22] visit us, THE ANGEL SHOULD VISIT US. WE
[1:25:26] are message believer. Angel visiting us
[1:25:29] should not be something very
[1:25:31] extraordinary.
[1:25:32] Man, it should be a common thing for
[1:25:35] believers. Sometimes you don't like the
[1:25:38] bloom and everything, but you think
[1:25:39] about the word of God, you see that the
[1:25:40] atmosphere change. YOU DON'T SEE IT, BUT
[1:25:43] THE ANGEL IS THERE.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER. You are my son. The
[1:25:47] word of God is your strength. Just keep
[1:25:49] moving on. Make a little whisper of
[1:25:52] prayer. Thank God for your grace. Thank
[1:25:54] you, your grace, for your grace. Thank
[1:25:55] you for saving me, Lord. Thank you,
[1:25:57] Father, for watching over me. Thank you
[1:25:59] for healing ME, LORD. I DON'T UNDERSTAND
[1:26:01] BUT I KEEP TRUSTING IN YOU. HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WORD THE TRUTH. AMEN.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Say fulfilled at that time all that was
[1:26:17] written of him because she accepted his
[1:26:19] word to her. She just accepted.
[1:26:24] Lord accept your word.
[1:26:26] The members of the virgin bride we love
[1:26:29] him.
[1:26:30] and they will have his potential
[1:26:33] for he is their head and all power
[1:26:35] belongs to him. Oh, I love this one.
[1:26:38] It's not my might. It's not my my
[1:26:40] strength. IT'S GOD'S POTENTIAL.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; SHE WILL HAVE GOD'S POTENTIAL.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL HAVE GOD POTENTIALS. HOW COULD
[1:26:49] THIS HAPPEN? IT WILL BE THE POWER OF GOD
[1:26:51] USING YOU BECAUSE GOD IS THE WORD OF
[1:26:54] GOD. We could not produce the bride
[1:26:57] revival in the time of Luther. No matter
[1:26:59] how much I think I mentioned it earlier,
[1:27:02] no matter how much he has read the Bible
[1:27:04] from from Genesis to Revelation, they've
[1:27:08] they were scribes. They were writing it
[1:27:09] out. They memorized it. They knew
[1:27:11] everything. But they could not bring the
[1:27:13] bride revival like in our time.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; THAT WORD OF GOD HAD TO BE REVEALED. IT
[1:27:19] HAD TO BE OPEN. IT HAD TO BE CLEAR SO
[1:27:21] THAT WE CAN HAVE FAITH IN THE WORD OF
[1:27:23] GOD. NOW AS WE HAVE FAITH IN THE WORD OF
[1:27:26] GOD, IT GIVES US THE POTENTIAL OF GOD TO
[1:27:30] CREATE [screaming] NOW A BODY CHANGE. WE
[1:27:33] ARE MESSAGE BELIEVER FOR THE RAPTURE.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; OUR FOCUS IS THE RAPTURE. OUR FOCUS IS
[1:27:40] THE BODY [screaming] CHANGE. AMEN. OUR
[1:27:42] FOCUS IS NOT THIS WORLD. OUR FOCUS IS
[1:27:44] THE BODY CHANGE. AND EVERYTHING IS
[1:27:46] INCLUDED IN THAT BODY CHANGE. WE ARE IN
[1:27:49] THE SEASON TO GO. AMEN. THE SEASON FOR A
[1:27:52] THIRD EXODUS. AMEN. THE SEASON FOR GOING
[1:27:55] HOME. THE SAINTS OF OLD [screaming] ARE
[1:27:58] WAITING ON YOU. ARE WAITING ON ME. AMEN.
[1:28:01] THEY WITHOUT ASK CANNOT BE MADE PERFECT.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; IS IT MY STRENGTH? IS IT MY NO.
[1:28:05] [screaming]
[1:28:06] IS THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; THE MORE YOU EAT THE WORD OF GOD, THE
[1:28:10] MORE YOU BECOME THE WORD OF GOD, THE
[1:28:12] MORE IT WILL DO THE WORK.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; I give you a challenge.
[1:28:21] Make a Friday evening for your family.
[1:28:23] If there's no youth meeting, put a tape
[1:28:26] for 15 minutes. Just oh family, let's
[1:28:29] gather. Put a tape of it. You'll see the
[1:28:32] revival in this church.
[1:28:35] Just put a tape, gather around, listen
[1:28:38] to it for 15 minutes, then pray. Is that
[1:28:42] too hard? No. Just put that for you'll
[1:28:45] see a revival in this church because
[1:28:47] it's not our potentials. It's God's
[1:28:50] potential. [snorts]
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; HE WILL DO THE WAY. WE GET DISTRACTED so
[1:28:55] many times and we forget the power of
[1:28:58] the word of God.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; So they are subject to him as the
[1:29:07] members of our bodies are subject to our
[1:29:09] heads. Notice the harmony of the father
[1:29:11] and the son. Jesus never did anything
[1:29:14] until it was first showed him by the
[1:29:16] father. John 5:19 says this harmony is
[1:29:20] now to exist between the groom and his
[1:29:23] bride.
[1:29:25] We look at Jesus Christ. We see the
[1:29:27] harmony between the father and Jesus
[1:29:28] Christ. As I said at the beginning,
[1:29:31] Jesus Christ was the firstborn. Jesus
[1:29:33] Christ was the wave shift, the first
[1:29:36] fruit. But God was thinking about you
[1:29:40] and me.
[1:29:42] is showing us an example so that the
[1:29:44] same thing will happen between JESUS
[1:29:47] CHRIST AND US TO HAVE THE SAME HARMONY
[1:29:50] TO HAVE THE MIND OF CHRIST TO WALK THE
[1:29:53] WAY HE WALKED. AMEN. IS IT BY ME? NO. BY
[1:29:56] THE POWER OF THE WORD OF GOD, BY THE
[1:29:59] POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, BY THE POWER
[1:30:02] OF THE DYNAMICS. AMEN. UNVEILING OF GOD,
[1:30:06] UNVEILING OF THE MIGHTY GOD AMONG US IS
[1:30:09] GOING TO do the same thing.
[1:30:12] Are you with me?
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Now it says
[1:30:15] he shows her his word of life. She
[1:30:18] receives it once again. She accepted it.
[1:30:22] Now she receives it.
[1:30:25] This is part of me. This is my word.
[1:30:29] It's not only for the parents. This is
[1:30:31] mine.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; It's not only for the husband. This is
[1:30:34] mine. It's not only for my wife. This is
[1:30:37] mine. I receive it.
[1:30:41] She never doubts it. Now he says,
[1:30:43] "Therefore,
[1:30:45] nothing can harm her."
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, nothing can harm you.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; THE GATES OF OF HELL CAN COME TOWARDS
[1:30:54] YOU, BUT THEY WILL NOT harm you.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; They will not harm your real you. They
[1:31:01] will NOT HARM YOUR SOUL. AMEN. THEY MUST
[1:31:03] A LITTLE BIT MIGHT DISTURB YOUR MIND.
[1:31:05] THEY MIGHT DISTURB IT THIS BODY. BUT
[1:31:07] YOUR REAL YOU, THEY CAN NEVER TOUCH IT.
[1:31:10] THEY CAN NEVER HARM IT. THEY CAN NEVER
[1:31:13] DECEIVE IT. THEY CAN NEVER TAKE YOU FROM
[1:31:16] GOD BECAUSE YOU ARE PART OF GOD. YOU ARE
[1:31:19] THE BELOVED BRIDE. AMEN. NOTHING CAN
[1:31:22] HARM YOU. YOU WILL MAKE IT. AMEN.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; EVEN AGAINST YOUR OWN WILL, I'M TELLING
[1:31:28] YOU, YOU WILL MAKE IT.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST
[1:31:31] PREDESTINATED, YOU WILL MAKE IT. If he
[1:31:34] has ALREADY TAKEN YOU UPON THAT HOOK.
[1:31:36] AMEN. YOU might go and then try. Oh, as
[1:31:39] a brother, one brother preached the
[1:31:40] other. It's like it's like it's like a
[1:31:43] GPS.
[1:31:44] GPS. The destination is already there.
[1:31:46] You might go it recalculation
[1:31:49] recalculation. RECALCULATION. BUT THE
[1:31:51] DESTINATION IS ALREADY SET. YOU HAVE TO
[1:31:54] GO [screaming] TO THAT DESTINATION. YOU
[1:31:56] HAVE BEEN CHOSEN. YOU WILL GO THERE.
[1:31:58] AMEN.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; OH, thank God for this love letter.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; I will cherish it, Lord. I love this
[1:32:08] letter, Lord.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; For telling me who I am.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; I did not know who I was. I thought that
[1:32:14] I was just a little Mary walking around
[1:32:16] here and drawing water and but now you
[1:32:19] are telling me that I've been part of
[1:32:21] the PROPHECY ALL THESE YEARS. Thank you
[1:32:24] for opening my mind to see that Lord
[1:32:26] that I'm PART OF THE PLAN OF REDEMPTION.
[1:32:29] I AM PART OF YOU. I WILL BE BEARING
[1:32:32] JESUS CHRIST IN THIS LAST AGE IN THE
[1:32:35] TIME OF LEODYSIA.
[1:32:37] MARY born from a city from a PLACE WHERE
[1:32:40] THERE WAS BAD REPUTATION. CAN ANYTHING
[1:32:43] COME OF THAT PLACE? NO ONE COULD BELIEVE
[1:32:46] THAT SOMETHING PURE CAN COME FROM THAT
[1:32:48] PLACE. IN THIS TIME OF LOVE THIS YEAR,
[1:32:50] NO ONE COULD BELIEVE THAT WE COULD HAVE
[1:32:52] A BRIDE. BUT IT IS IN THIS TIME THAT GOD
[1:32:55] IS TAKING OUT THE MARY ONCE AGAIN TO
[1:32:58] SHOW HIS GLORY, [screaming] TO SHOW HIS
[1:33:00] POWER THAT SHE WILL MAKE IT. SHE WON'T
[1:33:03] FAIL. NOTHING WILL HARM HER. THANK GOD.
[1:33:06] [screaming]
[1:33:07] THANK GOD. [applause]
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; That's why I love him. because I was so
[1:33:15] unlovable in this TOWN IN THIS CITY. BUT
[1:33:18] HE came and he chose me from the PLACE
[1:33:20] WHERE I WAS. The angel visited me. He
[1:33:23] told me I'm favorite of my father to
[1:33:27] fulfill the prophecy.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to his name.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Therefore, nothing can harm not even
[1:33:39] death.
[1:33:41] For if the seed be planted, the water
[1:33:44] will raise it up again. Here is the
[1:33:46] secret of this. Now, here is the secret
[1:33:50] that the emphasis. Here is the secret.
[1:33:54] The word is in the bride as it was in
[1:33:57] Mary.
[1:34:01] Sisters, you're going to forgive me
[1:34:04] moment.
[1:34:11] A secret was inside.
[1:34:15] She's not like other people walking
[1:34:16] around and they don't see her like like
[1:34:19] a regular but the secret was inside.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; The word was in Mary.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Your secret, your strength is the word
[1:34:28] of God
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; inside of you. That's your secret.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Not outside. Not Isaiah just in the in
[1:34:36] the in in the letter for no Isaiah but
[1:34:41] inside of you now it becomes your
[1:34:44] strength she's working there the secret
[1:34:47] people didn't know but she knew what she
[1:34:49] was Bible say she was pondering on the
[1:34:51] things that she heard pondering
[1:34:55] because that's my strength
[1:34:57] I might go through trials but that's
[1:34:59] still my strength
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; amen sister sometimes you go when you go
[1:35:04] to the doctor being pregnantated by the
[1:35:07] word of God. That's your secret.
[1:35:10] Because once you are pregnantated by the
[1:35:12] word of God, nothing of the world can
[1:35:13] come. Because you already pregnantated
[1:35:15] by the word of God. PEOPLE CAN COME AND
[1:35:18] criticize the message, CRITICIZE YOUR
[1:35:20] CHURCH, CRITICIZE PEOPLE. YOU ARE TOO
[1:35:23] LATE. I'M ALREADY BEING PREGNANT BY THE
[1:35:26] WORD OF GOD. I'M STILL I'M [screaming]
[1:35:28] INSIDE. AMEN. NOTHING CAN COME.
[1:35:33] IT WAS HAPPEN IN THE TIME BEFORE BEFORE
[1:35:36] ADAM COULD COME TO TO EVE, she was
[1:35:38] pregnant. Now God is doing the other way
[1:35:40] around. NOW FOR MARY, BEFORE JOSEPH CAME
[1:35:42] TO MARY,
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; NOW MARY WAS PREGNANT BY THE WORD OF
[1:35:46] GOD. THANK GOD I RECEIVED THE MESSAGE OF
[1:35:49] THE HOUR BEFORE AI, BEFORE ANY OTHER
[1:35:52] THING, BEFORE. THANK GOD I'VE BEEN
[1:35:54] PREGNANT BY THE WORD OF GOD. NOTHING CAN
[1:35:57] CHANGE MY MIND. NOTHING CAN REVERSE ME.
[1:36:00] I'M DESTINED TO GO ALL THE WAY
[1:36:02] [screaming]
[1:36:02] BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PREGNANT BY THE word
[1:36:04] of God.
[1:36:07] People will come,
[1:36:09] why are you doing those things? WHY YOU
[1:36:10] DON'T SMOKE? WHY YOU DON'T DRINK?
[1:36:14] Why you dressing that way?
[1:36:18] The secret,
[1:36:20] I'm protecting the pregnancy.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; It's not the law, is it?
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; I'm protecting my baby.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; I'm protecting what I've received. It's
[1:36:29] part of me. If I do those things, I WILL
[1:36:31] DIE. SO, I'M PROTECTING WHAT I HAVE
[1:36:34] RECEIVED. AMEN. IT'S PART OF ME. IT'S MY
[1:36:38] STRENGTH. IT'S MY SECRET. I CHERISH IT.
[1:36:40] AMEN.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; And in other way, now you go further on
[1:36:45] and is it progressing? Is it
[1:36:47] progressing? Is it progressing? The more
[1:36:49] you eat the word of God, the more that
[1:36:51] word, that seed, small thing. Maybe you
[1:36:54] just accepted the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[1:36:55] true baptism has to be in the name of
[1:36:57] the Lord Jesus Christ. Maybe that's the
[1:37:00] only thing you receive at the beginning.
[1:37:02] Not many things. But I've been baptized
[1:37:04] in the name of the father, the son, or
[1:37:06] the holy ghost. No, that's not a true
[1:37:07] baptism. You have to redo it again in
[1:37:10] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Maybe
[1:37:12] that was that small seed that you
[1:37:14] received inside of you. But as you
[1:37:16] ponder it and it becomes more and more
[1:37:17] real, more and more real. It's growing.
[1:37:20] It's growing. It's growing. It's
[1:37:21] growing. It's growing. It's growing.
[1:37:23] Before people realize, oh yeah, you put
[1:37:25] on weight. What's going on? Oh, IT'S
[1:37:28] WHAT I'M FEEDING ON. WHAT I'M FEELING ON
[1:37:30] IS CHANGING MY LIFE. IT'S CHANGING MY
[1:37:32] WALK. IT'S CHANGING MY THINKING. AMEN.
[1:37:36] When I when I got the first first first
[1:37:38] child, you know, the the the fever of
[1:37:41] the first child,
[1:37:44] my wife really spoiled me. She was
[1:37:46] spoiled on that one cuz I I want to eat
[1:37:49] this.
[1:37:52] I buy it for her. I want this. Bye for
[1:37:58] sweetheart. Where are you getting those
[1:37:59] strange desires all of a sudden?
[1:38:05] is changing inside.
[1:38:07] Forgive me, sister. Right. Something is
[1:38:09] changing inside because of what I have
[1:38:12] received inside. Is changing my desires.
[1:38:15] I used to love the things of the world.
[1:38:17] Now I don't love them anymore. What
[1:38:19] happened? Something inside of me has
[1:38:21] changed. I've been pregnantated with the
[1:38:24] life of Jesus Christ. It's changing my
[1:38:27] life. IT'S CHANGING MY DESIRES. IT'S
[1:38:29] making me A NEW PERSON. AMEN. IT'S
[1:38:32] CHANGING EVEN MY WALK. AMEN. HE'S
[1:38:34] CHANGING MY DRESS. A pregnant woman
[1:38:37] doesn't dress tight things. No, you you
[1:38:41] you are protecting your femininity and
[1:38:44] you don't wear things that you you don't
[1:38:46] even know how to walk. I'll touch that
[1:38:48] on godliness one time.
[1:38:51] It's kind of pregnant woman doesn't
[1:38:53] respect yourself.
[1:38:55] But when the real woman, even a
[1:38:58] motherhood shows up, she becomes sweet.
[1:39:02] say she becomes soft and sweet. No
[1:39:05] wonder the bride of Jesus Christ the
[1:39:07] last day she's becoming sweet and lovely
[1:39:10] because she has been pregnantated by the
[1:39:12] word of God life of Jesus Christ. Can
[1:39:16] you imagine Jehovah God as a seed in a
[1:39:19] woman? [snorts]
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; The same thing JEHOVAH GOD taking the
[1:39:25] seed in that woman. The same thing in
[1:39:27] the last age. There's the word of God is
[1:39:30] coming seed in the womb of a virgin now.
[1:39:33] You and me. You and me. That's what God
[1:39:36] is doing in our time. And it's changing
[1:39:38] our lives. He's changing our our
[1:39:40] affections. He's changing the way we we
[1:39:43] walk. Amen.
[1:39:46] But on the other hand, you know what?
[1:39:49] People is making fun of her. S
[1:39:53] look at that one. She say
[1:39:57] no husband but regard she was hiding it
[1:40:01] now make fun of her.
[1:40:05] She go to trials and different things.
[1:40:08] Why? Because she's the promise of God
[1:40:11] being fulfilled.
[1:40:13] You might be persecuted. You might be
[1:40:16] going through trials. You might make fun
[1:40:18] of you. the things that give the
[1:40:20] blessings but the things that will
[1:40:22] brought more trials, more difficult
[1:40:24] things. The same for what we are going
[1:40:26] through. BUT AT THE END OF ALL IT ALL,
[1:40:29] THANK GOD ONE DAY I WILL GIVE BIRTH AND
[1:40:33] I WILL FORGET ALL MY TRIALS. I'LL FORGET
[1:40:35] ALL MY PAINS, ALL MY BIRTH PAINS. THANK
[1:40:38] GOD I'LL BE I'LL BE A NEW CREATURE.
[1:40:41] THANK GOD THIS BODY WILL BE CHANGED.
[1:40:43] [screaming] NO SUFFERING, NOTHING ELSE.
[1:40:45] IT'S WORTH IT ALL.
[1:40:47] THANK GOD. [groaning]
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; So she says
[1:40:59] the bride has the mind of Christ for she
[1:41:01] knows what he wants done with the word.
[1:41:04] She has the mind of how can you have the
[1:41:05] mind of Christ? Only through the word of
[1:41:08] God.
[1:41:09] The more you eat the word of God, the
[1:41:12] more you're having the mind of Christ.
[1:41:14] as we go to India there.
[1:41:18] I told them, "Oh, it's strange.
[1:41:21] I've not met you.
[1:41:24] The moment I meet a real believer,
[1:41:27] we just think the same way.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; We we we fellowship this on the same
[1:41:32] topics and the things like we met
[1:41:34] before.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME MIND.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE ARE TAKING FROM THE SAME
[1:41:40] SOURCE. THE MORE YOU FEED UPON THE MORE
[1:41:43] YOU BECOME ONE with it AND BECOMES THE
[1:41:45] SAME MIND OF CHRIST THE EVERYWHERE
[1:41:48] EVERYWHERE THE MESSAGE GOES IT PRODUCE
[1:41:50] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST IT'S NOT A MAN
[1:41:54] MANMADE SYSTEM GOD [screaming] WORD
[1:41:56] DOING THE WORK IN THIS LAST age
[1:42:00] you have the mind of Christ you think
[1:42:01] like Christ
[1:42:03] your opinion is like the opinion of God
[1:42:05] himself why because you have been
[1:42:07] feeding upon the word of God
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; important to feed upon the word of God.
[1:42:12] Brothers and sisters, it's our secret.
[1:42:15] That's why the secret is inside of you.
[1:42:19] Take the word of inside of you. That's
[1:42:21] the secret to overcome in this last age.
[1:42:23] The secret is the word inside of you.
[1:42:25] Revelation 10 8 to 11. TAKE THE WORD OF
[1:42:29] GOD, PUT INSIDE OF YOU, EAT IT UP.
[1:42:31] [screaming] AMEN. IT MIGHT BE SWEET IN
[1:42:34] THE CHURCH. SWEET AND WHEN IT BECOMES
[1:42:37] BITTER, BUT AT LEAST IT'S THERE. PUSH IT
[1:42:40] UP. STAY THERE.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; STAY THERE. YOU FEEL LIKE VOMITING.
[1:42:45] IT'S PART OF IT. IT'S PART OF BIRTH
[1:42:46] PAIN. THE PART OF IT. STAY WITH IT. KEEP
[1:42:49] WALKING WITH IT. AMEN. BECOMES HARD.
[1:42:52] KEEP WALKING WITH IT. IT will give you a
[1:42:54] body change one time.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Says
[1:43:02] she performs the command of the word in
[1:43:04] his name. For she has saved the Lord.
[1:43:08] She has not saved the Lord. We have that
[1:43:10] save the Lord. It's not a man's idea.
[1:43:15] It's that save the Lord. We did not have
[1:43:18] that save the Lord. If Eve had if he if
[1:43:22] Eve had used that save the Lord, she
[1:43:24] would have overcome. But now God has
[1:43:26] given us that save the Lord. Amen. Says
[1:43:29] now the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:43:31] and comes to pass. Like a seed that is
[1:43:33] planted and watered, it comes to full
[1:43:36] harvest serving its purpose. Those in
[1:43:38] the bride do only his will. No one can
[1:43:41] make them do otherwise.
[1:43:44] Thank God. NO ONE CAN MAKE THEM DO
[1:43:47] OTHERWISE. No matter how they pushed,
[1:43:49] no, they can't do otherwise because they
[1:43:51] have that save the Lord or they keep
[1:43:53] still. They know that it has to be God
[1:43:57] in them doing the works. Fulfilling his
[1:44:00] own word. It's not you. IT'S GOD DOING
[1:44:04] THE WORK INSIDE OF YOU. HOW DO YOU KNOW
[1:44:06] THAT? BECAUSE BY MYSELF I COULDN'T DO
[1:44:09] IT. BUT GOD IS COMING AND DOING THE
[1:44:12] WORK.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; WHAT I'VE DONE, I JUST ACCEPTED IT. ONCE
[1:44:16] I ACCEPTED IT, IT COMES AND MATERIALIZE
[1:44:19] INSIDE OF ME. THE SECRET OF ANY PROMISE
[1:44:21] OF GOD IS TO ACCEPT IT. You accepted it,
[1:44:25] then the word of God will materialize
[1:44:27] about what YOU HAVE ACCEPTED. YOU WANT
[1:44:30] HEALING, ACCEPT THE WORD OF GOD. HEALING
[1:44:32] WILL MATERIALIZE AROUND THAT WORD OF
[1:44:35] GOD. AMEN. YOU WANT SALVATION, ACCEPT
[1:44:37] IT. IT WILL MATERIALIZE AROUND THE WORD
[1:44:40] OF GOD. THE KEY IS TO ACCEPT THE WORD OF
[1:44:43] GOD. BELIEVE IT. GOD WILL DO THE REST
[1:44:46] FOR YOU. AMEN.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Say he did not complete. This is
[1:44:58] tremendous.
[1:44:59] This is God speaking to the
[1:45:02] wife, the bride
[1:45:04] that he loves you and me.
[1:45:07] Says God did not complete or Jesus did
[1:45:10] not complete all his work while in his
[1:45:12] first ministry, earthly ministry. So now
[1:45:15] he works in and through the bride.
[1:45:21] Through the bride, school
[1:45:25] through the bride. Jesus was not maybe a
[1:45:28] mechanic but today we have Jesus as a
[1:45:31] mechanic. Jesus was not a doctor but
[1:45:34] today we have Jesus as a doctor. Jesus
[1:45:37] was not
[1:45:39] an accountant but today we have Jesus as
[1:45:43] an accountant because he's doing the
[1:45:45] work through you
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; the glory of God.
[1:45:49] It says so now he works in and through
[1:45:52] the bride. He she he know she knows that
[1:45:55] for it was not yet time for him to do
[1:45:57] certain things that he must now do. But
[1:46:00] he will now fulfill through the bride
[1:46:03] the work which he left for this specific
[1:46:06] time.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; This is our time. The prophecy were not
[1:46:11] for the other age but this is our time.
[1:46:14] The more we stay in the word of God, God
[1:46:16] will fulfill that because it is the
[1:46:19] season for this specific time of the
[1:46:21] word of GOD TO BE FULFILLED. AMEN.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let me go quickly read
[1:46:28] some quote and then I will
[1:46:32] close give
[1:46:36] many things I could have thought of but
[1:46:37] it's it's good.
[1:46:40] Prophet just Mary's Mary's belief.
[1:46:42] Prophet says the Bible if there be any
[1:46:44] praise, if there be any virtue, think on
[1:46:46] these things. I think the reason we
[1:46:48] don't see no more of it than we do, we
[1:46:50] got our minds on too many other things.
[1:46:53] I think the angels will still appear to
[1:46:55] us if we only kept our minds upon them.
[1:46:59] But we are thinking about something
[1:47:00] else. That's where we are going. A
[1:47:03] certain program we've got to look at or
[1:47:05] certain shopping we have to do. But our
[1:47:08] scriptures tells us first the kingdom of
[1:47:10] God and his righteousness and all these
[1:47:13] other things will be added unto you.
[1:47:17] Unto you. Amen. Says another message.
[1:47:20] Jehovah of miracles says it's too bad
[1:47:23] that the church doesn't today walk in
[1:47:25] the spirit like that more than we do.
[1:47:27] For it's kind of a time where God comes
[1:47:30] to you says the trouble says trouble
[1:47:33] with the world. Today we are thinking
[1:47:35] about everything else but him. Then we
[1:47:38] wonder why we don't get blessings.
[1:47:41] Begin to think that you are one of his
[1:47:43] children. It says for that he saved you,
[1:47:46] that he's good to you, that you love him
[1:47:48] and he loves you. Don't just wait till
[1:47:51] you go to church or some convenient
[1:47:54] hour. Just keep him on your mind all the
[1:47:57] time. Think that he loves you, that you
[1:48:00] love him. Amen. Just keep thinking about
[1:48:03] that all the time. Praise be to God.
[1:48:07] says about when I set up some then he
[1:48:09] says he say begin to think it was there
[1:48:11] for the first time he came and declared
[1:48:13] the new ministry to me this is giving an
[1:48:15] example brother banham seen the life of
[1:48:16] brother banam great miracle or great
[1:48:18] thing that happened the third pull
[1:48:20] through him
[1:48:22] create a square speak the word of go he
[1:48:23] was thinking about the scripture of the
[1:48:25] word of god then the holy spirit came
[1:48:27] and oh you're thinking about that you
[1:48:29] know about mark 11 what about if you do
[1:48:32] you need something say yeah I need some
[1:48:34] scripture yeah speak the word of god
[1:48:36] that secret thinking about God's thing.
[1:48:39] Amen. God's word. Amen. Think about
[1:48:42] God's word. Great things will happen.
[1:48:44] You know, think of the translation, the
[1:48:46] ministry translation. You will think
[1:48:47] upon, oh, I'm getting old. I need to
[1:48:51] work for God now. I need to
[1:48:54] then the voice came. Do you want
[1:48:57] do would it would it do good to you if
[1:49:00] you see on the other side what it is?
[1:49:03] Says, yes, Lord, that would be good.
[1:49:05] Starting by thinking upon God.
[1:49:09] So now we have so many distractions. Now
[1:49:12] this year I'm busy busy busy busy busy
[1:49:14] busy but it's good sometime to stop
[1:49:17] moment. Oh God thank you for your love
[1:49:19] in my life. Thank you for the word. Lord
[1:49:22] I love you.
[1:49:24] That moment you continue doing what you
[1:49:26] are doing but still keep your mind upon
[1:49:30] God.
[1:49:33] It says
[1:49:35] were thinking on the scripture. That was
[1:49:36] the scripture that was confirmed to her.
[1:49:38] If you are sick, think on that
[1:49:40] scripture. If you are lost, think on
[1:49:43] that scripture. If you want the Holy
[1:49:45] Spirit, think on that scripture. No. And
[1:49:49] the Holy Spirit will confirm it to you.
[1:49:52] Amen. So think about any any issue, any
[1:49:55] situation you're going, take the word of
[1:49:57] God, think about it, re accept it,
[1:50:01] receive it. The word of God will
[1:50:03] materialize upon the scripture. Amen.
[1:50:12] Just keeping safe time here says um
[1:50:17] but that little girl didn't have
[1:50:18] nothing. She never questioned anymore.
[1:50:22] His word was enough for her. If the
[1:50:24] church could just get like that the word
[1:50:25] set the word settles it. If God said so
[1:50:28] that's all we need to know. How is it
[1:50:30] going to be? I can't tell you. But if
[1:50:32] God get said so, that's going to be that
[1:50:35] way. Amen. Mary had to believe something
[1:50:37] that never happened. We've got thousands
[1:50:39] of examples of divine healing. Look at
[1:50:42] the people's been healed with cancer,
[1:50:44] blindness, dumbness, deafness, all kinds
[1:50:47] of sicknesses and diseases. We've got
[1:50:48] plenty of that to look at as examples.
[1:50:51] But this little girl didn't have nothing
[1:50:53] but just his word. And that was
[1:50:55] sufficient. His word was good enough for
[1:50:58] her. The word of God is good enough for
[1:51:01] us. We don't want need anything. We just
[1:51:03] need the word of God. Then he says in
[1:51:05] Jehovah of Jer, give us more Marys Lord
[1:51:09] around here that can take God at his
[1:51:11] word and praise him whether you feel it
[1:51:14] or any whether you feel anything or not.
[1:51:17] Take him at his word. God is trying to
[1:51:20] find somebody will take his word. Mary
[1:51:23] didn't have anything she could put.
[1:51:25] Elizabeth, I'm feeling something. No,
[1:51:27] she just testify about the word of God.
[1:51:29] She prophesy about the word of God. Then
[1:51:31] it will came to pass. Amen. Says by
[1:51:35] taking his word changed Mary's belief.
[1:51:38] Changed his whole natural course of life
[1:51:40] for her. It will do the same thing for
[1:51:42] you.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; If he did for her, it will do the same
[1:51:45] thing for you. Mary had to believe the
[1:51:48] impossibles. God takes the impossibles
[1:51:50] and makes them real when he's taken at
[1:51:53] his word. The doctor might have said
[1:51:55] you'll never get rid of that cancer. The
[1:51:57] doctor might have said you'll never be
[1:51:58] able to walk again. Well, it's
[1:52:00] impossible for you to do it. But
[1:52:02] impossible fades out when God's taken at
[1:52:05] his word. No matter what the doctor
[1:52:07] says, he's go is doing the best HE CAN.
[1:52:10] BUT GOD IS GOD. AMEN. AND his word is
[1:52:13] just like he is. If you take his word,
[1:52:15] that settles it forever. If you can't
[1:52:18] believe, you can't believe. Say to this
[1:52:20] mountain, "Be moved." And don't doubt in
[1:52:21] your heart. you will believe what you
[1:52:23] have said will come to pass and you can
[1:52:25] have what you said. Amen.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; I just want to read what the prophet
[1:52:29] says here about the mystery of
[1:52:32] translation and then be closing.
[1:52:35] Um
[1:52:38] it's it's one of my favorite go but I
[1:52:40] always get missed somewhere but give me.
[1:52:45] Yes. So the question and answers are 64.
[1:52:47] I think I need to put it in a different
[1:52:49] color so I know. Um, so it says they
[1:52:51] asked the prophet what explain to us the
[1:52:54] mean the mean the the the the
[1:52:57] secret of the explain to us the secret
[1:53:00] of the translation. Explain the mystery
[1:53:02] of the translation of the bride. It says
[1:53:04] Abraham he was looking for a promised
[1:53:06] son that was promised. Romans 4. Is that
[1:53:08] right? And the church is looking for a
[1:53:10] promised son. The bride is is that
[1:53:12] right? The bride is looking for the
[1:53:14] promised son. And it says we cannot
[1:53:17] receive the promised son that is
[1:53:18] promised us today in this body that we
[1:53:20] live in. These bodies are sin. Romans
[1:53:24] 7:18. For I know in that in my flesh
[1:53:27] dwelleth no good for for to will is
[1:53:30] present with me and how to perform which
[1:53:32] is good I find not. The first conscience
[1:53:34] control this body with taste with see,
[1:53:37] taste, feel, smell and hear. It's just
[1:53:39] as God all screwed up. We reason and
[1:53:42] everything else. But the new body that
[1:53:44] comes from this born again, not this
[1:53:46] first conscience will pass out. It's
[1:53:48] that inside something that lives. It's
[1:53:51] not the outside here. Taste, feel,
[1:53:52] smell, and here it is in it's subject to
[1:53:54] death and life. But the inside part of
[1:53:57] you down in here inside is the person
[1:53:59] that cannot die.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; The new birth is the word of God
[1:54:06] revealed to you personally. is the word
[1:54:08] of God born with the seed uncorruptible
[1:54:11] seed of the word of God inside of you.
[1:54:13] It says but the inside it's subject to
[1:54:15] death. The inside some the it's that
[1:54:19] inside something that lives.
[1:54:22] It says it's not the outside the it's
[1:54:25] the outside subject to death and will
[1:54:27] die. But the inside part of you down in
[1:54:29] your inside that is the person that
[1:54:31] cannot die. See that's the person that
[1:54:34] the new life starts from from this new
[1:54:36] birth. And it builds another person in
[1:54:39] the image of this person that you are
[1:54:42] around that life. You get it? So
[1:54:44] potentially it's here what it is. The
[1:54:47] word promise before the foundation of
[1:54:49] the world and around there the only
[1:54:51] reflect the negative that reflect the
[1:54:53] positive the word and the translation of
[1:54:56] the bride will be the same thing. The
[1:54:58] word that in in you the body will
[1:55:00] materialize around that word.
[1:55:04] It could not materialize around in other
[1:55:06] ages. But now the full word of God has
[1:55:09] come. And when you receive it, the
[1:55:12] translation will start by materializing
[1:55:15] around that word of God that you have
[1:55:18] received.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; That's the secret. Just take the word of
[1:55:21] God inside. Take the word of God inside.
[1:55:24] Take the word of God inside. It will
[1:55:27] give if it will give us the body change
[1:55:30] how much more for the natural thing that
[1:55:32] we are going through the secret. Take
[1:55:34] the word of God make it real inside of
[1:55:36] you. Do you love the Lord?
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Let's give a hand to the Lord.
[1:55:41] [applause]
[1:55:47] For behold, I show you a mystery. We
[1:55:49] shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
[1:55:51] changed in a moment, in the twinkle of
[1:55:54] an eye, at the last trump.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; That scripture is our scripture.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; And it's being fulfilled every day as
[1:56:02] you receive the word of God. It's
[1:56:05] becoming more and more real. And one day
[1:56:07] it will be a quick change.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God.
[1:56:15] Let the words be born.
[1:56:27] It's good. We thank God for the message
[1:56:29] we have received. It's a tremendous word
[1:56:32] of God that can never be changed. Amen.
[1:56:35] Brother, we can prepare this slide as
[1:56:37] well as we sing that song.
[1:56:49] can sing. Maybe I feel the pool. I hear
[1:56:51] the word. Do you know that song?
[1:56:54] You know it. Okay. If you know it, then
[1:56:56] we sing it.
[1:56:58] Let the world
[1:57:01] be born
[1:57:03] in the manger of
[1:57:11] God.
[1:57:24] And the word be born
[1:57:27] in a manger
[1:57:30] of my
[1:57:35] oh let your word
[1:57:41] in the manger of
[1:57:46] let it live.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Let's just give us a prayer the Lord.
[1:57:53] inside this house of pain
[1:57:57] and it
[1:58:02] let your word.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Do you know the verse? You know the
[1:58:12] verse is
[1:58:32] Now think about you and me.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Just a simple man, just a simple lady.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; That's the scripture being fulfilled.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Lord, this my desire. Let your word
[1:58:49] be born
[1:58:51] in the manger [singing] of my [music]
[1:58:53] heart.
[1:58:56] Let it live with me. Let it [singing]
[1:58:59] die
[1:59:03] inside this house of
[1:59:08] morning every day. [crying]
[1:59:12] There's a worthy Lord
[1:59:15] in the mangerly
[1:59:29] [singing]
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; like that little Mary.
[1:59:39] What [singing] if I just heal this
[1:59:41] vessel
[1:59:43] and let him have his way?
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:59:50] Hallelujah.
[1:59:53] Hallelujah.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord
[2:00:00] of my heart.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, let it [singing]
[2:00:05] me. Let it
[2:00:09] start
[2:00:11] [music]
[2:00:12] [singing]
[2:00:15] and mold it every day.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Let your word be
[2:00:23] in the manger
[2:00:25] of my heart.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Can each one of us just pray to the
[2:00:30] Lord? Father,
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, I accept your word. I receive your
[2:00:35] word.
[2:00:36] Let your word be born inside of me,
[2:00:40] Jesus Christ, in the simplicity of my
[2:00:43] being. I just want to accept your word.
[2:00:46] Father, no matter what I'm going
[2:00:48] through, you have shown your love
[2:00:50] towards me. Accept what the prophet has
[2:00:53] told me just to think about the word of
[2:00:55] God. How you love me and how I love you,
[2:00:59] Lord. Father, Lord, I give my heart to
[2:01:02] you. Let your word be done to me. Let it
[2:01:06] be done to me according to your word,
[2:01:08] Father. Father, we have declared, Lord,
[2:01:10] that I will come. I have an overcoming.
[2:01:13] There is an invisible pride. Father, I
[2:01:16] accept your word. I believe your word. I
[2:01:20] will believe what the word of God says
[2:01:21] about me more than what my feeling tell
[2:01:24] me, what my symptoms tell me, what my
[2:01:27] thought tell me, what the circumstances
[2:01:28] tell me. I go by faith. Father, give me
[2:01:32] the faith of Mary to believe the
[2:01:35] impossible. To believe, Father, beyond
[2:01:37] the natural, to believe beyond the
[2:01:39] ordinary, Lord, you are God. God is God.
[2:01:43] Father, Lord, I accept you. I love you,
[2:01:46] Father. I desire to think more of you.
[2:01:49] Thank you for giving me your potential,
[2:01:51] son. Thank you for giving me your Holy
[2:01:53] Spirit. It's not by mind. It's not by by
[2:01:56] power, by the Holy Spirit moving inside
[2:01:58] of me. Father, I just want to accept
[2:02:01] your word to go step in the channel.
[2:02:04] Father, because this is a specific time
[2:02:06] for the word to be made flesh, the word
[2:02:09] to be fulfilled, the word to be made
[2:02:11] real. Lord, I open my heart to your word
[2:02:15] and I accept you, Father. Remember your
[2:02:18] bride in this little congregation,
[2:02:20] Father. God, Lord, I put the word in
[2:02:23] front of the people, Father. Lord, it
[2:02:25] has challenged to accept the word.
[2:02:28] Father, you'll do the rest, Father. It's
[2:02:30] not my word. It's not a man a word of a
[2:02:32] man. It's not even a word of a father of
[2:02:35] a prophet. But is the word of God
[2:02:38] himself. We have thus say the Lord. Not
[2:02:41] even that save the prophet, but that
[2:02:43] save the Lord. Thank you Lord for that
[2:02:46] save the Lord. We accept it. We believe
[2:02:49] it. We receive it. Father, you know the
[2:02:52] needs among us. Need of healing, Father.
[2:02:56] need for a touch, need for our Lord for
[2:02:59] our walk, a closer walk with you. But we
[2:03:02] accept your word, Lord. Despite our
[2:03:04] weaknesses, we look to your word and
[2:03:07] believe it and accept it and want to
[2:03:10] live. Bless your people, Father. Give
[2:03:13] them the desire of the heart. Pray in
[2:03:15] the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:03:18] Amen.
[2:03:27] people
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; in the manger of our heart.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Let
[2:03:35] me [music]

[2:03:51] Let your word be born
[2:03:54] in the manger
[2:03:57] of my heart.

[2:05:47] [singing]
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; The pull I felt was more
[2:05:55] [music and singing] than I could bear.
[2:06:02] And I was on the verge
[2:06:07] of giving over
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; the strength within myself
[2:06:17] just [music]
[2:06:23] keeps holding me.

[2:07:04] My dear sisters, this is not [music]
[2:07:06] feeling well. Just commit the Lord in
[2:07:09] prayer. Let's pray together. Ignite our
[2:07:11] faith. We anointed her with oil to
[2:07:14] fulfill God's promise. As he said,
[2:07:17] someone sick all the elders and anointed
[2:07:20] her oil
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; and the prayer of faith shall save the
[2:07:25] sick. Not it might but it shall
[2:07:29] according to God's word.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; So let's pray together.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Precious heavenly father Lord Jesus
[2:07:35] Christ as we have proclaimed your word
[2:07:38] your word there is healing word there is
[2:07:40] salvation.
[2:07:42] Father dear sister Sharon has come for
[2:07:45] words. I'm not feeling well I'm sick.
[2:07:48] Father Lord you are still the healer.
[2:07:50] Still the same yesterday today and
[2:07:52] forever. Father Lord, we are claiming
[2:07:55] what you already done on Calvary that by
[2:07:57] your stripes is already here.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Father Lord,
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; God, we anointed her with oil confirming
[2:08:06] confiring to your word, Father. Lord,
[2:08:09] you said the prayer of faith shall save
[2:08:12] the sick. Father, may she recover, Lord.
[2:08:15] May she walk healthy, Father. May you be
[2:08:18] with her, Lord. And we give you the
[2:08:20] glory and the honor, Father. Lord, even
[2:08:22] now Lord, we are claiming that she's
[2:08:24] already healed according to your word,
[2:08:26] Father. Lord, we say shall lay hands on
[2:08:29] the sick and they shall recover. We're
[2:08:31] laying our hands upon you according to
[2:08:33] your word, Father. May she recover in
[2:08:36] the name of Jesus Christ. This demon has
[2:08:38] no authority upon her. He's already been
[2:08:40] defeated. Satan, you have already lost
[2:08:43] the battle. Jesus Christ already
[2:08:44] overcome you on Calvary Street. So leave
[2:08:48] your dirty hands from my dear sister in
[2:08:51] the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:08:54] Amen.
[2:08:56] God bless you.

[2:11:54] Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; And we thank you this morning. We praise
[2:11:57] your holy name. Lord, thank you, Lord.
[2:12:00] Thank you, Lord, that you made us
[2:12:01] partakers, that we were able to eat the
[2:12:04] Lord,
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; and to demonstrate and manifest the word
[2:12:08] of God in its beauty. We thank you this
[2:12:10] morning. We worship you. We adore your
[2:12:13] wonderful name. We love your name. Name

[2:12:23] give you all the praise in Jesus name.
