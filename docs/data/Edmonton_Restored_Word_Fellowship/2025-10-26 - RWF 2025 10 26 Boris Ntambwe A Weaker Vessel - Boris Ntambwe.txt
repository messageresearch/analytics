Description:
Brother Boris Ntambwe is the pastor at Mount Zion Tabernacle in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. This sermon is entitled "A Weaker Vessel."

In this sermon, Brother Boris shares a message about marriage and relationships, drawing from old stories in the Bible like Adam and Eve's creation. He starts by reading from Genesis where God makes Eve from Adam's rib, and Adam calls her part of himself. He then refersto a letter in the Bible advising husbands to live wisely with their wives, treating them with respect as the more delicate partner, so their family life stays strong. He thanks the church for the music and invitation, and prays for everyone to feel real change and joy in their lives. The main idea is that marriage isn't just about two people—it's a picture of deeper connections, like how people relate to something bigger than themselves.

He explains that true love isn't just a feeling; it's a way of acting with patience, kindness, and selflessness. He says if you really care for someone, you look after them like you do your own body—feeding, protecting, and cherishing it. In marriage, this means both partners sacrifice for each other's happiness, without selfishness. He points out that many problems in relationships come from deeper personal issues, like bad habits or attitudes, not just surface stuff. Instead of arguing or giving up, he suggests praying for your spouse to help fix those inner problems. Love should cover all parts of a person: body, mind, and heart. If it's only physical or emotional, it's shallow, like enjoying something without real commitment.

He uses the Bible to describe women as naturally more tender and easily hurt, needing gentle handling and protection from life's roughness. This isn't a flaw they chose; it's how they're made, and it serves a purpose. Men, seen as stronger, have a responsibility to shield and support their wives, just like standing up for them in tough times. Ntambwe shares stories from old tales, like Adam protecting Eve ...

[Music] Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you. And um as I was talking to Pastor Moses, I told him I you know when I was uh back in Winnipeg knowing that I was coming this way and um before even that you know some message start coming up on my heart and I thought maybe this is what God wants me to to share with you and it was kept on coming and taking note and taking note and taking note and I came prepared here knowing that uh Saturday I'll lay my foundation and Sunday I I'll I I'll finish the message but for some reason um things have changed completely and and know God taking me into different direction &gt;&gt; and uh you know when I was last night was very difficult. I have so many messages. I changed my message I think three times last night praying out to the Lord. What do you want me to say this morning? Oh God, &gt;&gt; you know it's not easy. It's not easy. Um because he's the one who knows. We don't preach to impress people. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; And we don't preach for people to to to to know that we know something. &gt;&gt; No, it really to address the needs and to make sure that as you come to church, you can go home and say, "Truly, the Lord has spoken unto me." and uh something that can help us in this journey. We know all of us. We are in this journey in this pilgrimage. We need encouragement. Uh we need somebody to hold our hands and to walk with us, you know. And it's so wonderful to know that we have a friend and his name is Jesus. &gt;&gt; And um so um this um this morning I was thinking to bring a message. I brought this message a long time ago. Um but I trying to take another angle a little bit today. Um my message this morning is a weaker vessel. So let us stand and I appreciate all the uh the special songs and beautiful voices here. God rich you bless you s leaders and &gt;&gt; musician. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Yeah and um we are going to go to Genesis chapter 2. I also want to express my gratitude to all of you to pastor Zcloud for uh making it happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh I uh I really appreciate the confidence that you placed in me to be back again here. &gt;&gt; Thanks so much. um Genesis chapter 2 verse 21 um which I just read um so I get verse 21 to um 20 what I say just chapter 2 yeah 21-23 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept. And he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof. And the rib which the Lord had taken from a man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called woman because she was taken out of men. May the Lord bless the reading of the word. &gt;&gt; I want to make sure I have my time here so I don't go over. Let us pray. Our gracious heavenly father, we thank you for your love and grace, for the breath of life you've given us this morning to come into your house, Lord Jesus. Father, today the whole world is commemorating the resurrection of Christ. But as we've come to your church uh to church, Father, this morning, we just don't want to commemorate your resurrection. But we want, oh God, you to manifest the proof of your resurrection in our midst that you are the risen Christ who can touch hearts, who can heal our bodies and heal our souls, transform things around us. Oh God, give us joy and peace, oh God, through this journey. Mighty God, we are calling you on the scene. Come and take over the service. Take me aside. Lord, I'm not a good preacher, but you be Lord the preacher this morning. Mighty God, let beyond the voice of a mortal. Lord, they may hear the still small voice, the voice of the Holy Spirit speaking directly to their hearts. Oh father, bless the pastor and appreciate the invitation, Lord. May you be with us, oh God. And we dedicate the service in your hand. In the blessed name of Jesus, we have prayed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. And we are going again to turn our Bible in uh 1 Peter chapter 3:7. Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel, and as being hes together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we used to read these scriptures when we're in denominations and different things, but by God's grace, he sent us a prophet. And with the opening of the word, &gt;&gt; we we know that one of the mysteries that God was to reveal for us in this hour was the mystery of uh the church as um the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh we know that that mystery brother Brandham refer uh to Ephesians chapter 5 verse 28 where the Bible says so ought to men to love their wives &gt;&gt; as their own bodies. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I preach a lot to marriage is that I like this subject so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the whole Bible is about marriage. &gt;&gt; Redemption is about marriage. The Old Testament, the New Testament, marriage. The sun and the moon marriage. Hallelujah. the heaven and the earth, woman and wife. So redemption, our relationship with God is tapped as a tapped as a as a marriage relationship. Israel and and God is as is as marriage as well. So marriage is the whole story of the Bible. &gt;&gt; And the Bible opens up with marriage. &gt;&gt; Then the Bible closes with marriage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So there's no way you can you can escape. &gt;&gt; So when you're talking about marriage, we are talking about redemption. We are talking about our own lives with Christ. Amen. So it says here, "So ought men to love their wives &gt;&gt; as their own bodies." You know, I always tell people, if you love your body, you take care of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You feed it, you buy some lotion, some stuff, and you know, you make sure that everything goes well. So in love there is care. &gt;&gt; Because you love your body, you take care of it. So love is to to take care as well, you know. And um he that loveth his wife loveth himself. &gt;&gt; For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth &gt;&gt; even as the Lord the church. &gt;&gt; So they're saying the Lord does the same thing for the church. &gt;&gt; Now keep in mind that our marriages they are just a partial realization &gt;&gt; because it's a shadow. &gt;&gt; Our marriages are not the true marriage. The true marriage, the uh perfect realization of marriage is the marriage of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we all in this relationship of marriage, we are just trying to to be a partial realization trying to portray Christ as the husband in the house and the woman trying to portray Christ uh the church as a wife in the house. Amen. So we are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones. Amen. For this cause shall man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they too shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery. And but I speak concerning Christ and the church. So spiritually speaking, the church is always represented by a woman in the Bible. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the me what shall I do with Christ? Jesus preached in 1963. But I'm saying this, the church is always, &gt;&gt; not sometimes, &gt;&gt; always &gt;&gt; represented by a woman cuz the bride of Christ is a woman. Even was the even Oh, sorry. Eve was the one fell. She's the one to be redeemed. And the church is what is a woman that is redeemed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that wonderful? Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, many times, one time I there's a young lady at work and I asked her, "What is love?" And she show she told me, "Love is a feeling." I said, "Love is a feeling." I I said, "I don't I don't think love is a feeling." And one day I preached at church. I said, "Love is a character." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the book of Corinthian, not me. &gt;&gt; Love is patient. Love is this. Love is this. Love is this. Love is this. So love is not a feeling. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; If you say you have love, you have a character. &gt;&gt; That character is called love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I said, well, when you say you love somebody, what do you love? You say I love you. What is you? Because you is uh Bam told us that and the Bible says we are a three-fold being. You have a body, you have a spirit, you have a soul. So your body has the five senses. Your spirit has also five senses. &gt;&gt; And your soul has only one sense which is either faith or unbelief. &gt;&gt; Now when you say I love you, what do you love? You love my body. &gt;&gt; If you love just my body, it be like you just love chicken. &gt;&gt; Hey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's ask chicken if the chicken loves you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The chicken said, "No, that guy, I don't love him." &gt;&gt; Because for him to love me, I have to make a supreme sacrifice. Give my life that may love me. So if you love chicken, &gt;&gt; the chicken doesn't love you. &gt;&gt; It is selfish love. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a love that is looking at your own interest. &gt;&gt; And many people when they get married, a lot of marriages, love is only at two dimension. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; The body. And if the body is what can keep a marriage, why do we why do we have divorces? &gt;&gt; Good question. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you may say, well, he's an engineer, all that guy. He's a nice guy, hardworking person. That the level of a spirit, &gt;&gt; your ability to work, to understand, to analyze, you are using your five senses. But most of the problem that we have in our relationship is the third level, &gt;&gt; the depth of your being. It's your soul. Because your soul is your nature, your behavior. All the behavioral issue is at the level of the soul. But the Bible says he that loves his body take takes care of it. &gt;&gt; So if you love you take care &gt;&gt; and love is not receiving. By the way, many time you hear people, you don't love me. &gt;&gt; You don't love me. Why? Oh, I love you, but you don't love me because I asked you this. You You didn't do this for me. You didn't do this for me. So, people think love is receiving. &gt;&gt; If you are hungry and I I give you $5 to buy a loaf of bread, you did you that received the $5, you did not express love. I'm the one who has expressed love by giving it. &gt;&gt; Love in all aspect is always giving. &gt;&gt; You get to give something. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. &gt;&gt; So in other word something that you have &gt;&gt; but you have to give to the benefit of the person that you love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other word love is a sacrificial. &gt;&gt; If you say you love somebody, you are ready to make sacrifices. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no place for selfishness. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you if you do if if you are still selfish, you are not ready for marriage. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Because marriage is really to deny yourself. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; You invest your whole being to the for the happiness of the person you are living with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is not one way. It must be two ways. &gt;&gt; And husband and wife both doing the same. &gt;&gt; So when we see most of the issues that we have in marriages are behavioral issues. M &gt;&gt; I don't like the way you talk to me. &gt;&gt; I don't like this. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. You know, but we get to the point where we forget the principle of Christianity. &gt;&gt; That God say in the book of Leviticus that I giving you the blood, the life that is in the blood to fix the soul, to repair the soul. If you know that you are sick and you can go to a doctor to fix the problem. So if you know that this other person has the same sickness or has an issue then you have to take that person to the same doctor. &gt;&gt; If you have experienced salvation and you know there's somebody who can transform the soul of a human being that the blood of Christ is more powerful &gt;&gt; to transform and to change that you can go on your knees and pray for your wife. &gt;&gt; You can go on your knees and pray for your husband and come out with a testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. People don't want to do that anymore. Oh, I'm not your mom to teach you life. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I want somebody to pray for me. If you love me only when I'm lovable, &gt;&gt; then anybody can love me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you love me because I give you candies, then anybody can love me. &gt;&gt; But I want to be love when I'm unlovable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody can tell me, you know what? No matter what you do, I still love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll be there for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I call it 3D love. You know we have a 3D movie. &gt;&gt; The movie can be two 2D or 3D. &gt;&gt; And but they say in the 3D it has the depth. &gt;&gt; So for me I call a 3D love is where there's a depth. You have you have reached the depth of love because the Bible say you shall love the Lord your God with your whole being your body your spirit and your soul. So love love has to cover the all areas of your life. &gt;&gt; If you I I was talking to to to my one of my nephew. I said well you God has blessed your dad. You have money you travel. You go all over the place. Now tell me what the difference between you and the other guy whose father says has money, buy cars and do everything for the children. How can you say that you being a a Christian couple, you are different from a non-Christian couple? &gt;&gt; What makes you different? &gt;&gt; There must be something making you different &gt;&gt; because if it's just the body and the spirit, you're not different from the &gt;&gt; non-Christian couples. But there's something about us &gt;&gt; that above this flesh, above everything, we love the soul. &gt;&gt; I want the soul to be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you love the soul, you have reached a the depth of love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when you have your children, you can buy them, gift them, do everything that you can. But many people they are rich. They take already kids. They take them to Mexico. They have fun on the beach, different thing, nice cars and good heritage and homes and different things. But they've neglected the soul. &gt;&gt; They've never taken them to church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They've never taken them to Sunday school. &gt;&gt; So that love is just a two-dimensional love. &gt;&gt; But if you really love your children, you want to bring them to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you want to take care of all aspect of their life, &gt;&gt; their body, their spirit and their soul. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So love is sacrificial. &gt;&gt; You have to sacrifice something. You have to sacrifice your time. You have to sacrifice your energy. And that's what Christ did for the bride. He said, "Love your wife as Christ loved the church and gave himself for that church. Everything that he was, &gt;&gt; he poured out for that church. &gt;&gt; He emptied out himself &gt;&gt; for this church to be happy, for this church to be delivered, for this church to be protected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you see, Christ is the perfect realization. But we being here in uh in this partial realization, we still have some flaws, you know, &gt;&gt; but we are so thankful to God we have an unconditioned covenant. &gt;&gt; We can always repent and get back to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the what I'm saying in in a question answer said he made the buried spirit for the man and made the tender little delicate feminine spirit for the women. So when God created Adam, it was both male and female. So in other words, the tender and the buried spirit were together. Are you there with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then God say, "It's not good for a man to be alone. I'm going to make him a helpmate." So God separated the burly spirit from the tender part. So when the burly and tender part were together they were it was such it was it was so complimementaryary that there was no way the fall could have happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then God separated the burly spirit from the tender spirit. &gt;&gt; But sometime we read words in the message but sometime getting into the definition of words gives you more understanding. &gt;&gt; What does it be? Does it mean a tender spirit? So the woman was created weaker. It was not a choice. Eve did not become weak after the fall. It was the way she was brought. In other words, it was not her choice. &gt;&gt; Because all other females they came different &gt;&gt; from her. So it was not her choice. &gt;&gt; No, I want you to be spiritual as I'm talking now. &gt;&gt; Remember I'm telling you I'm talking about you as the woman. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. I'm a man. Oh, you are you at the church? You are a woman. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So the woman, it was not her fault. It was not even her choice. She was just a victim of circumstances that she did not choose. &gt;&gt; It was not her desire to become that way. It was God's own decision for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until when the purpose was fulfilled, God knew that that the reason why I made her this way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the purpose of God was to cause the fall. But say God created that way to cause the fall. So God was the origin of the cause of the fall. &gt;&gt; He was able to make it in a way that the fall would have never happened. &gt;&gt; But he wanted to express his attribute as a savior, as a healer, as a redeemer. But for he has to do something. &gt;&gt; Now those attributes could be manifested. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's so wonderful. God sent a prophet. Don't you feel that way too? &gt;&gt; Because we understand we can't complain. &gt;&gt; Now the body of a woman is weaker. We know that. And um men physically they have an advantage over a man of a women. you know they they have stronger most strength and they can uh have a um endurance and you know you cannot see uh in a in a box uh a man competing with a woman you know it can't it can't work. You can't see in a football a female uh uh team with a male team. They don't put them together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the world agrees because they don't put them together. &gt;&gt; We are built different. Our bodies looks different. We have different roles in life. &gt;&gt; Even though today we have some crazy things happening in the world. &gt;&gt; One man said, "No, I'm a woman." &gt;&gt; And I'm going to be in the in the NBA of women. And then they say, "What? He's she is or she I don't know beating up everybody. And then all the women complain. They say no no no no &gt;&gt; she is not a woman. &gt;&gt; We refuse. &gt;&gt; And then they have to change. They have to require that the person must be a woman from birth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, if you you say I'm a trans man, that's fine. Let me bring Mike Tyson &gt;&gt; and put you there. &gt;&gt; Competition. It'll take you to the hospital. &gt;&gt; We are different. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not, we are different. We are built different. &gt;&gt; As I'm talking about this, think about Christ and you. &gt;&gt; We are built different. &gt;&gt; He is the stronger vessel. We are the weaker vessel. Amen. &gt;&gt; He cannot require man to deal with woman in a certain way if he himself who is in the perfect realization can do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see that she's also weaker in her spirit because she has a tender spirit. Uh because uh um tender means here um easily distressed, readily made uneasy, a tender conscious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see there's more advertisement and it takes all the ladies in there. I was looking at some statistics and even product advertised for men. &gt;&gt; Over 60% of product advertised for men are bought by women. &gt;&gt; If you they take women off the malls, business will go down. &gt;&gt; That's true. That's true. I agree. &gt;&gt; They are holding the economy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If I go to uh Canire, I just go inside. 5 minutes I'm out. &gt;&gt; But my wife can go there. Daddy just milk. Milk. Okay. She goes for milk. She's coming out with so many bags. And you say it was just milk. How come you have so many bags? You're coming out. No, I needed this. We needed this. We needed this. We need this. So we are built different. &gt;&gt; We don't see the same thing. &gt;&gt; You can tell me look at your head it's square. &gt;&gt; Your head is square head. Everybody don't care whether my head is square or round or triangle. As long as I live I'm fine. But you go and tell a woman you have a square head. She'll spend her whole life looking at the mirror. What are the four corners of my head? Because she has a tender pride. She can be broken. She want to be praised. She wants something to tell her, "You are beautiful. Oh, I love you. You are so nice." You know, because they have a tender pride, they can be easily broken. This is us the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Easily broken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that the sacrifice that are pleasing unto him is a broken heart, a contrite spirit. If you're easily broken, you can come out to him crying. No. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You tell a woman, "I love you, she cries. You say I don't love you, she cries. &gt;&gt; The same way when Jesus come and tells me he loves me. &gt;&gt; I can beat my hands out. Oh God, thank you Lord. Oh father, I love you. Thank you for what you've done for me. &gt;&gt; And he's happy &gt;&gt; to receive my praises. &gt;&gt; And when I've done something wrong, I'm broken in my heart. I cry unto him, "Oh God, I'm so sorry. This is me. You are a woman brother and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know she's not she a woman is made in a way when they say she's tender. She must be handled with care. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can tell you there's so many things in the Bible we can talk about here. &gt;&gt; There are so many things. So she has to be handled with care. You can't just do whatever you want &gt;&gt; with her. That's right. &gt;&gt; You must know the Bible say deal with her in knowledge. &gt;&gt; In knowledge. &gt;&gt; You just don't I don't care. I don't care. No, you have to care. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to care. &gt;&gt; If you don't care, you'll be in trouble. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is very important. You know the Bible says that man will will answer for his wife &gt;&gt; but not the wife to answer for the man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So it puts man in a position of responsibility. When he said you are you are going to answer that means there are some responsibility that God is going to look at &gt;&gt; and if you fail he say you have failed to this &gt;&gt; because you're going to answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So if he can ask that to the man, &gt;&gt; God himself has to take responsibility of his bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He cannot ask a man to do that in a partial realization. When he himself in a perfect realization, he can't do it &gt;&gt; because you are here just a shadow &gt;&gt; of the perfect realization. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, she she she's physically weak, not able to endure hardship. So, she needs to be shielded from harsh labor and the roughness of life. That's what Christ is doing for you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, they are easily broken, you know, and they can easily be influenced as well. The church easily influenced when when we're talking about the woman, you look at the church as a congregation. &gt;&gt; Just to look at the church, you as an individual, &gt;&gt; they all have the same characteristics. Easily influenced. Why did you buy this? We don't need it. It was on sale. Does it mean that everything that is on sale, we have to buy? Easily influence. They 50% of daddy. It was 50% off. I just bought it. Oh, but we don't need it. But it was 50% off. &gt;&gt; That's the reality of life. &gt;&gt; But you have to deal with them in knowledge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Are you there with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So men means strong strength, ability to fight. &gt;&gt; So when both were together, the devil could not do anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But one day the woman went to meet the devil without the burly one, &gt;&gt; without Adam. And then she was deceived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the church does. When you meet the devil &gt;&gt; without your second Adam, &gt;&gt; the revealed word, &gt;&gt; you are going to be defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you are always staying with the second Adam, the revealed word, you are bound to victory. &gt;&gt; He's shielding you. He's protecting you. But even when she did that and she made a mistake, yet Adam as a protector, &gt;&gt; he stood between judgment and Eve. &gt;&gt; They say, "I give my life for her." &gt;&gt; I don't know if there are men ready to give their life for the wives. I don't know. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says about the Bible says that men should love their wives like Christ loved the church and he gave his own life for for for for the church. I said, "Brother, I have I don't know yet if I'm able to give my life for my wife. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God." You can see that the meat church age. Let us go back to the beginning. In the original of physical creation as we know it today, God made everything in pairs, male and female. There was two chickens, rooster and hen. There were two cles, the cow and the bull. And right down the line, but when it came to men, there was only one. They were not a pair. Adam had been made in the image of God. He was a son of God. As a son of God, he could not be tempted and fall. &gt;&gt; That would be impossible. So God took a byproduct of men to cause the fall. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God came to Adam, Adam, Adam, where are thou? Oh, I'm hiding. Why we are naked? Who told you are naked? is did you eat of that food I forbid you to to eat? Yes. Why did you do that? The woman you gave me. God could not debate that. It was not me who gave you women. Yeah. Yeah. I'm the one. Yeah. Actually, &gt;&gt; you made all other female different. You made her that way. And God knew that the purpose was being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; It's hard to believe &gt;&gt; but that's the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He came to the woman. Why did you do this? You made me a weaker vessel. &gt;&gt; With the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life. I saw the the fruit was good for flesh. My pleasant to the eyes. Increase knowledge. The pride of life. You made me thus and the devil deceived me. Uh-huh. Okay. When he came to the serpent, he didn't ask a question. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Why did you do that?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Because you've done that, &gt;&gt; you are going to be cursed." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Woman never stepped fresh from the hands of God as a true product of God. She was produced from men. And when God caused her to be brought from to bring birth forth from men, she was vastly different from the other females he had created, she was able to be seduced. No other female in creation can be immoral, but the human female may be touched at almost any time. And that weakness in her allows Satan to seduce her by way of the serpent and has brought the woman to a very peculiar position before God and his word. She is the type of all things vulgar, foul and lossome and the one on on the one hand and on the other hand she is the type of all things clean and beautiful and holy and the respectable of the spirit and blessings of God. On the one hand she's called the war who is drunk with the wine of her fornications. On the other she's called the bride of Christ. One hand she is the mystery Babylon, the abomination before God. On the other hand, she's called New Jerusalem, our mother. On the one hand, she's called, she's so foul and wicked and lwd that she's seally cast into the lake of fire as the only fit place for her. And on the other hand, she's exalted to heaven, sharing the very throne of God as the only place befitting such a queen. &gt;&gt; Is that wonderful? &gt;&gt; So God knew that a woman needed protection &gt;&gt; by the burly one. So Adam was the image of protection. I told you how Adam stood between Eve and judgment. Not only Adam did that but even Abraham when God when uh Sarah laughed and God said why did Sarah laugh and then Sarah said no I did not. She made God a liar and both of them said God could have killed Sarah right there. &gt;&gt; But Abraham stood between Sarah and judgment. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm so happy to know that Christ is standing between you and judgment. &gt;&gt; He knows that you're a weaker vessel. &gt;&gt; You'll make mistake. You made them yesterday. You'll make them today. You'll make them tomorrow. &gt;&gt; But it's standing between you and judgment. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here it says this. Um I I'm just going to be very fast so I can get to my message. Amen. &gt;&gt; So um in the message of marriage and divorce said paragraph 110 also there is nothing that can be so easily deceived as a woman. Now the fault proves this statement to be true. The fall in the beginning. So when they say there's nothing that can be easily deceived as a woman. Don't look just at the woman in the natural even in the spiritual. Look at the things that is happening today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; People are so easily deceived. Church are easily deceived &gt;&gt; by all kinds of doctrine and things and nonsense. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Easily deceived. &gt;&gt; People believe anything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the reality. &gt;&gt; This is we women as a church. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So because she was a victim of circumstance, God cannot blame Eve for being weak because it was not her desire. &gt;&gt; It was not her choice. It was God's own choice. It was not your choice to be weak. Hallelujah. If you could have shaped your life by yourself, you could have designed your life the way you want to be. You could have decided before you were born, I want to be born this tall, this big, this way, that way. You can define what you want to be. Unfortunately, it's beyond your control &gt;&gt; and you find yourself unable to do whatever you can. You are a victim of circumstances. But God cannot blame you for being a victim of circumstances. You know, I used to go and preach in the Stony Mountain to the uh uh the inmate there and I was telling God will never blame you for for being a murderer because most of the people I was visiting, they were sentenced to life. That mean they have taken somebody's life. You know, they've been sentenced to life and it was very unfortunate. You meet people there that have been in prison since you you were born. They spent like over 50 years in prison, 60 years in prison. It it just make you feel so bad. And um but I said you know what it doesn't matter where you are. Salvation is not described by ge geography where you are but you can be saved here in prison. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said I said whatever you did there you were you were a victim of circumstances but God has a way provided to take you out of those circumstances and Christianity is overcoming the circumstances of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because God has made a way of escape. &gt;&gt; God will never condemn you because you are a thief. &gt;&gt; God will never condemn you because you're a prostitute. But when he has provided a way to take you out of prostitution and out of theft, then you refuse the way provided by God, then God will condemn you for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So to refuse to receive him as your savior &gt;&gt; for your the forgiveness of your sin, then you have rejected salvation. Then you are going to die &gt;&gt; in your sin. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So when you're a victim of circumstances, God doesn't blame you for that. But God has provided a way to put strength in the weaker vessel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He has provided a way to put strength. The Bible say in Ephesians chapter 3:1 16 verse 21 verse 16. So Ephesians chapter 3 16 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory &gt;&gt; to be strengthened with might by the spirit in the inner man. So God has provided a way to strengthen you inside to become stronger. Uh and and said that the riches of God to strengthen you. It comes in the form of a letter by a messenger. When you see the message, they give you books of the message. It's a letter that has the riches of God. &gt;&gt; You have to break it. You have you you have to get in and get the riches. Not just knowledge of quotes but the riches that are in those quotes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are there to give you victory. Glory to God. So I'll give you a few examples here just for you to understand what it means um to be a weaker vessel because sometime when you give example that people can easily relate. &gt;&gt; That's right. In the book of Job, I we said it yesterday. Uh uh Job chapter 2:9. Um the Bible say here, "Then said his wife unto him, do thou still retain thy integrity? Curse God and die." But he said unto her, "Thou speakest as of one of the foolish women speaketh. What shall we receive? Good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. So you can see that Job's wife could not handle the hardship they were going through. It was too much for her. See, why don't you just kiss God and forget about it? You know, well, it can happen. Why don't you just give give up and forget about it? &gt;&gt; But Job was there to give strength. And we're happy to know that Christ is there all the time to give us strength. &gt;&gt; Even when we ready to do something, it just prevent us from not doing it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to take my life. I'm going to hold this power line. I want to die. You touch the power line. Nothing. &gt;&gt; I want to kill myself. Nothing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's still there keeping you. &gt;&gt; You're not keeping yourself. He's the one keeping us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not holding yourself. is the one holding you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we see here um coming down here this what I was so like today what says in the message possessing all things and the angel with his back turned to the tent said where did Sarah laugh and she denied it. Now that's telling God to his face that he's wrong. See that would have took her life but God couldn't take Sarah because she was part of Abraham. &gt;&gt; See and she was in the covenant with him. So she had to go with him and he could not take Abraham or take Sarah without taking part of Abraham &gt;&gt; for these two are one. &gt;&gt; And bam continue said a beautiful type of us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. unworthy &gt;&gt; worthy of death when we sin. But God cannot kill us &gt;&gt; because he will we are part of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's our grace. Amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we are in union with Christ. Isn't that beautiful thought? Union with Christ. So therefore, our sins when we do them, we ought to quickly confess them that they are wrong because God would take our life. But the blood answers in our place and God just can't cross that blood. He just can't do it because it's a promise that won't do it. So he can't break his own promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being a weaker vessel, God can't tell you everything. You can't tell your wife everything. Somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; I I haven't heard a lot of amen here. &gt;&gt; Some people they make their wives a dumping station &gt;&gt; where they bring all their frustration, everything and all the everything they go through in their life just dump and dump and dump. You need to protect her. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; She needs to be protected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen here. I'll give you an example. Say when God spoke to Abraham, he said, I can imagine it was on a Sunday afternoon after he spoke to him maybe on Monday. How is he going to do it? He said, take thy son Isaac and go and offer him in sacrifice. Burnt sacrifice, burnt offering. So po Isaac, he looks at him. gave me image. It was the only son that Sarah had. She waited for so long. Baby Isaac, oh, you're so cute. I love you. Come to mommy. Stay here. You come and say here, Sarah. God spoke to me. What? What? Relax, relax, relax, sir. He God said we should offer Isaac, kill him, burn. What? And when you going to do it? Tomorrow. Okay. I think by the time they wake up in the morning, Sarah and Isaac would have disappeared already in the house. But I'm say here, he loves him. But I can't look at that. I got to think of obeying God. So he couldn't tell Sarah &gt;&gt; because you know the ladies are the weaker vessel. &gt;&gt; So you sometime you have to watch. I can't tell Sarah because she wouldn't understand. God cannot tell you everything you can't understand. &gt;&gt; You are a weaker vessel. God cannot tell you know when you get married your children will have such issues. Your husband will be like this in 10 years or in 25 years. Then what you going to do? You say, "Oh, if this the case, I'm taking a different route." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he wants you to walk by faith. &gt;&gt; You you are walking in into the unknown. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't know what the future hold. &gt;&gt; You say, "I know the maker of the rain." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know who holds the future. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He holds tomorrow. &gt;&gt; I'm concerned about today. Tomorrow will take care of itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God doesn't give you those details. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the time God called uh called Abraham? Who knew that Israel will go through everything that they went through today? &gt;&gt; But they've never lost the covenant. They may have lost some joy, some battles, but they are still loved of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You may lose some joy. You may lose some battles, but you are still beloved of the father. &gt;&gt; The covenant is still there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And what say here in Job? Sarah never was too strong anyhow in the faith because she lacked she disbelieved the promise. But Abraham held her because the man and the woman are one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm so happy to know today that it's not my faith. He knows that I'm weak. &gt;&gt; He knows that I'm going to fail. But he brings in his own faith. &gt;&gt; He brings in his own virtue. He brings in his own patience. He brings in his own temperance. He brings in his own godliness. He brings in his own brotherly kindness and his own love to put strength in me &gt;&gt; because I'm weak. &gt;&gt; He knows that there's nothing in me to overcome. He said without me you can't do nothing. &gt;&gt; I am the vine. You are the branches. &gt;&gt; Life must come from me divine for you to bring forth fruits. &gt;&gt; Otherwise you'll never do anything good. &gt;&gt; I'm a weaker vessel. &gt;&gt; That's that's why I like the song. I am weak but thou are strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus keep me from all wrong. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you see, there was another woman in the Bible whose husband was supposed to protect, but he did not protect. That was Ahab. His wife Jezebel loved loved him so much. But Ahab saw the field of Nebat. He said, "Oh, he asked neighbor, can you give me your field? I want to buy your field." I said, "No, this is the inheritance of our family." &gt;&gt; You know the laws of inheritance to give it to you. That means it's old generations, &gt;&gt; they're going to be deprived, &gt;&gt; so I can't do that. And Ahab was frustrated. The Bible say he went home. He refused to eat. He was in the bed turning and she did it. Then Jesus became sweetheart are you okay? No. What's wrong but what did you do? You refused to sell me feel. Uhhuh. Aren't you the king of Israel? I'll take care of it. And what did she do? She killed Nebot. And when the prophet came, he said, "Ahab, you have killed neighbor." &gt;&gt; If he would have protect his wife knowing she's a wicked vessel, &gt;&gt; huh? You tell her everything that brother told me this, that brother said this about me, this one, this, this, the next time that person comes home, no juice, no water. &gt;&gt; No coffee. Who's responsible? &gt;&gt; You. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you go and tell her everything. &gt;&gt; You thinking you think she had the same strength like you. &gt;&gt; So God cannot come tell you everything &gt;&gt; because he knows that you don't have the same strength like him. &gt;&gt; That reason he can just keep you walking by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Walking by faith. &gt;&gt; Walking by faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said now here um in the me in the sarra church age because as we read he said you must dwell with them in knowledge. So when a man lives with a woman, you know, you might say, "Will my wife is she's in my hands like this. I know how to make her happy. I know how to calm it down. I know how I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. When she's unhappy, I know I know how to fix it. When she's she she's happy, I know what can make her happy. And if I go out, I bring a gift, she'll be very happy. And you know you can do it. If you refuse to do it and I'm not going to do it, no, no, no, no. There's something wrong. A man should know because the Bible said you should deal with the woman in knowledge. Like Christ, he stands in the midst of the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; He say, I know. I know. I know your trials. I know your problems. I appreciate you when you do this. I appreciate when you do that. Even the way he's talking to the church, even when he has to blame the church, he start by appreciating them for the good works. I appreciate them then. But I have something against me when you do like that. You know, one day these are things that happened when we I had just get married. We're there by one year of marriage or something. something happened between my wife and then I was was uh upset and I was happy and I said I'm not going to eat you know men they have those kind of a behaviors you know is that true &gt;&gt; is that true &gt;&gt; brother is that true &gt;&gt; you don't want to answer that's fine I say I don't want to eat now if you say you don't want to eat make sure You don't eat. Don't stop at Morton or at McDonald's or anywhere. Then when you come home, you change your face. I'm not eating. If you say you're not eating, don't eat. So you say I'm not eating and then oh I think long time I haven't seen this brother. Let me go and see. Oh brother, how you doing? Let's go and have a coffee. You go but you know you are going for coffee or something because you don't want to eat at home and when you come back home you change your face become serious because you want to maintain the atmosphere and that's happened to me and then as I was going out like I was talking to somebody speaking to my heart why aren't you eating? I said because I'm disappointed I said you're disappointed with who? with food or with your wife? I said disappointed with my my wife. So you have any problem with the food? I said no. See, eat food. I'm telling the truth, brother. &gt;&gt; One thing I want to tell you, I believe that God speaks today. &gt;&gt; Because we have our our our mindset is so polluted with the spirit of the age. Even Hollywood has polluted our mind &gt;&gt; because they gave all the they make movies of uh of uh of all Bible characters. &gt;&gt; And when you see the movie of Abraham, they tell you how God was Abraham, Abraham, take thy only begotten son and going to sacrifice him. And people knew that God spoke to Abraham with an audible voice. But the prophet say God spoke to his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was still small voice. trust me &gt;&gt; asking him to go and sacrifice &gt;&gt; in the third pool there are there small voice there too &gt;&gt; and that's the small voice you don't need to be filled with the Holy Ghost to hear it &gt;&gt; because what I'm saying whether you are a believer or not God speaks to everybody &gt;&gt; sometimes people think it's their own conscience you know sometimes you can be there something just tell you move this glass from here &gt;&gt; and you neglect it then you did a mistake it fell on the floor or oh boy something told me to remove it. What is that thing that warns you? &gt;&gt; God speaks all the time. But there it says it's still small voice, &gt;&gt; but we are so overwhelmed by other voices and other things that we are unable to listen to God. But God still speaks today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I believe he still speaks. If he can speak to the unbelievers, how much more do his own children? &gt;&gt; If you can just stay quiet and listen to him, he will speak to you. &gt;&gt; What Bible said, before you do any wrong, God has to warn you. &gt;&gt; But many time people don't yield to the warning of God. &gt;&gt; They get mad want to do something, but God spoke to me. You a Christian, just leave it alone. Oh no, I got to tell them. They got to know. And then you move on. But God did speak to you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God spoke to me that day. You know, one day I was driving. I was in um it was winter and it was it was dark. I was by myself and um it was a um on a highway, but because the the words were not really good and it was there was a it's not a blizzard, but it was snowing and uh something I was just by myself in the car. Something spoke to my heart. Slow down. I said, "Slow down. I'm by myself. Slow down." I didn't. I continue on. Slow down. I slowed down. I slowed down without knowing why. And I started looking around and just as I was slowing down completely down, I saw a big herds of deers crossing before me like that. in the whole village. I say, "Oh, God, thank you." But God spoke to me. &gt;&gt; God speaks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has spoken to you many times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't say God never spoken to you. &gt;&gt; In every situation, he speaks. &gt;&gt; But the only thing is people don't take time to listen. &gt;&gt; When somebody come to see pastor, pastor this situation say what did God tell you? anything anything that come to your mind anything no thinking of this or but right there God spoken to you this is the word &gt;&gt; I can't tell you more than that amen &gt;&gt; so God speaks so when he spoke and I say since that time I always eat food there's nothing such as don't eat food anymore &gt;&gt; hallelujah So God bless you. He said here now the Lord God Almighty says I know &gt;&gt; you think God doesn't know you. &gt;&gt; You think he doesn't know your problems? &gt;&gt; He said he asked the man to deal with the woman in knowledge. You must know everything she's going through. &gt;&gt; Amen. But even says where she going through a menopause, how you should you should uh deal with her and you know and how many he has given so many advices how we should take care of our wives &gt;&gt; because many times in the message people try to focus on women women but they don't talk much about men. They don't talk much about men, but men are the problem too. &gt;&gt; Because if a man is really established in the scriptures, &gt;&gt; she he is going to stabilize the wife &gt;&gt; because he has the fear of God in his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows what God is expecting of him as a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we a man stand at the place of Christ for his wife, his wife would say, "God has given me a man after my own heart." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm telling the truth &gt;&gt; because you realize as the head, you are actually a servant. &gt;&gt; The Bible say he that want to be big, let him be a servant. That's right. &gt;&gt; If you cannot serve, you're not ready &gt;&gt; for marriage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm I'm I'm the head. Man is the head. What does it mean is the head? &gt;&gt; Who gave you that authority? &gt;&gt; He that gave you authority, do you have authority above him? &gt;&gt; No. God never given anyone authority without measure, without limit. Nobody. Even the sun has much power but respect God's law. &gt;&gt; If it comes just closer we all burnt. &gt;&gt; It doesn't further we all frozen. &gt;&gt; The moon lots of power but respect God's word. The power is controlled by the perimeter of God's laws. God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even a police officer, &gt;&gt; if he has authority to stop a car, a big truck, a semi-truck, or to arrest you, his his authority is bound by the constitution. &gt;&gt; So if he goes beyond that, &gt;&gt; he can be sued and put in jail and arrested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He when somebody is is using power over the limit &gt;&gt; that is given out to him, they call him a dictator. Amen. &gt;&gt; An abuser &gt;&gt; is abusing power. &gt;&gt; So God can even even the church when they say the pastor he he has full authority. It has limitation. It's controlled by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when they say parents you have to the children need to obey to their parent. The Bible say parent make sure you don't uh uh anger your children. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There are limitation in everything. God cannot give you authority without measure. &gt;&gt; But how many people know the limitation, the perimeter of the authority? If you know it, then you know who you are. &gt;&gt; If you don't know it, you can be an abuser. &gt;&gt; You're abusing authority. &gt;&gt; Huh? But if you stay in a position of a real man, the wife, she has no other church. She's going to praise her husband. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One time I was preaching a denomination church in Winnipeg, they asked me this question, what do we do? Because it was we have a lot of people that came like immigrants and said, "What do we do? We have a uh uh women, wives when they come here, they take all the child tax benefit money. They don't share with their husband. How can we handle this?" I told him, I said, "Go on your knees, pray for them, for God to deliver them from selfishness." Everybody start laughing. But if you're a Christian, you know how to fight. Use the means that God has given you to fight. &gt;&gt; People don't spend much time on their knees to pray for one another anymore. It debate and debate and argument and things but nobody takes time to stay in prayer for mercy. Lord, do something for this man. Do something for my husband. You gave me this man. Oh God, I'm claiming me under the blood. Deliver him. Oh, father God. &gt;&gt; Like Rebecca in the Bible was praying for uh uh Zakias to know the message of the hour &gt;&gt; and God changed the man and he believed the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you don't see those kind of people anymore. But how how do you say you love a person when you can't take care of their soul and taking care of their soul, you have to make a sacrifice the behavior that you don't like, God can change it. &gt;&gt; But unless you see you're no longer a Christian, you don't believe that God can do it. &gt;&gt; But we believe in the supernatural. &gt;&gt; And when you pray, don't expect the result today. &gt;&gt; Have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even if after you pray the things happen tomorrow, say, "Lord, I've already prayed. I committed in your hands. Take care of it. God will do it. &gt;&gt; You got to come out with a testimony. Lord, thank you. &gt;&gt; In this age, I have overcome. &gt;&gt; Not by might, not by power, but by Christ. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I know. I know. There he is walking in the midst of his people. There he is, the chief shepherd of the flock. But does he hold back the persecution? Does he stem the tribulation? No, he does not. He simply says, "I know your tribulation. I know your challenges. I know your problems. I'm not at all unmindful of your suffering." But said, "What a stumbling block to this is to many people like Israel. They wonder if God really loves them. How can God be just and loving if he stand by and watches his people suffer?" That is they ask in Malachi 1:3, the better of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. I have loved you, said the Lord. Yet we say, where is thou hast loved us? Was not Esau, Jacob, brother? Said the Lord. Yet I love Jacob. I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. He said, you see, they could not figure out God's love. &gt;&gt; They thought that love meant no suffering. &gt;&gt; They thought that love meant a baby with parental care. But God said that his love was elective love. The proof of his love is election. That no matter what happened, his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation. &gt;&gt; God did not choose you in time. It before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; The bottom say he know he knows you the way he knew you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he may commit you to death as he did Paul. He may commit you to suffering as he did Job. That is his prerogative. He's sovereign, but he's still all with purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he did not have a purpose, &gt;&gt; then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace. &gt;&gt; His purpose is that after we have suffered a while, we will be made perfect, &gt;&gt; be established, strengthened, and settled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one who knows how to make you perfect. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not perfection according to your eyes. &gt;&gt; I was saying yesterday, I said, can you imagine the same God who protected uh uh uh Daniel in the lion's den, he closed the mouth of the lions. &gt;&gt; The same God who protected the Hebrews children from the fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. The same God in the church ages you could see the saints being fed to tigers and lions &gt;&gt; and he never done anything &gt;&gt; but they are overcomers &gt;&gt; so the way the overcomer is looked is not the way you look at the overcomers. You would think oh God has delivered Daniel he's going to deliver me. No, for you tonight. The de the lion is going to eat you. &gt;&gt; Oh no, they're going to burn me. Oh, he has saved Shadrach, Mesha, Abednego. I'm going to stand up. This fire is not going to burn me. You are going to be burned. But that was what God was doing at that time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we I'm so thankful because Bam said at the opening of the seventh seal, God will be known, &gt;&gt; his ways, &gt;&gt; who he is, how he does things, that you, his children, you may not be in confusion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It say in plain language, the very character of Jesus Christ was perfected by suffering. I'll just go here something before I I go to my last uh part here that I'm going to finish. He said in the message church age. Now this special condition in Simra must be applied to every age said there is no age free from it. There is no true believer free from it. This is of God. This is the will of God. It is needful. We need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be Christlike in doing it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No matter the Bible say that count it as a joy all the trials and everything you go through, he knows that you're a weaker vessel. He has to protect you. Don't think he's dealing with you without knowledge. He knows. I know what you go through. I know your problem. Is he taking it away? May he doesn't take it away. He knows what he's doing. He has a purpose. If he's not doing for a purpose, then he's the author of frustration. In every church age, look at the John to the seventh church age. He said, "Peace and grace be upon you." Is it taking away problems? No. the church that was the the with the the Christian um um persecution and everything but it said peacemen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And grace be upon you. &gt;&gt; He say I will give you peace not the way the world give peace. You may go through problems, challenges, but you have peace with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And even Paul, all the epistles, grace and peace. &gt;&gt; Grace and peace. &gt;&gt; Grace and peace. It doesn't mean that there's no problem. Even to the correction, grace and peace. But it was the troubled church. many problems, division, separation. One has taken his father's wife, a different things, competition, a gift and everyone, everybody want to speak with tongues. But say grace and peace be upon you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Grace and peace be upon you each one of you. &gt;&gt; It does not mean that I'm going to take away the challenges of life. But you see that he that endureth to the end, &gt;&gt; say the quitter never wins. And the winners never quit. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; But God has a way of doing it. He told Abraham here in Genesis chapter 17 verse one. And when Abraham was 90 years old and nine, the Lord appeared to him and said unto him, I am the Almighty God and walk before me and be thou perfect. In the message El Sharam said, and God appeared to him again. And when he appeared to him this time he appeared to him in the name of almighty God. The Hebrew word there is is El Shia which means L means God the strong one. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From Genesis 3 the strong one. L God the lifegiver. Shadi Shad. Shad mean breast like the woman. Shadi means breasted plural. And God appeared to Abraham in the name of the strong breasted one. What to what a thing to appear to an old man aund years old. His body as good as dead after he had made him a promise that he was going to have a baby with his wife Sarah and her 90. Think of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Abraham, he was already weak in his body, but El Shadia, &gt;&gt; he gave strength to the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't only give strength to the body, even to your spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he's the braces God. &gt;&gt; Weaknesses of the flesh and weaknesses of the spirit, he gives strength. &gt;&gt; I am the Lord God that health thee from all thy disease and forgiveth all thy iniquities. We used to sing I am the Lord that he &gt;&gt; I am the Lord that save my soul that save your soul. So he I will love this. I'm going to finish with this. So in every station of Abraham he has been strengthened by God. Maybe you don't see it but God is giving you strength. &gt;&gt; God is fighting for you in a way that you don't see. He said here in the message question and answers of 1964 it's exactly with Luther Wesley and down to here just exactly how he has dealt with the churches like he did with Abraham God is dealing with the churches he's dealing with you as he did with Abraham how he appeared how that there when he confirmed the covenant to him under the shed blood it was Philadelphia age yes sir that was the blood age Luther the western age but the when the we watch the pentecost also age after he come to there he made the promise to of El Shari nurse from me the question is can you nurse &gt;&gt; h &gt;&gt; can you nurse can you take strength from me are you ready to nurse for me and take strength or you don't want because I'm willing to give you strength &gt;&gt; come to me I'm shar &gt;&gt; you are tired &gt;&gt; you have lost hope your body is is completely weak but I'm El Sharia. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was brought before the Pentecostals. You see, can you nurse? But they didn't do it. They grabbed a breast from the denomination when they were come out. But the seed, real seed come on to nurse that breast. Are you the real seed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; El Shadia. Now what promise? Abraham, you are old. Your strength is gone. And for the last 25 years, you've trusted me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the last 25 years, you have trusted me. Since you came to the message, for all this time, since I gave you the promise, you have trusted me. You believed me. So many things happens, ups and down, but you did not give up. &gt;&gt; You stayed with me. I'm so happy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You trusted me. But now I want to tell you what my name is. My name is the breasted one. The strong one and breasted God. Now watch. Not a breast God, but breasted both for the spirit and body. Wounded for transgression and with his stripes we were healed. &gt;&gt; The breasted one, the strong one, the strength giver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is here tonight. this morning, right now he's here, &gt;&gt; giving you strength. &gt;&gt; Do you want to take his breast &gt;&gt; and get some strength or you don't want? He said the believer nursing from the word, the breasted one, the new testament and the old testament nursing from God promises. That's where you draw your strength. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God has given us the word and it takes God promise of healing, salvation, whatever it is, he's laying on the bosom of God just as satisfied as it can be. Glory to God. And he said, Abraham, you are old. Your strength is gone. Your arms are withered up. Your men, God, but I am your mother. &gt;&gt; Amen. God said to Abraham, Abraham, I am your mother. God present himself to Abraham as the mother. I am your mother just take a hold of my promise and be satisfied. While you are waiting, be rested. Now, that's the way every believer. No matter how bad the cancers got you, how long you've been sitting in a wheelchair, any of those things, just if you can grasp that revelation from God, then be satisfied knowing that is going to happen because faith waits patiently for the promise. &gt;&gt; One time I preached this message was a sister had cancer. I didn't know that. She came to the prayer line. She said, "Lord, you are the strength giver." It was her faith. &gt;&gt; I didn't know, but she believed. Amen. &gt;&gt; She came and God healed her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We had a sister in our church that she had a uterus uh um cancer and it was so bad and she went through so many chemotherapy and so many things. It came to the time they say she's going to say well she's she's dying and you know I I said Lord I was just walking walking in my room praying Lord no I was in a different state. I decided I took her to church and uh her son, my wife, I said, "Let's go and pray to God all night." She was very weak. I said, "But just stay in the couch. We're going to pray." And for some reason, I just said, I say, "You know, there are things you say in prayer and under the anoint, you don't know what you're saying." I said, "You'll be a testimony of God's grace." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then it was so bad. She was in pain every day. You know, I can't just give much details, but people know what it means. She was suffering at a level I can't just describe. But I told her, I said, "Sister, no matter how you feel, keep coming to church." She'll come to church. She come just sit there. The toilet is right beside you here. anything just go and come back and they did the chemotherapy the radiation and they done um biopsy they say wow when we went to the hospital they said no cancer is still there I just give I say you know you see those thoughts of healings just repeat them over and over and over repeat them over and over the more you repeat it the more you believe it more you believe it the more you repeat it the more you repeat it the more you believe it and and one day your body is going to obey to your profession. I said, "Repeat those words. Repeat, repeat your the healing." She kept on repeating and repeating and repeating. I went to the doctor and they said, "Oh, we have to sign a document here because uh uh we I I told him I said, "What if it's everything changes? What? Oh, it won't change. We are 99% convinced that it won't work." We said that's fine. So they did the biopsy two times and then they called they said you know what there's no more cancer in her body. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The sister who was unable to walk she's not walking &gt;&gt; unable to eat. She's not eating. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She's doing everything normal now &gt;&gt; than what it used to before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is El Sharia. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not going to take those things away, &gt;&gt; but he want to reveal his attribute &gt;&gt; through our weaknesses. &gt;&gt; How many are we this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many can say, "Lord, I'm weak, &gt;&gt; but thou are strong. &gt;&gt; I've come to you, El Shad. &gt;&gt; Lord, give me strength. I can't keep on going without you. I can't even make one step. I can't even walk without you, Lord, holding my hands." Let us stand and just speak it in your own own words and tell him Lord give me strength as the pastor comes. [Music] I'm weak but thou strong. I am weak but thou art strong. Jesus keep me from all be sisfied as long &gt;&gt; as the walk. As we walk close to thee, &gt;&gt; just a closer walk with me. &gt;&gt; Oh, granted Jesus is my plea. &gt;&gt; Oh, daily walking close to thee. Oh, let it be, dear Lord. Let it be. &gt;&gt; Let's sing verse one once again. Oh Lord, I am weak, but thou are strong. &gt;&gt; Jesus, keep me from all. I'll be sisified as long as I walk. Let me walk close to thee. &gt;&gt; Oh, just a closer walk with thee. &gt;&gt; Is that your desire this afternoon? &gt;&gt; Granted, Jesus is my plea. Oh, daily walking close to thee. Oh, let it be, dear Lord. Let it be for this world. Oh, through this world of toils and stairs. If I falter, Lord, who cares? &gt;&gt; Who with me my burden shares? Oh, none but thee, dear Lord. None but thee. Just a closer &gt;&gt; just a closer walk with me. &gt;&gt; Closer walk with me. &gt;&gt; Granted Jesus is my plea. &gt;&gt; Daily walking close to thee. Let it be, dear Lord. Let it be. &gt;&gt; Did you love the message this morning? &gt;&gt; Let's give a hand to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Pastor Boris has a way to bring the message that is just so nice. He knows how to go and then just filter and then come to the level where we are. Oh, thank God for that. Thank God for that. Sometimes we want to be too strong. &gt;&gt; But you know when when we are strong when we think we are strong when we think we are strong we can handle things ourselves that's where we fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Eve thought that she she she she had the greater revelation than Adam that she has figured things out on her own. That's where she failed. When the church think that can live by itself without God, that's where we fail. When we leave the word of God, that's when you fail. But when you recognize, Lord, I only depend on you. I make mistakes. I have failures and things happen in my life. I have trials and but God I depend on you. You are the strongest one. Let me just feed from your breast. Let me just feed from your strength. That's when we have the victory. Amen. Can we pray all this this this this afternoon? Lord, give me the strength. Let me stay where my strength reside. Don't let me go out of the place where you can give me the strength. Is that the desire of your heart this evening? I want to hold your hand. I want to keep holding your hand. Let's pray all together each one in his own way. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you once again. God, the Bible has become a new book for us, Lord.

And we have a place of refuge where we can find our place is in Jesus Christ, the strength giver, El Shadai. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for your word. Praise be to God. You know, as a as the church, we we are the weaker we are the weaker vessel. &gt;&gt; And God knows it. God knows it. He knows that you have your ups and downs. And he knows it. The most important thing, he knows. &gt;&gt; As the brother put it so well, he knows. Sometimes you don't know, but he knows. And he's leading you. is guiding you. Think about it. The three-fold purpose of God, he he accomplished one part in Jesus Christ. Why didn't accomplished when he was still God? One part he accomplished in Jesus Christ in a weaker position than than being the father because Jesus Christ didn't know at some point to say I don't know everything. The father has to reveal it to me. Then I do the work. But God was fulfilling his purpose. And now in the bride. So the other part I will have preminence in the bride. Why the bride is not the strongest part the strong? Why? Why God choose the strong the weakest place? Why? To show his purpose. But he chose it to be so. So that his attribute all the glory can be placed to him. But what we have to have is attitude. Lord, I depend on you completely. Help me to stay faithful. Help me to continue as that was the theme that God put in his in his heart. Whatever happens, you stay faithful. &gt;&gt; You stay faithful. You continue to come to church. You continue to serve the Lord. You continue to to be faithful. Your husband is hard on you. You stay continue be obedient to God and be nice to him. is the the the wife maybe is not hard on you. You continue to be obedient to love her unconditional love. You continue to be a Christian no matter the circumstances. That's was the burden that God put on his heart. He changes not change completely. No, no matter the situation you are going through, stay faithful. Sister Grace, sing that song for us. Help us to sing that song.

It's only when you realize that you are weak, then you are ready to be used by God. God, help us to understand that we depend completely on you. Depend on one another, too.
