[49:23] Amen.
[49:24] Another scripture also found in Genesis
[49:27] 25
[49:29] 20 and 21.
[49:32] Genesis 25 2021. And Isaac was 40 years
[49:37] old when he took Rebecca to wife, the
[49:40] daughter of Bethwell, the Syrian of
[49:43] Pedan
[49:46] Raman, the sister to Lebanon, the
[49:49] Syrian. And Isaac inreated the Lord for

[50:07] upon the reading of his word.
[50:09] Amen.
[50:10] You may be seated please.
[50:21] So may the Lord bless you.
[50:23] I am from India, Punjab, brother Roshan
[50:27] and uh my wife and our son Titus is with
[50:31] uh me this time. So we are enjoying our
[50:35] time here and enjoying the great
[50:39] hospitality of dear brother Simon and
[50:42] sister Brmila. They are very good host.
[50:46] So we are really uh feel at home and and
[50:51] uh enjoying our time.
[50:54] Amen.
[50:55] So I came in the message from
[50:57] Pentecostal
[50:59] born in a Christian family.
[51:01] The message came to me in 1989.
[51:05] I found some tracks from the trash can
[51:09] from the church's book. I was just a
[51:12] 17th year old that time. But the Lord
[51:15] opened my eyes to understand uh the
[51:19] truth and I got baptized in the same
[51:22] year.
[51:23] There was not Christianity at all in my
[51:26] area. So Lord put burden on my heart to
[51:30] share this gospel
[51:32] uh among my people
[51:35] uh in the area I was and uh Lord blessed
[51:40] our efforts
[51:42] and now we have our own church building.
[51:46] It started with the humble beginning of
[51:48] some five 10 people only two with the
[51:51] two people then five people and now we
[51:54] have some 200 people in the church and
[51:57] Lord has blessed us with the nice church
[52:00] building
[52:03] and uh
[52:05] all the people in our church are
[52:08] converted from sik and Hindus. I am the
[52:12] only one uh from the Christian family
[52:15] there. So the work is going on and the
[52:19] gospel is going forth reaching to the
[52:23] unreached people. many places uh in
[52:27] India we are going doing lot of mission
[52:29] work printing the books into Punjabi and
[52:33] Hindi languages two languages because
[52:36] people are more on the books there
[52:40] even uh they have mobiles but they they
[52:44] love to read uh the books some places
[52:48] remote areas
[52:49] uh they they don't have even don't know
[52:54] how to use mobile.
[52:56] So please keep them in your prayers.
[53:00] Even when we are here, some of our
[53:03] brothers are going to
[53:08] preach this uh message uh in a state
[53:12] where the anti-conversion law is
[53:14] implemented which means you cannot
[53:17] preach you cannot convert anyone. If you
[53:20] you you born Muslim, you have to remain
[53:23] Muslim or Hindu, you have to remain
[53:25] Hindus. But the Lord gave us success or
[53:30] we established some almost 10 churches
[53:33] there. So now brothers are have gone
[53:37] there to uh meet some other pastors.
[53:40] Some 35 pastors are gathered there and
[53:45] they want to know more of the message
[53:48] and we are expecting a good harvest
[53:51] there.
[53:52] So please keep all these uh uh things in
[53:56] your special prayers.
[53:59] Amen.
[54:01] So today
[54:03] the Lord put burden on my heart to speak
[54:07] on the continuation.
[54:11] So my subject is we are the
[54:14] continuation.
[54:16] Amen.
[54:17] Amen.
[54:18] Amen.
[54:21] Because the Bible says that the works I
[54:26] do you shall do also. Amen.
[54:30] Even the greater works.
[54:32] Amen.
[54:33] Amen.
[54:34] So here we see Abraham
[54:39] who is a type of the father God. He
[54:43] wanted to marry his son Isaac
[54:47] and he's looking for a character.
[54:53] do not want to marry anywhere but he

[54:59] people. Amen.
[55:01] Amen.
[55:02] In his own race
[55:04] from the same blood.
[55:07] So he sent Eleazar
[55:10] and when Eleazar goes he is not
[55:14] depending on his own ability.
[55:16] That's right. He prayed and asked the
[55:19] Lord and Lord uh directed him, guided
[55:24] him to the right place.
[55:26] Amen.
[55:27] And uh he met Rebecca. Amen.
[55:32] And now he is the one who choosing a
[55:36] bride for Isaac. Amen.
[55:40] And why Abraham wanted to marry Isaac?
[55:46] Why

[55:52] Because Branam said marriage is for
[55:55] multiplication.
[55:57] Amen.
[55:58] Amen.
[56:00] The marriage is to bring children.
[56:04] And Rebecca came to Isaac. Isaac was uh
[56:09] 40 years old. And 10 years passed.
[56:14] There are no children.
[56:17] So now Isaac is praying for the
[56:20] children.
[56:23] Doing his priesthood ministry,
[56:25] mediatorial work. Praying, praying,
[56:29] praying, praying. Amen.
[56:32] Why is he praying for his barren wife?
[56:36] Because he wants her to become fruitful.
[56:40] Amen.
[56:41] He wants Why? He wants her to be
[56:44] fruitful because Isaac wants to
[56:49] reproduce himself.

[56:53] Our children are the extension of same
[56:57] life.

[57:07] extension of the same life. the life rep
[57:12] the same life reproduced in another

[57:17] Amen. So before I go further please
[57:20] excuse me. So I I just want to make an
[57:24] excuse.
[57:25] So when I came in the message I I I
[57:28] learned my English from the message
[57:32] reading the message and uh that's the
[57:35] how. So if I say something wrong,
[57:37] pronounce wrong wrong, please bear with
[57:40] me and we know that everything is under
[57:43] control.
[57:44] Amen. The Holy Ghost, Amen, is the one
[57:47] who gives the utterance.
[57:49] Hallelujah.
[57:51] So Isaac wanted to reproduce himself.
[57:57] Because the children are the same life
[58:02] but in another body.
[58:04] Yes. So Isaac is praying, praying,
[58:09] praying. Amen.
[58:11] Amen.
[58:12] So is our bridegroom because natural is
[58:15] always a type of spiritual bra.
[58:20] So is our bridegroom. Amen.
[58:23] We are introduced to our bridegroom
[58:28] with a ministry of Eleazar
[58:31] in this day. And our bridegroom, Amen.
[58:36] wanted us to bring fruit for him.
[58:41] He's not happy with the barren wife. He

[59:13] His very own life.
[59:17] Amen. He is desiring us to bring more
[59:20] fruit.

[59:25] father glorified that ye bear much
[59:29] fruit."
[59:30] Amen. Amen.
[59:32] Amen.

[1:03:39] continuation.
[1:03:42] There had to be
[1:03:44] son come out of the womb
[1:03:48] for the continuation.
[1:03:51] Amen.
[1:03:52] He because if there is no son,
[1:03:57] if there are no children
[1:03:59] after Isaac, Amen.
[1:04:02] there is no continuation.
[1:04:05] That's right. for the continuation
[1:04:08] Isaac must have children.
[1:04:12] Hallelujah.
[1:04:14] So he the God he is God of Abraham.
[1:04:19] He was God of Isaac.
[1:04:23] And if Isaac have no children,
[1:04:27] God would also stopped there.
[1:04:29] Yes.
[1:04:31] To move
[1:04:33] further.
[1:04:35] God need children.
[1:04:37] Amen.
[1:04:38] God need believers.
[1:04:41] Amen.
[1:04:42] Amen.
[1:04:43] If Isaac died and he had no children, he
[1:04:48] would have stopped there.
[1:04:52] He would have God of Abraham and Isaac.
[1:04:56] Yeah,
[1:04:57] God cannot move further.
[1:05:02] Because Abraham said believers of the
[1:05:05] day makes him seem today.
[1:05:09] Amen.
[1:05:09] Amen. I'm quoting from the message. If
[1:05:13] it is us, the church that shines forth
[1:05:17] his presence to makes him visible to all
[1:05:21] when he shines through the lives of his
[1:05:24] elected believers. Amen. So if there are
[1:05:29] no children
[1:05:31] because God's plan is Amen for a man and
[1:05:37] with the man. God works with man.
[1:05:41] From the beginning when God created the
[1:05:44] his creation, man and God are working
[1:05:48] together.
[1:05:50] We have a history of this. Amen. from
[1:05:53] 6,000 years God is working with man. If
[1:05:57] there are no man no believer that God
[1:06:01] would be amen there he cannot move
[1:06:04] further.
[1:06:05] That's right.
[1:06:07] So he need children.
[1:06:10] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:06:11] So Isaac,
[1:06:14] God's son, because that was not God's
[1:06:17] plan that he would not have children
[1:06:20] because God's plan cannot be defeated.
[1:06:25] Amen.
[1:06:26] God's purpose cannot be defeated.
[1:06:30] Amen. because his plan his promise for
[1:06:35] uh this days and little while and the
[1:06:38] world would not see me no more. Yeah,
[1:06:41] you will see me for I will be with you
[1:06:45] even in you to the end of the world.
[1:06:49] So prophet said the believer would see
[1:06:52] him in every age. Amen.
[1:06:56] The believer would see him in every age
[1:06:59] that makes him the same yesterday, today
[1:07:03] and forever.
[1:07:05] Amen.
[1:07:06] So God need
[1:07:09] children.
[1:07:12] God need believers.
[1:07:16] Amen.
[1:07:17] And brother said the believers
[1:07:21] make him the same. Yesterday
[1:07:26] the believer amen had been in the past.
[1:07:31] Amen. They made him same that day. But
[1:07:36] now this is our time.
[1:07:38] Amen. We are here to shine his life
[1:07:42] to reflect Jesus Christ.
[1:07:45] We must be the living manifestation of
[1:07:48] the living word.
[1:07:49] Amen.
[1:07:50] We must produce his life. Amen.
[1:07:53] Amen.
[1:07:55] So in this the God Amen. we have his
[1:08:01] gene.
[1:08:02] That's why we call him Aba father.
[1:08:05] Because we were in his loins. We were in
[1:08:08] his thoughts. We were in the back part
[1:08:10] of his mind. He was Amen.
[1:08:14] And he put his word in us.
[1:08:18] Amen.
[1:08:19] That's right. Andam said the word is
[1:08:24] laying there like a seed
[1:08:26] maybe hundreds of year hundreds of year.
[1:08:30] Amen. And let me read quote.
[1:08:35] If I taught you a Methodist message, it
[1:08:38] would take no effect on you.
[1:08:41] This is bride time.
[1:08:43] If Moses taught the message of Noah, it
[1:08:46] would take no effect. If Jesus taught
[1:08:50] Moses message, it would take no effect
[1:08:53] because the predestinated seed are
[1:08:56] laying there that will only be watered
[1:08:59] by that type of water.
[1:09:02] That's give for that seed.
[1:09:04] It would not grow any other condition.
[1:09:08] It must be the condition that grows it.
[1:09:12] Amen.
[1:09:13] Amen.
[1:09:14] So this is the bright time. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:18] And the water is the word of God. Amen.
[1:09:22] And the bride need. Amen. The word for
[1:09:27] this day.
[1:09:28] Amen.
[1:09:30] He said this is bright time.
[1:09:33] And the seeds of God that are
[1:09:36] predestinated, Amen. before the
[1:09:39] foundation of the world, Amen.
[1:09:42] predestinated on the earth are waiting
[1:09:46] there for the right kind of water.
[1:09:49] Amen.
[1:09:50] That's why you are not in the Methodist
[1:09:52] Baptist or some any other church.
[1:09:55] Because you are different seed.
[1:09:58] Amen.
[1:10:00] That is given for that seed to quicken
[1:10:02] the water message of the hour. Amen.
[1:10:07] So when that spirit Amen.
[1:10:12] comes,
[1:10:14] he quickens the seed in us
[1:10:18] and there is a life in that seed
[1:10:21] and every seed
[1:10:24] brings its own kind.
[1:10:26] Amen.
[1:10:27] Amen.
[1:10:28] So the Holy Spirit is here.
[1:10:32] Amen.
[1:10:33] And God put seed in us in our body.
[1:10:37] Amen. And holy ghost knows exactly which
[1:10:42] flesh his attributes are expressed in.
[1:10:47] Amen.
[1:10:48] Those seeds were laying in the mind of
[1:10:51] God.
[1:10:53] Before the foundation of the word.
[1:10:56] Amen.
[1:10:57] It was laying there. Brother Branam said
[1:11:00] we were jeans in the mind of God.
[1:11:04] Amen.
[1:11:05] We are his seed.
[1:11:07] Amen. We are his thoughts. His thoughts
[1:11:10] are seed
[1:11:12] genes. Amen. Word is a seed. So we were
[1:11:16] waiting there before the foundation of
[1:11:20] the word
[1:11:21] for our turn.
[1:11:23] Because every seed grows in its in in
[1:11:27] his own season.
[1:11:30] If we uh plant the seed out of the
[1:11:32] season, it will not bring forth fruit.
[1:11:35] Amen.
[1:11:36] Amen.
[1:11:37] So why we are here
[1:11:40] in this age?
[1:11:42] Because we are the seed of this age.
[1:11:46] But we were in the mind of God.
[1:11:49] Waiting there before the foundation of
[1:11:52] the world. God ordained for us to be
[1:11:56] born in this age.
[1:11:58] Amen. And when this age came, you born
[1:12:02] of your mother and father. Yes.
[1:12:05] But God has a gene.
[1:12:08] Amen. We we we receive this body from
[1:12:12] our mother and father and God spoke that
[1:12:16] thought,
[1:12:18] that gene.
[1:12:20] Amen. That seed. Amen.
[1:12:23] It went into that body.
[1:12:26] So this body, Amen. we received from our
[1:12:30] mother and father.
[1:12:33] But the seed
[1:12:36] in this body
[1:12:37] is an eternal seed.
[1:12:41] Came from the thoughts of God
[1:12:44] that eternal eternal thought have never
[1:12:48] ending and never beginning.
[1:12:52] Amen. Because that is God's thoughts.
[1:12:55] Eternal thoughts of God. We came from
[1:12:59] the eternal thoughts of God.
[1:13:02] Amen.
[1:13:03] And that thought is God's gene seed in
[1:13:07] this body.
[1:13:09] So now we have seed of God, life of God
[1:13:14] in this body.
[1:13:16] Hallelujah.
[1:13:17] Hallelujah.
[1:13:18] And when the Holy Ghost comes and
[1:13:21] quicken that seed in this body,
[1:13:25] we
[1:13:27] Amen.
[1:13:28] Amen.
[1:13:29] unlock the mystery of that seed.
[1:13:34] Because that seed is a mystery.
[1:13:38] Amen.
[1:13:38] Amen.
[1:13:39] And when we receive the Holy Ghost,
[1:13:44] that seed is quickened, that seed bring
[1:13:47] forth its own kind.
[1:13:50] Hallelujah.
[1:13:52] Amen.
[1:13:53] Amen. So the seed in us
[1:13:58] is the
[1:14:00] life of God.
[1:14:02] Amen.
[1:14:02] Amen.
[1:14:03] And the Bible, the word is a written
[1:14:08] record of our life.
[1:14:11] Amen.
[1:14:12] Because we we are part of God's word and
[1:14:16] God whatever he thought he expressed.
[1:14:20] Amen. revealed to the prophets and those
[1:14:23] prophets seers or they wrote the Bible.
[1:14:26] Amen. And whatever is written, Amen.
[1:14:30] is the written record of our seed,
[1:14:35] the life,
[1:14:37] that came from God.
[1:14:40] Amen.
[1:14:42] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:14:45] The attribute of God displayed in your
[1:14:49] phys physical body.
[1:14:51] Amen.
[1:14:52] Amen.
[1:14:53] And that seed is the word predestinated.
[1:14:58] Amen.
[1:14:59] To the word written for the hour.
[1:15:01] Amen.
[1:15:02] That's why when we have the Holy Ghost,
[1:15:06] we cannot deny the word.
[1:15:09] Amen. Amen.
[1:15:10] We cannot contradict the word of God.
[1:15:14] Hallelujah.
[1:15:16] Because we are born of the word.
[1:15:19] Amen. Not not corruptible. The Bible
[1:15:22] says, Amen.
[1:15:24] Amen.
[1:15:25] Seed. Amen.
[1:15:28] So then that word in you is b watered by
[1:15:34] the Holy Spirit
[1:15:36] and as it grows and matures it reveals
[1:15:40] the mystery of the word
[1:15:44] because word is seed. The seed is in us.
[1:15:49] When the Holy Ghost comes, Amen. and
[1:15:53] that seed is quickened.
[1:15:56] Amen. Then we reveal the mystery of the
[1:15:59] word
[1:16:01] because that seed is a word of God.
[1:16:04] Amen.
[1:16:06] So when that word mature in us, Amen.
[1:16:10] And we start to reveal the mystery which
[1:16:12] is locked in the sea seed. Amen. So we
[1:16:18] are living
[1:16:21] the life or the mystery of the seed.
[1:16:25] Amen.
[1:16:26] That seed came from God.
[1:16:28] Amen. That gene came from God
[1:16:32] in this body. Amen.
[1:16:35] And when the appointed time come, the
[1:16:38] Holy Spirit knowing that Amen. thought
[1:16:42] was expressed in that flesh. That's why
[1:16:46] Banam said uh this message has come to
[1:16:48] gather the bride to hunt the bride. Son
[1:16:52] of man, Amen. has come to seek the lost
[1:16:57] predestinated people. Amen.
[1:17:00] So the Holy Ghost or the message or God
[1:17:05] knows.
[1:17:07] Amen. They had to come to you to quicken
[1:17:11] you to recognize.
[1:17:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:17:15] To recognize who you are,
[1:17:18] what part of the scripture you were for
[1:17:21] the is that you were living in.
[1:17:24] So that is the different Pentecostal or
[1:17:27] denominational people. They believe the
[1:17:30] Bible.
[1:17:31] That's right.
[1:17:32] Amen.
[1:17:33] They all believe the Bible. They all
[1:17:35] preach the Bible, but they do not know
[1:17:38] which part of the word they are living.
[1:17:40] Amen.
[1:17:42] But because of the message, we know that
[1:17:45] which part of the word has been
[1:17:47] fulfilled, which part of the word God is
[1:17:50] fulfilling now and which part of the
[1:17:53] word is going to be fulfilled.
[1:17:56] Because of the message, we know who
[1:17:59] where we are.
[1:18:00] Amen. And what part of the word God is
[1:18:03] fulfilling. Amen. So a prophet said you
[1:18:07] you did not come here by chance.
[1:18:12] You did not stumble in here.
[1:18:15] Your birth is predestinated.
[1:18:19] Amen. Even we are predestinated
[1:18:22] where we will born the places
[1:18:25] the countries. Amen.
[1:18:28] It looks like we are stumbling here but
[1:18:32] we are predestinated.
[1:18:35] by the Holy Ghost. Amen. That's why
[1:18:38] Jesus said, "No man uh could come except
[1:18:42] the father draws him first."
[1:18:45] Amen. And Jesus said, "And all that the
[1:18:47] father hath given me will come to me."
[1:18:51] Amen. Like any parent, all their
[1:18:55] children were in them at the same time.
[1:18:59] Amen.
[1:18:59] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:03] Like I have three son but they were in
[1:19:06] me at the same time.
[1:19:08] Amen. You were in the loins of God which
[1:19:12] is in God's mind. When Noah was in God's
[1:19:17] loins, Abraham was there at the same
[1:19:20] time.
[1:19:21] Amen. When Moses was in there, you were
[1:19:26] there at the same time. Amen.
[1:19:28] But you were are a different Amen. Uh
[1:19:33] you are different season for the
[1:19:35] different agemen
[1:19:37] for the different season. Amen.
[1:19:40] You came in different seasons according
[1:19:44] to God's own eternal purpose.
[1:19:47] Amen.
[1:19:48] Nothing is by chance. Amen. So now we
[1:19:53] come in the flesh. Amen. So there is
[1:19:57] something strange in us inside of us in
[1:20:01] our hearts crying out for something
[1:20:04] eternal.
[1:20:06] Babham uh told us a story of an eagle.
[1:20:11] Amen.
[1:20:12] How that eagle was born in chickens.
[1:20:15] Amen. So God has awakened the bride to
[1:20:19] that consciousness that she is his
[1:20:21] attributes
[1:20:23] expressed. Amen. God does not change and
[1:20:27] his plans his purpose never change
[1:20:31] and his plans and purpose could not be
[1:20:34] defeated. Amen. So wedding is for
[1:20:37] multiplication.
[1:20:38] Amen.
[1:20:39] To bring the children for the
[1:20:41] continuation.
[1:20:43] Amen. As a little child is born. Amen.
[1:20:47] As I am saying he get his body from the
[1:20:50] parent. Amen. But in that body
[1:20:55] you have a soul in that body.
[1:20:58] Amen.
[1:20:59] Soul is a part of the eternal word.
[1:21:02] Amen.
[1:21:03] Amen.
[1:21:06] Please listen closely.
[1:21:09] Because I have not enough words to
[1:21:12] express.
[1:21:14] So the life, the seed, the soul
[1:21:20] came in this body
[1:21:23] but that soul is eternal.
[1:21:25] That's right.
[1:21:26] That soul is an eternal part of God
[1:21:29] the word. Amen.
[1:21:31] So it is a life to come in
[1:21:36] and have continued existence of the same
[1:21:40] life.
[1:21:40] Amen.
[1:21:41] Amen. So that's why we are bra said we
[1:21:45] are believer
[1:21:47] is a eternal creatures.
[1:21:51] Amen. So we have received this body from
[1:21:54] our mother and father but the soul
[1:21:59] the life came from another world.
[1:22:02] Amen.
[1:22:03] And that life is eternal.
[1:22:07] Amen.
[1:22:08] Amen. And when this body amen passed on
[1:22:12] we die. So the same life will be going
[1:22:16] in heaven.
[1:22:18] So in heaven we will be a there will be
[1:22:22] a continuation of the same life which
[1:22:26] was in God.
[1:22:27] Now it does proving that we are the sons
[1:22:31] of God.
[1:22:32] We are the daughter of God.
[1:22:34] God living his life in us.
[1:22:39] We become his hand, his mouth, his eyes,
[1:22:43] his feet.
[1:22:44] Amen.
[1:22:45] Amen.
[1:22:47] Not we are doing the work but he
[1:22:49] himself.
[1:22:51] Not as Paul said, not I but Christ lives
[1:22:55] in me.
[1:22:56] Amen.
[1:22:56] Amen. So the life which came from heaven
[1:23:03] now expressing through us
[1:23:06] and we will be the continuation of the
[1:23:10] same life in heaven
[1:23:13] in another world.
[1:23:16] You cannot go back to heaven. The Bible
[1:23:19] says if you have not come from heaven
[1:23:23] we can't go back the heaven. When we say
[1:23:25] heaven is our home, it means we have
[1:23:28] come from that home
[1:23:30] and we are going back to
[1:23:33] our home.
[1:23:34] Amen.
[1:23:35] Amen. If that life is not in us,
[1:23:39] Amen.
[1:23:40] But Branam said if you do everything,
[1:23:44] you pay tithes, you come to church, you
[1:23:47] you contribute and you sing song or you
[1:23:50] preach whatever. He said if you you do
[1:23:54] everything
[1:23:57] and you missed that life
[1:23:59] you missed everything.
[1:24:01] Amen.
[1:24:03] Because we cannot get back to heaven we
[1:24:07] if we have not come from heaven.
[1:24:09] Amen.
[1:24:10] Amen.
[1:24:11] So so there is a continuation.
[1:24:16] In other words, what I wanted to say is
[1:24:20] we are the continuation
[1:24:24] of the same life Jesus lived.
[1:24:28] [Music]
[1:24:30] Amen.
[1:24:31] Now that's why preach images
[1:24:36] of Christ.
[1:24:38] Amen.
[1:24:39] Identified Christ in all ages.
[1:24:42] Amen.
[1:24:43] Amen.
[1:24:44] Amen. So we are if we are connected with
[1:24:47] our bridegroom. Amen. And we are married
[1:24:51] to Jesus Christ our Lord. So we have to
[1:24:55] be pregnanted with his word.
[1:24:58] We have to be pregnanted with his
[1:25:00] thoughts in his seed. Amen. Bringing
[1:25:04] forth children in the image and likeness
[1:25:07] of the father.
[1:25:09] Amen.
[1:25:10] Hallelujah.
[1:25:11] Hallelujah. out of the church womb have
[1:25:15] to come both sons and daughters after
[1:25:17] his own kind
[1:25:19] because church is the extens extension
[1:25:23] of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:25] Amen.
[1:25:26] You remember when John the Baptist was
[1:25:28] preaching. Amen. He said I must decrease
[1:25:33] and he must increase.
[1:25:35] Amen.
[1:25:36] What is increase? Then he said I am just
[1:25:40] a friend of the bridegroom but
[1:25:43] bridegroom amen
[1:25:46] has the bride and then he said he must
[1:25:49] increase how we increase how our family
[1:25:54] increase with the wife.
[1:25:57] Amen.
[1:25:58] So John is saying that he must increase
[1:26:01] because he has the bride. We are the
[1:26:05] extension.
[1:26:07] We are the increase of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:10] Amen. Because family is an extension of
[1:26:14] the same life.
[1:26:15] There must be a people whose lives are
[1:26:20] matching these
[1:26:22] things.
[1:26:24] Amen.
[1:26:25] Their life is matching with the
[1:26:28] scripture.

[1:26:32] That is the little life. That is Christ
[1:26:35] in you in bride form.

[1:26:40] Christ in us in the bride form
[1:26:44] when God created Adam.
[1:26:46] Amen.
[1:26:48] The Bible says
[1:26:51] Adam was a son of God.
[1:26:54] When we read the genealogy in chap Luke.
[1:26:58] Amen. Maybe chapter one I think or two.
[1:27:02] Amen. Amen.
[1:27:04] So, Adam
[1:27:06] came out of God.
[1:27:09] Adam was a continuation
[1:27:13] of the life of God.
[1:27:16] Adam was an extension of God's life.
[1:27:21] And the Bible says God created Adam in
[1:27:24] his own image,
[1:27:26] in his own likeness, after his likeness.
[1:27:29] Amen. So, Adam came out of God.
[1:27:35] Amen.
[1:27:37] In his image and in his likeness.
[1:27:41] Amen.
[1:27:42] Amen.

[1:27:43] So, Adam was a continuation
[1:27:47] of the life of God.

[1:27:53] Now
[1:27:56] the Bible says but Branam preached a
[1:27:58] message Christ is the mystery of God
[1:28:00] revealed. But Branam said Adam
[1:28:05] Amen.

[1:28:12] Amen.
[1:28:12] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:14] God foreshadowed
[1:28:18] Christ and his bride in Adam and Eve.
[1:28:22] And we know that Christ is second Adam.
[1:28:25] Amen. So God is all alone. He created
[1:28:30] universe everything. Now he wanted to
[1:28:33] amen express himself. Amen. Because God
[1:28:37] is a man. Amen.
[1:28:39] So because man came on the earth later
[1:28:43] man was already in heaven.
[1:28:47] First creature is like a loin. The
[1:28:51] second is like an ox. The third is like
[1:28:54] a
[1:28:55] man.
[1:28:57] So man was already there.
[1:28:59] That is our God's attribute his
[1:29:03] expression. Amen. So he Amen.
[1:29:08] brought Adam.
[1:29:10] Out of God came Adam. Adam was a
[1:29:14] continuation of God's life. And out of
[1:29:18] Adam, Eve came out of Adam.
[1:29:22] Amen.
[1:29:23] Amen. So, Eve was a continuation of the
[1:29:27] life of Adam.
[1:29:29] Amen.
[1:29:31] That's why you remember Adam said now
[1:29:35] she is born of my bones
[1:29:39] and flesh of my flesh.
[1:29:41] Amen.
[1:29:42] She shall be called Isa because she is

[1:29:51] You can read the footnote. Amen. So she
[1:29:54] is taken out of is she shall be called

[1:30:40] And now the same spirit all the life is
[1:30:44] in Eve. Amen.

[1:30:49] part of Adam now being revealed in
[1:30:52] another body.
[1:30:54] Amen.
[1:30:56] Amen. And God brought Eve to Adam. Then
[1:31:01] Adam said, "She is born of my bone,
[1:31:03] flesh of my flesh." So Eve cannot be
[1:31:06] brought back to Adam if she is not taken
[1:31:09] out of Adam.
[1:31:12] She Amen. If we know that there is no
[1:31:16] not any Amen.

[1:31:34] could not find any mate

[1:31:43] so same life is moving further
[1:31:48] God, Adam. Now from Adam to Eve
[1:31:53] and the Eve was a carbon copy of Adam.
[1:31:58] Correct?
[1:31:59] So the Bible says there were two Adams.
[1:32:04] Two Adams. What is male? One is male and
[1:32:07] one is female. Genesis 5:2. And called
[1:32:11] their name Adam in the day when they
[1:32:14] were created.

[1:32:18] Amen.
[1:32:19] Female and male to Adam.

[1:45:47] restoring Israel back to the Moses
[1:45:50] message.
[1:45:51] Amen.

[1:46:02] Even when Jesus came, he said, "I
[1:46:07] come to fulfill the scripture."
[1:46:11] Amen. He said, "Scriptures cannot be
[1:46:14] broken."
[1:46:16] Amen. So Jesus in the beginning of his
[1:46:20] ministry in the first pole he preached
[1:46:24] Moses.
[1:46:26] Matthew 8:4 Jesus preached
[1:46:30] uh Matthew 8:4
[1:46:33] and Jesus saith unto him, "See thou tell
[1:46:36] no man, but go thy way, show thyself to
[1:46:40] the priest, and offer the gift that
[1:46:44] Moses commanded for a testimony unto
[1:46:47] them." Amen.
[1:46:49] Mark 1:44. and saith unto him, See thou

[1:46:58] for thy cleansing those thing which
[1:47:01] Moses commanded for a testimony unto
[1:47:05] them. Amen.
[1:47:09] Continuity cannot be broken. That's why
[1:47:13] Branam said if any revelation comes,
[1:47:17] Amen. And that revelation is not amenail
[1:47:23] from Genesis to Revelation
[1:47:26] is not in chain.
[1:47:29] Amen.
[1:47:30] Amen.
[1:47:31] If it is not in continuity, that's not
[1:47:33] of God.
[1:47:36] That is your own thinking. Amen. So at
[1:47:40] the end of his ministry,
[1:47:44] after his resurrection,
[1:47:47] Amen. Third pull, he's revealing the
[1:47:51] word to his disciple
[1:47:54] when they're going to emos. Luke 24:27
[1:47:58] says, "And Jesus, and beginning at Moses
[1:48:02] and all the prophets, he expounded unto
[1:48:06] them in all the scriptures the things
[1:48:10] concerning himself."
[1:48:13] Amen.
[1:48:14] So Jesus never spoke anything against
[1:48:18] Moses.
[1:48:19] [Music]
[1:48:22] Word cannot be broken.
[1:48:25] Continuity cannot be broken.
[1:48:29] That's why when Brahana preach
[1:48:31] everything goes back to revelation.
[1:48:35] And everything is in continuation.
[1:48:39] Amen.
[1:48:39] Amen.
[1:48:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:48:44] So when John the Baptist came, Amen.
[1:48:49] He was a continuation of the book of
[1:48:52] Malachi
[1:48:55] because Malachi said the he's going to
[1:48:58] send his messenger.
[1:49:01] Amen.
[1:49:02] So the Bible from Genesis to Revelation
[1:49:05] is in continuity.
[1:49:08] Amen.
[1:49:09] Amen. Amen.
[1:49:11] You can start from anywhere. Bible

[1:49:21] G.
[1:49:22] The Bible starts with eating, wrong kind
[1:49:25] of eating and ends with eating.
[1:49:30] Amen.
[1:49:32] So sin came by eating.
[1:49:35] Amen. Restoration came by eating because
[1:49:39] when our inheritance the book that
[1:49:41] titled it came
[1:49:43] the angel said go and eat the book
[1:49:46] because what we eat we become what we
[1:49:50] eat
[1:49:51] eat the book. Amen. So John was the
[1:49:55] continuation of Malachiah.
[1:49:59] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:01] So when God started with Adam,
[1:50:05] same life moving further.
[1:50:07] Amen.
[1:50:08] Amen.
[1:50:08] Because Jesus Christ was
[1:50:13] identifying himself,
[1:50:15] foreshadowing himself through all the
[1:50:18] prophets.
[1:50:21] That's why
[1:50:23] first I think Peter says Christ spirit
[1:50:27] was in them
[1:50:28] in all the prophets.
[1:50:29] That's right.
[1:50:30] David was behaving like Christ.
[1:50:32] That's right.
[1:50:33] Amen.
[1:50:33] Amen.
[1:50:34] And uh Moses he stood in the gap. Amen.
[1:50:38] All the prophets we can talk about
[1:50:40] anyone all were expressing showing
[1:50:44] living the life of Jesus Christ
[1:50:46] because that life was continuing. Now
[1:50:49] John the Baptist. Amen. After Jesus
[1:50:53] came, everything is in continuation.
[1:50:58] Prophet said overlapping. Jesus,
[1:51:03] preached Moses. That was the beginning.
[1:51:06] Amen. And after Jesus apostles came,
[1:51:10] they preached the same message. They
[1:51:12] were the continuation of the same
[1:51:14] message. Amen. Then seven churches
[1:51:19] Amen.
[1:51:20] Amen.
[1:51:21] Same life, same message
[1:51:24] was in overlapping pattern.
[1:51:27] That's right.
[1:51:28] Amen.
[1:51:29] Amen.
[1:51:30] Hallelujah.
[1:51:31] And BRAM said, let me read the
[1:51:35] Philadelphia churches. And no man can
[1:51:37] shut it. We must now recall what has
[1:51:40] been said about each running over into
[1:51:44] another. There is n there is an
[1:51:48] overlapping a melting or fading into
[1:51:52] rather than an abrupt end and a clearcut
[1:51:56] start. This age particularly flows into
[1:52:01] the next age that is a continuation.
[1:52:05] Amen. And not only does this age
[1:52:08] overflow into last age, but the last age
[1:52:13] is in many respects simply occurring on
[1:52:17] of the sixth age.
[1:52:19] Amen.
[1:52:20] Amen.
[1:52:23] Everything is in continuity because out
[1:52:26] of the churches comes seals.
[1:52:29] Out of the seals comes trumpets. Out of
[1:52:33] the tempers comes out viles. Out of the
[1:52:36] viles comes out plagues. Everything is
[1:52:40] in continuity.
[1:52:42] That's why Branam said the seventh seal
[1:52:46] is like a rocket.
[1:52:50] Amen.
[1:52:51] Amen.
[1:52:51] It is just like firing a rocket into the
[1:52:54] air and that rocket explodes here and it
[1:52:58] goes up and then explodes again. It puts
[1:53:02] out five stars. One of those stars
[1:53:05] explode and blows out five stars from
[1:53:09] it. And then one of them stars explodes
[1:53:12] and blows odd five stars from it. See it
[1:53:16] fades on odd and then one of them stars
[1:53:20] explodes and blows odd five stars from
[1:53:24] it. See it fades on odd. That is what
[1:53:29] the seventh seal it it just ends the
[1:53:33] time for the world. It ends a time for
[1:53:36] this. It ends the time for that. It ends
[1:53:39] the time for this. It ends a time.
[1:53:42] Everything just ended up in that seventh
[1:53:45] seal.
[1:53:46] Amen. So Bananaam is saying that even
[1:53:48] seven seal is from Genesis to
[1:53:51] revelation.
[1:53:53] Amen. Seventh seal is goes in eternity.
[1:53:57] Seven seal is the end of time
[1:54:00] but everything is in continuity. He said
[1:54:04] it's like firing a rocket and when that
[1:54:07] rocket amen fires and blows it brings
[1:54:11] five stars.
[1:54:13] Blows five time
[1:54:16] 1 2 3 4 Amen. It blows and fade out.
[1:54:21] Then the fifth Amen
[1:54:24] blows and brings another five.
[1:54:27] Amen. Tata finish and next five star
[1:54:33] again. Amen. So it's moving.
[1:54:37] It's in continuity.
[1:54:39] Amen.
[1:54:41] We bride will speak what already been
[1:54:44] spoken.
[1:54:45] Amen.
[1:54:46] Amen. Because we are the continuation of
[1:54:50] the same message,
[1:54:51] same life. Amen. What? Amen. Amen.
[1:54:56] What we have received in these days
[1:55:01] after revelation 10:7
[1:55:04] opening of the book revelation of the
[1:55:07] word when it is given after that
[1:55:10] revelation 108 to 111
[1:55:14] is the continuation.
[1:55:16] Amen.
[1:55:18] What you think we are talking here?
[1:55:20] Revelation 10. Amen. 8 to 11 eat the
[1:55:26] book.
[1:55:27] Amen.
[1:55:27] Become the part of the word. Amen.
[1:55:31] God don't want anybody to work for him.
[1:55:35] He wants to work in you.
[1:55:38] Christ walking in your feet, speaking
[1:55:41] through your lips,
[1:55:43] think with your mind, working with your
[1:55:46] hands.
[1:55:47] The continuation of the same revelation
[1:55:50] is being expressed through you. Amen.
[1:55:54] Amen.
[1:55:55] Thank you.
[1:55:56] Says you becomes the will that wills
[1:55:59] him.
[1:56:00] Amen. Same God in us. Now the God who is
[1:56:05] above us and with us becomes in us. You
[1:56:10] are his hands. You are his feet. He is
[1:56:13] the head over the body. Amen. It shows
[1:56:17] the head and body is united. That is the
[1:56:22] continuation. That's why he appeared.
[1:56:24] Amen.
[1:56:25] And when he appeared to Paul, he said,
[1:56:27] "Paul, Paul, why thou persecute me?"
[1:56:31] The first vision, the first time God
[1:56:35] started to tell deal with Paul, he told
[1:56:39] them, I and my people
[1:56:41] are one.
[1:56:43] Amen.
[1:56:43] I'm one with the body.
[1:56:45] Amen.
[1:56:46] Hallelujah. So, we are the continuation.
[1:56:50] knowledge has increased. People know
[1:56:54] everything about the message. They can
[1:56:57] reason, they can debate, they can argue,
[1:57:01] they they can prove their doctrines
[1:57:04] whatever they believe. But this is
[1:57:07] that's we cannot prove that we are
[1:57:10] believer by the things.
[1:57:13] Yes sir.
[1:57:16] This is the time to live a life. Amen.
[1:57:20] Amen.
[1:57:20] This is the time to show that that life
[1:57:23] in us. Amen.
[1:57:25] Amen.
[1:57:26] And God is living that life. Amen.
[1:57:30] I want to read a quote. The world is
[1:57:32] again falling apart. I don't know how
[1:57:34] that car runs out there. It has got
[1:57:37] pistons and cylinders. And I don't know
[1:57:40] how much pressure it used. The only
[1:57:43] thing I know is the dynamics. put her
[1:57:46] out there and drive it until that church
[1:57:50] becomes with dynamics and mechanics and
[1:57:53] the spirit of God that moved him to do
[1:57:56] the things that he did. If he hit on 16
[1:58:00] cylinders, so will the bride.
[1:58:05] Amen. For he said in John 14:12, he that
[1:58:09] believeth on me, the works that I do
[1:58:12] shall he do also. I will give him a ch
[1:58:15] charge of my dynamics in his mechanics
[1:58:18] that the world will not be able to
[1:58:21] withstand it and I will raise him up
[1:58:24] again at the last day. That is the
[1:58:26] eastern message. The dynamics and the
[1:58:29] mechanics together.
[1:58:31] The mechanics without the dynamics no
[1:58:34] good.
[1:58:35] Neither is the dynamics without the
[1:58:37] mechanics.
[1:58:38] Amen.
[1:58:39] Amen.
[1:58:44] The genes of God, the life of God in us.
[1:58:50] We are God's gene.
[1:58:53] We are God's life. Zoe Zoe, eternal
[1:58:57] life. God's life. Amen.
[1:59:00] The Holy Spirit in us. What is the title
[1:59:03] deed? I am closing.
[1:59:06] What is the title deed?
[1:59:12] Many people they claim that if you know
[1:59:16] all the seals by heart
[1:59:19] you are going to get in the rapture
[1:59:23] and everybody I I I'm talking in India
[1:59:28] always talking about the seal seal seal
[1:59:33] which is good but if we are depending
[1:59:37] something like the something like that
[1:59:40] that if you will remember this or this
[1:59:42] it is going to happen. So we are in
[1:59:46] confusion. It is not like that. We are
[1:59:48] talking about the life.
[1:59:50] If that life
[1:59:52] from heaven is not in us.
[1:59:54] Amen.
[1:59:56] We cannot go there.
[1:59:58] Amen.
[1:59:59] Amen.
[2:00:00] We are living. Amen.
[2:00:04] God's life here.
[2:00:05] Amen.
[2:00:06] What is the title deed? The opening of
[2:00:10] the seal.
[2:00:13] Remember Abraham said revelation goes
[2:00:15] with your life.
[2:00:16] If your life is contrary with the
[2:00:18] revelation, Amen.
[2:00:20] Amen.
[2:00:21] Then that revelation is not correct.
[2:00:25] That's just a knowledge or information.
[2:00:27] Amen.
[2:00:28] So what is the title deed?
[2:00:31] That is the birthright. Amen.
[2:00:34] When you are born in the family,
[2:00:37] Amen.
[2:00:38] And you have the same life,
[2:00:40] you get the inheritance.
[2:00:43] Amen. Title deed is for the family
[2:00:47] members.
[2:00:50] Title deed is an inheritance.
[2:00:54] Amen.
[2:00:55] What is the abstract to the title deed?
[2:00:59] I'm quoting from the breach and the
[2:01:01] messenger. What is the abstract to the
[2:01:04] title deed? Prophets and the Holy Ghost.
[2:01:09] Amen.
[2:01:10] Search all the way back to the beginning
[2:01:14] in the thoughts of God.
[2:01:16] Amen.
[2:01:18] Amen. So titled it. Amen. We know we
[2:01:22] search if it belong to if anyone else or
[2:01:26] we search way back. Who is the owner?
[2:01:29] Amen. So prophet said
[2:01:32] search the Holy Ghost. Search all the
[2:01:36] way back
[2:01:38] in the thoughts of God. The spirit
[2:01:41] coming to the word that word in you part
[2:01:46] of that word in you. So the Holy Ghost
[2:01:49] comes search us. If we goes back
[2:01:56] see the life in us such way back in the
[2:02:00] thoughts of God.
[2:02:03] Amen.
[2:02:04] That is the title lead. If we are there
[2:02:07] if we are in the thoughts of God.
[2:02:10] Amen. Search way back in the thoughts of
[2:02:13] God means it is searched all the way
[2:02:16] back to its beginning.
[2:02:21] Amen. in the mind of God.
[2:02:24] And when we are found there, that life
[2:02:28] is in us. We are the continuation of the
[2:02:31] same life.
[2:02:33] We are the bride.
[2:02:35] Amen.
[2:02:36] Remember Eve was brought back to Adam
[2:02:40] because he was taken out of Adam.
[2:02:44] If we are taken out of God,
[2:02:47] Amen.
[2:02:47] If we have come from Christ, Amen.
[2:02:51] We can go back to him
[2:02:53] if we are not taken out of God.
[2:02:57] If we have not come from above, we
[2:03:00] cannot go back because it going to be
[2:03:04] same life.
[2:03:06] The continuation of the same life.
[2:03:08] Amen.
[2:03:09] Amen.
[2:03:11] Again one quotes and then we close.
[2:03:15] What was the Holy Ghost given for? Now
[2:03:18] the works that I do shall you do also.
[2:03:21] Not another work. But God wants to bring
[2:03:25] the Holy Ghost in you
[2:03:28] to continue the same work that he was
[2:03:31] doing in Christ.
[2:03:33] The purpose of sending the Holy Ghost
[2:03:35] was for God to continue through a bunch
[2:03:39] of people to continually manifest God to
[2:03:44] the world. That is exactly so why the
[2:03:48] Holy Ghost God's life is in us to
[2:03:51] manifest
[2:03:53] God's life.
[2:03:55] Manifest God to the world. So that's why
[2:03:59] I always say we because we have received
[2:04:03] the message we are not representing any
[2:04:06] church here.
[2:04:08] We are not representing any group. Even
[2:04:12] we are not representing any end time
[2:04:15] message. That message is Christ and
[2:04:19] Christ is revealed in his own word and
[2:04:22] we are here to represent Christ only.
[2:04:26] And if that life is in us, we will share
[2:04:29] that life to other. Amen.
[2:04:32] Amen.
[2:04:32] What is the greatest workam said that is
[2:04:37] impart eternal life.
[2:04:40] Amen.
[2:04:41] Amen. If that if that life is in me,
[2:04:46] eternal life, the Holy Ghost, the life
[2:04:49] that he lived, then I can impart that
[2:04:52] life to my brother,
[2:04:54] to my sister. If I do not have that life
[2:04:57] in me, I will give doctrines.
[2:05:01] creeds.
[2:05:03] I will try to present something. Bananam
[2:05:07] said I never try to bring anyone in my
[2:05:10] church. He said I always Amen. present
[2:05:15] Christ and always Amen. get the people
[2:05:18] to Christ.
[2:05:21] Christ is that life. Amen.
[2:05:25] While we are closing, brother and
[2:05:26] sister, what you want to be a church
[2:05:28] member
[2:05:30] comes every Sunday to church or you want
[2:05:33] to be the living manifestation
[2:05:37] of the word for this day
[2:05:39] or you want to live a life because we
[2:05:42] are ordained. Amen. For a purpose.
[2:05:47] He said the Holy Ghost is given to a
[2:05:50] bunch of people to continually manifest
[2:05:54] God to the world.
[2:05:56] How can we manifest God?
[2:05:59] Cannot do that with our human ability.
[2:06:03] That's right.
[2:06:03] Without him, we can do nothing.
[2:06:05] Amen.
[2:06:07] If we have that life, that life will
[2:06:10] automatically overflow.
[2:06:14] It will be like automatically.
[2:06:16] Amen. Automatically we will leave.
[2:06:18] Automatically we will love the people.
[2:06:20] Automatically we will have compassion
[2:06:23] for the people. Amen. Because that life
[2:06:26] is overflowing.
[2:06:29] Amen
[2:06:30] through us when that life is. So Amen.
[2:06:33] So so let's do our part.
[2:06:36] Amen.
[2:06:37] The second fold is God puts himself.
[2:06:41] Amen. Christ is God. Christ poured
[2:06:45] himself into the church.
[2:06:47] That's right.
[2:06:48] For what?
[2:06:52] To manifest the life of God. Jesus said,
[2:06:56] "I come to declare the father. I come to
[2:06:59] manifest."
[2:07:01] Amen. So that life must be manifest,
[2:07:04] magnified in us.
[2:07:07] That is the only way we can go there.
[2:07:11] Amen. It cannot be impersonated.
[2:07:16] Let's pray.
[2:07:18] Dear heavenly father,
[2:07:21] we thank you for your word.
[2:07:24] Thank you for the nice group of people,
[2:07:26] Lord.

[2:07:29] and uh we all love you and we thank you
[2:07:35] with the grateful of our hearts Lord
[2:07:38] that you have given us this message.
[2:07:42] You have given us prophet. We love him
[2:07:45] not because he brought big big things
[2:07:48] and revelation.
[2:07:50] We love him because he lived a life.
[2:07:53] He set an example when we see him
[2:07:58] the life like Jesus Christ.
[2:08:03] So if we have received that message, if
[2:08:06] we have re the revelation 10911,
[2:08:13] that word in us will manifest itself.
[2:08:18] We will be the continuation of the same
[2:08:21] life. Lord, help us. Apart from you, we
[2:08:25] can do nothing.
[2:08:29] Bless this church. Bless all of us,
[2:08:31] Lord. We do not want to miss that life
[2:08:35] because your prophet said end time
[2:08:38] message, evening message required the
[2:08:41] token.
[2:08:42] Amen.
[2:08:45] And token must be on display.
[2:08:48] That life must overflow.
[2:08:51] That life must manifest in the
[2:08:53] neighborhood, in the market, in the
[2:08:55] wedding, in the office, in the school,
[2:08:58] in the colleges, wherever we go. Amen.
[2:09:02] The people see that life and praise our
[2:09:05] God which is in heaven.
[2:09:08] Lord help us to be
[2:09:11] the
[2:09:13] manifestation
[2:09:15] written epistles read by all men because
[2:09:19] people are watching our lives.
[2:09:23] We are influencing people
[2:09:27] and Lord
[2:09:31] when we say we are influenced by the
[2:09:34] message
[2:09:36] that message came from heaven
[2:09:39] and if we are influenced
[2:09:43] by heaven
[2:09:46] and we must influence the people
[2:09:52] that's Why we are here to express those
[2:09:56] things to express that life of Jesus
[2:10:00] Christ that is the message.
[2:10:05] Thank you Lord.
[2:10:07] Thank you for giving your word.
[2:10:10] And Lord, if you are talking these
[2:10:12] things to us, giving these things to us,

[2:10:30] Christ.

[2:10:40] one thing we desired to hear from you
[2:10:44] that day. Well done, my son. Well done,
[2:10:47] my daughter. Keep us in your perfect
[2:10:50] will.

[2:13:29] God gracious tender
[2:13:34] let aside his slander
[2:13:39] stooping to h to win to save my soul.
[2:13:49] Oh, how
[2:13:51] I loving
[2:13:54] how I adore
[2:13:59] my breath, my sunshine,
[2:14:04] my holy Lord,
[2:14:09] the great creator,
[2:14:13] [Music]
[2:14:14] became my savior. Savior
[2:14:19] and all God's fullness
[2:14:22] [Music]
[2:14:23] dwell
[2:14:25] in him. Oh, I love him once again. Oh,
[2:14:29] how I love him,
[2:14:34] how I
[2:14:37] [Music]
[2:14:39] breath, my sunshine.
[2:14:42] [Music]
[2:14:43] is my holy Lord.
[2:14:48] The great creator
[2:14:54] became my savior
[2:14:58] and God's fullness
[2:15:03] dwelling
[2:15:05] in him.
[2:15:08] We appreciate the word of God this
[2:15:09] morning that came with uh power and just
[2:15:14] spoke to our heart in a precious way.
[2:15:17] Marvelous word of God to the time where
[2:15:19] we are living in just a precious
[2:15:23] it's the same life. the same life just a
[2:15:27] continuation of the same life. Going to
[2:15:30] read one quote of the prophet and the
[2:15:34] the brother Rashan
[2:15:36] [Music]
[2:15:37] just said it so well but just in the
[2:15:40] same continuity of what we have been
[2:15:42] speaking
[2:15:43] and not adding anything just to put in
[2:15:48] the same continuity of the statue of the
[2:15:50] perfect man. And the prophet says, as
[2:15:52] this song says, God condescending to his
[2:15:56] creation.
[2:15:58] God wants to be worshiped. The word of
[2:16:01] God, the word God means object of
[2:16:04] worship. It's God trying to condition
[2:16:08] his people so he can get from them what
[2:16:12] he created them for. Amen.
[2:16:15] The word of God came to condition us to
[2:16:18] put that in a certain atmosphere to make
[2:16:20] us aware of what God is doing so that he
[2:16:23] can get from us what created us for.
[2:16:28] And then prophet continues, he never
[2:16:30] made you to be something else besides a
[2:16:34] son and a daughter of God. If you have
[2:16:37] missed that of being a son or daughter
[2:16:40] of God, you have missed the mark. Lord,
[2:16:44] I don't want to miss the mark. I want to
[2:16:47] be your son and your daughter of God
[2:16:50] to express you to have to express your
[2:16:53] nature, your life. As we heard this
[2:16:56] morning, we can know so many things. But
[2:16:59] Lord, if I miss the life, the literal
[2:17:01] life of Jesus Christ, then what have I
[2:17:04] gained? Lord, I desire your life. I
[2:17:06] desire to be you Lord. I want I want the
[2:17:10] second phase of the three-fold purpose
[2:17:12] of God to be manifested in my life. I
[2:17:15] like what he said denominations they are
[2:17:17] preaching they are preaching and good
[2:17:19] sometimes very eloquent preachers and
[2:17:21] very good preachers very nice things
[2:17:24] putting the scriptures here and there
[2:17:26] and then comp comparing but they don't
[2:17:28] know the phase where they are they don't
[2:17:31] know the scripture pertaining for our
[2:17:33] time but God by his mercy and grace he
[2:17:37] has chosen us and he has revealed to us
[2:17:39] what he's doing now for our time the
[2:17:42] same life that was in in the in the
[2:17:45] grain now it was in the tassel as a
[2:17:48] shackle now it is in the grain again
[2:17:51] back to the grain again and we are in
[2:17:53] that time harvest time to manifest the
[2:17:56] same life of Jesus Christ coming to the
[2:17:59] maturity isn't that your desire
[2:18:02] that's my desire this morning my heart
[2:18:05] is just stirring as I was listening to
[2:18:08] the word of God the seven the seven
[2:18:13] menu or or meal complete that we have
[2:18:16] received this morning. I I I don't want
[2:18:19] to take long but just want that meditate
[2:18:21] upon that you may maybe let's go back
