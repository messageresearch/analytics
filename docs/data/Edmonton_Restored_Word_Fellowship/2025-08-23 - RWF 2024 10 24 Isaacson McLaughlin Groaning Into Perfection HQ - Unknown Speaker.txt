Some glad morning when his life is over, I'll fly away to a home on God's celestial shore. I'll fly away. I'll fly away. I'll fly away. I won't die. Hallelujah. By and by, I'll fly away. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. I want her to sing Holy Belief from the first verse to the last verse.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we bless your holy name &gt;&gt; for your mercies and grace upon our life. &gt;&gt; Dear Lord, you see the hands that have been lifted up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, even including my hands, &gt;&gt; Father, we have lifted it up because we are needy people. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; and we know you are the only one that can help us. &gt;&gt; You are the only one that can heal us. &gt;&gt; You are the only one that can deliver us.

Father, for no one come before you and go back the same. &gt;&gt; May your Holy Spirit take absolute control, Lord, &gt;&gt; even as your word is about to be read, &gt;&gt; Father, may the anointing of God fall upon it, Lord, &gt;&gt; and sow seeds of life in the heart of your people. Heal the sick and afflicted among us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Even those who are streaming from home, may you touch them, Lord, &gt;&gt; whatever they are, Lord, meet each and every one of us at the point of our contact.

Father, Lord, your servant is reporting to duty. Father, anoint me to speak to the needs of thy people. May the great Holy Spirit take our full control. Bless us oh God that we will say like a people that were coming from bowels. Did not our heart burn within us even as we were part of the word. Come once again Lord that great shiver wave and beware among your people &gt;&gt; that we will come to the maturity to the stature of a perfect man. Father bless us once again this morning. Bless the pastor of the house. Bless his home, his family, his children and grandchildren. Lord, bless the officers at the gates. Bless the musicians. Lord, bless every brother, every sister. Lord, even those who have traveled, may your grace is sufficient with them. &gt;&gt; As many that couldn't come, whatever they are, may the same angel of God be with them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you for this morning, for the privilege and opportunity to come before you. &gt;&gt; Come, Lord, and bless us, Father. There's many other blessings we ask and receive in the name of Jesus Christ we have prayed. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let us give a hand of applause unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Shall we be seated a while so that we can come up and read a scripture again? &gt;&gt; I greet you all this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am very happy and delighted to be among you &gt;&gt; and I thank God for the opportunity given to me to share the word of life with you. &gt;&gt; I want to appreciate pastor se for opening the pulpit for fellowship even though he have not met me before or have not about me but when the recommendation came he did not opt out. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "A good shepherd, a good pastor always want the best for his congregation." &gt;&gt; He has an ambition to better the people, to better the church. Amen. And amen. I want to bring greetings from the saints and family back home in West Africa and the friends in East Africa also send your greetings. Pastor John Dana called yesterday. He sent his greetings from Miss Saga and Pastor Samuel in Manitoba also sent his greetings. I hope you receive them all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is my first time in this part of Canada. You just bear with me. Pastor asked me to speak slowly so that you can get my my my words. And unfortunately, I'm not a slow preacher, &gt;&gt; but I'm going to have a lesson Sunday school teaches. So pardon me if I skip my limit. &gt;&gt; I believe the Lord will bless us all. &gt;&gt; I want to give my sincere appreciation to the pastor and the wife for taking good care of me. I feel at home &gt;&gt; the little time the little day I've been with them. &gt;&gt; And uh somehow somewhere I really enjoy myself. &gt;&gt; From from the meals and everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. You know, I was surprised when they took me to the restaurant the first day. But yesterday when she prepared some meal, I was like, "Wow, this is better than a restaurant." &gt;&gt; I didn't know why. What you went to the restaurant for? And somehow I was selecting the seal to wear today. So I pick one of them I'll be wearing all over and I position it. But later they call me that this suit want to give out. When I tried it, it fit me perfectly. So I told the pastor, I'm going to wear you to preach today. &gt;&gt; So God reserve and preserve that suit for me. &gt;&gt; When you close, you shake the hand of the pastor for making me look beautiful and handsome before the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Doesn't it fit me? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a blessing to me. &gt;&gt; I know what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When I was in Manitoba, we're trying to buy some suit. It was expensive. So I thought of going back home and buy it and somehow the Lord have blessed me here. &gt;&gt; It's a great blessing to me &gt;&gt; and I really appreciate you so much. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. Just feel at home. Don't worry about this little boy standing here. &gt;&gt; Just look behind. &gt;&gt; There is a man in there that can turn the lights. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. And uh we will share some missionary testimonies along also. I am grateful to see a servant of God that believe in a five-fold ministry &gt;&gt; that God still have apostles. God still have evangelists. God still have prophet and teachers. &gt;&gt; And I give God the glory. And somehow somewhere he he delve into the supernatural. He was beginning to speak ahead of my notes. &gt;&gt; When he was talking, even the song I will fly away is all part of the notes. &gt;&gt; And I believe the Holy Ghost is here. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have been awake since 3:00 a.m. to now &gt;&gt; and anytime God wakes me up early Sunday morning, I know he have something special. &gt;&gt; So he said, "My servant wake up because some people have some needs &gt;&gt; and I want you to bring to them." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know when the woman keeps long in the kitchen and you are hungry or the food is not coming, don't worry. &gt;&gt; She's doing her best. &gt;&gt; So when God wakes you up that way, God want the best for his people. Not for me but for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And tonight, God willing, we will be in brother church. Brother Ed and Mistress, please uh end time vis tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you all. I bring greetings from Pastor Barry in Calgary also. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He sends his greetings. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So now let's open our Bibles to the book of Romans. Okay. Romans chapter 8 verse 19. Let us hear God's word. Romans chapter 8 verse 19. Let me even start from verse 18 even though it's not there. Let's read. I'll read it first then we continue from verse 19. For I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now let's go to the verse 19. Now for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who had subjected the same in hope. Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption &gt;&gt; into the glorious liberty of the children of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; For we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together unto now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruit of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even we ourselves grown within ourselves &gt;&gt; waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For we Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; May the Lord add his blessing to the reading of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Shall we humbly be seated? There are many scriptures to be uh read this morning. Then we read our second scripture from first Corinthians. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let me see. Let's let's read the 2 Corinthians. 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 1 to to 6. 2 Corinthians chapter 5 that is slice 8 you get it there verse one to six go to slice 8 you'll find it there for we know that if our earthly tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God &gt;&gt; and house not made revance &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; eternal in heavens Amen. &gt;&gt; For in this we grown earnestly, desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do grown being burdened. Not for that which we be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up in life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he that has wrought us for the same self thing is God, who also had given unto us the earnest of the spirit. Where therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body, &gt;&gt; we are absent from the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to give a little title to our message this morning. Groing into perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Growing into perfection. You see, if you don't have the spirit of God, you will not know what we are talking about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. That is why it is very essential. Oh, blessed be in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is very important to have the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the Holy Spirit is the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me read again from Galatians chapter 4 verse 1-7. Now I say that here as long as he is a child different nothing from a servant. Amen. Amen. Slide 16. You get it there. Okay. Different nothing from a servant. But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world. But when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his son, &gt;&gt; made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. Amen. &gt;&gt; And because ye are sons, God had sent forth the spirit of his son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Into your hearts. &gt;&gt; Crying aba father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Crying aba father. Wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son. &gt;&gt; Praise God. and if a son then and hear of God through Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That is the endest expectation &gt;&gt; of creature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, in the beginning, it was man that fell. &gt;&gt; But here is it. The falling of man brought the falling of nature. Brother Abraham said God didn't create tongues on a tree. &gt;&gt; Before sin came in the garden, there was nothing like tongs. When Adam want mango, he said mango come, it falls on his hand. &gt;&gt; Adam can play with the lion and even put the hand in the mouth of the lion. &gt;&gt; There was harmony and everything was perfect peace. But when the fall came, &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The scripture say, "For the creature was made subject to vanity." &gt;&gt; Not willingly, but by the reason of him who had subjected the same in hope. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption &gt;&gt; unto the glorious liberty of the children of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; In other words, since the fall of man brought the fall of the creation or the nature, the redemption of man brings the liberty of the creatures also. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; For we know the whole creation groanneth. &gt;&gt; I don't know whether you know the meaning of groaning. &gt;&gt; Somebody groaning. &gt;&gt; Groaning. Hallelujah. And travaleth in pain together until now. Before the falling garden of Eden, there was nothing like global warming. &gt;&gt; What is global warming today? &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. It came as a result of the fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before the fall, there were no tongues. But after sin came in the garden, now there were tongues on the tree. When Adam hold the tree, ouch. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What happened? It is because of that estate, the fallen estate of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And not only they, not nature alone, but ourselves also which have the first fruit of the spirit. &gt;&gt; It is not for everybody. &gt;&gt; But those who have the first fruits &gt;&gt; of the spirit. &gt;&gt; If you don't have the first fruit of the spirit, you don't know what we are talking about. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. If you don't have the first fruit of the spirit, there is nothing in you to grown. &gt;&gt; Why are we groaning? We are growing into that perfection. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. &gt;&gt; We are groaning into the fullness of our adoption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are groaning into maturity. But ourselves also which have the first fruit of the spirit. The first fruit of the spirit is the holy spirit. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the first fruit &gt;&gt; the shiv wave &gt;&gt; that will shave over the rest of the crops that they will grow and come into that maturity. &gt;&gt; He was the first fruit of the womb &gt;&gt; that opened the womb before the rest were born. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; And not only they but ourself also which have the first fruit of the spirit. &gt;&gt; And when he rose on the third day on that resurrection, he rose on that third day for our justification. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And after he rose on his resurrection and he went at the day of Pentecost, he gave the first fruit to the church of the firstborn. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even we ourselves grown within ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are a believer and you feel comfortable in this world, &gt;&gt; then there is something wrong with you. then you have not yet the first fruit. &gt;&gt; Because if you have the first fruit, &gt;&gt; there will be a deep &gt;&gt; calling onto the deep &gt;&gt; and there will be a deep somewhere &gt;&gt; to respond to that deep call. &gt;&gt; We are growing within ourself waiting for the adoption &gt;&gt; to with the redemption of our body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Before we continue, I want you to see something here. We want to quote from the message, divine healing. Thank you, Father. Let me see the paragraph, the the the slice and let you know. Did you get it? Yeah. Very good. I 26. Okay. Let's see what the prophet is saying here. He said there it is the whole thing and how we love it. Isn't it food to your soul? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Isn't it food to your soul? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the congregation says &gt;&gt; amen. And every time we believe that little speck in there just get bigger. &gt;&gt; Oh glory. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit when it comes into your heart it is like a little button. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Anytime we believe &gt;&gt; that little spe begin to get bigger &gt;&gt; bigger &gt;&gt; swirls out &gt;&gt; till after a while it just becomes you believe all things. &gt;&gt; There were some things you couldn't believe some years ago. &gt;&gt; There were some quote you were struggling some years ago. &gt;&gt; But what happened today? Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Today you don't struggle to believe them &gt;&gt; because you are growing. &gt;&gt; And revelation is progressing. &gt;&gt; The more you grow, the more you know. &gt;&gt; And we know better things today &gt;&gt; than what we know before. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nobody go to the hospital and give birth to a man. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; A full grown man. And the baby will come from the living room with Yes. No. No. Sisters, have you seen some before? But when you go to the living room, you give birth to babies. &gt;&gt; But the baby will not be a baby forever. &gt;&gt; There are processes that it goes through &gt;&gt; to grow. &gt;&gt; And as all things begin to come in, love begin. It comes in doubt, hatred, malice, fear, it just flies out like that. &gt;&gt; Because there is no stream, there is no lake, there is no river that produces sweet and sour taste at the same time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Where there is love, there can't be hatred. &gt;&gt; Where there is love, there can't be &gt;&gt; balance. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where there is fear, there can't be faith. &gt;&gt; But when fear is out, &gt;&gt; then faith comes in. &gt;&gt; And no one can serve two masters at the same time. &gt;&gt; You remember the story of that Indian dog? He told the prophet, I have two dogs in me. One is black and one is white. and I'm confused. I don't know which one is ruling me. So the prophet told him, the one you feed most &gt;&gt; is the one that rules over you. &gt;&gt; If you feed on righteousness, you will produce righteousness. &gt;&gt; If you feed on filthiness, you produce immorality. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So hatred and malice moves out when love comes in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't tell me you love the Lord when you hate your brother. Faith without works is death. &gt;&gt; Show me your faith and I will tell you of your works. &gt;&gt; Show me your works and I will tell you of your faith. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's continue reading here. It spreads out. It gets so big it till it bust the little old shell out. See what I mean? All the world is pitch. But now look here. We grow daily in the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Let me take my time. &gt;&gt; The pastor said I have my liberty. &gt;&gt; So let me have my liberty here. &gt;&gt; We grow daily in the grace of God. The word here is grow. &gt;&gt; When a baby is feeding and the baby is not growing, then there is something wrong with the child. &gt;&gt; You better take him to the hospital. &gt;&gt; And ask your daughter, "What is wrong with my baby?" &gt;&gt; We grow only on Sundays. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Every day. &gt;&gt; Only on 31st night, December night. &gt;&gt; No. But we grow daily. &gt;&gt; And Paul said, "I die daily." &gt;&gt; And the sister wrote the prophet, "How can I grow deeper in the love of God?" Said, "Read your Bible &gt;&gt; and pray every day." &gt;&gt; Read your Bible and pray &gt;&gt; every day. &gt;&gt; Did he say read your Bible and pray only on Sundays? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or Wednesday service. Yes. &gt;&gt; But every day, &gt;&gt; we grow daily. &gt;&gt; Just as physically, we eat every day. &gt;&gt; If we don't eat, we die. &gt;&gt; If we don't eat or if you don't feed this body, we die. &gt;&gt; Then if we don't feed the inner man, &gt;&gt; we also die spiritually. &gt;&gt; And as this body, as this outer man feeds physical things to survive, to grow, so our soul feed on spiritual things &gt;&gt; to survive and to grow. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true. And the food for the soul is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Our souls feed on the word. &gt;&gt; So remember, we grow daily in the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I die daily." &gt;&gt; But if you have spiritual discernment, he also resurrect daily. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if he die daily, why does he die tomorrow? Because he resurrect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We fall daily. We sin daily. We backslide daily. But we confess daily. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are forgiven daily &gt;&gt; and we rise up daily. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we press on daily. &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; There is no point of stopping in this journey. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yesterday pastor made me watch the movie of Moses and when they came out of Egypt. If you see the joy in the faces of the people when Pharaoh finally gave them the ready to go. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said let my people go. The sound of freedom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Alone. Oh my God. They have not yet left Egypt that there was something in them already rejoicing &gt;&gt; knowing there is freedom. &gt;&gt; And you can never appreciate deliverance if you have never been in bondage. &gt;&gt; You can never appreciate healing if you have never been sick before. &gt;&gt; You can never appreciate salvation if you have never been lost before. The people were packing their things rejoicing in the movie. &gt;&gt; Even the old were being carried and put on the horse. &gt;&gt; The blind were being carried. They did not leave an hoof behind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of the joy of freedom, &gt;&gt; because of the joy of deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before they set on their way, they are already rejoicing. &gt;&gt; That is how it is. When the word of God is declared to you that by my stripe you are healed, you begin to rejoice &gt;&gt; even before you feel any pain. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. &gt;&gt; You begin to rejoice because the word have declared the blessings to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you remember the story when Austria was going to war the prophet talk about a man I forgot his name and he says they were given freedom when the sun comes up that the next morning when the sun comes up is your freedom. &gt;&gt; So one man have to go up on the mountain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. At the breaking of the day when he saw the sun about to move out, he shout down to the people there is freedom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The rest might not have seen the sun rising, &gt;&gt; but when they heard the proclamation of the freedom, they jump into it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They jumped to it because they were waiting on the rising of the sun &gt;&gt; to be their freedom. &gt;&gt; Yes. The people were rejoicing, rejoicing. 2 million people and here comes the resi. I thought that was the end of the movie. I asked pastor Abd said, "No, they are going to trials." And then when the resi comes the way, they asked Moses, "Were there no better grapes in Egypt?" &gt;&gt; Oh, we miss the honey and the garlic and onions of Egypt. That is how sometimes most of us fail. &gt;&gt; When a little triumph comes our way, &gt;&gt; we begin to remember our denomination. &gt;&gt; We begin to remember the things of the world and we call it good old days. That was bad old days. &gt;&gt; There is nothing good than what you are having now. &gt;&gt; This is a real &gt;&gt; good new day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God made a way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Through the water. &gt;&gt; He makes a way through the fire. &gt;&gt; He makes a way for every situation. &gt;&gt; And pastor asked a question. Can you believe these people were some few minutes ago rejoicing &gt;&gt; because of the deliverance and yet they are now murmuring because of a little obstacle. &gt;&gt; If God brings you to it, &gt;&gt; he will take you across. &gt;&gt; Amen. We serve a faithful God &gt;&gt; who will never leave us or forsake us. &gt;&gt; He is a mighty conqueror. &gt;&gt; He's a great counselor. &gt;&gt; He's a mighty and terrible God. &gt;&gt; There is nothing too hard for him to do. &gt;&gt; He didn't bring us here to lose us. He brought us here to take us home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, faithful is he that has become &gt;&gt; and he will surely accomplish it. If he cannot carry us through, he will not waste his time to bring us here. &gt;&gt; But he is a faithful God. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We grow daily in the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's see what the prophet of God is saying here. He said the new birth. Glory. Hallelujah. Oh, sorry. I I was the one who jump higher. I went hard the same place you are. It's the best, right? Yeah. He said, "Now you notice those people, they can sit and say, well, I accept the Lord. You take their word for it. I would too. I can't judge." Who are we to judge? &gt;&gt; God does. But in 10 years from now, they have never progressed a bit. &gt;&gt; Just staying right in the same old place. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; you can imagine you give birth to a little baby, you breastfeeding 6 months, he's not growing. You give him cereal, every baby food, and it's still not growing. &gt;&gt; That means there is something wrong. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Then we're going to change the food &gt;&gt; because we grow by what we feed on. &gt;&gt; So if you have been coming to church for 10 years and you are still that old person, there is something wrong with you. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's not a food. It is a yummy delicious food but your system cannot carry it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they are the same. They are still in the same old place. Have you thought of that if the Lord tries 10 years from now where will you be? &gt;&gt; What will be your spiritual status? &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; will you be sitting at home just playing table not going to church &gt;&gt; or you going to come when the saints are guarded? &gt;&gt; Let's ask ourself &gt;&gt; just a little trial the world went through through Corona era in 2020. &gt;&gt; Look at the church today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When the government lock the door, sit at home, only 50 people come to church and that spirit has swept among believers &gt;&gt; and corona is over. But the curse of corona has kept people home &gt;&gt; they love the comfort of their cozy chairs &gt;&gt; that will come to the presence of the lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And people are worse now than they were five years before &gt;&gt; corona. Yes, &gt;&gt; true. That's true. &gt;&gt; But listen here. We grow daily. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But has repeated it again. We grow daily. &gt;&gt; You can imagine a little baby you born today, tomorrow he's here, the next day is even taller than you, &gt;&gt; even bigger than you. &gt;&gt; But this is just a baby. The pastor will say Steve is my baby but he's bigger than you now but that is a little baby you carried in your hand. What happened &gt;&gt; physically? &gt;&gt; We grow daily. So if we grow daily physically then we got to grow spiritually. &gt;&gt; He said we grow daily. Each day our heart hungers, &gt;&gt; oh glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Keeps moving on. &gt;&gt; There is something growing inside of you. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; As the gospel is going forth this morning, I want to tell you there is something growing inside of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Unless there's nothing in you. &gt;&gt; But those who there is something in us, there is something growing in you. &gt;&gt; And that which is growing in you is that which is growing for that perfection. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You get bigger, spread out, &gt;&gt; can take more. Paul said when you he told the Corinthians church he said you are maturing growing but when you ought to be churches you are still babies needing teaching. Is that right? &gt;&gt; When you ought to be teachers to him much is given much is expected. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I've not shown to declare unto you the whole council of God. &gt;&gt; The whole council of God in this end time has been declared to us &gt;&gt; and to him much is given. Much is expected. &gt;&gt; God expect much from us than the denominations &gt;&gt; because we know the problem of God in this time. &gt;&gt; We know the plan of God. We know the church order. We know about God than those in the denominational cycles. We got to come to the expectation that God expect. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; May the Lord have mercy this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; something in there growing out, pushing out, making bigger the Holy Spirit grow in. &gt;&gt; You don't get the Holy Ghost and go and sleep. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. The prophet said one of the evidence of a spiritfilled man is the travailing of the soul. &gt;&gt; He's always travailing. He need more of God. &gt;&gt; And you will not deserve more of God unless there is God here. &gt;&gt; And when there is God there, that is when you deserve more of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to the next one. The new birth. It says here if a birth is born from the outside &gt;&gt; from the inside out the child it grows if it leaves. If it doesn't it remains. Is that right? Well a birth is on the inside shouldn't it grow? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. When you think or you feel the doctor declared you pregnant maybe one week old or two week old pregnant it seems there's nothing in your belly might be flatter than even mine but there is something in &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; but that thing in you that fetus begin to what grow with time grow enlarges it grows but when there is nothing going on when There is no growth. &gt;&gt; You can imagine five month or 6 month and the belly is like this then something has gone wrong. &gt;&gt; There is no life. &gt;&gt; It's dead. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But if there is life &gt;&gt; as time goes on it must grow. &gt;&gt; Brother says shouldn't it grow? &gt;&gt; It must grow. &gt;&gt; The Christ in your heart ought to be growing daily. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Christ in your heart ought to be growing daily. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not weekly, &gt;&gt; not monthly, not yearly, but daily. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; The Psalmist said, "Daily walking close to thee. &gt;&gt; Let it be, dear Lord. Let it be &gt;&gt; daily. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not just one is this service or Sunday service, but daily the Christ in your heart &gt;&gt; ought to be growing, getting bigger, &gt;&gt; more powerful, understanding things better. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The things we couldn't understand yesterday, today we understand it better. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the things we are not understanding in this world, we will understand it better by and by. &gt;&gt; When we get there in the fullness of our adoption, &gt;&gt; we will understand it better by and by. &gt;&gt; The Christ in our hearts ought to be growing daily, getting bigger, forgiving, &gt;&gt; working on as God will to Christ be formed in you &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you have no ability to forgive, then Satan have rented your heart. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Then there is something wrong with you. &gt;&gt; The root of bitterness will kill you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It will defile you and it will defile others. &gt;&gt; But when Christ, oh hallelujah, &gt;&gt; is growing in your heart daily, &gt;&gt; you are forgiven. Yes. &gt;&gt; When somebody step you to I forgive you. &gt;&gt; Even when they don't apologize. &gt;&gt; I know you hurt me by forgiving you. &gt;&gt; It means you are the big guy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; It is children that fight on little petty petty things. &gt;&gt; The top is for me. This coffee belongs to me. This sweet is mine. And the children fight over sweet. Have you seen grown up people fight over sweet? &gt;&gt; And when they pass and you see little kids fight over sweet. Oh, I remember when we were kids, honey. Do you remember when we were kids? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like the prophet remember while he hide a toffee from his brother when he stole the handful of popcorn. His kids. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can a full grown man have bitterness? &gt;&gt; How can brethren, fullgrown brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; not forgiving one another &gt;&gt; by biting one another? &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; fighting one another. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; they're not babies. Yes. &gt;&gt; But you got to grow in grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to come to maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Walking on as God will &gt;&gt; till Christ be formed in you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "We must contend with the weak until they are fully matured in Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No matter how this hand is weak is still part of this body. &gt;&gt; Nobody is useless. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The scripture says the less dishonored, the less that is horned, the least part of the body is what God greatly horned. &gt;&gt; We are part born by the spirit of God. By one spirit are we all baptized into one body and that is a mystical body of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Got to contend with the weak, &gt;&gt; with one another. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Some are weak, some are feeble, &gt;&gt; but you going to contend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We going to contain until they are fully matured in Christ. &gt;&gt; Then they are good soldiers. Then they have got the full armor. talk about them. Don't hurt them. &gt;&gt; The things that you hear before when somebody say about you, you get all rough. You got enough beef to fight the goo. &gt;&gt; When you hear it, it's God behind. What happened? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is because Christ in you is growing &gt;&gt; daily. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Oh, maybe he didn't hear what I said about. He heard it, but he has grown. &gt;&gt; He has grown out. He have left it behind. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Love of them. Make fun of them. They don't pay no attention to it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They got one thing. They are just too big. My just so full of glory. The only thing you have to drop is this old rope of flesh &gt;&gt; and just go on right to glory. &gt;&gt; This body you see here is not a real you. &gt;&gt; This is not the real Isaac. &gt;&gt; This body is a pest house. &gt;&gt; It's just a container. Yes. &gt;&gt; But the real thing is there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said somebody say, you know, somebody said he was a hypocrite. Mrs. Jones, I hope there's no Mrs. Jones here. He said did well. God bless them. &gt;&gt; That means you have earned the career of the tail bearer. &gt;&gt; She couldn't succeed to put seed of discord. Do you know a certain certain thing is going on at that church or not it to be going? Well, I will pray for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not my business. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What goes on in this church is not my business. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What goes on in that church is not my business. &gt;&gt; What is my business is the cross before me. &gt;&gt; And the world behind me. &gt;&gt; How to be a better Christian than I was yesterday. How Christ ought to be growing in me daily. &gt;&gt; How I ought to be growing daily in the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, father. He said, "Oh, if you you are little then you will say, oh, is it? Let me get in which side by side join." See, that is where you get in trouble. That's where you can mature &gt;&gt; when you are willing to take sides &gt;&gt; to cause commotion to cause stri and fight in the church. &gt;&gt; You are not a real Christian. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you get big enough, &gt;&gt; large enough, &gt;&gt; you see swell out. Not only swell out, but grown out. Christ growing in you, &gt;&gt; growing out malice, &gt;&gt; growing out hatred, &gt;&gt; growing out backbiting, &gt;&gt; growing out envy and jealousy, &gt;&gt; taking it out of you, &gt;&gt; push it out, &gt;&gt; as God comes in, just pushes out. You say, "Oh, how little, how juvenile it is, &gt;&gt; how much kiss it is &gt;&gt; to argue and fast." &gt;&gt; But first thing you know, that just grows on over top of it. &gt;&gt; And God no more room for it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, I used to hate to see this and hate that. But you know, I just got so I just don't pay any attention to it no more. You are growing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And when you begin to grow, nobody will tell you to pay your tithe. &gt;&gt; The pastor don't have to make note about tight paying. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you know the best to do. Yes, &gt;&gt; you know the better thing to do. &gt;&gt; A ministry of this that have grown like this, the pastor have no right to waste the time to preach about Taipei &gt;&gt; because that is the obligation of every Christian &gt;&gt; to be part of every member of every church. The prophet says there are three things that qualifies you to be a member of a local assembly. First is your presence. Secondly is your tithe. And third is your offering. &gt;&gt; Your tithe and offering qualifies you plus your present to be part of the body of Christ here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; So if Christ is growing in you, &gt;&gt; you will learn how to pay your tithe. &gt;&gt; Oh, this preacher is picking on us because the pastor said it. &gt;&gt; But Abraham said in a message, how can I overcome? Yes. &gt;&gt; He said the ministers study such places. They look over the congregation and where they see they are falling short, they pick it from there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So this morning I'm picking from there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you are growing, &gt;&gt; you will pay your tithe. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, you go to the next one. Yeah, you know when you are young they claim you have growing pains when you are growing you know what I mean it means you are getting bigger you know you take your little arms will hurt your legs will hurt when you are growing kids even when a baby is teaching You see little baby sick, &gt;&gt; crying, everything. &gt;&gt; It's because he's growing, &gt;&gt; he begin to bring teeth. Everything hurts. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I had it. I was getting bigger all the time. Oh my. Hallelujah. Sometimes we have growing pains when we get to be men and women. when we are born in the kingdom of God Christ. But the thing about that it hurts. The thing about this it just makes you so joyful and happy. It's growing pains. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; You are going out. You are getting bigger. Getting to be bigger man now. What you used to be. You can look over things. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; To look over things. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Not just got wider shoulders. That don't mean nothing about it. But you are wider in here. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, not across here, &gt;&gt; but in here in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In here. Here is where you supposed to spread out, &gt;&gt; get bigger in your heart &gt;&gt; on the inside. &gt;&gt; When Christ comes into the heart, &gt;&gt; then he comes into the mouth. Oh, glory be to God. Then he comes into the eyes. &gt;&gt; He comes into the mind. Let the mind of Christ be you. &gt;&gt; He comes into the mouth. He makes you talk different. &gt;&gt; You don't cuss. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He makes you speak. Bible said gracious words &gt;&gt; proceed out of him. &gt;&gt; Anytime you talk, he bring comfort. Yes. &gt;&gt; The scripture said, "Greet one another with hymns and spiritual songs. &gt;&gt; Let our words be seasoned with salt." &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord that when a brother comes around you, all that they hear is testimonies, &gt;&gt; testimonies upon testimony. &gt;&gt; That the discouraged comes to you and they become encouraged. &gt;&gt; And the sick get around and they are healed. Because when Christ here gets bigger here, he comes out here. &gt;&gt; He get bigger here. You see holy things. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; And then he gets into the mind. You talk different. You don't talk like you used to. &gt;&gt; Christ got in your mouth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When Christ got in your mouth, you stop complaining. &gt;&gt; And sisters, when Christ got your mouth, you stop nagging. Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; All that you can say is praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There is no food at home. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; That mouth cannot praise the Lord and be cursing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And be fighting and abusing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And murmuring. Mamming is an insult to God. &gt;&gt; God hate complainers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God hate mamming. When they were mingling, God signed serpent to bite them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A Christian does not complain. &gt;&gt; A Christian does not mama, &gt;&gt; but a Christian always praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said grow now from your heart your love you had for him till you can grow your tongue. Brother, that is a great thing. Then the next thing you know, it grows into your eyes. The next thing you know, you find out that the old lustful things you used to look at, you would turn your head. &gt;&gt; You are growing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "When you see a naked woman on the street, you turn your head." &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; Nobody will tell you, you will turn it because you are growing. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the first thing you know, you still turn your head, &gt;&gt; but you are thinking. See, after a while, it grows into your mind. You don't even think about it no more. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. Then you just a great big boy. Then you are coming into a full matured man living for the Lord. So then you are in Christ then a new creature. &gt;&gt; Oh blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then you begin to sing thanks to Calvary. &gt;&gt; I am not a man that I used to be. &gt;&gt; Thanks to Calvary. &gt;&gt; Oh blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's read first Corinthians 13 9-30. That is slice three. Yeah. For we know in part and we prophesy &gt;&gt; in part. But when he But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. &gt;&gt; When I was a child, &gt;&gt; I speak as a child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I understood as a child. &gt;&gt; I thought &gt;&gt; like a child. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when I became a man, I put away childish things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know even as also I am known. &gt;&gt; I shall know him. &gt;&gt; And now abided faith, hope, charity, these three, but the greatest of these is charity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we getting somewhere, church? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you know in part, &gt;&gt; you prophesy in part. But in this end time, at the opening of the full word, at the opening of the seventh seal, the full word was born in manifestation. &gt;&gt; So you have no excuse to know in part. &gt;&gt; But you have the right to know full revelation of the word of God. &gt;&gt; But when that which is perfect is come, &gt;&gt; then that which is part is done away. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a perfect interpretation of the perfect word of God. &gt;&gt; When I was a child, I spake as a child. &gt;&gt; I understood as a child. &gt;&gt; I taught even as a child. &gt;&gt; Yes, it's true. &gt;&gt; But when I became a man, &gt;&gt; I put away childish chains. &gt;&gt; Sisters, put away childish chains. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brothers, put away childish things. Lord, &gt;&gt; let's come back to the church order. &gt;&gt; Let's come back to holiness. &gt;&gt; Let's come back to DC. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's come back to the prayers. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; let's come back to the Holy Ghost revival. &gt;&gt; Let's come back to paying our tit offering. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Chains. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read from Hebrews 6 verse 1-2. Slice four. He said, "Therefore living the principles of the doctrine of Christ, &gt;&gt; let us go into perfection, &gt;&gt; church, let us go into perfection." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and faith towards God, of doctrines, of baptism, and of laying of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of internal judgment. The bride must come to perfection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride must come to full maturity. &gt;&gt; The ministry must come to full maturity. &gt;&gt; We are no longer babies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read from first Peter 2 verse 2-3. Yeah. As newborn babies, desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow by. If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord is gracious. &gt;&gt; I said the Lord is gracious. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, babies take milk. &gt;&gt; Let's read from Hebrews 5:12. Hebrews 5:12 says here, "For when the time you ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again, which be the first principles of the oracles of God, and have become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat. For everyone that use milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But strong meat belonger to them that are of fool age. &gt;&gt; Even those who by reason of use their senses exercise to desend both good and of evil. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The scripture we read in first Peter says as newborn baby desire the sincere milk of the word. Yeah, &gt;&gt; as newborn babies, you believe the Lord Jesus, you been baptized in water in Jesus name. Is good to desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow by. You don't take the milk of the word and don't grow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to grow. &gt;&gt; The church got to grow. &gt;&gt; The ministry got to grow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God has given us a testimony before, then we need more testimonies. &gt;&gt; If God has healed before, we need more healing. Amen. &gt;&gt; If God has given us deliverance before, we need more deliverances. &gt;&gt; If God has given salvation before, we need more salvation. &gt;&gt; We no longer remain babies. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A baby today that hunger and thirst for milk. When the baby grows, he does not deserve milk again. &gt;&gt; Paul said you have to become preachers. Now &gt;&gt; you don't have need of milk but of stone meat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you that have milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness is a baby. But strong meat belongth to them that are of full age. &gt;&gt; Oh glory be to God. That is why this message of the hour is not for everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is for grown men. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is for mature people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That can take it. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read some more scriptures and some more quotes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, let's read here the slice 11 that is in Matthew chapter 18 verse 10. The scripture says here, "Take heed that ye despise not these little one of these little ones. For I say unto you that in heaven the angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven." &gt;&gt; Yes sir. You see, brother, before you came to this world, God took you a picture, not the ones we have on our camera phone today. &gt;&gt; Some years go by, the Genesis will not understand us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You have to they will come a big camera and we react and when they finish, they will take the film and they go into a dark room. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To process a picture. So when you have been given a picture, you have the negative day and you can only process the negative and you bring out the positive. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So before we came to this world, God took us a picture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it takes the negative &gt;&gt; to develop the positive. &gt;&gt; But when God took us a picture, &gt;&gt; he kept the negative there. &gt;&gt; That is our little angel. That is our families &gt;&gt; the word body &gt;&gt; and brought a positive year. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our little angels are beholding the face of our father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the mansion the scripture is talking about. In my father house there are many mansions not the building. &gt;&gt; If this earthly tabernacle is being dissolved. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is one waiting for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A building up many of hands. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is our white body, our tony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is what we are growing into. &gt;&gt; And that is the fullness of our adoption. &gt;&gt; That is the perfection we are desiring for. &gt;&gt; Those who are the first fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Amenus. &gt;&gt; If you don't have the Holy Spirit, you will not know what we are talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's read from Romans 8. Thank you, Lord. Romans 8:11 14 uh slice 14. Romans 8:11. But in the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you. He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken &gt;&gt; your mortal bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the spirit that dwelleth in you. &gt;&gt; Before you receive that quickening, the spirit must first dwell in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By the spirit that dwelt in you. And if that spirit is in you, then he that rose up Christ from the grave, that same spirit, that same God shall quicken this mortal bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It takes us the same code. Let's go to slice 12. We continue from verse 14. Now, Romans 8:14-6. It says here, "For as many as are led by the spirit of God are the sons of God." &gt;&gt; For ye have not received the spirit of bondage against fear, but ye have received the spirit of abduction, &gt;&gt; whereby you cry, aba, father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The spirit itself beared witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. &gt;&gt; The children of God are the children of God and the children of the devil are the children of the devil. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. We go back to first Peter 1:23 slice 13 said, "Being born again, &gt;&gt; not of the corruptible seed, &gt;&gt; but of the incorruptible by the word of God, &gt;&gt; which liveth and abide forever. &gt;&gt; Our first birth was by the will of the flesh." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not the will of God. So our first birth produces death. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That is why we need another birth. &gt;&gt; That is why we need a second birth. That is why we need to be born again. &gt;&gt; That was the first doctrine Jesus preached. You must be born again. &gt;&gt; And you cannot be born again except by the water and by the spirit. &gt;&gt; And you can only be born again by the Holy Ghost baptism. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, not being born by the real of the flesh, but being born again, not of the corruptible seed, hallelujah, but all the incorruptible &gt;&gt; by the word of God. &gt;&gt; We live and abideth forever. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read from this uh message. Revelation chapter 5, part one, slice 30. How many are feeling good? &gt;&gt; Are you feeling good? &gt;&gt; Can you say a bigger amen? &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh 610611 chapter Revelation 5 part 1 paragraph 103. Oh, do you see it? All creation is groaning. Paul said everything is groaning. Look at these trees. How do you struggle &gt;&gt; these days? Winter don't come like the winter we know before. &gt;&gt; The falls don't show like the falls we know before. Even the timing in the season have changed. The spring doesn't come on time as it used to be. Look at the flowers how they struggle for life just for the fros to tear them down. Look at the trees how they struggle to hold their branches. How to sing glories unto God. &gt;&gt; If the trees and the leaves struggle to see glory to God, how much more human beings like you &gt;&gt; that can't even raise your hand and say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; And you come to church to be like a wallflower. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. &gt;&gt; When you come to church, be loose in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Turn yourself loose with the spirit &gt;&gt; and worship God in the spirit, &gt;&gt; with all your strength, with all your might. &gt;&gt; Don't come to church and be a bench warmer. &gt;&gt; You can't even say amen to the word of God. &gt;&gt; You come to church and be dozing off. &gt;&gt; You come to church, you can't say amen. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; the Lord is our spirit. &gt;&gt; And whatever the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. this out to be free. &gt;&gt; Be free in the liberty that God has made you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See everything, all nature, all animals, all birds, how it flies from the enemy quickly and get away. Everything groaning. And we ourselves said Paul, we grown too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Two with them. For we are waiting for the redemption of our body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; there is a better body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a better tabernacle &gt;&gt; waiting for us. &gt;&gt; Our little angel &gt;&gt; before the face of our father. &gt;&gt; In that body we don't get sick. &gt;&gt; In that body we don't grow old. &gt;&gt; That body has no gray hair. That body has no west pain. &gt;&gt; That body has no knee pain. &gt;&gt; It is a perfect body. &gt;&gt; That body don't die. &gt;&gt; Is internal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you get converted and born again, &gt;&gt; our soul is the one that God converted. So you know the funny thing here we are having a redeemed soul in an unredeemed body. &gt;&gt; That is where nature human carnal nature comes in &gt;&gt; and sometime the devil will tell you you are not saved. &gt;&gt; Hey get behind me Satan. &gt;&gt; I am saved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am waiting for that great translation &gt;&gt; when I'll be clothed. Why immortality will put on immortality. &gt;&gt; When the incorruptible will put on the corruption. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But now, now they did all those years until now. Now we have the endness of our inheritance. Oh my. What do we have? We have the evidence that God lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God lives. &gt;&gt; How do I know he lives? Because he lives in my heart. &gt;&gt; For our spirit bear record with his spirit that we are children of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Sorry, pastor. &gt;&gt; I couldn't go slow for you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Lord will help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we have the evidence that God lives. &gt;&gt; We have the evidence that God is with us. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is he not with us this afternoon? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We have the evidence that God has not forsaken us. &gt;&gt; He never forsake. He never is gone. So count on his presence in day and in gone. He is with us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That he has not forsaken us that we are his and he is ours. &gt;&gt; Because we in our bodies we now tabernacle the Holy Spirit of God that cries out aba father. Aba father. And there is nothing that can ever take that away. We are anchored in Christ. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you see the tree blowing, the wind blowing the tree like this, it is waiting for his redemption. &gt;&gt; If you see the leaves falling down, he's waiting for that redemption. &gt;&gt; If you lose a brother, if you lose a sister, if you lose a family, a loved one, don't worry. They are waiting for us. There is a better body. There is a better place than this sinful cursed world. There is a better place. &gt;&gt; Oh, there is a land beyond the river. [Music] &gt;&gt; No matter how rich you are, &gt;&gt; even if you have $1 million in your account, you will never be satisfied with this world. &gt;&gt; No matter how healthy you are, don't think because oh, he is sick, so he that is why he desiring that other place. Or don't think, oh, he's a poor preacher. He has no money, that is why he does not love the world. No, sir. &gt;&gt; It is not for the old man. &gt;&gt; It's not for the old woman. As young as you are, be mindful that there is a better place. &gt;&gt; There is a lineage on the river &gt;&gt; in the street by going to meet there again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; But Abraham said, "You might be deformed. You can even be walking like this, but that body will not be deformed. &gt;&gt; It's a perfect body." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For we are anchored in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, the trees does not have it. Nature does not have it. But yet, we are still groaning &gt;&gt; with them. Because as yet as we haven't received the fullness of our adoption, but we have the earnestness of it, that we were picked up from the things of the world and now become sons and daughters of God. What kind of people should we be? &gt;&gt; Oh my, when we think of that, think of it. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I wish we read a scripture before we continue this. &gt;&gt; Blessed be in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's read a scripture in Ephesians 1 11-4 slides 15. Then we'll come back to the where we were reading before. The scripture says here in Ephesians 1 verse 11-14, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, &gt;&gt; being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we should be to the praise of his glory. &gt;&gt; Yes. who first trusted in Christ. Sister, trust in Christ, &gt;&gt; brother. Let's trust in Christ. &gt;&gt; In whom ye also trusted after that ye have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also after that ye believed, you were saved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. with the Holy Spirit of promise &gt;&gt; which is the earnest of our inheritance. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is a down payment of what we are going into. &gt;&gt; It is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchase possession &gt;&gt; unto the praise of his glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; If God cannot change his body, he won't give you the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He gave you the Holy Ghost as a down payment. He gave you the Holy Ghost as a down payment that one day he can change this body. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, let's continue the last quote. The reading in 3131 from the message Revelation 5 part 1. He said now we have the earnestness. &gt;&gt; Our spirit is groaning for the full adoption. &gt;&gt; There is something grown in me &gt;&gt; for the perfection. &gt;&gt; I cannot be perfect in this flesh. My perfection is in him. &gt;&gt; When a deep call upon a deep, &gt;&gt; there's a deep somewhere to respond to the deep call. I can hear from my children &gt;&gt; screaming my name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; There is something beyond this flesh. &gt;&gt; There is something beyond this earthly realm. &gt;&gt; There is a supernatural presence. &gt;&gt; Our little babies, our little angels before the face of the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we receive the Holy Spirit, the first fruit, it is the end of our complete adoption or complete salvation. Oh, how beautiful. I just love that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. We are waiting for the fullness of adoption. &gt;&gt; This will take place when at the first resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we have here in this body like that we are and we will have a body like his own glorious body &gt;&gt; for we shall see him &gt;&gt; as he is &gt;&gt; and will be like him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; to be like Jesus. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; What a desire. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a desire. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Not to be like the pastor, not to be like the president, not to be like the prophet, but to be like Jesus. If you make any man role model that will fail you, &gt;&gt; your pastor will fail you. &gt;&gt; Your prophet will fail you, your president will fail you, your wife will fail you, your husband will fail you, your children will fail you. But Jesus will fail us &gt;&gt; and Jesus is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. For we shall see him as he is and will be like him. When he appears, we appear in his likeness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will have a body like his. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A glorious glorified body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And all the trial struggles of life will fade off into a living mist and blow away to never be no more. And the psalmist said just once glimpse of his face in glory all the toys of life will be repaid. &gt;&gt; You will never remember again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When a woman is going through birth pains oh no matter uncomfortable she feels and she go through labor and pushes out with tears and stress and cry and he will never give birth again. This pain is so painful. But the moment the baby comes out, &gt;&gt; the joy of life. &gt;&gt; She never f she never remembers that pain is vanish. And you see when he was going through the pain, I will never give up again. In two years time again, what happened? I thought you said you never go that again. Just one glaze, you will forget everything. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope my sister still loves me. Thank you, Lord. And these earthly tabernacles which we now grown in, we are waiting for that earnestness for the salvation fully in its fullness to come. But now in these tabernacles of clay, we have something that tells us we have raised up so far. Hallelujah. Amen. What is the NS? It is a little down payment that holds it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Dutch, brother Dutch is not here. Brother S is here as old as brother Dutch. He's the earnest. Now once when you love the things of the world. Once when we sin and went about doing the things of the world and cared not for God, we were annated from him without God, without Christ in the world. Now God sent his holy spirit. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God sent his holy spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; And through that we are lifted up from those things. &gt;&gt; Now we have the earnest that we know that we are passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Brother said without divine healing &gt;&gt; there is no resurrection. &gt;&gt; Because divine healing &gt;&gt; is the earnestness of the resurrection. The God that can heal this body is the same God that can raise his body. &gt;&gt; If you are sick this morning, receive your healing in the name of Jesus Christ. Behold, &gt;&gt; if God cannot heal us, God cannot resurrect us. But if God can heal us, then it is an evidence. It's a down that when this body be dissolved, he can rise up again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Slice 25 from the amazing questions and answers part three. He said the word that is in you &gt;&gt; the body will materialize around that word. &gt;&gt; And the same thing did by Sarah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we are preaching the word, are you are saying amen to the word? You are becoming the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are what you eat. &gt;&gt; As you receive the word, you become the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As we preach, oh, glory be to God. We go to Galatians 4:1 19 slide 6. It says, "My little children whom I travail in again unto Christ be form in you." Why are you preaching apostle? I am preaching for Christ to be form in you. &gt;&gt; Why do we come to church? We come to church for Christ to be formed in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This old world can never hold us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have met my consecration. &gt;&gt; Every woman to live is Christ. To die is gain. Oh death, where is your strength? grave. Where is your victory? But thanks be to God &gt;&gt; who has given us victory over death, over hell, over the grave. And we are more than conquerors. And this afternoon, we are sitting in the heavenly places &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; We are travailing. We are preaching. We are laboring unto Christ &gt;&gt; before you. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's read from slide 17. The end time seed. What happened? An infant church. Hallelujah. a bride in fancy &gt;&gt; that is the power of God has be to fall on her &gt;&gt; she's taking form &gt;&gt; sister take form &gt;&gt; let the word of God form you shape you this church must take form the ministry must take form &gt;&gt; she is taking form a bride to this bridegroom &gt;&gt; that three stars meant his perfection of the heavenly father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the trinity becoming one on earth among us. &gt;&gt; God offices becoming one office. What happened now is the church of the living God coming together under the word of God and the astronomic heaven is announcing her approach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Might not believe that but is a word is just the same. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Praise Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Wonderful Jesus. &gt;&gt; The bride in infancy. &gt;&gt; That was 1962. But in 2024, the bride is no more in the infancy. &gt;&gt; The bride is now a mature bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We have put away childish sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are no more babies. &gt;&gt; We are teachers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sl 18. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; And when the Holy Spirit that you have worshiped under for so long is the same Holy Spirit is just like a corn growing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just like a corn growing. When I was young, I love planting and as a child, I didn't understand better. So when I see people so corn on and they put fence around it, they put wood around it, my little mind was telling me it is the wood, the fence they put around it that makes the corn grow. So do you know what I did? When I put a seed, one seed I put fence around it, one seed I put sticks around it, one seed I put because in my mind is the wood making it grow. And unfortunately it will be growing and the leaves will be breaking the six because I didn't know. You understand? He said it's just like a corn growing. The first thing is a little stock. &gt;&gt; The next thing is a tassel. The next is a grain. The original that went into the ground. &gt;&gt; And what it is is it is it any different from the stock? The life was in the stock made the tassel &gt;&gt; and the grain &gt;&gt; but is a f mature stock corn. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what you Methodist and Lutherans, what is it? Is the same Holy Spirit that brought Luther out of this day, that brought Wley out of his day, is further mature church than what it was then for it is back to the original again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God. The life is back to the seed. &gt;&gt; The life that went through the carrier of the word that went through the tassel, the leaves, the stalk is back to the seed word again. &gt;&gt; The church have gone through the dark ages have gone through the reformation as back to the restoration of the full bright tree. We read from the exposition of church ages the minor church age slice 19. But Abraham said here, "If you were a true seed, you will hear that word, the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Filling you and empowering you and you receive the word for your day and age. See how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Again, note Jesus was a royal seed. He lived in a woman body. When the spirit called to him, the word manifested thought. He went to Jordan and there he was baptized in water. Upon obeying the word and the holy spirit came upon him and the voice said, "This is my beloved son. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him." &gt;&gt; Listen carefully. The voice did not say this has become my son. But Jesus was the son. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit is given to sons. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit does not make us sons. &gt;&gt; You must be a son to benefit the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost position him as sons before them all. Then having been filled thus and the same pattern holes as Pentecost and after and ever after he went in demonstrated power receiving the full revelation of God and from God for that day. Now we have been constantly saying that the true evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost is for the believer to receive the word for the age in which he lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True Holy Ghost baptism is for the believer to receive the word in the age which he lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is your evidence. &gt;&gt; How many love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Let me read some few quotes and close here. I read from the slice 20 that is who is meadc paragraph 79 2 Corinthians 5:1. If this earthly body be dissolved, this earthly tabernacle, we have another one. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Imagine going on a highway on a top speed and your tie bust and there is no car, nobody, no mechanic and you don't have a spare tire. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do? &gt;&gt; But the thought and the mind alone to know you have a spare tire. You know you are rescued. &gt;&gt; You know you have not lose anything. &gt;&gt; You quickly fix it up. You go on your journey. Yes. &gt;&gt; And Paul says that if our only hope is in this world alone, then we are the most miserable. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Without a resurrection, we are the most miserable. &gt;&gt; We will not resurrect in this body. &gt;&gt; We will resurrect in the perfect body. &gt;&gt; That is what we are growing into. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now listen carefully here. We have another one. See, we have bypassed that to come straight from God, the attribute to the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be tempted by sin. &gt;&gt; What happened? We came from the thought of God, &gt;&gt; the attribute of God &gt;&gt; and we bypass the word body, our &gt;&gt; and we came to this flesh &gt;&gt; to beed by sin. &gt;&gt; But Jesus, he came from the mind of God, the attribute of God. Yes, &gt;&gt; he went through the word body &gt;&gt; before becoming the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why he knew all things and he knew what is in all men's heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now for us to go back again to the thought of God, that which we bypass, we got to come through that way. &gt;&gt; We can't go back to God in this flesh &gt;&gt; that we put so much on, we can't go back there &gt;&gt; through that. But when the testing of this word is over, then we are taken up into this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; It is a word there that we skip to come right around down here to be tempted and tested. If we have come through that, there will have been no temptation, would have known all things. That the reason Jesus know all things because he was a word before he was a flesh. Then we become the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here we are formed to the word image. &gt;&gt; And the only way we are formed to the word image is to preach these things. &gt;&gt; And as you receive the word, you become the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Line upon line, precept upon precept, you are piling something. There is a body building in you. One of these days, this rob of flesh, you will drop it and seize everlasting prize. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Yet we are formed to the word image. We partaker of the word, feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning. You see, you see the little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The little spark of life in you, the Holy Ghost. When you started your journey, the gem of life, if there is no seed gem of life in you, you cannot receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Cuz the seed gem is there to receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We read from the next one, slice 21, questions and answers, part four. He said this is a dying spirit in a dying body. But now you can't be in two bodies at the same time. &gt;&gt; But there can be two natures in you at a time. Now the nature of the spirit of the lord when you are born again &gt;&gt; you are not born of the physical like the baby was but what happened the spiritual birth has come to you and why this spiritual birth is growing into your heart of god into your heart of god there is a physical or a celestial body growing to receive that spirit &gt;&gt; oh come on church. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a celestial body growing to receive that spirit. &gt;&gt; And when the life leave this body, it goes to that body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When man was created and the Lord breath in the nurture of man receive ye life and man became a living soul. When our last breath is given up on this world, it goes back to that body waiting for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just as when the body is presented to the earth, the spirit comes in. And when the spirit goes out of the body, there is a body waiting. For we know that if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have already one waiting. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Thank you, Father. Oh, thank you, Jesus. I love the Lord. Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me just share some testimonies so that we close. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been a missionary over 10 years by the special grace of God. Traveled to many countries to proclaim this message of the hour and I have seen the mighty hand of God. In many countries, the Lord have led me. I share some few testimonies with pastor and the wife back home. We might not have time to share all but I will give you one or two little ones to encourage your faith &gt;&gt; to know that you are believing the truth &gt;&gt; and stand by what you know and what you believe. Amen and amen. Some years ago, I was on a journey from East Africa to c uh South Africa and uh on the border crossing between there is a way between Tanzania and uh Malawi. But somehow somewhere I ask everybody nobody can show me that direct border. So I have to go through Malawi like Jesus. He was to pass this way and that was not part of the program. So when I went to the border, the immigration gave me a tough time trying to take bribe and arrest. I said I was just transiting. I'm going to Mosmbique. So you are not going unless you pay. And instead of 50 bucks, they charge me 100 bucks that somehow I have to go through. So at the border now I'm leaving from Malawi to enter Mozambique. I always travel with books and testify with trucks. So I was sharing in the bus with my number and my name behind and I left Mozambi. Three month later when I came back to Ghana begin to receive a message from a pastor in Malawi. Same pastor Matthew Abel you gave me a book in the car. I've been a pastor for many years but I've never seen this type of message before. Can you bring this gospel to Malari? But when I remember the two more I went through at the border I have already vowed not going to go to that country and the more I was delaying God was giving them visions in the church. People that does not know me they'll be describing me to the pastor. I'll be praying wait on God and God is tempting me go. And I said God no no no God have to pass revelation to my mother. I said my son I've seen you somewhere preaching the gospel and God is doing great things and miracles. So finally I have to give I have to go back. When I went to the border surprisingly these immigration officers met me they saw me again said you we know you you are not going to cross unless you pay back the same 100 bucks. I said the last time I pay 100 you gave me 50 bucks ticket or receipt. Now I'm going to pay 50. Then they took the passport refuse entry and I told God you see why I didn't want to go like Jonah. Lord I know you are merciful. I didn't want to go because when the people cry for mercy, you forgive them. Yet God said go. So finally I have to go through. When I arrived the pastor was telling me do you know why I invited you? I said no. Said that day in a bus I kept hearing the voice of God telling me there is a blessing in this bus. There is a blessing in this bus. I look around praying where is that blessing? And nothing was responding. And I'm Recently a preacher, a Pentecostal preacher came preaching. So I begin to communicate with God in prayer. Is that a blessing? No. No. No. No answer. But the preacher got out. So I look at the entrance. There was a little boy sitting down there babbling his mouth. Whether he's praying or singing, we don't know. Then when I was going out, you gave me a book. Said immediately I received that book. Then a voice spoke back to me. That is a blessing. So when he went home said how can this little boy be a blessing? Thank God I need that blessing. So when he told me that I was shocked I said okay it's a book that is a blessing not me. He said no you are my blessing. I said no is a book. Then you know what he said as long as you are carrying that book you are also blessed. Then the Lord brought the scripture back to my mind. Revelation 1:3, blessed are those. Can you put it on the board? Let's read that scripture in closing. Then Revelation, it's not in the notes here. Just direct from the Bible. It's not in the notes here. Revelation 1:3 said, "Blessed are those who reads, &gt;&gt; who hears &gt;&gt; and those who keep these words of prophecy." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is when I understand that scripture. So I asked myself this message we don't play the tapes again the books we don't have time to read &gt;&gt; not knowing they are blessed &gt;&gt; hey my brother &gt;&gt; he open up his church we had revival my we organized ministers meeting among 50 churches 50 50 ministers the first meeting the female preacher resigned the second meeting in the evening the pastors want to get baptized we baptized five churches at that time a year or two God took me to the middle part of Malario called Muzu baptized five pentacosta churches there and this testimony has been going around there even in Kenya in Uganda. God is doing wonderful works there through my ministry &gt;&gt; under this Elijah ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God give me grace among denominational churches that I go I preach this gospel to them &gt;&gt; and they resurrect from their dead denominationalism &gt;&gt; and they say we want to baptize in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Last December, we baptized three churches in in Kenya. And what I love about this is is a city in Kenya called Edorit. When a long-standing message preacher have turn his back and get the message has burned the books in that same city, God has given us three new churches. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We baptize the pastors in Jesus name. And last April when I was there by the grace of God, we baptized the whole church and extra pastors. And now they begin to receive the books. They begin to study the word &gt;&gt; and they are rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And one thing I love about God, he gives them visions and supernatural presence. &gt;&gt; Last year when I was there in December, the Lord spoke to one of the pastors and he told him in a vision. He wrote it down. The Lord told him, "This man is a voice to the nations." So he didn't argue. His wife was a female preacher. She resigned and they were baptized the same day in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I was going back again this year, God gave them a vision. They saw a land, a field with stamps and trees. Said, "Apostle, we saw you coming with a sword. You begin to approot them. Begin to approve those trees and you begin to plant new seeds." &gt;&gt; I said, "Glory be to God." &gt;&gt; Say, "Do you know what is happening?" &gt;&gt; For the first time, I preached for four and a half hour. &gt;&gt; Never in my life. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Not once. Two times the people were writing were hungry. They were hearing from their &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were hearing from their chop. &gt;&gt; It was a hard message. I told them you want to know what is happening. God is uprooting the storms of Christ, &gt;&gt; the storms of denominationalism and we are sewing the seed of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. In Malawi, there was a woman with a cervical cancer. When she was baptized in Jesus Christ's name, she was healed. &gt;&gt; In Kenya, by the preaching of the gospel, there was a sister who have a stomach infirmity for 3 years. I've gone through hospital taken every medicine. But by the preaching of the gospel, she was ill back there. &gt;&gt; And if you can't believe it will be your portion also. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Last year, there was a case, a sister who was hit by a motorbike in Kenya for 12 years. She had that vertebra problem. She couldn't sleep one side. She couldn't walk. She couldn't go to the market. But when she came to the altar, was prayed for in the name of Jesus, God took her pain. &gt;&gt; She went back to the doctor and the everything showed perfectly. &gt;&gt; The same God of Abraham is here today with us. &gt;&gt; The same angel of God is still here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the same God in this message &gt;&gt; everywhere vindicating himself. The same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; And one thing I thank God for and I always pray whenever I go to preach, I ask God for a notable miracle &gt;&gt; to confirm his word. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Friends, there is a blessing in this message. &gt;&gt; There is a healing in this message. &gt;&gt; There is deliverance in this message. &gt;&gt; There is an abundance of the power of God in this message. &gt;&gt; We just don't have the the mechanic. We have the dynamics. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have another body &gt;&gt; waiting for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Whether we live or we die, we live for the Lord and we die to the Lord, we have lose nothing. &gt;&gt; Because we have make our consecration. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As a musician, resume the seat now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Friends, I have testified to you by the grace of God that this message is the truth. &gt;&gt; Don't give up. Keep holding on. &gt;&gt; Keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; Keep pressing on. One of these days we shall be changed. &gt;&gt; In the pinnacle of an eye. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the corruptible will be put on the incorruptible. &gt;&gt; We shall receive a new body. And when he shall appear, we shall be like him. Give me the desire. Why don't you stand to your feet and receive your heart desire &gt;&gt; to be like Jesus? To be like Jesus. From earth to glory. I want to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus. on earth. I long to be like true [Music] to glory. Thy holy eyes to be like him. [Music] &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. on earth to be like him.
