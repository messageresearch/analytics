[5:51] Amazing
[6:00] grace,
[6:02] how sweet
[6:04] the sound
[6:07] that saved
[6:09] a wretch
[6:12] like me.
[6:14] [Music]
[6:16] I once
[6:19] was lost,
[6:21] but now
[6:23] I'm found.
[6:26] Was blind,

[6:34] [Music]
[6:35] It was grace
[6:37] that taught
[6:40] my heart
[6:42] to fear.
[6:45] and grace
[6:46] my fears
[6:49] relief.
[6:54] How precious
[6:57] did
[6:58] that grace
[7:01] appear.
[7:03] The hour
[7:05] I first
[7:08] believe.
[7:11] My chains are gone.
[7:16] I've been set free.
[7:20] My God, my Savior,
[7:25] yours ransom me.
[7:29] And like a flood,
[7:34] his mercy rain,
[7:39] unending love,
[7:43] amazing grace.
[7:49] The Lord
[7:51] has promised
[7:54] good
[7:56] to me.
[7:58] His word,
[8:00] my hope
[8:03] secure.
[8:07] He will
[8:09] my shield
[8:12] and portion
[8:14] be
[8:17] as long
[8:19] as life
[8:21] endure.
[8:24] My chains are gone.
[8:28] [Music]
[8:29] I've been set free.
[8:33] My God, my Savior,
[8:38] yours ransom me.
[8:42] And like a flood
[8:47] his mercy reign,
[8:52] unending love,
[8:56] amazing grace.
[9:01] The the earth
[9:04] shall soon
[9:06] dissolve
[9:08] like snow.
[9:11] The sun
[9:13] forbear
[9:15] to shine.
[9:20] But God
[9:22] who called
[9:24] me here
[9:26] below
[9:29] will be
[9:31] forever
[9:34] my
[9:37] dreams are gone.
[9:41] I've been set free.
[9:45] My God, my save,

[9:54] And like a flood
[9:58] his mercy reign,
[10:03] unending love.
[10:08] Amazing grace.
[10:13] Amen. Amen.
[10:17] verse four here it says his word my hope
[10:20] secures that's
[10:22] in my mind that's the
[10:25] God's word is always fulfilling itself
[10:27] and that's the portion of faith that
[10:30] he's he's given us his word is what
[10:31] secures our hope and our faith and um uh
[10:36] maybe it's a little bit off topic but
[10:37] years ago I had an NLT Bible and uh when
[10:41] it talks about uh the when the came out
[10:44] of Israel and it had the plagues. It the
[10:47] Bible said just had God had predicted.
[10:50] And immediately I stopped using that
[10:52] Bible because God's word is not a
[10:54] prediction. It's not open-ended for
[10:56] failure. It's not like, oh, I think this
[10:59] might happen. I think this might not.
[11:00] No, he like every other Bible in
[11:02] existence said as God had said. And uh
[11:06] maybe if I ruined that for you, I'm
[11:08] sorry, but I yeah, that's the Bible I I
[11:11] I don't want to use because if there's
[11:13] one misinterpretation like that, that
[11:14] makes all of God's word fallable and his
[11:17] word is infallible.
[11:19] Maybe he'll stand with me. Let's sing.
[11:21] I'll cherish the old rugged cross.
[11:33] [Music]
[11:36] On a hill
[11:38] far away
[11:41] stood an old rugged cross,
[11:46] the emblem of suffering and shame.
[11:54] And I love that old cross where the
[11:59] dearest
[12:00] and best for a world of sinner was
[12:06] slain.
[12:10] And we'll cherish
[12:12] the old rugged cross
[12:18] till my trophies
[12:20] at last I lay down.
[12:26] And I'll cling to the old rugged cross
[12:34] and exchange it someday for a crown.
[12:42] Oh, the old
[12:45] cross
[12:48] by the world has a wous
[12:53] attraction.
[12:54] [Music]
[13:13] Yeah, let's try
[13:18] the old rugged cross
[13:22] [Music]
[13:23] till my trophies
[13:26] at last I lay down.
[13:30] [Music]
[13:31] And I'll cling
[13:34] to the old rugged cross
[13:39] and exchange it someday for a crown.
[13:48] [Music]
[13:50] The old
[13:53] rugged cross. There we go. With blood so
[13:57] divine.
[14:00] How wonderous
[14:02] of beauty I see.
[14:07] For was thou cr cross Jesus suffered
[14:14] and died
[14:16] to pardon and sanify
[14:20] me.
[14:24] Oh, I'll cling to the old rugged cross
[14:31] till my trophies
[14:34] at last I lay down.
[14:39] I will cling to the old rugged cross
[14:47] and exchange it someday for a crown.
[14:55] To that old rugged cross I will ever be
[15:01] true.
[15:03] It shame and reproach gladly bear.
[15:10] Then he'll call me someday
[15:14] to my home far away
[15:18] where his glory shall ever all share.
[15:26] So I'll cling to the old rugged cross
[15:33] till my trophies at last I lay down.
[15:41] And I'll cling to the old rugged cross
[15:49] and exchange it someday for a crown.
[15:56] Amen.
[16:03] There's a couple of prayer requests
[16:04] still for uh sister Agnes Kazadi and it
[16:08] says there's a series of prayer requests
[16:10] for uh sister Duo, but I don't know if
[16:13] we know that request, but we'll just
[16:15] hold up before the Lord and also for
[16:16] brother Moses as he's traveling and and
[16:19] just where the world is where there's
[16:22] wars and in East Congo and and just in
[16:25] the Philippines there's flooding and
[16:27] just all over. So, If we can ask brother
[16:30] Joseph if he could come and take these
[16:32] needs before the Lord
[16:37] [Music]
[16:43] cross
[16:44] [Music]
[16:49] the glass I lay down.
[16:55] I will cling to the old ragged cross
[17:03] and exchange it someday for a crown.
[17:11] Amen. God bless you saints. Let's go to

[19:57] [Music]
[20:55] The judge
[20:57] my way.
[20:59] It looks like you're guilty.
[21:03] Now what do you say?
[21:09] I spoke out your honor. I have no
[21:15] defense.
[21:17] But that's when
[21:19] mercy walked in.
[21:24] Oh,
[21:26] mercy
[21:27] walked in
[21:29] and pleaded at my case.
[21:34] Called to the stand.
[21:38] God's saving grace.
[21:42] The blood was presented
[21:47] that covered my sins.
[21:51] Forgiven
[21:53] when mercy walked in.
[21:59] I stood there in wonder.
[22:04] How could this be
[22:08] that someone so guilty
[22:12] has just been set free?
[22:19] My chains were broken.
[22:23] I felt born again
[22:27] the moment
[22:29] that mercy walked in.
[22:34] Oh
[22:36] mercy
[22:37] walked in
[22:39] and pleaded
[22:41] my case.
[22:44] Called to the stand.
[22:48] God's saving grace.
[22:52] The blood was presented
[22:56] that covered my sins.
[23:00] forgiven.
[23:02] When mercy walked in,
[23:07] I stood there in wonder.
[23:13] How could this be
[23:17] that someone so guilty
[23:21] had just been set free?
[23:28] My chains were broken.
[23:32] I felt born again.
[23:36] The moment
[23:38] that mercy walked in,
[23:42] oh
[23:44] mercy
[23:46] walked in
[23:48] and pleaded
[23:50] my case.
[23:52] called to the step.
[23:56] God's saving grace.
[24:00] The blood was presented
[24:04] that covered my sins
[24:08] forgiven
[24:10] when mercy walked in.
[24:15] Oh
[24:17] mercy
[24:18] walked in
[24:20] and pleaded in my case
[24:25] called to the dead.
[24:29] God's saving grace.
[24:33] The blood was presented
[24:36] that covered my sins.
[24:41] [Music]
[24:43] forgiven
[24:45] when mercy walking.
[24:52] [Applause]
[24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:04] Mercy. Uh recently I was just thinking
[25:06] about uh I guess like atonement in the
[25:09] Bible and how we like before Christ came
[25:11] there was a a constant search for
[25:14] atonement. So you had to constantly be
[25:17] uh finding a lamp constantly having to
[25:18] do all those things and and not because
[25:20] you wanted to but because you had to
[25:23] because your your desires were never
[25:25] changed. So the only resolution was a
[25:28] constant atonement and and Christ gave
[25:31] an atonement but not to
[25:34] Not just for the atonement is to change
[25:37] why we needed an atonement
[25:39] and yeah just yeah mercy re r rewrote
[25:43] our life. So
[25:48] change the the tempo a little bit. Um
[25:52] are you washed by the water?
[25:58] Maybe his brothers would come.
[26:03] Do you know what it is not to have one
[26:07] guilty feeling nor to wonder where
[26:11] you're going when you die.
[26:15] Not condemned of the past. Not afraid of
[26:20] what tomorrow holds in store and know
[26:25] the reason why.
[26:28] Yes, that's just how it is. You go down
[26:33] in the water for my faith. You believe
[26:37] in what you heard.
[26:40] It's no impossible
[26:43] dream. You can start over clean.
[26:48] When you're washed by the water of the
[26:52] word,
[26:55] are you washed? Yes, I'm washed by the
[26:59] water.
[27:02] Washed by the water of the word.
[27:07] Are you washed
[27:10] by the water? Hallelujah.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Washed by the water of the word.
[27:19] It's like being born again with a whole
[27:24] new life to live. Never having to look
[27:28] back to what you did. Cuz
[27:32] according to the Lord, you've just
[27:36] started your existence. And where he's
[27:39] concerned, there was no sin. Praise the
[27:43] Lord for that.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; For when God looks your way, he no
[27:48] longer sees a saint
[27:51] who's been washed white as snow.
[27:56] It's not by anything we've done, but by
[27:59] the blood of God's own son.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Are you washed by the water of the word?
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Are you Are you by the water?
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Washed by the water of the word.
[28:22] Are you washed
[28:25] by the water?
[28:27] [Music]
[28:29] Washed by the water of the word. Yes,
[28:32] I'm washed.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm washed
[28:37] by the water.
[28:41] Washed by the water of the word.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm washed.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm washed by the water.
[28:52] are washed by the water of the word.
[28:58] Hallelujah.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Aren't you happy this morning that
[29:02] you're washed by the water of the word?
[29:06] &gt;&gt; Mercy came along.
[29:08] You know, is that wonderful? That was a
[29:10] wonderful song. Mercy is our Lord Jesus
[29:14] Christ. He came in the person of our
[29:17] Lord Jesus Christ. And this morning we
[29:20] want to adore him.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; We want to praise him. Can you say amen?
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say hallelujah to the Lord Jesus
[29:28] with all of your heart?
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say praise our God?
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Praise our God.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. I'm
[29:36] so happy to be in service today.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Moses isn't here, but
[29:41] Jesus is here.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Gilbert is here, but we
[29:46] pray for our Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen.
[29:49] We're not here for men. Or are we? Are
[29:52] we here for a certain pastor or person
[29:54] preacher? I hope not. I hope that we're
[29:58] here for our Lord Jesus Christ. Some
[30:01] people come if they have their favorite
[30:03] preacher coming. That's not the way to
[30:06] be. Our favorite man is the Lord Jesus
[30:10] Christ, our heavenly bridegroom.
[30:13] Remember that. Amen. We're serving a
[30:16] risen Christ, a living God,
[30:20] and we want to welcome him. Let's
[30:21] welcome our Lord Jesus this morning.
[30:23] What shall we? Amen. Shall we give him a
[30:26] good applause?
[30:28] You know, the world, they give an
[30:30] applause to, you know, hockey stars and
[30:33] football stars, but you know, we can
[30:35] give a real welcome to our Lord Jesus
[30:38] here this morning. I know we're just a
[30:40] few. We're not 20,000 people, but we can
[30:43] say, "Thank you, Lord, that you have
[30:45] arrived. I believe here is here." You
[30:48] know why? I know. I brought him with me.
[30:51] Amen. Did you bring him with you?
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So nice to see everyone the
[30:56] visitors. I don't I forgot your name
[30:57] already, brother. You told me what your
[30:59] name. What was your name?
[31:01] &gt;&gt; What?
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Dela. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Any
[31:07] more visitors? Well, we're glad to have
[31:09] Sister Reema here. She sang for us.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. She used to be our regular singer
[31:14] and then she deserted us.
[31:18] Amen. Praise the Lord. But you know, we
[31:20] still have Sister Kathy. And now we have
[31:23] Sister Wendy. I haven't heard Sister
[31:24] Wendy for a long time. Wouldn't you like
[31:26] to hear her?
[31:28] &gt;&gt; I sorry, Sister Wendy, but you know, I I

[31:58] volunteered. Amen. And God sent him to
[32:01] us. Praise God for brother Peter.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[32:05] You know, I tell you what, the same
[32:06] thing happened with brother Moses. I
[32:09] believe he's God sent.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm 81. It's time to retire.
[32:16] God sent us a man of God.

[32:22] it, you know, in his presence also.

[32:28] &gt;&gt; That's what I love about him. He's
[32:30] humble and he preaches like a like a
[32:32] dynamo. I don't know. I I feel that way.

[32:51] Well, he's, you know, he's he's an
[32:54] apostle. Did you know that? How many
[32:56] know that he's an apostle? He he's doing
[32:58] an apostle job in Lethbridge.
[33:02] Amen. You're late, brother Victor.
[33:06] God bless you, brother Victor. Amen.
[33:09] We're so happy to have the men family
[33:10] with us.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we're so happy to have brother
[33:14] Amen. Brother Gilbert Vameta
[33:19] with us this morning.
[33:21] Hallelujah. You know, he's been a
[33:22] blessing to me. He's been a friend to
[33:24] me, a great friend and a brother. And
[33:28] I'm expecting a whole lot this morning,
[33:30] brother, because I believe that the
[33:32] people of God are hungry.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think brother Kim Dingall used
[33:37] to sing, "I'm hungry, Lord, feed me." I
[33:39] can't sing it myself, but you know, we
[33:42] need to be fed, right?
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to nourish our faith.
[33:46] Brother has been speaking on faith.
[33:48] We've got to nourish our faith. We can't
[33:51] add to our faith. You can't add a
[33:53] stature to you to yourself. You can't
[33:55] add If I could, I'd put some hair on my
[33:58] head, but I cannot add anything. But we
[34:02] can nurture our faith. Feed on the word
[34:05] of God. And that's what we want to do
[34:07] here this morning.
[34:09] Feed on the word. Be silent. Be at rest.
[34:13] Amen. Because the Lord Jesus said, "Come
[34:15] unto me all ye that are that are labor
[34:18] labor and are heavy. Come and I will
[34:21] give you rest."
[34:22] &gt;&gt; That's peace. the Holy Ghost living
[34:25] inside of us. Praise God. We want the
[34:28] dynamics. We've got to eat the word.
[34:32] Amen. Brother Gilbert, would you come?
[34:34] Can we sing that chorus? Oh, come let us
[34:37] adore him.
[34:40] It's not Christmas time, but it's we we
[34:43] will always adore him.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, come let us adore him. Oh come let
[34:53] us adore
[34:55] him. Oh come let us adore him. Christ
[35:04] the Lord.
[35:07] We'll give him all the glory.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; We'll give him all the glory.
[35:17] We'll give him all the glory. Glory
[35:22] Christ
[35:24] the Lord
[35:27] for he alone is worthy
[35:32] for he alone is worthy
[35:37] for he alone is worthy
[35:42] Christ
[35:44] the Lord.
[35:47] Amen. Before our brother Gilbert comes,
[35:50] we do want to all remember. I know I had
[35:53] it read over the pulpit, but you know,
[35:55] we got to remember our sister Odiva.
[35:59] She is in serious need. She's got
[36:02] something on her head. And the doctors
[36:05] are just examining her. We got to say,
[36:08] Lord Jesus, you're still the healer.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; We've got to carry our brother and
[36:13] sister's burdens.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; So, let's just focus on our
[36:18] I mean I I believe brother is also
[36:21] affected by this because whenever my
[36:23] wife is sick I'm dearly my I'm so broken
[36:27] down I hardly taken. Amen. So I know how
[36:31] it is. Let's just remember them in
[36:33] prayer. Father in heaven, I know they're
[36:35] not here this morning for some reason or
[36:38] other, but she phoned and I prayed over
[36:40] to over her by phone.
[36:44] But Lord, we are gathered
[36:48] gathered together here this morning as a
[36:51] group of people, Lord Jesus. And I
[36:54] believe that you hear our prayer. Not
[36:56] only hear our prayer, but Lord, you
[36:58] answer our prayer. And we bring our
[37:01] sister Odiva before you in the name of
[37:03] Jesus. May every thing that she has Lord
[37:07] I believe it's not malignant but Lord
[37:09] Jesus it's something on her in her head
[37:11] on her head
[37:13] Lord affecting her petitionary gland. I
[37:15] can't even say it properly but Lord
[37:17] Jesus would you undertake for her this
[37:20] morning oh God in the name of Jesus
[37:23] everyone that's sick here this morning.
[37:27] Oh God, would you go near them, Lord,
[37:29] and oh, touch their their bodies in the
[37:32] name of Jesus. Everyone that has pain,
[37:35] Lord. Oh God, there's different ones
[37:37] that have pain, Lord. Every day, Lord, I
[37:40] pray in the name of Jesus, that you
[37:43] would undertake for them. We believe
[37:44] that you're a Jehovah Rafa. So this
[37:47] morning, we want to focus on your word.
[37:50] I pray, oh God, that you would anoint
[37:52] our brother, Lord, to speak as the
[37:54] oracles of God. May he have liberty
[37:59] to declare to us the word of God that
[38:02] which we we need to hear this morning.
[38:05] Oh God, we don't need a whole lot of
[38:07] knowledge. We've already got it. But
[38:09] Lord, we need a revelation of what we
[38:12] need this morning. Oh God, we need to
[38:15] get right with God. We got to get on
[38:18] fervent with God. Oh God, we lay it all
[38:21] to you this morning. Bless our brother
[38:23] and give him the anointing and the
[38:25] spirit of the living God. May Jesus
[38:28] Christ speak through him this morning is
[38:30] my prayer in Jesus name. Amen. Can you
[38:33] please say amen?
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give our brother Gilbert a
[38:37] welcome.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that okay? Amen.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[38:50] Thank you pastor.
[38:53] I greet you this morning in the name of
[38:55] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be in the house of the
[38:59] Lord?
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Are you expecting?
[39:06] &gt;&gt; But don't expect too much because you
[39:08] might be disappointed.
[39:10] But pray for me.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; I also bring you greetings from the
[39:15] saints in Lethbridge.
[39:18] And uh my wife, I didn't come with her.
[39:21] She's in she's in Africa for vacation.
[39:25] But I caught an old friend who said that
[39:28] uh he can give me company. So I came
[39:31] with my precious friend Dea Panini.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; So
[39:37] I'm happy to be my in my second church.
[39:42] I just love you brethren. Amen.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Uh whenever I go on my knees to pray, I
[39:48] pray for this f for this fellowship. You
[39:52] are so dear to me.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; God
[39:54] &gt;&gt; because this is the place where I just
[39:57] preach my heart out.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; I don't leave anything. I just say it
[40:02] the way it comes.
[40:04] And uh I pray that uh
[40:12] I pray that this morning I'll be a
[40:14] blessing to somebody.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; So without wasting much time, I
[40:20] ask that we turn to our Bibles. Thank
[40:23] you musicians.
[40:26] We will turn to St. Luke chapter 15.
[40:36] St. Luke chapter 15.
[40:55] If you can say amen.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's pray before we read. Our
[41:02] dear most precious heavenly father,
[41:06] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[41:09] Christ,
[41:11] we call unto you once again, Father,
[41:13] because you told us to call and you will
[41:16] answer.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; You are not a man that you can lie.
[41:21] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus Christ, we
[41:24] know your ears are always open unto the
[41:26] cries of your children. May you hear our
[41:29] humble cry this morning. We have come,
[41:32] Father. Your children have prayed. They
[41:34] have come expecting to hear from you.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, just take me out of the
[41:40] way so that you come and speak to your
[41:42] children yourself. Let me not be a
[41:45] hindrance, Father, for them to hear what
[41:47] thou has purposed for them to hear this
[41:50] morning. Lord Jesus, now as we go to
[41:53] read your word, we ask for your
[41:56] blessings upon it, Father, in the name
[41:58] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:29] I shall say that God has given me a good
[42:31] voice.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; I can I can preach without these things
[42:38] but anyway they have to be used. So if
[42:41] you are there let's let's start reading
[42:43] from verse
[42:45] 11.
[42:47] St. Luke 15 from verse 11.
[42:50] And he said a certain man had two sons.
[42:53] And the young of them said to his
[42:55] father, "Father, give me the portion of
[42:58] goods that fleth to me." And he divided
[43:02] unto them his living. And not many days
[43:05] after the young son gathered all
[43:07] together and took his journey into a far
[43:09] country and there wasted his substance
[43:13] with riotous living. And when he had
[43:16] spent all there arose a mighty famine in
[43:19] that in that land and he began to be in
[43:22] one. And he went and joined himself to a
[43:25] citizen of that country. And he sent him
[43:29] into his fields to feed swine. and he
[43:34] would fain have filled his belly with
[43:37] the husks that the swine did eat, and no
[43:40] man gave unto him. And when he came to
[43:44] himself, he said, "How many hired
[43:48] servants of my fathers have prayed
[43:51] enough and to spare, and I perish with a
[43:55] hunger?" Because of time, let's let's go
[43:58] to verse 21.
[44:01] And the son said unto him, "Father, I
[44:04] have sinned against heaven and in thy
[44:07] sight, and am no more worthy to be
[44:10] called thy son." But the father said to
[44:14] his servants, "Bring forth the best
[44:17] robe,
[44:18] &gt;&gt; put it on him. Put a ring on his hand
[44:22] and shoes on his feet, and bring hither
[44:26] the fatted calf and kill it, and let us
[44:30] eat and be merry." God bless the reading
[44:33] of the word. You can have your seats.
[44:41] Amen.
[44:44] For some time we've been
[44:48] talking about
[44:50] adoption
[44:53] and uh
[44:56] for those who have been following preach
[44:58] services
[45:01] please don't say why is he repeating
[45:04] himself.
[45:05] No, it's for the sake of somebody who
[45:07] has not heard what is going on. So I
[45:10] pray that uh this morning I trust that
[45:14] I'll be a blessing to somebody. Now for
[45:17] the sake of those who don't know what we
[45:20] have been going through, I'll just try
[45:22] to background it before we come to our
[45:24] subject today.
[45:26] The subject today I've called it the
[45:30] symbols of adoption.
[45:38] Yeah, we will come to it. Now, adoption,
[45:42] we have been saying the English word for
[45:46] the the English meaning for adoption
[45:49] is taking somebody that is not yours
[45:55] and you make him or her yours.
[46:00] Are we together?
[46:01] &gt;&gt; So far so good.
[46:03] But according to the word,
[46:07] adoption means bringing back that one
[46:10] which was yours.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; It must have been yours in the first
[46:15] place.
[46:17] So you bring the person back to yourself
[46:23] to the family.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[46:27] Now
[46:29] the story that we have read about the
[46:32] prodical son
[46:35] many at times this story is used to
[46:40] maybe somebody backlid and went away
[46:43] from the church. So we go to the person
[46:47] telling him or her the story of the
[46:49] prodical son
[46:51] thinking that bringing the person back
[46:54] to the church is bringing the person
[46:56] home. No.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; I hope you get me right.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Somebody can come back to church but is
[47:09] not in the home.
[47:12] So we want to differentiate between the
[47:14] home and the church.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now
[47:20] this this young man
[47:24] he went to his father and said give me
[47:28] the portion of my inheritance.
[47:33] And he was given
[47:36] and he went away.
[47:40] While he was away,
[47:45] life became so difficult for him
[47:50] until he remembered
[47:53] that how many hired servants at home
[47:58] are eating bread
[48:02] and it remains
[48:04] and here I'm hungry.
[48:07] You can imagine how he was struggling
[48:09] with with with the swines. Yeah. You can
[48:13] imagine how they struggled to eat and
[48:16] there you are also. It must have been a
[48:19] very big struggle.
[48:21] But he remembered
[48:25] back home.
[48:29] Now the question is who is the protoan
[48:32] today?
[48:35] The prophet says I don't have time much
[48:36] time to read all the quotes but uh we
[48:38] will see who is the protocol son today.
[48:41] The prophet says we are the prodical
[48:43] sons.
[48:46] Now if we are the prodical sons then
[48:50] where is our home?
[48:54] Our home is where we came from
[48:59] &gt;&gt; and we left our home and came into a far
[49:03] country.
[49:06] Now in that far country we are eating
[49:08] with pigs.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; We are living riotous lives.
[49:17] God help us.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Now
[49:23] please mark this scripture. We will
[49:25] repeat it over and over until it sings
[49:28] in our hearts. Verse
[49:32] 21,
[49:34] the Bible says, "And the son said unto
[49:38] him, Father, I have sinned against
[49:41] heaven and in thy sight, and am no more
[49:45] worthy to be called thy son."
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my God have us.
[49:55] Now,
[49:56] here is the son. Verse 17 says, "When he
[50:01] came to himself,
[50:04] then he remembered home."
[50:07] Many things we do is because we are not
[50:11] ourselves.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. Many things we do is
[50:19] because we are not ourselves.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; But when you come to yourself,
[50:24] &gt;&gt; you will not do the things that you are
[50:27] doing. when you come to yourself.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Now when he came to himself then he
[50:34] remembered home.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Now
[50:41] look at this scenario
[50:43] here. He stands before his father and
[50:46] says I have sinned against heaven. I
[50:49] have sinned against you. I'm not worthy
[50:52] to be called your son. Just make me one
[50:55] of your hired servants.
[51:00] and the relationship of the father and
[51:04] the son because this son came from the
[51:07] loins of the father because of that
[51:10] relationship he did not respond to that
[51:13] request.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; The father could not understand how he
[51:23] can make his son a hired servant.
[51:30] God help us.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; The father could not understand
[51:38] and he could not grant that request.
[51:43] May God help us. Instead,
[51:46] he started speaking to his servants.
[51:52] Now verse 22. But the father said to to
[51:56] his servants, "Bring forth the best
[51:59] rope.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Put it on him
[52:05] &gt;&gt; and put a ring on his hand
[52:08] &gt;&gt; and shoes on his feet.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Bring the best rope."
[52:16] The best rope used to be spared for
[52:19] adoption.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Not just a rope, but the best rope
[52:26] spared, reserved for adoption purpose.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; But now
[52:34] here is our case.
[52:36] A son comes in tattered clothes
[52:43] and yet
[52:45] the father starts the process of
[52:48] adoption. That is amazing grace.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; That is amazing grace.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; That is amazing grace.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even in the the way I am
[53:01] with clothes torn everywhere I my
[53:05] nakedness is seen everywhere
[53:07] &gt;&gt; and yet the father starts the process of
[53:10] adoption.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; That is amazing grace.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Some said if you preach this kind of
[53:20] sermon people will start leaving
[53:23] anyhow. No
[53:25] &gt;&gt; sir.
[53:27] If you can realize where you came from.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:33] Just give me time when we when we come
[53:35] to see the life of the prodical son and
[53:38] what it means to us then you will
[53:41] realize
[53:43] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the symbols of adoption
[53:52] one the best rope
[53:57] two a ring,
[54:01] &gt;&gt; three shoes.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; If you can have those three, then we can
[54:09] declare this morning that you are ready
[54:11] for adoption.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[54:23] No.
[54:41] Okay.
[54:43] In the message adoption part three
[54:45] paragraph 160
[54:54] the prophet says now let us read then we
[54:57] will have to stop cause our time getting
[55:00] away. All right in the 10th verse.
[55:08] Okay.
[55:13] All right. In the 10th verse or ninth
[55:15] verse, having made known to us the
[55:19] mystery of his will.
[55:22] What is the mystery of his will? The
[55:25] mystery of his will is adoption.
[55:30] Let me explain it.
[55:33] We had the elder son who remained in the
[55:36] home. As far as good living was
[55:40] concerned, actually he's the one who
[55:42] deserved to be adopted.
[55:45] Yeah. He met all the qualifications for
[55:48] adoption.
[55:52] As far as the living good is concerned,
[55:55] he met all the qualifications for
[55:57] adoption.
[55:59] But here one comes first of all he went
[56:04] away
[56:06] and the reason for going he went to live
[56:09] a riot's life
[56:12] and they had evidences of how he was
[56:15] living.
[56:17] Now here he comes and the father who is
[56:21] rich in mercy and full of love for his
[56:24] son
[56:26] &gt;&gt; he starts the process of adoption. Amen.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; For undeserving person
[56:32] that is amazing grace.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; So the mystery of his will is adoption.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery.
[56:48] Oh my.
[56:51] Okay. Now
[56:56] where is our home?
[57:01] And who is the proto
[57:07] is where we came from.
[57:13] Now how did we come?
[57:17] I've always read this one over and over
[57:20] but for the sake that for the sake of
[57:22] those that we are meeting for the first
[57:23] time I don't mind. I'll just try to
[57:26] explain it.
[57:28] We were in the minds of God
[57:32] as a thought as thoughts.
[57:37] Now being in the mind of God, the
[57:41] prophet says God had three main purposes
[57:45] that he wanted to to achieve. One, he
[57:48] wanted to reveal himself. Two, he wanted
[57:52] to have preeminence in the body of
[57:54] believers. Then three, he restores back
[57:57] to Eden.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. That Eden
[58:07] just being re returned back to Eden.
[58:11] Yeah.
[58:13] Is not where now Adam and Eve were
[58:16] enjoying the trees and the the animals
[58:19] and everything. No being where you are
[58:24] in the mind of God.
[58:29] Hello.
[58:32] Where you are in the mind of God.
[58:37] Let me explain it. When Adam was naming
[58:40] the animals and everything. Yeah.
[58:43] When God came, he never corrected him.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Why? He had the mind of God.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; So that is where God wants us to reach.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; That is our home.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Where you have the mind of God.
[59:10] And Paul tells us that we are now seated
[59:13] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Not
[59:17] around Jesus Christ, but inside Jesus
[59:21] Christ.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; I always say this, the problem is not in
[59:30] the message. The problem is around the
[59:33] message.
[59:35] Those
[59:37] people who have come around the message,
[59:39] they are the ones causing the problems.
[59:41] But inside the inside the message and
[59:44] you have found your place
[59:48] positionally, you know where you are
[59:49] standing.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Life is so sweet.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my God help us now.
[1:00:12] My refus to open but uh anyway we'll get
[1:00:16] there. Okay. Uh 650221E.
[1:00:22] Who is this Mercede?
[1:00:26] 650221E
[1:00:38] paragraph 52.
[1:00:42] Okay. Now we find him at the beginning
[1:00:45] his attributes.
[1:00:48] Now you were with him then. Then is when
[1:00:52] the book of life comes into view.
[1:00:54] Now we read over here in Revelation the
[1:00:57] 13th chapter the 8th verse that the
[1:01:00] peace that comes upon the earth in these
[1:01:04] last days will deceive all
[1:01:07] those people on the earth whose names
[1:01:10] were not written in the lamb's book of
[1:01:12] life before the foundation of the world.
[1:01:16] Think of it. Before Jesus was ever born,
[1:01:19] 4,000 years before he came on earth, and
[1:01:22] several thousand years before you come
[1:01:25] on earth, Jesus in God's mind died for
[1:01:29] the sins of the world. And the book of
[1:01:32] life was made and your name was put on
[1:01:36] that book of life before the foundation
[1:01:39] of the world. That is the Bible truth.
[1:01:42] See your name was ordained of God and
[1:01:46] placed on the book of life before the
[1:01:49] foundation of the world. You were there
[1:01:52] in his attributes.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; So when we talk about your home is the
[1:01:58] park there in his attributes.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Now if you can trace your lineage and
[1:02:04] say oh I was there I am here because I
[1:02:09] was there. Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Once you come to realize that you are
[1:02:13] here because you are there, once you
[1:02:16] catch that revelation.
[1:02:21] Oh yes.
[1:02:23] Then you can know why when the son came
[1:02:26] and asked the father to be met a
[1:02:28] servant, the father could not answer
[1:02:30] that
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; because the father could trace and say
[1:02:38] this is my son.
[1:02:41] This is my son. How can he be a servant?
[1:02:47] servants never used to wear shoes and
[1:02:50] that's why he didn't have shoes
[1:02:53] and the father asked the servants give
[1:02:56] him shoes. We will see what shoes means.
[1:03:02] Yeah.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my god.
[1:03:07] Just as you are a part of your earthly
[1:03:10] father. That is right. You are. The male
[1:03:14] carries the homogloin the blood. And
[1:03:16] when that has gone in in the egg then
[1:03:19] you become a part of your father and
[1:03:21] your mother is a part of your father
[1:03:24] also. So you are all part of your
[1:03:27] father. Glory that lets the denomination
[1:03:30] out all together certainly does God in
[1:03:34] all the only place. Notice now his
[1:03:38] attribute. Now you are his attribute.
[1:03:44] You are here because you are in him.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; You are here because of your name was
[1:03:51] written in the lamb's book of life
[1:03:54] before the foundation of the world.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; We will see it.
[1:04:00] Your name in the book of life is your
[1:04:04] inheritance.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Me go ahead of my sermon. Prophet says,
[1:04:13] "Oh, brother Ne, somebody has to give
[1:04:16] you something.
[1:04:21] Somebody has to give you an
[1:04:22] inheritance."
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Now, what is an inheritance? Your name
[1:04:31] in the Lamb's Book of Life is your
[1:04:33] inheritance.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; You can mess up with your blessings.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Hello That's right.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Please preach with me.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; You can mess up with your blessings,
[1:04:51] but your inheritance, nobody can temper
[1:04:54] with it.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:57] Hallelujah.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; That's why when this son he asked the
[1:05:03] father, give me what belongs to me. and
[1:05:06] he was given and he went and he
[1:05:10] squandered everything.
[1:05:12] He came back empty-handed
[1:05:16] but still his inheritance was there.
[1:05:22] Why was the father why did the father
[1:05:25] start started the process of adoption?
[1:05:28] So that the son can now have his
[1:05:30] inheritance.
[1:05:39] You are inheritance.
[1:05:44] God help us.
[1:05:46] God help us.
[1:05:49] Your inheritance.
[1:05:51] Nobody can temper with your inheritance.
[1:05:54] If we can come to that point where we
[1:05:56] can realize who we are,
[1:05:59] what God has made us. Yeah.
[1:06:03] What has been revealed to us that we
[1:06:05] were in him?
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Your life has been in his hands.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; He has been murdering your life.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; You are living a riotous life
[1:06:19] but your life was in his hands.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; If we can come to ourselves,
[1:06:25] if God can help us to come to ourselves
[1:06:28] and know who we are.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No wonder the prophet says
[1:06:32] when the church will know who she is,
[1:06:34] the rapture will take place.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; So the reason the reason why the rapture
[1:06:39] is not taking place is because of the
[1:06:42] spiritual ammunia.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. You can temper with your
[1:06:53] inheritance. You can temper with your
[1:06:55] blessings but not your inheritance. Your
[1:06:58] inheritance is packed.
[1:07:01] Yeah.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Is a charm of life.
[1:07:06] Now that charm of life in you,
[1:07:11] Lord help us. That jam of life in you
[1:07:15] can be sitting there doand.
[1:07:19] Yeah.
[1:07:21] Oh, I am a sinner.
[1:07:24] I've messed up my life.
[1:07:28] No,
[1:07:32] no.
[1:07:34] That is a strange language.
[1:07:37] Yeah. But what excites that jump of
[1:07:40] life?
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; When you hear the word,
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; it excites you. You can't sit. You said
[1:07:47] hallelujah. Amen.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Why? The charm of life is responding to
[1:07:53] the call by the father.
[1:07:57] Oh yes.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; The prophet says
[1:08:02] that young boy,
[1:08:04] wherever he was,
[1:08:07] it was an angel that went and spoke to
[1:08:10] him.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; What if you just go back home?
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:21] What if you just go back home?
[1:08:26] [Music]
[1:08:29] Yeah.
[1:08:37] Oh, that angel might be speaking to
[1:08:39] somebody this morning.
[1:08:41] Yeah.
[1:08:46] Yeah.
[1:08:49] Then he came to himself
[1:08:51] and he started the journey going on.
[1:08:54] While he was still a far off,
[1:08:58] the father saw him.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; While you are still a far off, the
[1:09:05] father sees you.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And he comes. What happened? He
[1:09:11] gave him a kiss.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; A hug and a kiss.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; The prophet says a kiss was
[1:09:20] justification.
[1:09:24] Oh my. In the condition that he was in
[1:09:28] and he's justified.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; According to the father, according to
[1:09:36] the father, the one who went away, the
[1:09:40] one who was living a riot's life, the
[1:09:43] one who was living, who was eating with
[1:09:45] pigs was not himself.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:51] was not himself.
[1:09:53] But when he came to himself,
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; he started going back home.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Oh
[1:10:02] my.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:09] oh my God help us. Now
[1:10:13] we belong to a family
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; and that family
[1:10:21] has a name.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; The name is Jesus.
[1:10:28] We belong to a family.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; A family of God.
[1:10:36] those old days.
[1:10:39] Uh nowadays, technology has spoiled
[1:10:41] everything. We used to have the album.
[1:10:45] Yeah. You keep the photos.
[1:10:48] This one I took it 1952.
[1:10:51] [Laughter]
[1:10:54] Yeah.
[1:10:56] And that album
[1:10:58] in most cases it has the pictures for
[1:11:01] the family members.
[1:11:04] [Laughter]
[1:11:07] When a visitor comes in the house, the
[1:11:09] first thing you you give the
[1:11:14] you want to introduce the family
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; members.
[1:11:18] Oh, God wants to introduce his family
[1:11:20] members.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my. This one is mine.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; This one is mine. I knew him.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; I knew him.
[1:11:37] Now
[1:11:40] there was the thief on the cross. There
[1:11:43] were two.
[1:11:47] Now
[1:11:49] one
[1:11:50] I I think I preached this one here.
[1:11:52] Yeah. Where we showed the picture. The
[1:11:55] site
[1:11:56] that Jesus Christ was looking on the
[1:12:00] right was where that thief who
[1:12:03] remember me.
[1:12:05] Yeah. And we also showed the me the the
[1:12:09] picture of the pro the prophet is also
[1:12:11] looking right
[1:12:14] the right side.
[1:12:17] Do you do you see the connection?
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The right side. That is amazing
[1:12:23] grace.
[1:12:24] Yeah.
[1:12:26] Now the thief on the right side,
[1:12:30] he had his representation
[1:12:33] in the book of life.
[1:12:36] By condemning him on the cross, it
[1:12:40] brought him to Jesus.
[1:12:45] Now his inheritance was still there.
[1:12:49] It only needed an opportunity.
[1:12:52] Now when he looked at Jesus Christ
[1:12:55] talking to the other thief and the other
[1:12:57] thief was talking nonsense, this one
[1:12:59] said, "Oh Lord, remember me."
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; When he said remember me, Jesus Christ
[1:13:07] said, "Tonight
[1:13:08] not tomorrow, tonight
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; you will be with me."
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Why? Because of his inheritance,
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; his representation.
[1:13:19] Now we are talking about your
[1:13:21] representation the charm of life.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; It is only the charm of life that is
[1:13:29] related to God.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:13:40] let's talk about when he came to himself
[1:13:46] in the court of law.
[1:13:50] When somebody's condemned,
[1:13:53] maybe he murdered or he did any crime
[1:13:57] that you can talk of,
[1:14:00] when this person is brought before the
[1:14:02] church, a good learned friend will say,
[1:14:07] "Before anything else,
[1:14:10] let this guy be tested and see if he was
[1:14:14] in the right sense.
[1:14:18] Yeah.
[1:14:20] Now if he's tested and found that he was
[1:14:23] not in the right mind, the judge would
[1:14:26] say then I'm helpless
[1:14:28] because he was not himself.
[1:14:35] Hello.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; He was helpless. The church would say
[1:14:41] I'm helpless because he was not in the
[1:14:44] right mind. He was not himself.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Then they brought concern brought before
[1:14:52] the father. The father says he was not
[1:14:55] himself.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; He was not himself. So whatever he was
[1:15:04] doing, he was not himself.
[1:15:08] May God have mercy on us.
[1:15:12] But when it comes to us,
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; I know Joseph. I know what he did.
[1:15:23] I know him.
[1:15:26] Even the whole church knows him.
[1:15:30] Not the father.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; The father looks at a different picture.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; He looks at himself. You are in me.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; So whatever you are doing, you are not
[1:15:45] yourself.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; But when you come to yourself, you will
[1:15:50] not do those things.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; So we are asking you, may God open your
[1:15:55] eyes so that you can come to yourself.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Because when you come to yourself, you
[1:16:00] will stop doing whatever you are doing.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; You will run to the father.
[1:16:09] This young this young man he knew his
[1:16:13] father.
[1:16:17] Can you search for me a guide?
[1:16:22] A guide. Paragraph 35.
[1:16:28] Let's see something there. I love it.
[1:16:32] Paragraph 35.
[1:16:43] Okay.
[1:16:45] And the Holy Spirit always speaks of the
[1:16:47] word. I've got many things to tell you.
[1:16:50] You cannot understand it now. But when
[1:16:53] he comes, he will guide you to it. That
[1:16:56] is the reason the coming of the seals.
[1:16:59] At the finishing of the seventh seal,
[1:17:02] the mystery of God should be finished.
[1:17:05] to know who God is, what he is, how he
[1:17:09] lives, his nature, his being. You are
[1:17:13] supposed to be all the way up here by
[1:17:16] that time. Now, the coming of the seals
[1:17:20] is to make you know who your father is.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:17:29] Now this young man he knew his father
[1:17:34] as a forgiving father
[1:17:37] and that's why he said let me go back
[1:17:40] home to my father.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Do we know our father?
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; My God help us.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Do we know him as a condemning father or
[1:17:50] as a forgiving father? If
[1:17:55] if he forame the thief on the cross,
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; no matter how far you have gone,
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; no matter where you are,
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; you might be so low until you cannot
[1:18:08] even pray.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Remember,
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; remember
[1:18:18] what help us? Am I communicating?
[1:18:22] No matter where you are.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Just come to yourself.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:18:34] No matter the condition.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Our father is a forgiving father.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; He's so forgiving.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Look at the characters in the Bible.
[1:18:50] Oh yes.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Are they good characters?
[1:18:56] [Laughter]
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:03] May God help us.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; To know our father.
[1:19:11] And the purpose of the coming of the se
[1:19:14] of the seals was to make us know who God
[1:19:17] is, who our father is.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; To know his nature.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; What is his nature,
[1:19:26] how he lives,
[1:19:28] what he likes and what he doesn't like.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Do we know our father?
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Do we know our father?
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Can we copy for our father?
[1:19:40] Oh yes. Is he a forgiving father?
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Even in your tattered clothes,
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; he can still give you a hug.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Me?
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Not me. I'm just too low. I'm too far.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; I don't think so. He sends an angel.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; To speak to your heart. Hallelujah.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Now, how do you know
[1:20:13] that you are in him?
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; How do you know that you are in him?
[1:20:24] He flashes the word before you.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; When the word is flashed before you,
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; how is your reaction?
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Brother say, how is your reaction?
[1:20:39] Yeah.
[1:20:42] The way you react to the word
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:47] shows that you were there.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Shows that you are there.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; It is that charm of life that is telling
[1:20:58] you that is right.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; That is right.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, you may not have reached that level.
[1:21:10] You may not have reached there, but
[1:21:12] right deep in your heart that jump of
[1:21:15] life is telling you, Lord, help me. I
[1:21:18] want more of that. I want more of that.
[1:21:22] Let me grow higher.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; That charm of life.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; So the way you react to the word
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; shows whether you are there
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; or you are not there. Amen.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; If you are there, you can't help
[1:21:39] yourself.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Getting excited
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; by hearing when this word is being
[1:21:47] preached, when the truth is presented
[1:21:50] before you.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can't help yourself.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, how is your reaction?
[1:22:04] How is your reaction?
[1:22:06] How do you know your name was there?
[1:22:11] How do you receive the word
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; today?
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:24] Oh my.
[1:22:26] Now
[1:22:28] all those things that he did had nothing
[1:22:31] to do with his adoption.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Now by the way so many sons were being
[1:22:39] adopted in those days. Are they written
[1:22:42] in the Bible?
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:22:49] Why are they not written? But the story
[1:22:52] of the prodical son is written
[1:22:55] because of the special character.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; One of the character is for him to come
[1:23:01] to himself.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:23:08] Oh my.
[1:23:14] Okay.
[1:23:17] Amen. Now when you are born in this
[1:23:20] world, you acquired another nature.
[1:23:24] But that nature,
[1:23:27] it only suppressed the charm of life
[1:23:30] that God had put in you.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll explain it.
[1:23:36] That charm of life that is God's
[1:23:38] representation.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; But when you are born, you acquired the
[1:23:43] nature of the world. And that's why
[1:23:46] there is no school in the whole world
[1:23:48] where they train children to tell lies.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:56] It's the nature that you acquired. Yeah.
[1:24:00] But because of that jam of life that was
[1:24:03] deposited in you by God himself, please,
[1:24:07] please, please, I beg you, let's follow
[1:24:09] this. It will help you to stand
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; in the times of the storms. Hallelujah.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; When the storms comes, if you know your
[1:24:19] relationship with the father,
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; nothing will nothing will temper with
[1:24:23] you.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; If we can come to that realization of
[1:24:30] our relationship with our father,
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; that is all that I'm preaching.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; My God. Knowing our relationship with
[1:24:37] the father, the father's relationship
[1:24:40] that made the young man when he came
[1:24:42] before him and said just make me one of
[1:24:44] the hired servants.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; The father could not respond to that.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:24:53] Oh yes.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Let's look at the elder son.
[1:25:01] Let's read it. I I think I I'm better
[1:25:03] off to just read it. Hh. Okay. Let's
[1:25:06] continue with our story.
[1:25:09] Okay. Verse 25.
[1:25:13] Okay. Verse 24. The the love of God.
[1:25:17] For this my son was dead and is alive
[1:25:20] again. He was lost and is found. And
[1:25:23] they began to marry.
[1:25:27] Yeah. Now the father instructing the
[1:25:30] servants
[1:25:32] put on him the best rope.
[1:25:35] What is the best rope?
[1:25:38] We explained it earlier on. Now look at
[1:25:40] the story of Elijah and Elisha.
[1:25:45] Yeah. Yes sir.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Elisha walked with Elijah
[1:25:51] and he came to a point said no
[1:25:54] I need this gift.
[1:25:57] So he asked Elijah give me.
[1:26:02] Then Elijah told him okay fine. If you
[1:26:06] see me when I go
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; come on
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; then you will receive it.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Now the challenge was for him to see
[1:26:13] Elijah going. Amen.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:18] [Laughter]
[1:26:21] Oh, just remain here for 5 minutes. I'm
[1:26:24] coming. No, you can't leave me. Yeah.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; How does it imply to us? Let us read the
[1:26:32] message.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Let us listen to the word.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; You cannot leave the word for a minute.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, just remain here. No, no, no, no,
[1:26:44] no. You can't leave me. He had to make
[1:26:47] sure following the prophet.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Following Elijah, following Elijah. And
[1:26:52] we are living in the days of Elijah.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; So the time came
[1:27:00] when Elijah was going, his mandle had to
[1:27:04] be dropped.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Now that
[1:27:09] was specifically meant for Elijah.
[1:27:13] Now if Elijah was f like me. Yeah.
[1:27:19] He had to work on his body to feed in
[1:27:22] that garment.
[1:27:23] [Laughter]
[1:27:26] How do you work on yourself?
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; The more you eat the word, the more you
[1:27:31] expel the world from you.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Until you fit in that comment.
[1:27:41] Amen.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Now that comment, the prophet calls it a
[1:27:45] secondhanded rope.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Now when Elijah came to River Jordan,
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; he had the comment. Yes. Yeah.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; But then he said, "Where is the God of
[1:28:00] Elijah?"
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Where is the God of Elijah? Why? Because
[1:28:07] that was a secondhanded rope. I don't
[1:28:10] have time to read all those quotes. But
[1:28:12] the prophet says it was a secondhanded
[1:28:15] rope, but we need a fresh rope.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Directly specifically made for you and
[1:28:24] you alone.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; That rope has power had the power of
[1:28:30] Elijah. The power of God in Elijah.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:35] So that's why he asked, "Oh, where is
[1:28:38] the court of Elijah?" When he asked for
[1:28:41] the court of Elijah, the water parted.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Now that comment,
[1:28:50] let me read it.
[1:28:54] Oh
[1:28:55] yes.
[1:28:57] God help us.
[1:29:04] That rope 54304
[1:29:09] 54304
[1:29:11] paragraph 36.
[1:29:26] Okay, we are almost.
[1:29:30] One time Jesus was asked, "Let my son
[1:29:33] sit on your right, on your right and
[1:29:35] left hand in the kingdom." He said, "Can
[1:29:37] you drink the cup that I drink?" She
[1:29:40] said, "Yes." Say, "Can you be baptized
[1:29:43] with the baptism that I am baptized
[1:29:45] with?" Said, "Yes." Say, "You can, but
[1:29:48] the right and the left hand is not
[1:29:51] mine." So the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:29:54] was upon Christ when he was taken up on
[1:29:58] the day of Pentecost.
[1:30:00] 120 people went in the upper room up
[1:30:03] there with their eyes straight towards
[1:30:06] heaven watching. And when he threw that
[1:30:09] rope of the Holy Ghost back down there.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; So what is that rope?
[1:30:16] The Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; So the rope is the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; And that's why I said if you have the
[1:30:27] three elements of adoption,
[1:30:32] then you are a candidate.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:38] Now
[1:30:40] Jesus Christ.
[1:30:42] Okay. Can you let's also go to 580324.
[1:30:48] 580324
[1:30:50] paragraph 105.
[1:30:59] Paragraph 105.
[1:31:02] Thank you for your service today.
[1:31:10] Okay. Paragraph 105.
[1:31:25] Okay.
[1:31:27] 58 0324.
[1:31:32] Yes.
[1:31:34] 105.
[1:31:38] The prophet says that robe that God put
[1:31:42] on Jesus Christ on Mount Transfiguration
[1:31:45] was the rope of immortality.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Do you see now the importance of the
[1:31:52] rope?
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:32:00] Okay. Because of time, let's let's just
[1:32:02] go ahead. Okay. Now,
[1:32:09] how do you know that your name is in the
[1:32:11] Lamb's Book of Life?
[1:32:16] How you respond?
[1:32:20] Hello.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; How you respond when the word is flashed
[1:32:25] before you.
[1:32:27] When the word is flashed before you and
[1:32:29] you see your name.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Revelation chapter 5.
[1:32:52] And I saw the right hand of him that sat
[1:32:56] on the throne, a book written within,
[1:32:58] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:33:01] seals. And I saw a strong angel
[1:33:03] proclaiming with a loud voice, who is
[1:33:05] worthy to open the book, and to loose
[1:33:08] the seals thereof? And no man in heaven,
[1:33:11] nor in earth, neither under the earth
[1:33:14] was able to open the book, neither to
[1:33:16] look there on. And I wept much, because
[1:33:19] no man was found worthy to open and to
[1:33:22] read the book, neither to look there on.
[1:33:25] And one of the elders saith unto me,
[1:33:27] weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe
[1:33:30] of Judah, the root of David, hath
[1:33:33] prevailed to open the book, and to loose
[1:33:35] the seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo,
[1:33:39] in the midst of the throne, and of the
[1:33:41] four peace, and in the midst of the
[1:33:44] elders, stood a lamb, as it had been
[1:33:46] slain, having seven thorns, and seven
[1:33:49] eyes, which are the seven spirits of
[1:33:52] God, sent forth into all the earth. And
[1:33:55] he came and took the book out of the
[1:33:58] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:34:01] throne. And when he had taken the book
[1:34:04] and the four piece and four four and 20
[1:34:07] elders fell down before the lamp having
[1:34:10] everyone every one of them hs and called
[1:34:13] in vials full of odas which are the
[1:34:15] prayers of the saints and they sang a
[1:34:18] new song.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Okay, because of time and John
[1:34:27] heard
[1:34:29] let's read it. Okay.
[1:34:32] Uh verse 11. And I beheld and I heard
[1:34:35] the voice of many angels round about the
[1:34:37] throne and the beast and the elders. And
[1:34:40] the number of them was 10,000 times
[1:34:43] 10,000 and thousands of thousands saying
[1:34:46] with a loud voice, "Worthy is the lamp
[1:34:48] that was lain to receive power and
[1:34:50] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:34:53] and glory and blessings. And every
[1:34:57] creature, verse 13, and every creature
[1:34:59] which is in heaven and on earth and
[1:35:02] under the earth, and such as are in the
[1:35:05] sea, and all that are in them, had I
[1:35:09] saying, "Blessed and honor, and glory,
[1:35:12] and power be unto him that siteth upon
[1:35:15] the throne." Oh my goodness.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; When John saw his name,
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; come on, brother.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Shake yourself.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; When John saw his name,
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; he said, "All the creatures in heaven,
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; on earth, under the earth, in the sea,
[1:35:37] they heard him."
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; And some of us up to now, we have not
[1:35:46] even said amen.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Are you John?
[1:35:54] Have you seen your name?
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Have you seen your name?
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Your name is your inheritance.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Your name is your inheritance.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; How can you see your inheritance? And
[1:36:08] you just sit there.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[1:36:14] I don't know.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; God help us. Amen.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; When John saw his name,
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; pastor, when you saw your name,
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; when you see your name, you cannot you
[1:36:31] can't help yourself,
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; you cannot. When you see your name,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; now we are here to dress our
[1:36:38] inheritance.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Now we say the book, your name in the
[1:36:42] book of life is your inheritance.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; So that's what we are following up. Yes.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Your name in the book of life is your
[1:36:52] inheritance.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; So when you see your name, you can't
[1:36:57] help yourself like John to say glory and
[1:37:01] honor.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; I'm sure if he was seated close to a
[1:37:10] neighbor Yeah. he must have shouted
[1:37:13] until the neighbor said, "What is wrong
[1:37:15] with this guy?
[1:37:18] What was wrong? He had seen his name
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; and that name is your inheritance.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; That name is your inheritance.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Have you seen your name?
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Have you seen your name?
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Can we behave like people who have seen
[1:37:35] our names?
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Can we?
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; People who have seen their names.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; You are so special.
[1:37:45] You are so special. Look at the proc.
[1:37:50] Look at the prodical son.
[1:37:53] Help me to get uh
[1:38:00] Okay.
[1:38:07] The message the protocol paragraph 170.
[1:38:23] Okay.
[1:38:26] 508.7
[1:38:28] A
[1:38:34] Paragraph 170.
[1:38:39] I know there are those ones who are
[1:38:40] praying that I finish
[1:38:48] but I can't finish without proving this
[1:38:50] point.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; The prophet says he was the prodical
[1:38:56] son.
[1:38:58] Yeah. I want that that quote to come.
[1:39:02] That's why I said we are the prodical
[1:39:04] sons.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the prophet said he was the
[1:39:08] prodical son.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Now, if the prophet said he was, he says
[1:39:13] he was the prodical son, then who are
[1:39:15] we?
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:18] So, if we are the prodical sons, then we
[1:39:21] need to come to ourselves.
[1:39:25] It is
[1:39:28] 50827
[1:39:30] A.
[1:39:41] Okay. Paragraph 170.
[1:39:50] The prophet says, "I remember when I was
[1:39:53] lost and undone
[1:39:55] out in the world dying, a sinner laying
[1:39:59] on a hospital bed. The doctor said I had
[1:40:03] just a few moments to live. But I cried
[1:40:07] coming down to the road. And as I cried,
[1:40:10] I ran to meet the heavenly father."
[1:40:16] The prodical son, the father saw him a
[1:40:19] far off
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; and he came.
[1:40:26] It is the father looking for you.
[1:40:31] When the prodical son was eating with
[1:40:35] with swine and everything, yeah, it was
[1:40:39] the father
[1:40:41] who caused the situation.
[1:40:44] Let me explain it.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah,
[1:40:48] a situation can come that will make you
[1:40:51] remember you have a father.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:40:57] a situation will come that will make you
[1:41:01] remember you have a father.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; So that situation that caused the the
[1:41:08] prodical son to remember it was a phone
[1:41:10] call
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; looking for him. Hey, where are you?
[1:41:17] Oh, I'm here. I'm here. Oh, life is hard
[1:41:20] here. I'm eating with the swine.
[1:41:25] And by the way,
[1:41:27] the Jews,
[1:41:29] the lowest life that one ever went was
[1:41:33] to mingle with pigs.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; That was the worst position one can go.
[1:41:41] So now you can imagine how psyritten he
[1:41:44] was.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; But God sends an angel
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; to him
[1:41:52] and say, "Would you mind going back to
[1:41:54] your father?
[1:41:57] God help us."
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Let us be an angel to somebody.
[1:42:07] May God help us to be an angel to
[1:42:10] somebody.
[1:42:12] But instead of being an angel to
[1:42:14] somebody, yeah, we have this idea of
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:42:22] I can't sit close to Joseph. He's a
[1:42:24] sinner.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; we know he's alive.
[1:42:31] No wonder you are seated alone.
[1:42:34] Sorry. He's
[1:42:42] my friend.
[1:42:44] Yeah. I'm I'm trying to explain
[1:42:46] something.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now look at the prodical son.
[1:42:52] The elder son.
[1:42:54] I'm just about to close. The elder son.
[1:43:00] Okay, let's continue. Now his elder son
[1:43:03] was in the field, and as he came and a
[1:43:05] true nigh to the house, he heard music
[1:43:08] and dancing. And he called one of the
[1:43:11] servants, and asked, "What these things
[1:43:13] meant?" And he said unto him, "Thy
[1:43:16] brother is come, and thy father hath
[1:43:18] killed the fatted calf."
[1:43:21] Because he hath received him safe and
[1:43:23] sound. And he was angry,
[1:43:27] and would not go in. Look at this
[1:43:30] brother. Yeah,
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; he was angry and he could not go in.
[1:43:37] Hello,
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, and he was angry and would not go
[1:43:47] in. Therefore came his father out. Can
[1:43:51] you imagine
[1:43:53] this scenario?
[1:43:56] How angry he was? Do you know sometimes
[1:43:59] we get angry we don't want even to go to
[1:44:01] church.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; You are so angry with a brother and you
[1:44:08] even don't want to see him.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Put your character now to the character
[1:44:14] of the elder son.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; He was so angry that he could not go in.
[1:44:20] It was the father who came out.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's see now. Let's let's let's
[1:44:27] look at it. Yeah.
[1:44:31] And okay. Therefore came his father out
[1:44:35] and entreated him. And he answering said
[1:44:38] to his father, "Lo, these many years do
[1:44:41] I serve thee, neither transgressed I any
[1:44:44] time thine commandment, and yet thou
[1:44:48] never kest me a kid, that I might make
[1:44:52] merry with my friends.
[1:44:59] God help us.
[1:45:01] But as soon as thy son was come
[1:45:05] which hath devoured thy living thy
[1:45:08] living with hallows, thou hast killed
[1:45:11] for him the fatted calf. And he said
[1:45:14] unto him, Son, thou art ever with me,
[1:45:17] and all that I have is thine. It was
[1:45:20] meat that we should make merry and be
[1:45:24] glad for this thy brother was dead and
[1:45:27] is alive.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; This one is complaining what have you
[1:45:34] done for this one? But because of the
[1:45:36] father, the father's love, he says he
[1:45:38] was dead and is alive and now that he
[1:45:41] has come back alive, let us marry.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Let's look at the fatted calf.
[1:45:50] Yeah,
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; it was the fatted calf that was picked.
[1:45:57] Now when God visited Abraham, Abraham
[1:46:01] killed the fatted calf.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; So the fatted calf are for gods.
[1:46:06] [Laughter]
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; So now you can see the character of the
[1:46:15] protein.
[1:46:16] The fatted calves are for gods. Yeah.
[1:46:21] When God visit Abraham, Abraham killed
[1:46:24] the fatted calf.
[1:46:26] So it is made for God. Hello.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Do do we see the point?
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; So this prodical son had a special
[1:46:38] character.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because of the charm of life.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because of that charm of
[1:46:47] life. Are we feeding on the fatted calf?
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Are we feeding on the fatted calf?
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my. May God create more hunger in us
[1:46:58] for the word.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; May God create more thirst for the word.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; May God create more hunger. We have the
[1:47:06] fatted calf that has been killed for us.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's why the prophet
[1:47:10] say whomsoever much is given much will
[1:47:13] be required.
[1:47:15] We have been given so much revelation.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; That was not given to the Lutherans
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; that was not given to the Methodist that
[1:47:25] was not given to the Pentecostals.
[1:47:28] Now we are feeding on the fatted
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; cows. Who are we? We are gods.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. A cow will give birth to a cow.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; A sheep will give birth to a sheep.
[1:47:48] Yeah. What about God?
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my god.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Now, we started by saying, Yeah. one of
[1:47:58] the qualifications for adoption, you
[1:48:01] must belong to the father.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. You must have been his.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; From the beginning.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Now for us, we were in his mind.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; We only acquired a different nature when
[1:48:17] we came in this world.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; But still God's chin was in us.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; And that's what he has been looking for.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason he has flashed the
[1:48:26] word, the message of the hour.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; And you see yourself. You say, "Oh, that
[1:48:32] looks like me."
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; And you embrace it.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; May God help the church to come to
[1:48:43] herself.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet is saying.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; May God help each one of us to come to
[1:48:48] ourselves.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; God help me.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Do you know your father?
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Do you know your father? as a forgiving
[1:49:01] father or as a cruel father.
[1:49:04] Yeah.
[1:49:06] Every time he sees you, he pins the pins
[1:49:08] you down.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; There was there was a clip where
[1:49:13] somebody was making fun but the father
[1:49:15] was asking was telling the the the the
[1:49:19] father was telling the son
[1:49:22] you are a dog. You are a dog. Then the
[1:49:24] son said, "Okay, then if a dog gives
[1:49:28] birth to a dog,
[1:49:33] [Laughter]
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; but God gives birth to God."
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; So who are we?
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Who are we?
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; No, some are not even responding.
[1:49:51] Who are we?
[1:49:54] Who are we?
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; So, can we behave like gods?
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Can we behave like gods?
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Sister, can we behave like God?
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Can we act like gods?
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; All that was in God was bought in
[1:50:13] Christ. All that was in Christ was
[1:50:16] bought in the
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; for what purpose? to continue
[1:50:22] the work that was not fulfilled by Jesus
[1:50:26] Christ.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:29] Hallelujah.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; What was one of the works he did?
[1:50:35] Forgiving.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Do we forgive?
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Or we behave like the elder son.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; He did this. He came with records.
[1:50:48] Yeah, he came with records to prove to
[1:50:52] the father he has done this. You gave
[1:50:56] you gave him this. He went and lived a
[1:50:58] riotous life. He wasted everything and
[1:51:02] now he has come and you have killed for
[1:51:04] him fatted calf and yet me I've been
[1:51:06] faithful.
[1:51:09] So as far as adoption was concerned he
[1:51:12] deserved to be adopted.
[1:51:15] But look at the nature in him.
[1:51:18] anger,
[1:51:21] unforgiving.
[1:51:23] Hello.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:28] Oh my goodness. I don't have time to go
[1:51:31] to the ring. Let me just mention
[1:51:33] something about the ring that we I wish.
[1:51:38] Now, the ring
[1:51:42] in the Old Testament, they never used to
[1:51:45] sign with a pen.
[1:51:48] They used to give a ring. So that ring
[1:51:51] used to act as a signature.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Now here is somebody who has come from
[1:51:58] from living a riotous life.
[1:52:02] Yeah.
[1:52:04] He comes and you know what has happened.
[1:52:08] Now here he comes and you give him a
[1:52:11] ring.
[1:52:13] Meaning all the money that is in the
[1:52:16] that is in the bank, he can write a
[1:52:18] check and withdraw it.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:52:29] In our natural thinking, can we do that,
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; brother Victor?
[1:52:35] Can you?
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can you
[1:52:42] Here is somebody who has come
[1:52:46] from living around. He wasted
[1:52:48] everything.
[1:52:50] He wasted everything. He didn't have
[1:52:52] anything when he came back. And yet you
[1:52:55] give him a signature.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:07] Okay.
[1:53:09] uh in the Bible Genesis 41:42.
[1:53:18] We may not reach on the shoes, but uh
[1:53:23] I hope God will inspire one of the
[1:53:25] preachers to finish it.
[1:53:28] Amen.
[1:53:31] Genesis 41:42.
[1:53:36] And Pharaoh took off his ring from his
[1:53:39] hand and put it upon Joseph's hand and
[1:53:43] arrayed him in vestures of the of fine
[1:53:46] linen and put a cold chain about his
[1:53:49] neck.
[1:53:52] What does that mean? Pharaoh putting his
[1:53:58] ring on Joseph.
[1:54:02] meaning Joseph is now in control.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; He's in control.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; He can sign the check
[1:54:18] and all the money is gone.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; So that is the purpose of the ring. Now
[1:54:25] do you see how now important that ring
[1:54:27] was to the protoan?
[1:54:30] He was given the ring,
[1:54:33] a signature.
[1:54:36] He can sign. Whomsoever he hires will be
[1:54:39] hired.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Preach it, brother. Come on.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Whomsoever he forgives will be forgiven.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Preach it.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, these articles of these symbols of
[1:54:58] adoption My goodness,
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; we've not come to the conclusion of
[1:55:03] adoption because I remember when I
[1:55:05] started the subject, a brother in late
[1:55:07] preach said, "Oh, brother, you've you've
[1:55:09] missed it." I said, "Give it time."
[1:55:13] Later on, he told me, "I didn't
[1:55:14] understand where you are going. Now he's
[1:55:17] even more richer than I expected." You
[1:55:20] see, when we talk about adoption, we run
[1:55:22] on the on Jesus Christ when he was
[1:55:24] adopted.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, this is what happened. But in
[1:55:28] between here, let's see what happens. It
[1:55:31] has so many. The prophet says the story
[1:55:34] of the protocans brings the true picture
[1:55:37] of adoption.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Now today at least you can see
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; that picture of adoption.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the condition that we
[1:55:50] are in?
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; May God help us. Hallelujah.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; May God help us to come to ourselves.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Let your prayer be Lord help me to come
[1:56:02] to myself.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Lord help me to come to myself.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Cuz if I come to myself,
[1:56:11] yeah. Then I'll go to my father.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; But you must know your father. How do
[1:56:18] you know your father? By the opening of
[1:56:20] the seals. Yeah, it makes us to know who
[1:56:24] God is, who our father is,
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; his nature, what he loves, what he
[1:56:30] doesn't love.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Let us stand.
[1:56:38] Glory to God.
[1:56:41] Hallelujah.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew, can you come and help me
[1:56:46] to sing? I He knows my name.
[1:57:01] Come on to heaven. Yes.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; He knows my name.
[1:57:10] He knows my every thought.
[1:57:16] He sees each tear that falls.
[1:57:22] and hears me when I call. I have a
[1:57:26] maker.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; I have a maker.
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:35] He formed my heart.
[1:57:40] [Music]
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; And before even time began,
[1:57:46] my life was in his hand.
[1:57:53] He knows my name.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; He knows my every thought.
[1:58:06] He sees each tear that falls
[1:58:10] and hears me when I come.
[1:58:16] Oh,
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; I have a father.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; He calls me his own.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; He'll never
[1:58:32] leave me.
[1:58:35] No matter where I go,
[1:58:42] he knows my name.
[1:58:48] He knows my every thought.
[1:58:54] He sees each tear that falls
[1:58:58] and hears me when I call.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad
[1:59:08] that you have a father?
[1:59:11] Amen. That we are his son.
[1:59:14] Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:59:18] Let's sing that chorus. So glad I'm
[1:59:21] yours, Lord. Are you glad
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; that you're his? Amen. Praise God.
[1:59:26] Hallelujah. You know, our inheritance is
[1:59:28] our name. That was good
[1:59:32] because what our name is, that's what we
[1:59:34] are. Amen. Praise God.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; So glad I'm yours, Lord.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Let's raise our hands.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; So glad I'm yours.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; So glad your mercy
[1:59:55] [Music]
[1:59:56] has followed me.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; So glad you found me
[2:00:07] and set me free.
[2:00:10] [Music]
[2:00:12] So glad I'm yours, Lord.
[2:00:17] So glad I'm yours.
[2:00:22] So glad I'm free, Lord.
[2:00:27] [Music]
[2:00:28] So glad I'm free.
[2:00:33] So glad your grace has
[2:00:38] laid hold on me.
[2:00:42] [Music]
[2:00:43] I once was captive.
[2:00:48] I was bound.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; But by your grace, Lord,
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; by freedom.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord for freedom.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Wasn't that good?
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we've got to know who we are.
[2:01:13] Amen. Who are we?
[2:01:16] Amen. We're sons and daughters of Jesus
[2:01:19] Christ. Hallelujah. What a wonderful
[2:01:22] thing, isn't it? Amen. Maybe what chorus
[2:01:26] comes to my mind is what a wonderful
[2:01:28] thing. We know that chorus, don't we?
[2:01:30] Let's sing that one.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful thing. A wonderful
[2:01:37] thing to be saved from sin. Have peace
[2:01:42] within to be made a joint with Jesus my
[2:01:47] king. What a wonderful, wonderful thing.
[2:01:52] What a wonderful thing. A wonderful
[2:01:56] thing to be saved from sin. Have peace
[2:02:01] with him. to be made a joint air with
[2:02:05] Jesus my king. What a wonderful,
[2:02:08] wonderful thing.
[2:02:11] What a wonderful thing. A wonderful

[2:02:20] within to be made a joint air with Jesus
[2:02:24] my king. What a wonderful wonderful
[2:02:28] thing.
[2:02:29] Oh, what a wonderful thing. A wonderful
[2:02:33] thing to be saved from sin, have peace
[2:02:38] within, to be made a joint air with
[2:02:42] Jesus, my king. What a wonderful,
[2:02:45] wonderful thing.
[2:02:48] Oh, what a wonderful thing.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say that?
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Can you say that together? What a
[2:02:57] wonderful thing.
[2:02:59] Can you realize we are gods?
[2:03:03] That's so incredible.
[2:03:05] But if we are a son of God, we are of
[2:03:10] God. Can you say amen? We're born of
[2:03:13] God. What a wonderful thing that is.
[2:03:17] Amen. Praise God. I was so happy to
[2:03:20] listen to the word of God this morning.
[2:03:22] I know some of you slept. I don't know
[2:03:24] how we could sleep in the service.
[2:03:28] I really don't know when we hear the
[2:03:30] word of God of who we are that we are
[2:03:34] sons and daughters of God. That is an
[2:03:37] amazing thing. Praise God. Brother
[2:03:40] Victor, would you come and close the
[2:03:42] service in a word of prayer? Would you?

[2:04:03] has been revealed to us as our father.

[2:04:18] continued in your bride. Amen.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Father, we heard your voice this morning
[2:04:22] that we are not chickens. Lord, we heard
[2:04:25] Lord Jesus that you will not even accept
[2:04:27] us as servants. Lord,
[2:04:29] [Music]
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; you've established us in the highest
[2:04:33] office
[2:04:35] next to you, Lord Jesus.
[2:04:37] [Music]
[2:04:39] Lord, we pray that the Holy Spirit would
[2:04:42] open all of these things that have been
[2:04:45] spoken to your children.

[2:04:50] life, Lord Jesus.

[2:04:55] servant, Lord.

[2:05:02] us, Lord.

[2:05:05] Father. Lord, I pray that you will bless
[2:05:07] them, replenish everything, Lord Jesus.
[2:05:10] And I pray, my God, that whatever their
[2:05:12] desires are, Lord, before your throne,
[2:05:16] Lord, would you remember them? I pray
[2:05:18] you remember this body of believers as
[2:05:20] well.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; My God, I pray, oh God, that we will
[2:05:24] bear one another's infirmities, Father,
[2:05:26] that the virtues of Christ, these
[2:05:29] attributes that are seeking expression
[2:05:32] through us, Lord,
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; that we will submit ourselves to you,
[2:05:36] Lord Jesus, and you will finish the work
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; that you prophesied to be done in the
[2:05:42] last day bride.
[2:05:44] Remove
[2:05:46] Lord God condemnation from your
[2:05:48] children.
[2:05:50] Let them take the word oh God. This is
[2:05:54] freedom. This is liberty Lord that we
[2:05:58] are not subject to the powers of
[2:06:00] darkness anymore.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; He who the son has set free.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; He who the son has made free.
[2:06:11] The word has been spoken. Father, may we
[2:06:14] never live yet the same. Lord, all those
[2:06:18] things,
[2:06:20] Father, that are plaguing our lives
[2:06:23] because we don't know who we are, we are
[2:06:26] asking you to open our blinded eyes that
[2:06:30] we will be like John. Let us see our
[2:06:33] name in the book.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord help us.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; And let the Holy Ghost declare the name
[2:06:38] in the earth, Lord.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; As your children go with you, protect
[2:06:43] them for the entire week in their going
[2:06:46] out and their coming in Lord. Every
[2:06:49] decision they have to make, let it be
[2:06:51] inspired by the Holy Ghost.
[2:06:56] Whatever their need and father, let the
[2:06:59] word that has been spoken,
[2:07:02] let it provide their needs. Let the
[2:07:04] voice of God be real.
