[Music] Just bear with me while I find the song. I um I had thought I would sing a certain song this morning, but um that changed. So, um I had this song on my heart actually uh a few services ago. Um but I uh I wasn't able to sing it at the time. So, um I will sing it now. Sorry, I can't find it. But I'll just sing it off of my memory. Can I pray for you? [Music] Can I mention your name to the Lord? When I seek his face, can I plead your case? That's what praying is for. I'll help you carry your cross and find the way when you're lost. If you'll let Jesus be, too. I know that he'll see you through. Can I pray for you? I've been your friend for a while. I know you're hiding behind that smile and you're keeping inside tears that should have been cried. You've been brave through this trial. You've been as strong as a stone against the stormy winds that have blown. But you have friends who care more than willing to share. Don't face those troubles alone. Can I pray for you? Can I mention your name to the Lord? When I seek his face, can I plead your case? That's what praying is for. I'll help you carry your cross. Lo and find the way when you're lost.

Um, it's a song that God gave me back back in 2017 when I was going through a blood issue. He was preparing me. That was before I went through a blood issue for two straight years. It started in 2019. And uh, I didn't understand the meaning of the song. I didn't understand why God gave me that song. But then while I was going through it, um I I was listening to a tape and I don't remember the the title of the tape, the the preaching, the sermon, I mean, and I stayed until the end and the prophet was praying for for the sick and he was discerning people's problems and it came across he started he started talking about this sister a colored sister and he said between you and I there's blood and and he was talking about my situation and he he prayed and from there I started getting my healing and that that's when I understood the meaning of that song. So bear with me it's not I didn't practice it. You're the [Music] healer of every pain I feel. The satisfier of every void within. You're the redeemer that came to set me free. &gt;&gt; You're the supplier of everything I need. &gt;&gt; You're the healer of every pain I feel. the satisfier of every void within. You're the redeemer that came to set me free. Lord, I have friends, but Jesus, you are my best. Lord, yes. You bore my shame, burdens, and complaints. You are my only trust. You've never failed me yet. Many do change, but Jesus, you remain the same. Yes, I have friends, but Jesus, you are my best. Lord, yes. You bore my shames, burdens, and complaints. You are my only trust. You've never failed me. Yet, many do change, but Jesus, you remain the same. Jesus never fails. Jesus never fails.

It's a long long chapter, but um you're turning your Bible or I just have a suggestion that I'm thinking and maybe praying about it. Well, I'm thinking to separate the the the the Sunday school into two groups and the younger one and also I myself or someone else can take the older one maybe from 10 or 11 to to to whoever want to be in the Sunday school. I just want to take that so that to separate that. So we might have to alternate one Sunday. So I can just take with the older one so that the young one can stay with a bit of the lower class and then I can take someone who can volunteer take from 10 up. Um but just something to think about it and I'm praying about it but let's see how might go. um Psalm 136. I would like to the brother the brothers and to read the verse. Let's read it together. Um and then the sisters and the children to read for his mercy endures forever. And then the brothers just read and what God be have to be thankful about and the sisters and the children read for his mercy endureth forever. Let's start together. Oh, give thanks unto the Lord for he is good. &gt;&gt; For his mercy endures forever. &gt;&gt; Oh, give thanks unto the God of gods. &gt;&gt; For his mercy endures forever. &gt;&gt; Oh, give thanks to the Lord of lords. &gt;&gt; For his mercy endures forever. &gt;&gt; To him who alone doeth great wonders. &gt;&gt; His mercy endures forever. To him that by wisdom made the heavens, &gt;&gt; mercy endureth forever. &gt;&gt; To him that stretched out the earth above the waters, &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever. &gt;&gt; To him that made great lights. &gt;&gt; For his mercy endureth forever. &gt;&gt; The sun to rule by day. &gt;&gt; For his mercy endureth forever. &gt;&gt; The moon and stars to rule by night. &gt;&gt; For his mercy endureth forever. To him that smote Egypt in the firstborn, &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever, &gt;&gt; and brought out Israel from among them, &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever. &gt;&gt; With a strong hand and with a stretched out home, &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever. &gt;&gt; To him which divided the Red Sea into parts, &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever. and made Israel to pass through the midst of it. &gt;&gt; For his mercy endureth forever, &gt;&gt; but overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea, &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever. &gt;&gt; To him which led his people through the wilderness, &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever. &gt;&gt; To him which smoked great kings, &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever. &gt;&gt; And slew famous kings, &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever. Canon, king of the Amorites, &gt;&gt; mercy endures forever. &gt;&gt; And Og, the king of Bashan, &gt;&gt; for his mercy endures forever. &gt;&gt; And gave their land for inheritage. &gt;&gt; For his mercy endureth forever, &gt;&gt; even in heritage unto Israel, his servant, &gt;&gt; for his mercy endureth forever, &gt;&gt; who remembered us in our law estate, &gt;&gt; for his mercy endures forever, &gt;&gt; and hath redeemed us from our enemies. for his mercy endures forever. &gt;&gt; Who giveth food to all flesh &gt;&gt; for his mercy endures forever. &gt;&gt; Oh, give thanks unto the God of heaven. &gt;&gt; For his mercy endures. &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. He's worthy to be praised. He has blessed us tremendously. Has been good to us. &gt;&gt; He has healed us from our sicknesses. &gt;&gt; He has redeemed us. &gt;&gt; And he's still walking with us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He will never leave you. He never forsake you. He will always be with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; The God of Israel is the our God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He never slams. He never sleeps. He watches over us. &gt;&gt; The God of victory. Amen. May God bless you richly. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we have your seat. Amen. So always be thankful to the Lord for what he has done in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. I invite you again to go to Isaiah 59. Isaiah 59 familiar scripture. Just want to take it a bit in a different angle or maybe the same angle, but Isaiah 59 18 says, "According to their deeds, according he will repay fury to his adversaries, recompense recompense to his enemies, to the islands. He will repay recompense. So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him. &gt;&gt; So go to Lord in prayer. Let's just say thank you Lord. Let's just go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we thank you again Lord as we have opened the holy scripture. Father Lord, we realize that no man can help another man unless you use that man, Father, with the Holy Spirit and anoint him, Father Lord. So Lord, we just pray that you anoint the speaker, anoint the hearers, Lord, this morning. Lord, this has been a busy weekend. Maybe you are tired in the body and but Father, Lord Jesus Christ, help us to just give you a little bit of attention this morning. Just Lord, as we hear from you, Lord, put the men aside, the men's ideas aside, but you take the full preminence. Father, we just want to say thank you for what you have done in our lives, Lord, and continue to do. And as we desire just to walk with you, Father, we give you the glory and the honor in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Like to speak, share with you a small thought this morning. on the the standard that's raised by the spirit of the Lord. As the promise says there, when the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him, against the enemy. Just put the title, the spirit of the Lord shall lift up the standard against him. the standard raised by the spirit of the lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just g a a description of what they said here definition of as the standard. He said in ancient warfare a standard was a flag or a banner used to rally troops or signal a response. So to lift out a standard, a standard means God will raise a battle flood and lead a counterattack or defense pushing back the enemy. You know when the enemy comes as a flood, you know the flood the flood is so powerful things you know the flood when it comes destroys everything. It destroys everything you have can't stand it. If it comes with such power, you can try to stop it. You can try to do different things. But if it is if if the stren if it's so powerful, you can't you can't stand it. It just erase everything. It just destroys everything. It's there to destroy and and sometimes it start very very slowly, right? Sometimes if if you have blocked everything to be just going under the door and slowly slowly and then the water will be rising rising slowly slowly before you realize then you have to to jump and you have to run away. The only way really if if it's so powerful the only way to be above the only way to to to to overcome it is to be above it. The only way to be overcome the flood is just to be above it and you have to fly above it in order to be an overcome. So I said that is an idea just to realize that when the enemy comes as a flood what God is asking you is that what God is going to do is to is just to live that the standard just to make you a little bit live above that flood just don't don't don't stay in the flood don't try to overcome it from from the bottom from the bottom try to go higher than that then we realize oh it's destroying other things but it can't destroy you because you are above the flood. &gt;&gt; So God have make sure that when the enemy comes as a flooding, he will lift up a standard. Amen. Above that flood. And that's the promise that God has given us. God can never even allow trials that are greater than what you can stand because he knows he knows that you can never you can never be defeated. &gt;&gt; He knows he can never lose you. Amen. He knows that he can never permit anything that the enemy will destroy your soul. He can destroy the body. He can even try to entertain the mind but he can never destroy your soul. Amen. God can never allow something that will make his son to lose his son to lose his daughter. That's our God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Glory to his name. &gt;&gt; So when it happens when it happens we know when it standard when when when the enemy comes he comes there just to destroy. He's there to destroy. The prophet will say and I want to take this as a as a as actually the thought that I want to go from the this quote prophet says in the junction of time it says notice another thing that he did back there we notice it during the time of this great turmoil when men's heart begin to wax cold and away from God woman became such an idol when the sons of God seen the daughters of men when they were fair be became a sexual order it says look at Today what we are living in not speaking against honorable women no sir that God's instrument but those who cares not for themsel how there is so many in the opposite side going about marrying giving in marriage God said so God said so in the Bible Jesus said before Noah's time at the end there were marrying and giving in Mary how the great turmoil is in the world today and realize that and this is what what I want to put the emphasis now one thing that caused that the Bible said that the spirit great spirit came down, evil spirit got into these people and done these things and we see the same evil spirit working in our day. Now notice again that not only that but when all hell turns loose all heaven turns loose also. Amen. When the enemy comes in like a flat and he quotes that the spirit of God raise up a standard against it and these two forces is always showed up at the junction. I believe we are living in the time of the junction. We are living in the time of the junction with the time the junction leaving from the churches into going into the the the bride age the time of junction the time of sjunction for the church for the bride to go into the millennium. It's also a time of junction, precious times. But during those time of junctions, the evil spirit, the evil spirit comes in order to fight. But God is not just is not defenseless. God has to provide a way also to overcome the enemy. &gt;&gt; God has given the bride the greatest weapon in order to overcome the enemy. In the time we are living in as the world is getting is getting worse and worse and and we sometimes we put too much emphasis on that and sometimes for the good reasons the world is getting insane and different things it's hell turning loose we understand that we see that we realize that we see the mind of the people we see how they are thinking they're think they have lost their mind they can't reason properly the virtues have been destroyed and their mind are not thinking properly But the the the God doesn't leave the bride defenseless. God has provided a way. All heaven is also turned loose in order to give the bride what she needs, what she needs in order to overcome. Amen. Do you believe that? And God is making us not only to be the one who has to be on the defense, but he also has provided what we have in order to be on the offense. Amen. We have all the weapon. We got into details maybe further the Lord allows. Amen. And then it says and and then and then and then you go on and we go on on that that beginning. But as as as I'm just trying to put here it says and how can I overcome says when we sometimes tempted to go back many of you tempted to go back to the denomination go back and take up goes all the world say what denomination you belong to what church are you affiliated with? You are tempted to do that. All of us are our sisters are tempted to go back go back in join up with some of the rest of the churches with some of the assemblies and churches of God. Some of them still be Pentecostal. Let your hair cut off and dress dress just about any way you want to. You are tempted to do that. Go back and be popular with the wicked generation that you are living with. When this is the major sin in our days is the major sin among the people. Worldliness. Worldliness is the major sin. Because that's what the enemy comes and he just put a little bit of a worldly habit, worldly behavior, worldly thinking. Amen. And that's what the enemy is just like a flat. Sometimes you realize comes full force. Sometimes come just a little bit slowly and slowly and it's getting but worldliness is coming in and oh world but I'm still dressed properly and everything. Yeah. in the dressing properly it's it's good but sometimes it's just the thinking just oh worldly thinking or we start reasoning you start you start you start if if if you don't stay in the channel of the word of God if you don't stay in the channel of of the channel of prayer you might think you you might not realize it but you start thinking like the world thinks &gt;&gt; says oh oh you know I think we're talking I forgot the sisters you know oh you know now a sister you You you have to be working you know you have to be professional how you have to be who can put in a resume housewife that's that's old time but you don't realize it becomes worldly thinking a little bit of worldly thinking or or a man what is a man a real man you know you can never admit that you are wrong always you have always to be the one the chief the chief you cannot admit that you are wrong worldly thinking a little bit going and you don't realize it and it's just a little bit subtle. It's getting there. But it's it's worldly thinking. But when you stay in the channel of the word of God, when you stay in prayer, when you stay in the right atmosphere, then you become sensitive to the things that doesn't belong to the word of God. Oh, I can sense that that's not good. You know, you maybe you bit going on on the low part where you start easily criticizing easily different things and and then when you stay in the channel word of God, you become sensitive to that. the Holy Spirit will bring you back and realize, oh no, I'm a son of God. I should stay positive. I should stay confessing. Maybe you're struggling with a little bit of sickness. You know, if you don't stay in that channel of the word of God, you start thinking what the doctor says. And you start think, oh no, no. According to the medicine, it has never happened that someone can be healed from that and you start if you don't not be careful, you are carried away by that. Oh, how come? What's happening? How come I start thinking like the world is thinking? I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. By his stripes, I'm healed. I stand on God promises. I know that he can never be defeated. The word of God will defeat the enemy any time under any circumstances. So stay in the word of God. The word of God is the greatest weapon that God has given you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The major sin is worldliness. It is what the world is thinking. You start copying what the world is thinking. And the greatest battle have a thought is in the mind. Sometimes it's not in the flesh but it is the mind. That's why we need to be more careful. How am I thinking? Am I thinking like God is thinking? Am I thinking as the word of God says? My thought has to be God's thought. Amen. My thought has to be God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The message pended. Jezebel says, "An old Methodist preacher f friend of mine, brother Kelly, him and sister Kelly used to sing a song, we let down the bars. We let down the bars and we compromised. We've seen we let down the bars. The sheep got out. How did the gods get in?" &gt;&gt; We are wondering how did the gods get in? How come I'm doing this thing? How come this? How come this? Why allow this? Why allow? But you let down the bars. Amen. &gt;&gt; You put the standard so low. Of course, the goats will get in. Of course, the sheep will get out. But no, don't put the standard low. Put the standard high. Keep it high. &gt;&gt; Let leave the message and let it high. Let the message stand with a higher standard. &gt;&gt; But that's that was standard in the old times. It was you. But no, it's the message never dies. It never get expired. It's still life. Amen. Amen. Because we are leaving behind the veil, the inner veil where the mana stays fresh. The message of the hour is the one that bring us into the millennium. It can never die. It can never deteriorate. It can never be expired. It stay alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is a standard? And then the definition in the dictionary gives again a standard is an idea or thing used as a measure a normal model in comparative evaluations. So when you have something that is a standard if if I almost I thought but I forgot you know when you you have that line if it says it is horizontal those who are in the build that that that thing that shows the level right if you put a level if it's not straight it very well if it's not straight you can't be arguing of it no but I know that I build it properly but this level is not saying that it's not straight so it's not straight it &gt;&gt; because this level is the standard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it shows there, that's what it shows. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you put in the vertical, if it shows that that no, that wall is not vertical. No matter what you say, but that standard of the level says it's not vertical. So, it's not vertical. If it says it's vertical, then it's vertical. No matter how you see it, but it looks like it's looks like according to my opinion, it's not vertical. It's not your opinion that matters. It is that standard there, that level. If it stays it vertical, it stays vertical. That what comes with the word of God. When the God says it, we just say amen. &gt;&gt; We might not understand. We might not see it properly. But if the word of God says amen, if the Bible says it, we just believe. &gt;&gt; Because that's the standard. That's the level. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ himself says, "He that rejected me and received not my words and one that judgeth him the word that have ever spoken, the same shall judge him in the last days." What will judge the people? The word of God. The word of God is the standard. It's not religion. You is not a church. Is not you can't say, "Oh, this church if this church is right and then this church will be is not right." It's not about church. It's about the word of God. The word of God is the absolute. The word of God is the supreme judge. The word of God is the is the ultimate, is the referee, is the one that decides behind beyond the word of God. You you can't go beyond the word of God. If you take from the word of God, it's your own life that is being taken out because the word of God is the standard. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep that in your mind. That's what John says in Revelation 11:22 says, "For I testify unto every man that hear the words of the prophecy of this book. If a man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book. If any man shall take away from the words, God shall take away his part after of the book of life." So God warns against tampering with his word. Lowering the standard, watering it down or twisting it leads to judgment. You can't blow it down. You can't make it fit your traditions. You can't make it fit your thinking or your background. You can't even judge by your own experiences. No, it's the word of God. The word of God stands is the absolute. Amen. And that's why we are faithful to the word of God. We are faithful to the message of the hour because it is the standard. Amen. In this time, in order to overcome, we need to stay with the standard that God has raised. Amen. God has raised the standard in order to fight the conditions we are in. If you don't take the standard, you are bound to fail. You have to stay with the standard. The prophet will say, notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person relative to the word for that age. Only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age. And that one messenger is the messenger to the true church. So we can't add another messenger. We can't have another me. Those are the basic things but sometimes I feel so it just breaks my heart how those foundations and you see people becoming another messenger another but what those are basics I mean what what brought us in the message because we have one messenger otherwise you know I don't know we stay in determinations we have one messenger and one message and we have to stay faithful to that message not a man's idea nothing you know not man interpretation But one standard you can't be because you have the greatest church you become the one who can correct the prophet. Then then let's take John also because he had the biggest church. What is what is the reference now? What is the standard now? The word of God is the standard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he speaks for God. He speaks for God by revelation to the church is both true and false. The message is then broadcast to all. But but though it is broadcast for all who come with range within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way. Each individual of that group is the one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger. So the messenger, we have one messenger and each individual has to hear what the messenger says and each individual has to have a personal revelation of what the messenger says. &gt;&gt; You can't rely on the revelation of the church. Says, "No, I'm just part of that church and then I'm saved." No, it has to become a personal revelation. Has become individual affair with God. You have to be born again. Amen. Personally have a personal experience with God. Amen. Are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's very important. Lord, reveal the word of God to me personally. &gt;&gt; I can't just rely on my wife. I can't rely on my husband. I can't rely on my parents. I can't rely on my children. Lord, I want a personal revelation. Lord, I want I want a I want a conference with you. I want a reality. I want a burning bush experience with you. It's required for every age, even in our age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? Amen. &gt;&gt; I know you are foreign. Thank God. Each individual of that group is the one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by the way of the message. Those who hear are not getting those who hear are not getting their own private revelation. You can't say no I hear what the prophet say but now I have my own revelation. I have my own understanding of what this what is the own understanding. Yes. Is it matching what the prophet says or is it your own understanding outside of what the prophet says? Because God reveals his word only. He opens the word only to a prophet. &gt;&gt; He can't open the word beyond the prophet. Amen. Amen. But the prophet gives a revelation and we take that revelation. Of course, we applies it in our lives. We expand it in our life. We expand in our example in our life. The minister will take what the prophet says and make it and make it developed on it in. Oh wow. You see why it is then? Because the Bible says here, the Bible says here, the Bible say give you a lot of examples to back up what the revelation has been given to the prophet. But you don't come up with your own revelation that's outside of the blue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. said those who hear are not getting their own private revelation nor is a group getting their collective revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God says below down is seven exposition seven churches they add here and take away here and soon the message is no longer pew and the revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice &gt;&gt; for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Let me say brother Bam's voice is not the voice of God. The little voice is not the voice of God. But what is saying is the wall is the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God that comes is the voice of God. &gt;&gt; So we have to hear the voice of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Paul warned them to say what he said even as a as Peter did. Likewise he warned them that even he Paul could not change one word of what he had given by revelation. How important it is to hear the voice of God by way of his messengers and then say that what has been given them to say to the churches. Paul gave a revelation and he said in Galatians 1 says I gave I I gave you revel. God gave me re I didn't learn that from school. I didn't learn that from different but God gave me the revelation and the revelation that God God gave me that revelation I've been preached to you and based on that revelation I even myself I can't change that revelation &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; even other ministers comes and preach something against what I've preached to you let him be cursed &gt;&gt; he had the authority because he was the prophet for that age &gt;&gt; and no one could preach something beyond what he has preached even himself could not contradict what he has preached because he was not his thought. It was God thought. Amen. &gt;&gt; People can complain say but why you it looks like you are following a man. We are not following a man. We are following the word of God. Nothing else but the word of God. But God has a way to expand himself. He uses different gift to expand himself. And the gift of opening the word of God and making it clear to the people to a generation. God uses a prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we are so thankful for what God has done in our lives. &gt;&gt; Can't you see why I'm so happy? &gt;&gt; Because God has given me a prophet to open the word of God. Now the Bible has become a new book for me. It's not the book of history now. Now to the reality I see myself in the book of Ruth. I Ruth I see myself in the book of Joshua. I see myself in the in in the book of Esther. the world, the Bible has become a new book to me because of what God has given us in our time. &gt;&gt; But it goes on and says, "Every fresh and true revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age. The cry of every age is the rebuke you have left the word of God. Repent and come back to the word from the first book of the Bible, Genesis, to the last book of Revelation." There is only one reason for God displeasure leaving the word. And there is only one remedy to regain his favor is going back to the word because if you leave that word you leave you left you have left God that thus he's presenting himself to the church at Pgamus and indeed all churches of your I am the word. If you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word. Do you want deity among you? Do you want deity in your heart? Then welcome and receive the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give hospitality to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, the word of have have preminence in my house. &gt;&gt; Have pre have a seat there. What do you want the word? Oh, the word says, you know, I want this down. I want I don't want that thing to be out in your house. Take it out. I don't want these things to take too much of your time. Those play games and take it out a little bit. Is the word having preminence and you welcome the word. Oh, thank you the word. I receive you in my house. Amen. Amen. Don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This which I'm giving you, the word is a revelation of myself. I am the word. Remember, I wonder and the prophet says, I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst. Are we sufficiently impressed? Oh God, thank you for the word that you have given me or we take it just as a theory or knowledge based. But let it become a reality. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm doing a little bit of reading here but to make a background. So when a spirit born, spiritfilled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips. Why? That is the same as deity speaking. What I'm trying to say is to show you the importance is to raise the standard God has to follow a process. So God send his word. He send his word. He send his prophet. You receive the prophet and you receive a prophet in the quality of a prophet you will have the reward of a prophet &gt;&gt; and God has given us a prophet and the prophet the Bible comes to reveal the word of God and once you reveal the word of God people have to receive that word of God as you receive the word of God especially in our time especially in this time of the junction especially in this time where we have to go we will be going into rapture you need to receive the whole word not only a portion of the word but the whole word of God and welcome it in your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; As you receive the word of God, you are receiving deity among you. Amen. That is the same as de as you receive the word of God, it must not only stay on the stage of knowledge. Must not only stay in the knowledge of the mind, but you have to put it in your heart. &gt;&gt; Let that the word of God become reality in your heart. Once becomes reality on your heart as you speak the word of God is deity speaking. Amen. It's not a man speaking anymore. It's deity speaking. When you are saying by his stripes I'm healed. It's deity speaking. &gt;&gt; When you are saying my children will be saved is deity speaking. It's not your word is God's word through your lips. Amen. You become part of the word of God. You want dity among you receive the word of God. You want this to speak, speak the word of God because God is the word. The beginning was the word. God was with the word and our God is the word made flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The &gt;&gt; prophet says every mountain has to go. Satan cannot stand before that man. If the church way back there in in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the living word in their midst, the power of God would not have faded as it did in those days, in those dark ages. And right today, when the church returns to the word in faith, we can say without doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful act of God will be in her midst again. We have not received only a partial a partial interpretation or or or a man interpretation. We have received the perfect interpretation of the word of God with perfect vindication. We have received the whole word of God because we have received the whole word of God. Now the glory of God &gt;&gt; and the wonderful act of God will be among his people. We should be expecting God to work mighty among us, mightily among us because we have received the word of God, the whole word of God, not the partial word of God, not a reformation. It is the full restoration of the word of God restored to the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now there always two forces the forces of hell and the forces of heaven. I touched that on Wednesday. &gt;&gt; Those two forces are spirits and the spirit are working and and we see that very visible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the world. &gt;&gt; Oh no, someone full of things. How what's happening? Feel sorry for that person. Sometimes I take the traum and go downtown. So uh it breaks my heart. Oh why? Why? But the person is under certain anointing and the spirit just breaks my heart to see people in that situation. So if you could only know why to have the right mind &gt;&gt; and the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they wrapped up into a certain anointing a certain spirit is taking hold of them and they just go in that direction. But now put it in a positive way. Now they're under certain spirit. But now the bride is also under certain anointing. &gt;&gt; God can only work through the a spirit can only work through a body &gt;&gt; through a body. If the evil spirit is working through a body and they're doing those bad things, the Holy Spirit as well works through a certain body and is the body of the bride of Jesus Christ. So we have just to make ourselves available to the spirit to use us because God is looking for the bodies that can make vessels that can make themsel available and that God can use them in a mighty way. The word of God has to become flesh in the age that we are living. God wants the word of God to become flesh. He want himself to work through his bride. He is the word but he wants the word to become flesh in individuals. Not only stop at the knowledge stage, not only start intellectually, but becomes a reality, becomes flesh. I want to be the husband the word of God is talking about. I want to be the wife the word of God is talking about. I want to be the father the word is talking about. I want to be the deacon the word is talking about. In this last age, amen. I want to be the preacher the word is talking about. I want to be the a congregation member the word is talking about. Amen. A real one, total one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet, take the example of the first disciples. When the enemy comes in as a flag, I will raise up a stand against God will do it when all the gates of torment is pressing against that little church. Yet, it will never prevail. She will go right on. I think of the disciples in the early days when there are just a little handful of people with no education, no ability, earthly speaking. They had no degrees. They had they had no denomination behind them. They had nothing but one thing and that was that was the Holy Spirit that they had received on the day of Pentecost. That's why the Holy Ghost is very important. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't do it on your own. You can't you can try. You can try. You can try. You are bound to fail. But when the Holy Spirit comes and take control, that's when you start talking. Amen. That's when the reality of what God want is the Holy Spirit to take control. I'm tired of of trying to pretend. Even myself, I'm I'm try sometime I'm tired to pretend. I want I I don't want to pretend. I want the reality. If I don't have it, I don't have it. And I show that I don't have it. I want more. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you pretend, you you you you're trying to hide. You you're not realizing that you are lacking something because you are pretending. I don't want to pretend anything. If I don't have it, I don't have it. If I don't have, but at least I want lo. I don't have it. I want more, Lord. I want the reality. I want the Holy Ghost. I want a refilling of the Holy Ghost. I want a rebaptism of the Holy Ghost. More and more of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One brother was giving, I think it was in Winnipeg, one brother was giving a testimony. He says, "You know what? Brother Bam was was playing a tape a tape and then at the end of the tape, brother Bham said, those who want the Holy Ghost raise your hand." And and the pastor, he was a pastor. The pastor raised his hand. After service, people came, "Pastor, you don't have the Holy Ghost. How can you raise your hand?" And the prophet says, he says, "Yeah, I I believe I have the Holy Ghost, but I want more of the Holy Ghost. more and more of the Holy Ghost. Not just one feeling, but a refilling of more and more and more and more until I come to the stature of perfect man. That's what I've desire. I don't want to be stagnant and say, you know, now I'm looking for who? Raise a hand. Oh, you don't have the Holy Ghost. No God, I want more of the Holy Ghost, more of the reality, more of your life so that you can express yourself through me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. says and they hear him the same go that was really didn't finish it they had no denomination behind them they had nothing but one thing and that was the Holy Spirit that had received on the day of Pentecost they didn't need no more for God had already said upon this inspiration I will build my church why the ecclesiastic world of that day was well able to shut them out the great sahedron court wouldn't have turned them down if they had been standing on their own philosophy, on their own theology. They would have smoldered out in the beginning. But 1900 years has passed and the gates of hell still is against it. But she's moving on and will be moving on for Jesus said it cannot inspire that we'll take the rich man the poor man the beggar whoever he is and set them together and call each other brother and we who will worship the Lord together without shame shame shame faith fist fist fistness shamefacness if they could not conquer them. Think about it. Those fishermen if they could not conquer them, they tried to stop them. They tried different things. This is the first age. They try even to kill them. They tried different things, but they could not they could not quench that fire. They could not destroy. They could not destroy that. You know, sometimes you go through the trial, you feel like, you know, I'm this is too much for me. I'm done. I'm I'm at the end of heaven. But something keeps like brother say something keeps drawing you. Something keeps pulling you. Something keeps making you move further. It's that thing that God put inside of you that the enemy can never take away. &gt;&gt; That's something that that's the precious thing that God has put inside of you that can the devil can never take away. &gt;&gt; But God wants us to be raised again more and more. He want to raise that more and more. He wants So if you're going to a thing, don't just put your head down. say I'm more than a conqueror. I'm more than an overcomer through Jesus Christ. If they could not conquer them in the first age, the second age and all the other age, they could not conquer Luther in the age of of Saudis, they could not conquer him in our day, they can never conquer us. They will never conquer us. Sometimes I look at my children, I look in this age of iPad and different things and oh Lord be merciful on my children. Look at them. Their mind seems like just going through that that everything is just oh lord we were not raised up in those situations. I feel a little bit kind of this not human speaking like but then something just know you know what God has given us something that is more powerful than what the enemy is trying to put in there this year. No matter how much technology they put and everything there will be a bride. There will be an overcomer. There will be a generation that will be part of the resurrection. There will be a generation that will be part of the rapture. The enemy can never conquer the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. She is an overcomer and she will be an overcomer. Amen. Because God will give her the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is more than enough. Amen. To conquer anything that the enemy will report. &gt;&gt; When the enemy comes like a flood, God will raise up a standard. &gt;&gt; Amen. Prophet says, "Same Holy Ghost that saved the Lutterians, that sanctified the Methodist and baptized the Pentecostal is now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. It will be so powerful that body will come into this group, a church that will draw the rest of them from the grave. There will be a resurrection. That's what the Holy Ghost is for. What is the Holy Ghost? Without us, they cannot be made perfect. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They lived in one day. Under that, we live in another day. When the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit of God will raise the standard against it. We are in a day now. We are the last. We are in the day now. Now, put we are the last runners in God's plan. You know, the first one they have to run. They have to run to run. But now, we are the first the last one in that race. We are the one who will go with we will go entering into the millennium. We are the one who will be carrying the battle into the rapture. We will not be defeated. Amen. No matter what the enemy is putting, we are not going to be defeated. We'll keep pressing on. Actually, God is going to raise you as part of a standard. &gt;&gt; Says I'm raising the Holy Spirit, but that the Holy Spirit I'm putting in those individuals. No matter how weak they might appear, they will be my standard in the last age. Amen. They will be the one that will be waving say you see those ones. You see that bride in this time of laia. These are the standard I raised in that time of this year. When the enemy came as a flat I raised my sister. I say I raised that sister. I raised that sister. That brother &gt;&gt; that little girl in the school she was my standard there. &gt;&gt; She was the one that I could say oh this is the one I have I'm pleased to dwell in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. If they could not overcome Peter in those days generation, they cannot overcome in this generation. &gt;&gt; Because we are part of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are actually part of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The rapture cannot go without us. Amen. Because we are part of the rapture. They which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds. We are the one remaining. We be caught up into the rapture, man. Because the rapture, the prophet says when the bride will recognize who she is, the rapture will go. Why the rapture will go? Because you are the rapture. We are part of the rapture. We are part of the standard that God is raising in this generation. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We are the bride of Jesus Christ. Prophet says the way God is trying to do to his church is to beat till to beat it till it all the creeds and all the nonsense and all the world is beat out of it till it reflects back the life of Jesus Christ. Why you going through all this beating? Because God want to reflect what is inside of you. The quality that you have to reflect doesn't come from outside. The quality that's inside of you is already inside of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; The beauty of Jesus Christ that you have to reflect is not coming from the outside. It is already inside of you. &gt;&gt; It's going through some beating of the word of God. The word of God say have to beat you sometimes and beat you and beat you and beat you. But you say they thank God for beating me. Amen. Because you are reflecting. You are removing the things of the world so that I can reflect more of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Why is he talking upon that subject again? and he goes that's my weakness why is it on that don't comp don't have that attitude but rather say God thank you Lord &gt;&gt; for exposing that because you want me to reflect you more and more &gt;&gt; because you want me to show the character of Christ &gt;&gt; remember the church I've just come off the great meetings at home where the six seals and the sixes or seven seals or that sixth one was the purification of the church the church of course goes through the tribulation period for its purify ing the church will go through the tribulation period. But the bride is raptured is the difference between the bride and the church. &gt;&gt; We are don't want just to be the church. We are the bridemen &gt;&gt; because the church is preparing for tribulation. You know you see in the denomination they prepare for the tribulation. Oh, let's prepare the because great tribulation is coming and that the anointing upon them and it's okay because that the anointing but the bride is not preparing for the tribulation. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are going through our purification right now. The word of God is purifying us. The word of God is sanctifying us. The word of God is cleaning us. The Holy Spirit is washing us. Amen. The Holy Spirit is cleansing us, giving us the glory of Jesus Christ. Then be because we'll be part of the rapture. Amen. Prophet says, do you notice that the real church is supposed to do in the Old Testament when they had the sacrifice? They killed one bird and put the blood of one upon the other, the dead mate, and flew across the earth, spreading the blood of the of the dead mate. When the church becomes the real bride of Jesus Christ, she will carry the blood of Jesus Christ with her, sprinkling it upon the ground, calling holy, holy unto the Lord. Her atmosphere, every bit of her will be of God. Her whole makeup will be of God. You can't expect something nothing else because she's just part of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't expect nothing else. As the prophet says, one day there will come a blast from heaven and the dead in Christ shall rise first. The denomin testament saints came back wonder who were waiting will blast forth and come off of there come come out of there first and go into the resurrection. We'll drop right in line going in the sky. these old moral bodies, mortal bodies changed and made like unto this glorious body. What a parade that will be when it starts heaven word. Some of these days as the song leader says, "Oh, what a day that will be." Some of these days it will be that day for us. That's what we are looking for. We don't just come and have a church. We are getting ready for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, is my heart ready for the rapture? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of these days in that rapturing time that lays ahead oh proudly displaying the blood of Jesus Christ upon their chest the message of God in the hour that they have lived in. So the message of the hour in that we have received is the blood of Jesus Christ. You want to display the blood of Jesus Christ take the word of God receive it in your heart and display it in your life. That's the blood of Jesus Christ. Because even that day what will be displaying? It will be the message of God in the hour that we have received. The promise that you will be the manifestation in my note. The promise will be that you'll be the manifestation of the word despite what the enemy says of that you will be the manifestation. This is the only letter where God is not rebuking the church of God because she is the bride. She he him. You know, when the prophet took the the the letter and the Holy Spirit inspired him, take pick up the the pen and write. As he's writing that letter to the bride, it's the only letter of the messenger God gave to the messenger. That doesn't rebuke the church. It's not rebuking you. You're not saying see what you have done. You have you allowed Jezebel. You have allowed Bellam. You have allowed different things. No, he's not rebuking. He's not saying you are lukewarm. No, he's talking to the bride. He's telling you a love letter expression of what you'll be. Listen some of them what he's telling says the law of reproduction is that each specy brings forth after its own kind even according to Genesis 1:11 that God speaking to you. So God said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding sealed and the fruits tree yielding fruits of after this kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth as it was and it was so. Whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and dance into fruits. The very same law applies to the church today. Whatever seed started in the church will come forth and will be like the original seed because it is the same seed. In these last days, the true bride of church, Christ seed will come to the headstone and she will be the super church, a super race as she nears him. As you near the capstone, you become the super spiritual super race. They in the bride will be so much like him that you will even be in his very image. This is in order to be united with him. These are the words and expression that God is speaking to the church. Not to the church, to the bride. There's a difference between the church and the bride. God is speaking to the bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The bride is only the elect that can be part of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The church can be saved. They will go into the the tribulation, the last age. But the bride is the one that will go into the rapture. And we are part of the bride. &gt;&gt; So this in order to be united with him, they will be one. There will be the very manifestation of the word of the living God. Denominations cannot produce this. It's a wrong seed. They will produce their creeds and their dogmas. Mix it with the word. This this mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product. Then down then says from a little group of the true seed of the word, God will present Christ with a beloved bride. She's a virgin of his word. She's a virgin because she knows no man-made creeds of dogma by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled. All that was promised of God to be made manifest in the virgin. The God God's intention in this last age is to make the word of God become manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God has a plan with the bride. God in this bride coming of Christ, Christ doesn't just want he he want to work through you. I like what brother Chad said the other day as he expressed. It says you know what sometimes we want to become um we want to become God and God wants to become us. The intention the goal of God &gt;&gt; was so that God can become us. &gt;&gt; He he manifested it in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the full expression of God. &gt;&gt; The full revelation of God. &gt;&gt; How you want to see God? I want you to know God. If you want to see that you have to see it in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. But why he was not in a supernatural way like an angel as oh this is God in the form of an angel. The form an angel doesn't express God as God wanted to express. &gt;&gt; God want to be expressed as a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he put that as a Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ was the one that was the full expression of God. You want to know God? Look at Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But today you can't see Jesus Christ in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Now God want to manifest himself. What he put is Jesus Christ as an example. He was the first fruit to show that there will come many more in the field that will be like Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And now God wants you and I to be like Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in the man doing the job, doing your work, going to school and doing different things. The natural things that you do that's what God want to express himself in the natural things. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we want to be Christians only at church. Then you put your best robe, your best dress and everything. You hallelujah and everything and look like Christian. That's not the full expression of God. The full expression of God is back home in the school in the place where you are. You stand with the standard of the word of God showing who Christ is. That's God being expressed. Amen. That's God being manifested. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of course, we want people in the church. Of course, we'll come to the church. Jesus Christ was going to the church. &gt;&gt; It was even say form his habit to go to the church. It was not something forced upon him. It was natural things just to go to the church. That was Jesus God expression of God. &gt;&gt; He's going to church. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine Jesus Christ listening to to a preacher to a priest? &gt;&gt; He was not preaching all the time. Sometimes he stay in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. James tells for us that the body without the spirit is dead. For as the body without the spirit is dead. In the same way the Holy Spirit works through our bodies, God partners with his people to accomplish his will on earth. When God delivered Israel, he said, I am come down to deliver them. We touch on Wednesday. have come to deliver them. Come now, therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh." God coming down. But God couldn't finish the work without Moses. He needed Moses, a man to work through it. God comes down. Jesus Christ come down. The mighty angel comes down. Now, he needs you. He needs me to accomplish the work, to fulfill the work that was promised for the bride. He needs you. He needs me to do that. God, help us to make oursel available for you. Amen. That's the standard God wants. Isaiah proclaims when the enemy shall come that the scripture read the spirit of God shall lift out the stand against him. That standard is not only a banner but also God's people in his living witness. We are his chosen instrument to resist the devil that the enemy must flee. Amen. The prophet says in putting on the old hammer, God just brings his word more positive all the time. We don't have to refortify it and bring something else up. He makes his word more real all the time. The Bible said when the enemy and because that the spirit of God rais stand against it. When the enemy comes in like a flood and God fortification to his people to fortify them is the word of God. So he just raises the word a standard against him. But how God is raising the word is the enemy comes do you just present it and say no hey read? No it becomes your life. The enemy comes and say no now the word of God become flesh inside of you and say no God I stand upon the word of God &gt;&gt; I don't want to look on the negative thing I don't want to look the symptoms I stand upon the word of I see the enemy coming but I don't want to rely on my on my five senses I stand upon the word of God the Bible said so then you become the standard &gt;&gt; against what the enemy is bringing you become the one God is raising there's pressure at school one pressure school everybody's doing everybody's doing everybody's doing You don't just go say, "Hey, you put the word or the God take the word of God and and raise it." No, he raises you there. You stand, you know, the others are doing that. I'm not doing that because I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. I stand upon the word of God and I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; God raised you as a standard. &gt;&gt; You know, on the judgment, &gt;&gt; we read it. The word of God will be judging. Amen. &gt;&gt; But is it going to be just the word of God, the letter, &gt;&gt; or is it the saints will be judging? &gt;&gt; God will say, "You see that one went through the same pressure as you at school, the same pressure as you at school, &gt;&gt; but she stood for the word of God." &gt;&gt; And then that's the standard I raised on that time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you see, she can now give a testimony. Now she testifying about no I went through that and but God stood with me and by God's grace I stood upon the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you judge because the word of God became life inside of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Prophet says exposition of seven churches as he has cried out in this last age. You have the word. You have more Bibles than ever. But you are not doing anything about the word except dividing and hiking it into pieces. &gt;&gt; Taking what you want and leaving out what you don't. You are not interested in living it but debating it. &gt;&gt; Bibles are good. &gt;&gt; Bibles are good. But don't stop just at the letter. &gt;&gt; You have to be interested in living the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God wants the life of the word of God. Says you are not interested in living it but debating it. It will be it will it will soon know you were cold or hot. If you were cold or reject it will stand. If you could get white hot to know it truth and live it I will praise you for that. But when you simply take my word and don't honor it I in return must refuse to honor you. I will spew out of for he's talking about Leodia but we are the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that what Paul said? Do we begin again to command ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commandation to you or letters of commandation from you. You are our epistle written in our heart known and read of all men. For as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart. And such trust we through Christ to God word. Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our fish our sufficiency is of God who has also made us able ministers to the new testament not of the letters but of the spirit for the letter kid but the spirit give us life so we just put recommendations I'm this Paul and see Paul can you write can you speak properly and different things for say none of this but your life is a proof of my ministry &gt;&gt; amen Let our life put the proof of the ministry that we have received. Oh, I when we receive the revive, when the revival will come, when and no, don't put that in the future. Say, I'm the revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I'm what Bam spoke about. It's not about theology and even things you understand. Now look, if you want to see what he preach about, I'm the life. I'm the representation. I'm the revival. You want to see Christ manifest, I'm the one. Not in a bustful way but say God by God's grace I believe it and I want to be it. All my mistakes I want him to overcome them because I will he will never be defeated. &gt;&gt; That's what not a recommendation of a letter but Lord my life is a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful quote that we always read all the time but make it more real all the time. How we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices. The thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness, purity, undefiled lives, walking around in the earth today without a blemish. Yes, sir. Real Christians don't thunder against the enemy. The enemy don't care how loud you can holler. The devil don't care how much you can jump and how much you can do this or shout. But what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That holy life consecrated to God. &gt;&gt; Consecrated to God, &gt;&gt; Lord. Consecrate me to your service. Consecrate me more to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Consecrated to God. Say anything to him. Call him anything. You just as sweet as it can be. And move right on. Stay focused on Christ. &gt;&gt; Stay focused on Christ. Oh my. That throws him away. That's the thunder that shakes the end the devil just like oh well you say if I could preach like a Billy Graham or Hora Robert or somebody a great influ influential speaker. Oh no. Sometimes the devil just laughs at that. Says, "Oh, just want to put something on and look and everything, pretend and everything." No, he doesn't pay no attention to that then nothing. But you get all the theology and theology want to and all the seminary training and the devil just sit back and laugh at it when he sees that life. But when he sees that life, the little life of Jesus Christ, the token, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, then he's scared of that. is scared of that thunder. That's the most important thing, the life of Jesus Christ. John Baptist was not scared on how things went or the tomalt and the different things. He was the manifestation of the word of God for that hour. He knew what the scripture was talking about him. He knew his position upon the word of God. I'll be closing soon already. Let me finish where I want to go. He knew his position where he was standing. He knew his place. John the Baptist knew his position. You know, I'm the voice of I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness. He knew his place. The bride needs to know her position in the scripture. Because in order to have perfect faith, you need to believe what the word of God says about you and your your position in the word of God. Not look at your failures. You look at what the word of God says and you stay focused on the word of God &gt;&gt; and being interested in living God's word. Amen. Have faith in what the word of God says you are. The prophet says, "Have faith in what the word of God says you are." Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was. It is written of me. Malachi 4 is written about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your heart, my heart will be changed. &gt;&gt; My heart will be changed. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I don't know. But as as I'm feeding upon the word, as I'm staying in the channel of the word of God, I'm staying in the channel of reading the word message or praying, God is changing my heart. God is purifying my mind. God is changing my heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the word of God says, I'm part of the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John writes to Jesus, "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us." Jesus said to himself, "I'm the light of the world." You know that what is the light? Prophet will give an explanation. The light is the manifestation of the word of God. As long as it's still the word is not light yet. But when that word becomes manifested, then it is the light. &gt;&gt; Let the light, let the light be, that was not the light yet. But when that word become manifest, the sun comes out, it becomes physic. Oh, now it is the light because the word of God made manifest. Now the word of God says you are the light of the world. How can you be the light of the world? The word of God for your age now become a manifested. Now I am the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I am the word of my age being manifested. Amen. You can't manifest the light in the time of previous ages. It won't work. You have to be the light of the word in your age that you have received. The end time messenger and message should meet with end time conditions. &gt;&gt; Don't you think so? This message could not have been preached 40 years ago or 100 years ago or before. No, the end time message and messenger has got to meet back there in them days. They had it probably wouldn't have not worked. You know that you have been predestinated for this age. If you were in the other age, you may may be struggling. But God ordained you to be in this age. You have been ordained. No matter how that I said at the beginning, I'll repeat myself again. No matter what laia is putting upon us, we are predestinated to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we have been ordained to be overcome in this age. Back then, them days they had it probably wouldn't have not worked. But it's got to cope with end time conditions. Be converted. Believe the gospel signs that the message of today wash your souls in the blood of the lamb and believe the gospel that the end time signs are here. The seed of the gospel has been taking place. Amen. That's why this message was waiting for the end time conditions. It was waiting for the end time sodomite conditions. You were predestinated to meet the sodomite conditions. But as we see the sodomite conditions, so the revelation of the son of man is prevailing as well. Why? because it was meeting the end time conditions. The word of Moses time did not work in the days of Jesus time. No, the word in the days of the apostles does not work in these days. It's a promised word for this day. They say themselves and spoke it by the Holy Ghost. What will take place in the last days? How the churches will be heady, high-minded, how the roar, the war will rise up and the harlots will be right with her. They will take on the hedge and the last age and the loudia. Jesus will be completely taken from the church. The prophet goes on. But that's the message of that age could not work in our days. &gt;&gt; Like brother Herald used to put the illustration says when that on that day on the rapture on the other side every age will be passing. Oh the first age comes. Oh. Oh these are the age of Ephesis. Oh really? That's why you had to fight and everything. You see when the heresy was coming you see how you fought and oh then the second age dark ages have come. Oh, how could you stand that there would be murder m killing you and you was just willing to go through that? What happened to the it was not us. It was the anointing upon us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God prevail in our house because when the enemy comes, God send another anointing to overcome until they come to the last age. &gt;&gt; L to the age of Luther. Lut how could you how could you overcome that powerful the powerful religion the Catholic system? It was not me. It was just the anointing upon me. &gt;&gt; And then the last age will come on. You were in the loudest year age &gt;&gt; really with internet and &gt;&gt; artificial intelligence and and and Facebook and WhatsApp and talk tick tock talk Instagram and all the different things. We can't keep up of all those things. What happened to you? Mhm. &gt;&gt; How did you prevail? Oh, it was not us. It was the eagle anointing upon us. God sent the eagle anointing to give us overcoming powers. That's why we made it. Amen. And God use us as we yield oursel to him. God use us to bring the standard higher, higher, not lower, higher and higher and higher. We shall prevail again. &gt;&gt; God bless you richly. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [Music] Amen. Let's sing that one. We are conquerors over in this time. We will be victorious through the blood of Jesus Christ. [Music] We made more than over [Music] glorious through the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Was that that song that he s I feel the pool. But the other the other song that something keeps holding me. Something is holding me. Yeah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. And everything I see is telling Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. is a reality. Something keeps falling. Something keeps me [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. He's got me [Music] [Music] a reality for something. Sisters, can you help us on verse one? The tri and stronger. [Music] The more I felt was more than I could bear. And I was on the verge.

The music is playing softly in this time of junction. different things but God just want you to focus upon him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you know sometimes can be nervous and different things happening. You feel like you have been trying yourself on your own. You have the impression that you are not an overcomer. You try and you fail. You try and you fail. Sometimes you make a decision. You feel like you are determined and and then it works for a few days and after that you feel like again like you go back again to the whole habit feel like you and you you have lost trust in yourself and and the devil comes on top of that. So you feel like you're a Christian but you are just a hypocrite. You know you you you just pretending. But how many can just say you know Lord &gt;&gt; I just want to surrender myself to you. You promised that you'll raise the standard not myself. You promised &gt;&gt; just one Lord to heal myself to the anointing of the age to the word of God. As the prophet says, the only thing you need is just to love him to love him more and to take all the frustration away if you just tell him the Lord I love you. You know I love you. I have my mistakes but I love you. But Lord, today I want to yield myself more to you and God you will take over. Just raise your hand to him and he knows your need. He knows your situation you're going through. Just express to him something keeps holding me. And the prophet went through trials. He say it was not my was not me keeping the religion. I was not trying but it was that religion as you call it religion but it was that reality of God that kept me moving. It was not me holding but it was him holding me and that's what I just want to hold his hand. His unchanging hand something keeps holding me. Talk to him. talk to the Lord as I'll be praying for all of you and my son. Father Lord, we thank you once again Lord presence this morning. Jesus Christ has just quoting the word of God that will never fail that will never be defeated by the word of God will defeat the enemy anytime under any circumstances any place anywhere. Father that's the word of God I have proclaimed Lord because you have given the promise to your bride to the elect that should be an overcomer Lord Jesus Christ no matter the weaknesses we come to you that Lord through the Holy Spirit to strengthen your people to walk with them Lord Jesus Christ you have the preminence in our life Lord let the Holy Spirit raise the standard in our life Lord through the trials that will have the victory in Jesus Christ through the weaknesses that you oh God you will overlook over that and give them the power of the Holy Ghost to quench father the fire of the enemy and to give them Lord the liberty and the spirit of Christ Lord may their Lord Jesus Christ walk with you as a victorious standing on the promises of God claiming Lord the position that you have given them in the land Lord you say that you fulfill your word the manifestation of the word of God to the bride in this last age you will not finish the whole work when you came the first time.
