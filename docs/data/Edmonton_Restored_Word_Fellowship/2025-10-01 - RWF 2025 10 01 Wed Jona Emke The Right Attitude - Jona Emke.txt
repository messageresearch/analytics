TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the same way. &gt;&gt; And I've been preaching a series and I'm not going to preach on that, but this is a little Wednesday night thought after I preached three uh services on emotions. getting your mind, your thoughts, and your emotions under the control of God. &gt;&gt; See, we as believers shouldn't be high on the mountain &gt;&gt; and down in the valley the next day and up and down, up and down. That just shows that you that you don't know the Lord. That's just shows that when you're down in the valley, you don't trust the Lord. And when you're high on the mountain, you think it's you, you know, and it's not. It's not me on the mountain. It's not me in the valley. It's God &gt;&gt; teaching me. It's God shaping me &gt;&gt; to help his bride. And every one of us is a worker. Like just because a pastor, he's not he's not the kingpin. He's just the one pointing you to &gt;&gt; the word. He's pointing you to the the word of God and where to find your answers, where to find the strength that you need to carry on. &gt;&gt; So tonight, I want to talk about a little thought that the Lord placed on my heart and it's right attitude. The right attitude, you know, and I'm taking it from uh Joshua 14 6-14. And you know, when you think about it, two million people left Egypt. Thank you very much for playing Peter, brother Peter, brother Gan. I just met them tonight and I'm I was talking to them and I feel like I've known them for a long time already. &gt;&gt; But you know, they two million people left Egypt. They all walked. They all seen the pillar of fire. They ate the mana. Every day they had the cloud over them. God God give them a little shade during the day and the pillar of fire at night as protection, as a sign that he was there for them and with them. And here they were. And you'd think that with that kind of presence, with that kind of presence of the Lord there during the night, during the day, and the mana they received, that you would think there would be no doubt about it that they would cross that Jordan and take the promised land. There would be no fear about anything. &gt;&gt; And yet only two of them had the faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true. And you know, I'm I'm I'm looking at us as message people and I don't know, I think 69 is probably the year that a lot of that Canada kind of turned to the message. That was the year I mean my dad was uh in brother Bram's meetings here in Edmonton and Grand Prairie, Dozen Creek and in Regina and and uh and he he was following the prophet. But I know we were listening to tapes in our little place in Valiview, Alberta here. And so I'm an Alberta boy. So, but you know 69 is when when a kind of a move through Canada came and they had the first camp meeting at Moose Lake. And we should be so much further ahead &gt;&gt; in my opinion. You know, we should be going over That's right. &gt;&gt; But you know, God is is is uh he wants us to have the right attitude. There's a few that have that have come back and and shown us what you know and I would say there the 12 spies or there was 12 preachers that went over to the and and got the thing and there was two of them that came back that had the fruit that that had and said, "Yes, we can. We are more than able." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are more than able. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, where are we tonight? &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Let's open the word. &gt;&gt; Let's pray before we open this word and just ask him to come. Lord, I just thank you tonight. Lord, brother Moses, brother Zeg here, encourage me, Lord, to take this service. And Lord, I just want to say, Lord, you are the one. It's your word that we're dividing. Lord, it's not mine. Lord, I'm nothing. I'm just a little and like to remind myself every day I'm a little bit of dust. That you had Lord Jesus the mercy, the grace. We sang about amazing grace. the grace that came and Lord you entered into this little bit of dust and you Lord delivered this piece of dust from all the sins and things of the world and and brought me into thy presence Lord and showed me Lord Jesus thy truth and Lord you gave me Lord the confidence to take thy word and hold to thy word no matter what the circumstances and Lord I say tonight come into our little fellowship here tonight, Lord. Impart the word to everyone, Lord. Every one of us, Lord. Maybe somebody here tonight needs a little chicken or a little beef, Lord, or needs a little gravy or or Lord, whatever it is they need, Lord. Give it to them, &gt;&gt; Lord, through thy word, through the gift that you have placed in thy body, Lord, that they might be strengthened, encouraged, Lord Jesus, corrected, whatever it is they need, Lord, to come into your presence and to have the right attitude to take the body change. Lord, we know we're coming to that place. We know, Lord, that it could happen at any time, Lord. And I will say, Lord, I need it already. I would like to have a body change, Lord. I feel, Lord, I'm getting older every day, Lord. A little weaker, a little more feeble, but Lord, I know that you are still with me. &gt;&gt; And Lord, I want to be a Joshua. I want to be a Caleb, Lord. Oh Lord, that their strength was not abaded, Lord. It was there still. And Lord, they took that land and they took that mountain. And Lord, I thank you for your loving kindness. Touch us tonight by thy spirit. hear our cry in Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Joshua 14:6, it says, "Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jeffunath the Kenzite, and said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses, the man of God, concerning me, and thee in Kadesh Barnea." 40 years old was I when Moses, the servant of the Lord, sent me from Kadesh Barnea to Espy out the land, and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart. Nevertheless, my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt. Look at &gt;&gt; some can make your heart melt actually take faith from you &gt;&gt; and some can give you faith. Oh my. And he said, "But I wholly followed the Lord my God." &gt;&gt; And Moses swore on that day, saying, "Surely the land whereon thy feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance, and thy childrens forever, because thou hast wholly followed the Lord thy God." Holy. Holy is what he needs us to follow him &gt;&gt; not partially &gt;&gt; but with a whole heart. And now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he said these 40 and five years. Ever since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness. Now lo, I am this day four score and five years old. And as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me. As my strength was then, even so is my strength now for war, both to go out and to come in. Now therefore, give me this mountain whereof the Lord spake in that day. For thou heardest in that day, how the Anakims were there, and the cities were great and fenced. If so be, the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said. If the Lord is with you, &gt;&gt; there's nothing can stand before you if the Lord is with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of Jeffunith Hebron for an inheritance. He therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jeffuna the Kenzite unto this day because that he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. And may God in his blessing to his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we know that what attitude is. Attitude is a feeling or a way of thinking that affects a person's behavior. &gt;&gt; And you know when we read this here, we see that Joshua and Caleb had the right attitude. and God because of their right attitude, their strength didn't go down. Even though they were from 40 to 85, they were still as strong as they were when they were 45. &gt;&gt; So, Caleb had the right way of thinking. &gt;&gt; He believed that what Moses said was true because he believed it was the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, and we've been given a word of God for this day. And if we believe it's true, then you know what? Then we have the same power behind that word that he had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same power is there because the word is as strong as it was in 63 as it is in 2025. It's the same word, the same power, the same Lord, the same Jesus, and the same, should I say, we have we have a um a predestination. We h we are the seed of God that was in the presence of the Lord before the foundation of the world. So it is the same word in us that can take this body change. &gt;&gt; That is why Joshua and Caleb kept their strength and possessed the promised land. Caleb possessed Hebron because he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel. They believed what the angel of the Lord told Moses. And I got this thought from watching a YouTube about a man in Israel that has he's an Israelite who's went into the West Bank area and he's claimed Hebrron. He has claimed he's a single man. He has claimed Hebrron and he is throwing the Palestinians out of their homes and out of their land and he's taking possession of it because he said this is our land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what? And and you know uh uh you can listen to the narrative from the Palestinian side and you can listen to the narrative from the Jew side and if we take the Lord's side whose side are we on? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whose side are we on? So, you know what? I tell you, you know, I tell you, war is war, and war is not I I mean, I know I came from uh parents that went through the Second World War, so I know what war is &gt;&gt; and I know it's it's not good to anybody. It's not good for the victor. It's it's it's it's look at the PS the P PTSD and all that that's in in the victors and even in the losers. It it's just war is is is not what God made us for. &gt;&gt; But he equips his and and you know we as believers we don't fight with with flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; And I think sometimes we have the thought that we have to do it flesh and blood. So we get into politics to try to change the church, &gt;&gt; you know, instead of getting on our knees and getting the presence of the Lord behind us &gt;&gt; and holding to God's word and saying, "God, change that pastor." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I tell my my my church all the time, pray for this pastor. This piece of flesh here needs the presence of the Lord to mold his heart, right? to bring the right thoughts from him, to bring the right attitude to him &gt;&gt; because you know what where you have your thoughts dwelling is how you're going to react. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So I always uh you know my wife has said to me some how can you how can you talk to those people like that after what they said to about you or to you? And I say, "Honey, when somebody has been critical &gt;&gt; and negative, it's because he's been feeding on that negative critical accuser of the brethren. He's been feeding from that trough." &gt;&gt; True. But when you feed from the sweet precious anointing that flowed through Aaron's from his head to his toe and in the holies of holies, I'll tell you what, it's a completely different attitude. &gt;&gt; You know, it's victory. It's it's victory even when it looks like defeat. It's victory to you. &gt;&gt; And so I just want to say, you know, let's let's get the right attitude. Brother Brandham says, "And speak to the rock and it shall give forth his water." He says in 1960, he says, "Joshua fought every inch of ground from one end of the country to the other one." But he had a promise. God said, "I'll give it to you." &gt;&gt; And what did God say in to us in this day? I will give it to you if you will only believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only believe. All things are possible. That is something we heard every service. Every tape you put on, &gt;&gt; you hear it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether there's giants, whether there's atheists, whether there's infidels, whether there's cold formal churches, what difference does it make? God gave the promise. Let's take it. It's ours. It belongs to us. It's our possession. Let's go get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I want to do. I want to get it. I want to take my body, new body. I want to get it. I don't want to look left or right. I don't want to know what they're doing in Siri. I don't know what they're doing in Edmonton. But I want to know in Colona that God is there. &gt;&gt; And I know that he's here, too. If you're looking to him, he's here, too. And he wants to lead you. He wants to guide you. He wants to be inside you. He wants to give you the victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you got to what? Keep your heart and mind stayed on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at what it says in Exodus 23 to uh 23-2 and and and 23. It says, "For mine angels shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the Amorites and the Hittites and the paris parizzites par and the Canaanites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, and I will cut them off. Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works, but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images, and ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he shall bless thy bread and thy water, and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. &gt;&gt; Now, I just want to show you what that means to us. &gt;&gt; It means don't follow the dominational system. &gt;&gt; Amen. That means don't even go after their seminars, their thinking, but stay in the word. Stay in his channel. Don't look and see, oh, it worked over there. Oh, this is working. You know what? Stay in your channel because God has a different gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For every one of us. He's He's got a Moses here. He had a Zigg here before. Now he's got a Moses here. And Moses has got a little different channel. He's got to go his way that God has shown him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, and you've got to get behind him or go change your church. It's up to you. &gt;&gt; But you've got to get behind him and say, "Lord, I believe if brother Moses is put here for you put him here, then help me support him. Help me back him and everything in me go &gt;&gt; and do the thing." And I'll tell you what God will work. Because you know what really going to church is all about? Submission. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; It's submission. And God didn't say make Mo Brother Moses your head. &gt;&gt; No, he said make the word your head. &gt;&gt; This is our head. &gt;&gt; This is what we've been restored back to, &gt;&gt; the word of God. So if the word is our head, all what brother Moses is doing is bringing you to the word to show you &gt;&gt; this is what God has laid out. This is what he wants you to follow. This is how he wants you to do it. And let's just walk. &gt;&gt; You know what? Like brother Brown talks about the sheep when he was in the east. He said, you know, it was a it was a a a a great big uh garden bizaar or whatever, you know, a market, he said, and the sheep just followed the shepherd right through. They didn't nibble. They didn't go here. They didn't go there. They just went right through. They listened to the shepherd. &gt;&gt; And you know what is it? It is It is submitting to God to the one that he's put you under. &gt;&gt; You know, I've had people say, "Oh, I'd like to move to Colona." And you know, I would love to say move. But I always tell them, listen, you better make sure it's God's will. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because if you get there and it's not God's will, it's never going to work for you. That's right. &gt;&gt; First of all, you're going to be mad at the preacher all the time because he's going to be he's going to be correcting you. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; You know, he's like, and I've said like I've had some of my congregation tell me the last couple years, you're very rude, brother John. &gt;&gt; I says, it's only rude if you can't take correction. &gt;&gt; Then it's rude. But if you receive the correction that God gives, you take it and you say, "Lord, help me." And just walk on with the Lord. But it's rude if you don't want correction. &gt;&gt; It's rude if you can't take it. But you know what God said to me when when I, you know, after I was eight years a pastor, my dad couldn't do it anymore. And he was three years with a stroke and he couldn't read, he couldn't couldn't speak. And so and then God told me preach not like a salesman because I was a salesman all my life. I I'm a salesman and I was a good salesman. I love to sell. I love people and I love I still love people but I love to give them the gospel now. And it's you know what it's the the the hardest cell I've ever had is the gospel. But it's the only thing that I've ever sold that's free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's absolutely free. And it's and it's lasts longer than a car and a suit. &gt;&gt; I can tell you last way longer &gt;&gt; and it's eternal. And it'll change your life. It'll give you victory. It'll heal your body when you're sick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll deliver you. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know it's the hardest cell because you have to submit to God. You have to say, "Lord, I need you now." That's one of my favorite songs right now. Do you guys sing it here? &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. &gt;&gt; How many can say that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham goes on to say, Joshua and Caleb knowed what God had said, so they believed it. See, they knew what God had said, and they believed it. Now notice in the 29th verse, he said, "I will drive them all out in one year, unless the beasts of the field multiply against you and come against you, but little by little will I drive them out. Just as you're able to possess the land, I'll drive them out." There you are. The angel of the covenant, 1954. So what is it? It's the right attitude. The two and a half million could have had the same attitude that Joshua and Caleb had. They all saw the same things, ate the same mana, watched God drive the inhabitants from the land. They were all baptized in the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; What it says in Hebrews, &gt;&gt; they had a or or Corinthians, I should say, they had the same witness, the same miracles, the same signs, but they just didn't get it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; What is it? You know, I to me I just can't believe that people could have been listening to the message for 40 years and then forsake the message and say the prophet's wrong when the miracles and signs and wonders and everything that has been done and and were there and all that and all of a sudden just to say no is wrong and he's not the prophet of this day. You know what it just shows you that just like the children of Israel they followed Moses. They followed him for 40 years. They followed the prophet for 40 years and they couldn't take it. &gt;&gt; Why is it the Bible says and Paul says because of unbelief &gt;&gt; and not one of them will make it. &gt;&gt; They are in utter darkness because of the witness they had. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll tell you what, today I we've gone too far to turn back. &gt;&gt; We've gone way too far to turn back. So, how do we get the right attitude? &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted. &gt;&gt; Don't get your eyes off of Jesus. You know, Colossians chapter 3, verses 1-4, my favorite passage of scripture. Keep your attention on Jesus &gt;&gt; because when he appears, you'll appear with him. &gt;&gt; You see, so it's who you look to &gt;&gt; and don't get angry. Don't get mad at your brother. Don't get disappointed in your brother. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're in the flesh. &gt;&gt; You know what? And and and sometimes, look at I I I I've been I've been preaching about Joseph. Look at how he had to be persecuted by his own brothers in order to get him to Egypt. &gt;&gt; And God sometimes persecutes us by message people &gt;&gt; to get us to the right place so he can save the people that were persecuting you. &gt;&gt; So, you know what? We've got to be careful. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, I I always say this and and and and brother um uh Peter there was tell talking to me about a brother that we used to come to my church and and I remember talking about him with my dad and and he was a a brother that uh that he was, you know, he was um up and down up and down. And so my dad said something once and he said, you know, he said, "I don't know about that, brother. I think there's something wrong with him or whatever." And you know, uh, he said he went to prayer and God said, "Why are you talking like that about?" One of my, &gt;&gt; you know what that just shows you? Somebody might not be living right. Somebody might not have the victory yet, but he's God's. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, so I I I I'll tell you what, it's really checked me to make sure that I don't say something about one of God's children because I don't I I can't see into anybody's heart. And how many times have we loved somebody and really loved them and then found out what a disappointment they were because they've they've they've turned out that they fell away and and completely rejected the message and gone. &gt;&gt; And you realize that you know what? You you thought this guy was in you thought this guy was something special, right? But you know what? God only sees the heart. God knows what's right inside. &gt;&gt; But faith is a gift from God. See, faith is a gift from God. The seed of God in you is Godplaced. It's not you didn't place it. God swed it and it fell in good ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is why you know we we it's a gift. And when you see God do something, if you don't praise him for it and worship him for it, you can't build or grow your faith. &gt;&gt; And that's what I find so u why people are so up and down. &gt;&gt; If you look at that message that brothers, why are people, you know, why are they tossed about? Why? because because they don't thank God for the things that he's given and the things that he's done for them and and they they just can't seem to worship him enough. And I say, you know what? If you really want to get into the presence of God, don't cry out for your need. Worship him. &gt;&gt; Worship him. That's what brings the power of God down. I can remember 1972 [Music] in South Edmonton here. Ziggclaw, Anita Clar, my parents, we were kneeling in their living room praying and the presence of the Lord came down, you know, tongues and interpretation and it was just the the moving of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Well, it wasn't it wasn't crying out for need. was just worshiping God. &gt;&gt; And I find that, you know, there's a song that says whatever, worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever worship. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, if we would just come, you know what worship means? Look up the meaning. &gt;&gt; It means excessive, not ordinary praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Excessive. So I'm just wondering did you come here tonight and were you excessive in your worship? &gt;&gt; That's what worship means. It means it means not ordinary, not regular, but excessive. &gt;&gt; And I think that's that's what God wants from us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what God wants from us. The more you reason things out, the less likely you're going to attribute that to God. For the devil will steal the word and his humility from you. That's what the devil does. He's He's so good at coming in when when you've had God's done something, coming in and stealing the victory and making you think negatively. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's his job. And I'll tell you, he's good at it. &gt;&gt; And if you allow your flesh, see, that's to come. We have to become superhuman. &gt;&gt; That's to come. We've got to not dwell in our feelings, but dwell on the word. And when you dwell on the word, you see the victory. You see the healing. You see the deliverance. You see what God has promised and you go for it. Like Joshua and Caleb, they didn't look at the giants. They didn't look at the walls. They didn't look at at at their their un inability to fight a war like the rest of them. They looked at God's promise. They believed God. They seen that God carried them. And away they went and took the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at it says proving his word 1964 uh paragraph 112. And the general went out and picked him out a man out of each tribe and they took off. He took Caleb, his side buddy, because he knowed Caleb believed. See, that's what God does. He picks a believers. And they went over into the promised land and came back with a bunch of grapes that even two men took that taken two men to pack. Say, he said, "Now, so that Israel will have the evidence before they even get into the promised sea. They'll have the evidence that God said it's a good land." See, God gives us the evidence &gt;&gt; that we're going to have a body change. You know, you know what the evidence is? I'll tell you what, 34 years, 7 months, he gave me the evidence. From death unto life, &gt;&gt; from a death sentence and he healed me. I was dying and he changed it and brought me back to life. That was evidence that he can do the body change. That was the evidence to me that he is there. He's able. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's doing it. &gt;&gt; And all that I said and and you know, if you ever want to the God who answers prayer, if you ever want to go on on on on.org, the God who answers prayer, my testimony is on there. &gt;&gt; And I went to the with brother Steve and and brother John Andy's. And I was in at the fair in Lyndon. And I'll tell you what, what a what a a a moving of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I love, you know, I I I'm off track here, but I I just have to bring this in. I love the attitude. It wasn't here, you got to accept the prophet for the day. It was we believe in a God who still answers prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, you want a living God. Well, then come. We'll we'll introduce you to him. We'll show you what his what faith in God is according to the fathers of our faith. You see, that's what how we got to bring the gospel to the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, we're going to bring it to the faith of our fathers because it's been restored to us because God has answered our prayer. God has met us in the hour of our need. &gt;&gt; And look what he says here. And it's a good land. See, they'll have the evidence. It's a good It's filled with milk and honey. It's a grand land. It's a good land. Now, all this old garlic gleak and whatever you got here in Egypt, now we're taking you to a land with milk and honey. You'll probably never tasted either one, milk or honey down there in Egypt all these years. They just give you the slaves rationing. But now you're going to this land. So just at the time they got in about one day's journey where Kadesh Banira, the great judgment seat of the world was they stopped under these great palms out there, the springs encamped. He said now to let the people know, watch what a perfect, what a real perfect evidence it is how God does that just as he does today. God said the land is great. Now before you go over, I want you to see the land is great. So go bring me back some evidence of the land and show it to the people. And you know I believe God is giving us evidence every service, every Wednesday service, every Sunday service that God is going to bring a body change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is going to bring it. He's going to bring cuz the the word is the same. You got to believe it and you can receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, you can be in a group of 300 people or a group of 15 or 20 as as many as we got here. And you know, if you are a believer, you receive something tonight. &gt;&gt; If you are a believer, you'll take his word and you'll say, "God, you've revealed it. I believe it." And thank you for your encouragement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all. That's all it takes. Look at there was two in amongst two million. &gt;&gt; You they could have been disappointed. They could have given up and said, "Well, I guess we can't do it then if there only two of us." No, no, no, no, no. They said, "If we got to go ourselves, &gt;&gt; if we got to go ourselves." &gt;&gt; And look at look at what God did in Jericho. Look at Rahab. She says, "We're quaking behind these big walls, behind our chariots, behind our trained soldiers. We're shaking." Why? Because God wiped out Egypt on the way there. God God took care of all those kings on the way there. Well, well, see, we don't know. The devil wants us to think negatively. &gt;&gt; He wants us to think scared. And the devil, his people are scared. These people have power and the devil wants you to think scared. So, you know, we've got the victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's with let's get the right attitude and take the victory. &gt;&gt; Look, our prophet in this day heard from the Lord and he had and he had he's been he was rejected as a prophet &gt;&gt; of God because he condemned every denomination. See, that's he was a friend to every denomination until he started to tell them, "You're deceiving the people. &gt;&gt; You are not preaching the word. You're preaching traditions. You're preaching creeds. You're preaching everything but the word of God." See, that's when they didn't want nothing to do with him. That's when they rejected him. That's when they said, "You know what? I heard I heard Copelan say just just uh he had a they had a big conference and they were talking about all these great generals of God and and he says, "Yeah, you know, Brother Brandham visions and oh, I was in his meetings." He said, "But they wanted to be teachers." He should have stuck with the prophetic. &gt;&gt; And I love what brother Brandham says. How can I teach them the prophetic gifts if they don't know the ABCs? If they don't obey God, how are you going to get anything? &gt;&gt; That's what God did. He He look at what Israel's back in their land today and they were sent all over the world because they failed to obey God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because they had the power. Look at Solomon, the greatest kingdom ever. &gt;&gt; And the Palestines don't take that evidence of Solomon. Oh, they don't want to hear it. That's why they don't want any archaeology there. They don't want you to dig up anything because you're going to find out that it was the children of Israel's land. Amen. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; See, he he preached against every denomination. They had forsaken God's word to follow their own ways contrary to the word of God by claiming they are doing it for Jesus Christ's sake. Anything done for his sake has to be word on word. And even today, I see the message. I I see little things coming. I see that we want to get back to the manifestations of flesh. You know what? I love spirited singing. I love moving. But that's not a sign of evidence of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Speaking in tonesues, you know, the devil can speak in tonesues. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And and it and it's correct. I mean, brother Bram said he went to Mishawaka. He said one man was just a just he was just a there was ever a a man, you know, he was he was an adulterer &gt;&gt; and and and interpreting and speaking in tongues and and the other one was a real saint and and a real seed of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. See, when the anointing like and I I I use this all the time and I'm I'm at a new church, so I can do this, you know, I can take this water and I can just you can you say you were anointed, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You can say I was anointed. The faith anchored. &gt;&gt; The faith anchored. &gt;&gt; The faith took hold. &gt;&gt; So we have to examine our ways right now. Are we coming to the final days of our journey here on earth where the coming of the Lord is very night at hand? Even if the whole world repented tonight, right now, we lose this earth beyond redemption unless it is cleansed by holy fire. We if every person repented and sought the Lord, it's we're we're too far gone. &gt;&gt; We need the holy fire of God. It's like brother Ram says that earth isn't going to be annihilated. It's just going to be cleansed by God's fire. See, it's going to have to be brought back to its original state. And when you look at it today, it seems the earth is without form and void &gt;&gt; spiritually. And darkness is upon the whole face of the deep. And darkness is upon the whole earth. There's darkness. Wherever you look, there's darkness. Why? Because they refused the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and it divided this the light and the darkness. And God came in this day to bring light to us. And the ones that receive light will have light. The rest of them are still in darkness. They're under the the darkness, pitch darkness, and they can't and they don't have any form and they've losing their minds. God spoke, formed everything, and when he comes and speaks judgment, he's going to cleanse everything. Now, we need to bring ourselves to his presence and be cleansed and take every possession we are entitled to take. And as Caleb took Hebron, as he desired it to be his, he took it and was successful because he received the word of the angel that promised it for him. Wherever your feet are, you shall possess the land. And I'll say today, we can possess the complete fullness of God tonight. If we will say, Lord, it's mine. &gt;&gt; Lord, it's mine. I don't know how you're going to do it, Lord, but I'm I am submitting. See, we got to bring ourselves into submission to the word of God and God will take control of it. &gt;&gt; See, if we can submit ourselves, it means humble ourselves, that means that we can we can take and allow God to lead us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he might use brother Moses. He might use Brother Zeg. He might use I should know that brother over there. I forget his first name. &gt;&gt; Dan Stewart. &gt;&gt; Stewart. Peter, go Moses, Philip. He can use anyone &gt;&gt; by the spirit to bring you correction. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; bring you into the word, lead you further. But we have to be able to take that and and you know, you say, "Well, I I just don't want to listen to anybody, brother Jonah. I I I just don't want to be deceived. I had somebody say to me, "Well, that's why I only listen to tapes because then I then I'm not going to be deceived." Well, you know what? I'll tell you what. If you've taken if you only listen to tapes, then you're not doing what the tape said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And unfortunately, who hears the voice of the prophet is the one who obeys the prophet. &gt;&gt; That's who hears. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the one who just hears. &gt;&gt; The the the doers of the word are blessed, &gt;&gt; not the hearers, &gt;&gt; but it takes the hearing of the word to receive faith in order to become a doer of the word. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But we've got to, you know, and I don't discount them. I I'll tell you, I don't discount those people because I just believe that God's got to give them life to show that you know what, you need a pastor because there are things that happen in the world. There's things that are that are taken place since the prophet has left that we need a pastor. Who you going to who's going to baptize you? You need a pastor. &gt;&gt; I mean, there's people getting married by the prophet with, you know, and they're doing that. I mean, it's just it it seems to me like idol worship. &gt;&gt; It seems to me like idol worship. &gt;&gt; Cuz we're looking at a man and and he's our like if if Brother Bram's your pastor, you're an idol worshipper &gt;&gt; because God needs live pastor. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He needs a live pastor. That That's my my opinion &gt;&gt; and I believe it's according to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let me just end with this because usually I'm a half hour preacher, brother. And that's that's all I do on Wednesday. Look, we are at the Jordan River, the same as Israel was. They had journeyed for 40 years circling till all the original ones leaving Egypt had died except for Joshua and Caleb. The rest didn't trust that God had spoken to Moses, you see, and couldn't go over. They perished never to ever enter into God's rest. And you might say, "Well, they followed him for 40 years. They must have believed him." No, they didn't believe him because they didn't cross over. &gt;&gt; And that's the same thing today. If you aren't obeying the message of the hour, but you're just hearing it &gt;&gt; and you're not obeying it, that means you don't have faith. &gt;&gt; You don't have rapturing faith. You'll never get rapturing faith by just hearing. You've got to do what he said. &gt;&gt; That's a sign. You know when you tell your kids, how can you tell a good kid you got good kids? &gt;&gt; Is when they do what you tell them, &gt;&gt; right, Liam? How can you tell you got good grandkids when you tell them don't go and they stop? &gt;&gt; He's a good grandkid. He's too smart for his own. See, we've had a great falling away. People now say after following the message for 34 years, he wasn't the prophet sent even with great vindication because somebody on the internet has said so. &gt;&gt; Either you are a believer or not. You know what I always like to tell those people this 500 people seen Jesus after he was resurrected. 500 people. How many people made it to the upper room? 120. I always say Jesus the greatest preacher on earth. &gt;&gt; The greatest preacher on earth and one was the devil. &gt;&gt; You know Jesus taught us not to pull that tear &gt;&gt; before it's time. &gt;&gt; Because if he would have pulled that tear before its time, he might have pulled Peter out. He might have pulled James out and John out. &gt;&gt; And so, you know what? We've got to follow the leading of the Lord. And we've got to stick to the word and stick to his his his what he has said. You know, they said Jesus Christ was stolen away. They said he never resurrected. His disciples ate his body. &gt;&gt; They stole his body. And they're still saying those things today. You know what? But we have a word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know that I know that Jesus is the same. I know that I believe the truth. I know it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you know you're saved? You can't show it to somebody. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what, you know it when when you're saved. You know Jesus has taken possession. I can tell when somebody has taken possession of Jesus. You know how I can tell? They talk about Jesus. &gt;&gt; They witness about Jesus. And that's what the greatest thing that I've been doing for two years, I've been telling my congregation, if you're not witnessing, that means you haven't had a real experience. And witnessing is a burden for the lost. And we have to have it. The gospel can only be believed by faith. And you can only receive the Holy Ghost by obeying the word of God, which takes faith. So saints, let's take faith and believe to the end that he's coming. And let's take our mountain. Let's take faith in God's word. We need to stand and believe that he hears us and that his word cannot change and it will not change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll read you with this scripture and then I'll close. Philippians 48. It says, "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things." And if you think as a man thinks, it says in Proverbs, so is he. I pray that the Lord would bless you here at this fellowship at Restored Word. That he would just come down with his power, with his might. &gt;&gt; And that he would just musicians come and that he would just send a little revival. &gt;&gt; You know, I I don't believe the world's going to see a revival, but I believe the bride will have a little revival. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe that revival is going to start in individual hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe that the Lord wants to revive us. &gt;&gt; So let's just stand and let's pray and then we'll sing that song. I need you, Lord. Can Can we sing that? &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord. Right now. Lord, I thank you tonight that we could come together. Lord, I thank you that you have given us thy word, &gt;&gt; faith in thy word. You've given us, Lord Jesus, the power of salvation. You've given us light over the things of thy word that we might walk in truth, Lord, and that we might do the things that you want us to do, that we might be ready for thy coming, Lord. Lord, touch every heart. Touch Brother Moses. Touch Brother Zigg. touch every brother here tonight, Lord Jesus, that has need of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, that you would lead them, that you would guide them, that you would just, Lord, take hold of them. And Lord, give them the power to stand, Lord Jesus, in this dark and adulterous generation. Lord, we need the power to stand. The power to stand and Lord, be a light for you. Lord, touch every heart here tonight. Touch those that are streaming in tonight, Lord, that would desire, Lord, just to be touched by thy presence, to come closer to you and just have an attitude change. Lord, you can do it because you promised it. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. [Music] I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. [Music] &gt;&gt; I lift my hands and bow my knees and worship at your throne. [Music] I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord. right now. [Music] I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. I lift my hands and bow my knees and worship at your throne. I need you Lord. I need you Lord right now. Wasn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Was that marvelous? &gt;&gt; Let's give a hand to the Lord this evening. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Jonah, I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed it. God bless you, Richley. I really enjoyed very good good good stuff I learned this evening. &gt;&gt; Thank God for that. If brother Jonah can be rude, oh uh God have mercy on us. If they consider him to be rude the way he's preaching and that softness then oh what about the others? Oh God have mercy on us. Oh brother Jonah we we love you. I almost say that that I almost say that at the beginning. Just listen how he's going to preach. is going to be it's going to be this that humility and and softness but good things will come out just just watch just watch and and and just you just saw how it is right little then he's poking at you he's telling you the truth right but he's just so soft and oh realize oh actually I've been just it's been unveiled there but oh and oh we appreciate you brother John I seriously and we thank God for that and that that attitude that that that's what we should be God we need you more and more ledia does not think that they don't need God the more you think that you don't need God then you're on the way in the way way way down but when you realize Lord no matter how many years I've been in the message no matter I was I grew up in the message or no matter Lord constantly I need you actually the more you serve God the more realize that oh I need him more and more. I depend on him on every step because it's it it it's getting it's getting tighter if I can put this by lack of words getting tighter at the junction of time. We are living in the junction of time and right there it's a if you don't have the right attitude and you just go without knowing it and you think that you know it all and everything and it's just the wrong attitude and you go but God give us that right attitude right approach constantly all the time Lord help us to have the right attitude because the right attitude will make every promise of God come to pass. Amen. If you look at the Caleb and and Joshua, they saw the same things. They saw the same challenge, some same challenges, the same giants, the same obstacles. They went in the desert 40 years. They saw the same thing over and the good things, but also the negative things. I like what he said. Two out of two millions. Think about it. Two out of two millions. If you have a church of two millions and only two are faithful, think about it. Oh wow. Will be discouraged. I mean, seems like I'm the only one saying amen in church. I'm only because two million don't show up. They're just doing their own stuff. Oh my. Oh, God help us. two millions two millions criticizing each other and talking about the other things and we see what Moses did and no it's not anointed and let's move back and complain murmuring and everything and you are in that church member of that church but you don't look at that you focus on Christ &gt;&gt; focus on Christ Lord keep my mind stayed on you keep my mind stayed on the promise Abon belongs to me belongs to me no matter the the giant no matter obstacles. Abon belongs to me. Amen. My husband doesn't believe it. That is the problem. My AB belongs to me. My wife doesn't believe it. That's the problem. Abs belongs to me. &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us Lord to have that right attitude. Help us Lord. Help us to have that right attitude. Really enjoyed it. Let's give Lord a little bit of 10 minutes of prayer to the Lord just from what we have heard. If you can Lord, keep your mind stayed on me. You know that song? I'll try it. I'll try it. Keep your mind stay. [Music] Keep your mind [Music] stay on me.

We relieve if you'll just keep your mind on. &gt;&gt; Let's sing once again. Keep your mind. &gt;&gt; Oh, keep your mind stay on me. Oh, stay on me faithfully and I will give you perfect peace, sweet cream, [Music] if you'll just your mind set on me. &gt;&gt; As the word came forth, we just say amen. Let's just spend a little time in prayer individually. Speak to the Lord this evening that we have heard such a wonderful message this evening as the music is playing softly for us. Father, we thank you. Thank you for your presence, Lord, this evening. Thank you, Father, for the word of God that came spoke to our heart, Father, to remind us to have the right attitude. Lord we pray God that you change our mind. You change the way of thinking father we think on you constantly father on the promise of God not to feed our mind with different things or different voices but just to feed upon the voice of God so that we can have the mind of God. We desire to be changed transformed. I desire to be changed, transformed by the renewing of my mind, Father, through the Holy Spirit to have the right attitude of Christ. Father Lord, as we are now crossing into the land of the Holy Ghost, the promised land, Father, Lord Jesus Christ, help us, Lord, to keep the right, the right mind, the right attitude, the right approach as Joshua, as Caleb, Father Lord, to claim the promise of God despite the circumstances, despite the obstacles, despite, Father Lord, the challenges, but the Lord is but not to rely on our emotions but our emotions can be up and down but help us our emotion to be constant control under the leadership of the Holy Ghost. Help us father Lord Jesus Christ. We thank you for your word. We accept it. We say amen. Change father Lord our attitude. Change our way of thinking father. As we feed more on the word of God, our thinking will be changed. our mind will be changed and like the Holy Spirit father as we welcome your word this evening. You said father if we receive the word we'll become the word father we receive the word speak into heart correcting us molding us father lord shaping us lord Jesus Christ because you desire us you want us lord to come to the full stature of perfect man the full stature of Christ father Lord Jesus Christ the greatest battle ever thought is in the mind is in the way of the attitude father god about the difference between a believer and unbeliever is about attitude. The prophet speaks about that Syrian Syrian woman. Father Lord, despite the challenge, despite the rejection, but Lord, she kept the right attitude, the right approach, says Lord Jesus Christ, give me even the cramps, the cramps, Father, even the dogs can feed from the cramps, Lord. Father Lord Jesus Christ, this this evening we pray give us even the cramps. Father Lord, as we keep the right attitude towards your word, your word will never fail. Your word will never be defeated by the word of God will defeat Satan any time, any place, under any circumstances. Father, we see the darkness in the world that has been reminded to us this evening. Gross darkness upon the world, but there is light for the bride. Father Lord help us to look at the right at the light to look at the word to stay positive. Father remove away the critical spirit. Father the spirit of judgment spirit father Lord of complexes but give us the heart that is humble simple humble simple staying on the word of God. Not compromising but be under the subjection of the word. As we heard this evening, God walking with you is to be subject to the word of God. Hearing your word is not only hearing by the by by the the natural hears, but hearing by faith and going into obedience, Father, to what we desire to be obedient to your word.
