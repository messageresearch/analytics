[6:15] Just
[6:19] being so gracious to us.
[6:33] that even we can't even

[6:44] imaginable

[6:52] Lord God even Lord we gather here
[6:56] because you called on us to be here
[6:59] Lord.
[7:00] It is one of the orments that you made
[7:02] to us Lord that you as us to do father
[7:05] and we are just here to fulfill that
[7:08] Lord. Father we are an unworthy people
[7:11] but by your name Lord by your grace by
[7:13] your blood
[7:16] by your holy spirit Lord you make us who
[7:19] we are. Father God, this evening,
[7:22] may you be merciful to us. May you
[7:25] forgive all our trespasses, all our
[7:28] weaknesses. May you heal our souls, heal
[7:31] our bodies. Lord, you know each and
[7:35] every one of us more than we know
[7:38] ourselves. You know the white hair
[7:42] that is growing on my head before I even

[8:01] This evening, Father, we we have no
[8:06] words, not enough.
[8:08] We can't appreciate you enough.
[8:13] But in this little way, Lord, that we
[8:15] try to do, Father, with our human
[8:17] capabilities, Lord,
[8:20] may you receive our worship this
[8:22] evening, Lord.
[8:25] May you be merciful to us. May you just
[8:30] take all our our our mistakes, our sins

[8:40] us. You have uh you you have given us

[8:55] challenging us each and every day by
[8:58] unveiling yourself to each one of us?
[9:00] Lord, may you become more real to each
[9:03] one of us, Lord, so that we can be more
[9:07] like you. Father, forgive each done, my
[9:12] brother, my sister has done that that is
[9:14] a hindrance to the other Lord. Father,

[20:45] and the honor.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; We are here to praise him. We are here
[20:48] to glorify him. And we are here to
[20:51] remember what he has done for us
[20:54] &gt;&gt; and how it caused him to have what we
[20:57] have today.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; It's only by grace that we are saved.
[21:01] Amen. Let's just go to the Lord in
[21:03] prayer one more time. Father, we thank
[21:06] you for gathering of the saints of
[21:11] saints of the same precious faith.
[21:15] That's what has united us. Father, thank
[21:19] for the Holy Ghost as we heard this
[21:21] morning that there's you have filled us
[21:24] with your Holy Ghost making us part of
[21:26] one body, one family. Father, we thank
[21:30] you for the grace you have done in our
[21:32] lives to be part of you Lord from the
[21:36] different backgrounds, different places
[21:38] where we were Lord. Some of us even deep
[21:42] Lord in the world but Lord your voice
[21:45] called us and brought us together can be
[21:48] part Lord of the sheephold of Jesus
[21:52] Christ himself. You are great shepherd.
[21:55] Father, this evening we want to put our
[21:58] attention upon you Lord. The service
[22:00] just look of what you have done. The
[22:03] price of Calvary, the price of the blood
[22:05] of Jesus Christ and the benefit that we
[22:08] have of it. Lord, Lord, in this moment
[22:11] as the prayer was done earlier, Lord, we
[22:15] want to humble oursel before you Lord.
[22:18] No one is worthy to come and take this
[22:20] cup and take this breath based on his
[22:23] own merits or the works. Father Lord, we
[22:26] die daily. We make mistakes every day.
[22:29] Father Lord, sometimes Lord God, we we
[22:33] do even do even commit iniquities and
[22:36] the things that we know that we should
[22:38] not do and we still do them, Father.
[22:40] Father, Lord, we pray that you forgive
[22:42] us, Lord, that you be merciful unto us.
[22:45] May you look through us, Father, through
[22:46] the blood of your own son, blood of
[22:49] Jesus Christ. Father, we recognize that
[22:52] we are unworthy, but only the blood of
[22:54] Jesus Christ has made us worthy. Lord,
[22:57] you know the desire in our heart is to
[22:59] please you, to honor you. Our desire,
[23:02] Father, Lord, is just, Lord, to see you
[23:05] being manifested and glorified through
[23:07] our lives. May you bless father this
[23:09] service as we can already feel your
[23:12] presence and the solemnity of it father.
[23:15] We just want to humble oursel before you
[23:18] and give you the glory and the honor.
[23:20] Bless your people father. Let it be a
[23:22] service of blessing. From this place
[23:24] father those who are sick will be
[23:26] healed. Those who are weak will be
[23:28] strong. Father Lord where there is a
[23:30] problem solution will be found. Father
[23:33] that's where we coming. You promised us
[23:35] as you said in the type Lord as those
[23:38] who left Egypt for 40 years Lord their
[23:42] clothes were not deteriorated. Father
[23:45] Lord there is remain strong. Father Lord
[23:48] the grace of God provided a prophet and
[23:51] all the different blessings along the
[23:53] way. Lord the same way Father Lord as in
[23:57] commemoration of that was the type. Now
[23:59] we have the antitype fat lord how much
[24:02] more should be strong.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; We want to say out out after this
[24:05] service indeed the weak can say I'm
[24:09] strong.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; The one who seek can say lord I'm he
[24:13] thank you father lord because of what
[24:14] you have done for us. We give you the
[24:17] glory and the honor. Bless your people.
[24:19] One more time in Jesus Christ we pray.
[24:22] Amen.
[24:24] Amen.
[24:26] Invite you to go to the word of God.
[24:29] Isaiah 53.
[24:31] Thank you, brother Gian. Thank you,
[24:33] brother. Brother Caleb,
[24:40] brother go at the end. If you can
[24:42] prepare, you know how I like the way you
[24:44] do things just a song after song a
[24:46] little bit. That would be great
[24:49] for 10 minutes, 15 minutes or so. It
[24:52] would be great. Yeah.
[24:59] Isaiah 53.
[25:04] No matter how many times you read this
[25:06] scripture, this scripture is still
[25:10] breaking our heart and as especially
[25:13] when you read it really with revelation
[25:16] what it took and the cost of it.
[25:20] Isaiah 53 verse three. Read it in verse
[25:24] 3 to verse 11.
[25:29] The Bible says,
[25:32] "The Lord Jesus Christ, he is despised
[25:34] and rejected of man,
[25:38] was a man of sorrows and acquainted with
[25:41] grief, and we hid as it were our faces
[25:44] from him. He was despised, and we
[25:48] esteemed him not.
[25:51] Surely he had borne our griefs and
[25:54] carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem
[25:57] him stricken, smitten of God, and
[26:00] afflicted.
[26:02] But he was wounded for our
[26:04] transgressions.
[26:06] He was bruised for iniquities. And I'll
[26:09] be talking about being bruised. He was
[26:11] bruised for iniquities.
[26:13] Chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[26:16] And with his stripes, we we are healed.
[26:19] That's our promise and still valid
[26:21] today. So all we like sheep have gone
[26:24] astray. We have turned we have turned
[26:28] everyone to his own way. And the Lord
[26:30] had laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[26:34] He was oppressed and he was afflicted.
[26:36] Yet he opened not his mouth. He's
[26:39] brought as a lamb to the slaughter. As a
[26:42] sheep before a sheer is dumb. So he
[26:46] openeth not his mouth. He was taken from
[26:49] prison and from judgment.
[26:52] Who shall declare his generation? For he
[26:55] was cut off out of the hand of the
[26:58] living. For the transgression of my
[27:00] people was he stricken. And he made his
[27:04] grave with the wicked and with the rich
[27:08] in his death. Because he had done no
[27:11] violence, neither was any deceit in his
[27:13] mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise
[27:17] him. One more time. Pleased the Lord to
[27:19] bruise him. And he had put him into
[27:22] grief. When thou shalt make his soul an
[27:26] offering for sin, you shall see
[27:30] shall make his soul an offering for sin.
[27:32] He shall see his seed. He shall prolong
[27:34] his days. And the pleasure of the Lord
[27:37] shall prosper in his hand. shall see of
[27:40] the travail of his soul and shall be
[27:44] satisfied. By his knowledge shall my
[27:47] righteous servants justify many for he
[27:50] shall bear their iniquities.
[27:54] Amen. God bless his word. Can I have a
[27:56] seat?
[28:05] The Bible plainly says that he was
[28:07] bruised.
[28:09] was bruised. And the Hebrew word for
[28:10] bruised means he was
[28:14] the Hebrew word for means
[28:17] was he was crushed. The Bible says the
[28:20] Lord it pleased the Lord to bruise him.
[28:24] Pleased the Lord to bruise him. In other
[28:25] words, it's not that God was happy that
[28:28] he was bruised. He was satisfied and or
[28:31] was taking pleasure in what he was and
[28:33] how he was bruised. But no, but God
[28:37] chose him to be bruised. As we heard the
[28:40] song, Sister Stella this morning, he had
[28:43] a purpose. He was looking into the
[28:45] result of what will come out of it. And
[28:48] that the purpose for it was salvation
[28:50] for you and for me. So the Lord pleased
[28:52] the Lord to bruise him. They had a
[28:55] purpose and what God was doing. God did
[28:58] not delight in suffering itself, but he
[29:02] was delighting in what the suffering of
[29:05] Jesus will produce. Amen. As in Hebrew
[29:08] 12, the Bible says, "Who for the joy
[29:10] that was set before him, he endured the
[29:13] cross." Think he endured the cross
[29:16] because of the joy of the victory that
[29:19] comes with the cross. He was thinking of
[29:22] you, you were thinking of me. That's why
[29:24] we are here commemorating what God has
[29:27] done for us. We could not do ourself. We
[29:30] could not save ourself. We cannot rescue
[29:32] ourel. We could not even ourself being
[29:35] reconciled to God on our own merit. It
[29:38] depending completely on what God has
[29:40] done. The salvation is completely God
[29:44] and God himself. And that's why we are
[29:46] so thankful for what he has done for us.
[29:49] Amen. Thanks to Calvary, we have the
[29:52] removal of our sins. As I said, even our
[29:55] iniquities,
[29:57] he has taken them away. Because of
[30:00] Calvary, we have the reconciliation to
[30:02] our God. We have the fulfillment of the
[30:05] justice and righteousness of God. Not
[30:08] our own righteousness, but he took upon
[30:10] him our iniquities and he made us the
[30:13] very righteousness of God himself. The
[30:17] price is that the price is paid so that
[30:19] we can be free. He paid the price so
[30:22] that we can be free. He became sin so
[30:24] that we might become the very
[30:27] righteousness of God himself.
[30:31] John 19 as we go into the scripture in
[30:34] John 19 it says
[30:41] because this is a time of crucifixion
[30:43] and what happening the Bible says John
[30:46] 19 verse 28 says after this Jesus
[30:50] knowing that all things were now
[30:53] accomplished that the scripture might be
[30:55] fulfilled he said I thirst
[31:00] Now there was set a vessel full of
[31:02] vinegar and they filled the sponge with
[31:04] vinegar and put it upon his and put it
[31:08] to his mouth. And when Jesus therefore
[31:11] had received the vinegar he said it is
[31:14] finished and now the scripture he knew
[31:19] that the scripture was going to be
[31:20] fulfilled. Says now he bowed his head
[31:23] and he gave up the ghost. gave up the
[31:26] ghost and himself he had to lay down his
[31:29] own life. No one took it from him.
[31:32] Himself had to lay down for you and for
[31:35] me. He gave up his ghost. And the Jews
[31:37] therefore because it was a preparation
[31:40] that the bodies should not remain upon
[31:42] the cross on the Sabbath day. For that
[31:44] Sabbath day was an high day besought
[31:47] Pilate that their legs might be broken
[31:49] and that they might be taken away. Then
[31:52] came the soldiers and break the legs of
[31:54] the first and of the other which was
[31:57] crucified with him. But when they came
[32:00] to Jesus and saw that he was dead
[32:02] already, they break not his legs. But
[32:06] one of the soldiers with his spear
[32:08] pierced his side, and forth came there,
[32:13] and and and fourth weave came there out
[32:16] blood and water. And he that saw it bear
[32:20] record and his record is true. And he
[32:22] knoweth that he said and what he and he
[32:25] knoweth that he s true that he might
[32:28] believe. Is Paul John himself saying
[32:31] that wrote it. I saw it. It was their
[32:34] witness. Said for these things were done
[32:36] that the scripture should be fulfilled.
[32:39] A bone of him shall not be broken. And
[32:42] again another scripture said they shall
[32:45] look on him whom they pier. Amen. I'd
[32:49] like to talk just a little for a moment
[32:51] here. He was bruised but without broken
[32:55] bones.
[32:57] Say was bruised but they didn't break
[32:59] any of his bones. Amen. It looks like a
[33:03] contradiction here. Looks like a
[33:05] contradiction. How would he bruised? How
[33:07] was he crushed? But at the same time,
[33:10] none of his bone were broken. Why this?
[33:13] Why that? The answer is in the
[33:15] scripture. Amen. And the prophet himself
[33:18] says in Hebrews chapter chapter 2 in the
[33:20] series of Hebrews and chapter two he
[33:22] says now there happens to be a Jews
[33:25] there are somebody that understand the
[33:26] old testament prove let me show you I
[33:29] haven't got the old testament with me it
[33:31] says this is the new testament but in
[33:33] the offering of the shoe bread that was
[33:35] laying on the kosha plate in the Jewish
[33:38] sacrifice at the cleansing of the
[33:39] tabernacles ask any Jew on these three
[33:42] pieces of bread the middle piece was
[33:44] broken that was Christ the middle piece
[33:48] was broken. Christ the in between showed
[33:51] that there had to be a breaking
[33:54] somewhere for redemption. And that piece
[33:56] was considered redemption on the kosher
[33:58] bread. And here it is. And tonight when
[34:01] we take the communion, we break the
[34:03] kosher bread for it is the body of
[34:06] Christ. Break show out the suffering.
[34:09] And he was broken at Calvary to be a
[34:11] propitiation for our sins. That through
[34:14] his righteousness we might become
[34:17] through his righteousness we might
[34:19] become his righteousness because became
[34:23] our sins that we might become his
[34:25] righteousness. Brother that's purely
[34:28] grace. Aren't you thankful for God's
[34:30] grace in our life? Said absolutely said
[34:33] there is no way any other way you could
[34:36] justify.
[34:38] How could the Roman
[34:40] just putting my my thought here? How
[34:42] could a Roman soldier pierce him on the
[34:44] side without breaking any bones?
[34:47] The Lord Jesus Christ, he he couldn't
[34:50] break any bones because he had to become
[34:53] he had to be he was already the perfect
[34:55] lamb of God, but he had to fulfill the
[34:58] scripture as being the perfect lamb of
[35:02] God. as a lamp. They were bringing the
[35:04] lamp to to the the bringing the lamp for
[35:07] sacrifice. Exodus 12:14 says, "Neither
[35:11] shall he break a bone of that lamb shall
[35:14] not break the the bone of that lamb." In
[35:16] Numbers 9:12 says, "They shall leave
[35:19] none of it unto the morning, nor break
[35:21] any bone of it." So that is a
[35:24] representation of the perfect lamb of
[35:26] God. They could not break any bone of
[35:29] it. Amen. prophecies the atonement. It
[35:31] says the atonement says notice they were
[35:35] they were ready to break the legs of our
[35:37] Lord Jesus Christ. If that harm would
[35:40] have struck that leg and broke it, God
[35:42] would have been found false. But there
[35:45] wasn't enough devils in all dark torment
[35:49] to let that harm strike that precious
[35:52] body. says, "For David 800 years before
[35:55] then said, there will not be one bone
[35:58] broken in his body." God's word had to
[36:01] stand true.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and what did they do then?
[36:05] Then they took a spear and rammed it
[36:08] into his side and blood and water came
[36:10] out to fulfill what the Bible said. They
[36:13] pierced my hand and my side. The word
[36:16] was to be fulfilled. Isn't that
[36:18] wonderful? Amen. That even even though
[36:21] that was just about to break the the
[36:24] legs of our precious of our precious
[36:26] Lord Jesus Christ. God had to intervene.
[36:29] God had to intervene so that the
[36:31] scripture might be fulfilled. Nothing
[36:33] can break the scriptures of God. But at
[36:36] the same time, he was bruised.
[36:40] The fact that none of the bones were
[36:42] broken doesn't reduce the fact that he
[36:44] was bruised. He was crushed.
[36:47] Amen. The Bible used the word crushed.
[36:50] And that crashed in Hebrews means he was
[36:53] oppressed, shattered, oppressed, broken
[36:56] in his spirit and in body, severally
[36:59] afflicted.
[37:01] Amen. Isaiah 53. As we rise, surely he
[37:04] had borne our griefs and carried our
[37:07] sorrows.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; You think that you have sorrows. You
[37:11] think that you have griefs and sad
[37:13] moment. He took that all of them upon
[37:17] himself to understand what we are going
[37:20] through, what you are going, what I'm
[37:21] going through. He bore all our griefs
[37:24] and all our sorrows upon himself,
[37:28] crushed and bruised of all our sorrows
[37:32] and all our griefs. So that when we are
[37:35] going through them, we understand that
[37:38] our savior understands what we are going
[37:41] through and we don't have to worry. B
[37:44] all our griefs and our souls.
[37:50] Look at being a physicians.
[37:53] He describes the agony of our Lord Jesus
[37:55] Christ. In Luke 22
[37:58] verse 44 it says being in an agony he
[38:01] prayed more earnestly and his sweat was
[38:04] was as if it were great drops of blood
[38:07] falling down to the ground.
[38:10] A rare in medical terms it says it a
[38:13] rare condition in extreme stress where
[38:17] the capillaries burst and blood mixes
[38:20] with sweat mean it was in a so much deep
[38:24] stress so much deep
[38:28] I'll say trauma just that that that
[38:31] grieves and the sorrow and I came to my
[38:35] own and they rejected me and I'm bearing
[38:38] all this this burden upon me because I
[38:40] want to pay the price. The price for the
[38:43] deliverance of my my bride and all that
[38:46] was upon him crushed bruised
[38:50] for my sorrow for your sorrow. But one
[38:54] will go even deeper and says he died. He
[38:56] died paraphrasing a greater death and he
[39:00] gets money than at the cross because he
[39:02] had to make that decision and and then
[39:05] when he made that decision or not my
[39:07] will but your will Lord
[39:09] &gt;&gt; and there he was already determined
[39:12] because he saw the joy he wants the
[39:15] price is paid so that you and I can be
[39:18] free.
[39:22] Proverbs 18:14 says, "The spirit of a
[39:25] man will sustain his infirmities."
[39:28] If you have infirmities in the body, if
[39:29] your spirit is strong, you can sustain
[39:33] those infirmities. But a wounded spirit
[39:36] who can bear when the spirit is broken,
[39:39] it's hard. Spirit is wounded, it's hard.
[39:43] Amen. But Lord Jesus Christ even though
[39:46] none just trying to put out that that
[39:48] scripture is sorry even though one bone
[39:51] was not broken but he this spirit was
[39:55] bruised crushed even the body was
[39:58] actually crushed the flesh and the
[40:00] muscles and everything.
[40:03] Amen.
[40:05] No human being could suffer like he
[40:07] suffered. No human can have such trauma
[40:10] as he had. He was the creator being
[40:13] humiliated by his own creation. He was
[40:16] mocked before Kas the high priest. He
[40:20] was slapped on the face by telling the
[40:22] truth that you shall see the son of man
[40:24] sitting on the right hand of God. They
[40:27] spat on his face. They pulled off his
[40:30] beard of my Lord Jesus Christ for you
[40:34] and me.
[40:36] And this by his own creation so that you
[40:39] and me can be saved. He was indeed
[40:41] bruised. A man. The Bible says in John
[40:44] 19:13 says, "Pilate therefore took Jesus
[40:47] and scorched him. The soldiers platted
[40:50] platted a crown of stones and put it on
[40:53] his head and they put it on him a purple
[40:55] robe and said, "Hey, king of the Jews
[40:58] and they smought him with their hands."
[41:00] You know, if you the passion of Christ
[41:03] gives a little bit of a glimpse of what
[41:05] will happen, what happened or they
[41:07] discoued him and whipped him. The
[41:09] brother described in terms of the very
[41:12] hard the nails on on those that weeping
[41:16] him crushing his flesh, removing his
[41:19] flesh, the of my Lord Jesus Christ and
[41:22] just weeping him and whipping him and
[41:24] the blood
[41:26] flashing out from all directions
[41:29] for you and me, being bruised, being
[41:32] crushed
[41:35] to bear my pain, to bear my sorrows, to
[41:38] bear my sicknesses. is my afflictions
[41:42] to understand when I'm in prayer. He
[41:45] understand.
[41:47] Amen.
[41:51] And on top of that
[41:54] he was stripped to increase the
[41:56] humiliation
[41:58] as the Roman capital punishment Roman
[42:00] crucifixion of involve the public
[42:03] nakedness to shame the condemned by Lord
[42:06] Jesus Christ completely scripted people
[42:09] mocking him laughing at him so if if you
[42:13] saved others why can't you save yourself
[42:16] oh you say you are King of the Jews, why
[42:19] can't you save yourself?
[42:22] But from that deep sorrow still say,
[42:24] father forgive them. They don't know
[42:26] what they do. What they are doing, they
[42:29] don't know what they are doing. But
[42:30] forgive them. He was thinking of you
[42:32] were thinking of me.
[42:40] Prophet says,
[42:45] I'll skip that one to save time. And it
[42:47] comes to where the soldier comes to
[42:49] pierce his side. The Roman exe
[42:52] executioners were expert executioners.
[42:55] They knew how to make the condemned
[42:57] suffer a lot while dying slowly. They
[43:02] knew how to that's why they put them in
[43:03] the cross and they put the nails on the
[43:06] feet so that you as you are suffering
[43:09] you're like being asphicated
[43:11] because you have to push yourself up to
[43:14] have a little bit of breath and
[43:17] then down and you are forcing yourself
[43:20] but you're dying slowly slowly slowly
[43:23] slowly
[43:25] and that's what my lord was going
[43:27] through
[43:29] and I was saying they knew how to make
[43:31] the condemned suffer a lot while dying
[43:33] but they also knew how to speed it up
[43:36] that's why when he came they realized
[43:38] that the other ones were not dying quick
[43:41] and then they cut their the feet to
[43:43] allow the condemned to feel to not be
[43:46] able to fill up his lungs with hair
[43:48] because they cut the feet. You can't
[43:49] push up yourself anymore.
[43:53] They want to make sure that you don't
[43:54] fake the death. And then they pierced
[43:56] took a spear and then thrust into the
[43:59] side of the Lord Jesus Christ. And out
[44:02] of that heart came out blood and water.
[44:08] It's not prophet says he didn't die
[44:10] because of that of that of of of of the
[44:13] suffering of of how they afflicted him
[44:16] in the flesh. He didn't die because of
[44:17] that but he died out of the grief
[44:21] and and that spear actually re revealed
[44:26] how much suffering he has been going
[44:28] through because it showed after his
[44:31] death the scriptures after he died that
[44:33] the blood and the water was separated.
[44:36] The only condition is of showing that
[44:38] someone went through extreme extreme
[44:41] extreme extreme trauma, extreme stress,
[44:46] extreme crashing in the spirit, in the
[44:49] mind, in the in the body. That's the
[44:52] blood and the water can be separated
[44:56] to show how much suffering our lord went
[44:58] through.
[45:02] Prophet says in so by himself says
[45:06] he died a sinner nailed to cross. Every
[45:09] physical thing showed that he was dead.
[45:11] They beat him. They hung him up there.
[45:13] Well, he bled enough to kill him and he
[45:17] was dead. The heavens declared he was
[45:19] dead. The earth say that he was dead.
[45:21] Everything say that he was there. The
[45:23] Roman soldier rammed the spear threw his
[45:25] heart and there let his blood out. Blood
[45:28] and water which is was separated showed
[45:31] of grief and and he said he was dead.
[45:34] Look if the man was hanging there and
[45:36] blood and water poured out showed that
[45:38] the blood and the water had separated.
[45:40] Prophet says allelujah he was dead and
[45:44] he never died from the sword. He never
[45:46] died from the pierce. He died because of
[45:49] grief.
[45:54] There is nothing in the world will
[45:56] separate blood from water. Ask any
[45:58] science you want to and any doctor tell
[46:00] you only through hard grief and
[46:03] sometimes that people suffer so hard
[46:06] that you know in the grief like head
[46:08] like heart heartaches and and things
[46:10] like that and sometimes cause a heart
[46:13] attack and kills them when the blood and
[46:15] water separate. That what killed the
[46:17] Lord Jesus. He died under the hands of
[46:20] Jehovah. That's right. the full penalty.
[46:23] Justice for God. For God required
[46:26] justice. There is no man could take his
[46:29] life. He said, "I laid it down. No man
[46:31] can take it. I laid it down and I raise
[46:34] it up again."
[46:36] Are you thankful
[46:39] for what it took the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:41] to die on our behalf? But as as as as as
[46:45] that spear separated the blood or show
[46:48] the separation of the blood and the
[46:50] water in the water separation, it says
[46:52] that word of separation separates you
[46:54] from sin. If you are weary, apply the
[46:57] word of the word. If you are sick, apply
[47:00] the word of the word. For it separate us
[47:02] from sickness. It separate us from sin.
[47:04] Separate us from weary. Separate us from
[47:07] every attribute that sin produced. Oh, I
[47:09] love it. For he was washed. For you he
[47:13] has washed us and cleansed us from the
[47:15] washing of the water by the word and
[47:17] separate us unto himself a believing
[47:19] people set aside from the world to
[47:22] believe to the Holy Spirit operating
[47:25] through the inside of the blood cell. I
[47:28] hope you see it. The blood cell bursted
[47:30] at Calvary. That's my thought.
[47:34] The blood cell bursted at Calvary.
[47:37] Life was inside the cell and then it
[47:39] broke the cell. Christ did first. Christ
[47:42] did first bringing himself into the womb
[47:44] of virgin and creating around him a
[47:46] cell, a blood cell that multiplied in
[47:48] many cells and brought forth the son of
[47:50] Christ Jesus. And at Calvary, this blood
[47:53] cell was broken by a sinful Roman spear
[47:56] as it pierced him in the heart.
[48:00] And I'll say before that spear pierced
[48:04] that heart, that heart was already full
[48:07] of grief.
[48:10] Of the grief and bearing our grief and
[48:12] our sorrows, it was already pierced.
[48:20] But now look, let's look at the benefit
[48:21] of of what it brought to us today.
[48:26] What he done for us, what it means for
[48:29] us. Calvary means for us. Says right in
[48:33] the middle of the heart is a little
[48:34] place in human being that isn't an
[48:37] animal. A little place in there. And I
[48:40] think it's a soul of a man. There's not
[48:42] a blood cell touches it or anything. And
[48:45] in there is the human soul. And Christ
[48:47] was speared through there. That's the
[48:50] blood cell was pierced like that. Throw
[48:52] loose the blood cell and set the Holy
[48:54] Spirit at liberty for God to call
[48:57] through there and bring believers
[48:59] through the blood cell back into
[49:01] fellowship with himself again.
[49:06] If you see the purposes of how how we
[49:08] get back to fellowship with God, we have
[49:11] to go to the blood. We have to go to the
[49:13] water. We have to go to the blood. And
[49:15] then we have to have the Holy Spirit. As
[49:17] I was thinking about it, this is just my
[49:19] own thought that the way I know there
[49:22] there's there there's a proper we there
[49:24] is an order have to go you have to water
[49:26] we have to go the blood you have to go
[49:28] to the the life but but look how the
[49:31] Bible does describe it. He gave up his
[49:33] spirit
[49:35] and then 1934 if I'm not mistaken then
[49:38] it says then came out of it the blood
[49:41] and then the water.
[49:43] So for for the sinner, the sinner was
[49:45] down there. God is going the other way
[49:48] around. So he gave up his spirit. He's
[49:50] gave up then the blood and then then the
[49:52] water so that you on the other side you
[49:54] can take take those steps of the water
[49:58] and then the blood and then come to the
[50:00] life.
[50:02] So he had to do the reverse work in
[50:05] order to bring you back to where he is
[50:08] to restore that fellowship. Amen.
[50:15] So through the washing of the water over
[50:17] the word, faith comes by hearing,
[50:19] hearing by the word of God. And we
[50:21] accept the word and believe the word
[50:23] that he was wounded for transgression.
[50:26] What was that separation to do? What did
[50:28] he separate them from? As soon as they
[50:30] received the separation, they were free.
[50:33] What was Christ separated from? What did
[50:36] he separate us from? The Bible said he
[50:38] was wounded for our transgressions. He
[50:41] was bruised for our iniquities. The
[50:43] chastisement of our peace upon him. And
[50:46] with his stripes we were separated from
[50:49] our diseases.
[50:51] The blood in him and the water was
[50:53] separated. Even the Holy Spirit was
[50:55] separated. Amen. So that us can be
[50:58] separated from our diseases.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; We can be separated from our diseases.
[51:05] We can be separated from our sins. The
[51:08] prophet says, "Separated from our weary,
[51:10] separated from our iniquity, separated
[51:14] from our sins by the word which was
[51:16] Christ that was made flesh and dwelt
[51:20] among us."
[51:22] Amen.
[51:25] And another part as I'm finishing with
[51:27] this
[51:29] says out of his side mark of the beast
[51:32] as God opened up the side of Adam in the
[51:35] garden and took out the part to make a
[51:37] bride. God opened up the side of Jesus
[51:40] at Calvary and took out the bride out of
[51:44] his side.
[51:46] He suffered so that he can take the
[51:48] bride out of it. you and me today and we
[51:53] are beneficiary of the high price of
[51:56] Calvary and we can rejoice in it.
[52:00] So I want to show you when God gave Adam
[52:02] his bride from his side he said she's
[52:05] flesh of my flesh bone of my bone is
[52:07] that right? When God gave Christ his
[52:10] bride, the spirit gave the flesh, the
[52:12] bride, he was punched, pierced on the
[52:15] side under his heart and water and blood
[52:18] and the spirit came forth that became
[52:21] flesh of his flesh. Born of his bone and
[52:25] we are the flesh and the bones, the
[52:27] bride will be the flesh and bones of
[52:30] Christ. Exactly. That is his bride.
[52:34] That verse
[52:37] uh say that verse of John 19:34
[52:42] is one of the most theological dense
[52:45] verses in the gospel of John because
[52:48] only John having the anointing of the
[52:50] eagle pointed out to that. No other
[52:53] gospel mentioned it. Only John only the
[52:57] bride can recognize where she comes
[52:59] from. So this is one of the most
[53:02] theologically dense scripture of the
[53:04] gospels because it is linking the
[53:07] history
[53:08] one part of the history where there is
[53:10] the type of the of the lamb that the
[53:13] bones were not broken out of it. Amen.
[53:16] But it also bringing together the
[53:19] prophecy that what the what pro what
[53:22] prophesies in the prophecy that none of
[53:24] these bones should be broken. It has
[53:26] been fulfilled. But out of it also comes
[53:29] the bride. Out of it comes also
[53:32] salvation which is the blood and also
[53:35] the water of separation.
[53:38] One of the precious scriptures that of
[53:41] his heart came out life.
[53:44] Amen.
[53:46] I'll finish with this musician can come.
[53:49] Even the moisture from his body left and
[53:52] the blood run down this the spear and
[53:55] off his feet and trinkled onto the
[53:58] ground. He was so dead. Prophet he was
[54:01] so dead until the moon and the stars
[54:03] said he was dead. The earth said he was
[54:06] dead. He had a nervous frustration. The
[54:10] rocks shook out of the earth and
[54:12] everything everything said he was dead.
[54:14] Even God hid his face because he was
[54:18] dead.
[54:19] But his body was transformed because God
[54:22] said, "I will not leave his soul in
[54:24] hell. Neither will I suffer my holy one
[54:27] to see corruption."
[54:29] One day there was a resurrection as a
[54:32] type of us as well. There will be a
[54:34] resurrection because of what Calvary has
[54:37] done for us. Amen.
[54:46] in the cross. In the cross singing them
[54:48] before I read the scripture, the cross
[55:09] in the cross be my glory forever.
[55:24] Oh Jesus,

[55:30] the cross.

[59:43] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ. Father present your

[59:48] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Father Lord present to you your church
[59:54] &gt;&gt; the one you died for. Father on that day
[59:57] you bore
[59:59] the griefs and the sorrows. Father Lord
[1:00:01] you were crushed. You are bruised.
[1:00:04] Oh Lord Jesus Christ we can have
[1:00:08] fellowship with you. Lord we are going
[1:00:11] getting ready to take the communion.
[1:00:13] Father Lord
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; realize how worthy we are father but we
[1:00:18] look to the
[1:00:20] golota to Calvary
[1:00:23] at where our strength is Lord let the
[1:00:25] stream of life the stream of the blood
[1:00:28] the stream of the water even that stream
[1:00:31] of the spirit that came out from you
[1:00:33] Lord come and overshadow us Lord at this
[1:00:36] moment wash us and cleanse us in the
[1:00:40] name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[1:00:45] Want to invite the elders and pastor Z.
[1:00:51] As I
[1:00:54] breaking the bread, just want to invite
[1:00:57] you to read 1 Corinthians 11:23.
[1:01:05] For I have received of the Lord that
[1:01:07] which also I delivered unto you the Lord
[1:01:11] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:01:13] betrayed and took bread and when he had
[1:01:16] given thanks he break it and take and
[1:01:19] say take eat that this is my body which
[1:01:22] is broken for you. This do in
[1:01:25] remembrance of me. After the same manner
[1:01:28] also he took the cup when he had sapped,
[1:01:31] saying, "This cup is the new testament
[1:01:33] in my blood. This do ye as often as you
[1:01:37] drink it in remembrance of me. For as
[1:01:40] often as you eat the bread and drink
[1:01:42] this cup, you do show the Lord's death
[1:01:45] till he come." Wherefore, whosoever
[1:01:47] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:01:50] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:01:52] of the body of the body and the blood of
[1:01:55] the Lord. But let a man examine himself,
[1:01:59] and so let him eat of that bread, and
[1:02:01] drink of that cup. For he that eateth
[1:02:04] and drinkketh unworthily eatth and
[1:02:06] drinkketh damnation to himself, not
[1:02:09] discerning the Lord's body. For this
[1:02:12] cause many are weak and sickly among
[1:02:15] you, and many sleep. For if we would
[1:02:18] judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:02:19] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[1:02:22] chestnuts of the Lord that we should not
[1:02:25] be condemned with the world. Wherefore,
[1:02:27] my brethren, when you come together to
[1:02:29] eat, tar one for another.
[1:02:33] Matthew 26:26:30
[1:02:35] says, "As they were eating, Jesus took
[1:02:37] bread and blessed it and break it and
[1:02:40] gave it to the disciples and said,
[1:02:42] "Take, eat. This is my body." Pastor,
[1:02:46] would you please pray for the bread?
[1:03:26] Father,
[1:03:29] we look to you tonight
[1:03:35] Jesus.
[1:03:37] We description Lord of
[1:03:44] the
[1:03:46] Lord.
[1:03:49] But we want to thank you from all of our
[1:03:51] hearts.
[1:03:55] We want to thank you Lord God for
[1:03:59] paying the price for being
[1:04:04] Lord. You were bruised for you were the
[1:04:08] Yes.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Just like it was dirt.
[1:04:14] We thank you, Lord Jesus, for doing it
[1:04:18] for us. For my iniquities, for my
[1:04:21] wrongdoings
[1:04:22] where I knew how to do better and I
[1:04:24] didn't do it. Lord, forgive me, oh God.
[1:04:28] Help us, your people, to be thankful.
[1:04:31] Help me to be thankful, Lord, to
[1:04:33] appreciate what you've done for us. for
[1:04:36] me personally. Lord, I want to thank
[1:04:39] you, Lord. I was nothing and you picked
[1:04:41] me up out of the dirt
[1:04:43] and Lord, you raised me up, Lord Jesus,
[1:04:46] to shine for your glory. How thankful we
[1:04:49] are today that we can have that approach
[1:04:53] to our God, the spirit of God through
[1:04:56] Jesus Christ our Lord, and be reconciled
[1:05:00] to you, Lord. What a great work it was,
[1:05:03] Lord. Like we heard this morning, Lord,
[1:05:06] we recognize we heard many different
[1:05:08] words, but Lord, we know the Holy Spirit
[1:05:10] is God himself
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; because you are spirit
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; and we must worship you in spirit and in
[1:05:18] truth. So Lord, help us to get into the
[1:05:21] spirit. Help us all, Lord. We're so
[1:05:24] fleshly often times.
[1:05:26] But Lord Jesus, we want to remember
[1:05:29] tonight, not only tonight, but every
[1:05:32] day. We want to thank you, Lord, for
[1:05:34] helping us where where we where we were
[1:05:37] weak.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Where we were undone, but Lord, you
[1:05:40] helped us, Lord, like we've broken this
[1:05:44] bread.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; We raise it, Lord, up to heaven. We pray
[1:05:48] that you would bless it as we eat this
[1:05:51] bread. May we remember Yes.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; How you suffered, how you were broken
[1:05:55] beyond
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; measure.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I've seen some pictures. It's
[1:06:00] beyond measure. Lord, it's unescribable.
[1:06:04] Our hearts are breaking, Lord. Our
[1:06:05] emotions are high.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Lord. What you have done for us, Lord.
[1:06:10] We thank you. We thank you. We thank
[1:06:13] you. I know our thank yous are not
[1:06:16] enough, but Lord Jesus, our life, we
[1:06:19] give our life to you, Lord. whatever is
[1:06:22] in us, Lord. We want to praise your name
[1:06:25] tonight. We want to glorify thy name
[1:06:28] tonight.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you for the blood.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for the life that came
[1:06:35] out of it.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; That we can have eternal life through
[1:06:38] Jesus our Lord.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; PRAISE your name.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; We're here to praise you tonight.

[1:06:52] Jesus

[1:06:57] May there be such a communion amongst
[1:06:59] us, Lord, such a love.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; There's no greater love than you showed
[1:07:05] giving your life for us. Bless us
[1:07:07] tonight. Let your presence be here
[1:07:10] tonight.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we thank you for those few words
[1:07:14] our brother spoke, but they touched our
[1:07:17] hearts. bless our brother Moses. We ask
[1:07:20] it in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:07:47] My sins are
[1:07:57] I

[1:08:06] My sins are

[1:09:27] them, saying, Drink ye all of it, for
[1:09:30] this is my blood of the new testament,
[1:09:32] which is shed for many for the remission
[1:09:35] of sins. But I say unto you, I will not
