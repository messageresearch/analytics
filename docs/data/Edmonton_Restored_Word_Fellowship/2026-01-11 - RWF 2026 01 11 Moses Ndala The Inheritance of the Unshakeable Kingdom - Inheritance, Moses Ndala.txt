Summary of the Sermon: “The Inheritance of the Unshakeable Kingdom”
Brother Moses centers the sermon on the believer’s present possession of an unshakeable inheritance: the Kingdom of God. Drawing first from Colossians 1:10–19, he emphasizes that believers have already been “translated… into the kingdom of His dear Son” through redemption by the blood of Jesus Christ (Col. 1:13–14). This kingdom is not merely future; it is a present reality made available through Christ, who is the Head of the Body and in whom all fullness dwells. Brother Moses underscores that Jesus Christ is the visible image of the invisible God, the Creator and Sustainer of all things, and that the Church exists for His preeminence. He then transitions to Hebrews 12:22–28, contrasting the fear and trembling of Mount Sinai with the grace of Mount Zion, where believers receive “a kingdom which cannot be moved.” This unshakeable kingdom, he explains, stands in contrast to everything in the natural world, which is subject to shaking, collapse, and eventual destruction.

The sermon expands by illustrating how all earthly systems—political powers, governments, economies, and even great historical empires—are temporary and unreliable. Using Daniel chapter 2, Brother Moses recounts Nebuchadnezzar’s dream of the statue representing successive world empires, culminating in the divided kingdom of iron and clay (Dan. 2:37–43). He points out that history itself confirms the prophecy: Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome all rose and fell. Yet the stone cut without hands, representing Christ and His Kingdom, smites the image and grows into a mountain filling the whole earth (Dan. 2:34–35, 44). Brother Moses connects this to Brother Branham’s frequent teaching that “the world is falling apart” and that no political system—democracy or dictatorship—can bring lasting stability apart from a return to the Word...

But what you did is you passed it on to brother Sig and we are praying for brother Sik to get better. [music] Um got a few um issues to get out of the way before we start our service. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So, like I said, if we can uh pray for brother sik, he's not feeling well today. Uh a praise report. Brother Victor's [music] mom wasn't feeling well and he posted uh a prayer request on the group chat. Uh there's a report that she's feeling much better. We thank the Lord for that. &gt;&gt; Uh brother Peter's [music] wife hit her feet. Uh there was a prayer request. I don't have an update but we let's keep praying um that the Lord [music] will touch her wherever she is. Uh brother goshen is traveling uh to Africa to get married. So we let's keep our brother in prayer. Uh pray that uh all the plans [music] uh there in Africa will go according to the to the Lord's will. uh sister Esther [music] is collecting a love offering for our brother. So if you feel it in your heart that you want to help your brother or just uh give uh something to your brother for his wedding, you [music] can see sister Esther, she's doing the collection. Uh also uh at [music] the back of the church outside uh we have posted a list [music] of names and addresses of uh donors of tithes and offerings. Uh if you can go and check as you make your way out, check uh [music] your name and address so that they will appear correctly on your donation receipts for the [music] year 2025. So you can just drop by a ticker against your name. Um, okay. Sister Rahma will be leaving for Africa on Tuesday to be with her husband. Um, Sister Lisa [music] is traveling on Tuesday. Oh, tomorrow. She's going back to the US [music] tomorrow. So, if we can also keep uh in our prayers. [music] I don't see brother Phillip. I know he's uh he's been working. So, let's keep him in our prayers [music] as well and keep praying that the Lord will find him a suitable position. We know it's it's [music] our brother's desire to be in church. He requested for he pastor on a prayer request that uh if the Lord can grant him, [music] he granted him a job. So what's more difficult getting a job than getting [music] a good shift that will make him be available for God's service here. Uh okay and we have a baptism after service. So if we can also bear in mind and uh pray for the young sister [music] Christristiana for that. Amen. Sorry that was a long list [music] but uh we got that out of the way.

But you by coming you make this become a church. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you richly for being here. a little bit of a program today. So, just go to the word of God right away and we had a youth meeting on on on Friday. It was just wonderful and thank God for the Monukis family opening the door and welcoming the &gt;&gt; the youth and appreciate that. God bless them richly. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that was good fellowship just to around the word of God but also among themselves and parents on the side so talking and we just um you know um it's not it's not a one man's ministry. So we need one another. &gt;&gt; It's a bit too high. It's too low. Oh, it's better. Okay. Yeah, we need one another. Definitely. I just say we need one another. So that's uh so that's uh so just there as we fellowshipping with brothers and just have good ideas and sharing that. So just realize that uh we need one another. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's important to have fellowship. I invite you to go to um the book of Colossians, familiar scripture. Colossians chapter 1. Colossians chapter 1 verse 10 to 19 then I'll let you sit and I'll read another one in Hebrews 12. So the word of God says Colossians, Colossians comes after Philippians. Um Philippians comes after Ephesians I think. And then so um 10 says that he might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. Is that what we desire to increase until we come to the stature of the perfect man? It says, "Strengthen with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness." says, "Giving thanks unto the Father which had made us meat to be partakers of an inheritance of saints and light who had delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us onto into the kingdom of his dear son." So that's where I would like to focus now today is to be translated into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature. For by him were all things created that are in heaven, that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created by him and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is and he is the head of the body, the church with the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the father that in him shall all fullness dwell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless his word. Can I have a seat? And glory to his name. Just wonderful to read what pertains to our Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the body. Amen. Is the head of the body so that he might have preminence upon all the body. Amen. I so want just to special greetings to my my friend George there. Welcome. uh just uh he came here last year but uh see uh we just get in contact so spend a little time after work and and yeah you might you might remember George remember George you used to be in a the same business back then yeah [laughter] &gt;&gt; long time yeah so we will uh We used to work together in the business together, brother Yahoo and brother George there. So after meeting we spend a little time and talk about past [laughter] no not grieving but still talk about it. So welcome. Um, Hebrews 12 2020 20 Hebrews chapter 12 verse 20 22nd verse So Paul years make a difference between the law of Moses and [snorts] says 21 says so terrible was the sight that Moses said exceeding fear and quake. Then he make now the transition to what we have come to. say that, but we are come unto Mount Zion, unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of just man made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of the sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel. That blood is still speaking better things today. &gt;&gt; The blood of the Lord Jesus Christ is not crying for vengeance, but it's crying for healing, for forgiveness, for salvation, for redemption, for joy, for peace. Whatever we have need of, whatever he paid on the on the Calvar tree today, that blood, it's still it's still speaking better things on our behalf and it's still here. It's still available. And then it says 25th, I think 25th says, "See that you refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escape not to refuse him that spake on that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape. If we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven." So the one that's speaking now is speaking from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he had promised yet saying yet once more I shake not the earth only but also heaven. And this word yet once more signifth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for God is a consuming fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just want to focus on the verse 28. Wherefore I said that's why we have we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved. Let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. Just bow our head one more time. Father, we have read the scripture, the word of God, the holy word. Father Lord, we pray that you give us the context. Father Lord, may you as a prayer was done was made earlier, brother Dan, Father, we desire just to speak one word, something that will strike our heart. Help us Lord in our walk. That's what we desire. Help us Lord for the speaker and the hearers. Let the Holy Spirit move on each and every one of us in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would like to talk this morning about um the so brother Peter I'll start maybe putting the tit so I put the title there so that um you'll be safe for you. So I put a title as a note there. um um the inheritance of the unshakable kingdom says we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved. So that we have received something that God has given us a kingdom that cannot be moved that cannot be shaken as an announcement of the capstone of the pyramid that we are going through. So it's not something that is in the future. It's something that we have received that is available to have a want it. Amen. Whoever is growing with God it's available. The prophet to say first I would like to start with this. The prophet says in each local church there is nine spiritual gift that come among the people that is knowledge, wisdom, gift of healing, working of miracles, speaking with tongs, interpretation of thanks and all these things go in each local body and every person in the church has an individual ministry and that individual ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to edify the body of Jesus Christ. Sometimes you might think, "No, I'm just there. I'm just coming church and I go back. I don't have any ministry. I don't have anything." But the prophet says, "Every one of us, every one of us has a ministry. &gt;&gt; Every one of us has a place. Every one of us can edify someone else." Amen. So you are very important in God's eyes. God does not neglect you. God doesn't put on just this part is not important for the body. No, every part is important for the body. That's why we need one another so much in this age. Amen. Because I cannot be complete without you. You cannot be complete without me. So I depend on you. You depend on me. We depend on the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And I relying on God's working through you. Amen. As you are relying on God's working through me. Amen. One another. So important because each person in the church has an individual ministry. Amen. as we can be blessed on different ways through the songs and the presence to the amen creating the atmosphere and all that is important never don't let the enemy try to take that from you it's very important so talking about in kingdom I just want to say here that I'm not I'm not a politician but uh we we we sometimes we can't afford to to avoid to see what things are happening in the world and things like that so I'm not trying to win people here and then everything on one side of the politics and everything. But um you know the politicians sometimes they say uh you know when politicians are campaigning they say you know what they will they will they will draw the bad things or say oh no look this economy is bad and things and immigration and everything they will they will they put a picture on negative things. Amen. And then once they are in power then they try to no there's no problem. There's no pro like everything is fine. But when they out then they will again need to come the negative things. So that's that's not how God works. God does not need to change and to try to depict that things are but God God the word of God is the absolute. The word of God what the word of God says is the absolute. We might not understand it at the beginning but it still remains the absolute. There are many voices now many different voices going around but there is only one voice that is the absolute is the word of God. Amen. So I think the prophet preached this message and many of my quot my thoughts come from this message. The world is falling apart. &gt;&gt; The world is falling apart and it's still real today. The world is falling apart. There's nothing that can bring this world from coming back outside of the world of outside of the word of God. I believe it's not a coincidence that this message the pro the message that prophet preached this message the first message one of the first message I believe that after the seals it says the world is falling apart in other words outside of the seed outside of the word of God outside of the seals that have been revealed this world everything will be crumbling everything will be falling apart amens are nothing else but Christ the word of God is nothing else but Christ in the beginning in the Beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was with God. The word was made flesh. And then in the in the Lord Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ is the word of God being revealed. Amen. If you say I love the Lord, you have to love the word of God because they are one. There are three people there three there three say that I'm putting there three things or three three are making witness are witnessing in heaven. It will say the father, the word and the spirit and those are one. It's not separate. They all one. Amen. You can't separate the father from the word. You can't separate the word from the holy spirit. All are one. It's not three persons in in a deity. It's one person in different offices. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it says as it was in the time as it was in the time of Noah, so shall it be in the time when the son of man is revealed. So shall it be in the coming of the son of man. The whole thing crumbling and falling apart. Certainly they could not believe that he could be destroyed. One time you know one time I went went with my the family to B and everything and after that they were showing us showing we went to a place where there used to be coal mine and everything and there was a city there used to be a city there and I look at that and then just told my wife you know what you know at one time this place was maybe flourishing and everything. It was the economy. It was the boom of the economy at that time. But today it's just ruin. Then I just reminded them there is no continuing city here. &gt;&gt; We have no continuing city here. Anyway, we go one time went to Rome and I went to Rome and you see the place where there used to be a big the great empire and everything the great kingdom of Rome but today is just ruins and people are working on it and everything is just this is nothing. So we have no continuing city here. No matter how powerful it can be, no matter how great it can be, one day it will just be ruins &gt;&gt; just pass away. Amen. Only one thing cannot be shaken. &gt;&gt; Only one thing cannot be moved is the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; All the other kingdoms are just are just are just temporal. They just the time they will come and they will pass. But the kingdom of God can never pass. The kingdom of God is eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see in Egypt in time of the pyramids such a glorious empire. Look at it and today is just ruin. See the empire of Babylon today it fell apart. You look at Rome as I mentioned today is nothing. The only permanent is the new Jerusalem from above where we have come to. Amen. We have come to the new Jerusalem to the kingdom of God that cannot be moved. That the only thing that cannot be shaken. Amen. I want to hold to that unshaken hands of God. The kingdom of God that way is the stability. Any other thing is just shaking. It's just moving ground. Only upon the kingdom of God that something that cannot be moved. Amen. That's why really I want really to emphasize this this this morning is let hold to the thing that cannot be shaken. Anything else will be shaken today looks like a good idea tomorrow it's a bad idea or tomorrow it look like a bad idea tomorrow it's a good idea man keeps changing man keeps changing ideas changing poly things but the word of God stays stable. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me go back a little bit to the dream of Neb. uh go with you in the Bible. The kingdom of Babylon was the greatest of all of them. We see Daniel gives that interpretation of the dream of that statute of the dream that of of Nebuchadnezzar. So in Daniel 2:37, he say 38:7 says, "Oh king, are a king of kings." Daniel 2:37, "For the God of heaven had given thee a kingdom, power, and strength and glory. Wheresoever the children of man dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven have he given unto thine hand have made thee ruler over them. For the art this head of gold. This simpl this passage shows that Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon was the head of gold means it was the first and the greatest kingdom of all of them. You know you you see that that status shows actually it was given a grace to that king to to see all the different kingdoms that will come after him. You saw the kingdom of Babylon himself where he was the head. You saw the kingdom of Median person where they will come and they saw the other kingdom that will come again about the Greece and and in Rome at the end. Let's just go to the scripture here. And it says the other in Daniel 2:39, "And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, the median persia says, another third kingdom of brass, which will be Greece, and thou shall bear rule over all the earth." Then and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, which is Rome. For as much as iron breakth in pieces, and subdued all things, and as iron that breakth all these shall it be break in pieces and bruise. And whereas thou seest the feet and the toes, part of potter's clay and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided, and they shall be in it of the strength of the iron. For as much as they saw as the iron mixed with with marry clay. This is the time we are living is the time of the feet. Part of it is the is the clay. Part of it is the iron. And the clay is Russia. And the iron is a is a is is a is is a is is a united state. So the kingdom shall be divided and there shall be in it as a strength of the iron for as much as that so as the iron mixed with merry clay. They might sometimes they look like they're working together but in reality they can never mix. They will always be one block east and one block west. Always always all the time. They might look like sometimes they can they can rec reconcile but they will never reconcile. It's promise that they can never be mixed. As we see that we see the prophecies being fulfilled. That's why the bride is not being surprised. The bride is not being shaken. The bride is not be going to a Christian should not be be uncertain to go to one side or go to the other side. You know where you are standing. You know what the word of God says. You should have to be just as stable. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just staying with the word of God. As we see that the prophet will point to that. He says, "You see our cruchev crv means in in Russian means clay and eisenhower which which means the iron you know they at some point they were together and at some point the crew during the United Nations he took his shoe and then and he put it on the table and he was just slapping the table is against about the against what the the American were doing at that time and he says you see the prophecies being fulfilled what Daniel prophesied eyes is being fulfilled now. So we are in the time of the fulfillment of the prophecies of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our eyes are being opened. WE SEE WHAT HAPPENING. If it was already in the time of brother Bam there, how much is it in the time we are living in? It it's it's more than late. If you know I can say it in English, this can be it. IT'S TIME IS ALREADY PASSED. WE ARE IN THE TIME OF THE PATIENCE OF GOD. IT'S NOT TIME TO PLAY CHURCH ANYMORE. IT'S NOT TIME TO BE NEGLIGENT ANYMORE. It's time to be more sincere with God BECAUSE THE COMING OF THE LORD CAN HAPPEN ANY TIME. WE ARE ALREADY IN THE PROCESS of the coming of the Lord. Amen. As a brother prayed, we have already received. We have already received THE HUSBAND COMING DOWN. NOW, IT'S THE TIME OF THE UNION of the bride and the bridegroom. It's a time to be united WITH THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Just allow me to to read my notes here. Says, "But now if not realized yet, we should realize nothing on this earth on this earthly side is certain. Nothing is certain. If you want to trust the government, I'll say good luck to you. &gt;&gt; You can't put your trust in the government. The government is corrupt. Nothing is certain. Today there will be one way, the tomorrow there will change. There's nothing there." says, "We live in the day of uncertainty. Our nation is rotten to the roots." &gt;&gt; That's right. There's no hope for it. It's all gone. There's only one thing to look for is the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Only the coming of the Lord is our consolation. Is our comfort. The government is not our comfort. You know, we can be there. We can put back Trudeau. Maybe you don't like Trudeau. You keep him out. You put another one Mark Carney on. Maybe maybe you might keep it out. There is no solution in government. I'm not Democrat. I'm not Republican. I'm not liberal. I'm not NDP. I'm not green. I'm just a Christian. Amen. &gt;&gt; One person came one time the house and he said, you know, you are conservative. I like many ideas of conservatives. It's very good. I don't like those liberal blah blah blah things. But you know what? BUT OH, SO YOU are really how come you he thought that he found someone? Oh, so you don't believe in I don't believe in those liberal things. Oh, wow. You must be Can you recite something? I already be taken by something else. Can you come to the place where I have also my party? [laughter] Can you come to the church? Come to the church. That's where I go to fellowship. I don't go to any other political party. I've already voted for one. I voted for the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's where my soul is gone. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the prophet says in the world is falling apart. They might elect a president or even Abraham Lincoln in every county of the United States and to never hold it together till we get back to the word of God. back to the oldfashioned black back black back Bible that's got the truth that the only way we'll ever know God and keep our world together is back to the principle of Jesus Christ back to his doctrine back to the Holy Ghost again leading the church. In other words, you can you can think you can elect this one you can. No, you can never come back. This world is falling apart. &gt;&gt; It's going to fall apart. You can maybe you can put Biden. You can remove Biden. You can bring what is now Trump. Make America great again. It will never be great again. Oh, it might look like a little bit the peace and everything and one day it will just crumble. I mean because there is no hope. When everybody say peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, then great destruction will come. &gt;&gt; There there is no hope for the world. The only hope is in the word of God. The only hope is in the kingdom of God that cannot be shaken. Anything else will be shaken. Amen. &gt;&gt; The handwriting is already on the wall. The angel has already announced this world is finished. EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT NOT see it today, but one day you'll see it will be finished. CALIFORNIA WILL BE under the sea. IT WILL HAPPEN. I'M not a prophet of doom, but I'm just announcing the word of God. It's going to happen. So the only way of escape is going to the rapture. Amen. WE WILL BE CUT AWAY. AMEN. AND THIS WORLD will be destroyed. &gt;&gt; Humanly speaking, there's no certainty in politics. No need to emphasize on it. But it's already rotten. Some rely on dictatorship. Dictatorship is rotten. Some brag about democracy. Let me tell you, democracy is also rotten. The prophet says democracy is rotten. I believe democracy and then he says certainly I'm an American. I believe in democracy but at the rotten thing there is there at the rotten things that in democracy means it's also rotten. It's also why is it rotten? Because it is uncertain sound. You can't rely on it. The nations give an uncertain sound. Employment gives an uncertain sound. Everything is about uncertain. If you are hoping for your pension to make you rich, I would say good luck to you. It's uncertain. Uncertain everywhere. Uncertainty. There's uncertainty in your job. Uncertainty in politics. But we thank God for the word of God. The word of God gives a certain sound. It's clear. IT'S REAL. AMEN. LIKE I SAID, the blood IS STILL SPEAKING BETTER THINGS. It's clear. IT'S CERTAIN. IT CANNOT BE CHANGED. I WILL BE WITH YOU, EVEN IN YOU UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD. ONE MIGHT ONE,000 MIGHT FALL AT YOUR LEFT AND 10,000 AT THE RIGHT, BUT I WILL KEEP YOU SAFE IF YOU STAY IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD. THAT'S WHERE certainty is. The other side of that, the world is falling apart. We have received all a kingdom that cannot be shaken. Anything else will be shaken and must be shaken. Amen. What happened in the in the dream of the king Nebuchadnezzar? It's actually we are in the middle of heat being happening because Daniel 2:34 says, "Thy saw as still that a stone was cut out without hand, which more the image upon the feet that were on iron and clay and break them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, the gold, the broken to pieces together, and became like the shaft of the summer. threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and that stone that smoked the image became a great mountain and fill the whole earth. I believe there is there is a physical manifestation of that prophecy. Amen. There is a physical manifestation of that prophecy. One day these kingdoms will be over and only one kingdom that will stay in the millennium is the kingdom of the Messiah of the Lord Jesus Christ. And we are looking forward to that time. Amen. We are looking to forward to the manifest to the to the the manifestation of that kingdom to come and be real. So there will be no no sickness in that. There is no no death in that kingdom. There is no be there will be NO TAXES. THERE WILL BE NO RECEIPT AND and bills. All the different negative things. There won't be in THAT KINGDOM. ONLY JOY ETERNAL. AMEN. PRAISE BE TO GOD. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR. THAT'S WHERE OUR JOY IS. &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. There will not be separation anymore. No death, no crying, no weeping. Only joy eternal. Thank God for that. But as but also in the spiritual realm, this prophecy is being fulfilled in the spiritual realm. Now we used to be slaves of kingdoms. We'll be slave of backgrounds. We slave of of traditions. We be slave of we thinking this. I came from this place. I came from that place. I came from that place. BUT THANK GOD THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED THE WORD OF the hour. The word of the hour came as the capstone AND CRUSHED ALL THE KINGDOMS IN OUR HEART. WE USED TO HAVE DIFFERENT KINGDOMS IN OUR HEART. BUT THAT WORD OF GOD CAME AND CRUSHES THEM AND REMOVE THEM. AND NOW THAT KINGDOM HAS TO BE THAT THAT STONE THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE A small stone that was not cut by any man. That small stone of revelation that you got in your heart. That small stone of revelation your heart HAS NOW TO GROW AND BECOME A GREAT MOUNTAIN BECOME A GREAT KINGDOM IN YOUR SOUL. AMEN. WE ARE NOW celebrating or we ARE CELEBRATING THE COMING OF THE CAPSTONE IN OUR SOUL. AMEN. THE COMING OF THE capstone through the word OF GOD IN OUR SOUL TO ESTABLISH THE KINGDOM OF GOD IN OUR [screaming] HEART. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE I'M RELYING THE THANK GOD FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD IN MY HEART. AMEN. THAT CANNOT BE SHAKEN. [clears throat] [snorts] &gt;&gt; No man controls you. No man as here controls you. The only thing that should control you and will control you is the capstone in your heart. It becames the great mountain of revelation. Daniel said when he saw that, he gave the interpretation. Daniel 12:33 he says, "But go thou thy way to the ends, but thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot until the end of days." Daniel saw the kingdoms, but did not leave to see all the kingdoms. But we are those coming at the end time. We see, oh, now we see the interpretation of all a dream being manifested through the age. He gave the interpretation, but now we we know what it means. We have even studied in schools where they mean. But now we COME TO THE LAST kingdoms and the natural kingdoms. And as we see the natural kingdom, we realize, oh, now we are the END OF THE END TIME. SO IT'S NOT only it's not only it's not only a theory, but it's a reality. We are right in the middle of the word of God being fulfilled. So let's OPEN OUR EYES, SPIRITUAL EYES, AND PINCH OURSELVES. LORD, I'M IN THE TIME of the fulfillment of the word of God &gt;&gt; and I want that word of God to be real for me. As we see the world falling apart and the going in the corruption that going, there is also another PART FOR THE BRIDE WHERE SHE HAS TO STAND AND come to the place where she HAS BEEN CALLED TO. AMEN. WHERE SHE has to be the manifestation of Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Prophet says [snorts] we wasn't promised a system. The world is falling apart. We were promised. What was we promised? A kingdom. How do we get into it? By one spirit. We are all baptized into this kingdom. It's the kingdom of God. The kingdom of eternal life. We have an eternal king giving forth his eternal world is eternal word. And we have an eternal people predestinated to eternal life. is the king. We are baptized into it sitting in heavenly glory. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO YOU CANNOT JOIN THAT KINGDOM. YOU CANNOT TAKE YOU CANNOT TAKE YOU CANNOT make some exam or do some exam and pass those exams to be part and take the citizenship of THAT KINGDOM. NO, YOU HAVE TO BE BORN IN THAT KINGDOM. YOU HAVE TO BE PART OF THAT KINGDOM. YOU HAVE TO BE YOU HAVE TO BE BORN. YOU HAVE YOU CANNOT JOIN IT. YOU CANNOT TAKE A STAMP UPON IT. YOU HAVE TO BE PART OF IT. AMEN. YOU HAVE TO BE BORN AND RAISED INSIDE OF THAT KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; And Paul Nicodemus came to Jesus and asked him, he's asking, "We know that you are a master of the law. We know that God no man can do what you are doing except he has been with God." So they knew that he was the Messiah. &gt;&gt; But because of the popularity, because of the prestige, because of their pride, they didn't want to remove it. They didn't want they want to accept it publicly. So at least he came he came secretly and asking what is happening here? And Jesus Christ gave him the key. Jesus answered and said unto him, "Verily, very verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." To see is to understand the kingdom of God. He cannot understand the kingdom of God. It's a mystery to him. Yes, you are in this world, but because you are born again, you can understand the kingdom of God. You're in this world, but you are not part of this world. Your life is different from the life of the other people. How are you so different? Oh, because yes, I'm a Canadian, but I'm not a Canadian. I come from another city. I come from another kingdom. I'm part of another kingdom. That's why I behave the way I'm behaving because I'm a citizen of another kingdom. My life is different. All the other kingdoms, all the other traditions HAVE BEEN BROKEN DOWN. I HAVE RECEIVED THE CAPSTONE. I HAVE RECEIVED THE CAPSTONE. AMEN. THE HEADSHIP IS HERE. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Nicodemus said unto him, "How can a man be born when he's old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?" Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." So that we're going to have a baptism of the water. First, you have to pass by the baptism of the water. Amen. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, not in the name of the father or the son or the holy ghost. You cannot. No one has a name. Can you ever seen my name is father, son, and holy ghost. That's not a name. Only titles. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the the name of the father, the name of the son, the name of the holy ghost, the name of the of of of that person there is the lord Jesus Christ. So you have to be baptized in the name of the lord Jesus Christ. It's like someone saying you know go and you if you're talking let's say just an example to my your wife can the children say oh how can how daddy how can I sign here no you can sign it in the name of of the father just just just sign it in the name of the father they're not going to go there and sign I'm signing in the name of the father no they know their father they know the name of their father so they say I'm signing in the name of Mr. and dala. Amen. Because they know what it means. So the same thing for the Lord Jesus Christ when he gave the order to the disciples, go and be baptized in the name of the father, the son of the holy ghost. Peter come in in in act 238 he says the name of the father, son and holy ghost is the lord JESUS CHRIST. YOU HAD that revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can't enter into that kingdom unless you be born of the water and of the spirit. And the spirit is the new birth. Amen. Prophet says in his presence, but we have we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved. Say hallelujah. Everything can be shaken will be shaken. The heavens will shake. The earth will shake. Earth and heaven will pass away. But the word of God shall never pass away. Upon this rock, I'll build my church and the gates of hell will never prevail against it. So it's not a man building a church. The bride of Jesus Christ is not built upon a man. is not built upon a character of a man of ideas of a man. It bu is GOD HIMSELF BUILDING THE CHURCH. GOD IS BUILDING THE CHURCH ON unshakable rock of revelation. AMEN. THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A PERSONAL REVELATION. AMEN. YOURSELF HAVE TO COME TO THE place say Lord Jesus Christ I believe that the word of God is the truth no matter what the other one does. SOMETIMES WE ARE SHAKEN by what the other person does. So if a certain group of people do these things and then everybody just follow that because they're being they're being shaken they're being tossed about &gt;&gt; go one movement here and then everybody goes there everybody goes here that's politics you know politician they can change that they're checking things underneath &gt;&gt; I know the word sage but I just give polling right is it polling yeah &gt;&gt; polling they're polling the numbers oh now the majority think this way. Okay, now let's change because we want votes. Now the majority is moving this way and now let's change. So really intellectual people, clever people and everything, but they're depending on on on the people they should lead. Now the people are leading them. &gt;&gt; So who's leading us? But thank God for the message OF THE HOUR. THANK GOD FOR THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN. It's the absolute. Doesn't change. It is unshakable. It's unmovable. IT'S THE STANDARD. IS THE ABSOLUTE. HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY. BUT THE WORD OF GOD SHALL NEVER PASS AWAY. LET ME STACK MY HEART. LET ME BE CLEAN TO let me let let me be let me be LET ME BE ATTACHED TO THE WORD OF GOD BECAUSE IF I'M ATTACHED TO THE WORD OF GOD, I WILL NOT PASS EITHER BECAUSE THE WORD OF GOD CAN never pass. Amen. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; And it says everything that can be shook will be shaken but we have but we receive a kingdom which is the word of God himself. So what is the kingdom is the word of God himself. God is his word. He doesn't he he doesn't shake himself. Amen. Oh my. We but we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved. It's unshakable. Said Paul the Hebrew writer. So it's not a man building church. It's God himself building the church. And then we're talking about the spiritual kingdom is not something for the future. It's something that is happening right now. It has to become a PERSONAL REVELATION RIGHT NOW. AMEN. GOD WANT TO BUILD THE KINGDOM IN YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; HIS KINGDOM IN YOUR HEART. DON'T LET ANYTHING else build the kingdom in your heart. HAVE A STRONGHOLD IN YOUR HEART. NO. LET THE STRONGHOLD BE THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; LET THE STRONGHOLD BE THE HOLY SPIRIT. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; LET HIM BE THE MOUNTAIN THAT OCCUPY ANYTHING IN YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; I CANNOT BE SHAKEN. I cannot be moved from the principle of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. As Daniel was giving the interpretation Daniel 2:44 says, "In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed." In the days of those kings, in the days of as you see Kruchev, as you see Eisenhower, God shall set up a kingdom that shall never be moved. Spiritually speaking, that kingdom has already been set. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is the kingdom of the word of God. During the time as they were living there, God revealed the word of God in the fullness &gt;&gt; to the point that the bride can never be shaken. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Through the ages, we were shaken. Sometimes we believe this way and then the other people believe this way. Those who believe only in grace without works, nothing. We usually come to that point many times in this church. And I like to come to that. No, no, no. Then it's just this. No. The other one said, "No, it only this because we see it's the word of God and they have scriptures on both sides, two schools of two doctrines, but how can we reconcile both? We we we don't know." But we thank God for the revelation of the word of God. It give the balance in the word of God. So you need both. You need the grace of God and you need in the manifestation of your love towards God. Amen. But what you are doing the works can't save you but express what is happening inside of you. WOMEN. THANK GOD THAT NOW WE CANNOT BE SHAKEN ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. The greatest the greatest uh compliment Jesus gave to John the Baptist and so when I came and John the Baptist and people came the disciple of John the Baptist came and asked Jesus if John the Baptist is wondering are you the one or the other one should we wait for another one then Jesus Christ didn't send him and send them say no go give him this book and go then read this way and this way and say no just wait and see the prophecies that being fulfilled Heal the heal. The heal are being sick. The paralytic are being healed. The blind can see, the deaf can hear, and everything. And when they saw that, they reported to John. And John believed that he was the messiah. He was the king. Amen. Amen. His eyes and he got strengthened again. One more time. And Jesus Christ instead of criticizing John now is giving good testimony. What did you go to see there? &gt;&gt; Did you go see an a shaken toss here and there? No. is a prophet of God. He knows what is the word of God. He's stable, unshakable. He could speak so hardly to the king, as to the prison, as to the soldiers. He was not being shaken by by tendency, by the ideas of man. No, he stayed faithful. Even cost his life, but he could not shake from the word of God. SAYS, "AH, THIS IS JOHN the Baptist. John the Baptist was the greatest of all the PROPHET UNTIL THEN." AMEN. But it says those who are born in the kingdom of God, THE LEAST OF THEM SHALL BE MORE THAN JOHN THE BAPTIST. SO IF WE ARE IN THAT KINGDOM, WE ARE MORE THAN JOHN THE BAPTIST. IT MEANS WE CAN NEVER BE SHAKEN. AMEN. NO MATTER THE PRESSURE OF THE OUTSIDE, YOU STAY FAITHFUL TO the word OF GOD NO MATTER WHAT. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE HERE DESPITE WHAT THE ENEMY HAS TRIED TO PUT UPON YOU, IT SHOWS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU THAT CANNOT BE SHAKEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We go through trials. We go through temptation. We go through difficult things. And sometimes we feel like no, I CAN'T ANYMORE. IT'S LIKE A little boat in the middle of the ocean. But you know, you've been SHAKEN ON DIFFERENT SIDE from the outside. BUT INSIDE THE ANCHOR [screaming] HOLD SOMETHING IS HOLDING. &gt;&gt; I CANNOT DENY THE WORD OF GOD. IT'S TRUE. EVEN THOUGH MY SENSES, what I'm seeing and the situation I'm seeing, it looks like it's getting from worse to worse. BUT THANK GOD FOR THE ANCHOR INSIDE. GOD IS KEEPING ME. [screaming] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT EVEN keeping him. HE'S KEEPING ME. &gt;&gt; THE ANCHOR HOLD. IT WILL GIVE YOU THE VICTORY. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. says, "And in the days of the these kings, God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. For as much as they saw as that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that breaking in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass you after. And the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof is sure. I like that he had a dream. He was saw the symbols. He saw the thing, but he he didn't have the interpretation. Now Daniel the prophet is telling him the dream is certain. I can relate that to the seals. You see the seals the symbols symbols symbols. Those symbols are certain. Thank God they are certain. &gt;&gt; But oh praise be to God. The interpretation of those seals is also certain. Amen. Is also certain. Is sure. Is sure. The interpretation of it is sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is interpretation of the seals symbols is the thunders. Amen. The thunders sometimes we get confused and say what is a thunder in the message. It's so simple. The thunders is the content of the seals. The seals are the symbols and they have been they've been broken. But the content of those seals the content of the book is the thunders. Amen. So you are not waiting for the other thunders. We have already received the thunders. Amen. By the word of God being by the seals being open, we have received the seven thunders in THE CHURCH. AMEN. THANK GOD FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A mystery anymore. It's not something you have now to guess. No, to assume, to presume. No, it's a certainty. IT'S A CERTAIN SOUND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they came and I gone. Cruchev came and gone. Eisenhower came and gone. Kennedy came and gone. All the other one came and gone. During the days, God will set up a kingdom. And the kingdom is the word of God himself. The dominion of the word will reign forever. That's why in the days of those king, God sent forth the fullness of his word to establish the kingdom of the world in the heart of his bride. Amen. Daniel 7:14 says, "There was given unto him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away. And his kingdom that we shall not be destroyed." And it says, "But the saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever." Babylon was great, but temporary. All human kingdoms rise and fall. God's kingdom alone is everlasting. It will never be destroyed and will be possessed by the saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The world is falling apart. Says, remember every falling generation, there's only one thing that can bridge this world together. That's the word of God. The world was made by the word of God. It's framed together by the word of God. That the only thing that will ever keep it together is the word of God. You think that the world is staying at the level or staying because of what the people trying to do? Now let keep the conservation and no polution and all these things are good. I I I do recycling. I I I do that too. I it's good thing to do but it's not what we are really doing there that is keeping the world. No the world is where it is because the bride is still here &gt;&gt; because we are still party. But once the bride is gone &gt;&gt; it's just judgment. It's just smoke underneath. the rifle of the of the lamb that will be behind. But the world is standing today because you and I we are still here. &gt;&gt; BUT ONCE WE ARE TAKEN AS IT WAS FOR LOT. Once Lot left Sodom and Gomorrah, judgment strike SODOM AND GOMORRAH. ONCE THE BRIDE IS TAKEN, JUDGMENT WILL STRIKE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; BUT THANK GOD FOR THE KINGDOM THAT CAN never be shaken. &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO PRESS ON IN THIS KINGDOM. YOU HAVE TO BE PRESSING ON. YOU HAVE TO FORCE YOURSELF IN THIS KINGDOM. LORD, I WANT AND DESIRE TO BE PART OF THE KINGDOM. I DON'T WANT TO COMPROMISE IN ANYTHING ON THIS KINGDOM. THE WORD OF GOD THAT HAS GIVEN ME IS MY PLACE OF SECURITY, OF SAFETY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Listen to what the prophet says. Praise be to God. No demon, no demon can stand before the infinite son of God when his name is brought into a challenge by faith. does not and cannot fail. The angel of the Lord said, "There is one that could stand. I could have meant that you would have not be shaken, but all of them are shaken because only the word of God can never fall." And I will say this, I know that we all go through different trials and some disappoint. But one comfort and one solid assurance is God word can never fail. God's kingdom can never be shaken. My words can fail and they will fall. My opinions will fail. But God's kingdom, God's word would never fail. That what is the secret? Stay with the word of God. 2 Corinthians 4:15 says, "For all things are for your sakes, and that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God, which cause we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day." For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, workketh for us far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. &gt;&gt; Isn't that a comfort? [clears throat] &gt;&gt; The things that we see are only temporal. Think about it. Everything that we see is temporal. Anything that you feel is temporal. &gt;&gt; Anything that the the the any all the symptoms that you have are temporal. &gt;&gt; But only those who don't don't think that you don't see that you want that eternal. The word of God that you don't see is the only thing that is eternal. Don't rely on your on your own conception. Don't rely on the symptoms. Don't rely on the situation how it looks from the outside. Look to the word of God. That's the thing that is eternal. That the thing that has more value than what you see from the outside. Amen. The things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. &gt;&gt; Our flesh might become old, but the real thing is inside of that flesh. Amen. Heaven and earth will pass away, but God's word will never pass away. For he that heareth my word and believe on him that sent me has everlasting life and he shall never come into condemnation is passed from death unto life. Jesus made those statement and those words after there is no more moon nor stars them words will still be in effect just as powerful as the way the day that he spoke them. His word can never fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we think about it and say, "Oh, no, but brother B made mistakes. Brother Bana made mistakes." But he's only a human. And yeah, I a man. A man is a human. He made mistakes. I can I can even point you to the things he has made. Maybe he spelled this he called Elijah instead of Elisha. But the word of God comes to the doctrine. The word of God that he preached it is unfailable. The word of God is unfailable. Him as a man is a mistake. My as a man is a mistake. But the word of God can never have mistakes. Amen. The word of God is unfailable. So you can put your trust upon what the word of God says. The doctors might fail. The doctor might give you a dynamism. But let me tell you, the doctors is relying on what he's seeing. And what he's seeing is only temporal. &gt;&gt; It's only for a certain time. But God's word, if you stay with God words, that word is eternal. &gt;&gt; Your healing will come from God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he will tell you because that only thing he has learned and he can only say what he has learned. He can he's honest. He want to be honest as as he can. But God's word is above the report of the doctor. Amen. God's word is above the report of any other man because God's word is eternal. Amen. It cannot change. It cannot be moved. I always like that experience. I tell that many times of that little boy, that little boy was sick and called the prophet come to pray for him and the parents were waiting for the prophet. He just prayed a simple prayer and then the signal was showing that that boy was dying and the nurses and and the parents start rejoicing about that. Oh, thank God our boys is here. Thank God our voice is healed. And and the nurse looked at how can you be thanking God when when it's showing there in in that machine that the boy is dying. According to science never seen a person coming back to life from that state. It's just showing a signal that he's dying. Then the the that old man s says that oh nurse I I I know what you are looking you are looking at that machine and you are right. Look at that machine and what I see the same thing that you see there. But I see also something beyond what my natural eyes see there. I see the word of God. By his stripes, he's already healed. And God has already already paid the price for his healing. So he's healed. And he continued thanking the Lord. He continued thanking THE LORD. THE NEXT DAY, THAT BOY WAS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. PRAISE BE TO GOD. AMEN. THE FOLLOWING MAYBE IT WAS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE HE WAS NOT RELYING on what the signs were saying. The word of God can NEVER BE SHAKEN. AMEN. HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY BUT GOD'S WORD WILL NEVER PASS AWAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So our place of defense is only upon the word of God. One thing that is impossible for God to do is to fail. There's one thing that impossible. We say everything is possible but nothing one thing that is impossible to God. And for God is for God to fail. God can never fail his own word. For the Bible says, he says he cannot fail. Amen. You are the word. You in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was and the word was made flesh and dwells among us in our heart in our beings. So God can never destroy his own word because he is the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So where where the problem is where where the problem is? Sometimes the problem is we we look we look with our natural eyes. We we reason with our natural eyes but we believe that God give us more faith in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Reveal your word on our heart more and more. Proverb took this example says I'm not defending the devil here but you you hear sometimes this expression somebody say you know the devil got me. Prophet said no he never the devil never got you. You went out after him. He never come in and got you because you are dead and your life is hid in God and sealed by the Holy Ghost. The only way he could ever get in there is the way the the same way you did. So he just invited you and you walk out of him. That's all. See, it isn't that he come in after you. He can't come in there for you are in Christ dead yourself. Amen. I'm I'm not amening myself. That means so be it. So that's true. experienced it and now that truth passed from death onto life to receive Christ in you. So no, the devil got me. I was no this devil really got me. No say no. If you are really sealed in that kingdom, walled in that kingdom, the devil can't come there. So he's the one you were inside there. He kind of called you. You came out of that kingdom and then you got trapped. &gt;&gt; So he didn't GET YOU. YOU GET OUT OF IT. THAT'S WHY YOU GET TRAPPED. BUT THANK GOD we want to decide to stay behind the wall of the word of God. Stay with the word of God. You will never be defeated &gt;&gt; because God is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Another place he says the same spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost that healed the sick back there, it's been here in the church all the time. But the thing of it is you don't know how to make it work for you. There is one thing that makes it work is faith to believe. When you believe and take him at his word, that's the lifeline. It cannot fail. If you if you would go in the morning and turn on your electrical electric iron, some of you were meant to start to iron. The first thing you know, well, that iron doesn't come on. Well, you not go around and say there is no such thing as electricity. No, you wouldn't do that. There's just nothing wrong. You got your wires crossed up. But oh but but but but I believe this and then then this doesn't happen. He says no you just stay with the word of God. Stay faithful as I was encouraging the young people. Just stay faithful in the word of God. It might take time but stay faithful in the word of God. Never move from it. Amen. Don't reject the iron because no it's not working. No there's no electricity. I don't believe in that. No. Just make just make the the line be correct. Put the mechanic in place. Stay with the word of God. One time it will work. AMEN. NOT MAYBE TODAY, BUT TOMORROW it will work. IF NOT TOMORROW, THE FOLLOWING DAY IT WILL WORK. BUT ONE DAY IT WILL WORK. Deliverance is on the way already. Just stay with the word of God. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; That's why you will say be more sincere. That's why he will say pray. That's why he will say water the word of God with praise and confession. Stay with a positive confession. Never move from the positive to a negative confession because tomorrow it didn't work. No, continue staying praising the Lord. Thank God for HEALING ME. THANK GOD FOR SAVING ME. THANK GOD FOR SAVING MY CHILDREN. THANK GOD FOR RESTORING MY FAMILY. THANK GOD FOR BRINGING ME TO A HIGHER POSITION. THANK GOD FOR ESTABLISHING ME IN THE KINGDOM. CONTINUE TO CLAIM THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; DON'T STAY DISCOURAGED. AMEN. DON'T STAY DISAPPOINTED. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Why it cannot fall? All of these is to allow the kingdom of God to be established. Sometimes God want to see that our reaction and just see how we are going to react. But he our reaction has to be always the word of God. God's word will never fail. It will always come to pass. We look in the Bible. Look at the the three Hebrew children. They just confess the word of God. &gt;&gt; They didn't have a dust of the Lord. The fire will not burn you. No, they just stay with the word of God. The king says that it was one of the greatest kingdom. As I mentioned, it was one the greatest of all the kingdom. The same spirit of Babylon there is the same spirit that is working here. Satan doesn't change. It's still the same Satan. Still the same devil. Just changing maybe strategies here and there, but it's still the same devil. The same devil want you to work for him. He want you to worship him. He want him to put a first thing before him, an idol that you put something that have preminence upon the word of God. He want you want he want you to he he want he want you to soul to sell your s your soul your to sell your soul to him. If you look in the book of re revelation, it's actually amazing. So the beast she she she even bought the souls of people. They became so slave and everything in their mind in their bodies even to the point of the soul &gt;&gt; because they gave everything to the new kingdom to the new ideas and new things. But God says no don't worship that idol there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't worship everybody has to worship this idol. Those two children says no we are not going to worship that. The king say you are not going to worship you are not going to follow my rules. Say no we are not going to worship that. So do you know that you are going to be burning that fire [snorts] even if we have to go to the fire. We are not going to worship this idol. We are not going to submit ourself to Laia. No no no no. We are going TO WORSHIP ONLY ONE GOD. ONE TRUE GOD IS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; NOT EVEN THE PROPHET. NOT EVEN ONLY THE LORD JESUS CHRIST IS the only true God. &gt;&gt; And the king says that because you have done that, I'm going to send you into the fire. And you know the story, right? Send them as they're going through the fire there. Praise be to God. I LIKE THEIR TESTIMONY. KING, EVEN IF HE does not deliver us, we will not worship that idol. &gt;&gt; Even if he does not deliver us, but we will not worship that idol. We will stay true to the word of God. We will not compromise with the kingdom of God. WE ARE NOT PART OF WE ARE NOT BABYLONIANS. WE ARE NOT PEOPLE OF THE LEODYSIA. WE ARE CITIZENS of the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Those who are carrying them got destroyed. But them they were not destroyed. The good news is the angel was already there &gt;&gt; waiting for them. &gt;&gt; In your trials you are going through the angel is already there &gt;&gt; waiting for you. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT YOUR BATTLE. IS GOD'S BATTLE. &gt;&gt; AS YOU STAY WITH THE WORD OF GOD, IT CHANGE FROM YOUR BATTLE TO BECOME GOD'S BATTLE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF YOU LEAVE THE WORD OF GOD AND BECOMES YOUR OWN BATTLE. OH, AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU IF IT BECOMES YOUR OWN BATTLE. BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE MY OWN BATTLE. I WANT TO BE THE LORD'S BATTLE. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL HAS TO CHALLENGE THE WORD OF GOD. I'M TAKING THE WORD OF GOD. I'M STAYING WITH THE WORD OF GOD. THEN GOD WILL FIGHT FOR ME. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; As they go into that fire, he was already there. The fourth man was already there cooling the fire. &gt;&gt; As they drop down in there, they found him already there. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ, he didn't send any angel. Himself came THERE &gt;&gt; IN YOUR TRIALS. HIMSELF IS [screaming] THERE. &gt;&gt; HE'S WAITING FOR YOU THERE TO COMFORT YOU, TO GIVE YOU VICTORY. AMEN. AND HE WILL GIVE YOU VICTORY. The prophet says sometimes those trials that you put us there is to break the chain as we are there. The fire that was supposed to destroy them, it destroys the chain they WERE BOUND TO. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD SOMETIMES FOR THOSE TRIALS to show the great victory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we need to be translating that kingdom. Romans 14. Give me a few minutes here. Romans 14:17. For the kingdom of God is not me is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. So I can walk in this kingdom of the Messiah. It's an inheritance. I didn't touch the part of the inheritance. But it is your inheritance. Prophet says world is falling apart. The good thing about it, friend, is think of this. Before we get to this kingdom, before this kingdom, this king comes now, we can set together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, lifted above, lifted up above all the shadows of all the corruption of the world and all the television programs. Listen how it's so we are in the kingdoms here. But says, "No, before the king comes, before we go into the millennium, we can set together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, lifted up above all the shadows of all the corruption of the world and all the television programs and all these other nonsense they got in the earth today and all the rotten pollution and systems and everything be lifted up in heavenly places. The Holy Spirit himself come upon us and speak out and call to us our sins and tell us how to get straighten up and what we have done in life and what we are doing. It's the Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. That's the king that shall come to this kingdom someday. And his kingdom is now being established in the hearts of his people here on earth. Oh God, let your kingdom be established in my heart. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the kingdom that that king established into my heart. It's like someone is traveling gosh when he was traveling he was his heart was already in Burundi. The body is here but his heart is already there. So oh I'm going there that that's where my mind is. That's where his plan is there. Everything is there. He's planning for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the same thing for us. We might be here, but our heart is already caught up. Translate it into that kingdom. Already caught up in that kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't go in that kingdom if that kingdom is not in you. You are going that kingdom because that kingdom is already in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Says his kingdom is now being established in the heart of his people here on earth. Ephesians 6:11-13, "Put on the whole arm of God that you may be able to stand against the viles of the devil." But Victor touched on Wednesday. For we wrestle not against the flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual weaknesses in the high places. But for take on upon you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand in the evil day, and having done all to stand. So it's a fight of powers, the fight of kingdoms, but we want the kingdom of God to be established. That little revelation that is in your heart there, let it grow, become a mountain. &gt;&gt; So Lord, add revelation upon revelation, word upon word, spirit upon spirit. Fill me more of you, Lord. One baptism but many refilling. Fill me with more of you, Lord. Let the word of God take prereeminence. Let the word of God take take control. Father, I want you to be in the place where you are taking control. Not me taking control, but you taking control in my heart, in my desires, in my ambitions, in my decisions. Let you have the preeminence, Lord Jesus Christ. So, we're looking for a kingdom and we do receive now a kingdom that cannot be moved. The world is falling apart. We receive something into our heart. There is no not devil, devils in hell can shake it out. there's nothing. So, end of quote there. Think about it. It's not that we will receive it, but we have received the kingdom. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about those who are born again. We have received a kingdom. &gt;&gt; Those who are born again, you can if you have received that kingdom, you can never perish &gt;&gt; as God can never perish. &gt;&gt; The word perish does not belong to a born again Christians. You can never perish. As is I'll just touch the word perish for a moment here. The Matthew 8:26 20 22 26 says when he was entered into a ship the disciples followed him and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea in so much that they the sheep was covered with the waves and and he was asleep his disciples came to him and they woke him say Lord SAVE US WE PERISH THAT'S WHERE WE perish that's usually sometimes how it comes in our mind I'm going through these THINGS I'M PERISHING no a Christian can never perish &gt;&gt; as long as in the boat. You can never perish. What you need IS TO WAKE HIM UP. OH LORD JESUS CHRIST, LOOK IN THIS SITUATION AND COME WAKE UP. OH LORD JESUS, INTERVENE IN THIS SITUATION. TAKE JESUS CHRIST OUT OF HISTORY. MAKE HIM PRESENT TODAY. [screaming] THE SAME MIRACLE THAT HAPPENED THE TIME OF BROTHER. THE SAME MIRACLE HAPPENED TODAY. &gt;&gt; TAKE JESUS CHRIST OUT OF HISTORY. BRING HIM INTO LIFE TODAY. WAKE JESUS CHRIST. You can never perish. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus replied says, "And he said unto him, why are you fearful, oh ye of little faith?" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm. Perish does not apply to the believers. We can never perish as God can never perish. John 3 says, "Whosoever believes on him shall not perish but have eternal life." Amen. &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believers on him should not perish but have everlasting life. A Christian can never perish. He is not perishable. There is no expiry date for a believer. For a born again Christian, a born again Christian is eternal. Amen. He [clears throat] can never die as God cannot die. Prophecies in thirsting FOR LIFE. THEREFORE, GOD had no beginning and yet had no ending. And if we become part of God, we can no more die than God can die because we've got his life in us by the new birth. We just as eternal as God is eternal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For me, THAT'S A POWERFUL STATEMENT. THANK GOD. YOU ARE ETERNAL AS GOD is eternal. YOU ARE PART OF GOD. YOU CAN NEVER PERISH. IF GOD PUT THAT KINGDOM INSIDE OF YOU, it means you have been predestinated before the foundation of the world, you can never perish as God can never perish. &gt;&gt; John 10. And I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish. Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. No one can pluck you out of the hand because you have received that that stone that was cut without any help of any man. It was not it was not your father who saved you. It was not your husband who saved you. It was not the children who saved you. It's not even the pastor who saved you. It's not a minister who saved you. It's not a prophet who saved you. It was that stone cut with the help with not help of any man but God himself. He put something inside of you and he want that to grow come to the fullness of the of the capstone. &gt;&gt; It says neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My father which gave them me is greater than them all. And no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand. Are tribulation going to take out take you out of God's hand? No. Sickness going to take you out of God's hand? No. Deception will take you out? No. No. Nothing can separate you from God. &gt;&gt; Nothing can take you out of God's hand because you are part of him already. Can never pass. You can never change. You can never change. Once you are in that kingdom, he can never take you out of that kingdom. No one can make you change your identity once you are part of that kingdom. No one can take you and make another citizen. Once you are part of that kingdom, you are part of God's economy. DO YOU LOVE the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; CAN YOU THANK GOD FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR YOU? &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR THAT KINGDOM THAT CANNOT BE SHAKEN. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR THE PROMISE OF GOD. AMEN. SOMETIMES YOU CAN HAVE SOME TRIALS. YOU KNOW WHAT TRIALS DO? Trials do for for a tree that doesn't have any trial. His roots are not getting deeper. &gt;&gt; But a tree sometimes you go through wind and tempest and every time that you see a trial coming, that tree is putting the root deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper DEEPER DEEPER DEEPER. THANK GOD THAT YOU ARE HELPING ME TO PUT my roots deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper because I CANNOT BE SHAKEN. I CANNOT BE MOVED. I'M planted near the river of THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; I CAN NEVER BE MOVED. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR THE kingdom that can never be shaken. &gt;&gt; The world will die, but I will not die. &gt;&gt; I will keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; God bless you richly. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's give a hand to the Lord this morning. Amen. Musicians can come by the sing. Let's sing few verses.

[music] [music] Let's praise the Lord and thank him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For planting us in by the water of [music] the word of God. Thank you Lord Jesus Christ for the word. Thank you father Lord for [music] the comfort you have given us Lord that heaven and earth would pass away but your word shall never pass away. Father if we stay with the word of God we shall always [music] be overcomers. Many example in the Bible Lord to give us an encouragement father. Lord in even our time Lord we can see the time of Abraham. Oh Lord Jesus Christ through many years he waited he waited but the promise of God had to come to be fulfilled because he stayed with the word. One thing that God can never fail is fail [music] upon his upon his own word. Father we love you Lord Jesus Christ. We appreciate you. Thank you for bringing that kingdom into our heart. Thank you father Lord for the new birth. Thank you father for the walk with you. Thank you for the revelation. Thank you, Father, for the healing. Thank you, Father, for salvation.

Let that stone in our heart continue to increase, to grow, to take prance in our life as you said, Father, in your word, oh God. Lord, you came to do the threefold purpose for the bride to have yourself to be expressed through Jesus Christ [music] to express into the bride and father to the return of the kingdom of God.

My [music and singing] hope is in you. &gt;&gt; We will learn this song next time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You are the rock in time of trouble. I like that. You lift me up when I'm down. You lift me up. Amen. You know that song that uh um &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; um I don't I forgot the words but I'm looking for the melody. Uh I know okay I'm losing but um all the other hand is only seeking sand. You're not [music] exactly exactly [music] nothing else. Why there no [singing and music] justice sweet and strength but only [music] know Jesus on [singing] Christ. [music] [singing] [music] darkness [music and singing] to my face. I rest in [music] every highest. [music] I am the holy gra [music] [music] and his blood on &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Where are my soul [music] [singing] Christ is holy [music] for Christ. [singing] No other ground is s [music] [singing] [music] when he shall come with his son. Oh may I [music] praise his righteousness [singing] alone who rest to stand [music] before the throne. Oh Christ is holy [music] for Christ. Oh, and the ground is [singing] sinking sand. All [music] the ground is sinking sand. She ready. [music] As the sister comes, I just want to read Act chapter 2. You can have a seat for a moment just act chapter 2 is when Peter was mentioned when I was preaching came Acts 2:37 he was preaching and telling them that they crucified the Messiah. So they when they heard what what was preached 37 the Bible says then when they heard this that's why the baptism has to come after you have heard the word of God you cannot baptize a child doesn't know the word of God it's nothing you can repent about so it's nothing to prickle the heart there's nothing to make him take a decision so that's why when we were baptized in the Catholic as a child it was wrong because was not according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; So um you have to hear the word of God and align with the word of God. Accept the word of God. Say God your word is the truth and then what you manifest decision in your heart. What something happened in your heart. The baptism is an expression of what has happened in your heart that you you show it publicly that now I am decided to follow the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, repent. Repent first. So the baptism have to start by a true repentance. Repentance means is a change of directions. Means I've going this direction. I realize now it's a wrong direction. Maybe you are not sinful. Not not necessarily that you are a wrong person like the our dear is a Christian is coming is a very nice little girl I I I like her a lot very sweet and nice and no she's a she didn't anything wrong many speaking said but she realized no I can't depend on my own lord I make a decisions to follow you this is a public expressions of what I have in my heart amen says uh repent Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, the forgiveness of sins and then and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So there's a promise if you baptized is a manifestation from what happened in your heart and God is bound to his own word to give you the gift of the Holy Ghost and he will give you the gift of the Holy Ghost. I like the next part too. For the promise is unto you, said to the one he was talking to. And I said, even to you, not only to you, but to your children as well, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. And God is still calling today. &gt;&gt; Christian is is a response of the call of God. And she's answering God. Thank God for the answer. Thank God for the word of God. Now I respond to that word. Amen. And with many others word did he testify and exhort, saying, "Save yourself from this untored untored generation." And then they that gladly received his word were baptized. &gt;&gt; And the same day they were added unto them about 3,000 souls. Today one soul will be added. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as we are rejoicing, the angels are rejoicing. Thank God we have one who came into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Thank God. So, Satan is defeated one more time. &gt;&gt; And we show that to the devil that thank God, God has called someone today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my go again to Romans. Romans 6. Romans 6 chapter Romans chapter 6 verse3 says know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism unto death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have being planted together in the likeness of his death. We shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; So the baptism is not only uh a sprinkle in the head. That's not baptism. Actually baptism comes from the Greek word if I'm not mistaken Greek word means immersed. You have to be immersed completely. So it's a sign of completely death. So you die completely under that's your old that your past that your nature you die to the old nature and then you come out in the newness of life &gt;&gt; as a symbol now it's a new person the one the old Christian is gone will be gone now the new Christian will come out amen through the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; that's why the baptism has to be through the water completely under immersion amen you have you will help me give you some soft good songs Bring them in. &gt;&gt; Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the ones from hell. &gt;&gt; Sorry [music] to Jesus. Bring in. Bring them in. Bring the meat on the field of seed. Bring the meat. [music] Bring them in. Bring the wandering ones to [music] Jesus. Oh, bring them in. Bring them [music] in. Bring them in. From the [music] fields of sin. Bring them in. [music] Bring them in. Bring [singing] the [music] abundant ones to Jesus. Sister Grace, if you can comment. Father, [singing] you never [music] [singing] leave me. No matter where [music] I go, he knows my [singing] name. &gt;&gt; He knows [music] my everything. The Lord. He sees [music] each that [singing] falls and comes me where [music] I go.
