[39:16] important part. Let brother Steve take
[39:19] over right away and thank you for for
[39:21] for the for all the worship. God bless
[39:24] you richly. Brother Steve, let's sing
[39:26] the same song he has. Oh,

[39:37] me.
[39:43] [Music]
[39:49] Blood of the lamb
[39:54] of Calary.
[39:59] He
[40:01] has
[40:03] forgiven
[40:06] me. I know that he
[40:10] he has
[40:13] for
[40:14] [Music]
[40:15] me.
[40:17] My sin has been washed for his lambary
[40:27] by the blood of the lamb
[40:32] of Calary.
[40:37] He
[40:39] has
[40:41] forgiven
[40:43] me.
[40:46] [Music]
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we are
[40:49] coming into your presence this morning
[40:52] knowing that we've been forgiven. Lord,
[40:56] &gt;&gt; more than that, Lord, we've been
[40:58] justified.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, we know, Lord, that in your eyes,
[41:03] we never did it in the first place.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:07] And
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, we've been restored to be standing
[41:09] in your presence, Lord.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; And I pray, Lord, that you may come down
[41:13] this morning and as you already did
[41:15] through the worship, but now we're
[41:17] looking forward, Lord, for you to come
[41:19] down through your word and teach us and
[41:21] guide us in all truth as you promise.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Be with us this morning and take every
[41:27] spirit under your control because Lord,
[41:29] we are united in this desire. We want
[41:32] your spirit to move
[41:33] &gt;&gt; to move in our lives, Lord. And we don't
[41:35] want to leave any door closed and uh any
[41:37] rocks unturned, Lord. We we want you,
[41:40] Lord, to to be to have the freedom to
[41:42] move in our lives and in our families,
[41:44] in our marriages, Lord, because you have
[41:47] the keys of all those things. And may
[41:49] you help us this morning as we surrender
[41:51] oursel to you.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Give us Lord a good time in your word.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; I pray Lord in Jesus name. Amen.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning.
[42:02] Certainly happy to be in the house of
[42:03] the Lord again and to be with you. And
[42:05] so this is our second service. I don't
[42:07] know if there's a lot of new people this
[42:10] morning that were not there last night.
[42:12] Last night we kind of did an an
[42:14] introduction and I I thought we would be
[42:18] able maybe to dive right away last night
[42:20] but I just felt that the Holy Spirit
[42:23] made us dwell into the church transition
[42:26] the pastor's office and also a little
[42:28] bit to deal about sometime the
[42:30] misunderstanding that we have in our
[42:31] ranks about how we view the message and
[42:35] how this this prophetic can al also be
[42:40] scaled down to be appliable in your in
[42:44] our houses, in our marriages, in our
[42:46] families. And I explained last night how
[42:49] much of a a burden I have for families
[42:52] coming from a broken background,
[42:55] fatherless home and many different
[42:57] things has caused many hardship for me.
[43:01] And as God dealt with me and to bring
[43:03] answers and and healing, it became a
[43:06] burden to share with the the people of
[43:09] God. And I've been had the privilege to
[43:11] do it. in many places around the world
[43:13] and know Moses heard me in Edmonton and
[43:16] different places, family camps and so he
[43:19] wanted me to come and just to share and
[43:21] open my heart and so this morning we
[43:23] will go right into some um I'd say basic
[43:28] principles of the word of God that are
[43:31] appiable for our life and it's my my
[43:34] prayer that this would be a help.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So um we will turn in the book of
[43:40] Genesis chapter 2 24
[43:43] as our opening scripture. So
[43:45] unfortunately I won't be able to repeat
[43:47] everything I said last night. So if you
[43:49] if you're jumping on board this morning,
[43:51] well you have to you have to jump in
[43:55] with us. Amen. Genesis chapter 2 verse
[43:59] 24.
[44:07] So I want to thank brother Moses for his
[44:09] invitation and also I really felt last
[44:12] night that we were free and at ease just
[44:14] to share those things and we had I
[44:17] believe a wonderful atmosphere
[44:20] &gt;&gt; and and that is that is a blessing
[44:21] because we can all relax in the presence
[44:23] of God. No tension no and just hear what
[44:27] God has for us. Amen. Genesis chapter 2
[44:30] verse 24.
[44:32] Therefore shall a man leave his father
[44:35] and his mother, and shall cleave unto
[44:38] his wife, and they shall be one flesh.
[44:45] And
[44:47] since we're there, we can also uh go uh
[44:51] just a little bit before at verse 18. So
[44:54] this morning, I'm going to use both of
[44:55] those scriptures to lay some principle.
[44:59] And as you can see, we're in the book of
[45:01] Genesis. This is where it all starts.
[45:03] And we will have also have to go to the
[45:06] genesis of our life where everything
[45:08] started when we were a child.
[45:10] A lot of problem we face today are
[45:13] related to the genesis of our life. A
[45:15] lot of problems we face in this society
[45:17] 2025, they try to fix problems in 2025
[45:21] with 2025 solution. It doesn't work. A
[45:25] prophet brought us back to Genesis and
[45:27] revealed the mystery of the trauma
[45:32] &gt;&gt; our world and our society and and and
[45:34] and in human nature and human creature
[45:37] experience a trauma in the book of
[45:39] Genesis.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; And then it got hidden. Nobody knows
[45:42] what happened.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; It was an apple. It was this. It was
[45:45] that. No, no. something happened so
[45:48] seriously that it jeopardized
[45:50] &gt;&gt; and threw off course
[45:53] &gt;&gt; everything after that
[45:55] &gt;&gt; you got to go back to the genesis of the
[45:57] problem
[45:58] &gt;&gt; so if this applying for this world and
[46:01] our civilization it applies to our lives
[46:04] too
[46:05] &gt;&gt; amen so that's why we start with the
[46:06] book of Genesis so Genesis chapter 2:18
[46:09] and the Lord God said it is not good
[46:12] that the man should be alone
[46:15] I will make him help me for him. Amen.
[46:19] May the Lord add the blessing upon the
[46:21] reading of the word. You can be seated.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; You might pull my PowerPoint. Thank you,
[46:26] brother. Want to thank that tech text
[46:28] tech support in the back. They're doing
[46:29] an amazing job. I felt like this morning
[46:32] there's a special theme that outside of
[46:35] all the the songs were about the Lord
[46:37] and all thing. I kind of find a a trend
[46:39] of of there's a lot of French songs. So
[46:42] I felt really I felt felt at home here.
[46:45] Felt at home with all those French song.
[46:47] For those who doesn't know me, I'm from
[46:48] Quebec. So I'm a French Canadian and so
[46:51] all our service back home is French. I
[46:53] preach in French all the time. And so we
[46:55] felt at home this morning with many
[46:58] wonderful songs. Amen. So for those who
[47:00] were not there last night, so I got I
[47:02] got a great burden for families first of
[47:05] all because I come from a broken one. no
[47:07] sibling, no father, just a mother and
[47:09] try to make it. I was raising the
[47:11] message and and and and then I married a
[47:14] pastor's daughter who came from a family
[47:17] of five, raised with two wonderful
[47:19] parents and a and a good balanced
[47:21] church. And and me, the broken guy,
[47:25] comes in happy to serve the Lord and
[47:27] have the Holy Spirit, but a bit a bit
[47:29] clueless about family. Doesn't know what
[47:31] a father's supposed to do. And and and
[47:34] and living on my own all my life. Um,
[47:36] I've read the scripture. It's not it's
[47:38] not good for men to be alone. I can talk
[47:39] about loneliness.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; I was raised with that overwhelming
[47:44] feeling of loneliness. So, I can talk
[47:46] about loneliness, how it's not good and
[47:48] it was it was not God's plan for us
[47:50] because he saw Adam and Adam was alone.
[47:52] He says that's not good for you. It's
[47:54] it's not good for anyone. So, as we're
[47:57] starting to have one kids, two kids, I'm
[47:59] clueless is what I'm getting into. And
[48:02] on the third kids, that's where I
[48:03] realized, okay, that I'm missing
[48:06] something here.
[48:08] Uh, and and and it was a great
[48:10] adjustment for me. My wife was all
[48:12] happy. That was her life, you know, the
[48:14] house full of kids. For me, it was like,
[48:16] whoa.
[48:18] And so I had to go through a lot of
[48:20] unlearning
[48:22] and then a lot of learning
[48:24] not to wreck those wonderful
[48:28] children.
[48:30] I had to change course after the third
[48:31] kid. I had to change course because I
[48:34] was heading the wrong way. And so a lot
[48:36] of things that on my heart as a pastor
[48:38] and having teach on family many places
[48:41] and it's I preach that in many places
[48:44] not because that's the only thing I
[48:45] preach about but I get invited because
[48:48] of that because people feel that I have
[48:51] something to share and it it comes from
[48:53] a burden. And so we've we've had the
[48:56] privilege to raise those four daughters
[48:59] and a and a son in in the presence of
[49:02] God. We did we did many mistakes, but
[49:04] when you learn the principles, you catch
[49:06] your mistakes quickly.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; And then by God's grace, you're like,
[49:10] "Okay, I just crossed this principle
[49:12] here." And if and I and I and if if I
[49:14] keep crossing that principle, I'm going
[49:17] to reap something bad. I need to undo
[49:19] this. Also, a problem we have a lot with
[49:22] parents, and I went through that myself,
[49:24] is that when we realize we're not going
[49:26] it the right way with our kids, we
[49:28] change course, but we don't inform our
[49:30] children.
[49:33] We kind of put it under the carpet. It's
[49:35] like, oh, that's a bad way I'm going to
[49:36] do this. But we don't resolve the
[49:38] confusion in their minds like, yeah, dad
[49:40] used to be this way. He never said a
[49:42] word, but then he changed like he why
[49:44] was it? Was it me? Was it him? He's too
[49:46] full. he's too proud to kind of
[49:49] acknowledge that he made a mistake. And
[49:51] there's this idea that if if if parents,
[49:54] you know, go to their kids to apologize
[49:56] because they they went at it the wrong
[49:58] way that that would jeopardize their
[49:59] authority. And then that's wrong. That's
[50:01] wrong. It's actually it's the contrary
[50:03] cuz we don't fool the kids like inside
[50:05] of them. They know like he was wrong,
[50:07] now he's doing it differently and that
[50:08] doesn't say a word like nobody knows. We
[50:11] all know it. Then the kids talk to each
[50:13] other like, you know, dad, you know, he
[50:14] used to be this way. And then he never
[50:16] said a word. Like what's the problem? Is
[50:18] that humility? And and so I've I've
[50:21] learned to sit with my kids and do
[50:22] family counsel. And it's like, you know,
[50:24] dad was doing this and that's not the
[50:26] way. It didn't please the Lord. So we're
[50:28] going to change course. And you know
[50:29] what it caused? It doesn't remove your
[50:31] authority. It build respect in your
[50:33] children. It's like, okay, if my dad
[50:35] allow himself to make mistake and own
[50:38] it, then I'm allowed to make mistake and
[50:40] own it myself.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Then as parents, then we going to blame
[50:43] our children. Why? Why don't you ever
[50:44] own your mistake? Then the child's
[50:46] confused like, "Yeah, what's my
[50:48] problem?" Well, we see as we see the we
[50:51] do as we see the father doing. That's a
[50:53] biblical principle. Jesus said, "I'm I'm
[50:56] I'm doing what I see the father doing."
[50:59] That's a law.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; And so, we don't all just hear the words
[51:05] of our parents. We do what they
[51:07] &gt;&gt; we do what they do. So, I'm getting way
[51:09] ahead of myself. So there's a lot of
[51:11] pull in in this place right now there.
[51:13] People are hungry.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we we set last night a sets of
[51:18] sets of rules. We just want to go
[51:20] quickly. But none of none of the
[51:22] principles and you kind of got a taste
[51:24] last night how can it be it can be
[51:26] really sensitive and those can be used
[51:28] as a weapon to attack parents, pastor
[51:30] blame somebody. So none none of the
[51:32] content the material we want to bring in
[51:35] the word or principles are there to
[51:37] blame parents member at church blame the
[51:39] pastor blame somebody it's not about to
[51:41] blame it's about first of all to
[51:43] understand those principles it's to get
[51:45] corrected if if we have to change course
[51:48] and then it's also to find healing or
[51:50] say okay okay that I was raised in this
[51:52] and and and then that for the first time
[51:53] I hear that that's not God's way
[51:57] God says Jesus said I came to heal the
[51:59] brokenhearted there is any broken people
[52:02] then it's all linked to childhood.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; So God's God is interested to resolve
[52:08] the confusion in our mind because many
[52:11] people were raised in confused family.
[52:13] Well they love the Lord. They went to
[52:15] church but back home it was not 10 on
[52:18] 10. It was it was there was a lot of
[52:20] confusion.
[52:21] Uh I was causing a lot of confusion in
[52:24] my own house. I was preaching I filled
[52:27] with the Holy Ghost and God was moving
[52:29] in the ministry. But when I was stepping
[52:31] inside the home, I was causing more
[52:33] despair than good because of a mindset
[52:36] of how I think family should be run. I
[52:39] was I was I was working against
[52:43] my own interest and I didn't know it. So
[52:46] we can be great at church and have great
[52:48] faith and all so maybe we can have
[52:49] effective ministry, but that doesn't
[52:51] give you success at home. Ask Moses.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; His own son was not circumcised.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; He did. He did he did such an amazing
[53:01] thing. He brought Pharaoh to his knees
[53:03] through the power of God. Opened the
[53:05] opened the the the river and and and led
[53:08] like he's a leader. But when he go back
[53:10] home and you think that God gave him a
[53:12] pass? No. He sent an angel says you have
[53:14] this great ministry but you're not even
[53:15] taking care of your son
[53:18] &gt;&gt; and he had a wife to step on the scene
[53:20] and and did it for him.
[53:24] And so it's not and I think that
[53:27] sometime we have this we have that
[53:28] thought that because we're Christians
[53:30] and because we believe the message we
[53:32] get it pass. Well I applied the token so
[53:35] everything's going to be fixed by
[53:36] itself. We got to get rid of this
[53:38] magical thought. Family is work.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; It's how much you invest. This is how
[53:45] much you're going to reap.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; So, it's a family series that won't be
[53:50] much of a series because we have we have
[53:52] little like we have just this morning
[53:54] and tonight and last night was more like
[53:56] an introduction. I thought that we could
[53:58] dive in, but I felt the Holy Spirit kind
[54:00] of make us go different avenues. So, we
[54:02] want we don't want to come with a with a
[54:04] set of program. We want to follow the
[54:06] leading of the Lord.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; But I feel like this morning we have
[54:08] green light. So, we're diving. Amen.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Okay. So one principle and so we're
[54:14] going to lay few principles
[54:16] and the reason is it is really hard to
[54:19] be a parent. It's really hard to be a
[54:20] husband and it's really hard to be a
[54:22] wife unless we know oursel
[54:25] actually we read the verse yesterday in
[54:27] book of Ephesians where where where God
[54:30] is asking the husband to love his wife
[54:32] as you love yourself.
[54:34] So the capacity that's a law that's a
[54:36] principle in the Bible love your
[54:38] neighbor as you love yourself. So the
[54:41] capacity or being able to love somebody
[54:44] is related. How do you view yourself? So
[54:47] if you don't know yourself, you don't
[54:49] know your makeup, you don't know where
[54:51] you come from.
[54:53] It's really hard to be able. So myself,
[54:56] I came from a broken past, but I didn't
[54:58] know I was broken.
[55:00] I thought I was fine because I was a
[55:02] Christian and and I married a wonderful
[55:04] person and I was effective in many areas
[55:07] of my life. And so I thought I was fine,
[55:10] but I didn't realize that family-wise
[55:13] and father-wise I was I was broken. And
[55:16] because I I was broken, I didn't know. I
[55:19] didn't realize I couldn't love my my my
[55:22] children properly.
[55:25] Because it was part of myself was not
[55:28] doing good. Okay. So one principle here
[55:32] is then uh when there's a law here that
[55:37] a man shall leave his father and his
[55:39] mother and shall cleave unto his wife
[55:41] and they shall be one flesh. So this
[55:43] word cleave mean they going to bind
[55:45] together. Okay so God's purpose so if
[55:48] you're going to bind with your wife and
[55:50] become one it means that before that you
[55:53] were bind with your parents and before
[55:56] you were bind with your parents you were
[55:58] one with your mother. We don't have time
[56:00] this morning to talk about the
[56:02] transition. As a young age, you're a son
[56:04] or a girl are one with the mother. They
[56:06] were inside. They're they're so linked.
[56:08] They're so synchronized. They're so
[56:10] together. Like almost like when they get
[56:12] born, uh the the the father is almost
[56:15] like a stranger.
[56:18] I'm sure you brothers know how it feels.
[56:19] Uh when when it's baby, you take it, he
[56:22] cries, and he cries. You give it to mom
[56:24] and he's happy. He's like, "Okay, well,
[56:25] I guess I'm just a visitor here."
[56:28] And we don't realize that our season
[56:30] comes later
[56:32] &gt;&gt; and sometime sometime we get discouraged
[56:34] like I got discouraged at one point
[56:36] because it feels like well they're not
[56:38] my children there's they're Esther's
[56:40] children
[56:42] and and I didn't realize that it was
[56:44] there's a season for the mother and and
[56:47] not that that one is totally not there
[56:49] and but but they get me there's a season
[56:51] where they relay at a young age is
[56:53] mostly about the mother but that's going
[56:55] to take a turn at at one point right
[56:58] around the age of 12. That's exactly
[57:00] what Jesus went through. He went to the
[57:03] temple and then Mary's like, "Where's my
[57:04] baby boy? Where's where's my baby
[57:06] Jesus?" Well, Jesus was not a baby
[57:08] anymore. But she ran tried to protect
[57:11] him. Oh, where is he? Where is he? And
[57:13] then Jesus stepped in and he said, "I'm
[57:15] about my father's business." So somehow
[57:18] there was a transition where where Jesus
[57:20] turned from his mother to the father.
[57:24] And that transition is so important. And
[57:27] there's a series I've preached just on
[57:29] that. We that's not the topic this
[57:31] weekend but it's it's just to say that
[57:33] and then from there from the mother to
[57:36] the father then the man or the woman
[57:38] will cle the woman will cleave to a
[57:40] man's vision and they'll become a
[57:43] separate unit or the man will come will
[57:46] will go from the mother transition to
[57:48] the father which a lot of transition are
[57:51] fail because this concept is totally
[57:54] missed and especially North America in
[57:57] North America we don't understand the
[58:00] principles of what is a father, what is
[58:02] his role.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; That's why that's why there's many
[58:05] fathers who quit.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Uh they just walk away. My father just
[58:09] walked away and so they walked away
[58:11] because they don't realize the role they
[58:13] have.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; We have example in the Bible because God
[58:17] when Jesus got baptized, God steps and
[58:20] trinitarian really like that because for
[58:22] them it separates God's and tree three
[58:24] but but it's not the idea of a trinity.
[58:26] It's the idea of a principle that the
[58:29] voice of God as a father said about his
[58:32] son. This is my son in whom I love. He's
[58:37] my beloved.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; And so what he's doing is that the
[58:41] father and that's a law and many culture
[58:44] has this ceremonial transition around 12
[58:48] years old. This ceremony where the boy
[58:50] has to leave the mother and go to the
[58:53] father. and he's been called in the
[58:55] men's world. And when you don't have
[58:57] that ceremony, you have a lot of men
[59:02] that are being little boys inside, stuck
[59:05] in a woman's world. And that's why they
[59:07] struggle so much with women because
[59:10] they're never been called out of the
[59:12] woman's world to become real men. And so
[59:15] he's a little boy inside and he's stuck
[59:17] in a woman's world and stuck in the
[59:19] denominational world because he's never
[59:21] been called out.
[59:24] But that principle has been laid by God
[59:26] when he said not only once but he said
[59:28] it twice showing the progression in the
[59:31] sun first of all it says this is my son.
[59:33] There's many men here still waiting for
[59:36] their dad to say this is my son and I'm
[59:38] so proud of him
[59:40] &gt;&gt; but that day never came and because of
[59:43] that you have a little boy confused
[59:44] inside still waiting to be called by the
[59:47] father and praise the lord that there's
[59:50] amazing grace. My father never called me
[59:52] out, but one day caught God did.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; And as as as this special song we heard
[59:57] this morning, we are in our father's
[59:59] house.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; And so you're not doomed. You're not
[1:00:02] you're not you're not cursed if your dad
[1:00:04] never did it because God wanted us to
[1:00:06] step in on the scene and say this is my
[1:00:08] son.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; But God did it. God did it twice
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; and then he he put him in a position. We
[1:00:15] understand those things. But those
[1:00:17] things are not just like big prophetic
[1:00:19] big thing. As I said, we need to be able
[1:00:21] to use those great big principle
[1:00:24] prophetic large like spiritual thing and
[1:00:26] scale it down to understand that if
[1:00:28] those were there, they need to be
[1:00:30] applied in the natural. Yeah.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; So once once the father call
[1:00:39] the son
[1:00:41] then the son's going to be become a unit
[1:00:44] by itself and then he's going to get
[1:00:46] attached
[1:00:47] to
[1:00:49] his wife and then become one. So there's
[1:00:52] there's something that needs to happen.
[1:00:58] And so another key, another principle,
[1:01:02] those are not just simple scripture. You
[1:01:04] have to see those as laws of nature.
[1:01:11] Train up a child in the way he should go
[1:01:13] and when he is old, he will not depart
[1:01:15] from you. We we we hear a lot that
[1:01:17] scripture when when when a teenager goes
[1:01:20] astray or something goes bad, then we
[1:01:22] claim this scripture and rightfully so
[1:01:25] that well I train up the kid, right? and
[1:01:28] so it's going to turn out right so I put
[1:01:30] my trust and yes I agree but we need to
[1:01:33] understand that sometime we're like I
[1:01:37] train up the child the right way so we
[1:01:40] think and because we brought him to
[1:01:42] church we brought him to Sunday school
[1:01:44] we read Bible story but we're going to
[1:01:46] listen we going to we're going to study
[1:01:48] this morning how the prophet explained
[1:01:50] that God requires more than us than just
[1:01:54] to read Bible story and bring the kids
[1:01:56] to church It's not a guarantee of
[1:01:59] success because there's many thing in
[1:02:01] the recipe that need we need to do in
[1:02:03] which the prophet explained but as I
[1:02:06] explained last night we don't have time
[1:02:07] there's a great misunderstanding in our
[1:02:09] ranks we've we've went so spiritual and
[1:02:13] so prophetic that we've missed the
[1:02:16] simple principle of family life and call
[1:02:19] that psychology and a bunch of
[1:02:22] nothingness and this is just material
[1:02:24] for denomination. We're the bride. We're
[1:02:26] above this.
[1:02:28] until the family totally collapsed and
[1:02:29] like we're like and then we're confused.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're going to study
[1:02:37] those principles this morning.
[1:02:40] And and and and so
[1:02:44] God never intended for you to feel or to
[1:02:48] be lonely. Says the preacher was lonely
[1:02:51] all his life.
[1:02:54] So, it's not good for a human being to
[1:02:56] be alone. And we read that in that
[1:02:58] scripture. Now,
[1:03:01] is it amazing that when God says that to
[1:03:04] Adam,
[1:03:06] because I hear that sometime, well, I
[1:03:08] don't need nobody in my life. I have I
[1:03:10] have God. I'm a son of God. I have God.
[1:03:12] That's all I need. Well, I'm sorry to
[1:03:14] tell you that God disagree with you
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; because Adam was a son of God living in
[1:03:18] a perfect garden in a perfect body born
[1:03:21] straight out of the word of God.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; But he was alone.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; He had the greatest connection with God
[1:03:26] a human being ever had.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; But still he was alone. And when God
[1:03:31] looked at Adam, he says that loneliness
[1:03:33] will kill you in a sense. Not die, but
[1:03:36] it because it's not good. The word good
[1:03:39] is you will not prosper. You will not
[1:03:42] you will not do good
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; because God is love and he created man
[1:03:47] human being
[1:03:49] according to his image.
[1:03:52] And if God we heard that again big
[1:03:56] prophetic big thing God was alone with
[1:03:58] his thoughts wanted to express those
[1:04:01] attributes he wanted to be worshiped he
[1:04:03] wanted to have fellowship he transfer
[1:04:06] those things to us too. Amen.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; So we are creature of love like God is
[1:04:10] creature of love. He's not a creature.
[1:04:12] You understand? He's a being of love.
[1:04:14] And and we are also creature of
[1:04:16] fellowship. We need to communicate. We
[1:04:19] need to connect not only with God but we
[1:04:22] need a connection, a lateral connection.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; But when people want to be so spiritual
[1:04:27] and so up there, they're like, "Well, I
[1:04:29] don't need those. I don't need anybody."
[1:04:32] Well, some when when somebody talks like
[1:04:34] that, you can see that he's been hurt in
[1:04:36] the past because you're not born with
[1:04:37] that feeling.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; I don't need no one. I don't trust no
[1:04:40] one. I I I got God and that's good
[1:04:42] enough for me.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; It's not truth. You talk out of your
[1:04:47] pain.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; You're broken and you don't know and
[1:04:50] that's why you're like this. But God
[1:04:52] doesn't want you to be alone. And so
[1:04:54] loneliness will cause a lot of things
[1:04:58] where you'll you'll need to compensate.
[1:05:02] So
[1:05:03] few important principles before we
[1:05:05] really dies in in those things. So the
[1:05:08] other thing we need to understand is the
[1:05:10] subconscious. That's also an
[1:05:11] underestimated
[1:05:13] topic where the prophet thought on those
[1:05:15] things but the subconscious obviously is
[1:05:17] everything you're not aware of about
[1:05:19] yourself.
[1:05:22] Science has many expla explanation about
[1:05:24] the subconscious and and and and science
[1:05:27] says that it's it's it's the inner inner
[1:05:30] man that that you're you're you don't
[1:05:32] have access to but has it has recorded
[1:05:37] everything about you your life
[1:05:39] everything you saw everything you heard
[1:05:41] every feeling every smell everything and
[1:05:45] it's all there recording it's like a
[1:05:47] hard drive that you can't access you
[1:05:49] cannot access it and it's and then the
[1:05:53] conscious part. So science says and
[1:05:55] these are just numbers. I don't know if
[1:05:56] they're true but it's just to give you
[1:05:58] like a scale but science says that you
[1:06:01] know smart people really smart people
[1:06:03] would have three% maybe 5% I don't know
[1:06:06] the numbers but something like that of
[1:06:07] consciousness. So so you you're able to
[1:06:10] be aware of the three four 5% maybe all
[1:06:16] the rest you forget. You're like well
[1:06:18] that's just a fast well I know. Yeah, I
[1:06:20] know. I was, you know, I was raised and
[1:06:21] I was horrible. That's just the past
[1:06:23] like, you know, everything. And and many
[1:06:26] Christians sometime they think they they
[1:06:27] they forgave, but they just try to
[1:06:30] forgot it. They just try to forget it.
[1:06:32] They didn't forget. They they they never
[1:06:34] erased it. And in the greatest battle
[1:06:37] ever fought, the problem says that's the
[1:06:39] prophet says that's the problem with so
[1:06:41] many blowup Christians. It's because,
[1:06:44] we're going to read that quote later,
[1:06:45] but he says it's because they don't
[1:06:47] clean up the channels. Yeah,
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; the channels of memory, imagination, and
[1:06:52] so all those things that we went
[1:06:53] through, imagination, memories, and all
[1:06:55] that, it's all inside of us. And so
[1:06:57] there's many qu related to that that
[1:06:59] that would be like a full sermon by
[1:07:01] itself. We're just touching it quickly.
[1:07:03] But he says, you know, you got a
[1:07:04] subconscious, don't you? We are
[1:07:07] conscious of that. Well, no, we are not
[1:07:08] conscious of our subconscious. What he's
[1:07:10] trying to make us conscious, we have a
[1:07:12] subconscious.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Well, okay. So
[1:07:16] that's the fellow. That subconscious is
[1:07:19] causing you all the trouble tonight. It
[1:07:22] don't agree with this one out here. It's
[1:07:24] scared and backs up. And when it becomes
[1:07:26] in harmony with this one and this one
[1:07:29] becomes in harmony with God's word, then
[1:07:31] you're you're you're going. Then I'll
[1:07:33] give you an example how it works.
[1:07:36] I think one day there was a man who was
[1:07:38] wanted to to to he was doing a challenge
[1:07:41] that he would cross falls. I don't think
[1:07:43] I I don't remember if it was Niagara
[1:07:45] Falls, but anyway, it was Big Falls and
[1:07:47] it was a rope. And he says, "How many
[1:07:49] think?" And then he said he was able to
[1:07:51] to cross the falls with the with a
[1:07:54] wheelbarrow on a line,
[1:07:58] you know, on a rope across the falls.
[1:08:01] And there's journalists on the side and
[1:08:03] people watching. And then he asked the
[1:08:05] question to the crowd, "How many believe
[1:08:07] that I can cross those falls?" And
[1:08:09] everybody's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." A
[1:08:10] bunch of believers. Yeah.
[1:08:13] Then he asked the second question. How
[1:08:15] many wants to get in the wheelbarrow
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; and then he had a whole quiet bunch of
[1:08:20] people.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; So that's the difference between what
[1:08:24] you think
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; you believe
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; and the inside that when you're
[1:08:30] confronted with your belief, you're
[1:08:31] like, "Well, no, I'm not going."
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Something inside of you kicks in. It's
[1:08:36] like somebody that you know they're like
[1:08:38] young young, I don't know, young boys,
[1:08:40] they want to do something crazy. Hey
[1:08:42] guy, let's go bungee. You know what is
[1:08:43] bungee? You get attached to an elastic,
[1:08:45] you know, and and you dive off something
[1:08:48] to something really high and and yeah
[1:08:50] guys, that's going to be so fun. You
[1:08:51] know, getting the boys together and
[1:08:53] we're going bungee together and get and
[1:08:55] and all the guys, I don't know, they
[1:08:56] might be 10 guys. They all sure that
[1:08:58] every all the 10's going to do bunggees
[1:09:02] and then they get close to it and then
[1:09:04] they get the helmet and the arness and
[1:09:05] everything get attached and and then
[1:09:08] they all excited. Everybody believe a
[1:09:10] bunch of believers in bunggees.
[1:09:13] Then he steps on on the side. He's all
[1:09:15] harness and helmet. Yeah. Yeah, guys.
[1:09:18] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Selfie. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:09:20] Step is like, "Oh, oh my goodness."
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; What happened
[1:09:30] on the conscious part? He thought
[1:09:32] Bungie's great. But something inside
[1:09:36] says no.
[1:09:39] And this is the hardest thing to
[1:09:41] understand. Why did I thought I could do
[1:09:44] this?
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Why did I thought I could love my wife
[1:09:47] and be faithful? Why I could Why did I
[1:09:50] think that I could I could be there at
[1:09:53] home and I promise myself I'll never be
[1:09:55] like my dad and I'll stay at home and
[1:09:57] I'll play with my kids and I'll I'll put
[1:09:59] them a priority. And then when you have
[1:10:01] kids, you're do exactly the opposite.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet explained.
[1:10:06] That's the subconscious. There's
[1:10:08] something inside you that says no. And
[1:10:11] that's what happened to me. I started a
[1:10:14] family. I married a Christian girl,
[1:10:17] sister. I I started having kids. It's
[1:10:20] going to be great. I'll be a father
[1:10:21] until one kid, two kid, three kids. And
[1:10:23] something inside was saying no.
[1:10:26] I was so confused and I didn't know why.
[1:10:30] Then we can and if we're Christians and
[1:10:32] we're sincere then we start banging
[1:10:34] oursel we start whipping oursel and
[1:10:36] what's wrong with me and then the devil
[1:10:38] gets in and we feel guilt and shame and
[1:10:41] and because the prophet says that's your
[1:10:44] worst enemy.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; So when you hear the prophet says
[1:10:48] William Brahim is my worst enemy and you
[1:10:50] we understand that we are our worst
[1:10:52] enemy.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; What part of you you think is your worst
[1:10:56] enemy? It's that subconscious part that
[1:10:59] has recorded every trauma, everything
[1:11:02] you went through. And when we when we
[1:11:05] talk about trauma and I I made it I made
[1:11:08] it
[1:11:09] I make certain that I use modern words.
[1:11:13] Sometime people are so used to message
[1:11:15] words that they they missed the point.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; I am not afraid to use modern words.
[1:11:22] That's right.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; But trauma is something that is
[1:11:25] overlooked,
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; especially in our ranks because we think
[1:11:28] that when we got born again
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; that all the trauma got erased. But I
[1:11:34] got news for you. Prayer lines
[1:11:38] and discernment
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; proved that childhood trauma would be
[1:11:44] able to carry across your new birth.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; The prophet was with in prayer lines.
[1:11:50] The woman is nervous and the and the
[1:11:52] discernment would run back, right?
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, I see a dog.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; You're a little girl. This and that and
[1:11:59] made you nervous and you know, so a
[1:12:02] trauma in a genesis of our life that's
[1:12:04] hidden. That's what the Holy Spirit
[1:12:06] does. It will expose had it exposed the
[1:12:10] trauma of the creation in the garden of
[1:12:12] Eden because the devil his trick is
[1:12:14] always to come create a shock a trauma
[1:12:17] break your innocence and then covers his
[1:12:20] tracks
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; and that's why denomination the
[1:12:22] Christian world were lost because
[1:12:24] they're trying they're still trying to
[1:12:26] find the cause of sin why is our is our
[1:12:29] our creation and human nature this way
[1:12:31] and a prophet comes and the same spirit
[1:12:34] who could discern the genesis of the
[1:12:36] life of a little girl could also discern
[1:12:39] what went in the garden of Eden. So we
[1:12:42] can return and be restored and there is
[1:12:45] no restoration. That's why this message
[1:12:48] of restoration had to deal with the
[1:12:51] trauma of the book of Genesis. For us to
[1:12:53] return to Adam condition, we had to know
[1:12:56] how it got broke.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; But that's the big prophetic picture.
[1:13:04] Everybody says amen. But if we scale it
[1:13:05] down to your life, it's the same
[1:13:07] pattern. It's the same principle.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; So we could explain the the con
[1:13:15] subconscious and the conscious as the
[1:13:17] parable of the iceberg with brother
[1:13:19] Donnie Donnie Reagan preach a amazing
[1:13:21] message. I think he called it the
[1:13:23] parable of the iceberg. I think I took
[1:13:25] it from him. But preach I think one or
[1:13:28] two wonderful message on the
[1:13:29] subconscious
[1:13:30] and and subconscious is is like when you
[1:13:33] see iceberg The ice everything you see
[1:13:36] on top is just a little portion. When I
[1:13:38] see you, I see a what's above the water.
[1:13:42] But there's an inner world inside that
[1:13:44] have no clue. Maybe your spouse have no
[1:13:46] clue. Maybe you have no clue.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; And that is why the Bible says that the
[1:13:53] word is a discerner of the heart.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Why is the b the word? Because we cannot
[1:14:00] discern our own heart. Even David says,
[1:14:03] "Lord, seek my heart."
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; I'm still trying to find a scripture
[1:14:07] where the Bible says that we are able to
[1:14:09] seek our heart.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; We can try, but we don't have access to
[1:14:14] that.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz Jeremiah says our heart is deceitful
[1:14:17] above everything. And then when we see
[1:14:20] that scripture, it's like, "Oh yeah,
[1:14:21] when I was when I was a sinner, my heart
[1:14:23] was deceitful." No, no, no. The
[1:14:25] principle of deceitful mean it hides
[1:14:28] itself from his own owner. Yeah.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; So the heart is subconscious and that's
[1:14:33] why it's only when the word comes that
[1:14:36] we see ourselves in the mirror.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; That's why some people are afraid to be
[1:14:40] sitting on the real preaching of the
[1:14:42] word because it will expose their
[1:14:44] intention and their motive and why
[1:14:46] they're doing things. And well, every
[1:14:48] time I sit in church, I feel like I'm
[1:14:49] judged. Well, welcome. judgment start by
[1:14:53] the house of God because the word will
[1:14:55] judge discern your intention
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; or what you're about to do cuz we don't
[1:15:01] see oursel.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:03] David thought he had played a trick with
[1:15:05] Uriah's wife and Bath Sheba and all that
[1:15:07] and got him killed and all good good and
[1:15:09] now she's pregnant looks like all good
[1:15:11] and and then Nathan comes and when the
[1:15:13] prophet comes what he does he he he he
[1:15:16] preached the word because and then when
[1:15:19] when when when when the prophet gave him
[1:15:22] the example of the shepherd with one
[1:15:24] sheep many sheep David is like well you
[1:15:26] know we should kill that man for
[1:15:28] stealing this his only sheep like how
[1:15:30] clueless like he totally forgot God.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; But when the word says, "You are that
[1:15:36] man." Then the word exposed his heart,
[1:15:38] he was like, "Oh my goodness, I'm a
[1:15:40] mess."
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And because David was a accord a man
[1:15:46] according to God's heart. Sometime we
[1:15:48] think that a man according to God's
[1:15:49] heart, some not somebody's going to make
[1:15:51] any mistake. No, David made mistake. But
[1:15:54] the difference with David between Saul
[1:15:56] is that David when David was exposed to
[1:15:58] his mess and that his heart was
[1:16:00] discerned he would he would repent.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; That's what we need to do.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; So
[1:16:13] God wants to heal our hearts. That's
[1:16:15] what he says when in Luke he says,"I
[1:16:18] came to heal the brokenhearted."
[1:16:23] Well, I'm not broken. Well, God knows
[1:16:26] your state. Maybe you don't.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Maybe your wife knows or your husband
[1:16:32] knows. But then we don't want to listen.
[1:16:36] So, the prophet says, "We I we got the I
[1:16:38] got the biggest enemy. He's got I got is
[1:16:40] William Brham."
[1:16:42] And so, we got different quotes for
[1:16:43] that. We I just skipped because we need
[1:16:45] we got a lot of material this morning
[1:16:47] but you get you get the point. So that's
[1:16:49] a principle we want to remember is that
[1:16:51] the subconscious is running the show. He
[1:16:55] makes do things or don't do things based
[1:16:58] on on his own sets of rules
[1:17:02] that has been fashioned and patterned in
[1:17:05] your lifetime.
[1:17:10] traum the subconscious works by what he
[1:17:14] remembers.
[1:17:15] It's like a computer,
[1:17:18] you know, those in the computer world,
[1:17:19] you understand anti virus. Anti virus is
[1:17:22] that they're going to detect a threat
[1:17:24] and then that's why you always need to
[1:17:26] download the next new version of the
[1:17:28] anti virus because there's a new threat.
[1:17:30] So it defines itself to block this.
[1:17:32] Defines, okay, now we have not to block
[1:17:34] this. Now we have to block this. The
[1:17:35] problem with our with our subconscious
[1:17:37] and our heart is that if we don't
[1:17:39] forgive and and bring it to the Lord and
[1:17:41] erase it, it's going to become so much
[1:17:44] restrictive
[1:17:46] that it's going to block so many. That
[1:17:48] is why you have you have and and even
[1:17:50] the prophet says you don't want to crown
[1:17:52] your Christian life with a bitter
[1:17:53] spirit.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; But that's why there's people that as as
[1:17:57] as they go into life they can be
[1:17:59] Christian. They isolate themselves even
[1:18:00] more. They stop fellowshing fellowship
[1:18:03] because everybody's a threat. And then
[1:18:04] as they suffer from social phobia. Oh, I
[1:18:06] I hate to see people. They always, you
[1:18:08] know, and and and and what they don't
[1:18:10] know when they talk like that is their
[1:18:12] anti virus inside that tried to shield
[1:18:15] them from pain and shield them from
[1:18:17] disappointment and shield them from
[1:18:19] betrayal and shield them from this, from
[1:18:21] abuse, whatever they went through. And
[1:18:24] they never forgive. They just put it on
[1:18:25] the shelf shelf. But what they don't
[1:18:27] realize it that inside of them it's
[1:18:30] blocking blocking blocking blocking and
[1:18:32] making them so nervous and so anxious
[1:18:34] that everything is a threat.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Because they don't solve anything ever.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; There's a conflict. They run away. Oh, I
[1:18:43] hate those situations. Oh, I hate that.
[1:18:45] I hate that. And then at one point they
[1:18:47] can't move and they trap.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; That's why the greatest things we need
[1:18:51] in our life is forgiveness. True
[1:18:53] forgiveness. where we go to God with
[1:18:55] tears and say, "Lord, that really hurt
[1:18:57] me
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; and I gave you my heart. I was so
[1:19:00] disappointed, but Lord, take it. Forgive
[1:19:02] them." They didn't know what they did.
[1:19:03] And and to really go to a really
[1:19:05] cleaning of a heart
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; and when we don't do that, then the
[1:19:09] prophet says, "We have so many blow up
[1:19:11] Christians
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; because they don't clean the channels."
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; So God is a key for us to clean the
[1:19:18] heart and to heal the heart so we can
[1:19:21] remain free.
[1:19:24] Free for what? Free to love.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; The hardest things when we are hurt is
[1:19:29] to love.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; And last principle, no the fourth one
[1:19:38] which a lot of people don't like
[1:19:42] is that parents are responsible
[1:19:45] for juvenile delinquency. So this quote
[1:19:48] a lot of people says amen until they
[1:19:49] have they have kids themselves and then
[1:19:51] their kids start have a problem. Then
[1:19:53] when you tell that quote then then it's
[1:19:56] not a fun quote
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; but it's a rule it's a principle. So our
[1:20:02] prophet says okay I'm going the wrong
[1:20:04] direction here.
[1:20:06] Prophet says that what brought on
[1:20:08] juvenile delinquency was parents
[1:20:10] delinquency.
[1:20:12] The parent failing to take care of the
[1:20:16] children. The key word here is care.
[1:20:21] And we all have to define what care is.
[1:20:24] For many years, we thought care for a
[1:20:26] man was to bring put the paycheck on the
[1:20:28] table. And I done my job.
[1:20:32] I'm sorry, brothers, but when you put
[1:20:34] your paycheck on the table, it's just
[1:20:35] starting.
[1:20:39] Because if it was just about money, then
[1:20:41] it means rich people have great success
[1:20:43] with their families,
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; which is not often the case.
[1:20:50] So care is a totally different
[1:20:52] definition.
[1:20:55] I'll tell you I think today we have such
[1:20:57] juvenile crime wave across the nation
[1:20:59] but really I think it started in the
[1:21:00] home. I think the parents begin to let
[1:21:03] go. So that's a really an important
[1:21:05] principle and when I call it principle
[1:21:08] it's it's a law of nature. You cannot
[1:21:12] override those laws.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; It's like the law of gravity.
[1:21:17] If if a Christian
[1:21:19] jump off a 30-foot building and an
[1:21:23] unbeliever jump a 30-foot building, both
[1:21:26] of them will have to submit to the law
[1:21:28] of gravity.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Mo both of them will probably have
[1:21:32] broken legs.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; So Christian doesn't get a pass. It's
[1:21:37] not because you're a Christian and born
[1:21:39] again. You get a pass on laws of nature.
[1:21:43] And thus I think that's a great
[1:21:45] misunderstanding because we thought I
[1:21:47] love the god. I love Lord. I bring the
[1:21:49] kids my to the church and I I read them
[1:21:51] the Bible. So then it's the recipe for a
[1:21:53] great success. It's part of it.
[1:21:56] Obviously you need God in the house.
[1:21:58] It's a great thing. But how we saw
[1:22:01] brother Fandler last night. He's a
[1:22:04] Christian. He believed the message but
[1:22:05] then he tried to imitate the prophet and
[1:22:07] he's trying to cast a demon out of his
[1:22:09] wife every night. He could have done how
[1:22:11] how long you think he could have done
[1:22:12] that until he ran his marriage to the
[1:22:14] ground,
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; but he applied the word,
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; but he didn't know how to apply it.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; All right. And the last principle
[1:22:27] is that there is a cause
[1:22:29] to everything.
[1:22:31] Sometime some sometime you know uh the
[1:22:35] wife files for divorce the husband files
[1:22:36] for divorce the kids run away it's like
[1:22:38] I don't know it's just suddenly and and
[1:22:40] and when I counsel with people and in in
[1:22:43] which in the message we call interviews
[1:22:44] just to reassure you uh uh interviews
[1:22:47] when we sit with people and try to
[1:22:49] counsel them this is something that that
[1:22:52] I've heard many time I don't know what
[1:22:54] happened to my son like it's it's
[1:22:56] suddenly he turned wild suddenly like
[1:22:58] and and and we like that word suddenly
[1:23:01] because because then we don't feel
[1:23:03] responsible. It's like, you know, it's
[1:23:05] it's the devil, you know, it that spirit
[1:23:08] jumped on him and suddenly turned wild
[1:23:10] and like we we don't understand. We read
[1:23:13] in the Bible, we brought him to church
[1:23:14] and like, you know, there was no cause
[1:23:17] outside of suddenly.
[1:23:23] No, there's a cause. There's a chain of
[1:23:24] effect. And we're going to study that
[1:23:26] this morning.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:29] So prophet sometimes says we find people
[1:23:32] going prayer line out across the nation.
[1:23:34] They just run up and think that the Lord
[1:23:36] ought to heal them right then. But if
[1:23:38] said but there is something way down in
[1:23:40] there. We're talking about subconscious
[1:23:42] again. And we sat before the Lord until
[1:23:45] he reveals that what that is. And there
[1:23:47] is something there's a reason for
[1:23:49] everything. And you've got to find the
[1:23:52] reason first and then you can find what
[1:23:54] to work on. And we got a got have a
[1:23:57] great example when when when brother
[1:23:59] Brandham went through a crisis with his
[1:24:01] daughter Rebecca at 18.
[1:24:04] And maybe Lord willing, I don't know,
[1:24:05] but maybe Lord willing tonight we might
[1:24:07] study just tonight could be just to
[1:24:10] study the quote.
[1:24:12] Rebecca didn't start slapping door like
[1:24:14] oh suddenly she's slapping doors. No,
[1:24:19] when you read the quote suddenly realize
[1:24:20] something inside of her was boiling for
[1:24:23] many years.
[1:24:25] And then God, the prophet realized, oh,
[1:24:28] okay, we got to change course here.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; So there's a remedy when you understand
[1:24:33] what's going on inside of them. But we
[1:24:36] need to care because if you don't care,
[1:24:37] you'll never know.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Okay. So,
[1:24:44] seasons of innocence, uh, we did talk a
[1:24:47] little bit about it, so we don't have to
[1:24:49] dwell a long time on it, but we all had
[1:24:53] what we call a season of innocence.
[1:24:56] And in the garden of Eden, the prophet
[1:24:59] called it the God's economy of
[1:25:02] innocence. So, he says, call the garden
[1:25:04] of Eden, he says, notice what happened.
[1:25:06] The garden of Eden was God's economy of
[1:25:08] innocence. And that's what one of the
[1:25:10] dispensations. The first dispensation
[1:25:12] was innocent. The people know no sin and
[1:25:15] they didn't know anything about sin.
[1:25:17] Both Adam and Eve were naked and they
[1:25:19] were hid from their nakedness and but
[1:25:21] God, you know, had a veil in their own
[1:25:22] mind. They didn't know what was right
[1:25:23] and what was wrong. But they didn't know
[1:25:25] any evil either.
[1:25:27] And so if Adam and Eve went through that
[1:25:30] in our we had a season of our life that
[1:25:32] we also were in an age of innocence.
[1:25:36] And and I remember, you know, my
[1:25:39] you would some of the kids, it was so
[1:25:41] funny. You change you change your
[1:25:42] diapers and you got a just a moment you
[1:25:44] turn and then you're like an easy run.
[1:25:46] You run and like there was something
[1:25:48] about them young age like you removed
[1:25:50] the being naked and running everywhere
[1:25:52] was so fun.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; It's like come back here
[1:25:57] and it such an innocence. But at at at
[1:26:00] one point feel like doing that anymore.
[1:26:03] Something changed. They lost their
[1:26:05] innocence. Okay. So, at that age, you're
[1:26:09] so pure. Even though you're born in sin,
[1:26:13] you're so pure. You're so innocent. You
[1:26:15] think it's almost dangerous because you
[1:26:18] think everybody's nice. And then you
[1:26:19] have to warn them. If a stranger comes
[1:26:21] and wants to give you candy, say no sir,
[1:26:23] I don't want come to mommy. Let And you
[1:26:25] got to teach them that not you don't
[1:26:27] want to you don't want to traumatize
[1:26:28] them before. man. Well, you try to put
[1:26:31] in a way that, you know, trust just
[1:26:33] daddy and mommy and be careful. You go
[1:26:35] and you try to teach them without over,
[1:26:38] you know, being over the top, but like
[1:26:40] this is an evil world. You don't know
[1:26:41] yet. You'll you'll know later. And and
[1:26:44] you kind of don't want to break their
[1:26:46] innocence, but you want to you want to
[1:26:47] teach them. But that innocence,
[1:26:52] the devil wants like he did with the
[1:26:54] serpent came.
[1:26:56] The serpent was watching you
[1:26:59] as you watch Adam and Eve and says, "How
[1:27:01] can I step in and ruin that for good?
[1:27:04] How can I set this young girl or this
[1:27:06] young boy on the on the off of the track
[1:27:08] off track quickly?"
[1:27:11] And on top of that, how can I do this
[1:27:14] without their parents noticing?
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Because if if if mommy and and daddy
[1:27:20] realize that something inside just got
[1:27:22] broken, they're going to care. And love
[1:27:25] heals.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; But what if and I could in in Adam what
[1:27:29] what when Adam lost his innocence and
[1:27:31] Eve what did they do? They hid it
[1:27:33] because it comes with a shame. Whatever
[1:27:35] he did it it can be sin or but it can be
[1:27:39] also be trauma
[1:27:43] and we underestimate those things.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; We're going to study what happens after.
[1:27:50] So Satan's role is what? Is to pervert
[1:27:53] from innocence.
[1:27:56] And so
[1:27:58] that innocence was also in an
[1:28:01] atmosphere.
[1:28:03] So as we talk tonight, this morning,
[1:28:08] I'm talking to everyone right now as a
[1:28:12] kid. Don't think only about your kids.
[1:28:14] You have to think about yourself. You
[1:28:17] had a genesis of your life.
[1:28:20] You were shaped in environment.
[1:28:23] Some of you had a good environment. Some
[1:28:26] of you didn't have environment, a good
[1:28:28] one.
[1:28:30] But even in a good environment,
[1:28:33] I believe I raised my children in a good
[1:28:35] environment. And even though the serpent
[1:28:38] has tried many ways to come in different
[1:28:41] way to cause
[1:28:43] to cause hurt, to cause damage, to break
[1:28:46] something.
[1:28:48] and sometime to try to hide it from us.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; So
[1:28:57] let's talk about the relationship
[1:28:58] between a baby and a mother.
[1:29:01] As I said at the beginning of the
[1:29:02] service, when a baby is born, he is one
[1:29:06] with the mother. There's in in a such
[1:29:08] unity. You remember man shall leave his
[1:29:11] father and mother and cleave become one
[1:29:13] with his wife. Well, that oneness was
[1:29:16] with the mother. And that oneness, the
[1:29:19] prophet explained that it would bring so
[1:29:21] much satisfaction,
[1:29:23] so much quietness. It was it was the
[1:29:26] greatest the link as a baby, your link
[1:29:29] with your mother was the greatest
[1:29:32] pill for anxiety.
[1:29:35] Baby's anxious. Blah blah blah blah.
[1:29:37] Daddy takes it. Shake it. Shake it.
[1:29:38] Shake it harder. Come on. You At one
[1:29:40] point, you have to give up. Okay. Okay.
[1:29:41] Here's your anxiety pill. go see mama.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; And then the prophet says he's all
[1:29:48] satisfied,
[1:29:50] quietened. The mother picks him up and
[1:29:52] puts on her breasts and begins to hum
[1:29:54] and rock him back and forth and he feel
[1:29:57] his mother. and and and more than that
[1:30:00] science now is discovering with the with
[1:30:03] the raising of the cell phone and all
[1:30:05] that that that that when when a mother
[1:30:08] breastfeed
[1:30:10] and and the contact in the eyes looking
[1:30:12] the baby in the eyes bring calms the
[1:30:15] baby so much and science has just
[1:30:17] discovered that because now mom is on
[1:30:19] her cell phone she nurse but she's
[1:30:21] scrolling Facebook the baby's like
[1:30:23] nursing but she's baby's trying to find
[1:30:26] the eyes of the mother but can't find it
[1:30:28] and they realize realize that babies are
[1:30:30] more anxious
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; because there's not a connection.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; So the connection is broken too early
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; and and and science realize it makes it
[1:30:38] makes it sets the kid with already sets
[1:30:42] him up for anxiety because there's a
[1:30:44] loss of connection
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; and that loss of connection ties us back
[1:30:48] to the first principle. It's not good
[1:30:50] for men to be alone. Men being human
[1:30:52] being. So when that baby is drawing from
[1:30:55] the breast but there's no connection
[1:30:57] he's feel lonely he doesn't know it but
[1:31:00] something inside of him know him in the
[1:31:01] subconscious register you don't have to
[1:31:03] be smart and your brain might not be
[1:31:05] developed but at six month there's
[1:31:07] trauma that can be registered
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; there's register that that trauma
[1:31:11] registered when you were in your
[1:31:12] mother's womb
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; so the prophet explained and and those
[1:31:18] quotes we overlook for for for us we we
[1:31:20] we want we want to be so prophetic
[1:31:22] unless There's the word seal or to the
[1:31:24] third pool. We read read those quotes
[1:31:26] like like it's just a little side note
[1:31:27] like well this just a side note it's not
[1:31:29] a side note
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; he's laying principles simple ones but
[1:31:34] that we need to learn from these things
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:31:40] So that connection
[1:31:42] will make that baby satisfied and day by
[1:31:45] day he will grow stronger and stronger
[1:31:47] but not not just physically but
[1:31:49] emotionally because that is that's the
[1:31:52] problem right now. Um you humanity is
[1:31:55] not just weak physically but we are weak
[1:31:58] emotionally. Everything makes us anxious
[1:32:01] because something is broken.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; We lost track and we lost sense of
[1:32:06] fellowship and connection. Everybody is
[1:32:09] so connected
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; to everything else
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; than each other.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; And it's a trap. That is one of the root
[1:32:20] cause of anxiety because we are alone in
[1:32:25] a super connected world.
[1:32:30] You can be you can feel alone in a house
[1:32:34] full of people
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; because everybody's going at it but
[1:32:38] nobody cares really. You know I can ask
[1:32:41] brother Moses, hey brother, you know God
[1:32:43] bless you. How are you?
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; How are you? Well, you said very good
[1:32:46] but I don't care.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; How are you? You know, but if I come to
[1:32:50] brother Moses, brother Moses, amen.
[1:32:53] How's it going?
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Now look at me in the eyes.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Do you see the difference?
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Now I care.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; I want to know. Are you good? Are you
[1:33:01] good, bro? I'm with you.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Uh, hey, brother. God bless you. It
[1:33:04] doesn't mean that when we shake hands in
[1:33:06] the church, we're like looking for this
[1:33:07] connection and trying to But in the
[1:33:09] house, in the home, between a husband
[1:33:10] and a wife, between children, we we we
[1:33:13] like, "How was the day at school?" Oh,
[1:33:15] mama. Like, okay. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:33:16] Yeah. How was the day at school? You
[1:33:18] know, we're already doing something
[1:33:19] else. Or if we sit in the kitchen,
[1:33:23] sit down. Sit down. Put your put your
[1:33:25] school bag here. How was your day today?
[1:33:30] And if you want to know and you're
[1:33:31] interested and you have eye contact,
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; words going to come start coming up
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; connection. That's that's how we spell
[1:33:39] care.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; But the prophet what causes juvenile
[1:33:42] delinquency is the lack of care.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; It's not a lack of food, not a lack of
[1:33:46] roof, not a lack of reading the Bible, a
[1:33:48] lack of care.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Prophet preached two message.
[1:33:56] God cares. Do you care? And in those
[1:33:58] message he explains the the concept of
[1:34:01] complexes and things of the past that
[1:34:03] try to ruin marriages. The new the new
[1:34:07] that just came back from their honeymoon
[1:34:08] and already they were going astray.
[1:34:10] They're already falling apart and they
[1:34:12] went in the office and it's the prophet
[1:34:14] explained the complex was a dark shadow
[1:34:16] over this young man trying to bring
[1:34:17] something from the past.
[1:34:21] We bring baggage in our marriage because
[1:34:23] we don't understand.
[1:34:25] Both of them, both of us bring baggage
[1:34:28] in in in in in marriage that's going to
[1:34:31] hinder us.
[1:34:33] And so care is a big thing.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; And for that, you need a connection.
[1:34:40] And that connection is the thing that
[1:34:43] stopped the loneliness.
[1:34:45] I'm not alone in this. Somebody's in
[1:34:47] with me.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; So we need that in a marriage. We need
[1:34:51] that between the husband and the wife.
[1:34:53] We need to stop and connect.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; And it's important because if we had an
[1:34:57] argument during the day and we kind of
[1:34:59] shove it off and like, oh, I always
[1:35:01] laugh. We know that if we ask, "How do
[1:35:04] you do?" Well, she's going to come up
[1:35:05] again with this and it's unsolvable.
[1:35:09] And we developed this thing that to be
[1:35:12] able to connect, we have to agree.
[1:35:15] Mhm.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Do you know that you can put a
[1:35:17] disagreement on the side and tell I want
[1:35:20] you to know that I love you more than
[1:35:23] this disagreement?
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; I care for you more than I care for
[1:35:28] whatever opinion I'm trying for you to
[1:35:30] see.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; I care. Okay, we argue. You want a green
[1:35:34] car? I I I prefer red. I don't know what
[1:35:37] we're going to do with that, but let's
[1:35:38] put the red and the green on the side.
[1:35:41] And I want you to know because when
[1:35:43] there's do you know that the devil is an
[1:35:45] expert to fill the silence to fill the
[1:35:47] void
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; when you stop talking do you know the
[1:35:50] devil that's where he start talking
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; so when he does that's why those words
[1:36:00] you know how even as as God the father's
[1:36:03] role uh the father's office affirm his
[1:36:07] son with words we need to affirm our
[1:36:10] marriage marriage and affirm our
[1:36:11] children with words, caring words and
[1:36:15] that for that we need to be able to put
[1:36:17] aside disagreement. But sometime we cut
[1:36:19] fellowship until we solve if the god the
[1:36:22] car is going to be green or red. I'm
[1:36:24] giving a foolish example but we all have
[1:36:26] issues. We all have disagreement.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; We're doing renovation bought a house.
[1:36:32] It's a big project at home. You know
[1:36:35] that that's many many couple get
[1:36:37] divorced when while they're building a
[1:36:39] house.
[1:36:41] Many church split when they're building
[1:36:42] a new church program.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; It's a pattern. And you know why? It's
[1:36:47] because you have so many choices to do.
[1:36:49] And that's where you realize that you
[1:36:51] don't want the same thing and you don't
[1:36:53] like the same thing. And then the devil
[1:36:54] steps in and says you're not meant to be
[1:36:56] together.
[1:36:58] Me and my wife were so different.
[1:37:00] Sometime it's scary.
[1:37:03] It is. My wife was worried. She's like
[1:37:08] what unites us now? Obviously we love
[1:37:10] each other but our service for God
[1:37:13] unites us strongly. But if we talk about
[1:37:16] hobbies and we have different taste for
[1:37:19] she's an artist, she like painting. She
[1:37:21] likes drawing. I'm bad. I have no
[1:37:23] interest for that. I'm I'm in sport and
[1:37:25] I like computer. She hates computer. So
[1:37:27] we're trying to find something in
[1:37:29] common. My wife sometime we talk about
[1:37:30] she says, "Honey, I'm worried when we
[1:37:32] going to be retired. I'm wondering what
[1:37:34] we're going to do." like like, well,
[1:37:35] we'll see. We'll see. The Lord shall
[1:37:37] provide.
[1:37:41] And then we're doing renovation and we
[1:37:42] doing landscape and whatever I say. Oh,
[1:37:46] let's do it this way. No, it's not good.
[1:37:48] It's like, okay, okay, we'll do it your
[1:37:50] way. And then I think we should lay it.
[1:37:52] No, no, no, it's not good. It's like,
[1:37:53] well, is do I've got like, do I have
[1:37:54] like one good idea?
[1:37:58] And we can let those things pile up in
[1:38:00] frustration.
[1:38:02] And that's where at one point we need to
[1:38:04] stop and not to and that's where we we
[1:38:07] we exhaust oursel because we want to
[1:38:10] base our union on agreement
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; and seeing eye to eye which that is
[1:38:17] called a conditional
[1:38:19] union.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; God as we don't have a conditional
[1:38:22] agreement with him. He gave his life. He
[1:38:26] died for us while we were still a
[1:38:29] sinner. And that's where we understood
[1:38:31] it was only by grace. So we need to
[1:38:33] apply grace to our own couple that okay,
[1:38:36] we disagree on that. Let's put it on a
[1:38:37] shelf. Let's put it. Lord, let's pray
[1:38:38] over this. Lord, help us to solve this.
[1:38:40] But in the meantime, honey, I love you.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; I want to be with you. You're precious.
[1:38:46] I care.
[1:38:48] And so,
[1:38:51] Satan will fill the void, but we need to
[1:38:53] remain connected. So, I'm getting way
[1:38:55] ahead of myself. So, let's go back to
[1:38:56] the season of innocent. You're pulling
[1:38:58] me in all kind of direction.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:10] So he's talking about love. So you
[1:39:12] cannot do that. Everything I just said,
[1:39:16] you cannot do it until you have love.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Perfect love cast out all fear. Yeah.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; If I want to contribute anything to the
[1:39:26] success of the ministry among people is
[1:39:28] there's one thing. It's because that I
[1:39:30] love people
[1:39:31] and people knows that
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; this minister cares for me.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; He's not there to build his kingdom
[1:39:41] kingdom. He's not there to build a
[1:39:42] following. He is there because he cares
[1:39:45] so much for us. He wants me to be
[1:39:46] better. And because of that the prophet
[1:39:49] says this was the success of the
[1:39:50] ministry because I care and people know
[1:39:52] your wife know if you care.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; You remember the story prophet telling
[1:39:58] you know somebody
[1:40:00] brother leaves man leaves out the door
[1:40:02] to go work kiss his wife I love you
[1:40:04] walks then he returns back and he's like
[1:40:07] then he gives a real one
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; the first one like he's you're not
[1:40:10] connected. Have you done that before? is
[1:40:13] like you okay honey by and then you go
[1:40:16] it's like no honey come back I was not
[1:40:19] there now I'm there now I care
[1:40:23] connection
[1:40:25] it's it's a great fight it's a great
[1:40:28] battle to stay connected
[1:40:31] he says you you take a little three
[1:40:32] months baby the baby three months old he
[1:40:34] doesn't know nothing he's got a mind of
[1:40:36] that isn't developed he doesn't know
[1:40:38] nothing the doctor doctors say they can
[1:40:41] see light might see your hand but He can
[1:40:43] only follow it and he will just be
[1:40:44] kicking his little heels and screaming
[1:40:46] to the top of his voice. Well, here
[1:40:47] comes some kind of woman some along
[1:40:49] passing him says, "Well, dear." He just
[1:40:51] kicks right on. He don't know who the
[1:40:53] woman is. He don't know nobody. But let
[1:40:56] that mother walk up just put her hands
[1:40:59] on him. Now the prophet says his brain,
[1:41:01] it's not his brain who knows.
[1:41:03] He might he might barely be able to see
[1:41:05] because his vision is not yet developed.
[1:41:08] But the prophet says his little spirit
[1:41:10] knows.
[1:41:12] That settles it. Now he don't know his
[1:41:14] mother, but his little spirit knows
[1:41:16] there's something about that spirit
[1:41:18] there that nothing else can inject that
[1:41:21] mother love to him. No matter how much
[1:41:24] the other person's love, it ain't the
[1:41:26] mother's love. Is that right? And she
[1:41:28] lays her hand on him, he will dry up.
[1:41:30] See, he's ready because that mother,
[1:41:32] there's a love about her that goes to
[1:41:33] the baby and that the baby's little
[1:41:36] spirit recognize that. And that's the
[1:41:37] love that no other love is.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; That's a law. That is a law. So if you
[1:41:43] have a baby who was right away was taken
[1:41:44] off of his mother, sent somewhere of an
[1:41:46] orphan. I've just preached those things
[1:41:48] in India. I had I had a many orphans
[1:41:51] sitting in front of me and I talked
[1:41:54] about my testimony how the touch of a
[1:41:56] father and I I'll give you the example.
[1:41:59] But when he's talk about that when when
[1:42:00] the mother lays his hand on the baby,
[1:42:04] that connection and and then the love of
[1:42:06] the mother would would would remove all
[1:42:08] the anxiety of the baby. It brings such
[1:42:09] calmness. The father has the same touch.
[1:42:12] And later on, and because I was not
[1:42:16] raised without a father, I was clueless.
[1:42:19] I didn't know the power that I had as a
[1:42:22] father.
[1:42:23] I didn't know what fatherhood was
[1:42:26] outside of keep everything straight,
[1:42:28] make sure you're strict, don't lose
[1:42:30] control. So everything about my
[1:42:31] fatherhood when I started, I started
[1:42:33] bad. It was about discipline. So when
[1:42:35] you love your children in just one
[1:42:38] channel like okay just being strict
[1:42:39] discipline well all the love you have
[1:42:42] for them will be channeled at being
[1:42:44] strict guess what you'll be too strict
[1:42:47] because you need other channel caring
[1:42:49] giving attention spending time with them
[1:42:52] and so all that love can be channeled in
[1:42:54] so many different ways so then you're
[1:42:55] less strict not to lose control but I
[1:42:57] was over overbearing
[1:43:01] make a long story short I don't have
[1:43:03] time to give my testimony this morning.
[1:43:04] But at the age of 40, I said to myself,
[1:43:08] if if if there's a time where I need to
[1:43:10] meet my father, it's I need to try to
[1:43:12] find him. My I'm Greek, so my father
[1:43:14] lived in Greece. So I tried I pulled
[1:43:16] some strings and contact my mother, some
[1:43:18] restaurant owner, because Greek, they
[1:43:20] own restaurants. That's what they do.
[1:43:23] So guess what? I like restaurants.
[1:43:25] I was almost born in one. So I was
[1:43:28] raised in one for sure. And um
[1:43:33] so ended up being able to contact my
[1:43:35] father, do my first trip to Greece. I'm
[1:43:38] sitting in a restaurant because he
[1:43:40] doesn't welcome me in his house because
[1:43:42] his wife is there and she doesn't know
[1:43:43] that he has another son. Says it's
[1:43:45] complicated. So I'm not welcome in my
[1:43:47] father's house, which is a great pain.
[1:43:49] Let me give you that testimony first,
[1:43:52] then I'll give you this other one. So
[1:43:54] when we're trying to make arrangement to
[1:43:56] go to Greece to meet my father first of
[1:43:58] all he says Steve he says first at first
[1:44:00] he says I'm going to welcome you in my
[1:44:01] house and I'm going to introduce you I
[1:44:03] got two brothers that doesn't know me
[1:44:06] they don't even know I exist I know they
[1:44:08] exist I have their pictures
[1:44:10] and when I found my father the way I was
[1:44:13] able to find him is on through Facebook
[1:44:15] I was try to search his name and my
[1:44:18] brother's name and it's all Greek and
[1:44:20] all that I spent a whole evening digging
[1:44:22] on Facebook trying to find this this
[1:44:24] this and I couldn't find it until I saw
[1:44:26] a picture of my father doing barbecue
[1:44:28] with my brother. And when I saw that
[1:44:30] picture, my world just turned me turned
[1:44:34] upside down. It was such a painful p
[1:44:37] that picture was asking such a difficult
[1:44:39] question. Why is he allowed to do
[1:44:42] barbecue with his father? That's my
[1:44:44] father. He's my brother. He's I'm not.
[1:44:46] And then a whirlwind.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; So much pain. And that's where I realize
[1:44:52] it's the first time I touch at the
[1:44:56] because when a father leaves, it's
[1:44:58] called an invisible pain.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; If your father's beat you,
[1:45:03] you have scars. I had a bad father. I
[1:45:06] suffered. It was painful. You can you
[1:45:09] can heal more that easily and bring it
[1:45:11] to God because you can identify the
[1:45:14] pain. Fatherless when the parents
[1:45:16] abandon you, it's difficult because it's
[1:45:18] an invisible thing.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; I thought all my life that on the side
[1:45:22] of my father I was all good until I saw
[1:45:25] that picture. And when I saw that
[1:45:27] picture, it was all like a volcano
[1:45:29] inside of me that erupted.
[1:45:31] And people that want it easy said,
[1:45:33] "Well, Steve, it's easy. You should have
[1:45:34] never looked at the picture."
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; No, that picture was the beginning of
[1:45:39] the healing.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; A painful one because that volcano was
[1:45:44] inside of me,
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; but I didn't know it. It was totally
[1:45:47] disconnected. But what that picture did
[1:45:50] is that it brought that deep deep pain,
[1:45:54] that
[1:45:56] heaviness that I was carrying all my
[1:45:58] life, not knowing it was that. And when
[1:46:02] I that picture transferred that huge
[1:46:05] burden, heaviness, depression, spirit
[1:46:08] from within deep inside of me and
[1:46:10] brought it to the surface and so it
[1:46:14] exploded.
[1:46:16] So then I'm able to reach him. We have
[1:46:18] phone calls and then he says, "Steve,
[1:46:20] you know what? You're going to come in
[1:46:21] my house. I'm going to introduce you to
[1:46:23] your brothers." And I'm so just his
[1:46:25] words are so like, "I'm going to finally
[1:46:27] be welcome at my father's house."
[1:46:30] I'm so happy. I hang up the phone to go
[1:46:33] see my wife. We're going to Greece. I'm
[1:46:34] going to my father's house. I'm be
[1:46:36] welcome in his family. And it's such it
[1:46:38] is such a healing. It is such is so
[1:46:41] good. And I don't know maybe a week
[1:46:43] later or two weeks later we we call back
[1:46:45] and he says you know Steve he says I've
[1:46:46] changed my mind he says Greece not and
[1:46:49] then Greece was in like huge financial
[1:46:51] problem riots in the street depression
[1:46:53] my my brothers lost their business lost
[1:46:55] a lot of money so they were not doing
[1:46:57] good he says your brothers are not doing
[1:46:59] good I don't want to bring this things
[1:47:01] and on upon them so we going to meet in
[1:47:04] a restaurant
[1:47:06] and when he said I hung up the phone and
[1:47:08] I was crushed
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; because I was not welcome and then I
[1:47:11] opened my Bible. I sat on my in my
[1:47:14] office in my lazy boy and I opened the
[1:47:16] Bible. I don't know, it's a couple of
[1:47:18] years ago. I I don't remember if I cut
[1:47:20] through the Bible or I was there in my
[1:47:23] daily reading. I I forgot that detail.
[1:47:26] But that scripture, I'm going to read it
[1:47:28] to you just quickly here. But Jesus
[1:47:31] says,
[1:47:35] "Let your heart,
[1:47:37] let not your heart be troubled."
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ye believe in God, believe also in
[1:47:44] me.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; In my father's house,
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; are many mansions.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; If it were not, I would have told you,
[1:47:53] but I go to prepare a place for you.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; And if I go to prepare a place for you,
[1:47:59] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:48:01] myself, that where I am, they may be
[1:48:04] also. I I started crying. I went
[1:48:07] upstairs to see my wife. I said, "Wow,
[1:48:09] God, just step in." And it was the first
[1:48:11] time that God stepped in my life as a
[1:48:14] father. He had stepped in my life as a
[1:48:16] savior. He had stepped in my life as a
[1:48:18] lord. Uh and someone I want to serve.
[1:48:21] And I was a minister. I think I was
[1:48:23] already p yeah I was a pastor. I I knew
[1:48:25] him as lord. I knew him as a savior. I
[1:48:27] knew him at many things. But I didn't
[1:48:29] know him as a father.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; And that day was the first time that God
[1:48:33] stepped in and spoke to me as a father.
[1:48:38] And that was the beginning of the
[1:48:39] healing, not the total healing because
[1:48:41] there was a long journey for me. I had a
[1:48:43] I needed to learn a lot of things. But
[1:48:46] just to tell you that whatever void in
[1:48:48] your life you have, God wants to step
[1:48:50] in.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go across the world
[1:48:54] try to find your dad if if God allows
[1:48:57] it. Like in my story, it didn't work. It
[1:48:59] can work like we don't want to try to
[1:49:01] apply everything that every story is
[1:49:03] different. But in my story ended up that
[1:49:06] my dad never step in as a real dad and
[1:49:10] now he passed away right after COVID.
[1:49:13] But God did and it changed me and
[1:49:16] because I opened that kind of worm in my
[1:49:18] life. If first it was a was it was a
[1:49:20] volcano. If it if it was not for the
[1:49:23] grace of God that volcano would have
[1:49:25] lost me because it was beyond what I
[1:49:28] could bear. It brought a lot of
[1:49:29] confusion in my mind. It was really
[1:49:31] difficult. Well, the anchor of the Holy
[1:49:33] Ghost hold me and led me through the
[1:49:35] process of healing. And what is amazing
[1:49:37] is after that I lost this heaviness,
[1:49:42] this deep deep heaviness that every time
[1:49:45] every morning I would get up is gloomy.
[1:49:47] I love the Lord and it would confuse me
[1:49:49] like Lord why is it that I am so blessed
[1:49:52] in your presence? I'm so happy. I got
[1:49:54] full joy but then the next day I'm
[1:49:56] gloomy again. I've got I'm heavy again.
[1:49:58] And I was trying to find is it because
[1:50:00] of this? Is it because of that? Lord, I
[1:50:02] I want to be free from that until I
[1:50:04] opened that count of warm and I
[1:50:05] realized, okay, this is it. This is was
[1:50:08] so heavy that that that it was like
[1:50:11] exactly and he cares do you care. The
[1:50:13] prophet is talking about this young man.
[1:50:15] He says there's a there's he's talking
[1:50:17] about complexes and he says you all it's
[1:50:19] all wrapped around you. It's like when
[1:50:21] the prophet explained complexes, he has
[1:50:23] different way to explain it. It's a
[1:50:24] shadow dark cloud follow you. It's all
[1:50:27] wrapped. It's it's a darkness. It's
[1:50:28] something, but it's darkness. And that
[1:50:31] darkness is attached to a feeling. It's
[1:50:33] attached to a trauma. It's attached to
[1:50:35] something you believe. And God wants to
[1:50:36] deliver you from that.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; So, when I ended up going to Greece, I
[1:50:43] was sitting in a restaurant. I got over
[1:50:45] the fact that, okay, not quite over the
[1:50:47] fact, but I was in a restaurant. We're
[1:50:49] talking. And then, um, you order a
[1:50:52] coffee and my dad really liked those um,
[1:50:55] uh, what's it called?
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah, espresso. But espresso on
[1:50:59] steroids. I mean he he talked to the
[1:51:03] waiter like he said okay. And he talking
[1:51:04] he talking Greek like
[1:51:08] and I'm listening you know he's like and
[1:51:10] so I see what do you want and I'm like
[1:51:12] for the first time I can do like my
[1:51:13] father right I did as I see my father I
[1:51:16] was like same
[1:51:18] like brickly would say like double it
[1:51:24] and then um then uh they bring that
[1:51:29] goodness I was drinking coffee I thought
[1:51:33] that thing was so strong my head would
[1:51:35] turn and then I told look my dad I says
[1:51:37] daddy I I says I thought I told you I'm
[1:51:39] not drinking alcohol cuz I thought there
[1:51:41] was he says there's no alcohol in that
[1:51:43] it was just caffeine anyway it was so
[1:51:45] strong and then he started explaining me
[1:51:48] things and then he does something that I
[1:51:50] never happened to me probably at a young
[1:51:51] age but I forgot but as he explained
[1:51:53] we're sitting at a table and then he put
[1:51:55] his arms his hands on my arms like this
[1:51:58] and when he did that when he touched me
[1:52:01] I felt like you know when when the world
[1:52:02] when the room turns like this.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; I felt like something was turning. It's
[1:52:07] like, you know, I was like, oo. It's
[1:52:08] like I felt like, you know, a bit of
[1:52:10] nausea. It's like when it touched me,
[1:52:14] now he's not a Christian, unconverted
[1:52:17] Greek man, but he's my father.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Then when I real when he touched me, I
[1:52:23] was like,
[1:52:24] whoa.
[1:52:26] It something about my being.
[1:52:30] Science says that when a father touch
[1:52:32] his children, he's actually telling them
[1:52:35] you exist. You are material.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; I've experimented. I mean, it was so
[1:52:41] drastic because you usually we grow up
[1:52:43] and you know, we we don't know. There's
[1:52:45] not a before and after,
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; but I was 40ome years old. And when he
[1:52:49] did it, it was so big because it's like
[1:52:51] boom, you're you exist.
[1:52:54] The the touch of a father. So that's
[1:52:57] where I got the revelation. So guess
[1:52:59] what? When I came back home, I had five
[1:53:01] kids. I became so touchy in a in a
[1:53:06] proper way. Get me, you know, but I
[1:53:08] became so, you know,
[1:53:10] you I realized
[1:53:13] I had I had I had power that not just my
[1:53:16] words, you know, I did I didn't know
[1:53:18] that it it meant something until it was
[1:53:21] done to me.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Then I got the revelation.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; And to this day, you know, my girls are
[1:53:26] growing up, so there's a different way.
[1:53:28] But sometime also brothers, you're like,
[1:53:30] "Okay, now she's 16. She's in a puberty.
[1:53:32] So now I'm going to step off because
[1:53:34] it's all sacred and we make a big thing
[1:53:36] out of it." If you do that, you're going
[1:53:38] to confuse her. She's going to think
[1:53:40] there's something wrong about me. My
[1:53:42] father's not touching me anymore.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; There's a proper way to keep it.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; To keep it where I hug, I hug them. I
[1:53:50] hold them by the hands. I take their
[1:53:52] hands. doing it a proper way, but we
[1:53:55] still keep a connection.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't,
[1:54:01] then they're gonna pray for it. And then
[1:54:04] there's going to be another young boy's
[1:54:05] going to step in. And when he going to
[1:54:07] touch his her harm, she's going to feel
[1:54:10] the touch of a man's life. I've been
[1:54:12] craving for that. And you're going to
[1:54:14] set her up.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; You're going to set her up
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; for that.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the love we give our children
[1:54:22] is so is so protective.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; We protect them.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; I went ahead of myself again. Not a
[1:54:29] problem. Good.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; So
[1:54:35] the prophet says mother is first and she
[1:54:38] has a great responsibility
[1:54:40] of what that child will be
[1:54:43] will be based upon the way that mother
[1:54:46] starts that child on the path that he
[1:54:48] must travel.
[1:54:50] Mother has a responsibility from God to
[1:54:53] place that child on the right road. And
[1:54:54] I think that's why mother has a special
[1:54:57] touch.
[1:55:02] He's talking about a I know a boy in the
[1:55:03] city. I think his mother present now.
[1:55:05] He's almost my age. And I don't say this
[1:55:07] to hurt the mother because that she has
[1:55:08] enough hurts of all mothers. But the boy
[1:55:10] drinks and he drinks heavy. But when he
[1:55:12] gets real drunk, he will come home and
[1:55:14] jump into bed with his mother and put
[1:55:15] his arm around her. And he's got
[1:55:17] grandchildren.
[1:55:19] Why is he doing that? He's still looking
[1:55:20] for that connection. So he means he's
[1:55:22] stuck there but so he's so hurting he's
[1:55:25] he's drinking has a drinking problem
[1:55:27] because there's probably issues with his
[1:55:28] own father so he's stuck with needs his
[1:55:31] mother because something is lacking okay
[1:55:34] but just he's the prophet is using that
[1:55:36] example to show that the connection but
[1:55:39] there's something about just the pat of
[1:55:41] a mother that seems to take a different
[1:55:43] place than anything else can touch and
[1:55:46] that is in this life humanly speaking
[1:55:50] but sometime People are like, they want
[1:55:51] to be so spiritual. They don't look at
[1:55:53] those things because it's just, oh well,
[1:55:55] it's humanly speaking. This is not
[1:55:56] important. It's just psychology. It's a
[1:55:58] bunch of nonsense. We're the bride of
[1:55:59] Christ, brother. The rapture is
[1:56:01] tomorrow. Let's let's get over this
[1:56:04] and it's a big mistake. And with that
[1:56:06] approach, I grew up in a church that had
[1:56:08] that approach. You know, the rapture is
[1:56:10] tomorrow. Like we like
[1:56:13] what if we care? Like teaching kids to
[1:56:14] do a budget and having youth camp and
[1:56:16] build a next generation. We don't have
[1:56:18] to build the next generation. We're out
[1:56:20] of here.
[1:56:22] That's not what the prophet said to do.
[1:56:24] Prophet says, and it seems like the
[1:56:26] prophet did say, it's not like he didn't
[1:56:28] warn us. He warned us, plant your
[1:56:30] potatoes like you live a hundred years,
[1:56:32] but be ready as is it tomorrow.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; The prophet has asked us to chew gum and
[1:56:36] walk at the same time, but we choose to
[1:56:38] do one and not the other because it
[1:56:40] didn't look spiritual. But the prophet
[1:56:42] says, "Plant your potatoes mean plant
[1:56:44] for the next generation,
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; but be ready as if it's tomorrow. And
[1:56:50] this is the balance approach. So then
[1:56:52] he's talking about Moses and he says,
[1:56:54] "If I could credit anything to his
[1:56:56] character, it was because he had a God
[1:56:58] sent mother."
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; So it's not just election. It's not just
[1:57:04] reading the Bible, but there's he's
[1:57:06] talking about humanly spearing speaking
[1:57:09] the care,
[1:57:10] the touch,
[1:57:12] the connection. These are the recipes
[1:57:16] to to raise su a successful family.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; So what is it about? So it's the
[1:57:25] parenthood. So you're the one in the
[1:57:27] middle. Remember I'm talking to you this
[1:57:30] morning as if you were all you were when
[1:57:32] you were kids. This was God's will. a
[1:57:35] season of healthy parenthood where
[1:57:37] you're the kid in the middle and you got
[1:57:39] two parents and in that you're in kind
[1:57:42] of a you're you're in the presence of
[1:57:44] God.
[1:57:46] So your heart as you see I put a little
[1:57:49] heart there. Where is your heart? Your
[1:57:52] heart is inside the house.
[1:57:55] Your heart is in the home. Okay. So we
[1:57:57] are entering a something here.
[1:58:01] It's a season of innocence, spiritual
[1:58:03] headship by parents, strong emotional
[1:58:06] connection with no sexual thoughts or
[1:58:09] desire because it's a season of
[1:58:10] innocence. So when you have that
[1:58:13] connection and it's pure, that's why
[1:58:15] when you have one parents that try to
[1:58:18] use the connection to bring now there's
[1:58:22] kids here so we're going to be uh we're
[1:58:24] going to be uh parental guidance. Uh uh
[1:58:28] so when a father brings something else
[1:58:32] you know abuse and it it is such a
[1:58:36] confusion because it's not supposed to
[1:58:38] be like that. It's supposed to be a
[1:58:40] strong emotional connection with purity
[1:58:45] and then it creates something healthy in
[1:58:47] the child where he he grows up where
[1:58:50] he's safe and he knows what love is.
[1:58:53] So, it's a pure, innocent, and
[1:58:56] fulfilling relationship. So, that's a
[1:59:00] super important stage. If you didn't
[1:59:03] have that, as I'm telling my testimony,
[1:59:06] I've missed a lot of that. Later on,
[1:59:10] there's holes in your life that God
[1:59:12] wants to heal because it's going to be
[1:59:15] difficult to be a balanced father or to
[1:59:17] be a balanced mother if you're missing
[1:59:20] huge parts. But God, it's not like,
[1:59:23] well, sorry you're curse or sorry you
[1:59:26] didn't have it. I got good news for you.
[1:59:29] God is in tr God cares.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Do you care?
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; God cared for me.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; He sent me and it's later on in life.
[1:59:40] I'm 40 years old and
[1:59:43] it was part of my middleage crisis at
[1:59:46] 40. You know, sometime they're like,
[1:59:48] "Oh, you know, 40 years old men quit
[1:59:50] their wife, marry a young one, buy a
[1:59:52] bicycle, and do everything they dream
[1:59:54] about." And we think that's only the
[1:59:56] people in the world to experience that.
[1:59:58] No, every man, it's a it's a something
[2:00:00] it's something physical. It's
[2:00:02] physiology. And it's also a a a So some
[2:00:06] men here maybe you pass that, you've
[2:00:07] experienced, you didn't know it was
[2:00:09] that, but let let me explain to you
[2:00:12] quickly what it is for for men because
[2:00:14] men goes through it. We know women
[2:00:15] menopause it's it's it's a huge
[2:00:17] challenge but men around 40
[2:00:20] we realize when we reach that fatal four
[2:00:25] you know 29 30 is like it's rough but
[2:00:27] it's still a three it's not that bad you
[2:00:29] know I'm I'm still young but that four
[2:00:33] that four kills you because you know the
[2:00:36] next one is five and five is like you're
[2:00:39] you're an old man
[2:00:41] and and there's something subconscious
[2:00:43] inside of you and you feel like it's
[2:00:47] like watching a train all your life. All
[2:00:49] your life you say, "One day I'm going to
[2:00:50] do this. One day I'm going to do this.
[2:00:51] One day I'm going to do this." And when
[2:00:52] you reach the age 40, it's like you
[2:00:54] watch a train and this is the last wagon
[2:00:57] and if I don't jump in, I'll never do
[2:00:59] it.
[2:01:01] And so if if if if your marriage was was
[2:01:04] difficult for all those years and you're
[2:01:07] like, "Well, I need I want" and then at
[2:01:09] 40 you're like, "It's my last chance to
[2:01:11] start over again." or I wanted to ride a
[2:01:13] bike. I wanted to I don't know climb the
[2:01:16] Everest. Whatever you thought in your
[2:01:17] life you wanted to do. Sometimes these
[2:01:20] are crazy things but for me was like I
[2:01:22] need I want to meet my father and at 40
[2:01:25] I was like I'm 40. He's probably around
[2:01:27] 70 up there. It's my last chance. And it
[2:01:29] was my last chance.
[2:01:31] And so I went for that. So we need we
[2:01:35] need to bring that
[2:01:38] season that middle age where we we have
[2:01:41] a craving for something we always wanted
[2:01:43] to do that seems to contradicts
[2:01:46] the commitment we have towards our kids
[2:01:49] and family. We need to bring this in
[2:01:51] front of God to overcome and to kind of
[2:01:54] see through that. not totally squash it,
[2:01:57] but to bring it in front of God and say,
[2:01:59] "Lord, help me to navigate through that
[2:02:01] deep feeling that I must do this or I
[2:02:04] must do that and bring it to God."
[2:02:08] Amen. So, we're touching many many
[2:02:10] things this morning.
[2:02:13] So we have such juvenile uh crime wave
[2:02:16] across the nation but I think it really
[2:02:18] started at home and I think the parents
[2:02:20] began to let go and if the child had
[2:02:22] been raised up in a good oldfashioned
[2:02:24] godly home I don't say it would be all
[2:02:26] over certainly not but it would
[2:02:27] certainly give that child that child the
[2:02:30] right kind of influence and I think many
[2:02:32] times at homes that children has been
[2:02:34] brought up wrong turn loose on the
[2:02:36] street and just live for themsel while
[2:02:38] the mother stays on Facebook uh barroom
[2:02:41] and the mother and so forth. And
[2:02:43] sometime we think the problem is the
[2:02:45] barroom. No, it's not the problem. What?
[2:02:46] Barroom is a problem. But the first
[2:02:49] problem is that mommy is some something
[2:02:51] else.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; So we see barroom is like, well, praise
[2:02:56] God. And like I'm a mother. I'm not in a
[2:02:57] barroom. Yeah, but you are so your mind
[2:03:00] is so about something else.
[2:03:03] Try to be noticed on social media. try
[2:03:06] to be noticed somewhere else instead of
[2:03:07] being noticed
[2:03:10] in your spiritual position.
[2:03:14] Well, I don't get this. I don't get
[2:03:15] fulfilled by raising those children. If
[2:03:17] you don't get fulfilled, you don't get
[2:03:20] this satisfaction, it's because you've
[2:03:22] been contaminated
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; by this modern age
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; that sends you the message that if
[2:03:28] you're a mother and motherhood has no
[2:03:30] value
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; and you're nothing unless you have a
[2:03:33] degree. You're nothing unless you're on
[2:03:34] the workforce. You're nothing unless and
[2:03:37] and and and we don't realize how much
[2:03:39] the society brainwash us
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; just every advertisement about any
[2:03:45] product
[2:03:47] man is washing dishes and the woman is
[2:03:49] in the workforce. They sell you a
[2:03:51] computer, it's a woman working on it.
[2:03:54] Even Microsoft, they advertise a
[2:03:57] computer. Okay, I show the examples of
[2:03:59] the church, but Microsoft want to sell
[2:04:01] you a computer. And so the they want to
[2:04:03] sell computer to men. So men is have the
[2:04:06] he has the computer on the counter while
[2:04:08] he's washing dishes. Advertisement,
[2:04:09] Microsoft advertisement. But then the
[2:04:11] woman, they want to sell computer to
[2:04:12] woman. She's sitting in the office while
[2:04:15] the man is at home. And so they put
[2:04:17] everything just to confuse everything.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; So it has an impact where humanly even
[2:04:25] though spiritually we know it's our
[2:04:27] position humanly we we don't feel value
[2:04:32] and we don't feel fulfillment in
[2:04:34] transferring that love and raising the
[2:04:36] next generation because the society says
[2:04:39] it's stupid. You're wasting your time.
[2:04:42] Send your kids to the government. I'll
[2:04:43] take care of it.
[2:04:45] Yeah,
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; they don't take care of this. So mom
[2:04:49] stays in the barroom, the father's on a
[2:04:51] golf course or whatever. He's somewhere
[2:04:53] else. He's he's busy. He has project. He
[2:04:55] wants to build five businesses. He wants
[2:04:57] to have his life that he always dreamed
[2:04:59] of. He has so many plans, but there
[2:05:02] nothing's related to his children.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; What do you think we reap then? Yeah.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; If we don't invest,
[2:05:15] our our kids heart
[2:05:18] will drift away.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; And we're going to we're going to enter
[2:05:22] into this right now. They don't love it
[2:05:25] and give it the affections
[2:05:29] to take it up. It's young. You've got to
[2:05:32] teach it to love and respect and to read
[2:05:36] the Bible. So there's a spiritual
[2:05:38] element to it because as you can see
[2:05:41] it's deeper than that
[2:05:44] care, love, affections,
[2:05:48] connection. Why? Because it's not good
[2:05:50] for men to human being to be alone. If
[2:05:53] there's not that connection, they will
[2:05:55] seek that connection somewhere else.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; And that's where we lose them on the c
[2:06:00] on the curve. We lose our wife on the
[2:06:03] curve. We lose our husband on the curve
[2:06:05] because we are so busy. We have so many
[2:06:07] other project.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Marriage is the project.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Raising the family is the project.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; But but but we lose track of that
[2:06:17] because it's not valued.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; We we get married, we we have kids so we
[2:06:22] can go along with whatever we wanted to
[2:06:24] do. But then later on we realize what
[2:06:26] what's wrong with my family. We're so
[2:06:28] disconnected. They they want to be gone.
[2:06:29] They're like, "Oh, if I can get 18, get
[2:06:31] my apartment, if I can be out of here."
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they are they are dying
[2:06:38] inside. They're looking for fellowship
[2:06:41] and they don't get it in the house.
[2:06:47] And it's not like because I don't know
[2:06:48] one thing or two about it. I got five
[2:06:50] children that four of them are now
[2:06:53] adults. So we've we've crossed on the
[2:06:56] other side of maintain and cultivate
[2:07:02] fellowship
[2:07:04] for me to go down to their level. What
[2:07:06] do they like to talk about? What what do
[2:07:08] they want to do? Go play volleyball with
[2:07:11] them, play music with them,
[2:07:14] being part of their life. Not always
[2:07:17] that if I they want to do something,
[2:07:19] they come they have to come on my
[2:07:20] ground. But what if I go on their
[2:07:23] ground?
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; That's fellowship. Fellowship is not
[2:07:28] come on my side. It's let's join,
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; let's meet.
[2:07:38] Most quote where the prophet talks about
[2:07:40] that prostitute woman in in in the time
[2:07:42] of Jesus.
[2:07:45] You will always relate. We when we think
[2:07:47] about prostitute and hill fame woman
[2:07:49] right away we're like yeah this is such
[2:07:51] vile it is it's so horrible
[2:07:54] even last night I said something wrong
[2:07:56] when I talk about this man who is
[2:07:58] abusing children in the church I call
[2:08:00] him a monster I want to pull that back
[2:08:03] even himself he if he ended up this way
[2:08:07] like a prostitute or a man does have bad
[2:08:10] behavior
[2:08:11] it's linked to something
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; and not to justify it I mean We we we
[2:08:16] not we explaining and justify it's two
[2:08:20] things differently.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Those spirits enter their life in a
[2:08:24] certain way.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; You know that the Holy Spirit is a
[2:08:28] comforter.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; For many years before I realized I was
[2:08:33] broken, I was always wondering why is
[2:08:34] the Bible says the Holy Spirit is a
[2:08:36] comforter. Like what's the need of
[2:08:37] comfort? Like what's until the Lord Lord
[2:08:40] showed me Steve you're broken. You need
[2:08:43] a comforter. Then then I realized, oh my
[2:08:45] goodness,
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; he didn't use the word comforter, which
[2:08:49] is is comforting and healing and there's
[2:08:52] there's a lot with that word.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; But do you know that the evil spirits
[2:08:57] also are comforters?
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; They're fake one.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; But spirits want to enter your life to
[2:09:05] comfort you.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Go read the message. He cares. Do you
[2:09:08] care? The prophet says, "Women dress
[2:09:10] this way because they try to draw
[2:09:12] comfort out because they're well put,
[2:09:14] they're well done, they're they're nice,
[2:09:15] they're beautiful, and they're such in
[2:09:17] the distress." And so that's what evil
[2:09:19] spirit does.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; What is a drinking problem if you're not
[2:09:22] seeking for comfort?
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; You're seeking to be comforted.
[2:09:26] Drinking, gambling. Look at every sin.
[2:09:29] It's related to an evil spirit. But that
[2:09:32] evil spirit is using what ground inside
[2:09:34] of you? He's using your distress. He's
[2:09:37] using the hole inside of you. He's using
[2:09:39] a trauma to say, "I know you can't bear
[2:09:41] it. You cannot make it. You're so
[2:09:43] anxious. So invite me in your life. It's
[2:09:45] your drinking. Feel better."
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; If you show your body, you're going to
[2:09:48] feel better. If you if a man's look at
[2:09:50] you, you're going to feel better.
[2:09:53] So all the the spirit world enters into
[2:09:56] human life selling themsel as a
[2:09:58] comforter. But the Jesus says, "I will
[2:10:00] sell you thee." There's only one
[2:10:02] comforter that when he comes in your
[2:10:04] life, he's not just a patch or a
[2:10:06] band-aid. He's a healer. He wants to go
[2:10:08] deep in your life and not just cover the
[2:10:10] hole, fill the hole.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; So, he's talking about the prostitute
[2:10:17] woman. The prophet says, "The lady was
[2:10:19] born in that nervous condition. Her
[2:10:20] father and mother died and she was a
[2:10:22] child baby raised up and tossed her
[2:10:24] everywhere and never had a proper love
[2:10:26] care that a baby has." You know, mother,
[2:10:28] I want to tell you something. I know got
[2:10:30] a little boy back there and he's really
[2:10:32] rankly spoiled, but I would rather have
[2:10:34] him that way. I believe it'll make him a
[2:10:36] better man out of him. If God lets him
[2:10:37] live, let him
[2:10:40] than to let him scream and cry and upset
[2:10:42] his little self. Listen, a few years
[2:10:44] ago, some normal witch doctor said, "Let
[2:10:47] that baby cry. Don't pick it up. Don't
[2:10:50] let grandma touch it." And you know
[2:10:51] what? They hatched out.
[2:10:54] You see what it is? A juvenile
[2:10:55] delinquency. A bunch of neurotic. God
[2:10:57] made a baby to be loved. So he's linking
[2:10:59] anxiety and neurotism and all that to
[2:11:02] the fact that they had at one point, you
[2:11:05] know, it was all bad, you know, don't
[2:11:06] don't breastfeed. We got we got the
[2:11:08] perfect formula. Don't take don't let
[2:11:10] med at one point medicine in the 70s and
[2:11:13] prophet links it back to the 50s was
[2:11:16] really bad. They they went against
[2:11:17] nature almost in everything.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Now there's a return to nature.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Breastfeeding and many things. They
[2:11:24] return, they realize that
[2:11:27] God's first idea is always the best one.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; God made a baby to be loved. Well,
[2:11:34] that's deep, deep theology. This a deep
[2:11:37] mystery. It's amazing because we got so
[2:11:40] caught up in the deep mysteries that the
[2:11:42] simple principle of life has become to
[2:11:44] us deep mysteries.
[2:11:47] We got to return. That's why you made a
[2:11:50] baby, a mother to love a baby. Uh
[2:11:54] That's why we're supposed to be this
[2:11:55] way. God made it that way. And anytime
[2:11:58] that you upset God's program, you must
[2:12:01] remember you're wrong.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; And you will be wrong as long as you're
[2:12:05] upsetting God's program. Follow God's
[2:12:09] program. Do it the way God said
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; do it.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; I'm sure some of you are amazed this
[2:12:18] morning saying, "I didn't know there was
[2:12:19] so much quotes about those things.
[2:12:22] It's been overlooked.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; It's been overlooked.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; There's much. I'm just giving you a
[2:12:28] sample.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Just a little sampling.
[2:12:32] What brought juvenile delinquency was
[2:12:33] parent delinquency. Parents failing to
[2:12:35] take care of the children. Remember a
[2:12:36] few years ago when my boy was born that
[2:12:39] been about I think he's about 19 now. I
[2:12:42] remember the doctor told my wife just
[2:12:43] let that kid squall. Let him cry. Ain't
[2:12:46] going to hurt him. And grandma comes
[2:12:47] along to pick him up. Take her keep her
[2:12:50] keep her hands off of him. Wow. It's
[2:12:53] great wisdom. We ought to be quibb broke
[2:12:55] at six months old. You know better than
[2:12:58] that. Sounds like talking to a witch
[2:13:00] doctor instead of a real doctor. And
[2:13:02] then you know what it hatch out? It
[2:13:03] hatch out a bunch of neurotic and bunch
[2:13:04] of gangster.
[2:13:06] God gave you that labor baby to love. I
[2:13:08] don't care how you spoil it. How about
[2:13:10] you spoil it? Love it anyhow. That's why
[2:13:12] I love it. If you don't love it now,
[2:13:14] it'll grow up in a cold home and
[2:13:18] indifferent.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Now, we're reaching a key point here.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Cold home and indifferent. Indifference
[2:13:27] is nobody cares.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; They seem to care, but they don't care.
[2:13:33] And when that happened, when if our
[2:13:35] homes were cold or or are cold and
[2:13:37] indifferent, then it'll seek love
[2:13:41] somewhere. That's right.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Or something and it'll make out light
[2:13:46] for somewhere. Mother, take that baby
[2:13:48] and give it fellowship and love. Now,
[2:13:50] make it part of you, which it is
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; and not like it and hugg it and kiss it
[2:13:55] and love it. Don't be too cold with the
[2:13:57] things of the world. God gave you that
[2:13:58] as a treasure. Raise it right. Amen.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; There's a key. There's a lot of keys in
[2:14:06] that quote, but one one is make it part
[2:14:09] of you.
[2:14:11] Make it part of you as at at a young age
[2:14:14] your children is are looking for
[2:14:16] fellowship. They they crave for
[2:14:18] fellowship and fellowship for them is is
[2:14:21] they want to do what you're doing.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; But how many time you know your little
[2:14:27] girls show up in the kitchen and like
[2:14:28] mommy I want to help you cook. Like okay
[2:14:31] go play with your doll. Mommy's busy.
[2:14:33] Daddy's coming and mommy's busy buzzy
[2:14:36] and it's boiling and oh I know you want
[2:14:37] to cook honey. But when she comes and
[2:14:39] she says, "Mommy, I want to help you."
[2:14:42] She's saying, "I'm looking for
[2:14:43] fellowship."
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; Why don't you pull a chair, give him a
[2:14:47] plastic knife, and whatever in
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; she's going to cook with you.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "Make it part of you.
[2:14:57] Make it part of your life."
[2:15:00] And we don't realize that. I've done
[2:15:02] that when they were young. Later on, I
[2:15:04] realized, but it took me took me a
[2:15:05] while.
[2:15:06] What we don't realize is every time we
[2:15:08] tell them go away, go play, we reject
[2:15:10] them,
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; We're breaking the fellowship. We send
[2:15:14] them back to the room and obviously
[2:15:16] they're going to make a a mind on
[2:15:17] themselves and they're going to play.
[2:15:18] They're going to seem to enjoy it.
[2:15:19] They're going to be quiet because they
[2:15:21] don't realize they've just been
[2:15:22] rejected.
[2:15:25] It's like a father is just building a
[2:15:26] shed and you got, you know, Tommy boy
[2:15:28] comes with his his plastic hammer and
[2:15:30] his his plastic saw, all his tool belt
[2:15:33] that you you gave him last Christmas was
[2:15:36] last birthday gift and he comes, "Daddy,
[2:15:37] I want to build a shed with you." Yeah.
[2:15:38] Yeah, it's good, Sunny Boy. Daddy's
[2:15:40] busy. He's got just Saturday to build
[2:15:42] it. Daddy's working, so go play with
[2:15:43] your friends.
[2:15:45] He's five.
[2:15:47] And the problem when we do that is that
[2:15:50] we have no vision.
[2:15:53] We have no vision because what we see is
[2:15:55] a 5-year-old boy. Period.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; And Samuel got caught in the same thing
[2:16:00] when it was time to anoint a king.
[2:16:03] Even David's father got caught up
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; because he didn't invite David to the
[2:16:09] ceremony.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Saul's Samuel's coming to anoint a new
[2:16:13] king and and they don't they don't even
[2:16:15] even bother to to ask David to come.
[2:16:17] What an insult. Imagine David's
[2:16:19] testimony is like, "Yeah, one day it was
[2:16:21] time to anoint a king. My dad didn't
[2:16:22] even invite me.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; I felt great that day."
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; But then he expect all the sons, none of
[2:16:30] them. And then they say like, "Don't you
[2:16:31] have another son?" And then then uh
[2:16:34] what's his name? Jesse. Because in
[2:16:36] French it's another name. So Jesse's
[2:16:40] like, "Yeah, I got another one." But
[2:16:41] it's just a kids with, you know, with
[2:16:42] sheep like like don't bother. Samuel's
[2:16:46] like, "We're not going anywhere until
[2:16:47] you ask him to come."
[2:16:50] So they invite this young boy in. He's
[2:16:53] so young. Even Saul thought he's young.
[2:16:55] Even Goliath's laughing like everybody
[2:16:57] laughs like, "God,
[2:17:00] [Laughter]
[2:17:02] everybody laughed at David's age."
[2:17:07] But God, when man sees a boy,
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; God saw a king.
[2:17:15] And that's why we need vision for our
[2:17:17] children.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; You we need to invest in them at an age
[2:17:22] you know in you know what the basic of
[2:17:24] investment is
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; today.
[2:17:29] I'll take one company that's really
[2:17:30] high. Okay. Today well you can say well
[2:17:33] today tomorrow I'm going to buy I'm
[2:17:35] going to invest in Google stock. Yeah
[2:17:37] you can invest in Google stock but it's
[2:17:39] not huge of investment. It probably
[2:17:41] already reaches climax. investment is to
[2:17:44] find a treasure that's not up there yet,
[2:17:48] but you know the potential and you
[2:17:50] invest in the future
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; and and and and maybe we have good
[2:17:55] brothers here that you're good in
[2:17:57] investment,
[2:18:00] but we are poor in HR, human resources.
[2:18:04] We are poor in in our own family where
[2:18:07] we don't invest. Well, they're just
[2:18:08] kids. They're just kids. They're just
[2:18:10] kids. And overnight realized like you
[2:18:12] turn around and now he's taller than you
[2:18:14] and you're like, "Oh, where you've been
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; and men and men fathers were like that.
[2:18:19] We don't see the man until he becomes a
[2:18:21] man."
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; But then when he becomes a man, he's 16
[2:18:27] years old. Then we realize, oh well, we
[2:18:29] have got a man. We have a man here.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; But then we're frustrated because now
[2:18:35] that man, all he thinks about is to
[2:18:38] play. Right?
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; You want to play with his friend. He
[2:18:41] wants to play with his video games. But
[2:18:42] what you don't remember is that when he
[2:18:44] was five, you told him to go play.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Go play. Go play. Go with your friends.
[2:18:50] Go away. Go away. Go away. Go away. At
[2:18:53] one point, he resolved in his heart,
[2:18:54] okay, I'm not wanted here, so I'll go
[2:18:56] play and I'll go have fun. And it
[2:18:58] becomes his life. But who set him up on
[2:19:00] that journey?
[2:19:03] when he had the desire, when there was a
[2:19:05] like a when there was a seed of manhood
[2:19:08] springing in his in his 5-year-old
[2:19:10] heart, you could have invest in that and
[2:19:12] make him part of your life. That's what
[2:19:14] the that's why, you know, so there's
[2:19:16] such a treasury when the prophet says
[2:19:18] make it part of you. That's what it
[2:19:19] means.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; Make it part of your life. Invest.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; That's a huge key. Yeah.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; So many frustrated parents with their
[2:19:33] teenagers don't realize that they've
[2:19:36] missed the season. They've missed the
[2:19:38] curve. They missed the investment time.
[2:19:42] Well, brother, what do we do? Is it too
[2:19:44] late? No, it's not too late. It's never
[2:19:47] too late. But it comes first to own it,
[2:19:49] to say, "Okay, I missed this
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; and I need to return and have a true
[2:19:54] meaningful conversation." I had those
[2:19:57] conversation with my my children almost
[2:20:00] all of them sitting in their bedroom
[2:20:03] just me and them to say daddy needs to
[2:20:05] talk to you. I fail.
[2:20:09] No daddy you're great. You're such a
[2:20:11] great father. You know that there's
[2:20:13] something wonderful with children. They
[2:20:16] are so forgiven. Hey, they're not
[2:20:18] programmed unless unless they get really
[2:20:21] bitter and really really hurt. But even
[2:20:23] a rebellious spirit, do you know that a
[2:20:25] rebellious spirit comes on a grieving
[2:20:29] teenager,
[2:20:30] a brokenhearted one and say,
[2:20:34] you know, sometime I don't know if you
[2:20:35] call it this in English, but in French
[2:20:37] they all we always talk teenagers year
[2:20:40] as a crisis.
[2:20:43] Oh yeah, it's I don't know how you say
[2:20:45] it in English, but in French we we call
[2:20:47] it the teenage cre crisis. Well, yeah,
[2:20:49] they're a teenager. It's a crisis. It's
[2:20:51] a crisis. A crisis is a volcano. But how
[2:20:54] do we build a volcano?
[2:20:56] We build volcano over years with
[2:20:58] pressure, pressure, pressure on resolve,
[2:21:00] unresolved, unresolved, unresolved,
[2:21:02] unresolved. Confusion, unresolved,
[2:21:04] rejection, blah blah. Boom. And then a
[2:21:06] spirits come and says, "I think you need
[2:21:08] your my help here. Your parents are
[2:21:10] clueless. They don't get it. You need to
[2:21:13] kind you need to punch holes in the
[2:21:14] walls a little bit. You need to you need
[2:21:16] to slap some doors here. You need to
[2:21:17] wake them up. You need to shake this.
[2:21:21] Everybody's sleeping and then start
[2:21:22] throwing and so that rebellious spirit
[2:21:24] will step in their life cuz he was able
[2:21:26] to sold something to them as a solution.
[2:21:30] Obviously a rebellious spirit is not the
[2:21:32] solution.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; But it looks like one when you're stuck.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; That's why we can avoid those things
[2:21:46] by having meaningful conversation. And
[2:21:48] so I had those conversation with my own
[2:21:51] children sometime in a group sometimes
[2:21:53] separately when I realized and my wife
[2:21:55] did the same when we realized okay oh my
[2:21:58] goodness we've missed it we've missed it
[2:21:59] how how we were so blind we went back
[2:22:02] and sat and have come no daddy you're so
[2:22:04] good you're such a great father I said
[2:22:06] thank you being nice it's okay I know
[2:22:09] you love me but in reality you have
[2:22:12] suffered you've suffered because it's a
[2:22:15] principle and me as a father was not
[2:22:17] allowed
[2:22:18] to let that go, whatever it was. And it
[2:22:21] says, I want to pray, first of all, I
[2:22:22] want to ask you forgiveness. And then I
[2:22:24] want to pray together that God would
[2:22:26] with would by his blood. You know the
[2:22:28] power of the blood, the Clorox, it
[2:22:30] dissolves sins. It dissolves,
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; sorry, it dissolves parents' mistakes.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; We applied the token apply the blood.
[2:22:39] It's also that it's not just a throwing
[2:22:42] the TV out and like we we we we read
[2:22:44] quotes sometime and they are truth but
[2:22:47] but but they are deeper than
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; than that
[2:22:53] and when we don't do that
[2:22:57] the prophet says
[2:22:59] notice that's what the matter we got
[2:23:01] away from the things of God you get away
[2:23:03] from nature
[2:23:06] then you're out of the will of God. So
[2:23:10] it's not just the great spiritual things
[2:23:12] that God is asking of us. It's also the
[2:23:14] little natural thing that some people
[2:23:17] call psychology wise bunch of family
[2:23:19] counseling stuff. Oh yeah, they invited
[2:23:21] that minister. He's talking about family
[2:23:23] you know like it was stupid and we get
[2:23:26] those reaction in our ranks.
[2:23:29] No wonder sometime what we reap and I
[2:23:33] don't know what kind of spirit got in
[2:23:35] our churches and maybe it's not here.
[2:23:37] Praise the Lord. But where I come from
[2:23:39] and I've I've I've I've many places I've
[2:23:42] I've encountered that attitude
[2:23:45] like it was something you know that's
[2:23:48] denomination are doing that
[2:23:51] like everything denomination do is
[2:23:53] trash.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:23:56] Where's that attitude come from? What
[2:23:57] did did the prophet had that attitude?
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; He didn't have that.
[2:24:02] Well, we're the bride. We're above that.
[2:24:04] Said who?
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; That's not the quotes. I'm reading this
[2:24:07] morning.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah, but most of the quotes you read
[2:24:12] are before before 63. So, it doesn't
[2:24:15] really apply. Well, he cares. Do you
[2:24:17] cares is after
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; I know all the mind games going on. I've
[2:24:22] been raised in the message.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; I know where people goes and mind. Yeah.
[2:24:27] Well, this this opening la.
[2:24:31] And that's why sometime we're stuck.
[2:24:35] You want to claim great spiritual things
[2:24:37] but marriage are crumb crumbling and
[2:24:39] families are crumbling.
[2:24:42] You get away from nature and then you're
[2:24:44] out of the will of God. You opening the
[2:24:46] seals doesn't cancel that.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice Job think Job
[2:24:53] thinking of his children. He said pure
[2:24:55] adventure they got out and so he's he's
[2:24:56] telling just to save some time but he's
[2:24:58] telling about how he made sacrifice for
[2:25:00] children. He he didn't forget. He says,
[2:25:02] "Mother and father, if you quit spending
[2:25:04] money on children, learning tap dancing
[2:25:06] and things like that and some kind of
[2:25:07] how to be an actor and put more time
[2:25:09] pleading the blood of Jesus over them
[2:25:10] and showing them love and fellowship."
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Not just the blood, love and fellowship,
[2:25:17] we'd get along better. The child would
[2:25:19] too teach your child. So as you see
[2:25:22] every time you talk about children he's
[2:25:24] talking about care affections Bible
[2:25:26] applying the blood fellowship part of
[2:25:29] your life a warm home not a cold one a
[2:25:32] caring home not an indifferent one you
[2:25:35] see it
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; it's clear as it can be
[2:25:38] but what happened when it's not there
[2:25:42] well when it's not there something
[2:25:44] progressively happened and it's because
[2:25:49] and I'm almost done but for those who
[2:25:50] are worried
[2:25:52] I was giving extra time this this
[2:25:54] morning because yesterday I was short.
[2:25:57] So um when it's not there when
[2:26:01] fellowship and connect strong connection
[2:26:03] is not in the home something happened
[2:26:06] and that happened on the subconscious
[2:26:08] level but the heart because it's not
[2:26:11] good for men to be alone.
[2:26:14] You seek fellowship and you don't have
[2:26:16] it. You seek fellowship you're rejected.
[2:26:19] Mommy's busy, father's busy, my sibling,
[2:26:21] whatever. Whatever happen, whatever is
[2:26:23] the recipe. If you're lonely,
[2:26:25] something's going to progressively
[2:26:27] happen without you noticing. But your
[2:26:29] heart is going to drift away from the
[2:26:32] house
[2:26:34] and you're going to still live in the
[2:26:37] house.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; And that can happen to a spouse, too. If
[2:26:41] the marriage is not really well
[2:26:42] connected, the spouse, the husband or
[2:26:45] the wife, the heart's going to drift
[2:26:46] away. And they're because you seek
[2:26:49] fellowship at all costs. Listen to me.
[2:26:52] You're seeking love, care, fellowship at
[2:26:55] all costs. If you don't have food,
[2:26:58] you're going to eat in a trash can. You
[2:27:01] don't have fellowship, if you don't have
[2:27:03] good, nourishing, spiritually wise, and
[2:27:06] good fellowship, you're going to seek it
[2:27:09] somewhere else, and you might end up in
[2:27:11] a spiritual trash can, too.
[2:27:15] And so when your heart leaves the home,
[2:27:19] you're not protected under parenthood
[2:27:21] anymore because that's God's protection.
[2:27:24] Parenthood, God, parents.
[2:27:29] And so that's a trap.
[2:27:32] And today with a modern age, you don't
[2:27:34] have to leave the house for your heart
[2:27:36] to be out there. You lock yourself in
[2:27:38] the room with the Wi-Fi,
[2:27:41] which is another problem.
[2:27:43] You give unlimited access
[2:27:47] to your children
[2:27:49] and you give them a device for them to
[2:27:52] to to commit spiritual suicide
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; with a device connected where they
[2:27:59] everywhere doing all kind of things and
[2:28:01] you thought you gave them a gift at
[2:28:03] Christmas.
[2:28:06] you give them a loaded gun.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; And if you have a house where you're not
[2:28:11] connected, and that's also a problem.
[2:28:13] When a father feels guilty that he's not
[2:28:17] connected with family. And if a mother
[2:28:18] feels guilty, guess what we do? We
[2:28:21] overwhelm them sometime with gifts
[2:28:23] because we try to compensate. So we give
[2:28:25] them all kinds of stuff. All they ask,
[2:28:27] "Are you want the iPad I'm going to give
[2:28:28] you?" Or, "You want a computer?" And
[2:28:30] then we we give them all kinds of
[2:28:32] devices with the Wi-Fi on. And guess
[2:28:34] what happened? Their heart drifts even
[2:28:37] further away while they're s while
[2:28:39] they're in the room. You think they're
[2:28:41] in the house. They are everywhere
[2:28:44] getting all sort of connection
[2:28:46] everywhere. And that is where you get so
[2:28:50] much problem
[2:28:51] because they're seeking an emotional
[2:28:53] connection through so many we got a
[2:28:57] little font problem here but uh so
[2:29:00] texting chat social media Romans bad
[2:29:02] friends influence they're seeking
[2:29:04] remember the quote the prophet says if
[2:29:08] they're if you are raised in a cold home
[2:29:10] and indifferent then they'll seek love
[2:29:12] somewhere or something
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; and they're going to fed they're going
[2:29:16] to feel emotionally ly fed by the wrong
[2:29:19] thing. But it's a law. It is not good
[2:29:21] for men to be a human being to be alone.
[2:29:24] So they're going to fill that void at
[2:29:26] all cost. Well, the problem at that
[2:29:27] point is they're not under godly
[2:29:29] influence anymore. They under even
[2:29:32] though they still in your house, they
[2:29:33] are and they're slowly going to start
[2:29:36] hearing from your children, "Oh, I can't
[2:29:38] wait to be out of here." Yeah.
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; And when they start saying that, it's
[2:29:42] it's a huge red alert because their
[2:29:46] their body is still in the house, but
[2:29:47] they have no interest, no desire. They
[2:29:51] want to be out because they're looking
[2:29:54] to be loved and they found it somewhere
[2:29:57] else. And that's exactly what the
[2:29:59] prophet warned us. And he says, "Be
[2:30:01] careful because they'll seek love
[2:30:03] somewhere else."
[2:30:05] And that's where you get in trouble
[2:30:07] because then you get all kinds of
[2:30:09] problem. The lust, the flirt, the
[2:30:11] fantasy, girlfriend, boyfriend,
[2:30:12] pornography, fantasy, all that. It's all
[2:30:16] comforting spirits.
[2:30:21] Not that texting is bad, but if you use
[2:30:23] it to replace the genuine love,
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; texting is not a connection.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; It's amazing when I see young people,
[2:30:31] they courtship through text. They fall
[2:30:33] in love with a green or blue bubble.
[2:30:37] They have no clue or they try to resolve
[2:30:39] their courtship and they break up. They
[2:30:41] break up by texting.
[2:30:43] They are so
[2:30:46] crippled.
[2:30:47] They're so emotionally crippled that
[2:30:50] they cannot even talk to someone
[2:30:56] because they've not been trained. And we
[2:30:58] can laugh at the other generation
[2:31:00] because they are emotionally socially
[2:31:03] crippled. But who should have teach
[2:31:07] fellowship in the house?
[2:31:09] Who should have done outside of sitting
[2:31:11] in living room says well I sit my kids
[2:31:13] in the living room. We read the Bible.
[2:31:15] Yeah, that's good. But it can be done in
[2:31:17] such a disconnected way. Read the Bible,
[2:31:19] close the Bible, everybody runs in their
[2:31:21] room.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry to tell you, but you didn't
[2:31:24] have you didn't make a lot of progress.
[2:31:27] Oh yeah, daddy's always we have to sit
[2:31:29] and listen to his Bible reading and so
[2:31:31] you're gonna do it.
[2:31:33] Are you done?
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:37] All right. Where I was? Okay, guys. I'm
[2:31:39] sorry where we were. Okay. Yeah. Now,
[2:31:41] let's kill more dudes. Let's kill more
[2:31:42] dudes.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; What if we close the Bible and say,
[2:31:47] "Okay,
[2:31:50] how many is happy to living in this
[2:31:52] house?"
[2:31:54] I'm not sure you want to ask that
[2:31:55] question.
[2:31:58] That'd be taking the bull by a horn. But
[2:32:03] you can put,
[2:32:05] as I said, the devil prosper in taboos.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; If you're afraid to talk about a certain
[2:32:13] topic,
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; you can be sure because you're afraid,
[2:32:17] you can be sure that the devil is
[2:32:18] already sitting in that topic.
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; And that's why you're afraid. You're
[2:32:22] afraid to cast that demon out of your
[2:32:23] house because it going to cost you
[2:32:25] something.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; I had to bring up tough subject where I
[2:32:30] would that bringing that topic would
[2:32:33] expose me as a poor father.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; that's what we call husband love your
[2:32:40] wife the way Christ laid his life. God
[2:32:44] left his throne. Sometime we want to sit
[2:32:46] on a throne of I'm the father. I'm the
[2:32:49] head of this house. But we got to step
[2:32:51] out of that throne and give our life.
[2:32:54] God didn't have to plead guilty to
[2:32:55] anything. But us, we have to step out of
[2:32:57] our big throne. Well, I'm a father. I'm
[2:32:59] this. I need respect.
[2:33:03] And so I've put topic, me and my wife
[2:33:05] put difficult topics on the table where
[2:33:08] we knew we would get the truth, but it
[2:33:11] brought healing in our home.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:14] And by God's grace,
[2:33:18] if I feel there's a taboo, there's
[2:33:19] something I see, you know, I I'll give
[2:33:22] you cues. Okay, teenager, I'm sorry. I'm
[2:33:24] going to I'm going to spill the beans.
[2:33:27] You know, this this famous roll of the
[2:33:29] eyes. You know,
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; you're saying something and then your
[2:33:32] teen's like,
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; you know, that that we got people
[2:33:36] laughing here. I'm not looking.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; But
[2:33:41] it means something is going on.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; Then you can say, well, you roll your
[2:33:46] eyes. That's rebellious. That's not
[2:33:47] respectful. When you say that, you
[2:33:50] squat. You you are you are shutting
[2:33:53] their mouth.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; What you can do is later tonight that
[2:33:56] that night says, "Okay, let's all sit in
[2:33:58] the living room." It says, "Okay,
[2:34:01] hey folks." Or whatever you want to call
[2:34:03] them, group, gang, family, whatever. I
[2:34:06] realized today I said something and one
[2:34:08] of you just roll the eyes and I want to
[2:34:11] know you're you're trying to say
[2:34:12] something. I annoy you.
[2:34:16] I annoy you. So I want to know what did
[2:34:20] I do over the years to reach this
[2:34:21] because I don't think this going to be
[2:34:22] healthy for a relationship and I don't
[2:34:24] want to annoy you. I tell my kids often
[2:34:26] my worst nightmare is me as a father to
[2:34:29] annoy my teenagers and I'm annoying
[2:34:31] fathers. You know what you are annoying.
[2:34:36] You are Bible says father don't
[2:34:38] irritate. Is it irritate? Because I'm
[2:34:40] French. What's the word?
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; Provoke.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; Provoke. Okay. In French we say
[2:34:44] irritate.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; Don't provoke. So father we have a
[2:34:50] tendency we call dad's joke. We are so
[2:34:53] boring.
[2:34:55] Okay. We get we get on their nerves. And
[2:34:58] it's often time I tell my I tell my I
[2:35:00] call them my kids. Now they're adults.
[2:35:02] through the years I told him I says my
[2:35:04] wor nightmare nightmare he says if I
[2:35:06] annoy you so much that you just want to
[2:35:08] be out of here
[2:35:10] so I said I want to have fellowship with
[2:35:12] you in a way that I'm respecting you
[2:35:13] you're we and we have a common respect
[2:35:15] it's really hard to ask respect you know
[2:35:17] something that we cannot demand respect
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; that's true
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; it's something that the children the the
[2:35:23] Bible God is asking you to honor and
[2:35:25] respect God is asking you so you have to
[2:35:27] do it but me my role as a father is to
[2:35:30] gain respect
[2:35:32] If I'm respectful,
[2:35:34] they'll respect me.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; If I'm disrespectful, they'll have to be
[2:35:38] respectful, but I'm going to annoy them
[2:35:41] in a way that they just don't want to be
[2:35:43] in my presence anymore.
[2:35:45] And then we don't have fellowship. And
[2:35:47] if we don't have fellowship, we're not
[2:35:48] connected. And if we're not connected,
[2:35:50] that means that when they go to the
[2:35:51] park,
[2:35:53] I got beautiful girls. So if a guy comes
[2:35:56] to the park and says, "Hey, beauty. Has
[2:35:58] someone ever told you that you're you're
[2:35:59] beautiful?" and that your dad never said
[2:36:02] any word, any affirming word. And and my
[2:36:04] daughter are clueless, that they're
[2:36:06] beautiful, they're they're loving, and
[2:36:07] they're this and they're that. And that
[2:36:09] a boy, like the prophet called a
[2:36:11] slicker, comes around.
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; The slicker comes with a hot rod, and he
[2:36:15] says, "Hey, beauty, you want to spend a
[2:36:16] great night. You're so beautiful.
[2:36:17] There's somebody." And then I joke
[2:36:19] around because I I I keep saying to my
[2:36:22] girls, I have this connection with them
[2:36:23] how much I love them and how much I'm
[2:36:25] proud of them and and and and whatever.
[2:36:27] And so I joke and when I preach on that
[2:36:30] my girls listening to that so they they
[2:36:32] think it's funny but I said I think my
[2:36:35] girls would tell that slicker. Yeah. My
[2:36:36] dad tells me that every
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; day.
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; What else you have to tell me I don't
[2:36:39] know already.
[2:36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; Because there's that connection.
[2:36:46] So love in the home is so protective.
[2:36:51] So filling the void everything can fill
[2:36:53] the void. In the modern age, you know,
[2:36:55] movies, music, gaming, sports, whatever.
[2:36:58] And and some of these things, not
[2:36:59] everything is bad there. But when we use
[2:37:02] those things to fill the void, we going
[2:37:04] to overdo it.
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; It's going to become something that we
[2:37:10] are a slave of
[2:37:14] because we use it to survive. We can do
[2:37:17] sports just for fun when when we have a
[2:37:20] strong connection at home or we can do
[2:37:23] it to be praised by so many people
[2:37:26] because it's the only place that I be
[2:37:28] I'm I'm being appreciated
[2:37:32] and I do it to survive.
[2:37:38] All right,
[2:37:39] we're closing.
[2:37:42] So if we wrap it up so at the end so
[2:37:46] that's why when when we think that well
[2:37:48] overnight you I don't know my kids my my
[2:37:50] teenager run away it's it suddenly it
[2:37:52] happened so if we go back to this famous
[2:37:54] word suddenly
[2:37:57] suddenly slams door suddenly he run away
[2:38:00] suddenly doesn't want to talk to me it
[2:38:02] didn't happen suddenly it's a buildup
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; that's right
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; it's a buildup and we don't know we're
[2:38:07] building something and redemption comes
[2:38:10] from the father redemption for the kids
[2:38:12] comes from the father and the mother.
[2:38:13] It's our role to try to reestablish
[2:38:16] community. It will come at a price. I've
[2:38:19] I've I've experienced that. It will come
[2:38:21] at a price. Who needs to pay the price?
[2:38:25] Parents needs to pay the price. Who paid
[2:38:28] the price for us? Humanity was bankrupt.
[2:38:31] Who came down?
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; A blameless one came down. He paid the
[2:38:34] price. That's the love God is asking us
[2:38:37] to have in the book of Ephesians.
[2:38:38] Husband, love your wife as Christ loved
[2:38:41] the church that he gave his life.
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, guess what happened
[2:38:49] once their heart is out? And at one
[2:38:52] point, what's going to happen is that
[2:38:55] the body will follow.
[2:38:58] And that's where some girls get married
[2:39:00] way too early and with the wrong guy
[2:39:02] because they wanted to be out there. So,
[2:39:04] the wrong guy becomes the the slicker
[2:39:06] becomes the savior.
[2:39:12] I talked to fathers or even a husband as
[2:39:15] wife, whatever. But it's like I don't
[2:39:18] know. Father's super frustrated because
[2:39:21] this young girl loves this guy. And I
[2:39:23] don't know what she sees in him. He's
[2:39:24] he's doesn't have a job. He He smells
[2:39:27] bad. He's he's stupid. And and and she
[2:39:29] loves him. And I'm like, before she
[2:39:33] loved him, you were supposed to be his
[2:39:34] first love.
[2:39:37] How was he able to? If you if you think
[2:39:41] if you if you look at this guy, you
[2:39:43] despise him so much, but he replaces
[2:39:46] you.
[2:39:50] She used him to replace you. So
[2:39:52] something has happened.
[2:39:57] So
[2:39:58] those things are important
[2:40:03] and what we don't realize is that once
[2:40:06] we get married we can repeat those
[2:40:08] pattern.
[2:40:10] When you were young when you were a
[2:40:12] teenager and things were doing bad at
[2:40:13] home instead of facing it as a teenager
[2:40:16] and and try to reestablish fellowship
[2:40:19] you ran away in this this this this
[2:40:22] that.
[2:40:23] If at a young age you're a teenager and
[2:40:25] you were struggling with your mother
[2:40:26] struggling and you ran into pornography,
[2:40:28] guess what you're going to do when
[2:40:29] you're going to get married and then you
[2:40:31] have a strong problem of of connection
[2:40:34] at your home? You're going to run into
[2:40:36] the same comfort
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; because you train yourself when there's
[2:40:40] a when when there's a problem with
[2:40:42] someone, I run to discomfort.
[2:40:45] &gt;&gt; But when I'm going to get married, it's
[2:40:47] going to be I got to oh, I can't wait to
[2:40:49] get married. It's going to be all
[2:40:50] solved.
[2:40:51] That's what I do when when I prepare
[2:40:53] when I prepare young premarital advice
[2:40:55] counsel when I sit with young people we
[2:40:58] go over these things and I'm asking
[2:41:01] question how do how do you solve problem
[2:41:03] at home how what's your relationship
[2:41:04] with your father talk to me about your
[2:41:06] father talk to me about your mother oh
[2:41:08] my mother this my father this and then I
[2:41:10] listening and listening and listening
[2:41:12] and I'm like okay I see now that you've
[2:41:14] not find the key to solve dispute
[2:41:20] and to find a way to establish
[2:41:21] connection. How do you think you're
[2:41:23] going to be able to do it once you get
[2:41:25] married? Because it's going to get
[2:41:26] tough. I understand now everything is
[2:41:28] rosecolored glasses. Everything looks
[2:41:29] great and oh, it's going to be
[2:41:30] different. Our story will be different.
[2:41:33] Yeah.
[2:41:34] Yeah. Wait.
[2:41:38] You're going to run away the same way
[2:41:41] that you ran away. You hit it. It's
[2:41:43] amazing.
[2:41:45] You were young. Tension house. You jump
[2:41:48] in the car. You ran off. You're married.
[2:41:50] tension in the car, tension in the
[2:41:51] house, run in the car, run away. Do the
[2:41:54] exact same thing.
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; I was doing the same thing. I was raised
[2:41:57] in restaurants all the time. Guess what?
[2:42:00] When when there was tension in the house
[2:42:02] and I was not feeling good, guess where
[2:42:03] I was going? I was getting up in the
[2:42:05] morning, get in my car, go have
[2:42:07] breakfast in my at restaurant on my own.
[2:42:09] And my wife was confused like, why why
[2:42:11] is he doing that? Why is he leaving?
[2:42:13] Even my my even my kids like why? I'm
[2:42:15] the father. They're together. But but
[2:42:17] but but for me I didn't feel part of
[2:42:19] like at first when they were really
[2:42:20] young I didn't feel part of the family.
[2:42:21] So when there was tension I was off I
[2:42:23] was getting and I I was getting comfort
[2:42:25] of eating on my own in a restaurant
[2:42:27] because that was my childhood.
[2:42:30] So when gets things to get tough in the
[2:42:32] house we run to we we resort we we uh
[2:42:35] what's the word?
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; Resort to our childhood plan because
[2:42:41] that's the only thing that we know that
[2:42:42] make us feel good. That's why we need to
[2:42:45] resolve those things. I know it's heavy.
[2:42:47] I know it's a lot this morning but but
[2:42:49] but these are principles.
[2:42:52] Okay, we try to find we're closing here.
[2:42:54] So
[2:42:56] there's a lot what we need to finish. So
[2:42:59] I just explained this. So the prophet is
[2:43:02] giving here. He says
[2:43:06] he says man so if man he was made to
[2:43:08] want to be com converted comforted. So
[2:43:11] then if he doesn't accept God's way,
[2:43:13] then he'll take it away for himself
[2:43:16] and he'll try to substitute something
[2:43:19] something to take the place of that Holy
[2:43:20] Spirit. Oh, I want you to listen to it.
[2:43:23] A man or woman that will not accept the
[2:43:25] Holy Spirit, the comforter will try to
[2:43:27] comfort themselves with some violent
[2:43:28] substitute that Satan will present to
[2:43:31] them. Satan just got plenty of
[2:43:34] substitute. But why do we have to have
[2:43:36] substitute when the Pentecost skies are
[2:43:38] full of the real? Why would I eat from a
[2:43:40] garbage can when a clean stables setting
[2:43:42] full of choice food? There would be
[2:43:44] something mentally wrong with me if I
[2:43:46] did that. Now, what a pity if it is to
[2:43:48] see that men will try to substitute
[2:43:50] something to take that place.
[2:43:52] Sometimes he'll try to ease his
[2:43:53] conscience by going out and etc, etc.
[2:43:56] So, you see the principle.
[2:43:58] There's a comforter, but then there's
[2:44:00] violent substitutes.
[2:44:04] There's a real connection you can have
[2:44:06] with your wife, which is healthy
[2:44:07] intimacy. Then there's pornography,
[2:44:10] which is a violent substitute.
[2:44:11] Pornography is violence.
[2:44:14] &gt;&gt; It's violence.
[2:44:16] Um, you can you can have healthy
[2:44:20] activities with people, but you can go
[2:44:22] play uh video games with full of
[2:44:24] violence. And so that quote is amazing
[2:44:27] because
[2:44:29] Satan's offers is substitute, violent
[2:44:31] substitute. You enter into a bad
[2:44:33] relationship with the wrong boy, it's
[2:44:35] going to be violent. Your heart's going
[2:44:36] to be crushed. It's a violent
[2:44:38] substitute. You don't get out of those
[2:44:40] fake substitute, not broken and bruised.
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; It's violent substitute.
[2:44:45] &gt;&gt; The only the only real thing is the Holy
[2:44:47] Ghost. He's a healer. It brings healing
[2:44:49] oil.
[2:44:51] &gt;&gt; But when we replace the genuine love,
[2:44:53] the genuine connection and replace with
[2:44:54] something else, we're going to get
[2:44:56] bruised. We're going to get broken.
[2:44:57] We're going to get hurt. So God, those
[2:45:00] kind of teaching this morning is not to
[2:45:02] bash people to make them feel bad. It's
[2:45:04] it's it's so it's it's it's bring
[2:45:07] protection because God God wants to stop
[2:45:09] the carnage. God wants to stop the the
[2:45:12] the the the violence.
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; And some of way some of you and I'm
[2:45:18] closing and musicians can come, but
[2:45:20] maybe some of you this morning feels a
[2:45:21] bit overwhelmed and I mean I'm with you.
[2:45:23] I've I've I've experienced that many
[2:45:24] times. Feel overwhelmed that says,
[2:45:26] "Okay, my lord, I'm bankrupt. I'm I'm
[2:45:28] past redemption. Don't let Satan step in
[2:45:32] this morning and sell you that it's a
[2:45:33] lie.
[2:45:35] &gt;&gt; And let me give you a word of hope and
[2:45:37] conf and and tonight we're going to
[2:45:38] we're going to we're going to probably
[2:45:40] Lord willing I feel that we're going to
[2:45:42] do the Rebecca story today. We're going
[2:45:44] to like do an in-depth analysis you and
[2:45:47] and you're going to see what the step
[2:45:49] the prophet took to get out of that rut.
[2:45:51] He was he was stuck with Rebecca
[2:45:53] slamming door and wanted to be out of
[2:45:55] the house with friends playing music,
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; rock and roll. He was he was stuck.
[2:45:59] She's 18. It it was done by then. It was
[2:46:02] done. The prophet knew it ends off.
[2:46:04] We're done. But then he took few steps.
[2:46:07] So we're going to study that together. I
[2:46:09] think I think you're going to enjoy it
[2:46:11] to give you hope. He took one step after
[2:46:13] the other. And it was stuff. His wife
[2:46:15] was like, "Honey, it's my daughter."
[2:46:17] Prophet was like, "It's my my daughter.
[2:46:18] My daughter, too.
[2:46:21] But let me explain you one one also one
[2:46:23] rule that I saw in in I've helped I've
[2:46:26] worked with a lot of families. I've
[2:46:27] worked with a lot of couples.
[2:46:33] Restoration is always a miracle in a
[2:46:35] sense that
[2:46:37] even if you had 10 years of tough
[2:46:38] marriage disconnected
[2:46:40] it doesn't take it does it never takes
[2:46:42] 10 years to fix it. It's never a ratio
[2:46:45] for one to one.
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; Redemption and healing of God is so
[2:46:49] powerful. Love is so more effective than
[2:46:51] destruction.
[2:46:53] &gt;&gt; Love is so much powerful than all the
[2:46:56] negligence.
[2:46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:57] &gt;&gt; I cannot give you a ratio, but it's
[2:46:59] amazing. And I've saw I saw a couple on
[2:47:02] on on rampage and and like on destroying
[2:47:05] mode, destruction mode for 10 years, 15
[2:47:07] years within couple of months of
[2:47:09] applying the right principle with the
[2:47:11] forgiveness of the Lord be able to
[2:47:13] rapidly rapidly covering, fixing,
[2:47:17] bringing back within couple. And so the
[2:47:19] ratio is amazing. But when we invite God
[2:47:21] to restore, thing can go fast. But but
[2:47:25] I'm not selling you something easy
[2:47:27] either.
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; You got to be patient. You don't try
[2:47:30] what I'm saying this morning. You have
[2:47:32] to become it.
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; Okay, brother Sam, I'm ready to try your
[2:47:36] recipe first. It's not a recipe and it's
[2:47:38] not something you try.
[2:47:40] &gt;&gt; You got to have it within yourself. You
[2:47:43] need Christ inside of you. It's not
[2:47:45] something you try. It's not something
[2:47:46] you do. It's something that you become.
[2:47:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:47:51] &gt;&gt; When God stepped down on on earth, he
[2:47:53] didn't try. I'm going to try redemption.
[2:47:55] I'm going to try die on the cross.
[2:47:56] That's who he was.
[2:47:59] &gt;&gt; And sometime we get stuck in religion
[2:48:01] where we do things. We try to do things.
[2:48:03] The gospel is not doing things. It's
[2:48:05] becoming somebody.
[2:48:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not doing this. This who I am.
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads. Lord
[2:48:14] Jesus,
[2:48:18] we felt your presence this morning and I
[2:48:21] know Lord somehow it is it it is also
[2:48:24] corrective. But I pray Lord this morning
[2:48:26] that
[2:48:29] people felt your love
[2:48:32] and felt mine too and the caring.
[2:48:39] And I don't know Lord anything about
[2:48:42] this church or the families.
[2:48:45] Almost everyone here I never met before.
[2:48:48] [Music]
[2:48:50] But I know Lord human nature is human
[2:48:53] nature.
[2:48:55] And there's something also with our
[2:48:56] ranks in the message that I've seen
[2:48:58] everywhere around the world. There's a
[2:49:01] huge misunderstanding.
[2:49:06] And I've seen Lord a lot of family
[2:49:08] neglect around the world because we took
[2:49:10] things for granted. Somehow we
[2:49:12] misunderstood something and we thought
[2:49:15] that if we go about the deep spiritual
[2:49:18] things, the simple things would take
[2:49:19] care of itself.
[2:49:22] And there's a huge price that's been
[2:49:23] paid by a whole generation.
[2:49:26] But I see something turning right now
[2:49:28] around the world.
[2:49:32] People start to think and listen
[2:49:37] and don't want to make the same mistake
[2:49:38] again.
[2:49:43] And Lord, I pray Lord, not knowing
[2:49:45] anyone here,
[2:49:48] but I pray to in Lord that you inspired
[2:49:52] Men of God, women of God, teenagers.
[2:49:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; Open their hearts, Lord,
[2:50:02] so we receive your love and knowing that
[2:50:05] with you everything is possible.
[2:50:07] Nobody's beyond redemption.
[2:50:10] We need to stop saying those things
[2:50:12] about I think you crossed the line and
[2:50:14] crossed the line. It's something that's
[2:50:15] been said for so many years.
[2:50:18] We don't know who crossed the line.
[2:50:20] We should quit talking about lines like
[2:50:24] we're trying to get rid of people, Lord.
[2:50:28] We should throw a love line instead
[2:50:31] and show redemption and
[2:50:34] and prepare the if if some has left. If
[2:50:37] if we have runaway teenagers in this
[2:50:39] church or runaway husband or runaway
[2:50:41] whatever situation, Lord, way may we
[2:50:44] make the ditch smaller.
[2:50:46] May we throw a lifeline somewhere, Lord.
[2:50:49] A love line, an apology of just owning
[2:50:53] where we stop pointing fingers and just
[2:50:55] own what what's on our side and say, "I
[2:50:58] didn't help. I'm sorry. I made things
[2:51:00] worse."
[2:51:02] And it's only when we change that we
[2:51:05] give hope to those people around us.
[2:51:07] Says, "I see it's not just words, but it
[2:51:10] means that he's a different person."
[2:51:13] Grant us, Lord. Grant us, Lord.
[2:51:16] You've changed me so much.
[2:51:20] Even my daughter lately told me, she
[2:51:23] said, "Daddy, you've changed so much. It
[2:51:25] gives me hope that God can change me,
[2:51:27] too."
[2:51:31] She said, "You've set such an example
[2:51:33] that nothing in your life is impossible
[2:51:36] that cannot be changed." You showed us.
[2:51:39] And she said, "It gave me hope that God
[2:51:42] can change some of the things in me
[2:51:43] also."
[2:51:45] The greatest example we can give is when
[2:51:47] God change us.
[2:51:50] &gt;&gt; It's not what we say, but it's what we
[2:51:52] do.
[2:51:55] And it's what we do, not expecting a
[2:51:57] result like we're trying it. We do it
[2:52:00] because this is who we are.
[2:52:03] Inspire us. I pray Lord tonight, this
[2:52:05] morning in Jesus name.
[2:52:09] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:52:13] Grace.
