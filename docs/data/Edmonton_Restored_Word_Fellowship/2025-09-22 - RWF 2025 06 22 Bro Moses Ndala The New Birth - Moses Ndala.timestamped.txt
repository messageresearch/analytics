[29:50] Tonight,
[30:42] We return
[30:46] to
[30:48] as I try
[30:50] day by day.
[30:55] Often meet with
[31:01] and there's joy
[31:04] in my way.
[31:08] But I have a calm
[31:12] assurance
[31:14] that my soul the Lord will keep.
[31:19] And in him
[31:22] there is strength
[31:25] for every need.
[31:31] Oh, his grace
[31:35] is sufficient
[31:38] for me.
[31:44] And his love
[31:47] is abundant
[31:50] and free.

[32:02] just to know. Oh, just to know that his
[32:08] grace
[32:10] it is sufficient
[32:14] for me.
[32:19] When the tempter
[32:22] brings confusion
[32:25] and I don't know what to do.
[32:31] On my knees
[32:33] I turn to Jesus
[32:37] for I know he'll see me through.
[32:42] Then despair is turned to victory.
[32:49] Every dove just melts away.
[32:53] And in him there is hope for every
[33:01] day.
[33:02] [Music]
[33:05] Oh, his grace

[41:44] of God. Let our heart hear from you Lord
[41:47] as the song was sung earlier. Let him
[41:50] that hear hear what the word of God
[41:53] says. Father Lord, let the spiritual
[41:56] hear hear more than the literal words,
[41:59] Father, that he can go beyond
[42:02] our desires to please you. Our desire is
[42:04] to be better Christians. Our desire,
[42:07] Father, is to be have better families.
[42:10] Our desire, Father, Lord, oh Lord, is to
[42:14] get ready for the rapture, Father.
[42:17] We don't present, Father, the preacher
[42:20] does not pre present people to himself.
[42:23] He has nothing to offer father. We
[42:25] desire to direct the people to Christ.
[42:28] Christ is the solution. Christ is the
[42:31] shepherd. Christ father is the one Lord
[42:35] who will meet each heart father one day.
[42:38] So that's why father we desire Lord to
[42:41] just humble oursel before the king and
[42:45] hear from you father. Bless each family
[42:48] here Lord. the fathers, the mothers, the
[42:52] young people as the prayer was made
[42:54] earlier father that also the burden of
[42:56] my heart the young people father that
[42:59] each person will come and close
[43:01] relationship with you father don't let
[43:04] them consider this as a religion of the
[43:06] father the religion of the mother but
[43:09] let it father become a personal
[43:10] relationship
[43:12] that yourself speak to them father lord
[43:16] we we surrender oursel to you Lord and
[43:18] we give you the glory and the honor in
[43:21] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[43:27] Amen.

[45:46] Brother Caleb is getting better and
[45:47] better becoming professional now. Huh.
[45:53] That's good.
[46:02] Matthew 25th,
[46:08] we read from verse one to verse 13.
[46:15] Then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[46:17] likened unto 10 virgins, which took
[46:20] their lambs, and went forth to meet the
[46:23] bridegroom.
[46:24] And five of them were were wise, and
[46:27] five were foolish.
[46:30] They that were foolish took their lambs
[46:32] and took no oil with them. But the wise
[46:37] took oil in their vessels with their
[46:39] lambs. When the bridegroom ter slumbered
[46:43] and slept,
[46:46] and at midnight there was a cry made,
[46:48] "Behold, the bridegroom cometh, go ye
[46:52] out to meet him." Then all those virgins
[46:56] arose and trimmed their lambs. And the
[46:59] foolish said unto the wise, give us of
[47:01] your oil, for our lambs are gone out.
[47:05] But the wise answered, and saying, Not
[47:07] so, lest there be not enough for us and
[47:12] you. But go ye rather to them that sell,
[47:15] and buy for yourselves. And while they
[47:18] went to buy, the bridegroom came, and
[47:21] they that were ready went in with him to
[47:24] the marriage, and the door was shut.
[47:27] Afterward came also the other virgins,
[47:30] saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But he
[47:34] answered and said, Verily I say unto
[47:37] you, I know you not. Watch therefore,
[47:41] for you know neither the day nor the
[47:44] hour wherein the Son of Man cometh.
[47:48] Amen. God bless his word. Can have a
[47:50] seat.
[47:53] Amen.
[48:17] I would like to continue on the subject
[48:19] that I'm on. Um
[48:22] just want to not just to
[48:25] take time for the sake of taking time
[48:27] but I just want to some of the things
[48:29] just to to linger on it a little bit
[48:31] more just to become a little bit just to
[48:35] be um anchored a little more and for
[48:38] many reasons and one of them is a is
[48:44] we have new generations new people and
[48:47] and new generation they're not necessary
[48:50] things maybe just go on top of their
[48:52] head and they hear terms and they don't
[48:54] know what it is and and then and and
[48:57] then at some point they get disconnected
[48:59] because there's no you don't have time
[49:02] to go through really that and show okay
[49:05] this is this this is this this is that
[49:08] so before you write a a nice sentence
[49:11] you need to know the alphabet needed to
[49:12] go to the ABCs and we can afford to do
[49:16] that we are nice church we have like a
[49:20] family we are a little bit small in
[49:22] number so we can handle that I think and
[49:25] um and we can be patient on one another
[49:28] so that's I know these things but it's
[49:30] just good to go through them slowly and
[49:32] just uh uh help us to be ourself and
[49:36] reminded Peter said you know I'm I'm I'm
[49:39] I'm sending this letter to you stirring
[49:41] your heart by the way of remembrance
[49:44] just just reminding people and reminding
[49:47] people and just what we need and the
[49:50] second part as well is even how long we
[49:52] have been in the message still good to
[49:55] come and recheck again so Lord my lamps
[49:59] are are they trimmed are they ready is
[50:02] everything fine amen it's not there to
[50:05] create doubt and I emphasize that on on
[50:08] Wednesday sometimes Wednesday a bit so
[50:11] I'm don't go maybe leave it that on a
[50:13] positive way because um you know you
[50:18] don't want to be the only one to be like
[50:20] oh um
[50:23] how can I put this way oh I I don't am I
[50:27] is that creating doubt on the experience
[50:29] or the place where you are no so if you
[50:32] have already reached that place is not
[50:34] to create doubt on you or try to uncch
[50:37] Christianize you that's not the point
[50:39] otherwise you will be u you know you you
[50:42] will be restarting every time no that's
[50:44] not the purpose but it's also to check
[50:46] that oh god where am I is is my seat
[50:50] belt on kind of say is my seat belt on
[50:52] and check. Oh, it's still there. Oh,
[50:54] thank you, Lord. It's there. Amen.
[50:56] So, that's what we want there. Amen.
[50:59] Amen.
[51:01] So, we saw that in order to find in
[51:03] order to build in order to build a
[51:06] strong building the statue of a perfect
[51:09] man, I'm putting as a statue of the
[51:11] fullness of Christ. In order to have the
[51:14] statue of the perfect man in order to
[51:16] build it properly, you need a good
[51:18] foundation. Amen. And the real
[51:21] foundation or the good foundation you
[51:22] need to have is faith. The faith and we
[51:26] we saw that that there are no multiple
[51:28] faith that not multiple faith different
[51:30] faith or different kinds of faith. Maybe
[51:33] maybe by lack of words sometimes say fa
[51:36] faith for healing faith for this. Yes,
[51:37] that's true. But there are not different
[51:40] kinds of faith. only one faith that
[51:42] faith that was given and the true faith
[51:45] and that what we have need to have amen
[51:48] but faith I believe faith also increases
[51:51] meaning can have faith but in God give
[51:53] me more faith I need more faith I need
[51:56] to mature I need my faith to become
[51:58] mature I need my faith to become
[52:00] stronger amen that's what we need and
[52:03] that what the prophet says and that what
[52:04] we need amen
[52:07] so he says he will say faith does the
[52:10] rest of it. Faith does the rest. So you
[52:13] must have faith for a foundation. All
[52:17] Christianity, all you are, all you'll
[52:19] ever be is based upon faith in the word.
[52:23] That's the reason I believe the word.
[52:25] Amen. So I can't put my faith on nothing
[52:29] else. If I was going to if I was going
[52:32] if I was going to put it on the church,
[52:34] which church would I put it on?
[52:36] Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist,
[52:39] Pentecostals or even say, "Oh, message
[52:42] church." No, you cannot put your faith
[52:44] in the church. It has to be on the word
[52:46] of God.
[52:47] Says, "Where would I put it on?" I don't
[52:49] know. They all scrabble up and
[52:52] everything has twist lines and
[52:54] everything else. But when I put my faith
[52:57] in his word, it's anchored. Amen. So
[53:00] your faith, our faith has to be anchored
[53:02] on the word of God. Amen.
[53:04] Nobody interpreted here. It is that save
[53:08] the Lord. Then I believe that that's the
[53:10] basis. That's the foundation. Amen. And
[53:13] then we go on in the message statue of
[53:15] perfect man. We talk about the vision.
[53:17] And then later on it says know the
[53:18] vision. Then if this vision happened
[53:21] perfectly exactly the way they say that
[53:23] they do and this church here knows
[53:25] that's right. Then what about his word?
[53:28] See it's more sure than the vision. The
[53:31] word of God is more sure than the
[53:32] vision. Even the prophet when he had a
[53:35] vision, he had any vision. He had to
[53:37] check the vision that he had and compare
[53:39] it with the word of God because the word
[53:41] of God was is the absolute he could not
[53:44] put the vision above the word of God. He
[53:46] has to rely on what the word of God
[53:48] says. Amen. So people can have vision.
[53:51] People can have prophecies even some
[53:53] prophecies that are being realized. But
[53:55] every prophecy has to be checked with
[53:57] the word of God. Amen. You know as a
[53:59] prophet as a prophet give the example
[54:01] about Micah and the 400 prophets. So
[54:04] those 400 prophet they were prophesizing
[54:07] good things. They were prophesizing
[54:08] right things all most of the time I
[54:10] think even all the time but at that time
[54:13] they prophesied something that was wrong
[54:16] with the word of God. Amen.
[54:18] And they had the spirit it was anointing
[54:21] prophet we call them false anointing. So
[54:23] they go they were people but they had
[54:26] anointing a false anointing upon them.
[54:27] and they prophesy. They didn't compare
[54:29] it with the word of God. But Micah knew
[54:32] what Elijah said about Ahab. He could
[54:35] compare that with the word of God and
[54:37] stay with the word of God. So what? Yes.
[54:40] The absolute is the vision or the word
[54:42] of God. Is the word of God that is
[54:43] always the absolute. Amen.
[54:46] You know the pro God had to rebuke the
[54:48] prophet because the prophet at some
[54:50] point he had to trust only you know when
[54:52] he has to pray for the sick he has to
[54:54] wait for a vision. Amen.
[54:55] I said I'm wait for the vision then to
[54:57] see then I can then I can have faith. He
[54:59] said no that's not the right way.
[55:01] The right way is to believe what the
[55:03] word of God says.
[55:05] So he God is recommend he's calling us
[55:07] to have the perfect faith. We is to
[55:10] believe the word what the word of God
[55:11] says you take it. You put in your heart
[55:14] you believe it and you move forward.
[55:15] Amen.
[55:16] You don't doubt you don't reason. You
[55:18] don't try to think. You don't even hope.
[55:21] You go beyond hope. You believe what God
[55:23] says. what God says is the right thing
[55:26] to do. Amen.
[55:27] Amen.
[55:28] says this house and later on down there
[55:30] it says so now you're going to build a
[55:33] house and you pour the foundation say
[55:35] boy I got here you got the foundation to
[55:37] build your house on now you got to build
[55:39] a house that's where the thing comes in
[55:41] this morning we're going to talk about
[55:43] now a house this foundation is first
[55:46] what is the foundation of Christianity
[55:48] is faith in the word of god that your
[55:51] foundation and now you're building a
[55:53] house you put your upright and
[55:55] everything else brotherhood and say some
[55:57] of the campers. Some of the carpenters
[56:00] and contractors here could tell us how
[56:02] you build your house. But I'm going to
[56:04] tell you how you build your spiritual
[56:06] house where God can dwell.
[56:08] He wants to dwell in you. He wants to
[56:10] make you like himself. He wants you to
[56:13] be reflecting rather he want you to be
[56:16] reflecting his being. Amen. So when you
[56:19] have that foundation, it is in order to
[56:21] build a house so that you can reflect
[56:23] Christ. Reflect Christ in your house.
[56:26] Reflect Christ out to your workplace.
[56:28] Reflect Christ in school. Reflect Christ
[56:30] in the marketplace. Reflect Christ
[56:32] wherever you are. You be reflecting
[56:34] Christ. That what he desire. The
[56:37] three-fold purpose of God is to see
[56:39] Christ in the sec. Second part of the
[56:42] purpose of God is to see Christ being
[56:45] manifested in the bride. Amen. Do you
[56:48] believe that this morning?
[56:50] says that you know in the old time when
[56:52] they used to make gold before they had
[56:54] the smelter to burn it out they used to
[56:57] build the gold out build the sludge out
[57:00] the iron and the copper and the staff
[57:02] out just keep beating it and turn it
[57:05] over beating it the Indians do that now
[57:08] beating gold and they beat it amen you
[57:11] know oh sometime we don't like that but
[57:13] we we go through beating amen beating
[57:16] through the word of God sometime beating
[57:18] through the trial It's God beating us.
[57:21] He knows what the gold can stand.
[57:23] He knows the quality of the gold inside
[57:26] of you, inside of me. That's why we can
[57:28] allow some beating because he want the
[57:30] reflection of himself.
[57:32] His beat is in is beating is beating. He
[57:35] know the go that because he want to see
[57:37] himself inside of that gold. Amen. You
[57:40] know how they could tell all the iron
[57:42] was out of it and all the dirt and the
[57:45] staff and the draws was out of it when
[57:48] the one that was beating could see his
[57:50] own reflection like a mirror in it. It
[57:54] was clean and clear enough till it
[57:56] reflected the bitter. Lord I want to
[57:59] reflect you Lord.
[58:01] My life I desire you to be reflected
[58:04] inside of me. And I believe it's the
[58:06] desire of all of us of all of us.
[58:09] Say when that's where we supposed to do
[58:11] reflect the son of god now we are
[58:14] supposed to do his work he said he that
[58:16] believe on me say John 14:7 he that
[58:19] believe on me the works that I do shall
[58:21] he do also you are beginning to reflect
[58:25] the works of Christ then it says so many
[58:28] of us try to do the works of Christ
[58:30] before the reflection of Christ is in us
[58:33] now that's the trouble we find that
[58:35] those things happening if we see
[58:38] stumbles along along the road we find
[58:40] the scribe heap of ministers of
[58:41] Christians piled along the road is
[58:44] because they didn't go into it the right
[58:47] way and the right way is have faith and
[58:51] be born again that's the laying of the
[58:54] foundation
[58:55] so we talk about faith and we talk also
[58:58] about the new birth amen so this morning
[59:01] I'm going to go a little bit about the
[59:02] new birth is a must is not an option
[59:08] is not an option. It's not something you
[59:10] can put aside. It's a must. You must to
[59:12] come to the new birth. You must be
[59:15] filled with the Holy Ghost. It has to be
[59:17] the life of Jesus Christ inside of you.
[59:20] You can't go a Christian life with just
[59:23] reasoning or thinking or intellectual
[59:25] faith. It has to come to where it
[59:27] becomes a personal revelation to you.
[59:30] Amen. And in order to be born again, we
[59:32] must go through the process. We must go
[59:34] to We last time. We have to go through
[59:36] the process. We have to go through
[59:37] repentance. We have to believe the word
[59:40] of God. We have to accept the word of
[59:41] God. We have to go through repentance.
[59:44] We have to repent. We have to be
[59:45] baptized in the wonderful name of the
[59:48] Lord Jesus Christ. That the only valid
[59:51] baptism that there exists in the Bible.
[59:53] It is to be is to be baptized in the
[59:55] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[59:57] then because the promise is there for
[59:59] the remission of our sins. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:02] In acts two says when they heard this
[1:00:05] mean they heard the word of God. So you
[1:00:07] have to hear the word of God. Then they
[1:00:09] were prickled in their heart and said
[1:00:11] unto Peter and to the rest of the
[1:00:12] apostles men and brother what shall we
[1:00:15] do? And Peter said, it's a common
[1:00:16] scripture I'm just reading. Repent and
[1:00:18] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:00:21] of Jesus Christ for the remission of of
[1:00:23] your sins and you shall receive you
[1:00:26] shall receive not you might receive. You
[1:00:29] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:00:32] Ghost.
[1:00:32] If you go through the process sincerely
[1:00:35] from your heart, God is obligated to his
[1:00:38] own word to fill you with the Holy
[1:00:40] Ghost. Actually God desires to fill us
[1:00:43] more with his holy ghost than sometimes
[1:00:45] ourself desiring it. God is eager and
[1:00:48] desiring to fill us with more of the
[1:00:51] Holy Ghost. Amen. For the promise is
[1:00:53] unto you and to your children and to all
[1:00:56] that are a far off even as many as the
[1:00:58] Lord our God shall call. So that promise
[1:01:01] is still valid for you today. That
[1:01:03] promise still valid for me today. Amen.
[1:01:05] It's not something of the past. It's
[1:01:07] something still real. Amen. That word of
[1:01:09] God is still real.
[1:01:14] That's when they show that without the
[1:01:16] Holy Ghost in the soul, it's only
[1:01:19] intellectual faith.
[1:01:22] It's not the real personal revelation
[1:01:24] yet. Mim understand and reason. Oh God,
[1:01:28] I believe that. I see that. It makes
[1:01:29] sense there. But it has to become a
[1:01:32] personal revelation in the soul. Has to
[1:01:35] become faith in the soul. Abraham
[1:01:37] believed God and it was accounted for
[1:01:40] him for righteousness. He left one time
[1:01:43] we get to that place one day maybe I
[1:01:45] would like to talk that faith has to be
[1:01:47] expressed through works.
[1:01:49] Amen. So faith has to come where it
[1:01:51] becomes alive. Can't just say no I
[1:01:54] believe I believe but the life is not
[1:01:56] expressing it. They have to go God help
[1:01:59] me that that faith becomes automatic in
[1:02:01] my life. You see in my life, in my
[1:02:03] actions, my works that when faith comes
[1:02:06] to maturity, Amen. Peter, James would
[1:02:10] say when faith is complete, it becomes
[1:02:12] perfect.
[1:02:13] Perfect becomes complete. Amen.
[1:02:16] So there it says Abraham left his place.
[1:02:19] He obeyed the word of God and he
[1:02:21] believed God and God. But that faith,
[1:02:25] God has to seal that faith. God has to
[1:02:27] accept that faith. It was God's faith
[1:02:29] himself. God gave him that faith but it
[1:02:32] has to come to the point where God has
[1:02:34] to give him the sign of circumcision
[1:02:37] which is a sign which is a type of the
[1:02:39] Holy Ghost is the type of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:41] in our time. So you believe but you have
[1:02:43] to come to the place where God fills you
[1:02:46] with the Holy Ghost. So that faith of
[1:02:48] Abraham was there but he has also to go
[1:02:51] through steps as he's increasing as the
[1:02:54] revelation is progressing as the re
[1:02:56] revelation is increasing so that faith
[1:02:59] becomes more and more real in in his in
[1:03:01] his life. Amen. As he had that the sign
[1:03:04] of circumcision was the trial finished?
[1:03:07] No. He was still having trials. Was God
[1:03:10] finishing training him? No. God was
[1:03:13] still training him. Amen. Faith was
[1:03:15] still increasing. faith was still
[1:03:16] increasing to the point where God even
[1:03:18] when he gave him the final trial, God
[1:03:20] says, "Now Abraham, I know that you
[1:03:23] believe me."
[1:03:24] He had the same faith from the
[1:03:26] beginning, but that came to the point
[1:03:27] where God himself has to testify to
[1:03:30] Abraham that now I know that you believe
[1:03:33] me because you are ready to give your
[1:03:35] own son. Even though I've given to you,
[1:03:37] but you are ready to give your own son.
[1:03:39] On Wednesday, we show that because the
[1:03:42] faith comes by experience. Amen. It
[1:03:44] increased by experience. It grows by
[1:03:46] experience. Abraham believed. But
[1:03:48] Abraham had to grow in that faith in
[1:03:51] that revelation. Amen.
[1:03:53] Once you have the Holy Ghost, you have
[1:03:55] the real faith in your heart. But it
[1:03:57] might be like a small seed, a master
[1:04:01] seed in your heart. Don't be discouraged
[1:04:04] in one way, but don't also stop there.
[1:04:07] You need to grow. Amen. You need become
[1:04:09] a mature. You need to have the
[1:04:10] preeminence your life. It has to become
[1:04:12] complete. He has to actually all the
[1:04:14] steps are based upon faith. So the Bible
[1:04:18] says when upon your faith adds virtue.
[1:04:20] It's not that you are adding like adding
[1:04:22] but that faith as is growing is being
[1:04:24] expressed more in all the different
[1:04:26] attribute it comes but when small faith
[1:04:30] or as a seed but becomes more and more
[1:04:32] mature. Amen.
[1:04:34] Amen.
[1:04:34] So now today
[1:04:37] what the prophet says he says in Lord
[1:04:40] show us the father and sufficient us.
[1:04:42] That's the way a Christian is. We are
[1:04:44] planted together in Christ Jesus who is
[1:04:47] the inexhaustible fountain of life. We
[1:04:50] are planted in Christ and we just drink
[1:04:53] and drink and drink and push out and
[1:04:56] everything we have need of for the
[1:04:58] earthly journey. And everything we have
[1:05:01] need of of the for the earthly journey,
[1:05:04] divine healing, the power of God, and
[1:05:06] all these other things is in every
[1:05:09] individual here that has received the
[1:05:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost. For you are
[1:05:15] planted in Christ, the prophet says,
[1:05:17] hallelujah.
[1:05:19] The Holy Ghost baptism. Yes, sir.
[1:05:21] Everything you have need of for this
[1:05:23] life journey, even the rapture is right
[1:05:26] in you there. Amen. I believe it with
[1:05:28] all my heart. Even the rapture is
[1:05:31] included in the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:33] Even the rapture is included when you
[1:05:35] are born again. You have the rapture
[1:05:37] inside of you.
[1:05:38] The rapture cannot happen without you
[1:05:40] going. Amen. Because God cannot lose his
[1:05:43] is elected. God cannot lose his son. God
[1:05:46] cannot lose his daughter. The one that
[1:05:48] have an experience of the new birth.
[1:05:50] Amen. But as you have that experience of
[1:05:52] the new, it's a just a little baby
[1:05:54] inside of you. In order to come to the
[1:05:56] fullness, it has to grow. Amen. That's
[1:05:58] why the prophet is saying you have to
[1:06:00] drink. You have to drink. You have to
[1:06:02] eat. You have to drink. You have to eat.
[1:06:04] You have to drink. Amen. Does it mean
[1:06:06] that you you will be lost? No. You will
[1:06:07] never be lost because the seal there you
[1:06:10] are sealed until the day of redemption.
[1:06:12] But you have to grow. Amen. We have to
[1:06:15] grow. Lord, fill our soul with more of
[1:06:17] the word of God so that we grow. Amen.
[1:06:20] Lord, help us to find time to spend time
[1:06:23] to stay in relationship with you so that
[1:06:26] the inner man can grow. Amen.
[1:06:28] Otherwise, he's weak. Otherwise, he get
[1:06:30] small trials and we we get we get we we
[1:06:33] we we get we get balanced, tossed about
[1:06:36] here and there, here and there, here and
[1:06:38] there. But when faith is so mature is
[1:06:41] just resting. Amen. The faith that is
[1:06:43] mature is resting. No matter what
[1:06:46] happens is the master of all
[1:06:48] circumstances. But how what was the
[1:06:50] secret? Feed upon the word of God.
[1:06:53] Drink from that water more and more.
[1:06:56] Amen.
[1:06:58] And the enemy that where he knows where
[1:07:00] to stop us.
[1:07:02] Yeah, that's right.
[1:07:03] He doesn't want us to make that that
[1:07:05] seed become mature. He doesn't want the
[1:07:08] inner man to become stronger. He doesn't
[1:07:10] want that man that the prophet called
[1:07:12] faith is that that that man with
[1:07:15] muscles. He does he want him to stay
[1:07:18] weak. He don't want to be always basing
[1:07:21] on on reasoning and and trusting on our
[1:07:24] five senses. But our five senses cannot
[1:07:28] give us the perfect victory. Amen. It's
[1:07:30] good but it's not good enough. In order
[1:07:33] to be strong in this time of Leodysia,
[1:07:36] we need to live by faith. The just shall
[1:07:40] live by faith is more real today maybe
[1:07:42] than more than the time of of Lut. We
[1:07:45] have to live by faith. Amen. And the
[1:07:47] perfect faith. Why we can have perfect
[1:07:50] faith? Because we have received the
[1:07:52] perfect word. God has given us all the
[1:07:55] materials to make ourselves ready for
[1:07:57] the rapture, brothers and sisters.
[1:07:59] Amen.
[1:08:00] Amen.
[1:08:04] So the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost
[1:08:07] baptism. Yes, sir. Everything you have
[1:08:09] need of for this life journey, even the
[1:08:11] rapture is right in you. Then don't
[1:08:14] resent that. He says that's the truth.
[1:08:16] The rapture is in us. Now I will prove
[1:08:20] it by the gospel and say those who have
[1:08:22] been justified those who have been those
[1:08:24] those who have who justified he has
[1:08:26] already glorified then heaven today we
[1:08:28] are glorified in the presence of God
[1:08:31] right now. Amen.
[1:08:32] Amen.
[1:08:33] Says but more than it I'm just pushing
[1:08:35] out to it. Amen. Glory God in his word.
[1:08:38] I believe it. So just pushing it out.
[1:08:40] Amen. So that what we have received
[1:08:43] today. I would like to emphasize on the
[1:08:45] importance of the new birth in the face
[1:08:46] of the time we are living in. If I can
[1:08:48] give you the type is the two marks but
[1:08:51] three types of people in the gentile
[1:08:54] dispensation. So there are two marks but
[1:08:56] there three types of people in the
[1:08:59] gentile dispensation. Let me just to
[1:09:01] emphasize a little bit on the importance
[1:09:03] of the new birth. The prophet says there
[1:09:06] is only one going to be there is only
[1:09:09] going to be two classes of people in the
[1:09:12] last days. Both of them is going to wear
[1:09:15] a mark. The mark of God is the baptism
[1:09:18] of the Holy Spirit without a shadow of
[1:09:21] doubt.
[1:09:27] Sorry about that.
[1:09:30] Something happened.
[1:09:32] Wake you up.
[1:09:38] I put this um
[1:09:41] I used to be a teacher of my children
[1:09:42] but
[1:09:51] Mr. Americ
[1:10:05] said the one is a mark of God.
[1:10:16] Just put that in the visual terms. But
[1:10:20] as a Sunday school teaching this
[1:10:22] morning. Simple, but I wanted to stay.
[1:10:24] It says, "The mark of God is the baptism
[1:10:27] of the Holy Spirit without a shadow of
[1:10:30] that." I preached that not long ago by
[1:10:32] the Holy Spirit, by the Holy Spirit's
[1:10:34] health, and the word of God proved it
[1:10:37] that the seal of God is the baptism of
[1:10:39] the Holy Ghost. Ephesians 4:30 says,
[1:10:43] "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[1:10:46] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[1:10:48] your redemption. Without your Holy
[1:10:51] Spirit, you are not sealed. So this is
[1:10:54] the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:10:56] Holy Ghost. Holy Spirit.
[1:11:02] That's what we have. Must have. It's a
[1:11:04] must. It's not an option. It's a must.
[1:11:06] Says we must have the Holy Ghost. And
[1:11:09] says without the Holy Spirit, you are
[1:11:11] not sealed. For the Holy Spirit is God's
[1:11:13] seal. And then that all that was not
[1:11:17] sealed by the Holy Spirit was took on
[1:11:20] the mark of the beast. And the mark of
[1:11:23] the beast is a mark of apostasy which is
[1:11:26] rejecting the Holy Spirit.
[1:11:28] See what I mean? That when the hear of
[1:11:31] Jubilee or the blast comes that people
[1:11:33] are receiving the Holy Spirit, you
[1:11:36] deliberately willfully turn it down. God
[1:11:39] has no more or not under not under any
[1:11:43] more obligation to ever speak to you no
[1:11:46] more.
[1:11:48] That's the mark of the beast.
[1:11:58] So if you reject the Holy Ghost, the
[1:12:01] Holy Spirit, you
[1:12:04] might have the mark of the beast. And as
[1:12:07] a type in the holy in the the old
[1:12:09] testament those who refused when the
[1:12:13] trumpet sound was sounding they refused
[1:12:15] to be liberated. They wanted to stay
[1:12:18] slaves to their masters. They like the
[1:12:20] place where they wanted to be. They
[1:12:22] wanted their worldly life. They want to
[1:12:24] stay with the maybe my master is
[1:12:26] treating me well. Maybe I believe of
[1:12:28] pleasure where I'm staying where that's
[1:12:30] where I want to be. I want to continue
[1:12:32] my own life. Oh then the high priest. Oh
[1:12:35] it's fine. And you want to you refuse
[1:12:37] the Holy Ghost. All fine. Continue your
[1:12:39] own way. But I I will just put a sign
[1:12:42] upon you here that you can never be free
[1:12:44] anymore.
[1:12:45] And I will put that mark on you as a
[1:12:47] type of mark of you so you can hear the
[1:12:49] word of God, but it doesn't Oh, I'm not
[1:12:51] sensitive to the word of God anymore.
[1:12:53] Oh, that's a very dangerous spot to be.
[1:12:57] Why you think that, oh, the word of God
[1:12:58] doesn't make any sense. Oh, I don't it's
[1:13:01] it's not my place. And
[1:13:03] no, that's a very dangerous place to be.
[1:13:06] You'd rather have and even though you
[1:13:08] don't have the Holy Ghost, the right
[1:13:11] attitude. I think brother Boris said
[1:13:14] that as well. And and that's always a
[1:13:16] good attitude to have. Even if you don't
[1:13:18] have the Holy Ghost, don't reject the
[1:13:21] Holy Ghost.
[1:13:22] Don't reject the word of God. Don't
[1:13:24] reject the message. But pray, God, I
[1:13:27] don't have the Holy Ghost, but help me,
[1:13:28] Lord. Lord, I'm not living where I
[1:13:31] should be yet, but Lord, help me. Lord,
[1:13:34] don't reject. Don't refuse it. Don't
[1:13:35] say, "Oh, no, this is this is nothing.
[1:13:37] Oh, no, this is just a man's idea. Oh,
[1:13:39] no, this is just the preacher things.
[1:13:41] Oh, this is just that's church the
[1:13:42] theology." No, Lord, help me. Help me to
[1:13:45] receive what they're talking. Maybe I
[1:13:47] don't see it properly, but help me Lord.
[1:13:49] I don't want to be in this category
[1:13:51] where I'm rejecting it or I'm trying to
[1:13:54] find excuses, you know, I don't want it.
[1:13:56] This is nothing. No. Amen.
[1:13:58] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:03] So then you'll be marked off and all the
[1:14:05] old and all the old types of the old
[1:14:08] testament all the types and shadows of
[1:14:10] the new and to reject Christ and to turn
[1:14:13] him down is knocked at at your door and
[1:14:16] you are on a danger line of being bored
[1:14:19] to the ear. Faith comes by hearing
[1:14:22] hearing of the word of God.
[1:14:24] And God will put a blind over your ear
[1:14:27] that you'll never be able to understand
[1:14:30] no more. You'll no more. You will do no
[1:14:33] more than criticize the gospel as long
[1:14:36] as you live. Oh God have mercy. I don't
[1:14:38] want anyone to be there. God have mercy
[1:14:40] Lord. And die and be lost forever. What
[1:14:43] a time. Why a Jubilee time while the
[1:14:46] doors are open? Do you realize that this
[1:14:48] is same baptism of the Holy Spirit? So
[1:14:51] we are living in the end time. We are
[1:14:54] not going always going to have a
[1:14:56] tomorrow. There will be one day where it
[1:14:58] will be the last day.
[1:15:00] I like that the song that brother Andrew
[1:15:03] put there. Don't you know that we are in
[1:15:05] the last day? Amen. Don't you know that
[1:15:07] we are in the end time? We are really in
[1:15:08] the end time. So it's not time to
[1:15:10] postpone it to put to another time. We
[1:15:13] don't have the all the time here. God.
[1:15:15] There is time where God's patience is
[1:15:17] going to be over. And then those who
[1:15:19] have the Holy Ghost will have the Holy
[1:15:21] Ghost. Don't have the Holy Ghost will
[1:15:23] have the mark of the beast.
[1:15:25] That's right.
[1:15:28] Now the messenger prophet says, "Who
[1:15:30] sigh and cry for the abominations that
[1:15:32] did in the city?" Where do you see that?
[1:15:34] I can show you 10 times speaking in
[1:15:37] tongues to one that's already burned for
[1:15:39] sin. They can't even pray an hour. But
[1:15:42] did you know the Bible said mark only
[1:15:44] those who sighted and cried for the
[1:15:46] abomination in the city? How many have
[1:15:49] read it? Sure. That was the Holy Spirit
[1:15:52] come forth to mark the people. Say to
[1:15:55] the destroying angel, go forth and
[1:15:57] destroy everything that doesn't have
[1:15:59] that mark upon them. And the mark of God
[1:16:02] is the Holy Ghost is the seal of God.
[1:16:06] When we talk about the mark of the
[1:16:07] beast, what is that beast? Just want to
[1:16:10] give a little bit. What is that beast?
[1:16:12] What the mark of the beast? But what is
[1:16:14] that beast?
[1:16:15] What is that beast that talk about in
[1:16:17] this mark of the beast here? What is
[1:16:19] that beast? The Bible says in Revelation
[1:16:22] 13, can go to Revelation 13 for those
[1:16:25] who have the Bible. Revelation 13:16
[1:16:28] says, "He causth all, both small and
[1:16:32] great, rich and poor, free and bond, to
[1:16:34] receive a mark in their right hand, or
[1:16:38] in the forehead,
[1:16:41] and that no man might buy or sell save
[1:16:44] he that had the mark, or the name of the
[1:16:47] beast, or the number of his name." Here
[1:16:50] is the wisdom. Let him that had
[1:16:52] understanding count the number of the
[1:16:55] beast for it is the number of a man and
[1:16:57] his number is 600 three score and six.
[1:17:01] So that beast is a number which is 600
[1:17:05] 66. This has become a so common number
[1:17:08] that even people are not Christians they
[1:17:10] know oh that's a that's a bad number.
[1:17:14] They believe the Bible without but they
[1:17:17] believe portion of the Bible they don't
[1:17:19] but take the whole Bible. So that's
[1:17:20] where that number comes from 666.
[1:17:26] Because of the pressure, some are going
[1:17:28] to have that mark of the beast. Some
[1:17:31] because of the deception of deception
[1:17:33] because of how the devil has deceived
[1:17:36] the people, they're going to have this
[1:17:38] number without knowing that they have
[1:17:40] this number. But the prophet has given
[1:17:42] us the secret is when you reject the
[1:17:44] Holy Ghost, you are candidate to receive
[1:17:46] this number.
[1:17:52] That beast is Satan human form that will
[1:17:55] lead worshippers and even religious
[1:17:58] people to worship him.
[1:18:00] That's the same beast that the Bible is
[1:18:02] talking about in 2 Thessalonians 2:34
[1:18:06] says, "Let no man deceive you by any
[1:18:08] means, for that day shall not come
[1:18:11] except there come a falling away first,
[1:18:13] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[1:18:15] of pition, who opposeth, and exaltth
[1:18:19] himself above all that is called God,
[1:18:21] and that is worshiped, so that he as God
[1:18:24] siteth in the temple of God, showing
[1:18:27] himself that he is God. So he's a person
[1:18:31] is a person who has influence and he
[1:18:33] want to show himself to be woripped or
[1:18:36] to be respected. He want to have
[1:18:38] authority over God. He wants to have
[1:18:41] authority over God. So he want to have
[1:18:44] authority over God. You want to have
[1:18:46] authority over the word of God
[1:18:57] because God is the word.
[1:19:00] So you want to reject the word of God.
[1:19:02] That's why they call him the antichrist.
[1:19:04] The antichrist is the anti-word.
[1:19:07] He doesn't want to accept the whole
[1:19:08] word. He think he can change the word of
[1:19:10] God. You know people want to change the
[1:19:13] Bible. They have their own version of
[1:19:15] Bible. They want to change the prayer of
[1:19:17] Jesus Christ. They think that the prayer
[1:19:19] of Jesus Christ is not perfect. Who are
[1:19:22] you to be able to change the prayer of
[1:19:25] the Lord Jesus Christ? It means you are
[1:19:27] trying to overtake the authority of the
[1:19:29] word of God. Who are you who don't want
[1:19:32] to allow people that they can they can
[1:19:34] pray to God directly? They have to go
[1:19:37] through you first before they pray to
[1:19:39] God. that the spirit of the old oldtime
[1:19:41] ages where they don't want people to
[1:19:43] have a relationship with God. I pray.
[1:19:46] Amen. And I want everybody to have a
[1:19:50] personal relationship with God.
[1:19:52] Amen.
[1:19:53] That's my desire. Everybody must have a
[1:19:56] personal relationship with God. Butam
[1:19:58] himself said, "I didn't want I didn't
[1:20:00] come here to to to create a church or to
[1:20:03] start a church and movement." No, I want
[1:20:05] here. I'm here because I want each
[1:20:07] individual to have a personal
[1:20:10] relationship with God.
[1:20:14] So sometimes we think that person is a
[1:20:17] evil person and is you know someone who
[1:20:19] has horns and scary person. No, he's a
[1:20:23] nice person, a good person, smiling
[1:20:26] person, but he has an influence because
[1:20:29] the Bible says they shall rise false
[1:20:32] Christ and false prophet and they shall
[1:20:34] show great signs and wonders in so much
[1:20:37] that if it were possible, they shall
[1:20:39] deceive the very elect. So probably he's
[1:20:42] a very good person and a very nice
[1:20:45] person, but he is deceiving because he
[1:20:48] want authority over the word of God.
[1:20:51] Amen.
[1:20:51] Amen.
[1:20:53] You will probably be a person giving
[1:20:54] good suggestions about tolerance, unity
[1:20:57] of faith among Christians, among
[1:20:59] different religions and bring people un
[1:21:02] let's become one unity, one group. We
[1:21:05] can understand one another. There are
[1:21:06] different ways to go to heaven. You can
[1:21:09] believe this way and you can go to
[1:21:10] heaven. You can believe this way, you
[1:21:12] can go to heaven. You know, God God
[1:21:15] doesn't want to reject people. You can
[1:21:17] be you can you you know you can do your
[1:21:19] own way. You can be a a gay, you can,
[1:21:22] you know, just be under one umbrella.
[1:21:24] All of us that against the word of God,
[1:21:27] there is only one way and that way is
[1:21:29] Christ. Amen.
[1:21:32] Look at the time of Jesus of Jesus
[1:21:34] Christ. Judah was probably the cleanest
[1:21:37] of all of the disciples.
[1:21:39] Put Judas and Peter in my mind. I would
[1:21:42] probably see Peter there is dirty. He's
[1:21:44] a fisherman and everything. But Judah is
[1:21:47] the one keeping the money. is the one
[1:21:49] who's the cleanest is the one who's
[1:21:51] looks like oh very that must be an
[1:21:54] intellectual of that group from that
[1:21:55] group of Jesus I see only per Judah
[1:21:58] looks like he's the one who is more
[1:22:00] educated but he's is the one who the
[1:22:04] most deceiving
[1:22:06] so it's the same spirit you remember
[1:22:08] when that woman came and pou the the
[1:22:10] anointing upon on Jesus Christ is the
[1:22:13] one complaining wh why why she's wasting
[1:22:16] that we can give that to We can sell
[1:22:19] that and give that to the poor. He
[1:22:21] sounds like the most compassionate
[1:22:23] person from all the disciples because he
[1:22:26] cares about the poor. No, he didn't want
[1:22:29] really care about the poor. He want to
[1:22:30] steal the money. Amen. So that's that is
[1:22:34] not too far from that beast. Amen.
[1:22:40] Actually, Revelation 13:8-9 says, "All
[1:22:44] that dwell upon the earth shall worship
[1:22:46] him, whose names are not written in the
[1:22:48] book of life of the lambs lain from the
[1:22:51] foundation of the world. If any man have
[1:22:54] an here, let him hear." I will say,
[1:22:57] "Aren't you thankful that your name has
[1:23:00] been written in the lamb's book of life
[1:23:02] before the foundation of the world?" No
[1:23:05] matter what the enemy will try to do, if
[1:23:07] you are if you are a son of God
[1:23:10] predestinated, you are going to have the
[1:23:12] Holy Ghost. Amen. Oh, that's wonderful
[1:23:15] just to have that and to think about
[1:23:17] that God mercy in our life. There is a
[1:23:20] punishment for those having that mark of
[1:23:22] the beast. Revelation 14:9 says, "And
[1:23:25] the third angel followed them, saying
[1:23:27] with a loud voice, if any man worship
[1:23:29] the beast or his image, and receive his
[1:23:32] mark in his forehead and his hand, the
[1:23:35] same shall drink of the vine of the
[1:23:37] wrath of God, which is poured out
[1:23:39] without mixture into the cup of his
[1:23:41] innation. And he shall be tormented with
[1:23:44] fire and brimstone in the presence of
[1:23:46] the holy angels, in the presence of the
[1:23:48] lamp. And the smoke of their of torment
[1:23:51] ascendeth up forever and ever, and they
[1:23:53] have no rest day nor night, who worship
[1:23:56] the beast and his image, and forsoever
[1:23:59] receive the mark of his name. Here is
[1:24:01] the patience of the saints. He are they
[1:24:04] that keep the commandments of God and
[1:24:06] the faith of God. The time is running
[1:24:09] upon me there. I'm trying to rush, but
[1:24:10] so the the beast, but the beast, you
[1:24:13] also think about it. There is also an
[1:24:15] image to the beast.
[1:24:30] The prophet says, "Now a mark," the
[1:24:33] Bible speaks that the mark of the beast
[1:24:35] will be known by the hand or the head.
[1:24:38] I've heard it predicted by many
[1:24:40] different ways that they would tattoo a
[1:24:43] sign in your hand, a sign on your head.
[1:24:47] Now I do not believe that's correct with
[1:24:49] scriptures.
[1:24:50] How many believe think about COVID? How
[1:24:53] people say COVID is the the mark of the
[1:24:55] beast you know. Yeah. I'm not for
[1:24:58] vaccine or against vaccine. You do
[1:24:59] whatever you want to do. I'm not here
[1:25:01] for that. But you know how we Oh no.
[1:25:04] Don't take that. The mark of the beast.
[1:25:06] No no no the scripture. Do you think
[1:25:08] that the script what is a vaccine to do
[1:25:12] with the mark of the beast?
[1:25:15] Prophet gave us the key. If you reject
[1:25:17] the Holy Ghost, candidate for the mark
[1:25:20] of the beast. Amen.
[1:25:22] That's right.
[1:25:24] We go to Africa. How many times do we
[1:25:26] receive vaccines?
[1:25:29] So, I've been mark beast.
[1:25:33] Okay. But Jasper, I'm not against you.
[1:25:39] But let's stay with the scriptures.
[1:25:41] Amen.
[1:25:42] Amen. There's going to be a group of
[1:25:44] people that's going to be marked for te
[1:25:46] for destiny in hell and there's going to
[1:25:48] be people marked for their eternal
[1:25:50] destiny in heaven. And those two marks
[1:25:53] run side by side. It's going to get so
[1:25:56] great and so pinching that just before
[1:25:59] the coming of the Lord that you'll have
[1:26:01] to have one mark and the other or there
[1:26:04] will be a boycott and you can't buy or
[1:26:06] nor sell. But I believe also during
[1:26:09] COVID we saw some of the restrictions
[1:26:11] showing how they can easily turn on some
[1:26:14] of those of of of those of of those
[1:26:18] requirement. Amen.
[1:26:19] When when when the beast will be so such
[1:26:22] in power they can easily turn that those
[1:26:24] requirement that become so harsh. You
[1:26:27] can't buy you can't do anything you
[1:26:28] can't do because they it made them train
[1:26:32] for that those situations. Amen. showing
[1:26:35] that like a rehearsal once the real time
[1:26:38] happens they can do it like like that
[1:26:40] because we saw that through COVID. Amen.
[1:26:47] Says you can't buy nor sell. Notice how
[1:26:49] does this begin that these two great
[1:26:52] things have been working in the churches
[1:26:54] for years. Judas was the antichrist. We
[1:26:57] know that he was the one. He was not
[1:26:59] seemingly against Christ. Seemingly he
[1:27:01] was for Christ. Seemingly he was for
[1:27:04] Christ. He looked like he was for
[1:27:05] Christ. But the Bible says in the last
[1:27:07] days them two spirit will be so close to
[1:27:10] each other that you will deceive the
[1:27:12] very elect if possible. So don't think
[1:27:16] that is someone evil look from the
[1:27:18] outside but no so close. So close
[1:27:21] because so close with the beast and the
[1:27:23] image of the beast they will be so
[1:27:25] close. In the churches they look like
[1:27:26] this but one has the Holy Ghost the
[1:27:29] other doesn't have the Holy Ghost. This
[1:27:31] is the key. We should be desiring for
[1:27:34] more Holy Ghost.
[1:27:36] But fill us with more the Holy Ghost
[1:27:38] because without the Holy Ghost, you are
[1:27:40] candidate to be deceived.
[1:27:43] You can't have the right eyes. You can't
[1:27:45] see properly. You can't understand
[1:27:46] properly. But God will give me the Holy
[1:27:49] Ghost.
[1:27:51] I don't know how I can overemphasize
[1:27:53] that but become a reality. Amen.
[1:27:55] So to identify the beast, check his
[1:27:58] number. And we know one of the places in
[1:28:01] the great church where one of the places
[1:28:03] where this numbers is written. And for
[1:28:07] the young people, I don't know if I can
[1:28:08] remember how to write it, but I know how
[1:28:10] to to say it.
[1:28:23] I guess I'm close.
[1:28:26] Vikaris
[1:28:27] filid
[1:28:32] vigaris filiday which means instead of
[1:28:36] the son of god this is the inscription
[1:28:38] that's written in Rome on the throne
[1:28:41] where the pope is sitting
[1:28:44] vicarious filid and if you count it
[1:28:48] first so you know to count it
[1:28:51] what is this
[1:28:53] in Romans
[1:28:54] Number
[1:28:56] D
[1:28:59] 500.
[1:29:05] What is this?
[1:29:09] What is this?
[1:29:12] L.
[1:29:16] What is this?
[1:29:18] No, this one. It doesn't exist.
[1:29:22] as this one five.
[1:29:27] So if you put this 600
[1:29:31] let's put this 60 right 660 so far. Are
[1:29:36] you with me? Now let's count the one.
[1:29:40] So we have one
[1:29:42] one one one
[1:29:47] right 1 2 3 4 5 6 6
[1:29:54] am I correct
[1:29:57] so we have 600
[1:30:01] this is 10 + 50 60 and count the one we
[1:30:06] have six ones 600
[1:30:09] 66.
[1:30:14] So we just don't want to take any
[1:30:15] number. So what's the why why why we say
[1:30:19] Rome? Why why we take why why why we
[1:30:21] focus on saying the beast is in Rome.
[1:30:24] It's not is not is not is not is not
[1:30:27] some conspiracy theory. It's not you
[1:30:29] know people can come with conspirac
[1:30:30] theory. They can take a name. You can
[1:30:32] someone can have a name and you
[1:30:33] calculate his name it turns out
[1:30:34] something. But why would we focus only
[1:30:37] on this name? Why? Why in Rome? Why we
[1:30:39] we focus on that place? Because Rome has
[1:30:42] already a place in the scriptures. If
[1:30:44] you look in in Revelation 10, if you
[1:30:47] look in the re re in re sorry revelation
[1:30:49] there, if you look in revelation 13,
[1:30:51] revelation revelation 14, revelation 17,
[1:30:54] revelation 18 that talking about the
[1:30:57] image, the beast and the image, the take
[1:31:00] the location all that give the
[1:31:02] descriptions of that beast where
[1:31:04] standing. Amen. So that beast is
[1:31:06] standing in Rome. It might be quiet. It
[1:31:09] might be like he's not doing anything,
[1:31:10] but he's working underneath. Everything
[1:31:13] is under control. Everything is working
[1:31:15] under control there for him. He knows
[1:31:18] what he's doing. But the bride should
[1:31:20] also be making herself ready.
[1:31:22] Amen.
[1:31:22] As they're making themselves ready on
[1:31:24] this side, the bride should be making
[1:31:26] himself ready on this side, too. Amen.
[1:31:29] That's not time to be playing church.
[1:31:31] It's time to get ready for the rapture.
[1:31:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:31:37] That's why I think the fulfillment of
[1:31:39] the prophecy of the pope that the
[1:31:42] prophet gave an American pope is very
[1:31:44] important.
[1:31:46] Amen.
[1:31:47] It's not a sign for us, but is something
[1:31:50] to wake someone who's still sleeping.
[1:31:53] If someone is still sleeping, I think
[1:31:55] the time to say to you, no, wake up.
[1:31:57] It's not time to play church. It's not
[1:31:59] time to put it on the side. No time to
[1:32:01] to to to postpone things.
[1:32:04] Lord, help me to be more serious. Help
[1:32:06] me to be more sincere. Help me to to
[1:32:09] trim my lambs, Lord.
[1:32:12] Amen.
[1:32:12] Prophet gave this prophecy
[1:32:15] 79 years ago if I'm not mistaken.
[1:32:21] 71 years ago says I believe one of these
[1:32:25] glorious days when this united
[1:32:27] confederation of church goes together
[1:32:29] and the new pope is brought out of the
[1:32:31] United States and put over there
[1:32:34] according to prophecy that they will
[1:32:37] form an image like unto the beast. So
[1:32:40] they talk about the image now he's
[1:32:42] identified what is in how this image of
[1:32:44] the beast is going to be formed. says
[1:32:46] when you see that pope and the
[1:32:48] confederation of the church coming
[1:32:51] together.
[1:32:54] Are you with me?
[1:32:56] So do you notice the United States you
[1:32:58] know it says when this united
[1:33:00] confederation of church goes together
[1:33:02] and the new pope is brought out of the
[1:33:04] United States and put over there
[1:33:06] according to the prophecy then they'll
[1:33:08] form an image like unto the beast and I
[1:33:11] tell you the true church of God will be
[1:33:14] drove together. the real true believers
[1:33:18] out of Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[1:33:20] Pentecostal, Nazarene, Pilgrim,
[1:33:23] Holiness, whatever they'll be will
[1:33:26] cemented by the love of God that will
[1:33:30] make the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:33] all the believers. He say then the
[1:33:36] prophet continu says agnostics and
[1:33:38] people the some people want to be
[1:33:40] neutral. I don't believe in God and I
[1:33:43] don't I don't also deny God. I'm just
[1:33:45] neutral agnostic. Okay, whatever comes
[1:33:49] it's okay. I'm just being a good
[1:33:50] citizens. I'm just being a good person.
[1:33:52] I'm just going to be a good workers. And
[1:33:55] it says agnostic and minded
[1:33:58] shallowminded will be cast to one side.
[1:34:01] They will go right on into the
[1:34:03] confederation of churches. You'll find
[1:34:07] so many people here that very good
[1:34:09] people.
[1:34:14] They don't steal. They don't do
[1:34:15] anything. They don't just good people,
[1:34:18] good citizen. They pay the t the the
[1:34:21] taxes.
[1:34:23] They pay the taxes.
[1:34:25] But they are being deceived. Yeah.
[1:34:28] Amen.
[1:34:29] I'll put even here if you allow me some
[1:34:32] unbelievers.
[1:34:35] Do you know that some unbelievers are
[1:34:37] very good people? Amen.
[1:34:40] You talk with them so nice people
[1:34:43] but they just being blinded. Amen.
[1:34:46] And we have some make believer
[1:34:56] those somehow they come to church from
[1:34:58] time to times when when they feel like
[1:35:00] coming or they or they they they pray
[1:35:03] from time to time when they feel like
[1:35:06] they they read the Bible from time to
[1:35:08] time when they feel like it. went to
[1:35:10] Christmas then they they put their best
[1:35:12] dressed and they go to church when it's
[1:35:14] time of Easter they then then they read
[1:35:17] their Bible and then oh but under that
[1:35:21] image of the beast
[1:35:26] and when the pressure comes they won't
[1:35:29] have anything
[1:35:31] to stand against the pressure
[1:35:34] because they value more the work they
[1:35:36] value more the money they they don't
[1:35:38] have anything to stand when the pressure
[1:35:40] comes.
[1:35:41] But what will give you strength to stand
[1:35:43] against the pressure is the power of the
[1:35:46] Holy Ghost.
[1:35:47] But when the pressure comes, when the
[1:35:49] pressure comes, the power of the Holy
[1:35:51] Ghost, you have believed the word of
[1:35:53] God. You have believed the third pull.
[1:35:56] That power of the Holy Ghost will be
[1:35:57] manifested in the time of pressure
[1:36:00] because you were already sealed. Amen.
[1:36:02] Before the pressure comes.
[1:36:04] Amen.
[1:36:04] It's not when the pressure comes, then
[1:36:06] you start looking for it. It might be
[1:36:07] too late. It's now that you need to be
[1:36:10] your lamb to be trimmed.
[1:36:11] Amen.
[1:36:20] So the prophet says, "Do you notice it
[1:36:22] comes from America, right? Do you notice
[1:36:24] the United States is number 13 in
[1:36:26] everything it does? You know it it was
[1:36:28] established the 13 colonies. You know
[1:36:30] the flag had 13 stars in it in its
[1:36:32] first. You know everything that the
[1:36:34] United States does is a number 13. Did
[1:36:37] you know it appears in the Bible in
[1:36:38] Revelation 13? Certainly does. The
[1:36:41] little beast, the lamb that comes out
[1:36:43] out of the water, not thickness and
[1:36:45] multitude of people says no, not out of
[1:36:47] the water, but out of the land where
[1:36:49] there is no one. They had two little
[1:36:52] horn, civil and ecclesiastic powers. He
[1:36:56] was a lamp like the American buffalo,
[1:36:59] right? Having two horns is is is soft is
[1:37:03] freedom of religions. The study of
[1:37:05] freedom of religions. But do you know
[1:37:06] that today the Catholic has so much
[1:37:09] influence in America than ever have
[1:37:12] before
[1:37:13] in the congress in the white house the
[1:37:16] vice pre the vice president
[1:37:19] oh the catholic before the election they
[1:37:22] have to have a meeting with the with
[1:37:24] with the Catholic having influences
[1:37:26] never before
[1:37:28] watch out
[1:37:32] then he says after a while they went
[1:37:35] together and spoke like the dragons
[1:37:36] exercising all the power that Rome did
[1:37:39] before that's coming to our nation. You
[1:37:41] mark it down. You watch the
[1:37:43] confederation of churches and the
[1:37:45] Catholic unite together and watch what
[1:37:48] takes place. People who follow the
[1:37:50] pillar of fire will certainly have a
[1:37:53] rough time, a rough time. But they are
[1:37:57] ready for the translation at that time.
[1:38:00] Just ready to go for the lamb overcame
[1:38:04] them. say the Bible and them that follow
[1:38:06] him because they were called the chosen
[1:38:09] and the faithful the elected of God keep
[1:38:11] from getting into those prophecy now so
[1:38:14] we can run into this one. So when the
[1:38:16] the pressure will come those who have
[1:38:18] the Holy Ghost will go into the rapture.
[1:38:21] Amen.
[1:38:27] Going to skip few things here in order
[1:38:28] to save time.
[1:38:30] So the Catholic Church
[1:38:33] described in Revelation 17, it says,
[1:38:36] "There came one of the seven angels that
[1:38:38] had the seven vials and talked with me,
[1:38:40] saying unto me, come he will show unto
[1:38:42] thee the judgment of the great who
[1:38:45] see them upon many waters with whom the
[1:38:48] kings of the earth have committed
[1:38:50] adultery." Who's that system who the
[1:38:54] king has to go and bow to?
[1:38:56] Do you see kings go and bowing to any
[1:39:00] any any religious person in the world
[1:39:04] orthodox or Muslims or Hindi or whatever
[1:39:07] religion but when they go to Rome and
[1:39:09] bow themselves there and have to have a
[1:39:12] special picture with the pope and makes
[1:39:14] them special.
[1:39:17] Amen.
[1:39:20] So whom the king of the earth have
[1:39:21] committed fornication. inhabitants of
[1:39:23] the earth have made drunk with the vine
[1:39:25] of her fornication. So he carried me
[1:39:28] away in the spirit into the wilderness.
[1:39:29] And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet
[1:39:32] colored beast full of names of blasphemy
[1:39:36] having seven heads and and 10 horns. And
[1:39:40] a woman was arrayed in purple and
[1:39:42] scarlet color that Rome. Amen. And
[1:39:46] decked with gold and precious stones and
[1:39:49] pearls. Oh, we go to Vatican. Our
[1:39:52] honeymoon we went to Rome. But I was
[1:39:54] impressed and how how pre how beautiful
[1:39:57] it is. I Oh, the prophet was right. All
[1:40:00] the money, the all the gold that my
[1:40:05] So that woman was red in purple and scar
[1:40:07] and decked with gold and precious stones
[1:40:09] and pearls, having a golden cup and a
[1:40:11] hand full of abomination and filthiness
[1:40:14] over fornication. Upon her forehead was
[1:40:17] a name written mystery Babylon the great
[1:40:20] the mother of harlot and abomination of
[1:40:23] the earth. She's a mother of
[1:40:25] denominations the mother of harlot
[1:40:28] people who are refusing the authority of
[1:40:30] the word of God. Amen. The high breeding
[1:40:32] the the word of God committing
[1:40:34] fornication with the world. Amen. Upon
[1:40:37] her forehead was the written mystery
[1:40:39] Babylon of the great the mother of harot
[1:40:41] and abomination of the earth. And I saw
[1:40:43] the woman drunken with the blood of the
[1:40:45] saints and with the blood of the martyrs
[1:40:47] of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered
[1:40:50] with great admiration.
[1:40:52] John before the revelation, before who
[1:40:55] the description that woman was, himself
[1:40:58] marveled how great she was. Oh, what a
[1:41:01] great church. Oh, what great work she
[1:41:03] has been doing. What great school she
[1:41:05] has done. What great hospital she has
[1:41:08] built. Oh, what a wonderful church. What
[1:41:10] a wonderful system. Oh, then God had to
[1:41:13] reveal to him that woman you see there.
[1:41:16] Oh, he's the one that would put all the
[1:41:19] kingdoms upon fornication.
[1:41:23] Which religious system controls nations
[1:41:26] and tongues, seduces kings, and is a red
[1:41:28] in purple and scarlet, is decked with
[1:41:31] silver and gold, and is drunk with the
[1:41:33] blood of the matter of Jesus,
[1:41:35] sits upon seven mountains. That city is
[1:41:38] called eternal city of seven hills. It's
[1:41:41] only Vatican Rome that shows that that
[1:41:44] that's why we point to see what the
[1:41:47] number is. If you see all the
[1:41:48] descriptions coinciding together, we
[1:41:50] have identified who that woman is. The
[1:41:54] Bible gives us a hint as well in Matthew
[1:41:57] 13 says the servant of the householder
[1:42:00] came and said unto him, sir, this not
[1:42:02] that saw
[1:42:04] did not that sow good seed in the field
[1:42:06] from Wednesday there come these tears?
[1:42:08] And he said unto them, "And enemy has
[1:42:10] done this." The servant said unto him,
[1:42:12] "Will thou then that we go and gather
[1:42:15] them up?" But he said, "No, lest while
[1:42:17] you gather up the tears, you root up
[1:42:19] also the wheat with them. Let both grow
[1:42:23] together until the harvest in the time
[1:42:26] of harvest. I will say to the reapers,
[1:42:29] gather ye together first the tears." So
[1:42:31] what the Catholic has been dying, that
[1:42:33] spirit started from Ephesians church
[1:42:36] all the way to Laia. In the same statue
[1:42:39] of the perfect man prophet put that say
[1:42:41] we went to the churches we saw what he
[1:42:43] did through the churches and that spirit
[1:42:45] has been working in the churches but you
[1:42:47] can be also a one-man organization one
[1:42:50] person organization if you're not
[1:42:52] careful that spirit will be working upon
[1:42:54] you as well it's the same spirit that
[1:42:56] tried to put people down they don't want
[1:42:58] to believe believers to come to
[1:43:00] realization of who they are they want to
[1:43:03] keep them lukewarm that's been manifest
[1:43:05] in the year where they want a Christian
[1:43:07] to become come lukewarm to not to know
[1:43:09] his position as a Christians but you
[1:43:11] have to have an experience of the
[1:43:13] batting of the Holy Ghost with fire in
[1:43:15] your life. Amen. So you are zealous for
[1:43:18] the things of God.
[1:43:19] Amen.
[1:43:20] Amen.
[1:43:21] Amen.
[1:43:21] And he says what you have to do them you
[1:43:24] have to bind the tears together first.
[1:43:28] That's what the churches have been doing
[1:43:29] all together. Let unite. Let unite. Let
[1:43:31] unite. Let be one. But you can't be one
[1:43:34] outside of the word of God. You have
[1:43:36] rejected the authority of the word of
[1:43:38] God. Now you are making compromise or
[1:43:40] you believe that you believe it's okay.
[1:43:41] We can just stay together. It's fine. I
[1:43:43] will accept you. I respect your opinion
[1:43:45] and everything. But it's okay. No, you
[1:43:47] have to be under the authority of the
[1:43:49] word of God.
[1:43:50] That's why they're gathering together.
[1:43:52] But at the same time as they're
[1:43:54] gathering together, it says bind them
[1:43:55] first by the bind to be burned. But
[1:43:59] gather the wheat into the barn. There is
[1:44:02] also another gathering happening here.
[1:44:04] Amen. For those
[1:44:07] we are here because we are being
[1:44:09] gathered here because one voice called
[1:44:11] us. Amen.
[1:44:12] Not a man called you. God called you. Is
[1:44:15] the voice of the bridegroom gathering
[1:44:17] the bride. We are under a voice that is
[1:44:20] gathering us. Amen. But it's not
[1:44:22] gathering us for the mark of the beast.
[1:44:23] Is gathering us be for the mark of the
[1:44:26] Holy Ghost. Amen. Thank God for the
[1:44:28] message of the hour. Thank God for the
[1:44:30] trumpet. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:32] Thank God for the voice that is
[1:44:33] shouting. The shout of the king. Amen.
[1:44:35] Is in the camp as we heard in in in
[1:44:38] Matthew 25. There was a cry a mid one
[1:44:41] midnight cried. Behold the bridegroom
[1:44:44] cometh. Amen. Go out to meet him. That
[1:44:47] same shout is shouting today this
[1:44:49] morning. Wake up. Amen.
[1:44:51] Amen.
[1:44:53] Amen.
[1:44:54] Amen.
[1:45:04] The prophet says revelation chapter 4.
[1:45:08] This is outside of the context of the
[1:45:10] politics we are in in now. But just see
[1:45:13] what the prophet says. That's awful that
[1:45:15] the American Canada, you precious people
[1:45:18] from Canada, if Canada keeps going, if
[1:45:21] America keeps going on, Canada will be
[1:45:23] as low down as America after a while.
[1:45:26] Get around the borders of Canada
[1:45:28] anywhere and you got that American
[1:45:31] atmosphere. This America is the
[1:45:33] prostitute of the nations.
[1:45:36] Any American
[1:45:38] it's not against American. It's not any
[1:45:41] political things. Um that's exactly what
[1:45:44] she is. She's going to be worse than
[1:45:46] ever now. She's coming to her hand. The
[1:45:48] Bible speaks of a doom. Tells how she's
[1:45:50] going to be. America low down rotten
[1:45:53] filthy no good. is not talking about
[1:45:55] Christians, not talking about message
[1:45:57] believers. Talking about the spirit of
[1:45:59] the nations because it started with a
[1:46:02] good foundation, but now they rejected
[1:46:04] the word of God. That exactly right.
[1:46:06] She's been a great nation. She's carried
[1:46:08] the gospel message. What makes her the
[1:46:11] way she is because she has turned down
[1:46:13] the gospel message. She has rejected the
[1:46:16] truth. She's horrible. She's come She's
[1:46:18] got to She's got it coming. Don't worry.
[1:46:21] I seen it in a vision as thus say the
[1:46:24] Lord and that's not only Americans the
[1:46:26] Canadians or all the nations of the
[1:46:27] world African all as long as you reject
[1:46:30] the word of God you have rejected the
[1:46:33] way of escaping
[1:46:35] and but come back to the word of God
[1:46:38] but from these things you can realize I
[1:46:40] put another group here another just a
[1:46:43] parenthesis I put here because there is
[1:46:46] there is three there is three kind there
[1:46:48] are two marks that my titles there are
[1:46:50] two marks
[1:46:52] But there are three kinds of people,
[1:46:55] three classes of people.
[1:46:57] Yes.
[1:47:00] The prophet says secondly, there is
[1:47:03] another class that names exposition of
[1:47:05] the seven churches. Their names are also
[1:47:08] in the book of life and they will come
[1:47:10] up in the second resurrection. Sure are
[1:47:14] the foolish virgin and the righteous are
[1:47:17] as as are spoken of in Matthew 25. In
[1:47:20] this class also are those who do not
[1:47:24] worship the beast or become involved in
[1:47:28] the antichrist system but they die for
[1:47:32] their faith.
[1:47:35] So there are some foolish virgin
[1:47:45] and these ones are the wise virgins.
[1:47:54] Some people here
[1:47:56] they won't worship the beast
[1:48:00] but they don't have the Holy Ghost.
[1:48:03] They will die for their faith.
[1:48:13] By election there's something inside of
[1:48:15] them they'll say no that sound that
[1:48:17] doesn't sound right. what they are doing
[1:48:20] here doesn't sound right. I will stick
[1:48:22] with what I believe.
[1:48:24] Maybe they were not in contact with the
[1:48:26] message of the hour. They didn't
[1:48:28] rejected it. Just know it doesn't sound
[1:48:31] right.
[1:48:33] I cannot go this way. Some people are
[1:48:36] clean. They're virgins sanctified but
[1:48:39] they don't have the Holy Ghost. They're
[1:48:41] not having the full revelation
[1:48:45] that we have.
[1:48:46] And don't think that some
[1:48:50] Don't think that this is going to be
[1:48:51] easy.
[1:48:52] No,
[1:48:53] they're going to go to the great
[1:48:54] tribulation.
[1:48:55] The great tribulation takes all of them.
[1:48:58] Here
[1:49:04] should be in red.
[1:49:10] Does it make a little bit clear?
[1:49:23] The bride will not go into the great
[1:49:25] tribulation.
[1:49:26] She won't be punished. She will be in
[1:49:28] the kingdom.
[1:49:29] She'll be in the palace.
[1:49:31] She won't go through all the persecution
[1:49:33] the others will go. But these two will
[1:49:36] go through that great tribulation. And
[1:49:38] this one has to fight against
[1:49:41] the system. That's why they will be
[1:49:44] rewarded for eternal life as well. Being
[1:49:46] saved, but they will be our the servant
[1:49:49] to the bride. They will be serving the
[1:49:51] bride. But to give the life through that
[1:49:54] great tribulation is not an easy thing.
[1:49:58] The Holocaust will be something small
[1:50:01] compared to what they will go through.
[1:50:03] Very hard, very great punishment and
[1:50:06] persecution. I don't want anyone to go
[1:50:09] through this. Amen.
[1:50:11] Unfortunately, some people who have been
[1:50:13] virgin,
[1:50:14] they heard the message and but they were
[1:50:16] just slumber. They just neglecting and
[1:50:19] when they will see some of the people
[1:50:21] going,
[1:50:25] we don't want people, you know, why the
[1:50:27] why why the deacon is not here? Why the
[1:50:30] church? What's going on here?
[1:50:33] What what happened here? They changed
[1:50:35] the service. They cancelled the service.
[1:50:38] Oh, we are gone.
[1:50:41] They will be wondering what's going on
[1:50:42] here. I came one time to the service and
[1:50:45] heard once someone talking about this
[1:50:47] that these things will happen. Oh Lord,
[1:50:49] those people were right. Oh, I won't
[1:50:52] accept this one. Oh God, they will
[1:50:55] repent on that. They try to repent that
[1:50:57] everything. I know I will stay here.
[1:50:59] God, I might have mercy and spare them
[1:51:01] life.
[1:51:02] Amen.
[1:51:03] Some people don't know anything about
[1:51:05] the message of the hour, but they're
[1:51:06] just nice to you. They will be rewarded
[1:51:09] for that. And they won't be under this.
[1:51:12] Amen.
[1:51:21] But there is also a group and that way
[1:51:24] actually we should have emphasized more.
[1:51:26] First of all, we know that there is a
[1:51:28] group that have the Holy Ghost. It
[1:51:29] prophesies. We know most assured that
[1:51:32] the purpose of God stands in election.
[1:51:34] It was purpose in himself. It was God's
[1:51:37] purpose to bring forth a people like
[1:51:39] unto himself that will be a word bride.
[1:51:42] She was chosen before the foundation of
[1:51:44] the world in him. She was for non
[1:51:47] beloved before she was ever brought
[1:51:49] forth during the ages upon the earth.
[1:51:52] She was redeemed by his blood and can
[1:51:54] never come into condemnation. She can
[1:51:57] never be in the judgment because sin
[1:51:59] cannot be imputed unto her.
[1:52:02] Aren't you thankful that you are part of
[1:52:04] the bride? says Romans 4:8, "Blessed is
[1:52:07] the man to whom the Lord will not impute
[1:52:09] sin, but indeed she shall be with him in
[1:52:12] his throne of judgment, judging the
[1:52:15] world and even angels." Her name and
[1:52:18] each one of her member was written in a
[1:52:20] section of the lamb's book of life
[1:52:22] before the foundation of the world.
[1:52:26] Amen. As I'm closing in my message this
[1:52:28] morning, the prophet says that Holy
[1:52:30] Ghost ought to be the more important to
[1:52:34] you than everything else there is in the
[1:52:37] world.
[1:52:37] Amen.
[1:52:38] The Holy Ghost has to be more important
[1:52:40] to any one of us this morning than
[1:52:43] anything we can have in this world. The
[1:52:46] prophet says your prestige, your life,
[1:52:48] your job, your anything that there is,
[1:52:51] you should not cease until you have it.
[1:52:54] Until you have the Holy Ghost, you must
[1:52:57] receive it, says the prophet. It must be
[1:52:59] the most and didn't finish the sentence.
[1:53:01] But I I believe he wanted to repeat
[1:53:03] that. It must be the most important
[1:53:04] thing to you. And you say, well, I'm
[1:53:06] afraid they they at my work, they I'm
[1:53:09] afraid that my husband, don't be afraid.
[1:53:12] Let that be the first place. Amen. Let
[1:53:15] everything else go. Let that be first.
[1:53:19] Well, I expect to get it one of these
[1:53:20] days, brother Bam. Not one of these
[1:53:23] days. Now
[1:53:24] this is the time. Amen. Let it be first
[1:53:27] before I do anything else. Let me have
[1:53:30] it now.
[1:53:32] Let me become desperate. The prophet
[1:53:34] says desperate. That would help answer
[1:53:37] our question. When you get desperate for
[1:53:40] it, really got to have it or die, then
[1:53:43] it is when you are going to get it. Most
[1:53:46] of us, many people don't don't get
[1:53:48] desperate enough. They think it as a
[1:53:50] second option. No, it is the most
[1:53:53] important thing than anything else.
[1:53:56] Most important thing than our job, than
[1:53:58] our school, than our marriage, than
[1:54:00] anything else is the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:54:03] Why is it important? Because it is the
[1:54:05] inside teacher.
[1:54:07] Without it, we cannot see the kingdom of
[1:54:09] God. He's the comforter. He's the guide.
[1:54:12] He's the personal revelation to you.
[1:54:14] Amen. He's the seal showing eternal
[1:54:17] security. He's the ownership. He's the
[1:54:19] completion. He's the sign. is the
[1:54:21] covenant is the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:54:24] in you. The Holy Ghost is everything.
[1:54:26] Amen. He is the only promise for the
[1:54:28] rapture. He's the only promise for the
[1:54:30] resurrection. He's the advocate is
[1:54:32] eternal life. Holy Ghost is everything.
[1:54:34] Amen.
[1:54:35] Amen.
[1:54:36] That's what I believe. And for those who
[1:54:39] are the holy who have the Holy Ghost,
[1:54:41] let me tell you the when you have the
[1:54:43] Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost will fight
[1:54:45] for you when the pressure comes. Like in
[1:54:48] the book of acts when the holy ghost
[1:54:51] when the pressure came upon the
[1:54:52] disciples when they wanted to kill Peter
[1:54:55] the angel of the lord came and stood for
[1:54:57] him. Amen. The same thing when the
[1:54:59] pressure will come that we will we will
[1:55:01] feel a little bit of the pressure at the
[1:55:02] beginning before it becomes so intense.
[1:55:04] We will feel it a little bit at the
[1:55:05] beginning. Let me read what the prophet
[1:55:07] says. Says right at this time now it
[1:55:09] cannot he says right at this time now it
[1:55:12] just happened so it could identify it
[1:55:14] presence among you. He's talking about
[1:55:15] the third pool, but it will not be used
[1:55:17] in a great way until the council begin
[1:55:20] to tighten up. When it does, the
[1:55:23] Pentecostal and so forth can almost
[1:55:25] impersonate anything can be done. But
[1:55:28] when that time comes, when the squeeze
[1:55:30] comes down, then you'll see what you
[1:55:32] have seen temporally be manifested in
[1:55:34] the fullness of power. Amen. When you
[1:55:37] see the squeeze starts in there, then
[1:55:38] you will see the fullness of power of
[1:55:40] the third pool. Amen. That's why we talk
[1:55:42] about the third pool. That story is not
[1:55:44] a story is a reality. Amen. As you
[1:55:47] continue to say this is nothing else but
[1:55:49] the truth. You have the same faith as
[1:55:52] haty right. You have the same we have
[1:55:54] the same caliber as haty right. You have
[1:55:57] the same faith as I had to write. Amen.
[1:55:59] God will stand for you. Amen.
[1:56:02] I believe that with all my heart as he
[1:56:05] stood for for the disciple. As he stood
[1:56:07] for Peter as he stood for the three ch
[1:56:09] the three Hebrew children as he stood
[1:56:12] for Daniel. He will stand for you as
[1:56:14] well.
[1:56:14] Amen.
[1:56:15] And the same power, the same Christ, the
[1:56:17] prophet says, let the fundamentalist,
[1:56:19] let them people who deny the power of
[1:56:21] God say it's wrong. But the same power
[1:56:24] that spoke the world into existence is
[1:56:27] in those people that got the Holy Ghost.
[1:56:30] It's right. Men and woman, it's time
[1:56:33] that we find out who you are. I'm
[1:56:35] talking of those who are born again.
[1:56:36] It's important that you find out who you
[1:56:38] are. The devil is trying to hide you
[1:56:41] back, tell you that you are some little
[1:56:43] cow down something. You are not.
[1:56:46] You are sons and daughters of God. The
[1:56:50] deity is not in heaven. The deity is in
[1:56:52] you. Amen. Once you have the Holy Ghost,
[1:56:55] the deity is in you. God is standing for
[1:56:57] you. Amen. He's fighting your battle.
[1:57:00] Amen. Says, hallelujah. I know you think
[1:57:02] I'm crazy. Maybe people think I'm crazy,
[1:57:05] too. But let me tell you something,
[1:57:06] brother. When you realize that the
[1:57:08] almighty god lives in you, immortal life
[1:57:11] is in you. My life I give you zoe life.
[1:57:15] The life of God is in the human being.
[1:57:18] The life of God is in you. Amen.
[1:57:21] That's why the Holy Ghost is the most
[1:57:23] important thing more important than
[1:57:25] anything else. Is the earnest of our
[1:57:27] resurrection is the earnest of our
[1:57:29] rapture. Amen. Brother Bam says,
[1:57:31] "Brothers and sisters, I want you to ask
[1:57:33] you something. If we are born again of
[1:57:35] the Holy Spirit, God doesn't have little
[1:57:38] weak part and big strong part. Our
[1:57:42] feelings have some strong part and but
[1:57:45] when God fill you with the Holy Spirit,
[1:57:47] there is no weak part and strong part.
[1:57:50] God is strong part all the time. Says
[1:57:53] all together God if you had enough of
[1:57:56] God in you till it was just barely a
[1:57:58] shadow. Think about it. Just a shadow of
[1:58:01] God inside of you. But I'm saying it
[1:58:04] might be a little seed inside of you,
[1:58:06] but let it grow. Amen. Even if it's just
[1:58:09] a shadow, there's enough power to make a
[1:58:12] new earth inside of you.
[1:58:15] That's enough power to make a new moon,
[1:58:17] a new system. It's God. It's strong.
[1:58:20] Amen. And right now, every believer in
[1:58:23] here has life eternal, which is God's
[1:58:26] spirit in you. Enough power that will
[1:58:29] raise up the dead. How many believe that
[1:58:31] you'll have a resurrection? We part of
[1:58:33] the first resurrection says that enough
[1:58:36] power that will raise up the dead, that
[1:58:38] will heal the sick, that will set
[1:58:40] orbiting conditions, but you it's
[1:58:42] controlled by a law and that spirit that
[1:58:45] in you. Amen. But it doesn't it doesn't
[1:58:48] it doesn't belittle you. Amen. Because
[1:58:50] it's controlled by spirit. Says you are
[1:58:52] sons and daughters of God. The same
[1:58:54] spirit that you've got in you will raise
[1:58:57] yourself up at the day of the
[1:59:00] resurrection.
[1:59:01] Let's give a hand to the Lord this
[1:59:03] morning.
[1:59:05] Amen.
[1:59:10] Thank God for the Holy Ghost.
[1:59:12] Musicians can come.
[1:59:16] That's the call this morning. Ephesians
[1:59:18] 5:13
[1:59:20] 16 says, "But all things that are
[1:59:22] reproved are made manifest by the light.
[1:59:25] For whosoever that make manifest is
[1:59:27] light, wherefore he say, awake thou that
[1:59:30] sleepeth, and arise from the dead, and
[1:59:33] Christ shall give thee light."
[1:59:35] See that when you walk circum
[1:59:38] circumspectly,
[1:59:39] not as fool, but as wise, redeeming the
[1:59:42] time, because the days are evil.
[1:59:46] Amen. You are not a foolish virgin. You
[1:59:48] are a wise virgin.
[1:59:50] Amen.
[1:59:50] You walk like wise. Amen.
[1:59:53] Redeeming the time.
[1:59:55] Amen.
[2:00:14] There are two ways.
[2:00:19] [Music]
[2:00:21] Set your wings.
[2:00:23] [Music]
[2:00:30] Oh, there are two roads
[2:00:34] you may take.
[2:00:39] One by side,
[2:00:43] oh, one by faith.
[2:00:47] Take the word of God
[2:00:52] over what you see.
[2:00:56] What you believe
[2:01:00] is what will be
[2:01:05] set your way. Let's stand together.
[2:01:08] holds you the wings of faith.
[2:01:14] You can fly.
[2:01:17] You can fly in a higher place.
[2:01:23] Do not struggle.
[2:01:27] It's by praise
[2:01:32] your wings
[2:01:35] to the wind of faith.
[2:01:38] What's your need? Oh, what's your need?
[2:01:44] Oh, why your cry?
[2:01:48] Oh, what's your mountain?
[2:01:52] Is it too much to high? Speak the word
[2:01:56] of God. Oh, speak the word of God.
[2:02:01] And by and by
[2:02:10] all you will fly.
[2:02:13] Set your wings. Set your wings
[2:02:18] through the wings of faith.
[2:02:23] You can fly.
[2:02:25] You can fly in a higher place.
[2:02:31] Do not struggle.
[2:02:35] It lives by grace.
[2:02:39] Send your wind
[2:02:42] to the winds of faith.
[2:02:47] Watch evil
[2:02:51] in the sky.
[2:02:55] He does not struggle.
[2:02:59] He does not
[2:03:03] for the power
[2:03:07] that makes him rise
[2:03:11] is already
[2:03:15] in the sky.
[2:03:18] Set your wings are set your way
[2:03:23] through the winds of faith.
[2:03:25] [Music]
[2:03:27] Oh, you can fly.
[2:03:30] You can fly in a higher place.
[2:03:36] You not struggle.
[2:03:38] [Music]
[2:03:40] It's by grace.
[2:03:44] Send your wings
[2:03:47] to the winds of faith.
[2:03:52] that the purpose of this message
[2:03:55] I believe we are all eagles
[2:03:58] should be on this stage
[2:04:00] but sometimes in our mind
[2:04:02] or in our way we think or way we we we
[2:04:05] live we live like we are part of here
[2:04:08] still struggling with different things
[2:04:11] sometimes stop here just a little bit of
[2:04:15] sanctified life and stop here but God is
[2:04:20] telling you are an eagle you can go all
[2:04:22] the way here.
[2:04:23] Set your wings.
[2:04:24] Amen.
[2:04:24] Cuz I've given you the word of God
[2:04:26] to make yourself ready for the rapture.
[2:04:29] You are a wise virgin.
[2:04:31] Don't live like someone from here or
[2:04:33] from here. I have predestinated you,
[2:04:35] ordained you to be healed.
[2:04:37] You can fly higher than the things of
[2:04:39] the world. Let's sing. I'll set my
[2:04:41] wings.
[2:04:43] Oh, set your I set my wings to the wings
[2:04:48] of faith.
[2:04:52] For I can fly
[2:04:56] in a higher place.
[2:05:00] I do not struggle.
[2:05:05] It's by grace.
[2:05:07] [Music]
[2:05:08] I set you
[2:05:12] to the winds of faith. As the music is
[2:05:16] playing softly, we bow our heads all of
[2:05:19] us. But maybe as a sign to defy the
[2:05:23] gravity, someone can raise his hand this
[2:05:26] morning. Lord, I decide, I'm resolved to
[2:05:29] follow you, Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:05:33] I want to set my wings,
[2:05:36] the winds of faith and believe your
[2:05:38] word. Father, accept your word and I
[2:05:40] surrender myself to you. I don't want to
[2:05:43] be struggling. I don't want to be having
[2:05:45] my ups and downs, the doubts sometimes.
[2:05:48] So, am I saved? I'm not saved or if the
[2:05:51] rapture comes today, am I going to be
[2:05:54] there? But Lord, help me to come to that
[2:05:57] place of resting place. You know where
[2:06:00] I'm
[2:06:03] raised my hand. Just say no one is
[2:06:06] looking at you but you with God. Lord, I
[2:06:09] want to come together.
[2:06:11] Father, Lord Jesus Christ, you know the
[2:06:13] hands have been raised this morning as

[2:06:44] don't want to be living like under the
[2:06:45] mark of the beast or the people will be
[2:06:48] under the mark of the beast in the
[2:06:50] worldly things. Oh Lord, I don't even
[2:06:52] want to be living as just a foolish
[2:06:54] virgin, lukewarm, sleeping and putting
[2:06:58] things aside and being negligent and not

[2:07:04] Holy Ghost or what father Lord as a even
