[8:20] the provisions that you give to us, oh
[8:22] Lord.
[8:24] Father, it's only by your grace that we
[8:26] do what we do, Lord. Because without it,
[8:29] Lord,
[8:31] there's nothing we can do. Father, we
[8:33] thank you for that abundant grace that
[8:36] you have given us. Dear heavenly father,
[8:40] your children this evening have gathered
[8:43] looking up on high, Lord, expecting more

[9:46] May your will be done tonight, Lord. May
[9:49] you give us
[9:51] the rest that we need in your word.
[9:55] Father, you predestinated us for a
[9:57] reason. We know what you have done for
[10:01] us is not in vain. May we not be here in
[10:06] vain. Lord, may we search our
[10:08] soulselves, Lord, and you ask for
[10:12] forgiveness for anything that may be
[10:15] outside your will.

[24:12] &gt;&gt; Not I might hearken, not maybe, but it
[24:16] says for sure I will hearken unto you.
[24:18] That's the promise God is giving to the
[24:20] bride. So when we come for prayer, he's
[24:23] hearing our prayers
[24:25] &gt;&gt; and he's also answering our prayers and
[24:28] God is faithful. Then you shall seek me
[24:31] and find me when you shall search for me
[24:34] with all your heart.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; And I will be found of you say the Lord.
[24:39] Amen.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; And I will turn away your captivity. I
[24:43] will gather you from all the nations and
[24:45] from all the places whether I have
[24:47] driven you, say the Lord. and I'll bring
[24:50] you again unto the place once I caused
[24:52] you to be carried away captive.

[24:57] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father,
[24:59] we thank you for your grace, your mercy.
[25:02] Thank you, Father. Lord, for each
[25:04] individual this evening, Father, I came,
[25:06] Lord, create me atmosphere, welcoming
[25:09] you, Father, as you dwell in the midst
[25:11] of the praises and our worship,
[25:13] adoration. Father, I believe that you
[25:15] are you are satisfied. You are you are
[25:18] happy Father Lord for to see the
[25:20] believers singing for you and glorifying
[25:22] your name father despite the the the
[25:25] tiredness of the day and the different
[25:28] things but now to focus just on you lord
[25:30] that you become the center of our mind
[25:33] thank you the center of our s of our
[25:35] thought father may you have the
[25:37] preeminence father as we'll mention
[25:39] father we share the word of god for a
[25:41] moment as we prepare for prayer father
[25:44] may you be with us for the remainder of
[25:46] the service as we love you. We thank you
[25:48] for the promise that you have given us.
[25:50] Positive statement, positive promise,
[25:53] father and we are standing on those
[25:55] promises. Let your name be glorified in
[25:57] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And have a seat for a moment.
[26:04] Amen.
[26:09] Glory to his name. I just want to share
[26:11] with you a small thought as we go to
[26:14] prayer. aligning with God's thought.
[26:18] Aligning with God's thought. The thought
[26:21] of God are thought of peace. Thought of
[26:24] God are not thought of of evil but
[26:27] thought of G of peace because God has an
[26:30] expected end. God is looking at at a
[26:33] final goal.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; God is looking at the final goal. No
[26:36] matter what which way you might go,
[26:38] things might turn out and everything,
[26:41] God is at peace because he knows the
[26:42] final goal. Amen.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; God God knows already the final at the
[26:46] end of the story. Amen.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; That's why he's not worried. That's why
[26:50] he's not under under stress. That's why
[26:52] God is not he's not going to and fro.
[26:54] God is not tossed to and fro. God is
[26:57] just at rest because he knows the end
[26:59] result. Amen.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; As it was in that boat with the
[27:02] disciples or Jesus Christ was not
[27:04] carried about and carried here and
[27:06] tossed about here and there. He knew
[27:08] where it was going to end up. He knew
[27:10] his position. He knew his place. He knew
[27:13] what that the mission that God has
[27:14] given. He knew that he's not going to be
[27:16] destroyed. He knew everything. So if we
[27:19] can align ourself with how God thinks
[27:22] and how God sees things, we will have
[27:24] the rest in our soul for sure.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Many times is because we don't think
[27:29] God's thoughts. Amen. We put our own
[27:32] thoughts. Amen. That's where we fail and
[27:34] that's where the enemy knows our
[27:35] weakness sometimes because we try to
[27:38] think with our own thoughts. But let
[27:39] this evening remove our own thought,
[27:42] remove our own reasoning, remove how we
[27:45] can try to figure out things and let
[27:47] God's thought reign. Amen.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; And God thought has been expressed
[27:51] through his word. Amen. If you read the
[27:53] word of God, you are reading God
[27:55] thought. Amen.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; That's where we have to find God today.
[27:58] Amen.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Because God's purpose,
[28:01] God's end result can never be defeated.
[28:04] No matter what the enemy puts, God's
[28:07] purpose can never be defeated.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; If God has put, even we are here for one
[28:12] purpose. Amen.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; How many believe that they are here for
[28:15] a purpose?
[28:16] &gt;&gt; We are living on earth here for a
[28:18] purpose. Amen.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; The prophet I was reading the prophet,
[28:20] he would say, you know, we have been
[28:22] here to rule and to reign to praise the
[28:25] Lord and to live for God. Amen.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; I say, "Oh, thank God. That's my
[28:29] purpose. is here to reign and to rule
[28:31] and also father to praise you and to
[28:34] live for you to honor you by my life.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; That's what I desire to be.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; Unbelief only stops the unbeliever.
[28:42] Unbelief does not stop God.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe it stops you may stop to see the
[28:48] result of God at the time where God
[28:50] wanted to show to you. It prolonged it.
[28:52] Maybe delayed it for a while. Amen. But
[28:55] the end result will come. Amen.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Israel was supposed to receive Moses
[28:59] when he came but they rejected him. They
[29:01] didn't deserve the the gift. They
[29:03] rejected him.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; And then God say, "Okay, then you are
[29:06] going to wait for a little while." But
[29:08] the end result is still the same. Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Unbelief only stops the unbelievers but
[29:13] does not stop God.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Because God's purpose will always come
[29:17] to pass. That's why saying he's saying
[29:20] here, you know, this time as Jeremiah is
[29:22] giving this prophecy, they are midst
[29:24] they they're about I think they're about
[29:26] to be carried away. So it's G is the one
[29:28] who has been giving all the the the
[29:30] promises or not the pro prophecy but the
[29:33] prophecies that relate to their
[29:35] captivity.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; He's the prophet like the one lament the
[29:38] weeping prophet. He's one who saying
[29:41] things that are not. It is a negative
[29:42] prophet. This a always telling about our
[29:44] destruction. always telling us how we
[29:46] are going to be kept capt always telling
[29:48] how Babylon is going to reign upon us
[29:50] but in the midst of all the prophecies
[29:52] here he's giving a promise to Israel
[29:55] &gt;&gt; I will never leave you because my
[29:57] thoughts towards you are thought of
[29:59] peace
[30:00] &gt;&gt; even if you are going through this trial
[30:02] even if I'm I'm allowing this to because
[30:04] you want to draw their attention on
[30:06] something
[30:06] &gt;&gt; sometimes God has to draw our attention
[30:08] sometimes you know you know you have
[30:10] been going different ways he like a good
[30:12] shepherd you know sometimes he has to
[30:15] break your legs a little bit.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Says, "Oh, what happened?" Oh, let me go
[30:19] back to church now.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah, he has broken your leg. You say,
[30:23] "Thank you, Lord, for breaking my legs."
[30:25] Because if I was just wondering myself
[30:27] on my own, I'll be lost. I can't lead
[30:29] myself. I need to be brought back. Amen.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; So sometimes God can break the legs. But
[30:34] if thought is not to hurt, it's not the
[30:36] order of confusion. It's not the the
[30:39] order of frustration. Is the order of
[30:41] peace. Amen. The end result is for our
[30:44] good. Everything works together for
[30:46] those who have been called and those who
[30:48] love the Lord.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; Even the same thing for Moses. Moses was
[30:54] called for a purpose. But Moses failed.
[30:58] He made a mistake. Amen. He wanted to do
[31:01] things on his own and he failed. But
[31:03] even though in his failure, God never
[31:06] removed the purpose for Moses.
[31:09] God never removed the end result for
[31:11] Moses. Amen.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; He had still to call him. Amen. Even
[31:15] Moses start denying himself. So no, I I
[31:18] don't think I I'm fit for that work. I
[31:20] don't I don't think I can do that work.
[31:22] God says, "Oh, now you are ready to do
[31:24] the work because you can't rely on your
[31:27] own ability. Now you're ready to do the
[31:29] work.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; When you feel like you can do everything
[31:32] on your own and I'll say maybe you're in
[31:34] a bad position. You should be in a
[31:36] position. God, I depend completely on
[31:39] you. I depend on you. Amen.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; God wants us to pray. Amen.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Just imagine if we didn't have any need.
[31:48] Oh, we feel like we all we are
[31:50] self-sufficient. We call ourselves small
[31:52] Elohims. No, God does not want that. He
[31:54] want sometimes to put us the needs among
[31:56] us. So, we cry onto him. Amen. Then God
[32:00] is going to show his attribute. He's
[32:02] going to show how great mother eagle is.
[32:04] Amen. so that we admire his wings. Oh
[32:08] beautiful mother, thank you for saving
[32:10] me. Thank you for rescuing me. Thank you
[32:12] for healing me. Thank you for saving my
[32:15] children. Thank you for baptizing me
[32:17] with the Holy Ghost. Thank you for
[32:18] giving me a life of victory. Amen.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; May God help us to align with his
[32:24] thought. Amen.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; That's my desire.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:30] The Bible says in Isaiah 55, for my
[32:33] thoughts are not your thought.
[32:36] So God is making sure all sometime when
[32:38] you think no my thoughts are not your
[32:40] thoughts. Neither are your ways my ways.
[32:43] Say the Lord. For as the heavens are
[32:45] higher than the earth, so are my ways
[32:48] higher than your ways, my thoughts than
[32:51] your thought. Amen. Oh God, let me
[32:54] remove my thought about any situation
[32:57] and go through your thoughts because
[32:58] they are way higher than my thought.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; My thoughts are usually about worries.
[33:05] Oh, how is going to how it's going to
[33:07] turn out? How when because that those
[33:09] thought are affected by five senses
[33:12] &gt;&gt; and the five senses they put us in
[33:14] contact of this and we trigger something
[33:16] in the brain and we start thinking and
[33:18] but you know sometimes you start
[33:19] thinking you start going away from the
[33:21] word of God it's time to stop oh go
[33:24] pinch yourself oh no I should not be
[33:27] thinking those thought they are not God
[33:29] thought what does God thought says God
[33:32] say God thought says you know what by
[33:34] your stripes I'm healed
[33:36] &gt;&gt; that God thought for my situation.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. God thought this bride
[33:42] shall not fail. As he failed, this last
[33:45] eve will not fail. Amen.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Despite my weaknesses, I will not fall.
[33:51] I will not fail. Amen.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; I will get to the end result.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Prophet says in exposition
[33:58] church age, age of virtue says the
[34:01] eternal thought of God. Let me ask you,
[34:04] are the thoughts of God eternal? If you
[34:07] can see this, you will see many things.
[34:10] God is unchangeable in both essence and
[34:13] behavior.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; He says we have studied that and proven
[34:17] that already. God is infinite in his
[34:19] abilities.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; So therefore, God must be omnisient.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; God is omnisient means he knows
[34:25] everything.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Cuz when you come to God in prayer, you
[34:31] don't come to God like you are telling
[34:33] him a new thing. Lucy you don't don't
[34:36] you see that don't you see that was the
[34:38] behavior of the disciples in the boat
[34:41] &gt;&gt; master don't you know that we are about
[34:44] to perish because they thinking he has
[34:47] to know he has to learn new things don't
[34:50] you see my situation the Israelite in
[34:52] wilderness Moses don't you doesn't god
[34:56] see what we are going through no that's
[34:58] not that's the wrong approach
[35:00] &gt;&gt; that's right
[35:01] &gt;&gt; oh god you know what I'm going through
[35:04] and you have already provided the a way.
[35:07] So I'm coming to you Lord to claim my
[35:09] inheritance. My promise you promised
[35:12] this and I'm standing on the ground of
[35:13] your word. I know your word is faithful
[35:16] and I'm standing on your word. Amen.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Then God says, "Oh, he knows who I am.
[35:21] He knows who he's talking to. He knows
[35:24] the person is he can trust." Amen.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; He says if he's omnicient then he he's
[35:33] not now learning nor is he taking
[35:36] counsel even with himself nor is he at
[35:38] any time adding to his knowledge.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; If he can add to his knowledge then he's
[35:44] not omnicient. The best we could say is
[35:47] that sometimes he will be so but that is
[35:50] not scriptural. He is omnisient. Amen.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; He has never had a new thought about
[35:56] anything because all he thought he has
[35:59] already had and always will have and
[36:04] knows the end from the beginning because
[36:07] he is God.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus Christ, if I can
[36:12] understand that you know the end of
[36:14] everything before it even starts, the
[36:18] enemy might put it like he's starting
[36:20] with a new thing on you. No, that's not
[36:22] a new thing. God's already knew that you
[36:25] will come and he already put protection
[36:27] for you all the way.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, if you are
[36:30] predestinated, you have been foren, God
[36:33] has already put the protection all the
[36:34] way. The enemy is discovering things,
[36:37] but God knows everything.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Like one time we are having fellowship.
[36:41] I like to like, you know, this game we
[36:43] are in, it's a little bit rigged.
[36:47] It's a little bit rigged because God is
[36:50] protecting you all the way because he
[36:52] knows he cannot lose you.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; So he makes sure that you will get to
[36:56] the end result.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; No matter which way you go, the king in
[36:59] that game can never be lost. Can never
[37:01] be killed. No matter how much you have
[37:04] lost along the game, but that king who
[37:06] is the end of the game can never be
[37:08] lost.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; That you, that king there, that king can
[37:12] never be lost.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. No matter which way it
[37:16] go, no matter how hard it is, no matter
[37:18] the circumstances, the end result is
[37:21] always a winning side.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Says then he knows the end from the
[37:31] beginning because he's God. That's the
[37:32] thought of God are eternal. They are
[37:35] real. Think about the thought of God are
[37:37] real. I would say they're even more real
[37:40] than what we see,
[37:42] &gt;&gt; than what we hear, than what we touch,
[37:44] than our feelings. Because God thought
[37:49] &gt;&gt; everything that we see, they used to be
[37:51] a thought of God, now there's been
[37:53] expressed. Amen.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; But now God is saying, "No, those even
[37:56] the things that you see, if they against
[37:59] my word, the word of God, don't don't
[38:02] put your emphasis on them. Put your
[38:04] emphasis on God thought." Amen.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:08] So they are not simply like a man with a
[38:09] blueprint he has drawn up and which
[38:12] would and which one day will be
[38:14] translated into substance and form. You
[38:17] know a blueprint a man an architect put
[38:20] some blueprint. I would like the door to
[38:21] be here. I would like the door to be
[38:23] here. So those building make sure that
[38:25] you follow those those the the blueprint
[38:29] because if you do that you'll mess up in
[38:31] one way. Yes. The other way it's not
[38:34] that like that. God has already put the
[38:37] blueprint because he knows the end. He
[38:40] knows that it will be here, it will be
[38:41] here, it will be here, here. No matter
[38:43] the circumstances, the end result, I
[38:45] will have a house that will have that
[38:47] form.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; I will have a masterpiece bride.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; No matter the circumstances,
[38:52] &gt;&gt; positive statement from God. But listen
[38:55] what I want to say. But they are already
[38:56] real and eternal and part of God.
[39:01] So if you are thought of God, you are
[39:03] already real and eternal and part of
[39:07] God. You can never be lost as God can
[39:10] never be lost.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like that. He continues says, "Now
[39:17] he has chosen he has chosen us in him
[39:19] Jesus before the foundation of the
[39:21] world."
[39:23] Now that means that we were right with
[39:25] him in the mind and thought of God
[39:28] before the foundation of the world. If
[39:30] you're not thought of God at the
[39:32] beginning, you cannot be thought of God
[39:33] expressed at the end.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Because you have to start by being
[39:36] thought God's thought. Amen. So
[39:38] sometimes we are on earth here. We think
[39:41] like okay let me I'm a earthly being. Oh
[39:44] God I want to make to I want to be in
[39:46] heaven. Let me try to find a way to get
[39:49] to heaven. No, you have already been
[39:51] eternal thought from God. Now you're
[39:54] just going back to where you used to be.
[39:56] Amen.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not trying to make
[39:58] something up out of yourself. No, you
[40:00] have already been in God. You're going
[40:02] back to God. Amen.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Being expressed in thought, but you're
[40:06] being expressed now. That gives an
[40:08] eternal quality to the elect. You can't
[40:11] get away from that. An elect has an
[40:14] eternal quality to it. An eternal
[40:16] quality attached to it. Amen. It's not
[40:18] the quality that he has to improve or
[40:21] becoming better and everything and no
[40:23] you you you have already eternal
[40:26] quality. God want you to express that
[40:29] eternal quality because it's already
[40:31] seed inside of you. He want to express
[40:33] that eternal quality that you already
[40:35] have inside of you. Are you with me this
[40:37] evening?
[40:39] &gt;&gt; A few minutes here. So that's what made
[40:41] the that what was with Jesus Christ.
[40:44] That what made the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:46] have perfect faith. What was perfect
[40:49] faith? Perfect faith that Jesus Christ
[40:51] had is he knew what the word of God says
[40:54] about him.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; What is the word of God? The word of God
[40:58] is the eternal thought of God being
[41:00] expressed.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; In other terms, Jesus Christ was already
[41:04] aligned with the God's thought. God
[41:07] eternal thought. That's why he couldn't
[41:09] he couldn't be worried. He couldn't he
[41:11] couldn't be the circumstances could not
[41:14] shake him because he already had he was
[41:17] already aligned with God's thought. He
[41:20] knew what the scripture was saying about
[41:22] him and he knew that the scriptures can
[41:24] never be broken regarding him. The
[41:27] scriptures can never be broken. If we
[41:30] come to have the same perfect faith if
[41:32] we come to align ourself with God
[41:35] thought I will guarantee you we will
[41:37] have perfect faith because you don't
[41:39] depend on your thought. You don't depend
[41:41] on the circumstances. You depend on
[41:43] God's word.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; It says Jesus relied upon what he was.
[41:48] He relied in knowing that he was the
[41:50] word. He had faith in God who made him
[41:53] the word. He was God the word and they
[41:56] was in him and they give him faith
[41:58] because he understood his position. He
[42:01] know what he was because the scripture
[42:03] said he was this. every scripture tied
[42:06] in to prove that he was exactly what the
[42:09] scripture said he will be.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Can you know that he go into the grave
[42:13] only with one scripture? The anointing
[42:16] shall not the anointing shall not see
[42:18] corruption. Only one scripture. How much
[42:21] more the bride? There's so many
[42:22] promises. God knows the expected end for
[42:26] the bride.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; What the expected end for the bride on
[42:28] this earth is the rapture. Amen. The
[42:30] body change. Amen. As you feed upon the
[42:33] word of God, you are manifesting those
[42:35] eternal quality that God already put
[42:37] inside of you.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; That's why the proverb say if you have
[42:40] the Holy Ghost, you you have everything
[42:43] inside of you.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; You have resurrection, you have the
[42:45] rapture, you have healing, you have the
[42:47] joy of salvation, everything is in that
[42:50] seed. Amen. Everything is in the Holy
[42:52] Ghost.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Praise God.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; So because the scripture said he was
[43:03] this and here every scripture I didn't
[43:04] prove.
[43:06] Therefore he relied upon what God had
[43:08] made him and if he did that then can't
[43:12] we rely upon what God made us as
[43:15] believers.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; We can rely on what God made us as
[43:18] believer because we do not make
[43:20] ourselves believers. God made us
[43:22] believers.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; And what is the believer? A believer is
[43:26] the faith of God that moves in you.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Say I'm a believer. Yes. One body you're
[43:31] a believer. But when a believer is
[43:33] because God put the faith inside of you
[43:36] and that faith is moving you. Amen.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Why you you can say you you you you have
[43:40] the same quality of haterite.
[43:43] This is nothing else but the truth.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Hatite. Did you see the squares? No. But
[43:50] I know this is nothing else but the
[43:52] truth.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Hatite. Can you explain how the the
[43:55] squirrel were created? I don't know. But
[43:58] this is nothing else but dirt but the
[44:01] truth.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; That's the same quality that inside of
[44:04] you brothers and sisters.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; And God gave her God gave her the
[44:09] salvation of her children.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; The deacon was there but he was
[44:14] doubting.
[44:15] I was fellowshiing one brother. You know
[44:17] you know the worst things about the
[44:18] deacon. He didn't even know that he was
[44:21] doubting
[44:23] because he denied us. No, I was not
[44:25] doubting. Oh Lord, I don't want to be in
[44:28] that position where you are doubting.
[44:30] You are not even aware that you are
[44:31] doubting. I want to be in a position of
[44:34] hating right. Oh Lord, this is nothing
[44:36] else but the truth. I can't explain it.
[44:38] I don't want any secondary proof. I
[44:41] don't want to any
[44:43] word. I just take you at your word and I
[44:46] keep moving on. Amen. I'm coming with
[44:48] the needs and you know my needs and I'm
[44:50] moving on knowing that you answer to my
[44:52] needs
[44:55] &gt;&gt; no matter how difficult they can be.
[44:56] Amen.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; The Bible says let your testimony always
[45:01] and your thought in the law 55 never
[45:05] permit a negative thought to come in
[45:06] your mind if you can help it. When it's
[45:10] thought that don't entertain it well you
[45:13] say I can't help the thought from
[45:15] coming. Well, that would be like the
[45:18] farmer that said he couldn't stop the
[45:20] birds from flying over his place, but he
[45:23] could sure stop them from roosting.
[45:26] So, don't so that that a good thing. You
[45:29] see, you can't have the thoughts that
[45:31] when they come, but don't entertain
[45:33] them. Just pass it on. No, sir. Jesus is
[45:37] my No, sir. Jesus Christ is my savior.
[45:40] All things are mine by God.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep them. I'm going to
[45:44] testify of them. And God can only bless
[45:47] you as you confess that he has done it
[45:49] for you. Amen. So the third is to
[45:52] proclaim what God has already done for
[45:54] you. He's the high priest of our
[45:56] confession. Is that right? Hebrews 3,
[45:58] the prophet says, he said that he's the
[46:00] high priest of our confession. He can
[46:02] only do for us as we accept it and
[46:05] believe it and confess it.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; There was one question asked the prophet
[46:10] and I like that question. Thank God for
[46:12] the sister as the brothers asked that
[46:13] question. Brother Bana, please explain
[46:15] how a person knows if he's thinking his
[46:17] own thought or if the devil is placing
[46:19] thoughts in his mind to make him think
[46:21] wrong. Especially if you know you do not
[46:24] want to think them. You can't
[46:30] they come they come.
[46:34] Especially when someone gossiped about
[46:36] someone else. Every time you see them,
[46:42] don't entertain that.
[46:45] Let me try to find out. Let me try to
[46:47] you entertaining that. You're
[46:48] entertaining that. But but how do you
[46:51] know? Sometimes you think that you are
[46:52] thinking good thing. But how do you know
[46:55] if that your thought was God's thought
[46:58] and says then it if it's contrary to the
[47:00] word, it's the devil thinking. If it is
[47:04] with the word is God thinking.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; We touch that a little bit on on on
[47:09] Sunday about knowledge. If you if the
[47:12] contrary to the word it's the devil
[47:13] thing. If it's with the word it's God
[47:15] thinking.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes people don't even know if it's
[47:20] the word of God or not.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those are thinking that in a
[47:24] certain trend but they don't know that
[47:27] it's not the word of God. They're just
[47:29] thinking. They continue thinking and
[47:31] it's not God thinking. But what God's
[47:34] grace has given us that he has given out
[47:36] the word of God has been unveiled so
[47:39] that we can know the thought of God
[47:41] being expressed. So once you know the
[47:44] thought of God being expressed, you
[47:46] align with the thought of God. You
[47:49] reject your own thought. You take God
[47:51] thought which is the word of God. Amen.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:55] If it's good thought of the word prophet
[47:57] of the word and of God, it's God
[48:00] thinking
[48:02] then the question continues. If the case
[48:05] may be that the devil is placing thought
[48:07] in in your mind about a certain thing,
[48:09] how may it be overcome or got rid of it?
[48:12] Gives the solution. Thank God. Take the
[48:15] very vice versa from it. If the devil
[48:19] makes you think that you are, if you
[48:20] know you're a Christian and he tries to
[48:22] make you think that you are not a
[48:24] Christian, just take the ver the versa
[48:26] the opposite of it not the terms and say
[48:29] I am a Christian.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; As long as your experience matches in
[48:33] God's word, say I am a Christian.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But but what about this? What
[48:38] about this? I look into the word of God
[48:40] and my experience matches the word of
[48:41] God. I am a Christian. Amen.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; We know sometimes what the enemy tries
[48:46] to put on our because we don't know our
[48:48] word. We don't know where to stand on
[48:50] the word of God. Jesus Christ knew where
[48:53] he was standing upon the word of God.
[48:55] That's why it's important. I'm going to
[48:58] message on Sunday. It's important to
[49:00] know the word of God.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; If you don't know the word of God, it
[49:04] will be playing with you.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Could be just one day saying today you
[49:07] feel like you're saved, tomorrow you're
[49:08] not saved. No, you need to know the word
[49:11] of God. I know the word of God. I know I
[49:14] I I repented. I I I I I've been baptized
[49:17] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[49:19] Amen. And I've been filled with the Holy
[49:21] Ghost.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; And I know my position.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; I know. How do you know that you are
[49:26] born again? Because I believe the word
[49:28] of God of my age. How do you know you're
[49:30] born again? Because the desires I used
[49:33] to have, I don't have them no more.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Can you make mistake? Yes, I can make
[49:37] mistakes. But right away I repent and I
[49:40] align myself with God's word.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; So you know your position. So you kind
[49:44] of be oh today am I forgiven? I'm not.
[49:47] And every time every time you repent for
[49:49] the same mistakes over and over
[49:53] and you think that you're spiritual.
[49:55] You're not spiritual.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; It's just the devil trying to put them
[49:58] things upon you. You know your position
[50:00] repented for it and you stand on it and
[50:02] you move on. Amen.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; And you don't open a door to that thing
[50:06] anymore. You protect yourself from that
[50:08] thing. Amen.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Each one of us has is is a weak spot.
[50:12] Amen. So you protect your weak spot. You
[50:14] know the enemy when he comes on that
[50:16] weak spot. It can be on internet. You
[50:18] close that window. You can be on a you
[50:20] can be your temper and then when it
[50:22] comes you cool down. You take the
[50:24] opposite. Amen.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Otherwise you'll be a Christian because
[50:28] you don't know where to stand.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[50:36] Prophet says in spiritual adoption
[50:38] in order to stay with God stay gentle.
[50:42] God is gentle. In order to stay with God
[50:45] stay with love. God is love. Stay meek.
[50:49] Not never be self-sufficient.
[50:52] Always rely upon him.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Never use your own mind. Take his
[50:59] thought.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Let his thought be your thoughts.
[51:04] That's my prayer. Oh God, I want my
[51:06] thoughts to be your thoughts.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Help me. He has given us a secret. How
[51:11] to know that these are my thoughts. This
[51:13] the enemy thought is when it's not
[51:15] aligning with your word.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; That's my own thought that the enemy
[51:18] thought and I don't want to entertain
[51:20] that. They can come, but I don't want to
[51:22] entertain that. I move them away and I
[51:25] stay on God's word. Amen.
[51:28] said take them into your connal mind and
[51:31] you repeat them over.
[51:34] Isn't that a good secret?
[51:36] &gt;&gt; You take them put because this the mind
[51:38] is is the is the greatest that where the
[51:40] greatest battle is happening is in our
[51:42] mind.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; But very easily we take other things
[51:46] have I have my kids here when they go to
[51:49] school and they come home I find them
[51:51] singing the songs and different songs.
[51:54] What those songs come? Oh, we know
[51:57] quickly it goes in their mind, right?
[52:00] By the word of God.
[52:02] That way we should put in our mind. More
[52:04] of the word of God. More of the word of
[52:06] God in our mind. More the word of God.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; And you repeat them over and over. Oh,
[52:10] I'm healed. The word of God by his
[52:12] stripes I'm healed.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; I'm an overcomer.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; I will not fall. Amen. The promises of
[52:20] God. You take sometimes of the thing the
[52:22] promise of brother Bam. We we we have a
[52:24] wonderful chat there. Thank you for the
[52:27] quotes that come from Damsa because we
[52:29] want our mind to be on the word of God.
[52:31] Our mind to be you can do on day
[52:33] different things. But thank God for
[52:35] reminding me what the word of God says.
[52:36] Put them in your house. Put them in your
[52:38] car. Put them do so that your mind stays
[52:41] upon the word of God. Repeat them over
[52:44] and over and say, "Oh God, take all my
[52:46] doubt away and let my thought be your
[52:49] thought." And you sick people do what I
[52:52] do that as as we are repeat as we are
[52:55] speaking just take away cast away the
[52:58] thought of sickness
[53:00] take God's healing thought let them
[53:03] become your thought
[53:05] &gt;&gt; so you take your thought of sickness oh
[53:07] I'm sick and the doctor says this and
[53:09] everything oh yeah they do their work
[53:11] but take God's healing thought and let
[53:14] them become your thought
[53:16] &gt;&gt; you become them your thought I want to
[53:18] align with God's thought not my thought
[53:21] God thought that's where there is value
[53:24] in think upon these things the Bible
[53:26] says if there is any praise if there be
[53:28] any virtue think upon these things
[53:32] &gt;&gt; word becoming flesh says what kind
[53:37] says
[53:39] if becomes a real revelation of that you
[53:42] where am I just want to get somewhere
[53:44] when your mind and your leading and your
[53:46] guiding becomes a direct place or direct
[53:48] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that
[53:50] you are moving your mortal being. What
[53:52] kind of people should we be? If the very
[53:56] Holy Spirit has as you so embodied and
[53:59] empowered that you don't use your own
[54:02] thoughts, you don't use your own mind,
[54:04] you don't use your own opinions by the
[54:07] Holy Spirit has you so built until your
[54:11] thought and your being is God's spirit
[54:14] expressing itself through you. That's
[54:17] what we desire. God, I want you to
[54:19] express yourself through me. Amen.
[54:22] Through the Holy Spirit leading me to
[54:23] the word of God. I want you to be
[54:26] expressed through my life. It was God's
[54:29] thought. The thought of God has been
[54:31] expressed. It become God's word. Now the
[54:33] word of God need to be expressed in the
[54:36] believer. Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; I want to be God thought expressed. I
[54:40] want to be attribute of God expressed.
[54:42] Amen.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; I don't want to express any other thing
[54:45] but God's word. Amen.
[54:49] closing this.
[54:51] Isn't it wonderful? Think when we we
[54:54] mean that everything is surrendered. I'm
[54:57] no more my own thinking. I hasn't I
[55:01] haven't going I'm going I'm not going to
[55:04] think like I I will think. Lord, I'm
[55:06] just going to think like you think.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; And you promise that I I was healed. I
[55:13] think that
[55:14] &gt;&gt; I surrender my thinking. I won't no more
[55:17] think about my sickness. I won't think
[55:20] about the disease I had. I'm not going
[55:23] to be thinking about about nothing but
[55:26] thinking what you said. Now, right out
[55:31] in front of you stand a person just like
[55:33] he was a few minutes ago. He's talking
[55:35] to a person that you were sick down
[55:37] here, but there is a well person
[55:40] standing there. Jesus Christ is calling
[55:43] to that well person right beyond it.
[55:45] Amen. Now you just by faith you close
[55:48] your eyes, walk right into that well
[55:51] body then just keep on walking just keep
[55:54] on going. Amen.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; So you know you have it's not it's not
[55:58] fabricating an image. No that's not what
[56:00] he's trying to say. Say God already had
[56:02] a perfect image of you being healed.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Because God word says that. Amen. He has
[56:08] a perfect image of you being walking in
[56:11] a victorious life. He has already had
[56:13] that perfect image. Now you need to
[56:15] align with the perfect image of God.
[56:18] Amen. Because that how God sees you.
[56:21] That how the word of God declares that
[56:23] you are. Amen. You see the Florence
[56:25] Netting if you see the picture of her.
[56:28] The prophet was looking at the picture
[56:29] of her says miserable place. I mean I I
[56:33] even wonder where the tears were coming
[56:35] from. Where is water? Where's the
[56:36] moisture coming from? She was so such a
[56:39] miserable place.
[56:41] But when the anointing came
[56:43] &gt;&gt; says now you can just walk into that
[56:46] well-being person that God has of you.
[56:50] Just keep confessing God I'm healed. See
[56:52] yourself in that well-being person that
[56:54] God has made you. You will see things
[56:57] change and we know the end result of
[56:59] Florence nothing. How you see the two
[57:01] pictures you can is it really the same
[57:03] person? But God was already looking at
[57:05] the last picture even though she was in
[57:08] a in a in a very bad situation. But in
[57:11] God's mind, he was already looking at
[57:13] the nice picture. The same thing for the
[57:15] bride. No matter where you can be, God
[57:18] is already looking at the very nice
[57:20] picture of you. Amen. The devil doesn't
[57:22] know. He knows maybe the the other
[57:24] picture, but we need to look God's word.
[57:27] That what has the right picture for us.
[57:29] Praise be to his name.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. musicians can come as we go
[57:35] through the word to prayer. Amen.
[57:48] Romans 12:2 as they're coming. Bible
[57:50] says, "Be not conformed to this world,
[57:53] but being transformed by the renewing of
[57:56] your mind that you may prove what is
[57:59] that good, acceptable, and perfect will
[58:02] of God." We desire to be transformed by
[58:05] the renewing of our mind. The greatest
[58:08] place, the the place where the greatest
[58:10] battle is happening is our mind where
[58:12] they're trying to get. He can't get to
[58:14] the soul, but he can get to the mind. So
[58:16] now we need our mind need to be
[58:18] transformed. We need to have the mind of
[58:20] Christ. How can you have the mind of
[58:22] Christ? Align yourself with the word of
[58:24] God. Because Christ is the word of God.
[58:28] Amen.

[1:00:49] Someone has a request like to express to
[1:00:51] the congregation before we go in prayer
[1:00:54] a testimony.
[1:00:57] [Music]
[1:01:11] Um, I just have a short testimony. Last
[1:01:14] week, we put in a prayer request for
[1:01:18] paperwork for my brother's uh
[1:01:21] repatriation uh back home. I just want
[1:01:24] to thank God that um everything is going
[1:01:29] in order. All the paperwork has started.
[1:01:31] So they said by the end of the week uh
[1:01:35] they should have uh the final result and
[1:01:38] they should be able to repatriate the
[1:01:40] body back home.
[1:01:43] [Applause]
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Praise be God.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Another one.
[1:01:52] I'd like to thank God.
[1:01:55] Last week, last week we prayed about
[1:01:59] um my little business and that we're
[1:02:03] waiting on God to provide us with um
[1:02:07] children. And this week we've gotten one
[1:02:10] child
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; and we really thank God for providing.
[1:02:16] [Applause]
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. It's one thing to ask
[1:02:22] for request, but God likes a a thankful
[1:02:26] heart.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Come say, "Thank God for helping me."
[1:02:29] Amen. Brother Joseph,
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um,
[1:02:38] I just want to thank the Lord for
[1:02:42] providing me with an opportunity to be
[1:02:45] in his house as often as
[1:02:48] I can whenever the doors are open.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; I
[1:02:56] was offered with the same company. They
[1:02:58] offered me a new position that I didn't
[1:03:01] apply for.
[1:03:03] And
[1:03:05] I I I I actually don't know how it
[1:03:09] happened.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; It is just God.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Um about a year and a half ago, my wife
[1:03:17] had a dream that they had offered me the
[1:03:21] same job
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; and she told me, but I forgot about it.
[1:03:27] I
[1:03:29] you know, I I just don't have enough
[1:03:32] words to express how I can thank the
[1:03:36] Lord. It's I my background is
[1:03:40] accounting.
[1:03:41] I lost my job in Calgary uh in 2014
[1:03:47] in accounting and I gave up. I got
[1:03:49] depressed. I stopped studying
[1:03:51] accounting. I don't have my designation
[1:03:54] and I went into labor. uh did full labor
[1:03:58] for seven years
[1:04:00] and from nowhere
[1:04:04] the company I work for just said we want
[1:04:06] you to be an accountant.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Praise be to God.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; I just don't know how it happened.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:04:19] Praise be to God.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Our God is doing great miracles.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Our God is
[1:04:28] tremendous.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Wonderful thing he does. Amen. Was
[1:04:32] someone else
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; the Lord that um I had pain in my foot
[1:04:39] um and I just kept thanking the Lord for
[1:04:43] my healing. And then um I had gone to
[1:04:46] the chiropractor and he had done some
[1:04:48] adjustments on me. And then he um he'd
[1:04:51] obviously asked in the beginning how how
[1:04:54] my health was and whatever. And I
[1:04:56] mentioned my foot. And then as soon as I
[1:04:58] did that, I realized at that moment I
[1:05:01] was like, "Oh, you shouldn't have said
[1:05:02] anything." Because I hadn't said
[1:05:04] anything out loud. I was just thanking
[1:05:06] the Lord for my healing. And whenever my
[1:05:09] foot would hurt, I would just say,
[1:05:11] "Thank you, Lord, for my healing out
[1:05:13] loud, but I wouldn't say for my foot or
[1:05:15] anything like that because I didn't want
[1:05:16] Satan to know." And I was like, why did
[1:05:18] I say something? And I immediately con
[1:05:21] felt convicted. And then he said, oh,
[1:05:24] it's blah blah blah. And he gave a name
[1:05:27] for it or whatever. And right there in
[1:05:29] my mind, I said, "No, I refuse that. I'm
[1:05:31] not accepting that." And I was like,
[1:05:32] "Shame on me. I shouldn't have said
[1:05:34] anything." And so, um, then we got in
[1:05:38] the car and we're heading home and I
[1:05:40] said to Adeline, I was like, "I
[1:05:41] shouldn't have said anything." I was
[1:05:43] like, "My foot did hurt. It doesn't hurt
[1:05:45] anymore." And I said, "The Lord has
[1:05:49] healed my foot." And I was like, "He's
[1:05:50] given me my healing." And I said, "Um,
[1:05:54] your body um obeys the confession of
[1:05:57] your mouth." And I said, "So I said,
[1:06:00] remember that, Adeline?" I was like, "My
[1:06:02] foot is healed." And then it was only
[1:06:06] like two days later that I was talking
[1:06:08] to my mom on the phone and my foot had
[1:06:11] been hurting in the morning, but I
[1:06:12] wasn't acknowledging it. I was just
[1:06:14] saying, "Thank you, Lord, for healing
[1:06:15] me." And then as I was talking to my mom
[1:06:17] on the phone, I told her, I was like,
[1:06:19] um, mom, I have a testimony. And so I
[1:06:22] told her about my foot and everything
[1:06:23] and I said, "The Lord's healed me." And
[1:06:26] I said, as I'm talking to you on the
[1:06:28] phone right now, I was like, the pain is
[1:06:29] left and it's gone. And so I just want
[1:06:31] to thank the Lord that he's given me my
[1:06:33] healing. And not just for my foot, but
[1:06:35] for other things in my body. I just want
[1:06:36] to give the Lord praise. Thank you, God.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Praise be to God.
[1:06:40] Praise God. He's the healer. Amen.
[1:06:44] Praise be to God. And the body shall
[1:06:46] follow the confession
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; of our mouth. Yeah.
[1:07:22] Glory to God.
[1:07:27] Praise be to God.
[1:07:32] Gives you a job and he gives you a
[1:07:34] supervisor who is a message believer.
[1:07:36] You can't have better than that.
[1:07:39] Praise be to God. I wish I had one. He
[1:07:40] would allow me to go a bit on Wednesday
[1:07:42] a bit early.
[1:07:44] Praise be to God. Thank you, brother
[1:07:46] Joseph. God bless you richly. I will
[1:07:48] praise him. I will praise him. Praise
[1:07:51] the
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; praise.
[1:08:04] is the life of sinners.
[1:08:10] Oh, give
[1:08:13] in glory all the people
[1:08:20] for his blood has washed away.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; One more time. I will praise you.
[1:08:30] I will praise him.
[1:08:34] I
[1:08:36] will praise him. Oh, praise
[1:08:40] the lamb for s.
[1:08:47] Oh, give
[1:08:49] him glory.
[1:08:56] All his blood can wash away.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Let each one of us go in prayer and just
[1:09:06] praise him and thank the Lord and tell
[1:09:09] him your needs that he already knows but
[1:09:12] we thankful heart.

[1:24:25] Amen. Brother Peter, I'm going to ask
[1:24:27] you for prayer if you don't mind for
[1:24:30] prayer. If you don't pray for the
[1:24:32] congregation. Amen.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. Closing prayer.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Let's pray everyone. Heavenly Father,
[1:24:41] how sweet it has been to be in the house
[1:24:43] of God again today.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; From the worship to the word to the
[1:24:46] worship, we keep on praising you, Lord.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; You alone are worthy of all adoration
[1:24:51] and praise.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Is your blood that paid our price, your
[1:24:56] redemption, your rising from the dead,
[1:24:58] Lord, giving us new life, Lord. And as
[1:25:01] our our hearts yearn to hear the word
[1:25:03] preached and hear the prophets spoken
[1:25:06] the word that will empower us, Lord, to
[1:25:10] write to look in the right direction,
[1:25:12] Lord, to receive the right word for our
[1:25:15] day, for our needs. We thank you for
[1:25:17] every testimony here tonight, Lord.
[1:25:19] every person represented here, Lord, who
[1:25:22] has brought along the fire of God with
[1:25:24] them and who takes it with them to share
[1:25:28] and to testify that the living God is
[1:25:30] real in our lives.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; And in the preaching of the word, though
[1:25:33] foolishness to man, Lord, it is golden.
[1:25:36] It is glorious, is eternal, and it is so
[1:25:39] filling. It is so good. Lord,
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; I pray you'd strengthen our brother
[1:25:43] Moses and and everyone else who has been
[1:25:46] supporting him in prayer even during the
[1:25:48] service and those who are streaming.
[1:25:50] Lord, we pray you'd be with them and may
[1:25:52] they catch something, Lord, that will
[1:25:54] quicken their spirit, Lord, to be
[1:25:56] prepared, Lord, of your soon coming. For
[1:25:58] we know not when, any moment, any
[1:26:00] twinkling of an eye, Lord, you will come
[1:26:02] on the scene, Lord, just like you did
[1:26:04] today, Lord, in your word. You gave us a
[1:26:07] rich banquet. We've been blessed to
[1:26:09] receive the word again and we ask Lord
[1:26:11] that you'd bless everyone who's come
[1:26:13] Lord and those who couldn't make it Lord
[1:26:15] be with them. Think of the Mensas and
[1:26:18] others who would love to be here, Lord,
[1:26:20] would one reason other aren't able to,
[1:26:22] Lord, either working or whatever. But
[1:26:24] Lord, you are a rearranger of schedules,
[1:26:26] Lord.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; We also know that you bring about all
[1:26:30] things according to your purpose.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; What you have ordained, Lord, what you
[1:26:34] have foreseen and you've envisioned for
[1:26:37] us. Oh God, help us, Lord. We confess
[1:26:40] our faults. Unworthy though we are,
[1:26:42] Lord, we receive it gladly, Lord.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; This word that quickens us. We praise
[1:26:46] you. And Lord, I pray you'd go home with
[1:26:48] each believer and everyone who has been
[1:26:50] here in the house of the Lord, feeding
[1:26:52] on the word
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; and comfort them and strengthen them and
[1:26:57] give them more faith and and also
[1:27:00] concerning sister Sharifa's brother, all
[1:27:03] that matter. Lord, we lift it up and
[1:27:05] give you praise for it. Lord, we're
[1:27:08] really grateful for that and for the
[1:27:10] smallest little thing, Lord, and for the
[1:27:12] big things you do, Lord. We're really
[1:27:14] grateful, Lord. and we so love you and
[1:27:16] we ask that you keep us until we meet
[1:27:19] again. Lord be with us. We pray in Jesus
[1:27:22] lovely name. Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:27] [Applause]
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Are dismissed. See
[1:27:35] you on Sunday.
[1:27:43] [Music]
[1:28:02] Lord, we lift our hands in worship
[1:28:07] as we lift your holy
[1:28:10] You deserve the glory
[1:28:15] and the honor.
[1:28:19] Lord, we lift our hands in worship
[1:28:23] as we holy
[1:28:27] for you are great.
[1:28:30] Mira
[1:28:35] is like you.
[1:28:39] There is no one else like you. You are
[1:28:44] greater than you m so great.
[1:28:59] Thank you.
