Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you for your grace, in your mercy once again, Father, to be in your house this morning. What a privilege, Father. Lord, as we heard through the song to be one of them, one of the few people, Father, we can answer that in whom you put the ability to hear the voice of God and to answer to the voice of God to say, Lord, I'm I'm I'm I'm willing to go with you. I want to go further with you. Accept the word in my heart. Father, we thank you for that, Lord. We thank you as we heard on Wednesday that father you have opened that channel that channel where you can speak to us Lord that channel that has been open that channel of predestination the channel of election the channel Father Lord for getting ready for the rapture you made that available you have opened for us in this last age Lord we are so happy to have accepted the message to have accepted the revelation to have accepted your perfect will the perfect interpretation of the word of God. Thank you, Father Lord, to be your sheep. We love you and appreciate you, Lord. We know that we have so many needs. We are needy people, Lord. Even this morning, our desire is more of you, Lord. Our desire, Lord, is to get closer to you, Father. Our desire is to please you, Father, as we are needing more of more of the Holy Ghost, more of the outpouring of your presence in our lives, Father. Lord Jesus Christ, may you, may you come this morning. It has been prayed. May you father lead us. May you speak to our heart. May you father Lord touch our bodies, touch our mind, touch our soul, Father Lord, as we desire more of you, Lord. Thank you, Father Lord, for bringing sis our sister Agnes in the church.

Philippians chapter 2. Philippians chapter 2 12- 16. And I'll let you have a seat. Wherefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which workketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Amen. Do all things without murmurings and disputings, that you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as light in the world. &gt;&gt; Holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain. May God bless the reading of his word and give us the contact this morning and have a seat. Amen. It's my little bit like to continue on the same subject we are on on the stature of the fullness of Christ. I know that we have a little bit of a stop there of the traveling and then special meetings and and saw help from others and brother brother Gilbert and brother Victor some been a long time but I think it to be good to come back a little bit so might be hard on me a little bit to come back on the subject but we have been blessed by all those ministers &gt;&gt; and the presence of the Lord thank God for that I would like I'm on the second stage there I would like to talk a little bit on the virtue this morning and I would like to talk on the virtue and a type of a Christlike character. It's Christlike character. The Bible says again in the Ephesians 2:8, "For by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God." And then Revelation 28:11 says, "Unto the angel of the church may not write these things save the first and the last which was dead and is now alive. The main character, the main characteristic, the main attribute on the on the on the church of the Smina is the virtue is the attribute of the virtue of God as the prophet would put that as a parallel. So it has a little bit of a parallel between the age of Sina and that main characteristic or the main the main attribute of it is the virtue. Amen. Then says I'm the first and the last which was dead and is alive. Do you believe that he's still the first and the last? If he's the first and the last means before even anything happens, he knew it before it happened. &gt;&gt; And he's the last means he's the one. He has the last decision for anything that is happening in your life. God knows your first. God knows your last. Amen. He knows the beginning. He knows the end. It says, "I'm the first and the last, which was dead and is alive. I know thy works and tribulation and poverty, but but thou art rich, and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. Fear none of these things which we that shall suffer. Say, Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried, and you shall have tribulation 10 days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. He that have an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches, he that overcometh shall not be heard of the second death. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we like to go on that. The prophet in this message in this message of the simeina age on the church ages he just put so great quotes it's one of actually it's one of my favorite one of my favorite church age if we have to talk about and because he put that so many good principles so many good quotes on that as you read it's just it's just wonderful I would encourage you to go and listen to it and go and read even the church ages some wonderful wonderful wonderful quote but I think it does not only pertain to this in a church age but also pertain to every age to every believer even our time some of all the truth that will be unfolding there he says one of the things he says and I'll just read it in the beginning he says page 151 he says then he goes on not only narrow down his definition but rather finalize it for Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Jesus us and he counted the seed children as children of promise as promise as as pro and promise as having to do with the election and the choosing of God. That is exactly what we have been saying. Those who are of the royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated fornown of God and were in the mind of God and it is told. Amen. In very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season. And each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body. That's this bridge, this br this bride. Sorry. That's this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride. You are the spoken word seed bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. And said though she's feminine in destination, she's also called the body of Christ. It's very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifested God in many membered body &gt;&gt; if you were in God you can never be lost if you were if in God's mind you can never be lost you have been predestinated nothing can hinder you from making it amen says you came from the same source as go Jesus Christ came from the same source. He was eternal with him. So if Jesus is eternal, you are eternal too. &gt;&gt; So they are now manifested God in a many membered body whereas God whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ. So he said then he goes he continues says now as the eternal logos god was manifest in the son and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodly and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh thereby gain the title son even so we eternal in his thought in our on our turn became the many membered spoken word seed amenifed in flesh and those eternal thought now manifest in flesh are the sons of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could have that revelation that we came from God, therefore we have no other destination but going back to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, it will help us in our work. &gt;&gt; It says now even as we are so-called, we did not become seed by the rebirth. We were seed and therefore were reborn. For only the elect can be reborn. &gt;&gt; You cannot ask any other person if he was not elect to be reborn. Only the elect in this age can be reborn because only the elect has that predestinated seed inside of them. Amen. We have heard it many times. But may God make it more and more real in our lives. &gt;&gt; No. So that's why sometimes even the message can be hard. The message can be hard but it's it's hard not to not not to tell you that you can't make it. It's hard to tell you that you are a s you have been formed to it. Amen. It's calling you to come to the level where you have been for then to it. Amen. The devil want to put us down but we have to go higher. Amen. As we heard on on on Wednesday there. So even the channel has already been open. We just need to go to the to to the level where God wants us to be &gt;&gt; says now because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened &gt;&gt; in non seed. There is nothing to quicken. Right. &gt;&gt; There's nothing to pick any nonseed. You can't you can't find, you know, sometimes they have a fake seed, you know, for decoration. It looks like a seed. It's very nice. Sometimes shine more shining than a real seed, but there's not no life inside of it. You can bury it and 10 years is still the same. 20 years is still the same. It's coming to church and there's nothing because it's not a seed, but the seed of God. Amen. Oh, praise be to God. It might take many, many, many days, many years, but if the life is there, it's going to come forth no matter what. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Says all this, it says all this carefully in mind. Now take the next step. Redeem means to pay to buy back to restore to the original owner. So redeeming does not mean you go and find something that is not yours. No, redeeming means it's something that was yours, it was lost and then you go and take it back again. &gt;&gt; So oh it belongs to me now. Yeah, it belonged to you before it was lost. Now you redeem it back. &gt;&gt; That redemption is only for the elect. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes hard to say those things but you are we are mature Christians. &gt;&gt; Redemption is only for the elect. You know someone asked I think someone sent me or I read that someone they ask no why you say that why you always say those who those who can be saved are only the elect you you are disqualifying some people no you're not disqualifying people we're actually qualifying people &gt;&gt; amen if you are an elect you say oh I believe the word of God it's open to everybody amen so you're not disqualifying anybody amen it's still the word of God I don't want to lose my place there says It restore the original honor. God by his death in the shed blood bought back his own. He brought back the spoken word seed bride. My sheep hear my voice and they follow me. You always wear a sheep. You never wear a pig or dog turn into a sheep. We are not trying to turn. The message is not trying to turn a pig into a sheep. No, you were already a sheep. The message comes to reveal to you that you are a sheep. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is not trying to make you take to take the character of a sheep if you are not a sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where I'm going. Christlike character. You're not trying to Christlike character cannot can only be in those who have been sheep from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Christlike character cannot be on a pig. &gt;&gt; A pig will try to be like Christ but will never be like Christ. You will put on try to make it but after a while you will once you see a little bit of mud. Oh I still feel it empty. You will go back to the mud. After a while you will go back to the mud. You're trying to put Christ character upon him. It won't work. &gt;&gt; But the character that we need on the ship he has to start from the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're always a sheep. that is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there is no change in specy. If you were in the thought of God and then expressed in flesh, there had to come a day when we will hear his voice. The prophet says his word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are the sons of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's about recognizing. And the message is about recognizing. Recognizing your time, recognizing who you are, recognizing that you are a mature child. Amen. It's about recognizing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give me a little bit of volume. Looks like I'm shouting. Please. So we heard we heard his voice and cried out as did the prodical son save me oh my father I'm returning to thee a son of God can go a long time before he recognizes that he is a son before he recognizes he's a son then we tell about the story of the eagle you see you always an eagle he acted like a chicken for a while while he was while but but he could not be satisfied. None of the world can satisfy you. Once you're a son of God, you being special when you are born again. You recognize who you are. Nothing can satisfy you of the world. &gt;&gt; You can actually we can actually say no go try things in the world but you'll never be satisfied. &gt;&gt; If you are really son of God, you'll never be satisfied. You go there, there's still something missing. No, that's not my place. That's not my place. until you come back recognize like the prodical son and the brother put it so well the prodical son he was there but he realized that what am I doing here I have to go back to my father I have to go back to my place because as a son of god you can never be satisfied by the things of the world you see he always he act like a chicken for a while but he could not be satisfied when he heard the call of the great eagle he came to his own place once a true son of god hears the cry of the spirit by the word, he too will realize who he is and one to the great prophet eagle and be with him forever seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says, "Now comes our triumphal capstone on the baptism with the Holy Ghost. When the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his son." Galatians 4 4:7 made of woman made under the law to redeem their that was under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart crying aba father why are you born again it's because you are sons amen &gt;&gt; the holy ghost does not make you sons and daughters of god the holy ghost comes to confirm that you are sons and daughters of god Because you can only the seed of God can be reborn. Only the seed of God has something that can be quickened. Amen. So because you are sons, God has sent the spirit upon you that's crying aba father. &gt;&gt; So the Christlike character can only be on those who are sheep from the beginning. &gt;&gt; You cannot have Christ character on something else but those who have been from the beginning. Amen. So if you go in in Psalm 2023 that we all know by heart is a relationship between the shepherd and the sheep. The shepherd and the sheep. The sheep the shepherd takes care of everything. The sheep just has to be willing to follow what the shepherd is doing. That's what we are. We have to follow what the shepherd is doing in the time that you are living in. I want to put that as a a foundation. But I want to put go a little further. There is there is there there is a side there is a there is a there is a there there is a side to that that the prophet put in the same message and I just want to put the emphasis you all know it but just good to repeat that and for the sake of of continuity of the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says character is a victory. &gt;&gt; Character is not a gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Character is a victory. &gt;&gt; Character is not a gift. That's wonderful because we have the potential but that potential that is inside of you if you don't let it operate it stays dormant. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You need to let that potential to be manifested. So there is part that is a gift but for in order for it to be manifest in the fullness there is a part where you have to cooperate with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many have been there? There's a part where you have to cooperate with God. Character is not is not a victory. A character is a victory. Rather, character is a victory is not a gift. Is not something that is given to you in the full maturity to you. No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A child that is born has the potential him. You cannot ask a child. You cannot you cannot like I said the beginning you cannot ask a pig to manifest the character of of a sheep. It cannot be manifested but the sheep has to grow for that character to be manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The dictionary says character is the moral spiritual quality formed within a person through choices and trials and disciplines and obedience. So character should be I'll say the character should be the foundation of authority. As the prophet will say here a character is not a character is not a gift. A character a character is not a gift. A character is a victory without character. A man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But power with character is fit to rule. Without character, the power will corrupt the person. &gt;&gt; If you have the power and you don't have the character, the power that you have actually is not helping you. &gt;&gt; The character the power that you have without the character might you bring it further from God than should draw you closer to God. &gt;&gt; So in order to have the real power, you should have first the real character. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because power corrupts &gt;&gt; like it corrupted soul. It corrected Amen. As we saw that last time, he corrected soul. Soul had the power but didn't have the character. That's why he misused that power. Amen. Misuse that power. Amen. But if you really have power and and you have real character, the power should bring you become a servant. Real power should make you a servant. If you have the real character. &gt;&gt; That's right. If you have the real character, the position of authority, your position of power should make you a servant for others. Like Joseph had the power. He had the power, but God had to make him go through some training of his character to the point with his power, he was a servant to others. He was a servant to save life to others. He was a servant even to give life to his to his brothers, to his brothers, to his family, to Israel. Why? Because he had the right character. Amen. Character makes you a servant. Character makes the power. Power with character makes you a servant for others. Amen. &gt;&gt; See Daniel, he had the power by the power that he had. True character make him a servant to others. Amen. We saw with Mori the power that he had but with a good character the power makes him a servant to others. Amen. The prophet says Jesus counts character. He does not count members. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we want more members but God wants more character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want members with character. Amen. He says you know that he counts character. God always try to get one man in his hand. &gt;&gt; Oh, I pray that I'm that man. I pray that is your desire too. God, I want to be that man. I want to be that woman. God always try to get one man in his hand. That's all he needs is is one man and he will do his work through that that you and he'll do his work through the years. Jim, he could only find one righteous man in the time of Noah. In the time of Moses, you only find one righteous man. In the time of Samson, he find just one righteous man, Samson. But remember, Samson had a gift. &gt;&gt; But didn't have the character. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because with his gift, even though he had a gift, he still failed. But when he realized that he had to depend on God, that his character had to be molded. And so what is character? That's a good question. What is character? I think the main thing how we can define character is to be willing to follow God's word no matter what. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Willing to follow God no matter what. Willing to die to ourel. Willing to deny yourself. Willing to put your ambitions away and just follow God's will. Amen. &gt;&gt; If if you come to that level, God, no matter who in which status I am, no matter you you are born again, but you know, you you be born again, but you might not have the real character to follow the word of God all the time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says Peter had a sword. He pulled that sword going to cut the high priest ears off and things like that and did it. But when he come to real Christian carriage, he didn't have it. He backed up and denied him. Is that right? He could cut the high priest here off his his sword shoe. He know how to handle it. He had the gift how to handle it but didn't have the character in the time of pressure. Says when he come to the squeeze and time to stand on the word of God, he didn't have the character and even denied he know Jesus Christ. Proverb says he didn't have the Holy Ghost. He didn't have the personal experience. Yes, he didn't have the Holy Ghost, but I would say he didn't have also the character to stand with the word of God. God doesn't measure success by crowds, by numbers, organization. As the prophet was saying this morning in the tape, impersonations says God wants the quality of Christlike character as an individual. &gt;&gt; God, may you give us that character &gt;&gt; and may you help us to grow in that character of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; One man in his hand is all he needs to fulfill his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God looks at the heart, not numbers or outward strength. Samson Samson Samuel at one time he went to anoint the people and the children of of of is the name I forgot of Oed. As he came there and he wanted to he wanted to anoint them. He was looking at the other statue. He was looking at how big they look. But God says, "No, I have my servant. He has the character that I want. He's man after my heart. He's a man after my heart." Because he will put he will put his ambition away and follow God's word as the word would would want to say. Amen. That's what God desire. God wants a man with real character. &gt;&gt; Real character isn't proven in good times. &gt;&gt; In good times, everybody's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. In good times, everybody's good. But in the time of pressure, in the time of squeeze, that's when you'll see the real person. That's when you see the real character. &gt;&gt; That's when you see if you can stand with the word of God or not. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is looking for character. Elzo when he went to get the bride of Isaac, he sweat it out until he found character. &gt;&gt; Remember Abraham put him responsible. As God put us responsible, we ministers to hunt hunt the bride. God bless your heart. Prophet says it isn't looking for members. I'm looking for the pure in heart. Somebody that will believe the word. Elzo looked and he thought, "Oh, I can't do this myself. There is too much responsibility." I realized this responsibility of finding Isaac which is the type of the church you know Christ Rebecca the type of the brideza got down on his knees and said God you just have to help me in this time where he was sent Baram had the same commission to look for the bride and barbwam look for the bride but he realized he could look he could not he could not count on his own ability he was a seventh grade he had a seventh grade education he could say no but but God, I can't speak properly. I I don't I don't I don't have that potential. I I don't have the potential. I'm not educated. I'm not a good preacher. All the different things. God had to respond, it's not it's not your problem. &gt;&gt; It's it's my problem. &gt;&gt; I've called you to do the work, but I will look for the bride. &gt;&gt; God will search for the bride. Amen. God was searching for you. God was searching for me. As as Elza went there, Elza did not choose Rebecca by by by the look. He had to rely on God. God, I realize that it's my responsibility, but I cannot depend on the look. I cannot depend on the outside. I have to depend on you intervening supernaturally. God calling you is not a man calling you. &gt;&gt; This is the bride calling you. Amen. The bridegroom calling you. Amen. Is the bride being called by himself. Amen. The angel of the Lord was already there. He knew when to send Rebecca on time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about it. From all the virgin woman to come on that well, he knew when that one had to come at that specific time. &gt;&gt; As he was still praying, he saw her coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw her because the angel of the Lord had had to had to had to put an inspiration to go at the right time. &gt;&gt; I like what brother Gibbert said. They say, you know, when the prodical son went there, it was the angel of the Lord dealing with the prodical son. &gt;&gt; It was not the father dealing with the prodical son. The angel had to deal with the prodical son to bring him back. &gt;&gt; The same thing for you. It was God calling you. Amen. Not a man calling you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, when you predestination is just wonderful. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Elazar got on his knees and said, "God, you just have to help me." When he referred to God, God helped him. He got character. Come back to the word, brother. Come back to God. God, don't pay any attention to this church you belong to. You can stay there if you want to. If they let you, but the thing to do is first come to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. that when Eleazar found the character that was in the woman Rebecca, that beautiful bride of Isaac. He told her about Isaac. She never questioned one thing, she believed the word of the messenger and she made ready to go. That's the real character. You don't have to question anything about God. When the word of God says one thing, you say amen. &gt;&gt; You believe. You might not understand, but just say amen. &gt;&gt; If the prophet said it, I just say amen. I've seen the supernatural. She had to see the supernatural. She realized that no from all the women God has sent her only to her and she did something that the prophet ask her that the prophet did not ask her to do. He asked her only give me drink some drink. But herself by divine predestination she had that desire to even give drink to the cameras. Amen. something extra that the prophet had caught in his in his mind and kept it for himself but didn't express it but she did the extra of what the prophet asked her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know that you are doing the extra what God asked you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Can You come at the point sometimes the prophet doesn't say um and is is a bit asking are you Malachi 4? Are you the prophet of Malachi 4? He's kind of hesitating on what to say about it but you could pick it up said no &gt;&gt; you cannot have any other prophet fulfilling Malachi 4 than this prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are picking up something that is not even written that is not even said clearly but you can pick up this is nothing else but the prophet that was promised in Malachi 4. You are going beyond what has been told to you. Amen. Because you have the same character as Rebecca had the same character. Something that is not told told you but you can pick it up. Amen. Wonderful God. Wonderful God that God can give us a desire to do his perfect will even though not completely expressed as we can say. And she went and asked the father and said just the prophet continue the quote said they went and asked the father and said just ask her the damsels of age asked her let her decision be and she said I will go. &gt;&gt; The character says I will go. She said I will go to what? A man she had never seen knowing nothing about. You have not seen God. You not seen Jesus Christ physically, but you still accept what he's telling you. And your desire is Elzo, tell me more. &gt;&gt; Elzo, tell me more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell me more about my husband. Tell me what he likes. I don't want to compromise on anything that he wants. I want to follow everything that Elazot is telling me. Amen. Because Eleazar knows the mind of the husband. Elzar knows the mind of Isaac. Elzo is is telling him telling her the details that herself could not know. But Elzo has been has been with with Isaac. He knows what Isaac likes. Amen. A prophet is in connection with God. He has no thought of himself. He's expressing the thought of God to the bride. &gt;&gt; And we are willing to accept anything that the message says. &gt;&gt; That's the real character of the bride is to accept anything that the prophet says. I might not understand it but I agree with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet says and continue about Rebecca says as soon as she had made to her quickly her mind was made up she said I will go and she mounted upon the camel went to meet the very camel she watered was the camel that packed her to a bridegroom and owned her success. The very camel, the very power of that beast in the Bible represent power. The very power that we give water and praise to water life praise to to the word is the very thing that packs us into the glory land to meet the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; What is it? The same word of God that you are feeding on is giving power to the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost feeds upon the word of God. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost does not feed upon fables. that don't feed about documentaries that don't feed about you know geography thing the Holy Ghost feeds upon the word of God &gt;&gt; as the bride of Christ having Christ character we must feed the Holy Ghost inside of us &gt;&gt; it's it it's it's an encouragement you have to listen to the word of God you have to read the Bible every day you have to listen to the tape you have to come to church if you want to make it for the rapture you have you you have to do those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are predestinated to it, but you have to do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Predestination does not mean, oh, whenever it comes, it will come. &gt;&gt; No. Predestination means you recognize that it belongs to me. It's my responsibility. I have to do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Rebecca, she recognized, oh, I am I am the bride. I have been chosen. God chose me. It's not this man who chose me. He had he made a prayer. I recognize who I am. Now I'm I have to go. Father, don't hinder me. &gt;&gt; Oh no, we try to hinder you. Can you stay one more time? Can you know enjoy this? Can you? No, that I don't have that time. No, that's not I don't have that time. I'm already been selected. I already been predestinated. I already been chosen by God. The choosing of the bride. He already chose me. So I will go. I'm not spending time here. I'm going. &gt;&gt; That Christlike character. You feed the Holy Ghost with with the word of God. With the praise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise. Yes. Praise to the word of God. The devil will come sometime through trials and trying to put you down. You praise the Lord. Lord, I praise you. I praise your word. And you are the healer. You are the comforter. You are the savior. Lord, you will never be defeated. I praise you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The more you feed the Holy Ghost, the more it has more power inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Very good principle there. I don't think this is my note. I don't think Rebecca Rebecca had the gift of giving water to camels. So, oh, she has a wonderful gift of giving water. That was not a gift. The gift was she had that desire. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the gift. It was given to God. She had that desire. But the other part, she had to do it. &gt;&gt; That's the character. So now I have that desire. Now I'm doing it. It was not an easy thing. You give a cup the camels and that it. No, you have to. A camel takes a lot. One brother put that in calculation that I to find. They drink a lot. They drink a lot. So she was putting one camel. One camel. One. So no, no, no, no. I'm safe. Ah, I'll stay home and everything and that's everything is fine. No, God is predestinated me. Hallelujah. Amen. No, no, no. You come to church on winter is coming soon. We will see the real Christian. I know today snow check there. Oh, I check the weather. No, no. Brother Andrew will take care of stream. God give me that Christlike character. I'm predestinated, but I'm going to feed the Holy Ghost with the water. Amen. With the food. Amen. &gt;&gt; Christlike character. Go into action like Rebecca. I will do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many me there? To one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge, by the same spirit, to another faith by the same spirit, to another gift of healing by the same spirit, to another working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirit, to another diverse kind of tongues. To another the interpretation of tongues. None of these are about reading, hearing, and listening to the word of God. Those actions of reading, hearing, listening are not spiritual gift but are basic responsibilities and disciplines for every believer. &gt;&gt; Because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. You have been predestinated to have the eternal faith, the faith, the perfect faith of God. But you need to be hearing to the word of God. Amen. Because that faith need to be increased by reading the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; As a pastor of the church, I'm encouraging each believer to be strong in listening to the tape, in praying. Amen. That's what will make the church strong. That's what will make the ministers to recognize whether this is from God or this not from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A church has to be strong to recognize no this is I will check on the ministers. Why did you say that? Bam. Never say that. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; How would you know that? If you don't listen to it, &gt;&gt; you just taking everything, taking everything, taking everything. Hallelujah. Hey, hey, hey. No, you need to know. No, this is not I've never heard that. &gt;&gt; The pastor will check, you know, it was a sleep of the time. I'm sorry. I will apologize. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The minister know I went there. Maybe I said I didn't know I didn't mean to say that because you have to be responsible what you are eating too. Amen. We need to be strong. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Rebecca was watering the power of the virtue feeding the Holy Ghost with the water following the pr following this principle. What we water is what is going to carry us. Galatians 6:7 says, "Be not deceived. God is not mocked. For whatsoever man seweth, that shall he also reap. For he that sweth to the flesh shall shall of the flesh reap corruption. But he that sweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting. &gt;&gt; If you sow the word of God in you, if you you are in the atmosphere of prayer and if you stay in that channel as we heard on Sunday on Wednesday, if you stay in that channel, God is going to bless you. God is bound to honor his own word. Amen. But you have to stay in that channel. Amen. It has already been opened. We have to stay in that channel. By God's grace has been open to some people. It's not open. They will never see it. But by God's grace, it has been open to us. We need to grow in that channel. Amen. We need to sow to the spirit. Amen. With the word of God. Amen. Feeding with the word of God. The Holy Spirit. Feeding with the word of God. That's what becomes strong. Rebecca did not delay, question, negotiate. She believed and prepared. As Revelation 19:78 said, "The marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be a red in fine linen, clean and white, for the fine fine linen is the righteousness of saints." Yes, it has been granted for her the robe, the word of God. Babam had the ministry as Elzar to to to to dress us with that robe. He gave us that robe, the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He gave us that word of God. But now it's us. We have to make oursel ready applying the word of God. Now &gt;&gt; I need to apply the word of God. Sometimes you say, "Oh, no. Can you get rid of this? Can you?" But says, "No, you have to be willing to do it." &gt;&gt; That's what my emphasis this morning. If I if some you can think you can go with it this morning is God make me willing &gt;&gt; to do your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just make me willing. &gt;&gt; Amen. The problem is sometime comes we are not willing enough. &gt;&gt; We think about the next step. If I do this my wife is not going to love me. If I do this my husband is going to love me. If I do this my my teacher or we we are not willing to give in. &gt;&gt; Don't think of what the consequences. Be willing to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet says now we know that there is going to be a bride and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies. marriage of the lamb that just as sure as to be as God is because that his word. We know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church and are going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle. They have the material on earth now to make themselves ready. We have the word of God to make ourselves ready. We can't make oursel ready with the doctrine and creeds of Pentecostals and and and and and other denominations. We have the pure word of God to make ourel ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you notice he said she has made herself ready. So many says if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling, from lying or stealing, I will serve him. The prophet put the balance there. Of course, God has to do that. And thank God it's him doing that because if you force yourself to do it, you'll fall back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That that's why the psychiatrist and all the people, they fail because they're trying to put things you have to do. But the prophet goes and says, he put a balance to that. Says, but it's also up to you. You've got to do something too. &gt;&gt; They that overcome shall inherit all things. They that overcome, you have power to do it, &gt;&gt; but you must be willing to lay down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think that's a problem. We must be willing to lay down. She has made herself ready. I liked that word. God could not push us through a little pipe, pull us out of the other hand and then say, "Blessed is he that overcometh." &gt;&gt; He put you here and draw. Oh, you are an overcomer. Oh, wonderful. You overcame. No, God gives you the anointing for the age. &gt;&gt; How you can use that and give them if you allow that anointing to use you, that anointing is going to overcome. Amen. But yourself, you have to be willing. Lord, I accept the anointing of the age. I accept the eagle anointing for the age as in the similar age they had to accept that the anointing of God the same in our time we accept the anointing of God and we'll be overcomers. Amen. But you have to be willing. Amen. &gt;&gt; God will not push us through a little pipe puts us out on the other hand and then say blessed is he that overcometh. You had nothing to overcome. He just pushed you through. You've got to make decisions for yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why character comes. &gt;&gt; You have to make decisions. Oh, I know the word of God says this. So now in this situation, what shall I do? When the preacher is not there, when the deacon is not there, when the parents are not there, when when the one who testify to you the message the first time is not there, now you have to make a decisions. &gt;&gt; That's where character comes. and you say, "Lord, I'm taking your word because it's not about others. It's my own decisions. I'm taking the word of God and I move forward." &gt;&gt; Amen. If you do that all the time, God says, "Oh, he has the character." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In doing that we show our faith and respect respect to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the message says the close is that fact the God deals with Israel only when she's in homeland. &gt;&gt; When Abraham left the homeland and went down into Egypt, what happened? He walked away from the will of God and never was blessed till he returned back to the homeland. &gt;&gt; Was not Abraham predestinated for the homeland? Oh yes, he was predestinated from the homeland. But in the statues of virtue there, God is saying, you know, Abraham, you know, for you for the blessing to be applied upon you, you have to come back into homeland. You have to come back in the homeland. That's where my blessing is. You have to come back into homeland. outside of homeland my covenant yes it stands but it doesn't express itself in the fullness you have to come in the homeland amen go never dealt with him not one vision not nothing else till he come back to the homeland they say look at Israel when they were sent down in Egypt 400 years not one miracle not one sign not one thing happened among them not record in the history of the book God never did deal with Israel till she come to her homeland. &gt;&gt; Then prophet says, "Hear me." Thus sayith the Lord. God will not deal with his church till she comes back to the homeland. The message of the hour. &gt;&gt; So what is our homeland is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Thank God we are back to our homeland. &gt;&gt; Thank God we want to stay in our homeland. &gt;&gt; That's why the blessing is here. The blessing of healing is in our homeland. And in that homeland, you know, you can borrow yourself to that homeland to just, oh, this is just my corner. I stay in that corner. No, in this homeland, the homeland belongs to us. Amen. Healing belongs to us. The joy of salvation belongs to us. The salvation of our children belongs to us. In this homeland, we have all inheritance. Amen. &gt;&gt; You just nailed and you you cast out all those demons. Amen. The giant are in the land. But we have to go in the land and possess our land. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Caleb was in the homeland. He was He could have stayed the way he could stay. He was in the homeland. Just I have a small portion here. I'm saved. I'm That's all it's good for me. I'm saved. I'm in the homeland. But one day he had a revelation. You know what? I'm in the homeland. But I see a big mountain that belongs to me there. &gt;&gt; That big mountain belongs to me and belongs to my children. I see the giant on on those mountain. Holy Ghost Joshua, you are the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost, give me my mountain. &gt;&gt; I'm not resting until I give me my mountain. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost says, "Oh, if you want that mountain, yeah, go and possess that mountain." And he had to fight for every inch of that mountain. And he possessed the mountain. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of in this homeland, the message of the hour, let me encourage you this morning, you can possess it this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the promise of God, the blessings upon the seed of Abraham, the seed of Abraham shall possess all the gates of the enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Vers God give Israel the promised land while they were still in Egypt they had to fight every inch of that land. God told Joshua and Joshua one wherever the souls of your food treads upon that I give you for a possession. So footprints mean footprints means possession. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people can just get just barely to the edge of the land. &gt;&gt; Some can take the twohanded sword and cut their way through Philistines and Amorite till they get the whole thing. That what we should do. Amen. Every promise is to us. &gt;&gt; Footprint is possession. &gt;&gt; Walk right up and take it. God give it to us. It's a promise and that a truth and it's for us. &gt;&gt; Footprint is possession. Whatever you are possessing, don't let it go. &gt;&gt; You stay there. It belongs to me. &gt;&gt; I'm not letting it go. Amen. It It's my possession. It's my inheritance. I'm not going to let the devil try to rob me from my possession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, time is going so fast before I even went into my Now don't be discouraged. You might hear me preach the message of prophecy. You might see the Holy Spirit discern and do great things and perform miracles. Sometimes you might pray and it will never come to pass right away. Says go on, your reward comes at the end. Wouldn't that be better right there? Do Jesus a service. The end time message, he had a bride. God's looking for character. Then after Lazar found the character, then the next thing was getting her ready to go. That the same now, brother. The same now. The end time message is not out yonder in Babylon. But I want to say this. Prophet says sometimes we pray wrong. Says when you pray, you do what do you pray? Says ask for so and so certain things. I didn't get it. He's talking about that person, you know, he prayed and didn't get in and says, you know what, I don't believe in the Bible anymore. Says, you know, you're praying wrong. &gt;&gt; He says, I said, you pray wrong. You should never pray to change God's mind. &gt;&gt; We should pray to change our mind. &gt;&gt; God's mind don't need any changing. &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's where we fail. Oh, I did that. I pray, I pray, I didn't see it happen right away. Then, oh no, that then you get discouraged. The enemy comes and God doesn't hear your prayer and this message is not the truth because this this this or this this this sometimes we put too much on I will make you a millionaire once become a Christians and the person doesn't become a millionaire no put in the wrong place &gt;&gt; but says no the real Christian like character is not to change to change your mind to fit me but it's me to be changed to fit your mind &gt;&gt; as you grow, realize, Lord, I want your perfect will to be done. &gt;&gt; I'm willing to lose everything, but your perfect will to be done cuz I want your perfect will to be done. Amen. Says, "God minds does not need any change." He says, "Now when you pray, I know a young Catholic boy one time had the prayer talking. Prayer should be Lord change me to fit your word not change not change not let me change your mind you change my mind you change my mind to your will and your will is written here in the book amen &gt;&gt; and the pro the prophet says he goes even deeper say there's a certain person said to me said I believe you are an antichrist brother said yes if that will be pleasing to my lord that's what I want to be &gt;&gt; I want to be whatever he wants me to be I love him. If I should cast if he should cast me into hell, I will still love him. &gt;&gt; If I go with the same spirit I have now, he looked at me of strange. What kind of person that is willing to accept anything that God want? &gt;&gt; That's another level of a Christian. &gt;&gt; That one who comes to the full maturity. He loves God so much that it's not it's not anything that God can say. Oh no. No. Everything that God says I say is amen Lord. Sometimes the nos of God as better than yes. &gt;&gt; The nos is as good as the yes. But it's not my will, it's your will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know that Jesus Christ as a man, he had to go through that process too? He had to go to that process where he had to realize oh first time he said, "Oh God, can you would is it possible to remove the cap and get money?" &gt;&gt; The prophet say he died more and he gets money than at the cross. &gt;&gt; We should not skip getting money. No, &gt;&gt; Gimman is where we die to our own will. &gt;&gt; The problem is our own will. We don't like to go through Gethsemane. We want to go to the end result. We want to go to the resurrection. &gt;&gt; But before resurrection, you have to go to Gethsemane. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said not Lord is it possible to take the cup away? Is it possible? &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's where he had the greatest victory. The greatest victory is when it was not his will anymore. It's God's will that I had to pray a minute. Excuse me. I want to leave if you be pleased. Whatever check your objective and motive by that you know where your love of God whether you love God or not. Sometimes the Lord want to encourage someone this morning. I would say don't let suffering be a stumbling block in your Christian walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Certain things that suffering will bring a Christian to reject God's word. He knows it's a tool &gt;&gt; suffering &gt;&gt; and he you know we know the story of Job, right? &gt;&gt; He knew he know the human human being so well. He knows that most of the people most of the people suffering will make them reject God. &gt;&gt; Trials will make them reject God. on already on Wednesday. Devil is trying to disturb my throat here, but &gt;&gt; I'm pressing on. &gt;&gt; The devil likes to He knows you put the seed there. The main thing is put the pressure of the world. The pressure thing to try to remove that seed. &gt;&gt; He knows. He knows how it works. But let me encourage you this morning. Don't let suffering be a stumbling block in your Christian work. &gt;&gt; Amen. But let God give us the willing or the character say God whatever you want I want to go with rejoicing on your promises praising you on your promises because your perfect will in my life is the best will &gt;&gt; I had to made a choice that that's where you find the victory in love divine says you made a choice a a difficult choice &gt;&gt; most of people would have taken the easiest choice the easiest easest way, the easiest way, but you chose the hardest way. &gt;&gt; Thank God it's my way. &gt;&gt; That's what we desire. God, let me take your way. &gt;&gt; No matter how hard it is, give me the character of Christ to take your way to make the decision to take your way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm predestinated to it. I know by God's grace I'm going to overcome. But in the hard time where the trials and difficult times, help me to take your way, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I will have the victory. Amen. And the devil won't have any place who will try to make you turn the word of God. &gt;&gt; There are two things in this laia. I'm coming to my closing on my message. Two things in Laia here. The devil will use the hard way and some people will fall in the hard way. It's hard. No, it's hard. Oh, the message is hard. Oh, I can't stand in my family. Oh, this thing it becames hard but keep pressing on &gt;&gt; God's character. Amen. &gt;&gt; The other way you'll make things so easy that you feel like I don't need God. &gt;&gt; It's with my own strength. I can have a work. I can have this. I can handle things on my own. Why do I need let let others take care of that? I'm I'm independent. and you'll miss your position. &gt;&gt; But the Christian like character is in the middle. Lord, whether suffering, whether it's easy, I want to take the right decision &gt;&gt; to follow you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the time of Smina, it was a very difficult time. It's a difficult age. Smina, a very difficult age. Very difficult age. They went through God himself saying, "I I know your tribulation. I know your work. I know your tribulation." He knew that they will go through suffering. He knew that. But look at it. It was one of the best age that God had to was proud of. Even though you're going to those sufferings, I know your works. I value what you are doing. I value your perseverance. &gt;&gt; But look at this. They have everything. rich, need of nothing and everything. And it was the the age God hates the most. Almost no no praise to that age. Says, "You have need of nothing. You are lukewarm. You think you are independent. You can do everything by yourself. I'm about to spew out because you even rejected me. You put me out. You can do everything by yourself." Amen. But the other age was suffering and everything. God says, "Oh, I'm so proud of that age. Oh God, help us to have the right character. &gt;&gt; Love this. He has no character. They want everything easy. That's why we have so we want every instantaneous reward. Instantaneous reward. We we lack impatience. You know you you want you see the driving people are so impatient. You see when you go fast food you just want it right away. You know I want instantaneous result. I want I you know if I if I if I if I go to if I believe or if I'm a church believer I want instantaneous result I want no God give me your character if it's now it's now if it's long it's long and make me patient &gt;&gt; I think that that's a great virtue &gt;&gt; to have that character &gt;&gt; prophet says I know there he was walking in the midst of his people there is the chief shepherd of of the flock. He does. He does. But does he hold back the persecution? Does he stem the tribulation? No, he does not. He simply says, "I know your tribulation. I'm not at all unmindful of your suffering." Encouragement this morning. &gt;&gt; Whatever you're going through, God is not unmindful of his suffering. He knows what you're going through. &gt;&gt; What a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel. They wonder if God really loved them. How can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer? This is what they ask in Malachi 1:13. The burden of the word of God is by Israel to Malachi. I've loved you and said the Lord. Yet where is thou loved us? What was Esau Jacob's brother? The Lord is reply. Yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid this mountain west for the dragons of the wilderness. They could not figure out God's love. They thought that the love meant no suffering. They thought that the love meant a baby with parental care. But God say that his love was elective love. &gt;&gt; The proof of his love is election. That no matter what happened, his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God has chosen you to salvation through sanctification the spirit and belief of the truth. He may commit you to death as he did Paul. He may commit you suffering as he did Jo. That is prerogative. He's sovereign. But this is all with a purpose. This is the key. If he did not have a purpose, then would be the order of frustration and not of peace. His purpose is that we have suffered a while that will be made perfect, be established, strengthened, and settled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's actually, it says, you see, he himself suffered. He learned obedience by the things that he suffered. He was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered. Though the Bible says in Hebrews 5, though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered, and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obeyed him. In plain language, the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is God, but God has to become man. As I explained many times, he had to become man. follow the process of a man until he comes to the full maturity. Jesus is God. God knows everything. But Jesus as a man didn't know everything. He knew everything that God want him to know. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he says no. The day of a coming only the father knows. So he put himself in the statute where he had to live like a man. Amen. But himself being God, he has to humble himself to live like a man. He had to go through his character to accept to go through some suffering in order for that character to come to the full maturity because it's not a gift is a victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think the greatest place where he showed that character he knew what will happen in Gethsemane. He accepted but the cross he manifested. God forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; While they're spitting on him, God forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; As a bride, we make too many things. You might hear things, you might think, but God, give me that heart that can always forgive. &gt;&gt; As a human being, we might not be able to forgive. Right? You still have that hing, but are you willing to forgive? That's the question. Are you willing to forgive? If you are willing to forgive, God will give you that forgiven given spirit in your heart. Lord, I'm willing to forgive. I'm willing to forgive. I'm willing to humble myself. I'm willing to submit myself. Lord, you will take care of the rest. Because you are the great shepherd. He's not unmindful of our suffering. He knows what we are going through, but he has a purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can love the Lord? Say, "Lord, I just want to be willing to what you want in my life and get me to have the right attitude all the time. The right attitude that I express to you is being joyful all the time. Being joyful is in the midst of trials, in the midst of difficult times. Says I have to show I have to show my attitude of being grateful to God no matter what. That's where the victory is. That's what Job had the victory. He went through suffering but oh I worship the Lord. I praise the Lord. I don't understand everything but I will praise him because he's worthy to be praised. He's my savior. He's my healer. Oh, he is doing everything perfect. Not all things works for good for the children of God. He's in control of every situation. As a child of God, I just willing to accept what God's will is and praise him in all situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians can come. Thank you. As they're coming, I'll read this quote. The prophet says there is no the special conditions mean I must be applied to every age. There's no age free from it. There is no true believer free from it. This is of God. This is the will of God. This is needful. We need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are we are to suffer and be Christlike in doing it. Love suffereth long and is kind. It says the cloudy skies and stormy storms of life are no signs of God disapproval. Neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval. You see all the two name the two sometimes you look at oh no God is not with me. Yeah God is still with you even there. Amen. Sometimes you look in here oh everything is fine. It means God is with me. No no no. So the cloud neither is brighten but his approvals of any of us is only in the beloved. &gt;&gt; His love is elective. which he had for us before the foundation of the world. Does he love us? Oh yes. But how shall we know? We shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us. So for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit blessing us as sons. How shall I prove my love to him? by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy &gt;&gt; with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Oh God, may you help us to come that level. &gt;&gt; I'm not promoting suffering or that we we have miserable life. That's not what I'm promoting. But I'm saying if God allows something to happen, don't let it be a stumbling block in your walk. &gt;&gt; Rejoice even in that situation. And if God blesses you so much, you know, don't go to the extreme says, "No, because he's blessing me all is well." No, still Lord, check me that I'm keep the right balance to walk with you with a Christlike character because God wants to develop a Christlike character in us. Amen. How many believe that this evening? Which song are you singing? Oh, love of God. Yeah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together and sing it. [Music] Oh, the highest God and riches to him. The lowest heaven guilty. All that we've &gt;&gt; God gave his son. Oh to win his child he reconile and pardon from his [Music] oh love of God all rich and pure [Music] Oh, the love of God in our life is elective love and he loved you no matter the circumstances. He cares for you. Amen. Angel [Music] is of th shall pass away and earth and kingoms fall when men refuse to pray on rocks and hills and mountains. But God's love, &gt;&gt; God's love so sure [Music] still endure. All measure [Music] and stronging praise to Adam the saints in it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Love of God. Oh love of God.

It shall forever more endure the saints and [Music] &gt;&gt; the love of God written on insanity institution. But that scripture is so true. That poem is so true. If we could write what God has done in our life, how could we express the marvelous grace of God in our life? The prophet says, "Don't be afraid of man or what he can do to you. I am with you." That God speaking, "I am with you and my grace is sufficient for you. When you pass through the waters, they will not overflow you." &gt;&gt; Not even in death are you defeated. You are more than a conqueror. It says nothing can separate us from the love of God. No, don't be afraid. Don't be scared. Nothing can separate us from the love of God. We are not to fear. His love cast out all fear. Amen. Amen. Because nothing can separate us from the very love of Christ. Not shall be tribulation, distress or persecution or famine, nakedness or peril or soul. Oh, as he said, but we are persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, no powers, no things present, nor things to come, no height, nor death, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen. All is well for the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. All is well. All is well. All is well. All is well. [Music] &gt;&gt; All is well. [Music] We have heard the message shalom and all is well.
