[7:26] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; It's nice to be in house of the Lord.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Um I did ask your pastor this morning. I
[7:36] have a request in my heart. I I have it
[7:39] for a long time and uh today I feel like
[7:43] I have to say it.
[7:46] &gt;&gt; So our God is a God of peace.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; So this is request is for Congo.
[7:55] You know that uh our pastor many of us
[7:57] were from Congo
[7:59] and there is war. It been going in Congo
[8:03] for decades for 30 years.
[8:06] So many of you you don't know
[8:09] and sometime people around us brother
[8:13] in Christ friend they don't know we
[8:17] don't talk about it but uh they said the
[8:22] killing is like
[8:24] uh the uh second world war I
[8:32] last week US President Donald Trump was
[8:36] They don't know even how many 7 million
[8:39] or more than that.
[8:42] So last week, last Sunday I believe in
[8:46] it, one of the province, people were
[8:48] praying and 49 were killed and then we
[8:52] don't want to know how they killed them.
[8:54] They cut them of machete
[8:56] and the killing. I don't want to go into
[8:59] all the details. If you like to know
[9:01] just go on YouTube search war in Congo.
[9:06] So 30 years million of people killed a
[9:10] lot of things. People they don't say it.
[9:13] It's quiet. Sometime we come in church
[9:16] we pray we jump but uh someone is
[9:19] suffering.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Refugees. 7 million refugee in Congo.
[9:25] Some of them they cross the border. It's
[9:28] already and the US is trying US
[9:31] President Donald Trump is trying to help
[9:34] government in Congo to stop that war but
[9:38] it's terrible.
[9:40] So that's why today
[9:42] uh I'm here I ask you we believe that
[9:46] our God
[9:48] &gt;&gt; it's powerful
[9:49] &gt;&gt; and he's the prince of peace. So I'd

[19:50] The stories
[19:53] and pictures
[19:56] in most
[19:59] magazines
[20:02] now feature
[20:05] new stylings
[20:08] not fit
[20:10] to be seen.
[20:14] They're placed on
[20:17] the new stands
[20:20] where children
[20:23] can buy
[20:25] when they go wrong.

[20:46] will flee
[20:48] and sin
[20:51] will cover
[20:54] the land
[20:56] and the sea.
[21:00] If we forget God,
[21:05] Satan
[21:08] will rule.
[21:11] If we
[21:13] forget God,
[21:16] our nation
[21:19] is Jew.
[21:25] We hear about the wars.
[21:29] I see famine in the land.
[21:33] There's questions in the little
[21:36] children's eyes. Trouble in the east
[21:39] again.
[21:41] The whole world is shaking
[21:45] with no sure place to stand.
[21:49] And a mournful sound is heard throughout
[21:54] the land.
[22:01] I keep listening for a different
[22:07] sound.
[22:09] Sound of the city that John saw coming
[22:14] down.
[22:16] The sound of the bride being united with
[22:21] the groove.
[22:24] I keep listening.
[22:27] I keep listening.
[22:31] I keep listening for different
[22:36] sound.
[22:43] I remember the preacher saying
[22:47] that it shall come to pass there will
[22:51] come a generation
[22:55] that will be the last.
[22:58] I can't believe I'm standing here seeing
[23:03] the end of time
[23:06] and the preacher's voice echoing in my
[23:10] mind.
[23:14] I keep listening for a different sound.
[23:21] The sound of the city that John saw
[23:26] coming down.
[23:28] The sound of the bride being united with
[23:34] the groove.
[23:36] I keep listening.
[23:40] I keep listening.

[24:06] Yes, I keep listening for the for a
[24:09] different sound. Amen. This is the age
[24:12] that they're talking about there.

[24:18] brother Rogers said. you know, in uh the
[24:20] communities we live, you know, Canada is
[24:23] kind of like a melting pot or should we
[24:27] say different people coming from
[24:29] different areas. Sometimes we see our
[24:32] neighbors around. We don't know their
[24:34] situation. We don't know what brought
[24:36] them to Canada. H But you know what?
[24:38] What we know is that there's just that
[24:40] one God, the God of heaven, who takes
[24:43] care of all our needs, no matter how
[24:45] big, no, how small they are. Amen.
[24:51] Uh there's a song that says uh I'm going
[24:54] to get the I'm going to let the glory
[24:57] roll.
[24:58] I not very good at it, but uh we'll try
[25:01] the chorus on that.
[25:04] I'm going to let the glory roar when the
[25:07] roll is called in glory.
[25:11] Going to get inside myself when I be
[25:14] beside the king that day. I'm going to
[25:18] have the time of my life. When the time
[25:21] of my life is over,
[25:24] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[25:28] get carried away,
[25:32] I'm going to let the glory roll. When I
[25:35] get in glory,
[25:39] I'm going to get beside myself. When I
[25:42] get beside the king that day, I going to
[25:47] get the time of my life. When the time
[25:49] of my life is over,
[25:53] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[25:56] get carried away, let's sing it again.

[26:03] the glories called in glory,

[26:15] to have the time of my life. When my
[26:18] life is over,
[26:21] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[26:25] get carried away,
[26:28] can come. Amen.

[43:30] you. It's wonderful. Amen.
[43:34] Second Peter chapter 1. As we go through
[43:36] this study,
[43:46] Sister Debbie, God bless you. Good to
[43:47] see you. Last time I almost called
[43:50] someone like, "Sister Debian, I don't
[43:52] know who that was. still trying to find
[43:54] that person. But I was so looking
[43:56] forward to see you that I called
[43:58] someone. You are sister Debbie.
[44:01] But uh God bless you. Good to see you.
[44:06] Let's stand together reading the word of
[44:08] God. Um second Peter chapter 1
[44:18] verse three. According we can start for
[44:21] verse two actually. Grace and peace be
[44:23] multiplied unto you through the
[44:25] knowledge of God and of our Jesus our
[44:28] Lord. According as his divine power has
[44:31] given unto us all things that pertain
[44:34] unto life and godliness through the
[44:36] knowledge of him that had called us to
[44:39] glory and virtue. That's where I take my
[44:42] title. We are called to glory and
[44:45] virtue. say, "Whereby I given unto us
[44:49] exceeding great and precious promises,
[44:52] that by these you might be partakers of
[44:55] the divine nature, having escaped the
[44:58] corruption that is in the world through
[45:00] lust. And beside this, giving all
[45:03] diligence, add to your faith virtue, and
[45:08] to virtue knowledge." May God bless his
[45:11] word. Can I have a seat? Amen.
[45:15] As we are going through this study of
[45:17] the stature of a perfect man or the
[45:20] statue of the fullness of Christ, we
[45:22] have been developing a lot on faith and
[45:25] I believe we can never finish the topic
[45:28] of faith to continue until the end. But
[45:31] we need just to make another step try to
[45:34] look at a different angle as much as we
[45:37] could. But it's still a lot to be talked
[45:39] about faith. But we just move to the
[45:42] next stage of virtue. next stage of
[45:45] virtue there. U so I would like just to
[45:48] take that that from the scripture um
[45:51] second Peter
[45:53] second Peter chapter one and verse three
[45:57] according as his divine power. His
[45:59] divine power has given us unto us all
[46:03] things that pertain unto life and
[46:06] godliness through the knowledge of him
[46:08] that had called us to glory and virtue.
[46:12] And we are called to glory and virtue.
[46:16] Amen.
[46:25] In Greek the word virtue there it's
[46:27] written as arete.
[46:29] Hopefully I'm spelling well. I'm saying
[46:31] well arete which is reference as the
[46:34] excellent of a person of things
[46:37] fulfilling its intended function. says
[46:40] they give an example like a knife being
[46:42] sharp or a soldier being brave says that
[46:45] is full of virtue in the biblical use it
[46:49] says it refers to the excellence of
[46:51] character specialp specially moral
[46:55] strength or courage
[46:57] so aret has been used in the new
[46:59] testament five times and only three
[47:03] times has been translated as virtue in
[47:05] those in the sense of arete other places
[47:08] has been translated as praises.
[47:11] And first in Philippians 4:8 says,
[47:15] "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things
[47:17] are true, whatsoever things are honest,
[47:20] whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
[47:22] things are pure, whatsoever things are
[47:25] lovely, whatsoever things are of good
[47:28] report, there be if there be any virtue,
[47:33] if there be any praise, think on these
[47:35] things." So the same thing of virtue. So
[47:38] if I have anything that have any virtue
[47:40] have any can give excellent strength can
[47:42] give excellence purity of thought or
[47:46] moral purity of thought in that then you
[47:49] can you can think on those things
[47:52] otherwise don't think on those things.
[47:54] Amen. So virtue contains it goes deeper
[47:58] than just that just just the virtues in
[48:01] the natural. It's calling to a deeper
[48:04] Christian life to it's calling to a
[48:07] deeper spiritual development. Not only
[48:10] avoiding sin on the natural physical sin
[48:13] but also filled with the divine
[48:15] character. Maybe another message we
[48:17] going to talk about character that God
[48:20] is looking for character. Amen. As Elza
[48:23] was looking for character. Amen. God is
[48:25] looking for character. God bless you
[48:27] richly for that. Amen. So the prophet
[48:30] says this is more just it more it more
[48:33] than just clean physical life.
[48:36] And the prophet says at the beginning
[48:38] there it's more than just
[48:43] clean physical life. Are you with me
[48:46] this morning? Amen. I'm going a little
[48:48] bit slowly but we will get there
[48:50] somewhere hopefully by God's grace.
[48:52] Amen. In other uses of English word
[48:55] virtue they says um and so giving the
[48:58] description it says it's not only the
[49:00] word arete but in the so Greek it was
[49:03] used also is a dynamis
[49:05] which means the power of the strength
[49:08] often used for healing power so many
[49:11] places we see used the dynamic that
[49:13] where the word dynamic comes from is
[49:16] power is strength amen Luke 6:19 says
[49:19] and the whole multitude sought to touch
[49:21] Jesus For then went virtue out of him
[49:26] and healed them. So there was virtue in
[49:28] Jesus Christ and that virtue came out of
[49:31] Jesus Christ and healed the people.
[49:33] Amen. In Mark 5:30 says, "And Jesus
[49:37] immediately knowing himself that virtue
[49:39] had gone out of him, turned him about in
[49:42] the press and said, "Who touched my
[49:45] clothes?" Amen. That woman with the
[49:47] blood issue, she had a revelation. She
[49:50] knew she she had a revelation said that
[49:52] God revealed to her if I go and touches
[49:55] the the hem of his garment I will be
[49:58] healed and God dropped that revelation
[50:01] inside of her heart and she went and she
[50:03] touched the hem of a garment and she and
[50:06] she was healed. She spent so much things
[50:09] so much money on different things and
[50:11] different doctors but when she came to
[50:13] Jesus Christ he immediately healed her.
[50:16] Amen. And he's still the high priest who
[50:19] can be touched by the feeling of
[50:20] infirmities today. He's still the same
[50:23] yesterday, today, today and forever.
[50:25] Amen. If you have a need, you can come
[50:27] and touch him. How can you touch the
[50:29] Lord Jesus Christ? You can touch him by
[50:31] faith. Amen. You can touch him and he
[50:33] will respond to your need because he's
[50:35] still here as we sung at the beginning.
[50:37] He has not changed. He's still the same
[50:39] yesterday, today, and forever. The Holy
[50:41] is here in the form of the Holy Spirit.
[50:43] Amen. If you have faith, you can touch
[50:46] him and you'll be healed. Amen. So
[50:48] virtue came out of him and he healed
[50:50] her. Amen. The same virtue is here. The
[50:53] same virtue has not changed. The virtue
[50:56] is still here. The same power is still
[50:58] here. The prophet says the Bible says we
[51:00] read over here in the book of Luke that
[51:02] what we reference to where it said
[51:04] virtue went out of him. That's right.
[51:08] The congregation says amen. And we are
[51:10] going to be like him. We must have
[51:13] virtue. Then if you want to be like
[51:15] Jesus, we also must have virtue. We must
[51:19] have the same power inside of us. We
[51:22] must have it to be like him. He is he is
[51:26] the he is the first song that ever loved
[51:29] in the hymns. One of the greatest the
[51:31] prophet says was to be like Jesus. No
[51:34] matter I like the same song to be like
[51:36] Jesus. All my desire is to be Oh my
[51:40] voice is going.
[51:51] try to be there. So to be like Jesus and
[51:54] well well if I'm going to be like Jesus
[51:57] I've got to have virtue and a pass that
[52:00] I can and a pass that it can pass
[52:03] forward from me to the people because
[52:06] virtue went out of him to the people.
[52:09] You see virtue before you can let it
[52:12] out, you've got to have it first. Amen.
[52:15] You haven't got it, it won't come out.
[52:18] There is nothing for it to come out of.
[52:20] Amen.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; In order to give virtue to other people,
[52:23] you need to have the same virtue inside
[52:25] of you first.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; We know. We know that same virtue.
[52:30] Sometimes we put it in a different way.
[52:31] I might if God gives me grace, my I'm
[52:34] going that way. Sometimes we have sin.
[52:37] We look at only because we see it in the
[52:39] negative things. We have seen how people
[52:42] have exaggerated on the other side. go
[52:44] there you know see many sometimes you
[52:46] YouTube is full of them you know oh oh
[52:49] someone is creating oh and people fall
[52:51] and oh that pastor has virtue or that
[52:54] servant is really has power of god and
[52:57] that touch and people are falling and
[52:59] yeah it's good it's good praise be to
[53:01] god to that there's nothing wrong to
[53:03] that I mean in a normal way and
[53:06] sometimes can go to the extreme and you
[53:08] want just to see that and we have seen
[53:10] that and and sometimes it we see that
[53:13] being performed And behind it there is
[53:15] no life. And we see the pastor there. He
[53:18] does that but behind that and he's the
[53:20] one doing bad things and the one
[53:21] corrupting things, one stealing money
[53:23] from people and things. Then people
[53:26] wonder is really anything genuine about
[53:28] it. Anything real about it. Then we try
[53:32] to neglect it and and and shame to the
[53:34] pastor, shame to the minister, shame to
[53:36] the people try to use that just to show
[53:39] off and becomes a show off. It becomes
[53:41] an entertainment. It becomes all the
[53:43] different things and you know there is
[53:45] no the word of God behind it and it just
[53:48] becomes it just becomes a show I would
[53:50] say becomes a show and and there is no
[53:52] life to back it up and that's wrong
[53:55] that's why we started it has to start by
[53:57] faith it has to start by the new birth
[53:59] it has to start there must be a life
[54:01] behind it to sustain it amen otherwise
[54:04] it's just a showman like it's just a
[54:07] show and there's nothing behind it but
[54:09] on the other hand as well you know
[54:11] Christians Christian need to have the
[54:13] power of God.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Christian need to have the virtue inside
[54:17] of them.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Christian needs to have the reality of
[54:20] Jesus Christ in their life
[54:22] &gt;&gt; because he has not changed. Amen. Oh,
[54:25] you are going through a situation. You
[54:27] can lay hands on the sick and they can
[54:30] then they will be healed. Your hands the
[54:32] same hands your hands. Amen. Not only
[54:35] the hands of the pastor, your hands can
[54:37] do the work. Amen. God has no other hand
[54:40] but your hand. God has no other eyes but
[54:42] your eyes. He still want to use the body
[54:46] of people to continue his work. Amen.
[54:48] The Holy Spirit comes to give power.
[54:51] Amen. The Holy Spirit is not only in the
[54:54] words. The Holy Spirit is not only a
[54:56] theory. The Holy Spirit is a reality.
[54:58] Amen. The Holy Spirit brings the power
[55:00] of change. Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Amen.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; So you you as a vessel God want to use
[55:10] you to convey the virtue. It can be a
[55:12] virtue that you feel physically but it
[55:15] can also be a virtue for spiritual
[55:17] strength. Something someone is someone
[55:21] is in need. Someone needs an
[55:23] encouragement. You know you you you need
[55:26] to have the virtue of God to encourage
[55:29] that person. You need to be in the
[55:31] channel God can use you to encourage
[55:33] that person. Amen. But if there is no
[55:36] nothing behind there's no there is no
[55:38] virtue in you. There is no power there's
[55:40] no strength you can't help the other
[55:42] person. Amen. But you need to be in the
[55:45] channel that God can use you to help the
[55:47] other person. You need even to be
[55:50] feeding upon the word of God. You need
[55:51] to be in the channel that God can use
[55:53] you in order to convey virtue to another
[55:57] person. The virtue that God gives you,
[55:59] it's not only for you. It's for the
[56:01] other person, too.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; We look in the Bible, we see Mary. Mary
[56:07] went and see Elizabeth. You know the
[56:10] story very well. You know how the
[56:11] prophet dramatized it very well. She
[56:14] went and she has met the angel. She had
[56:17] received the word of power. She had
[56:19] received the word of virtue. Amen. Now
[56:22] she's going to see another one who is in
[56:24] a situation where she's wondering, "Oh,
[56:27] first of all, I have a husband who can't
[56:29] speak."
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Put it on in her mind. She has a husband
[56:33] who can't speak. She has a husband who
[56:35] was actually an unbeliever or a make
[56:37] believer. Maybe now God strike him. He
[56:40] can't talk anymore.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; So she's wondering what's going on.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; She's feeling that something has
[56:45] happened in her. There is a change.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Is she feel that? Oh, she's she's
[56:49] pregnant, but the baby is not moving.
[56:52] There is death. If the baby dies, it's
[56:55] probably going to affect her as well.
[56:57] She's going to die. She's there
[56:59] desperate and she doesn't know what to
[57:01] do. But then the angel meet Mary on the
[57:04] corner somewhere. Praise be to God.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; She meet the angel somewhere in the
[57:08] corner and the angel told her, you know,
[57:11] even Elizabeth is now pregnant with a
[57:14] child and she will give birth too. So
[57:16] she comes with the word of God. Amen.
[57:19] She has met the angels. How many have
[57:22] met the angel? Amen. You have met the
[57:23] mighty angel of God. You have
[57:29] Excuse me. My voice is is betraying me
[57:32] this morning. Sorry. But we we but it's
[57:35] okay. I mean I'm not sick. It's just
[57:37] you're bothering me.
[57:41] So she comes, she comes with the word of
[57:43] God. The same way that we have received
[57:46] the word of God,
[57:47] &gt;&gt; the secret for the bride in the last
[57:50] age, she has the word of God like it was
[57:53] in Mary. We have the same word of God in
[57:56] the bride today. Amen.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; If you use the same word of God, it can
[58:00] give life to someone else.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; That's why we have to testify about the
[58:05] word of God that we have received. Don't
[58:07] be ashamed of the word of God we have
[58:09] received.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; It has power to change. It has power to
[58:13] transform. It has power to comfort. It
[58:16] has power to encourage someone. It has
[58:19] power to give life to something that is
[58:21] dead.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; So she comes with the good news. We have
[58:24] the good news.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; I have met the angel. I have met the
[58:28] angel. He has told me that I will have a
[58:32] child. You know the prophet dramatized.
[58:34] He didn't tell how what happened. Oh no.
[58:36] I I will have a child. Oh, Mary, you
[58:39] have a child. But you're not married to
[58:41] Joseph yet? Yes, I'm not I'm not married
[58:43] yet. But something the I've met the
[58:47] angel. Praise be to God. I've made the
[58:50] angel told me that the Holy Spirit will
[58:52] overshadow me and I will bear a son.
[58:54] Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; And that son will be named Lord Jesus
[58:58] Christ. Amen. The first time that she
[59:00] mentions the name Jesus Christ, John in
[59:03] the belly of Elizabeth start jumping,
[59:06] start leaping of joy. The prophet says,
[59:09] "If the first time that the word of God,
[59:12] that the name of Jesus Christ was
[59:13] pronounced, it gave birth to a dead
[59:16] baby, how much more shall it do to the
[59:19] church that is born again?"
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. to show the power of the word. We
[59:24] have received the name of Jesus Christ
[59:27] still has the power to change, the power
[59:30] to deliver, the power to save, the power
[59:33] to redeem. Amen.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Remember Mary was did not even have the
[59:38] Holy Ghost. Mary had to receive the Holy
[59:41] Ghost in the upper room. She didn't have
[59:42] the Holy Ghost, but she pronounced the
[59:45] word of God, believing the word of God,
[59:48] it gave life. How much more the
[59:50] Christians who are born again today,
[59:53] they have the Holy Ghost, they can
[59:54] pronounce the name of Jesus Christ, you
[59:57] will produce the same result. Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; She transferred virtue from her to
[1:00:03] Elizabeth. Amen. You can if you have the
[1:00:06] virtue of God, you can transfer it to
[1:00:08] someone else. Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. That's
[1:00:12] why we need a church. That's why we need
[1:00:13] one another. Amen. Sometimes can come to
[1:00:16] someone come to church is so weak and
[1:00:18] everything but he's sitting next to you.
[1:00:20] You see how you are singing. You see how
[1:00:22] joyful you are. Your virtue is
[1:00:24] transformed to the other person. I feel
[1:00:26] so good. I was in church. You did not
[1:00:29] know that the virtue came from my
[1:00:30] brother. The virtue came from my sister.
[1:00:33] Amen. Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; We have the virtue of God inside of us.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Encouraging you brothers and sisters.
[1:00:45] And then Elizabeth said, "Oh, when is
[1:00:47] this to me that the mother of my Lord
[1:00:50] should come to me? For lo, as soon as
[1:00:52] the voice of that salutation sounded in
[1:00:55] my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for
[1:00:58] joy. Blessed is she that believed."
[1:01:01] Oh, I used to wonder how come the
[1:01:04] prophet could tell a story about it that
[1:01:06] no, it was not. She didn't just greet
[1:01:08] him and say, "Hey, Elizabeth." No, she
[1:01:11] had to say a testimony that what gave
[1:01:14] life to the baby.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; I used to wonder how the prophet where
[1:01:18] did he get it from? Then I was reading
[1:01:20] oh Elizabeth himself says it when when
[1:01:24] he when he greeted her and told her she
[1:01:27] said blessed is she that believed. How
[1:01:30] Elizabeth would say blessed are you
[1:01:32] because you believe what the angel said
[1:01:34] to you. So you must have told her what
[1:01:36] the experience then she realized, oh
[1:01:39] praise be to God because you believe
[1:01:41] what the angel told you. That's what
[1:01:43] she's confessing. Pray, blessed are you
[1:01:45] because you believed.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Blessed are you because you believe what
[1:01:50] the angel has told you.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; And God is going to fulfill his word.
[1:01:55] Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; For there shall be a performance of
[1:02:00] those things which were told her from
[1:02:03] the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; The prophet continues says Jesus the
[1:02:09] little John leaped in the in the
[1:02:10] mother's womb begin to jump like that
[1:02:12] received life. The first time the name
[1:02:15] of Jesus Christ was ever spoke to mortal
[1:02:18] lips. A dead baby come to life in the
[1:02:20] womb of a mother brother. If it will
[1:02:23] bring a dead baby to life, what ought to
[1:02:25] be to a born again Christian? Amen.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; It says hallelujah. The same thing. It
[1:02:31] will make a work. The blind see,
[1:02:34] the deaf hear the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:02:38] Is it something of the past? Is it
[1:02:40] something only for brother problem
[1:02:41] brother? Is it something that we can say
[1:02:43] or no? It is something. No. It's still a
[1:02:46] reality today.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; It can give life amen to those who are
[1:02:50] dead. It can it can make the
[1:02:53] walk. The blind see the deaf heal in the
[1:02:56] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes we put it so much you
[1:03:01] know these are these are little things.
[1:03:02] Yeah, thank God. It's a little thing. We
[1:03:04] are not yet at the capstone.
[1:03:06] Praise be to God. We are going to the
[1:03:08] capstone. We'll get there one day if the
[1:03:10] Lord terries.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; But you can't get to the capstone if you
[1:03:13] don't have the good foundation.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we be little and say, "Oh, no.
[1:03:18] No. This is for baby. This is
[1:03:19] pentecotism. The only, you know, we
[1:03:21] can't teach the bride pantism of
[1:03:24] things."
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; But where are you going without having
[1:03:27] the good foundation? Brother Wam had the
[1:03:30] first pool, the second pool, the third
[1:03:32] pool. But even in the third pool, the
[1:03:35] miracle didn't didn't finish. The
[1:03:37] miracle was not for the past. Amen. It
[1:03:40] was still working. Amen. Even when the
[1:03:42] word of God is open, the miracle are
[1:03:44] still there. Amen. The power of God is
[1:03:46] even more amplified. Amen. We should not
[1:03:49] we should not we should not live under
[1:03:52] our privileges. Amen. We have the word
[1:03:54] of God. We have the power of God.
[1:03:56] Actually the word of God should produce
[1:03:58] the power of God. Amen. Because the word
[1:04:01] of God doesn't come only in words only
[1:04:03] in letters but it comes with the
[1:04:05] dynamics. Amen.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Once you receive the capstone even the
[1:04:09] virtue that we have there becomes more
[1:04:11] amplified.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Look at Peter John at the gate.
[1:04:17] Beautiful.
[1:04:20] going to cough again.
[1:04:26] Act 3:13. And Peter and John went up
[1:04:28] together in the temple at the hour of
[1:04:30] prayer being the ninth hour. And a
[1:04:34] certain man lame from his mother's womb
[1:04:36] were carried whom they lay daily at the
[1:04:38] gate at the gate of the temple which is
[1:04:41] called beautiful to ask arms of them
[1:04:43] that enter into the temple who seeing
[1:04:46] Peter and John about to go into the
[1:04:48] temple asked and know arms and Peter
[1:04:51] fastening his eyes upon him with John
[1:04:54] said look on us
[1:04:57] focus on us focus on what we're going to
[1:04:59] tell you and he gave heed unto them
[1:05:02] expecting to receive something of them.
[1:05:04] Then Peter said, "Silver and gold have I
[1:05:07] not, but such as I have give idea."
[1:05:10] Amen.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; He had something before he could give to
[1:05:13] something else.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; He had to possess it before you give to
[1:05:17] someone else.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; And he had the power of God.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; He knew that God was with him. Amen. He
[1:05:23] was not there. Sometimes it's marvelous.
[1:05:26] He was not there trying to God pray,
[1:05:28] bro, I will pray until God sends me the
[1:05:31] power and everything. I will fast. He
[1:05:34] knew that God's power was there.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Look at me. I'm going to declare the
[1:05:38] word of God. What I have, I transfer
[1:05:41] that to you. Amen. No matter the
[1:05:43] situation, I transfer that to you. Amen.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; On that place, it was a miracle. But let
[1:05:48] me tell you, it might not be a miracle
[1:05:50] in your life that happened all of a
[1:05:51] sudden, but you still have the same
[1:05:53] power as you declare it. That's not your
[1:05:57] problem. That's God's problem to deal
[1:05:58] with it.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I declare healing upon my
[1:06:02] family. I declare salvation upon my
[1:06:05] family. I declare actually redemption
[1:06:08] upon my family because God says if I'm
[1:06:11] saved, my family shall be saved.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; God says if I if they lay hands upon me,
[1:06:16] I'm healed. Amen.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't see it yet, but I believe.
[1:06:20] Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Because the virtue is in the bride.
[1:06:29] So I give you in the name of Jesus
[1:06:30] Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.
[1:06:33] And he took him by the right hand and
[1:06:34] lifting up and immediately his feet and
[1:06:36] ankles bones received strength and he
[1:06:39] lifted up and leaping up. And he lifting
[1:06:42] leaping up stood and walked and entered
[1:06:44] with them into the temple walking and
[1:06:46] leaping and praising God. Amen.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. The pro that's what
[1:06:51] the prophet says in the message of
[1:06:53] search of a perfect man. We are not
[1:06:55] building an organization.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; We are not here this morning to build an
[1:06:59] organization.
[1:07:01] Christ has never sent me to build an
[1:07:03] organization.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; We are not here to build just a group, a
[1:07:08] society or community or something.
[1:07:10] That's not the purpose. Amen. Christ has
[1:07:13] sent me to build indiv individuals to
[1:07:16] the statue of Jesus Christ. Amen. Why
[1:07:20] does he want Why did he send him to
[1:07:21] build individuals? He sent him to build
[1:07:24] individuals so that they might be the
[1:07:26] powerhouse. The powerhouse. Amen.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; How what is a powerhouse? Is a place
[1:07:32] where they store energy. Amen. God has
[1:07:35] called you to the message in order to
[1:07:37] store energy inside of you. In order to
[1:07:39] store virtue inside of you. Amen. So
[1:07:42] that he can use that virtue for your
[1:07:44] family, for your place where you are
[1:07:46] working, for your community where you
[1:07:47] are. You are a powerhouse. Amen. You are
[1:07:50] a virtue house. Amen.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; You are actually a cabin. Electrical
[1:07:54] cabin. Amen. You know it's a small thing
[1:07:56] and people oh that you know once you
[1:07:58] touch there you'll find out or maybe you
[1:08:00] might not find out. You'll find on the
[1:08:01] other side what happened to you. Amen.
[1:08:04] That's what a Christian is. You might
[1:08:06] not look very handsome or cute or
[1:08:09] whatever it might but once you have the
[1:08:11] Holy Ghost inside of you, you have the
[1:08:14] power of Jesus Christ. The dynamic of
[1:08:16] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need us, God can give
[1:08:20] that to you.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; So that might be the powerhouse and the
[1:08:28] dwelling place of the spirit by his
[1:08:30] word. By his word see build up the
[1:08:33] individual to that place. Not build an
[1:08:35] organization to a greater denomination
[1:08:37] but build individual to sons and
[1:08:40] daughters of God. That's the idea. Add
[1:08:43] to your faith, virtue to your virtue,
[1:08:46] knowledge, and our coming to a place
[1:08:49] then you keep going up. Amen. Don't just
[1:08:52] know I have faith. I have faith. Yes,
[1:08:54] you have faith, but that faith has
[1:08:56] power. Amen. Look at Elijah.
[1:09:00] Elijah see that little boy. The Bible
[1:09:02] says, actually, I think I have a little
[1:09:04] reference. First Kings 17:21, Elijah
[1:09:07] stretched himself upon the the child
[1:09:09] three times. The child was completely
[1:09:11] dead. completely dead
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; and he laid himself upon the child and
[1:09:16] cried unto the Lord and the soul of the
[1:09:18] child came upon him and he revived.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Elijah putting his body and warming up
[1:09:24] with the body of a dead man. Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, that that's something only on
[1:09:29] the past.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; No, it's not only something of the past.
[1:09:33] The same God there is still the same God
[1:09:35] today. Amen.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; How many times you feel like you are
[1:09:38] solo? You are solo. But once someone
[1:09:41] calls you, someone speaks something to
[1:09:43] you, you come to church, you go
[1:09:45] different from the place how you came to
[1:09:47] to church. What is doing? What is that
[1:09:49] power? What is that virtue came from?
[1:09:51] The same God is still here. Amen.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; If God have a prophet will actually make
[1:09:57] put that many many many places, it was
[1:10:00] the dynamic. Amen. If the dynamic was
[1:10:02] working so well under the law, how much
[1:10:05] more when the Holy Ghost comes upon the
[1:10:08] believer, the same dynamic should work.
[1:10:10] Amen. It has to work. Amen.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's something to challenge us a
[1:10:15] little bit. Amen. We are not looking for
[1:10:17] it as I have to see. I have to see. No,
[1:10:19] but oh God, help me to be in the channel
[1:10:21] where you can use me. Help me to be
[1:10:24] expecting more for you to work. Amen. We
[1:10:26] can't always rely on medicine. We can't
[1:10:28] always rely on on the schools. kind of
[1:10:31] relies on technology. Where is the power
[1:10:33] of God? It's here. Amen. Some God, now
[1:10:36] I'm putting you to the test. I'm proving
[1:10:38] your word. I'm believing your word. The
[1:10:41] virtue is inside of me. I have faith.
[1:10:43] So, the virtue has to be there. Amen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; I believe that I'm I'm all the way to
[1:10:47] the cap to the to the capstone. But I'm
[1:10:50] all the way to cap. But where is my
[1:10:52] virtue? Where is what I can transfer to
[1:10:55] others?
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Where the people can draw from me? Where
[1:10:58] is it? Lord, help me Lord. Amen.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Elisha, even Elish and the Shunomite
[1:11:11] son, he went up lay upon the child. The
[1:11:14] flesh of the child walks home and the
[1:11:16] child sneeze seven times and open his
[1:11:19] eyes. The same thing happened showing
[1:11:22] the dynamic of God. The dynamic when
[1:11:25] comes upon the prophet, he gave him
[1:11:27] life. If Elisha's bones, now another
[1:11:31] experience. If Elisha bones, they were
[1:11:33] carrying a dead person. They were
[1:11:35] carrying a dead person. Then they saw
[1:11:36] the enemy coming, they throw that dead
[1:11:38] person in the cave where Elisha was
[1:11:41] buried.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; If the bones of Elisha can give life to
[1:11:45] that person who was dead,
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; how much more the church of the living
[1:11:50] God today that is still alive believing
[1:11:53] the word of God, we should have the
[1:11:55] virtue inside of us. Hallelujah.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, may you shake us and give us that
[1:12:00] virtue of God.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; The prophet says next quote
[1:12:13] statue of the perfect man. What if
[1:12:15] someone try to draw virtue out of us
[1:12:18] and the check will return insufficient
[1:12:21] funds?
[1:12:26] Oh brother, sisters, no I'm going
[1:12:28] through difficult times. You know what
[1:12:29] this happened to me and then this I'm
[1:12:32] going through that difficult time. I
[1:12:33] don't know what I can to do. Oh sister,
[1:12:37] would you please pray for me?
[1:12:40] You know what?
[1:12:42] That's really bad situation.
[1:12:45] My grandpa died from it.
[1:12:48] Oh,
[1:12:50] sufficient funds
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; can't have any virtue to give to another
[1:12:54] person.
[1:12:57] Oh, you know what happened in the church
[1:12:58] there? There was a problem. This, there
[1:12:59] was a problem this. Oh, really? Oh,
[1:13:02] yeah. Oh, tell me more. I will find out.
[1:13:05] And go on and go on,
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; insufficient funds.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; But the real Christian hear that, oh,
[1:13:13] let's pray about it. Let's put our hands
[1:13:15] on. You know, God can deliver him. God
[1:13:17] is still working. You know the devil is
[1:13:19] fighting. We recognize is the work of
[1:13:21] the enemy. But we don't want to give him
[1:13:23] any house. We stay with the word of God.
[1:13:25] Let's pray together. Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; The other person who came negative is
[1:13:29] going back with positive. Amen. He
[1:13:31] receive a charge. Amen. From the other
[1:13:33] person. Because you are not too much
[1:13:35] negative. You have something positive.
[1:13:37] Virtue is positive. Amen. The power of
[1:13:40] God is is positive.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone comes to draw virtue out
[1:13:44] of us and the check will return
[1:13:46] insufficient funds. See? No, no, no, no,
[1:13:49] no. They are to draw from check, check
[1:13:53] bounced.
[1:13:55] Somebody looking at you as a Christian
[1:13:57] and tomorrow see you out here carrying
[1:13:59] on like a sinner. Not much virtue can be
[1:14:03] drawn from that. Oh, I'm a Christian. I
[1:14:05] believe the message and things. And the
[1:14:08] next thing they found you dressed like a
[1:14:12] like a chicken
[1:14:19] insufficient funds. So, oh no, they are
[1:14:21] just like the other denominations can't
[1:14:24] draw anything from them. So, oh no, you
[1:14:27] testify testify and then they hear you.
[1:14:29] You're the one gossiping and oh
[1:14:31] insufficient funds.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; May God help us. Amen.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; But when you have a clean life, pure
[1:14:37] life, always positive, staying on the
[1:14:40] word of God and testify, not to show up,
[1:14:43] just a clean, simple, humble life,
[1:14:45] people can draw from that. How many
[1:14:48] times at work people will just notice it
[1:14:50] you and when they have a problem, they
[1:14:52] come, you know, you know, I know that
[1:14:54] you pray, you you go to church, can you
[1:14:56] pray for me, for my situation, for my
[1:14:58] child and everything, they notice that
[1:15:00] that there is power there. There is
[1:15:02] something that is keeping you hold. They
[1:15:05] see you go through trials and different
[1:15:07] things but they notice that there is
[1:15:08] something that is keeping you. There is
[1:15:11] a keeping power holding you there. Amen.
[1:15:14] That's different from other people. Now
[1:15:16] they can come and draw from that. Oh,
[1:15:18] don't say no only has they have to be
[1:15:20] believers. Some they might not even be
[1:15:22] message believers but they drew
[1:15:24] something from you from that time. And
[1:15:26] that's what God wants to be. Amen. want
[1:15:29] us to be be a powerhouse any place
[1:15:32] anytime under any circumstances. God
[1:15:35] help us to be ready for that for that to
[1:15:38] someone needs a little bit of charger
[1:15:40] come to me. Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Your house has to be a place where your
[1:15:44] children come finds power.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; They might not be here believers but
[1:15:49] they know that they can go anywhere but
[1:15:51] when I come to daddy I find some peace.
[1:15:54] When I talk to mommy I find some peace.
[1:15:56] I might not agree with him. right away.
[1:15:58] But I know that daddy and mommy has
[1:16:00] something different and I can draw from
[1:16:03] them. Amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Let's make our house powerhouse.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; They come, you talk to them. No judging.
[1:16:12] No. No. Just come talk to them nicely
[1:16:16] convey and everything. They will draw
[1:16:18] from you. That will help them to conquer
[1:16:20] the enemy outside where they are.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:33] The prophet says
[1:16:35] virtue must be in us. Virtue must be in
[1:16:39] us. So virtue is not an option. He's not
[1:16:43] saying no no we skip all that. No let's
[1:16:45] go to the third pool. Let's go to the
[1:16:47] third pool. Speak the word and
[1:16:49] everything but no virtue. So no no no
[1:16:52] it's a must. Don't skip it. Don't jump
[1:16:55] over it. You have to have it. You have
[1:16:58] to have the reality. You have virtue
[1:17:01] must be in us until we get virtue. Then
[1:17:04] when we get virtue, true virtue prophet
[1:17:06] say when we get true virtue, we can add
[1:17:08] it to our faith. We know the expression
[1:17:10] when you're saying adding doesn't mean
[1:17:12] that you force yourself to add. Oh no,
[1:17:15] I'm going to have virtue. I'm going to
[1:17:16] force. No, that's not that. I'm just
[1:17:19] repeating. We already went through that.
[1:17:21] But when you say adding is Lord you stay
[1:17:24] in the channel you feed upon the word of
[1:17:26] God you stay prayed up you all that then
[1:17:29] things going to add up by themselves by
[1:17:31] God's grace but you're also praying God
[1:17:33] I want to be participant with you I
[1:17:35] realize this is my weak spot help me God
[1:17:38] is going to do that is God doing the
[1:17:40] work amen but you work in collaboration
[1:17:42] with him
[1:17:44] says that's the next foundation wall now
[1:17:47] first you must have faith faith alone
[1:17:50] won't do it. You've got Peter say then
[1:17:53] add virtue to your faith. You must have
[1:17:55] virtue in order to add it to your faith.
[1:17:58] Amen. Because this is a promise. Amen.
[1:18:01] You must faith alone cannot do that. We
[1:18:03] know what the scripture says that this
[1:18:05] faith say you know you can have such
[1:18:09] faith you can move mountains and
[1:18:11] different things but you don't have
[1:18:13] charity profit nothing. We know that
[1:18:15] scripture. Amen. We know that the in end
[1:18:18] time there will be people say Lord Lord
[1:18:20] Lord haven't we prophesied and they cast
[1:18:23] out devils and all different things.
[1:18:25] Yeah there is one side where people
[1:18:27] didn't have the true foundation. They
[1:18:29] didn't have the new birth. They didn't
[1:18:31] have the true revelation. I mean they
[1:18:33] will be doing miracles. That's why we
[1:18:35] don't base our faith upon miracles.
[1:18:37] Yeah. That's one side. Amen. People will
[1:18:40] be doing things and but still if they're
[1:18:42] not true and right in their heart
[1:18:44] there's something missing and that's not
[1:18:45] what we are talking about. It's not only
[1:18:48] doing miracles for the sake of doing
[1:18:49] miracles. That's not what we are talking
[1:18:51] about. But when you have a true heart,
[1:18:55] when you have a true faith, when you are
[1:18:58] born again, Amen. these things are not
[1:19:01] optional. They have a reality. Amen. In
[1:19:04] our church, we believe in a miracle of
[1:19:07] God and God still performing miracles.
[1:19:10] Amen. Amen. You yourself, you are a
[1:19:13] greatest miracle. Amen. God saved you
[1:19:16] from the pit of hell and took you from
[1:19:18] that place, that's the greatest miracle.
[1:19:20] Amen. If God can take you from the pit
[1:19:23] of hell, from where you were and put you
[1:19:25] and make you a Christians, how little
[1:19:27] are those other things that he cannot
[1:19:29] do? Amen. Is the same God.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:42] Where am I?
[1:19:46] The power of God is not optional. It's a
[1:19:48] must. The mechanic without the dynamic,
[1:19:53] without the virtue is not enough. We
[1:19:55] need both. That's why Paul said in 1
[1:19:59] Thessalonian 15, for our gospel came
[1:20:02] out, came not unto you in word only, but
[1:20:06] also in power and in the Holy Ghost and
[1:20:09] in much assurance as you know what
[1:20:11] manner of man we were among you for your
[1:20:14] sake. Amen. The message did not come
[1:20:17] only for eloquence or theology of creeds
[1:20:20] or dogma. It came with divine power as
[1:20:24] the evidence of the Holy Spirit at work
[1:20:27] changing our heart, delivering us from
[1:20:29] sin and sometimes confirmed by signs and
[1:20:32] wonders. Amen. It's still the same God.
[1:20:35] As Paul said in his ministry, he says in
[1:20:38] Romans 15:4, I will not dare to speak of
[1:20:41] any of these things which Christ had not
[1:20:44] brought by me to make the Gentiles
[1:20:47] obedient by word and deed through mighty
[1:20:50] signs and wonders by the power of the
[1:20:53] spirit of God. So that from Jerusalem
[1:20:56] and roundabout into into all the place I
[1:20:59] have fully preached the gospel of
[1:21:01] Christ. The prophet in the statue of
[1:21:03] perfect prophet man is talking about the
[1:21:04] virtue says virtue anyone knows what the
[1:21:08] word virtue means we must have it. If
[1:21:11] virtue went from him to heal the woman
[1:21:13] that was sick is expecting the same
[1:21:16] virtue in his church because he was our
[1:21:19] example.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, who is expecting that? God is
[1:21:23] expecting the same virtue in the church
[1:21:26] as Jesus Christ has the same virtue.
[1:21:28] Amen.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he had virtue to give to the
[1:21:32] people, God expects us to have virtue to
[1:21:36] give to the people. Amen. We must have
[1:21:39] virtue to give to the people. We must be
[1:21:41] in the channel to for God to use us to
[1:21:43] give virtue to the people. Amen. What is
[1:21:45] virtue? Virtue is strength, is power.
[1:21:48] Some of them didn't even believe in the
[1:21:50] power of God. They say that pastor the
[1:21:53] only thing you have to do is just put
[1:21:55] your name on the book and be sprinkled
[1:21:57] and paused and baptized and whatever.
[1:22:00] That's all you have to do. So that's the
[1:22:01] problem. Some people don't even believe
[1:22:03] in the power of God. They just want to
[1:22:05] know you're part of the list. You're
[1:22:06] part of the church. That's it. Amen.
[1:22:08] You're part of restored word and that
[1:22:10] it. Amen. You make your attendance.
[1:22:11] That's it. Amen. You pay your tithes and
[1:22:13] offerings. That's it. No, that's not
[1:22:15] enough. Amen. You need to be born again
[1:22:17] and you need to have the power of God.
[1:22:19] Amen. God is expecting us to have the
[1:22:22] virtue of God to in order to transfer
[1:22:25] that to another person. Let me say this,
[1:22:27] without the power, we are just a
[1:22:28] denomination. Without the power of God
[1:22:31] among us, we are just like any other
[1:22:33] denomination. It's just any like any
[1:22:35] other school of theologian. We will be
[1:22:38] knowing God. We be knowing different
[1:22:40] things. But we need the power of God. We
[1:22:42] don't want only the form of godliness.
[1:22:45] We want the power of God in our midst.
[1:22:47] Amen.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; So when you come to church, come
[1:22:51] expecting, I'm going to the church
[1:22:54] because God is going to work and do
[1:22:56] mighty things. Amen. God is still the
[1:22:58] same there. It's still the same
[1:23:00] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Don't belittle God. Don't leave on your
[1:23:05] privileges. I am a believer. Amen. As we
[1:23:08] sung at the beginning, Lord, I believe
[1:23:10] nothing is impossible to you. Nothing is
[1:23:13] impossible to you. You have a you have a
[1:23:15] low account balance, God can provide.
[1:23:18] Amen. your your your children are sick,
[1:23:20] God can provide. You don't have
[1:23:22] children, God can provide. Amen. My wife
[1:23:24] and I, we didn't have children for many
[1:23:26] years. Amen. And then we go to the
[1:23:28] church, we get prayed, we have children.
[1:23:30] Amen. She doesn't even want to have
[1:23:32] more. Amen. Think about it. We were
[1:23:36] crying for them. Now she doesn't want
[1:23:38] anymore.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; It's still the same God. Amen.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:50] Now what is the question now? How can
[1:23:52] someone get the virtue of God? How can
[1:23:55] someone get the power of God? I believe
[1:23:57] it's a good question to ask ourself.
[1:24:01] We touched you already it in the past
[1:24:03] and I can to receive and walk in the
[1:24:05] power of God or virtue of God. It's not
[1:24:08] about emotions. It's not about hype.
[1:24:10] It's not about works. But I believe it's
[1:24:12] about surrender and having faith and
[1:24:16] believing in the dwelling of the Holy
[1:24:18] Spirit.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Probably we summarize it and I'll be
[1:24:21] closing already.
[1:24:24] Didn't develop it too much but I might
[1:24:27] be closing but I still have something to
[1:24:29] mention that before we go there says I
[1:24:31] preached a sermon about 20 years ago I
[1:24:33] guess on Reverend Mr. Lily. Lily the
[1:24:36] pastor took it from the text where Jesus
[1:24:39] said, "Consider the lily how they
[1:24:41] neither toil nor spin. Yet I say unto
[1:24:43] you, Solomon in all his glory is not a
[1:24:46] red like one." Look at the lily. It
[1:24:48] comes from way down in the m and every
[1:24:51] minute of the day it has to be drawing
[1:24:53] from the earth.
[1:24:55] What does it do with the virtue that it
[1:24:58] draws? It gives it out. Amen. It makes a
[1:25:01] beautiful sight of for the admirer.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the lily
[1:25:08] that nice very comparison here says for
[1:25:11] the May it open up itself for honey for
[1:25:14] the bee to come and get his part. Don't
[1:25:16] they don't complain it just got it and
[1:25:19] give it out. What if the bee come in
[1:25:21] there in suff and it is insufficient
[1:25:25] funds no honey that little bee will
[1:25:28] scratch his head and say what kind of a
[1:25:30] lily is that?
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:34] That's right.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Many principles from Dr. Lily.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; We can get it from
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; first is getting from the earth.
[1:25:42] But first thing he has to be a lily.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; You can't ask that from a cocoa bar and
[1:25:47] other thing. First thing he has to be a
[1:25:49] lily.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; So how can I have virtue? First thing
[1:25:52] you have to be a lily.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; First thing you have to be transformed.
[1:25:56] First thing you have to be changed.
[1:25:58] First thing you have to be born again.
[1:26:01] First thing you have to have the
[1:26:03] personal revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:05] Otherwise, you are not a lily. You're
[1:26:07] just trying to put up something and the
[1:26:09] be will recognize that there is nothing
[1:26:11] there. It's not a lily. So, I can't even
[1:26:14] go and waste my time there. That what
[1:26:16] not what we want. We want to be true
[1:26:18] lilies. Amen. God transform me from the
[1:26:21] inside. Amen. From the inside to have
[1:26:24] the nature of Jesus Christ. That's why
[1:26:26] the new birth is so important. Amen. It
[1:26:29] a master. Eat the master. How can you
[1:26:31] have the Holy Ghost? Stay with the word
[1:26:33] of God. Believe the word of God. You are
[1:26:36] being born by the in
[1:27:33] Thank you brother.
[1:27:38] Thank you.
[1:27:43] So the first thing Yeah. It's the first
[1:27:45] thing you first thing you have to be
[1:27:46] born again. It has to be it has to be
[1:27:48] the new birth that change your mind your
[1:27:50] ideas. that the greatest miracle that
[1:27:52] God and you have to be willing to yield
[1:27:55] to God say God it's not my will it's
[1:27:57] your will
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; when you will perform it it's not me
[1:28:01] want it but you will perform let me be
[1:28:03] just be yielding to you Lord let me be
[1:28:06] stay in the channel where you can use me
[1:28:08] power doesn't come for selfish reasons
[1:28:11] no I will do that they see that I'm a
[1:28:13] powerful minister so I'm I'm a powerful
[1:28:15] Christians oh I can heal the sick and no
[1:28:17] that's not that God is not going to
[1:28:19] that's not the true power you on. But
[1:28:21] when you are humble, when you are
[1:28:22] simple, when you are healing to God,
[1:28:24] that's when the God is going to fill you
[1:28:26] with the Holy Spirit. The more you empty
[1:28:28] yourself, the more God is going to fill
[1:28:30] you. Amen. In fact, God is willing to
[1:28:33] fill us more than we are willing to
[1:28:35] accept it. Amen. So if we just heal
[1:28:37] oursel, humble oursel, God is more than
[1:28:40] powerful to heal fill us with the Holy
[1:28:42] Spirit. And the Holy Spirit comes with
[1:28:44] power. Amen. The promise is but you
[1:28:46] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[1:28:50] has come upon you. Amen. If you have the
[1:28:53] true Holy Spirit as I've been
[1:28:54] encouraging you, let me tell you God can
[1:28:57] fill you with his power. Amen. Now you
[1:28:59] have to receive the power of God because
[1:29:01] it's there. It's available. The prophet
[1:29:03] says in the Holy Ghost given voice says
[1:29:06] I'm was talking on power of prayer,
[1:29:08] power of speech, power for holy life.
[1:29:11] That's what the Holy Ghost is to do.
[1:29:13] Some of you people walking around
[1:29:15] saying, "Well, I can't quit drinking. I
[1:29:17] can't quit this." The Holy Spirit comes
[1:29:20] to live in you to make all these can't
[1:29:23] get away from you. Amen.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; So, when you have the Holy Ghost, there
[1:29:26] is no excuse. You can't say, "I can't
[1:29:29] get rid of this. I can't get rid of
[1:29:30] smoking. I can't get rid rid of lust. I
[1:29:33] can't get rid of of pornography. I can't
[1:29:35] get rid of all the different bad
[1:29:37] things." When you have the Holy Ghost,
[1:29:38] he can clean you. He can wash you. He
[1:29:41] can take all these things away. Amen.
[1:29:43] Because God is real. It's not you
[1:29:46] forcing yourself. It's the Holy Ghost
[1:29:48] living inside of you. Living his own
[1:29:50] life. Amen.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; It's still real, brothers and sisters.
[1:29:53] How many believe that? Amen.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; I'm going to emphasize on the power of
[1:29:57] the Holy Ghost because it's God himself.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "That's right. Make
[1:30:03] women stop cutting the hair. Make them
[1:30:05] quit wearing shorts and slacks. You have
[1:30:08] no excuse. make them quit tattling,
[1:30:11] gossiping. It make them quit those
[1:30:13] things. Yes, that's what it is for to
[1:30:15] make you a holy life. It will follow the
[1:30:18] instructions of the Bible every time.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; I believe the Holy Ghost comes to give
[1:30:24] us holy life.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Holy life is not only for the Methodist,
[1:30:28] of the Amish.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Holy life is for the believers, too.
[1:30:32] Amen.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; It's not old school. It's still part of
[1:30:35] the pyramid. Amen. You want to go higher
[1:30:37] with God, you need to have virtue. You
[1:30:39] need to have Holy Ghost. You need to
[1:30:41] have the power of God to give you a holy
[1:30:43] life. Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is the source of power
[1:30:48] for the believer. Power to live holy,
[1:30:51] power to witness for God, power to
[1:30:53] overcome sin, power to even minister
[1:30:56] with gift. Amen.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; We can't just rely on the gift or this
[1:31:00] one is eloquent person is the one can
[1:31:01] put things together. This one can you
[1:31:03] know intellectual things. No, we need
[1:31:05] the power of God.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; We need the leadership of God. Amen.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to put few minutes here. It's
[1:31:16] not my emphasis, but let me just put him
[1:31:18] in talking about holy life. Prophet
[1:31:21] paragraph 143. He says,
[1:31:24] such of perfect man talking about
[1:31:26] virtue. You know, it's good to read. I
[1:31:28] hope it's okay when we're going through
[1:31:30] a study, we go through and read the
[1:31:33] message. sometimes go paragraph or
[1:31:35] paragraph a little bit. I think it's
[1:31:37] okay. Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be a church where you
[1:31:40] see one paragraph, oh, let's skip that
[1:31:42] paragraph. It's going to hurt that
[1:31:44] brother. It's going to hurt that sister.
[1:31:46] No, let's keep that one. No. Maybe
[1:31:49] another minister can preach. Not me.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; That's not the kind of church we want to
[1:31:54] be. No, no, no, no. Amen. What the
[1:31:56] prophet says, we read it and we say it.
[1:31:58] We comment upon it. Amen.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; That's what we desire. Amen. Because we
[1:32:01] desire the whole word of God. We don't
[1:32:04] want the partial truth. We want the
[1:32:05] whole truth.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "Write these that
[1:32:13] knocks a lot of us." Right? There knocks
[1:32:17] a lot of us down. Yes, sir. Yet add
[1:32:19] virtue to your faith. It does it doesn't
[1:32:23] just mean living a virgin life, you
[1:32:25] know, like the woman or woman and so
[1:32:27] forth. It doesn't have nothing to do
[1:32:30] with that. It's very good. Amen. It's
[1:32:32] not only all the virgin life. It's
[1:32:34] beyond that. Oh, a clean life. It's
[1:32:37] beyond that. Amen. It is like like a man
[1:32:40] or woman. It's beyond that because it's
[1:32:42] the power of God that you can transfer
[1:32:44] to someone else.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; But notice as well as mentioned that say
[1:32:48] it doesn't just mean. It means it means
[1:32:52] to.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; It includes to
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; but it's more than that. Amen.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes as I what I've done and
[1:33:01] so far I have included what is more than
[1:33:05] that
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; but it also includes that.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; How many agree with me?
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; It includes this but it also includes
[1:33:13] this the power of God the Holy Spirit
[1:33:16] the miracles and other things but don't
[1:33:19] skip where it also includes here.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; We need also a holy life. Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; That's why we emphasize on holy life,
[1:33:28] virgin life. Amen.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; We emphasize on the young people. Live
[1:33:33] clean.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Live clean before your marriage. Live
[1:33:36] clean. Amen.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Live clean until marriage. Amen.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Very thing. It's important. You have to
[1:33:42] live clean. You have to stay yourself
[1:33:44] clean. Says for both like man and woman.
[1:33:47] We don't believe in proximity whatever
[1:33:50] they call it and different things. No,
[1:33:52] you live clean. You stay clean. Clean.
[1:33:55] Clean in the body. Clean in your mind.
[1:33:57] Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; You can't be there and know I'm a church
[1:33:59] believer and in the night you're on
[1:34:01] internet and watching bad things and and
[1:34:03] you come to church, you expect virtue.
[1:34:05] There's no it's actually drawing your
[1:34:07] virtue. After you spend so much things
[1:34:09] on internet, you can't pray anymore. You
[1:34:12] can't even read the word of God. You you
[1:34:14] feel yourself so dirty. Amen.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it has pulled your virtue
[1:34:18] out of it.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; But you know, put those things aside.
[1:34:22] There is no excuse when you have the
[1:34:24] Holy Ghost. If you don't have if you
[1:34:26] don't have the power to overcome those
[1:34:28] things, come we will pray together. We
[1:34:30] won't judge you. We won't put you down.
[1:34:32] When we went through that as a young
[1:34:33] people as well, we suffered and the
[1:34:35] different things. Amen. But but but
[1:34:37] there is power. Amen. We don't want to
[1:34:39] let you down and you struggle with that
[1:34:40] and you become when they start preaching
[1:34:43] you are your mind is somewhere else. No,
[1:34:46] that's miserable. Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; And sometimes adult too. married people
[1:34:52] and that was still wasting their time in
[1:34:54] those dirty things. Where can you find
[1:34:57] virtue in the church like that?
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; You need a clean life, a pure life, your
[1:35:03] clean mind. Amen.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; If you like me, let me just mention a
[1:35:15] few things you on that on that aspect.
[1:35:17] Amen. Is it okay? Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; It's good to talk about those things
[1:35:21] when there is no problem.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; It's a small church, right? If there is
[1:35:25] a problem in the church and it's only
[1:35:26] one person. If I talk about this,
[1:35:28] everybody will be like
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; he's talking about her and they skip
[1:35:35] that sometimes themselves. But it's good
[1:35:38] to talk about those things when there's
[1:35:39] no problem. Amen.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:47] So that's just mean living a virgin life
[1:35:50] you know like the man and the woman
[1:35:57] don't be quiet on me now
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; the prophet was told on him don't drink
[1:36:04] don't smoke do not defile your body for
[1:36:08] there will be a work for you to do when
[1:36:10] you get older it's not just some things.
[1:36:12] So no, it it was for the prophet, but
[1:36:15] the prophet was an example.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; So an example so that the new generation
[1:36:21] that comes, they have an example that
[1:36:24] they can follow. Oh, as the prophet was
[1:36:27] the the wave shift now our children now
[1:36:30] ourselves now we follow the wave shift.
[1:36:32] Don't defile your body in any way any no
[1:36:36] drink, no no smoking, no defile your
[1:36:38] word, not your your your body with
[1:36:40] women. Don't defy that because you have
[1:36:43] a work that God want to do with you when
[1:36:45] you get older.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible is actually emphasizing on
[1:36:50] that. Pro Paul says, "For this is the
[1:36:52] will of God, even your sanctification
[1:36:55] that you should abstain from fornication
[1:36:57] that every one of you should know how to
[1:37:00] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[1:37:03] honor. Every one of you, amen, including
[1:37:06] men, including women, amen, including
[1:37:09] girls, everyone should, you should keep
[1:37:12] his vessel clean for sanctification and
[1:37:15] honor. God want to use your body to
[1:37:18] convey virtue to others. Amen. So at a
[1:37:21] very young age, we want you to stay
[1:37:23] clean until you get married, you stay
[1:37:25] clean. Amen. Even when you are married,
[1:37:28] actually, you still am clean. Amen. You
[1:37:30] are allowed to do things when you're
[1:37:31] married. But even there you prophet
[1:37:33] rebuke things that were happening. Oh
[1:37:35] minister, I can see things dirty things.
[1:37:36] What's going on? Who are reading those
[1:37:39] dirty books and blah blah blah. What's
[1:37:41] what going on? And you call yourself
[1:37:43] Christians. So women
[1:37:47] hey
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; stay clean.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Free fornication. Every sin that a man
[1:37:54] doeth is without the body. For he that
[1:37:56] committed fornication sinnth against his
[1:37:58] own body. You are not your own. For you
[1:38:01] are bought with a price. Therefore
[1:38:02] glorify God in your body. Not only in
[1:38:06] your spirit but also in your body.
[1:38:09] Dedicate your body to God. As a young
[1:38:12] girl, as a young boy, I'm dedicating my
[1:38:14] whole things to God. My mind, my soul,
[1:38:18] my body for God. Amen.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Don't put it and use it for divide
[1:38:22] different things. Amen. 1 Corinthians
[1:38:24] 6:13:20
[1:38:26] says, "Meat for the belly and the belly
[1:38:28] for the meat. For God shall destroy both
[1:38:30] of it and do now the body is not for
[1:38:32] fornication, but for the Lord, and the
[1:38:34] Lord for the body." God had both raised
[1:38:36] up the Lord, and we also raised up us
[1:38:39] for his own power. Know ye not that your
[1:38:41] bodies are the temple of Christ? Shall I
[1:38:44] then take the members of Christ and make
[1:38:46] them the members of a harlot? God
[1:38:48] forbid.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. Amen. What know you know
[1:38:53] that which is joined to a heart is one
[1:38:56] body for two hair he say shall be one
[1:38:59] flesh but he that's joined unto the Lord
[1:39:01] is one spirit then it says flee
[1:39:03] fornication that's what we read earlier
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; for married people now concerning the
[1:39:09] things whereof I wrote unto you it is
[1:39:11] good for a man not to touch a woman
[1:39:13] nevertheless to avoid fornication let
[1:39:15] every man have his own wife and let
[1:39:18] every woman have her own husband Man,
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; not
[1:39:23] every man have his own wives.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Here we have one here. You go here, you
[1:39:31] have another one, you go there, another
[1:39:32] one. And so you call yourself
[1:39:34] Christians. Oh,
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; no, no, no, no, no, no. That uh
[1:39:38] whatever.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; You don't even have the faith to begin
[1:39:42] with.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; One man, one wife.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Not multiple partners.
[1:39:50] One man, one wife.
[1:39:53] Oh, but now I'm living under grace. No,
[1:39:55] it's a grace. God forgives me and
[1:39:57] everything. And no, no, no, no, no.
[1:40:00] Grace is actually more demanding than
[1:40:02] the law.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; God is more strict under grace than the
[1:40:06] law. Why? Because grace gives you the
[1:40:09] power to overcome those things.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Law didn't give you the power, just give
[1:40:13] you instructions and if you do it and
[1:40:16] then they put you in jail. But grace
[1:40:18] gives you the power to overcome. Lord, I
[1:40:20] can't do. I'm still struggling this. But
[1:40:22] oh Lord, help me to deliver here. Help
[1:40:25] me, Lord. And God will give you the
[1:40:27] virtue to overcome. The power to
[1:40:30] overcome. Amen.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; It is available. It is available. Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; So even though grace offers forgiveness
[1:40:38] or mercy, it also calls to for a higher
[1:40:42] level of holiness because it deals with
[1:40:44] the inside of a person, not just the
[1:40:47] outside. That's why Jesus said, "You
[1:40:50] shall you have heard that was said by
[1:40:52] Matthew 5, you have heard that was said
[1:40:54] by them of old time that they shall not
[1:40:56] commit adultery. But I say unto you that
[1:40:58] whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust
[1:41:01] after her and committed adultery with
[1:41:03] her already in his in his heart. Amen.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; So adultery is not in the law. The
[1:41:11] adultery was only a physical thing.
[1:41:13] Amen. It was only an outward art. But
[1:41:17] now grace breeding to another level
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; or now I'm bringing to another because
[1:41:21] you have the you have the power. Not to
[1:41:22] you but God gives you that power. Now
[1:41:25] it's not oh no I'm clean, you I've never
[1:41:27] we all clean everything. Oh, brother
[1:41:29] Madame came with that that with that
[1:41:31] argument before God, right?
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Says, you know, no God, you know, the
[1:41:35] only thing I could bring to you, Lord,
[1:41:36] I've never defiled my body with any
[1:41:38] other woman
[1:41:40] when he was in hell.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Did he save him from there? No. Amen.
[1:41:45] You need the Holy Ghost.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; You need the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; So, it's it's another level. It's not
[1:41:52] it's not only that. If you look only at
[1:41:54] a woman,
[1:41:56] we see so many naked women, right?
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; It's summer. You see so many naked
[1:42:01] sometimes you can glimpse on someone
[1:42:04] stays for a little for a moment in your
[1:42:06] mind. Bab had the cross. If you see like
[1:42:09] that, look at the cross,
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; the prophet of God,
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; he had he was meeting the angels. He was
[1:42:17] he was talking with the angels. But but
[1:42:20] do you think that he didn't need that
[1:42:21] the grace of God to change his mind
[1:42:23] because the enemy could stay on his
[1:42:25] mind? A prophet of God. How much more
[1:42:26] you and I?
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; He was prophet of God. We married and
[1:42:31] everything but the enemy can still try
[1:42:34] to men on your mind. So don't stay. You
[1:42:37] see that? Move your head right away.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Don't I didn't see properly.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; No virtue. Amen.
[1:42:51] Amen. Because once you do that, grace
[1:42:54] says, "No, it's already adultery." On
[1:42:57] the day of judgment, you will you will
[1:42:59] answer for that.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:04] That's not legalism.
[1:43:07] It's a call to a higher holiness. Amen.
[1:43:11] The Holy Ghost come to call us for
[1:43:13] higher holy ghost.
[1:43:17] So if the Bible says once you just look
[1:43:20] at it a woman last committ of adultery
[1:43:23] her in her heart now you are there on
[1:43:26] the internet and dirty things how many
[1:43:28] adulteries you are committing
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; think about it
[1:43:34] and you have answer for that on the day
[1:43:35] of judgment
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; it is taking virtue out of you it's not
[1:43:40] your wife it's not your husband stay
[1:43:43] away from them it's someone else husband
[1:43:46] It's someone else wife. Amen. It's not
[1:43:49] your wife. It's not your husband.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; And if you're struggling with it, like I
[1:43:52] said, I don't want to judge you. Ask for
[1:43:55] prayer
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; because the son of God can set you free.
[1:43:59] Is it okay this evening this morning?
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; The son of man can set you free. And if
[1:44:04] those who are looking are committing
[1:44:06] adultery, it goes also further. If you
[1:44:08] dress yourself sexy, if you dress
[1:44:12] yourself like that, no matter father th
[1:44:16] no matter how modest you think it is,
[1:44:18] and go out on the street and some old
[1:44:21] sinner looks at you to last after you at
[1:44:24] the judgment bar, you will be guilty of
[1:44:26] committing adultery that man when he
[1:44:29] answers for it. So it was you. Why is
[1:44:32] it? It was you was the one done it. You
[1:44:34] presented yourself that way. You are
[1:44:37] guilty that way. And you, no matter how
[1:44:39] virgin and pure you have lived, you will
[1:44:42] be guilty before God of committing
[1:44:44] adultery with a sinner just the same as
[1:44:47] you went through the act Jesus said. So
[1:44:49] that's not ski milk, brother. That's the
[1:44:52] truth.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; It's barbered wire, prophet says. But
[1:44:56] it's what God's word says. It cuts. It's
[1:44:58] sharper than two edges. But I believe
[1:45:00] it's the word of God.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; And the kingdom of God, there won't be
[1:45:03] wararmongers. They won't be adulterous
[1:45:05] because God will judge them. Amen.
[1:45:07] That's why you need to keep your mind
[1:45:09] clean
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; and you need to dress properly. Amen.
[1:45:13] You don't want to be you don't want to
[1:45:15] be a victim of different things. You
[1:45:17] know sometimes I ask my I think my wife
[1:45:19] is you to check how you dress. I want to
[1:45:22] be on that day to be the only husband. I
[1:45:24] don't want to be there and meet 10 other
[1:45:27] people you are not aware that you are
[1:45:30] answering for those things. No. Dress
[1:45:32] properly clean. Amen. You're only one
[1:45:35] wife, only one husband. Amen.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Oldtimers know those things. But the new
[1:45:43] generation that's coming up, we need to
[1:45:45] emphasize on those things well
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; so that they know that that's the
[1:45:49] standard of the message.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; That's the standard of the word of God.
[1:45:52] That the standard that bring us to the
[1:45:54] capstone. Amen.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Women and women coming up. And this man,
[1:46:01] another topic, this man kissing these
[1:46:04] women's don't you keep away from that.
[1:46:06] You remember she's young, single,
[1:46:09] whatever she is, she'll be somebody's
[1:46:11] wife someday.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Oh no, we are Christians and love and
[1:46:16] everything that come.
[1:46:19] Praise be to God. It's it's a how do you
[1:46:21] call it? Holy kiss.
[1:46:31] Amen.
[1:46:34] the the kiss in the old the Bible
[1:46:36] they're talking they were giving man to
[1:46:38] a man on the neck or
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; it's not on the lips it's not even on
[1:46:43] the cheeks and no
[1:46:46] stand don't don't we don't want I know
[1:46:48] that I'm it's easy to talk about these
[1:46:50] things because there's nothing right if
[1:46:51] there was something then everybody will
[1:46:53] be pointing it's good to talk about
[1:46:55] these things but that's the standard
[1:46:56] that we are talking about virtue it's
[1:46:59] not only about this
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; it takes more than that there is also So
[1:47:03] virtue can convey but don't neglect what
[1:47:06] is also this. Amen.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; The this is here is you have to have a
[1:47:10] clean life. No touching, no no kissing
[1:47:16] until marriage. The first time a man
[1:47:20] kisses you on the lips. It has to be
[1:47:22] when the pastor is said now you are
[1:47:25] married. You can kiss your wife. First
[1:47:28] time you kiss that wife, that girl man.
[1:47:31] Not before we are now engaged. I mean I
[1:47:34] know that he's going to be my he has
[1:47:35] nowhere to go. So now I can do whatever
[1:47:37] there. No no no no no no no no no until
[1:47:40] otherwise otherwise Mary would not will
[1:47:43] not be ashamed to be with Joseph. They
[1:47:45] were already engaged.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; But even though they were engaged they
[1:47:49] could not leave life as married. Amen.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; So if you haven't got no business doing
[1:47:58] that stay away from her. If you want to
[1:48:01] greet her, then be a son of God. Shake
[1:48:03] her hand and say, "How do you do,
[1:48:05] sister?" Let that settle it right there.
[1:48:08] Stay away from those things. It's filth.
[1:48:11] It will soon get you into trouble. Amen.
[1:48:13] Sin is so easy. It's so appetizing and
[1:48:16] so pleasant. It's so easy to fall into
[1:48:19] right into it. The best thing to do is a
[1:48:21] very the to do is the very even
[1:48:25] appearance of it. Stay away from it.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Get back. be a real Christian
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; for a man kissing one another. If you
[1:48:33] kiss your brother on the neck and you
[1:48:34] want to do it, that's all right. Don't
[1:48:36] kiss no man in the lips on the mouth or
[1:48:38] anything like that because that's not
[1:48:40] right. That shows there is a little
[1:48:42] something wrong to begin with. Just so
[1:48:45] stay away from their shand that don't
[1:48:48] start that around this tabernacle here.
[1:48:51] They will certainly won't stand for that
[1:48:54] at all. If you want to see your brother,
[1:48:56] if you want to kiss him on the neck,
[1:48:58] well, go ahead and do it. But don't kiss
[1:49:01] people in the mouth because that won't
[1:49:03] work. That's not right. It only starts a
[1:49:06] perversion. It starts homosexuals and
[1:49:08] things like that. And we don't want
[1:49:10] that. Respect distance from one another,
[1:49:13] sister. Respect the distances. Amen.
[1:49:16] Avoid temptation. Don't
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; The Bible is talking about youth who
[1:49:22] lust. The youth are going through
[1:49:24] different things and the youth will last
[1:49:26] and different things. You stay away from
[1:49:28] any appearance of sin. Amen. That's how
[1:49:31] you will stay virtuous. Amen.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Because any kiss is actually potential
[1:49:37] committing adultery. Amen. You all know
[1:49:40] that.
[1:49:42] Praise be to God.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; That was my parenthesis. I closed it
[1:49:48] there. I can move on. We'll be closing
[1:49:50] now.
[1:49:53] I'm closing long closing.
[1:50:00] Glory to God. Glory to God. Let's give a
[1:50:02] hand hand to the Lord. Amen.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; It's not always easy to preach a cutting
[1:50:12] message, but
[1:50:15] the old-timers know that. then you we
[1:50:18] live to that and then so they know that
[1:50:20] it's good to just repeat that.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; So the gospel another thing so how can
[1:50:29] you receive the virtue of God one thing
[1:50:32] and that is one of the important thing
[1:50:35] in order to receive the virtue of God
[1:50:38] you must feed on the word of God.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Because man shall not live by bread
[1:50:43] alone but by every word. The Bible says
[1:50:46] Paul says or John says the word Jesus
[1:50:48] said the words that I speak unto you
[1:50:50] they are spirit and life. The word of
[1:50:52] God is alive and powerful. When you
[1:50:54] believe it and live by it, it produces
[1:50:57] power in your life. The message is just
[1:51:00] not information. The message is not just
[1:51:04] a bunch of instructions. It's actually a
[1:51:06] life. It has power. It's a living power.
[1:51:10] It reveals the truth. It exposes the
[1:51:12] motive. It exposes intent of the heart.
[1:51:14] But it also has the power to change you.
[1:51:17] Amen. Salvation is here. What is
[1:51:20] salvation? Salvation is deliverance from
[1:51:22] sin, deliverance from from unbelief,
[1:51:25] from guilt, from death, deliverance from
[1:51:27] diseases and sicknesses. And we have
[1:51:30] received the word of God, which is the
[1:51:32] power of God unto salvation. As Paul
[1:51:36] said, I'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:51:38] Christ, for it is the power of God unto
[1:51:41] salvation. Amen.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; You want to have the power, you need to
[1:51:44] take the word of God and feed upon the
[1:51:47] word of God. The more you feed upon the
[1:51:50] word of God, the more you become the
[1:51:52] word of God. The more you receive the
[1:51:54] dynamics, the more you receive the power
[1:51:56] of God. Amen. Oh, it can't just No, I I
[1:51:59] just I can't be I can't feed upon the
[1:52:01] weather. I can't go to church, but I
[1:52:03] just want to have the dynamics. Somehow
[1:52:05] God is going to send me the dynamics.
[1:52:07] No, no, no, no. You need to be staying
[1:52:09] in the channel of God, feeding upon the
[1:52:11] word of God, praying. Amen. God is going
[1:52:14] to give you the power for deliverance.
[1:52:16] One day, whatever you're struggling
[1:52:18] with, God can just deliver you from that
[1:52:20] because you have been in the power of
[1:52:22] God. We have been in the word of God.
[1:52:24] Amen. The message of the eye doesn't
[1:52:26] just tell you about salvation. It causes
[1:52:30] salvation to happen in your life. Amen.
[1:52:32] Deliverance to happen in your life.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. The problem where we
[1:52:37] are struggling with let me tell you as I
[1:52:39] will be closing the problem that we are
[1:52:42] we are struggling with we listen to so
[1:52:44] many other voices
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; we spend our time in so many other
[1:52:49] voices
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; but let as we heard this morning we need
[1:52:52] that sound we need to listen to that
[1:52:55] sound
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; we need to hear the voice of God
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; I'm encouraging you young people and old
[1:53:01] and myself let's stay in the word of God
[1:53:05] let listen to the Word of God. Amen.
[1:53:07] Let's stay in the child of God. That's
[1:53:09] where is the power. We cannot live under
[1:53:12] our privileges. There is power in the
[1:53:14] message of the hour. Amen.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Our elders have done great things with
[1:53:20] the message of the hour. Without the
[1:53:22] support of denominations. Amen. Is this
[1:53:24] the same God today? Amen. Can do the
[1:53:27] same thing and continue to do the same
[1:53:28] thing with us. Amen. The problem we
[1:53:31] listen to so many voices. The prophet
[1:53:33] said there are so many voices on earth
[1:53:35] today. That is absolutely a hard thing
[1:53:38] because it deadens. It means it kills
[1:53:40] the voice of the supernatural.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Now we don't give influence to the
[1:53:45] supernatural anymore. We check on
[1:53:47] Googles. We check on we check on
[1:53:49] different things intellectual. It it's
[1:53:52] killing the voice of the supernatural.
[1:53:54] It's killing the voice of the power of
[1:53:56] God. Amen. But let me tell you the word
[1:53:58] of God has not changed.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; The word of God cannot be corrupted. The
[1:54:02] gate of God cannot be old mana. It's
[1:54:04] still fresh today. It's still real
[1:54:06] today. Amen.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Can I just read a little bit and give me
[1:54:09] a little bit of favor this morning?
[1:54:11] There is a great prophet says there is a
[1:54:13] voice today in the world of politics.
[1:54:14] There is a great voice people absolutely
[1:54:17] in this great day of politics. It's all
[1:54:19] mixed up in their churches and
[1:54:20] everything. And many times we have seen
[1:54:22] recently that the voice of politics is
[1:54:25] actually stronger than the voice of God
[1:54:27] in the church. Oh, the American people
[1:54:30] will not never did it that they just
[1:54:31] did. What it means so many voices.
[1:54:36] Voice of politics. What did Trump say?
[1:54:38] What did Carney say? What voice of
[1:54:41] influencers,
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; YouTube influencers? Or let me check on
[1:54:45] this one. Hey,
[1:54:47] but there is also something nice you,
[1:54:52] you know, it's getting harder to take
[1:54:53] just 30 minutes of your time.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Just to read,
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; read this and I'm going to pray about
[1:55:00] this 30 minutes.
[1:55:03] But you'll find yourself in YouTube. You
[1:55:06] listen there one hour, two hours
[1:55:11] and then you come to church, you want
[1:55:13] virtue
[1:55:15] full of all the different things. Amen.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; God help us to give you a little bit of
[1:55:19] time.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, praise be help me Lord. Oh I
[1:55:23] love this. We will see God working
[1:55:26] mighty things.
[1:55:30] could go over and over but
[1:55:32] prophet says
[1:55:34] and this is what
[1:55:37] says my dear brother and sister the
[1:55:39] morals of this nation has become so low
[1:55:41] till it will make a dog ashamed it will
[1:55:44] make a a hound blush if if it could do
[1:55:47] so the immorals of our people the people
[1:55:50] even years ago the things that we have
[1:55:52] the nations have done the things that
[1:55:53] the people have done what what is it
[1:55:55] it's all the lack of prayer the church
[1:55:58] that used to didn't believe in picture
[1:56:00] shows. They didn't let the children go
[1:56:02] to picture shows. They will shan picture
[1:56:04] show. And today why they even have they
[1:56:07] have the picture show in their in the
[1:56:09] house. Every house has a television.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Every house spend time in in in in those
[1:56:16] phones. You go in the house and
[1:56:17] everybody's on the phone and they're
[1:56:19] watching and everything. It's killing
[1:56:21] our time. It's killing it's pulling our
[1:56:24] virtue out of us.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:29] says you think the thing that they has
[1:56:30] done for us, how it has lifted us from
[1:56:33] the ship coat and he has made us known
[1:56:36] all over the world. How we how God has
[1:56:38] done the great thing for us. And yet we
[1:56:42] daily oh daily daily mingle around
[1:56:46] daily
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; daily
[1:56:51] dilly dally
[1:56:54] which is my dictionary
[1:56:56] and mingle around and go out and we are
[1:56:58] not seem to be sincere. We don't have
[1:57:01] prayer anymore and things that don't
[1:57:03] like going right. We try to put on
[1:57:05] little programs and corn platters and
[1:57:07] ease the pain. You can't ease the pain
[1:57:10] until you get good rich blood in there
[1:57:12] to heal the thing. Now listen to this.
[1:57:14] It's all this other I've been reading it
[1:57:15] has been blushing prophet says how we
[1:57:17] need to pray how we will go back to you
[1:57:20] we will go back to you again brother do
[1:57:23] you realize we don't pray al as our
[1:57:25] fathers did
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; father pers do you know we don't put as
[1:57:30] much time on our knees as the pastors
[1:57:32] before us did
[1:57:34] woman do you realize you don't instruct
[1:57:37] your daughter and pray with her at night
[1:57:39] like your mother did
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; now it has become you do your own things
[1:57:44] and do my own things and then she goes
[1:57:46] to bed, she sleeps you but the
[1:57:48] old-timers in the evening take time with
[1:57:51] your daughter not only little kids
[1:57:53] sometimes with your daughters say you
[1:57:56] know let's talk a little bit you know
[1:57:58] this share
[1:58:01] this life you know the corruption the
[1:58:03] world and they might not accept it but
[1:58:06] you are sharing
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; you are distributing the power the
[1:58:12] virtue One day they realize, "Oh, daddy
[1:58:15] was right. Mommy was right." But if you
[1:58:17] don't spend that time, who else will
[1:58:19] spend that time?
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; The world will spend the time. They
[1:58:22] spend the time with the world all the
[1:58:24] time. But the person they can trust the
[1:58:26] most is you. Parents.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Take time to not judgmental. Talk.
[1:58:33] Talk.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Woman, do you realize you don't instruct
[1:58:39] your daughter and pray with her at night
[1:58:41] like your mother did? Then what about
[1:58:43] it? Who is guilty? We are all guilty.
[1:58:46] There's no way around it. We are all
[1:58:49] guilty.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians can come.
[1:58:55] Statue of the perfect man. Like Jako
[1:58:58] once said, going into a restaurant and
[1:59:00] have a great big menu and begin to read
[1:59:03] it down. T-bones, steaks, and things. I
[1:59:07] like a t-bone. Well, then the restaurant
[1:59:10] says that was for a day passed. We don't
[1:59:13] have it anymore.
[1:59:15] The prophet says, "Might as well lay the
[1:59:17] menu down and get out." That's right.
[1:59:19] Because that's got nothing to eat
[1:59:21] anyhow. You might as well go where
[1:59:24] restaurant has got something to eat. And
[1:59:26] the spiritual man growing needs
[1:59:28] something to eat. That's the word of
[1:59:29] God. I believe every word of God. The
[1:59:32] Bible of God is talking about
[1:59:33] deliverance. It's a menu. And this
[1:59:36] church is a restaurant. We don't have a
[1:59:40] menu of the day past.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; The menu is here and we can be served
[1:59:46] today. Amen.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; If you need deliverance, the menu is
[1:59:49] here and we can serve you what the man
[1:59:52] is talking about.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; You are struggling with something, the
[1:59:55] menu is here and we can serve you what
[1:59:58] the menu is talking about. Not us. God
[2:00:00] is here to back up his own word. Amen.
[2:00:03] You need salvation for your family, the
[2:00:05] menu is here and the restaurant is ready
[2:00:07] to serve you that.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. You need the Holy Ghost, the menu
[2:00:10] is here and the restaurant is here to
[2:00:13] serve you that. Amen. Not something of
[2:00:15] the past. God is real today.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. Amen.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Let's sing Come and Dine. The master
[2:00:31] call of come and die.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Come and die. The master call. Come and
[2:00:43] you may feast at Jesus step all the
[2:00:48] time.

[2:00:59] and Greek call

[2:01:25] satisfies the hungry every time. Come
[2:01:29] and die. Come and die. The master call
[2:01:33] of come and oh come and die. You may
[2:01:38] feast at Jesus table.
[2:01:42] All the time he fed the multitude,
[2:01:46] turned the water into one. To the hungry
[2:01:51] call,
[2:01:53] come and
[2:01:56] soon the lamb will take his bride to be
[2:02:00] everlasting.
[2:02:03] All the host of heaven will ask some be.
[2:02:08] Oh, to be a glorious sight. All the
[2:02:13] saints in sportless life and with Jesus
[2:02:17] there will fe eternally. Oh come and
[2:02:21] die. Come and die. The master caller.
[2:02:25] Come and die.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Oh come and die. You make the Jesus
[2:02:30] table.
[2:02:33] The time you f the multitude
[2:02:38] turn the water into wine. To the hungry
[2:02:42] call of man. Come and die.
[2:02:48] Come and die. Whatever you have need of,
[2:02:51] come and die. The master supplies to all
[2:02:53] our needs. Amen. Do you love the Lord
[2:02:56] this morning? Let's stand up together.
[2:02:59] I was thinking about this song, Coming
[2:03:01] Home. I don't know. I I'll try
[2:03:11] never
[2:03:13] more to grow.
[2:03:18] Oh, open
[2:03:22] thine arms of life,
[2:03:26] Lord.
[2:03:28] I'm coming
[2:03:30] home
[2:03:32] once again. Coming home. Coming
[2:03:36] home.
[2:03:38] Coming
[2:03:40] home.
[2:03:42] Never
[2:03:45] to
[2:03:50] open
[2:03:52] wide thine arms of love.
[2:03:57] Oh Lord,
[2:03:59] I'm coming
[2:04:01] home.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; I've wondered
[2:04:09] found
[2:04:11] God.
[2:04:13] Now I'm coming
[2:04:16] home.
[2:04:20] In the path of sin
[2:04:23] too long I've road.
[2:04:28] Lord, I'm coming
[2:04:32] home.
[2:04:34] Coming home. Coming
[2:04:37] home.
[2:04:40] Coming
[2:04:41] home.
[2:04:43] Never
[2:04:45] more to roll.
[2:04:51] Oh, and wine
[2:04:55] comes of blood.
[2:04:59] Lord, I'm coming
[2:05:03] home. I've wasted
[2:05:09] many
[2:05:11] precious
[2:05:13] years.
[2:05:15] Now I'm coming
[2:05:19] home.
[2:05:23] And now
[2:05:24] repent
[2:05:27] with me the tears.
[2:05:31] Lord, I'm coming
[2:05:35] home.
[2:05:37] Coming home. Coming
[2:05:41] home.
[2:05:43] Coming
[2:05:45] home.
[2:05:47] Ever
[2:05:49] more to roll.
[2:05:54] Oh, open wide
[2:05:58] arms of love.
[2:06:02] Lord, I'm coming.
[2:06:06] Oh,
[2:06:09] just close our eyes as the music is
[2:06:11] playing softly.
[2:06:15] You know the churches as we're closing
[2:06:17] our eyes the church is as we heard the
[2:06:19] other Sunday the church is like a
[2:06:21] hospital
[2:06:22] where we come those who are healthy
[2:06:27] say oh maybe nothing of that touched me
[2:06:31] it's fine but at least you came to the
[2:06:33] hospital for a checkup to know that
[2:06:36] everything is fine
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; just say oh help me Lord to continue to
[2:06:41] take the same gospel take the same
[2:06:44] medicine because I'm fine. All is well
[2:06:47] by God's grace. But on the other hand,
[2:06:49] also those who go to hospital realize,
[2:06:52] oh, I've been missing this. Lord, maybe
[2:06:56] I missed that part, Lord.
[2:06:59] Lord, maybe I was not as clean as I
[2:07:02] thought in the natural. I was not as
[2:07:05] virtuous as I should be. Oh Lord, help
[2:07:08] me. Maybe I was not living under my
[2:07:13] privileges as a Christian with the power
[2:07:15] of God to move in my life,
[2:07:19] my family, work, wherever I am. Lord,
[2:07:22] help me also in that area. That's why
[2:07:25] I'm coming home. Lord, I recognized that
[2:07:28] I've wondered maybe but your word
[2:07:30] brought me. And if this morning someone
[2:07:33] want to give his heart to the Lord, say
[2:07:36] Lord, I want a new start with you. I
[2:07:39] want a fresh start with you, Lord. I'm
[2:07:42] coming home. Can just raise your hands.
[2:07:45] And the Lord sees your hand and he knows
[2:07:49] the situation.
[2:07:51] Someone's Lord, I I desire I desire
[2:07:53] closer walk with you, desire to be more
[2:07:56] sincere, desire maybe to spend time with
[2:07:59] my family and that they can see the love
[2:08:02] part because correction without love
[2:08:05] just going to hurt and separate more.
[2:08:08] But when they see the love of God in my
[2:08:10] heart towards them, then they can see
[2:08:12] that's Christ speaking to them. Lord
[2:08:15] help me in that area. Lord, can we just
[2:08:18] talk to him in your personal way, in
[2:08:20] your own way myself? I'm going to pray
[2:08:23] the word of God checked me as well.
[2:08:26] Lord, help me Lord and all of us. I just
[2:08:28] pray. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, we
[2:08:31] thank you.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your presence this
[2:08:33] morning, Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:08:36] Father in many areas and many things
[2:08:39] we desire God the closer walk with you
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; father Lord
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; to spend time in prayer spend time in
[2:08:48] the word of God spend time father Lord
[2:08:51] even the children loved ones nephew
[2:08:54] nieces people Lord that would like to
[2:08:56] draw from the virtue of what you have
[2:08:59] given us as a lily
[2:09:02] the bees can come and feed from there.
[2:09:06] Oh God, help me to be that lily. Help
[2:09:08] me, Father, Lord, to make myself
[2:09:10] available. That the power is not only
[2:09:12] for me
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; but more for others to be a servant for
[2:09:16] others. Lord,
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; God, make that a reality in my heart. It
[2:09:22] can be a virtuous bride, virtuous

[2:09:33] life to others, virtue of God to others,
[2:09:36] for healing, for encouragement,
[2:09:38] for a place of refuge.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Oh father, let this church be a place
[2:09:43] where people come and find themselves
[2:09:45] comfortable. Oh, it's a place where I
[2:09:48] found strengthen. I see the love in the
[2:09:51] people. I see I was weak but I felt
[2:09:54] strengthened when I came in that place
[2:09:56] because I saw the love of God, the
[2:09:58] virtue of God being imparting to me.
[2:10:01] Make that church so powerful. Father,
[2:10:04] Lord, in the humility by the power of
[2:10:06] God moving among us, not only the word
[2:10:09] and letters, but the power of the Holy
[2:10:11] Spirit moving among this church. Father,

[2:10:18] wounded in the spirit, wounded in the
[2:10:20] flesh, wounded, Father, in their mind,
[2:10:22] but Father, find a place where they can
[2:10:24] meet Christ in the flesh, Christ in the
[2:10:28] human beings. Grant it as well in our
[2:10:30] homes, in our families, in our
[2:10:33] marriages, Lord, that we can be the one
[2:10:36] Lord conveying virtue and power to the
[2:10:39] others. Not putting people down but
[2:10:41] strengthening and encouraging. Help us,
[2:10:44] Father, we pray, Father Lord, in areas
[2:10:47] of cleanness and purity. Let our minds

[2:10:54] mind on Christ focused on you. Not to
[2:10:57] other different voices but father Lord

[2:11:00] primance on our heart to be sufficiently
[2:11:03] impressed by the voice of God. Grant it

[2:11:09] family Lord. Love them. Appreciate them.

[2:11:32] note.
[2:11:34] Prophet says an invisible union of the
[2:11:36] bride says
[2:11:38] he does it again. He's calling out his
[2:11:41] virtuous bride in the last day.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; God is calling his bride virtuous. As I
[2:11:47] was thinking about it, how does he God
[2:11:49] see the church
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; virtuous?
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; On this side, on the other side, God
[2:11:55] calls that pride virtuous.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:01] When I see the BL when I
[2:12:06] brother Victor, I'll call you after
[2:12:07] this. Don't mind for prayer.
[2:12:12] When I see the blood
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Christine
[2:12:23] for the sin,
[2:12:26] paid all his due.
[2:12:29] Sprinkle your soul with the blood of the
[2:12:35] lamb
[2:12:36] and I will pass. I will pass over you
[2:12:44] when I when I see. Oh, see the blood.

[2:13:19] all his promise
[2:13:22] that will he do. Oh washing the fountain
[2:13:29] open for sin
[2:13:32] and I will pass. I will pass over you
[2:13:39] when when I when I see. Oh, see the
[2:13:45] blood. When I When I see the blood, see
[2:13:51] the blood. When I

[2:14:06] Judgement is coming.
[2:14:10] Oh, will be there.
[2:14:13] Each one receiving

[2:14:59] Amen.
[2:15:02] Let's pray.
[2:15:08] Most gracious loving father,
[2:15:12] you told us Lord that love is
[2:15:13] corrective.
[2:15:17] As many as I love, I rebuke and I
[2:15:20] chasen.
[2:15:22] You are the same God who prunes the vine
[2:15:24] so that it can bear much more fruit.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, we Thank you for your grace this
[2:15:32] afternoon,
[2:15:33] Lord. We believe, Lord, that the word
[2:15:35] has been spoken
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; and Father, many spirits that would have
[2:15:40] taken over your children have been
[2:15:42] arrested this morning.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that the the virtue that
[2:15:47] was released at Calvary,
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; that same spirit that came in the
[2:15:52] ministry of the prophet and brought
[2:15:55] deliverance to the bound, set the
[2:15:57] captives free. Lord
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; that that same spirit has been called on
[2:16:01] this moment.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, you know your children. You know
[2:16:05] your people, Father. The reason why you
[2:16:07] are calling these spirits, oh God,
[2:16:10] Father, they will not be partakers,
[2:16:12] Lord, of darkness, oh God, that darkness
[2:16:15] will really not take over your church,
[2:16:17] Lord.
[2:16:20] Father, your church ought to have power.
[2:16:23] Not power only for deliverance from from
[2:16:26] the from sickness, Lord, but the power
[2:16:30] to live an abundant life in Christ.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost came to set the captives
[2:16:38] free.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; It's not Lord just to do what you said,
[2:16:42] but Father, that the life,
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; the life of Christ will be in the
[2:16:48] believer.
[2:16:50] The life Lord that keeps us from sin.
[2:16:53] The life that cleanses us from all
[2:16:55] unrighteousness
[2:16:57] where we know we realize we are wrong.
[2:16:59] That the life that brings repentance.
[2:17:03] The virtue of Christ that can be
[2:17:05] transmitted to the next person. Lord,
[2:17:08] this Messiah X that has been called in
[2:17:10] the last day.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; How can he who is in prison deliver
[2:17:16] another in prison?
[2:17:18] Father, may the Holy Ghost that spoke
[2:17:22] this word this morning, I pray for every
[2:17:26] brother and every sister, may we do our
[2:17:29] homework where we have been found
[2:17:31] wanting, oh God. May we be humble
[2:17:34] enough, Lord, to wait before you the
[2:17:37] Holy Ghost will have preeminence.
[2:17:40] Every home, oh God, may the Holy Ghost
[2:17:43] put those things in their rightful
[2:17:46] place. All the doors that has been
[2:17:48] opened,
[2:17:50] may they be shut from the enemy. Lord
[2:17:52] Jesus, your temple must be cleansed.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, the last push for this bride, the
[2:18:00] birth of the word requires selflessness.
[2:18:04] It requires death to self.
[2:18:07] Oh dear Jesus, the voice of the blood is
[2:18:11] still calling. I pray my God not only
[2:18:14] for the young people, even for us the
[2:18:16] older generation, all the bars that have
[2:18:19] been let down. Oh God,
[2:18:22] our prayer life, our consecrated life,
[2:18:28] bring them back. Lord Jesus,
[2:18:31] we are supposed to be a peculiar people.
[2:18:34] We are not supposed to be like the world
[2:18:37] in any form.
[2:18:40] May that virtue be brought back every
[2:18:43] one of us. Lord, when we leave this
[2:18:45] place, I pray my God that we will
[2:18:48] meditate on these things. May we not
[2:18:51] just laid aside as something that was
[2:18:53] spoken in church.
[2:18:56] But the voice of God is calling. It is
[2:18:59] calling for a higher calling. It is
[2:19:02] calling for the power,
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; the principalities that govern Edmonton.
[2:19:09] They have shut down the supernatural.
[2:19:12] They have relegated it to the old times
[2:19:16] so that Lord we don't have the power
[2:19:19] that keeps from sin. We don't have the
[2:19:21] power. We are trying Lord in our own
[2:19:23] strength
[2:19:25] but that's not your gospel. That's not
[2:19:27] the program.
[2:19:31] When you take the power out of the life
[2:19:33] of the people, what do you have left?
[2:19:37] What do you have left? But just people's
[2:19:40] thoughts. You're trying to keep yourself
[2:19:43] when you cannot keep yourself in this
[2:19:45] generation.
[2:19:48] All of hell has been poured into this
[2:19:50] generation. It will take the
[2:19:53] supernatural living God. It will take
[2:19:56] the living Christ.
[2:20:00] Lord, I remember when you told Peter,
[2:20:02] "Satan desires to sift you like wheat,
[2:20:05] like sand. But I have prayed for you."
[2:20:10] Oh, bring these things back to the
[2:20:12] church of the living God. A hospital
[2:20:16] where people can come and be cleansed,
[2:20:19] where people can come and be delivered.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; Our young people don't have to fight by
[2:20:23] themselves.
[2:20:27] Lord, may the older generation realize
[2:20:30] how much needful they are.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, their prayer life
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; pray until the breakthrough. Lord,
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; house of hell must give way.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; When the church of the living God, when
[2:20:46] the bride of Christ will take their
[2:20:48] place, when we will pay the price. Oh
[2:20:51] God
[2:20:54] forgive us Lord
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; where we've became dilary Lord the cares
[2:21:00] of this world consumed us and our
[2:21:03] children were baby such with
[2:21:06] technologies
[2:21:08] oh God that we exposed to the enemy
[2:21:10] father
[2:21:13] but the church is now calling like
[2:21:15] Samson once more let the Holy Ghost move
[2:21:19] among us once more.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; Oh God, open our blinded eyes once more.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Regardless of the price, let us pay it.
[2:21:29] Oh God,
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; the government is on our shoulders. The
[2:21:35] cries of the ages gone by.
[2:21:39] Unbelievers come among us don't feel any
[2:21:42] virtue.
[2:21:44] Where is the salvation of God?
[2:21:48] Father, wake us up from our stuper. Wake
[2:21:52] us up from our slumber, our pride. Wake
[2:21:55] us up from our selfishness.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; Now, Lord God, we are at your throne.
[2:22:02] Pour once again the palm of Gilead.
[2:22:05] Pour once again, Lord God, the power of
[2:22:08] the living God. May we pay the price for
[2:22:11] that power.
[2:22:13] That's what Satan has been against all
[2:22:16] along. He has kept the letter of the
[2:22:19] message and has stripped the church of
[2:22:22] the power.
[2:22:24] But now Lord, your word has been spoken.
[2:22:28] It has reminded us. Lord, you have never
[2:22:31] changed. Lord, you don't intend to
[2:22:33] change. The church is not kept by words.
[2:22:36] It is kept by the power of the Holy
[2:22:39] Ghost.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; Father, your children are before you
[2:22:43] throughout this week. Lord, will you
[2:22:45] protect them? Father, I pray for a
[2:22:47] cleansing in the sanctuary. May our
[2:22:50] minds be washed again. Father, let there
[2:22:52] be renewal. Oh God, in the homes,
[2:22:55] husbands, how you live with your wives,
[2:22:57] our children, how we relate to them. Oh
[2:22:59] God,
[2:23:01] may the love of God, that sweet spirit
[2:23:04] be brought back into the homes, the way
[2:23:07] we relate to brothers and sisters.
[2:23:10] May the love of God, that pure fountain,
[2:23:14] let it be disseminated.
[2:23:17] Let it be a week
[2:23:20] of contemplation. Father, where are we
[2:23:23] concerning your word? Where are we
[2:23:25] concerning the surrender that you are
[2:23:27] requiring right now?
[2:23:30] A lighthouse,
[2:23:32] a lighthouse you are calling, Father.
[2:23:35] Young and old, we must experience the
[2:23:38] living God. It is not just the anointing
[2:23:41] father but the living God power to
[2:23:45] withstand the cesspool of hell that we
[2:23:50] see all around us. Oh dear Jesus let
[2:23:54] your salvation ring in every place. Let
[2:23:56] it ring in every believer
[2:23:59] for those who've never known the power
[2:24:01] of God. Father may the doors be opened.
[2:24:05] Lord our brethren who have traveled
[2:24:07] brother Andrew and so on. May your
[2:24:09] protection be with them, Father. Keep
[2:24:11] your children from harm, from danger,
[2:24:14] from all the the the the desires of the
[2:24:17] wicked one. Father, we bind the works of
[2:24:20] darkness from affecting any one of them,
[2:24:22] Lord.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; May the love of God bind us together.
[2:24:30] Father, in their closet, bring the needs
[2:24:32] of your children. Father, I pray for the
[2:24:34] Hackalac family.
[2:24:37] Brother Johnny Hackalac has gone to be
[2:24:39] with the Lord. Father,
[2:24:42] that family has suffered a lot. Lord,
[2:24:47] they lost about three in the last three
[2:24:49] years. Lord,
[2:24:51] Lord, comfort them, Father. I pray you
[2:24:54] strengthen them. And I certainly thank
[2:24:56] you for brother Johnny's testimony. What
[2:24:58] the sickness did in bringing him to you,
[2:25:00] Lord, in bringing such a surrender like
[2:25:02] he's never known before. Father, all
[2:25:06] things do work together for your good.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; Your wisdom is past ours. Lord, give
[2:25:13] brother David, sister Donna, and the
[2:25:16] family. Give them strength
[2:25:20] in the blessed name of our Lord Jesus
[2:25:22] Christ. Lord, may your Holy Spirit go
[2:25:25] with all who are able to come. May they
[2:25:28] may not even understand, but Lord, would
[2:25:29] you touch them for Lord, we don't have
[2:25:32] too much time. There isn't much time. Oh
[2:25:35] God,
[2:25:37] we love you, dear Jesus. We appreciate
[2:25:40] our our brother, Lord, Brother Moses,
[2:25:42] the pastor. We pray that more of the
[2:25:45] shephering anointing will be upon him,
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Lord. We pray that oh God all that
[2:25:50] you've ever wanted to do in a shepherd
[2:25:52] will be done in him father and may you
[2:25:55] be with his family protect them. We know
[2:25:57] Lord God the hounds of hell will always
[2:25:59] want to go after Lord God our
[2:26:01] benefactors. But Lord you are still the
[2:26:04] gracious one who protects who shields.
[2:26:07] Father I pray for every brother every
[2:26:09] sister their homes
[2:26:12] everything pertaining to them. Keep them
