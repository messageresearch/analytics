--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 ... Scripture. And I wish we could just stand up again for a moment, while we read out of the Book of Exodus. And the 4th chapter of the Book, in the Book of Exodus, I'd like to read 1st to the 8th verse. And Moses answered and said, But... they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD has not appeared unto thee. And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod. And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,... the God of Jacob, has appeared unto thee. And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprosy as snow. And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was returned again as his other flesh. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken unto the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. [Exodus 4:1-8]

L-2 Let us pray. Lord Jesus, the unchanging, unfailing God, remains the same yesterday, today, and forever. And Thou never changes, and we're so grateful for that. Now bless Thy Word, and the reading of Thy Word, to our heart. And may we have faith to believe Thee. In Jesus' Name we ask it. Amen. You be seated.

L-3 Now, you're one of the nicest audiences I ever spoke to. And I don't say that just to be saying it. It's true. And now I want to kind of take my time a little, tonight, and set this scene. So, the purpose of doing this, I'm here to help you. And if I can't help you or do something for you, well, make life's burdens a little easier for the Christians, and bring the sinner to Christ, I'm a total failure for the Kingdom of God. And I certainly want to be a blessing to God, as He is our strength and life and help.

L-4 Now in teaching this, I want to so that you will understand. See, there is some things comes up sometimes, that's so mysterious, that people doesn't catch it just right. And I think if we make it clear, plain.

L-5 Many people, like if we... if you don't explain Divine healing. Now sometimes Brother Roy, perhaps, in a few minutes, says it. But it's people that doesn't know just how to hold onto Divine healing, and especially when the--the enemy comes, why, you--you could lose the battle, very easy.

L-6 Sometime when people get sick after being prayed for, they think, "That's the batt-... No, I lost it." That's the sign you got it. See? See, that, that's your sign. If you don't know just... if you don't know your enemy, how can you do it in just thirty minutes each night for a five little services, and gone somewhere else?

L-7 One of these days, I believe the Lord... while the great revival is kind of quietened across the nation. I've asked the Lord, if it be His will, let me get a tent, set it up, and we don't have to rent anything. And have of a morning service for the teaching, with pastors and so forth, maybe from ten till twelve; in the afternoon, the instructions on healing; and then that night, praying for the sick. Day in and out, for weeks. And then not having Wednesday night, or Sunday services, to interfere, or something. Just Sunday afternoon, so we won't interfere with the rest of the service, and that way let everybody come that wishes to. Pray for the sick. And if the devil comes back, or says anything, then we can come in and check it, and see just what's taking place, you see. 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min

L-8 I think that could be a real blessing to the neighborhood, to the pastors and all of them that would know them. They believe this. They absolutely believe it, or they wouldn't be preaching the Bible. Any Bible believer, a real Bible believer, punctuates everyone of these promises of God with an "amen." That's right.

L-9 If you can't believe it all... You say, "Well, I believe this, but I don't know about That. You've got the same interpreter that Eve had. She tried... He tried to interpret It to Eve, "Oh, this is right, and that's right, and, oh, that's truly that, but surely God..."

L-10 God said so, and every Word! There is not one Word or one phase of It can be missed, misaccepted. If you don't accept It with all your heart, every bit of It, then you might as well not even start at all. See?

L-11 Remember, it was one little phrase of It, just turned around, that caused every sickness, every heartache, every death, everything. It caused it all. Just by misbelieving one little phrase, caused all this, do you think just deliberately walking over one little phrase will get you back? When, people don't accept half of It, sometimes, and then call themselves Christians. See? See?

L-12 It's all right, every bit of It, it's just got to be put together. And there is only One can do it, that's the Holy Spirit, by interpret It by His Own fulfilling what He said He would do. That's the only way that I know of. Now our...

L-13 I'm going to speak tonight to you, or teach, for a--for a few minutes, on the subject of the... The Voice Of The Sign.

L-14 Did you know, Moses said there, he will... "They will not hear my voice. They will say, 'The Lord hasn't appeared to you.'" God told Him then, said, "Now what's that in your hand?"

L-15 He said, "Why, it's a staff, rod; just an old stick, shepherd's staff, like."

L-16 Said, "Throw it on the ground." He did, and it turned to a serpent. Picked it up again, it was a serpent... or a stick again.

L-17 Then He said, "Put your hand in your bosom." And he pulled it out, it was leprosy. And then he put it back again, pulled it out, it was healed. He said, "Now, if they won't believe the voice of the first sign, they will believe the voice of the second sign."

L-18 Now did you notice how God does that, the unchangeable God? Can any of you go back in Arkansas, about fifteen years ago, when the Voice of the first sign, promised the Voice of the second sign? See? I said, "When that comes to pass, nobody will be able, 'less he's just purely an unbeliever, 'cause It will discern and know what he is, and can tell him about it." So he's a... How many remembers the proph-... that being prophesied way back years ago, that come to the meeting, and said it would come to pass? The Angel of the Lord said, "It'll come to pass that you'll even know the secrets that's in their heart." How many knows that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] That prophesied many years ago, see, when the first sign was a moving.

L-19 Now, our scene is at the backside of the desert, of a runaway prophet. Moses knew that he had been raised up for to deliver Israel; He had learned that from his mother. That she... He was a proper child. And--and Jochebed and--and her husband had prayed that God would send a deliverer, and there he was born in their family, "proper child." We know the story. And now when he was raised up, he took the very same way of training for the job, as we would train a man today, right off to school, to the best of schools.

L-20 If a man thought we had a--a call in his life, what would happen? They would send him to Bob Jones, or somewhere, or some of the great schools, and get him the highest type of education he could get. And that's the worse thing they could do. That's the worse thing that could be done. When a man says, "I'm a Ph. D., LL.D.," that just puts him way away from God, to me. See? God don't, is not all them things there. God is simple, humble, God. You know, you walk... They try to split an atom, and--and try to tell how you're to do it, and then they'll walk over a blade of grass that they know nothing about. That's right. You just get yourself away from God by those things. Not as I'm supporting ignorance, now, don't think that.

L-21 But I'm trying to tell you that God is not known by education. God is known by faith. Faith, you know God, and 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min that alone, and only faith. You only have to have something to base faith upon, 'cause it's not bottomless; that is His Word. And Moses went to school, and they schooled him over and over again, because, no doubt, they thought that he would be a great military man. And which history tells us he was a great military man, was able to take the armies of Egypt and--and become the Pharaoh of Egypt, and set the people free, and send them back to their homeland or let them takeover Egypt. Now that's the really the way that they thought would happen. And so they trained him, and--and he could even teach the scholars some wisdom. He was really smart and educated. But that wasn't God's way of doing it. And when he found out it failed, he become bitter.

L-22 And that's what the churches do today. When they find out, their educational program, you can't education God, a man to God, you can't denominate him to God. God has got a way for him to come, and that's the only way God is going to recognize him, that's under the Blood. And you can't do it by saying, "We'll all be Methodist. We'll all be Baptist. We'll all be Assemblies. We'll all be church of God. We'll all be Oneness. We'll be this." That will not satisfy God, because, His program, that we've got to be born again and come under the Blood. And so our--our schemes are only man-made, and they've started out, a failure, and they'll always be a failure till we come back to God's way of doing it. That's the only way that God knows, is under the Blood. That's where He passes over.

L-23 Many of you was down the other night, or Sunday afternoon, I guess, down there when I preached on The Token. Hold the Token before you. How many was down there, let's see your hands? Well, I thought there was a group from here down there. And, the Token, that's the only thing that God recognizes, and the Token must be there or the covenant is even annulled. Just the Token! And the Token is the Holy Spirit.

L-24 Now we find that Moses, after doing this, he got bitter. So he just run, left Egypt and went out into the--the deserts, and there we find he married an Ethiopian girl, had a son named Gershom. And one day while he was a walking along the side of--of an old familiar path on the back side of the desert there, herding sheep, well, he was attracted by a scene that was unusual.

L-25 And God is so unusual, He does things in such an unusual way; so contrary to science, so contrary to education, so contrary to sometimes man's theology, just contrary to that. God does that just to show He is God. And, to do that, He has to take somebody that knows none of these things, so that He can work through that person.

L-26 When Jesus come, why didn't He take Caiaphas, the priests that was trained and ready for the job? He went down and got man that couldn't even sign their name, "ignorant and unlearned," the Bible said they were. Cause, God takes nothing to make something out of it. See?

L-27 And whenever you get to a place that you feel that you're nothing, then you're just about ready to come to God. When--when you get to a place that you know nothing, but you want to know something, then He'll reveal Himself to you.

L-28 Now, notice when this unusual thing, never had happened in the world, as we know of. It was just the time of the exodus. The exodus was at hand, and, when, exodus means, "being taken out, brought out."

L-29 And now we find out that, usually, just at those joint crossroads of an exodus, the unusual begins to happen. I believe we're there again. I believe we're there, at the exodus of the Bride, to go meet the Bridegroom. I believe the exodus is at hand.

L-30 And this exodus, to be brought from--from Egypt, back to their homeland where they were promised to come, was just at hand, and God had to re-educate His man. Remember, Moses was educated for forty years, getting all of his doctor's degree and everything, and it taken God just another forty years to take out of him what education had put in him. Forty years in the wilderness; what taken it, take in out, it was to put it in.

L-31 Then, and all this great thing was out of him, God appeared to him in a form of a burning bush. Now I'll show you that it was out of him. Now, if not, now Moses being a--a scientist, he would have went to take some of those leaves off of a tree, and take them down to the laboratory and have them examined, to see what kind of a chemical it was sprayed with, that that tree could burn and not burn up. See?

L-32 Because, now, the Egyptians were smart, scientific people, more smarter in science than we are today. Proves that. 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min They could embalm a body that still looks natural today. We can't do that. Build a pyramid. We couldn't do that. See? The things that they had were far beyond our science today.

L-33 And so Moses was trained in all the wisdom, so that made him a scientist. So, you see, when he come in the Presence of this bush, he knowed the bush had what he lacked.

L-34 If we could only do that today, if we could only know the phenomena of God has got what we lack in our denominations. What our educational system lacks, God has got it in the phenomena of the Presence of Christ. That's what we need.

L-35 Now, we find out, this exodus at hand, God met Moses and told him what was going to take place, and give him two sign. And each sign had a Voice, a Voice of a sign.

L-36 Every sign from God is followed by a Voice. Every time God gives a true sign, there is a Voice that follows it. When you see some kind of phenomena come along, and watch it move, and it don't change into something, then it never come from God. See? God don't just show signs just to show He is God. There is a Voice that follows that sign.

L-37 Now, by God's help, we'll find that in the Scripture tonight, and see if that's the Truth. See? Here the burning bush was a sign to Moses, that was a sign, and it was given to... and he heard the Voice from the bush.

L-38 Now notice, God never changes His program. He never has to take His Words back. His first decision is perfect.

L-39 I can make a decision, I'll say, "Well, I--I was wrong, see." I'm a man. You can make one and you have to take it back.

L-40 Science makes it and takes it back. Did you know that? They can scientifically prove it to be right, and after a while they scientifically prove it's wrong, but they won't admit theirs. They won't admit theirs.

L-41 Now, a French scientist, about six hundred years ago, or something like that, rolling a ball at a certain speed around a globe, being the earth; or--or two hundred years ago, I believe it was, or three, something like that. Anyhow, he scientifically proved, by the raising of this ball, at the speed... If--if someone would go the terrific speed of thirty miles an hour, anything traveling upon the earth at the speed of thirty miles an hour, gravitation would loose its hold and it'd be taken off the earth. You think science goes back and recognizes that? No. They're going on and on and on. See?

L-42 But ministers are always trying to refer back to what somebody else said, way back behind them, instead of what God said do. We are climbing the tree of Faith. See?

L-43 And God never changes His program. You can rest solemnly on what God says the first time. He ever has to stay with That. He cannot, He cannot, and never did, at any time, change It. Because, if He does, then He--He is finite like we are; he makes mistake, he has to apologize and go back. But He is the source of all wisdom, source of all power; infinite, omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent. See, He's just, He is God. If He isn't all those things, then He isn't God. But He has to be that to be God.

L-44 Now, God never did use some man-made program to honor Him, unless just put it to disgrace. God always uses a single individual, just one; never an organization, never a denomination. He uses one single person, because we different, all, one from another. There was never two major prophets on the earth at one time. Never. See, He doesn't do it, because He just speaks to that one. When that one is gone, He raises another to speak at that time. Remember, that's always been His program.

L-45 Now we find out here, the burning bush was a sign. It was given to attract the attention of Moses.

L-46 Now that's what God gives a sign for, is to attract the attention of the people. That's what a sign is for, is to attract attention. And we go down through the Scripture here, as we teach It now for a few minutes, and find out if that isn't so, that He gives these signs to attract attention. And then when He gets the attention of the people, then the Voice of the sign begins to speak. Jesus healed the sick, to attract attention, see, then when He begin to preach. See, they always, it attracts attention.

L-47 The burning bush was given to Moses, to attract the runaway prophet's attention, and he turned aside to see what it 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min was. Then the sign gave a Voice. The sign itself gave a Voice.

L-48 Now these voices and signs are to alert the people of God's Word, is just about ready to be vindicated. Always a sign is to attract the attentions, people.

L-49 Now many of you Bible readers, and are--are thinking now of different passages in the Bible, and we're going to come to some of them, that, when a sign is given, it attracts the attention of the people, because God is getting ready to speak. He wants an audience. He wants somebody that's going to listen to what He is going to say. See? Now, always does that. His Word alerts them of the... The sign is an alert, to attract the attention of the people, that the Word is getting ready to speak.

L-50 Now notice, He is going to speak by His promised Word, something that He said He is going to do. Notice, "I have heard, and I remember My promise. I heard their cries in Egypt; I remember what I promised Abraham."

L-51 See what He is going to do? He attracted his attention, now he has got His Word, He is going to give It to the prophet, Moses. Because, that was, is, and ever is, His way of speaking. That's the way He does it at the beginning, that's the way He does it now. He ever does it the same. See? "The Word comes to the prophet." And Moses was the prophet, and now he has to prophesy that He was going to bring Israel up. Didn't say how He was going to do it, but He was going to bring them out of Egypt. And, then, He had heard their cries, and their groans, and their prayers. They were only waiting for God... God was waiting on them. He had His prophet out there in the wilderness, but He was only waiting for the people to call Him into action.

L-52 I believe He has got the same thing today, waiting for His church to call it on the scene, so He can act. The promise of today is ready, but He has got to get the people to praying and groaning like they were down there, then it'll come on the scene. See?

L-53 Moses was out in the wilderness, holding there for forty years. The people rejected the--the sign, the thing he did down there, a killing the Egyptian; it wasn't God's way, so He put him out in the wilderness and--and re-educated him now to the phenomena, and now he is ready. And God said, "I heard their groan, I have seen their groans, their taskmasters whipping them, and I remember My promise." Amen. See, He is ready to speak now, He has got everything in order. Now He shows the phenomena that attracts the attention of the prophet.

L-54 When the prophet got down there, he showed the phenomena, because he was God's voice. How could a man pick up dust and throw it, and say THUS SAITH THE LORD; not a flea in the country, and, a couple hours from then, everything is crowded full of fleas? Not a fly no where, at all, and he'd say, "Let there be flies"; and, the first thing you know, a big old blowfly begin to fly around, and they were bloating the people everywhere. Who, what man could do that? It was God using that prophet, making His word a sign, to give a call, "We're going out of Egypt."

L-55 There, watch real close now. He is going to speak, so He has to attract the attention by a sign, and the sign's voice is what He is going to say. His Word, His promised Word is going to be vindicated now. See? "I made a promise that I would take them out by a strong hand; I would show My power in that land," and whatever He is going to do. Now, He made the promise to Abraham, here He is ready to do it. So, He gives a sign, a Pillar of Fire laying back in a burning bush, and He tells Moses, "Now you're going to be My mouthpiece. Go on down there, and I'll be with you."

L-56 And when he got down there, then the promised Word, that He had promised, was vindicated. That was the Voice of the sign. You get it now? Notice, "I have heard their groans. I remember My promise."

L-57 God never changes. He always does it in the same way. The coming of a prophet is a sign that God is ready to speak. Did you... Now search the Scriptures. See? The Bible said, God said, Himself, He "did nothing until He revealed It to His prophets." That's right. He does it through them, because it comes to him. That's His servants, you know. All right.

L-58 The coming of a prophet is a sign that's overlooked by the people, every time. They overlook it. They never get it, somehow, 'less it's those who are got their eyes opened to see it. Those who are elected to see It, does see It. But the coming of a prophet was the sign that God is ready to speak, 'cause, if God ain't going to speak, the prophet wouldn't be on earth. Now remember that, he wouldn't be on earth unless God was ready to speak. And that's the way He speaks, is 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min through those channels. The unchanging God never did do it any other way. Notice.

L-59 This is always God's way of making His Voice known to His people. He sends His prophet and gives a sign; and then takes His Voice that's been spoken before, on His Word, and vindicates It by this man. And they know that it's His Voice because it's the promised Word of the day. Oh, if people could only see that. If they could only stop just a moment and realize that. You see, there is no way to make them believe it; there is--there is not a way, a man. God Himself can't do it, make the people believe it. They've got to believe it. And if there is nothing there to believe with, how can they believe, see, no matter what you do?

L-60 The Bible said, "Though He had done so many miracles, yet they could not believe" because, Isaiah foresaw it, and said, "They got ears and they can't hear, eyes and can't see." And yet He was perfectly the Messiah, done exactly what the Messiah said. And they said, "This Man just breaks up churches. And, He, we don't know from whence He comes." You see? Isn't that strange that they would do that? But the Bible said they would do it. [John 12:37], [Isaiah 6:10]

L-61 And the Bible also said, in this day they would do the same thing. "Heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than of God, false accusers, incontinent, despisers of those that are good; having a form of godliness, but would deny the vindicated Word, the Power there, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and so forth; from such turn away. For this is the kind that organizes women's societies, and goes house to house, and leads silly women laid away with divers lusts, never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth." See? Now, that's prophesied, and that's got to come to pass because it's THUS SAITH THE LORD. Notice, "But their folly would be showed up, as Jannes and Jambres, in the last days." [II Timothy 3:4-9]

L-62 Now always making known His Voice to His people, by His prophet sign. Now I'm talking about Moses, that's where I'm banking back, and then see where we're at. God's Word is manifested by the Voice of the sign.

L-63 Now the sign that is promised for the day, is done before the people, and then the written Scripture comes forth, is the Voice of that sign. If it doesn't give a Scriptural Voice, then stay away from it, see, it's not God. Cause, God can't promise This for today, and say, "Well, this is it." See, God cannot do that. God cannot promise something for one day, and say, "No, no, it--it ain't. I--I won't do that. That was for another day." What He promises, He must stay with it, and the real Scriptural sign is the Scriptural Voice.

L-64 Moses' sign, that he saw, was God in cosmic light. And then when He did that...

L-65 And does anybody know the old Hebrew sign, even before there was a Bible written? Was a triangle shape, or an oval shape of a cosmic light, exactly right, the Logos. Now, Doctor Lamsa has that in his Bible, on the cover on the outside.

L-66 Now we notice that Moses was attracted by this sign, and this sign spoke to Moses with a Scriptural voice. See, the sign attracted him. And then He said, "I remember My promise, and I have come down to deliver them. And I'm going to use you for a mouthpiece. You go on down there." Moses made his excuses, but God sent him, anyhow.

L-67 Now, He, that's His way of interpreting His Word. A prophet, in the Scripture, must first be a--a seer that's a vindicated. It must not be just any fellow come along, say, "I got THUS SAITH THE LORD," and the next one say, "I say THUS SAITH THE LORD." Prophets are not hands laid on them and made prophets. Prophets are predestinated for the hour. The Bible tells when they'll come, what they'll be. Prophets are--are sent from God. They are offices of God, that's been born.

L-68 God told Jeremiah, "Before you was even conceived in your mother's womb, I ordained you a prophet to the nations." See? They're just... That must be perfectly in the man. It's a... It's not him; it's a gift from him. Moses was born a prophet. Jeremiah was born a prophet. Isaiah, a prophet. John the Baptist, a prophet. God had spoke of them. [Jeremiah 1:5]

L-69 And what they say must be true. And the way that the people is to know whether they are true or not, what He says must be correct, because what he is prophesying about is his credentials of his call from God, when God vindicates what he says to be the Truth. Now that's why I'm trying to say these things tonight, so that you will understand. See? 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min Now if...

L-70 The Bible said over here, "If there be one among you, who is spiritual or a prophet, I the Lord will make Myself known unto Him, in visions, speak to him through dreams." Then He says, "If this prophet says anything and it doesn't happen, then don't you believe it." Now that's no more than good sense. "But if what he says comes to pass, then hear, then you must fear him," because He is with him. [Numbers 12:6]

L-71 Now we find out, what Moses said come to pass. See? That made him a vindicated seer. That was his credentials, because what he said happened. He said, "About this time tomorrow there will be fleas all over the ground," and there was. "This time tomorrow there will be so-and-so," and there was. It must hit exactly on the dot, not just a haphazard.

L-72 So many man today, if you'll excuse this just for a minute. And I'm no judge or... Just passing a personal opinion. Many man has raised up, good Spirit-filled man, and they try, they go out... Maybe the Lord give them a gift of prophecy.

L-73 Now, there is a million miles difference between a gift of prophecy and a prophet. See? A gift of prophecy must be judged by three before it can even be passed into the church. We know it's the same as speaking in tongues, it must go before three judges before it can even be given to the church.

L-74 Now we find out, now that these man go out sometimes, and then people begin to press upon them, "Oh, brother, what will you say?"

L-75 See, he goes by impression, see, the way he feels, "Why, the Lord will do that, THUS SAITH THE LORD." That's a lie, see. You, when... You can't say THUS SAITH THE LORD until God, in His Own language, has spoke to you and told you that, then it's not you saying it, not your impression. The Bible said if a prophet did that, was going on presumptuously, that is presuming, and presume is "to adventure without authority," he is going upon his own.

L-76 But when you see the man speaking what's going to happen, in the Name of the Lord, and it happens day in and out, week in and out, month in and out, year in and out, then you know that come from God. See? That's God's credentials to the man, that he is the interpreter of the written Word for that day, because God sent the man to do it.

L-77 If the churches only had some good, sound teaching on these things, see, they would understand It. Only thing, we get one little track and we run like wild with it, that's just take on that one thing and just make a hobby out of it. That's what every--every denomination originated from.

L-78 If Martin Luther would have went on into sanctification, okay. If the Wesleyan Methodists would have went on into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and restoration of the gifts, it'd a all been one big church of the Lord, all the time. But they get that one little thing and prove it's right, and there they are. But, they had to do it, the Bible said that's the way they would do it. See? And it has to be this a way, today.

L-79 I hope that my class under-... Do you understand what I mean? Raise you hand so... See? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] And, understand, you must understand. Friend, This is your Life. See? This is your Life. Yes.

L-80 His credentials is that God has a vindicated this person to be a seer.

L-81 Now the English word, a prophet, just means a "preacher." See? Anybody, every preacher is a prophet, 'cause he is foretelling something. Preaching the Word, under inspiration, is called a "prophet."

L-82 But in the Old Testament, they were more than that, they were seers. See? They were man who told things that was coming to pass, and it happened. That give him the rights to be the--the interpreter of the Word for that day, because God took the Word of that day and interpreted It, Himself, through that man. And that's what he come on the earth for, he is always a sign, when a prophet comes to the earth. Just watch as we go through it, and see if it isn't so. He always sends His prophet. When you see a prophet rise on the scene, [Brother Branham snaps his finger--Ed.] look out. We're looking for one to come now, you know. And then when you see it, you just remember it's something is fixing to happen. This is his credentials, then God interprets His Word by him and through him. Numbers 12:6 tells that.

L-83 And, remember, the entire Bible was wrote by the prophets. Why? The Word of the Lord came to them after they 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min was vindicated. Prophets like Jasher, and some of them that was throwed out, and many prophets that never went on; but God has a way of stirring His Word, when it's Truth. God has got to judge the world by something.

L-84 The Catholic people here, they say, "He is going to judge him, judge the world, by the church." If that's right, then what church? If you say, "The Catholic church." Which, the Roman, Greek, or what? See, they're all broke to pieces.

L-85 "He is going to judge it by the Baptist church." Then what about the Methodist church? See? See, He can't do that, there's too much confusion. People wouldn't know where they were at.

L-86 But He said, in the Bible, if you want to know what He is going to judge the--the people by. He is going to judge the world by Jesus Christ, and He is the Word. The Bible, then, is what He'll judge by, the vindicated Word. That's God's way of judging, is the Bible. So no matter what any creed or denomination says, you stay right in that Bible, 'cause It is Christ. Saint John, the 1st chapter, tells us that.

L-87 Notice now, the Bible was written by the prophets. We see that It says that, "The man of old, moved by the Holy Ghost, wrote the Bible." In Hebrews 1, It says, "God, in sundry times in divers manners spake to the fathers by the prophets, in this last day through His Son, Jesus Christ." See? Because He was the manifestation of all the Word of the prophet, and He was the fullness of the Word. The Word was in Him, all the Word. He was Emmanuel, "God manifested in flesh." [Hebrews 1:1]

L-88 God come down in the form of the Holy Spirit, two wings like a dove settling down and went upon Him, saying, "This is My beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in." Now the King James there says, "In whom I am pleased to dwell." What difference does it make, "In whom I'm pleased to dwell," or, "Who I'm pleased to dwell in"? See? "In Whom I'm pleased to dwell." There it was, God in man, heaven and earth come together. God and man united. The greatest hour, till that time, there was on the earth, or ever had been. [Matthew 3:17]

L-89 Notice, the Pillar of Fire sign, and then the Voice of the sign spoke. See? The Pillar sign, of the Voice, was there ready to speak. The sign only showed that the Voice was ready to speak. Get the idea? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-90 The sign shows God's Voice is ready to speak, and when God shows a sign as He is in the last days. You don't...

L-91 You look around. Look at--look at the immoral of the people today. That's God's sign. When you see people getting like this, look what they're going to. He said, "They'd get worse and worse." They, they are doing it, see, that--that immoral sign. All right.

L-92 And there is all kinds of signs. Signs in the heavens above, fearful sights, flying saucers; the Pentagon looks at them, don't know what they are. All kinds of signs: sea a roaring, waves, perplex of time, distress between the nations, all these things, earthquakes in divers places, man running to and fro, knowledge increasing, all these other things that He said, great turmoil. How that Christ would be put out of His church in the last days, in the Laodicea Age, we've got it. See? All these things are God-speaking signs.

L-93 And then what's to make this known? God sends someone on the scene, something on the scene to vindicate that, and to take the Scripture that's spoke of for the day and to manifest it, then that's the credentials of it. That, see, that's the sign.

L-94 The Pillar of Fire, as soon as the--the sign come up there, it was the--that was the sign that the Voice was ready to speak.

L-95 And we see the sign of the end. Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] The sign of the end! How many believes that, say amen. ["Amen."] Then, the Voice is ready to speak! The Voice is ready to speak because we see the sign. The Pillar of Fire was there to say that the Voice was ready to speak.

L-96 Also, it must be a Scriptural sign, must be a Scriptural vindication of the Word that's promised for that day. How perfect is God's order each time!

L-97 Now listen, let's go back just a moment here, a little thought. In the Old Testament, before the Bible was written, just had the scrolls and so forth, it hadn't been put together, like the Book of Isaiah's writing, the Book of So-and-so's 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min writing, the prophets. Now, if a man come up with something, that he had dreamed a dream, or he was a prophet, the first thing, they taken him down to the temple, to their Urim Thummim.

L-98 The ministers here, and many of you brethren out there, know what the Urim Thummim was. It was--it was the breastplate of Aaron. They hung it up on a post in the temple. And now notice, when that man begin to speak, and, if whatever he said, if it wasn't true, that Light stood still; it was nothing. But what he said, if it was true, then a conglomeration of Lights, like a rainbow, begin to flash. And that was called the Urim Thummim. Brothers knows that. [The brethren say, "Amen."] Sure. Sure, that was Urim Thummim.

L-99 What was it? The sign, no matter how it sounded, the sign must be given with the Voice. Amen. See, the sign comes and then the Voice. There must be that, or the Voice is not recognized. That's right. No matter what the Voice said, how real it sound, if that Urim Thummim didn't declare it, then it wasn't right.

L-100 And any kind of sign that's showed today... I know God can do things that's not wrote in the Bible, but, to me, we're living in the hour that we should be very careful. The Urim Thummim today is God's Bible. That shows what's supposed to take place today.

L-101 When they think, "We got to build a bigger organization, we've got to go into the Ecumenical Council, that's a sign of unity." To me, it's a sign of the antichrist. That's exactly what the Bible spoke of. Sure. It's not a Scriptural sign; only, on the other side, let's the believer know which a way it's headed. The Urim Thummim is God's Word; and what He said would take place in the last days, that's exactly what's got to flash. And it's a wrong sign.

L-102 A man say, "Well, I got a Ph.D., LL.D., I was made so-and-so. I'm Doctor So-and-so." That's no Bible sign. "I know about It. Well, I'm the head of So-and-so. I'm a district man. I'm--I'm the bishop. I'm..." I don't care what you are.

L-103 There is only one sign we look for, and that's the vindicated Word of God, when it's THUS SAITH THE LORD. That's the Voice of the sign, God's Word first. When the Urim Thummim spoke, they said, "That's right." When them Lights flashed, the sign was there, the Voice was true. Notice how--how people has made that of a non-effect today, by their traditions!

L-104 Jesus Christ said, in His last commission to His church, in Mark 16, after His resurrection; He said, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be damned. These signs shall follow them that believe." If that don't flash on the Urim Thummim of your life, there is something wrong. "These signs shall follow them that believe: in My Name they shall cast out devils; speak with new tongues; if they should take up a serpent, or drink deadly things, it wouldn't harm them; if they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover." And man with smart education, to the highest dot, denies that Thing; how can it flash on God's Urim Thummim, when He said, "These signs shall follow them that believe"? God's Word, in Its entirety, is true. [Mark 16:15-18]

L-105 So the Urim Thummim has got to flash with the sign. If the sign is going... I don't care what he's doing, if it's not according, doing according to that Word, then there is something wrong. Don't care what he does, there is something wrong. It's got to come to a Truth. Didn't Jesus tell us, in Matthew 24:24, "The two spirits would be so close in the last days, it would deceive the very elected if possible"? [Matthew 24:24]

L-106 Now put on your thinking cap, put on your armor of God. Listen for just a minute. Notice, we've got to come exactly the way He said do it. Just the way God said do it, that's the way we've got to do it. What Jesus said was going to happen, that's what's going to happen. If He said, "These signs..." They say, "That was just for the apostles."

L-107 "All the world, and to every creature!" Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Where did He say, "just to the apostles"? "Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. These signs shall follow, in all the world, and to every creature."

L-108 A man saying, "back there," he is trying to by-pass the Thing. That's not a prophet. It's a prophet of a denomination, but not a prophet sent from God. He might be reflecting some denomination, or some theory, some school, some ethics. 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min

L-109 But I'm talking about God and His Word, Scriptural Urim Thummim, Scriptural sign, Scriptural Voice behind the sign.

L-110 Jonah, the prophet, was a sign. His sign was when he spit, the whale spit him out upon the bank, that was a sign. Them people were heathens, fished for a living. And they seen the whale-god come in, this god of the sea, and take the prophet and spit him out upon the bank, to give the message, and down the bank he went. There was the sign. Now the Voice was, "Repent or perish!" Before God struck that nation, to tear it to pieces and sink it beneath the sea, He sent a prophet with His Word. He gave a sign, a supernatural sign.

L-111 Remember, that sign even lasts till this day. Jesus referred to it. He said, "As the prophet Jonas was in the belly of the whale, for three days and nights, so must the Son of man be. A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after signs. And they'll get it, the sign of the resurrection." If we ever was in a wicked and adulterous generation, it's now, that Jesus said it would be. "As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be at the coming of the Son of man." Then, we're in a wicked and an adulterous generation, and they are going to get the sign of the resurrected Christ, the same yesterday, today and forever. Jesus said so. That's right. [Matthew 16:4]

L-112 Jonah come forth, he was a prophet. The Lord sent him. He tried to by-pass it, like Moses.

L-113 You can't by-pass the issue. Many man will want to pat you on the back, and say, "Come into our group. Come into our group." There is no group. God is the only one you're under. See? "Come to us."

L-114 He by-passed and went, started to Tarshish. God put him in a whale, sent him right back. And he went in there, and that was the sign. And the Voice of the sign, was to "Repent or perish!" They followed the Voice because they believed the sign, and they didn't perish. And that's the only way it was, because they believed the sign and heard the Voice.

L-115 That's the only way that the members of the churches of this day will fail to go into the Judgment, is when they believe the sign and hear the Voice of God. The Voice was, "Repent or perish!"

L-116 Noah, the prophet, before God destroyed the antediluvian world, Noah was the prophet. The prophet was a sign. What? That judgment was at hand. Noah building his sign up to them, a ark that he was putting forth; preaching the Gospel, God's Voice spoke down, and the world was destroyed. [Genesis 8:1-5]

L-117 John, a prophet, after four hundred years with no prophet, the longest of a time that Israel ever went without a prophet. What was God doing? Why did He let him go four hundred years? He wanted the prophet to be so--so outstanding to the people, that they would understand and take heed to what the man said. He was prophesied of coming. They said, in Malachi 3, "Behold, I send My messenger before My face, to prepare the way." And they hadn't had a prophet for four hundred years, and here come the prophet, John, on the scene. His appearing was a sign, a sign (what) that the Messiah's coming was at hand. He was drawing the attention to Israel. [Malachi 3:1]

L-118 You know, it's promised to come again in the last day, that's right, gather the people again and to attract their attention, their hearts, back to the fathers, the beginning. Take all these here creeds and things, and get rid of it, and go back to what the Bible said, "back to the Faith of the fathers." Vindicating, God promised to do. [Malachi 4:5-6]

L-119 Notice now, his appearing was a sign that the Messiah was at hand, four hundred years. And did they receive him? They didn't believe him. Certainly, they didn't. They had nothing to do with that, because his preaching was contrary. They didn't believe what he was saying. Yet, he was a sign, because the people knew he was a prophet. They knowed something was fixing to happen. See?

L-120 Every time, before a happening. Now we by-passed two or three pages here, a few minutes ago, of different prophets. Just to show you, that you understand. Before anything happens, God comes with a prophet, to vindicate His Word. And that coming of a prophet is a sign.

L-121 Now, John was the sign, because he was the prophet, that Messiah was at hand. Now we find John, the sign of the--of the... of Jesus' coming. We know that when God speaks and says these things, it's got to happen. You believe 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Now, the sign of preparation, John was. He was to be a sign of preparation. Do you believe that he was the sign of preparation? ["Amen."] Well, then, if he come then, in a sign of preparation, he is coming again in the sign of preparation. [John 1:30-34]

L-122 Notice, his message was, and his nature was, exactly like what spirit he was anointed with. He was like Elijah. Jesus said. "Why does the scribes say Elias must first come?" [Matthew 17:10-12]

L-123 He said, "He has already come, and you did to him what was listed. See? So must the Son of man suffer under their hands, 'cause all the Scripture has got to be fulfilled."

L-124 Watch John, look what John did. John was an outstanding man, come up from nowhere; so was Elijah. Both of them was lovers of the wilderness. And, remember, both of them took a rap at painted-faced women, immoral women. And their natures was the same; exactly like Elijah, so was John. And they both kind of took the same route one took, with the other one.

L-125 But John was the one who announced and introduced the Messiah. Notice, he introduced the Messiah. Rebuking immoral women!

L-126 Look at today, what we call the prophets of the churches today, and then call themselves "of God"? Some of these modern Ahab prophets with their little painted-faced, short-haired, short-wearing Jezebels leading them around wherever they want to go, then call themselves doctors, and so forth, "of the Bible"? How can it be? They are Ahabs, yes, doctrine of their creeds, afraid to get off of it, afraid they'd be put out of their denomination, or something.

L-127 Let me tell you, it's about that time when God always raises up something on the scene, to condemn it. He did it in the days of Ahab. He did it in the days of John. He promised to do it again in the last days, and He will do it! It's such a time that we're promised of this, at that time that we are going to see Malachi 4 fulfilled, exactly what He said it; a sign of the coming judgment, burning fire that will destroy all the unbelief, and the righteous will walk out upon the ashes of the wicked. It's promised. It's prophesied. It's THUS SAITH THE LORD. It's got to be. What's his Voice going to do, when this man comes on the scene? It's going to be revealing Jesus Christ's promised Word. That's exactly the only thing it can be, for the Bible said, in Hebrews 13:8, "He is the same yesterday, today, and forever." Right. [Malachi 4:5-6]

L-128 He also said, in Luke 17:30, "In the like it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man, when the Son of man will be revealed." The Son of man is prophesied to be revealed. And what kind of a revelation will it be? It'll be the revelation of His living, after being crucified for nineteen hundred years, and is raised from the dead and is alive with us. He will be revealed! Because, exactly the same things that they did at Sodom, has got to return again. You can interpret it any way you wish to, but there it is. It's just the facts, it interprets itself. The Word don't need any interpretation when It's doing it Itself. Revealing Christ in the promise of the age, that's exactly what will come on the scene. [Luke 17:30]

L-129 Paul, he had a sign. Let's watch him. Do you believe Paul was a prophet? He certainly was. Now notice. Paul came on the scene, and saw a sign. What kind of a sign did he see? A Pillar of Fire, on his road to Damascus, being a Jew. Jesus had been died, crucified, rose, ascended into Heaven, and Paul was on his road down to Damascus when a great Light struck him down. And he cried, "Lord, Who are You?"

L-130 He said, "I am Jesus." And he was told that he was called to be a chosen vessel, a chosen vessel. [Acts 9:15]

L-131 Now notice, what did Paul have, the rest of them didn't have? He had the abundance of the revelation of the Word of God, 'cause it was Paul who recognized that Jesus of the New Testament was Jehovah of the Old. Hallelujah! I could say something here. He had the revelation of It. He wrote It and revealed It, because God permitted It to be added to the Bible. And the Word comes only by the Bible, by the prophet. And so then God revealed to Paul, and he wrote the letters, inspired, and God put them in the Bible. Oh, my! Revealed that He is Christ of the Old Testament, because he met Him. [II Corinthians 12:5-8]

L-132 He couldn't understand how that Pillar of Fire was. That was the One that led his people out of Egypt. That was the One had been with the Hebrews all through the age. And, here He is, he seen Him. He said, "Lord, what is it You 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min want with Me?" He said, "I am Jesus."

L-133 He seen that this One that had led his people, that he knowed all the time, that Moses met, the "I AM," ever present, same yesterday, today, and forever, was manifested in the flesh. It was his revelation. He had It above any of the rest of them. He was... and he had It so great until... except he'd get exalted above the abundance of the revelation that was given to him. Oh, my! [Exodus 33:15-23]

L-134 What did he do? His revelation then was prophecy for today. It was the Voice coming forth, wrote in the Bible, to be vindicated today again. Hallelujah! It's the Voice being vindicated again, what He wrote, because he was God's prophet, revealing. The sign was speaking of something.

L-135 And we notice now that, Jesus, when He came on the scene, notice, He was the prophesied Word. He had a ministry to fulfil. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Sure, He had a ministry, notice, to be fulfilled, what was written of Him. Said that, the other night as I spoke, to Cleopas and them, "O fools, and slow of heart to believe the Word of God. Don't you know that Christ should suffer these things? Didn't all the prophets speak that He should do this, and then enter into His glory?" He has to fulfil everything that He come. He come to heal, that it might be fulfilled. He did this, that it might be fulfilled. Everything he done was to be fulfilling, because He had to be the Voice of that Scripture. But before He done it, He went forth with a healing ministry, healing the sick. Everybody wanted to see the sign. Sure, they believed the healing, but the Voice changed it. One day, when He said, "I and the Father are one." [Luke 24:25], [John 10:30]

L-136 That, that was too much for them. "You make Yourself God, being a man." When the--the sign, they believed it, but when they heard a Voice behind it, a ministry that followed that sign, they didn't get it. That's when trouble set in. [John 6:70]

L-137 Remember, He chose twelve. He said, He "chose them before the foundation of the world." He said, "I've chose twelve, and one of them is the devil." Paul had to take that place, to be the chosen one.

L-138 And notice, and when He did, one day He begin to speak to the people, and He said, "Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his Blood, there is no Life." What would doctors say about that? Now, He never explained it. He never said any... [John 6:53]

L-139 He just come for so many. Them that He foreknew, He come. He, He said, "No man can come to Me except My Father draws him. And all the Father has given Me, they will understand It, they'll come. See? See, they'll come. They'll understand It, the one the Father has given Me, whose names is on the Book of Life." He come to redeem them. [John 6:44]

L-140 Now we notice that, in that--in that great hour, He said, "Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, drink His Blood." [John 6:54-55]

L-141 Could you imagine what people thought? "Is that Man out of His mind? Does He want us all to turn cannibal? And now perhaps He'll go out somewhere and kill Himself, and we're supposed to eat His flesh and drink His Blood?" See, they never understood it.

L-142 He told Nicodemus, said, "If I tell you earthly things, and you don't understand it, how you going to understand Heavenly things, if I tell you." See? So, we find out they didn't understand it. So, the congregation dwindled away. [John 3:12]

L-143 So then He said, again, "When you see the Son of man ascending up from whence He came." [John 1:51]

L-144 Then the seventy ministers, the whole association, said, "What is the matter with this Man? The Son of man ascending up? And here we eat with Him, sleep with Him, fish with Him, out in the mountains with Him, laid out on the deserts with Him, around the creek banks with Him, and then and go up; seen the cradle He was rocked in, talked to His mother, knowed Joseph, he was supposed to be His father. We know all these things. And then He said, 'The Son of man is going up from whence He come.' Oh, how can that be?" See? But He was the Word. They failed to see that He was the Word. 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min

L-145 As I quoted the other day, one of the most outstanding Scriptures, that when Jesus, at twelve years old, when they left Him at the Feast of Pentecost, was gone three days and couldn't find Him. They come back. Mary had strictly testified that, that "the Holy Ghost overshadowed" her and brought that Child. But when she found Him in the temple, disputing with them lawyers, what did she say? She said, "Thy father and I have sought Thee with tears." What did she do? She condemned her own testimony, calling Joseph His father. Now, if she is the mother of God, what about that? See? [Luke 2:48]

L-146 Watch, the Word always is corrective. That little twelve-year-old Boy, never a day in school, as we know of, just a Child. He never knowed He said it, perhaps, but watch what He said, "Know ye not that I must be about My Father's business?" [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] [Luke 2:49]

L-147 And He is the Word today! He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. "Know ye not?" If He had been about Joseph's business, He'd have been making carpenter business. But He was about the Father, Heavenly Father's business. He was out there busting up them organizations they had up there, and all that scrupled it. He was tearing it to pieces. And they was astonished, a little Boy like that, that knowed that. It was God speaking through Him, because He was the Word for that day. Notice how perfect that is. Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. [Luke 2:49]

L-148 His revelation, we find out, is the same. He--He started healing, and, when He did, everything was fine. But then when He begin to, it is the Voice, begins to speak, "Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man."

L-149 Well, they, the congregation, walked away. "Oh, that fellow, we don't want to hear Him no more. That fellow is out of His mind."

L-150 They forgot all that He had done, the manifestation. They didn't read the Bible, to see the hour they were living. Sure, He was an odd Person. God does it that way. They say odd things.

L-151 Why couldn't--why couldn't Micaiah agree with the rest of them Israelite prophets down there, before Jehoshaphat and them? See? Why couldn't? He had the Word of the Lord, he had to say. He said, "I'll only say what God said." And they had Scriptural authority to show that they were right, but not all the Scripture. Jesus said, "It's also written." See? They didn't understand.

L-152 Now watch as we are closing now. We're--we're getting late. Yes, I'm sorry I've went too long, and I'll hurry right quick now for the prayer line. Just a few more words I want to say here.

L-153 Notice, the prophet come, and when he does, it shows a sign, and then there is a Voice in that sign, that speaks, a Voice that speaks, a Scriptural Voice that has to be according to the Bible, reflecting the Word for that hour. It's always been that way, it always will be that way, because God cannot change.

L-154 Now notice Jesus' first ministry, oh, they all, everybody, wanted Him in their church, "Oh, my, He's a great Fellow!" Sure, He went in all the synagogues, read the scrolls and set down. Everybody, "Young Rabbi!"

L-155 But one day He begin to talk to them in another way, the Voice of the sign begin to speak. And when the Voice of the sign begin to speak, nobody wanted Him. One of them said, "This Man is crazy. It's cannibal, trying to make cannibal out of all of us." See? He never explained it. Let them go.

L-156 The next come along, we find out that the seventy, the ministerial association He had with Him, when they come, "Well, how can this Man be ascending up? How? Who is He? Why, here He is making Hisself equal with God. That's a hard saying." And they went away from Him.

L-157 Then He turned to the disciples, and He said, "You want to go, too?" See? They couldn't go. They had seen something. They knowed the Scripture and they knowed that was it. They couldn't explain what He was talking about, but yet they believed it anyhow. They never asked no questions; it never bothered them. They believed because it was the vindication of the Scripture. "Do you believe That?" [John 6:66-67]

L-158 Peter said, "Lord, where would we go? You alone has the Words of Eternal Life." They seen it. They knowed that, He, Who He--Who He was, and that's what He is supposed to do. "No matter, we can't explain it." See, they were ordained to Life, before the foundation of the world. When that Light struck it, they knew it. There was nothing going 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min to move them from it, no matter. Looked like the Pharisees had Him penned in, one side and the other, it didn't bother them disciples. They went right straight on, anyhow, 'cause they believed it. His Voice spoke then. [John 6:68]

L-159 Now I might say this. His Voice will speak one day, a sign will come, and what will It do? The Laodicean sign must be the same as it was then. There will be a Voice speak to us in the last day. Remember, Laodicea sign! Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever; and when He was put out of the church there. In the Laodicea age, we find out, He is put out again, on the outside.

L-160 Look, the Voice, "If any man will cooperate, if anybody will let Me in, I'll come and sup with them, and they with Me. I'll come in and--and I'll--I'll be in them." Standing on the outside of the rank of church age, knocking, trying to get in. [Brother Branham knocks seven times on the pulpit--Ed.] "If any man will open the door and just cooperate with Me a little bit, I'll come in and sup with them. I'll make Myself known to them. If I can just get in, like I did on the road to Emmaus that night, in Emmaus. If I can just get in, I'll make Myself known to them." Now, the Bible said that's the way it would be, and that's the way it is. [Revelation 3:20]

L-161 Christ, "Sup, reveal Myself to them, I will reveal that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever. The Son of man will be revealed in that day, when all church-anity and everything else become Sodom and like that. I'll be on the outside, but I'll be knocking, trying to get in."

L-162 Now, again, if you can believe the--the true manifestation of this hour that we're living! I won't have time to go on through this. But if you can't get it, and can see now, the true manifestation; that God shows a sign, and the sign has a Scriptural Voice. You understand? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Let us pray.

L-163 Lord Jesus, just a word from You now, of vindication, that it's true. Now, Heavenly Father, we realize what would be our end if we be found false witness of You. Where would I go to, Lord, what would happen to me? Where would my end be, if I be found false witness, or have built the house upon stubbles or sinking sand? God, help us, real believers, if we have to stand alone, stand on the Word. We see Your sign, Lord. We see that something is fixing to happen. We know that the end time is here. We know it's promised for us, now may we not fail to see it. Come, Lord Jesus. You are the same. You are Jesus, tonight. When You can get somebody just to invite You in, that You can come in, then You'll make yourself known to them. Grant it, I pray tonight, through Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-164 I am just a little late, friends. I'm going to be about ten or fifteen minutes, we got. I'm going to call some, prayer line. I never noticed my watch.

L-165 I have a watch that I got in Switzerland, was give to me. I wind it up and it alarms, but the alarm is... I haven't got it with me this time. I forgot to bring it. Now, it confuses me sometimes. I spoke too long. Forgive me. I'll maybe make it up, maybe tomorrow night.

L-166 Prayer cards, what was that, what was the number? What prayer cards did he give? Huh? E, one to a hundred? Where did we call from the last time, anybody remember? One, starting from one, then to fifty; or twenty-five or somewhere, was fifty then. Let's call from seventy-five then, tonight. We called from one, twenty-five, and fifty, now let's call from seventy-five.

L-167 E, seventy-five, who has the prayer card, raise up your hand. Prayer card E, seventy-five, raise up your hand. Look around on your cards. You mean it isn't here? Then we start from somewhere... Oh, I'm sorry. All right, E, seventy-five, lady. All right. Come over here, lady, right here, seventy-five. Seventy-six, seventy-seven, seventy-eight, seventy-nine, eighty, let those five stand. One, two, three, four, we lack one person. One, two, three, four, here is five. All right. All right. Eighty to eighty-five, stand, in E, eighty to eighty-five.

L-168 Now remember, each one of you with them cards is going to be called. Just don't worry. We'll get it. Eighty to eight-five, all right. Eighty-five to ninety. Two, three, four, five. E, eighty-five to ninety. Eighty-five, eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety. Ninety to a hundred, in E, let them stand. Come over on this side.

L-169 Brother Roy, help me count them, see if they're there, just a minute, while I'm... 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min

L-170 Now look, some of you here don't have prayer cards, yet you are sick. You want God's healing power, God's healing blessing. If that's so, raise up your hand, say, "I know God can heal me."

L-171 All right, if you will, go down there, Brother Roy, and help him real quick, if you will, 'cause we're running late. Get down and help them, if you will, real quick. And...

L-172 [A brother says to Brother Branham, "Be good to say it in Spanish."--Ed.] Yeah. He wants to say it in Spanish. [Someone says, in Spanish, "Del número noventa a cien, noventaiuno, noventaidos, noventaitres, noventaicuatro, noventaicinco, noventaiseis, hasta cien."] Yeah, he said that, see, here comes one now that wouldn't have come. See?

L-173 You would be surprised how it is overseas, maybe like one time in Africa. I had fifteen interpreters standing there, before about two hundred thousand people. And I'd say, "Jesus Christ, the Son of God," and it would go all down this line, and way down that line, to every tribe. And then you'd come back and have to think what you was saying. And just different... Oh, my. But I've seen thirty thousand blanket-natives give their heart to Jesus Christ, breaking their idols on the ground, like a dust storm. All right.

L-174 [Someone now says, in Spanish, "Mejor del número setentaicinco en adelante, del setentaicinco a cien."--Ed.] All right. Is there someone missing down there, or something another? Yeah, makes it sure. That's fine, brother. Say, did you ever... You know Brother Espinoza? ["No, I don't."] Yeah, he's from down here.

L-175 Anybody know Brother Espinoza, the min-... He was the one was with me over in Mexico City, when that little baby was raised from the dead that time. I--I just thought he... a little. You've heard the story of it, of course. It was in the Business Men's Voice and things here. I was just... I want to go down there again sometime. My, such humble people, and they really believed. They were... You see, the church down there is always promising something, they never get to it. But here in the Bible promise, we are at it; it's to us, we--we--we see it, and that makes it real. All right.

L-176 Now, now each one of you give me your undivided attention, for at least ten minutes.

L-177 Maybe I've called too many. I don't know, I--I might have done wrong. All right, they kind of got them turned around there. All right, just let them go all the way into the line, Billy, just as they--they are like that. And let's just--let's just begin, starting the prayer line. Come up. Get them a seat so they can set down here, Brother Roy, or something. In the hall there is room. I want to see the people watching.

L-178 See, there is one thing you can't do, you can't have a disturbance. The Holy Spirit is timid. How many knows that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] See, you must be obedient during the time.

L-179 How many has been in the meeting and see things go from one to another? Sure, you have. See them lose their mind, and go crazy; the seats fly around and around in the building, and devils was cast out. Some of them is paralyzed, and had to be packed out of the building; still paralyzed, too. Some of them died right there, right where they was standing; and dropped dead, just right before us. See, we're not playing church. It's the Holy Spirit. You must believe.

L-180 A man stood one time, trying to hypnotize me, there in Canada. What's that across from Detroit, what is that city up there? [Someone says, "Edmonton?"] No, across from Detroit. ["Windsor."--Ed.] Windsor. Yeah, he come over there. They had hired him to go hypnotize people, for the army. You know, make them bark like dogs, and things like that. And that guy setting out there; I keep feeling an odd spirit, and I noticed it. And the Holy Spirit said call him, said, "Son of the devil, why did he put that in your heart to come here? Because you've did that, they'll pack you out of here." He is still paralyzed. That's been about twelve years ago. They packed him out. Yeah.

L-181 God is still God. The thing is right, you see. Same! He never changes. If we can only believe, that's all we have to do is have faith. Now you look this a way and believe.

L-182 Now, if the Holy Spirit will, tonight, I don't know that He will. But if He will come now, what kind of a sign are we looking for today? The resurrection of Christ, the proof that Jesus is alive among us. Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Everybody remember? Don't the Bible...

L-183 Now have we got the sign of Sodom, in the world today? Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."] Got the sign of Noah, in the world today. Is that right? ["Amen."] Got all these other things? Now what did He say would take place 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min in that time? "The Son of man would be revealed in that day." Is that right? What is revealed? "Is made known." Anything that's made known is revealed. "The Son of man will be made known in that day." Well, if He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, wouldn't He do the same thing to make Himself known? How many believes that? ["Amen."--Ed.] All right. [Genesis 18:9-22], [Luke 17:30]

L-184 Now have you got your... everybody straightened out down there now in line? Now, friends, I don't know if we'll get to all of them.

L-185 I want you all just through watch real close, and be reverent, pray, believe. Now, please, see, especially if something happens to get away from me, don't everyone jump up and go to... See? Yeah.

L-186 About two months ago, in my church, one Sunday morning, there was something, Satan doing something to attract the attention of the people. There was an Englishman there, by the name of Way. He lives at my... You want his address, or we can have you to write. He sends tapes of the meeting from overseas. And the man resented what I said, heartily. And I looked down, I seen that horrible spirit upon him.

L-187 I had him on private interview, told him. I said, "Mr. Way, you have heart trouble." He even resented that. I said, "Why did you come to me for, then?" So about a month after that, he went to the doctor, and the doctor said he had a very bad heart.

L-188 So he come to the meeting that morning, and something was said; real hot-headed Englishman, you know, he resented that. His wife, a wonderful Norwegian woman, a nurse, and was sitting there with him. And I said something, and he resented it right quick, you know. And when he did... He was standing to the feet, and they were singing. And when He did, his head went back, his eyes just flipped right straight back, his face turned real dark red, like that desk there. He fell dead, to the floor.

L-189 Well, now, the church went to going on, people screaming. And I said, "Sit down. You are trained better than that. You are trained better than that."

L-190 And so his wife got down, was testing his heart. He was gone. She begin to scream. And I said, "Sister Way, just a minute, till I can get out of the pulpit here. We don't know what the Father..."

L-191 And there I went down there, he was just stiff. His eyes, there wasn't color on his eyes, was sticking right out like that, back. I couldn't feel no more heart than I could feel in that. [Brother Branham taps on something hard--Ed.] She said, "Oh!" Begin to scream, she begin...

L-192 I said, "Now we don't know what the Heavenly Father is going to do." And I said, "Maybe He did it for a purpose." I said, "Brother Way was resenting."

L-193 Said, "He whispered to me, that he was resenting what you said." And I said, "He oughtn't to have done that."

L-194 I said, "Heavenly Father, forgive Brother Way for his error, and I call for his spirit to return."

L-195 He said, "Brother Branham," and there he was alive again, standing among us. See? See? Don't get...

L-196 If anything gets away, just keep quiet, keep quiet. I seen it happen so many times. But if the church gets all tore up, then, you see, you grieve the Holy Spirit. Now if you want to praise God for something, that's good. But when everybody jumping and watching this, that, and people getting up, and walking around and talking to one another, it's just confusion. You... Jesus couldn't even heal the people that way, Himself. Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] When He was here, He led them outside the city like that, and put His hands on them and prayed for them.

L-197 Now, now, this lady standing here, she is a woman younger than I am. She looks healthy and strong. I don't know. Now, see, the church of yesterday, God's vindication time; lay hands upon her and pray for her, let her go, see if she had faith to be healed. That's the way God did it. But He promised something else now, see, the Word, a promise for today. I'm sure you understand what I mean.

L-198 Now I'm getting transposition here somewhere. So... [Brother Branham adjusts the microphone--Ed.] Yeah, I 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min think this is better now.

L-199 Now, if this lady... I don't know her, but the Holy Ghost does know her.

L-200 Now here is exactly a Bible picture, a panoramic. If you was ever over there, just like now, that well is still there, and vines growed up over the top. Jesus met a woman and He told her what her trouble was, and she knew that was the sign of the hour, that the Messiah was there. Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] She knew. She knew it.

L-201 Well, if He is the same today, and promised to reveal Himself the same, then it'd have to be His sign again. [Hebrews 13:8]

L-202 Now I hope everybody understands that I'm not meaning that's me, or I'm not meaning it's my brothers here, or some man out there. I mean it's Jesus, see, Christ, not... the anointed, see. See, He died that He might cause His ministry to be carried on by His Church that recognizes His Word. That don't mean that made--made anything different for me than it does one of these man here, not a bit, or one out there. We are all sinners saved by grace.

L-203 But it's His promise! He promised to do it. And that's the reason I'm standing here now, because He promised it, and He said, "Go do it." So, that, there is no fear then. Now, lady, I want you to look at me, just a moment.

L-204 Teaching and preaching. Usually when I had my most successful meetings, in discernment, and so forth, is when it used to be the manager preached, Mr. Baxter and them would preach a while. And I didn't have to do nothing but walk out on the platform, come right out of the room from somewhere, praying, walk right out. They already had the prayer line lined up. I just went right in, see. But, now, you have to swing yourself back around again.

L-205 Preaching is a gift, inspired--inspired preaching. See? And the gift, some are apostles, some prophets, some teachers, some pastors, some evangelists. That's the gifts that's in the Church. See? But it's possible we could have more than one, like Paul, or any of those. Now, as--as long as there is apostles, there has got to be a prophet. As long as there is a prophet, there has got to be an--an evangelist. Why is it ministers say, "There is a pastor and evangelist, but there is no prophet"? See, that's picking what you want to, making It say something It doesn't. But God is His Own interpreter of His Word. He says whether It's right or not. [Ephesians 4:7-15]

L-206 Now if the Holy Spirit will reveal to me something you've done, or who you are, or whatever. I mean, I don't know, see. It's just like a dream; you see something, it just goes back. And whatever I say...

L-207 What I see, I say. See? And then that's a sign, see, and there is the Voice of the sign. The sign is to do it; the Voice is what it says. Then if that's true, and that's all Truth, then what I'm preaching here on this Word has got to be true, 'cause that's the credentials of the calling. Now hasn't that been proved by the Bible tonight? Now does the audience believe that with all your heart? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Now this ought to settle it.

L-208 Now, I don't know the woman. Here is my hand up, and here is the Word of God, and here is ministers set, see, I don't know the woman. I've never seen her in my life, as I know it, and we're strangers one to another. I have no way of knowing. If that's right, just so the people know, raise up your hand so the people will see. Now can we be like those people at Sychar?

L-209 Now look on me. I mean like Peter and John, passed through the gate called Beautiful. Now look. [Acts 3:1-10]

L-210 See, Jesus attracted her attention. See? He knew He had to go up there. The Father had sent Him up there, but He didn't know... The woman come out, and He thought that must be it. See? And then He talked to her till He found out what her trouble was, then He told her. [John 4:3-28]

L-211 That's what I'm doing right now. It's me getting myself out of the way, so He can talk. Now, yes, I can tell you what's wrong with the woman, by the grace of God.

L-212 Her trouble is, she has tumors, and those tumors are in the bowels. [The sister says, "Yes."] Exactly right. Do you believe that He will heal that and make it well? You, you believe it? Got somebody else you was praying for, too, haven't you? Do you believe He'll heal his eyes and make him well, your little boy? See, just saying that one thing, to 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min break it down. See? All right. Go ahead now, believe it.

L-213 She didn't catch it at first, 'cause she was holding that on her mind. I seen a Light kept flashing back over her again like that, 'cause she was praying for something else. And, whatever it was, there it was. See? See?

L-214 See, if you'd just believe! Oh, if you could explain it! Now that ought to make every person in here... Just that one person, ought to make every person in here believe right now. Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-215 How do you do? Now we are strangers to one another, too, I suppose. [The sister says, "That's right."] We are strangers. I have no idea about you, who you are, where you come from, or--or anything about you. But God knows about you. Now if He will reveal to me what your trouble is, will you believe me to be His servant? ["Amen."--Ed.] Now, now be just as quietly as you can.

L-216 Now, yes, you're--you're suffering with a high blood pressure, that's right, caused from a nervous condition that makes your blood go high. And--and you get wore out real fast, many times. A very good person, see. See? Not a hitchhiker; she believes. She really believes. Yes, sir. And I--I'm so thankful for that. [The sister says, "I prayed for strength, Brother Branham."--Ed.]

L-217 And, say, by the way; being that you're such a nice person. You have really a big family. Your husband is sick, too. [The sister says, "Yes"--Ed.] He has high blood pressure, too. ["Yes."] He also has heart trouble. ["That's right."] You've got a son, and he's got heart trouble. And then you got one that you're worried about. ["Yes."] There is something dark. The boy is shadowed. He's a drinker; he is alcohol drinking. And that's right. Isn't that right? Just go on; it's all right. Believe now. Just go on, I think it'll be all right if you'll just go on and believe it.

L-218 "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to them that believe." If--if you can believe that what God said is the Truth, that settles it. Don't you think that's right? Isn't that the Truth? Isn't that what He said? He made the promise. So, if He made the promise, that settles it. He said, "If thou canst believe, all things are possible." [Matthew 19:26], [Mark 10:27]

L-219 Now you think them people has to--to have that? They don't. They don't have to be standing here on the platform. They don't. They don't have to be here, not at all.

L-220 She is just having a wonderful time out there. What about you out in the audience, do you believe with all your heart? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Every one of you?

L-221 This lady setting right here looking at me, right there, she suffers with heart trouble; the brown dress on, dark hair, wearing glasses. You have heart trouble. As soon as it was mentioned about the lady there, something struck upon you. That's right. Now you're a way away from me, but you touched Something, didn't you? Do you believe now with all your heart? If you... Raise up your hand, if that's the truth. All right.

L-222 Now will you do me a favor? That lady setting next to you, that's got her hand up there, she is suffering with a high blood pressure. And if she'll believe with all of her heart, it'll leave her, too. If that's right, raise up your hand. All right.

L-223 Now tell me what they touched, what they touched. [Congregation says, "Jesus."--Ed.]

L-224 Do you believe God can heal heart trouble, setting there, praying, too? Do you believe He would heal your heart? He would if you would let Him. Just, He has done it if you'll just believe it, but first you've got to believe it.

L-225 You must believe it. You're obligated to believe it, because that's the only way that God can heal. Do you believe that with all your heart? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-226 This lady setting here with the dark-looking dress on, something wrong with her neck. Do you believe that God will make it well, lady? See? See, you don't have to be up here on the platform. See?

L-227 Now look, just as soon as that Light left her, It went right back; a lady started crying, sitting right behind her. The lady right behind her started weeping. What was it? She had a real strange feeling come over her. If that's right, lady, right behind her, raise up, raise up your hand. That's right, a real strange feeling come over you. Now, the reason It did that, because He wants to heal you from that stomach trouble, and make you well. Do you believe He'll do it? Amen. 64-0214, The Voice Of The Sign, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 84 min See, if you'll just believe, just believe!

L-228 That man sitting right there looking at me so curious. It's a rheumatism. Sitting out there, on the end of the seat out there, do you believe that God will heal you of the rheumatism and make you well? Would you believe it? God will make you well and heal you, if you can believe it.

L-229 Don't you see that He is just the same yesterday, today, and forever? Can't you believe that with all your...

L-230 What if I didn't say nothing to you? You know I know what's wrong with you. What if I didn't say anything, but just let you go on through, would you believe it with all your heart? I believe you got healed standing right there. So just go, believe it. Go, believe it now, with all of your heart.

L-231 Do you believe that God healed you, and will heal your dad, too, and make both of you well? Do you think he'll come out of the hospital, with that heart trouble?...?... If you believe it! See?

L-232 If you'll just only believe, that's all you have to do. See? Don't you see it's Him? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-233 How do you do, lady? Look at me just a minute. You have weaknesses. That's right. Your mother is sick, too, here. Isn't she? [The sister says, "Yes."--Ed.] She has heart trouble. Do you believe that God will heal your mother of her heart trouble? Say, by the way, just a minute, your husband gets healed of that stomach trouble, too. Say, just a moment, your daughter had something wrong with her throat. Do you believe He healed that also? ["Yes."] Yes, your grandchild has fainting spells, like passing out, a little baby. Do you believe that's healed, too? All right, go believe it.

L-234 Hallelujah! What are we doing? Why don't we believe Him? Are you ready to believe Him?

L-235 Then let's stand up on our feet while He is calling, the Holy Ghost. Stand up and give Him praise, and believe Him right now, every one of you. I pronounce that the Holy Ghost is here, the Bible is fulfilled. And in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, let every--every one of you give Him praise now, and you'll be healed. Amen.
