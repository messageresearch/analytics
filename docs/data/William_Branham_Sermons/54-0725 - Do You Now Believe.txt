--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 All things are possible, only believe; Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only believe. Shall we bow our heads just a moment. Our kind Heavenly Father, we are grateful to Thee tonight, for this great time of fellowship in Chicago with Thy people. We thank Thee above all things for the Lord Jesus Christ, Who has made this possible through His sovereign grace. And we pray that You'll bless the Brother Boze, and his church, and all the churches that are cooperating with us here, all the visiting members of the body of Christ. And even to the sinner, tonight, may they be blessed and saved this night. Grant that many sick people will be healed because of the Presence of our Lord Jesus. And we pray, Father, that You'll watch over all of us as we separate tonight, going to our different homes and places of duty in the harvest field here on earth. And perhaps, before I can return to Chicago, many, many hard battles lay ahead. I pray that You'll help us, Lord. And remember me, my Father, that--that You'll bless me and help me to speak to Thy people the kind words of our Lord Jesus. And now, may this be a great meeting tonight because of the Presence of the Lord Jesus, for we ask it in His Name. Amen.

L-2 It would be hard for me to express my feelings and gratitude towards the Philadelphian Church, and Brother Boze, and all those who have been cooperating and helping in this meeting, and to all the laity, the members of other churches who's come in, packed the auditorium out, helped us pay the finance and all. We're so happy for that. May the Lord bless you abundantly. And I know He will. He promised that He would. And I know that He will. And now, tonight, in the closing service, it's usually this night that the great anticipations strike the people, and there's really more healings, perhaps, on the last night than all the other nights put together, because they are pressing and trying to get into the Kingdom of God. And we pray that it'll be greater than ever tonight because of the great need.

L-3 Now, Chicago has been on my heart for a long time. And I noticed across the countries where other great meetings in California and different parts of the country, but Chicago in the full Gospel ranks has been left out to an extent, a few churches here, struggling. And I hope that our heavenly Father in His grace, because that you given me the welcome back, that someday will let me come to Chicago for several weeks, to stay for a great meeting here in Chicago, that the Lord will just bless. Just the time we get started, it's time to stop, go somewhere else. On the return, I don't aim to do that. I want to stay till the Lord says, "It's time to move somewhere else," and then I can catch and be with more people. Many times, people being healed, they get out among critics. In a few days they, when the symptoms arise, why then, they don't know what to do because the revival's over. I like to stay sometime and see it, what it would happen. I've never done it yet, and I trust that I'll be able to do it soon.

L-4 I thank you all. God bless you all. If I've left out anyone, I didn't mean to. Even to the stage hands, they've all been real kind; shake my hand when I come in at night and very nice and kind. God bless them and bless this school, let us have this auditorium. We just thank God for a open door yet in America, where the Gospel can be preached in the power and demonstration of the Spirit. May the Lord bless them greatly.

L-5 Now, there isn't time for speaking tonight. I'm just going to read the Scripture and have prayer, God willing. Can I depend on you when in India and different parts of the world? It isn't like it is in the homelands. Here I'm setting among friends and believers. In there, you're amongst witch doctors and all kinds of evil spirits that would... Everything that they can see in the way of the supernatural, they'll come and challenge it. And you better know what you're speaking of when you accept their challenge. Can I depend on you praying for me while I'm over, trying to take others this Gospel? Thank you, kindly. And I pray that--that--the blessings will be with you.

L-6 Now, in the Scripture, the 2nd chapter of Luke. And before I read this, though, I'd forgot to make mention of these 54-0725, Do You Now Believe?, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 51 min other ministering brother. Brother Huckstra here--I... He's been a bosom friend of mine for years. I remember the first time I met Brother Huckstra. In Indianapolis, Indiana, there was a boy dying with polio in the iron lung. And I went into the upper room of the man's house and prayed. The Lord came down and give a vision and said to--what was the matter with the boy--to take him the communion, because one time he'd been refused to take the communion on account of his age. And they had no communion at this house, so I went to Brother Huckstra's, and he furnished the communion. I take it and give it to the boy in the iron lung and pronounced the blessings of God on him and the boy's living in Indianapolis today. We thank the good Lord for His mercy for that.

L-7 Brother Ekberg here... Well, to my way of thinking, his--his singing is sublime. And how I appreciate such wonderful singing. A--my heart is going to Brother Ekberg, that Almighty God will deliver him from this thing that's bothering him now. I can't see a voice like that, silent... and just a young man. I believe that He will find... If we never have a prayer for him in this building, I believe that Brother Ekberg will find that he is going to be a well man. I believe it.

L-8 In the Gospel according to Saint Luke, I want to read about two places or three in the Scripture. The 28th verse: Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; the same... was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he would not see death, before he'd seen the Lord's Christ. And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when they brought--the parent brought... the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, Lord, now letteth... thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: For my eyes have seen thy salvation, This was Simeon, waiting for the consolation of the Holy Spirit which was to be given to him and to see the Christ.

L-9 Now, also it is written over in the Acts of the Apostles, the 2nd chapter and the 22nd verse: Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by... signs and wonders, and miracles, which God did by him... as you your all-self also know.

L-10 And then Jesus, in the 7--16th chapter of Saint John, the disciples had always wondered why He taught in a round about way in parables. And the 16th chapter and the--the 29th verse we read: His disciples said unto Him, Lo, now speakest Thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. Now we are sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou comest forth from God. Jesus answering them, Do you now believe? And that's my question to the church tonight: Do you now believe Jesus the same yesterday, today and forever?

L-11 On earth we found Him and has pictured Him to you through the week... This is not a--a some church theology; it's the Scriptures that we're speaking: that our Lord Jesus Christ came to earth and was Jehovah God in-veiled in flesh in order to take away sin and sickness from the earth. God was in Christ reconcile the world to Himself. He said, "A... I came from God; I go to God. A little while and the world will see Me no more. Yet ye shall see Me, for I'll be with you, even in you, to the end of the world." Now, He promised that. He promised His disciples the things that He did, the disciples would do also to the end of the world, even more things than He did.

L-12 Now, we notice what kind of a person He was. Many people has a wrong conception of Christ. They think that He was more like a totem pole or something, and people went along and touched Him and so forth and was made well. If they had faith, they was made well. But Jesus plainly was not a Fellow to boast and say, "Bring me this sick person and I'll heal them." Jesus plainly said that He did nothing except His Father showed Him first what to do. We all believe He was full of mercy and compassion, do we, all of us? We believe that the very heart of God was in Him. He had mercy and compassion on the people. But let's watch and see how loving and compassionate He was.

L-13 He passed through a pool called Bethesda one day. Now, there laid multitudes of impotent folk: lame, halt, blind, and withered. And here come that merciful Lord Jesus, moving right among those people, seemingly with no 54-0725, Do You Now Believe?, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 51 min compassion at all. Moved by the crippled, blind, withered, halt, till He found a man laying on a pallet, a little bed, laying on the floor somewhere. And He said, "Will thou be made whole?" He said, "I have no one to put me in the water." He said, "Take up thy bed and go into the house." Now, we wonder why that He'd leave all those important cases go, and go to this one, and heal him, and walk away, and leave all that audience laying there. That's Saint John the 5th chapter. All Bible readers are familiar with it.

L-14 Now, here's Jesus' answer concerning it, in the 19th verse. He said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in Himself, but what He sees the Father doing, that doeth the Son likewise. The Father worketh and I worketh hitherto." In other words, Jesus did not do anything while He was here on earth, in the way of performing signs and wonders, until He saw the Father show Him a vision on what to do. Chase back down the Bible with the prophets and find out if it wasn't this same thing. We have had the wrong slant. Even the flesh of Jesus Christ couldn't glory in the Presence of God, because He said, "It's not me that doeth the works; It's My Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works."

L-15 And we notice Him, when He was here on earth, when His ministry begin to bloom into it's very beginning, there was a man by the name of Philip got converted. He went and found his friend, Nathanael, and he said, "Come." He found Nathanael under a tree and he said, "Come, see a... Who we have found: Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Joseph." Well, this man, being a just man, and kinda shocked him a little bit when he first thought of a change in the ministry, and he said, "Could any good thing come out of Nazareth?" He said, "Come, see." And when Philip was in the audience, somewhere around where Jesus was speaking, Jesus turned to him or maybe he come into the prayer line, some way... Jesus said, "Behold, an Israelite, in whom there is no guile." Now, if I'd say the same thing: "A Christian, a just person, truthful..." And it astonished him: "How'd He know I was believer?" He said, "Whence knowest Thou me, Rabbi?" He said, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the tree, I saw you." Now, what would be the analysis or the--or the remarks of the modern theologians today when a remark like that would be made? They'd say, "That guy's a fortuneteller." Well, the theologians of that day said the same thing: "He's Beelzebub, the chief of the fortunetellers." But Nathanael had a different idea. He said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God," and a--or "the King of Israel," rather, "Thou art Christ, the--the King of Israel." And He said, "Because I told you that I saw you under the tree, do you believe? You'll see greater things than this."

L-16 And one day there was a man came up to Him; He knew his name. He said, "Your name is Simon, but you will be called Peter from hence forth. A woman one time, pressing through the crowd, touched His garment, went her way back out into the crowd, but Jesus had a way of knowing. He looked around, and He saw the woman that had the blood issue. He said, "Thy faith has saved thee." That's what He did. We find out that the Father revealed to Him what He wanted Him to do. He submitted Hisself to the Father, listened not to the world, but He done only as the Father showed Him. These things Jesus did then as Jesus of A.D. '33. The Jesus of 1954 does the same thing, for He is the resurrected One. You believe He raised from the dead? He lives tonight. He isn't dead; He's a living right here among us, tonight. Well then, if He is the same, yesterday, today, and forever, He has the hands of the church for His, the eyes of the church for His, and He operates through the church to prove His resurrection.

L-17 Now, one little thing: There was some disciples one day, who were marveling; they loved Him. Perhaps many of the same kind here tonight, but after they had knowed He was dead, they were sad as they went on the road to Emmaus. And a Man come out and walked along, a Man dressed like other men, no different. He just looked like other men. And He walked with them for awhile. He begin to speak to them. And they noticed that His speech was, kinda made people listen to Him. And as He walked along... and when He got them inside, the world closed out, He done something a 54-0725, Do You Now Believe?, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 51 min little different than what ordinary men does, and by this, they recognized that it was the Lord Jesus. He is... Their eyes were opened, knowing that He alone could do it this way. And they rushed back to the city from where they come, and they said, "Did not our hearts burn within us as we walked along the road."

L-18 And my sincere prayer to you, my audience tonight, and the citizens of the Kingdom of heaven, I pray that our Lord Jesus Christ, as I contend that He has risen from the dead, lives in His church tonight, doing the same thing, I pray that He will do something a little different for you tonight, a little different from what the regular church you go to or something, that He will make Hisself known to you, that when you leave tonight, you'll say, "Did not our hearts burn within us, for He made Hisself known to us. The way He did tonight is the same way He did when in the Bible days. God grant it to each one of you. May there not be a feeble one among us when this service is over. There, I see two wheelchairs setting here. And I--I--I trust that they'll be walking. I now... I trust that God will bless us the exceedingly abundantly.

L-19 Now, just one word of prayer: Father, in the Name of Thy Son, the Lord Jesus, may this service be taken into Thy care, just at this time, for a special blessing. Thanking You for all has happened, and I pray that You'll now anoint Your servant and anoint this audience, every servant in here. And may God get glory out of the service, for we ask it in the Name of Thy beloved Child, the Lord Jesus. Amen. If they--the organ will play... pleasely, "Abide With Me," or something on that line and I will... We'll have to call a few people to the platform to be prayed for. I'm asking you, my lovely audience tonight... I know you're tired standing, and I won't be long. Now, if the Lord Jesus comes tonight and reveals Hisself to us in the same manner that the Bible said that He revealed Himself then, will all of you accept Jesus Christ to be the same today as He was then in the resurrection? If you will, raise your hands and just--just see? God bless you. Now, one hundred percent then be behind me, praying.

L-20 Now, there is the strangers in our gates; you never been to one of the services before, I just ask you to be real reverent, be quiet, don't move around. Just be--be studying. There'll be many here on the platform that will have prayer cards to be prayed for. There'll be many who does not have prayer cards to be prayed for. I ask you to do the same thing the woman with the blood issue did. I ask you to do the same thing that the blind man at the gate, perhaps a city block away from Jesus when He passed, so that the wall to the road was quite a distance. And thousands of people gathered in there and this poor man screaming, his faith stopped Jesus. He turned around and healed the blind man. Jesus will do the same thing for you tonight. He will--you--you'll--you can touch Him with the feeling of your infirmities, for He's the High Priest of your confession, setting there at the right hand of the Father, making intercessions upon your confession. I pray tonight that you'll be healed and saved from your sins. All right, Billy Paul what prayer cards did you give out? Is it... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-21 Comes on radio casts and things just merely to get your address to keep billing you. I don't mean that slandery or any, but I have no radio broadcast. I have nothing, and I just want to help you. See? So if you need a prayer cloth, just write me, and I'll send it to you if you don't get yours. Shall we bow our heads just a moment. Now, kind heavenly Father, the great Holy Spirit, Who led the children of Israel through the wilderness and cross the Red Sea, that crossed the Jordan into the promised land, giving them all things freely, by sovereign grace of God Who promised it... And before they left, He told Joshua that he--or Moses, that this land was already given: they just had to go and possess it. And now, we pray that You will bless these handkerchiefs. And we're taught that in the Bible they took the handkerchiefs off of the body of Paul; they laid them on the sick; evil spirits when out. We know we're not Saint Paul, but we know that Thou art still Jesus. So we pray that You'll honor the prayer of this church of--group of believing people tonight, as we send these handkerchiefs to the sick and the needy, in the Name of Your Child, Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you, brother.

L-22 All right, now, I believe we called to 10, is that right? Now, let's go to... You haven't got them all yet? All right, V-1 to 10. Now, there's somebody maybe deaf [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?... Now, to Him Who's able to keep us and bless us, I wonder if once more while they're--the ushers are helping keep the line in position down there, if you would 54-0725, Do You Now Believe?, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 51 min sing with me, "Only Believe." Instead of singing, "Only Believe," let's sing, "Lord, I Believe." All right, every one together. And I wonder while we do this, if a little testimony that we are believers, to the man that's standing next to us, every believer kinda raise up your hand like this and let's sing it together, "Lord, I believe." All right, brother. Lord, I believe, Lord, I believe, All things are possible, Lord, I believe; Lord, I believe, Lord, I believe, All things are possible, Lord I believe.

L-23 You're missing some? There's several of them missing. We hope that you get into the lines now, anyone... We called to how many? From 1 to 25, and if they are here, while, they are welcome to take their position in the--the line if they are here. Here... Did you have a prayer card, lady? You have one? All right. Now, anyone else of...? If the ushers will find her place and--and... We... Sometimes I get the mail back again, and it says, "No one told me; I was deaf. I--I didn't hear, or I couldn't get up and no one helped me." That's what makes it bad, you know, when they--poor people they--they, when they're called to their place.

L-24 Now, give me your attention now. Realizing, Christians, that positionally standing here. And if there's anyone in this building that I know... I know--that I know of... I'm not sure; I think this is Mr. and Mrs. Peterson setting here and Mr. and Mrs. Stadsklev setting here. And as far as I know that's all that I know in the building, looking around--outside of Brother Joseph, my son, and the brethren setting here. But the Lord Jesus Christ knows every one of you in the balcony, every one here. He knows you all. Now, if He will come tonight and manifest Hisself... Now, out there in the audience, you just start thinking this, "Lord Jesus, I'm in need. Thou art the Christ. I know You are. And Your Scripture said there would be Gospel like this preached to the last days. I believe You, and I want You to help me. You speak to Brother Branham, and tell him to--to just let me--give a vindication. I--I haven't no prayer card, and there's no way for me to ever get up there on the platform, but I want You to speak to him, and have him to turn around, and tell me what I must do." and see if He doesn't do it. Now, you just do that and see if He doesn't do it. Anywhere in the building...

L-25 Those without prayer cards, raise up your hands, that wants to be prayed for, raise up your hand, everywhere in the building, the balcony and ev... Well, it's just a massive... Well, you just keep believing; just believe with all your heart. Now, may the Lord Jesus bless and add to our gathering together tonight. Now, I will call the--the patient, if you will. Now, do you who realize and understand, stand in my place here, once... I guess there's pretty near three thousand people or close to it, here tonight in this auditorium. I don't know what the seating is... of what's standing and everything; there's probably that many. And you remember... Just above three thousand, Brother Joseph said.

L-26 Remember, friends, that there--in there, there's critics; in there, there's believers. And I'm here tonight as your brother, the believer, trying to represent the Lord Jesus Christ in His resurrected power. And this... lights this a way, and we know what it means. You pray for me. Now, here is the lady standing here. She's the first patient. The only thing I know about. She's just a lady standing there. I have never seen her. I guess we're strangers, are we? We are strangers. Never seen her in my life. God alone knows.

L-27 Now, what would our Lord Jesus (to you people for your first time), what would our Lord Jesus do if He was standing here? As far... If she needs healing... I don't know what her trouble's is, but if she needs healing, He would tell her, "I have already done that." When He died at Calvary, He healed every sick person in the world. Do you believe that? That's Scripture. He saved every sinner when He died at Calvary. The only thing you have to do now is to accept your salvation, your healing, from Him. As far as me healing or doing... I could not. It's just a gift as a seer to foresee what has been and see what will be.

L-28 Now, if the woman knows that I know nothing of her, and if the Lord Jesus was standing here, He would talk to her like He did the woman at the well. You notice, He said, "Bring Me a drink." She said, "It's not customary for Jews to ask Samaritans such." And the conversation went on, until after while He found where her trouble was; He caught her human spirit and saw where her trouble was. He said, "Go get your husband." 54-0725, Do You Now Believe?, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 51 min She said, "I have none." Said, "You have five." She said, "I perceive that You're a prophet." And she run into the city, said, "Come, see a Man that told me everything I did." He only told her one thing. But if... God could have showed Him all things, don't you believe that?

L-29 Now, the woman standing here, we've never met before in life; we're just strangers. I just want to talk to you, lady. And I just want you to relax yourself and stand here. And it's a little hard, 'cause when you turn, there's people all around, and every one's a spirit. Every spirit moving in... Now, see, we don't deal with the flesh; it's spirit alone. But if the Lord Jesus would come to me and let me know something of you like He did in the Bible time, would you believe then that I have told the truth? Would that be Him testifying that I have told the truth? You believe that? Well, may He grant it, sister, for your glory and for your--whatever your desire is. You are...

L-30 Now, now, the Angel of God that you see in the picture is here now. He is here now at the platform. And in the Name of Jesus Christ I take this meeting in my control for the glory of God and for the proof of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. You are here for someone else. That someone else is a mother. Your mother is suffering with a--a mental trouble. You're bothered with the same. And you desire tonight, to be healed and your mother to get well. That is true. Come here. You believe that Jesus Christ will bring your mother home and will grant this to you? Our kind heavenly Father, we know that this is only the working of the demon that would harm her poor mother and would make her ill. I pray for her, that You'll heal both mother and daughter, and may they be completely delivered as I send this blessing in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, sister. Go; don't doubt now, mother will come home. Yes.

L-31 All right, would you bring your patient. Be reverent, just as reverent as you can be. Do you love the Lord Jesus? How do you do, sir. Yeah. Would you come just a little closer. I might speak to you. You're conscious that something is going on. That is, sir, the--the anointing of the Holy Spirit. You--you're conscious of that. You know that something is going on. And that isn't to hurt you, my brother. That is to do you good; that's to help you. And seeing we men here, has met on earth. And you are a believer. I--your spirit... And you believe me. Your spirit is welcome.

L-32 Now, that would be the same thing like our Lord Jesus said to Philip. When he come up, He knew he was a believer--or Nathanael, rather. Now, the next thing is, what would our Lord Jesus reveal to us tonight, that would help you? Now, I'm--I trust that He will do it. And in doing so, will you believe then? You are conscious, sir, that something's going on. There's a--a feeling like you haven't felt before. It's a awe, sacred feeling. I want the audience to watch the face of the patients, how tears stream to their eyes as soon as they come near. The man standing here knows that that's true. That is the God's truth. Now, you can call it whatever you wish: that'll determine your--your destination, but I claim that It is the power of the Lord Jesus Christ that's raised from the dead.

L-33 You believe that, do you sir? I believe that. You are suffering, my brother... I have noticed you with an examination over the heart. You have heart trouble. If that--you have heart trouble. And that is true. They've announced you of having heart trouble. It's a bad case of it, blocking in the heart. And then another thing, you have a companion, a wife. And that wife is suffering and she has cancer. She has cancer. She's setting in the audience now. Her spirit is moving in here, the pulling... That is true, that is right. And say... You are a minister. You've preached the Gospel. And you're longing even at your age to be well to go back to preach the Gospel again. Yes, sir, that is true. And your name is Robert--Reverend Robert L. Adkins, is that right? Never seen you in my life. Go home, Mr. Adkins. Lay your hands on your wife. Your heart trouble has left you, and your wife will be healed. Go preach the Gospel in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. God bless you, my brother. Go rejoicing.

L-34 Have faith, don't doubt. Just believe that all things are possible to them that believe. Do you believe that? Have faith in God, and you shall have what you've ask for, if you just believe and have faith. That's all you need to do is to say that you are a believer and you have faith in the Lord Jesus. Now, be reverent, you shall see the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ. 54-0725, Do You Now Believe?, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 51 min You believe the Lord heals you of that bladder trouble, that gallbladder trouble, setting right down there in that... You believe that the Lord Jesus... You do? You may stand up on your feet. Your faith has healed you, sister. God bless you; you may go home. Jesus Christ makes you well. You have a high blood pressure, lady, the setting right in there. Do you believe the Lord Jesus healed you? You were setting there praying about it. Will you stand up and accept your healing? The la... God bless you, you can go home now; your blood pressure has left you. Amen. Your faith makes you well. You believe it? I want you to believe the Lord Jesus. Believe in the balcony. Are you believing up there? God bless you. Distance means nothing to the Lord Jesus. Have faith in God. His resurrected Presence is here now.

L-35 Would you come, sir. I suppose we are strangers to each other. You're conscious that you're standing in the presence of something besides your brother? That's the Lord Jesus Christ in His resurrected power. Sir, you are a very sick man. You've been attending doctors, and they've examining you. And I hear one tell you that you have between six months and two years to live, because you are dying with cancer. That is the truth. You believe me as God's prophet or His servant? You believe if I would ask God along with His church, that you would get well? I hear someone... Your--your name is--is Glen, and your last name is Hill. And you live at 2647 Melvin Ave... Something like that... Me--Mel--Melver or Me-- [The patient pronounces it Menarr, for Brother Branham--Ed.] Avenue, Chicago. Is that true? Return to your home now, shouting and praising God. Satan, I condemn you in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, come out of the man... and make him well, through Jesus Name.

L-36 Brother Ekberg, put a band around your leg tonight, a string, the one that's swollen. Measure your limb. And in seventy-two hours, put the same band around it and cut off how much it's shrunk and bring it to me in California for a testimony. Amen...?... Do you believe me to be His servant? With all your heart you believe it? You suffer with a trouble that's in your chest. You--you have developed that. And you work in a--some kind of a place like a factory or something like that; you had been working. You are not from this country. You come--you're Scandinavian, Norwegian. You come over here from Norway. And you went to work in a place and has developed a lung trouble. In Norway you was a woman minister. You preached and so forth over there. I see blue waters between us and you have crossed them. That is true. Come near and receive the blessing of God. O Lord God, Creator of heavens and earth, let Thy Spirit come upon this woman now, and bless her, and take this curse off of her in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Cursed be thou, Satan. Leave the woman. Return to your ministry.

L-37 Setting right there, sir... I see a vision. It's a man that's got a back trouble. And come... You're Norwegian also. And your back is bothering you, and you was hurt. And you were on water in a boat when you were hurt. When I spoke that to that woman, something happened to you. Move yourself up and down like this. Your back is healed.

L-38 You believe? With all your heart...? Do you believe me to be His servant? You're suffering with a something that's... It's--it's a growth.

There sets a lady right straight up here with a black dress on, setting high in the balcony; that struck her. She's had a skin disease, setting right up behind these posts like.

Come here just a moment. The kindness of our Lord Jesus, the woman knowing that You're here, moving, operating Your great power through the church...

Go rejoicing, and happy, and praising God for your healing. All right.

L-41 You also suffer with the same. You have been to some doctors. They've given you an examination. And that examination he tells you that you must have an operation. And the operation... The entire female section must be taken out. But do you believe that Jesus Christ will make you well? You've been thirsting for God. You been hungering for a closer walk. It hasn't been but just a day or two ago till you were praying for this thing. That is... I'm not reading your mind; that's the truth. You believe, that right now that Spirit that's on you, that's on me and on you, has healed you of this female trouble? You accept it right now with all your heart? Will you seek God till He pours out the Holy Spirit upon you, if He will heal you without your operation, will you do it? Almighty God, I bless the woman in the Name of Jesus Christ and curse this disease. Come out of her, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Go rejoicing, sister. God bless you, yes.

Faith is moving; the building's becoming milky to me.) This woman standing here is suffering with a tumor. That's right, lady. And there's many more out there suffering. Every person suffering with a tumor, stand on your feet right now. Every person with a tumor stand to your feet, everywhere. Almighty God, Satan knows that his time is come. He's defeated tonight through the cross of Christ. I now adjure thee, thou demon, you're exposed; come out of these people; in the Name of Jesus Christ, depart from them. Amen. Go home. All of you, be made well through Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.

L-43 You believe with all your heart? It's your blood, diabetes. It would be good to get away from that old insulin and stuff, and not have to take it. How many here's suffering with diabetes, stand to your feet right now, and be healed at the same time. Here it is. This is what God's wanting to do: heal you all. Stand to your feet right now, every person with diabetes. Almighty God, this enemy tonight, is exposed here at the platform.

I see you getting away from a table. 54-0725, Do You Now Believe?, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 51 min You got stomach trouble. It's a ulcerated stomach; it's bothered you for some time. You can't eat stuff, especially greases and things. It gives you... Sometimes you think you have heart trouble; it smothers you when you lay down. It's gas in the stomach. It isn't a heart trouble; it's gas on the stomach. Ever person in here that's suffering with a stomach trouble, stand to your feet at this time for the defeat. Hallelujah! Thou demon, you've lost the battle. Come out of these people, I adjure thee, by the Name of the living God, Jesus Christ. Leave them. I feel the pressure leave me.

L-46 Moving up close to me now comes a spirit of death: black, hideous. The veil is parting back. I see a woman examine... It's--it's a cancer. It's come to take your life. Jesus Christ come to give you life. Who do you believe tonight, the Lord Jesus? Every cancer sufferer in the building stand to their feet at this time for the defeat of one of the archenemies of the human race. Will you stand to your feet? Thou demon called cancer, you might hide from the doctor, but you can't hide from God. You're exposed. Come out of these people. In the Name of Jesus Christ you are defeated. Amen. Go on your road.

L-47 I have never noticed this before, but the pressure that's a raising in the building when prayer is made, the pressure leaves if--if He heals. I've never seen it like this before. Pressure...

Now, go eat whatever you want to, Jesus Christ makes you well. You believe? All right. Looky here at me just a moment. You believe me to be His prophet? There's something strange about you. It's a...

Heart trouble means no more to God than nothing else. Every person that's with heart trouble stand to your feet at this time, and say, "I accept the Lord Jesus Christ as my Healer," in a glorious shout. Almighty God, I condemn the enemy of this woman's body and the enemy of everyone in here. Come out, Satan, in Jesus Christ's Name. Something strange happened at that time. Someone who was here, that's suffering with a heart trouble, that was in a wheelchair, should have raised at the time and have been healed. Someone that's bound in a wheelchair, that's crippled up by a devil of heart trouble should have raised. I didn't get the vision of the person, just who it was. It looked like a dark complected person that raised.

L-49 All right, bring your--bring your patient. You believe with all your heart that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, will make you well standing here? O God, I condemn this enemy and ask that he goes through Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, sister, go believing with all your heart.

L-50 Bow your heads just a moment will you? Reverent. Almighty God, a deaf spirit moving over this woman... It's the enemy's business to do this: cause her to be killed. But Thou art here to deliver her. Faith cometh by hearing, hearing of the Word. She cannot... she cannot hear; how could faith come? I ask that You deliver the woman. Come out of her, Satan. I adjure thee to leave the woman, in the Name of Jesus Christ, leave her. Can you hear me? Can you hear me now? I miss a whisper. You're healed; your nervousness is gone. Go on your road rejoicing and praising God and you can hear. 54-0725, Do You Now Believe?, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 51 min Let's say, "Thanks be to God." You were healed when you come up through the line down there, when the heart trouble group was healed awhile ago, you was healed also. Go on your road rejoicing, thanking God and saying, "Praise be to God."

L-51 Would you come, lady? You believe with all your heart? You believe me to be His servant? If God will reveal to me your trouble, will you accept your healing? It's in your back. Is that right? Jesus Christ can make you whole now. Do you believe that? Father, in the Name of Thy Son, the Lord Jesus, I condemn this devil that's bound this woman. You laid your hand on one that had been bound for many years and loosed her. And I do likewise tonight to this woman in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Go on your road rejoicing, sister and be made well for God's glory.

L-52 All right. You believe, sir, with all your heart? How many in here believes right now for your healing? This would be a marvelous time for everybody to be healed. I'm going to ask you to do something. Oh, here's the lady. Oh, sister, why, you should rise. You should believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Put your hands over on her while the rest of the audience puts their hands on one another for a--a prayer just now. Come, sir. You believe that Jesus Christ is here to make you well? Satan, leave the man in Jesus Christ's Name.

L-53 There she is, up out of the--up out of the chair. The power of God... I seen the woman in a vision going without the chair. There she is. Let's say, "Praise be to God." Afflicted, twisted, and years, setting in a wheelchair, she rises in the Name of Jesus Christ. There's a out--there she stands healed and well. Every person in here wants to get healed, stand to your feet right now. Rise up out of the wheelchairs. Throw away your crutches. Almighty God, in the Name of Thy Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, I condemn every devil spirit. I liberate these people through Jesus Christ's Name. Satan, you're a loser; you're defeated. Come out of the people in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
