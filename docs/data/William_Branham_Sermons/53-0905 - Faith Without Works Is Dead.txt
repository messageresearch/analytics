--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Remain standing just a moment while we bow our heads for prayer. Our heavenly Father, we thank Thee for this challenging faith tonight. "Now I believe." This old song has roared out across the world, "All things are possible, only believe." We think of one day coming down off of the mount where our Master, coming to the powerless disciples, and someone come with a boy with epilepsy and said, "I brought him to Your disciples, and they couldn't cure him." Said, "Can You do anything for him?" He said, "I can, if you will only believe, for all things are possible to them that believe."

L-2 O God, help us like that father tonight, and crying in distress, "Lord, I believe. Help Thou my unbelief." And may this be tonight a great night for the Kingdom of God. May we see the exceedingly, abundantly tonight bestowed upon every believer in here, for we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. May be seated. God bless...?... Be with each and every one of you. Seldom I get to come into the meeting like this that--to hear Brother Baxter's stirring messages. And I got in a little early, and the boy was standing out there on the side of the street. And we come in, and set down over there, and I got to hear that. That was a marvelous message. Shamgar with his ox goad slaying the Philistines... And you ought to have it way down deep in your hearts now.

L-3 Tomorrow afternoon, the Lord willing, I want to speak here at the tabernacle. You're all invited to come out. I trust that tomorrow afternoon will produce what I am praying for God to do, to heal every sick person of any type that's in the building, tomorrow afternoon. Now, I don't only tomorrow afternoon, I hope all in here tonight get it, and tomorrow afternoon a new group, or whatever it is that comes in, will receive the same. It's cool now, and I think we can have a little message, if the Lord willing. It falls my part tomorrow, if the Lord permits, to--to speak a little, to preach, and I trust that our Lord will bless us. then tomorrow night, is another service of the healing campaign. And Monday afternoon, I think... I don't know how they're working for Monday, but I know Monday afternoon there'll be speaking again, and Monday night that closes the meeting. We hope you're all here, and God's blessings be upon you all.

L-4 Now, I wish to read some out of the Bible found over in the Book of James, and we'll go right straight now. Just ten minutes of time to start the prayer line and we... I'm sorry last evening that I didn't give out just what I was--was going to say. Tonight we were going to try to pray for as many people as wanted to be prayed for and line the people up and pray for them. Dear Christian friends, I haven't one time, since the meeting has been here (See?)n one person that come to the platform, across here, or was spoken to, but what was healed. See? I haven't seen one yet. Now, that's marvelous. Some of them deaf, some dumb, some... well, just... some crippled setting in chairs, and some on cots and stretchers, and wherever it have...

L-5 Now, as I tried to explain it last night (See?), God does it. See? He has already done it. You have to accept it. Many of them in dying condition has been healed. Now, the Lord bless you each one is my prayer. Is... Before we start the service, I wonder my friend, Mr. Osborn, Brother Osborn's in the building. If he is, I'd like for him to come up tonight, if he would, and set up on the platform with us while we're praying for the sick, when we get ready to start the prayer line. Thank you, Brother Osborn. And I... Brother Osborn is a very dear friend of mine, a fine, young, Christian man that God has used in mighty works everywhere, across the country, a praying for the sick. He's one boy that I can say, not because he's here on the platform, but one boy that I can say... God bless you, Brother Osborn. I can say there's not one streak of fanaticism in him. He's truly a man of God. He doesn't make any claims of nothing, but just... He knows the Bible, and know what God says. And God has endued him with--with a knowledge of the Bible that ties Satan to where he just can't move, by 53-0905, Faith Without Works Is Dead, Chicago Gospel Tabernacle, Chicago, IL, 74 min the Scriptures.

L-6 He's one that doesn't even have a prayer line. He just stands there with the Scriptures and explains It in such a way, till the people just have to see it. That's all. And listen. That is the initial way of Divine healing. You know that? The Word of God will defeat Satan anywhere, any time, on any conditions. Is that right? When Jesus was here on earth, all the great gifts there was in heaven, He had them right with him. What the Father was, He was. For He was God, the Son, here on earth. God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself. You believe that? But when He met Satan, He never used any of those powers. He taken the Father's Word. Satan said, "Now if?" That question mark over the Word of God again. "If Thou be the Son of God, command these stones to be made bread."

L-7 He said, "It is written: man shall not live by bread alone." Right with the Word... Taking Him up, and then he tried to whitewash the Word, make it some other way. He said, "It is written the angels give Thee charge over Thee, lest any time dash foot against a stone, they bear Thee up." And He said, "And it's also written..." (See?) right back with the Word of God, tying Satan. And then he taken Him upon the mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world: United States and all. Said, "These are all mine; I'll give them to You if You will fall down and worship me." Jesus said, "It is written..." back to the Father's Word again, none of His power, just using the Word, showing that the weakest of Christian can defeat Satan on THUS SAITH THE LORD, taking God at His Word. Is that right?

L-8 So that--that's Brother Osborn, and he really does a good job of it. I'd recommend him to any pastor, any--any place. When I was in Africa, anywhere I go, I've always got a good word for Brother Osborn, because he's my brother and a fellow citizen of the Kingdom of God. I knew he was in here, because I'd, or would be here; he was in the city. I wanted him to set by me tonight while I'm going to pray for so many people. And why did I do this? I know the boy knows the challenge of Satan (See?), and he knows the challenge of God. So while the sick's coming across the platform, I want Brother Osborn setting there holding in prayer, so that both of us together, with Brother Boze, many others here who are Christian believers around close; then you feel the assurance that the Holy Spirit is there to do the work.

L-9 Usually it's in a line of discernment. I never try to cast out a spirit, unless first I realize what I'm doing, 'cause that's a dangerous thing. Did you know that? Very dangerous unless you understand what you're doing. If you'll notice on the platform after the anointing comes, you never hear me challenge a spirit 'less firstly I see where it's God's will to do it. Now, you say, "Is it God's will?" Well, sometime people come to the platform who many times are even not Christians, and they--they want to be healed of diseases, and maybe they have been Christians, and done something in their life, or neglected to do something, and that's the reason they can't get healed. So under that power of discernment, when the prophetic utterance goes forth, it tells you just exactly where your trouble is. That--that... Then get that out of the way first. Then God's got to heal you.

L-10 Here not long ago, if you'll excuse me. Would you give me a time for a little testimony, just a little bitty one, if you will? I feel that I wasn't going to say nothing, but this comes on my mind. Just a few months ago, I was having a meeting, and--and I coming back home. And there's a--a Methodist minister in New Albany, very fine man. It's a city just below us in Indiana, and he's a--has a very fine lively church. He has got what they call the "Hour of Power" program, and the... Oh, it's a marvelous program. And in this program, he gets different ministers in to preach, and he said, "Brother Branham, it would just make me feel so good if you'd come preach one night for me." Said, "I won't ask you to pray for any sick people." At home I try to relax and keep that off my mind, 'cause as soon as you go to talking to somebody, there it is again. You see? So I just kind of relax from it. He said, "If you just come down preach..."

L-11 I said, "All right, Brother Johnson, I'll do that." And we were both raised the same part of Kentucky, just across the 53-0905, Faith Without Works Is Dead, Chicago Gospel Tabernacle, Chicago, IL, 74 min hollow from each other. So he was a Methodist, and I was a Baptist, and we used to go on to each other all the time, you know, about different denominations of church. And so I went down that night to... And we had the service and the Lord had blessed, and it was a great crowd of people come from the outside, way down the streets where they was lined up, holding up their hands they accepted Christ as their Saviour.

L-12 Going down at the back way where we had to go through, 'cause the basement and all was full and... Well, we started out the back way. He said, "Brother Branham, I promised you I wouldn't ask you to pray for anybody," but said, "we got a Sunday school teacher here." Said, "She's a lovely little woman, and she's a neurotic." Said, "I--I would that you would pray for her, Brother Branham. Just lay your hands on her and just say, 'God bless you or something.'" Said, "She's wanted you to pray for her so long." Said, "She's been everywhere that... Everybody comes through the country with praying for the sick," said, "we've had her everywhere. She's been going to the psychiatrist in Louisville for the past ten years," and said, "and she's just in a terrible condition." I said, "All right."

L-13 Well, the way he'd explained her case, I expected to see somebody in a--in a straight jacket, but when I got down to the end of the steps, a lovely looking little lady of about twenty-eight, thirty years old, maybe a little older, standing there. She said, "How do you do, Brother Branham?" I said, "Howdy do." And she said... I said, "Are you the patient?" She said, "Yes, sir." I said, "Well, you don't look to be sick." She said, "Well, I--I really not sick," but said, "I don't know what's the matter with me, Brother Branham," said, "I just can't get myself together."

L-14 And I said, "Well, I'll pray." And I just prayed and laid hands on her, walked out. Two day later, the wife and I was going down New Albany, and we met her down there on the street. My wife who's present now here, she was... We went across the street, and we seen the little lady. We asked her. She said, "Oh, I just can't leave the city." She said, "I--I just can't go." She said, "There's something will get me if I leave." I seen it wasn't there. So I said, "Step up here; we'll pray again," and I asked prayer for her again. Went out, and I said, "God be merciful to the poor little thing." I said, "Lady, you a Christian?"

L-15 She said, "Yes, sir. I'm Methodist sanctification, you know." She said, "I'm really born again." I said, "Well, that's really good," and I prayed for her and went on, and a lovely little person. So I had went overseas, and then I come back, and on the road back, why, I was so tired, and it was... Meda said to me, my wife, she said, "If ever the Angel of the Lord appears again here at the house, while He's present, Bill," said, "that poor little woman she ain't hardly got mind enough," she said, "to--to come to a meeting," and said, "she's now... She's fixing to when they take her to the meeting, they... she wants them to tie her so they can take her to the meeting. She was so scared to leave the city. The devil told her if she left the city she'd die 'fore she got back. So--so she was scared to leave the city." And so I said, "Well, if He ever appears."

L-16 And one morning He came... I ain't got time to tell what takes place there but, oh, it was marvelous. He came into the room. That's the morning He told me; here's the vision wrote out right here about India and Africa, written right on my fly leaf of the Bible here, and any of you that wants a copy of it can sure have it. And you mark that down and see if it isn't word by word how it'll come to pass. See if there isn't three hundred and fifty thousand people comes to God in India when we get there. See if that isn't right. See if it don't appear in these magazines and things just the same way. Just like the little boy in Finland and so forth, it's God foretelling things what will come.

L-17 Now, that morning I--I said to Meda; I said, "The Angel of the Lord is at the house now. He's come to be with us 53-0905, Faith Without Works Is Dead, Chicago Gospel Tabernacle, Chicago, IL, 74 min for maybe a day or an hour. I don't know how long He will stay." And she said, "Can I call that little woman in New Albany?" I said, "Well, if they can get her up here." So at the same time... Now, the other night the man was setting right here that's from Louisville, Kentucky, the member of the big Wall Street Baptist Church in Louisville, was dying with cancer. He was setting right here the other night, right along in here, and was healed in the front room that morning.

L-18 The little woman come up, and they took her into the den room. And I said, "Now, Meda, let me have her by myself." And I went in there. I said, "How do you do, lady?" She said, "How do you do, Brother Branham?" Said, "Oh, I'm just having a bad spell this morning." I said, "Yes, ma'am." And I got to talking to her. I said, "Now, and you say you've been going to a psychiatrist all ten..." "Yes, sir." To kind of get her mind where she wouldn't be thinking of... A few minutes, I noticed running in front of me like that, I seen a little black car, one seated running. And I said, "Have you ever had an accident in a car?" She said, "No, sir." I said, "Well, if... You're... Why, I see a car," and when I started, then it just moved right into the vision, and here it was.

L-19 She was... When she was married, her husband went overseas, and she went out with a man which was blond-headed, and she had went out and lived untrue to her marriage vows, while her husband was overseas. She come back, and on the road coming back she was almost struck by a train, which would've took both of their lives. She just missed the train. And when I... The vision left, she was falling over in the floor like that, fainting, and she begin screaming. My wife come in. I picked her up. And she said... I said, "Lady, and you a Sunday school teacher." She said, "Brother Branham," said, "I--I've confessed that to God a long time ago." I said, "Look. No one knows that but you, and the man that was with you, and God Almighty." She said, "That's right."

L-20 I said, "No psychiatrist could ever pull that out of you. No," I said, "that had to come Divine." I said, "Now, you go to your husband and make that right." She said, "I can't, Brother Branham. I got three children." Said, "It'd break my home up." I said, "Well, it's going to break it anyhow." I said, "Because you're not going to live like that. You're going completely insane." I said, "You can't keep that." And I said, "That's way back in the gable end of your soul." She said, "Well, I've confessed that to God." I said, "It wasn't God you sinned against. It was your husband. If you'd have been a single woman, it'd been different, but you sinned against your marriage vow." And I said, "They might..." She said, "Well, Brother So-and-so told me." I said, "Sister, that don't have nothing to do with it. That unconfessed sin, and they could pour oil on your head till they got a gallon on there. They could stomp, and kick, and snort, and run across the platform, and scream, and holler. That'll... That devil will stay right there. He's got a right to, and as long as he's got a right to stay there, he will hold his grounds." And I said, "You'll never..." I said, "I've done all." She said, "I just can't do it."

L-21 I said, "Now, sister, you come here, and God in His mercy has revealed what your trouble is. Go, make that right with your husband, and you'll get well. If you don't, then I've done all I..." She said, "I just can't do it." She said, "It'll just break up my home." I said, "All right. I just was God's servant. I have done what God bid me to do." She started to cry. I looked back at her and standing along side of the door, I seen a tall man (vision), blue shadow standing there, and he had his hair combed sideways kind of wavy, black hair. I said, "Your husband is a black headed 53-0905, Faith Without Works Is Dead, Chicago Gospel Tabernacle, Chicago, IL, 74 min man, tall and thin." She said, "Yes, sir. He's a..." And I said, "And he works in a Chevrolet company." Said, "Yes, sir. He does." And I said, "He's got the same thing to confess to you, same thing." She said, "Not my husband, he's a deacon in the church."

L-22 I said, "I don't care what he is." I said, "He's got the same thing to confess to you. When he landed in--in England, he did the same trick." And told her where he did it at. I said, "And not over three days ago, a woman with a pink dress on with black hair, they was in a green Chevrolet car, and she works for the Chevrolet company that he's working for." I said, "I got four phones. Go call. Get him up. Go somewhere, and you all make that right with God for those children's sake." And I just walked on out to the man that had cancer in there to pray for him. She called him. In a few moments here they come back, both of them with their tears running down their cheek. She called him, and they--they met out on the road in a cars to theirself. Rest of the party drove away and left them in the same car. She said, she confessed her wrong first. And she... He said, "And that... you kept that in your heart all this time?"

L-23 Said, "Yes." And said, "The person that told me about it awhile ago," said, "told me that--that day before yesterday, you was with the woman (that she knew), and where you were at and all..." And he said, "Where you been?" So they told... She told... And he said, "Honey, that's exactly the truth." And the people may be setting in this meeting tonight. I know many witnesses of it is. So said, "It's exactly the truth. If you'll forgive me, I'll forgive you, and we'll ask God to forgive both of us. We'll get our children and live like men and women ought to, like a Sunday school teacher, and a deacon of the church ought to live."

L-24 And they confessed their sins. They come back up with their arms around one another, coming up. My wife said (You remember, honey) said, "Will--will they ever come back?" I said, "Sure. They'll be back. That's her only hope to ever be well." And they came back with their arms around one another and went in there. I said, "Now, now, it's different. Now, by God's grace, and by the authority of God's Word, Satan will have to leave you." That's right. And there he left, and she's the happiest little woman there is in New Albany, Indiana. She's testifying everywhere. Her and her husband both live a victorious life.

L-25 Now, you couldn't have poured enough oil on her, anointed her with oil. You couldn't have stomped, or hollered, or... devil don't care how loud you holler. He don't pay no attention to that. That's right, but he will recognize faith. Yes, sir. He will have to know where truth lays, and he will recognize truth, and he will recognize faith. And--and if you have got something... That's the reason I watch close. Now, on these lines like we're going to have tonight, we just pray for the people, and lay hands on them and so forth. That's the way that... That's going to be up to you. So you confess your sins before you come to the platform and say, "Lord," and anything's in your life, you straighten it up now before you come. For be it assured to you that that thing will hang right over you as long as you got unconfessed sin.

L-26 Or maybe something in your life that you should've done that you did not do. Maybe something you--you did do that you ought not have done, but any of those things, confess it. Make it right. Believe God, accept it, move on. Amen. All right. Don't forget now tomorrow afternoon and tomorrow night. Let's come praying. How many would be willing tomorrow to say, "I'm going to spend at least a half a hours prayer between now and tomorrow afternoon for that service for a complete victory. Would you do it with me? A half hour or prayer... A complete victory for tomorrow afternoon. That's a--a complete, every sinner saved, everyone filled with the Holy Ghost, every crippled person healed, every sick person healed. Wouldn't that be wonderful? Let's come believing.

L-27 Now, for a Scripture reading, then the prayer line: Saint James the 2nd chapter the 21st verse. Was not Abraham, our father, justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? 53-0905, Faith Without Works Is Dead, Chicago Gospel Tabernacle, Chicago, IL, 74 min Seest thou the faith through with... was wrought with works, and by works was faith made perfect? And the Scripture was fulfilled which was said, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. Ye see then how that by works is a man justified, and not by faith only. (Listen.) Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way? For as the body without the spirit is dead, so is faith without works also.

L-28 How many have faith? Raise your hands as a witness to God. Now, your faith without your works is dead. You might as well not have faith if you're not willing to put it to work. Now, as the Holy Spirit moves into the building tonight, let's us take the initiative side. Let's believe with all of our hearts. Let's see if we can't get pretty nearly everyone in this building to be prayed for tonight. And first, let's get the meeting running level and smooth. When the Holy Spirit begins to move into the meeting, and then just challenge and move right up into the supernatural and believe God with all of our heart.

L-29 And one of the sweetest things today, and again I want to say, last evening and this tonight and last night both when wife and I were eating in a little restaurant, someone paid our bill, or our--our food bill. We appreciate that. We don't know who you were. Brother Boze today give me a--a two little love tokens from someone in--in an offering. God bless you. I appreciate that. I don't want to forget it. And then this afternoon, a lovely thing happened. A little blind girl was setting here in the building last night, and while the service was going on, the light broke into her eyes, and today she gave me in the restaurant a--a little picture of Christ, kinda inlaid picture as a memorial.

L-30 God, O Father, grant it once again, please. Let it repeat tonight. My sincere prayer from the depths of my soul, may God bless when we just whisper a word of prayer to Him again. Lord Jesus, Thou art the Son of God, and there's men and women in here who are dying tonight, cannot ever be well without You. They're laying like the lepers was at the gate. The leper said, "Why do we lay here until we die? If we go into the city, we're sure to die. They're starving in there. We're going to starve if we sit here, but if we go to the Israel, the camp of the--of the Syrians, if they kill us, what of it? We're going to die anyhow, but if they save us, we live." The only chance they had, and they moved out by faith to take it. God, what a reward You gave them. They not only saved their own lives, they saved the life of all Samaria.

L-31 O Jesus, tonight, we pray that You'll let people know that they don't have to take a chance. They don't have to go down to an enemy's camp. They can come to the--the knees of the loving Father, at the Throne of God where they're expected to come tonight and offer a thanksgiving for their healing and for their salvation, and be saved and healed tonight. Grant it, Lord. And now, send tonight, Lord, Thy Spirit upon every person. I pray, God, that You'll pull the shades down, as it was, over every eye that would see anything except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. May they see that all supreme sacrifice. By eyes of faith we look there and see that there's where the debt was paid. O God, make us ashamed of ourself who confess to have faith and afraid to put works to it. God, give us works.

L-32 May men and women tonight rise from every place and be healed of all diseases everywhere. May demons flee. May Your Spirit come in, and take over, and drive away all doubts, and give perfect victory tonight in every heart. Lord, when we go in here tonight, may we say as them of old, "Did not our hearts burn within us because of His Presence." For we ask it in His Name and for His glory. Amen. All right. Now, we got a lot of old prayer cards out here. First, we keep them lined up with the prayer cards, just as far as we can. And then we'll line up a prayer line, and then we'll just keep on. Then we get that group prayed for, we'll line up another prayer line, keep bringing cards and so forth. If I get tired, I got some helpers around here that we can keep on, and be praying for the sick, until a committal, or whatever God brings to the place. We'll just commit it to God.

L-33 Now, I believe we started out with prayer cards D. Has anybody got prayer card D in here? Raise up your hand. 53-0905, Faith Without Works Is Dead, Chicago Gospel Tabernacle, Chicago, IL, 74 min Anybody with prayer card D? Yes, that's fine. All right, let's... Who's got prayer card D-1? D-number-1. Is it in the building? Am I starting too far up? D-number-1? It's not here. Maybe I'm too far back. Oh, yes they have. D-1. D-2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Let's see how many we get stand up. We want to line--line them up along side the wall, or somewhere to--in this a way, till we can get a whole row down through here, and then we'll start on another bunch of our prayer cards.

L-34 D-1 to 10. I think that's where we began. All right. D-1 to 10, quickly now, rise right up. Look on the back of your card. Everyone look around. Ushers come to your spot, if you will, right away. All right. D-10 to 20, line up. D, prayer card D-10 to 20, line up. You got his card? Has that man got a card? Yeah...?... All right, 20 to 30, D-20 to 30. That's right. 30 to 40, come right on, D-30 to 40; 40 to 50, D-40 to 50. That's... Keep watching your neighbor's card now. They'll find out. We'll get everybody that we can get right in the line, then we'll... D-40 to 50, 50 to 60. Someone help the lady there, if you will...?... If you're real bad crippled and your numbers are called, well, just hold your place and we'll--we'll get somebody to help you.

L-35 What was that 50 to 60, I... 60, 60? 60 to 70, D-60 to 70. Come down in this way if you will as you're come out. The line's forming this a way and so it's... 60 to 70. The ushers will place you just in your position. We never know... The reason we do that, we never know where, what's going to happen. You see? The Holy Spirit might do something (You see?), and He might stop the line at a second. He might... We've had much experience in eight years. 70 to 80, D-70 to 80. That's good. Come this way, everybody. Line up this way with your--your cards in this way. 70 to 80, 80 to 90, 80 to 90. Uh-huh.

L-36 [Brother Branham speaks to someone--Ed.] Brother Osborn's going to speak a word at this time. [Brother Osborn explains the way to be healed--Ed.] Thank you, Brother Osborn. That's real. That's Scripture. That's solid. There's no one can say that isn't the truth. That's the truth. See? You're afraid to put your faith to work. See? If you say I got faith, and you haven't got no works, you might as well not have no faith. See? You've got to believe. You've got... Now, everyone along that prayer line, a hundred people and probably... How many out there in the audience wants to be prayed for? Let's see your hands, everywhere. Oh, there's probably another thousand out there that wants to be prayed for. Every one of you can be healed, every one of you. See? Just have faith in God.

L-37 Now, Brother Osborn, he can explain the Word and lay it out so you can't keep from believing it. That's his gift. Mine is prophetic utterance, and that all, just like eyes and ears and so forth, it's all the Body working together. And when you see God's Body moving together like that, why, it ought to make you so happy, till you just... And know this last days and that God has been doing these wonderful things for us. You ought to be so happy, you just go out of this building shouting anyhow. Don't you think so? Certainly. All right. Bring the lady. Now, just a moment while they start the line a coming... Now, I want to be sure the Angel of the Lord is here. See? I may not just--just simply pray for people as they pass through, but go through discernment for that line for each one it would probably take, maybe four, five days of meeting for that hundred. If God can reveal one thing, He can reveal all things, can't He? Just enough to let You know that Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever, is here and His blessings are with us. Don't you believe that?

L-38 Now, do you believe, lady, as you come? Now, just... Let that music continue on if you will, wherever it is. That's all right. That's fine. Now, everybody in one accord now, got your mind centered on Jesus Christ? What if He was here on earth tonight wearing this coat that He gave me? Then He'd come here. Here stands a woman; why, I've never seen the woman in my life. Now, Jesus, what He would do, He--He couldn't heal her. How many knows that to be the truth? Jesus could not heal her. He cannot do what He's already done. See? He couldn't. See? He couldn't say, "Now, wait a minute. I'll come down and die to save you because you're a sinner at the altar. No. He's already died for your salvation, and He's setting at the right hand of the Father to make intercessions upon your profession (not upon your feeling), upon what you profess to be. See?

L-39 When you said, "Well, I was saved ten years ago." No, you were saved nineteen hundred years ago. You accepted 53-0905, Faith Without Works Is Dead, Chicago Gospel Tabernacle, Chicago, IL, 74 min it ten years ago. See, see? You were healed nineteen hundred years ago. Are you willing to accept it tonight? That's the only... See He couldn't heal her. Now, the only thing He would, just like He was here on earth. He said, "I do nothing except the Father shows Me." Being that there's a little new part, new audience, tonight, maybe your first time. How many was here and never was in one of my meetings before? Raise your hand. Oh, my, there's hundred or two, maybe a few on in the line for discernment that you might... See? Wherever the Lord will lead...

L-40 Now, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, when He was here on earth, what did He do? He didn't claim to be a healer, did He? He claimed that He only did what the Father showed Him to do by vision. How many knows that's the Scripture? Saint John 5:19 said, "Verily, verily I say unto you, the Son can do nothing." He had passed by a big bunch of crippled people, never healed any of them at the pool of Bethesda. And He healed a man laying on a pallet, for the Father had showed Him. He said the man was laying there, and so He didn't know what to do. The people said, "Well, why didn't You..." In other words, "Why didn't heal them all?" The critics, they lived in them days too. One day they wrapped a rag around His eyes and hit Him on the head and said, with a reed, and said, "If You are a prophet, tell us who hit You?" Do you remember that? The crucifixion. "If You are a prophet, tell us who hit You?" He never opened His mouth.

L-41 He wasn't... It wasn't a stage show. It wasn't a clowning. It was absolutely sincerity before the Father, that He did just as the Father told Him. Maybe He didn't know who hit them. The Father knew. He perceived their thoughts. At the woman at the well, He talked to her a few minutes, told her right where her trouble was; said, "Go, get your husband." Is that right? Philip, when he came to Him with Nathanael, Nathanael criticized Him. "Nothing good can come out of Nazareth." He said, "You come, see." So when He seen him coming, He said, "There's an Israelite in whom there is no guile." Why, it astonished him. He said, "When did You know me, Rabbi (or Reverend, Teacher)?" He said, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the tree, I saw you."

L-42 Now, if that Jesus Christ is raised from the dead and living in His Church tonight, He can produce the same things; for He said, "The things that I do shall you also." Is that right? "Lo, I am with you always even to the end of the world." Church has forgot those things. Theology of the church has went over the top of the thing, but Jesus Christ still remains the same yesterday, today, and forever, still moving. Jehovah God inveiled one time in a Pillar of Fire, the next time in a Son, the body Jesus, and this time unfolding Himself from a Pillar of Fire into a body virgin born, now into sinful men that's been born again. God in the Fire, God in His Son, God in His people: Same God, right along the same. Have faith in God. All right.

L-43 Now, everyone just reverent as you can be now. Come here, lady. Do you believe with all your heart? You believe that Jesus Christ the Son of God is here tonight? I want you to look at me. As the... Now in that, I mean as you look here... As Peter and John passed through the gate called Beautiful and said, "Silver and gold have I none," you know. They said, "Look on us." Said, and they... He looked expecting to receive something. What they were trying to do, was to see what kind of a faith he had. They were also prophets. When Elijah came down in the... They went out to battle the Assyrians, and Elijah, he seen Ahab's son there, he said, "Why don't you go to your own god. Why don't you go to your mother's god." Said, "Why'd you come to me?"

L-44 He kinda got all stewed up about it. He said, "Why, if it wasn't I respected the presence of Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't even look at you." See? Now, that prophet said that. "I wouldn't even look at you," but said, "nevertheless play some music." And when he went to playing the music, the hand of the Lord come upon the prophet; he saw what was going to take place. Now, He's still the same God tonight. You believe that? You believe that? I suppose we're strangers, aren't we? Never met in life before, you're just a woman that's here in the audience, got a prayer card and come up on the platform. But now, if Jesus has risen from the dead, He was able to tell me what you're up here for. He can tell me what you have been, what you are now, what you will be. Is that right? Certainly. No secret is with Him. 53-0905, Faith Without Works Is Dead, Chicago Gospel Tabernacle, Chicago, IL, 74 min

Almighty God, Who sent His Angel to the room that night... You say, "That's fanaticism." Well, brother, the whole world knows about it and knows it's the truth. The scientific world knows it's the truth. I come speaking in His Name, Jesus Christ, and He's confirming the words that's been said that it is the truth. Hallelujah. That's right. Certainly. Just passing the people, I'm trying to get them to accept Christ upon the negative--upon the positive Word of Jesus Christ to believe it without saying anything. How do you do, lady?
