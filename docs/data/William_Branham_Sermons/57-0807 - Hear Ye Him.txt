--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Thank you, Brother Thompson. Let us pray. Blessed Father, we are indeed happy to come before Thee tonight and to ask these favors, that You would pour out of Your Spirit upon us all tonight and just shed abroad Thy love in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. And we pray that You'll heal the sick and the needy, and get glory to Thyself. For we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. May be seated again. Let's be expecting tonight that the Lord is going to give us the night that we have looked forward to every since we been in the city. Just an exceeding abundantly tonight is my prayer.

L-2 I wish to read tonight from St. Matthew's Gospel, and the 17th chapter, to those who usually take down the--the Word. I love to read the Word, because I know if no more than just the Word being read, there'll be a blessing by that. My words will fail because it's the word of a man. God's Word will never fail because It's the Word of God. And we know that that much... If we read the Scriptures each time when we come to the service, there will be a blessing, because that it's God's eternal and blessed Word. And after six days Jesus taken Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart, And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was as white as the light. And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make unto thee... three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. While he yet spake these, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

L-3 And I wish to take tonight for a text, them last three words: "Hear Ye Him." We find as we read this marvelous Word of God, we find that where our Lord Jesus was always about the Father's business. Every step that He made had a meaning. There was not one act that He did but what was ordained of God. And it does us so good to think that the Bible said, "The footsteps of a righteous is ordered of the Lord." And if we'll just do what's in our heart... David was once setting before Nathan the prophet, and he said, "Is it right that I'd live in a house of cedar and the ark of my God under a tent?" And Nathanael said to him, "Do all that's in thine heart for God is with thee." And we find in our most unusual Scripture reading tonight, a very outstanding instant.

L-4 Many times, no doubt, the clergyman in the building, the pastors and evangelists, has preached of this many times; but every time that you preach anywhere in God's Word, it's something new. There has been thousands of pastors and evangelists since the day this was written, has preached the same subject, and every time they preach it there's something new. Now, every time you read a place in God's Word, it opens up something new to you. It goes to show that it's inspired. If I wrote you a letter, you would, perhaps, appreciate it, might keep it for a while. But that letter only will soon run out. It only has an evaluation of our friendship. And now, after you're gone, then that letter would hold, perhaps, nothing at all. But not so with God's Word. Every generation It's just as new and life giving as It was the day It was written.

L-5 And the real correct approach to this text tonight, is the order of the second coming of Christ. How that, first he saw Jesus, then Moses and Elijah, and then Jesus only. Truly that is in perfect harmony with the second coming of Christ. And He had said just previous to this, that, "Many stand here shall not see death until they see the Son of man in His glory." And that was a prefigure of His coming in glory. But we want to take a new route on this tonight, another way around, because every Word of God dovetails together. There is no contradiction in God's Word. I'd like to see the Scripture that contradicts itself that cannot be straightened by the same Scripture. It is written, surely in parables, because it's a purposely did that way to confuse the wise and prudent, that God might reveal it to babes such as would learn. 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min

L-6 Now, we find this, that God meets in the council of men; sometimes great, large councils of men. We see once where He appeared before five hundred brethren. Again He appeared in the presence of seventy, then in twenty-four, or twelve, three, and even to one. Christ will appear before any honest heart. No matter how insignificant you may seem to be, you're a--you're soul is worth ten thousand worlds. Sometime ago down in Tennessee, I was standing at a great museum, and I was looking in the glass with some young fellows was standing next to me, and it was showing the chemical worth of a hundred and fifty pound man. And it might surprise you to know how much you're really worth. If you're in good health, a good, strong man at a hundred and fifty pounds worth eighty-four cents. Well, you're not worth very much are you? Just about enough whitewash to sprinkle a hen's nest, a little, bitty calcium and so forth, all weighed up to eighty-four cents worth of chemicals in your body...

L-7 One young fellow said to the other; he said, "John, we're not worth very much are we?" I thought this was a grand opportunity. I laid my hands on each one of the boy's shoulders as I stepped between them, and I said, "That's true son, we're not worth very much in this body, but in that body's got a soul in it that's worth ten thousand worlds." But we want to take care of this eighty-four cents. We give it the best of clothes, feed it the best of foods, and put a ten dollar hat on it, and, oh, how we love to take care of this eighty-four cents. But that soul, we just let it grap over any old world and anything else, not noticing or paying any attention to it, drag it down to church and sleep while the preacher preaches twenty minutes, and have a deacon's meeting that he preached too long. That soul is worth ten thousand worlds.

L-8 But we find in this Scripture, that Jesus had chose three of His apostles. I just love to think on the numatics of the Bible, how the threes, sevens, twelves, forties, fifties. And if you get those numbers running right you can just place the Bible like one great picture. And three is a perfection like Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; and water, blood, and spirit, and so forth. And the three comings of Jesus, once He come to redeem His Bride, next time He comes to get His Bride, the next time He comes with His Bride after the Marriage Supper. Then we find that He taken three chosen vessels: Peter, James, and John. And in the Bible we're taught: love, hope, and charity; or faith, hope, and charity it is: faith, hope, and charity.

L-9 I want you to notice how beautiful that those three man typed that, the spirits that was in those men. Peter--faith, right out ready to tackle anything, James--hope, John--charity. Faith, hope, and charity. And it is written in the Word that three is a witness or a confirmation. The Bible said, "In the mouth of three witnesses let every word be established." Three is--was a witness in the Old Testament. If there was an accusation against someone, it had to be witnessed by three. And it's also carried over into the New Testament, that three is a witness. And we find that God was fixing to do something. And God, when He does anything, He always brings witness. We find at Pentecost, He said, "Wait at the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high, then you shall be witnesses of Me," preparing His witnesses, God sent witnesses.

L-10 And He was taking these three great spirits with Him to witness what God was fixing to do. Now, God never does anything without first confirming it, making it known. He does nothing in darkness. God's in and above board. All that He does, what you hear in the secret chamber, preach on a housetop. God don't want anything covered up. And now, this might help you. And when men and women who profess to be Christians and never testify to the unsaved, or let their light shine, there's something wrong with that individual. God wants you to let the light shine; give Him praise anywhere, as Paul said of old, "I'm not ashamed of the Gospel, for it's the power of God unto salvation."

L-11 And we find these three witnesses going up to give testimony of what God was fixing to do. Now, in the Old Testament... All the Old Testament was practically types and shadows of the New. God never asked a man to do anything that He wouldn't do Himself. When God put penalty of death on the human race there was only one just thing for God to do. If He'd have sent an Angel, God would have been unjust. If He'd have sent another creature out of heaven, He would've been unjust. But the 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min only way that God could do it was take the sinner's place Himself. Therefore, He had to become flesh. And He'd lived in His only begotten Son, tabernacled here on earth in a Body, Christ Jesus, and made a little lower than the Angels to suffer death.

L-12 We had it in the message last night, that He had to catch the stinger in death in His own flesh and pull the sting out of death. Oh, brother, sister, what a marvelous revelation, what a marvelous truth it is to know that God has took the sting out of death. And I've stood in the face of dying saints, watch them raise their hands, and tears rolling down their cheek, and shout the victory right in the face of death; it's a beautiful sight. And we find now in the Old Testament... There's many words in our new King James Version that seems very strange. But for me, the rest of you brethren can teach from any version you want to, but I like the King James. Just seems more like the Bible to me. And in there there's some translations that might seem just a little bit strange to us. For instance, in John 14 it said, "In My Father's house is many mansions." My Father's little house has got many great big mansions in it. Now, that seems strange, but the translators that was translating the Bible for King James, used the language that they used in that day. And in England they had the same setup that they had in the Old Testament. Now, in England they had what they called the father's house, was his domain, the king's domain.

L-13 Now, the Moffatt (I believe) translation is more ridiculous than the King James. It says, "In My Father's apartment house is many apartments," like you were going up there to rent an apartment. But if both of them is... Here's the original translation, "In My Father's kingdom is many palaces." That's the way it is in the original Hebrew. Now, but in King James' time they had it translated so the people would understand it. Now, in the Old Testament they had the same kind of a setup. A father owned a great lot of ground, and it was called his house or his domain. And when all over the different parts of his country, he had little homes, little tenant houses we'd call them in the States. And his tenants lived in those houses. And now, when a baby was borned in this home to this wealthy father, well, the father being a business man and had to be about the business, he sought all over the country until he could find the very best tutor that he could to raise this son.

L-14 Now, if you will pardon the expression... And now, what you believe of this, you take. And what you don't believe, you just lay aside as I do when I'm eating cherry pie. If I run into a seed, I don't throw the pie away, I just throw the seed away and keep on eating pie. You do likewise. Now, what God was fixing to show here on Mount Transfiguration, it was--He was fixing to do just like He had them do in the Old Testament: placing of a son. Now, when a son was born into the family, he was a son at birth. And there's where you Pentecostal people jumped the fence. You thought that when you were born again that settled it. That only was the beginning. That's right. You are a son, surely, when you're born. But when this son was born, he wasn't heir of all things yet. He had to go through the testings and trials to find out if he was the right type of son to fall heir to all things. And listen, God's Word said, that every son that cometh to God must first be tried and chastened, child-trained, before he could be adopted into the family.

L-15 Now, this father taken the son and turned him over to a raiser, a tutor, school teacher, otherwise. And this school teacher had to bring word to the father just how that child was progressing, if he was slothful, or if he was dilatory, or if he was a bright, intelligent, wide awake, young man. Now, the father had to find the man the right kind of a tutor. And that's a beautiful type of the church, that when we become sons of God, borned into the Kingdom of God, the Father sent to us the best Tutor that He could find--The Holy Spirit. Now, He never sent us an archbishop to be our tutor, or general overseer, or a district man. There's where we've made our mistake. The church is governed by the Holy Spirit. That's God's government for His church. But we've adopted other tutors, other raisers.

L-16 And then this tutor must be just, not pull any punches. He must bring the direct truth to the father. And how that tutor must blush when he comes up to the father in his face, and said, "Your son is not doing too good. He's failing in his studies; he's dilatory." How the tutor must feel to come before the father with such a message as that to--about his 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min son. And I often wonder how the Holy Spirit must feel in the Presence of God, bringing the conduct of our modern day church, with so much world in it, people so dilatory, those that He's been graceful to and given the new birth. Oh, it must be terrible. And to think, that in these last days, how corrupt our church is getting to be. On Wednesday night instead of going to the prayer meeting, they stay home to watch television.

L-17 Remember, those conducts of yours goes right straight in the Presence of God by Somebody Who won't pull punches. No matter how good a neighbor you are, what a fine pillar you are in the church, the Holy Spirit brings the truth to God. How He must feel when He goes and says, "The women, the daughters of the church, strip themselves down and wear little old short clothes, and get out and lawn mow the yard before men." That might burn you up, but it ought to. It's right. What's been the matter today is too many sissies behind the pulpit, and a lot of Hollywood evangelism. We need the old fashion Gospel, the old fashion Saint Paul's revival, and the Bible Holy Ghost back into the church again.

L-18 It used to be wrong for Holiness people, and Methodists, and the people that tried to live right, the women to wear manicure, or ever what you call that stuff you put on your face. I know that's the wrong word, but I can't never think of it. Anyhow, it used to be wrong, but now you can't tell one from the other. It used to be wrong for the Christian women to bob their hair. Something went wrong somewhere. The Bible says it's wrong. Now, either you've got out of the harness, or your pastor got out of the will of God and quit preaching it. But that's the truth, and the Holy Spirit bears record before God. That's right. It used to be wrong for the people to go out to picture shows and entertainments of the world. But today you can't tell one from the other. People will miss prayer meeting to attend some kind of a lodge meeting. And how in the world can a Christian, who calls themself a child of God, ever go into these places to eat, and so forth, these little old nickelodeons, and play them rotten songs of Elvis Presley's, and all of those things that talk about being shook up. I tell you; you're going to be shook up one of these days, and that's true.

L-19 But how, not only the young folks, but grandma and grandpa does it. That's right. Babysitters, while mama and papa is out gadding around over the country... And on Sunday morning they go to church with a long, sanctimonious face. What you need's a good, old fashion Holy Spirit shaking, is what this country needs. You know that's truth. And oh, years ago it used to be wrong for women to smoke cigarettes. But it's popular now. And no matter how much the medical science says there's a carloads of cancer in every package of cigarettes... I heard on the radio the other day that there'll be more people die in the United States in the next year than were killed on both sides of the war, because they smoke cigarettes, throat cancer caused by smoking cigarettes. And yet, it's estimated that about ninety-five percent of the Christian church smoke cigarettes. What a disgrace.

L-20 You talk about a fifth columnist; that's the fifth columnist. I'm not worried about Russia coming over here and doing any harm to us. They're not going to hurt us; we're hurting ourselves. Our own moral decay is what's taking us down. It isn't the robin that pecks the apple that hurts it; it's the worm at the core that hurts it. It's our own rottenness. Say, "Brother Branham, you're picking on the women." All right, you men, here you are. Any man that'll let his wife put on them dirty clothes, like that little old shorts, and get out before the public, it shows what you're made out of. I don't call him much of a man. That's right. You're supposed to be the head of the house, but she's the neck; she tells you where to turn. It's a woman's world. That's right. And you're giving in to it.

L-21 And you come out and find Christian women laying out on the beach to get a tan. Well, I got two girls here tonight. I don't know what the future holds, but if I ever catch one of them, when she's a young woman, laying out on a beach to get a tan, she'll get a tanning all right. It won't be from the sun, it'll be Charles Branham's son with a barrel slat in his hand bringing her home, making her jump every time. What we need today is some more old fashion mamas and papas. Instead of having all of this old "True Story" magazines laying on the shelf, as to have God's Word laying there and reading It and believing It, and teaching their children to be brought up in the admonition of the Lord.

L-22 What do you think the Holy Spirit feels when He comes before the Father? "Your daughters are wearing shorts. 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min Your sons are permitting it." What a beautiful picture you are. But that is what it is. I'm not scolding you. I'm just trying to bring you the truth, just a little long so it won't scorch you too hard. It's better to be scorched a little here than burned hereafter. And notice, the Holy Spirit has to bring that to the Father. How the Father must say, "I--I can't get those people to do anything," the Holy Spirit says to the Father. "We just... I--I warn them, all the things that You've sent to them. They go to church, and Your Spirit will just perform all kinds of things. They'll just set and look around like a little jug, fill up pretty quick, get up and go home." What do you think God thinks about you when you do that? I hope there's a whole lot of them here. When you can't listen to the Gospel thirty minutes...

L-23 Here not long ago I knowed of a church. Some fellow was a great member of this church, or want to become a member. And he had lots of money. And he said, "I don't want to make a public confession." And that pastor took him secretly and baptized him and took him into the church. Why, he ought to have kicked him off the platform. That's exactly right. He's not worthy. Here sometime ago I was going down to the river, and a woman said... We was going to baptize a group of people. And she said, "Brother Branham, are you going down there to duck me?" I said, "Woman, your heart's not right with God. I certainly would never baptize you; you go home and repent and get right with God." Certainly.

L-24 Now, when the Father finds a child that's obedient. How he likes to come and say, "Sir, your boy is a perfect child, how obedient your children are, how they love to worship You. They gather together, and they raise their hands, and the tears runs down their cheeks. They're just so full of joy." How the Holy Spirit might--must love to do that, for God is an object of worship, and God wants to be worshipped in Spirit and in truth. Jesus said so. But we get so starchy we just can't make a grunt. We couldn't say, "Amen." We--we just set there. See? How the Holy Spirit must dread to say that to the Father. But when we are obedient, and love Him, and praise Him, and give Him glory, how the Holy Spirit must love to bring this to Him. You know He'd say? "Father, you know, Your son's just like You. Oh, it's just perfect." And if we'd say it here in our street expression "just a chip off of the block." "Why, He loves You; he's obedient."

L-25 Now, if that boy is no good, yet he's a son; he's never nothing but a son because he's borned a son. But if he is not obedient and the right kind of a son, he just continues a son on out without any reward. But if that is an obedient son according to the Scriptures, then there is an adoption of that son, or the placing of that son. And then after he gets a certain age, he's taken out into a public place. And there there's the great ceremony made, out before the public. And this son is set up on a high place and there is a ceremony of adoption. Think of it now. The father adopts his own son into his family. And then after that, that son's name's just as good on a check as his dad's. It's a public ceremony, and they're all out there, and they see this father positionally place that son.

L-26 And that's what's the matter with the church today, the reason that we don't have great mighty manifestations. This great church of the living God in these last days should be far down the road with every Divine gift set in order, a great, beautiful church. But we have broke up into denominations, and isms, and little fusses, and everything, till God can do no more with us, until we come together and get our hearts right with God. That's why our blessings are about run out. That's why in the churches it's getting cold and cooling off, is because we've been indifferent towards God, His Spirit, and His Word. It's true. We never welcome the Holy Spirit no more.

L-27 What if the king would come, the queen would come over here and visit Edmonton? All the flags would go up, and they'd lay out the welcome carpet. The little girls and maidens would stand on the street to welcome their lovely queen when she got off the train. Down through the streets they would--she would go. She'd have the best the city's got. The ladies would stand and throw rosebuds and different welcomings to her. That's what you should do. But she's just the queen, just a woman. And then Jesus can come to a city, and they'll say, "Holy-roller, fanatic; take them out; we don't want this; it's against our denomination." Oh, God, have mercy on His stupid children. When Jesus Christ will manifest Hisself in the midst of the people to show His resurrected power, and those who are supposed to be His children will shake their heads and say, "That's nonsense; it just so happened that way. It, oh, I don't know; that's telepathy." How the Holy Spirit must feel in the Presence of God with such as a message as that to take to 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min Him.

L-28 No wonder we don't get nowhere; everybody's wanting to pack the ball. When a correct football game is going on, they'll pass the ball to their best man. But today every man, "Bless God, I can take care of myself." And that's the reason we are torn; we never have a touchdown. Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecost, and all together, we are in this great fight of life. We ought to stand behind our pastor, stand behind our brethren with all that we got within us. And instead of that you say, "Oh, he's Assembly; he's a Methodist; we won't have no fellowship with him. We never cooperate in that meeting. No, sir, we won't have nothing to do into it." Oh, you poor, deluded, decrepit people, shame on you. What do you think the Holy Spirit says in the Presence of God? There is not no division in the church of the living God.

L-29 I'm forty-eight years old. I never was invited to join the Branham family. Why? I was borned in the Branham family. I become a Branham by birth. That's the way we become a child of God. Is not by Methodist, Presbyterian, nor Anglican, or Pentecostal, Nazarene, Pilgrim Holiness. We are born by the Spirit of God into the church of the living God. Certainly is. And then our character is watched by the Holy Spirit. And if we're Methodist today, and they make us a little mad, and we go over to the Baptists the next day, and they fuss at us a little bit, and something, the preacher says something steps on your toe, then away you go down to Pilgrim Holiness, or Nazarenes, or somewhere like that. No wonder. You pack your paper from place to place till it's about tore up. Why don't you take your name off of it anyhow and put it on the Lamb's Book of Life? Let God take care of it and fellowship with all the brethren of like precious faith. Whether you see eye to eye alike that doesn't matter. We're at least Christians, brethren, borned in the same family. God received us in our peculiarities; we should receive each other.

L-30 Then if then this son is found to be a--a good son, a trust-worthy son, one that the father can put confidence in, then all that the father has, he falls heir to it all. And God was showing in this great illustration, as He took Peter, James, and John up to the top of the mountain, in a high place, brought them apart from the rest of the world, He was going to show what He was going to do. And there before witnesses, three of the earth, three of heaven... There was Peter, James, John of the earth. There was Moses, Elijah, and Jesus of heaven. God was going to make this so official, that the heavens knew it and the earth knew it. And then He took Jesus out to one side, and He overshadowed Him with the glory of His Presence. And they looked up and they said, "His garments shined like the light."

L-31 Did you notice in the Old Testament, the son would put on a special robe for this adopting ceremony? And God put on Jesus a special robe. He'd glorified Him right there in the presence of the witnesses of heaven and the witnesses of earth: glorified Him. And you know Peter as usual, like men get excited when the supernatural's done... And let me drop a thought right here, if you'll excuse me for a moment. When the supernatural is done, what did I say the last time I was here? There's always a mixed multitude goes with it. When Moses was down in Egypt, the supernatural was done; a mixed multitude got into it. There was believers, unbelievers, and make believers. And they was the one who polluted the camp. Out of that come Korah. Korah was swallowed up with the earth. And when the supernatural is done, always a mixed multitude goes with it. Men get excited. We don't come to God under excitement; we come to God sanely, believingly, honorable, saying, "I am guilty, oh, God, and Thou art righteous. Forgive me of my sins, and I'll serve Thee as long as I live." That's the way you come to Him, meaning it from your heart.

L-32 Now notice. As soon as the supernatural begin to take place, Peter, like any other man got all excited. He said, "Lord, I'll tell You what we're going to do. Let us make here three tabernacles. We'll make one for all those who believe in the law, for under Moses, and they can all worship the law. We'll have another one who believe the prophets, and one who believe You." See, he wanted to divide and make denominations right quick. That's just in men to do that. But he had no more than got it from his lips, until a voice screamed from heaven and said, "This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him." I'm so glad that He said that.

L-33 How would you try to keep the law? No man is justified by the law; no flesh can be saved by the law. The law had no salvation. The law was a prison house. The law come and told you you was a sinner and put you in jail, but it had no 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min power to bring you out. So I wouldn't want to be a prisoner. And that's what the law does, shuts you up, condemns you. And said, "Thou shall not, and if you do it you're in prison," there's no way of getting out. So I wouldn't want the law, but Peter wanted to build a denomination and call it the law worshippers. "Let's build a tabernacle for Moses."

L-34 And then let's look on the other side. And he said, "Let's build one for Elijah." What did Elijah represent? The justice of God. And we do not want justice. I don't want justice. I want mercy, not justice. Elijah was that stern line of God's justice. God gave him a commission. He goes up on the mountain, and the king sent for him; he would not come. He had a commission from God to set there. And the king said, "That old fanatic, we'll just go bring him down." And he sent fifty soldiers and a captain. And when he come into the presence of Elijah, Elijah raised up and said, "If I be a man of God, let fire fall from heaven and consume you." And the fire come down, justice, and wiped the fifty out. Well, the king said, "You know, 'course the days of miracles is past; that was just a lightning happened to strike that group of men. So I'll just send up another group." And he sends up another group, and when they come in the presence of this old prophet, he raised up under the power of justice, and he said, "If I be a man of God let fire fall from heaven and consume you." And another fifty went out. God knows we don't want justice; we want mercy, always mercy.

L-35 Now, let's turn our head the other way. Peter was trying to tell us about this, but there was a voice from heaven come. Let your denominations go. What did He say? "This is my beloved Son; hear ye Him." What did He represent? God's love. That's what I want, not justice, not judgment, not law; I want God's love and mercy on me. "This is My beloved Son; hear ye Him." I'm so glad of that. For what Moses could not do, what Elijah could not do, Jesus could produce. God wanted to bless His children and He couldn't do it under the law, neither could He under judgment and justice. But the only way He could do it was under the love of His Son, Christ Jesus. "This is My beloved Son in Whom I'm well pleased; hear ye Him." What is it? All the law is finished; all the judgments is finished. "This is My beloved Son; hear Him." All those other things are done; this is Him.

L-36 Today, we want to hear everything else but Him. You want to hear rock-and-roll; you want to hear all these other things; but you don't want to hear Him. That's what God said, "Hear ye Him." And I say to this group of people in this arena tonight, "Hear ye Him." And He said, "Except a man be borned again he will in no wise enter into the Kingdom." Hear ye Him. He's the Great Physician. "He was wounded for our transgressions; with his stripes we were healed." Hear ye Him. If the doctor says you got a cancer and you're going to die, the man's honest; that's all he knows about it. All of his medical sciences prove that it cannot be cured; they haven't got nothing to cure it with. But "Hear ye Him." He said, "I'm the Lord Who heals all your diseases."

L-37 If you're guilty and you've sinned and you've trespassed against God's commandments, and you don't know what to do about it, the Bible said, "Hear ye Him." For He took all of our iniquity; He took all of our trespasses away. "Hear ye Him." What we need tonight is not so much law, and not so much of the--these denominations, and so many barriers. What we need is the love of God. What we need tonight is men and women who will take a bold stand from the depths of their heart and serve the Lord Jesus. The world's looking today not for a new denomination. If I'd have started ten years ago when I was in here, I'd have probably been the father over a great denomination. Sure it would've been. When men came to my house and said, "Brother Branham, oh, you got it in your hand; do this." No. There was Somebody spoke to me above, and I heard Him. I don't want to start denominations; we got enough. What I want to do is to be a servant of Him, love Him and obey Him, and serve Him well.

L-38 The Bible said you're the salt of the earth. Today you can call yourself a Presbyterian; that don't mean a thing in the Presence of God. You can call yourself a Pentecostal; that doesn't mean a thing in the Presence of God. What He wants to see is a man or a woman that's a Christian in their heart. That's what the world wants to see. The world wants to see men and women who are just exactly what they're supposed to be, what you profess to be. If I wasn't for Christ tonight, I'd be standing here against Him. But I know He's real, and I love Him, and that's why I'm here for Him. 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min No doubt someday will seal my testimony with my blood, but I'm be happy at that day, for I know that He's the Lord Jesus Christ. I know that He cannot fail. I know He's love.

L-39 Here sometime ago when I'd lost my family and everything, someone met me and said, "Brother Branham, did you keep your religion during that time?" I said, "No, brother, it kept me." Said, "What do you think of Christ now? There's your wife and your baby laying yonder in that grave molding. There's your daddy and your brother laying yonder, all in a few days apart. What do you think about Him now?" I said, "He's more than life to me. I love Him with all that's within me."

L-40 Hardest hour I ever struck in my life, just give you a personal testimony. When I went into the room of my dying baby, there I'd been a Gospel preacher for about six years; I stood there by my baby. They wouldn't let me go in, didn't want me to go in, but I slipped in. It was down in the basement in an isolated ward. Flies had got in its little eyes, and I shooed the flies out, and put a little net like over it. I looked at the little thing, and I said, "Sharon, do you know your daddy?" And she'd suffered so hard till her little baby blue eyes had crossed. My heart was gripped. Her mother was laying in the morgue the night before. I got down on my knees, and I said, "Heavenly Father, what have I done to deserve this? Will You spare my baby? O blessed Lord, please do." And look like come a black sheet unfolding like that, just shut her off from my view. He absolutely refused to hear my prayer. I stood up and looked at her like that; I knew she was gone.

L-41 Satan come to me, and he said, "Will you serve Him now? There's your wife; your father's just left; your brother was killed up there on the road; there's your wife in the morgue. Oh, yes, you're a preacher. He ought to be kind to you, shouldn't He? Will you serve Him?" That was the most cruelest temptation I ever had, for there was my baby and what had I done? Nothing as I knowed of. I said, "Reveal it to me God, I'll make it right."

L-42 "But every son that cometh to God must be chastened and tried." Then all of a sudden, I was left alone to make my decision. I put my hand over on her little head, and I said, "Shari, honey, the angels are coming to take you home. Daddy will pack your little body down yonder and lay it in the arms of Mama, and I will bury you out yonder on the graveyard hill; but some glorious day daddy will see you again." I raised my hands to Him; I said, "Lord, if You slay me, yet I will trust You. I love You." And a great peace come settling down over me. I remember going out to the graveyard there, and an old dove setting up in a bush, cooing. Seemed like that wind had come down through them pines there singing, There's a land beyond the river, That we call the sweet forever, We only reach that shore by faith decree; One by one we gain the portal, There to dwell with the immortal, Someday they will ring those golden bells for you and me.

L-43 Not long ago my boy and I went down to the grave to take some flowers at Easter, and it was about just the brink of day. The little fellow was packing a pot of flowers to put on his mama's and sister's grave. I took off my hat as I walked down. I seen him take off his little hat and start snubbing. I took the flower from him and set him--the flower down, about where the little baby was laying. I put my arm around him. I said, "Billy, honey, mama and little sister is not laying there. You see that morning star hanging yonder? Way across the sea yonder in the lands of Jerusalem, there's a empty tomb this morning. Our Lord rose again, and they died in Christ, and those that are in Christ will God bring with Him at His coming." Oh, brother, genuine love can take its everlasting stand right on the rock, and the waves of death is dashing beneath it, and look afar away to Him that said, "I am the Resurrection and Life" saith God. Certainly there will nothing will ever surpass the love of God. Certainly not. "Hear ye Him," the only One Who can produce real love to you.

L-44 Let us bow our heads just a moment. Blessed Lord, as my heart fills to think of times gone by, if it would only just being loyal to a denomination I'd have been gone long ago. I'm so glad that one day I felt Your loving arms go around 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min my poor sinful shoulders, when I was chuckling and crying and telling You how mean I was. There setting on a pair of wheel spurs, You give to me Your love. Something went down in my poor Irish heart that's never left me since that day. O God, through many dangers, toils, and snares I have already come. Your love and grace has brought me safe thus far, and it will take me on. Oh, some glorious morning the sun will fail to come up; she will move around yonder in the west and turn bloody. The stars will refuse to shine. The moon will fade out of the picture. That's the hour Lord that I want to see when them dead begin to come from the grave to be caught up in the air, I want to be numbered among them. God, if I have to lose every friend I got on earth and everything else, I want to be right on that day. Dear Father, I pray that I'm here, as I promised my dying companion I'd stay on the field until You come. I pray that You'll help me tonight. That You'll give me some sort of a word, some way, that'll touch down deep into the hearts of people and cause them to receive Thy beloved Son and really be borned again, not in a denomination, not in some kind of an ism, but truly with genuine Christian love that never fails. May they hear the Son of God say, "This is Me, and I come to welcome you to a life of love and freedom." Grant it, Father. We ask it in His Name.

L-45 And while we have our heads bowed, I wonder over the audience tonight if there would be someone here that would feel deep down in their heart, say, "Brother Branham, truly from the depths of my soul I know I haven't got that kind of keeping love. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Show me one man in the world could ever bring it back to its place again. It's not here. You be loyal to your nation, but brother above all... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] That I know that I've passed from death to life. I raise my hands and saying, "Be merciful, God."

L-46 Now, heavenly Father, Thou did see the hands of these men and women, literally dozens of them, and they're sincere. The Holy Spirit's just begin moving in the meeting. We can see them as they look, wonder, God speaking at their heart. You said, "No man can come to Me except My Father draws him. All the Father has given Me will come. None of them will be lost, I'll raise them up at the last days; I'll give them Everlasting Life (imperishable Life). O God, I pray for each one that raised their hands. And many in here who did not raise their hands and should've, I pray for them likewise, Lord. May this be the greatest challenging hour of their life to accept life instead of death. Grant it, Father, as the music sweetly plays "Saviour, hear my humble cry." Grant it, Lord, that many just now will make that everlasting decision and say, "yes" to Christ. And may in the stillness of their soul, come that love coming down from heaven, that peace that passes all understanding that changes darkness unto light, death unto life. May it happen just now all over this building. For we ask it in Jesus' Name, Thy Son, committing them to Thee. Amen. Saviour, Saviour, (Just let--relax yourself in the Spirit; this is a worship.) ... ble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by.

L-47 How many really loves Him now, raise your hands, say, "I..." That's good; that's wonderful. Thou the stream of all my comfort, More than life to me, Whom have I on earth beside Thee? Who in Heaven but Thee? Saviour, Saviour, Oh, hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by.

L-48 That's right, just keep the music going. Let's just bathe in this atmosphere. Oh, it's so seldom you ever get this. I'm just a old fashion Christian. I believe in that sweetness of the Spirit. I just--I hope you don't class me a fanatic; I don't mean to be; but I just feel just like in my soul that I'd just like to burst out and cry or something, just something sweeping into my life. Oh, what relaxing it is. It's like coming up to a big old oak tree and setting down in a hot day, feeling the cool breeze as it bathes back and forth. Jesus Christ is present. Can you tonight, Christian friend, can you just draw up your conceptions just for a moment? 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min Let's think of this. You believe this Bible to be God's eternal Word? Sure you do. Well, it is. God's just as real as... He's just as real as--as you're... He's more real than you are, because, after all, you're just a shadow. You long for Everlasting Life, don't you? Sure you do. You people that's my age and older, you long to get back young again. I'm going to preach on that in a night or two. I can prove it by the Bible you're on your road back. Yes, sir.

L-49 What is it? What makes you long that? This is a shadow. If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting for us. We go into that youthful place to never, never be old again. How beautiful. That's what makes us call, the deep calling to the deep. There's something there that makes us long and what is it? It's that body waiting there. We groan here to be clothed upon, where I can shake your hand and you'll never be old. You'll never set in a wheelchair, Brother Dawson. Where you'll never be blind, my brother, where life will be real, where life is life... How could we turn such an invitation down? Think that someday, someday, we're going to snap back and go to be with Him. I--I know that's truth. Christ is here; He's raised from the dead.

L-50 I don't think we have time yet to call a big prayer line. I'm just going to pray for you from here. I want every one of you to be willing. Here a few days ago, a woman run up to me and she said, "Mr. Branham," she said, "my mother's right out here; she's sick." It was hundreds and hundreds of people congregated. I said, "I couldn't get to her, sister, like that. I couldn't get through the mob. Take my hanky here and go lay it on her." And she bawled me out for not going. No wonder her mother didn't get healed. You can't do it like that. See? It isn't nothing that I've got to give you; it's something that God already has given you. You just got to receive it. I'm just a testimony of His. I'm a testimony of His resurrection. He's here. The only thing you have to have is faith to believe it.

L-51 Now, if the Lord Jesus has raised from the dead and in His audiences He stood, when you can look upon the audience, and they would touched Him by the feelings of their infirmities, He would turn and say, "Who touched Me?" He look around over the audience till He found who it was, tell them what had happened. He knowed where a man was under a tree. He knowed a man's name that come to Him, knowed his daddy's name, knowed his Christian name. And if Christ is raised from the dead, the Bible said, "He's the High Priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities." Now, listen to me just a moment. Christ is in this building now. Christ is in you just now, you believers. Christ was in Joseph, did you see how it made him act? Christ was in Elijah. Christ was in David. Look at David, rejected, dethroned with his own people, rejected as king in Jerusalem, went up to the mount of Olives and looked back, weeping. Eight hundred years the Son of David set on the same mountain, rejected, and wept, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how oft would I have gathered you." See, It's Christ.

L-52 Now, if it's Christ in you, Christ will recognize Christ. "My sheep know My voice; a stranger they will not follow." Now, if... God knows that I know none of you here. There's not a person outside of my dear Brother Dawson setting here that I know in this building in front of me. But Christ knows you all. And if "He's the High Priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities," if He will confirm that, and He said, "The things that I do shall you also." He proved it and the Jews believed Him (the real Jew), the church didn't believe Him; they never did; they never will; they don't yet. The so-called church, the ecclesiastical system, they never believed Him; they don't yet; and they never will. Now, that's awful. You say, "Brother Branham, you're so rude." No I'm not, brother, sister, dear. I'm telling the truth.

L-53 If you only knowed the price that I've paid, my brethren, to stand here tonight. I could tell you something that would shock you. Just because of the truth and the Gospel that I've stood clearly for, you don't know what it's cost. Certainly you don't. To maintain favor in the Presence of God is to be honest with God and to be honest with you. And if I won't be honest with you, I will not be honest with God. And if I can't be honest with my brethren who I do see, how can I be honest with God Who we can't see? It seemed to me last night, when I was standing here, that Angel made a move right in this corner here. And I looked at 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min that little, yellow, sacred glow hanging there in the corner. It seemed to me that spiritual people would've, should've been over. Then I didn't think that I would say what I did, and all of a sudden a cruel rebuke came. Hundreds swarmed down. See?

L-54 Tonight there's a different feeling in the building. Why, it should been that way at the first place. We're ready. You just believe God now. Now, let's put God to a challenge. How many in here that, especially some that I can see, when the anointing gets a little deeper... Now, look, no matter how much of a gift God has given me, if you don't believe that gift, it'll never do one speck of good. When Jesus Himself with the Fullness of the Godhead bodily in Him, He came to a city, they said, "Now, who is this anyhow? Ain't that the carpenter's son? Why He never went to school around here; He has no education to speak of. Where did He ever get this learning at; what school did He go to? We know nothing about Him." And they were offended at Him. And many mighty works He could not do.

L-55 But when they believed Him, when He performed a miracle on Philip and told him, or Nathanael, and told him where he was at... Performed a miracle on the woman at the well and told here where her trouble was, she said, "We know the Messiah will do that when He comes, but Who are You?" He said, "I'm He." My, she went in... Now, He never went into the city and done any miracles, 'cause He knowed He left that for Philip to do after He left; but He sowed the Word. And Philip come down and had the miracles in--in Samaria. Now, Christ is raised from the dead; He's here. Now, everyone look this a way. And if Christ, by three witnesses in this building tonight, will prove that He is alive...

L-56 Now, how is it, "We are the branches; He is the Vine." How many knows John 15 teaches that? Jesus said, "I am the Vine; ye are the branches." Now, the vine does not bear fruit, does it? No, sir, the branches bear fruit. The vine only energizes the branches. Well now, we're the branches. That's God's Word. Now, don't look and say, "Brother Branham this, or John this, or so-and-so." Jesus is the One you're looking to. He's the Life of the vine; He's the Life of the branch. And the same Life that's in the vine will be in the branch, and It'll produce the same Life that's in the Vine if it's truly a--a branch. Now, if we're the branches, Christ will appear.

L-57 Now, could I save you? No, sir. You that held your hand awhile ago; it's impossible for me to do that. You've been saved every since Jesus died. Could I heal you? If I had healing power my brother wouldn't set in that chair another five minutes. No, sir. I've watched each night over that man. I know him; I love him. See? And I've prayed in earnest and just got a letter here in my pocket from my secretary, said, "Be sure to see Brother Dawson." I called him, and I said, "He's setting right before each night. I'm watching." If I had one speck of healing power, he wouldn't set there like that, or none of the rest of you would. I haven't got it, and nobody else has got it; it--it's yours. It's the purchase of Jesus Christ nineteen hundred years ago that He died for you and "He was wounded for your transgressions; with his stripes you were healed."

L-58 Now, first thing is preach it out of the Word; then the next thing is working in gifts and signs. Now, He's raised from the dead, and three is a witness as we preached tonight. If He will take three people from somewhere in this audience and will confirm the same Message that He had when He was here on earth in the same sign of the Messiah-ship, would you go home tonight on your road saying, "Did not our hearts burn within us?" as--as those who came from Emmaus, Cleopas and his friend? They walked with Him all day. No doubt you've done for years, but one time He got them inside, and He done a miracle just like He did it before His crucifixion that proved that He was the living Jesus. If He will do the same thing tonight, we should go home saying, "Our hearts are burning within us; truly He's raised from the dead; all things are mine through Christ."

L-59 Now, be real reverent. Anywhere in the building, no matter where you are, look this a way, and pray, and say, "Lord Jesus, I'm not approaching Brother Branham; I'm approaching You. I'm sick and needy, and if You'll just have something said to me tonight..." Or if you're not sick, say, "I know so-and-so down there; they're sick. Have the... Lord Jesus, you speak through... If we are Your vine, if You're--we are Your branches, You speak through Brother Branham tonight and confirm it to this person. I'll believe You; I'll never doubt no more." 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min That's--that's just putting Him to a test. He said, "Prove Me, saith the Lord."

L-60 Now, that's a great thing. Oh, brother, we have a lot of impersonation; I realize that. And a lot of it's bogus; we realize that, but that don't make the real one bogus. We got a real Lord Jesus, a real Son of God, and He works in powers and wonders. And if... Do you realize what I'm directly, indirect in contact of better than ten million people around the world. People will lay right onto your words, and then at the judgment I have to answer for that word. Have to be careful what you're saying. I come here to Edmonton because I felt led to come here to Edmonton. And I'm here; it's up to God to do the rest. It's up to you to believe it.

L-61 God, give us three tonight, please. Just feel just forsaken just at the time, now just be reverent. Do you remember in the Bible, how it said, "Each set still and something be revealed?" Said, "If you all speak with tongues won't--won't somebody come in and say you're all crazy, if you all speak with tongues?" But said, "If one prophesies and reveals the secret of the heart, then they'll fall down and say truly God's with you." Is that right? Sure. He's God of all gifts.

L-62 Now, in Jesus Christ's Name I take every spirit under the control of the Holy Spirit for the glory of God. The picture that you see and the Light on it, at the judgment bar I'll stand as a witness for this night, It isn't two foot from where I'm standing right now. Now, be reverent. This is the worship. You heard the message; this is worship. Please understand it. This is when you pour out the adoration of your heart to Christ in love.

L-63 I see a lady keeps coming before me, here, right here. You got spinal trouble; something's wrong in your spine. And you're praying for somebody; it's a woman. It's your mother; it's a mental condition. That's true. I never seen you in my life. Now, Mrs. Herd, if you'll believe with all your heart, you can find it the way you believe. That's your name, isn't it? Raise up your hand if that's right.

L-64 You kept nodding your head, lady, there. You thought It was coming to you, but the Light was over the lady. You look at me just a minute. Do you believe me to be God's servant? Do you believe, the second lady there? Do you believe me to be God's servant? I just single out one until... Do you think that I'd stand here and tell you something wrong? You don't? Well, if you have a need of anything, you--you just ask God. And just--just believe while I, while you're setting so close and the--the Angel was standing by the side of the woman. Now, you just believe, and as I talk to you like Jesus did to the woman, probably that distance away, till He found out what her trouble was. And if God in heaven, the first thing... Are we strangers to each other? The second lady there. We're strangers to each other? You. Raise up your hand if we're strangers.

L-65 All right. I see the lady is suffering with a stomach trouble; she has a stomach trouble. That's the Spirit of the Lord. Now, the same God that revealed to the woman at the well where her trouble was, has revealed where your trouble is. And here's something else. I see you got trouble in your back too. That is right. That is exactly right. And you're praying for somebody, and that is your husband. And he's not here. I can see him too now. And if God will reveal to me what your husband, is wrong with him, will you accept his healing too? It's a rash. That's right. Raise up your hand. Now, you want me to tell you what your name is? You're Mrs. Wilson. That's right. All right, now, just believe with all your heart, you can have what you ask for.

L-66 What about the next lady. Do you believe me to be God's prophet? What do you think about this, you believe it to be the truth? I don't mean, excuse me for--I don't mean excuse me. That word prophet stumbles the people, I'll--I'll say servant. Why, you are suffering with a spinal trouble. That's exactly right. If that's right, raise up your hand. Are we strange to each other? Wave your hand like this. What if I told you you was over it now? She believed it.

L-67 And it happens to be this other little lady setting here next to her, praying. What do you think about this, lady, little lady with the white dress? You believe me to be God's prophet, or servant? If God will reveal to me what your trouble is, will you believe it? The first place, you're real nervous. And another thing, you have spine trouble too. That's exactly right. That's THUS SAITH THE LORD. That's right, raise up your hand. All right, you can go home and be 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min well. There's about four or five in a row.

L-68 I see a lady right over the back of your head just praying as hard as she can. She's got her hand up like this, an aged woman, about middle age. What do you think about this, sister, do you, yes, you there, looking right straight over top the lady's head. Do you believe with all your heart? Do you believe me to be God's servant? The reason I say that is this: He said, "If you get the people to believe you," not believe me as Him, believe that He sent me. If God will speak to me what's on your heart, or something that I know nothing about, will you believe with all your heart? If we are totally strangers to each other, raise up your hand so the people can see. All right, look this way now. If my audience could only see that settling to the woman. Now, the first thing she's--she's wanting prayer for something; that's her eyes; she's losing her sight. That's right. If that's right, raise you hand. That's what you wanted prayer for, is that right? You still believe me to be the servant of God? You believe that's true? You got glasses on; let's look for something else. Just look right here to me again. You're wearing glasses. People say, "Sure, the man could see she had glasses on." Well, look this a way. May God of heaven help us. God knows it's for His glory.

L-69 Yes, here it is. You've got a burden on your heart. And that burden on your heart is, I see one, two, three, four, four boys; and those boys are backslid; and you're praying for their soul. And that's your little girl setting next to you. And that child has her head down praying, and right now that little girl is a praying for a sister-in-law that's backslid, unsaved. That right, honey? Little girl, raise up your hand if that's right, sweetheart. All right. Go find it; God give you just exactly what you've asked for. Do you believe? If thou canst believe, all things are possible. But He can only do it as you believe it. It's got to be your belief, your faith.

L-70 Here, I just see the Light over a young man standing here with a handkerchief in his hand, right back over here: you, son. Yeah. You believe God Almighty has sent His Son, Christ Jesus, and He died? He promised the things that He did, we'd do also? Do you believe He sent me to take His place to talk to you? All right. If He will reveal to me, like He did to the woman at the well, or to Nathanael who came, you, will you accept it then? All your life you suffered with nervousness, and you're a nervous person. You have all kind of scruples and things and everything. You cross bridges 'fore you get to it and all, always upset about everything. Isn't that right? I see even as a little boy, when in school, you still got a little frictions, things that upset you all the time, just continually upset. Is that's right, isn't it? If that's right raise up your hand and wave your handkerchief there. All right. It's finished; you can go home and be well. He Who knew what you was when you was a child, surely knows what the future will be. You go home; be just as happy as you can be. Rejoice and be glad.

L-71 There's a little woman setting right behind him with her hand up to her mouth; she's praying. Do you believe me to be God's servant, lady? Will, if God will reveal to me what you're praying about, will you accept Jesus as--to provide what you ask? Are we strangers to each other? Raise your hand if... All right, you got heart trouble. And if that's right raise your hand. It's a fluttering in your heart. And you have it mostly after you eat and lay down. It kinds a smothering around your heart sometime, you get flutters, upset. It's a nervous condition in your heart that does that; you got a nervous heart. Now, do you believe that Christ healed you? If you do, raise your hand up. Now, go home and be well then in the Name of the Lord Jesus.

L-72 I challenge any faith in here to look and believe it. It's Jesus Christ is not mythical; He's here. Don't you want Him? Don't you love Him? Don't you believe... That man setting right back over there with prostate trouble, kind of a shadow over his head, setting right back there, if you'll believe, sir, at this time, you can have your healing, if you'll accept it. Praying for it, get up at nights go at the bathroom; you know what I'm speaking of. If you'll accept it with all your heart, you can have what you ask for. All right. Who else wants to be healed? Who wants to be healed? Just raise you hand. Now, just keep your hands up.

L-73 Merciful Father, while this magnificent Presence of the Lord... I thought surely, Lord, You would do it. If these sinners come to You, if they would just wring their heart instead of their hands, not be nervous and upset, but just wring their heart before God and say, "God, I believe You. Take all--all fear and doubt away from me." I pray, God, 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min that You'll heal every one of them. All the way through the building, may every person be healed tonight. Let Your Holy Spirit come just now, and sweep over this audience, and heal every person that's sick. I plainly told them, Lord, that I could not heal or no other man, that You've already did this for them, and You're here alive tonight in the building, proving it to us, that You're Jesus Christ, God's Son. And You love Your people and trying to get them to return to the faith that was once delivered to the saints. I pray, Father, that You'll grant it tonight, and may faith anchor in every heart sufficiently for their healing. In Jesus' Name I pray. Amen.

L-74 What do you think? Do you believe Him? Now, you who raised your hand just a few minutes ago. Would you walk up here just a minute, sinners and so forth? I'd like to pray with you right here. Walk up here. That's good, my brother, come right up here, I want to shake your hand. God, bless you. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] "Weak and adulterous generation seeks for miracles." But do you believe God will give sight to this little blind boy? A jackknife stabbed his eyes and put them out. I want every head bowed, every eye closed. Now, turn... Don't no one, in Jesus Christ's Name, don't you raise your head till you hear my voice say so. I've called two prayer lines, never got nothing in it that could show a miracle. I just want you--I believe; I don't know whether God will do it or not; I'm only asking Him to. But I want you to know that Jesus don't only know the hearts of men; He heals men. Now, I want every eye bowed, every head bowed, every heart bowed. Do not raise your head. I know you think sometimes, "What are you doing, Brother Branham?" I'm doing the same thing that Jesus did when He put them out of the house when He healed Jairus' daughter.

L-75 The father of this little boy is standing here, right present. The little fellow accepted Christ a few moments ago and walked up and shook my hand. I seen him stagger against the side. I said, "Is he blind?" He said, "Yes." I asked the man brought him; he said, "His father will tell you." He come there and he's put his eyes out with a jackknife. Now, this is just a little boy who can't exercise much faith for himself. The sight has been stabbed out. What if this was your son. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Now, I don't know. God may not do it, but I trust that He will so that these people of Edmonton will find out that I'm not telling them anything wrong.

L-76 Now, sonny, I want you just lay your head right over on me, like this. Will you be a good boy now, since you serve, come to the Lord Jesus? Will you go to Sunday School and worship Him, if God will give you your sight so you could go around again? You will? You haven't got a Sunday School to go to? Shame on this country. You've got a Jesus that'll come to you, honey. Let's bow. Now, Lord, Creator of heavens and earth, Author of Everlasting Life, Giver of every good gift, this lovely little lad, he struck my heart when I seen him bump up against the place down there. He's blind. O God, this poor little boy, don't let him stay this way, God. You alone can make the blind to see. Four years now... Give to him his sight, dear God.

L-77 I come to Edmonton just at Your will, believing that You sent me here. O God, hear the prayer of--of Your servant in this church, as we pray now. And if we found grace in Your sight, we pray that You'll give us this miracle tonight. And if we're wrong and asking it, forgive us, Lord. We don't mean to be; we don't seek for miracles, because You said, "A weak and adulterous generation seeks after such," and the miracle to be given will be the resurrection. And we seen that miracle night after night. But, Lord, You was the One Who touched the man's eyes, and he could see. You said, "When the blind spirit left his eyes, the deaf spirit left his ears..." I pray, heavenly Father, that You'll make these eyes that's stabbed out, that somehow the great Creator of heavens and earth will perform a miracle here. Your Word is at stake, Lord. And I pray that if we found grace in Your sight, that You'll restore sight to the eyes of this little blind boy. In the Name of Jesus, God's Son, I ask this blessing to happen now for the glory of God.

L-78 Every head bowed. No one look, please till you hear me say so. Now, sonny, I want you to raise, keep your eyelids closed, raise your head. Now, I want you to look at me. Can you see me? Can you see my finger? See my hand? Do I have... What did I have, did I have any finger up? Could you touch my nose? Can you see my nose? See if you can touch my nose, raise your finger. There you are. Look up here and see if that, what's that look like? A light? Can you count them? Now, you can raise your head. Sight's come to the little boy's eyes. Point up to them lights, sonny, and show them that you can see them lights. Point around here, show them both these over here, over on this other side and up this way. 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min Amen. Now, watch here. Show them you can touch my nose here; show them. Reach over here and touch. Let's say, "Praise be to God."

L-79 Now, father, take him home. The end of this meeting, if you're still in the meeting, bring him here and show us what he can see. God bless you. Let's give God praise, everybody. Do you believe Jesus lives? Saviour, Saviour, Here my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Oh, do not pass me by. Now, the little boy was just here is just an example. I just waited for a little bit. Of course, as long as he was standing this close and the anointing was on him, his eyes were bound to see. I've never asked for anything in my life 'less it happened or something, why? Now, I'm believing the little boy's sight will continue to come to him so that you can see, we haven't...

L-80 It's already supposed to close up here, I think at nine-thirty if we can. And we're way past due. And we thank everybody, their custodians and everything for letting us stay overtime and things. And we been overtime about every night.

L-81 But here stands a bunch of penitent people, standing at this altar. God bless you, my dear friends. Jesus Christ be merciful to you. The same Jesus here, Who knows all things, knows you, and can do all things. Do you believe it? Then let us bow our heads while we worship Him. Ask Him, repent each one of you. Ask Him to forgive your sins. Ask Him to take you into His blessed Presence. And now, I want the ministers of the city to come forward and stand around these penitent people. The ministers of this city, and other cities too, come here and stand around these penitent people like this while we pray.

L-82 We want you to give them an invitation to your church. Whatever church you belong to, we want you to come here and tell them people you want them to come to your church. And you know where they're at and if they're in your district or somewhere, we want these people to have a church home. If they've never been baptized, we want you to baptize them with water, 'cause that's what they're supposed to be done. That's the Gospel. "Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, your children, to them that's far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." That's in Acts 2:38-39. All right. The commission is still good to whosoever will repent and be baptized, your sins shall be forgiven. God said so.

L-83 Now, I want each one of you, and you minister brothers, if you want to walk out here... Now, let's bow our heads everyone while we pray for these people. You ministers lay your hands over on them while they're standing there. Every person that's interested in lost souls... Heavenly Father, by the working of the Holy Spirit, tonight we have been here at a lengthy time, but O God, we got an eternity before us. And we're happy to know that these have come to take their stand and get their tickets, as it was, to pass over the sea one of these days. Tonight You spoke to their hearts, and they've humbly walked out here, many of them, and standing around the altar. They're surrendering their life to Thee.

L-84 O God, Who knows the secrets of the heart, You know what's in each one of them. And I pray, heavenly Father, that You'll love them into Thy bosom. Grant it, Lord. We know that they could not have raised from their seat by their own power, for they have none. The body is totally dead without the spirit, and the spirit has made a decision at the calling of God, and they have come forward now to profess this decision that they've made. They have chose Jesus as their Saviour. O Jehovah, Thou has given them to Him; they are love gifts from You. And I as Your servant, present them to Him by the fruits of this Message, in the Name of the Lord Jesus. I pray, eternal and blessed Father, that You will keep them in perfect peace. May no harm and danger come to them.

L-85 And everyone that's standing here that's sick, or crippled, or afflicted, may it leave them at this time, that they've confessed their sins and believed on Jesus, Who is present now. He has proved He is present by His great manifestation 57-0807, Hear Ye Him, Edmonton Arena, Edmonton, AB, 101 min of His Spirit, and we ask now that You'll forgive them all their trespasses. Thou has said in Thy Word, "He that heareth My words and believe on Him that sent Me, hath Everlasting Life, and shall never come to the judgment; but is passed from death to Life." What a miracle: dead sinners a few minutes ago, awaken to the Lord Jesus now. Before the world was ever formed You predestinated them unto Eternal Life, and tonight they have come to accept It in the Presence of the resurrected Jesus.

L-86 Someday, if You tarry, their bodies will no doubt go down here on the sod somewhere; but on that great and notable day that we've looked for for six thousand years, Jesus shall come, and the dead in Christ shall rise. We shall be caught up together to meet them in the air. What a day that will be. May they say as David, "Moreover my flesh shall rest in hope. For Thou will not suffer thy holy One to see corruption, neither will He leave His soul in hell." Some glorious day because Jesus raised we shall too and come forth in His likeness. Keep them in perfect peace with this faith, Lord. Their dear old mothers and dads, many of them's passed over, some of them have offered prayer. And if it be such a thing tonight as they would have conscious of knowing, may they know that their wandering child has come home. Angels bear record of it. We know that the black flags of hell has been defeated tonight by the Gospel, and the white flags of heaven and the angels are rejoicing because sinners have come home. God's been made manifest. I give them to Thee now for Eternal Life as Thou has promised. And Thou has said, "He that will confess Me before men, him will I confess before My Father and the holy angels." Grant this blessing in Jesus' Name.

L-87 Now, you at the altar here that's standing here, if you truly and humbly believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God, accept Him as your personal Saviour, turn right around towards the audience as a witness that you believe that Jesus is here and forgives every sin. Turn right around towards the audience. I want all the audience, balcony and all, to raise your hands of fellowship, that you welcome them into fellowship in the Body of the Lord Jesus. Oh, what a wonderful time. Shake hands now in a minute, soon as the meeting's dismissed, with these ministers. Get you a good church home and there abide until Jesus comes. Right now we're going to have the people to come shake hands with them just in a moment. Before that, I'm asking our good pastor, Brother Rasmusson, to come to the microphone here for the dismissing of the church at this time. God bless you. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
