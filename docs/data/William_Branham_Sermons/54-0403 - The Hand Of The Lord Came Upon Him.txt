--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 ... evening, friends. Happy to be here again this evening to serve again in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ. And I'm... Always a privilege for me to speak for Him, Who has died for me and done so much for me. Now, we are very thankful for the services that God has given us this past week here in the Church of the Open Door. We're grateful to Brother Cauble and to his staff of workers here at this place, who opened their doors so courteously, and let us come in to visit with you, and to fellowship around the Word of God and the blessings of our Lord Jesus Christ. God bless Brother Cauble. And may the work here grow until the crowds will be standing around the wall every night in his services. And he opened... It was the Church of the Open Door for me. As soon as I had an opportunity to come to Louisville, why, he opened the church door.

L-2 Now, tomorrow night, the auditorium down here, called the... Is it Municipal or...? Me--Memorial--Memorial Auditorium, tomorrow night, beginning at--at seven-thirty, I suppose, Brother Cauble? Seven-thirty tomorrow night. We expect you to come out now. We'll have seating room for all. I--I was there once before when a little David was here. I came over. And the best I know, it'll seat between three and four thousand people, or something like that. So tomorrow, tell your neighbor and the one you been wanting to bring for the healing services. At tomorrow night there'll be plenty seating room, so bring them out. Come early. We expect good singing and the glory of the Lord with us.

L-3 Tomorrow morning, here at the Church of the Open Door... Last Sunday, I was supposed to be here to preach, and I announced in my own church, and so I had to kinda split the time. And God, of course, was in that, for it was a fulfilling of a vision when this man here was supposed to meet me at that place the next time I saw him. And I never knew him of coming on Sunday morning as long as I was knowed the place. He doesn't come on Sunday morning. But that time, it was Sunday morning; it was that time I had to be there. And it was that time he come to the right place at the right time. Not knowing ahead of time what he was going to do, but the church all knew just how he was to meet me. And God worked that just right. Tomorrow morning, immediately after Sunday School, here, I think that's when my... Nine-thirty is Sunday School and then ten forty-five I'm to speak tomorrow morning: preach the Gospel, whatever the Lord shall lay to do. And then that'll probably last one of my thirty minutes. Any other people is about two hours, I suppose. But my thirty minute sermons...

L-4 And now, come out. If you have no post of duty to fulfill, why, we'd be happy to have you tomorrow morning. Then tomorrow evening, seven-thirty at the Auditorium, expecting great blessings... And I'm expecting to be there, if the Lord willing. And I got to leave tomorrow afternoon, out of the city again, back. And then, soon as this service close, go straight to Shreveport, in Louisiana; leave Shreveport for Denver, Colorado, and from there to British Colombia, and be back in America in about two months. And then services up at Cedar Lake, the Methodist Campground, and from there, think to Des Moines, Iowa. And then from Des Moines, over to the Pacific Northwest and then overseas. This time, it's THUS SAITH THE LORD, so it's--it's really... The Lord is moving now, and great things are under great anticipations of going.

L-5 Now, we're thankful for the reports and testimonies that's coming in, of the healings in the meetings. We... It's been rather slow according to the meetings, otherwise, but they're... I don't think we've had one ambulance case, one cot case, stretcher, anything like that. It's just been people, more or less, who were diseased, and plagued, and sinned in their life, and things the Holy Spirit has been revealing. So there's been nothing in here as like that, that we have seen: nothing but some deaf people, I believe. And I don't know if they told me a blind person... By the way, I'm getting this... This is another tape here, I think it isn't setting close enough to pick it up, so if you don't mind, ever who's on the recording, I'll set it that way. Now, I can depend on you all praying for me, can't I? I--I trust that you'll do that, for I certainly solicit your prayers and 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min are just as helpless as I could be without someone praying for me.

L-6 And I will hurry just as quick as I can, speak to you just a few moments, go right into the healing service, because of those who are standing. Tomorrow morning will be preaching services. Now, the Lord bless you. Now, I can open the pages of this Bible, but I can't open the Bible. God alone has to do that. No man on earth, or in heaven, or beneath the earth was worthy to open the Book or to loose the seals thereof. And John saw One that had been slain from the foundation of the world. He came and taken the book out of the right hand of Him that set upon a throne, and opened the seals, and opened the Bible for He was worthy. And that's the only One Who can open the Bible is the Lord Jesus Christ. So let's speak to Him just a moment in prayer. He's the Author of this Book.

L-7 Now, kind heavenly Father, the Word of God must have first place in the service. It must have first place in our life, and be first place in our thoughts, for It's eternal and shall never pass away. My words has to be altered like other man's word. Times and--has to be altered to meet time, but Thy Word never changes. There's no altering to God's Word. It's forever the same. And we're so grateful for this. And now, Holy Spirit, Author of this Word, will You come and open It for us tonight? And may the speaker be so submissive until the--You'll be able to come in, and take the Word of God, and place It right out into every hungry heart. And may there It lodge, find Its abiding place, and may It bring forth fruit, hundredfold: salvation, healing, joy, peace. Grant it, Father. Forgive us of our sins now. Help us to be Your humble children, for we ask it in the Name of Thy dear beloved Son Jesus Christ. Amen.

L-8 Just for a--a--a small portion of the reading, over in the Old Testament, of II Kings and the 3rd chapter and beginning and reading the 15th verse. To save time I was going to read about ten verses of it, but I'll just quote it as I go along. The 15th verse: ... now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.

L-9 Our scene tonight goes back in the days of Israel when they were in the homelands of Palestine. It was immediately after a great tragedy had happened. Judah and Israel had broken up and had become two nations, as it was. And Ahab, the king, who got out of God's will by marrying a woman that was not of the faith... Do you know that's still a good thing, young man, to think about, young woman? Marry someone who is a Christian. Don't marry unbelievers. "Yoke yourself not up among unbelievers." Paul said for us not to do that. The Scriptures, all through, forbid us, for we... to yoke ourself with unbelievers. But if you are already yoked up with an unbeliever, and he's willing to live with you, or she, in peace, don't leave them. Just remain and live a Christian life, that you might win your companion to Christ.

L-10 But, Ahab went over and married a little woman who was an idolater, and she brought idolatry into Israel. And at the death of Ahab, Jehoram, his son reigned in his place. And at the same time, a righteous, godly man by the name of Jehoshaphat, he reigned in Judaea. And the king of Moab was kindy afraid of Israel as long as it was united under Ahab, so he gave Ahab a thousand rams--or a thousand lambs and two thousand rams in their wool, trying to find favor, that he wouldn't come over and take his country. But immediately after Ahab died, and Jehoram reigned in his place, then the king of Moab rose up against Israel. And Israel went out and numbered all the people of Samaria. Jehoram, himself being a lukewarm believer: very typical of the church today in a lukewarm condition... Just a--a borderline preacher, a fellow that, "Well, I'd go to church, and I do the best I can." That's the most miserable person I know of in all America, is the man who says, "I do the best I can. I go to church. I hope I'm all right."

L-11 The salvation of Jesus Christ is not a "hope so," it's a "know so." You know when you are Christ's. The Holy Spirit bears record with your spirit that you're sons and daughters of God; old things have passed away and all things become new. Oh, I hope we get it tonight. Not a borderline minister, not a borderline Christian: if the crowd's a going this way, you go with it. If it goes that way, you go with it. Stay in the road. Stand in the liberty where Christ has made you free. Be not again entangled in the yoke of bondage or halfway; God said it made Him sick. Said, "I would you would be hot or cold." For lukewarm, He'd spew it from His mouth. So God doesn't want a person that's just a "professor" without being a "possessor" of the blessings of God. God, grant that the day hurries to Louisville, Kentucky, and all America, 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min when Christians that profess to be Christians will be just what they profess to be. God, grant it.

L-12 If I wasn't for Christ tonight, I'd sure be against Him. But I'm for Him; I love Him; I believe Him. My whole life, I'll give it anytime freely for Him. I believe what I'm preaching to be the truth. And I know that it's carried me this twenty-three years through safety around the world on my third trip through every kind of a demon possession, and all kinds of demonologies, and challenges, and people who's superstitious and try to call your hand on this, the other. He's brought me safe thus far; He'll take me on through. I believe Him with all my heart. I hope that it--'fore my life over, that I'll see thousands of these people through Louisville here preaching the Gospel. The people, these young men who are setting tonight, listening at the Gospel, winning mina--millions of souls to Christ.

L-13 Now, so this fellow, after he seen trouble coming, he thought he would go up to Judaea to Jehoshaphat and make an alliance with him. Now, here's another danger: Jehoshaphat, on the spur of the moment, according to the flesh, representing the Spirit-filled church, before he taken the second thought, he said, "After all, you're Israelite, so my footmen are your footmen, and my horses are your horses, and my chariot is your chariot." Just because it was flesh, be careful. You say, "Well, as long as I go to church, isn't that all right?" No. God never--never said one time He'd save a church member. He saves His children, not the church member. But now... And he... Before he thought, he made an alliance with this halfway lukewarm Christian, as we would call it of today, so we get our story backed up here to this place. Then they got the King of Edom then also, and said, "Which a way shall we go?"

L-14 They said, "Go up by the way of Edom, through the desert." And another thing, as soon as Jehoshaphat, ordinarily now, would've prayed over the subject, would've thought about it first and said, "God, what--what must I do?" But being yoked up with unbelievers, he took the unbelievers' way. And that's the way many spirit-filled Christian, after revival fall, because they yoke themselves up amongst people that said, "Well, I go to church. We're as good as the rest of them," and you lose your experience. Stay right in the road, no matter what the rest of them does. You know where you belong; you know Who you belong to. Stay right under the power of prayer all the time. Don't let them call you off to something else in amusements and so forth, saying, "There's no harm in this." If there's a question, don't do it. Stay away from it.

L-15 But now, Jehoshaphat, like all members or all church people, signed the agreement. And they went up the way of the desert without consulting the Lord. Now, then if you go do something without first consulting the Lord, you're sure to get in trouble. They was out there a few days, and the first thing you know, they were in trouble. They fetched a compass for seven days, enough to carry them over; and after seven days their water supply was cut off. They had nothing to drink. There they was setting out in the desert, and they said, "Now, look where we're at." Out in that condition, going without asking the Lord, going without consulting Christ about it, the first thing you know they were dried up in the desert, no water around them.

L-16 So Jehoshaphat, being the Christian man, as usual, thought the first thing is to seek God about it. I guess he thought then, we'd better start a prayer meeting. Kinda a late time sometime, to start a prayer meeting after you find yourself in the desert, isn't it? That's the way we all do though: wait till we get in trouble. Sometimes, you say, "I don't even believe in Divine healing." You have to wait till you get sick enough; then you'll believe in it. You just haven't got sick enough yet to believe in it. The doctor's never walked away and said, "There is nothing I can do for you." That's when you believe in it, then. How many times have I seen people like that in my day. And I've heard people that take the argument and say, "Oh, it's such a blessed thing to be sick. God uses it to bless us." How can it be a bless and cursing the same time?

L-17 A man, one time, in South Africa, where we was having a meeting at the Dutch Reformed Church, he stood up, after he'd... First, their papers blasted it everywhere, but when they found out that their members become so spiritual when they went back, they'd holler, "Amen," in church, and everything, they thought that then he got fanatically. So he went to church and he said--talked about such a blessing, how the Lord blessed the people with sickness. And the man's wife, a couple days later had appendicitis; rushed her to the hospital and cut the blessing out. Why? Yes. If it's such a 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min blessing to be sick, let her go ahead and be sick. Don't do nothing about it; you'd be doing something God wouldn't want you to do. If it's such a blessing to have a cancer, why take radium or anything; just let it go ahead and be a blessing. If you're more blessed when you're dead, and you can do more for the Lord when you're dead than when you're alive, well, go ahead and die. But God wants you here to fulfill His program. The grou--... The Bible said, "Above all things, I would that you'd prosper in health." That's Scripture, "... above all things, that you'd prosper in health." The writers of the Scripture, inspired by the Holy Spirit, which the Scripture says, "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God." Amen.

L-18 Notice then, when their supply was cut off, they begin to find out if there wasn't something could be done, 'cause Jehoshaphat said, "Isn't there a prophet of the Lord? Surely all this bunch of church people around here, there should be a prophet somewhere that we could find out what the will of the Lord is concerning this thing." Now, they knew the law; they knew the commandments. They'd had all the written Word, but they had to have something for this specific case. I hope you're getting this: something now for this case. That's the way in the meetings sometimes, say, "Well, why don't you just pray for the people?" Sometimes you noticed it in the meetings; it has to be something... The whole picture is Divine healing, salvation, but sometimes there's something in a fellow's way that keeps him from getting healed. You hear it right here on the platform: something they done somewhere else and something they've got to make right. They have to do that before the blessing of God can come on them. Certainly not. You can't do that. You'll never...

L-19 You could take a person; I've seen it many times, going to a healing service, and anoint them with oil, and pray over them; and people scream and stomp and holler at the devil. The devil don't care how much you holler; he's not deaf. He don't care how much you scream; that doesn't mean a thing to him. He'll never recognize that, but he will recognize faith. He's got to. Yes, sir. But if that person has sinned and something in their life that they should not have done or should've done, you could pour oil on them day and night, and it'll never do them any good. You could pray, scream, cry, cast out demons, as much as you want to; it'll never leave the person until they make that thing right. That's right. You've got to go get right with God first.

L-20 Now, that's the reason on the platform, watch how close and careful we watch it, to be sure before you pray or try to cast away an evil spirit, that that thing, person's life isn't clean and clear. If it's just something you're not sure of, I pass it by, because what... Did you know, through a Divine gift that you could mar your soul? Do you know Moses was a prophet of God, that God told him to go out and speak to the rock, and instead of speaking to the Rock, Moses went out, contrary to God's will, contrary to God's Word, and done exactly what God told him not to do; but was successful anyhow. He smote the Rock the second time. Is that right? He was a prophet. He had power to do what he wanted to do. As long as... And he smote the Rock, and the Rock brought forth the waters.

L-21 Elisha, that young prophet, the one we're speaking of now, on his road down, some little children run after him. He went bald headed when he was a little young fellow. And they begin to tease him about being bald headed, and that prophet turned around in his anger and put a curse those children. And before they got back home, two she bears killed forty-two little children. That ain't the Holy Spirit, but it was an angered prophet. You have to be careful. God dealt with Moses. He deals with the people. So if God has put something on a person, or let Satan put it on them for a purpose, to bring the person to Him or to do something, and you come take that off without this person repenting for it, see what kind of a trouble you got yourself in? You have to be careful.

L-22 And Jehoshaphat said, "Isn't there a prophet somewhere that we could find out whether we're doing right or not, whether we're in the will of the Lord?" And somebody said, "Well, there's Elisha down there. He poured water on Elijah's hands." In other words, he had had fellowship with a real prophet; he had been around where there was a man who knew what he was talking about. That was Elijah who was recognized a prophet. Oh, I like a good old fashion spiritual church. When you go to talking about spiritual people, say, "Well, he's from 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min Brother Cauble's." Somewhere or somewhere's church, some good spiritual church who's got sound Gospel teaching, he'll understand if you go to pray for him. He knows what Divine healing is. He knowed what the power of the Lord is. He knowed what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is. He's been around that type of people, and you know you're getting somewhere.

L-23 He said, "There's Elisha." Elijah was a perfect type (Elijah and Elisha) of the church and Christ. Notice, Elijah being the type of Christ, when he went to leave, before leaving... Notice it now; get it. Before leaving He made preparation that the Spirit of God must remain on the earth. God takes his man, never His Spirit. God took Christ, but the Holy Spirit's here tonight, vindicating Him, just the same Lord Jesus. He took Elijah. It come upon Elisha; come up on John the Baptist, the same spirit. Made Elisha act like Elijah, made John the Baptist act like Elijah, and it makes the church today act like Christ. Amen.

L-24 The devil takes his spirit--or, his man, but never his spirit. Them same teachers back there that condemned Jesus Christ, they were scholars to the minute. They were far beyond our seminary students today in the Word. They were holy men. No one could put a hand on them; they had to be holy; they had to be righteous; they had to be blameless; but yet, powered by Satan, didn't recognize the Son of God and condemned and killed Him. That's right. And that spirit lives on today. People who are just as fundamental, just as scholarly and teacher as they can be, having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof... The Bible said, from such turn away. Brother, they know the Word so perfect, just set It in order, lay It out there in such a masterpiece; yet know no more about God than a Hottentot would know about a Egyptian knight. That's right. Only thing they know, just the Word. The letter killeth; the Spirit giveth life. It's life comes by the Word made manifest. "Go ye into all the world and manifest the power to all nations": Mark 16. Preach the Gospel, not teach the Word; preach the Gospel. The Gospel is not through teaching the Word; it's the Word made manifest. These signs shall follow them that believe. They shall cast out devils, and heal the sick, and great signs and wonders... You see it? There it is; the Gospel made manifest. "Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world": Louisville, Kentucky, on this very Saturday night. "And wherever two or three are gathered in My Name, I'll be in their midst. And the things that I do, shall you also; even more than this, for I go to My Father. Yet a little while, the world will see Me no more; yet ye shall see Me, for I'll be with you, even in you, to the end of the world." Such a promise. Wonderful. All right.

L-25 Elijah, before he went away, he went and put the blessing upon Elisha to take his place. He went on. He said, "You starry--tarry here, I'm going up to Gilgal." And he said, "As the Lord liveth..." Now, he had the Spirit of God on him. He knew who that man was. He knew he had the truth, so Elisha begin to follow Elijah. And he went up to the city. He said, "You stay here. The Lord has sent me up to the school of the prophets." He said, "As the Lord liveth, and your soul liveth, I'll not leave you. I'm staying right with you." I like that. Stay right there. And he went on up to the school of the prophets and up to the seminary, otherwise, where all the graduates was. The Oxford and all, they were all there. They knowed a whole lot: yes, a whole lot. One of them went out to get a mess of peas, and he didn't know the difference between peas and wild gourds. He knowed a whole lot about leading something. Got his apron full of wild gourds and put them in, and was feeding a bunch of preachers with it. That's way the seminaries does yet today: a bunch of wild gourds, feeding the preachers: some kind of a theo--(Excuse me, I oughtn't to say that maybe.)--some kind of a theology to indoctrinate them with them. And sometimes they go out of the seminaries knowing less about God than when they did when they went in. That's right.

L-26 I'd rather have an old fashion rail fence experience out there, some boy--man with my boy out there, if he didn't even know his ABC's, take him out in the broom sedge patch somewhere and kneel by him by a stump and pray him through to God, than all the seminary D.D.'s could be produced in all the universities of the world. Amen. That's a big mouthful, but, brother, it's the truth. And what the church needs tonight is something to base yourself upon, where you know where you're standing. Education's fine, but it's the biggest hindrance the Gospel ever had: sent more souls to hell than anything else I know of: education. Get so smart you think you know more than God. You leave no 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min room for God. Now, I'm not trying to support my ignorance; I'm just simply stating what's fact.

L-27 Went up to the school of prophets, and when he got this big pot cooked up (You know?), and all full there, they's cooking up something; they had something cooked up all right. They got it today, cooked up too, but "There's death in the pot," he said. That's right. "Death in the pot." But look, in the amazing grace (Here it is.), the grace of God, there happened to be a real prophet standing by who said, "Go get me a handful of meal." And he took the meal and throwed it into the pot and said, "Now there's life. Go to eating." What made the difference between death and life was the meal. Now, any of you teachers know here that meal, was from the meal offering; which the meal offering was Christ. The little burrs had to be set just so perfect till every grain had to be ground the same. Every little parcel of that meal had to be the same. So they dipped up a handful of Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever, and throwed it into death and it become life. See? Ground the same, means that there from death to life, from sickness to health, He was the Healer in the meal. Amen. And He's still the Healer. Throwed it in there, said, "Now eat all you want to; it's good now. It's got life in it." Meal offering... Beautifully.

L-28 Then they went on from the school of prophets, and went down to the river Jordan, said, "Stay here because I'm going over." He said, "I'm not going to leave you. I'm going right with you." He had an alternative. He wanted something. And if you want to get something from God, stay right with it. If the pastor says it's not so, stay right with it. God said so. The pastor says, "Divine healing, there is no such a thing." Stay right with God's Word. God said so. The pastor says, "The baptism of the Holy Ghost is not for this day." Stay right with God; He said so: "Whosoever believeth." He...

L-29 "Repent every one of you," said Peter in Acts 2:38: "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost; for the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to them that's far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." If he ever took that back, it's not written in the Scripture. All right. As many as the Lord shall call is a candidate for the Holy Spirit.

L-30 Quickly, look now; we'll go quickly to it because my time is getting away, about six minutes. Watch. Now, when he crossed Jordan, and he--then he said, "What will you that I do for you?" He said, "If... I want a double portion of your Spirit." People's afraid to ask for a big thing. Well, this man's been crippled for a long time, Brother Branham; you think he could be healed?" Well, that's a easy thing to ask for. No more for God to heal that man, is somebody with a toothache. It's just the same to Him. Ask for a big thing that your joys may be full. Ask abundantly. Then He said, "Well, now, you've asked a great thing; but nevertheless, if you see me when I go, it'll be as you've asked."

L-31 So could you imagine how that preacher watched that Elijah? Look: perfectly type of the Church. Look, when they started the first journey was when they come out of the dark ages in Luther's age. The second stage of the journey, the school of the prophets was John Wesley's age, the second great revival. The third stage at Jordan was the Pentecostal age now. Then the next stage is across Jordan when the supernatural takes place. Here we are entering into it. Now, Elijah, he kept his eyes right on Elijah--Elisha did. And when he--the chariot come down and he was taken up, he dropped his robe, and Elisha put this robe upon himself, went forward, opened up the Red Sea--or the Jordan, crossed over: a perfect picture (Look.), Christ when He was taken up the church received a double portion of the Spirit that was on Him.

L-32 One woman said one time, "Can my son set at the right hand and the left hand?": John and them mother. He said, "Can you drink the cup that I drink?" Said, "Yes." "Can you be baptized with the baptism that I'm baptized with?" She said, "Yes." Said, "Truly, you shall." Watch. "These things that I do, greater than this shall you do." Double portion of the Spirit on the church today. 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min And Elijah done eight miracles in his life; Elisha done sixteen miracles in his life. And you people, who claim to have the Holy Spirit and then afraid to trust God for the supernatural; I don't understand it. I cannot understand it how that a double portion of the blessing is on the church, and we're afraid to move. What's the matter with you, friend? I'm kindy wondering.

L-33 Then, here was the prophet that was setting in the wilderness. Here goes Ahab and Jehoshaphat right down to him--ro--rode in on their horses, or whatever it was and stopped. The prophet was probably in there couldn't be disturbed for a while because he was studying. In come these three men kings and stood before him. Oh, my, they got very religious then. They were standing before the prophet. When you stand before our Prophet, Jesus Christ, you'll feel like you're very religious also. When He once comes upon you, He changes your attitude.

L-34 There they stood before the prophet, and he kinda got his righteous indignation up, to you holiness people. To you Calvinistic, you Presbyterian, and Baptist, he just plainly got angry. That's all. All right. Oh, he got all stirred up. He looked over at Jehoram; he said, "Why don't you go down to your own cold, formal church? Get some of your preachers down there to ask this for you." Oh, he really got his dandruff up. Said, "Why don't you go down to your mother's prophets and your daddy's prophets?" Yeah, kindly a half way border lined... "Why don't you go down to your own church?" Said, "Why'd you come here?" And he said, "Nay. But the Lord has called us out here together." And Elisha with his dandruff all up, he said, "If it wasn't that I respected the presence of Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't even look at you." Oh, my, he really got out of humor, didn't he? Now, when he did he got, was all, a place like that, he's in no condition for the Spirit to come on him. But he said, "Bring me a minstrel." Now, to you people that don't believe in playing music in the church, I wonder what you going to do with that.

L-35 Here he come, said, "Bring me a minstrel. Go get out there in all the soldiers and see who can play the harp, and play the stringed instruments, and everything, and get in here, play 'Old Time Religion,' for me, or something." So he'd get in here, and they got in there, and they all begin to play, maybe "Only Believe" or something on that order. Of course, they didn't have that song then, but something on that order. And this prophet, I can see him setting there, start to humming and patting his foot after a while. He's getting in the Spirit. That's what's the matter with the church tonight. That's what's the matter with this meeting tonight. If you can't get in the Spirit, you don't see nothing. Elijah couldn't see something, till he got in the Spirit of it. Amen. "Amen" means "so be it." You have to get into the Spirit of it before you can see It.

L-36 Now, you people that used to go to dances--I don't believe you'd do it now, since you're a Christian. But when you used to, you used to have to play all the music, and carrying on and everything, and get in the spirit of dancing. When you went to ball games, you had to--somebody had to hit a home run 'fore you throwed the hats and screamed and hollered. Well, it was all right for you then. But a fellow didn't believe much in ball games, he just stood there, he couldn't see nothing in it. He wasn't in the spirit of it. And that's the reason you come around to an old fashion meeting where they got good salvation, they go to hollering, "Amen" and "Praise The Lord," you say, "That bunch of fanatics." You're just not in the spirit of it; that's all. See? If this is the Holy Spirit, then that other must be unholy spirit. This makes you do holy things, that makes you do unholy things.

L-37 Woman said one time, said, "Billy, I understand that you got some of that new kind of religion." I said, "What kind's that?" She said, "Oh, you know, them people that shout and going on like that." I said, "A new kind? Why," I said, "that's the only kind, and the oldest religion there is." "Oh," she said, "Why, we never--used to never hear about that." "Why," I said, "About God spoke to Job one day, and He said, 'Job, where was you when I laid the foundations of the 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min world? Tell me what they're fastened onto?' Said, 'When the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy...'" A hundred million years before the world was ever formed, they had shouting religion. Amen. Then talk about something new. Why, it's the oldest there is, and the only kind there really is. Yeah, it's old fashion, heartfelt, sky blue, sin killing religion. Brother, it don't whitewash you; it washes you white from the inside out. Yes, it does. Make you do things you didn't think you ever would do.

L-38 All right. He got to playing the music, got to going; he got in the Spirit. When he got in the Spirit, he begin to see things. That's what we need tonight: to get in the Spirit of it. Get in the Spirit. You say, "Oh, Brother Branham..." Well, that's what they did on the day of Pentecost. They all stayed there and prayed till they got in the Spirit, and then got filled with the Holy Ghost, and run out and act like a bunch of drunk people. The religious people of the world stood and said, "These men and women..." (all of them together, which virgin Mary and all of them was together) said, "they are drunk on new wine." That's right. They got in the Spirit. That's what we need. That's what some of these churches around Louisville, and Jeffersonville, and New Albany need, is a good old fashion, shaking down, God sent, Holy Ghost revival. Then you can have healing services and decent and in order. God will bless and the altars will be full and--and... You don't need some new theology; you need the Holy Spirit preached in Its power, though in simplicity. It's the greatest drawing card the world's ever had. Amen.

L-39 Think of John the Baptist, how he shook the regions around about, just a simple old fuzzy faced preacher. That's right. But, brother, he knowed where he was standing. That's right. 'Cause the Holy Spirit talked to him in the wilderness and anointed him. When he was eight years old or nine, he went out into the wilderness and he got his bachelor's degree from God. And when he come out, he knowed what he was talking about. His bachelor's degree? Yes, he received the Holy Ghost 'fore he was born. Three months before he was born he got the Holy Ghost and shouted and jumped in his mother's womb. Amen. That's what the Scripture says: Luke 2. See?

L-40 All right. Notice. And here they was all having--Elisha was getting in the Spirit. Then the visions begin to come on him. Now, he said, "THUS SAITH THE LORD: go out and start digging some ditches, getting ready for a whole lot of water." Said, "You ain't going to see no clouds; you ain't going to hear no wind. You ain't going have no degrees, and you ain't going to go to no seminary; but you're going to get some water." That's what we need tonight. All right. You don't have to join some organization; you don't have to join some church; but you're going to get some water. Start out to digging. Now, I can see them get started to digging. And some fellow hit the ground a couple of times, say, "Say, this is rough going." "Well, if you quit digging, you ain't going to get no water. 'Cause every man had to dig his own spring."

L-41 Right in the desert, right in the midst of the sand where there's not a drop of water anywhere, the prophet said, "Start digging." And right in the place where you think it's the worst, there's where God's asked you to start digging. May be right in your own home; start digging. May be right in your own church; start digging. After while, I can see one of them hit a great big old tin can down there. "What is this?" That's old sister so-and-so says, "There is no such a thing as divine healing?" Kick it out; make room for water. Keep on digging. After while, you hit an old greasy skillet down there. That might be the pastor; kick it out. Don't believe in Divine healing, the power of God. Get room in there so you can get some more water. The deeper you dig, the more water you'll have. Get all the old doubt and unbelief and things away from you, that when the shower begins to come down through the valley, you'll get a big portion of it. You just got a little well like that, that's all you can have.

L-42 I like to go plumb over my head, don't you? Just get out there to where you can swim in it. The goodness of God... Get all the old kettles and things out of the way and... Some of you people say, "Well, now, if I get saved, what will I have to do?" Well, you got saved, went over and got the Holy Spirit; the first thing you know you dug down and say, "Ten percent in the church." Oh, my. Throw it out of the way. Get room for more water; just keep on digging. Make a big well, 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min where God can really baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fix you right.

L-43 Now, look, He said, "You're not going to see any clouds." You won't have to have a Billy Graham in the country. You won't have to do this, that, or the other. You won't have to have any new theology. But you're going to get water anyhow. Where did that water come from? It ain't going to rain out of the heavens; it ain't going to be artificially made. But there's going to be water there through the supernatural. Why was it? I tell what I think. Do you know the children of Israel passed right through that same wilderness? Sure did. And that Rock that was in the wilderness when they passed by was still there. Listen, Jesus Christ was in this church last night. And He's still the same Christ tonight. Just get to digging. Get all the doubt out of your way. Get all the superstitions out of the way. Quit saying the--being a spiritualist. Quit saying that it's of the devil. Throw the thing out of way and let's get to digging and get ready. Speak to the Rock and It'll bring forth Its waters then.

L-44 Next day when the invasions come down, they started down; they ambushed them; and when they went back into their land, according to the law, the Word of the Lord through the prophet, they marred all their good places, tore down the cities, chopped down the tree, and took up rocks and stopped up every well. What a revival. That's what we need tonight. We need to dig all those old doubts out of your heart: all these old things that take somebody else's word besides God's Word. Let God be true and every man's word a lie. What God said here, God confirms here. What Jesus Christ was then, He is now. He rose from the dead then and worked among the Apostles, and promised to do it till the end of the age; and He's the same Jesus tonight that He was then. So get all the tin cans and thing out of the well, and get a testimony in your hand; you'll stop up some of these old formal wells around here that don't believe in Divine healing and the power of God.

L-45 Mar every place; go right in and give a testimony and say, "Look at me. I've got a doctor's statement here, to where he couldn't do no more for me with cancer. Here I am with the same the doctor pronounced well." Brother, that'll stop up the old formal well. That's exactly right. Get a testimony. Serve the Lord. God bless you.

L-46 Tonight, may the Lord Jesus Christ, the One, that supernatural Rock that was there to give water in the desert... That same One that Elijah got into the Spirit and saw Him, and He spoke to him in a vision and told him what would take place, it did. That same Lord Jesus lives right here in this church tonight. I believe He rose from the dead, don't you? If you believe that... And He said that He would manifest Hisself through His church, the very same things that He did... You know what He did. He didn't claim to be a Healer nor nothing. He just claimed that He seen visions. He could look out in the audience, and if somebody would touch Him by faith, He'd turn around, say, "Who touched Me?" He'd look around till He seen the person and say, "Thy faith has saved thee."

L-47 They begin to reason in their hearts. He said certain things to them. He seen the woman at the well that had five husbands. He said, "Now, here you got five husbands?" Philip come in the prayer line; He said, "You're a believer." He said, "How did You know it?" Said, "Before you come, you was under a tree praying; I saw you." He said, "You're the Son of God, the King of Israel." Jesus said, "These things that I do, shall you do. I'll be with you, even in you, to the end of the world." Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today and forever.

L-48 Now, Christian friends, excuse these chopped up words. But look. Right down to the moment now, I'm contending for this: that Jesus rose from the dead and confirms His Word; and we're living in the last days, at the blossoming of the church flower, or the church wheat. And now that the same Lord Jesus has come into His church... I'll admit we have a lot of fanaticisms about it. We have a lot of fanaticism in Divine healing. But my brother, did you only know that that makes the real power of God shine the brighter? If there's a bogus dollar, it shows there's a real dollar it was made off of. And there is genuine people who believe God for their healing and are healed. There's no man can heal another man. That's not... That's... No there... Any one tells you that he's unscriptural [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?... He can't do that. The only thing... 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min No preacher can save a man. No priest can save a man. No one can forgive your sins, 'less you sinned against them individually. But they can't forgive your sins in general. You... They can point you to where your sins has been forgiven. Jesus forgive every sinner that ever was or ever will be, when He died at Calvary. But now, it'll never do you no good until you accept that sacrifice. And there where He was wounded for our transgressions, with His stripes we were healed...

L-49 Now, all that God can do for you towards your healing, He's already done it, and put it in the Word here. "Whatsoever things you desire, when you pray, believe you receive it, and you shall have it." Whatsoever, for healing, if it's for finance, if it's for what, show a just cause. If you say, "Lord, I've sinned. I'm sorry. If You'll forgive me, I'll promise You tonight, that I'll live for You the rest of my days," God's under obligation to His Word. If you sinned and will ask God to forgive you, He has already done it. You just accept Jesus as your personal Saviour. Accept Him as your Healer. Accept what God has done.

L-50 Now, He sends preachers to preach the Word: Brother Cauble and the other ministers. He sends teachers to teach the Word: set the church in order: spiritual teachers. Is that right? Then He sends prophets to foresee, and know things, and tell things to vindicate His coming and His--what His work is. Then He send people that... Some people in the church has the gift of speaking in tongues. I know you may think it's fanatically. And there probably is a lot it, but there's a real one too. Some people to speak in tongues and some to interpret... And that message will be to somebody in the church which will absolutely stand up and know that it's true. Paul said, "When you come together, if every one speaks in tongues, won't the unbeliever say that you're mad? But if one prophesies and reveals the secret of the heart, won't they all fall down and say, "God is with you?" See? See what I mean?

L-51 If the one there who's a prophet, who will know the secret thing... For instance, somebody standing there that's sinned, he'd call it out and tell them so. Or the man that--or the woman that's sick, looks very healthy, say, "Here's what's in your life. You're a Christian, but you have certain-certain things; you've been at a certain place." Then the Bible said, normal people would fall down and say, "Truly God is with you." 'Course, critics and so forth that's born to be condemned, they can't say it, because they're condemned in the beginning. They was conde--condemned from the beginning of the world. They will never see it. They can't see it. The Bible said, "Men of old foreordained to this condemnation..." That's right. They could never see it. Esau and Jacob, both of them born from the same mother, same father, and God taken one and rejected the other one before they were born: God's election. So brother, if you're on the critical side of the Scripture and the workings of the Holy Spirit, and the Bible said, "In the last days that men would be--how they would be having a form of godliness, go to church and be just as pious in religion, but would deny the power thereof, from such turn away." He said. Sure. 'Cause that is the same thing that, just like Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses.

L-52 Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we thank Thee tonight for the Lord Jesus and His lovely Being. Standing here looking around over this audience, and feeling the Holy Spirit strike me, saying, "Quieten down now," the time has come perhaps for Him to speak Himself. Then I shall close off, Father, leave my sermon go. And I pray that You'll speak Yourself now, Lord; and may this poor, unworthy man, just be so completely yielded to the Spirit of God, until the Holy Spirit will stand here and take the body, and the lips and speak with His own voice and a vindicate to this little audience tonight, that the Lord Jesus has rose from the dead, and is living among us tonight, proving this by signs and wonders of His life, doing the same things that He did when He was here on earth. He said, "I can do nothing except the Father shows Me first." Grant, Lord, that the Father will come and show us the church tonight. And we love His Words where He said, "A little while and the world will see Me no more." That's the unbeliever. "They won't see Me no more; yet you shall see Me," (the unbeliever) "For I'll be with you, even in you to the end of the world." Father, placed here is a group of handkerchiefs. I ask that You'll bless them, Lord, to the sick and the needy. May the 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min blessed Holy Spirit that's now here around this platform, beginning to move in to this circle... Believing that You'll show us great signs and wonders, that when we leave tonight, we'll say like those coming from Emmaus, "Did not our hearts burn within us?" from the way You do things. Grant the healing of these people and the blessings upon Thy church and Thy people. For now I submit myself to You, that You will speak and confirm these things that has been said. For I ask it in the Name of Your beloved Child Jesus Christ. Send forth His wonderful arms; stretch it out to heal the sick tonight. Amen.

L-53 What number of card did you...? [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] My ministry's not like some of the brothers who goes and lays his hands on the sick, and everybody prays for each individual. I... My ministry just... Perhaps after I return from Africa and overseas this time, I may never have no more... It's leaning that way very strong towards me, in America, to leave off healing services; just congregational prayer (See?), and have evangelistic services: like come set up a big tent. I just got one in order the other day, seats fifteen thousand people: chairs and everything. Like to set it out here in Louisville and stay for three months. See? And just stay till God says it's enough, it's over. See? And now, and just preach the Gospel, 'cause I've been across America time after time after time after ways, been everywhere in the meetings around; and the Lord has confirmed till all--every state in the Union, Canada and Mexico knows all about it. See? So now, and just when I preach the Gospel now of salvation for a while, maybe have a healing service once or twice a week, like Wednesday and Sunday or something, but otherwise...

L-54 Now, the ministry that the Lord has given me is to see visions. How many believes that He said, "In the last days He'd pour our His Spirit upon all flesh and your young men would see visions"? Let's see... and just... He promised it. And they would prophesy, foretell. And now watch, He said, "When He (now, no disregarding to you, my Christian Science people: 'The Holy Spirit is a thought.' 'He' is a personal pronoun.) "When He the Holy Ghost has come, He will teach you those things--or bring these things to your remembrance which I have taught unto you, and will show you things to come." Is that right? The Holy Spirit. You couldn't believe in the Holy Spirit and disbelieve in visions. You couldn't, because it's the very work of the Holy Spirit.

L-55 Now, when our Lord Jesus was here on earth... Just a moment now. When He was here on earth, the only things that He did--only miracles, only signs that He did, was when God gave Him a vision and showed Him what to do. That right? Saint John 5:19, He said, when He passed through all those crippled people, and blind, withered, and halt, didn't heal any, and healed a man laying over here with prostate trouble, or diabetes, or something. And they questioned Him. Why, He said, "Verily, verily I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in Himself; but what He sees the Father doing, that doeth the Son; for the Father worketh..." In other words, let me put it in our words here: "The only thing He says that I can do is what I see by vision My Father doing. Then I go act it out in drama in obedience to My Father. I do just as My Father has bid Me to do. He tells Me there's somebody down here on the road that's sick. He told Me Lazarus was going to die, to leave the country and be gone three days. After three days, Lazarus would die. And then I'd be on My road back and would get there on the fourth day and for Me to go to the grave and to raise him up" That's exactly what He done.

L-56 He went right away. When Lazarus got sick, they sent... He ... Then after the third day, He said, "Lazarus sleepeth. He's dead. Now, for your sake, I'm glad I wasn't there, but I go wake him." Went down to the grave and said, 'Father, I thank Thee Thou as all--but for these who stands by I said it, 'Lazarus, come forth.'" And a man had been dead four days, skin worms done eaten into his body, corruption knew its master. And the spirit knew its Creator. And a man had been dead four days, stood on his feet and lived again, went to a banquet dinner with them. That's right. That was my Lord Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever.

L-57 Brother Branham, does He perform miracles like that today? He done it three times in His lifetime. And right here, if you'll read here's authentic statements, signed by great hands. I've seen it three times in my life, that the dead laid out dead, pronounced dead by the doctor and they're living today. That's right. What is it? Me? Not me, I'm just as you. But it's Him. See? It's Him, the resurrected One: Jesus Christ, the Lord God of heaven, His only beloved Son--begotten Son rather. All right. 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min

L-58 Now, as we're standing in the line... All right. Come. Now. Come, lady, on... I believe I know this woman. Now, you're Mrs. Collier, aren't you? I--I... McKannan. Excuse me. I was wrong. All right. All right. The Lord knows both of us, doesn't He? He knows us both. And now, there's something... I want you, sister, to believe the Lord Jesus, and I want to talk to you, 'cause that it happened to be that I have no way of knowing who's going to be up here on the platform, who's going to be first, 'cause that's by--by a prayer card. See? They just pass out a number. They give them to anybody wants them, and then when I come in, I just call for certains anywhere, and sometimes just come call a few here, and few from this number, and a few from that number, some place. Doesn't matter, just so they get here. Then those... Just as soon as I get the anointing on me, It goes right out through the audience, and begins to speak to those out there.

L-59 How many out there want to be healed tonight without prayer cards? Let's see your hand. All right. Just pray. Just ask God. See if He doesn't confirm it to be the absolute truth. God will grant it, if you'll just believe it. That's what you have to do. Have faith in God. Now, in talking to the lady... Now, for instance, what if our Lord was standing here and talking to her. The first thing He would do, like He did the woman at the well. He'd talk to her a few minutes. I wonder why Jesus waited and sent the disciples away, and waited there until that woman come, and then when He went to talking to her... When she first walked up and dropped the bucket down like that; what if He'd say, "Just a moment woman. Go get rid of your five husbands and you'll be all right." No, He didn't. He said, "Bring Me a drink." He felt the Spirit move on Him, of course. He said, "Bring Me a drink." And it wasn't customary for that even to happen, for Him to talk to a Samaritan. She said, "Why, the well's deep and so forth." And they got to talking... Then what was He doing? Now, this is between the lines, friends. That's the reason they re--failed to recognize Jesus Christ when He come. They'd read the Scriptures about it, but they failed to recognize Him. And it's the same thing today; we got our own ritualistic routine. Anything out of that, we don't believe it. Fundamental as we can be, but God comes right in between the lines sometimes. We fail to see it. Now, He was contacting her spirit.

L-60 Now, the woman... God in heaven knows I know nothing about the woman, no more than I've seen her. I've seen her. I'm pretty sure... Is she a member here at your church, Brother Cauble? Well, I'm still wrong. I thought I'd seen her here at the church or something. I... But maybe I'm all mixed up. All right. If... Sometimes when I get... When the Spirit... When that gets... The anointing begins to come near, well, then I... Even my people could stand before me, hardly, and I wouldn't recognize them. Now, you may think that that's fanaticism. But it isn't. Now, now, He is here: the One that you got the picture of, the Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel. I say that in the Name of the Lord. And now, in the Name of Jesus Christ, I take every spirit here under my control for God's glory, for the healing of the sick, delivering from evil spirits. And God be merciful to critics and to unbelievers is my prayer.

L-61 Now, lady, look this way now just a minute. Now, if you are sick, it would be impossible for me to heal you. I'm a man. But your life, you could not hide it if you had to now. It's going to be open, 'cause this is His Spirit, not me, Him. But you're... The one thing is wrong with you, you have arthritis. And another thing, you're got a extremely nervous condition. You can't sleep at night: menopause. And you got someone that's away from you, that's dear to you. I--I--It's a kindy towards the... It's not here in the building. They're away from here; your mind travels. Oh, it's in New York. And that's a daughter. And it's some sort of a--a spiritual trouble she's troubled with. Isn't that right? Just a moment; it's left me. Yes. Was that the truth? Come here. Kind heavenly Father, in Thy lovely goodness and mercy, send Thy blessings upon this woman, who I bless in Thy Name, and may everything that she has need of and has asked for, I pray that You will deliver it to her. And now, while Your Spirit is here, and she is--recognizes this, I lay my hands upon her in obedience to God's Word. The last Word from Jesus' lips, said, "If they lay hands on the sick, they shall recover." This I do, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, lady.

L-62 All right. Howdy do, sir? [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] You are sure that you're in contact with is not your brother. It's something in a spiritual realm. Isn't that true? Now, that very same fire that's on that picture that the mechanical eye of 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min the camera caught, is right now moving between me and you. Being in another dimension, or another world, I see It and you feel It. Now, if that's true, raise up you hand. Then if that is the Holy Spirit, and now being in another world, and yet knowing there's somebody in front of me, fading and moving around, then God is able to make known to me what is your trouble, or what you're desiring. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled. And that's what you're doing tonight, is seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost. There was something. Just a moment. It flashes back to me. I see... No, it's a woman. It's--it's--it's your wife. Yes, it's your--your wife. She's sick too. Now, there's something strange there. Just a moment. God, may He grant it to me. Oh, she doesn't know just what's wrong with her. Uh-huh. She doesn't go to doctors. Will you take this to her for me? Go lay your hands on her in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ; she'll be made well. You shall receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. God, grant this to my brother. May these things that I've ask be so for God's glory. Amen.

L-63 How do you do? I suppose that we are strangers to each other. We are? But we're not strangers before our Maker. Now, He's left me. It's out over the audience. Every one reverent; be in prayer. It hangs over a woman that's blond-headed, and the woman is praying. She's blond-headed; and she wears glasses and she's holding to her chest. Yes, that's her setting right there. Your faith has healed you, sister. God bless you; your troubles are gone now. Have faith in God. Don't doubt. Just believe. All things are possible to them that believe. You're trying hard, sir, setting there with your hand up like this against your head. You believe God healed you of that prostate trouble? You do? Stand up to your feet then. Be made well; may the Lord Jesus grant it to you; in Jesus Christ's Name. Have faith in God. Don't doubt; just believe with all your heart, you shall have what you ask for.

L-64 You're the patient, aren't you? ...?... All right. You believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, you're in His Presence, not your brother? You're here in His Presence. Well, if I be God's servant, and I told the truth, then this would be God preaching back the truth, not my sermon now. It's His sermon. Then if you was standing here and He was visible, that you could see Him, as far as--if it was healing you was looking for, He couldn't heal you; He's already done it. He'd only tell you something that'd make you have faith. Is that right? Well, you just answer me as I talk to you then. I'm--only thing I'm trying to do is contact your spirit. It's very hard; there's others here praying, trying their best around everywhere. See? Now, that's right. I see like blood dripping between me and you: thinning, watering. You're anemia. Isn't that right? And you're... I see you're interested in somebody. It's a--it's a husband, isn't it? Yes, sir. And he has something wrong with his kidneys. Pus on the kidneys, I believe the doctor said: pus on the kidneys. And then you got a--a sister, and she's in a dying condition with cancer. Those things are true. Ever what it was He said, that wasn't me; that was Him. Now, if that was truth, and you know whether it was or not, then what I'd say now will have to be true. Is that right? Jesus Christ done all the healing and delivering nineteen hundred years ago for them. You believe that? You want your husband to get right with God too, don't you? He's a sinner and you want him to accept Christ, as I see it turn black around the man. Now, go and may the Lord grant it to you; just as you believe, so be it.

L-65 Only have faith. Is the only thing I ask you to do is to believe: believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, rose from the dead and's here. A woman touched His garment one time, and He turned around, said, "Who touched Me." And He looked around to the woman, said, "Thy faith has saved thee. Your blood issue's gone now." And she felt, in her own body that it'd stopped like that. Now, if Jesus has raised from the dead and are--and is here tonight, your faith can touch Him. Not me, I don't know you. But your faith can touch Him, Who's preaching now through me. Not me now, it's Him. It was me awhile ago, now it's Him. Any man can say anything, don't have to be true. But when somebody says something and God turns around and says, "That's the truth," you--it's sin to disbelieve it. What is sin? Unbelief. He that believeth not is condemned already. Go ye and sin no more, or a worse thing come... Go ye and disbelieve no more or a worse thing will come upon you. For that unclean spirit will return with seven other devils, says the Scripture. And your wor--last end will be worse than the first. 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min

L-66 You touched Him, lady, for your side condition, setting there. Yes. Your faith has healed you of that side trouble you had. Stand up on your feet; accept your healing (God bless you.), just as a testimony that you're healed. The Lord bless you, sister. You want to get over that bronchial condition you're praying about too, lady? All right, stand up to your feet and say, "I accept it, in the Name of the Lord Jesus." Go home now and get well. There He stands in the corner. Oh, looks like, if every eye look that way, seems you could see that. It's holding over a lady; oh, that's got something wrong with her head. She's setting right behind that lady there. You want to get over that, lady? All right. The little lady, look like, got a red coat on, gray hair, she's wearing glasses, having trouble with her head. Stand up on your feet, lady. Your faith has touched the hem of His garment. He knows you. Go home and be well. I couldn't see you had a red coat; only in the vision, I seen it was a red coat. You was blinded from me. I can just see the top of your head. Amen. Praise be to God. You... Now. No, this is not a stage show. Stop thinking that. God will condemn you for it. Your thoughts come in here. He knows what you're saying, what you're thinking. How is He speaking to these people, if it isn't?

L-67 Come sir. Look and live. Believe with all your heart. What are you thinking, sir? You're praying that I'll say something to you. Isn't that right? That's right. If God will tell me what's your trouble, will you accept your healing? You're real nervous and upset, especially, like to the bathroom and so forth. Many times when you're upset is caused from a prostate trouble you had. Isn't that right? If that's right, raise up your hand. I never seen you in my life. Uh-huh. You believe your wife there will be healed too? You believe with all you heart? You have arthritis, don't you? If that's right, raise up your hand. Seems to be an interest in that child, setting there too? You believe for the child, that little boy? You believe, young man? You do? When Jesus was here, He'd make you whole. Do you believe that? You're sick. You suffer, don't you, honey? You're in need of prayer. You believe Brother Branham to be God's Prophet, or His servant? You believe with all your heart? If God will reveal to me what's wrong with you, honey, will you believe the tea--the Christ that the teacher in Sunday school tells about will make you well? You have rectal trouble, isn't it, honey? Rectal condition. Now, stand up on your little feet there. Jesus Christ healed you, honey. Go home and be made well.

L-68 Have faith. Stop praying, mister, setting there; He heard you. You had trouble with your neck, didn't you? If that's right, stand on your feet. Shake your head around. Move your head around. It's all gone from you. Your neck's is just as limber and nice as it can be. He heard you and healed your prayer. Amen. The Lord Jesus Christ, the resurrected Son of God stands in your midst. He's here to heal the sick, declaring that I told you the truth. I'm just His servant, but He's told--I've told the truth. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. These people here are strangers to me. And they're strangers in other countries, and other languages, and everything. Doesn't stop a bit. The vision moves just the same.

L-69 How do you do? This your patient here? All right. I suppose we're strangers, sir, to each other. I don't know you and never seen you in my life. We're total strangers then (Is that right?), don't know one another. But one thing, sir, God knows both of us, and we're going to have to give an account at the day of judgment for our life. You believe that? Come here, just a little closer. I want you to look at me just a moment, like I--preaching tonight; as Elisha said, "If it wasn't for the presence of Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't look towards you or see you." Now, it laid into the prophet. He couldn't know what God was going to do, but he could only look and see what God was going to do and then pronounce it. Is that right? Well, what was that on that man, that prophet? He died like an ordinary man; he lived like an ordinary man, a Christian man; but there was something different about him. Is that right? He was a prophet. He was anointed of the Spirit and that Spirit of--was of God. Is that right? That Spirit did not die. It stills lives. Elijah died, but the Spirit still lives. Is that right? You believe that you're standing in His Presence now? God bless you. Then I can help you. You're not from here. You're a stranger here. You're from a--a city that starts with like F-r-a... Franklin, is it--Franklin, Ohio, is where you're from. That right? You were kinda shook for a moment. I just want to see that. You're suffering 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min with some sort of a--a... It's a rectal or a fistula, the doctor says: fistula trouble: a growth on the--at the rectum. Got a wife, yes, she's with diabetes. When you go, lay hands on her and she'll get well too. God Almighty Who rose up Jesus Christ, bless the people and bring these things to pass; in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you. As you believe, so will it be.

L-70 All right. Do you believe? I couldn't do nothing but pray for you. Your trouble is your eye and it's tumor on your eye. You believe God will make you well? Come here. Christ Jesus, Son of God, I ask blessings for this woman, and ask that she go in peace, and may the spirit that's in those growths, may it leave tonight, and may the woman be well. May they shrink away. For I now ask God's blessing for this purpose; in Jesus Christ's Name, His Son. Amen. All right. You were healed while you were setting there. Something come over you while... Is that right? You were healed then. Just be on your road rejoicing, thanking God. Amen.

L-71 Come, lady. You believe me to be God's servant? And if I be God's servant, I'll be able to help you if you believe me. For it's just your attitude of approach will determine what you get. Some of them... When He would tell the people in the audience what was wrong with them or so forth, they would--they believed Him; the woman that touched Him. But the one that put a rag around His head and hit Him with a stick, and said, "Now tell me who hit you, if you know all things," they didn't feel nothing. They didn't approach it right. Just the way you approach it. Is that right? I can tell you now: it's not for you; for the child. For I see the child standing here in front of me. And the child is serious enough sick till it's been to a doctor. Yes. Not only that, but the child is up for surgery now. And I see the doctor looking in its nose; it's its nose condition: got a little thing in his nose a looking. And now, he--it's the breath that shut off in one side of its nose. It can't breath out of one side of its nose. Are those things true, lady? You heard what was said. Now, that wasn't me; that was Him. Now, do you believe for the child? Bring him to me. Dear heavenly Father, as I hold this darling little baby here, knowing that surgery lays before the little thing, I pray for Your mercy to protect the child. Grant it, Lord. I lay my hands upon it now, and You--when You were here You laid Your hands upon the children and blessed them. And I do likewise tonight. May Your Spirit, Lord Jesus, come through the body of Your servant, as a transmitter, into this child, and condemn this darkness that hangs over the child; and may it fade away, and may the bright sunlight of God come upon the child and be made whole. I condemn this disease, in Jesus Christ's Name. Mouth, now breathe out your mouth. Breathe. Can you breathe? Now, breathe out of this side. Can you breathe? The child could not breathe out the side of its nose. Now breathe, honey. Shut your little mouth. Now, shut and breathe over here. Breathing all right? It's okay? Feels good? Jesus has healed you, honey. God bless you, honey. God bless you, sister. Your faith has saved the child.

L-72 You believe the heart trouble left you, while you was setting there? It did. Just keep going and saying, "Praise be to God." All right. And you had the same thing, didn't you? Just keep going. Jesus Christ makes you whole. All right. Come. Pretty sick, aren't you, sir? Nothing can help you but God. That... Death lays near your gate is that demon that's holding you of cancer, but God can make you well. Do you believe that? Almighty God, I condemn the enemy that's on this man's body, and may he go and be made well, and live for God's glory. In Jesus' Name, His Son, I ask this. Amen. God bless you, sir. Don't doubt a bit; it'll leave you and you'll get perfectly normal and well. You believe it? Amen. All right, God bless you now. Go and the peace of God be upon you. Come. You believe, lady, with all your heart? You notice how the man's walking when he left here? Stumbling, limping, coming up, there he goes back walking normally. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.

L-73 One thing that I can't understand, and that is how people that profess to be Christians, can see the working of Jesus Christ, and hold their peace. I--I can't... Not as I'm wanting you to glorify nothing in the building; I'm wanting you to say, "Oh, God, how thankful we are that our religion is not false." 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min How could you accept signs and wonders, say that your religion's no more than Mohammedans? The Mohammedans has all the psychology; the teaching their own bible. So does Buddha, so does all the other gods, they had their teaching, their bibles. They had everything else rejoicing, but let one of them produce the resurrection and power one time. This proves Christianity is the truth, proves that then if these things are true, Christianity, unbelievers are condemned to doom to die without repentance. So, every sinner, repent of your sins. Oh, you may go to church, but if you're not a believer, one hundred percent, the baptism of the Holy Spirit resting on you, then you get right with God tonight.

L-74 Your kidney trouble left you, mother, while you were standing here, so you can go home now and, praising God and get well. God bless you. Now, just praise the Lord. That's all you'll have to do. Praise be to God. You think I'm excited? But I'm not. This whole building... I realize... Someone ask me--wrote me a little note and said, "What made me rub at my face all the time." I can't tell you all things, but my lips get thick. My tongue... Stand up here; go through it once and find out why you'll feel after. When you go into a place, you don't even... Well, amen. You just believe it. That's all I ask you to do is believe it.

L-75 Come, sir. I see you're limping. That's not, your li... Is what your trouble is, you want to get over that stomach trouble, is what you're wanting. Well, go eat your supper and the Lord bless you. Go eat--just eat--you can go, and be as well as you want. All right. Come, lady. What you ask, that's what you'll get. All right. Amen. You want to get over your kidney trouble? Back trouble? Go home? Go in the Name of The Lord Jesus and be made well. Come believing. Come with all your heart. I believe I'll see the day when Jesus Christ will restore normal legs, take away artificial. I never--He never done it in the Bible, but I believe we're going to receive greater things than that. Amen. I believe it with all my heart. Amen.

L-76 Oh, His love, His grace, how it moves through the people. How wonderful. How matchless. How I adore Him. How He's the Fairest of ten thousand, the Great Alpha, Omega, the resurrected Lord Jesus, Who shall come with ten thousands of His saints to magnify the little flock, to redeem them up into glory with Him. He, the most lovely One, stands in our midst tonight with His arms stretched forth, saying, "Whosoever Will, let him come and drink from the fountains of the waters of life." I adore Him, the matchless One. Let every one be in reverence to Him, let him sing praises to the King of king, and the Lord of lords. May His Name forever stand, of whom heavens and earth is named after. The whole families of creation is called "Jesus." Blessed be His Name. Oh, how wonderful.

L-77 Your stomach trouble's gone, sir. Go eat your supper. Now, do it. You've had nervousness, prostate trouble, and things that run you into that, but you're healed. Blessed be the Name of the Lord. Praise God from Whom all blessings flow. (I don't know what's the matter with me.) Praise Him all creatures here below; Praise Him above, ye heavenly host; Praise Father, Son, Holy Ghost. All dominions and all ages shall bow before Him. Every tongue shall confess to Him being the Son of the living God. All ages shall know that He's God. Hallelujah. Praise be to Him forever and ever. My soul magnifies Him. My spirit lifts above this faltering world, soars into places that the world knows nothing of. Oh, how Jesus, how it hasteth the hour when Jesus no longer I see. Sweet...?... sweet music, sweet flower: all lose their beauty when He comes into existence. The whole world becomes of love. All creation worships Him. The trees clap their hands to Him. The mountains lift up their heads and rejoice. All creatures of the earth give Him glory. Praise be to His majesty, the King of king, which now stands near. Beyond doubt, beyond shadows, beyond anything else, every superstition, every thought, every feeble thing leaves now. How can death exist in the presence of life? It cannot. The holy One of God. His goodness... Don't think I'm beside myself. I am not. The Holy Spirit is here at the platform. He thrills my soul. He chills every nerve in me now. Though sweat's dropping off of my hand, the power of His living Being is now here. How can sickness or diseases exist in His Presence? 54-0403, The Hand Of The Lord Came Upon Him, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 94 min

L-78 Lady, rise to your feet. That anemia condition has left you. Go home. Every man and woman in here that would like to be healed, can rise to your feet and believe Him Who is present now. This anointing that you're now receiving is the Holy Ghost. For a closing service, may He fall upon this audience. Give vent to your feelings; He's here, the King of king, the Lord of lords, the Prince of Peace, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Alpha Omega, the Beginning and the End. Come out of the people, Satan; you can't exist in the Presence of God; in Jesus Christ... Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
