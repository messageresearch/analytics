--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 ...clock of the resurrection... Shall we stand now while we...?... bow our heads now for prayer. Our heavenly Father, we come to Thee as if Thou are early in the morning, as the disciples came to the tomb to find it empty, the great Conqueror had rose from the dead. We gather here this morning for the purpose of worshipping Him, singing out the glad tidings around the world today, that Jesus arose from the dead. We thank You for His great Life and for His great approval that You put upon Him that He was the Son of God. As He said in the days while He was alive: "Destroy this temple and I'll raise it up again in three days." We thank Thee for this, that You gave Him power to fulfill what He said He would do. As we gather here this morning, around in the little tabernacle to--to sing our praises to Thee for Thy great work, many of us visited the grave this morning and find, setting the flowers, thinking of our loved ones, and the time that when we placed their bodies beneath the sod. Then by faith we look across the sea yonder to Joseph's tomb: empty, Joseph of Arimathaea. He arose from the grave. And our loved ones who sleep in Him, shall arise too, some glorious morning. There will be a real Easter to all of us someday, who are Thy followers. Forgive us of our sins now. And bless us and keep us ever close and faithful. For we ask it in Christ's Name. Amen.
