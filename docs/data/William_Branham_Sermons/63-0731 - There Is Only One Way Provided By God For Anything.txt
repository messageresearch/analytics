--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Thank God, Brother Carlson. Really nice, and--and the Lord bless you. Good evening, friends. Now, before we sit down, let's just speak to the great King that we're all here to worship.

L-2 Our Heavenly Father, we are grateful for the opportunity to be back again in this great city, Chicago, to be assembled here with those who are waiting for the Coming of the Lord Jesus. And we pray, Father, as our efforts has been put forth, in both the man and women, boys and girls, to see a revival or stirring, maybe to call in a few more that's left out in the city. May this be that great time that when the last will be called in before the judgment strikes this country. Father, we believe that there is still more waiting, and we're hunting for them. Send them in, this time, Father. Grant it, that they might receive Christ, and be numbered among those elected that will be taken away in a great Rapture that lays in the future. Grant it, Lord.

L-3 These efforts that we put forth, and has been put forth by our Brother Carlson and all of them here, that, this place that they have converted from an old whiskey house and a wrestling arena, unto a house of the Lord. Lord, may it be a memorial and a representation of the conversion of sinners, to Christ.

L-4 Hear us, Father, in these things, healing the sick and doing these great things that we ask, for it's in the Name of Jesus Christ, and for His honor and glory, we ask it. Amen. You may be seated. Thank you, very much.

L-5 It's always a privilege to come to Chicago. I've always felt that way. I haven't been here for sometime, because I don't live here no more, I--I live in Arizona, in Tucson. And we're here in Jeffersonville, on the summer's vacation, and I leave here on Monday morning. And as soon as I arrive home, things are waiting me to go back to Tucson again.

L-6 And, but, I'm here making tapes, Messages that I send away on tapes. And the Lord has been blessing us. Sunday morning we had a four-hour Message. I don't expect to do that here. But four hours on the threefold revelation of Jesus Christ being the... God's hidden secret from the foundation of the world. And the Lord certainly blessed us. We've had great blessings, and God has healed the sick among us.

L-7 A few, about three weeks ago, while I was speaking, a man standing before us, his... He is an Englishman. His wife is Norwegian. And she is a very fine nurse, and he a very fine man. And so, the man, I was speaking of a complexes. And the man kind of resented it, when I said it. And I told him a couple years ago, when I first met him, that, "He was bothered with a murmur in his heart." He hardly wanted to believe that, I think, at first, and then finally the doctor told him he had the murmur in his heart. And that morning he had kind of been a little tore up. And when I said that, he resented it, and quickly dropped dead, right on the floor, fell out in the floor. And his wife got down to examine him, and he was gone.

L-8 And I had to quieten the audience, and then step off the platform, got down to where he was, took his pulse. There was no pulse. And his eyes... You know, when the heart stops, the eyes flies backwards. And tried to pull his eyes, seen him in that condition, and knew he was gone. And the Lord Jesus said, "Speak." And I said, "Lord Jesus, give him back his life." He looked up at me, said, "Brother Branham."

L-9 And he is alive, tonight, and he'll probably attend this meeting. He has been attending them right along. And he will, probably. I don't see him here tonight. Mr. Way, are you here? I--I don't... Why, sitting right here in front of me. Yeah, yeah, right here in front of me. I didn't know that. And now here he is tonight, very healthy. Would you just stand up so the people can see that God can raise the dead, now come back? And his wife, a fine Norwegian nurse. Praising the Lord! [Congregation applauds--Ed.] 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min

L-10 Is your lovely little wife with you? [Brother Way says, "No, she is attending that sick person, Brother Branham."] She has gone to attend for the... attend to the sick. His wife is a very lovely person who tries to take care of the sick. That's in her heart. She nurses, constantly. And she is attending the... some of the sick in the back now. And so we're so grateful to the Lord.

L-11 Now, I, coming in, heard Brother Vayle speak just before me. And I'll try each night to get out real early, as early as I possibly can. And I'll be praying for the sick, and just as the Lord will lead; and asking God to bless Brother Carlson and all the group here, in Chicago, that's waiting for the Coming of the Lord.

L-12 Maybe a little later on in the week, I might tell you a vision I had this morning, little after daylight, just as I started to come up here, concerning this; and maybe sometime when I get a little more time during the week, the Lord willing.

L-13 Now, how many is here that's never been in one of the meetings before, let's see your hands, that's never been in one of the meetings. Well, well, we're happy to have you here in this little tabernacle, tonight, and in this arena, where I think it was once used for wrestling (wasn't it?) or boxing, and so forth.

L-14 I remember I preached here, not long ago, in Vincennes, Indiana... Evansville, Indiana, rather, where I went into Golden Gloves, as a--a kid. Then I got to fight in professional fights, as a boy, and I won fifteen straight professional fights. And I lost one, and that was by a draw in Evansville, Indiana. And in the same arena, where I had fought this man, I went back preaching the Gospel. I said, "Now I'm fighting, not my brother, but the devil that's been binding my brother." That's...

L-15 And so here we are tonight, and the place is converted from trying to bind one another by wrestling knots, and trying to tie the devil in such a knot, by the Scripture, he can't get out of it until he takes the count. That's right. And now we pray that the Lord will help us do this.

L-16 Just again now, would there be any, just before we read the Word, like to be remembered in prayer? Just raise your hands. I know it's hot in here tonight, that's the reason we'll hurry.

L-17 And, remember, come back tomorrow night. And that's Wednesday night, Thursday night, Friday night. And I think, Saturday morning, I seen it on the list, for a Business Men's breakfast, Saturday morning. Saturday night, at Lane Tech High School. And Sunday, Sunday afternoon and Sunday night, here. Let us...

L-18 What? [A brother says, "Kind of speak more into this mike."--Ed.] Into this? All right. ["This one right here."] Yes. Can you hear that better? [Congregation says, "Yes."] Is that? That's fine. All right, sir, I'll remember to stand to this side. Now let's bow our heads.

L-19 Now, Heavenly Father, as we approaching this hour, where man and women has to make a choice, we realize that we'll not be able to go out of this building the same as we come in. We can never enter the House of the Lord, and go out the same; we go better or worse. Grant, Lord, that we can go out, tonight, better than we was coming in.

L-20 And these few words, and these texts, Scriptures that I have written down here for a little Message, tonight, may it be to the honor of Christ. May His people, in hearing It, receive faith, for truly we believe we're living in the last hours of the last day. The sun has been setting for quite a while. God's long-suffering has held it up. It's the shadows are gathering now. And we pray, God, that You'll let us realize this more than ever before in life.

L-21 Bless those people who raised their hands. Forgive our sins. Give us faith in Thy Word and the Coming of Thy Son. For we ask it in His Name and for His glory. Amen.

L-22 [Someone says, "And they asked if you would pray. There is a lady in the back, she was very, very sick, and has fainted."--Ed.] Just a moment. There is a lady way back in the back, that's fainted, I believe it is, and she is sick. Let us just pray.

L-23 Heavenly Father, in the Name of Jesus Thy Son, may the power that raised that young man that night, that sit all night long, listening to Paul preach, may the same power that raised him up to health again, may it do likewise for this our sister who fainted, perhaps because of the heat, and is back there sick. Let the Holy Spirit, Lord, of Life, come 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min upon her and strengthen her mortal life. Grant this, Lord. We commit it to You now, in the Name of Jesus Christ Thy Son. Amen.

L-24 Let me hear from you. If it gets worse, I'll go back and see her.

L-25 Now over in the Book of Saint John, the 12th chapter and the 32nd verse, I wish to read for a little portion of Scripture, just in the way of make a text, to build a context. And I do see that it's difficult for you to hear me, I can tell the way you're acting, a rebound in--in the building, and I'll try to speak just as plain as I can. I want to read this text, Jesus speaking: Then I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all man unto me.

L-26 I want to take this for a text: There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything. One way God has provided to meet everything. Now, any other way, besides this way, would be a perverted way, to God's. God can only have one way to do anything. His first way is always the only way that He can ever do it. For, God, making a choice or a decision, must forever remain with that decision. And if He changes that decision, for a better way, then it shows that God is not God, He is not infinite, He found something better than He knew at the first place. He, He doesn't change. He makes His ways perfect. His Words are perfect. And any way that takes away, or adds to, anything that God has provided, is wrong.

L-27 I believe, in the last Book of the Bible, called the Revelation, it's written, "If any man shall add one word, or take a Word from It, his same, his part will be taken from the Book of Life."

L-28 And now, therefore, God has made a way, and a perfect way, and we must walk right with it, not trying to make It any better, not trying to take anything away from It, inject anything, or take anything from It. We must take It just the way that God has placed It. Anything else is wrong.

L-29 Even in the Book of Genesis, the beginning, God said, in Genesis 1, talking about nature. He said, "Let every seed bring forth of its kind." Every seed must keep in its kind. Now, to change that, would be to do something God said not to do.

L-30 And now we find out, and now look at man, what he has done by crossing God's way of life. We want to take this for a background, to say what I want to say to you about the Lord Jesus. See, when man... When God made a seed, He made it perfect, and now man has tried to inject something to that seed.

L-31 For instance, today, coming up, I noticed in southern Indiana, and all up through Indiana, and along, there were, what we said, "hybrid corn." And what a fine big ear that corn is, but it isn't any good. It looks better, but it isn't better. It's absolutely no good at all.

L-32 And we find out, that by hybriding chickens, we find it. Did you every try to eat fried chicken in these days? Well, you can't hardly do it. It--it smells and tastes just like, I mean, it tastes like a chicken smelled. So what is it? There is eight hundred people laying sick in Jeffersonville, Louisville and New Albany, now, from eating eggs from hybrid chickens. See, they've taken the chicken and breed it different ways.

L-33 And then, another thing, they are getting to a place where they spray with this mosquito stuff, and get this DDT. The chickens and animals pick that up.

L-34 We are certainly living in the last day. They are breeding different things together, crossing over, and it makes a--a--a product that's no good.

L-35 Through doing this, I was reading in a medical journal, I believe it was, and then in Reader's Digest, of how that it's changed the course of life for people. It's even perverting man and women, that man are becoming more like women, and women like man. Men are becoming a--a sissy, and--and women are becoming masculine. It's hybrid stuff. You see, that cell that we eat from this animal that's hybrid, is actually not the right cell for us. Therefore, in doing that, see, that cell from the animal, or the cell from the wheat, or from the corn, it's not the right cell.

L-36 In order to let this grow, look like bigger, it has to be sprayed all the time.

L-37 Now, a genuine plant, a good healthy plant, does not have to be sprayed at all. No bugs will bother it, because it 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min has a repellent, itself, that it puts out, that keeps all the bugs off of it. Now, that's God's way.

L-38 What brought sickness into the world was sin. When man dropped away from God's provided way, he opened himself to every devil there was, to sickness, and so forth. Because, he has to keep medicine, and sprayed, and it's just each generation in-breeding into another. Now you might be a Christian, and your wife might be a Christian; but the genes of your body is still the inheritance from your father and your grandfather, and on down. As Daniel said, "Each generation will get weaker and wiser." And it's got the whole race, the whole human race, dying.

L-39 Just think, a few years ago, you never heard of anybody getting hurt playing baseball. Now they have to use a helmet, to bat with, they kill so many every year. You hit the man, he is so soft, he is like a guinea pig, he just dies right now. And you notice, again, they used to...

L-40 Like this boxing, I believe it was Bob Fitzsimmons and Corbett, fought a hundred and twenty-five rounds. Now two to ten rounds, and then you have to work on them for a month to get them back to life again. And then they fought bare-fisted, and now we got a feather-bed around our--our hands when we fight. And now they're going to have to stop the game, is because every time you hit one, it nearly kills him. See? And you see, you, it's...

L-41 And the whole race is gone. There is not a hope left. Everything is at its end: cattle, corn, everything.

L-42 Now, you cannot take a plant that's been planted, and hybrid it into something, to bring it back again and plant it, it will not do it. It will not reproduce itself. It can't. Because, God's Commandment still stands the same, "Every seed must bring forth of its kind." And if it isn't, it's a hybrid seed with a perverted life, and it'll soon die. You plant a hybrid corn, it'll get up just about to where the ear should set in, it'll turn yellow and go back.

L-43 Now that's the same way that they have did it through animals. They've did it through seeds. They've did it through everything else.

L-44 And they've did it in the church. It's try to make a prettier church, a better place, a--a beautiful thing, great things. They've hybrid it, by mixing it with some kind of man-made doctrines, and so forth, and it gets up to the Word, where It could reproduce itself again, and dies again. See? And there's... You just simply...

L-45 There is one way to do anything, and that's God's way. And outside of that, it's all off, because it will not reproduce itself again. I got Scriptures for these things, to prove that it's to be here in the last days.

L-46 When I heard that egg situation the other day, I went back in my book where the Lord spoke to me in 1931, and there I had written in my book, "In the last days, warn the people not to eat eggs or live in a valley." And, see, not know what fallout and things would be, see, but yet the Lord forewarned that, way back thirty years ago, see, "Not to live in a valley, in the last days," and, "Don't eat eggs," everything will be poisoned. See? And that's just what's happened. Now imagine that, thirty something years ago.

L-47 God's Word is the seed. Jesus said so, that, "The Word of God was a Seed that a sower sowed." And This is the only Seed that will produce Eternal Life. Now we can have all other kinds of lifes, but life... church life, home life, family life, national life. But the only Eternal Life comes through God's Word. That's--that's the only Seed that can produce Eternal Life. And now they are trying to, they interbreed This with creed, put some creed, some denominational sticker or something on It. And what they have did, by doing this, it's got the church to a place till it grows up to a place to where it ought to be receiving the Seed, the real Word, and it's a hybrid condition, it'll fall back to its denominational teaching, and leave the real Word of God alone.

L-48 Therefore, we are at the end time. There is not one hope left. We cannot build upon this nation. This nation is based upon politics. Politics is finished. They're... It's just as corrupt as it can be. When you...

L-49 Did you read Life magazine, where this attorney, or--or this judge, his son, a boy? He was so hard on racing these Rickies, and so forth, out here, these hot rods. And his boy killed a big bunch of people, a little--a little boy, little baby boy, and a bunch. And the judge set him free. All a political play-up!

L-50 See, national life is gone. Natural botany life is gone. It's so interbred and everything till it has not life in it. Human life is a constant mess. 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min

L-51 And spiritual life is at the lowest ebb it's ever been. See? See, there, it's so hybrid. Everything bred in and added something to it, to make it better this a way. I tell you, even to our Pentecostal moves; when, we used to go down in old barrooms like this, and places.

L-52 I was converted in a converted barroom. And I feel very much at home now. I look back there and see that counter, and so forth. It was a little, colored church, where I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, was led there by the Lord.

L-53 Now, to see these kind of places, they--they don't want to. They got to have the big flowery name behind it. It's got to have so much behind it, or people won't. It's got to be so pretty, outwardly, until if it--it isn't that way, then the people don't want nothing to do with it.

L-54 But watch the Word of the Lord! Now, God has got a way of doing things, and we must do it in the way that He wants it done. If it isn't, then it's not effective. Jesus found something like it, when He come in His day. He said, "You, by your traditions, has made the--the Word of God of none effect, by your traditions." See, they had hybred into, injected into God's Commandments their own traditions, which made the Commandments of no effect.

L-55 Today, I know it's become the same thing. There is not a thing left, my Christian friend, but the Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's the only hope that the church has. As far as it comes, if it ever takes up a denomination again, it's finished, because every denomination finished when it become a denomination. It's the very thing...

L-56 I'll say something here, maybe I oughtn't to say, but yet I believe I ought to say it.

L-57 If you noticed, Lucifer is exactly doing the same thing, today, that he did at the beginning. See? Lucifer, at the beginning, wanted to build himself a kingdom which was greater and more beautiful than Michael's kingdom, Christ. He, that was his ambitions, to achieve something like that. And what did he get to do it by? He took fallen angels who had lost their first estate. He took that to do it with.

L-58 And, today, Lucifer has got into the church, and taken away the Word, and injected denomination. And he is building a church, the ecumenical move that's going on now, to unite all the protestants together, and altogether come into Catholic. And this pope they got in now, to do the same thing, exactly what the Scripture said it would do. And what's he doing it by? He is doing it by man of those great ecumenical moves, who does not know God; and the many of them in the Pentecostals, 'cause they're doing the same. What is it? He is doing it with fallen angels, fallen Lutherans, fallen Methodists, fallen Pentecostals, and lost their original estate from the Word of God, and going right back in to make a great big ecumenical move. Fallen messengers, messengers who once stayed with the Word, but sold out their birthrights and joined in with the world. The same thing, it's at the last day. And their Lu-... And Lucifer is achieving today, by man with those spirits in them, that he did with angels at the beginning, fallen angels who kept not their first estate to obey God. And he is doing the same thing today.

L-59 Oh, you will never find any way, any way at all; I don't care if you're in a barroom, or you're on the street, or wherever you are. God's provided way for man, to come to Christ and receive Eternal Life. Jesus said, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, I'll draw all man unto Me." That's God's only way. "If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all man unto Me."

L-60 He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He said, in Saint John, the 14th chapter and the 12th verse, "He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also." God's provided way. Mark 16 said, "These signs shall follow them that believe. In My Name they shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. If they should take up serpents or drink deadly things, it wouldn't harm them. They'll lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover." The very things that Christ did! That's...

L-61 He was God's Word made manifest. He was God's promise, vindicated. He was. He was God in a flesh form. The Bible said that, "God was in Christ." That great Jehovah that created heavens and earth, was made manifest in a body, the Lord Jesus. And in that one Man, He could achieve. Till... He tried it through Moses, and He did it in Jacob, and He did it in Joseph. But He come in His fullness, in the Man Christ, He was the fullness of the Godhead bodily, where God could express Himself. And He said, "Who can accuse Me of sin? Sin is 'unbelief.' If I haven't done exactly what the Scripture said I would do, then who can condemn Me and say where I failed in one way?" See, it's God's provided way. 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min

L-62 And Christ, the Just One, had to die in order to produce Eternal Life by His Blood, giving His Blood cell, that He might give us Eternal Life. That's God's provided way.

L-63 There has never been anything that ever beat God's way on anything. I don't care what it is. If people would just don't try to inject their own ideas, but just take it the way God said it, believing It. See, it seems to be so hard for man just to get out of his own ideas, just he's got to have something to do into It, himself. He has always gaummed up, if you'd excuse the expression, he has always gaummed up God's way for him, by injecting his own way into It.

L-64 Have they ever, do you think they could find a better way for a chicken to be born, than to peck its way out of the shell? I just wonder if you could find any better way. No, sir. He is born with a little pip on the end of his little bill. And every time his little head nods back and forth, "Amen, Amen, Amen," he scratches that shell till he scratches hisself out. Yes, sir. You will never find a better way, because that is God's provided way.

L-65 Now, what if he had the little pip on his bill, and you said, "Poor little chicky; you know, I'm going to get a better way for you, I'm just going to crack the shell and pick you out"? It would kill him. That's right. He would die. He wouldn't live.

L-66 He has got to do that in order to build his strength enough to receive the air and things when he comes out. If he... He is provided with a tool. He has got that little pip. You've seen it, little birds and chickens. And as he nods his little head, he scratches that egg back and forth until he peeps his way out.

L-67 If you'll take that as an example, or in a way of making a point, that's God's way for Christians to be born. Not walk up to the altar and give a man your right hand, and put your name on the book. But get down there and peep and cry and beg and plead until God gives you strength, then you come forth out of the shell of the world.

L-68 If somebody, pastor, just cracks the shell and takes you out, say, "Oh, well, that's all right, we'll take you in anyhow," you're dead. That's all there is to it.

L-69 You've got to come God's provided way. And that's the way the rest of them had to come, by being born of the Spirit of God. Stay there until! How long? Until! He told them first groups of pentecostals to "tarry in the city of Jerusalem, until." Don't make any difference, one day, five days, nine days, or whatever it was, stay there until they are filled with the Spirit, till they're born again.

L-70 Ducks and geese, they have never found a way for ducks and geese to--to get ready to come South, from the North here, than God's provided way for them to swarm. Some time ago, I had a great lesson on that. I was down in Texas, and I noticed, we was going down a road, and traffic was stopped for most a half a mile. And I said to some of them, "What's the matter?" He said, "The geese is all across the road."

L-71 Well, finally, when I got up there, you couldn't hear yourself think. They were having a revival. They were all getting ready for a flight. They were going home, going up North to their house, where they could raise some little ones. And they were having a revival, swarming, before going.

L-72 Now, that's God's provided way, a swarm, all of them get together. One was way over here, and one way over there, and one way over somewhere else, one in one rice paddy, and one in a wheat field; but something another, some way, on a certain day, (I don't know why, how), but on a certain day, here they all come together, just looked like something drawed them. We call it "instinct." It's a God-given instinct, a gettogether before the flight.

L-73 You see what God is trying to do now? Pull His Church from one side to the other, to get the revival, old-time revival like the geese has always done.

L-74 Now what if they tried another way, said, "Well, now we'll just take it another way"? They would never get there. No, sir. What if you'd say, "Well, now I'll tell you what, we'll make a better way for them. We'll herd them all into a coop and take them up in a coop, put them in a little chicken coop, or make it a duck coop or a goose coop, or whatever, you want to do it, and put them into that and then take them up there"? You think that would be a better way, say, "Oh, we can give them... Oh, I tell you, we could feed them better, along the road"? No, you couldn't. 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min

L-75 There is such grain that's in the ponds and in the fields, weeds and things that they have to get, in order to give them strength to be what they are when they get there. They, if they didn't get that, they wouldn't be... they couldn't raise their young ones. They wouldn't be genuine ducks. They would be hybrids like we are, you see, if they had to take that. But God has got a way of--of doing it.

L-76 Put them in a coop, you know what them ducks would know right now? Put them in a denomination like that, they knowed that they were ready for the slaughter. That's all. That's what you do when you put them together in a coop, they're going for the slaughter. The ducks got better sense than we got, on that. When you go to cooping them all up together in a man-made prison, well, then, you see, the duck knows he hasn't got his freedom to fly in the air, and do as God provided for him to do. And put him in a coop, then he--he is gone. That's all. You coop them when they're slaughtering. And the duck knows better. We ought to know.

L-77 Neither can you choose them a better route to go. Route, if you want to call it, up here, I think. Down home, in the South, it's still route, but up here I think they call it a route. Do you think, if you could say, "Now listen, I'll tell you what you ought to do. You ought to go back a certain way and come down another way, and down over this way." Do you think you could choose a better way for them to go, than God's provided way for them to go? Well, you would get them in some kind of a--a something, you would draw them across here with some magnetic or something. They would never... You would draw them through storms, and through everything else, half of them would be lost.

L-78 Well, you can't give them a better way. They, they go God's provided way. They can scent those storms, miles away, and know how to ground themselves and get ready for the storm, and rise again. God has got a provided way for them, and they got duck sense enough to follow God's provided way. We don't. We try to make a better way than God made for us. See, we want to have something into it, ourself. A duck don't pay no attention to what; he just goes the way God wants him to go, the way his ancestors did, the way his great-great-great-great-great-grandmother did, and on like that.

L-79 If we would just take our ancestry on back, to Pentecost, we'd know how to get there. God had a provided way, by His Word and by His Holy Spirit. But we want to go some other way that Doctor So-and-so said, or a certain group of man got together and said. That's way off of God's provided way. The church sailed good in God's provided way, to the council at Nicaea, Rome, and there is where they made their fatal mistake. What if you could take...

L-80 And now you think about finding them a better way, or could you find them a better leader than God's provided leader for them? Now maybe you would take an old gander out here somewhere, and take him out there and feed him on certain vitamins, and so forth, and give him a special call, you know. Send him out there, and put a little honker on his mouth, that you might have a--a--a melody that he could almost yodel with that, and you might write it up in all the papers, "A--a duck that can yodel. And, oh, all the ducks is bound to find him. He'll know which way to take them, because he is really cultured and educated, and he is fixed up. He can do it." You might... He might set out there and yodel, all afternoon, there would never be a duck come around him.

L-81 "My sheep know My Voice, a stranger they will not follow."

L-82 He might sound prettier. He might have better wings. He, might be fed better. He might be a better cultured duck. He might be able to do the twist or anything, out there. You couldn't tell what he could do. But I'm telling you, the ducks would never follow him if he didn't give that certain sound that was right. That's right. Ducks know their leader, by a God-given sound, a God-given instinct. And you will never be able to get one any better than that, 'cause that's God's actual provided way for them.

L-83 And notice, again, if you had trained an old goose or a duck, to take that group, you would probably take him out in the hold of the shotguns, where people are watching for him. But, you know, this God-provided leader takes him to God's provided place where He has got for him. He takes him right straight, why, to Louisiana, and down into the rice paddies where they're protected, the rest of the year. Why, certainly. God knows what to do, and the duck knows to do what God wants him to do, or provided for him. Notice.

L-84 Could you think you could invent a better provided instrument than what God has got for him? Now, that little 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min duck never left the pond. He was born up there in the north woods. He never was off the pond, in his life, but somehow he sails right up. Can go east, west, north, south, whichever way he wants to go; but something constrains him to go right straight south, tells him how to by-pass the cold spells, the storms and everything, and get out of it, right where the food is. God has an instrument in that duck, that leads him just exactly right. And they've never been able to find any better way for him (no, sir) than God's provided way.

L-85 They, they have never been able to find a better way for a baby to get what he wants, than to cry for it. You might, you might tell him, "Well, he could--he could shake his little fist, or he could goo like that," but he'll never get the attention like crying. He has got to cry for it. That's all. You might say, "Well, now, I'll put my alarm clock on. And I've got to feed this baby at a certain time, so many minutes, to so many, much time I got to feed him." You turn that alarm clock on, and stick the bottle in his mouth, he'll goo and spit it out. Put the milk in his mouth, and he'll spit it out. It's not time yet. But God has got a provided way, He turns the little alarm clock on, down there, and, when it is, he ain't going to stop until he gets his bottle. That's all. He cries for it.

L-86 Now, God recommends this way, also, to His baby children, to cry, His believers to cry for what they want. That's right. Cry for Him, for Your needs.

L-87 Now, don't listen to intellectual speeches, somebody say, "Well, now I'll tell, this baptism of the Holy Spirit that they talk about, this Divine healing, and that kind of stuff, well, I tell you, it isn't, for it isn't today. I can explain It, that It's not for today." Listen, a real genuine baby of God won't pay no attention to that.

L-88 He will scream, and yell, and kick up his heels, until he gets a vindicated answer back from that promise out of God's Word, 'cause, "Man don't live by bread alone, but by every Word that comes out of the mouth of God, proceeds from the mouth of God." He cries and cries until that Word of promise is vindicated. God's little child living on the Word of God, there is not a better way in the world for him. That's all. He lives on what the Lord says for him to live by, and he stays there until it happens; cries, kicks up his heels, and just stays at it.

L-89 Some of them say, "Oh, you can't receive the Holy Ghost, there is no such a thing." They tried to tell us that years ago, that there was no such a thing as speaking with tongues, and prophecy, and all these great gifts that God promised in the early church, and gave to them. "Them days has passed."

L-90 You think that stopped that hungry-hearted people? They took a hold of this Word, and knowed that the Bible said He... "The promise is unto you, and to your children, and to them that's far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." They stayed there on their faces, and cried, and begged, and kicked up their heels, and screamed until God poured out the same Holy Ghost, upon them, that He did on them at the beginning. Amen. What is it? It's God's provided way. That's right. They believed it, and God provided the way for them. Peter give them the provided way on the Day of Pentecost.

L-91 Some of them says, "Shake hands, be sprinkled, come into the church, this is It, that's that." God has got to judge the church, the world, by something. If He is going to judge it by the church, which church will it be? If He judges it by the Catholic church, which Catholic church? If He judge it by the Romans, the Orthodox is lost. And if they judge it by the Orthodox, the Greek Orthodox, then the others are lost. If they judge it by the Baptist, the Methodist is lost. By the... Cause, you can't add one word, or take one from It. See? So, remember, one word disbelieved!

L-92 One word caused every heartache, every sickness, every death, and even the coming of the Lord Jesus to die to redeem us. Eve, she disbelieved, just reasoned with Satan, or Satan reasoned with her. "Well, that, honestly, God won't do it."

L-93 See, that's Lucifer's business today, say, "God can't turn us down. We're too big a people. We stand tens of thousands, millions strong. You think God could turn us down?" He, sure, He has already done it. When you reject His Word, you're on the other side. It isn't God turns you down; you've turned God down. That's where it's at. See? See?

L-94 You've got to take the Bread of Life. "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by..." A few of the words, a word every now and then? "By every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, man shall live by That." And this Scripture is written by the Holy Spirit, that's right, and the Holy Ghost is God. And, every, this man "moved, the hol-, 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min by the Holy Ghost," wrote this Bible. And I believe every Word of It is perfectly the Truth of God, and cannot be tampered with. And we'll be judged by this Book, at the end of the... of life's journey. Yes, sir.

L-95 I don't believe in intellectual speeches. I believe in the Word Itself, and then stay with that promise until it's made manifest and fulfilled, then you've got it. What? "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God."

L-96 I was just thinking the other day. The Bible said, that, "The sins of Sodom vexed the soul of Lot, daily." I just thought, how many Lot's is there in this United States! Man sitting in their study, good man, sitting in their study, looking out the window, and seeing these modern stripteases on the street, and carrying on, the way there. They can't say nothing about it. They know it's wrong. They can't say nothing, half their cong-... yeah, ninety percent of their congregation wear it. Bobbed-haired women, wearing shorts, man smoking cigarettes, taking sociable drinks, telling dirty jokes! They know better than to say that. If they do, their denominational headquarters, they stir up something like that, they're excommunicated from it. See, a modern Lot, of not the common audacity, not the real spiritual Truth within them, enough grace to stand, that will look upon sin, and can't call it out.

L-97 God, give us an Abraham that'll separate themselves from these things. Right. Oh, at the day that we are living! Yes, sir.

L-98 His Word is always the Truth, always the Truth. His believing children believe for it, and cry for it, until His Word is vindicated. And His Word is always His will. If you want to know what the will of God is, find it in the Bible. It's God's Word. Anything contrary to It, is perverted. And don't get into that hybrid condition. What God said, that's the Truth.

L-99 If somebody takes you, and say, "Now, I come into the church, and I tell you, we don't believe in receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We don't believe that. We believe that you actually, believe, when you believe, you receive the Holy Ghost."

L-100 Paul said, in Acts the 19th chapter, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" See? "Have you received the Holy Ghost?" "Well, how did you receive the Holy Ghost?" you said.

L-101 Peter said, on the Day of Pentecost, said, "Repent, every one of you, be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." That's what He said. "The promise is unto you, and to your children."

L-102 It's like people reading the prescription on a medicine bottle and won't take the medicine. What good does it do to read the prescription? Well, they go away to seminaries, and learn church history, and we learn ethics of the church, and learn what the Bible says, and all the Greek words, and we can tell you what it means; but that's just telling you what the bottle says, what the directions says. I can tell you what Peter said on the Day of Pentecost, I can tell that the promise is unto you, but you say, "I believe That." I can believe this medicine setting here for the disease is right, but, until I take it, I got to take it! See, the--the sincerity of it doesn't... Now you say, "I sincerely believe that. That's true." But you've got to take it. And when you take it, it shows the effects upon the patient. And when you take God's Word, it shows genuine Holy Ghost effects, by faith, Abraham's Seed. It does something to you. It takes a hold of you. It shakes the unbelief out of you, and sets your affections on things Above.

L-103 Where, Jesus said, "If I be lifted, I will draw all men unto Me." And He is the Word. "In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us." And the Word is still God. And if the Word be lifted up, and you receive It into your heart, It'll draw you to God. That's right, because It is God. Amen. Oh, how I love Him. The Word is always the Truth. Yes, sir. Never a better way than God's provided way!

L-104 There was a prophet, one time, by the name of Job. He needed, he--he needed some comfort. And he... his church members come, and condemning him, and saying, "Job, you know, you--you--you--you're just not right with God." And--and they condemned him. But he still needed a comforter. His wife couldn't even comfort him. She said, "Job, 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min you ought to curse God, and then die the death."

L-105 But he said, "Thou speakest like a foolish woman." And Job stayed with it until God provided for him a vision of Jesus Christ. Now do you believe that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-106 It said, when the vision come, he said, "I know my Redeemer liveth, and at the last days He'll stand upon the earth. And though the skin worms destroys this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God; whom I shall see for myself, mine eyes shall behold, another."

L-107 Now remember, the vision is, he saw Jesus. And Jesus is the Word. Then when Job needed a comforter, God sent him a vision of the Word. Amen. Whew!

L-108 That's the comfort I get, is reading the Word, believing the Word, what the Word says. Jesus said, "Let every man's word be a lie, and Mine be True." Don't care what someone else says. I--I respect what they say. But when it comes to believing, if it's contrary to God's Word, I don't believe it. I do not believe nothing but what God's Word said, for, "Man shall live by every Word that comes out of the mouth of God," not just so much of the Word. He said, "all the Word," the whole Bible through. "Man shall live by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God." Now, that's how man lives. That's God's provided way for him to live.

L-109 And Job was a prophet that lived even before the Bible was written. And notice, he was a prophet, and the Word of the Lord comes to the prophet. And then when he wanted comfort, he could find none. He went to his church, and his church didn't--didn't have any comfort for him, but accusation against him. But he stayed until God showed him the Word, by vision, and then he was comforted. And he stayed on his feet, and the lightnings flashed and the thunders roared. And he said, "Though the skin worms destroys this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. He talked to me. Let death or anything else strike me, it doesn't make a bit of difference, 'cause I'll see God. I saw the vision of His Word."

L-110 Israel, one day, they was in Egypt, down there in captivity. And they needed a way, they needed a way out of Egypt. And, notice, we find out that a man got trained, by the name of Moses. He was trained in all the military might, next Pharaoh to be, down in Egypt. He was trained in all the military might. He thought someday he would deliver His people. And he come out, this mighty man, mighty in word and deed, Moses. And he tried with his military might, but it wasn't God's provided way. He lacked something.

L-111 But one day when he was on the backside of the desert, what he lacked, the burning bush had. And Moses saw a vision of the Word, that was God. And when he did, the vision spoke the Word. "I remember My promise," amen, "to Abraham, Isaac, and to Jacob. And I remember I promised them, and I've come down to deliver them." Amen. Oh, my! Then, as I spoke the other night at the Tabernacle, Moses become a prisoner to God.

L-112 Unless God can get you, a prisoner! Paul become a prisoner See, you can't look at what you think, you can't look what somebody else thinks. You've got to go just what He says do. You're a prisoner.

L-113 Paul knew that he was pressed in the spirit to go a certain place, when he didn't want to go. He knowed that the Spirit forbid him to go certain places. He knowed he had to hold his peace at many times.

L-114 That little old fortuneteller run out after him one day, a hollering around behind him. And Paul, with that Spirit of God in him, wanted to rebuke it, and day after day. And finally he got the message, "Rebuke him," and he turned around. He couldn't do it till God said so. Amen.

L-115 Oh, if the church could only be so in the glorious Presence of God, someday God will turn loose His Power into It, things will take place. But you can't mix your diet; you'll become a hybrid. Stay exactly what God said. Stay right in the Word, and God will vindicate It to be the Truth. Yes, sir.

L-116 God provided Israel a way. He anointed a prophet, sent a Pillar of Fire, and vindicated the Word that the prophet spoke, by signs, by signs of creation. "Moses, go stretch your stick out over the sea, out towards the East, and say, 'Let there come flies.'" And Moses, a man with the Word of God, knowing that a man cannot create, he stuck his pole back towards the East, like that, and said, "Let there be flies all over Egypt." And flies, created, and come into existence by the word of a man. 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min

L-117 God uses a man for His instrument. He can only speak through man. "I am the vine, ye are the branches." That's right. He said...

L-118 There was no frogs. He said, "Moses, go out there and raise up thy stick, and call for frogs." That was God's commission to him.

L-119 And Moses say, "Now wait a minute, wait a minute, now maybe the days of that... I never did hear of such a thing as that. I better go a little easy"? He didn't have any intellectual denominations to tell him what to do.

L-120 He lived by the promise of God. He was a prisoner in the house of God. He could only go and do as the Spirit let him do it. Amen. And he raised up the stick, and spoke, and frogs come into existence. Sure.

L-121 They provided a lamb when they needed something for their sin. God's provided way made a lamb. God's provided way made a way across the Red Sea when they was in a trap. God's provided way provided them a prophet, provided them a Pillar of Fire to follow them, a vindication of the Word, a man proved of God, that what he said come to pass, showed him exactly what it was. And yet, when they crossed the sea, they wanted a law. See, that's just human beings. That's just the way man operates, he wants to inject his own ways.

L-122 Oh, God's provided way is always the way of sending His Word.

L-123 Death struck Egypt. He was going to kill everything in Egypt. Now remember, when the boils were breaking out, when the fire was falling, and when the rains come and the hail come, God provided a place for His elect not to get into that. He had a place called Goshen. Now there was coming a spirit of death upon the land. And every man, remember, death is the reason we die. And Israel had to have something to keep them from dying, or death would have struck them, too. Cause, the pen-, pen-... the wages of sin is death, and Israel had sinned. And God, so that they would not die, His people who were trying to follow Him, He provided a lamb, and a blood over a door, that protected their first-born. God's provided way. While, Egypt thought they could shut theirselves in, around all their great theologians and witch doctors, and whatever they had, the... and death angel swept right in over top of that, 'cause it was without blood.

L-124 And any religion today that hasn't got the Blood Life of Jesus Christ behind it, the death angel is on it; right, death angel, separated from God. Yes, indeedy, Ichabod is wrote on every bit of it that hasn't got the Blood. You say, "Well, I'm glad, the Blood!"

L-125 If the Blood hasn't taken effect, if it hasn't taken effect and you see it in your life, as a consecrated child of God, with what Jesus said would take place, then be careful, you might have something else besides the Blood. You might have a little injection of theology in there, or something, a little inject of some sensation. You say, "I quivered. I shook. I danced. I've did this." Be careful.

L-126 If the medicine ever stricks you, it's good for every human being. It'll save from sin. It'll clean up, from a life of sin. It'll make a different person out of you. It'll take the doubt away, and it'll make you a new creation in Christ Jesus. Amen.

L-127 Death struck Egypt. God separated a belief from unbelief, that day, by the--by the blood upon the door.

L-128 Moses, a faithful servant who followed every precept of God, when he come to a place he had to die. He was getting so old, a hundred and twenty years old, he had to die. He had no place to die. He didn't want to die down there with them murmurs and everything like that. God provided him a rock. Amen. He started climbing, till he got above all the unbelief, and God had a rock laying there. And he died on that rock, looking to the promised land.

L-129 That's the place. That rock is Christ Jesus, that points you to the promised land. You get on Him one time, and you'll see every promise of God is true. Absolutely. That's right. "If--if ye abide in Me, and My Word in you, then ask what you will and it'll be done for you." Cause, He is the Word. It just manifests Itself through you, when you abide in Him.

L-130 Notice, after he died, he was way up in the wilderness, he needed pallbearers. God provided Angels. Why? Because no man on this earth could take him where he was going. Had to take somebody to pack him over There, and took Angels along Home. 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min

L-131 Enoch needed a ladder, one day. He had walked five hundred years with God, and had pleased Him. He needed a ladder. God provided him a highway, walked right up Home.

L-132 Elijah needed a robe, one time, and God give him a chariot with horses to it. Oh, my!

L-133 Samson needed a spear, and God give him a jaw bone of a wild mule, and he beat down a thousand Philistines with it. God provides your needs. God has a way.

L-134 What if Sam--what if Samson said, "Now wait a minute. This jaw bone isn't sharp. It isn't a spear. Look at them big thick helmets on them Philistines"? He just took God's provided way, and beat right into it.

L-135 That's all you need, is to take what God says. And go to beating with it, just as hard as you can, you'll get yourself free after a while. Yes, sir. Yes.

L-136 Joshua needed a bridge. God provided a--a power, a flood gate, spiritual flood gate that held back Jordan, so he could go on and fulfill God's Word, the promise. He needed a bridge.

L-137 Daniel needed a fence, to keep the lions off of him. God give him an Angel. See, that's God's provided way. What needed, God provided, and God provided it in His Own way.

L-138 Now what if Daniel would have said, "Now wait a minute. I could think of a better way than that Pillar of Fire standing here before me now. That, that lion, might not have any effect upon him. He might come right on through that Pillar of Fire. If You'll just get me a great big fence and fence me in"? See, that would have been Daniel trying to do something.

L-139 But he just accepted God's provided way, laid down and went to sleep, and slept all night, just in peace. God provided a way. Yes, sir. Oh, my!

L-140 The Hebrew children needed some water, a fire hose down there, to put out all that fire when they jumped in there. But God provided them a fourth Man. Yes, sir. That's all they needed.

L-141 What if say, "Now wait a minute, just somebody else to go in there, that won't help. We got to have a fire hose to put all this out"?

L-142 They accepted God's provided way, and He kept the fire off of them. There wasn't even the smell of fire on them. They went God's provided way.

L-143 The wise men needed a compass to guide them to the new-born Babe, but God provided a Star. See? They took the Star. That's all they needed. The world needed a Saviour. God provided a Son. Amen.

L-144 The church needed power. God provided the Holy Ghost. He didn't provide a book of ethics. He didn't provide a Christian government. He provided the Holy Ghost. That's what God provided. He never said, "Go up there and study up at Jerusalem up there, until I get a certain amount of education in you, till I in-documate you, and so-and-so." He said, "Wait until you're endued with Power from on High. After the Holy Ghost has come upon you, then you shall be My witnesses in Jerusalem, Samaria, in Chicago, Illinois, and so forth, see, all the world." That is God's provided witness, is the Holy Ghost. God didn't provide a book of ethics. He did not provide a denomination. They said, "We want to become full Christians."

L-145 "Well, now you wait till you study so long, wait till you learn the creeds"? He never said learn anything. He said, "Wait till you're filled." Amen.

L-146 Someone said the other day, said, "Why, Mr. Branham, don't you believe in denominations?"

L-147 I said, "I got nothing against the people in them, but I certainly don't believe in their systems." He said, "Well, why? How would we pay? What will we do?" I said, "That wasn't God's provided way in the first place." He said, "What denomination do you belong to?" 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min I said, "None." Said, "What do you belong to?" I said, "A Kingdom." Said, "How do you get in There?" I said, "You are born in It." Amen.

L-148 You are born into the Kingdom of God. How? By the Holy Ghost. That's God's witness. He gives witness by the Word of God, that we've passed from death unto Life, because we are in the Kingdom of God. That's God's.

L-149 God needed a leader for the Church. He didn't educate a bishop, neither did He send a high priest or a pope, or no one else. But He sent the Holy Ghost. A man die, and their systems die, and everything else. But the Holy Ghost is the Eternal God, and He cannot die. He give them an Eternal Leader, and that is the Holy Ghost. They needed something to guide them, to tell them what to do, how to live, how to meet the public, how to meet the fierceness of the day, how to combat sickness, how to combat this, how to combat sin. Man has drawed all kinds of ways of joining this, and creeds of this, and documents of this, and baptisms of this, and every kind of sensations, and little quivers and funny feelings, and everything else. But still remains, the Holy Ghost is God's provided way for His Church. Amen.

L-150 And the Holy Ghost is God, and God is the Word. The Holy Ghost is this Word made full vindicated. The Holy Ghost is the thing that brings this promised Word to life.

L-151 You say, "I've had a feeling." If it don't vindicate this Word, forget that feeling. Yes, sir.

L-152 They say, "Well, I've done this. I've done that. And I've been baptized this way, that way."

L-153 I don't care what you've been done. If the Holy Ghost is on you, this Word is vindicated through you. Because, Jesus said, "These signs shall follow them that believe; to all the world, and every creature." Amen. God's provided way!

L-154 Two thousand years! That went all right for about three hundred years, then they had a council meeting one time, at Nicaea, Rome, and they wanted to inject something. Then after Martin Luther, another angel of God brought forth the message, then they had another injection. And then after John Wesley, they had another injection. And they just so forth, a council meeting, until they got this place, until the churches has become hybrid by the ethics of man's teaching, and there's a great falling away now.

L-155 The church needs a Scriptural sign, Truth, in this last days. It needs something.

L-156 Look at the different denominations, the twistings; as we close now, before we have the prayer line. Look at the twistings of the Scripture. Think of our different denominations. Think of our Pentecostal ways. Think of our Baptist, our Presbyterian, our Lutheran, even to our Independents, whatever more. A fellow don't know where to stand.

L-157 The church needs, today, a Scriptural vindication. What did Jesus say in Saint John, the 14th chapter and the 12th verse? "He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also. The very things that I do shall he do also." Notice, He promised, "As it was in the days of Jonas, the prophet, so shall it be at the coming of the Son of man." See? He said, "For as Jonas was in the belly of the whale, three days and nights, and was raised up as was from the dead, that will be a sign to a wicked and adulterous, generation."

L-158 Now we are living in the last days, with a promised sign of the resurrection. After two thousand years of in-documenting and drawing off the road, and this way, and that way, till people don't know what to do. But Jesus told them, and promised them, "As it was in the days of Lot and Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man."

L-159 Compare it today. Take Genesis 6, and look what He said; how that "renown man," how "women would get pretty." We got the prettiest group of women that ever was on earth, since that time. Women are much prettier than they was years ago. They got so many different things to make them pretty. So many different paints and powders and fixes and hair-do's and everything, and immoral clothes and things, till they make them attractive.

L-160 A man come to me yesterday, he said, "I got a boy, sixteen, Brother Branham. I got a boy, twelve. I take them on the street, these little stripteases out here." He said, "The boys, they're little males," he said, "what can I tell them?" 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min

L-161 I said, "Sir, I don't know. Take them to Christ, and let them get saved and filled with the Holy Ghost, and they'll turn their heads to them modern stripteases."

L-162 Remember, when the sons of God looked upon the daughters of man and seen they were fair, they took unto them women, took unto them women. Look over here at this great scandal in England, look through the United States, look at these call girls in the U.N., everything else, oh, it's just terrible. And that's it, man "renown." We're right back in that hour, the red lights are flashing everywhere, the coming of the--of the Lord. And Jesus said, "As it was before Sodom was burned, so will it be at the coming of the Son of man." [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] That's right.

L-163 The women are becoming so, they don't realize what they're doing; an evil spirit upon them. Why would a woman take her clothes off like that, to expose herself? She don't mean to be bad, they--they, they're just caught in that trap, and they don't know it. See, just like it was back there in that time. Female flesh being displayed everywhere, see, very attractive, runs the sons of God right out of their mind, nearly, and then a Sodom and Gomorrah law to protect her from it. What a disgrace, and our government standing for such stuff as that!

L-164 I wish I could be governor for a while, or have this nation. Ever I caught a woman dressed like that, she would go to the woman's prison for lifetime. She would never be able... Yeah. [Congregation applauds.--Ed.] If I caught a woman and a man like that,...?... [Congregation applauds.] If a woman and a man was caught living like that, they would both become sterile, that's all there is to it; and performed right out in public, by the doctors. Yes, sir. We would put...

L-165 The penalty is just a little old... What is law without penalty? The penalty of God's law is death. Sin is death. That's right. We need a law that's stern. We... Oh, my! What we've got now, a bunch of politics, can be swayed any way you want to. The whole thing is corruptible.

L-166 Hurry, church, back to the Word of the living God! Live off of That, and That alone, 'cause That's what God's people should live by.

L-167 God promised this church a Scriptural sign. He said the resurrection would be reproduced, Jesus Christ and His Church would become so they would be one, in the last days. He promised it. Now we know that it's true.

L-168 Now, He also promised that there would be a restoring of the Faith. We read over in Jude, that said in Jude, "Earnestly contend for the Faith that was once delivered to the saints." Now we are promised, in Malachi 4, by the same system He always did, that we would be restored back to the original Faith. Oh, oh, my! Back to the original Seed, back to the Seed like it begin on the Day of Pentecost, back to the same Doctrine, Word by Word, power by power, Spirit, by the same thing just exactly like it was back in the beginning, through signs and wonders of the living Presence of Jesus Christ. After two thousand years, He is still alive. And He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

L-169 I told Billy, "At thirty minutes, throw something at me, I'd quit preaching." Now I've done went over that time. Notice, I just get...

L-170 I know we ain't got much more time, and the hour is here.

L-171 Friends, don't just come to the meeting, say, "Well, I really enjoyed it. It was a little hot, but I enjoy it." Don't do that.

L-172 Be sincere. Move into it. Make confessions. Clean yourself up. If there is little doubts and flustrations in your heart, don't even come in the prayer line. No, sir. I want clean. Our confessions is a roundabout way.

L-173 I had a woman on an interview here, a few weeks ago. And she said... I found in there where she had a baby, belonged to another man. And she had lived with two boys, and she had took this one boy and married him because she liked him better, and said the baby was his. And she knowed all the time it belonged to somebody else. And she said, "I confessed that."

L-174 I said, "Yeah, here is the way you said it. 'O Deary, O Deary, what if you thought something, O Deary? You know, old John, old boy, old boy, what--what if I told you this baby belonged to somebody else? Hee-hee, you wouldn't believe it, would you?' 'No.' 'Well, what if it did? Oh, say, John, are we going out tonight to have some 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min hamburgers?'" That's not confession. Get down on your knees!

L-175 That's the way people come to God. "O Lord, You're so good, You just let me do anything I want to." Don't you believe that. God has got a law you live by. Until you clean up, and wash out, and confess, and believe with all your heart, come back to the Word of God, you are still guilty. You can't do that.

L-176 You got to tear the thing down. People has got to come, godly, sincerely, get down on their knees and stay there until the results takes place, let that Holy Ghost power of God's love injects into your heart and makes you confess all your sins and all your unbelief, and accept Jesus Christ. God has sent everything He could.

L-177 Watch how He proved it in the first time, like Brother Vayle was saying a while ago. See? How did they know He was Messiah when He seen the woman at the well? He told her what was wrong with her. Quickly, that woman in that horrible condition, living with six husbands. Said, "You've had five, and the one you're living with now is not your husband." Six husbands, six man on the string, she was running with, in that condition.

L-178 But when she was told, she seen That, the Word of God sharper than a two-edged sword, a discerner of the thoughts of the heart. She said, "Sir, You must be a prophet." Now, the Word of the Lord comes to the prophet, see, to reveal these things. Said, "You must be a prophet. We ain't had prophets for hundreds of years. But," said, "You must be a prophet. Now we know that we're looking for the Messiah, and, when the Messiah comes, that's what He will do." Jesus said, "I am He."

L-179 And the people of the city, of that entire city of Sychar, every man believed Jesus Christ. He didn't have to do it again. He did it that one time, and every man believed Him because the woman said so. Her testimony, she had been changed so, they couldn't keep from believing it. Oh, give us men and women with positive testimonies, that will bring man to repentance again. They believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, by that sign, He proved that He was the Messiah.

L-180 God, help me, by the same sign, with His Spirit, to prove that He is still the Messiah. Amen. Only by the Word of God shall we live. His promise is that He would do it.

L-181 Now accept God's provided way at the end time. If you're sick tonight, God has a provided way. Jesus Christ is the provided way. If you're sinful, tonight, unbelieving, can't live right, can't seem to get settled down; Jesus Christ is God's provided way. Just believe Him. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Then He and the Holy Spirit, which He is, Holy Spirit is Jesus, and Christ in form of the Spirit. "A little while and the world seeth Me no more, yet ye shall see Me, because I will be with you, even in you." The Holy Spirit, Christ, calling It, "I." See? Christ, God the Holy Spirit in Him, was to be in His Church, "unto the end of the world." God's Word. "And the works that I do shall you also. A little while and the world won't see Me no more, yet you shall see Me, for I am going to be in you. He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he also. In you, until the end of the world." God has a provided way for His believing children. Jesus Christ is that way, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Let us bow our heads just a moment.

L-182 While you have your heads bowed, do you believe that He is the way? Is there some here that would like to believe that, and never has accepted it yet? Friend, will you raise your hand, be that sincere here in this old arena, tonight, and say, "Brother Branham, pray for me. I don't want, I--I--I don't want to meet God this way"? And remember...

L-183 We broke in on a conversation, picking up a phone in a certain place, the other day. And the woman had just got in, and a man was calling her back, that was out with her, and this woman is supposed to be a Christian. And he said, "Is your husband still asleep?" "Yeah." Said, "If he ever finds out, we..." Said, "Don't make any difference to me," and a little baby crying.

L-184 Do you realize? Can you understand? This adulterous, dirty, filthy world, she is at the end. God is going to...

L-185 There won't be one building setting by another one, in Chicago one of these days, or nowhere else. God is fixing to rain out that sixth seal upon the earth, break that seal and turn loose the wrath of God upon the earth. But before He 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min does that, the Church will be gone. The Bride will be gone; the church won't, she'll go through the tribulation, but the Bride will be gone. His little wife won't go through that.

L-186 Don't you want to be one of them members of Her, tonight? If you do, and want to be remembered in prayer, with your head bowed, raise your hand. God bless you. God bless you, and you, and you.

L-187 Our Heavenly Father, all the words that I could say, wouldn't mean nothing in comparison with one Word You would say. I'm just a man quoting what You said. I pray for these who raised their hands. God, grant it.

L-188 That great vision, this morning, tore me up, Lord. I'm still tore up. And I pray that--that You'll help me, quieten me, Lord. I'm nervous, and I ask that--that You will help.

L-189 If there be these that's raised their hands tonight, strayed into the building here, of some means, let the great Holy Spirit speak to them now, and may they come sweetly to You. I know the custom is, Lord, call people around the altar. We believe that's all right. But according to the Scripture, they said, "As many as believed, was baptized."

L-190 And I pray, God, that these people would rush up for Christian baptism, believing on You, and confessing their sins, and accepting Jesus Christ and His Blood for their pardon, then rise and be baptized, calling upon the Name of the Lord, washing away their sins. And then may they be filled with the Holy Spirit of His promise, sealed, that Life that changes their whole nature, gives them a new hope, lets them look on; they become a prisoner, from any desire, any ambitions.

L-191 Like the great Saint Paul, wanted to be a rabbi. He wanted to be a great man. He trained. His father and mother trained him to be so. And back there on the backside of that desert, after meeting that Pillar of Fire that day, that had told him, "It's hard for you to kick against the pricks." Called his name, "Saul, Saul!" How could a Pillar of Fire call his Name? But He said, "I am Jesus." And he knew that's what Jesus did when He was on earth. He knowed that Pillar of Fire was the Christ that led his people out of Egypt, through the wilderness, and he knowed that That was still the anointed.

L-192 And, Lord, we know You're still the same today. I pray for each one. Give them peace in their hearts, Lord. Sanctify this little church, and may all that's connected with it, and all the strangers in our gates, for Jesus' sake I ask it.

L-193 And then, Father, I pray also that You'll heal the sick. Vindicate what I've said, to be true. My time is running out, Lord, I'm getting old, and I pray that You'll help me just to win every soul that I can. And, God, let the people see, tonight, that if the Almighty Himself comes down in our midst and proves that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, may the people see that, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that comes from the mouth of God." Grant it, Lord. And not hybrid themselves by some great infections of--of some disease germ that brings unbelief in their heart, but may that infection be taken out by the power of the Spirit; and the germ of Eternal Life might live in them, that they might grow to the full stature of Jesus Christ, that, in this last day, that He and His wife would be one. Grant it, Lord. I ask in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-194 Now believe, you people that raised your hand. If you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and accept Him as your Saviour, and believe Him, that His Blood, and that alone, atones for your sin, then I want you to see some of these ministers here, for baptism right away. They'll tell you what to do from there.

L-195 Now for the sick and afflicted, those who have prayer cards, let's start from number one, and start and get a few of them up here, I say about one to fifteen. I'm running about fifteen, twenty minutes late. I should have been out, fifteen, twenty minutes ago.

L-196 Number one, who has got it, the prayer card number one? Raise up your hand, ever who has prayer card number one. [Brother Lee Vayle says, "Had they better stand, brother, stand?"--Ed.] Stand up, ever who has got prayer card number one. If you can, stand up. We can't see too good here, it's the lighting situation is not good. Prayer card number one, number two, number three, number four, five, six, seven, eight.

L-197 This lady here, while you're get-... One to fifteen, stand up now, while the rest of us bow our heads. Come right over here, come right over here, number one to fifteen, while we bow our heads and pray for this lady, that she is sick 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min over here. Mrs. Way has her here, now, while we pray again for her. It's awfully hot in here, tonight, the perspiration is just squashing out of my shoes. Let's pray now, all with our heads down.

L-198 Our Heavenly Father, grant these blessings to us, in the Name of Jesus Christ Thy Son. Let grace and mercy, peace, help our dear sister, God, as she is sick and needy. Let the Holy Ghost come upon her, Father, and give to her, back, good health again. She is sick; come to church, tonight, want to enjoy it, and here we find her sitting here sick, faint, because of the hotness of the heat of the church. God, grant her healing. I pray these blessings in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.

L-199 All right, the Lord bless now. Believe. I seen her nod her head to Sister Way. She is to herself now. And now if some of you want to take her out where she can get a little air. It's awfully hot. If you'd just stand right here and know what it--what it means by this time now!

L-200 Now, let's see, how many you got? [Brother Vayle says, "Ten."--Ed.] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. All right.

L-201 Let's get the prayer line started. Now everyone just as reverent as you can. Now everyone be praying. While, the pianist give us a chord over there, if you will. Only believe, only believe, All things are, possible, only believe.

L-202 That's good. Now everyone reverently and in prayer now. All right. Now don't move around no more. Don't. Don't. You people going in and out, don't do that, see, 'cause this is very dangerous, see, very, very dangerous. All right. Now everybody quieten down, and pray, and believe now with all your heart.

L-203 [Brother Vayle says, "We've got four missing."--Ed.] What say? ["Got four missing."] Well, they don't answer to their call. That's all I know, just make the call. All right.

L-204 How many is missing? Two is missing, number two? Who has got prayer card number two? Is there other speaking people here besides English? Prayer card number two?

L-205 The boy just mixes those cards up and hands them out, they, anybody gets them. Don't take it if you're not coming. See? You must come up, if you're coming. Don't give it to nobody else; you have to come yourself.

L-206 Prayer card number two? All right, if it's not here, let's bow our heads. It's awfully hot, very, very hot. And maybe this lady here has it. Have you got prayer card number two, lady? You got prayer card number two? Maybe she is Norwegian or something, and don't speak. Billy, check that card down there, somebody, and see if she has number two card. Yeah. Now... [Someone says, "Yeah."--Ed.] Number two. All right. Number one, two, all right. Yeah. Okay, now, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. There is about two or three more missing. One to fifteen, if you will.

L-207 Well, everybody reverent now, see. All right, now be real reverent, and pray now. How many is going to be praying? Raise your hands, "I'm going to be praying. I'm going to be praying, believing God."

L-208 Now how many out here doesn't have a prayer card, and you know God is going to, will heal you, let's see your hand. You, you believe God will heal you. Everybody, all right, everywhere now, everyone believe. Just have faith. Don't doubt. Believe God, with all your heart. All right. Come, lady.

L-209 It's kind of makes everybody hurry and excitable, and the Spirit of the Lord don't like that at all. See? Let's get quiet, see. Quiet yourself, just say, "Lord, here I am, I'm here to serve You. I love You, and I know You will grant my request." That's it. Now can you hear me? I'll try to stand right here.

L-210 A lady here. Here is a beautiful Bible picture again. Here is a lady that's a colored lady. I'm a white man. Certainly brings out a beautiful Bible picture, to you strangers. 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min

L-211 Jesus met the woman at the well. She was a Samaritan, He was a Jew, and they begin to talk. He said, "Bring Me a drink." Went to talking to her, and He found out what her trouble was. But first He asked her to give a drink, and she wouldn't grant it, because she was of another race. And He let her know, right away, there was no difference in races.

L-212 And here we are, tonight, after two thousand years. Now, Jesus Christ promised that the things that He did, the believer would do also. Is that right? Everybody believe that? [Congregation says, "Amen."] Saint John, 14th chapter, 12th verse. And, now, why? He was the Word. Is that right? And He said, "If ye abide in Me, My Words in you, ask what you will." Now if this woman is sick, I couldn't heal her. Nobody could heal her; God already done it. If she is a sinner, I couldn't save her. God has already did it; she just has to believe it.

L-213 But now if Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and give an Eternal sign of His resurrection, in this last days, then He would speak through me if I am His servant and called for this purpose. Now all servants are not called to do that, see, but there is, at least, in a generation, one that did have that. Now, but if this be so, it's to show to the rest of them, in your ministry, that God is with you.

L-214 See, He does other things. I have spoke in tongues. I don't, I don't do it all the time. I've done it four or five times in my life. I didn't know what I was doing. Hearing myself speaking one day, get in a thought, look around and seeing what was going on. Heard somebody, sound like speak in German. I looked and see where it was. It was me doing it, myself. See? And I thought I could run through a troop and leap over a wall then. But find out, it was me, I just kept real still till He got finished then. Then, it was the Holy Spirit making intercessions for a woman that later on showed up, and very, very bad with TB, and the Lord healed her.

L-215 But now, here to this audience, this lady is strange. She is a colored lady, and she is somewhere around my age, but I've never seen her. She is just a woman. Now, she is standing here for some reason. I don't know. I--I couldn't tell you. I don't know nothing about her. But if the Holy Spirit can reveal to me what her trouble is, or what she is here for, or--or what she wants, or something like that, or what she has done, or what she ought to have done, or something like that, then, and let her be the judge whether it's right or not. Would that convince everybody that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-216 We'll talk to each other, just a moment, 'cause, get quiet, you see. The Holy Spirit is very timid, and I just talking to you like our Lord did the woman at the well.

L-217 Now, see, it wouldn't be me, 'cause I don't know you. But, you see, I'm a body of flesh, you're a body of flesh; but inside of you is a spirit and a soul, inside of me is a spirit and a soul. And then when this Spirit inside of me, if it be the Spirit of Christ, see, then, and a gift that I was born...

L-218 Just like you'd go to sleep and dream anything, you would dream a dream. Now, see, this five senses has to come inactive, and then you are over here in dream land. And then when these five senses come active again, you're awake, see, 'cause your subconscious is way out from your first conscious.

L-219 But when they're both right together, you don't go to sleep, you just break over into that. See? You're still in your five senses. You understand? That's a gift, where, it's a prophetic gift, that a vindication that Christ is still the same. See? See?

L-220 We have ministers who is trained in the Word. We have different ones, man like Oral Roberts, who just lays hands on, and shakes the people, and say, "Bless God, you just receive it." See, and he is just one of them burly type with it. See, that's God's man, see, being there is other type that don't do that, but they do something else. All of it is gifts of the Spirit; apostles, prophets, and pastors. You believe in that, don't you? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-221 Do you believe God sent me to do that? [The sister says, "I know it."--Ed.] You do. Thank you, sister. Yes, sir. Why did I call you 'sister'? Because, when you said that, I felt the Spirit say that's right.

L-222 Now you are here, and I see you now; people can still hear me. The woman is having a sleepless time. She can't sleep. That's right. Very getting sick, too. Can't hardly eat, you're getting very sick. Just... And you're afraid it's gallstones. That's right. That's exactly. You're right. Sick, nausea feeling. That's right. Then you--you are... 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min

L-223 There is somebody else that you're interested in. That's your, that's your husband. And he has a--a--a kind of a--a nervous, mental illness that's kind of a real mental nervous. And he is bothered with some kind of a trouble he is in. He is trying to get something, something, a--a business deal, it's a pension or something he is trying to get. That's right, a pension he is trying to get. That's it. Yes, sir, a pension. And then there is...

L-224 I see a little boy, is about twelve years old, or something like that. He's just a little fellow, and he is really not your son. He's a--he's a... You've raised him, and there is something you think, that, he, something has went wrong with him. He isn't. He is just a little boy. He'll be all right. Sure. It's okay. Believe the right thing. Everything will be all right. Go, believing it. [Congregation rejoices.--Ed.] God bless you, sister.

L-225 By the way, do you believe God can tell me who you are? Do you believe that God can tell me who you are, lady? Mrs. Red, that's who you are. That's right. [Congregation rejoices--Ed.]

L-226 Sonny, it's all right. You mind your auntie. She thought something had happened, but it hasn't. You're just a little boy. You don't mean to do that. Go ahead, you'll be all right. Amen.

L-227 My, how the Holy Spirit would like to break through on that! See?

L-228 How do you do? If the Holy Spirit can tell me what your trouble is, you believe me then, will you? [The sister, says, "I believe."--Ed.] You believe. All right. You have a--a nervous condition. You have roaring in your head. ["That's right."] "Oo-oo-oo," going like that all the time. That's right. Then you was examined for a growth, and they found the growth is in the rectum. Do you believe with all your heart now? ["Yes."] That's--that's right. ["Amen."] Go on your road, believing, and you'll get well. Believe. Got what you want? All right. ["Amen."] See?...?...

L-229 You believe with all your heart? [The sister says, "I do."--Ed.] Just have faith. Don't doubt. Believe that Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Is a younger person that you're here for. No, it's two. You got two daughters, and they both have like a nervous break, like. That's right. Lord God, be merciful to them children. Do you believe if I'll just... If I will speak His Word, do you believe they'll come out of it? ["I know it."] Then go, receive it. God bless you. [Congregation rejoices.] "If thou canst believe, all things are possible."

L-230 You believe in it, don't you? You believe with all your heart? Do you believe that baby with that throat trouble will get all right? All right, you can have it, sir. I see that woman flashing here, and back there, and here, and I thought, "What was it?" Setting there praying for her baby. All right, it'll get over it. It'll be all right. Don't doubt it.

L-231 Do you believe with all your heart? Do you believe that Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever? If the Lord Jesus will reveal to me what your trouble is, you'll believe Him? You have a nervous condition, complications; course, a woman your age. But, yet, here is the great thing, it's a growth. Do you believe God can tell me where the growth is? It's on your left breast. That's right? All right. Go, believe it, and it'll come off. Have faith in God. Don't doubt.

L-232 I seen something blessed happen, and something horrible happen, just then. "Obedience is better than sacrifice, hearkening, unto the fats of rams." Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Lord Jesus, be merciful. My, oh, my! Obedience, sincerity and obedience; how the Lord Jesus did something just then! I'm going to tell you just in a minute. Just believe. Don't doubt.

L-233 You believe God will heal you there, sister with the little yellow dress on, sitting there praying? Okay, it's alright. All right, you receive it. Just have faith. Don't doubt. Believe.

L-234 Sitting right back there in that second row, you got throat trouble, too, that lady looking right there at me. Do you believe that Jesus Christ will make you well? You do? Yes. You had to give it up, give somebody a place to get out. Five minutes more, and you would have been healed. He missed it, but you got it. You can have your request now. It leaves you. 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min

L-235 Do you believe that God can make you well? [The sister says, "Yes, sir."--Ed.] Do you believe God can tell me what your trouble is? ["Yes."] Got diabetes. ["Yes."] Your husband is here with it, too, isn't he? ["Yes, sir."] That's right. Both of you be well. Go, believe it with all your heart.

L-236 Asthmatic, nervous. Do you believe God can make you well? You believe it with all your heart? Let me lay hands on you as you pass by. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may she be healed. Grant it.

L-237 Arthritis. Do you believe that God will make you well? [The sister says, "Yes, I do."--Ed.] Well, just go, say, "Thank You, Lord God. I believe with all my heart." Yes, sir.

L-238 Oh, my! Nervous, arthritis, stomach. Just believe with all your heart. Go on, say, "Thank You, Lord, for making me well."

L-239 You know, the blood is where our life is, isn't it? But God can heal anything (do you believe that?), blood, anything else. All right, it's over. Go, say, "Thank You, Lord." Go, believe with all your heart.

L-240 What if I just laid hands on you, and said, "The Lord bless you," would you believe you would be healed? Come through, then, see. In the Name of Jesus Christ, God, make him well. Have faith.

L-241 I never seen so many people this... This lady here has arthritis, too, complications, things. Yeah, that's right. Do you believe God makes you well? All right. Go on, say, "Thank You, Lord Jesus."

L-242 How many out there wants to believe now? "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceeds from the mouth of God."

L-243 Do you believe that the mouth of God said this, the...? Jesus Christ is God in flesh. We know that. No argument about that. He wasn't just a prophet; He was God, God made manifest in the flesh. The last thing He said, according to the Gospel, when He left the earth, "These signs shall follow them that believe. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover." Do you believe that with all your heart? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Now how many believers are here, raise up your hands. All right.

L-244 Now I want you to do something. How many here has something wrong with them, that they want to be prayed for? Raise up your hands. Now, looks like everyone. Now, here is what you do. You exercise your faith, I'll exercise my faith, and we'll make a union (it's getting late) by God. And then will you pray for the person that's got their hands laid on you? Because, they are going to be praying for you, see, you.

L-245 Like, like here was someone, they had their hands on me, I have my hands on them; I'm praying for them, they're praying for me. I'm saying, "Lord, I am a believer. This lady, this gentleman, this boy, girl, whatever, is suffering. Please, Dear God. I suffer, I know what they're going through with. Heal them, Dear God."

L-246 Be deeply sincere now, be deeply sincere, and just pray like that you would want them to pray for you. See? Do to others as you would have others do to you. Now you pray for the person you put your hand on, just the way that you would want Jesus to pray for you, see, and watch what happens. See, God's Word can't fail. Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] It's the Truth. It, it just can't fail.

L-247 Now, now first thing we do, let's just wait just a moment and confess all of our unbelief. Let... Confess all of our sins, confess all that we've ever done, that's wrong. Let's just say, "Lord Jesus, forgive me." Let... I want this to be a real meeting where Jesus Christ can be manifested, Jesus Christ to be magnified. Now while I'm talking to you, just confess everything, say, "Lord, I--I've had a lot of doubts. But right here in Your Presence tonight, when I--I stand and see the very thing that's totally impossible without You, no one can do that."

L-248 You'd be ashamed to call it "an evil spirit," 'cause that's unforgivable, see. See, Jesus said so. Call the work of the Holy Spirit, that the Bible said He would do, then call it an evil spirit, then it's... then that's unforgivable. See?

L-249 So you say, "I'm standing right here now, knowing that, setting here," whatever position you're in, "knowing that, that--that--that You're here. Why, you couldn't do these things... And now, our Brother Branham, he just has faith to believe that Your Word is true, and he has a gift. I have a gift, too, a gift of Your love. I have a gift of Your Spirit in me. I have a gift in me, and in that gift is healing. Now, I'm--I'm asking healing for my sick friends sitting here. I'm 63-0731, There Is Only One Way Provided By God For Anything, Marigold Center, Chicago, IL, 101 min asking healing, and they're going to ask healing for me. Now You forgive me of my sins. And, Lord Jesus, if I've done or said anything wrong, forgive me. Reveal it to me, Lord, I'll go make it right. If You'll just reveal it and show me what I've done wrong, I'll go make it right."

L-250 And I pray now for mercy for this audience. Grant it, Lord. Have mercy upon the sick and the afflicted. Those people are here praying. They believe. They've seen You present. I seen You, Lord. All of us has seen the very evidence of the living God.

L-251 We've far forgot. We've went so much hard, Lord, on the other side, on the hybrid side, denominationals, and creeds, and big churches, and the care of the day. We Pentecostals, Lord, has seen You do so much, till we just harden ourself away from You, almost. It's--it's pitiful, Father. Forgive us of this thing. We've seen so much as it gradually come up to this, until we've, well, we--we've just forgotten the blessings, Lord. Forgive us, and help us. Will You, Lord?

L-252 Now have mercy, and may the great Holy Spirit, that's present now, take charge of every believer in here. And now, as Your servant, I pray for every sick person here. I--I ask You, Lord, to charge the hands that'll be laid upon the sick. Let--let the power of the Holy Ghost be upon each one of these men, women, boys and girls, as we're setting together, Lord. People setting here, sick, Lord that they'll... They come out here to be well. Let them come tomorrow night, well. Grant it, Lord, please do. Hear my prayer. I--I pray with all my heart, that You'll do it, confessing everything that I know that's wrong. And now help us, and now let the Holy Ghost take charge. And these people laying their hands upon one another, may that they be made well, right now. Grant it, Father, through Jesus Christ's Name.

L-253 And now, Satan, I charge you, by the Blood of Jesus Christ, that all-sufficient Blood; that through that Life that was in that Blood, that's now in our hearts, we've been changed from what we once was, to Christians. We once was doubters, now we're believers. Our sins are under the Blood.

L-254 "He that will confess his sins shall have forgiveness." We have confessed our sins, and we have forgiveness. Now we stand, no more... Our sins are in the Sea of Forgetfulness. We can no more be accused of sin. We have confessed it. We made things right. And now the great chasm, that was between us and God, has been taken away. God put the sin in the Sea of Forgetfulness. He could never even remember us anymore as sinners. We are no longer sinners. We are sons and daughters, and now we're here for deliverance for the flesh. And because we are believers, the Word said, the Word, the Word that Christ left us, said, "These signs shall follow them that believe. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover." And this we are doing, by faith we are doing it, in the Name of Jesus Christ.

L-255 Now, each person in here, lay your hands on somebody by you. Lay your hands on somebody by you, and now say:

L-256 Satan, I charge thee. [Congregation says, "Satan, I charge thee."--Ed.] I charge thee, Satan, ["I charge thee, Satan,"] in the Name ["in the Name"] of Jesus Christ, ["of Jesus Christ,"] let loose of my friend. ["let loose of my friend."] Come out of here. ["Come out of here."] You are defeated. ["You are defeated."] My friend is well. ["My friend is well."] I believe ["I believe"] Jesus Christ now makes me well, ["Jesus Christ now makes me well,"] to honor Him, to bring praise. ["to honor Him, to bring praise."]

L-257 Believe it with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and God Almighty will grant it. God bless you. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O. Box 4951 Naperville, IL 60567 USA Email: thevoice1017@lwbcast.org http://www.lwbcast.org/ A Paradox
