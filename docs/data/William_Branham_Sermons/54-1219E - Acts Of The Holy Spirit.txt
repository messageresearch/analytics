--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 ... around the church. We just had a funeral service this afternoon, got another one in the morning. So I said "Let's slip down to church right quick now, so we won't miss any of the service." And I didn't know that Brother Neville was going to say, "Come up here and speak a little bit." But I am just so happy for the opportunity to get to greet you again in the Name of the Lord Jesus, for His love and kindness, and mercy to all of us; and to our brother here, the pastor.

L-3 You know, Brother Neville is a little different from lots of ministers. They just... When a minister, when he gives up his pulpit, that's just a whole lot to him. You just don't realize what it is. But Brother Neville has always been so loving and considerate to always to give up his pulpit when I come in. And say, "Brother Bill..." And not only ask you if you want to, kind of persuade you to come, you know. And it just makes you feel double welcome. And I'm so happy for that. See? You just can't turn anyone down like that. They're just so kind and nice in that way.

L-4 I heard him say his little baby was vomiting and sick. And I... Brother Junior, I believe it was his baby I heard coughing back there a few minutes ago. Is that your baby, Junior, that was doing the coughing? And a lot of colds and things going on. We'll have prayer for the sick, just in a little bit.

L-5 Now, I'll just start where I left off this morning then, over in the 4th chapter of Acts. And so... And begin, I believe, along about the 10th verse of the 4th chapter of--of the Acts of the apostles, or acts of the Holy Spirit in the apostles. See? We always think that, call that, "The Acts of the apostles." But it wasn't the acts of the apostles. It was the Holy Spirit in the apostles, acting. You see? The men themselves were men, and they couldn't act. Before I go any farther...

L-6 I was sitting back with Brother Wood, just a few moments ago. And a certain little fellow, that's been around the church here for a long time, he's always wanted to find his place. I believe I could tell him if he'd just do it. It's singing. Brother Temple, you--you might do one thing and another, but you're a good singer. So I--I sure appreciate that. And if you just turn yourself loose to singing, God would use you. But you--you're hit around over everything else but the right thing. Get in the singing. There's your talent. You have to use that. Wonderful. I like that old-time singing. Don't you? Yes, sir. To hear that, way back like that, I like that, Brother Neville. I sure do. One...

L-7 I ...?... enjoy Brother Neville's preaching and everything. And I certainly enjoy this fine old fashion singing that he and the sisters does too on the--the radio program. If you all has never heard them yet, many of you, why, turn in every Saturday morning and listen to them, and you'll certainly be blessed. Why, my wife and kiddies, and everybody is watching for that program, just like it was as if I was going to be down there myself, and I was down there, one of the--the loved one in the family. We look forward to that pulpit, or that program on Saturday morning, and we're so glad of it.

L-8 You know, this morning there was something happened here that I--I can't get over yet, was that about that baby. I had the most mysterious feeling about that. And I'm just a wondering. When I got up this morning, I looked at the wife and I said, "Honey, I--I either had a dream or a vision. And I'm," I said, "I'm--I'm not going to say it was a vision, because I might have been asleep." But I said, "it's just so real. And I was sitting up there in the room when it ended." I said, "I don't remember though when I got up to--at the vision, when it struck me." But when I got down here, it--and seen all those things moving just the way. And I'd called Sister Cox and told her a few days ago about a baby of that same type. And that must have been the baby. And the little fellow, its eyes are eat out with cancer. Its little eye here is done gone, and just a hull sticking there. It's went over in the other eye, and the baby is just laying lifeless. And a famous surgeon in Louisville told the mother to bring it over here to me to be prayed for. So that's... And so all... I just believe that God was getting--had give a vision for that baby. And just as sure as I believe I'm standing at this platform tonight, that baby's healed. Yes, sir. I just... I am very seldom, Brother Cox, ever get mixed up in things of that type. 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min

L-10 Now, I did one time; I couldn't get it just clear about Brother George Wright, when I'd... Brother McDowell had called me up to--to go to his work, or Charlie's mother up there. And she was laying lifeless in the hospital nearly. And Brother Mack wanted me to go, so I--I went up to see the baby. And I'd been down at Brother George's for four days. And I loved him. But with all my heart I believe he's a going. That's right. I believe he's a dying. And the doctors... There's no chance for him. Blood clot's going to his heart, so there wasn't nothing could be done. Mrs. Wright, setting here, our sister, asked what I thought about it. After four days of praying for him, I said, "I believe he's gone." And little Edith asked me about it. I wouldn't tell her. I said, "Oh..." But she still had faith. She believed. She held on. And I... Brother Shelby is setting back there, just like if he was my own blood brother. He met me out there; he said, "What do you think about dad?" I said, "Shelby, I really believe he's going." I said, "I believe he's--he's going away from us." I said, "Well, he's seventy-three years old, and he's lived his time out. And God only promised him threescore and ten." I said, "I believe he's gone."

L-15 And that night when I got home from down there, Brother Mack was just persistent that I should go up there. And Charlie drove me up there, way... He got up there, and never got back till way in the night, or early in the morning. And I just went and prayed for the woman, was all I could do. And when I come home, went in the room, and undressed, and got ready for bed, and when I did, I heard somebody talking. I looked over there, and there was a gray-headed woman. And she was standing in a kitchen, talking to somebody on the telephone. And it happened to be it was that boy's mother. That's right. And I... Then I seen the--the old willow tree right beside of Brother George's house, and I seen clods a falling of mud or dirt, kind of clay looking. And it was dirt, and it was mud. And He said it was "grave." Something about a grave, "And about that many of those was laughing at him, would be in their grave 'fore him," or something like that. And I couldn't understand it just right. So quickly, I got a hold of Sister Wright, and called her and told her (Sister Wright, I believe it was) that I didn't get the vision just what it was. However, this Charlie's mother went home, and was at home and talked on the phone, and everything just like the vision said. I think she's gone on now. But she went home just as it said, when they said she couldn't even live till morning; but she did. Now, and that was just in regard that God let us know that He'd answered our prayer.

L-19 Someone asked the other day, or either the--the man who wrote the book recently, said, "A man that had prostate trouble," and said, "he was healed. And a year later, said he was--he was sick again." Why, absolutely. You can be healed tonight, and sick again in the morning of the same thing. You can be a sinner tonight, and a... You can be a sinner tonight, and a Christian in the morning. You can be a Christian tonight, and a sinner in the morning. Sure. A doctor can give a man penicillin for a bad cold or pneumonia, and heal him right now. And they could give an examination, be perfectly clear, not a bit of pneumonia about him, or fever; and tomorrow he can die with pneumonia, the same thing. Is that right? That has nothing to do with it. See, it's just, "Gag at a gnat, and swallowing a camel," that as the old saying is.

L-23 But anyhow, then coming back and telling Sister Wright, I went then, and I had a vision again and seen Brother George Wright setting right back there, and me coming in the door. He come right down through here, and crossed this aisle, and went right down there, and shook my hand, walking. He couldn't walk; you all know his conditions. Blood clot had just turned his legs right down like that, and doctor said, "It's going to his heart. He'd die at any time." So at seventy-three years old, there wasn't an earthly chance for him to live.

L-25 And I come back and told the church, called Sister Wright. Not only that, but I went down there. And there in his house, people... Two men was sitting in his house, I believe, that morning. Wasn't it right, Brother George? Two men was in your house the morning that I come there. The fellow over next door and some other big fellow. And I said, "Oh, 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min yes..." [Brother George Wright says, "You must have talked to them. I don't remember."--Ed.] Sir? ["You must have talked to them. I don't remember."] I believe... Wasn't that right, Edith? Yes, and there was two. Yeah, he was in bad shape. But I said, "Don't let nothing bother you, 'cause Brother Wright's a coming to the tabernacle, walking again, for it's THUS SAITH THE LORD." I got mixed up on it. I said, "There's something about a grave." And what it was then, when the vision was revealed to me clear what it was, it was those who had made fun of him about leaving the church that he was with, that didn't believe in Divine healing, that he'd see their graves dug, and know that they'd go before him. How many is left, since then? [Brother George Wright says, "Four or five has done been buried since I got better. And my preacher that preached me out of my church, was put away about two weeks ago."--Ed.] Is the Lord right? Yes, sir. Sure is. That's five out of... That four, and that, that'll be five. Five is gone. And it hasn't been a year yet, has it, Brother George? ["Just about a year."] Just about a year, this time. That's what it was. See? When the Lord speaks, it's absolutely perfect. You can just watch it right down. I've never seen one of it fail. And no matter what...

L-29 If our beloved doctors and things has worked with that baby, and everything has been done... I'm not positive, but I'm almost positive that that's the very same thing, because I seen that woman with that stuff on her, you know, make-up's on her lips; and--and it was standing where that my wife's funeral was preached. And the baby looked like my baby, Sarah, back there. See? And that's the baby, I'm almost positive. If it is, there is nothing else in the world... But I seen that baby, from death, come to life. See? And it'll live, just as certain as God is in heaven tonight, and His Words are true. And He's... Yes, sir. I believe it with all my heart. So we'll watch and see. The Lord is marvelous. Isn't He? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] How good He is to us.

L-30 Now, we were studying, this morning, over in the Book of Acts, about the Church, just becoming afire with the glory of God, how that the Lord Jesus had just come as a witness to the earth, that He was the Son of God. How they had had great confidence in Him... And how He had told them that it was impossible for Him in body flesh, to be in everybody, He could only be in one body. But then if He went away, He would return again in Spirit form, and then He would come to every hungry heart that hungered and thirst for Him. And the very works that He did here on earth, He would continue in His Church unto the end of the world.

L-31 Aren't you glad you're in that Church tonight? Not under the... Not this, this--this church roof, I mean in the Church. There is only one Church. And--and you don't join It. You--you can't take a paper in It. You--you--you're just born in It; that's all. And you're born in that Church, and it's by grace that you're born into It. You couldn't hunger to come into It; you have no desire of It. You'd hate the very thoughts of It, unless God Himself has ordained that you should be in that Church. And if you were... If you'll ever be in that Church, God knew it before the foundation of the world, that you'd be in that Church. And He ordained it and predestinated you to be in that Church. Isn't that marvelous? "All that hear My Voice shall come to Me." Is that right? "And all the Father has given Me will come to Me, and I'll raise him up again at the last day."

L-33 See, now, people say, "I don't believe in such stuff." Don't despise them. Feel sorry for them. See? Pray for them. Because they--they haven't got nothing in here, and probably never will have nothing to make them believe with. They believe it from a--a theological standpoint. They say, "Well, yes, I believe that that's just..." But I mean, they can't believe unless it's really God in their heart. See? And you can't... Jesus said, "He that heareth My Words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, has Everlasting Life." Not because he joined church, not because he was baptized, not because he did this, because he shouted, because he did this other. Them things are all right; joining church, baptizing, shouting. But He said, "He that has Everlasting Life, because he hath believed."

L-35 Now, in Acts 2:38 Peter said, "Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." And I've wondered through the years, when I'd see that and read it. I thought, "Lord, here comes men and women." I've seen them come to the altar, kneel down and cry, and pray go and be baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and in a 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min week later, be out with the world again." I thought, "O God, surely Your Word's not wrong. I just can't understand it. But You, Lord, if I'll continue with You, You said Your Word would abide in me." So I continued with Him, until now I see what it is. He's made it known. See? And I never knew it until the Lord just opened it up one day, and there it was laying right before me. Then I seen them people wasn't what they was at the beginning (See?), that, "No man can come to Me, except My Father draws him." It's not he that wants to be; it's God that elects it to be. It isn't whether you want It or not; you have nothing to do with it. It's God. He, "He hardens whom He will harden. He has mercy on whom He will have mercy." That's right. And no matter who you are, what position you have, whether you're the president or whether you're a bum on the street, doesn't make a bit of difference. "God has mercy on whom He will have mercy." And before the world began, He ordained that so many people, down through the ages, who they was, would be saved. And every one that He ordained will come to Him. That's right. Every one will come, and none of them will be lost. He's ordained, said there'd be a Church there; It would be without blemish; It would be without wrinkle.

L-39 And now, as the ages moved on, and we seen them this morning, in the lesson, those great Orthodox teachers, just as renowned and polished as they could be, just as holy as they could walk on the earth... And the Bible... Listen. The Bible said, "They were found blameless." 'Cause they said, "Oh, I wouldn't touch that. I wouldn't do this." See, but that was not grace; that was works. And we're saved not by works, what we do. It ain't what I done that saved me. It's what Christ done that saved me. See? Not what... I have no holiness. And if I tried to say, "Well, I quit drinking. I quit smoking. I quit stealing, lying, so forth." That's what I done. See? That would be my own. I'd have something to brag about. But I didn't quit nothing. He just come to me and took it out of me. See? That's it. Then it ain't what I done. It's what He done. And then, the Holy Spirit then abides in and grows daily; just grows, making Itself greater and greater; pushes out the things, the cares, the temptation. As you overcome them, the Holy Spirit takes Its place. Do you know what the...? If you got a real bad temptation of something that's not right; overcome that thing a few times, and watch if your testimony doesn't bloom on account of it.

L-44 Look at Samson. When he found... The lion run out to kill him, and he slew the lion when the power of God come upon him, slew him with his bare hand, just probably pulled his jaws apart. A little, bitty, curly-headed shrimp, about that high, little, bitty, old fellow, scrawny looking on the street, seven little locks hanging around his head like a little sissy, and he was no more than a little sissy until the Spirit of God come upon him. Now, it wouldn't be hard to believe that a great big giant could slay a lion with his hands. I believe he could do it. But what's the funny thing was, this little bitty fellow done it. But the Spirit of the Lord come upon him, and he slew the lion, threw it over to one side. And bees built their hive in there. And Samson... The sweetest honey he ever eat come out of that carcass of that killed lion. Is that right? Why? He overcome it with the power of God.

L-47 And if you've got something you want to eat some sweet honey from, just overcome it with the power of God. That's right. Watch how good it is. Oh, my. Pass by... Maybe you've been a drunkard, and yet, every time you smell whiskey or beer, or something, you want to drink it. Overcome it by the power of God; and pass by one time and see what a feeling you got in your heart, when all the thing's dead and gone then, all finished. Oh, my, that sweet honey you get out of it... Now, these people had really overcome. On the day of Pentecost, they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. The powers of God was upon them. They had gifts given to them to speak with tongues and everything. They were just having a marvelous time, and the Church was on fire.

L-49 Now, I'll approach from another little standpoint here, from Stephen during this time, till I get back to my original text again, if I can. Notice, there's a man by the name of Stephen. He was not one of the apostles. No, he wasn't. He was just a deacon. But, oh, brother, he got something in his heart. He couldn't stand still. 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min That's the way every man is when he gets It in his heart: just can't stand it, my, he's got to tell somebody. And here they was, out on the street, holding a revival, and just having a glorious time. Why, it was like a house on fire in a high wind. You just couldn't stop him. That's all. So they picked him up, down on the street, and throwed him in the Sanhedrin Court, said, "Brother, we'll fix that guy. We'll stop all this fanaticism." And they put him in jail till the morning. The Sanhedrin Court met, maybe a half a million people or more, gathered out there. They pushed little old Stephen out there.

L-53 But when he come out, brother, he come out, and his face shined like an Angel. Brother, I don't imagine, like a light shining, but it shined with a countenance that knowed what he was talking about. I don't imagine an Angel would be maybe like a shining, a light or something shining. But it meant he shined with this, that he understood what he was speaking about. The Bible said that he had boldness, walked out there, stern, and said, "Ye men of Israel..." Standing by hisself, like a lamb amongst ten thousand hungry wolves gnashing for his blood. Said, "You men of Israel and all you of Judaea, and so forth, and fathers. Let it be known unto you, the God of Abraham... The God of our fathers appeared to Abraham, brought him up out of Chaldea, give him the promise of this land. And--and to him brought in Jesus Christ, Whom you, by wicked hands, has crucified and slayed." And when he got through with saying that, he said, "Oh, you stiff-necked, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Ghost. Like your fathers did, so do you." Oh, my. I'd like to hear that sermon on a recording. Brother Beeler, wish we'd have got that one. Yes, sir. He said, "Oh, you stiff-necked, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always do resist the Holy Ghost. Like your fathers did, so do you." Brother, that wasn't pulling any punches (was it?), when he knowed his blood would be shed like that.

L-56 The Bible said, "He was a man full..." Full of what? Full of foolishness? No, sir. Full of theology? No, sir. "He was full of the Holy Ghost." That's where all these great, fine qualities laid, because he'd been filled. The world had been pushed out, and the Holy Ghost was in him. "He was a man full of the Holy Ghost." My. Stop him? You couldn't do it. There was no stopping him. He was burning up, brother. He had to preach the Gospel. And he preached the Gospel and done miracles and signs.

L-57 And after while, when they gnashed upon him, drug him from the courts, and took him out there, and slayed him... And they throwed clods and rocks at him, till they mashed him to death. Standing there was Paul, give witness of it, and when Paul looked down and seen Stephen dying, Stephen looked up and said, "I see the heavens open. I see the heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God." Paul looked down. I imagine he scratched his head, and thought, "What's happening?" He said, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge." And fell asleep in the arms of God, rocked. Why? He never felt another rock from that time on. God rocked him to sleep in His arms, just like a mother would her suckling babe. God carried him on the bosoms of Christ to the throne of God yonder where he's in peace, and numbered among the martyrs, with a martyr's crown there tonight "immortal," standing among men. That was Stephen, filled with the Holy Ghost. That's right. The clods just lost their feeling, the big rocks as they was hitting against his head, God rocked him to sleep. The Bible never said he died. The Bible said he fell asleep. Amen. That's the way Christians die. Amen. All right.

L-60 Now, they was having a great time. That report come back; like Brother Neville said, awhile ago. Not just kind of puffed up the apostles, and so forth. They had to do something about it. Right on off they went again, just as hard as they could go, preaching the Gospel. Peter and John, two ignorant, unlearned men, passed up through the gate called Beautiful. My, the devil said, "Well, now, they're just out there preaching, so it won't hurt anything." Then all these people believe in preaching, everything. But when they passed through the gate called Beautiful, there laid a man. The Holy Ghost said, "Peter, that man can be healed. He's got faith." When he perceived he had faith to be healed, he said, "Stand up on your feet." And he picked him up, and held him till his ankle bones received strength. And away he went, leaping and jumping, and praising God. 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min You know what? That caused more trouble than all the preaching they ever did do.

L-63 Brother, you just let something on the phenomenal side start, and watch how every rogue hound in hell go to hollering at him, craving blood. Is that right? True. I'll tell you, Peter preached a sermon on the day of Pentecost, and three thousand souls were saved. The devil never even moved out of his bed. That's right. "Oh, well, let them alone." See? But he passed through the gate called Beautiful the next day, and healed a man crippled from his mother's womb, and all hell turned loose on him (That's right.), throwed him in the jail and kept him there overnight. Yes, sir. Put him into prison, the inner cell there, because the phenomenal. The devil said, "I can't let this thing get started now, Divine healing. If they do, they really will knock my props out from under me." That's right. "Cause, I might fool them around with a little theology once in a while. But I sure can't fool that real Thing that comes out and the people see it done; I'll just stop this before that other group gets on the--the scene."

L-66 He never stopped it then. He can't stop it now. That's right. God's Gospel will move on, and on, and on, and on. And when there is no more heavens or no more earth, that Word would still remain the same. "For heavens and earth will pass away, but My Word shall never pass away." It can't pass away. That Words is just as immortal as God Himself. It can't pass away. I believe every Word of It. All the things that Jesus was, He is now, always will be. That's right. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. The same Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost of today. I'll admit It's been tramped on, made fun of, misinterpreted, misrepresented, and everything else like that; that's only the devil counterfeiting. But there is a real, genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit that brings the same results that they had on the day of Pentecost. That's right.

L-68 Sure, the devil's got the old crow baits out there. I tell you the truth. Every time you see a scarecrow up, remember, there's something good around. That's right. Sure. You don't see a scarecrow on old pineapples... or I mean, hedge apples out here. You get it under the big sweet trees, where you see the scarecrow, 'cause they're wanting to scare away. The devil sticks every scarecrow around real good Holy Ghost religion that he can put around there. Because right in there lays Jesus Christ, the resurrected Son of God, with His immortal power the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. That means "so be it." All right.

L-69 Now, we find out, they put them in the inner prison. The next morning, give them a good thrashing, and sent them off. Now, we find Peter, this morning, standing up among them, down here in the 4th chapter. And he said, "Why, you men of Israel, and you that dwell in Judaea! Let this be known to you. Jesus of Nazareth, how He proved that He was a Man of God. All the signs and wonders that God had done by Him, proved that He was a Man of God." They knew that He was God's Man. And then he said, "You, with wicked hands have crucified and slayed the Prince of Life; Who God's raised up, and we are witness of it." Said, "By faith in His Name this man is made whole." Said, "If we're examined today for the good deeds that we've done, let it be known unto you and all the house of Israel, that through the Name of Jesus Christ this man has been healed."

L-72 When they questioned, "What--what religious group do they belong to? Under where was they ordained at? What cemetery did they come out of?" Or something another like that, "Where did this all come from? Where did we get your rights to do this? Show us what group you represent so we can go back to the elders and find out what you're doing this for. Yes, sir. We want to find out what church teaching this kind of heresy around here. Where you from?" Peter said, "In the Name of Jesus Christ, through faith in His Name, this man's made whole." Amen. And they couldn't say nothing about it, 'cause there stood the man and they knowed him. Amen. Amen.

L-75 Notice, look what he said here now. And this is the stone that was rejected of you builders... Neither is there salvation in any other name: for there's no other name under heaven given among men, whereby you must be saved. 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min Oh, the rejecting of the Stone, the Stone was rejected. Why? When they built the Solomon's temple... I want you to notice a very beautiful picture here. When they went to building Solomon's temple, the stones was cut out from one place, and another place, and another place. Some of them was cut this a way, and some that way. But the Bible said that when they come together... It taken forty years, I believe, to erect the temple. And there wasn't a buzz of a saw nor the sound of a hammer in forty years. The stones going together, stone on stone; only thing they had to do is smear a little mortar across it and set it down there. And it stuck, stone by stone, stone by stone. Think of that.

L-78 Now, here's my idea of it, brethren. When the... That temple there represented the Temple spiritual, the Temple that we're now in. They come into the temple for their blessing. We are baptized into the Temple of God, into the Body of God, into the Body of Jesus Christ. And we're in Christ by Holy Spirit baptism: I Corinthians 12. "And there is therefore now no condemnation to them that's in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1), that walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." They desire spiritual things. They don't care about the fleshly things. My flesh says, "I'm too tired." My spirit says, "You're not. I'm your Boss. Follow Me." Amen. See a case out there, and the doctor says, "You know that case can't get well. That case is gone." I'll look at her. I say, "That's right." But the Holy Ghost comes and gives a vision, said, "It's going to get well." Then I say, "THUS SAITH THE LORD, the man will live." And we don't walk after the things of the flesh no more. We walk after the things of the Spirit. That's right.

L-83 Now, when these stones come together... They was cut out all over the world in the different places. The wood and the... hauled down from their tall cedars of Lebanon, was cut and brought to Joppa by ox cart, and on in by so forth, by raft till they come to make the--the temple. But when they come together, no... I want you to notice. One stone was cut this way, another stone cut another way. Perhaps, when the masons were cutting them, they might've argued and fussed, and everything else, like a bunch of preachers does today, "I'm the Methodist. I'm the Church of God. Glory to God, I belong to the Assemblies. I this." You keep fussing. But remember, it's God is the One that's doing the cutting. And when this cuts this way, and one that way, they couldn't understand. But when they went to put it together, the whole thing was laying on the ground. And they put it block on block on block, and didn't have to cut no more.

L-87 I believe, one of these glorious days, when this united confederation of church goes together, and the new pope is brought out of the United States and put over there according to prophecy, then they'll form an image like unto the beast. And I tell you, the true Church of God will be drove together. The real, true believers out of Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Nazarene, Pilgrim Holiness, whatever they'll be, will go together and cemented by the love of God, that'll make the Body of the Lord Jesus Christ, all the believers. And agnostics and shallow-minded will be cast to one side; they'll go right on into the confederation of churches.

L-88 And I read the other day, even the Assemblies of God went into the confederation of churches. Oh, my. Have to deny their evangelical doctrine to do so. That's right. And all their Pentecostal signs and wonders, principle, they have to deny that to be in the confederation of churches: have to deny it, oh, brother, to have prestige. I'd rather, as I've said many times, lay on my stomach and drink branch water, and eat soda crackers, and be popular with God, and to be His servant of God; than to have the best there is this world gives if I had to compromise on my faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and His Bible. I believe This is the infallible Word of God, and every Word of It is right. Yes, sir.

L-90 Now, we'll watch in there how they was doing. They had rejected... They come, putting down their stones. And they come to a place, they found a funny-looking stone. They couldn't use that stone, said, "That stone's no good." And they kicked it off over in a weed pile somewhere. They couldn't use it. It looked funny. And they tried to put their building up. And they come around to a place, and laid all the rocks, and lay them down this way. They come to a place, and they couldn't find now no stone to hit this corner. They kept on building and building and building. And the building got up so far, it couldn't go no farther for they needed a cornerstone. They looked through all the stones, trying 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min to find a cornerstone, but they couldn't find any. And the first thing you know somebody went out in the weed pile, and the very stone they rejected was the chief cornerstone. And that's what it is today, friends. The Methodist church is all right. The Baptist church is all right. The Presbyterian church, the Pentecostal, the Nazarene, the Pilgrim Holiness, whatever it may be, they're all right. But the thing of it is, brother, they rejected the real Cornerstone. That's why the Gospel hasn't gone to all the world through powers and signs and demonstration, is because the denominations has cut out the very power of the phenomenal, saying, "The days of miracles is past. There's no such a thing as Divine healing. There's no such a thing as speaking with tongues. There's no such a thing as any of the supernatural. That was for a day gone by." And you'll find out, brother, that every one of them that does that, they lay right upon the shelf, and is no more than organizations of lodges. They have a bunch of joiners. That's right. But the Bible said, "They'd have a form of godliness, but would deny the power thereof; from such turn away."

L-93 But as churches, they find out all these denominations has tried to build. They can't build on nothing less than Jesus Christ and righteousness. And if you receive Jesus Christ, and say it's foolish... Say, "Oh, I've received Jesus." If you receive Jesus, you receive Something that tells you that this Word of God is inspired; and He's the same Lord Jesus tonight, performing and doing the very same things that He said He would do," or you haven't received the Lord Jesus. You've received some theology, but not the Lord Jesus. For when Jesus comes into your heart, there's something happened that you believe everything God says. Not only that, but you know It's so. All devils in hell couldn't shake It away from you. Why, sure, you believe It. God's done said so and that settles it. When THUS SAITH THE LORD, you bank your hopes right there. Live or die, you believe It anyhow. You're ready to seal your testimony with your blood at any time, for you believe it's the truth. You know it's the truth, for God has said so. And Something within you knows it's the truth.

L-96 But now, if you just come in from a educational standpoint, and why, you might argue this and argue that, and say, "This is not, and that's not. And we don't believe this, and we don't believe that." You know, argue. You say, "Oh, well, I can't believe in such as that." Perhaps you hit the same thing in New Albany tonight; arguing against God. Why is it?

L-97 Listen a little farther, and find out the prayer these people prayed. Said: ... Why did the heathens rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? ... truly Lord, of your son Jesus... ... grant unto thy servants... When they prayed with one accord, said: ... grant unto thy servant, that... speak--speak the Word of God with boldness, By stretching forth the hand of your son, Jesus, to heal the sick...

L-99 Amen. God help us to have a prayer meeting like that. And when they had prayed, the building was shook where they were assembled together. Oh, my. That's what we need tonight, men and women with one heart and one accord like they was. They don't pay no attention to this or that, or the other thing, but you're lost in Christ Jesus. My hopes is built on nothing less than Jesus Blood and righteousness. Whether the sun comes up tomorrow, whether it doesn't, we bind ourselves together with a oath before God, that we'll serve the Lord Jesus and walk in His footsteps, regardless of the price. Then you'll find a church moving on. Amen. Said: Neither is there salvation in any other name: for there's no other--other name under heaven given among men, whereby you must be saved.

L-100 A certain little lady that comes to this church, she isn't a member here. She's a Methodist, but she loves us. And she come to the church. And another lady said, "Where you going to church?" Called her up... I heard this. Said, "Where, where you going to church?" Said, "I'm going up to the Branham Tabernacle." She said, "You mean to go up there and hear that kind of doctrine, be setting under such as that?" 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min Said, "What kind of Doctrine?" "Well, they brag too much about Jesus, about baptizing, using His Name in baptism, use His Name in everything else." For the Bible said, my brethren, "There's no other Name under heaven given among men, whereby that you might be saved." Certainly. I'll tell you, brother, I--I'm not a fusser. But I'd like to see any man, anywhere, any time, by the Bible, prove that isn't right. That's right. No matter what they say, "You're crazy," and everything else; doesn't make any difference.

L-106 Standing in a bookstore, the other day, where I was going to buy some books, and a lady said, "I wouldn't have them on my shelf. I don't sell them." Said, "One lady come by and bought them all out." She had seven, and this lady bought all them. I guess she just wanted to get rid of them. And there was... The subject come up about Divine healing. There stood two Methodist preachers, and a Presbyterian. The Methodist preachers, and Presbyterian preacher was taking up for me. Said, "You're right." When I went to leave I wondered what... Brother Shire was standing present the same time. Brother Creech came in at the same time. When they all begin to move down, and begin to move around there a little bit, this Methodist preacher walked over and put his hands on my shoulder. He said, "Brother Branham, when you wasn't nothing but a kid, I come out on where you climbed up on a pole working with a pair of spurs on and dirty face." And said, "I knowed you taught Divine healing. And my poor old mother was laying in there with a kidney disease. It would never get well. She was laying dying. And you come in and took off your spurs and tools, and knelt in the floor and prayed for my mother. A week from then, the doctor pronounced her perfect, well." Said, "That's been twenty-three years ago, and she's perfectly sound and well yet today. I don't care whether it's my church or what it is; I believe." Hallelujah. There it is.

L-109 "Upon this rock I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell can't prevail against It." Times may come and go, and things may change, but the Gospel of Jesus Christ will remain the same through all ceaseless ages. "Upon this rock I'll build My Church." What was that Church? What rock was it? You ask the Catholic church. They say, "It was a big rock laying there. The Catholic church, the hierarchy sets on it, tonight, 'upon this rock,' giving powers out to other churches, forgiving sins." That's in the Catholic definition. If you come to find out, ask the Protestant, say, "What was that rock?" They'd say, "That was Jesus Christ, is the rock." Oh, brother.

L-114 What did Jesus say about it? Peter said... "Who do you say..." He said, "Who do you say I am?" He wasn't talking about Himself. He said, "Who do you say that I am?" "Some said, 'You're Moses,' and some say, 'You're Elijah." "But who do you say?" Peter said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." He said, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hasn't revealed this to you. You never took some man's theology about it. You never learned it in a seminary. But My Father, which is in heaven, has revealed it to you. And upon this rock..." Hallelujah. What rock? The spiritual revelation of God manifests Himself to the individual. Hallelujah. "Upon this rock I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell can't prevail against It."

L-116 When a man's ever born truly of the Spirit of God, and from the crown of his head to the ends of his toe nails, he's been changed by the resurrection power of the Lord Jesus Christ, and his own selfish ideas have faded away, and God has got complete control of that man, he will believe every written Word of the Lord Jesus Christ and practice the same. "Upon this rock I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell can't prevail against It." Amen. That would make you feel religious, wouldn't it? Sure would. This is the stone that was set at nought of you builders... And neither is there salvation in any other name, than this Name of the Lord Jesus... And the Bible said here, that, "They perceived that they were ignorant and unlearned." "What school did they come from? A bunch of nitwits come out there. Well, who's this bunch of illiterate, illiterate and unlearned? Well, the men don't even know their ABC's. Well, look at the language they're using, 'Hit, and hain't, and ain't, and tote, and fetch, and perish.' What kind of a--what kind of a people is this? Why, what seminary did you come 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min out of? You're Doctor who?" See? But they had to take knowledge of them, for they perceived that they had been with Jesus.

L-120 That's the main thing, brother. If you don't know coffee from split beans, if you know the Lord Jesus Christ and the power of His resurrection, I'd rather have it than any...?... Yes, sir. Oh, my. God, anchor me there. Let me rest beneath the Tree, Where the fountain so free flows by, Where the Lamb is the Light, And the soul of the saved never die. (Let me anchor there. Oh, my, my. Let me sit down by the evergreen tree when this life's journey is over.) Oh, covet not this world's vain riches, That so rapidly decay, Seek to gain those Heavenly treasures, They will never pass away! Hold to God's unchanging hand! Hold to His unchanging hand! (That's right.) When this journey is completed, If to God you have been true, Fair and bright your home in Glory, Your enraptured soul shall view.

L-122 One of these nights, or one of these mornings, or one of these middays, your soul's going to pull from your body like a tooth being extracted. You're walking on brittle threads that might break through at any time. But what do I care? What do you care? For He will lift him up with His everlasting wings. He will catch him. When that soul breaks out of here, there'll be Someone standing at the end of the road (my, my,) to bear him up and undergird him with His everlasting arms, and take him down through the valley of the shadow of death, to present him yonder faultless and blameless before the Father. So why would we worry? Why would we care about what the world's got to say, or what this, that, or the other? As long as we got God's unchanging hand in our own, what do we care for?

L-123 Let the people, let everybody, let men and women, let children, let everybody here who don't know the Lord Jesus Christ, give me a reason why you shouldn't serve Him. Give me a reason why that you'd let this Christmas pass by without accepting the Lord Jesus Christ. Stop thinking about this thing or that thing. Stop thinking about whether "I should do this or do that?" I'm asking you one solid thing: Have you believed on the Lord Jesus Christ? If you truly believe, I'll prove by the Bible that you have Everlasting Life and cannot perish. "He that heareth My Words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, has Everlasting Life." When Jesus Christ spoke those Words... When Peter spoke them, on the day of Pentecost... When Jesus spoke them right here in Saint John 5... When they spoke, all through the Bible, man has twisted it, and mingled it, and tried to do this with it, and make this, to bring up organizations and everything.

L-125 Some of them have said, "Yes, just believe that He's the Lord Jesus Christ, and come in. That's all." See the trick of the devil? One said, "Oh, brother, we got so happy we shouted." See the trick of the devil? One said, "We spoke with tongues, and we know we got It." See the trick of the devil? Those things are all right, but it still isn't Christ. There you are.

L-126 When a man's really, thoroughly believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, he has Everlasting Life the minute he believes. That's right. When you believe, your life will tell what you are. Your life from then will take place. All these things like shouting, and rejoicing, and speaking with tongues, and healing the sick, and all these other gifts and things, they'll not be because you done that. It'll follow you with a true sign of God. See? Oh, "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and His righteousness; other things will be added."

L-128 When I think of this failing world, and I look around and see the handwriting on the wall, on every nation, I see 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min the atomic bombs got the people shaking, when great rulers and things... You ought to read what they say in the Pentagon about these things coming to pass. You ought to see what this nation... Brother, let me tell you something, we're putting a big, bold front up, but right down at the core of this nation they're frantically scared. You know it. Might as well admit the truth. And you've got a right to be scared. There's only one person that has no right at all to be scared; that's a man or a woman that's born of the Spirit of God. The atomic bomb is a heaven-bound ticket to the believer. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Death can't do nothing for you, but... A quick death is a quick glory. That's right. This robe of flesh I'll drop, And rise and seize the everlasting prize, And shout while passing through the air, "Farewell, farewell," sweet hour of prayer.

L-130 Gone... What will a atomic bomb mean to these old gray-headed saints, a young man and woman again? What will atomic bomb mean to these homes, and all of them's gone on nearly, and they're left here alone? All the family together again... Glory to God, brother. What could you have any more greater than that, with the perfect assurance that your heart is resting yonder in Calvary, that there's nothing in the world can stir you, change you, shake you? You're in Christ Jesus, anchored away in the Kingdom of God until the day of your redemption to be presented faultless before Him. Not what you done, "If--if I can just quit this, and if I can just quit that." It's nothing that you've done. It's what He does for you. Do you believe with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind?

L-132 When Peter was going on a little, I mean... Philip, when he was going to baptize the eunuch... He said, "Here's water, what hinders me from being baptized?" Peter... Philip said, "Wait a minute. If thou believest with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, if you believe It." He said, "I believe, with all my heart, soul, and mind, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." Stopped the chariot, down in the water, baptized him, and the Holy Ghost caught Philip out of his sight till he didn't even see no more, and took him through space for about two hundred miles and set him down and started a revival again. That's right. That's right. Oh, my. That God that lived in that day is the same God today.

L-136 When I think of Paul out there on the ship that night, all hopes was gone they'd ever be saved. The little old ship was water-logged, and she was in an awful fix. All hopes, everybody give up. And Paul setting down there in the gallery that night, probably praying, the Angel of the Lord come to him, said, "Don't be afraid, Paul. Don't be afraid, for I will bring you before Caesar. You've got to testify there. And I've give you everyone that sails with you." I can see Paul run up there on the ship, and shake his little old hand, and holler, "Hallelujah," holler, "Wait a minute, brothers. Wait a minute." They said, "Uh-oh, some man's done went so frantic he's lost his mind." There you are. And all the Doctors of Divinity come out to see what was the matter. Said, "Be of a good courage. Be of a good courage." Said, "Poor fellow, he's gone crazy there. There it is. He's been fasting so long. He's done all this, and he's just about gone now." Said, "Be of a good courage, for there stood by me last night the Angel of God, Whose servant I am, saying, 'Don't you fear, Paul, but you must be brought before Caesar. And lo, God's give you all those who sail with you.'" Said, "Howbeit the ship must be wrecked upon a certain island, for I seen it in a vision. But I believe God, that it shall be just as He showed it to me." And it happened word by word by word, just exactly. That's right.

L-142 Now, then I want you to notice a little something, so you can see on the other side, a view of it. Look. When they let the boats down and started to slip off, Paul said, "The only way that you can be saved is to remain on this boat." You had to do it according to THUS SAITH THE LORD. The Lord had give a vision, but it had to be done according to His way. 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min

L-143 And when God gives a pattern of the Holy Ghost church, brother, and how to bring this thing out of chaos... You can have big-fours, and pentagons, and everything you want to have; you can ordain churches and ministers, and make theology and educate them. It'll never be done till the people comes back again to God's eternal way, and receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and go forth, preaching, with signs and wonders accompanying their ministry. It'll never be done anything less than that. God's got the program, but you've got to come to the program. O God, help us tonight, Brother Neville. Help us tonight to believe that, is my prayer. "For there is salvation in no other name, but in the Name of the Lord Jesus."

L-146 Now, as we're approaching Christmas time now, and here the things are decorated all up with Santa Claus instead of Jesus... They don't even spell it any more. "X-m-a-s," they don't even spell "Christ" in Christmas any more. They put up... Why, the people never--never even think about the birth or anything of Christ, what it's really for. Only thing they think about is Santa Claus took its place. And instead of rejoicing under the Spirit of God, they go out and get drunk and rejoice. See? That's what makes the difference.

L-147 So after all, brother, sister, I can't stop that. You can't stop it. God's Word said it would be that way. "Men will be lovers of pleasure, more than lovers of God." How you going to break that down? "Having a form of godliness," every one of them goes to church. Yes, sir. "Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof; from such turn away." I'm so happy tonight, Christian friend, that I'm here with you tonight. I'm so happy that I--I've had the privilege of speaking to you, with my heart. And my whole heart is wrapped in this Message. It's been there since the very day that God give me the baptism of the Holy Ghost, right here in Jeffersonville, Indiana, when I believed on His Son, Jesus Christ, and accepted Him out here in a little old shed as my personal Saviour. And the Lord coming down upon me that night, throwed a Light across that room, and I looked at It, so scared I couldn't even move. Knelt on an old grass sack down there on Ohio Avenue, and I seen that Light form a cross, and Something on that cross speaking at me. Since that night, my hopes has been built on nothing less than the Word of God and Jesus Christ and righteousness. That's where I believe with all my heart. Let go what come, what may; my hope still anchors right there. And I'm glad tonight to be setting in a company like this, that believes the same thing, and has received the same Lord Jesus Christ. Through years, through many dangers, toils and snares, I have already come; It's aged me. It's broke me. It's peeled me down. But it's grace that's brought me safe thus far, It's grace that'll take me on. And when we've been there ten thousand years, Bright shining as the sun; We'll have no less days to sing God's praise Than the hour we first begun.

L-151 When Daniel saw a vision of that, and he said, "Though that they do wicked, shall do wickedly in the last days; but they that know their God shall do exploits in the last days," speaking of this time. Know what "exploits" is? Exploits of faith will perform signs and wonders. "But the wicked will still continue do wicked." Said, "They'll run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase." But said, "Close up the Book, oh, Daniel. Thou shall sleep in thy lot, but thou shall stand in that last day. And they that be wise shall then turn many to Christ. They shall shine as the stars of heaven forever and ever."

L-152 Forty years has broke me to pieces. Eighty years maybe has broke you to pieces. Maybe thirty years has made a different person out of you, just a little snap of time like that. But did you ever look out at the morning star when she rises in the morning? Did you ever rise up early and look at it hanging yonder in the skies, when she's a glistening and a shouting, and rejoicing in the sky? She's never lost one speck 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min of its beauty. It's just as bright and pretty as it was the day He hung it, God hung it in its orbit. It's never lost any of its time. And it's been there through thousands times thousands of years, and it's never lost its beauty. And the Bible says, "They that turn many to righteousness shall outshine the stars forever and ever." Hallelujah. Brother, it's a good thing to be a preacher after all. Isn't it? Yes, it is. It's a good thing to be a Christian.

L-155 Times may be hard. God has not promised a flower bed of ease, but He's promised grace sufficient for every trial that can hit you. That's right. Yes indeed, grace is sufficient. Not he's on a flower, flower bed of ease, but He's promised grace to overcome in every temptation. When a cross gets heavy, Christ promised to be with you. Yes, sir. Some glorious day, when it's all over, we'll meet Him in peace. God, grant that every one of you will receive the same thing.

L-157 If there's an unbeliever here tonight, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ; and the minute you believe, God will give you the witness of it. He will seal you into His Kingdom forever. And if there's anything knocking at your heart, and you feel it, and you refuse to receive it, you'll be a miserable man and woman until you say, "Yes, Lord Jesus." And may you, through this coming week, this Christmas yuletide, as everybody is happy and singing one to another; may you, with arms... like Simeon of old, when that wonderful Christmastide, when he walked down through the temple, and with his strong arms, oh, picked up the Saviour in his arms and embraced Him, and said, "Lord, let Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy Word, for my eyes have seen Your salvation." May you, with arms of faith, likewise, this Christmas, embrace not a Santa Claus, or not exchange a present; but may you invite and embrace in your heart with arms of faith the same Lord Jesus that Simeon held in his arms years ago. And He will bless you and give you Eternal Life. And you cannot perish, because you've got the Life of God in you.

L-159 You know what the word... Not go into Greek things. That's to be talked amongst people who talks Greek things. We don't talk Greek things here. We talk Jesus Christ in this tabernacle. We don't come with swelling words here. We come here with knowing nothing but the power of the resurrection of Christ. But the very word, Greek word, means "Eternal Life." The same Greek word in the translation... I got the Hebrew and the Greek, both, and I studied it. I'm not a scholar in it. I just know a few words, just something to help me out. When somebody goes to fussing, I know how to cut them off at it. But when it comes to a place like this, that when... That same Greek word that speaks of God's Life, speaks of the same Life that He gives you. And the, both Greek words, as the Life of God or Eternal Life, is pronounced Zoe, Z-o-e, Zoe, "Life." "And all that comes to Me, I will give them Zoe, My Own Life; will give them My Own Life, and they shall never perish. And I'll raise them up at the last day." In other words, "Every one that comes to Me, I'll wrap him in Me." Amen. "And he will become a part of Me. And he can no more die than I can die, for I'm immortal and can't die; and his soul's immortal and can't die. And I'll raise him up again at the last day." Hmm. Oh, my.

L-161 Then that just makes us, when the old trials get hard, say, "In me dwelleth the Spirit of God. There's good thing in here but Him that's in there. I'm not my own; I'm His. I don't look for the things of the world. I look for Him, for my hopes is built on Him. Someday I shall see Him, and that's all I've longed for. What I live for is to bring people to Him." And I tell you, the old shackles begin to drop off, and you start walking anew again.

L-162 God bless you. I hope that you believe with all your heart, while we pray. Heavenly Father, we thank Thee tonight for the Blood of Thy righteous Son, the Lord Jesus. I thank Thee tonight for the Holy Ghost, and for the visitation of Him right here in this building, and even right here now. The very Spirit, according to the Word of God which is infallible and cannot fail, the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the grave is right here in our midst now. God, may children in here that doesn't know You, may they accept it tonight, and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and have the Everlasting Life. Grant it. May they believe unto Everlasting Life, this very hour. Heal the sick and the afflicted. Remember the bereaved homes, Lord. O God, and standing around those caskets, and maybe the unsaved men and women. What can you say? And knowing that the Gospel's been preached right over them, hundreds of times and hundreds of times. O Father, I pray that men and women here will get a vision tonight, and realize that every one of us is mortal, and we don't know what time that we may be called on to answer yonder at judgment, and to give an account for what we've done with Jesus Christ. And then the case is closed; the book is closed; 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min it's laying closed, and there's nothing can be done. We've judged ourselves by judging Him. Father, oh, search my heart tonight, Lord. "Search me," said David, "and try me." Not only David, but I say the same thing. If there be any wicked way in me, Lord, take it away. God, don't let it linger around me, Lord. I don't want it. I don't want it, Father. Let it go. Not only for me, but for all these people that's here tonight, who's heard me preaching, Father. I pray that if there be any wickedness, any sin in these people here, that You'll take it all away from them, Lord. Don't let it hang around these, Your children. God, keep it away. Give them grace to overcome in every trial. Grant it, Lord. May the Seed of God, out of the basket now, take root in the hearts of the people and grow unto Everlasting Life. These blessings we ask in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Oh, I want to see Him, I want to look upon His face, There to sing forever of His saving grace; On the streets of Glory let me lift my voice; When cares all past, home at last, ever to rejoice. As I travel through this land, singing as I go, Pointing souls to Calvary, to Thy crimson flow, Oh, many arrows pierce my soul from without, within; But my Lord leads me on, through Him I must win. Oh, I want to see Him, look upon His face, There to sing forever of His saving grace; On the streets of Glory let me lift my voice; Cares all past, home at last, ever to rejoice.

L-168 Oh, I want to sing some of these days. I believe the Lord's going to let me sing some of these days. Yes. When I get across the river (That's right.), when I've crossed the other side, maybe not on this side... I can't sing. But you know what song I'm going to sing? There's nothing between my soul and the Saviour, Naught of this world's delusive dream; I have renounced all sinful pleasure, Jesus is mine, there's nothing between.(Oh, my!) ... between my soul and the Saviour, Naught of this world's delusive dream; I have renounced all sinful pleasure, Jesus is mine, there's nothing between. How many can sing that tonight, as a testimony with their hand up? Nothing between my soul and the Saviour, Naught of this world's delusive dream; I have renounced all sinful pleasure, Jesus is mine, there's nothing between.

L-170 Doesn't that make you feel wonderful? "He that heareth My Word, and believeth on Him that sent Me has Everlasting Life; shall never come into condemnation, but has already passed from death unto Life." Here we are tonight, with our hands up, sing, "I have renounced all sinful pleasure. Jesus is mine; there's nothing between. My job, my friends, my loved ones, my people, my wife, my children, anything there is upon this earth, no matter whatever it is, nothing between my soul and the Saviour. Jesus is mine; there is nothing between. All other things are secondary." Isn't that marvelous?

L-172 Some of these mornings when you hear somebody singing "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound," when you done crossed over the River, you know... Got over There and done turned back to a young man and woman, meeting all your young folks there, you know, and your loved ones, your father and mother, shaking hands with them, saying, "Oh, mother, it's so good to see you again. Well, look yonder, will come Brother John. Here comes Brother Joe here. Well, 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min looky here, aren't we having a good time." And a way back over the hill over there somewhere, you hear somebody singing, "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me." Run up the top of the hill and look over, you see that little cabin over there in the corner, Brother Branham will be standing out there singing, "Amazing Grace." You say, "Well, glory to God. He got home. There he is, singing, "Amazing Grace." Oh, my. Amazing Grace! how sweet the sound, That saved a wretch like me! I once was lost, but now I'm found, I was blind, but now I... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-176 ...?... by grace way before the world was formed, God speaking to His Angelic Beings, said, "I'll have someone named William Branham preaching the Gospel." It's grace that taught my heart to fear, It's grace my fears relieved; How precious did that grace appear The hour... (Now, what?) first believed! Oh, how I love Jesus, Oh, how I love Jesus, Oh, how I love Jesus, Because He first loved me. I'll never forsake Him, I'll never forsake Him, I'll never forsake Him, Because He first loved me. I've got a Father over yonder, I've got a Father over yonder, I've got a Father over yonder, On the other shore. Oh, some bright day I'll go and meet Him, Some bright day I'll go and meet Him, Some bright day I'll go and meet Him, On the other shore. Oh, won't that be a happy meeting! Won't that be a happy meeting! Won't that be a happy meeting! Upon the other shore. Well, that bright day may be tomorrow, That bright day may be tomorrow, That bright day may be tomorrow, On the other shore.

L-177 Won't that be wonderful? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] I like "Father." My Father is rich with houses and lands, He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hand! Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold His coffers are full, He has riches untold. I'm a child of the King! A child of the King! With Jesus my Saviour, 54-1219E, Acts Of The Holy Spirit, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 63 min I'm the child of the King! A tent or a cottage, why should I care? They're building a palace for me over There! Though exiled from home, but still I can sing: Oh, glory to God, I'm the child of the King! I'm a child of the King! I'm a child of the King! With Jesus Christ my Saviour, I'm a child of the King!

L-178 Our heavenly Father, as our hearts are moved by these old hymns that was penned by the Holy Spirit many, many years ago when brethren that's gone on had caught the vision. We love them, for they give us a solid foundation through these troublesome times. God, grant tonight that all sin will be taken from us now. As we're entering Christmas time, take sin away, take sickness away, Lord. God, bless the needy tonight everywhere, for we ask in Jesus' Name.

L-179 And there's people now that would like to slip up to the altar to be anointed and prayed for. You may come while we hum this song, "Child Of The King," again. See? If there's anyone desiring...
