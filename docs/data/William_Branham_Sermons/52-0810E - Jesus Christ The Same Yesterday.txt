--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Thank you, Brother Frank...?... God bless you. Good evening, friends. Very happy to be here, thanking God for the opportunity of being here, for His mercy, for all that He has did for us. We pray that the meeting will leave an attribute that the revival will never cease until Jesus Christ comes again. That is our deep sincere prayer. May the Lord bless each one of you richly, and give to you the exceedingly abundantly above all that you could do or think. May the Lord give it to you is my sincere prayer. And I--I was kinda watching. That's all right. That's okay, just...?... I'm not shy of camera's, but the reason they don't... ask them not to take it after the healing service starts... Now, any other night would've been all.. See? Now, that's all right. Take as many as you wish. I'm... Anybody thinks enough of me to take a picture of me, while I was... You see? That's all right. I appreciate that. But sometimes when the meeting is going on, when the prayer line is a moving (You see?), that's the thing that... The Angel of the Lord when He comes near, It's a Light. And I watch It flash sometimes over the audience (You see?), and a--and a camera sometimes disturb me. See? When I see that same type of flash, I--I look (You see?), to watch where He's moving. He will leave me and go out there in the audience, and I'll watch Him stand over someone. It's just like a light. When the light flashes like that, that kinda upsets me, a little (You see?), when it's not Him. But, that's okay. That's all right.

L-2 If the good Lord willing, we're going over to Battle Creek. How long we'll be there, I don't know. That'll be up to God, anywhere from one night until Jesus comes. I don't know. It's just a set meeting. And wherever He says go, we may be there one night; we may be there two nights. We may be there five nights; we may be there five weeks. I don't know. I never intend to have any routine drawed out, set out: just what the Lord leads, that's what we do. See? I think that's better. I've already found that it's better. But I do want to say this. With all my heart, I trust that God will let me come back to Chicago, to unite with you grand bunch of Christian people for a revival for months to come. I think... I pray that He will. Will you be praying to that end, that we can get an auditorium somewhere, that it won't be just two or three nights, just so we can set it for weeks, or whatever it is, and from that one to another, way the Lord leads. I've always wanted to come to Chicago. And a great respects of great men, Moody... Paul Rader and many others, in the days before our ministry. And I... Chicago really hasn't had a shaking since then. And it really needs a shaking. And it takes the--it takes the supernatural to do it. And so, if the good Lord would happen to tell me to come to Chicago, like He's sending me to--to India, then He will do it. But if I come within myself, I'd miss it. You see? That's my way. But God's way is a different way. God does all things perfect. Anything that man does, any covenant, or anything else that man enters in with to God, he always breaks it. But when God does it, it's His grace, it's His power. See? God always...

L-3 In the garden of Eden, He told man, He made a covenant with man not to eat of that tree. But they did it anyhow. But then after that, He said, "I will put enmity." See? "I will." That covenant doesn't break. That's what God did. See? And He turned men and women back to the dust of the earth, from where they come. They go right back. And someday He's promised to redeem that again to its original state. He will do it. Now, God will do it. And that's what we're all striving for, for the good of salvation to lost souls. And now, I wish to... And sick bodies, I may say. I believe the full Gospel is both for soul and body. See? I don't believe now... Someone was talking here not long ago, said, "Brother Branham, do you tell me that you believe that Divine healing is in the atonement?" I said, "Yes, sir." Yes, sir. And it happened to be a good Baptist brother of mine. 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min He said, "Do you mean?" Said, "Brother Branham, if Divine healing is in the atonement, where do you allow it? To Isaiah?" I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Oh, no." Said, "I can prove that's wrong." I said, "All right." He said, "Isaiah, prophesied, He took our infirmities, and so wounded for our transgressions, and with His stripes we're..." Said, "In Matthew 8, it says that He took on Himself our infirmities to fulfill that which was spoke of." Said, "He fulfilled it then."

L-4 I said, "My brother, if He did that to fulfill what Isaiah said, He fulfilled the atonement before the atonement was made. A year and six months before He ever died, or bled for the atonement. See?" I said, "Then what... After that what did Peter, James, and John and all the rest of them heal by? After that, what was that in?" Said, "They were just twelve chosen." I said, "Now, brother... Just twelve given that power?" I said, "Oh, no." I said, "You think Philip was one of them? Was he one of the apostles?" No, sir, he was a deacon. And he went down through Samaria and he healed the sick, and devils screamed, and they had a real revival. Is that right? He wasn't one of the twelve." That's right. And Jesus on His last commission, said, "To all the world," with it. That's right.

L-5 So, he said, "Well if they... Look here, Brother Branham." Said, "If you would teach Divine healing in the atonement," he said, "there would be no more pain. There is no pain, if you teach Divine healing in the atonement." I said, "Now," I said, "do you believe salvation's in the atonement?" "Yes." I said, "Is there temptation?" There you are. Yeah. "Is there temptation?" "Oh, yes, you can be temptation, but His grace is sufficient." I said, "Yes, there's pain, but His grace is sufficient." That's right. His grace is sufficient. So it's strange how smart men can sometimes get off the tract isn't it?

L-6 The other day I heard a man preaching, one of the most brilliant preachers, pretty near compare with Brother Baxter. Now you see what I think of Brother Baxter. I think he's a real preacher. And I believe you'll agree with me. That's right. And he had a very fine sermon. And then he got on Divine healing. He said, "Sickness is of God." He said, "No matter what we do, we must embrace sickness, and say, 'Oh, that's right, Lord.'" Said, "Then we spit dust in the devil's face by doing that." Said, "When you have arthritis, and rheumatism, and things. Say, 'I love you, arthritis,' or so forth, 'the Lord gave it to me. You see?'" Oh, my. I'd imagine, just to make a long story short, that same man would get appendicitis, he'd go to the hospital and have it cut out. And if appendicitis is a blessing, why go have it cut out? Don't cut the blessing out; leave it alone; go ahead and die with it. See? So we--we see that that's wrong. See?

L-7 No, every one of them that says that, rushes to the hospital as hard as they can when they get sick. They get out here in an accident, and break their leg, or something another, away to the hospital right quick. First thing you know, as soon as they get a little cramp in their stomach, call the doctor. Well, if it's a blessing, why, do something to... Well, then, every medicine, every hospital, everything else, every remedy on the earth is a curse to God then. See? Wouldn't that be horrible? My. See? So, you can just get a little too far, on either side of the road, don't you believe so? I believe in an old fashion, godly-sent message, right straight down through the middle of the road. The isms is on both sides. That's right. He said, "There'll be a highway." And a lot of people say, "That's the highway of holiness." Huh-uh. The Bible said, "There shall be a highway, and ('and' is a conjunction) and a way, and it shall be called, the way of holiness (not the highway), the way of holiness." That's the middle of the road, the way in the highway. The Lord bless you. 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min

L-8 Brother Baxter just told me, he'd taken an offering for me, a few minutes ago, a love offering. Some of that is a portion of your living, something that you was to live on yourself, something that God gave you, and you divided it with me. I love you for it. I thank you for it. And I pray that God will repay it to you a hundredfold. And I believe that He said in the Scripture, "Insomuch as you have done it unto the least," that would be me, "of my little ones, you have done it unto Me." And may that blessing return. "If you receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet," you receive... whatever, "if you just receive one of these little ones, only in the name of a disciple, you'll not lose your reward." And now, in that what I have to have to make my living, and just handkerchiefs, and aprons, and things, that I--I send out and anoint thousands a week, going all over the world... Now, I'll have to use some of it on that, because there's not enough money comes in into my office there in letters, to take care of it. It's an awful expense. And I have to use that. Outside of that, I put it right over in missionary offering, go right straight to Africa and India, where I have a vision to go and preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the unsaved. And then, at the day of rewards are given out, God standing there, I hope I'm standing near with my hands up screaming, to see Him place the crown upon your head. And be crowned as His jewels in His Kingdom. The Lord bless you now.

L-9 We're glad to be here. God bless Brother Boze. And he tried faithfully. Now, you members here, I know you're not all members here, but, he--he certainly did his part to get us to come here to Chicago. He went to expense. He called; he prayed; he... This little church went to prayer and everything to get us to come here, for this purpose, that we might come to represent Jesus Christ to this community. A man, and a church with that much sincerity, the community is indebted to visit them people, and talk with them, and pray with them, and to be their brothers and sisters. That's right. See? It wasn't for their good. It's for the good of the community and everybody around. Now that's very nice. That's real Christian gentlemen. The Lord bless them richly is my prayer. And now, someday if the Lord is willing, I will return to Chicago for a few months to hold a revival. Now, all right. See? I was just waiting for the photographer, making those little remarks until he come, so they could get the picture 'fore I broke in on my service.

L-10 Now, while he's making ready, I suppose, Brother Baxter whispered to me, he and the boy there, and telling me to hold off just a few minutes, on account of the... That's why I wanted to talk like this to you. And now, you pray for Brother Boze, for all these other ministers. And live true to your church, if you go to a real good Gospel, full Gospel church, you live just as true to God... You don't have to live true to the church, if you live true to God, you will be true to the church. See? We believe God is in His Word. And the Word is in us. That makes God in us. Is that right? If I become a son of God, if I become a son of God, I am an offspring of God.

L-11 I have a little blond-headed girl setting back there of six years old. She's my sweetheart. And you know what? You--you couldn't hurt that child without hurting me. See, that's my baby. See? I love her. And I got another little fellow at home, just about--a little over a year old, she's just trying to talk. And she really makes a try. And she goo-goo, gaa-gaa, just as hard as she can. But you couldn't--you couldn't hurt that little child without hurting me. See? And if you love... I'd rather you'd love that child, than to love me. If there had to be love for one or the other, you love my child instead of me. And I think any fatherhood's like that.

L-12 And what is fatherhood? Is an attribute of God. Then if we be God's children, then God wants us to love one another. In doing so, we love God. Is that right? We love His Church. All right. Are they just about, [A man says, "Yeah. They are over there."--Ed.] All right, sir. I guess they're... [A man speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] That's all right. Now, just... waiting just a moment to get the--the pictures taken for in there (You see?), and going into the service. Now, how many of you are expecting our Lord Jesus to do a great work with His people here tonight? Let's see your 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min hand. How many of you is praying? Let's see your hand. Now, if you'll pray, if you'll pray, and believe with all your heart, just the simple story of the appearing of this supernatural One... And as I was trying to speak this afternoon, you'll draw from It, when you believe in It. Is that right? If Jesus was standing here, the Son of God, He could do no more for you than what He can right now, when you believe it, when you believe it. Faith...

L-13 Some of them come up to Jesus, one time... Do you believe He was a Prophet? Well, they put a rag around His face one day, and smote Him on the head, and said, "If You be a Prophet, tell us who--who hit you, and then we'll believe you." Jesus didn't clown for no one. He had the will of the Father to do. But yet, He stood and told a woman her sins. He told... He knowed where there was a fish at had a coin in its mouth. He knew where two mules was hitched, where two ways met. Is that right? See? He knew those things, but He didn't clown it for people. See? It was too Divine. It's the Father's will. And now, tonight you might be setting there just for curiosity, and saying, "Well, Brother B... I--I just wish you'd turned around tell me something." God will never do that.

L-14 But you get real deeply sincere, and say, "Dear Lord, You know my condition. And that would help my faith so much if You'd just have our brother just turn around here and say something to me. Let it appear a vision by me, that he will tell me, and--and let me see what's going be my outcome and what my conditions is. Then our heavenly Father, will grant that to you. See? Anywhere in the meeting, any place, He will do it. Be sincere. I can't make Him. I can only ask Him. Are you ready now? All right. Excuse me, just a moment...?...

L-15 I said, "I love them too." So that goes for all Chicago. The grace of God be on you all now. Now, it is my humble part in the ministry of Jesus Christ to pray for the sick people. I have tried to be loyal to the heavenly vision, and to do just as He told me to do. Now, tonight I want to read just a--a two or three places in the Scripture here, and then we're going to start right in praying for the sick; because we're just a little late to get started, I guess. And so, we're going to start right away, right now. In the 5th chapter of Saint John, if you want to mark it down to the closing of our services, that I... And then I want to read, also, another read a first few verses of that. Then I want to read over in John 16 again. And upon, while you're getting your things ready, I want to ask you something. In Hebrews 13:8, the Bible said that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do you believe that's inspired?

L-16 I believe that that is the truth, that at the judgment day, that God will see that that is the truth. God will stand behind what He says to be truth. Don't you believe it? All right. And now, let's just wonder what type of a Person Jesus was. Now, I know we have some theological ideas, and some painters that's painted pictures. But let's not look at Him in the picture form tonight, 'cause we might not know. But let's look at Him in His life, His Spirit. So Jesus, when He comes back to earth again in His body form, it'll be way too late then for us to think anything about it. You believe that? We're going with Him then, those that are ready. So now when we see Him in body form, no matter whether He's a--a white Man, a yellow Man, or black Man, brown Man, whatever He is, He's my Saviour. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... little Man, a fat Man, a thin Man, He's my Saviour. See? I love Him. I love Him, so much. And I love Him with all my heart. And now, He... But what He was, it wasn't so much as the flesh, but the flesh was wonderful. It was virgin borned. You believe that? I believe that Almighty God overshadowed the virgin Mary and created a Blood cell in the womb of Mary.

L-17 The--the germ of life, to the child, comes from the male sex, we know that, don't we? It's like a hen can lay an egg, but if she hasn't been with the male bird, it's not fertile. See? It won't hatch. The germ of life comes from the male. So the germ of Life in this case, come from Jehovah God, the Father of Jesus Christ, the great Creator. You believe that? And He created in the womb of this little virgin girl, a Blood cell that developed into the Son of the living God. He wasn't Jew, neither was He Gentile. He was God. See? Did you ever think about that? The baby hasn't got one drop of the mother's blood in it. Did you know that? No, sir. A baby does not have any bit of its mothers blood. It has its father blood; not its mothers. A babe... A mother can be 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min dying with TB, and the baby can be taken from the mother, and it'd have to be contracted (You see?), anything that's in the blood stream (See?), because the blood comes from the male.

L-18 And Jesus was the Blood of God. If His Blood was earthly, then it was no more than mine or yours. It come through sexual desire. But His Blood was the Blood of His Father, which is the great Creator, Jehovah. Some fellow told me sometime ago; he said, "Brother Branham," he said, "you don't really believe that that true--that is the truth?" It was a rancher I hunt with a whole lot out in Colorado. I said, "Yes, sir." I just met him. He said, "Look," he argued with me for about two hours; he said, "you know that that's wrong." I said, "No, sir, I don't. I know that's right." And he said, "Look, it's against all scientific research." He said, "There's nothing. See, nothing can poll-without--without nothing can bear without pollen, like that." Said, "Even corn has to poll from the tassel, and so forth." Said, "Everything," said, "is against all scientific..."

L-19 I said, "I don't care." I said, "I've been in these museums like you got here in Chicago, and I think it's ridiculous. Go down there and say two hundred and twenty-five thousand years ago, man li... in Paris...?..." There wasn't a man on earth till six thousand years ago. That's right. That's according to the Bible. And all that, that cave stuff, that's just something got up in somebody's head, somewhere. There's not a bit of Scripture to it. There's not a... not right at all. And man never come from no serpent, or monkey, or nothing. He come from God. That's right. See? So that's just radical. It's a good thing you all can have up here. Down where the Southern line, we don't have it down there. We won't permit it. All right. But there you are...?... And all those things.

L-20 He said, "Look preacher!" He said, "It's impossible, absolutely impossible." I said, "Sir, do you know there's nothing impossible with God?" He said, "I don't believe there is such a thing." And he... I said, "Oh, my." I said, "How did this creation come here?" Said, "It just come here." I said, "I guess then when you was born, the bed just supposed to set there, and the chair just supposed to be there." I said, "I guess, this watch just absolutely happened to be a watch, that's all there was to it." He said, "Oh, no. That's not sensible."

L-21 I said, "Just as much sense as you're talking." I said, "It's absolutely impossible for that watch to be, its jewels, its regulation, and everything. There had to be a mastermind behind it to put together." Is that right? Well, how much greater, am I, or you, than that watch? See? So there's got to be a Masterpiece behind it. Is that right? And he said... I said, "I want to ask you a question, and we'll quit arguing." I said, "You say it's totally impossible for a baby to be born on this earth, unless having an actual... a father and a mother." He said, "That's right." I said, "You will admit that Jesus, Mary was His mother, but you say Joseph was His father, that He could not be born without having an actual earthly father, through sex." He said, "That's exactly right."

L-22 I said, "Where did the first man come from? Who was his pappy and mammy? Let him be tadpole, serpent, ever what you want to call him, according to your statement, he had to have both father and mother." He's never answered me to this day. He can't. According to that, He had to have both father and mother. God the Creator, made man. And man fell, and then God the Creator was revealed to us in His Son Christ Jesus, and He did the will of His Father. He went about doing good. Let's look what kind of person He was now. We couldn't look for a... We read the Bible, and we find out what He looked like. He was a great Person. What He... His look like, not in His physical makeup, but what He was in His spiritual makeup. He was the Son of God. And He went around, and He healed the sick, the lame. Do you all believe He did that? Well, now. Did He do it at His leisure? I thought, I'd catch you on that, but I didn't. Good teacher, Brother Boze. Ever who's been teach... No, He 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min didn't. He said, "It's not Me that doeth the works; it's My Father." See, Him being the Son of God, did not claim to be a Divine healer. Is that right? He said, "It's the Father." No flesh glories before God. It was the Father that did it.

L-23 Now, let's read some Scripture right here about Him. And let's look back here in the Bible and see what type of a Man He was, and then if He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, we'll look for that same type of Person (Is that right?), Personality, the Spirit. Now watch. Now, here He is in Saint John 5 going up to the feast, of course: After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to the Jerusalem. Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches. In this lay great multitudes of impotent folk,... (Listen)... of blind, halt, withered... (What a mass of humanity.)... waiting the moving of the water. For an angel came down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the pool stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. ... a certain man was there, which had an infirmity for thirty and eight years. And Jesus saw him lie, and knew, that he had been now a long time in this case, and he said unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? The impotent man answered and said unto him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another comes down and steps in before me. Jesus said unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. And immediately the man made... was made whole, took up his bed, and walked: and the same was the sabbath days: And the Jews therefore said unto him that was carrying his bed, It is the sabbath day: it's not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. Now just, watch the point just a moment now. Hold that part.

L-24 Now, do you believe He was the Son of God, all of you? All right. Here He is, Emmanuel, God with us. And here He goes down to the sheep market now, which had five porches. If we had time to go into that lesson, the five porches, J-e-s-u-s, and the pool, the water, the light, so forth where the sheep market was... But when Jesus passed through there, there was a great multitudes. If I'm taught right, it takes two thousand to make a multitude and this was multitudes. Let's say for instance, between five and ten thousand people, great multitudes of impotent folks... That's helpless, lame, halt, blind, withered. Wasn't that an awful mass of humanity? Look what kind there were in: Lame, halt, blind and withered, waiting for the troubling of the waters. For an Angel came down at a certain season and troubled the water. Whosoever then, stepping in first, was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.

L-25 Now look, there laid a man out there on a pallet or a little cot, that had an infirmity for thirty and eight years. Now, here comes Jesus, coming down by this market. And as He passed through by the market, by the market, He goes down amongst these sick, crippled people. Do you believe He was kind-hearted? Do you believe He was loving? Do you believe He had compassion on the people? Then why didn't He heal all those sick people there? But instead of that, He went by the blind man. He passed by the withered man. He passed by the crippled man. He passed by the spastic child. He went over to a man that had an infirmity. Let's say sugar diabetes, something an another, didn't... He'd had it thirty-eight years. And He walked over to that man, and knew now, that he'd been a long time that way. And He said, "Will thou be made whole?" He said, "Sir," now he wasn't--he wasn't crippled, he said, "while I'm coming down to the water somebody can step in before me, and they get healed." Just only one at a time, and then the Angel, they waited again for another season, maybe, a month or whatever it was, for a certain season; He come down again. And he said, "While, I'm coming, someone else steps down ahead of me."

L-26 And Jesus said, "Take up thy bed and go into thy house. Go on," and walked right away and left that great crowd of people laying there, lame, blind, halt, withered, impotent. Is that Scripture? Well, here It is; I'm reading right off of It. 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min Walked right away from there... The Jews found Him and questioned Him. And the man that was carrying his bed they questioned him. Now, when you go home you read the whole chapter, you get the picture. To save time, I want to read the 19th and 20th verse. Here tells you why. Now, I want to ask you something 'fore we read these verses. Do you believe if Jesus would've said to that whole multitude, "I am the Son of God. I have come to do the work of the Father. The Father has given Me power to open the eyes of all you blind, to heal all you sick people, to do all this, make the lame walk, and make the withered hands come forth. I've already proved it. Now, every one of you are healed. You can go home now and be well."

L-27 I believe that every person there would've been made perfectly whole. Do you believe that? I've got you between a question now. See? If He was the Son of God, which we know He was, and He was kind-hearted and had compassion on the people, here He is. And then He refrains from telling them that. How could He be kind-hearted and full of love and compassion for the people... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Is that clear enough to you? Some of you didn't put your hands up. But I want to know why that He didn't heal those people. And turns right back around here and said, "The Son can do nothing in Himself but what He seeth the Father do. What the Father shows the Son, then the Son goes and does those things that He showed." Remember our lesson this afternoon in the sermon? Lazarus, He went on away from the home of Lazarus. Why didn't He when He come back, He said, "Our friend, Lazarus sleepeth. And for your sake, I'm glad I wasn't there. But I'll go wake him." And then when He come to the grave, look, He'd seen a vision. That's the reason He didn't go back. The Father told, it taken so many days for these things to happen, and then for Him to go back. According to what He said here, that had to be the truth. He said, "I do nothing till the Father shows Me."

L-28 And after three days, He said, "Now, Lazarus is dead. And I'm glad I wasn't there for your sake, 'cause you'd have been trying to get Me go over and heal him." See? And the Father, that wasn't the Father's will. And watch Him when He comes to the grave of Lazarus. Said, "Father, I thank Thee that Thou hearest Me already. But for these that stood by, I said it." He knew what was going to happen. You believe that? The Father had showed Him. Then He raised Lazarus from the dead. And He did nothing, except the Father showed Him. You remember the lesson the other night in Saint John, when those blind men come to Him, and He just walked on down the street, never paid any attention to them. He went into a house, and they came in the house, said, "Lord, have mercy on us."

L-29 He touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith, be it unto you." Is that right? "According to your faith be it unto you." And He touched their eyes. The men told Him, "If You will touch our eyes," in other words, "we believe." And He said, "All right." He touched their eyes, said, "Now, according to your faith, let it be unto you." And it was done. On down through the Scriptures, you can take it. Everywhere, every place... Here sometime ago, a certain man, is well-known in this congregation, well-known everywhere, around. A newspaper give a real bad write-up about me, some things that wasn't right. He said, "Brother Branham," said, "call fire of heaven down and burn that place up." I said, "Oh, brother, my." I said, Jesus said, "You don't know what spirit you are." See?

L-30 He said, "What we need today, is some more prophets like Elijah." Said, "Elijah didn't have to have any vision for anything." Said, "Glory to God," said, "he went out there and built an altar," and said, "now you come on up here." And said, "We'll prove who is God." He said, he come up there and said, "Bring your bullocks," and walked up-and-down the... Made fun of Baalim. And said, "Surely, there's a God." Walked out there, they was... Saying, "Come on." Said, "Let's see what he can do." He knew where he was. And said, "He... we need some more prophets like that today." I said, "Well, if there was any prophets, they'd be like that. But I..." 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min He said, "Elijah didn't wait to see no vision." I said, "Just a minute, Brother Lindsay," or excuse, it was Gordon Lindsay is who it was; I might as well say it. All right. I didn't aim to say that. But he said, "We need some prophets like that."

L-31 I said, "Brother Lindsay, you fail to see the Scripture." I said, "You're a teacher, but you fail to see the Scripture. When Elijah had put all these things in order, cut the bullocks up, and poured the water on, he walked out, and said, 'Lord, I've done all of this at Your command.'" Is that right? The Lord had showed him first. That's right. And no true prophet of God, as Balaam said of old, when he stood down there and he sold and commercialed his gift, that's right, but he was prophet. And he said things that sticks right today, to Israel and so forth. He was a prophet. He said, "How can a prophet speak unless God puts it in his mouth?" If he's going to be true. You've got to say what God says, and you can't say no more; you can't say no less.

L-32 And Jesus said, "I only do what the Father shows Me to do." Is that right? Now, He said, "He will show you greater than the healing of this diabetic that you might marvel. But I only do what He tells Me." Now, if He is the same, yesterday, today, and forever, then today, it's only... Now, we see what He done. And now, looky, let's watch just a little bit. Look when His ministry first started. The first thing right out of the box, they started services, and here was a little fellow by the name of Nathanael, or Philip. He come and got saved, and he run over to a place where he found one of his friends setting down under a tree, or kneeling under a tree some way, praying. He said, "Come, see Who we found. Jesus of Nazareth, the One that Moses spoke of." He said, "Could..." Now, the man was honest in heart. He said, "Could any good thing come out of Nazareth?" He said, "You come and see."

L-33 So here was Jesus had the prayer line. We'd say it was a prayer line, whatever condition He was in, the Bible doesn't quote. But when he came to Jesus, when Jesus seen him coming, He said, "Behold, an Israelite in whom there's no guile." That shocked him quickly. "How did He know me?" Said, "Whence knowest thou Me, Rabbi?" He said, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the tree. I saw you." Now, he didn't step back and say, "Now, wait a minute. Are You reading my mind? Is that mental telepathy? Are You--You Beelzebub?" See? He just run, and fell at His feet, and said, "Thou art the Son of God, the King of Israel." God blessed him, his name's immortal today. Is that right? See?

L-34 Now, if that same person would come, and the same Jesus was standing here at the platform tonight; the man would come across the platform, He'd say, "Why, you're Christian, a honest man, an Israelite in whom there is no guile." See? He said, "Well," you'd say, "how do You know me? "Well, when you was down yonder at the doctors office with that stomach trouble, I saw you." That would make Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Is that right? All right. When He went to a woman... Watch Him. He went out one day to--to Samaria. It was needful that He went by there. Sure He had a vision, the reason it was needful; the Father had Him up there. He sent away everybody, because in the vision, nobody was there but Him and the woman. Out come the woman about eleven o'clock in the day, maybe she had run all night, and didn't get up in time. But maybe, she was... 'cause the rest of them, they wouldn't let her get water when she did. She was a prostitute. She come out there. And He said, "Bring Me a drink!"

L-35 Now, Father just told Him to got up--up the way of--of Samaria. So He said, "Bring Me a drink!" She turned around; she said, "That's a Jew." She said, "Why, it's not customary for you Jews to ask we Samaritans such. We have no fellowship, or no, nothing in common." Now look at Jesus. See? He's trying to catch her spirit. You're human. See? He's trying to get that human spirit. He said, "If you knew Who you were talking to, you'd ask Me for a drink, and I'd give you waters that you didn't come here to draw." 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min Watch now. See, there's nothing yet. The Father hasn't showed it, just yet. She said, "Why, the well's deep, and You have nothing to draw with." He said, "The waters that I give is living Water, springing up, to Everlasting Life." Then He... After He caught her spirit, the vision moved. He said, "Go, get your husband." He knew where she was standing. She said, "I have no husband!" Said, "You've said right, for you've had five, and the one you have now is not your husband."

L-36 "Why," she said, "I perceive that You're a prophet." And she run into the city, and said, "Come, see a Man that told me everything I ever done." He never... She only told that one thing, that she done. But, if God could reveal that to Him, He could reveal everything to Him. You believe that? See? Just what the Father showed, that's what He did. Now, I want to ask you something, friend. Then, if that same Jesus... I don't want to take no more time. If that same Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever... Now, let's get the psychology part out of it, the psychic side, saying, "Well, now somebody in this group here has a stomach trouble." Certainly, there's probably a lot of them. Which one of them is it now? That's it. See? "Somebody has a--a bad eyes." Yes, lot of you do. Which one is it? What about it? See? There you are.

L-37 As King Nebuchadnezzar said that time, said, "Well, if... The dream's gone from me." Said, "You soothsayers, and astrologers, and psychologist." Said, "You tell me what I dreamed about." "Oh," they said, "you tell us the dream; we'll give the interpretation." Said, "If you can't tell me what the dream was, then you can't tell me the interpretation. But if you'll tell me what I dreamed, the thing's gone from me, reveal it back to me, then I know you're interpretation is right." Who's got stomach trouble out there? Who's got heart trouble out there? Who has this? Sure, it's out there, but who is it? What else have they done? What else in their life has taken place? Oh, brother, sister, what the Holy Ghost Church needs tonight, is a good old fashion Gospel lecturing, and down to the altar, and back to the Holy Ghost, and get all of the psychology out of it. It's the power of Almighty God.

L-38 Gifts and callings are without repentance. You absolutely receive them when you're borned in this world. The Bible says that. How many believes in predestination, foreordination, election, calling, so forth? If you believe the Bible, you have to. Some of you didn't put your hands up. I want to ask you something then. Jesus Christ was the Son of God from the very foundation of the world. He was a Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. You believe that? He was the woman's Seed that was to the bruise the serpents head. You believe that? Then He was predestinated, foreordained of God. Do you believe that? When Moses was born, he was a proper child, and was borned a prophet. You believe that? Nothing nobody had to do with it. God made him a prophet before he was born to fulfill Abraham's prophecy. How many believes that... Why, John the Baptist seven hundred and twelve years before he was ever born, Isaiah saw him. Said, "He is the voice of one crying in the wilderness." You believe that? Look at this.

L-39 Jeremiah--when Jeremiah... The 1st chapter of Jeremiah, 4th verse, I believe it is, God said: "Before you was even formed in your mothers belly, I knew you, and called you, and sanctified you, and ordained you a prophet over the nations," before he was ever borned. You believe in predestination, foreordination? We could go right on down through the Scripture. Yes, sir. It's altogether by grace. It's not by desire; it's by grace. God called Abraham out of that whole world of people. Why? 'Cause Abraham was better? No, sir. It's grace. God's chosen, election, and call. You are what you are because the grace of God has made you what you are. Who taking thought can add one cubit to his statue? Is that right? It's by grace. These things are called. God has set in the Church.

L-40 Now, Jesus said this, "A little while and the world seeth Me no more." The world is the--the--the cosmos there, which means "the world order." "The world sees Me no more, yet ye (the Church) shall see Me." The Church now, 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min that's this Church here, the believers. "The believers shall see Me, for I'll be with them, even in them, to the end of the world." Is that right? Then if that is true, that makes Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Is that right? Then if He is the same, He does the same kind of works that He did then. Is that true? All right. I'm here tonight to say that Jesus Christ is here tonight, and is gathered, "Wherever two or three are gathered together in My Name, I'll be in their midst." Is that right? Now, we believe that. Don't doubt, believe it. How do we... Take all doubt away from me. Don't wonder. What if Abraham tried to wonder. What if Jonah in the belly of the whale tried to wonder? What if all the other heroes of faith wondered? How is it going to be? As long as you can figure it out, it's not faith any more; it's got to be something you can't figure out.

L-41 Here the other day, a doctor said, "I--I studied to be a minister, studied four years. I become an agnostic; I throwed the thing up. There's nothing to none of it." He said, "I studied Mohammed. They had virgin births. Buddha, they had virgin births. Here's the Bible..." I said, "Just a minute, doctor." I said, "You're trying to compare error with Truth." That's right. People say, "Why, he's a... That's mental telepathy. That's reading the mind." You're trying to compare error with Truth. I said, "One of them is ridiculous and the other one's sublime." That's right. They can't prove one thing, Mohammed can't. And neither..." I said, "I visit the grave of most all them founders. But where is Jesus buried today?" I said, "He rose again." Said, "How do you know they didn't steal Him away?" I said, "They rose again." He said, "How do you know?" I said, "He liveth now." He said, "Where?"

L-42 I said, "In my heart." That's right. And I said, "The trouble of it is, doctor, in the garden of Eden, there's two trees; one was knowledge and one was faith. One was Life. One was death of knowledge, other one was life by faith. And as long as they eat by faith of this tree, all right, they lived. But when he got on this tree, he died. The first bite he took, he separated himself from God. And man continually has been biting off of that tree. And every time he takes a bite by knowledge, he destroys himself. God destroy nothing. Man destroys himself through knowledge.

L-43 Look, he bit hisself off some gun powder, kills his comrades. He bit hisself off of an automobile off the tree, kills more than all the wars put together. Is that right? Knowledge, knowledge, eating off that tree. He has got hisself an hydrogen bomb now; I wonder what he's going to do with that. See? But the trouble of it is, these people, they figure up so much, on this tree of knowledge, then when they can't figure it out any longer, they say, "bosh with all of it." Listen, in the Name of the Lord, listen: When you can't figure out any more, that's the time to believe. It's like someone going to swim, as long as you got your feet on the ground, all right. But when you step in the step off, there's the time to swim. It's where you can't figure out, then you believe from there on. Figure up as much as you can, then when you can't figure any more, then from right there start believing, believing.

L-44 The doctors says, all right, "I went to the doctor." He says you got a tumor. "I can't do you no good; it's done went through you. You're... It's malignant. I--I can't do nothing for you. Go over to the other doctor, I can't do nothing for you. It's done." Then from right there start believing. Believe from right there, and say, "Lord Jesus, they can't do nothing, but I'm coming to You." See? Then God will go to moving on the scene. Do you believe it? Now, listen to the disciples, a little later in the 6th, in the 36th verse of the same chapter, Jesus speaking, rather, here. Listen at Him what He says now. They was all talking about, "We had Moses. We had this. And we had these others. You see?" But listen what Jesus said, "But I have greater witness, than of John." Now, watch. "For the works which the Father has given Me to finish, the works which I do, bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me." 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min

L-45 Acts, the 2nd chapter, about 24th verse, said: "Jesus of Nazareth, a Man approved of God among you by signs and wonders and miracles..." They couldn't deny it. They said He was a devil. But now, wait, right at the last of it here, when Jesus was going away, He taught the people in such a way, they didn't understand it. They understood it by the letter. He was speaking to them as an authority. Now, here's what they said in the 16th chapter, the 30th verse beginning, 16th chapter of Saint John 30th verse. Now said the disciples, now we are sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou comest forth from God... ("By the signs and the wonders that You do, we believe that you come from God.") Jesus answered and said, Do ye now believe?

L-46 May the Lord God grant the same... Do you now believe? If God in heaven will send His Spirit tonight, in our midst, the Spirit, the Holy Spirit of Jesus Christ to anoint a human being, and to show the same signs and wonders, that He did back there in the days of Jesus, will you then accept Him, believe that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever? And upon the merits of your faith in Him, you're willing to accept your healing, or your salvation, or whatever you have need of? Let's bow our heads then, while we have: "Only Believe," if you will.

L-47 Our heavenly Father, with loving kindness, grateful hearts, full of assurance, I realize these are great words for someone to say. But I know, down through the age of my time, that Thou has been near, and has helped, and has showed great signs, and wonders, and visions. We are sure, Lord, and I know surely, that there's nothing within Thy poor humble, unworthy servant that could heal anyone. But I know that Your Angel is near by a Divine gift that You called back before the foundation of the world. You knew that I was going to be here in Chicago. You knew that I had the Word of Life for people; that was before the foundation of the world. And way back, yonder in the state of Kentucky, in a little old tumbled down shack where, a poor peasant father and mother, without even a--a floor in the house... When that beautiful April morning broke, You sent the Holy Spirit in the room as a Divine vindication that something was ready. And now, Almighty God, Who has fed me all the days of my life, Thou knowest my heart. And I feel the least among my brethren. And Lord, Thou knowest, I'm not saying this that they'd hear me, for I'd be a hypocrite. I say it, because I love You, Father, and I know this great moment is just at hand. And then, without fear, after You have commissioned to do this, and if it be Your will, if You'll permit it, Lord, I come to this little platform of this humble church tonight, after making these statements and showing to the people, that what You was, in Your Son, years ago, You are the same tonight in Your people; that You are the same Lord Jesus with us, even in us.

L-48 And now, Lord, I have come, and I believe Thou has sent, that these words that You spoke might be fulfilled in this age. And now, Lord Jesus, there'll be people coming to this platform, I do not know them; You know every one of them. And I pray that You'll heal every one. And if it be Your will tonight, to break forth with power, to break forth with signs and wonders, like Philip coming from the tree, if it be Your will to do that, then, Lord, I pray that You'll grant it, tonight, as You have last night, other nights. When these sinners would slip to the platform, smoking, drinking, and carrying on, and thought they could slip by, but Your Spirit knew them, called them out, tell them who they are, and what they've done...

L-49 Now, Lord Jesus settle over this building with a reverence and an awe to the people. And may every person look straight to Calvary now and see the bleeding sacrifice of the Son of God, see the Holy Spirit descending out of Him unto the Father, and returning back to finish the works that Jesus laid out to be done, to preach the Gospel and signs to follow to the end of the world. Grant it, Lord. And may, Chicago, tonight, know that Thou art Christ the Son of God, and I am Thy servant. For I ask it in Jesus Christ's Name and for His glory alone. Amen. Thank you.

L-50 All right. That's all right, Brother Boze. Billy Paul, where are you at, son? I have missed him somewhere. Yeah. What? Was you setting there all the time? Somebody see what that lady wants for me, if you will. What cards did you give out, B's? Was it B's? All right. How many people here have prayer card, B, hold up your hand? 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min Prayer card B? There's a hundred and something of them out here. All right. Now, let's start from... Where did we start? We started from fifty last night, didn't we? All right, let's start back from one tonight. Who has got B-1, prayer card B-1, B-2, B-3, get about the first ten or fifteen up there. Let's have... try fifteen. Now, we're just going to pray for the sick. I'm not here to entertain, as I say; I'm here to pray for the sick. There's no greater power in the world than prayer. Do you believe that? And now, how many sick people is here on this closing night of this revival, that believes that this I have told you the straight truth, and that the Spirit that's bearing record here, of the truth, is the Spirit of God. Will you raise your hand? Thank you, that's what will cause a revival to come in Chicago. That's the reason you're receiving these benefits.

L-51 In the Name of the Lord I say this: Blessed is your eyes, and blessed is your ears for you see things that many in the back generations has longed to see, and has failed to see it. Blessed are your ears which are hearing, for you hear things that many has longed to hear, and has failed to hear it. God bless you.

L-52 Now, to these that's coming, look on your cards. There might be somebody deaf, or can't hear, I... What'd I call, ten or fifteen? Fifteen wasn't it? Fifteen? The first fifteen, B-1 to B-15, first. I don't know what the Holy Spirit will do. I can't tell. If He speaks to the people, gives visions, I'll speak them. If He doesn't, I cannot. I'll just pray for the sick as they go through. But every one in this audience, wherever you are, you look here and believe with all your heart, and God will answer your desire. I just feel like an anointing of the Holy Spirit's coming near. Friends, how many seen the picture there in the book, of that Angel of the Lord? You probably got It in your house. It was copyrighted yonder in Washington, DC, the only supernatural Being that was ever taken. I'm standing at a sacred desk here; God knows this is true. That same Angel that you see yonder, where all the whole nation blared at, where they're trying to be to get It in papers and things, but It's copyrighted, it can't be done. It'll never be till I'm dead and gone. Then It'll be brought out. But you can have It. You could buy It. But I mean It can't be released, because God wouldn't permit that. But yonder It is, by all scientific research, everywhere. The best there is in United States, there's his own name, George J. Lacy, signed to it, FBI, head of the FBI agent, on fingerprint and so forth. There it is signed by him. You couldn't get a copy of It without his signature. It's the only supernatural Being was ever scientifically proved to be real.

L-53 And there, right before thousands of people, many, many thousand, when they said, I was an impostor. I said, "I only claim to be God's servant. I am not a Divine healer." I said, "I tell the truth. An Angel of God came to me, and told me that I was to go to do this thing. If I speak the truth, then God will vindicate the Truth. But if I tell a lie, God has nothing to do with a lie. And He won't bless error. Anyone knows that." I said, "If I tell the Truth, then God will speak that I've told the truth." And about that time, here It come, whew [Brother Branham makes a whirling sound--Ed.] a Pillar of Fire, something like that, hung right down where I was. And the American Photographer Association set up their camera and shot the picture. Took it, said, "I'll see if it's psychology." And went down there and put it in the acids and tested it, and flew It to Washington, DC the same night, returned back, and it's been in their hands of the Douglas Studios in Houston, Texas, the only supernatural Being was ever photographed and proved. Now, the scientific world knows It's real. And a real borned again Christians who were in the meeting and see the work of It, know It's real. Now, what more do you need tonight, but to accept It as being real, sent from God? The Lord bless you. Okay, Billy? All right.

L-54 Bring the lady. Is all your fifteen there? What say? All right. The person that's holding prayer card number 5, is missing. If you're here, look around, might be a deaf person. Prayer card number 5 is missing. They'll miss their turn if they don't come in according to their number. B-5. All right. Now, just a moment. Slowly, sister, "Abide With Me," if you will. And let's just kind of get near to God. Remember, before you start praying, look this way. The Angel of God, Whose servant I am, is standing less than three feet from me, right now. You think I'd say that if I didn't know what I was talking about? He's moving right in. You can just feel It coming in. It's His Presence. 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min Now, Lord Jesus, come near. May a sacred, holy, hush come over the people. May there be a reverence. May there be a power of God that'll set the people free tonight. And may Your great, holy, humble Name be magnified. Grant it, Lord, in Jesus' Name I ask it. Amen.

L-55 Now, if you friends... Now, for the last few nights, I just been taking the people, praying for them, and whatever the Lord say... It may be the same thing tonight. I don't know. That's up to Him. I want you to be in prayer. And if I happen to ask you to bow your heads, bow your head. And if you got children, keep them near you, for if the epileptic comes on the platform, that's one thing that gets away from me. I've seen here, not long ago, twenty-eight people, setting out there, a minister and a whole group, take epilepsy off of a fit that was throwed--brought off of a person on the platform. That's truth. Remember those boys that went down, said to this epileptic, "I adjure thee, by Jesus, who Paul preaches, come out." And the devil said, "Now, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?" Is that right? You remember what happened? They got epilepsy. All right.

L-56 Now, lady, you come here near. Now, I just want to ask you some questions. Can you hear me out there all right? Where's Brother Baxter? If you... You watch Brother Baxter, I don't know, I believe it's going to the anointing (You see?), and if it does why, you watch this microphone, if they don't get it. I never know how far it is away (You see?), when it gets a few, after a few. The anointing gets so deep, till the whole crowd of people becomes a mass, and I don't know what I'm saying. You see? And you before this happens, I love you. I am your brother in Christ Jesus. Pray for me wherever I go. I'll always remember Chicago, be longing to come back. Now, sister. I know you're a Christian, because your spirit feels welcome. See? You're a believer. But now, in order that we want to talk just a few moments. See? And--and then, in this talking, like our Master did at the woman at the well. He just talked to her, till... See, you are human. I am a human. And we both have human spirits. And now, there's... If there's anything wrong in you (See?), then that is something that Satan's trying to do. That's an outside being from you. You understand that? If it's a cancer, if it's a tumor, or whatever it is, it's something outside of you. It's a life growing, or whatever it might be.

L-57 Now, in here, I'm just a man, just your brother. And then, there's an anointing come in here, which you're aware of It now. See? You know it's something. I want you to watch, friends. Watch the patient's face when they come near here. Watch, when It's coming like It is now. Watch them change the expression on their face when they come. Just--just remember to watch. And now, if the Angel of the Lord will come near, then the angel of sickness, which would be on you, he will go to pulling. See? The Angel of the Lord's near. Now, there's both powers. And they're fighting one against the other. Now, it depends on our faith. Now, that sickness, whatever you have, if that is a pulling on you (You see?), it's going to try to try to put everything in your mind to keep you from believing that this is truth. See? And This, which is coming now, and me speaking to you, is trying to get you to believe that It's Truth. You see? Now, here's the warfare. If you will believe It, then this here, Holy Spirit, will pronounce the blessing; Satan has to leave; it has to be. Now, if you don't... Now, after when, he goes away, you'll maybe get, right away feel better. He walks in dry places. And he returns back with a symptom, worse than he ever was, seven times as bad, maybe. And when he does, if the good man of the house isn't standing there, that faith, say, "Get away."

L-58 Now, the Bible said, "Go and sin no more, or a worse thing would come upon you." Is that right? That means, "Go and disbelieve any more." Sin is unbelief. See? That's the first thing. That's all there is to it, is unbelief, is sin. 'Cause when you believe... Jesus said, "He that believeth shall not be condemned. He that heareth My Words and believeth on Him that sent Me, has Everlasting Life, and shall not come into condemnation." It's all in faith, if you believe it. Now, these gifts are added. Now, here's the Word of God originally. You believe that? That's for the nation, the world. But now, if there happened to be something in your life, that maybe you was keeping back, then these gifts are sent 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min here to reveal that, prophetic things. See? That's what God does through sovereign grace.

L-59 Now, Jesus talked to the woman a little while, till He got her spirit. Then when He got in the channel that she was in, as I'd call it channel, or spirit that's got her into that spirit, He seen what was wrong. He went right quick and told her what was wrong. And she turned, and re... He never said, "Your sins are forgive you." He never said nothing. But she knew, that He was near, and she believed Him to be the Messiah. Is that right? She said, "Come, see a Man, Who told me what the things that I did. Isn't this the very Messiah?" Now, He never said, "You're sins are forgiven, and you don't live with those husbands no more, or nothing like that." He never said a word her. She just recognized that He was the Messiah, because He knew what she had done. Now, if He will come down and reveal what's wrong with you, would you recognize it to be the Messiah, the same yesterday, today, and forever? Now, there's... You're bothered with some kind of a growth, that's rectal trouble. Is that right? If it is, raise your hand. Is that hemorrhoids? Is that right? Now, that's from the back.

L-60 And here sometime ago, you don't realize what you've done. But haven't you got some kind of a stiffness in your back or something, some kind of a--a dislocated spinal disk, isn't that right? Is that right? Yes, sir. You did that when you was a child. You didn't realize when you were doing it; you didn't know when you was doing it. You got a fall when you was jumping as a little girl, and that's dislocated a disk in your back, and they just found it here, just begin to realize what it is. You've had that stiffness... Sometimes you can't get off of a--a bed, or something. I see you trying to move, or something through... that hurting in your back. Is that right? When you was kneeling here a few days ago to pray by a chair, or a bed or something in a room... Is that right? A picture hanging to your left in the room, you just couldn't hardly get up, for your back. Is that right? If it is, wave your hand like this.

L-61 Now, I want to ask you something. You heard that voice speaking. That was not me. I was looking here before you, and saw a vision, which you know that only God alone would know the things. Is that right? All right. Do you believe me to be His prophet? Then, you, right now accept Him as your Healer? If you'll accept it right now as your Healer, in the Name of Jesus Christ, go home and be well. And God bless you. How do you do, sister. Do you believe? With all your heart? You are very conscious of something going on. You are. You're very conscious of that, that believing that there's something supernatural. Now, That isn't going to hurt you. That's to bless you. You've never felt just that way before in your life, like that. Isn't that right? If it is, raise your hand so the people can catch it. That's the Angel of the Lord. Your faith is moving in now. And since you've come right here, your faith is increased tremendously. Isn't that right? Because you're in His Presence now. That's what's a doing it. You're bothered with some kind of a something in your throat. Isn't that right? Throat trouble? Now, It left me. Here It is. No, haven't you been--had an operation? You had two on the breast, it was a cyst, or something, cut off the breast. Is that right? Two doctors was in the room there. Is that right? I see it in a place, kind like of a...

L-62 All right, sister. God has confirmation to confirm... Your throat's healed. You go home. Look. If Jesus Christ by His power is here, got you anointed now, like you've never been before in your life, and you're aware... This is new to you. You know what I was fixing to say there, but you understand. See? This is new to you. All right. Now, if He's here, and knows what was in your life, and can reveal it to a stranger, what was in your life, don't He know what will be in your life? All right. You're healed. Go home now. Everyone reverent, be real reverent. Do you realize that the Master is near? You believe that? What more should you ask for? What more should you want? In His lovely Presence now. How He'd love to heal this audience tonight. It's His Divine will to do so. If you can only appropriate the faith. The reason I'm talking, the anointing getting real deep (You see?), and I--I won't get but just a few if I don't wait just a minute, and kind of get myself back normally again. You'll never know Christians, this side of heaven, what that takes out of a human being.

L-63 Daniel saw a vision, and he was troubled at his head for many days. Is that right? Jesus said, "I perceive that virtue, or strength, has gone from Me," when the woman touched His garment. When them believers standing there with that heart bleeding, and moving in, something has to happen. It just takes the life right out of you. It's the human part saps away. God comes in. 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min Just think, it breaks out into another dimension, out where nobody knows nothing about it. It's in the supernatural realm, and calls up things that has been done way years ago. How can you doubt God? Throat's better now, isn't it, sister? Is that right? Raise your hand. You're healed. That's exactly. I didn't even tell you what it was. It told you what had happened. You're healed; you're all right. God bless you. Now, excuse me for asking the patient sometimes, that... I can't tell who's who, sometimes when I'm anointed.

L-64 Now, sir, you are a stranger to me. I don't believe I know you. If I've ever met you, I don't remember. This is our first meeting. If that's... that's right, isn't it? It's our first meeting. Then you're altogether a stranger. Does anybody here know this man? All right. Someone knows him then. And you know the man to be an honest man. I suppose he is. He--he's a Christian; I know that. For his spirit bears record with this Angel that has me anointed now, this--this powerful One that comes from the Presence of God, that's on my mortal body now. Just like that... It isn't that light bulb up there; it's that current that's in the light bulb. See? It's not me; it's Him now.

L-65 I was your brother, a few moments ago, I'm God's servant now. Sir, a man can make any kind of a claim, but until God confirms it, it's no good. If God confirms it and says it's truth, then you can't doubt God, or you shouldn't. Is that right? If we be strangers then, there's something wrong with you. I trust that our Lord Jesus will let me know what's wrong with you. If He does, then that... I could not heal you, of course, you understand. It would only give you a--a little what you need, a little push of faith, perhaps, or something like that. You're aware that you're in the Presence of some supernatural Being. You know that. Now, that the audience might know, raise your hands. That you know, that's a feeling that you never felt. See? That's right. It's--it's something, audience, I cannot explain. Surely, I should know what I'm speaking of.

L-66 And I say not this for glory. I say this in honor of Jesus Christ to fulfill His Words which said He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Understand. All right. That One that now is here, moving to you, that is the blessful One, the Son of God. He went to the Father, sent back the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit was to reveal the Truth, and to show things, that was to come: Saint John 17, or 15. Is that right? Now, life hasn't been a flower bed of ease for you. For swinging between you and I, comes a long dark road. And down this road, I see you coming. There's something about the head; you're holding your head. It's headaches. Is that, is that right? For years... Aren't you a musician or something? Don't you play some kind of music, or something, some kind of a string music? Is that right? Come here, brother. Father, I bless my brother tonight in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I ask You to heal him, Lord, may this leave him. And may he go from here tonight and get well, as I ask this blessing, in the Name of Jesus, the Son of God. Amen.

L-67 Brother, look. No one has been able to find what that was. Isn't that right? They thought first migraine, but I seen a tall thin-looking doctor shaking his head when migraine was mentioned to him. Is that right? It isn't migraine. No, it isn't. It was Satan. Has gone from you now, go, believing. How do you do. Have you believed? You've tried to. Why did I ask you, "Have you believed?" This is why I asked you. You've been prayed for before. Is that right? You have a tumor in the stomach. You're just afraid that it isn't gone. You're just a little afraid to accept it on those basis. Is that right? I'm not reading your mind. But I see when you tried to accept it, and God in heaven knows, by sight, I don't remember you. But I believe, if I'm not mistaken, from where I see you standing now, by vision, that it was somewhere in an--an auditorium that had wings on the side, like this, or something. Was it Zion? Is that right? You tried to accept your healing there. Don't doubt no more. That's your trouble. Just hanging over you like a shadow. Here's what you want me to do. You want me to cast that away from you. That's what you come back for. Is that right? If that's right, raise your hand. I can make it go by the power of Jesus Christ, but I can't keep it away. Your faith will have to keep it away. Do you believe me to be His prophet? No way in the world for me to know that outside of God, is that right?

L-68 Now come near. God, this poor woman, realizing that something must be done right away... She's trying, Father, to break through, but Satan has determined that he's going to cause her trouble. But I ask for mercy for her. Now, You said, "The prayer of faith shall save the sick, and God shall raise them up. If they have did any sin, it shall 52-0810E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Philadelphia Church Chicago, IL, 75 min be forgive them. Confess your faults one to another and pray one for another, that you might be healed." Satan, in the Name of Jesus Christ, I come in this duel of faith, challenging, not in my own power or name, you know that I could not do that. But I come as a representative of Jesus Christ, claiming a Divine gift that was ministered to me by an Angel, telling me to get the people to believe, that the sickness would not stand before them when sincere prayer was made. And I pray sincerely to God. Therefore, you cannot hold the woman any longer. I charge thee by the Son of God, Jesus Christ, come out of the woman.

L-69 All right, sister. Now, look. Now, it's gone. The life of it is dead. Now, you'll notice this. If you'll keep believing as you are now. You're going... You feel different now. Now, if that's right, wave your hand. Real light and cool, is that right? It's dead. The life of it went out. Just like your life would go from you, your body drop. Now, the life of it is out. Now, that will shrink for the next seventy-two hours. And then, you'll feel better for about the next two or three days. Then after that, you'll get real sick. It's breaking, deteriorating, rotting, in other words. It'll be bigger than it ever was. Then go to thanking God. Don't never doubt there. Keep thanking God for your healing. It'll go away from you. If I knew what was, I knew what will, know what will be. If He can reveal to me... He revealed what was; He can reveal what is yet. You believe that? You failed you're calling to in life; you know that. Now, go on, serve God with all your heart. All right. Come, lady. Be reverent. Everywhere. How do you do, sister. You believe me to be God's prophet? With all your heart? All right. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
