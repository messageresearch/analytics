--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 "I believe." Let us remain standing now for a few moments, as we bow our heads. I wonder, while we have our heads bowed, and our hearts, that if there's any special request tonight that you would require of God, a special something, you'd let it be known by your uplifted hand. He knows just what you have need of now. In your heart, just think of what it is.

L-2 Our Heavenly Father, we are so glad tonight that we have that grand privilege of saying "Father" to the Creator of heavens and earth. And we're so happy to know that we are assembled here tonight in Heavenly places in Christ, Thy Son. And He promised that if we would ask anything in His Name it would be granted. Lord, You--You seen every hand that went up. You--You know what was behind that hand. There was a request for something, and I'm offering my prayer along with theirs. By faith now we're coming up to the great ivory Throne of God. There, as we see the Blood of the Lord Jesus laying there upon the altar, to make sure that our request is answered. Only one thing left: if we will believe that we receive what we ask for, then it will be granted. Help our unbelief.

L-3 And, Father, we pray tonight that as we open the Word, that You will reveal It to us. You are the One Who wrote It, and we pray that You'll make It known to us. And then come among us and live It out and prove Yourself, that in this hour of great scientific achievement, and when the church is getting cold and going off into forms and creeds, that You remain the same to those Who believe You to be the same, that You're the same God that poured out the power at Pentecost. You're the same God that walked with the disciples, the One that was with Moses in the wilderness, and You're the same tonight. Bless us together now as we fellowship around the Word. In Jesus Christ's Name we ask it. Amen. Be seated.

L-4 As always, deeming it a great privilege to be where the people of God are assembled together, for I'm sure that Christ is in the midst of us. And we are grateful to the Lord God for hearing the good report of last evening, and still shows that God heals the sick and the afflicted. And now there's... If we can just keep our minds settled on Christ, and know His Presence is here, and that He has already secured for you every redemptive blessing that He died for. It's yours. All you have to do is believe it.

L-5 And now we trust that you had good rest today. And you... Try to get you out tonight, just as soon as possible. And then tomorrow night, being Thursday night; and then Friday night; and then Saturday morning, the breakfast.

L-6 I want to ask the congregation tonight a request from Brother Carl Williams, at the Phoenix chapter, the president of the Phoenix chapter. His eighty-five-year-old father had a stroke this afternoon. And he was to be here tonight. And he had to fly up north somewhere, to see his father. And I went to prayer for the old fellow right away. A few weeks ago I was with him, he was more livelier than his son, over at Albuquerque where we had a convention. And tonight he lays, stroke, eighty-five years old. But I'm believing with all my heart that God is going to take the stroke off of him. I--I--I believe it, see, for when I was in prayer I--I could just see him moving. And he--he... You're not stroke, when you can move, you know. So, he, I--I know he's going to get better, if not well.

L-7 And we're thankful for the--the faith, the evidence, something with us that tells us, and we know. There's no more guess work in it. We've had, for years, the Word of God. Now we got the God of the Word, see, and right here living His Word out. So it's true, one of the last great signs that's promised to the Church before the Coming of the Lord.

L-8 Not long ago, my son and I was... went into Bombay, India, where I think we had the greatest altar call I ever had the Lord to do in our meetings. Was... We couldn't estimate how many come to Christ, because it was estimated around a half a million in one gathering, about five hundred thousand. And there was a great strenuous time on. And there was the Hindus, the holy men. And, oh, my, talk about religion, India has got it! That afternoon, I was entertained by seventeen different religions of India, and every one of them denied Jesus Christ: every one of them: Mohammedan, 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min Buddha, Sikh, Jain, oh, so many of them. And I never said nothing. I just listened to them. As, we had to take our shoes off, to go into the temple of the Jains.

L-9 That night, before a host that I couldn't see the end of them, and when the people begin to come up; the militia had to let the people come, one at a time. The first come, was a leper; had no arms, and ears was eat off. Anyone knowed what his trouble was, of course. And then after two or three passed by, why, there was the Holy Spirit, revealing. Course, when the anointing comes on, then you can tell what the people is thinking. See, you pick it up. And they were thinking it was something like a telepathy.

L-10 And anyone, that knows what telepathy is, would, it would be a... If you thought that such as the Holy Spirit discerning would be telepathy, why, then, you don't know much about telepathy.

L-11 So then these holy men, and Rajahs, and so forth, on their pillows and... So they were piled on top of one another, was two or three smothered to death, in the meeting, and just trying to pile in. And I only had two days to stay.

L-12 And I couldn't get protection... Cause, I had to have it in the city, was only way we get protection. Outside of the city, there had been a lady come through, that had caused a little trouble, and two or three got stabbed to death, and they wouldn't give me protection outside the city. And it certainly was an awful thing to see.

L-13 But about the fourth man came by, was fourth or fifth, was a man blind, and he was a beggar. Of course, India has four hundred and seventy million people, and it looked to me like about four hundred million of them were beggars. I never seen so many beggars! And it's such a pitiful thing. When, we don't know how well off we are, till you have to take a trip like that, once.

L-14 Here is a mother laying in the street, her little baby starving. Its little gums is down against its lips. Its little... It can't cry no more. The mother is starving, too. She wants to give you the baby, keep it from dying; anything, keep it from dying. And here, well, you take it? Here is another one, here is another one, another one, oh, you, just there's no end to it. And there they are, and so pitiful. And they're human beings that Christ died for.

L-15 And there, that night, standing there, and this blind man came up. The Holy Spirit said, now, "He's a beggar, and he's a worshipper of the sun. He's been blind twenty years." Well, as soon as that was said, you could pick up, you know. They have you...

L-16 When you go to a place like that, you better know what you're talking about, 'cause they'll challenge you to it, just at any time. And you better be sure that God sent you. You don't play church there. You have to really have what you're talking about. It's all right here in America, but don't never try to hit the field 'less you're really positive. And then in Africa, and those witch doctors and so, they're--they're spiritualists. They don't just fool with some psychology. They are--they are demon-possessed, and they have power. And it takes only the power of God, can override it. And I've never seen a time, though, but what our great and glorious Lord Jesus rode over the top of all of it, and won the victory every time. I say that as His servant, in His Name.

L-17 And this night there, there was, I remember, this man. It said, "You're blind." Said, "You're a beggar, and you worship the sun."

L-18 And they believe, if they look at the sun until they go blind, that they'll go to Heaven; so there's a Heaven for them, and they'll go, by, they worship the creation.

L-19 And, listen, you could feel it coming in, that they, those, especially what they call holy men. Then they grease themselves over with olive oil; it's a sight to see; kill a goat and worship.

L-20 So then, the next, It said, "You are a married man, and you have two children. And they're two boys. And one of them is about six years old, and the other one about nine." And when the interpreter told him that, that was correct. And still they wouldn't listen to it. They thought it was a psychology.

L-21 And I thought, "Lord, if You'll just show me something that they could see done."

L-22 And you have to watch what the Holy Spirit is saying. That's what He's telling you. Stay there long enough till you hear what He says back again. See? Listen to what He tells you. Because, it's not me. I know nothing about it. It's Him. 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min And I don't even know what I'm saying, myself, and don't know it till I hear the tape. And, then, so then it's wonderful to see what He did.

L-23 And then I noticed, and I seen the man, like a vision, standing above, and he could see. He had his sight. I thought, "This will be a wonderful time right now."

L-24 And I said, "Today I was entertained in the temple of the Jains, where many of you different leaders here was present. And you were telling me about how little Christianity was, and how great your religion was. I had not a chance to take up for the Lord Jesus. But," I said, "tonight, here is a man standing here, that's blind. Now if I'd ask the Mohammedan priest, or the Buddha priest, or whoever it might be, what caused him to do that, you would say he was wrong, because he worshipped the creation instead of the creator. I'd say 'amen' to that. That's true, 'The creation instead of the creator.'

L-25 "Well, now, if this man has just said that he would serve the God that give him back his sight! Now he finds out he's wrong. Now what would you do to him? You Buddhists would make him forsake his god and come and join Buddhism. Mohammedans would make him be a Mohammedan. And different ones. What is it? You'd only change his thoughts. You'd only... It's psychology."

L-26 I said, "America is full of the same thing. All the Methodists wants to change the Baptists. And the Baptists wants to change the Pentecostals. And the Oneness wants to change the Twoness. The Twoness wants to change..." Oh, my, I never heard such! But one thankful thing, we all worship the same God. But there it's different.

L-27 "But," I said, "it's psychology. Surely there's a Creator somewhere that made his eyes." Now, I wouldn't have said this if I hadn't seen the vision first. Cause, it...

L-28 I'm fifty-four years old, seen visions since I was eighteen months old. Never one... I'll ask anybody if they ever seen one fail. No, sir. It never will. It never did and it never will. It's always right, because it's God.

L-29 And then I knew the man was going to get his sight, but I was trying to set a little trap to catch some of them unbelievers. And I said, "Now, if the Mohammedan religion, which is the predominant religion here in India, let the Mohammedan priests there, come here and restore the sight to this man, and I'll become a Mohammedan." See? I said, "If the Buddha is such a great religion, let the Buddha priests come, or anyone." I said, "Surely, if the man wants to get right with the right God, surely the great Creator Who made his eyes the first time can make him eyes the second time, if he wants to use them to the glory of Him." That was the quietest audience I ever heard.

L-30 I said, "Now, the platform is open, and let the man that can come here and give him his sight... Let the God, that the true God, the One that made him in the first place, that created his eyes, let Him come and restore his sight, and I'm ready to--to be a follower of that religion." Nobody said a word.

L-31 I said, "I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that I'm using telepathy to understand what's the matter with those people, and so forth, and telling them what they are, who they are. I can't even read their name; have to spell it out. Can't pronounce it. Can't even speak their language. You call that psychology. If it is, I don't know one thing about psychology. And you are masters of it. Let that master of psychology come and give the man his sight then. See if psychology can restore the sight to a blind man." That was still a quiet audience. Nobody said a word.

L-32 I said, "Why ain't you saying something? Surely there's a God somewhere. All, all this, everything going on, it proves there's a God somewhere. Who is He?" I said, "The reason that you're not saying nothing, because you can't do it. And neither can I. But the God of Heaven, Who raised up His Son, Jesus Christ, Who I am His witness, has showed me a vision that this man is going to receive his sight. Now, if He doesn't do it, then I'm a false prophet; run me out of India. But if He does do it... Right here, you people who are Mohammedans, here is your priests standing with their robes. Here is Buddha, and different ones. You see your leaders, how still they are? They say nothing. But I speak. I saw a vision of the man, is going to receive his sight, and is going to do it now. And if he doesn't, then there is something wrong, I'm a false witness of the Bible and of Christ." Everybody...

L-33 I said, "How many of you here will receive Him as your Saviour if God will restore the sight to this blind man?" 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min

L-34 And everywhere you see, just black hands up, as far as you could see. Well, it was estimated, five hundred thousand people. That's a half a million. So that's many, many times more than probably is in Tucson. So there they where, was setting in one place.

L-35 I drawed, asked the man to come near me. I put my arms around him. They don't interpret the prayer. I said, "Lord God, this is a challenge to my own faith. But right here, in the time where all these heathens are around here, aren't You still the same God that You always was?" And I said, "Now it's Your reputation at stake. I'm only saying what You said. And since a child, You show me visions, and I've never seen one fail. Now You show me the man would receive his sight. I call for his sight, in the Name of Jesus Christ."

L-36 And the man let out a great big scream. And the mayor of the city was setting there, run, grabbed him and hugged him. The man could see as good as I can or anyone else. Then, I seen thousands times thousands.

L-37 Friends, I don't want to say this critically, but we have failed to carry out the program that Christ sent for us to do. See? He said, "Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel." Now, He didn't say build schools. He didn't say build churches. Which, they are all fine. But we've put all of our time to building schools and churches and denominations, which has played a part. But that isn't what He said. "Preach the Gospel, and these signs shall follow them that believe." In other words, to preach the Gospel would be to demonstrate the power of the Holy Spirit. And there is where we have failed.

L-38 The church needs, tonight, not a soft hybrid something, soft and flabby like the church is, just make a confession, be baptized, and you're--you're a Christian. To be a Christian is self-denial. "Deny yourself. Take up your cross. Follow Me daily." Today it's so soft, and people call themselves Christians. When, it used to mean death, to confess Christ, and you had to depend on Him daily for everything you had need of.

L-39 That same God lives today. I know that that's true. And He's just as great today as He was then. If He ever was God, He is still God. But if He isn't God, then He never was God, because He's a God of the whole human race.

L-40 What good does it do to talk about a God of Abraham, if He isn't the same God today? What good would it do to talk about a God Who could open up the Red Sea, if He couldn't... for his children to escape, if He couldn't do the same thing today? What about a God that could raise a dead man out of the grave, if He can't do the same thing today?

L-41 What good does it do to give your canary bird fine seeds and vitamins, to grow good strong bones, and wings, and feathers, then keep him in a cage? How is he going to use them? What good does it do to teach a Bible of some great God?

L-42 How can a man that's freezing get... Can he get warm by a painted fire? A man that's freezing to death, and you paint him a fire, and say, "There's what was." That ain't. It's got to be the... It's got to be some heat coming from it, to--to do him some good.

L-43 And there's got to be a reality in the new Birth, of being born again, filled with the Spirit, and knowing the Presence of God is here, and see Him carrying out His Word and His promise just as He did. Jesus said, "If I be lifted up from the earth, I'll draw all men unto Me."

L-44 May the Lord help us. I didn't aim to get off on that, but just talking. The Lord bless you now. And one of these nights, maybe, 'fore it's over, I'm going to maybe preach one night for you. I'm just going to.

L-45 I'm talking about Divine healing now because I want to see, waiting for the Lord maybe to do something. That'll...

L-46 You know, about eighty-six percent of Jesus' ministry was Divine healing. And we don't use Divine healing for a major. You can't major on a minor, we know that, and this great art of Divine healing.

L-47 I have just completed a study, the last four or five years, of the early Church. I started off with the Foxe's book of martyrs, come down through Hislop's Two Babylons, and so forth, and on down through the Nicaea, and the Post-Nicene and the Nicene Fathers, and Nicaea council, and finding out that after the death of Jesus Christ. Down through Polycarp, and Irenaeus and Martin, and many of those great saints, for hundreds of years after the death of Jesus Christ, contended for that Faith, of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and speaking with tongues, and raising the 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min dead, and healing the sick. It was in the dark age this Thing was lost.

L-48 But, oh, God said, "I will restore," saith the Lord, "all the years the locust eat, and the caterpillar." He promised to do it, and this is the hour of restoration. The Tree shall bloom again. I believe it.

L-49 Lord bless you now. And in the Scripture, I want to take a familiar little text tonight, just to get you acquainted with what we are trying to do. You see, if you can...

L-50 If I could get this audience with one accord, to see and know exactly that Jesus Christ is alive and here among you! Oh, you psychically or mentally believe it. But when it can go beyond the mind, till you know it, then something will happen, see, when you can realize. The only thing is, is, to see Christ in our presence.

L-51 You know, in Durban, South Africa, where there was estimated, of twenty-five thousand wheel chairs, old box and carts, and they pull the people out of the jungles, weeks and weeks, coming through there. At one prayer, just a few words of prayer, and up off of there they went. And the next morning...

L-52 Sidney Smith, you can send him a telegram, write him a letter. He's the mayor of Durban, about twice, three times the size of Tucson. Yes, many times bigger than that. And we was at a race track where he had two hundred and fifty thousand people gathered.

L-53 And he called me, said, "Brother Branham, go to your window that faces the coast." That's the Indian Ocean there. "You'll see something you never seen."

L-54 And there come about ten of those great big English trucks, maybe forty-, fifty-feet long, just piled full of old crutches, and wheel chairs, and things that they had hobbled out of the wilderness on, the day before, and was healed. And here they were, and the--the people that was in those chairs and things, for city blocks, coming behind. All of them in one accord, walking past my hotel, singing, "Only believe. All things are possible," in their native language. Where, we had recorded thirty thousand blanket natives received Christ as their Saviour, at one time.

L-55 No disregards to our sisters, but here is what I can't understand when I come home. Every year, when I go away and come back, I find our--our women of America getting more clothes off of themselves, and yet calling themselves Christians, singing in choirs.

L-56 And them women standing there, many of them, nothing but a small 4-H clout on. And the minute they receive Jesus Christ as Saviour, no one had to tell them they were naked. They folded their arms, like this, to walk away from the presence of where men was standing.

L-57 If the Presence of Jesus Christ will bring that knowledge to a woman that never knowed nothing about Him, and just received Him as Saviour, and make her recognize she is naked, what ought it to do to a--a people here that's supposed to be civilized, and--and supposed to have the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and every year continually stripping themselves? To the... I believe there is something wrong somewhere. It may be with me; if it is, there is something wrong with the Word. I believe that the Holy Spirit will make a person put on clothes instead of take them off.

L-58 Now turn with me to Matthew, the 12th chapter, the 38th and to the 42nd verse, just a little familiar Scripture as we read. Listen closely now. Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. But he answered and said unto them, An evil and an adulterous generation seek after a sign; and there shall be no sign given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh shall rise in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. And the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min

L-59 If I should call it a text, I'd like to take that last five words: Greater Than Solomon Is Here.

L-60 We find, Jesus here had been upbraiding. He had been rebuking those places that He had been, and had proven to the people that He was the Messiah, just as He was showing to us last night. And all their teaching had been to believe that that would be the Messiahic sign. And even to this little woman that we spoke of last night, the woman at the well, how she, in her adulterous condition, and yet she knowed more about God, and recognized Him more, than the scribes and Pharisees did.

L-61 For, when they seen this done, they declared It to be some kind of a spirit, said, "It is Beelzebub." Beelzebub was the chief of the devils, a spirit, a devil. And said that He was doing that through some spiritualist, like a fortune-teller. And anybody knows that fortune-telling is of the Devil. And so they accused our Lord of doing that.

L-62 And He said, "If you call Me Beelzebub, it will be forgiven. But when you speak against the Holy Spirit, when It shall come, then there's no forgiveness for it, because you're calling the Spirit of God, which is doing the work, 'an unclean spirit.' That's blasphemy against the Holy Ghost."

L-63 My mother used to tell me, when I was a little boy, that, "Blasphemy of the Holy Ghost, was, to take your own life." Well, that isn't so. See? The Bible teaches it, that, "The blasphemy of the Holy Ghost, is to--is to, speak against the Holy Spirit." To blaspheme, is to talk about. And when you see the Holy Spirit doing something, and you make fun of It, you've crossed the line that you'll never cross back again. It'll never be forgiven you.

L-64 So Jesus had told them, and was telling of how that He had--had been confirming the Word, that He was the Messiah. And they should have known that, because their leader, Moses, told them, "The Lord your God shall raise up a prophet likened unto me."

L-65 And now when they seen those things take place, they still did not believe Him. Not because... I--I believe they believed Him, but they did not want to confess it, because of their traditions, because the Pharisees had said, "Any man or woman that would accept Him would immediately be put out of the synagogue." And they love their traditions more than they loved the vindicated Word of God.

L-66 And time hasn't changed, too much, this. You know, God takes His man but never His Spirit. Satan takes his man but never the spirit. He comes right back on someone else, and goes right on down. And now we find it in every generation, about the same.

L-67 And Jesus had clearly made Hisself known. He said, "If I do not the works of God, then don't believe Me. But if I do the works of God, then believe the works."

L-68 And then we find out all this, and still they did not believe. And they come to Him, after seeing all of those things, and then said, "Master, we would seek a sign from Heaven."

L-69 Now, we find that same class of people that wants to say, "Well, there's no such a thing as a miracle. Let me see it done. Let me look at it in my eyes. Let me examine it." Well, that person is absolutely hopeless. For, if you're ever saved, it's a miracle. You can only... You have to believe God. You cannot explain a miracle.

L-70 What if Moses would have said, "I believe I'll take a few of these leaves off, that's on fire, and take them over at the laboratory and let them be examined, and find out what, why they don't burn"? God would have never talked to him.

L-71 But he--he--he was... recognized that it was a miracle that the leaves, the tree, wasn't consumed. So he drew near to talk to it, and to take off his shoes, and humble himself before it. And God talked back to him.

L-72 Now, if we'll do the same thing, God will talk back to us. But you have to recognize it to be God. And the only way you'll ever get anything from God, is to believe Him. "He that cometh to God must believe that He is."

L-73 Now, if we were seeing things done that was not Scriptural, then you'd have a place to question. But when it's thoroughly proved by the Scripture, and then identified by the God Who wrote the Scripture and made the promise, then we should take off our shoes, as it was, and say, "Lord God, here am I." That's what we should do.

L-74 And that's what they, instead of that, they come and said, "We would see a miracle." Now, everybody is 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min miracle-seekers.

L-75 We find out that even the Devil, when he seen Jesus in that hunger condition, he said, "If thou be the Son of God, command these stones to be bread." See? "If thou be," he wasn't sure. But he wanted Him to do a miracle so he could see it. Now, that's just the way. See? You believe a miracle. You believe, to see a miracle.

L-76 Then we find out, in the courtyards, when we know that He discerned and could tell their thoughts, and know who touched Him. And all His whole life was--was a form of miracles, and He didn't take credit for it. He said, "It's not Me that doeth the works. It's My Father. He dwelleth in Me. He doeth the works. And verily I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in Himself. But what He sees the Father doing, that doeth the Son likewise." See? He give all credit to the Father. And here He was, going about, doing these works.

L-77 And then after all of that, when they caught Him up in the courtyards, and they put a rag around His face, like this, and took a stick of these drunken soldiers. Stood there, hitting Him on the head, and then passing the stick, one to another, and said, "If You are a Prophet now, prophesy and tell us which one hit You. We'll believe You." He knowed which it was.

L-78 But, you see, a man of God, or a servant of God, don't clown for the Devil. See? They're not obligated to do that.

L-79 You've heard them say, "Well, if there's such a thing... You people believe in Divine healing. I know where somebody is sick. Go over here at the hospital, a whole group of them."

L-80 That would probably be like that same group, when blind Bartimaeus come out, when they was making fun of Him, perhaps said, "Hey, we heard You heal, You raise the dead. We got a graveyard full of them up here, saints. Go up and raise them, if You raise the dead." See, that same old critical devil.

L-81 When He was hanging on the cross, he said, "If You're the Son of God, come down from there and we'll believe You." See? He could have done it. They gave a comment to Him, and didn't know they did it. They said, "He saved others. Himself He cannot save." Certainly not. If He saved Himself, He couldn't save others. So He gave Hisself, to save others. I'm glad that He did it. Certainly. See? Now we find Him there, you see.

L-82 But it's that same old spirit, "You do something here. Let me see it done." Why, God couldn't work where such a thing as that was.

L-83 Jesus went into a multitude of people one time, and said a dead girl was only asleep, and they laughed Him to scorn. And He put them, every one, out of the house, before He raised her up. See? He had to do it.

L-84 One time He took a blind man, led him out of the city and spit on his eyes, in order, let Him get him away from the crowd.

L-85 Where there's unbelief, God can't work. You've got to have belief. And if we could get ourselves in that condition, tonight, to doubt every doubt, and believe every Word of God, and to know that Jesus Christ is alive, and it's Him showing Himself, then, I'll tell you, the newspapers will write headlines in--in Tucson in the morning. What would take place in the building, if you could just get in that accord!

L-86 But these men who had seen all these things done, and heard about it, and the thing, and they had to answer their congregation. They had to say it was something. It was done. And they said, "It's Beelzebub." And so they come over, said, "Now, we would seek a miracle. We would seek a sign from Heaven, seek a sign from You." He had already done so many signs, so He never, there's no Scripture said He did any signs.

L-87 Now, God, in all ages, has never been without a witness. God has sometime got down to only one man. But He's always had a witness, somebody who believed Him, somebody who could believe in the supernatural, somebody who could believe God, just the way it's written and just what He is. And He referred to them here, as we find out. In all ages He had His witness everywhere.

L-88 Now He referred here, in one place, to "Jonas," called here, but we call it Jonah. And many people criticize Jonah, and said, "Oh, old Jonah!" You've heard that name. But I want to--I want to take up for Jonah, a little while. 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min

L-89 Jonah wasn't out of the will of the Lord. Jonah was in the will of the Lord. He was a prophet. He was referred to, and called in the Bible, "The prophet, Jonah." And he was not out of the will of the Lord. I read a little, some comments on it, like a history, some time ago.

L-90 And now, Jonah truly was told by the Lord to go down to Nineveh, a city four or five times the size of this city here. And it was, there, the great commercial city of the world. Nineveh was, in that day, very much backslidden. And--and they fished at the sea. And they had got away from the true and living Word of God, and begin to worship animals and--and sea monsters, and so forth. They were in a polluted and awful condition. God told him, "Go down to Nineveh."

L-91 And we find out that he came down to the seashore and took a ship to Tarshish. Now, someone would believe there that he did just what God told him not to do.

L-92 Let's find out if the footsteps of the righteous isn't ordered of the Lord. And if we're trusting Him with all our heart, though we make a mistake, God will make it work around to His glory.

L-93 Jonah! We find out, out on the sea, that the storms begin to rage, and the ship begin to toss back and forth, and all hopes that they could be saved was gone. And Jonah probably been preaching, a few nights before that, and was tired. And he was down in the hull of the ship, taking a little siesta, kind of napping a little bit. And they come down and told him, "Wake, O sluggard, and call upon your God."

L-94 And Jonah said, "Now, I'll tell you what I want you to do. I want you to tie my hands behind me, and my feet, and throw me out of the ship." And said, "Then the ship will cease the tossing, the waves, the ship; will quit tossing the ship, in otherwise, if you'll just throw me out."

L-95 So, you see, when they did that, and throwed him out, God had a great fish prepared, that we believe to be a whale.

L-96 And now that's disputed by science. Here, a few years ago, I was in Louisville, Kentucky, just across from my home city of Jeffersonville, Indiana. Just the Ohio River separates the two cities. And they had a whale, the skeleton of a whale, on a--on a flat car. And there was a man standing there, who was giving a lecture on this whale. And he said... Now, he come up. I thought, "Wonder if he... What's he going to say?"

L-97 He was talking about the size of its mouth, how that a man could walk into its mouth easy, and said, "You know that Bible story they tell," and a great big opossum grin over his face. And he said, "You know, they said about the whale swallowing Jonah." Said, "I want you to know that that could not be so." He said, "Because, if you'll notice the whale's throat," said, "even... it could not even pass no more than a--a four-inch ball through its esophagus, down through its throat." Said, "That was not so. That's just a mythical story."

L-98 That was too much for my Irish temper, to stand that. I said, "I beg your pardon. It is so."

L-99 He said, "Sir," he said. "Here is a whale," he said, "and it's a large type of whale." He called what it was. Said, "Go back there, if you want to satisfy yourself, and measure the swallow that he would have to go through, and tell me if a grown man could go through that swallow."

L-100 I said, "It's just because you're an unbeliever." I said, "This was a special-made whale. God said 'He prepared a fish.' He was a special, prepared. He could prepare one to throw the whole flat car in, if He wanted to. He is God." Uh-huh. So, that's right. God does what He wants to. And I believe that--that--that the whale swallowed Jonah.

L-101 As the little girl was coming one day from the tabernacle...

L-102 She was a little, about like this little snickle-fritz last night, or tonight, with her hair combed back here, you know. Her little... I thought she was cute. The little singer, I don't guess... She is bound to hear. I hope I don't hurt her feeling.

L-103 But, she was real cute. And this little girl had just got saved, and she had her Bible over her heart, just singing.

L-104 There was an old infidel lived up the road there, in a little city called Utica, Indiana. And he said, "What you so happy about this morning?" She said, "Well, I just found Jesus." 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min

L-105 Said, "How do you know you found Him?" He said, "What's that you got in your hand, a prayer book?" She said, "No. It's a Bible." Said, "I guess you believe It?" Said, "I believe every bit of It."

L-106 And said, "You believe that story in there about Jonah and the whale?" She said, "Yes, sir. I believe every word of it." He said, "Ah, it's not so, honey. Don't you believe That." She said, "But I believe it is so."

L-107 "Well, now," said, "how you going to prove that it's so, outside of faith, as you call it?"

L-108 "Well," she said, "when I get to Heaven, I'm going to ask Jonah." So...

L-109 And the infidel said to the little girl, said, "What if Jonah isn't There?"

L-110 Said, "Then you'll have to ask him." So that's just about the way it is, you know. If he wasn't There, they know where he was at.

L-111 So, it's just like It said. If the Bible said that Jonah swallowed the whale, I'd believe it, if the Bible said so. So I believe that all those things are true, every Word of It, every phase of the Bible.

L-112 And many people bawling out Jonah. Now let's, as Christians... being that we're talking about him, as one of the fellows here that Jesus referred to. Back, many years before Christ, he was a sign to that generation. And let's just think of him a minute.

L-113 There he was, with his hands tied behind him, and his feet. And the whale was prowling through the waters, to find something to eat. Well, when a fish eats, we know he goes right down to the bottom and rests, them swimmers, on the bottom of the--of the ocean.

L-114 Feed your little goldfish, and watch him. He gets his little belly full, he'll go right down to the bottom of the jar and rest a while. He is fed, just like any other animal.

L-115 The African lion, when he... He prowls till he finds something to eat, and he'll kill anything. He just soon have missionary chops, as anything. So, but when he--when he eats, he'll go over and lay down. And you could walk right over him; he wouldn't bother you. He might get up and roar, a young lion, or run you away, but he has eaten. That's all. He uses his great strength just to kill, to eat.

L-116 And the fish, when he had eaten, he had went down to the bottom now. And he was pretty well filled up, I guess, in his stomach. He had this prophet down there, in his belly. And I always kind of felt sorry for him, because you...

L-117 People is always talking about, "Well, Brother Branham, I had a crippled hand, and I was prayed for, a week ago. Brother So-and-so, my pastor, prayed for me, and really I'm no better." You'll never get no better, as long as you look at the hand. You can't look at the hand. You got to look at the promise. You always look and say, "Well, I been having an ulcer in my stomach, and it still burns." That, that don't have one thing to do with it. You've got to believe. That's the thing that does the healing, is your faith. See?

L-118 Now, look. Talk about symptoms? Jonah had a real case of symptoms. Looky here. Let's think he was backslid. And he's in the belly of the whale, maybe forty fathoms deep in the ocean, in a storm on the ocean, and laying in vomit up to his neck, looking around, sea weeds wrapped around him, everywhere. And he looked this way, it was whale's belly. That way was whale's belly. This way was whale's belly. Everywhere he could see, was whale's belly. Now, he had a good case of symptoms. There is nobody in here, that bad off, tonight. I'm sure.

L-119 But you know what Jonah said? He said, "They're lying vanities. I won't look to them, but once more will I look to Your holy temple." There you are. He refused to see the whale's belly. He refused to see the symptoms.

L-120 Why? He knowed that when Solomon dedicated that temple to God, when the great Pillar of Fire and cloud hung out there, That (the prayer of Solomon) passed over and went down and took Its resting place with the ark of the 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min covenant. And when--when Solomon prayed, he prayed, "Lord, if Thy people anywhere be in trouble and look towards this holy mountain, or this holy place, and pray, then hear from Heaven. And Jonah had confidence that God heard the prayer of Solomon, because he was a servant of God.

L-121 And if he could have that much faith upon the prayer of a man that was dedicating an earthly temple; and a man, praying the prayer, that finally, in his life, backslid; and under them circumstances, with them kind of symptoms, could have that much confidence that God would hear his prayer; how much more ought we, tonight, who is setting in the Presence of the resurrected Jesus Christ, look away from our symptoms, to the Heaven Itself, where Jesus sets at the right hand of God, with His Own Blood, to make intercessions upon our confession! When, thousands around us and around the world, where the great healing revivals are striking now, right at this very hour there is people being healed, all around the world. The hour is here.

L-122 Now, we look at our symptoms? Shame on us. When, Jonah, and under them circumstances, could look away from his symptoms. He said he refused to look at them. He said, "They're lying vanities. I'll look towards Your holy temple."

L-123 O God, give us men and women with rugged faith, who will not look to symptoms or look at anything the Devil hands you! Hand it back to him. Say, "I believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe in His all-sufficient power. I believe that His Presence is here now to set me free from any bondage that Satan put upon me. And I look to the... Where He sits, at the right hand of God, ever living to make intercessions for me."

L-124 With His Own Blood, as the High Priest, He sets There, over it. How much more ought we to look to the Holy Place of God, where Jesus Himself, our Mediator, the only One between God and man, stands with His Own Blood, to make intercessions on our confession! Amen. Don't get... Amen means "so be it." I believe it with all my heart. Notice.

L-125 You know what God did? This is a baffle to scientists. He... I don't know whether He put a oxygen tank down there, or what He did, but that man stayed alive for three days and nights, in the belly of that whale. I don't know what He done. But He took him a free ride, all the way from Tarshish, back over to Nineveh.

L-126 And you know, the commercial men of that city, their occupation mainly was fishing. And one day as... They worshipped the whale, being "the god of the sea," the greatest monster in the sea. When all the men was out, about eleven o'clock one day, pulling their nets in, up come "the god of the sea," that they had worshipped. He run up to the bank, stuck his tongue out, and the prophet walked right out of his mouth. Their own god spit the prophet out. No wonder they believed him. God had produced it for them. And no wonder they repented, and put sackcloth on the animals. They believed his message. God knows how to do things.

L-127 Look what Jesus said here about Jonah, see, about him. He said, "A--a wicked and an adulterous generation seeketh after a sign." I might stress your faith a little bit here, but I believe that He was referring to this generation. I'm going to tell you why. For, we know that this is a wicked and an adulterous generation.

L-128 There's never been a time, since Sodom, that homosexuals and perversion was on the march as it is now. You ought to go in my office and read the mail of mothers from California and around, about their boys' living. Oh, it's terrible! And I picked up a paper here, a couple years ago, flying over Los Angeles, and where it said that--that the great sin of Sodom was on such an increase there till it had increased twenty percent over the year before. And all out through, even to government officials, and it's everywhere. Sin!

L-129 It's because that women has made themselves so cheap. They have brought it upon themselves. And it's--it's a cheap affair. Used to be, you took off your hat, to a woman on the street. And now you'd do it, she'd laugh in your face. See? You--you... We've made ourself a bunch of corruption, so degrading ourselves.

L-130 Now we notice that, we find that Jesus said that, "A wicked and an adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be a sign given unto it. For as Jonas was in the belly of the whale, three days and nights, so the Son of man will be in the--be in the heart of the earth, three days and nights."

L-131 What was He speaking of? A wicked and adulterous generation would receive a sign of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And that's what we're doing. We know tonight that He is not dead, but He's alive forevermore, and He's with us. 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min

L-132 In this time of church world, and church joining, and formalism, and things that we have in the world today, and lukewarm church members, scoffers, making fun, "Having a form of godliness, and denying the power of the Holy Spirit," which, we're commanded to turn from. In that very hour, of that wicked and adulterous generation, Jesus Christ rises, and in the power of His resurrection, to prove that He's alive forevermore, the same yesterday, today, and forever. A wicked and adulterous generation will seek after a sign, and it will get it. There'll be this sign given them, of the resurrection. I think we're living to see it today.

L-133 Then He goes to, refer to, Solomon's generation, when Solomon came on the scene. Now, we all know, as minister brothers and readers, that that was--that was the Millennium, almost, for Israel. That was the golden age of Israel. They built the temple in that age. They had no wars.

L-134 Solomon was a gifted man. God had give him a great gift of discernment. And everybody in the land, with one heart and one accord, believed in that gift. It was the talk of the world, everywhere. Everybody feared them because that--that they knowed that there was a living God among them.

L-135 Wouldn't it be nice tonight, if all of the United States, if all America, would accept the gift that God has given us, the Holy Ghost, and with one accord we would agree upon it, and support it, and--and just like they did in that day? Oh, what a golden age it would be! The great gift, "the Greater than Solomon is here," but we don't give it the respects that they did in the day of Solomon.

L-136 When they seen this great gift working in Solomon, everybody believed, with one heart and one accord. The tribe of--of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, and all the other tribes, there was no difference in them. They was with one heart and one accord. They'd get together, and they'd say, "Just think of our great Jehovah! He sent us a gift, and it dwells within a man."

L-137 And the great things, why, the--the fame of Solomon went all over the world. And the other nations paid him tribute, sent him oxen, camels, and great gifts of gold, and--and helped him with the stone and everything, to build the temple.

L-138 That's what America needs, tonight; is not a new addition to politics; it's not a new denomination in the church; it's not something of that sort. They need to come together in one accord, and believe and accept the gift of the Holy Ghost that God has sent to us in this last days, where this great latter-day miracle revivals has broke out across the land.

L-139 But, any age, when God sends a gift to a nation, and that nation turns that gift down, that nation goes into chaos. Did you know, about fifty years ago, that, Russia, the pentecostal Blessing broke out in Russia, about fifty or seventy-five years ago, before it ever come here? That's right. And they turned it down, and you see what they got. Any nation! Look at England today; when the great Wesley revival, those great reform. Look at the nations that where the great revival struck, and when they turned it down, what happened to them.

L-140 And any nation that will receive a blessing that God sends, that nation prospers.

L-141 I tell you. I believe, tonight, that our safety is not in building bomb shelters or something like that. I believe our protection is made out of feathers. Under His wings, we'll rest. Oh, yes!

L-142 How you going to get in a bomb shelter? One of them bombs will blow a hundred and fifty miles square, and five hundred foot deep, in the earth. Why, it'd shake every bone in you, loose, if you was plumb down to the lava.

L-143 But there is a safety place, and that's in Jesus Christ. "Upon this rock I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell can't prevail against It." That's the believer's protection, just under His wings, safely abiding. Certainly.

L-144 Notice this great time, if people would just believe what God sent them! But, to turn It down, is to go in chaos. And that's what we've done, as a nation, have turned down the blessings of God, and swapped It for tradition. But God has sent a witness, and the people has failed to see it.

L-145 And I think that the Pentecostal people, as many things as God has sent you, and yet our churches set half empty. The pastor can't do it himself. The laity has got to help in this. We're all a partner.

L-146 That's what started the chaos at the first time, at the Nicaea council. They wanted, when, "The doctrine of the 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min Nicolaitanes." Nico means "to conquer," and laity means "take away from the laity, make a holy man."

L-147 That's not a holy man, holy hill. It's a holy God, a holy God amongst people. The laity has part of it. We are children. There's no great ones among us. How can you have faith when you desire respects one from another? We're all one, in Christ Jesus. There no big men and little men. We're all the same. We're children of one Father, and we're His children.

L-148 Now we notice, God has done great things for this nation. He sent a Tommy Osborn, an Oral Roberts, and--and many great men, across the country, dangled every little gift in front of the people.

L-149 But it's just like an old sailor, one time, going to the sea. The man said to him, this old salt... He had never... This man, a poet, had wrote about the sea, and talked about it, but he had never seen it. So, he was coming down to--to the sea. And, oh, he said... Met the old salt. And he said, "Where goest thou, my good man?"

L-150 He said, "Down to the sea, to hear the gulls, and to see its briny waves, and to see the blue sky reflect itself into the water."

L-151 The old salt puffed his pipe, four or five times, and said, "I don't see nothing so excited about it. I was born on it, fifty years ago." Sure. He had seen so much of it till it become common to him.

L-152 That's what's the matter with the Pentecostal people today. There'll come a time when this privilege will be taken from us. Then you'll cry for it, but won't find it. See? You've seen so much.

L-153 A woman here, not long ago in Louisville, Kentucky. She had a little baby, and she was going around, little boy about two years old, it was. She had him in her arms, and she'd pick up little things. She'd say, "Look, honey, look." And the little kid would just set and stare. She'd walk over to something else, say, "Darling, look at this." And the people in the store begin to watch her. She begin to get hysterical. And so she picked up a little rattle, which ought to attract a little boy like that. Said, "Look, honey. Look, look, look, honey. Look, darling, look." And the little boy just stared.

L-154 And she fell over on the counters. The people come over to her and picked her up, to find out what was the matter. She said, "My little boy," she said, "he just started staring in space." And said, "I took him to the doctor, and the doctor says he's better. But the things that should attract a little boy like him doesn't attract him anymore. He just seems to be blind to it."

L-155 That's something like the church today. God has shook every kind of gift before the church, that He promised to shake, and still we stare in space. See? "Sirs, we would... Sir, Master, we would desire a sign from Thee." See? "Master, we would desire this." When, He's done everything, in the Bible, He promised to do. We're at the end time.

L-156 And the first thing you know, you're going to find out, you say, "Well, isn't it written that we should have a Rapture?"

L-157 And it'll be like it was by John the Baptist. They said, "Isn't it written in the Scripture that there should be, first, there would be Elias come?" He said, "Elias has already come and you didn't know it."

L-158 One of these days, when Tribulation sets, you'll say, "Wasn't there to be a Rapture first?"

L-159 And it'll be, "It's already past, and you knew nothing about it." See? It'll come like a thief in the night.

L-160 I tell you, it's time for believers to trim their lamps, get on their toes. The calling time is at hand. We should remember that.

L-161 Solomon, they believed him, all the people, with one heart and one accord, and no wonder the message went everywhere.

L-162 But, today, if God sends something, if it strikes a--a certain denomination, church, the others won't have nothing to do with it. No, sir. If it strikes the Baptists, don't look for the Methodists to do anything. If it strikes the Pentecost, look for both of them to stay out, 'cause they'll sure do it. So there you are. Depends on where it's from. It's got to come 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min through their circle or it is no good.

L-163 That's the same thing they thought when God sent Jesus, that He would have to send Him through the Pharisees, or the Sadducees, or some of them. And He sent Him to all of them, through none of them. That's the way God does. He just... He, see, He never come to any of them. He come, called them a bunch of snakes in the grass. That's right.

L-164 And so we find out that God does things in His Own way. And we can't cut and dry anything, and say, "This is my part, and you have no business. You don't see through my glasses, you're not looking." No. God has got the glass for us to see through, that's the Holy Spirit. Then it sees the Word of God and believes It, and loves and fellowships, and the blanket is far enough for the neighbor. And you know what I mean.

L-165 The world is dying for a little love, and somebody to care for them. That's right. They seen so much of this cold, stiff, starchy stuff. But, I tell you, this old-time case of salvation will make a--a calico dress and a silk dress put their arms around one another. It'll make a tuxedo and a pair of overalls call one another "brother." It sure will. It'll take the starch right out of you, when you really get Christ in your life, in the right way. Certainly will.

L-166 Now, we find out that Solomon, the great age, that his fame went everywhere throughout all the lands, and the passers-by heard of it. They taken it into other countries. And the--the only way they had then, was not television and things that they have today, and newspapers. It was from lip-to-ear. And their caravans would come through, and passing through, and pick up trade, and take it to the other nations. And finally his fame reached way down across the Sahara desert, into a place called Sheba.

L-167 It's called here, "The queen of the South." Let's talk about her, a few minutes. She was a little, heathen queen. She had been raised to worship idols.

L-168 But, you know, "Faith cometh by hearing, hearing of the Word of God."

L-169 And way down in there, the Word got, that, "God, a living God, was living among His people." And her little heart begin to jump for joy.

L-170 And every time a traveler would pass through, into her kingdom, to make trade, of spice and whatever they had to swap, and so forth, and jewels, why, she would call them to the castle, and say, "Have you passed through Palestine?" "Yes."

L-171 "You went through Israel. Say, I want to ask something. Is it true that their God is among them?"

L-172 "Oh, I seen it! You should. Why, you never seen anything like it. Their God has come down and anointed one of their brethren, and they have made him the king. And, oh, it, you ought to see the unity of the people! They're all with one heart and one accord. And that God is just raining down blessings. And he has a great, powerful gift of discernment. And he just... When you come before him, it's beyond human. It's--it's supernatural, how he can know things."

L-173 Her little heart begin to beat. "There is something real." She wanted to see that. Well, it went on and on. First thing you know...

L-174 You know, faith cometh by hearing. And when God goes to dealing with the human heart, there is something takes place inside, that you just can't account for. Every day, she begin to thirst. She wanted to see it.

L-175 You know, the Bible said, "Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled."

L-176 Now we find out. Let's just dramatize it a little, so the children will catch it. I can think of one day she had made up her mind that she was going to find out whether it was the truth or not.

L-177 That's a good thing. Well, like we said about Philip last night, "Come, see for yourself."

L-178 She had begin to maybe purchase a--a Bibles, the Old Testament, with the parchments, the scrolls. And she begin to read, to see what this God was, that they were talking about. She seen how He worked in His nature.

L-179 And then she finds out that the very nature and life of that God was being manifested through a man, making 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min Hisself known to His people, through the people, what He promised to do. Well, her heart begin to hunger, to see it. So now she...

L-180 One day, she took a notion that she was going to go see it, for herself.

L-181 Now, that's a good idea. Go find out, for yourself. Don't take what somebody else says. Go find out. "Search the Scriptures," Jesus said, "for in Them you think you have Eternal Life. And They are They that testify of Me." Just what He said.

L-182 Notice now. The little lady, to do this, had a lot of hindrances.

L-183 Now, the first thing she had to do, she, first, she'd have to go to her pagan priest and get permission, because she was a queen, a woman of honor. And the state church, you know, there, had to. They had to give consideration, because she was going to have to--to leave her own religion, to go find out about another one that she knowed nothing about, but was hungry to know about it. So I can imagine she walks up to the holy father of the pagan temple, and she said, "Holy Father, I desire... I hear that over in Israel they got a--a great God over there, that's making Hisself known through His people. They're doing great signs, and wonders, and miracles."

L-184 I can hear the priest say, "Now, my daughter, that's nothing but a bunch of holy-rollers. Don't you listen to that. See? Now, if there is anything going on, it would be right here in our own group. You see the great goddess Dagon and all these others here? You see these great gods we have here?" The little queen walked, a few minutes.

L-185 You know, if God goes to dealing with the human heart, it's hard to talk anybody away from it. See?

L-186 She said, "But, look, sir." She said, "They tell me that the actual results happens. There is something takes place, that God uses human lips, with such wisdom that's supreme to any known person. It's beyond finding out, the power that God has given among His people. And they're all in one accord. I want to go see it."

L-187 "Why," he said, "you, you would lower your prestige, dear, if you left this church. You cannot attend that revival. So, we're not sponsoring that."

L-188 But, you know, somehow, if--if--if a human heart goes to hungering for God, sponsor or no sponsor, you're going, anyhow, see, when--when God goes to dealing with the human being. And I hope you don't think I'm critical, but I'm just making a point. See?

L-189 Now notice. The first thing you know, why, she said, "Look. Now, look. I have been in this temple since I was dedicated here as a little girl. My mother was dedicated here. My grandmother was dedicated here. You've told me all about the power of that god. You've told me all the books you've read about him. And he hasn't made one move. All I've seen, some reading on a paper, just a dead bunch of creeds. But they tell me there is something up there that's alive." Amen. Bless that little queen's heart! "All I know is some creed that I said here. I haven't seen a move of supernatural or nothing else. Surely, through some of our generation, there had been a move somewhere. Only, just a little emotion, to get us all to come in and worship. But they tell me that this is a living God that's living in His people. And that's a statue."

L-190 "Now, looky here, dear. I'll have you excommunicated. Your name will be taken right off the book if you cooperate up there. See?"

L-191 But it made no difference to her. You know, she had a lot of hindrances, but her faith didn't have any.

L-192 Your faith don't have no hindrances. I don't care where it's at, what it is, no matter who says not. If God begins to deal with that human heart, begins to pulsate in there, that it's the Truth, and you find it to be the Truth, there's nothing going to keep you from Jesus Christ. Right. You're going, anyhow.

L-193 So no matter how many creeds he could recite, and how well educated he was, and how he could bow, and how he could prostrate himself before the idol, that didn't make one bit of difference to her. She was thirsting for God. She wanted to find out, and she wasn't going to be satisfied until she found out, herself. She had seen in the Scripture, that's what He was supposed to be. But, now, will it work? That's the next thing.

L-194 You can talk about anything, but will it work? You can tell all the mathematics of it, but will it work? Is the next 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min thing. Now we find out.

L-195 Now, another thing she had to confront. Now, she thought, if she went up there. Remember, the desert was full of Ishmael's children, and they are fleet-footed riders and robbers. The whole desert was full of robbers in them days. Well, the little lady, she thought this, "I'm going up to find out if it's true. I'm going to take some offering, and if it's right, I'll support it. If it isn't right, I can bring my offering back."

L-196 Pentecostal people ought to listen to that woman. Support things that makes fun of you? Let your own radio program go down, and everything else of your own people? All right.

L-197 She had some common sense. She said, "If I find it's the truth, it's worth everything to me. But if it isn't the truth, then I'll know it isn't the truth. I'll go and see for myself. And I'll take..." She loaded camels with frankincense, and--and myrrh, and gold, and silver, and costly spices, and--and things that were values. She loaded camels.

L-198 And now remember, she didn't go up on an air-conditioned Cadillac. She had to go on the back of a camel, through the Sahara desert.

L-199 No wonder Jesus said she'll stand in the generation, condemn this generation. And some people here can know the same thing going on, and won't walk across the street.

L-200 Measure how far it is from Palestine, from--from Jerusalem, down to where she was. You know how long it taken them? Three months, on the back of a camel, through a burning hot desert. And what did she have? Just a few eunuchs and her maids with her. Probably had to travel by night. The direct heat of that Sahara desert is terrible, scorch you right down. And she had to travel by night.

L-201 But, you know, there is something about it, that if your heart begins to hunger and thirst for God, you don't pay any attention to dangers or somewhere. Doctor might say you're going to die with a cancer. But if your heart ever strikes faith in God, you know, you forget what the doctor said. Your heart knows no fear, as long as it's filled with faith.

L-202 On she went, traveling by night, day in and out, day in and out, reading those scrolls. "Now let's see what Jehovah is, what He was, what He promised, and so forth, what He will be. And I'll find out whether that's Him in this man. I know what men are. And I believe I'll know what the God is, because I've read what He was."

L-203 And let me say this to Tucson tonight, He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. That's right. He cannot change. People changes. Time changes. But He's the unchangeable God, with an unchangeable Message. It cannot be swapped for creeds. It cannot be swapped to denominational standings. It's got to be the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ in new Birth, by the Holy Ghost. That's God's requirement. There's nothing less or nothing more, but that.

L-204 Now we find out, finally, after all her--her troubles and so forth; her heart, thirsting. And as she begin to near the city of Jerusalem, I can see her eyes brighten up. And she put the scrolls away, and she pitched camp right outside, maybe at the palace gate somewhere, getting ready for the meeting. Now, maybe arrived in the evening time.

L-205 The next morning, early, she went to the church where the pastor was going to speak. And while she come to the church, she seen all the people taking their places, and the music begin to play. And after while, Pastor Solomon walked out. Maybe she had a seat way back in the back of the church, but she was willing to stay, to see what was to be said.

L-206 She wasn't like people of today. You say one thing that don't... somebody don't agree with, they haven't got the patience as long as a second. See? So that's the reason they get nowhere. But she wanted to be satisfied. Now, she didn't come to say, "I'll just go up there," like people do today, "and the first word that evangelist says, that's a little contrary to what I believe, I'll get up and walk out." See? Well, maybe they do that. See? But it shows poor raising, in the first place, and it shows poor manners. But, anyhow, people do that today. Because, they feel they don't have to do it. They don't. But you have to meet God, and you'll have to answer.

L-207 Now we find out that this woman, she got, come, just not to stay for one message, she come to stay till she was convinced whether it was right or wrong. And she taken her place, and she waited. 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min

L-208 And then the first one come up before Solomon. She noticed that the wisdom of that discernment told that person just exactly all the secrets of the heart. Her heart begin to jump. She knowed that there was something real. And the next case come by, was the same thing. Then she begin to thirst, herself.

L-209 She had many problems, the Scriptures tells us, that she wanted to know about. And as she come, finally, maybe she got her a prayer card. Maybe her number was called, we'd say it, just for saying it. But when she got before Solomon, however way it was, when she got up before Solomon, the Bible said that there was nothing that wasn't made known to Solomon that he didn't reveal to her. All the things that she had, hidden in her heart, Solomon revealed it by the Spirit of God. And when she seen this happen, all the--the life almost was gone out of the little queen.

L-210 She stood up among the people, and she said, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel. Blessed be the Lord God Who has chosen Israel for His people, and has put His Spirit upon His king and has showed this wisdom." Said, "Blessed are the men that's with you all the time, that see this great gift operate. Blessed are you, and to see you." She wanted, even, to take some of the dirt from--from up in Israel down to her country. She was thoroughly convinced that it was God. And she said, "All that I have been told about it, I didn't hardly know whether to believe it or not. But now I seen it work on others, and now it's worked on me, and I know that it's right."

L-211 No wonder Jesus said, "She'll rise in the Day of the Judgment and condemn this generation. And, behold, a greater than Solomon is here." Solomon was a man with a gift of discernment. Now, Jesus Christ is here in the form of the Holy Ghost, with--with all the Divine gifts in the whole body of Christ, being made manifest. All the things that He promised to the Church, is being shown unto us.

L-212 And some of us care so little. Some of us are so: we keep looking ahead. As long as Satan can make you look ahead for something over yonder, you're passing over the very thing that God has given you.

L-213 Listen to this remark. "Man is constantly praising God for what He has done, and looking forward to what He will do, and ignoring what He's doing." That's the status of mankind. He's always did that, and the same thing is tonight. Men look over, and look back, and see what God does; and talk about a great God back yonder at Pentecost, and looking for a great Day of a Millennium when He will come again, and ignoring His very Being in the presence of His people, making ready for that Millennium. They ignore it. It's just the nature of people to do that.

L-214 Satan gets among them, to hide their eyes from the very thing that God sent to them. That's all he has to do. You go to church as much as you want to, do whatever you wish to, but to ignore the very things that God sends to us, why, we're--we're turned--turned down.

L-215 What made that little woman say that? She seen something real. She seen something that wasn't just a bunch of creeds. She seen something was manifested and was genuine.

L-216 To me, anything that's proven to be genuine, is genuine. I think, today, that the whole world should be interested. If we believe that we're living in the end time, and we believe that the Coming of the Lord Jesus is at hand, we ought to be exactly interested in the things that's going on of this day. We ought to examine it by the Word of God. Because, we'll drop right by, it'll be past and we'll know nothing about it. That's the way it's always been.

L-217 The people never knowed the saints until they were dead. They never recognize the prophets until they were dead. Jesus said, "You hypocrites." Said, "How you garnish the--the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers put them in there." They never recognized Saint Patrick until he was dead.

L-218 Joan of Arc, they never recognized her to be a saint. The Catholic church burnt her, to a stake, for a witch, because she seen visions. And called her a witch, and burnt that woman, to a stake, crying for mercy. Couple of hundred years later, they found out that she was a saint. Course, they done penance. They dug up them priests' body and throwed it in the river. Penance. Certainly.

L-219 It goes right over the top of their head, and they don't know it. God does it that way, to get out His elected children, and to bring condemnation upon the world who rejects His Word and rejects His Presence. 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min

L-220 Look at all those ministers in that day, looking upon the gift of God in Jesus Christ, and said, "It was a devil. We don't have to hear to Him. Our priests disagrees with That." Where they at tonight?

L-221 And look at that little old ill-famed woman, that little predestinated Seed of God burning in her heart. And as soon as That flashed across, she said, "Sir, I perceive that You're a prophet, and I know Messiah is coming to do this," see, as soon as the first thing flashed, that little predestinated Seed in her heart.

L-222 Her name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world. And so was yours, if it ever be There. See? That's right.

L-223 And as soon as that flash come there! And she knowed that that was the hour they were looking for, a Messiah, and that's what He was to do. And when she seen it happen, she knowed it was the Messiah then, and she never questioned Him any more. She run into the city, and said, "Come, see a Man that told me the things that I've done. Isn't that the very sign of the Messiah?" She seen something real.

L-224 This little queen seen something real. It changes the heart of people.

L-225 Reminds me. As all of you know, I--I like to hunt. I used to hunt, up in the mountains in the East. In closing now, I just want to tell you this. A little incident happened. Oh, I--I love the sunsets. I love nature. I love to hear the call. They're killing off all the coyotes and things. How I love to hear them holler! I--I--I--I... Just something about it! I love it. And I love outdoors, the deep calling into the Deep. It's God, to me. Hear the whispering of the pines, and of the call of the birds, is God in it, to me.

L-226 Now notice. I used to go up there to hunt with a fellow called Burt. He was a good hunter. You didn't have to worry about him. He was a crack shot and a good hunter, and you didn't have to worry about him being lost. He knowed where he was at.

L-227 I got up there late, one year, to hunt with him. There's only one fault I found to Burt. He was a good hunter, but he was the meanest man I ever met in my life. He had eyes like a lizard, them, kind of like slanted eyes, you know, like some women paint their eyes today, over, kind of like a cat, and she had. Had them kind of eyes, you know, kind of funny-looking eyes. And he used to be so cruel. He used to shoot fawns just to make me feel bad. And he used to say to me, "Aw, you preachers are chicken-hearted bunch," See?

L-228 And I said, "Burt, if the law says you can kill a fawn, that's all right, 'cause the--the size or the sex of the animal doesn't matter if the law says you can do it." See? I said, "There's nothing about killing a lamb. Abraham killed a lamb and fed it to God. That's right." I said, "Nothing about killing a fawn. But, Burt, you do it just to be mean. You shoot one, then shoot another, then shoot another. That's mean. That's not right to do that. That's murder."

L-229 He said, "Ah, Billy, get next to yourself. You're chicken-hearted like the rest of the preachers." Oh! He was cruel.

L-230 But that day when I went up there, my wife was with me. We went to the little cabin, lodge there, and the women folks, and get ready. And Burt and I left that morning. We always carried a--a--a thermos bottle full of hot chocolate, and a sandwich. And we'd hunt up till about noon, and then we'd separate, going up over the Presidential Range, and Mount Wilson, Mount Adams, and so forth. And then we'd separate and come back and get in the camp that night. We hunted the whitetail deer, really fine deer. So we...

L-231 That year, he said to me, when we left that morning, said, "Hey, Billy, I got a surprise for you. I'm going to get them this year."

L-232 I said, "What's that, Burt?" Reached down in his pocket and pulled out a little whistle that he had made, sound just like a little baby deer calling for its mammy. You know, the little fawn calling, that little "whee" noise made. I said, "Burt, you wouldn't use something like that."

L-233 He said, "Aw, there you are. You're still chicken-hearted, aren't you?" And so we went on.

L-234 And it kind of late in the season. Them whitetail deer, when they are shot at, a few times, oh, my! You talk about hiding! Houdini was a amateur. So how they can hide! And so then we--we went till eleven o'clock. There was about six inches of snow on the ground. Didn't even see a track. They were really hid good. 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min

L-235 So, along about eleven, twelve o'clock, there was kind of a drift of snow, and an open place, something the size of this room here. And Burt just was in front of me. He just stooped down like this, and started reaching back in his coat here. And I thought he would, we'd eat our sandwich, and then we would separate and go back to the camp, get back that night. He was feeling back. I thought he was going to get his bottle out, you know, with his hot chocolate, so I reached back to get mine. And when I did, he come out with this little whistle.

L-236 He looked up at me with them lizard eyes, you know, and put that little whistle in his mouth, like that. And he blowed it, just like a little fawn, or little fellow calling for its mother. And when he blowed that whistle, just across that clearing, a big mother deer, a doe, stood up. That's the mother deer. She jumped up. She heard that call of the baby. I could seen him look up at me, like that, and grin. I thought, "Burt, you won't do that. Surely you won't." And he duck his head down. He blowed again.

L-237 I can just see her big ears, them big brown eyes. She walked right out in that open. Now, that's strange for a deer to do that, especially that time of day, and right out when hunting season is in, to walk out like that. But she walked right out into that opening, a little clearing, a little meadow. That's very unusual for her to do that. But why did she do it? She was a mother. She was actually born a mother. And that call of her baby, she didn't think about danger. She was thinking about her baby.

L-238 And when I seen her turn broadsided; Burt, I heard him let the bolt down on that.30-06, and he was a dead shot. I seen him raise around and put the cross hair of that scope right across her loyal heart.

L-239 I thought, "Burt, how can you do it? How can you do it? Surely you won't do it." I thought, "That mother, walking out there to take up for her baby, and then you would blow that loyal heart out of her. How can you do it, Burt?" And I stood there. I see him quieten himself down, leveling down like that.

L-240 I thought, "Oh, my! I--I can't watch it." I thought, "That mother, she can't help it." She's not acting smart. She's not putting on a show. She's a mother, in her. Her--her--her part, in her, she's a mother. And that was a baby calling, in trouble, and she's hunting for it.

L-241 And when the bolt fell, the deer turned and looked to the hunter, 'cause he had raised up. That still didn't excite her. She was ready to die. She... Oh, if people could just be like that!

L-242 I turned my head. I couldn't watch him shoot her. I turned my head. And I started praying, silently, 'cause I knowed he'd bawl me out if I tried to run her away. I--I turned my head like that, and I said, "Father God, help him. Help him. Don't--don't let him kill that mother, trying to hunt for her baby, and it crying like that. Don't--don't let him kill her." And I was turning, like this, and I noticed.

L-243 I was listening, to hear the gun go off, any minute, but the gun never went off. I waited and I waited. And when I turned around, to see, he was holding like this. I seen the gun going like this.

L-244 He turned around, looked up to me, and out of them cruel-looking lizard eyes, the tears was dropping off his cheeks. He throwed the gun on the ground. He grabbed me around the trouser leg. He said, "Billy, lead me to that Jesus that you know." Right there on that snow bank, I led that cruel hunter to Jesus. He's a deacon in a Baptist church up there now.

L-245 Why? What was it? It wasn't a preaching. It--it--it wasn't the songs that he heard. But he seen something that wasn't a put-on, something that wasn't a front. He seen something that was genuine. "If they hold their peace, the rocks will cry out." He saw that there was something somewhere that could send a person in the face of death, a love that could send that mother deer in the face of death, and yet not fear to die, because the love of her fawn calling. He wanted to know if there was a--a God that could give him that kind of love, and he found it that day.

L-246 Friends, a greater than Solomon is here. Jesus said one time... It was written in the Bible, rather, "Can a mother forget her suckling babe?" Said, "She might do that, but I can't forget you. Your names are engraved on the palms of 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min My hands." And they are, by nail prints in His hands.

L-247 We are looking. Surely, men and women who believe in Him, are looking to see something genuine. Wouldn't you like, tonight, to be as much Christian as that deer was a mother? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] See? She wasn't just an artificial mother. She was born, a mother. There was something in her, that she feared nothing, because it called her out. If we could just be that much Christian, as she was a mother! How many would like to have that experience? ["Amen."] "God, let me be ready, with loyalty to Jesus Christ, to walk in the face of criticism, to walk in the face of anything, and display my love of God. No matter if my--if my people turn me down, if everybody laughs at me, if everybody calls me old fashion, or whatever they do, let me display the love of Jesus Christ in my heart, as loyal as that deer could display motherhood." Do you want that in your heart? ["Amen."] Now bow your head and let's pray.

L-248 Heavenly Father, a greater than Solomon is here. A greater love is here than the love that that little story there of that mother deer that day. How she was ready to face that hunter, face that rifle, when she knowed, at any minute, her heart would be blowed from her. But, O God, when a man or woman, or even a beast, is ready to display love! I pray, Father, that every person in here will tonight receive that type of love, even greater love than this. May they not be ashamed to accept Jesus as their Saviour. May they not be ashamed of what He's done for them. May he... they never be ashamed to confess Him as Lord and Saviour. May they never be ashamed to accept Him as their Healer, for it is written, "by His stripes we were healed."

L-249 God, may You come tonight and be such a reality to us, that we will see the display of God among us, in such a way, that we will know that Jesus Christ, the crucified Lord, has risen from the dead and standing among us. Father, I believe, if You'll do it once more, before the people tonight, and show Yourself alive in a greater gift than Solomon had! It's the gift of the Holy Spirit to the Church. Then, men and women in here, Father, will be drawn to You. I commit it all to You now, Father, with this simple little story of the Bible, and of the little hunting trip that November day up there in the White Mountains. It's all Yours now, Father, and You take over from here. I commit myself to You, and this congregation, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

L-250 Now, Christian friends, if our Lord Jesus will show His love to you, that He loves you, and will come among us tonight, and will prove that He is here, it's Him. Now, anyone knows, as we have said. How would you know it was Jesus? See? How would you know that? This certain tree, looked like it was a sycamore tree, and if it was bearing peaches, what kind of a tree would it be? It'd be a peach tree. The life in it would bear peaches. And if you are a--a Christian, the Life of Jesus Christ is in you, because it is the Holy Spirit. You believe that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] And then the Holy Spirit...

L-251 If I told you that the spirit of John Dillinger was in me tonight, you'd expect me to have guns, and out here and be a robber like he was. If I told you the spirit of some great artist was in me, you'd expect me to be able to paint these mountains here just like they look, 'cause the spirit of that artist is in me. And if I tell you that the Spirit of Christ is in me, He said, Hisself, you'll do the works of Christ. Saint John 14:12 said, "He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also; greater works than this, do."

L-252 I quoted that once. The man said, "Sure, we do greater works. We preach the Gospel to all the world. He didn't do it in His day."

L-253 I said, "Just show me the works that He did, first, and then we'll talk about the greater." See?

L-254 Ninety percent of the world hardly knows nothing about Jesus Christ. Millions dying every year, that never heard His Name. More... It's less evangelized today than it ever was. Sure. Then talk about, "'Greater works,' preaching the Gospel." Certainly not.

L-255 Now, there's prayer cards, I guess, was given out today. I guess they give out prayer cards. And... [Someone says, "Yes."--Ed.] All right. Billy? Not here? Maybe he stepped out.

L-256 Well, have they got any prayer cards from yesterday? Raise up your hand, some was give out yesterday, you got. Well, we'll start with them. Let's see, where did we start? Where we start from yesterday? Number one, was it? Number 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min one to about ten or fifteen? All right.

L-257 Let's change it around, get somewhere else then. We want to get every one of them. But let's change, somewhere else. Let's take from... Let's take the last fifteen of them, from eighty-five to one hundred. Who has prayer card eighty-five? Raise up your hand.

L-258 Wait. There might be two eighty-five's. What was them first ones? A's, wasn't it? [Two brothers say, "A."--Ed.] A.

L-259 A, eighty-five. It's got an A on the card, and an eighty-five. A, eighty-five. Raise up your hand. Prayer card A, eighty-five. Is the lady here? All right. Come over here. Eighty-six, raise up your hand. Eighty-seven.

L-260 Now, if you can't get up, we'll see... The ushers will bring you right up here when your number is called.

L-261 Eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine. Ninety. Let's see, now, there be one, two, three, four, five. Ninety, ninety-one, -two, -three, -four, -five, up to a hundred. Line up on this side over here, up to a hundred.

L-262 Now, if--if they all are not there, and somebody has got a card, now, just hold your card, just keep it. By and by, I'm trying to get you.

L-263 Now, while you're looking this way, now, watch real close now. I want you to pay close attention to what I'm saying. Your prayer card has nothing to do with it, only to line you up here. That don't mean you're going to be healed. You're only healed, not by a prayer card, but by faith. That's right. How many has ever been in the meetings and know that there is ten-to-one healed out there in the audience than what is healed here, up here on the platform? Sure it is. It's your faith. Your faith. This is just get the prayer line started, that's all, get the prayer line.

L-264 Now look. Everyone has been taught this tradition. And I say it to my brothers. And which is all right. It's Scripture. But we want to lay hands on one another. Did you notice that? But that wasn't given to the Gentiles. That wasn't the way the Gentiles accepted it.

L-265 The Jews, remember, Jairus said, "Come lay Your hands upon my daughter and she'll live." That was a Jewish tradition. Is that right? "Lay Your hands upon my daughter and she live."

L-266 But the Gentile said, "I'm not worthy that You'd come under my roof. Just say the Word, that's all. My servant will live."

L-267 And Jesus turned around and said, "I never saw faith like that in Israel."

L-268 He said, "I'm a man under authority. When I..." And what did he recognize? That every disease was under the jurisdiction of Jesus Christ. All He had to do was speak the Word.

L-269 And He's already spoke It. See? And that's what I'm trying to get you people to recognize.

L-270 Now, many people think that you have to wait till some great evangelist like, oh, Brother Osborn... And Brother Osborn is a great evangelist. Brother, Brother Oral Roberts, another great evangelist. And--and Brother Tommy Hicks, and so many of these great evangelists that's in the land today, you think you have to wait till they come by, to be healed. That's not so, not so. Your pastor has the same authority that any of them does. Yes, sir.

L-271 There's no great men among us. If there is, then that person has excommunicated himself from the Fellowship. "We're all one in Christ Jesus." That's right. We are one. There's no great people among us. When you get great, you--you done took yourself out, away from God. We're not.

L-272 And--and if your pastor is not there, the only thing you have to do is to believe the Word that you've heard him preach about Jesus Christ. That's all. See? There is great things is done.

L-273 Now look. Let's think of that little woman we referred to last night. One time Jesus was crossing the ocean...

L-274 Wish we had time, a few weeks here in Tucson. Where, you see, the thing of it is, it's hard. You get into a place, it's all new to the people, they just see something once, say, "My, that's kind of strange, but I don't know." See? I'm not here long enough for you get acquainted, to see it.

L-275 Listen. I've seen tens of thousands of visions that the Lord God has given to me. And I know there's people here that's followed the meetings, perhaps many places. How many has ever been in other meetings? Let's see your hand. 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min Now I want to ask you something. There never has been one word spoke but what is exactly the truth. Is that right? If it is, say, "Amen." [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] No one can say... If there's anyone can say they ever seen one of them visions fail, you're at liberty to stand and tell me so. I can say that around the world, ten times millions of people.

L-276 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Little did they know what That was.

L-277 Now, the people from the tabernacle, just remember. There is some people here that's come in. I see two of my friends here, Mr. and Mrs. Dauch setting here, and Mrs. Brown, from up in Ohio. That thing of That being up there, and that noise that went off like that, that sent back for the Seven Seals, was foretold, every bit of it, weeks and weeks and weeks 'fore it come to pass. How many in here is a witness of that, was in the meetings and heard it told? Raise up your hands, is in the building. There you are. And science are struggling through it.

L-278 Like when George J. Lacy examined that, I told him. I said, "It's just like an amber Light. It burns there." And they said, "Oh, it's psychology."

L-279 Mr. Lacy said, "I thought it was psychology, too, but," said, "the mechanical eye of this camera won't take psychology." No. It was there. What is it? See?

L-280 Now watch. In the wilderness, when God led Israel through wilderness, He led the people through the wilderness by Christ. How many knows that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] How many knows that the Angel of the covenant was that Pillar of Fire, was Jesus Christ? ["Amen."] Certainly, it was. Sure. He said, He told them, there in Saint John 6.

L-281 They said, "He didn't look over fifty years old; and said, 'Before Abraham'?"

L-282 He said, "Before Abraham was, I AM." He was the I AM that was in the bush. And He said, "I..." He... They said, "We drank in water from the Rock."

L-283 And He said He was that Rock. Amen. See, not "I was." "I AM." He said, "I come from God, and I go to God."

L-284 Now, that same Pillar of Fire that was in the wilderness, with the children of Israel, was made flesh, incarnate God among us, in a form of being the Son of God, that overshadowed the virgin and brought Him, so God could become human to die, to pay the price of His Own law. See? It's the Gospel.

L-285 And then He said, now, "I come from God, and I go to God."

L-286 And immediately after His death, burial, and resurrection, there was a little Jew that was high-tempered and trying to put everybody in jail. And he was on his road down to Damascus, with orders from the high priest, to arrest everybody. And right about noontime, he was struck down in the road. And when he did, he looked up, and there was a great Light that put his eyes out. How many knows that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] The same Pillar of Fire. See?

L-287 And he said, "Lord!" Being a Jew, he knew that was the same Pillar of Fire that was in the wilderness. He said, "Lord, Who are You?"

L-288 He said, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me? It's hard for you to kick against the pricks." He said, "Lord, Who are You?"

L-289 Now, wait. The same Pillar of Fire, He said, "I am Jesus." Uh-huh. Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-290 Remember one night when Peter was in prison? The same Thing come into the jail, opened up the doors before him, and took him out.

L-291 What is it? Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Now, if that wasn't, if that was something else, it would do some other kind of a work. But if that is the same Holy Spirit that was in the wilderness with Israel, and also was in Jesus Christ, It's now in the Church. It does the same works because It's the same Light. See? It's the same Spirit. If you could just believe that, friend! Not me; Him! See? He's the High Priest.

L-292 A little woman, one day, she believed that He was the Son of God. She had a blood issue. And she said within her heart, "If I could just touch His garments!" 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min

L-293 I think she got that from, course, Elijah, and "taking the staff." And that's where I think Paul got, "laying handkerchiefs," and so forth, was what somebody else had done.

L-294 And she said, "If I can just touch His garment, I believe I'll be made whole." And she pressed through the crowd until she touched His garment. Now, the Palestinian garment hangs free, and it had an underneath garment. And so she went off and set down.

L-295 Physically, He could not have felt it, see, because the garment is a robe that hangs free. But, He stopped.

L-296 And everybody had their arms around Him, "Hello, Rabbi! Prophet of Israel, we're glad to have You over here with us," and so forth. Jesus stopped, said, "Wait a minute. Who touched Me?"

L-297 "Why," Peter said, "Lord!" He rebuked Him. In other words, said something like, "Lord, don't say nothing like that. The people will be wondering about You. Who 'touched' You? Everybody has got their arms around You. Everybody is patting You. Don't say, 'Who touched Me?'"

L-298 He said, "But this is a different kind of touch. See? I perceive that virtue has gone from Me."

L-299 He looked out over the audience. And the little woman may have been standing. She may be setting. Or, wherever she was, there was something that had happened. And He saw her. She couldn't hide herself. See? She had touched God, through that Man. Virtue, strength, had went from Him. He told her about her blood, blood issue, and it had stopped.

L-300 Now, that same Jesus is the same High Priest today. The Bible said so. Is that right, minister brothers? [The ministers say, "Amen."--Ed.] See? That, "He is now a High Priest, setting at the right hand of God, the Father. Setting there, ever living to make intercessions, a High Priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities."

L-301 Now, you don't have a prayer card. You won't be up here in the line. But if you want to know whether it is the truth or not, you just say to God tonight, "Heavenly Father, I'm sick. I must have help. And I--I'm using all the faith I've got. I know it's not that man standing there. That's just a man like I am, or my husband, or my brother. See? But I believe the man told the Truth, because it's Scripture. And I believe that You're a High Priest now. The thing, let me touch You, Lord, and You be the same yesterday. You... That brother doesn't know me. But You turn around and use his lips, and speak to me and say like You did to the woman."

L-302 I challenge you, in Jesus Christ's Name, to have that kind of faith, and watch what takes place. See if it's right or not. It's the truth. You just believe it. And if you can do that, well, God will bless you.

L-303 Now, is there anybody here that never was in one of the meetings before? Raise up your hand. My! Oh! We're glad to have you here tonight. God bless you. Just a little meeting, a time of fellowship. And just run in here, nervously, for two or three nights, and take off. Maybe sometime, God willing, the ministers willing, we could come back here sometime, have a good meeting, where we stay two or three weeks.

L-304 And the sick people, sometime, they'll have a--a growth, like, in them. They don't even know what the growth is. Now, it's a life, like a malignancy, or whatever it is. It's a life. It's a life that doesn't...

L-305 Say, on my hand, there's no cancer there now. Maybe there will be, someday. Usually, a cancer, it comes from... It's a wild cell.

L-306 And like some of you sisters going through the time of menopause, and they give you this hormone shot. Don't you do it. You just trust God. Hormone is a wild cell, and you're just putting cancer right in you. See? I'm not... Doctor, don't think I'm trying to take your place here. But I've done met too much of it in the prayer line. See? So, the thing to do, you just put your faith in God. And your real good, honest physician, your doctor at home, will tell you that's the truth. You just have faith in God and trust Him. He'll take you through the shadows. He's always there to help you. That's right.

L-307 Notice. We find, what if that growth, it starts growing? What is it? It's a multiplication of cells, one cell piling on top of another. 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min

L-308 That's what you are, too, a multiplication of cells. Well, you know where you come from. Holy wedlock between father and mother, one little teeny cell. If I was going to tear your body down, tonight, take it cell by cell, it'd come down to that one little life. Inside of that life, course, there's a chemistry of the blood, and inside the blood is the life, and that life is you. Now, it begin to multiply cells.

L-309 And so, everything of its kind, the bird after bird, dog after dog, human after human. And it make...

L-310 But, you see, a devil has no form. Cancer, it's called cancer, comes the word "crab," which means "legs spread out," go to sucking. It's drawing your blood out of you. It's another life. It's a life living in you. So, there's a human life. And there is another life; and that's what I'm talking to, is that life. Now when they say, now, you call it, doctor calls it, "cancer," and some of them calls it cataract, and some of you calls it different things, medical terms. But, Jesus called it a "devil," and that's what it is. Devil means "tormentor," and it's there to take your life.

L-311 Now, sometimes, the doctor can cut around and get it all out. That's wonderful. But what if it's got such a hold, it can't? Now, we're not dealing with the lump, itself. We're dealing with the life that's in that lump, now, when you say, "Satan, come out."

L-312 And I can prove it to you. Let the person lay their hands on my hand, and prove you, show the--the effects it takes. You've seen it done, many of you. Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-313 Notice now. If that life goes out of there, what happens? You go back the next day, it shrinks. Anything knows, after anything... Anybody knows, when anything dies, it shrinks. You kill a deer, then weigh it and tell the brethren how much it weigh, and throw it on the scales in the morning, it's going to be pounds lighter. When a person dies, that has false teeth, they take them out; artificial eye. Cause, they'll... they, they shrink. They'll come out.

L-314 Well, then, after it lays there so long, like a little animal, dog, being run over on the street, laying in the sun, it begins to swell, then it gets bigger than it was in the first place. The patient then will begin to get sick after about seventy-two hours, when corruption sets in. They'll begin to say, "Oh, I'm worse than I was. I've lost my healing."

L-315 "And when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks in dry places, returns back again." See? And if you don't really believe, no matter how much it's took off of you, if you don't know how to accept it and believe it! When it returns back, you still know it's gone; and if you accept it, then there's nothing but death. But what's the matter? You put a... What if you had a snake in you, about that long? You'd die.

L-316 Well, what is it? Your heart beats and purifies the blood stream. And that's what causes fever, is infection. And then when that growth, laying in the human body, and it's dead, and infection sets in, or it begins to swell, and the heart has to beat that out, purifying the blood. Why, of course, you get worse.

L-317 But people, there, that don't have faith, just run in, and they actually get a relief. I see people...

L-318 One night, a man with cataracts over his eyes, run down and played the piano, and could see. He come up and took this same Bible and read from it. And about four nights later, couldn't even see his hand before him. He come back, said, "I lost my healing." It was just a good thing to be there. He come.

L-319 I said, "Brother, that's wrong. You--you, you've done... You disbelieve." He said, "Well, Brother Branham, I got healed. But..."

L-320 I said, "No, it's the cataract swelling, sir. Just keep on believing. Don't you doubt. If you do, it will come back. You just keep on believing. You said you believed. Then, you're taking back on what you said. Don't say it 'less you believe it." Encouraged him and told him. Stayed there, was there for two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, he could read the Bible as good as anybody else could. See?

L-321 Now, if he hadn't had instructions on what to do, and that's what you get, run in like this. And the first thing you know, then it all falls back on the pastor, and they say, "Well, they wasn't." See, it's because the congregation is not trained. They don't understand how to, what they must do. And they don't have, altogether, faith. They have a lot of hope. 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min

L-322 But, now, what I'm trying to do, is not for you to say, "You know what? Brother Branham laid hands on me, and, brother, I got well." I don't want to even touch you. I want you to touch Him. See? I ain't got nothing to do with it.

L-323 But in the gift that God has give me, if I can manifest Christ, to show Him and bring Him to a reality here before you, the Word Itself made flesh among us, and show that it is God, then you just touch Him and see what happens. You see what I mean, friends?

L-324 You don't want something big. If you do, you can't go to little places. I was on the field, years ago. I've never permitted my meetings to grow to a place. I don't have any televisions. I don't have anything selling. I--I don't have nothing, just Christ. And I... If some... I go to them little bitty places where some of the brothers who has got these great big programs couldn't go to, because they got to have thousands of dollars every day, to keep their program. I don't have to have nothing, just more of God. See? And I can go wherever He sends me. See? And that's where I can go to.

L-325 I preached a revival here not long ago, in a church that held twenty. It was pitiful, but we held it, anyhow, because the Lord told me to go there. See? And then I go and preach to a crowd of five hundred thousand. Somebody sponsors it and takes me over. I don't worry about nothing. I just worry about keeping right, before Him. See? He sends me wherever He wants to send me.

L-326 Now, tonight, as far as I know, in this line, people are strangers to me.

L-327 How many is out there, is strange to me? Raise your... Knows I don't know nothing about you, raise up your hand, you--you need Christ. All right. You just believe now. I think it was a hundred percent.

L-328 Now, while this prayer line is going up here, you begin to pray down there, for God to. And if He will do that, you'll believe, will you? Say "Amen." [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-329 Now, how many knows that that's exactly the way He identified Himself as the Messiah of God? How many knows that, from it? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] See? It's exactly. It's exactly. And He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. "I do nothing until I see, what I see the Father doing."

L-330 I want to take every spirit in here under my control, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for the glory of God.

L-331 Keep your seats. Set still. Don't move around. When you move, see, each one is a spirit. You know that? If you wouldn't, you'd be dead. See? And--and your unbelief... And I say, "Bow your head," do it. I say, if It calls you to get up, get up. And whatever It says do, you do just what It is. Because, It's not me. It's Him. Now start your prayer line, wherever it is.

L-332 Heavenly Father, it won't be long till time is going to run out. Standing behind me here tonight is shepherds, ministers, who has foretold and claimed that the hour would come when this would be done. Some old veterans, many years ago, standing on the corner, with a guitar in their hand, claiming that there would come a day. And here is some of them here tonight, and their sons are here. Father, they only paved the way to make it real. Now may we receive it, Lord. Grant it. And may, together, we fellowship around this great gift that God has sent to us, Jesus Christ. Grant it, Father.

L-333 Now, Lord, Thou knowest that I don't know one of these people. I know nothing of them. Thou knowest them all. And I'm trying to let the people see, Lord, that it isn't great men, great church. It's a great God, and Jesus Christ. I pray that You'll let Him be known tonight to us, humbly.

L-334 Now I've challenged the audience, Lord, to look to You. And let some of them out there, Lord, somebody, I pray that You'll let the Holy Spirit search out some faith there tonight, that'll cause the audience to get enthused, to see that there is something going on. And may they understand, and each and every one be healed. May there not be a sick person in our midst, tonight, when the service is closed. May every unsaved person be saved, when they feel and know that they're in the Presence of the very God that will judge them one Day. We commit it all to You now. And I commit myself to You. Use me, Lord, as You see fit, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.

L-335 Now, I--I ask you to be real quiet and be in prayer. Now, just imagine... Now, if anybody does not think that this 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min comes from God, then, in the Name of Jesus Christ, I challenge you to come here and do the same thing. And then, if you can't, don't say nothing about it. Search it in the Scriptures, you see. See?

L-336 Now, as far as I know, with God's Bible here before me, and this bunch of men setting here, looking at me, and in the presence of this people, this woman is a stranger to me. I don't know her. She's just a woman standing there. I know nothing of her.

L-337 If she is sick, and I--and I had any way to heal her, I'd sure do it. You believe that, don't you? I would do it if I could. But, I can't. Nobody else can.

L-338 Healing comes from God, and He's already done it. But if--if God could do something, to make you understand that He is still here, and He here to keep His promise. If He keeps this promise, then He will keep, He keeps the promise of healing, of course. See?

L-339 And then if--if Jesus was standing here tonight, with this suit that He gave me, and you'd walked up to Him and say, "My, Lord, I'm sick. I want You to heal me."

L-340 I believe it'd be something like this. He'd say, "Child, do you not believe the holy Scriptures? I died for that purpose. I purchased your healing at Calvary, when I suffered for you." "But Who do I know Who You are? Are You my Lord?"

L-341 "Well, what did I do when I was here on earth, before, to make Myself known to the people, to both Jews and Samaritans?"

L-342 Not one time was that miracle performed before a Gentile, 'cause Gentiles wasn't looking for it. Now is the day of the Gentiles, when they're getting theirs now. And this is the day, that He said, "A word against the Holy Ghost, be called an evil spirit, would never be forgiven people."

L-343 Now, the woman, both of us here before God, and under the Bible, we absolutely, you see, we know not one another, never seen each other. And I don't know, have not one idea, what she is standing there for. I've never seen her in my life, and this is the Bible in my hands. And as a minister, what good would it do me to say that, when it was wrong, condemning myself?

L-344 I don't have to be here doing this. I come because I feel I'm in the will of God. I've come because that I know that the Day of Judgment will strike Tucson someday. And God is trying to get a Message to you, and I must be His witness. Nothing to me, I'm the least among you. I'm just your brother. It's Jesus Christ, but He has to have someone to work through. He does that choosing, Himself. He predestinated that to be.

L-345 Now, if the Holy Spirit will tell me what that woman is, or what she has done, or what's, something about her, she knows, she'll know whether it's the truth on not. Won't you? Sure. You'd know whether it's the truth. And if it isn't the truth, then it isn't God. But if it is the truth, then it is God.

L-346 How many of you will believe now with all your heart and accept it? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-347 Now here we are, under oath, under the Bible, before His witnesses, before the witnesses here. And the Bible laying here, that promised that the things that was done just before Sodom burnt will be done before the Gentiles, before the... they're destroyed. The last call to Abraham's seed, the royal seed!

L-348 Now, anyone knows, the woman is standing with her eyes closed, just repeating the Word, of prayer. She is a Christian, because, when she first come up.

L-349 You find, once in a while, an impersonator slip by, and try to act like a Christian. How many has ever seen that done? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] You see what happens to them too. They either drop right there, or paralyze. They pack them out, and that's it. We're not playing church. You remember Phoenix, a few years ago, on that.

L-350 Now, the lady, really, she is burdened about something. Now, if you could see, between she and I, there's a Light. She begins to fade out. But it seems like her spirit is troubled. She has spiritual problems that she's worried about. That is true. If that's true, raise up your hand. 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min

L-351 Variably, every time, I feel that come in, "He's reading that woman's mind." I'm not. I'll find that one of these nights, and I'll call it out, too.

L-352 Just a minute, we'll see if we are, see if we're guessing at this. I don't know what it said, first. There was something. It seemed like it was trouble or something. Oh, here it is. I see now. It's spiritual problem.

L-353 Another thing, you have sick spells. You have gallstone trouble. That's right. That right? Uh-huh. [The sister says, "Comes in stages."--Ed.] Yes, sir. Kind of a strong man. Notice, another thing, you're burdened about somebody. That's some children. It's your children, their salvation. That's true. It's about somebody, too, that's here. I can feel it. It's your husband, and it's his salvation. ["That's right."] That's right. He is setting present now. ["That's right."] Hum!

L-354 You're not from here. I see you walking somewhere where there's high green hills and a lot of water. [The sister says, "Jesus!"--Ed.] It's--it's away from here. It's north from here. You're from the state of Oregon. ["That's right."] That's right. You're from somewhere near Grant's Pass, or somewhere around in there where them hills are. Your first name is Lena. ["That's right."] Your last name is Stovell. ["That's right."] That's right. Jesus Christ honors your request tonight. Go home. Your husband is saved; your children, also; and you receive your healing. Blessed be the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ!

L-355 Whatever it was, I don't know. It'll only have to be on the tape. But I know it was a woman that had faith, that believed.

L-356 You believe Him now? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Is He the same yesterday, today, and forever? ["Amen."] You know that has to be Spirit. Now it depends on what you think It was.

L-357 How you do, lady? [The sister says, "Fine."--Ed.] Now, we're strangers to each other. I--I don't know you. And you're a lot younger than I am. But do you believe Jesus can tell me what your trouble is, or something about you? Would it give you faith to believe? You believe me to be His servant? You know I wouldn't know. It would be impossible for me to know. It'd have to be from Him, Spirit. And you're conscious at this time that there is something going on. It's His Presence.

L-358 You're not exactly standing for yourself. You got a lot of trouble. You got a spiritual, lot of spiritual problems that you're wondering about. [The sister says, "Yes."--Ed.] That you'll... You're going to get the answer to them. And just to let you know that I know what I'm speaking of, some of it is about something going on in your church. ["That's right."] Uh-huh. That's right. That is right. It's a business deal. It's going on in your church, that you don't think is going on right. That's THUS SAITH THE LORD. That is true.

L-359 And another thing, I see a person appearing, that's almost dead. It's a cancer case. You are praying for cancer, someone in your country. And you're also from Oregon, because it's the same country the lady was here before. That's right. You receive what you asked for. [The sister says, "Thank You, Lord."--Ed.] Return home. Your faith grants it to you.

L-360 I never touched the woman. But God did, for her. You just believe.

L-361 How do you do, lady. We are strangers to each other. The Lord Jesus knows us both.

L-362 Now, just a moment. Something happened in the audience. Be real reverent. There was a man appeared, before the woman here, somebody with faith. Just keep praying, ever who it was. I missed it. Just keep praying.

L-363 Again, see, to talk to you. Everybody has a spirit. See? And the people are beginning to believe, you see. And it makes it, see, everybody's faith pulling every way, you see. That's the reason I have to get somebody here just before me.

L-364 There is even ministers setting here, that's sick, that's praying right now. See? And that's... See?

L-365 And I've called you, you with the prayer card. I don't know you, but God does know you. Then if the Lord Jesus will tell me something in your life that you've done, ought to have done, or something that's wrong with you, if you're sick, might be domestic trouble, or might be financial trouble. I don't know what it is. But whatever it is, you'll know whether it's true or not, if He says it. Will--will you believe, and believe that--that you are now in His Presence? Not 63-0605, Greater Than Solomon Is Here, Ramada Inn, Tucson, AZ, 128 min my presence, or these men, present, that wouldn't make you feel the way you're feeling now. It's His Presence.

L-366 There's a man keeps standing by this woman. It's a heavy-set man. It's something. I see it. You are a friend to a man that I know, Paul Cain, a minister. You know him. That's right, 'cause there he is. It's... That's right. He has prayed for you, this man. And your trouble, you have a rupture, and the rupture is in the diaphragm. That is right. And it caused complications and all kinds of sickness. You're not from here. You're from... You're west of here. You're from California. You believe Jesus Christ? [The sister says, "Yes, sir."--Ed.] Will you accept Him? Miss Moss, you want to go back home and be well? Return and believe it. Have faith in God now. Don't doubt, and it will be brought to pass.

L-367 You believing on the Lord Jesus? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-368 How do you do? We are strangers, one to another, suppose. The Lord Jesus knows both of us. I do not know you, but the Lord Jesus does know you.

And you were healed once in the meeting, that was told to you, by being a trouble in your side, or leg, or something like that. And you were healed in the meeting. And a man that's gray-headed, and he got a gray mus-... It's Pastor Mattsson-Boze, that used to be your pastor at the Philadelphia church, that's where you're from, sent you here tonight.

Do you believe the hour has arrived for that, and that that ministry is in operation in the Church today?

You're just a woman laying there. I see you're on a stretcher. Do you believe me to be His servant? If God can reveal to me what your trouble is, will you accept Him as your Healer? You're shadowed for death. There's a dark shadow over you. If you lay there, you'll die. Does do no good to go to the doctor; it's all over, for as far as he is concerned.

L-392 "Is it possible for me to receive the Holy Ghost like they did on the Day of Pentecost?" Certainly, if you believe it. "Believe. Only believe."

L-393 Do you want a real experience of the love of God, like that old mother deer had for the baby? If your experience isn't like that, you're short. Come on. If you want to manifest Jesus Christ in your life, come on. Don't play church no more.

L-394 The hour is here, we mustn't trifle with this great thing that God has given us, the infallible proofs of Jesus Christ alive today after two thousand years away. Won't you come? The church is receiving its last gift. This is the last thing that will come to the Church before the Coming of Christ, according to the Word of God. Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Lot, so shall it be at the Coming of the Son of God." Here we are.

L-395 Come, won't you, every soul that don't know Him, every soul that's in doubt tonight? Don't let this grand opportunity pass you. Won't you come now and stand for prayer while we gather around this place? That's right. Just keep on coming. We, we want to see you, everybody who is... We're waiting just a moment, because I truly feel there's more here should come, no matter what church you're affiliated with. We're not asking you for membership of church. We're asking you to come, receive Christ. Would you like to receive the God that knows the secrets of the heart, that can reveal it right here like He did, that knows the very thoughts you're thinking, and can describe them to you, as He did in the days gone by? Now, the Lord bless.

L-396 Now, while these are around the altar, and while the others are coming, let the ones in the audience stand up just a moment now, while we're going to pray.

L-397 Are you ready? Have you seen something that's real? Has something stirred your heart? Has something become a reality to you, quickly, to know that Jesus Christ is alive tonight?

L-398 Now let us bow our heads, and every man pray in your own way. Remember, there's millions of prayers going up around the world right now. God hears every one of them, because He's infinite. Pray now as you do in your own church. Pray for God to forgive your sins. Pray for Him to fill you with the Holy Ghost. Pray for God to heal you. That's right. The Holy Spirit fall among you like that and give you great victory and liberty.

L-399 Heavenly Father, we bring this audience to You just now. Let the great power that raised up Jesus Christ out of the grave, may it quicken this church just now. May the healing power... May every sick person be delivered from the powers of Satan. May every lost soul be saved, and every saved person filled with the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Grant it, Lord.

L-400 Pray like you never prayed before. Pray like you were dying, like it's your last minute, and God will grant it. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
