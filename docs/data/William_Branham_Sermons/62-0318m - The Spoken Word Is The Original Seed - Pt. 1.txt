--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1-1 Thank you, Brother Neville. You going to have baptismal service between time? Good morning, friends. So happy to be here. And, this morning we're starting a little early. And always sorry to see not enough adequate room to seat the people, and I know it's hard for you to stand. And I have give out this morning that this would be the time that when I wanted to have plenty time. And I think it would be real nice along, as the service goes on, that if some would set down, others stand, and kind of rest one another, and if you want to get outside and walk around just a moment, remember, being a long service that it'll be perfectly all right. Then we can swap around.

L-1-2 And now, they're... We know they're in a building program here at the Tabernacle for a larger and bigger church that can have adequate seating room. And I think the church here will only seat around two-fifty, three hundred people, and there's probably a hundred more than that in here now. So it'll... and I come in and seen the people driving back and forth--couldn't find a place to park around, and--and 'course when they come there at the door and seen the halls jammed up and the walls jammed up, and so forth, with people then all over the platform and so forth, then they--they go away. And we want everyone to hear the message of the Lord as we try to bring it.

L-1-3 Now I want to announce that immediately, I will try to speak up till twelve o'clock, and then after... And I'll dismiss at twelve. And that'll give everyone time to go get something to eat. During this time the minister, the pastor, Brother Neville here, will have a baptismal service during this time. And--and you people that slip out and get something to eat and then we'll return back, and I'll try to be at the pulpit exactly two o'clock, and then go on this afternoon.

L-1-4 And I been in prayer much this week, and I--I would not even get through if I hadn't have cut about a, maybe fourth of it, or maybe a third, away, of what I wish to say to the people. Now, so we thank you for your fine cooperation of coming to meetings and--and what you have done for us and helping us and praying for us.

L-2-1 And I had the privilege a few moments ago of talking to an old man and woman which is, we know them as Brother and Sister Kidd who have been very faithful down through the years. And they stopped a few moments ago. I told them to come by; I wanted to see them a minute; and what a privilege it was to talk to old people that'd been preaching the Gospel when I was yet in a--a baby. And the glorious old Gospel gets better all the time as we near the end of the road.

L-2-2 And now, there's some prayer cloths laying here and I want to pray over them after a bit. And now, let us just bow our heads a moment for a word of prayer.

L-2-3 Our heavenly Father, You said in Your Word: "If I be lifted up from the earth I will draw all men unto Me." And, that is our purpose in life, is to lift up before a dying generation of people, that Jesus Christ is still the Son of God, the Saviour of the world. And I'm so happy to know that I live where there is people who believe that, and along with the thousands that has accepted Him as their Saviour. And knowing that after this life is finished, there will be a life on the other side that'll be so glorious that this toils and few hours that we're passing through these shades and shadows of life here in the testing ground, that we are merely entering into the orbit now, waiting for the countdown, for soon there will come a time that when God's time is fulfilled. The great arm, that's held back the time so long, will finally let go, and His church will move off from this earth in space out yonder into a land where there'll be no sickness, sorrow, old age, death. That's why we are gathered today, Lord, is to express our feeling about these things.

L-2-5 We're so glad to know that this is just not bringing the people together for something in vain; that it has been proven the greatest reality the world has ever known, that the Son of God is not dead, Who made the promises, but is alive among us forevermore. And we're so happy this morning, Lord, above all things, though we own the world and could be young for hundreds of years to enjoy it, but it would only be a season compared with what's the time that's 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min laid up for those who love Him. So we are trying to point our brother and sister to this great hour that's approaching us. And as we see that time coming, Lord, our hearts burn. We want to make ready.

L-3-1 And one by one we go down the lane. We just got through burying one from our midst. Our Sister Bell, going quickly (according to her request), so quick we couldn't get to her to pray with her, but it was her request to go--to see how good that You are to provide all the things that we desire in our hearts. You leave none of them. You promised it. Now, we pray that You'll bring hearts to understand You today--those who do not understand You. Bring sinners to repentance; bring sick people to the healing knowledge of God. O God, bless Your saints and bind their hearts together. And as these tapes goes out to the--the cities and the churches all out through the nations around the world, may ministering brethren who has maybe once misunderstood understand now that Thy church might be prepared.

L-3-3 And now, O Lord, Who separated me from my mother, Who's fed me all the days of my life and has brought me to this hour, by Thy grace, feeling it was Thy will that I should explain to the people why that I have acted and did the way I have done; may it be in such a way that people will have a better understanding, Lord, of the peculiarity of Thy servants. Grant these things, Father, these Scriptures and a text and words that we have written here through the week, praying and studying. May they fall on good ground everywhere they are heard, a ground that can hold them and nourish them, and then all praise shall be given to Thee, for we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-3-5 To the people out in the cars who can't get in, I'm attaching a little instrument here now, and turn on your radio to 1150--1150 and you'll get the message right on your radio in your car. Now, is this... The connection here it's on is it, for the--the tapes?

L-3-6 Now, to all my friends both here and wherever these tapes may travel, I feel that I owe it to the people for an explanation of many things that I have said and done. So many times people has come to me and said, "Our pastor says, 'Why would you do that,' Brother Branham? Why did you say this? And what makes you do it this a-way?" Now, with all my heart, everything that I have done, I have done it with the best intention I know how. And everything that I have said I've said it from my heart. And I've did it for a purpose; and I'll try this morning by God's help to explain from the Bible the purpose and why I have done it.

L-4-1 And now, there perhaps, in a group of people this size, there's probably many ministers setting here, and there'll be many hear this, and I wish we had enough time that I--to put all that I had thought of and Scripturalized--brought the Scriptures too, rather, to--to the people. But to my brethren: even though that you might've disagreed with me... Now, I'm speaking both here and for the tapes--you might've disagreed with me much because of the--my stand towards what I think to be right. And you have a right to disagree with me as you may see it different; but I hope that me, by the help of God this morning, I'll be able to show you the reason why that I have took this stand.

L-4-2 And I have never... there's been many times that I have scolded churches, denominations, the dressing of women, the acting of men. I think I have thoroughly supported that by Scripture. And never one time, God knowing my heart that I have ever had a bad feeling towards anyone. No matter if they disagreed with me as far as the east from the west, I still loved them. And as long as I have the Spirit of God in me I'll always love His church--His people. No matter what they do, or how they treat me, that won't have anything to do with it. I still love them.

L-4-3 I remember one time a man named Moses. Those people constantly (we would call it in our southern expression) aggravated him--just constantly kept him on the move. Everything was a murmur, or complain and so forth. But Moses, when it come to the showdown, when God said, "Separate yourself from them, 'cause I'm going to take you and start a nation," Moses throwed hisself in the path of God's wrath, said, "Take me, and not the people," that he'd called rebels (rebellion against God and against him) yet, he loved them so much till he said, "Take me and save them." That was Christ in Moses. And if a man, no matter how much some other one would disagree with him, if he doesn't feel that way then there's a lacking of Christ I believe--if from his heart, not his lips, but his heart, if he don't feel that way towards humanity...

L-5-2 I was astonished one time (not just merely for a sense of humor at this time), but there was a Chicago meeting, 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min and a colored man was setting there, and he kept saying, "I want to see Doctor Branham." He had a great big hat on and great big crosses, eight or ten inches long and wide, across his chest, and robes and dressed very strange with funny rings and beads and so forth. And I told Brother Baxter, which was my associate, tell him, "Bring him on in the room; I--I will--I'll see him." And he set down to me and he said, "Shall I regard you as 'Father,' or as 'Reverend,' or as 'Elder,' or what would you want me to regard you as?" I said, "If you love me, call me brother." And he, in respects, did so; and gave me his title, which, oh, I'd take a few lines to write across the paper the titles of the name of the church, and his title in the church.

L-5-3 But he said one thing that's always stuck with me. He said, "I'm interested in this, Brother Branham." I'm... told me what he was interested in in his church and these things. He said, "I's interested in one race"; he said, "that's the human race." I said, "There we'll shake hands." The human race to everybody, to every creed, to every color, and to every person that Christ died for, that's my interest this morning. And I've tried to always make it my interest--interest.

L-5-5 Now, I want to read and--and then just... I'm not aiming to preach, because it'd probably be at least--what I've got here to say, will probably take me four or five hours; so after about two hours now then we'll dismiss and go to dinner, then come back at two o'clock, about... Be here before two because I want to start right at two. Be here about one-thirty if you can. Then we'll be out in time for tonight. I have to leave this afternoon yet for Tifton, Georgia, where I'm to hold a service tomorrow night--in a--the high school auditorium there--just a preaching service. And then from there, I don't know: just wherever He leads from there. Many places... Brother Arganbright and them's called from overseas to start right away over there, all across the west, out into Canada, around the world. But I'll... you'll know... believe... I believe you'll know better after I get finished, if God will help me to give it to you the way it was given to me; then after the service, you'll understand, I hope.

L-6-1 And then, if there be any questions that you don't understand, I ask you to bring your books, and--and then you who have tape recorders can get the tapes, and put them in your home, and set down with an open heart--just an open heart. Just lay it out and say, "Lord, I've just relaxed now; I'm going to listen"; and then when you catch something, turn the recorder off and go get the Scripture. And the Bible said, Jesus said, "They are they that testify of Me." See? And let's look through the Scripture and see if it's all right.

L-6-2 Now, I want to open... (Pardon. Right in here. He's showing me the different mikes to use. There's such a bunch of them here this morning, and I don't know which one to start on.) Now, let us turn to the Scriptural... I'm going to start in Genesis, and I wind up tonight in Revelations. I believe the Word. Genesis, beginning with the 1st chapter, I wish to read a portion of the Word. And now, if somebody would want someone to take the... got your pencils and papers and so forth, 'cause I've got many Scriptures. I want to keep reading all the time on these Scriptures. In the beginning God created the heavens and... earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided... light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. And God said, Let there be... firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from--from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmaments heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters he called--called he the Sea: and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, and herbs... and seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herbs and yielded seed after his kind, and the trees yielded fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day.

L-7-1 Now, I want to begin this morning with my text to use this: "The Spoken Word Is the Original Seed." Now, that's what I wish to lay the text on--"The Spoken Word Is the Original Seed." Now, if you'll notice, God said, "Let it bring forth of its--in his kind." Whatever it was it must be brought forth of its kind. Now, this Word of God is eternal. God, being infinite, cannot speak one thing and then later on change it to something else, to a better decision, because every decision of God is perfect. He cannot... Once His Word is once spoken, It can never die. It lives on, on, on, and can never die, because It is God. His Word can no more die than He can die. That's the reason we read in I John... or Saint John, 1st chapter, that "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh." The same Word that was spoken in the beginning with His eternal purpose came on over and was made flesh and dwelt among us: God's Word.

L-8-1 Some years ago I heard that a woman (Now, this may not be authentic.) that licked her tongue in radium while mixing it to put on hands of dials of clocks and watches; it killed the woman. And years later, keeping her skull for an autopsy like, they said you could take instruments, whatever they used, and put against that skull bone, and with a--a rumble you could still hear that radium going on in her skull after she had been dead years. Radium continually goes on.

L-8-2 The Word of God continually goes on. I'm told that if we could pick up an instrument that could catch it, that a man's voice, my voice that I speak today, ten thousand years from now could still be picked up in the air. It's like dropping a pebble in the middle of a pond. And the teeny little waves after they fail to be seen by the eye, continue on till it hits the bank. And the air-wave of our voices continually travels around and around the world; therefore, then our voice, what we say will be our judgment. Our testimony will rise right against us. Our own voices will echo in our own ears at the judgment bar of God when His great instrument catches every voice that's been spoke--every word that's been muttered.

L-8-3 And now, there's only one way to stop that voice that's wrong; that's repent. God alone can stop it. If it doesn't, it goes on and meets up with you in the eternity. Therefore, God being perfect and His Voice eternal, His own Voice will have to catch up with it. Therefore, He must be perfect in every decision. For when He once says something, it has to go all the way and come back to the judgment.

L-8-4 Now, if you'll be real understanding, or try to be, you'll see why I have took always the stand for the Word of God that I have; because all other things must perish; God is eternal, and His Word is eternal. Now, as you study, and I'll try to speak just as lengthily as I can so that you--you'll get the words; and I do that for the tapes also, that you must know that this Bible is God's Word.

L-8-5 Now, we know that we're coming to a judgment, that the Voice of God has going to catch up with us somewhere, because it was given to every mortal to hear. Ministers are responsible of taking it, and if this Voice of God has to catch up with every person, then we've... You've got to hear it either here or at the judgment bar. So if the church has the Voice of God, then you must hear the voice of the church as our Roman Catholic people tell us. And when they, in themselves, are so confused in difference in their doctrine (the Roman, the Greek and their different types), then there cannot be any place to have faith because which one is the church?

L-9-1 Is the Roman church right, or is the Greek church right, or is some of the other churches right? Is the Lutherans right? Baptists right? Methodists right? Presbyterians right? or who is right when there is so much difference in them? One is as far as the east from the west from one another, but to my opinion the Voice of God is the Judge. So the Voice of God, and if it's so perfect, it's got to come from some perfect resource, and if men bring it one way and another way with their difference of denominations, then there's--there's no way to set a faith surely in what they're saying.

L-9-2 I hope that's clear (See?), because... And if one says it's this a-way... One says you must join this church: "This church only has salvation." That's the Catholic version. The Lutheran come around and say they are the way. Here 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min comes along the Methodists with something else, the Baptists with something else, the Pentecost with something else; and there seems to be such a gathering of confusion. But then when you take this written Word to our brethren, many of them says, "Well, them days isn't now." Another one says, "It's just a history." The other one says, "It's a book of poems." The other says, "The church has a right to change it." Then where do we stand? Where is there a resting place for faith? L-9-3 When God, being eternal... I believe if we are to be judged (and always have)... That if we're to be judged by anything, it'll be by the Word of God that's given the commission; then if we're to be judged by that Word, then God would be a unjust God to put such a confusion on earth, and the poor human mind so baffled, it doesn't know what to do; and one will join this one and then join that one. The poor fellow trying to think he's trying to find a right place, he will listen to this denomination, then he will listen to another denomination, and this one seems to be better than that one; he will go and firstthing, he's back to the first one again. He just doesn't know what to do. But if God is going to judge the world by something, it'll be by His Word. I believe that.

L-10-1 And now, my brethren--now when I say that, I'm meaning not only this little group here this morning, but I'm meaning where these tapes will be sent around the world--I wish you would bear with me awhile and think of that, that there's got to be some place come for a judgment. Then some of them says, "The King James Version" or the certain other version, and now they're making a Standard Version or something.

L-10-2 I believe if God be the sovereign God, as He is, the eternal One, He has to see to it; it's up to Him. If I want to go to heaven to His place, it's up to Him to furnish me a place where I'll know what to do--somewhere that you can lay your hand and say, "This is it." Do you agree with that? There's got... It's up to Him. He'd be unjust.

L-10-3 If I said, "Lord, I was a Lutheran," and the other one said, "Well, I was a Catholic," well, there's your two protesting one another. Now, what's the poor man going to do? Or what if the Catholic church is right? Then all Lutherans are lost. Why if the Lutherans are right, all Catholics are lost. See, you've got to have somewhere that faith can take its resting place. And to me--I don't know how you feel about it, but to me the Bible is the infallible Word of God. And I believe that God has watched over His Word that there's not one punctuation out of place.

L-10-5 My daughter back there, Rebekah, was saying, "Daddy, in school we proved that the--that there are millions and millions of years this world is old; then isn't that contradictory to the Bible?" "No, sir," I said, "it isn't." "Well," said, "if the--the different study of rocks and formations and stalactites and stalagmites and so forth prove that dripping of millions of years, and God said He made the heavens and earth in one twenty-four hours, doesn't that misprove... disprove the Bible?" I said, "No." If you'll notice God telling Moses about the Bible, He said, "In the beginning God created the heavens and earth (period)." How long it took, that's none of our business. Then He goes ahead and begins to bring in His time of putting seed in the earth. But in the beginning, might have been hundreds of billions of trillions of years, eons of time, but God created the heavens and the earth, period. That settles that. That's the first one. See, He makes no mistakes. Paul, the great preacher said... told Timothy to "study to prove yourself, rightly dividing the Word of God." Study It open-heartedly, and that's what I try to do.

L-11-2 Now, with my faith in the Word like that, then I cannot take some private interpretation, for the Bible states that the Bible is of no private interpretation. Now, the Spirit just revealed that. I knowed the Scripture, but right now I don't know just exactly where it's in the Scripture; but you who are putting it down, you'll find it; I think it's in Peter that the Bible is of no private interpretation. Therefore, if an inspired writer said... And if that's wrong, then how much other parts of it is wrong? It's either all right or all wrong. You can't make it nothing else. So you... Well, about the church, you say, "Well, then the church..." No, if you go to the church, then which church is right? Which church is right? See you have to come back again to something that faith has to rest on; and to mine, it's on the Word of God, believing that this Bible is God's program for the people: always has been.

L-11-4 Jesus said the Scriptures must be fulfilled. That is, that all that's written in the Scriptures... Now bear this in mind, 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min 'cause you who are getting the tape now; at the end of these tapes you'll find I come back to that again, that all that's in the Scriptures must be fulfilled. Now, let me--let that soak just a minute, class. See? All that's in the Scriptures has got to be fulfilled. Then if God said anything, there you are; It's got to be fulfilled. Or if it isn't, that's not the Word of God. Then if it is--that isn't the Word of God, then where are we at? Let's get something that looks like God or anything we want to do: as the Bible said, "Eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we die." See?

L-11-5 Now, if that is not the Word of God, then we're all lost; and if it is the Word of God, God is absolutely honor-bound. The God of--Who is the fountain of all honor, Who is the beginning of all honor, Who is the source of all honor, Who's the source of all Truth, has got to stand by what He said. And if this isn't God's Word, then who is God? Where is God? or is there a God?

L-12-1 "Oh," you say, "Brother Branham, I feel it." Oh, the--the heathen can tell you the same thing on his idol. Traveling does something to you, when you see it yourself. "So I--I believe I could look and see this." Yes. "I believe if I... I believe because I--I was changed like this, because..." I do that too, but remember heathens do the same thing. Why, the morals of Africa would snow... Some of them tribes would make Americans here that call themselves Christians feel ashamed of themselves, the morals and cleanness amongst the people who worship heathen idols. So maybe that's God. See what I mean? You--you see, when you look at the thing in the face, here's a great big circle here you've got to cover; so you've got to have somewhere to come back and place your hands.

L-12-3 Now, let's take the Lutheran claims. They fail. Let's take the Catholic claims. They fail. Let's take the Baptist claims, Pentecostals. They fail. So you can't put no confidence in them. But there's not one thing written in this Bible but what God has proved by somebody that it's the Truth. See? It's the Truth. As I've often said, "Maybe my faith won't climb where Enoch climbed, but I certainly wouldn't stand in anybody's way that could climb there." Great faith...

L-12-5 Now, getting this background that the reasons why I believe the Bible, and that's where I take my text. Now, next thing I want to say, that I do not believe the Bible contradicts Itself, and I have offered a challenge world around for any persons who claims such to come, prove it to me. Come, prove it. The Bible doesn't contradict Itself; it's you contradicting the Bible. God cannot contradict Himself. If He does, then He isn't God. And if this Word is God then, and It's contradictory, then you make God contradicting Himself; then where is your God then? Kind of gets thick, doesn't it, complicated?

L-13-1 If God contradicts Himself, He's not no more than I am or no more than you are, for He can contradict Himself. The Word's there, but It's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent. That's why someone says that Matthew 28:19, where: "Go ye, teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost"; Acts 2:38 said, "Repent and be baptized in the Name of Jesus."...?... they're contradictory... It isn't a contradictory.

L-13-3 Everybody that's ever baptized has to be baptized in the Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost. And if you're not baptized using the Name of Jesus Christ, you're not baptized in the Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost. You're baptized in some titles that pertains to a Name. If that is--isn't the right revelation, then the Bible would be wrong when It went ahead, and everybody baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ. But if the Bible baptized, every one of the apostles all down through the age baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ after Jesus commissioned them to baptize them in the Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost, then the Bible absolutely contradicts Itself. But if you look at it, it isn't. They did just what He said: Not titles, but name. So there's no contradiction.

L-13-4 How many more could I pull out here that I've even got wrote down, that where people say It contradict Itself. I've asked for twenty-five years (almost thirty now) for someone to show me. It isn't there. No, sir. It's there, the Truth, all the Truth, and nothing but the Truth, and our faith rests right there, right there on what God said. Don't--don't try to interpret It; just say it the way It says it. Don't put any private interpretation, and I believe that there's not anything 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min else...

L-13-5 Now, I hope that if this hurts that it isn't me; I'm trying to say why I believe what I believe and the way I've acted the way I've acted--of the things that I done. I'm trying to show myself to the world, that I have done this because this is my conviction. I believe that any word that's added to this Bible and whoever is guilty of doing it, his part will be taken out of the Book of Life: Revelation 21, "Whosoever shall add to This or take from This..." I do not believe that any creed, any dogma, anything else, but just the literal Word of God is God's plan. Anything else is sinful and will be dealt with and will be eternally lost: any man, any creed, any denomination, or anything that will add to or take from one punctuation of this Word. God, Who is not a God of yesterday Who wrote a book and handed it out in a bunch of men's hands and let it be confused and everything else, then go to judge the world with that Book. But the God that wrote It lives, lives in It, and confirms His Word. (Now, in studying the tapes, I want you to study that real close right there--that remark. See?)

L-14-2 Now, I begin at Genesis, and I'm over to Revelations now bringing this together that this is God's Word. Revelation says that whosoever will take from It or add to It, the same will be taken, his part out of the Book of Life. I get to the Scripture, quote it after while: Revelations the last chapter. That's the 1st chapter shows now, what? What is the Word. Now, It is eternal. It must not be tampered with, added to, or taken away from. See? Must not be tampered with: God sees to that. It must not be added to--anything to It. Nothing can be taken from It because It's eternal. See? Now, now, to base upon to show you that, what I'm trying to say, is in between these (Genesis to Revelation) it will not mix with anything else.

L-14-4 Now, here's where we're going to differing, from here till five o'clock this afternoon. See? Here's where we're going to differ. How many will agree that this is God's Book of judgment, that we'll be judged according to the Word of God? It shall not be added to or taken away from. Then why has this been done? Now, we're getting to it. Why has this been done in such a rude way? Now, we're going to find it between Genesis and Revelation, right down in our time, down through other times.

L-14-5 Now, let me make that real clear for the tape. Now, after I have told you why I believe the Word, and what God said about It, and how It should not be taken or added to, taken from, I want to go into the dense part of it, to the context of this long text that I have drawed out, and explain to you and show you what happened; then you can see the reason I believe what I believe, see?

L-15-1 Now, It cannot be mixed, and It will not hybreed with nothing else. It will not hybreed. Today is a great day of hybreeding animals, corn, wheat, making a better looking product, but it's no good. It's rotten, no life in it: dies, can't reproduce itself. It's dead because everything that we have on earth today in its original form is a spoken Word of God.

L-15-2 That's why that a mule, a bastard-born animal with a crossbreeding cannot breed itself back again. God made a horse and He made a mule--or made a donkey. You breed them two together, you got a mule. It's a hybrid; therefore it can't breed itself back. (We're going to hit the serpent's seed after while now.) It can't breed itself back.

L-15-3 Now, what's my text? "The Spoken Word is the Original Seed." Now, I want to prove that. Let us turn now over to Matthew 24:35 just a moment and--and as we search through these Scriptures for a little while (and I'll see how much time we have), and I want to read here a word that Jesus said. Matthew 24 and the 35th verse--24th chapter, 35th verse--show how eternal this Word is, what we've been talking about. Verily... (34)... Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. Heavens and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away.

L-15-4 Now, could you mix anything with that then? Now, in the Book of Revelations the 22nd chapter and the 19th verse, I'd like to read this, Revelations the 22nd chapter and the 19th verse and see what this says. Let's begin with the 18th verse. For I testify unto every man... (Now, remember from Genesis where He spoke the Word. See?) For I testify to every man... (That's priest, pope, bishop, state presbyter or whatever.)... that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min if any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: What about your dogmas? What about your unscriptural creeds that you're listening to, of all denominations, there's not a one excused. ... if any man shall take away from the words... (saying it's not the same, you know. See?)... away... words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the holy city, and from the things that are written in this book.

L-16-2 Though he be a preacher (see), though he be a church member all of his life, though he be a bishop or a pope, whosoever shall take one word of this--just one word... Do you realize it was one word that Eve doubted that caused all the trouble? One spoken Word of God, Eve doubted to be the Truth, and it caused every sickness, every disease, every suffering baby, caused every hospital to be built, every operation was ever performed, every death that ever died, for one person to believe one--disbelieve one word. There you are.

L-16-3 What did Eve try to do? Hybreed it, mix it with something. You've got to take it the way God spoke it. It won't mix with nothing. No, sir. Jesus one time said, "If you had the faith like a mustard seed..." I'm told that mustard seed won't hybreed. You can't mix it with nothing. You can mix other grains, but you can't mix mustard seed (See?), 'cause it won't hybreed. And if you've got that kind of faith, that's one--taking one Word of God... That's where so many evangelists crack up (We'll get to it later), how they say, "Oh, we believe this," and they'll take that and they believe that one word, and they can make that work, but what about the other one next to it? "Blessed is he that does all his biddings. Amen. (See?) He will have the right to enter into the Tree of Life for without are sorcerers, dogs, and whoremongers," and so forth. Now, I got a mixed class but I got a lot of context here that's just really flat, so I want you sisters to understand (See?); be sure to understand.

L-16-5 Now, that's why we believe it, that It is the Word of God; therefore God's spoken Word is original. And everything that God created (spoke into existence) is original. And you can hybreed some of His creation secondarily. That's the reason Eve could do what she did with her own seed, because she wasn't in the original creation. She's a byproduct of the man, not in the creation of God. God created the whole things, and then He took a part of His creation and made a helpmate. That's the reason you can hybreed a donkey and a horse, but it won't last. It's death. But the original has got life. It comes back again. I hope you can see it now. The original has the life; so that's the reason I think that cults and denominations and organizations die. History proves they're every one dead. They never did rise no more; they never will. They can't breed themselves back. Got nothing to breed with; they're sterile. That's why Eve's children dies.

L-17-2 Now, I'm taking my time, so the tapes, give people time to study. I don't want to be in any hurry. I want to just take my time. I don't know what'll happen from here on, but I--I want this to the people that even though someday God take me from the world, if I don't live to see His coming, the message will still live on. True. Stay with the Word.

L-17-3 Now, remember, every spoken Word of God is the original Seed. God planted everything in the earth by His Word, and as long as you stay with the original seed, it will breed itself right back and--and reproduce itself again. Hybreed it, it dies. And Eve, the woman, was the first hybrid thing there ever was. Now, I hope you don't turn tapes off till we get down and prove that after while (See?), show you just why.

L-17-5 She was a hybreeder, a bride. Notice, through that brought death, through trying to take the Word of God and mix some wisdom with It. See? You're not supposed to do that. Whether you believe it's--got wisdom to explain it, just say, "God said it, and that settles it" And God said so, and that's all there is to it. If you can't explain it, leave it alone, but just say it's so because God said so. See, just say, "God said it."

L-17-6 Now, notice. Now, it will not mix. It must not be tampered with; God will punish the one that does it; and It will not hybreed to nothing else. It's God's Word alone. God don't need your word with His. We're not supposed to speak our own word; we're supposed to preach His Word, God's Word.

L-18-1 Now, therefore, true life can only come or reproduce itself by its original breeding. See, life... Now, keep... Now, 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min study that, now, when you're studying the tapes and study it now. Life--L-I-F-E--can only be reproduced by its original breeding, the way it started at the beginning; then it reproduces itself. See? If it doesn't, it's a hybrid; it runs out. Some of them run out in the first generation (See?) it's gone right then. It'll soon find itself back. It can't bring correct life because it's hybrid.

L-18-2 Genesis 1:11 the Bible said (God said), "Let every seed bring forth of its kind." Now, when God said that, that settles it. It's always settled. "Let every seed bring forth of its kind." To mix it brings a super crop. It's a super crop of what? Listen now. Let's coast. To mix it... (I'm trying to hold; them's such text, I could preach on it. But I'm trying to keep from doing that.) To mix it will bring forth a super crop as it's proven. But what kind of a crop? A crop of falsehood, death. Hybreed your corn; it brings forth a big crop, better crop, better looking; but it's dead. Plant it back, can't reproduce itself again. It's done; it's finished. Like Eve. See? She brought forth a hybrid crop. Look at us today, and you can look around and see that's true. Sure did. It wasn't God's purpose, no, sir. Just have to hold back for something I'm thinking right now. See?

L-18-4 To mix it brings forth a hybrid crop; and a hybrid crop is a dead crop--far as rebreeding. It won't rebreed itself; it can't, 'cause God said so. It has to bring forth of its kind, and you've mixed it. Now, you can see the church right there, where we're going to wind up. It dies there, for it cannot bring forth of its kind. Why? It's mixed. You can't do nothing with it. It's dead; it's finished. All right. That's why each generation has its own revival, a chance at the Word. Oh, the sovereign God at the judgment... John Wesley's group will raise up, and these "starched-washed" Methodists of today will answer for it. Luther will raise up. The Catholics will raise up. And back behind Irenaeus, Martin, Polycarp, and those, and will have to stand the judgment for hybreeding the Word of God to dogmas. This group of Lutherans that followed Lutherans' revival will answer the same thing. The group of Baptists that followed John Smith's revival will do the same thing. Alexander Campbell's will do the same thing. And the Pentecostals will do the same thing. That original revival, when the Holy Ghost fell, called out a people, and God trying to get His Word to it, and they organized it, and set over here, and denominated, and died right there. You say, "But look what they're doing." We'll get to that a little later on today. We're coming right down to all the... I'm just putting the seed in now. Then we're going to show you after while what happened.

L-19-2 Now, that's why each revival has its own revival--each generation has its revival. God raises Him up a man, sets him with His Word, and starts him out for the message for that age. And as soon as that man's taken off the scene somebody else catches it and hybreeds it. It all falls back to a perfect... everything... may... I could stop here for a minute. We ain't in no hurry. See? Go back; that's exactly what it started way in the beginning in Genesis. God set forth His crop of human race, and Eve hybreeded it. See what happened? So there's a judgment for Eve.

L-19-4 Luther set forth--all the rest--Christ set forth. The apostles set forth. The prophets set forth. Didn't Jesus say, "Which one of you hath not your fathers persecuted the prophets that God sent?" Didn't He teach that a King one time sent his servant, and then sent another servant, and sent another servant, and so forth, then finally sent his son. See? Each generation receiving... 'Cause it's repeating right back Adam and Eve again, the first crop in the garden of Eden. Half of them lost--wise virgin, sleeping virgin. Half of them... One kept the Word; other one hybreeded It. Right back and forth just as hard as it can go, right like that, it's been right down through the age. We'll prove it by God's Word and by the history here. That's right: hybreeding.

L-19-6 Hybreeding first started in Eden, started in Genesis. It's the beginning. That's where... And it ends up over here in Revelations at the second coming of Christ. Now, remember. Correctly: that's why each generation has its own revival; it gets a chance at the Word. Then they hybreed it; instead of taking on, they go somewhere else.

L-20-1 My mission, that I believe that God has called me for... I--I have to say some personal things today, because that's what I told you I'd do (See?), and tell the world. My mission, I believe, to the earth is what? Is to forerun the 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min coming Word (See?) the coming Word which is Christ. And Christ in Him has the millennium and has everything right there because He is the Word. See?

L-20-2 All right, Jesus said in John 3:5... Now, if you want to mark that down, John 3:5. We all know it or either I'll turn; maybe somebody on the tapes would might not be able to turn just at that time, and I'll read here in Saint John the 3rd chapter and the 5th verse, and we'll see what Jesus said. We might start off just a little before that, 3rd. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus said unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily,... I say unto you--unto thee, Except a man be borned of water and of... Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

L-20-3 Is that a seed? Every spoken Word of God is a Seed. That's right. I'm going to prove that just in a minute, where Jesus said so. Every spoken Word of God is a Seed. Then except a man be born again, why must he be born again? He's dead in the fashion he's in. He's a hybrid. He's got to be born again. Why? He was born in sin from Eve's sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the world speaking lies. He's a liar to begin with. No matter how smart, educated, whatmore he is, he's a liar; the Bible says he is. How holy his parents was or anything about, he's a liar to begin with. And the only way he can tell Truth is say what Truth is through his own lips. That's the only way Truth can come. Anything contrary to that Word, he's a liar yet. That's pretty flat, but that's what God says. "Let every man's word be a lie and Mine be true." See? Anything that comes from his lips contrary to deny this Word, or put It in some other race, or some other generation, or whatever it is, he's a liar. That's exactly. He's got to be borned again, and then he sees every word. The only way he can be born again is that Life of God in him to produce that: Life.

L-21-1 A seed must have water to grow. Now, you put a seed in the ground and if there's no moisture in the ground, it's dust, and it won't grow in the dust: can't. It's got to have a certain percent of moisture or it won't grow. Is that right? The letter killeth; the Spirit giveth it Life. See? Now, it must have moisture to grow. His Word is a Seed. Now, to prove that, let's turn to Luke the 8th chapter, the 11th verse and see if this is true or not, if--if the Bible says His Word is a Seed. Luke the 11th chapter--or the 8th chapter rather and the 11th verse. And we'll see what God said about it: 8th chapter, 11th verse. Now, He goes ahead and begins to tell. There's much things to say about it. Let's start at the 4th and just read. And when much people were gathered together, and there come unto him out of every city, he spake by... parables: A sower went out to sow his seed--to sow his--sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. And some fell upon... rock; and... soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.L-21-3 Moisture: Baptists, Presbyterians, Lutherans without the water... And when he's first converted, he looks right straight to Christ; he believes. And the first thing you know, that denomination binds him up into a place, and the moisture of the Spirit's gone from him; he becomes denominational, and he's dead. Not only Baptists but Pentecost. Don't believe that, I know many of you don't, but you just wait a little bit. We'll see whether the Bible states it or not--or not.L-21-4 All right, of lack of moisture--last word in the 6th verse, of the 8th chapter... The lack of moisture... And some fell among thorns; and... sprang up with it, and choked it. See, what was that? He goes ahead and tells that some as soon as they get to be... I'm not going to pull one punch today on nothing. Just what I think the Christian Business Men, and the rest of them of these Pentecostal organizations, and these people that's building all these big millions of dollars of things, the riches of the world has choked out the glory and Spirit of God. Dying because it's choked. The world, care of the world, has choked them out.

L-22-2 The women wants to be active, and bob off their hair, and have water head haircuts, wear shorts, and look like the rest of the world. The preacher stands in the pulpit, with--practice their "ahmans" and afraid of the Word of God because of a meal ticket. If they can't ride a Cadillac and--they're not even considered spiritual anymore. That's right. If 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min they can't dress in the best of clothes and do everything else, they're--they're considered: "They are backslid. They're not so-and-so." An old man back there, old Brother Kidd, told me this morning they don't want him no more, because he's old and he stays right with the Word. What's the matter? They lack moisture. All right. And fell on... And others fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit... when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath (an) ear to hear, let him hear. Oh what a parable. How I could like to preach a text on that now, a sermon. When He had said these things... the 8th chapter the 8th verse and 8th chapter. ...others fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit a hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried... (screamed out, something maybe like this when He said, "Bring forth a hundredfold. He that hath an ear let him hear." In other words, if your ear's in tune with God, let him hear. See?) ... his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be? And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom... (The mysteries... See what He's talking about here? Now, watch. What is the mysteries of the kingdom? Watch just a minute.)... mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might see--might not see, and hearing they might not understand... (See, but God's Word comes right on down to the judgment to judge them, 'cause they did see it. It was there.) Now, the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

L-23-1 What is the Seed of Life? the Word of God. Therefore, for Life, you can't come through a creed; you can't come through a denomination; you got to come back to the Word. Now, the seed of Life. All right, His Word is His Seed, and His Spirit is the Water. Now, right back to John 3:14 there, you get it again. You see? See? The Spirit...?... is the Water. Now, look, John 3:14, we understand what it means if you want to read it. ... as Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness,... so must the Son of man be lifted up: See? Now, if Moses lifted up the brass serpent, for the same cause Christ was lifted up, now what is it? Moses lifted up the brass serpent so that the people that was perishing might have water for life. And look, Jesus... (Oh, God.) Jesus is the Word of God. Now, we're going to hammer that down this afternoon (See?), prove that.

L-23-5 Jesus is the Word of God, and He was bursted open, that Life, the Life that's inside the Seed, that this Life, which, is Spirit, Water flowing over--the Spirit over the Seed of God will bring forth the Life of the Seed. And to bring forth something else, there's some other kind of seed there then. Amen. Do you understand? If the Spirit of God comes forth to water the Seed, if it's the Seed it's watering, it'll produce the Life of the Seed. That clear? Produce the Life of the Seed, for that's what It's give for.

L-23-7 I believe the Bible is the--is the Word, the whole Truth, and Jesus is the Word made manifest; He and His Word is One and the same. What was He? Now, look. He was that Seed. (Now, I've got to hold something back in order to get it in here this evening. You see? It's hard.) He was that Seed that Eve should've produced. Do you get it? He was the Seed that Eve was to produce, but she hybrid it by disbelieving God's Word. So He was that Seed, and the only way that Life could be, in the reproduction of Life, Life had to come through that Seed, and that Seed had to die in order to spread out the Life. Can't--can't you see it? That's why the Water was given: to water the Seed.

L-24-3 The Holy Spirit that was in the garden of Eden was to water the Seed. Man wasn't made to die; he's made to live, but hybreeding brought life--of death there, rather. She hybrid. Now, you deny the serpent's seed. Then I'll ask you, "What's these funeral services about?" She's hybrid. Every one of us are hybrid from the original. That's the reason we're constantly dying. But (oh God.) there's a germ of Life come from the real Seed, that God's proved It was His Seed; He rose Him up again. See? That through that Life that's going over the original Seed like was given to Eve over His real church, it's bringing forth Life again through the birth, through the womb of His Bride. See? Oh, it's rich and glorious. I give a little time to study so it'll sink in. He is that Seed. He is that Seed that was produced by the Word of God. "Be it unto me according to Thy word." There's 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min the Seed (See?), taking the Word. See?

L-24-6 Now, Jesus is the Word made manifest. He and the Word is One and the same, and that's why it was so made manifest in Him so perfectly. That's the reason that God manifested Himself so perfectly in Jesus: because He was the Seed Word, the germ Word Itself (the germ that's inside the seed, that's the life in the seed). You get it? See, it was the... He was the germ Word of God. The germ is the Spirit; the germ is the Water. And Jesus had to be broken open there in order for that Seed to let forth It's Life to water other seed that was coming. Do you see? Even He said, "Other sheep I have that's not of even of this fold, I have. They're going to see that; they're going to get that Word and stay right with It. And I'm sending forth the Spirit to water it, and it'll produce just exactly." It'll produce miracles; it will produce the power of God; it'll produce... And it will not deny anything, because it is a kindred seed with the Seed. It can't say, "Mr. Cocklebur, you come live with me." No, no, sir; no, no. It won't do it. No indeedy. It just won't mix. Can't mix death and life. You can't be dead and alive at the same time. Uh-hum, uh-hum.

L-25-1 So you see what I mean? It is the Germ that come from the Seed: He is. He's the Word of God made perfectly manifest. That's the reason that in Him was what? That was the thing that He is correctly, the Son from the first Adam was the Son that was promised through Adam continue on the human race, and Eve hybrid it to the serpent and brought forth a generation of bastard children born to death without Life, and Jesus come and was that Seed. He proved it. Everything that Adam lost, Jesus was. See it? He is the correct... Eve would have finally brought that child forth, but she hybrid it, brought the serpent in, listening for wisdom, understanding, knowledge.

L-25-2 Now, wait till we get into the Bride with that. That's what... That's the reason I believe what I believe. It's got to come back to this Word. That's the reason I say if somebody wants to--to discuss with me, talk to me about this Word, "Come." That's right. I've offered that anytime. If you think that the Name of Jesus Christ isn't the right way to baptize, come, talk to me about it. Uh-huh. If you don't believe there is such a thing as serpent seed, you come see me. Let's just take the Word. If you don't believe that women should have long hair and that's their covering, come talk to me about it with the Word. If you don't believe that the end of the time is at hand and these things that I'm talking about is, come, talk to me about it. See? Come with me. Brother Seed, just come on. That's right.

L-25-3 You can't be a seed and disagree with the Word because the Word is the Seed. And if you are the Word, how can you disagree with It? You'd be disagreeing with yourself. You'd be defeating your own purpose. Like somebody said, "What would you... Why do you ever go out with them people like that?" Well, if I didn't do it, I'd be defeating the very purpose I was sent here for. There's got to be a light. Now, as we go on down, we're going to bring them things in and show just how they set themselves in order, just exactly perfectly with the Word.

L-26-2 Now, yes, sir. He is... That's why God could work through Him. And what did He say when He was here on earth? "I do nothing until the Father shows Me," perfectly. And anything He done always was vindicated by the Scriptures. He said, "Search ye the Scriptures, for They are They that testify of Me, and if I don't do the things that they said they did, then I'm not that original Seed. But if I do do the things, then why don't you believe Me? (That's right.) If you can't even believe Me, the way I stand, then believe the Word that I say, believe the works that I do, because My Seed can only bear forth what I am."

L-26-3 The cocklebur can only be a cocklebur. You could hybreed it with anything else but it's still a cocklebur. That's right. It'll express it. That's the reason that a dual is a hypocrite. That's a hybrid. A man that claims to be a man of God and deny the Word, he's a hypocrite. A mule that claims to be the horse, he's not a horse. He said, "I'm a donkey," and neither one; you're a hypocrite, bastard born, just exactly. That's flat, but that's what it is. He didn't aim to do that. Man done that with his wisdom. That's where he gets. That's where all man's wisdom winds up: to be bastard borned. All right.

L-26-5 Now, that's why Jesus was so perfectly manifested--God was so perfectly manifested in Jesus, because He was the Word of God. He was God's Word. That's the reason He couldn't produce nothing but just exactly God. And if God is in you, what more can you be? Didn't Jesus say of the prophets who the Word of God came to... Who did the Word of God come to? Prophets. Didn't 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min Jesus call them gods? Why? God was manifested in them. What was it? the spoken Word manifested. See? That's it. Said, "How can you deny, say... If you had any wisdom, you'd understand." He said, "I... How can you say you... We called them... God Himself called them gods." And said, "How can you then say you believe them and deny Me when I say I'm a Son of God?" Why didn't they see this then?

L-27-1 Same thing today: "I'm that Seed that was to come (the woman's seed)." "I'll give you a seed," to the serpent. The serpent had already defiled her. He said, "But Thy seed that I'll give you shall bruise his head." It'll take that thing back again. Amen. I wish--I just wish everybody could see that. "I've come to conquer and correct what Eve done." And the only way I can do it is through a woman that believed the Seed where a woman didn't believe the Seed. Woman believe the Word where one didn't believe It... "I'm that overcomer. I'm the One that's come to give Life that through My death to pay the penalty of what she done, through My life will be given to you to flow over you, and you'll be sons of God and daughters of God" (See?), as long as the Seed's in there. You hybreed it and you ain't got nothing but a denominational bastard child, That's all. Anything deny the Word... Excuse me, sisters. I--I want you to... I've just got to say it just the way it says it here. See? And that's--that's the way it is.

L-27-3 All of God's sons must be the same. Yes, sir. To be borned of the Word and Spirit brings us back to the spoken Word again like in John 3. See? To be borned of the Water and the Spirit, what does it do? Then it brings you right back again unto the place of where you should've been at the beginning. See? That's the reason of Christ's death: brings us right back again to where? Sons of God. If Eve would've brought forth that child... She would've finally done it. Did not God tell her, "Multiply and replenish the earth?" But she had to walk over here play the part of a whore.

L-27-5 ...?... You just say, "That's flat, Brother Branham," but wait just a little bit; we'll get into that a little later. See, see? You say, "Can't be." Well, we'll just find out whether the Word says it is or not. See? Then it's right. They're not; it's not hid. If it is, it's hid from those who's lost. See, that's right. See?

L-27-6 Now, now, this brings you right back to the spoken Word. Then we are God's Word made manifest. See? Jesus said the same thing. "He that believeth on Me, the things that--Who I am, what I come for and the purpose I do, to bring a man back to believe the Word of God and take nothing else with it, the works that I do, He will do also." There you are.

L-28-1 Why is it not being done today? It's hybrid, bastard children, mixed up. It don't--it's a mule; it don't know what it believes. A mule don't know who his daddy is, who his mama is. He don't... He's no pedigree; there's nothing to him. He's a illegitimate creature. That's the way any person that claims to believe God and don't believe His Word will take a denominational creed and breed it with the Word. See, you're not of God; you're dead. You can't be dead and alive at the same time. So even the Word of God don't even grow. You're just playing the part of a hypocrite. Let that go for bishop, priest, cardinal or whoever it might be. That's right. It's got to be the Word or you're dead, just a illegitimate child. And God's Word... God part won't grow. You might grow in the same field as we're getting to directly, but you--you're sure not in the fold. It won't grow.

L-28-3 All right. All right, we notice then. See, the spoken Word... Then we are God's Word made manifest. That's how God wants His church: is to manifest Himself. How can He manifest Himself unless His Own Seed is in that person? How can you use your own thoughts and God manifest Himself through you? How can you take your own belief and say, "Well, my pastor teaches... My--my--my creed says that this... days of miracles..." How you going to do that and then be a manifested son of God? How you going to do it? The death of Jesus wasn't nothing to you. "Oh, I accept Him as my Saviour." You don't. You say you do, but you don't. Your works proves what you are. Jesus said the same thing. "If you think I am illegitimately born..." They said, "We're Abraham's son and need nobody to teach us." Said, "If you was Abraham's children, you'd know Me." See? Said, "Which one of you condemns Me of sin (unbelief)? Show Me one thing that God promised of Me that ain't fulfilled. Show Me one thing that the Father promised that I 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min haven't fulfilled. (Sin is unbelief.) Let's see you produce it then." That--that de-horned them. See? Certainly. Said, "Who's accusing Me? Who can condemn Me with sin (unbelief)?" See? "If I don't believe, then why is the Father doing through Me like He's doing--every Word that He promised? Now, let Me see where you got it in yours."

L-29-1 Who is illegitimate born then? They were. Illegitimate children professing to be God's... Jesus said, "You are of your father, the devil, and his works you do." What kind of works did the devil do? try to hybreed the Word of God through Eve. That's exactly the same thing that these big denominations do today. The works of the devil, their father, they do. They're trying to take a creed and breed it with the Word of God. That's what Satan done in the beginning--the father, the devil. God bless you, brethren. Come out of it. Jesus said so. You've got one little scratch of God in you, you ought to look and see that. Hybrid. Oh, my.

L-29-4 The works that Jesus did--if a man has the Seed of God in him with the Spirit of God watering that Seed, the same works that Jesus--was manifested in Jesus, Him being the original Seed of God, His death brings you back to the original Seed of God, and if the same Spirit that was within Him is in you, then the same works will be manifested. You don't believe that? All right, let's turn over to Saint John 14:12. You say, "I'm a believer, Brother Branham. I sure am a believer." All right, I'm going to see if Jesus would call you one, see if the Word of God calls you one... Verily, verily,... (absolutely, absolutely)... I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to the Father.

L-29-6 What is it? Same seed. Can't keep... How can you plant wheat here and wheat here and say, "I'm going to get cucumbers here and wheat here?" You can't do it. The only way you're going to get cucumbers is plant cucumbers. If you hybreed it, then it won't be a cucumber. It'll be a hypocrite. Is that right? It'll be a hypocrite, friends. This... You've got to say it. It isn't neither one. Isn't cucumber or what you bred it with. It's a crossbreed, and it is a bad product, and it's dead in itself, and it can't breed itself back no more. It's dead right there--back, won't go no farther. That finishes it; that's all. But if you want a cucumber, start with a cucumber. If you want a church, start with the Word of God. If you want a Life of God, start with the Word of God. Accept the Word of God in Its fullness, every measure of It. And then that's... And if that is the fullness of God in you, then the rain that's falling will produce exactly what's in your garden. See? Then now, where's your Latter Rain coming up at? You see where that's going after while, don't you? Going over with them wild gourds that Elijah got and thought they were gourds or that--them school of prophets up there, that denomination they had: gathered some wild gourds and thought they were--they were peas. Oh, well.

L-30-1 Then the works will be manifested in Him are the same, for it is the same Seed Word of God. God's Son was His example Seed. And what His Life was when the Spirit poured upon Him after His baptism and the Holy Ghost come upon Him, the very Life that He produced will--that same watering Spirit of the Holy Ghost will bring forth the same kind of a Life, doing the same thing that He did; if it's the same Seed. Son of God Seed will bring forth a Son of God Seed. Now, shame on you women with bobbed hair. Shame on you preachers denying that Truth. Say, "It's all right; hair has nothing to do with it." But God said it did.

L-30-2 See where it's at? See? That's why I believe the Word. It's a Seed. And if the rain falls upon the Seed, it'll bring forth of its kind. Now, what's the matter with these revivals? What do we do? Make a million more in '44: Baptists, Presbyterians, and whatevermore, Pentecostals. But where is that manifestation of the works of Jesus Christ. "I do nothing till first the Father shows Me." Where is that kind of a Seed coming from? The Holy Spirit will water and bring forth that Seed. It's the Water to the Seed. If the Seed's been planted, that's exactly what the Water's for. If the Water falls on you, you say, "Bless God, let me tell you something, preacher. I'm So-and-so, and I don't believe in that stuff." You're the denominational. You're just an old hypocrite to start with. That's what kind of seed was planted. 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min

L-30-4 Don't--don't--don't--don't misunderstand me. I love you, honey. I'm trying to get this to you. See? I--I will... I'll--I'll stop at it when I finish today. I'll let it go, but I want you to know one time what's right and the reason I believe what I believe. I believe the devil's deceived you. Frankly, I know he has. According to God's Word, It can't fail. He's deceived you. Yes, sir. That's why I preach those things the way I do: because God's Word said it. "Oh," say, "Well, Brother Branham, this is a different day." It's the same Word though. They got some wheat out of the garner from back there that was in the time of Joseph's and put it and planted it here a couple years ago (Did you see that in the magazine?), and it produced a crop of wheat. It was still wheat; that's the reason. The only thing it needed was just some water.

L-31-2 God's Word's just the same as It was when He spoke It back yonder thousands of years ago. The only thing it needs is water. Why don't we get a crop? Because we got the wrong kind of seed in. "How many you all would like to change your letter?" Twofold child more of hell than you was when you started. "How many of you Methodists would like to become Baptists? You Baptists like to come Pentecostals? Just bring your membership over here." Oh, for goodness sake. Tommyrot, trash, trash of the Devil, there's no Life in it at all. It's hybrid, hypocritical, dead, twice dead, plucked up by the roots. Didn't Jesus say, "Every plant that My heavenly Father hasn't planted will be rooted up?" Denomination or whatever it is, it'll be rooted up. God's Word alone will stand. Right. That's what He said. "Every man's word is a lie, but Mine's the Truth."

L-31-4 Then where are we going to go? You better come back to the--your senses. But you can't hear it unless you're predestinated to hear it. We're getting into that. No wonder it falls like water on a duck's back. He's made to shed the water, not absorb it. The ark was made out of gopher wood and shittim wood. It's the most--it's nothing but just hollow; nothing in it but hollow. Everything's taken out of it. It's growed that way, the lightest wood there is, lighter than balsam. Why did they do it? So he could soak it with pitch. If it been oak... You say, "Wouldn't oak do just as good?" No, sir, it won't soak up nothing; it turns it away. It's repellent, and this is an absorbent. And a real Seed of God is an absorbent for the Spirit. All denominationalism's took out; all unbelief is out. And when the Holy Spirit comes into that germ of Life that's laying there, It produces another Seed, just exactly. Another son of God is born (Amen.), another amateur god, son of God.

L-32-1 I'm a Branham because I was borned of Charlie and Ella Branham. That makes me a Branham because I'm their seed. Their two agreements with their sperm together made a seed, and that made me. When God and His Word becomes one (Hallelujah.) that's when God's Spirit waters the Seed of God, the Word of God, It produces God; and it's not the individual; it's God. For what? you are dead; you're not yourself no more. You reckon yourself dead, hollowed out, waiting for the Seed germ. Then what is it? It isn't you no more; isn't the man; it's God in the man. It's a Seed germ like the beginning spoken Word. God's Word made manifest in the man; then it isn't the man; it's the man that's died. He can't be a hybrid and a son at the same time. He's either a son of death or a son of Life. So if he's a son of death, give it over to the devil and let him kill it. Give over to God a minute and let Him kill the devil that's in you--run him out: hollows you out. Then let God plant His Own Life in you, then it's not you no more; it's God's Life, because it's God's Word, watered by the Holy Spirit will produce the same thing. You see it? I'd just love to preach on that a few minutes, but with thirty or forty pages of Scripture here... And I've only got three so far.

L-32-3 All right. Manifested, the works manifested the same by--same by us, for It is the same Word. Now, if you want to do the works of Christ, do the same thing He done. "He that believeth on Me shall have My works." What is that? Believeth what? That He is the Original Seed germ that come. Where is the seed? Here, let me take these handkerchiefs. Here is the man that was supposed to be, right here. This is the man that was supposed to be. What happened? Eve hybrided it--breed it. What it did... Then what did it do? Turned to death, keep dying, dying. Now, this one come that out... Now, here stays the Word just the same. Here's the Word laying here just the same. Now, what happened? Here's the Word. Now, the Word that God spoke to multiply and replenish the earth, It couldn't find a place to land. Finally this Word caught into the womb of a virgin. (We'll speak of the two wombs this afternoon 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min more...?...) And what happened? From Him came forth the germ Life, the thing that gives, the Water that gives the--the--the kernel its chance to reproduce itself. The Spirit came out of Him and went up.

L-33-1 Here we are. We come along. What happened? We believe It; we believe It. Now, what did Jesus say? "He that believeth on Me (See?)... He that believeth on Me, the works that I do--the manifestation that the Holy Spirit come in the form of a dove come upon Me and done this (not through hybreeding, but through virgin born...)" Not the re--the--the course of--of life, like breeding a child, husband to wife; no, not that, not a hybreed, but a virgin born. "Now, through this, I'm giving this Life that if you by faith will accept what Father, all the prophets, all the Word of God, I will pour this Life down upon you, and you'll--can't do nothing else but produce the same thing that I am." There you are.

L-33-2 "The works that I do shall he do also." And what did He do? Just as the Father led Him, what He saw. Saint John 5:19, just... "I do nothing till the Father shows Me." What was He--made Himself a man. God was made flesh and dwelled among us. The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. God's spoken Word, through a virgin, brought forth a body, and in that body come the--the Water, the Spirit, and washed by the water of the Word and then went in Him, dwelt in Him, and there come the Life of God manifesting Himself through Christ. God was in Christ, the anointed One.

L-33-3 "Christ" means "the anointed One," a Man that was anointed. And God dwelling in Him, what was it? The germ with the flesh, the anointed One, flesh being anointed with the Spirit of God produced the Word of God made manifest. "And we beheld Him, the only begotten of the Father, full of grace..." See? There He was. See? He was God's Word made manifest. And now He died in order to pay the debt of your hybreeding (my, my, there it is, what is it?), that you could die to yourself until you're no more yourself and be filled with His Word, believing His Word, and then the Holy Spirit that was in Him comes down to water that Word to make It grow. See? And then what is it? God manifesting, continuing the work of His first Son, His Only Begotten (See?), that died for our hybreeding life, that He might reconcile us back to be sons and daughters of God, that through the church, might flow the same Life by the Word, continuing the Word being manifested as It was in Christ. Christ was God's Word made manifest. And He died, gave His Life, that He might send the Spirit: take His body up and send the Spirit back to water, pay the redeeming price, if we'll believe it. That's it right there--if you believe it. "He that believeth on Me, the works that I do..." Then come the Holy Spirit upon the same Word of God...

L-34-1 "Now," you say, "where--where'd He throw it upon the Bible then?" The Bible's got to be in you. The Word is a Seed, and as long as It's laying here it won't do nothing. But when It comes in here, when It comes in the heart, then It begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit, the works of God. Then visions come, power comes, humility comes. All of your know-it-all is gone. You become nothing; Christ becomes alive. You die; He lives. There it is. 'Cause He died, I live. When I die, He--He lives again. And when I die, He promised me Life. And I died out to myself, so in order I can have His Life; and how do I do it? By taking His Word, His Seed, put His Seed in here by faith and believe it, and then it produces exactly what the Bible said.

L-34-2 Now, my brethren, search out across the country. We find a lot of imitations. Let's go on just a little while longer. See? All right, the works is same manifested in His church that would be, that was manifested in Christ. He said so: Saint John 14:12 "Heavens and earth will pass away but My Word shall not." Is that right? All right, predestinated as He was, makes the Word Seed flesh... I better stop there now. Maybe you wouldn't but somebody out in the tape-land might under--might not understand.

L-34-4 Predestinated: all sons and daughters of God are predestinated. We'll get to the Scriptures after while; I'm just quote it to you: Ephesians the 1st chapter, 5th verse. All right, we are predestinated. Why? Christ is the original Seed, and this original Seed was predestinated by the foreknowledge of God, knowing that the fall would come, and predestinated Him to take our place. You get it? All sons and daughters of God are predestinated. But you say then, "Would He condemn...?..." No, sir. You're here on free moral agent, but the reason that He know... He being God, the infinite One (as I spoke to you about), He foreknew everything that would be. He knowed who they was. 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min

L-35-1 Now, He didn't make Eve do that. He didn't make her do it, but He knowed she would do it. Now, no wonder I believe in the 12th chapter of Saint Luke (I believe it is), He said... (Now, don't put that down; I'll get--I've got it wrote down a little later.) that He said, "They got eyes but they don't see. They got ears but they don't hear. Isaiah well spoke of you. Isaiah foresaw you." And there they are setting there with eyes, ears, and everything else, but yet they can't see. Why? They are a repellent to the Word of God. Then Jesus said, "Oh, you hypocrites. You're the... You--you are the children of the devil and his works you do. Then condemn Me," He said, "refuse My ministry..." When show me where your ministry's producing the full Word of God, as His was. See, see?

L-35-3 Now, predestinated as He was--now you say, "How does that predestination come?" God's formal... Now, does--everybody don't understand this, I want you to raise your hand now when I get finished. See?

L-35-4 God, in the beginning, commissioned Adam and Eve to multiply and replenish the earth. That's how sex was given; that's why it was. But what caused the hybreeding? Bring death. Now, we'll get that this afternoon in the two wombs. See? Now, notice. Now, in this God foresaw and predestinated a world of sons and daughters. He predestinated them to be there. And because of hybreeding, disbelieving God's Word, caused a hybreeding, God's put it right back again that you don't have to be hybrid anymore; you can come right back to the original Word and be a son of God just like you was supposed to be at the beginning. See?

L-35-6 Christ couldn't help being what He was. He was the Son of God. That's it. See what I mean now? See if you were intended, you see the Word of God, you believe It; because why? There's something new. See? Why? Have you ever heard of strain in a family? A one... A--a--a son will kind of impersonate his father, or--or the mother, and--or the grandfather, or the grandmother. That's strain in the family. You've heard of it, haven't you? Well, that's the same thing from predestination. You were supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning, but being that you come the way you did, you're subject to the fall. But being that you're predestinated you hear the Word and It brings you right back where you were predestinated. Amen. Never saw that before. Brings you right... And what--what makes you believe the Word of God and turn down these other things? Is because you were... There's something in you. Way back yonder you was supposed... you... what... You are made to live here forever.

L-36-1 "All right, Scripture for that, preacher." Here it comes: "All that He foreknew, He's called, all that He has called, He has justified, and all that He has justified, He has already glorified." "What's the use of preaching, Brother Branham?" There is a--there's a crop out there; only thing I'm doing is seining. I'm just throwing it out there and see where it goes. If the repellents, the grease of the muck of the world, denominations throw it off, I can't help it; but if there's one out there that can absorb it, he will turn to be a son and daughter of God just as sure as the world (Amen.), 'cause it's predestinated.

L-36-3 That's the reason that God could work His works through Jesus; He was a predestinated Son. He was the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world. Before a hundred billion, trillion, million years ago that we said Genesis 1:1 spoke of awhile ago, He was right then predestinated to take His place. Amen. That's the reason the--the will of the Father He did. He was the Word made manifest. And every one of the other sons will have the same manifestation, and that's the ones that was predestinated.

L-36-4 That little group in every generation will come up in the resurrection all the way from the beginning of the world. And the reason they hold on to it... Even Paul spoke of it in Revelations, or in--in Hebrews the 11th chapter, said they wander about in sheepskins and goat skins, and was destitute, and afflicted, and tormented; of whom this world is not worthy of." Amen. Had nothing to eat, and run about, and dug out, and persecuted, and sawed asunder like Isaiah was and many of the others... Paul's speaking of them men. Who was, he said, spoke of, sawed asunder? Isaiah the prophet, predestinated even before the world begin, he should've come through the womb of Eve. But then he come through the womb of--womb of a woman; his spirit had to come here to be a witness. So Jesus was also came for a witness of the death, burial, and resurrection that men will die, but live again through 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min Him. For He's the Seed that has to come up. Amen. Hope you see it.

L-37-2 All right. Predestinated as He was, makes the Word Seed flesh in you, His church. God's Word... You say, "Sure, Brother Branham, every Word, I believe It." Then don't back up when you get your tradition. See? Stay right with that Word, and stay with that; watch what happens. Say, "Oh, Lord, I believe It. Send the Holy Spirit." Then watch. Then if He goes to bearing record, then you know you got It, not by some sensation; the devils do that; not by some miracles, the devils do that; but by your constant belief in the Word of God and the life that you live, never denying nothing. All right, that makes the Word becoming flesh (See?), flesh and the same water, Spirit.

L-37-3 Now, wait a minute. I can't pass this by. See, Jesus was the Seed of Abraham (fleshly speaking... Is that right?), a predestinated Seed of Abraham. And when the Spirit fell on Him, what kind of a Life did He bring? He brought a faith life. What kind of a life? "You mean He was going to be a sojourner like Abraham?" That's where people get so mixed up today. They try to think that a man of God has to do this, and follow this, and do that. Oh mercy, no. What was--how was Christ the Seed of Abraham? Not in His, so much in His body, 'cause Isaac, that seed of Isaac, finally fell and died. It backslid and hybrid too. We'll get to it directly. See? But the faith seed of Abraham that he believed God's Word regardless of what the circumstances was... There you are. Whew. You know, I feel like shouting. Look. See, look, the faith seed of Abraham... What was it? Not Abraham's body, but Abraham's faith. Abraham's faith in what? The Word of God. No matter what come, he called anything contrary to It as though it wasn't even there. Oh, me, wouldn't that rip these denominations to pieces? Umph, umph, umph, umph. It sure would.

L-38-1 If the truth of even marriage and divorce was only brought out in its Light that it's in here in the Bible, it'd break up every church in this city, any other city: try to get back to it. They're both sides wrong. I can prove it by the Word. They're both wrong. All right. Whether a man should do this or do that, or a woman this or that, I'm not going to say it, because I got enough confusion now amongst them. See? Jesus said, "Let them alone. The blind leads the blind, why..." They'd just fuss about it; they wouldn't believe it. If they was borned to Eternal Life, they'll believe the Word. See? That's right. If they don't, God will manifest Himself to them. If they don't believe it, why, they won't believe it; that's all.

L-38-2 Let's get to this first. We might get to that later sometime, but let's take care of this first and see why we must believe these things, how we got to believe them. You must believe them. If you don't, you're lost; you are. "Believe what, Brother Branham? You?" No, sir, not me. You believe me and... I'm saying the Word. I'm not putting anything here. I'm just telling you what the Bible says about believing this Word. And that's what I've done is try to believe that Word just the way It's wrote. I don't add anything, take anything; I just read It just the way It is and believe It just like that. And by the grace and help of Almighty God, He's confirmed It, and I ask anybody to disprove It. Now, you on the tapes, come do it. Tell me one time I ever told you anything wrong... it didn't come to pass. Tell me anything anytime that God never confirmed and worked it just exactly according to the way it was said.

L-38-4 All right. Predestinated as he was, makes the Word Seed the same water on what? This church today is a Bride predestinated? Did God say He would have a Bride without spot or wrinkle? Then it's predestinated, isn't it? See? Well, Christ was predestinated. He was a Royal Seed of Abraham, and what did it do? When the Spirit come on Christ, He bore record of the Word of God, and when the--when the Water, Spirit, falls on the Word Seed, the Royal Seed of Abraham's faith in God's Word will produce the same kind of a crop. Say, "I don't believe that." All right, let's find out. Let's go now and see; if are we Abraham's seed? Genesis 17. Go back in Genesis and get the 17th chapter. I'm leaving a lot of these off here, but I--I've got to hit some of them in here, 'cause some critic might come along and say, "I don't believe that," so we'll just place a little bit in there so He can stop him from saying it. See? All right, 17:7. Let's start at the 6th verse. And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful... (Abraham's seed)... and I will make many nations... (Gentiles and all)... and kings shall come out of thee. And I will establish my covenant... (Now watch.)... between me and thee and Thy seed after thee in their generations 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min for an everlasting covenant, to be with--to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

L-39-2 What is the seed of Abraham now? Not his flesh. Paul said Jew--that Jew outward is not Jew; Jew inwardly. See? What is the seed of Abraham? Those that believe the whole Word of God regardless of what denomination or papa or mama or anybody else says; they believe the whole Word of God. God said, "I'll establish my covenant right now (predestinate) this covenant with thee and with the seed in each generation after thee that will believe it." There you are--seed of Abraham. Now, you say... Now watch, God said, "I will establish it with the seed."

L-39-3 "Well," you say, "Brother Branham, that gives everybody..." Wait now just a minute. Let's go to Ephesians now, over to the book of Ephesians, and we're going to start at the 1st chapter of Ephesians. And then we'll read a little bit here and just see what God has to say about this--this subject. Now, listen. Paul--now, watch the way he address this now. Everybody on your--on your feet now. We just got--now on your lookout. We got just a few minutes now and then we'll... about forty-five minutes, something, then we'll dismiss for lunch. Now, look. Paul, an apostle... (What is "apostle?" "One sent.")... Paul, a sent one of Jesus Christ... (Is that right? "By the will of the Sanhedrin?" I misread that, didn't I? "By the will of--of the Luther... or--or the a..." Well, anyhow...) Paul, a sent one of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints... (Who is it? To everybody? No, sir. Everybody can't take it. That's right.)... to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:

L-40-1 Them that's already in there, that's what I hope I'm talking to in this congregation this morning: those that are already in Christ Jesus. Now, that's where this is advan... See, you can't tell the--those--those babies out there about it. They can't eat meat; they have to drink milk. They're stunted. See? So remember, they can't eat strong meat. Now... ... to the faithful in Christ Jesus: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. (All right.) Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us... (Now, he's talking to the church now. This is not the outside; this is church)... with all spiritual... (spiritual)... blessings in heavenly places... (like this morning, those who love it is just eating it up. See?)... heavenly places in Christ:

L-40-1 According as he hath chosen us... Did we choose Him? Huh? "Oh, Brother Branham, I--I beg your pardon, I did." No, you... According to the Word, you didn't. Jesus said, "You never chose Me; I chose you." Oh, yeah. When did He choose it? When did Jesus say He chose His church? Before the foundation of the world. According as he hath chosen us in him... (at the last revival that doctor So-and-so had? No, no. You might read that in the creed, a text book, but not in this One. See?)... According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world,... (When were we chosen? At the last revival? The night we got saved? Why, when--when there wasn't no world, wasn't no stars, there was no atoms, no molecules, that's when we were chosen. Amen. Oh, don't let me start preaching on that now. I'm just trying to explain something here. All right.)... before the foundation of the world, that we should be... (What? Members. "No, we should... Oh, after we are saved we just do as you want to." Hmm.)... we should be holy and without blame before him in... (Membership? Oh, no. It's love ain't it? That's right. All right.)... in love... (Excuse me, I'm just cutting up I guess now. I shouldn't do it, All right.)... in love. Having... (What? P-r-e-d-e-s-t-i-n-a-t-e-d... Oh,)... predestinated us unto the adoption of children... (the seed from the beginning... See?)... of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,L-41-1 Who did it? God. When did He do it? Before the foundation of the world. Then if we come in a illegitimate birth through Eve's corruption, making us all her children andsubject to death, then the sovereign God has to make a way to redeem His children, "And all the Father hath given Me will come to Me. And no man can come unless My Father draws him." Oh, my. Now, where's your great big thing you done? You never done nothing. You ought to be ashamed. God, Who done all things... The wheel's a working just right. Someone come the other day, said somebody had said something bad about me and--and accused me of something that was wrong. And I said, "Oh forget it." Said, "How can you take it like that? That involves your family. That..." 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min I said, "Oh, my." I said, "That was predestinated before the foundation of the world to give me a trial. I said, "Why, my, my, my. Sure, so that's all right." Said, "How do you do it?" I said, "If I looked right down this way, I'd be falling all the time."

L-41-5 That's the way with the people today. "If I accept the Truth of God's Word, Brother Branham, they'd kick me out." Why, what are you looking here for? Look out here at the end of the road. See, a man who looks like this, he don't know where he's going. He's looking this way. But if you look out yonder, you don't care what's going on now; you know where you're going. See? That's it. Look where you're going. Stay lined up with the Word.

L-42-1 All right. Predestinated us now unto the adoption... Now, do you believe we were predestinated? Now, was Jesus predestinated? He was the Lamb of God already slain before there was a light, before there was a meteor, before there was a molecule, atom, anything. He was the Son of God slain. Oh, the greatness of God. Then these little peanut brains out of some little manufactured supernatural incubator over here tries to debate that and say it's not right. That's a shame. Who are you? Even some of them saying there is no hell, and you're setting on a pot of it everyday: eight thousand miles thick just below you, volcanic, and then look up and defy God and His Word. When you defy the Word, you defy God. Sure. Oh, my, how great Thou art, Lord. How thankful we should be.

L-42-3 All right. So believers of the Word and Spirit must be One. You get it? Believers, the Word, and the Spirit are absolutely One. You don't do your own thinking; you don't use your own mind. Isn't that wonderful? The mind that's in Christ is in you. See? The mind's in Christ in you will take the Word just like He did, 'cause He was the Word. And the mind of Christ in you, you are the Word. You're God's living Word, representatives of Him here on earth (That's right.), continuing the work. The church should be that way. And when so, the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of the disciples, just like the disciples. The Bible is living again in you.

L-42-5 Now, let's see. I've got to try to get at least about fifteen pages here right quick, and I just hate to do that, but I'm just going to have to run over it, 'cause if I don't, then I'll be this afternoon and I got a meeting tomorrow. And--and I just got to hurry now. All right, now we'll try to make it just a little quicker if we can; snap into it. Are you believing?

L-42-6 All right. And when so, the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of Christ. See? 'Cause you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was; and when the rain falls on the seed, the life produces itself. When the Holy Spirit falls... When It fell on those seed that Jesus said He chose them when? Before the foundation of the world. Then they were a predestinated seed. Is that right? Then here they haul themselves up in the upper room, these seeds, the Word, and the Word was laying on there without Life in it. All of a sudden there came a sound from heaven as the waters begin to gush down. And it actually filled all the house where they were setting. And the seeds begin to grow. It begin to manifest itself, the Word of God being manifested.

L-43-1 All right. Why then has the revival fires let up? Now, I got about ten Scriptures here (if you could just notice it on here) that I ought to say it, but I've got to skip over a lot of it. I'm just... so you get the outline of it. All right, why then has the revival fires let up? Now, I am, got to call names. I won't do it after this, 'less God tells me to. But I've got to call names. I've got to say things that I don't want to say, but in order to make this clear... You can see now where I'm getting to, the reason I've done what I have done. I believe this is the Word. And I believe that Christ has a church, and the church is the field (We'll get to it after while.), and you've got to get the Word in the field before the Spirit can ever do anything. See?

L-43-3 Why then has the revival fires let up? You don't hear very much more of Billy Graham, like great evangelists. Oral Roberts is not burning the country like he used to. My meetings is not even heard of. There's just three. What's the matter? Now, we're going to get some real deep teaching. I'm going to have to just use it now, and if this tape should fall in the hands of Billy Graham, Oral Roberts, I want you to know, my brethren, that I'm not disregarding you; I'm taking myself, if you notice, in there as your fellow brother in the Gospel. And I think after this you'll have a better 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min understanding, brethren, of why I have did what I've done. And I hope that I find grace in the sight of God and before you, in being honest and truthful to tell you the reason why.

L-43-4 Now, Billy Graham... The world was a-burning here not long ago with Billy Graham. You very seldom here of it now. He's still going, but what's the matter? Oral Roberts, why, just burning the earth up: dying down. Tommy Osborn, all of them are good godly men. What's a-happened? Believing that God called me for a ministry, what's happened to mine? Now, here's going to answer some questions. What's happened? You say, "Brother Branham, yours is deadest of all of them." That--that's true. That is right. Billy Graham's more heard of than I am, and Billy's more heard of than Oral. Oral's more heard of in one day than I am in six months. Tommy Osborn, Tommy Hicks, any of those godly men, they're more heard of. So as far as that turns, mine's farther away than all of them. What's happened? "Brother Branham, you saying that--that you was telling us here now that you actually believe the Word and everything, well what's happened to you then? What taken place?" That's what we want to know. That's what we want to know.

L-44-1 Now, put her down in your mind now. Pull down the umbrella, and shake the rain off, and open up your heart just a minute, and listen. Remember the Bible said in Genesis the first chapter we read to base our thought for the day, is every seed after its kind. It'll have to bring forth after its kind. That's right. Every seed will have to bring... Remember, the earth is full of seeds and that the rain makes it bring forth after its kind. I believe it is near the harvest time. Don't you believe it? You all agree with that. We are near the harvest time. Now, the seeds has been planted. That's what's the matter with us. The seeds has been planted. Oh, God, I wish you could see what passed before me then. The seeds has been planted. Remember, there's a planting time; then a harvest time. They know they said so.

L-44-3 All right. Now, there has been three different kinds of seeds planted: A denominational: Billy Graham; he was a head planter. Oral Roberts for the Pentecostal... Pentecostal seed's been planted. (I'm talking about organization now.) And then the Word's been planted. Now, you'll have to understand, folks. I ain't saying this no more 'less God tells me. I want you to get this good and clear. Three seeds has been planted. That's the reason the planting's just about over (See?), all over. Seeds must be planted before the rain falls (That right?) or otherwise the Spirit. Now, you're going to disagree there, but hold on just a minute. See? Seeds must be planted and then the rain falls to water the seed. Is that right? Now, I want... Is there anybody in here that understands Hebrew, knows Hebrew words? All right, you look it up if you want to.

L-45-1 Now, we're hearing so much, and so many organizations and everything else talk about we're in the latter rain. Nonsense. No such a thing. Now, oh, I--I... Something's happening. I can just see it passing before me. It's done caught the Spirit. See? Amen. I know this is Truth; it's THUS SAITH THE LORD. By vision (See?), just moving and coming... Can't hardly get--look down here. Every time I look; I see it just moving up in front of me like that and breaking off, and move this way, and look this way. I've been trying to watch some fellows setting around down here. Look away and everywhere I look, it's like there it is. See? All right, let's go back and try it again now, be sure I got it in there. I don't know what's exactly happened along that line. Look.

L-45-3 I believe that it is near the harvest time. The seeds have been planted. Denominational seed of the churches such as the Evangelicals, like Baptist, and Presbyterian, Lutheran. And the Pentecostal seeds has been planted into the Pentecostal organization, by great men like Oral Roberts, Tommy Hicks, and Tommy Osborn, great men of God. See? And I believe that the Word of God has been planted unadulterated away from any of those organizations. That's what's the matter. See? The seed must have... The seed plant must have seed water before it can grow. It must have water to fall before the seed that's been planted can grow. Now, "Why," you say, "Brother Branham, there's been..." Now, I know, that's right. Catching your thought now (You see?); you just can't hide it now. See? All right, so be careful what you're thinking.

L-45-6 Now, the seed must be planted, and then it must have water in order to grow. Now, you say, "Well, Brother 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min Branham (I'm going to express your thoughts on there.), we've had the water." So be it. That's correct. You have had the water. Did you ever plant cabbage, or anything, or seeds, or something or other like that, you usually... Ain't got no water they just pour a little on it. See? All right, but now wait, what did we have in that planting time? The former rain. "Oh," you say, "Brother Branham, nonsense." Now, wait just a minute. You take the word "former" in Joel 2 and look at it and see if the Hebrew word--go to the Hebrew and see if it don't... If you want to write it down, m-o-u-r-e-h, moureh, and get the Hebrew word and interpret and see what "moureh" means: "teaching." Amen. The teaching rain has went forth. The denominational teaching rain has went forth. "A million more in '44," Baptists, So-and-so, So-and-so, members in the church. Oral Roberts, and them brothers with the Pentecostal move the economic--or the great Pentecostal move--done moved up into the millions. See? That's right. And the Seed has went forth, the Word, for the minority, the group.

L-46-1 Now, watch. Now, remember the word "m-o-u-r-e-h, moureh," means "teaching, the former rain." It says "the moureh rain, the teaching rain," teaching rain went forth. Billy Graham has struck the world. The Pentecostals struck the world, and the Word has struck the world. Now, what's the matter now? She's now waiting for the latter rain. That's when she produces her fruits. Oh, I hope you get it.

L-46-3 Then the kind of seed you have planted in your field will be the kind of crop you will reap. If the denominations wants more members, that's what they're going to get. That's what they have gotten. The Pentecostals wants more Pentecostals; that's what they're going to get. That's right. But the Word's going to produce sons and daughters of God. Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's coming too. Watch, look at that great latter rain supposed to be done, how they would run over the wall, and leap over, and how they'd be an army coming. Just wait a minute. Uh-huh. The kind of crop you'll get is the kind of seed you put in your field.

L-46-4 All right. The two denominational kinds... You understand? The two denominational kinds will unite together to go to Sodom. But the Word will stay with the elected, the Royal Seed. Amen. See? Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man." Two angels went down, two anointed ministers, went down to Sodom to try to bring out a man that was backslidden (had a little speck of God about him), and his wife, his bride... You know what happened to her; she was disgraced. And look at his daughters and look what it hatched out to be after they got out. Was always a "hair in the biscuit." You know that's right. Excuse that expression, but you know, a gaggy thing, so that's a... It always was; we know that. Now, you can't deny God's Word.

L-47-1 But there was One that stayed with Abraham that gave a sign. Is that right? All right, all right. One stayed back... What was Abraham and his group called? The elected seed that never went down. They were pilgrims. They journeyed here; they journeyed there. They journeyed here; they journeyed there: interdenominationals. But the denomination went down and made himself a city, and Lot became the priest, or the bishop, or the--you know, whatever it was there, the big man, set in--sit in the city and done the judge, who says (the bishop or state presbyter), "No, we won't have that guy in our midst; no, sir. He disagrees with our theology. We can't have it." There's old Lot. There he set. "If he don't pack credentials from our group, we won't have him at all." Who made you a judge over the house of God, you hybrid? Uh-huh. God's Word will be preached anyhow.

L-47-2 Saint Martin went to a group like that, and that guy wouldn't even stand up to give him respect after he had broke the gate. God even burned his robe off of him, back of him, made him rise up and salute that prophet of God that entered the city. Uh-huh. See? That's right. His seat caught on fire where he was setting, the throne he was on. That's right. You've read the history of the church. Yes, sir. He went down there with the true Word, performed miracles and signs and proved on the Word that he was. They had their own bishopry, and they had what they wanted, and that's just what they wanted; but God's going to see that... Might been some elected children in there, and He had to go get them. That's right.

L-47-3 So remember, what was it? Now, let's stop here just a minute. Lot once had the choice to be interdenominational himself. Is that right? He once had the choice to journey with Abraham, but the love of the world choked him out. That's what it's done today. And remember, those down in Sodom never seen one of those supernatural miracles. They had a blinding; and preaching the Word blinds the eyes of the unbeliever. That's what Billy Graham and them's done: 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min blinded the eyes of them unbelievers out there. That's right. Now, you can't deny that Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming..." And here it is in the Bible. See? It'll be the same thing at the coming of the Son of man.

L-48-1 Now, watch, but there was One which was the Word. He was the Word, and where did He stay? With the promised one, the elected one. The Word stayed with the elected one. And the Word of God today will stay with the elected ones, the Royal Seed of Abraham by the promise. What kind of a works did it do? When it was manifested about eight hundred years later in the form of Jesus Christ, it done the same works that that One did there, the Word did at the gate at Abraham's tent, set with His back turned to the tent, told Abraham his name was Abraham, not Abram, what it always had been (what his name...), but his name was Abraham, 'cause God met him a few days before that and told him his name was Abraham. Said, "Where is Thy wife (not S-a-r-r-a, S-a-r-a-h.)... Where is Thy wife Sarah?" like He didn't know. Said, "She's in the tent behind You." He said, "I'm going to visit you ('I,' the personal pronoun.), I'm going to visit you according to the time of life (Oh.), and you're going to have that baby that you've waited on. The latter rain is fixing to fall. You've hold that seed in there long enough now, on believing, and you're looking for a coming son, and he's coming." Amen. That's the real church today (See?), that elected Seed. "You've been looking for him, and I'm going to send him to you." Amen. What said that? The Word.

L-48-4 "Oh," you say, "that wasn't the Word." I beg your pardon. Abraham called Him Elohim; that's the Almighty Self-Existing One. He was the Word: Elohim. Where did He come to? Abraham's seed. Now, remember, He had nothing to do with them denominations. He stayed right with the elected, and preached (That's right.), and showed the sign. And Jesus said... And now, wait just a little bit.

L-48-6 Then Sarah, in herself... Watch that pollution. See? Now, actually to disbelieve that, God would've killed her right there. Did you know that? And she come out and denied... Abraham... She laughed up her sleeve, in other words, to herself. Now, she never even maybe even cracked a smile but down in her heart she [Brother Branham illustrates Sarah laughing--Ed.]. See, she kind of laughed a little bit. "Me, an old woman, a hundred years old, fifty years since the menopause, time of life, live with him all that years. Why, we haven't lived as husband and wife for twenty-five years, maybe, thirty. See? And you mean to say I'm going to have pleasure with my lord." Abraham, her husband. That's the kind of wives you all ought to be, should be. Paul said the same thing. Love your husband that much. Not just hybreed something out here. You see? Remember your thoughts. We'll get to that this afternoon in the womb thought.

L-49-1 So now, but in that, she loved Abraham so much she called him her lord, "My lord being old too, and me old, and me have pleasure with him again?" And she... [Brother Branham illustrates Sarah laughing--Ed.] And the Angel showed Abraham Who He was, that He was the Word. He said, "Why did Sarah laugh?" So he called her forth, and she said, "I never." He said, "But you did." What? That's grace. See, right there God would've slew her, right there, but He couldn't. Oh, see our stupidity? He'd kill every one of us, but He can't. To kill Sarah, He had to take Abraham, 'cause Sarah was a part of Abraham. They were one in union. And to take the church and destroy it, He can't do it, because it's part of Himself: Christ, part of Himself, the Word being made flesh. Oh. "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound!" Couldn't do it. You get it? He couldn't kill her. He couldn't take her life, because she was part of Abraham. See, she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone.

L-49-3 In our mistakes... Don't say, "Well, I--I made a failure." No, that don't make a...?... Abraham made failures too. See? But He couldn't take the church. He can't kill the elected. He can't take your life, because you're part of Himself. You're the Word. The Word is in you. It's manifested Itself, proven Itself: love, joy, peace, long-suffering. All the Words of God, you believe everyone of them: working, God working through you. See, you're part of the Word which is Christ. And we are taught that He is the Word, and we are flesh of His flesh and bone of His bone. There you are. Now, we're coming down to something.

L-50-1 Moureh, moureh, the rain, former rain, planting rain, has went forth. Now, what had happened? The former rain 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min was being planted. The latter rain fell. What happened? Sodom and its Sodomites burned. Abraham received the promised son. Jesus said, "Let them grow together. The tares shall be bound, bundled, and burned. The garner... The wheat will go to the garner." See? The latter rain's just at hand. We're going to get... I don't want to wait too long on that, 'cause I got something real good back here on that; I know. See?

L-50-3 The two denominations will unite, Pentecostal and these other, and will unite, but the--the Word will stay with Abraham's promised Seed as It did then. Jesus said, "As it was then..." Can... Have you got ears to hear? eyes to see? understanding to understand with? Jesus said, "As it was... Is not it written..." would He say if He was standing here this morning? Would not... would not He say this: "Is not it written that as the days of Sodom, so shall it be at the coming of the Son of man." Don't you see the two harvests coming up here, receiving their last shower? They've come along to that last shower. See? Then what happened? The angels and the Lord disappeared. Then the rain took place.

L-50-4 All right. Now, watch real close now. Now, I believe I was on this subject here, yeah, on the rain, and the lat--for the latter rain. All signs are pointing to the end now. Everybody that believes God's Word knows that. Even... Let me stop on another one right here. I'm going to have to call names. I don't mean to be rude, but I've got a... I'm--I told God I--I--I'd pull no punches. I'd come right here and just express exactly what I've knowed all my life, and then there's some things over here at the end I'm going to have to withhold; I know; but I--I'm going to express to you as far as He will let me do it. First I'm... Mrs. Wood knows that after I got this and many more pages beside this, the Holy Spirit said, "Don't do that." Did I call you, Mrs. Wood, and said He told me not to do that? So I went back and prayed, and that night He come to me in a vision and said, "Go do this. Take this and place it there, 'cause they won't understand this. It isn't time for this yet; place this here." And I did. That's right. See? "Obedience is better than sacrifice." See? All right. Obeying...

L-51-1 Now, now look, we're... Show you that we're at the end time, even the un--the parable of the wise version and the unwise version--virgin is with us. Now, look, the unwise version--virgin (Excuse me.), the unwise virgin is going to be the hybrid. See, she had the seed without the oil, the moisture to make it grow. Now, and what's she doing? The--the two groups, the Pentecostal group and the denominational of the world, the Evangelical groups has emerging together. See? What for? Going to Sodom (So, see? Now, notice.) to reap this harvest.

L-51-2 Notice, the unwise virgin, virgin. Have you noticed that... Even one of my great friends, a real scholar, a man that's smart, intelligent, brilliant Pentecostal man... And I noticed my brethren in the Christian Business Men is shouting the praises of God because in there they got Episcopalian preachers, Catholic priests. I wonder if those men are sound asleep. Do you realize... They say, "Oh, it's the greatest thing you ever heard, Brother Branham. Why, this Episcopalian people, people come over here, and they say they got the Holy Ghost. They spoke in tongues; they've did these things. Glory to God. I'm telling you, they're--they're--they're just... Why, their church has been revolutionized." Oh, my, brethren, don't you know what that is? It's the sign.

L-51-3 When the wise virgin wants oil--or the unwise virgin, rather, wants oil, and while she's buying it, that's the time that the Bridegroom come. Oh, you Pentecostals, what's the matter? Well, you can't see it unless God shows it to you; that's one thing sure. If--if you wasn't borned back yonder, predestinated to it, you're going to miss it. Blessed are their ears that can hear; blessed are the hearts that can understand, for the time is at hand, every sign pointing to it. See?

L-51-4 Look what kind of revivals they're having: great revivals, have had. Looks good, doesn't it? You say, "Well, Brother Branham, now you've got us on a limb." That's where I wanted you. How you going to know what's right and wrong? Give it the Word test. That's the way to tell whether it's right or wrong. That's it; just--just give it the Word test. See what it says about the Word. Any spirit, see what it says about the Word. If it denies the Word, it's not of God. See? No matter what it is, if it denies the Word, it's not of God. Look, give it the Word test and see what happens. Jesus warned us of these things: Matthew the 24th chapter and the 35th verse. I just want to refer to that, 'cause on account of the tapes.

L-52-1 Just a moment. Now, we haven't got but just about twenty more minutes till we dismiss, and--and I'm sure we're not going to even get one third of the way through, but I've got to read this anyhow (See?), Matthew 24:35. Now, listen 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min real close what Jesus said. Now, how this--how He told us that the two spirits would be so close, it'd deceive the very elected. You know that, don't It? Now, is it going to be true? Yes, sir. Matthew 24:35 says... ... heavens and earth shall pass away, but My Word shall not pass away. (See?) Now, He... That the two spirits so close together... Now, it's got to be that way. It's got to be that way. The--the Pentecostal denomination has got to act so real like the real until Jesus said that only the elected wouldn't be deceived. That kills me nearly. But, my denominational brethren, can't you see why--why I've done what I done? See? So close that it would deceive the very elected if it was possible. But to the elected that's elected to Eternal Life... Now, you talk about striking this; we're going to strike it after while, really hit it. See? See, remember it's the elected is the only kind that'll catch it.

L-52-4 "Well, you say, "how do you know that you're not right?" Then test me by the Word. Come, test your denomination by this Word. Let's see who's right. "Prove all things," the Bible said. You say, "It don't make any difference; be baptized this way that..." It does make a difference. That's what Satan told Eve. Somebody already been baptized in Acts 19, a good Christian man baptized them too, John the Baptist. Paul said, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" We said... He said, "We know not whether there be any Holy Ghost." Said, "Then how was you baptized? If you'd caught it you'd have knowed it." (See?) Said, "How would you have... How--how was you baptized?" He said, "Unto John (the great man that baptized Jesus)." Paul said, "That will not work now." 'Cause John never baptized, only unto repentance, not for remission of sins; the sacrifice wasn't offered. And when they heard this, they were rebaptized in the Name of Jesus Christ.

L-53-2 What if Moses said... God said, "Take off your shoes, Moses"? He said, "You know I tied them a little tight this morning, Lord. I'll show more respect; I'll take off my hat." That wouldn't have worked. He never said hat; He said shoes. And that's the devil that tries to whitewash that like he did with mother Eve. It's every Word the Truth just the way God's got it wrote there. That's the way I believe it. Now, you can go ahead; you say, "Well, we got the truth." Well you go ahead then. That's all right. If you're that blind, you go right ahead, staggering in darkness. This is the Word that's going to judge you, brother, not your creed. Oh, it looks good, yes, sir, looks good.

L-53-5 And you say, "Well, Brother Branham, wait a minute. Bless God, I've seen them go out there and heal the sick." Oh, sure; so have I. "Oh, I've seen them speak in tongues." Yes, sir. So have I. And I've never believed, and there's no one can prove it by God's Word, that the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongue. I want the man to come do it. I've challenged that all along. I believe in speaking in tongues. Yes, sir; but I've seen devils speak in tongues, witches and wizards speak in tongues and interpret it, denying there was such a thing as Jesus Christ. I've seen men speak in tongues living with another man's wife. Stand and look me right in the face and a vision before him, call him out to one side and made him a witness to it. And you call that the Holy Spirit?

L-53-6 Oh, yes. You say, "Well, Brother Branham, don't you believe the Holy Ghost speaks in tongues?" Yes, sir, but give it the Word test. See, Jannes and Jambres worked miracles. That's right, didn't they? Yes, sir. Jannes and Jambres... When Moses went down to Egypt, everything that Moses done in the way of a sign, Jannes and Jambres, them two witches, could produce the same thing: two devils. Moses would say, "Fleas." They said, "Fleas." Moses said, "A stick on the ground." They said, "A stick on the ground." "A serpent." "A serpent." That's right. They could work miracles. The Bible said that in the last days that devils would rise working miracles and would deceive the people. Awful hard, brother, but you must know the Truth. 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min

L-54-2 Jesus said, "Many will come to Me in that day and say, 'Lord, Lord, have not I did this, and did that, and did that, and so forth, in Your Name?'" He'd say, "Depart from Me, you worker of iniquity." What is iniquity? Something that you know that's wrong, and you do it anyhow; and you know that God's Word is right. Why do you play the hypocrite? Because of your organization and pick a little bit here and won't take the rest of it. "You worker of iniquity," He said, "depart from Me; I never even knew you." Now, that's... You either wade through hell here or hereafter, so... See?

L-54-4 Now, remember, that's true; that's what Jesus said. Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses; remember and the Bible said, "As they withstood Moses, in the last days they would reappear, those spirits, again." What? Just before the liberation of the people. Hallelujah. The liberation time's here. Jesus said in Matthew 24 over there that--that they would deceive the very elected if it was possible. Just the elected will catch it, just one here and there: the very elected, if possible... "As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so will these men of reprobate mind concerning the Word..." concerning the Truth, and the Word is the Truth. Is that right? Now, this is not skim milk, friends. See, see?

L-54-5 Look, they... The Bible said. Jesus said that they would be so close that they would deceive the very elected, if it was possible; but it ain't possible. That Seed's going to fall there, because of it's predestinated to fall there. The seeds has went forth. The denominations is sowed; the Word's been sowed. See? And Jannes and Jambres, they--them people... The Bible said these devils would rise up in the last days and would deceive the people by these miracles and signs that they could perform. How you going to know the difference? The Word.

L-55-1 The... Even the Old Testament said, "If they speak not according to the law and prophets, there's no life in them." If they deny one thing... Then show me one person was ever baptized using the title of, Name of Father, Son, Holy Ghost. Why do you do it then? A creed, hybrid, dead children, bastard children, twice dead, plucked up by the roots. "And every root that My--every plant that My heavenly Father hasn't planted will be rooted up. Both heavens and earth will pass away, but My Word shall not pass away," said Jesus. Now, you see why I've stood the way I have?

L-55-2 Show me one place, if it isn't a curse for a woman to cut her hair. There you are. Then you fuss at me. Then people say, "Brother Branham's a prophet. Oh, you can believe him as long as he's talking to the people, telling their sins and things like that; but when he goes to teaching, don't you believe that." Well, you poor hypocrite. You don't know nothing. Doesn't the Bible say the Word of the Lord came to the prophets? I don't call myself a prophet; I'm no prophet. But you said so; I'm saying what you said. And then turn around and say a thing like that. Don't say you didn't do it. I've even got it taped where you said it. You didn't know that, did you? Just want you to say you didn't one time; that's all I want you to say. I'll let your own voice play back to you.

L-55-3 As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses: miracle workers, but where was the Word, the true Word? There was guys working miracles. There was guys could do everything in the miracle line that... But there was two anointed prophets standing there, or one prophet and his helpmate. There was an anointed prophet called Moses, stood there, had THUS SAITH THE LORD. And at the end, it was all manifested before the deliverance. Is that right? The so-called miracle workers died right out.

L-55-4 Now, what they're trying to do, they're trying to--to manufacture a latter rain. Nonsense. Why, that latter rain will sweep the world, brother. And then a former rain sowing Word... That's right. Now, you'll see what the latter rain produces. You'll find out there'll be an affiliation. The Pentecostals and all the groups will come together, and they'll shut the doors on them guys that won't listen to it; and you won't even be allowed to open your mouth. That's right. That's when He will come. That's when He will show. That's when you'll see a rain. Oh, my, lay still; be quiet; let it go. See?

L-56-1 Oh, but the Word was with that anointed prophet because the Word of the Lord came to the prophet. Now, God doesn't change His system. No, no. He never changed His system. Now, what was it? There stood three again. There went Jannes and Jambres performing miracles, like went down to Sodom, done one little miracle, blinded people. See? There stood Abraham, the anointed one, with God and his helpmate Sarah. Is that right? Here stood Jannes and Jambres performing miracles: anything that Moses could do in the sign of miracles, signs. And there stood the anointed 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min Word, the prophet, with his helper, his assistant. Oh, I wished I could preach on that now for just about a good two hours.

L-56-2 All right. In Genesis 1, remember, every seed after its kind. It must forever be that way. There's all those types. A man who would say, could believe, that the church will go through a tribulation period, I wonder where you'd ever get a seed for that? When even... "Well," you say, "I believe it says this that they'll do..." That's all right. Did you notice back yonder where the rains fell on the other time? Where did it fall? Noah was in the ark before the judgment struck. Sodom: Lot was out of Sodom before it ever taken place. See? That's... Sure, we're--we ain't going through no tribulation period; we're going in a rapture one of these days. Certainly. What do we... Why do you have to be judged? He stood my tribulation: Jesus Christ. There's where my tribulation taken place right there, yeah. I accepted Him, and free... "When I see the blood I'll pass over you." That's right. Moses was safe--safely protected with Israel while the tribulation fell. That's right.

L-56-3 All right. Every seed must come after its kind. God made man in His image after His kind to be His Word on earth. He expressed it in Jesus Christ. What was? God was in Christ. That's a Man after His kind. See? When God, which is the Word... How many knows He's the Word? When the Word was in Christ, a man, human man, expressing Itself through Him, that was God, the Word, in Christ expressing Himself. And God in the beginning made man in His Own image, and that's the kind of man that God makes today. The seminary and the incubator hatchery turns out a bunch of hybrids (See?), the schools. But when God calls a man, he's in His Own image: the Word made alive in him. That's right. There he is; that's God's man, man in His Own image, in His very likeness. And Jesus said, that he will do the works that I do. So God made man in His Own image after His kind.

L-57-1 His kind, what is His kind? the Word. He is the Word. Then if a man denies God's Word, how can he be in God's image? Just ask the question. Ask yourself. "How can he be in God's image and deny God's Word, when the Word's expressed image of Himself?" "Oh," he says, "it doesn't mean that." Expressed image of God saying, "Oh, I said it, but I didn't really mean it. I--I was wrong there. I--I back up. That was for some other time. I didn't mean it." Oh mercy, trash, slop of the Devil that he fed to Eve. Don't let him try to poke it down the elected's neck though. No, sir. They won't believe that. "Just come and join with our gang." Join nothing; you got to be born; not join; a new creature.

L-57-2 Yes, in His Own image of His kind to be--to be His expressed Word on earth. Now, Jesus was God's expressed Word. Do you believe that? Then what are we to be? Sons of God too, with the expressed Word in the church, carrying on (That's the mystical Body of Christ.), carrying on the same works that Jesus did when He was here on earth. See? That's the kind after His kind. Now, you can have the Lutheran kind after the Lutheran; the Methodist kind after the Methodist; the Catholic kind after the Catholic; the Pentecostal kind after its kind; the Oneness after its; the Trinity after its; but if you're God's kind, that's different. See, you're the expressed image of the Word making Itself manifest. Oh, my. Why, it's got to. If the water falls on it, it's got to do it.

L-57-4 Then--then give him a birth, a tie... And he... After God made man in His Own image... I just don't think I got time for this next expression; it's a dandy, but I don't want to... All of God's words are dandies. See? And look here, where I was supposed to be at--at dinner time, I'm just about that far away from it (See?), about one-sixth of it. Humph. All right, can I... Let's just leave it there. What do you say? And then we... Now, how many can come back this afternoon? Raise your hand...?... Good. I don't want to keep you too long. Now, I'll just... I don't want to wear you out. And now, I... Now, you tape boys, just leave the tapes run just a minute, and I'll--I'll cut this off just in a minute myself. All right, sir.

L-58-2 Now, we... Our last thought here was that God made man in His Own image after His kind. God made a man after His kind. You get it? A man after His kind. Well, what kind of a Man was he? If you'll look back and see what He was when He was made flesh, that's the kind of man He makes. Is that right? A man after His kind... Amen. That's right, isn't it? That's His kind of man. Uh-huh. He said another time, one time to a man: "You're after My Own heart," a man after His Own heart: David. Remember 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min that? The Spirit of God in David: David, a rejected king. Always the anointed is rejected. David, the rejected king, went up the hill when his own people... I'll preach this for this next three minutes. When David's own people should be, his own kind dethroned him, his own son, and run him off the throne. David went down there, and even one of them come out there spitting on him, that anointed king. This little old guy come along crippled up in his doctrine (The Bible said he was crippled, you know.), and he went along spitting on that king. Watch Christ. Spitting on him... That messenger by his side, an angel representing him, pulled a sword said, "Should the head of that dog stay on, spit on that king?" That angel said, "I'll strike him dead."

L-58-4 David said, "Put up your sword. I have to do this." Went up on top of the hill of Jerusalem, looked back down, a rejected king, and he wept. Eight hundred years from there the Son of David, the Spirit that was in David in a portion, stood on the same hill, a rejected king being spit on and made fun of. Is that right? I can imagine God said, that Angel was walking along there with Him when He went up to Calvary like that: "Shall the head of that dog stay on?" "Let him alone." Oh, my, there's coming a time. But what about David when he come back? The story changed. David come riding in triumph. This fellow run screamed for mercy. Sure, let him alone. He will come someday in power. Then the laugh will turn the other way. That's right, just let them alone.

L-59-1 But God said, "David, you're a man after My Own heart." When God creates a man, he's of His kind. David said, "Thy Word have I hid in my heart that I sin not against You, Lord." Only thing he needed was the rain. David would've been all right if he could just had that rain, but the Holy Ghost wasn't yet given. He had the Word, and the Word was in him, and he could know It; he said, "I've hid It in my heart, Lord. It--It won't bloom out and act like It should, but I've hid It there Lord. I've hid It." But when Jesus came, which was the Word made manifest took the germ life out of it and brings it back to the Word now. And if David's cup run over, what ought ours to do?...?... Without the Spirit. Amen. Isn't He wonderful? You love Him? Isn't He wonderful, wonderful, wonderful? Isn't Jesus My Lord wonderful? Eyes have seen, ears have heard, What's recorded in God's Word; Isn't Jesus my Lord wonderful? Isn't He? How many loves It? How many love Him? Oh my, He's wonderful.

L-59-2 Now, it's rough, friends. It's very rough. I don't mean to be that myself. Yeah, I hope you understand that. See? But today I'm giving the expression of why I have did the things that I have done. Now, for just a little analysis before we dismiss for lunch is this: I want you to know that I have... This has been my motive, and my objective, is God's Word. My motive is to please Him. And I can't listen to everything and believe God's Word; neither can I listen to everything and please God. My motive is to know His Word and to please God by serving Him by His Word. Not that I have anything against... Now, every person in here that's borned of the Spirit of God, that's in the elected group was perhaps once a Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, or something or other somewhere. Now, you know that. You know that. So then you see, when you say, "Go out to them," that's what you have to do. There's somebody in there, if you'll sow the seed, there'll be a harvest someday. It'll fall... Some of it'll go by and say, "Ah, he's nothing but a... he's a deceiver." Didn't they say the same thing about our Lord? "There's nothing to that." Well then, why don't you check it with me? See, see, see? "He's nothing but a deceiver." See? Then check it with the Word. See, if it isn't the Word, then it is deceiving. See? Now, if your theology's different from the Word, then it isn't right. See?

L-60-1 Now, others will go by and say, "Well, you know what, I believe I'll try it a while." You'll choke. That's right. See? But when you really empty out, say, "Lord Jesus, no more of me, but You from this on," (See?) then it's going to bring forth a hundredfold. You believe that? I believe it too. Well, it's with liberty and justice for all. That's right. Yes, sir. I pledge my allegiance to my Lord (See?) to preach His Word and to stand on His Truth if it costs my life. I'll still go on just the same. 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min For I would... it would be a great thing for me, not wanting to do it, but if I had to do it, will mingle my blood in this earth like those who mingled their blood for the same thing, like those who died in the pits of the lions; like those who died on the crosses; those who were sawed asunder, that was kicked out of their organizations and wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, and was destitute. It would be a great privilege for me as the disciples of Christ return back and it count it all joy because they were able to stand the reproach that was brought on His Name. They could suffer that for Him, their little suffering. I don't want to suffer; nobody wants to suffer. I would like to join my hands with all the denominations, say, "Brethren, let's go." I'd like to do that. If I do, I take my hand out of His. Far be it from me ever doing that. If I stand alone, I stand with Him and His Word.

L-60-3 For as Eddie Perronett said, "On Christ the solid Rock I stand; all other grounds is sinking sand." And Christ is the Word. "In the beginning..." And what is it? Every word brings forth... Every seed brings forth of its kind. The denominational seed will bring forth of its kind. The Pentecostal organization will bring forth of its kind. The Baptists will bring forth of its kind. What is it? Organization, constantly, constantly. We're going to show this afternoon, God willing, how them started, and what caused it, and where the Bible said they would, and how they'll end up, exactly what'll be the end.

L-61-1 God bless you all in the car. Many of you all that's in the cars that couldn't come in, that's listening through this mike. And God bless you that's standing around these walls, and you that sit here this morning. And I trust that by the grace of God, I haven't brought any offense. But I'm making myself clear. Now, if you believe the same thing that I have said this morning, would not you stand the same way? Sure you would. Let us bow our heads just a moment.

L-61-3 Gracious heavenly Father, we're not trying to bring the meeting to a close but just a halt for a little rest for a few moments. And now, may these seeds that's been sown this morning, may they have fallen upon good fertile ground. May they bring forth abundance, Lord, abundance of Eternal Life. Now, we pray, Father, that these seeds that's sown will be laying waiting for the latter rain to fall. Waiting... They that wait upon the Lord, they shall renew their strength. God, may we not run ahead of the Word; stay with the Word. Grant it, Lord. Bless us now, and those who go off to eat, I pray that You'll give them their lunches, and--and bless their food, and give them strength, and bring them back this afternoon real early. Lord, may they be setting in the temple here waiting. And may You help me as I go to pray and come back. I pray that You'll a-freshly anoint me this afternoon. Grant it, Lord, that I might bring what I believe to be Your Word to the people. Grant it, Father.

L-61-5 I pray that You'll bless our dear beloved pastor, Brother Neville, our precious brother, a few minutes to get into the water here with a group of people to go into baptism. And, Father, if there's any here this morning that has been baptized otherwise than Christian baptism that Your great servant, Paul... And he said that he had the Word of God within him, and he said, "If a man or an Angel (even an Angel come down from heaven, like Satan was in the form of an Angel) come down and said anything different than that what He said, let him be accursed." Father, we know that that's written in the Scripture, and I pray, Father, that--that it will--it will sink into their hearts that Paul was the very one that made the people that had not been baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins, he was the one who commissioned them to be baptized over again. May it go to the people, Father. May they realize that this baptismal service moving up, may they realize that that's the truth, knowing that they can't produce one word in the Scripture to support their trinitarian three god idea... Father, of course we believe You're trinity of offices, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Most surely we believe that, Lord, but not making You three gods: making You one God that serve three offices, both Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and the Name of that God was called Jesus Christ. Now, that is the Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost.

L-62-1 Father, may the people see it and be obedient to water baptism for the remission of their sins. And may these few words for baptism fall deeply now in the heart of everyone, for we don't know how much longer we have, Father. It's getting very close. The enemy, as we expect to speak on this afternoon, is growing deeper, more bolder all the time. Since they've took the throne; they're moving right on in. Lord, we see it on every hand. Not Communism, Lord, may the people be able to understand that it's Romanism, the old mother whore and her harlots; and we see them, Lord, 62-0318m, The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed - Pt. 1, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 195 min coming an image unto the beast and here we are. Father God, be merciful now, and let us all get into the safety, into the ark and be ready for the latter rain. We ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-62-3 Now, to you that's here in the building, now if you want to slip out and get something to eat, all right. And if you want--and then come back... Get in here just as quick as you can after the service. Now, let's stand just a moment. Let's--let's stand up together. How many believes the Word of the Lord, raise up your hand. Amen. Oh, thank the Lord. "Oh, How I Love Jesus." Oh, how I love Jesus; Oh... [Brother Branham prays over handkerchiefs--Ed.] Lord Jesus, bless these handkerchiefs. Give to them, Lord, the anointing of the Spirit upon them. Lord, we believe it in Jesus' Name...?... Because He first loved me. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
