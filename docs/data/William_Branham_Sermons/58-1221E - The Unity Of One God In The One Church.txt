L-1 [Brother Branham has Brother Neville to read for him the 17th chapter of St. John: These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal Life to as many as thou hast given Him. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are one. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled. And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent Me, and hast loved me, as thou hast loved me. Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them. Brother Neville says, "And may the Lord add His blessing to the reading of the entire chapter; 17th chapter of Saint John's Gospel." Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-3 Thank you, Brother Neville. The Lord bless you, Brother Neville. I am just like Brother Neville, I got... just couldn't wait till Christmas, to open up that present. And, you know, once the 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min man and twice the child. But I certainly think Brother Neville looks real nice in his new suit. And I got one of the prettiest overcoats I ever seen in my life from this church down here, and I certainly appreciate it. I thank you for your judging me a little bit bigger than what I really am, but I believe they'll get me one just a little bit smaller tomorrow. It's just a little bit too much coat for all the man it is to cover. So you heard in the Bible, where the blanket was too short for the man, or the bed; so it's just about almost that way with--with this here with me, because I--the--the coat was just a little large. But it's certainly pretty, and I hope they got one there just about one number smaller that'll fit me real good. And I'll wear it out too, to show it like you did that. I have seen the time where I've preached with the overcoat on, all right, glad to have it on. Well, I haven't had a good overcoat all my life. This is the first time I ever owned a good overcoat.

L-7 I just wonder if this church can remember my first going away from this church. You remember what it was that night when I went to St. Louis, from this church, to visit Robert Daugherty's daughter? Now, Sister and Brother Spencer, I guess, can remember it, and Brother Roy Slaughter here, and many of them who... I didn't even have any coat at all. And the church made up eleven dollars for my ticket. And I borrowed my brother's overcoat. And it was just about twice too big for me, and I packed it because it looked so bad for me to wear it. And then I looked bad not to have any at all, so I--I packed it. And when I got over there, was there a couple days, and the Lord begin to move, and healed little Betty. You know, I seen her not long ago; she's a beautiful young woman now. She had Saint Vitus' dance, and was just laying like an animal, jerking back and forth, for days and days. And the best of doctors had give her up. I stayed that day and that evening. The Lord showed a vision just on what to do, and said little Betty would be delivered as soon as I did that.

L-9 I told the minister and his father to stand. I said to the lady, "You was in the city the other day, buying little pans, and you bought one that's a blue granite pan. It's setting in your cabinets, down beneath. You've never moved it since you put it in there." She started; she said, "That's right." I said, "Go get it and fill it with water, and bring a little white towel, and come here. For, THUS SAITH THE LORD, little Betty will be healed." See?

L-12 [Brother Roy Slaughter, in the congregation says, "Brother Branham, I'd just like to say one word, if it'd be all right?"--Ed.] Yes, go ahead. ["You know when you was out there, you remember that--that I called you. Our girl was sick. And you called your wife, and tell her... Well, at first, I called you, and left a message, 'Already, five doctors said there had been no hope with medical authorities."] Yes. ["And when you come in, you said, 'There's a call from Brother Slaughter, will you take it?' Said, 'That's one of the best firends I've got,' or something like that."] Yes, sir. ["And you went and prayed. you went and called your wife, and you said to call us and tell them, 'The girl will be all right.' And she didn't know it was sick, you see."] Yes. ["And--and so, she went next day, and she was in the hospital. The doctors come in. They said they been... 'Something has took--something has took... was happened.' She says, 'Yes.' And they begin to kind of go over, maybe, of what they had done it. She said, 'No.' Said, 'It was the prayers of Brother Branham.'"] Yes, I remember that. ["She had a fever, that they didn't know what was the matter, those five doctors, so it had no time. But when I came, I came out of the field, to call you; and the wife was sending a child to me to call you. She was..."] Yes. ["... come out there, 'To call Brother Branham.' So, was just a coincidence, we met in the field. Than when I called you, 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min then you had prayer. And you called back, and you said, 'Tell, that girl is all right.' And she is all right...?..."] Yes.

L-13 Honey, I guess you remember that, don't you, when we was in St. Louis in the--in the meeting, that Brother Slaughter's little girl took real sick. And we was at the old Belcher Bath Hotel. I can remember that just so well. And we took the message and went before the Lord, and He showed the vision, said. And I called Brother Slaughter and them, called them and said, "Tell them, 'THUS SAITH THE LORD. Don't worry, she'll live.'" And she did. The Lord was so good.

L-14 Been lots of things happen since then, but He is still the same Lord Jesus. Isn't it so marvelous. I just can't think of anything better than to know that--that if I was going to inherit every penny of money the world owned, and going to live for a thousand years here on earth, I'd rather know just what I have right now: Eternal Life. The everlasting life will end after a bit. Eternal Life has no end, because It had no beginning, and so we're grateful for that.

L-15 Brother Neville has just read some Scriptures, that he read for me, out of the Book of St. John. And there was one Scripture there, the 21st verse, I'd like to call your attention to it just for a moment. Jesus, in His prayer, prayed this. That they all may be one; as thou, Father, are in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And if I should call it a text, I'd like to say this: "The Unity Of One God In The One Church."

L-17 You know, God has made man to--to achieve; that's what man was made for. And all down through life he has tried to achieve something. And his achievements, the reason he tries that, is because he was so designed to do so. God made him that way. But the trouble of it is, in his achievement he tries to do something within himself. And there's where he makes his mistake and he gets in trouble.

L-18 Now, in the beginning, Genesis, which is the seed chapter of the Bible, we find in there that when God made a man, He made him in the way that He knew that he was to be. And he could never be any greater design than what he is. When He begin to make life, He made it from the lowest life, which is, more or less, the polliwog, the frog; and on to the highest life is man, which is in the image of God.

L-19 And then, in this life, man begin to achieve things. But when he did, he begin to leave God out of the picture. He begin to have selfish motives. And--and when he did that, he begin to think of something for himself. And we find that it isn't long until he had corrupted the very planet that God had put him on. He had got it in such a condition till even His Creator, grieved Him at His heart, that He'd ever made a man. And you can imagine how God felt when He seen the very creature that He made in His image, and give him dominion, and how that He made him to do something for Him, and yet he turned all of his strengths and his power over to selfish desires and achievements.

L-20 And then we find, it isn't too long after this great lesson that God taught the man during that time, by destroying the entire world with water, as the Bible tells us that He flooded the earth, and destroyed everything but a remnant that He left, which was Noah and his family. And just immediately after he come out from that great lesson... It just seems like that man can't learn, only through the hard way. We find that even in our children; we have to punish them, many times, severely, to make them understand. It just seems like that a man is just in himself a total failure to begin with. When he lost his relationship with God, he become a unit of his own; he didn't depend on God no more. And when God had taught him the lesson of what it was to try to do something within himself, that his works would all come to naught, immediately we find them again going right down to achieve again. And the Bible said that they built them a tower, and they were going to climb up into the heavens to get up into heaven without coming the way God had planned for them to come.

L-22 And man can achieve better when they're united together. Now you take one man by himself, his power is limited to one man. Two men makes him twice his strength. Four men makes him four times his strength. And God wants us to be one. God made man that we should be one, and our motives should be one, and our objectives should be one, and our--our achievements should be one. He's just designed that way. And we find out that immediately after the antediluvian destruction, that man began to try to take over again, himself. 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min

L-24 And all the time these things are going on, the Spirit of the living God is striving with flesh, trying to get man away from his own achievement, trying to get man away from his own selfish motives and objectives, to a plan which God has laid down. And as long as man works in his own plan, he will be a failure. And a man can only achieve right when he comes back with the right objective and the right motive, and that is according to God's plan for him. Any other foundation is on sinking sands.

L-25 And we find out then, that they tried to unite, and they begin come one person. But in this uniting they did that time, it was under a political power. Man became one; their objective was one; their achievements was one; but it was the wrong kind of one; because it was against the plan of God. But he continued to go on, and finally... When you find unity amongst people like that, they do great things. Just look over the world today, when people unify themselves together, yet under the wrong plan, they'll do great things.

L-27 Now, they built a tower which I doubt that modern science could build today with all their machineries and things, because they were united together. They had one mind, one soul, one purpose, one motive, one objective, that's build a tower so high that, if God ever took a notion to destroy them again, they'd run right up into the heavens with Him. And there would be no way that they could keep Him from doing it--or He could keep them from doing it as they thought. And we find out, then, that they organized themselves together, and we find them again completely out of the will of God.

L-28 And if that isn't a beautiful picture of this day, that when men are trying to unite together. And we should be united, but you're uniting under the wrong systems. Did you ever notice how the devil patterns off the things of God? Did you ever see that how he takes the things that God has purposed? And so deceiving is the wrong thing. Now, a lie, if it's just right out a real lie, then anyone can detect it. But that lie that's got about ninety-nine percent truth in it, that's the one that's deceiving.

L-30 Did you notice how that the devil deceived Eve? Everything he told her was exactly the truth, but one thing. Said, "Your eyes will be opened, and you shall know right and wrong, and--and so forth. And you shall be as gods, because you don't know right from wrong now." And all those things were true. But when she said, "The Lord God said we would die." He said, "Surely you won't die." See, just so much truth in it, and then just a little bit of lie. As Jesus said, on the earth, "A little leaven leavens the whole lump." And it's got to be perfectly right, or it isn't right at all. And the plan of salvation has got to be exact, and God's promises are exact, and they work exact, or there--there's something is wrong somewhere. And if the church of the living God is not achieving what God purposed for them to do, there's something wrong with that system somewhere: just got to be.

L-33 You take a fine piece of machinery like a watch, and let every piece of that machinery work in harmony, and it'll keep perfect time. But when one piece gets one way, and one another, it won't keep time. No matter how good the jewels are, it's all got to be unified together. That's God's purpose, for us to unify together and be one.

L-34 But we find out there, that, how the devil patterns things. All unrighteousness is only righteousness perverted. A lie is only the truth turned around. Good things that God does; wrong things is good things perverted. So therefore, that unrighteousness is righteousness perverted. Satan cannot create anything himself. He only has to take what God has created to pervert it. Man living with his wife is absolutely right; but take another woman, that's the same act is perverted, and it's death. One brings life; the other one brings death. That's the way that all--all the things that Satan has got in his reach is just taking what God has made and changing it around.

L-35 Did you ever think of the Mohammedan religion? At the grave of Mohammed, has been a white horse saddled, for two thousand years. Every four hours the guard changes and another white horse is brought out. And they do that reverently, and with constant belief that Mohammed will rise someday and ride the world down. They believe it. And did you ever think why the white horse? Did you know the Scripture says that Jesus shall come riding on a white horse, and His vesture dipped in blood, and His Name is called the Word of God? It's the Lord Jesus shall come riding in the 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min heavens with the armies behind Him, riding on a white horse. Can you see that perverted religion, turned around and make it Mohammed on a white horse? But Jesus is coming in the heavens, and Mohammed is earthly. So Satan works with the earth things, while God works with the heavens. And did you ever think of the tower of Babylon and compare it with Jacob's ladder? How that they were trying to build stair steps around the tower that would reach up into heaven, only trying to pervert Jacob's ladder which reached from the heavens to the earth, and Angels descending and ascending. Perverting it...

L-37 Did you ever think of the U.N. now trying to make all the nations one great big brotherhood, under a united power? United is all right. But it's under the wrong thing. Satan controls all the nations. The Scripture says that Satan is the ruler of the earth. When he taken Jesus up into a high, exceeding mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and he said, "these are mine," Jesus did not say they wasn't. For they are. That's the reason we have wars and killing, is because that these kingdoms of the world are controlled by the devil. And as long as they are controlled by the devil, we'll continue to have wars and fights, and killing one another. But we look for a Kingdom to come, where Christ shall come, and there will be no more wars. And there'll be an everlasting peace.

L-39 Did you think that in this Russia, they have got a false Pentecost? They are. That's the work of the devil. They're trying to force all men into communism, where every man has everything commonly. Do you know that was the condition of the Church under the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, that the people sold their possessions and laid them at the feet of the disciples, and they distributed them to every man as they had need? And now the devil's come around, and got into the world and made a political power to force man to that. God does not force man to do anything. You do it on your own free will. He can warn you, throw a barricade across your path, but you walk your own self with your own decision in His Presence to make Him your Saviour. But Satan has perverted God's plan to his own plan.

L-41 Did you ever think of Catholicism and the Catholic church is trying to make every person Catholic? It won't work. It's under a man-made program. Did you ever think of the Protestant church under the federation of churches is trying to force all these little churches out? And it will happen, that you'll not be able to go to church unless you belong to the union of churches, then little places like this will certainly pay for it. But we got a Scripture that says, "Fear not, little flock, it's your Father's good will to give you the Kingdom." That's what we look forward to.

L-43 Then, you see, it's all the achievement of the enemy tries to do to achieve, but it's under the wrong plan. It's under his own plans, but he has no original. He has to take something that God has did, and then pervert it into unrighteousness to do it. Today they're trying to pervert the world, or convert it into one great big union of--of nations, a brotherhood. And if it would be under a man-made disguisement, it would have a leader, and, hid--it would be the devil because he's the leader of all of them.

L-45 God's Kingdom is not of this earth. God's Kingdom is in our hearts. It's the spiritual Kingdom, that we're born into It. Jesus said, "The Kingdom of God comes, but not without violence. And the Kingdom of God is within you." The Holy Spirit, God's Kingdom, moving in the man, and governing and controlling him, that's the Kingdom. And we find that these nations go about deceiving one another, talking peace with a knife behind them, just ready to destroy each other.

L-47 A few days ago, I had the privilege of talking to a--a chaplain that's a great man. And, California, they had the scientists, some of the best that we got in the nations, had met there for a gathering, and to--to have a secret, closed meeting. And being that it was so terrible, they called a chaplain in with them. And this chaplain friend of mine, said, "Brother Branham, before I could be taken in, they searched my record to my great-grandmother, before I could go in this meeting." And he said, "I wish I had not been there." He said, "When those scientists got up and begin to speak," he said, "it seemed there was a gloom settled over the room, that made you feel like you was in an ice-house, chills, how it would curdle the blood of a man." Said, "They--we're not allowed to talk of these things. We're sworn under 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min oath."

L-48 But said, "I am allowed to tell you this." He said, "They're fixing to do away with the army and with the aviation, the aviator corps, and so forth." Said, "They don't need them no more." He said, "They've got weapons so deadly that they could destroy the whole earth in one second's time." And said, "If they would let that be known, that people would go panickly, and go into the streets, screaming to the top of their voice." Said, "They've got a bomb that would drop on the earth, just one bomb would blow a hundred and seventy-five miles around, and over a hundred feet deep."

L-49 Where could you go to hide? What if you dug a thousand feet? You couldn't; you'd go into the volcanic eruption of the earth. But if you could dig a thousand feet under the earth, a concussion like that hitting on top of you would smash you into powder. Said, "This one great scientist got up, and he was the top scientist of the army. He said, 'Gentlemen, I wish I could take an old cow and a wagon, and drive over behind the mountains and forget all about it, and serve my little time on earth, and leave.' He said, 'But we've got to face it. Driving behind the mountain won't do any good.' Said, 'Those mountains would become nothing but powder or volcanic ashes.'"

L-51 Oh, brother, it pays to know where you've got an escape in them times. We've got an escape; we got a Shelter. That shelter's under the wings of the Lord's everlasting protection; and knowing this, that you have an immortal soul that cannot die, that's not made with atoms, or with hydrogen, or with oxygen, or with anything that's on this earth; it's made by Spirit, that God Almighty created, Himself, and give to you. What a day that we are living, what a time, that where men has achieved and achieved until he's achieved himself these things. Now, what shall he do with them?

L-53 You see, Satan uses a man's head. He chose that in the garden of Eden, to take a man's head, his thinking. And he has brought that down even to the church. See, the devil takes a man's head, so he can use his eyes. And if you'll notice, if the man isn't genuinely borned again, spiritual, he'll take what he can see with his eyes, the pride of life. And he'll go, many men, to say he's going to--to achieve something. He wants to join church. He wants to be religious. And he'll look around till he can find the biggest church he can find, because man wants to do something big. He wants to make a big name for himself. That's what carnal, foolish-thinking man think, "Oh, if I can have my organization, if I can only add so-many thousands to my denomination, it'll be the largest then in the land of its kind." What good does that do? But he thinks he's achieving something because he's adding more.

L-54 I believe it was some years ago in 1944, that the Baptists had a--a slogan out, "A million more in '44." And what did they have when they got a million more? Just like joining a lodge, if they wasn't genuine borned again disciples of Christ. They were just Baptist by name. Look at the other denominations, the Lutheran, the Presbyterian, the Pentecostals, all the other denominations; they're the same. They're trying to achieve something. They want to do something great (See?), because it's his eye he's looking at. He thinks with his eye. And many times he don't understand that that's the thing that he oughtn't to do. But the devil takes the man's eye; he shows him something pretty. He opens his eyes to look at it. And he's got that into the church, into the intellectual thinking of man.

L-56 Some time ago, this great evangelist, Billy Graham, stood here in Louisville and held up his Bible. He said, "This is God's standard." And he's right. He's exactly right. Mordecai Hamm, the evangelist, my old Kentucky home, and I, were setting at the same table. Which, Billy was converted under Mordecai Hamm. And we were setting there. And he said, "What happens?" He said, "Paul went into a city and got one convert; he returned a year later and he had thirty by that one." Said, "I go into a city and have twenty thousand converts, return in a year and can't find twenty. Something's wrong." And he said, "You know what it is? It's you lazy preachers that set in the buildings, your offices, with your feet on the desk, and don't go visit the people." I thought, "Billy, that's a very good intellectual," please don't quote me, "but that isn't it. Who was the pastors that went to that one that Paul got converted?" It wasn't that.

L-58 It's here. Those so-called meetings today, and they are great meetings, but it only works on the intellectual part of man. A man gets under the spell of a revival, and he says, "Yes, I accept Christ," and he does it intellectually because 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min he's in a great crowd. He does it because there's great ministers before him, but it's only an intellectual conception. That man can never go on. He's got to come from his mind to his heart, and be borned again, or he'll never be able to stand the test.

L-59 Intellectual conceptions is all right, but when... You remember, when the eye looks upon it, the devil uses your eye. In the garden of Eden it proved that the devil chose the head of man to work in, but God chooses his heart. The devil shows him with his eyes, something that he can see, and he says, "Seeing is believing." But when God comes to a man, He comes to his heart. And He lets him believe things by his heart through faith, that his eyes does not see. For the Scripture says that, "The faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." God working here; Satan working here... So what good does these big schools and seminaries do anyhow? It sometimes, not always, but too many times, it pulls from here, up to here, when it ought to be taken from here, down to here in the man's heart.

L-62 You know, the Scripture says, "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he." The old infidel and critic used to say, "How foolish God was, to say that there was mental faculties in a man's heart, for there's nothing in there to think with." But about four years ago science found out that in the human heart there is a thinking faculty. There is a little room, a little place where there's not even a cell, a little compartment in the human heart. It isn't in the animal or no other life. But in the human heart there is a little place, and they never could come to conclusion what it was, but finally they said this: "It's the place where the soul dwells." So God does speak His Words right, "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he." Not in his head, if God would've meant head, He'd have said, "head." He said, "his heart."

L-66 What if, Moses, when he come up, and Moses... God said, "Take off your shoes, Moses; you're on holy ground." What if Moses said, "Now, wait a minute, Lord, I--I know You meant my hat. I'll just take off my hat; that's more reverent." He never said hat; He said, "shoes." That's what He meant. He never meant shake hands and join the church. He said, "You must be borned again, that from above." Not put your name on a book, but be regenerated, and your soul changed, your entire being made new again.

L-68 Now, when man has--has never had that experience, he's still a son of God in creation, a fallen son of God. That's the reason he can take wood and make buildings; he can take iron and make machinery; he can take jewels and make watches. What can he do? He can take something that's out of the original creation and pervert it from its original stand to make something great, but he cannot create. Only God can create, Him alone.

L-69 And we notice in this then, that Satan, choosing the man's head, he took his intellectual part. And now, the church has begin to move in the intellectual parts of a man. "Oh, it's a great church. We have a great denomination. We're the oldest in the country." But, brother, until that man, or woman, or boy, or girl is thoroughly converted, he'll take them intellectual conceptions and say, "The Bible don't mean this and it don't mean that. The days of miracles has passed. And there is no such a thing as these other things. There... That--that's not right," you say, "and the days is past." Because he's intellectually looking at it. But let that same man take what little knowledge he has in his head and give it over to God, and let the Spirit of the living God come down into that heart of his, he'll call every Word of God the Truth, and every promise, Divine. Then he can achieve for God.

L-71 You see, that little part, compartment in a man's heart, God made that in there for Himself. That's His control room. He sets there to control you. That's His place. That's where He sends His messages from, the control room. How can He work with you when the nature of the spirit of the devil is in there? And every man born on earth is borned in sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the world speaking lies. That's right. So, in that carnal Adamic nature, how can a man achieve anything, only by through his intellectuals? But when he comes to be a new creature, and the old man has passed out, and the new Man, Christ, takes His throne in the human heart, then life looks different; then he starts on a new road from his own selfish motives, till the big ideas to 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min make himself something big, he starts right towards Calvary to recognize God. Then his, all his objective, his motive, his achievement, and all that he is, lays in the glory of the cross, where Christ paid the price for human life. Christ is our Life.

L-74 There's why Jesus said, "Except a man be born again, he can't even understand the Kingdom of God." You can't do it. It's not in you to do it. Then why did God make that little place? He made it so you could be filled in there. You've got to be filled with something. You can't be a human being without being filled. The time has come where you're forced to make a decision, and that's now; because it's forced all over the earth.

L-76 I've heard ministers get up with charts and try to explain what the mark of the beast was by some kind of a chart. It doesn't take a chart. The Scripture says, "All that didn't receive the Seal of God had the mark of the beast." There's only two classes on the earth. One's got the Mark of God, the other one's got the mark of the devil. And all that didn't receive the Mark of God had the mark of the devil. That's what the Scripture said. So you're forced to make a decision. And let me grind it into you, not to be rude or--or mean, but to tell you the truth and warn you. Man's got to do something about it. It's your... It's forced onto you. You must make a decision.

L-78 Then if I can show you by God's Word what the Seal of the living God is, then you'll know. The Bible said, in Ephesians 4:30 once, many places throughout the Scripture, that the Holy Spirit is the Seal of God. Then without the Holy Spirit, you're marked off the other side; no matter how intellectual, how many of the denominations that you belong to, how pious and religious you are, Satan was the same thing. Satan's not some big brute with a forked tail and forked hoofs; he's a spirit, and the Bible said, so cunning that he would deceive the very elected if possible. He's religious. Was not Cain just as religious as Abel was? Did not Cain offer an offering just the same as Abel did? Did not Cain build a church unto the Lord the same as Abel did? Did not Cain get down and worship just the same as Abel did? Did not Cain sacrifice just the same as Abel did? But one come by intellectual conception; he brought the flowers and the fruits of the field and made his altar beautiful: intellectual.

L-81 But Abel, by faith, chose a lamb, for it was blood and life that taken it, and he drug him to a rock and hammered his little throat until he bled to death. God said, "That's righteous Abel." That's right. How did It come to him? By revelation, not by intellectual. Through his heart he knew it. Jesus said, "Upon this rock I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against It": spiritual revelation, spiritual conception. "Man looks upon the outside," says the Scripture, "God looks on the heart."

L-83 You are filled with something. You might be filled with doubt. Your poor hearts may be running over with doubt. I hope not. Your hearts may be full of frets and worry. And it might be that your hearts are full of trouble. And it might be that you're full of religion, intellectual, fine perfumed theology, belonging to the great churches that's been in existence for years, setting back just as confidence as you can be. Brother, let me say to you; you might bring members to that church until you get old and die, and you'll never do nothing but build another tower to Babel. Certainly. You can be full of foolishness; you can be full of nonsense; you can be full of anything; but you can't stay empty. The Bible says you can't.

L-86 The Bible said, "When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he walks in dry places, searching rest. And then he comes back with seven other devils more worse than he was, and the last estate of that man is eight times worse than it was at the beginning." That's what happens to these meetings, when people go forth in revivals and men are just led to an intellectual conception. He goes off and joins some church, and lets it go at that, satisfied. "That's all right. There's nothing to all this other nonsense. We should not have it." The pastor says, "Oh, that's all, that was way back in another age." And the first thing you know, that devil returns back with seven other devils, and he becomes a religious devil. Then he's really filled; then he's got pride and jealousy. And--and he--he's--he's even angry with the very God that wrote the Bible; he looks down there, and say, "'These things that I do, shall you also.' That was for the disciples."

L-88 "Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel," said Jesus, His last commission to the church. "These signs shall 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min follow them that believe." How far? "All the world." Who to? "Every creature." These signs shall follow some of them? The Scripture says, "Shall follow them," all of them that believe. "In My Name they shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. If they shall take up serpents or drink deadly things, it shall not harm them. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover." That's what Jesus said. "These signs shall follow believers," not negative thinkers, not intellectual church members, but borned again believers who's come from the intellectual to the heart where God takes throne in His control room, to control your emotions, to control your faith, to control your character.

L-90 God wants to fill you. Why does He want to fill you? What does He want to fill you with? He wants to fill you with Himself, the Holy Spirit, filled with the Holy Ghost. Jesus said in Luke 24:49, that, "You shall receive power, after this the Holy Ghost is come upon you. Then you'll be witnesses of Me in Jerusalem, Judaea, and Samaria, unto the utmost parts of the earth." When? When you have received your doctor's degree? When you have 'ceived your--received a Bachelor of Art? No. "But when you have received the Holy Ghost, then you'll be witnesses of Me through this generation, the generations that are to come, unto the utmost parts of the earth."

L-92 And on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost came from heaven like a rushing mighty wind, and filled all the house where they were setting, signs and wonders were wrought among them. And the intellectuals said, "Men and brethren, what can we do to be saved?" Peter said, "Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to them that's far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call."

L-95 There's what God wants you filled with. He wants you filled with the Holy Ghost, and then you'll be united, what to? A church? No, sir. You'll be united, what to? A creed? No, sir. You'll be united to God. And you and Him will be one, as He and the Father is One. And God's Holy Spirit will live in you. And the same works that the Holy Spirit performed when It was here in the Christ, Jesus, shall be performed in you, for He said He'd do it. Then we are one. Jesus prayed for that.

L-96 In the prayer tonight, our heavenly Master prayed to the Father that we'd be one as He and God is One. And how close were They? God was the Life and Spirit in Him. And if we are one with Him, we will be, Life and Spirit of Him will be in us. Then earthly, carnal, intellectual conception, and creeds, and dogmas will fade out; and a new, generated, borned again, virgin experience of the baptism of the Holy Spirit will take place in the human heart. Then you'll be one; then brother will really be brother; sister will be sister. Your objectives, and your motives, and all that you are, and all that you ever want to be, or try to be, will be for the Kingdom of God, no matter what church you represent, where you go or what you do.

L-97 There is so many people today who says that the Holy Spirit is not real today. While tens of thousands of them, and millions, are saying it's not so, there's that many enjoying the blessings of It. Mostly are poor people, people who's been dejected and rejected by the world, people who's been throwed out of churches because that they believed God to be God; but they have been filled with His Spirit. They are one in purpose; they're one in heart. Who are those people? Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterian, Catholic, Jehovah Witness, orthodox Jew, all together, they become one. Not one to a creed, not one to a denomination, that's the working of the devil through intellectual conceptions, but the working of the Holy Spirit, the Kingdom of God in you. And God sets on the throne of your heart in His control room, controlling your emotions, and controlling your powers, controlling your conceptions, and making you one with Him in fellowship and in love. And God fills you with love. He fills you with power. He fills you with the Spirit. He fills you with His own Divine Nature, and He changes your carnal nature into His Nature. Then, in this, you become a new creation in Christ.

L-100 Then the love, you go out and seemingly the birds sing different. Oh, how different it is when Christ comes, how you can look back and think, "How did I ever stay away from it? How did I ever reject it?" Everything's different. You have no enemies; they all look sweet. You can forgive everything that's ever been done. The bitterest of enemy, you 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min could pray for him on the street, put your arm around him and lift him up; no matter what creed, what denomination he belongs to, he's a creature who Christ died for. That's what God wants you filled with. That's the filling. That's the Kingdom. That's what we're one in.

L-101 We're one then, not to--not to further a denomination, not to further a cult, or--or some creed. We're one to further the Kingdom of God. Then we take His Blueprint, and every time the blessed Bible says anything, the Holy Spirit in you cries out, "It's so; It's My Word." You don't say, "Did Doctor Jones say? What about this? Or, did Doctor So-and-so?" It makes no difference what doctor said so. Jesus said It's the Truth. "And heavens and earth will pass away, but My Words shall never pass away." That's when we are one.

L-104 All you Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterian, who all--whoever you are, we're one. Don't let the devil use your eye. Let God use your heart. If you look and try to understand what it is, what makes it, "How does it come that way?" You don't question That when you receive the Holy Spirit. If you're still questioning the Word of God, it shows that God's not in your heart. The Holy Spirit doesn't question one thing God says. It says, "Amen and amen. It's so, 'cause God said so."

L-105 Abraham called those things which were not as though they were, because God said so. God told him, at seventy-five years old and Sarah at sixty-five, they was going to have a baby. Why, it was ridiculous to think so. But God said so, and Abraham was a son of God. And he walked twenty-five years, calling everything... Every day, "Sarah," he'd say, "how are you, dear?" "Don't feel any difference than I ever did." She was forty years past menopause: never had children, when she was living with him when she was seventeen years old. But he believed God, and called everything contrary to it as though it wasn't, and he called God's Word the Truth. First month passed. "How you feel, Sarah?" "No different." "Well," he says, "praise God, we'll have the baby anyhow." A year passed. "How do you feel?" "No different." "But we'll have it anyhow." And the Bible said, "Instead of getting weaker, he got stronger all the time." It'd be more of a miracle. God said so; it has to happen.

L-108 Twenty-five years, and now she's ninety and he's a hundred. One day an Angel come down, had His back turned to the tent, and He said, "Abraham, I'm going to visit you," and He told Abraham what was going to happen, and little Isaac was born. Why? "Because Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong, giving praise to God." Why? It wasn't in his mind; it was in his heart.

L-110 God's throne is in the human heart. There we become one, one in purpose, one in achievement. If the Methodist brother wins a hundred souls to God, "Amen and amen." If the Presbyterian, whatever he might be, wins a soul to Christ, "Amen and amen." If Tommy Osborn wins a million souls this year, and Oral Roberts a million souls, and Billy Graham a million souls, and every other denomination a million souls, I can stand and praise the living God. Because that's what we're achieving, the Kingdom of God, that's where our objective is to do, to send souls to Him. They're borned again Christians. That's when we're one. We're united together. We're brethren. And not as long as you say, "Well, they're not Methodists, they're not Baptists, they're not this, that, or the other," then your--your whole motive is wrong, and your objective, and all you achieve is wrong; when you're trying to do something within yourself to make it look big, when you're little. Remember.

L-112 Did you ever notice wheat growing? If you see wheat stand up and just shaking itself like that, remember, there's no head in it. It's empty. A full head always bows. And a man that's full, and filled with God's goodness and His mercy, He bows his head in humility. "He that will humble himself, God will exalt. He that exalts himself, shall be made abased." 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min Friends, it's time that men and women woke up to the facts, that we want to be one. Jesus prayed that we might be one, just as God and Him were One. And God was in Him. And we are One with Christ if we let Christ come in. But it's the only way we can do, is to let Him take the control room in our heart, then we become One.

L-114 We're facing Christmas. We're facing times. We're facing a horrible things. All this that we're facing, what difference does it make what comes or goes, as long as Christ is in the control room, controlling us, controlling us and giving us faith to believe things that we cannot see? God said we... "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." You believe it, for God is in your heart, and telling you that His Word's right. And no Spirit will--of God, will ever deny anything of God's Word. The Spirit of God will recognize His Own. Oh, how happy I am to know that there is a God Who is real.

L-116 Sometime ago there was a... Up here in Indiana there was two boys that was raised out on a farm. And they were just as poor as poor could be, farmer boys. And they grew up together. And one day one of them got married. And a few days afterwards, the other one got married. And one of them went into the city to live. And he had begin to play the stock markets, got away from his childhood teachings, went into the wrong thing. And he played them, and he got richer and richer, till finally he become a multimillionaire. And he moved up into Chicago, and got on one of the great streets and built himself a palace. Him and his wife run to nightclubs, and they drank cocktails, and they laid out all night. They had butlers and everything to furnish them anything that they wanted. And they thought they were really living.

L-118 But a man that lives like that has no peace. There is no peace to a troubled heart. To a sinful heart, there cannot be peace. If a man longs to drink, and he calls that life, he thinks he is having a big time, it shows his emptiness. Take a man, make a million dollars, he wants two. Take a man that goes to a party and drinks one drink tonight, he wants another. Take a man, lives untrue to his wife once, he'll live it again; vice versa. See, it's something, and he never's satisfied. He might have a million dollars in his hands or ten million in his hand; he lays down at night with a drunken stew on him; he wakes up the next morning, haunted, nightmares, troubled mind. And you call that peace? That's no peace. But a man might not even have a pillow to press his head to; he might not even own a decent pair of shoes, or able to have a decent meal in his house; but if God reigns in his heart, he goes to bed happy and wakes up happy. It's a lasting peace. It's something that God does.

L-120 This fellow had forgot that teaching. He went to gambling. It come Christmas time. He thought of his buddy, so he wrote him a letter. One of them's name was Jim, the rich man. And John was the poor one. And he wrote him a letter, and he said, "John, I wish you'd come up to see me through the holidays. I'd like to meet you, talk with you again. I haven't seen you for many years." And wrote him back, and said, "I'd like to come, Jim. But I can't come; I haven't got the money to come." A check come in the mail in a few days, said, "Come on. I want you to come anyhow." So John got ready, country boy, put on a good clean pair of overalls, and his kady hat, and his little coat of a different color, and boarded the train.

L-123 And when he got there, there was a chauffeur setting there to meet him with a big limousine. He didn't know how to act. He got in this limousine, holding his hat in his hand, looking around, drove up to a great palace in Chicago. Got out and went up to the door, and rung the bell. And out come a butler, said, "Your card, please, sir." He didn't know what he was talking to. He handed him his hat. He was... He didn't know nothing about no reception card. He didn't have much of this world's goods. He said, "I want your card." He said, "I don't know what you're talking about, sir." Said, "Jim sent for me to come; that's all I know."

L-126 So he went back and told his partner, who hadn't got out of bed yet. He said, "There is a funny-looking man standing at the door." He's dressed... I never seen a man dressed like him. And he said Jim sent him." He said, "Tell him to come on in." And he slipped on his bathrobe, went down the hall and met this old country friend of his, and shook his hand. Said, "John, you don't know how glad I am to see you." And the old country fellow standing, looking around in the room, said, "Jim, you sure have got plenty." 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min He said, "I want to show you around." He took him upstairs, and out on the sun porch, opened up the window. Said, "Where is Martha?" "Oh," said, "she hasn't come in yet; she was out last night." Said, "How--how you all getting along?" Said, "Oh, not much. John, how are you and Katie getting along?" Said, "Just fine." Said, "Oh, is she home?" Said, "Yes, we got seven kids." Said, "You all got any children?" Said, "No, Martha wouldn't have any." Said, "She thought we'd better not have any children; it interferes with the social life. You know," raised back the curtains, he said, "looky here." Said, "You see that bank over yonder?" He said, "Yes." Said, "I'm the president in that bank." Said, "You see that railroad company?" "Yes." Said, "I've got a million dollars worth of shares in that."

L-134 And he looked down there, and he seen the great gardens and everything, how beautiful it looked. And old John stood there with his straw hat in his hand, looking around. He said, "That's fine, Jim. I sure thankful that you've got it." Said, "Me and Katie ain't got much." Said, "We still live in that little old split-shingled house down there." And said, "We don't have very much, but we're awful happy." Just then a bunch of carol singers, their voices begin to come in. Silent night, holy night, All is calm, and all is bright Around young virgin mother and Child, Holy Infant so tender and mild.

L-136 Jim turned and looked at John; John looked up to Jim. Said, "John, I want to ask you something." Said, "You remember when we was boys, and we used to go to that little old red church down there on the side of the road, and we'd hear them old country choirs sing them songs?" Said, "Yes." Said, "You still go down there?" Said, "Yes, I still belong there." Said, "I'm a deacon down there now." Said, "What about you, Jim?" Said, "You was talking about how much you own down here." And said, "How much do you own up this way?" "John, I'm sorry." Said, "I don't own nothing up that way." He said, "You remember just before Christmas one year, we didn't have any shoes?" And said, "We was more interested in getting some firecrackers for Christmas." And said, "We went out and set some box traps to catch some rabbits to get some firecrackers for Christmas." Said, "You remember that morning that big old wood's rabbit was in that box trap of yours?" John said, "Yes, I remember it." "You'd get some firecrackers; and you went and got some, divided them with me." He said, "Yes."

L-140 Said, "John, I'll divide anything I got with you. But one thing I wish you could divide to me." Said, "I'd give everything I own, if I could walk that little old dusty road, bare-footed, up to that little old church again, and feel that Presence of the living God, when that choir was singing, the old fashion country preacher was preaching." Said, "I'd give anything. I'd give all that I own, every share in the railroad, and all the parts of the bank, and this home, and all, if I could turn back again and have that blessed peace that I had when I went up that old road." Old John took and put his arms around him; he said, "There was three wise men, rich men who came and laid it all at the feet of Jesus one time, as a Baby," and said, "they received pardoning of their sins." He said, "I'd, although I'd... I think that you are wonderful, Jim, in what you've been blessed to do all these things. But I'd rather have my wife and seven children, living down there on straw ticks to sleep on, and have the peace that's in my heart, than to have all your 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min riches, Jim, that you could have."

L-142 And that's right, friends. Riches is not measured out by dollars. Riches is not measured out by big names and popularity. Riches is when the Kingdom of God has come into the human heart, changed his emotions, and made him a new creature in Christ Jesus, and give him Eternal Life. That's the richest thing on earth. Let us pray. And while our heads is bowed. Are you poor tonight in this world's goods? You don't even know how you're going to pay the coal bill or the oil bill, or whatevermore? You may be that way; I hope you're not. But if it's so that you are that way, you can leave this building tonight the happiest poor man there is on the earth. You can live here with--leave here tonight with riches that no money could ever buy. You can unite your heart with Christ Jesus, and He can come into your soul and take the control room. And no matter what comes or goes, you'll be happy the rest of your days. Would...

L-144 It's the greatest present that was ever give. Oh, of course, you give your friends Christmas presents. That's good. That's tokens. But, brother, there's a Present offered you tonight that no money could ever buy. It's a free gift come from God: His only begotten Son Jesus Christ. Would you receive Him as your personal Guider, as your personal Saviour, as your God, as your--as your Redeemer, as your King? He heals the soul and the body. He takes the control room. If you got fears and doubts, just let it go now. Let Him be King. Let Him come in and take over. Let Him be Lord. "Lord" is "Ruler." Lordship is rulership.

L-145 You say, "Oh, I--I believe I opened my heart to Him years ago." But has He ever become your Lord, completely control, to control your emotions, your faith and all? When you read the Bible, every Word of It's the Truth. When peace... And flusterations come, you've got peace in your heart, knowing if the atomic bomb should scatter this earth into bits tonight, you would be gathered in Christ Jesus in glory before the ashes ever settled to the earth. Have you that consolation? If you have not, and would like to have it, would you just quickly and silently raise up your hands, and by doing so, say, "Lord, be merciful to me. I now want to be united with You as one of Your children in the Kingdom of God, in my motives, my objectives. You know all about me. Take me, Lord, just as I am, and let me become Yours"? God bless you, son. God bless you, sir. And God bless you and you, and you, brother; and you, you, you there. And you, lady, God bless you. That's right.

L-147 I know the old fashion type of the Methodist church and so forth, believes in coming to the altar, and so forth. That's all right. Brother, you can't raise your hand to God; you can't even make a move towards that unless God touches you. Jesus said, "No man can come to Me except the Father draws him first." Won't you honor and respect that which has made you raise your hand, say, "Yes, Lord, I mean that from my heart. And every sin that I have, I lay now on Your altar. I consecrate myself to You, just now, Lord, that from this hour on I'll live for You. And all my habits, and all my sins, and all, I forsake right here, emptying out my heart. You be the Principal of my heart. You be the Lord of my heart. Take Your rightful place in my life, Lord, and control me." Mean that now, while we pray.

L-149 Lord, I have learned in Thy Word, that it is written, that, "No man can come to Me except My Father draws him first. And all that the Father has given Me, will come to Me." Man may live ten years, twenty, fifty, or seventy-five years, or even more, and yet has never come. But there'll come a time that when the Light will flash across his path, and that's the opportunity. How thankful we are that there is still--there is still a God Who loves people. And tonight He's displayed His mercy to us, by letting many hands be raised up to accept Jesus as this, God's great Christmas Gift, the original and the only real true God-sent Christmas Gift, is His only begotten Son, to the earth. Receive them, Lord. There'll come a day that when they'll press a dying pillow; or groaning on the road under an automobile; or maybe gurgling in their throats from drowning in a water. I do not know what their destination will be. But, Lord, I know this, that Jesus said these Words, "He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live, and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die." I believe that to be Your Word, Lord. Whether I live or die, It's still Your Word, for You have spoke It. And all heavens and earth will pass away, but Your Word shall never fail.

L-151 You said, "He that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast out. I'll give him Everlasting Life, and will raise him up at the last days." Though he drowns in the sea, though he burns in the fire, though his ashes are blowed to the four winds of the earth, "The Lord God shall descend from heaven with the voice of the archangel, and the trumpet of God, and 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min the dead in Christ shall rise first. We shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air, and forever be with Him." Lord God, we believe that that'll take place. And on these poor, rejected people of the earth, that's come in here tonight and bowed their heads towards the dust where You've taken them from, and where they will return if You tarry, they've raised their hand, their hand to You, and said, "Lord, I'm wrong. Receive me." Oh, how would You turn one down? You could not; You could not do it, Lord. If they meant that from the depths of their heart, You could not do it and remain God, because they've come sincerely. They are a love gift that the Father is giving You.

L-153 Now, as Your servant, I commend them to Thee, and commit their souls, and their bodies, and their spirits unto Thee. Hold them in Thy blessed keeping, Lord. Take all the evil out of them. Take the sin; take the habits; and may it never bother them from this night on. May they go from here, free people, with God in their hearts in the control room. And when the enemy shall tempt them, let them remember God's in the control room, and He's the One Who turns their heads from the enemy. And we'll establish Thy Kingdom, Lord. "And Thy Kingdom come. Thine will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. And lead us not into temptation, Lord, but deliver us from the evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever." Amen.

L-155 So it--it is written, so let it be done. Everyone who raised their hands and believed that the Lord Jesus Christ, accepting Him as Your Saviour, take Him from your heart by faith. Not what your eyes tell you, what your mind thinks, you, "I can't quit it. I can't do it. I can't stop doing this"; that's intellectual. But Something down in your heart, says, "And you are My property." Remember, listen to what your voice in the heart says, 'cause it's God speaking to you. All other things will fade just like--like the night has to fade. Which is the strongest, the night or the day? Let the sun rise, and see what happens to the night; it just fades and can be no more.

L-157 And when--when the Spirit of God comes into a man's heart, all of his intellectuals just fade, and the darkness and doubts just goes away. And you can't find it any more, 'cause there's no room for it. Light has filled his soul. He walks in the Light. He is in the Light. He's a child of God, and God loves him. Now I'd like to sing a hymn, all of us, together. I'm a child of the King! A child of the King! With Jesus my Saviour, I'm the child of a King! How many feels that way now, raise up your hand, "I'm the child of a King"? You that had your hands up awhile ago, put them up. Believe it. Stay with it. God knows your heart.

L-159 Come, pastor, let's... I can't lead songs, but let's sing that song. You help me, will you? All of you together now, all right, as we sing this. All right. I believe our sister is coming over to--to give us the chord on the music. I looked around; I didn't see her anywhere, and that's the reason I said that. How many knows, "My Father is rich with houses and lands, He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hand"? Just think of how beautiful that is. All right, everyone now together. My Father is rich in houses and land, He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hand! Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold, His coffers are full, He has riches untold. Now, real quietly now. I'm the child of the King! A child of the King! With Jesus my Saviour, I'm the child of the King! 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min

L-161 That wonderful? You believe you're a child of the King? Raise your hand, all who believes that you're children of the King. All right. Now, while we sing that again, I want you to shake hands with somebody behind you, someone in front of you, someone to the right and left, no matter what they are, what belief you have, if you're a child of the King, while we sing it again. I'm a child of the King! A child of the King! With Jesus my Saviour, I'm the child of the King! A tent or a cottage, why should I care? They're building a palace for me over There! Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold, His coffers are full, He has riches untold. I'm a child of the King! A child of the King! With Jesus my Saviour, I'm a child of the King! To be like Jesus, to be like Jesus, On earth I long to be like Him; All through life's journey from earth to Glory I only ask to be like Him.

L-162 Is that your desire? He's so wonderful. I love Him with all that is within me. I surrendered everything I had twenty-eight years ago to the Lord Jesus. Since then I've been on the battlefield, doing all that I know how to lead men and women to look to that crown of glory. You go to speaking about the coming of the Lord, people said... A man said to me not long ago, "Oh, preacher, don't talk like that." I said, "Are you a Christian?" "Yes, but, my, we got a lot to do yet." I said, "The happiest thing I can think of is the coming of the Lord."

L-165 Paul said at the end of the road, "I have fought a good fight, I have finished the course; I've kept the faith. And henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day, not only me, but all those who love His appearing." How... What could I trade? What have I got to, for I'm getting old. This old, frail, sickly body that's full of corruption will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye. I'll be young forever. I'll never have a sick spell again. I'll never cry a tear. I'll never, never get old. I'll never die. I'll never be sick. I'll never have a heartache or a worry. But I'll have a body like His Own glorious body. If I... If that ain't something to live for, if that isn't the greatest thing that I know... How do I get it? It's a free gift. God knocks, and I say, "Yeah, Lord, You are my Creator. I accept You." He seals me in with the Holy Spirit into Him, then I see nothing but Jesus and His Blood. What can wash away my sin? Nothing but the Blood of Jesus; What can make me whole again? Nothing but the Blood of Jesus. Oh, precious is the flow That makes me white as snow; No other fount I know, Nothing but the Blood of Jesus.

L-168 Aren't you happy? I know no creed can do it. I know no denominations can do it. I know no church can do it. I 58-1221E, The Unity Of One God In The One Church, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 83 min know no man can do it. I know no water can do it. I know no theology can do it. Nothing but the Blood of Jesus. My hopes is built on nothing less Than Jesus' Blood with righteousness; When all around my soul gives away, Then He's all my hope and stay. (Is that you?) For on Christ, the solid Rocks, we stand; All other grounds is sinking sands, All other grounds is sinking sand. God bless you now. I believe there's a dedication of a baby, I believe so, at this time. I'll turn the service to the pastor, for this. Come right ahead, Brother Neville. The Lord bless you.
