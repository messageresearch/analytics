--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Praise the Lord. Sure you all enjoyed that like I did, it was immense enjoyed. He is the mighty Conqueror. I'm sure my wife appreciated that tonight, because that's her favorite song and solo, "The mighty Conqueror," since He rent the veil in two. Now, it's... Brother Ekberg was just telling me we have a visitor all the way from Stockholm tonight. So I don't know the brother right off, but we are very happy that he's here, along with the rest of you visitors, with our little meeting. Now, brother from Stockholm, these people here are--are used to a lot of sunshine. And just a little cool weather is kind of hard on them. Of course, we Eskimos, up there, we... This would be our summertime. So we'd just be having a good time in this.

L-2 Up in the north lands, when we have services up there sometimes, the people drive thirty-five and forty miles over icy roads, and blankets around them and everything, looked like they just enjoy that cold weather. But when your blood gets a little thin, you know, it's kinda hard, I guess. So then coming down here with thick blood, then hot weather nearly kills you. So... and... But you got a beautiful country here, and we're very happy to be visiting with you. Now, tomorrow night, I believe when I was just drove up outside, that I heard them announcing Brother Waermo and Brother Ekberg was going to have a group of specials tomorrow night. Hope I can get here a little early myself to get to hear those marvelous songs. I'm just so happy to get them. And I--I love them so well, because God is in music. God, I think wonderfully...

L-3 You know I've got a--a radio at home, that I just wouldn't take anything for it. And when I can get a little time off and get out in the yard, and the Lord turns it on, why, I--I tell you it's wonderful. And--and you know, when I go out a fishing, out in the wilderness, I--I find my radio out there. God turns it on out there. You know what it is? Birds singing. Out here... You...?... I live on mockingbird hill, where all the mockingbirds are up there. And all night long you hear them. They'll fly up in the air, and fly back down, and just sing and sing. Many of them call them nightingales. I studied them a whole lot. And I often wonder why it is that they sing so much. And the nightingale sets with his eyes upward. They'll be a real st--stormy night, and when the clouds come back, as long as he can see one star shining, he will start singing just as loud as he can. Because he knows the sun's a shining somewhere; it's daylight.

L-4 And I've often thought, teaching many times, preaching, and nature, how I love nature, 'cause that was my first Bible. Now, that's the way we are. As long as you can see somebody getting saved and coming to Christ, you know Christ is still in the business somewhere. So if somebody being healed, or some sign that out Lord Jesus is still--the doors of mercies is still open. So we ought to raise our heads back and sing to the glory of God, when we can see that one visible sign. You like to look at God in nature? I just love to watch Him in nature. Now, before we start tonight, or read the Scripture, there's some letters and handkerchiefs here with names on them. And we're very happy to pray over these handkerchiefs, and to send--let the needy come get them. And if you happen to fail to miss yours, why, see some of them, and then you can write me. (All right. Thank you, brother.) You can write me, and I'll--I'll be glad to send you one from home, or a little--little piece of cloth, what it is, is what we really have.

L-5 And you know, in the Bible--in the Bible we have a case where Saint Paul took the handkerchiefs off of the--off of his body, handkerchiefs, and aprons, and so forth, and sent them to the sick, and the afflicted. Now, as I said the other night, many people anoint them. You know where I think Paul... He was a fundamentalist, you know, so you know where I think Paul got that from the Bible? How many would like to hear where I think Paul got it? All right, I'll tell you where. When the Shunammite woman... There was a prophet used to come by her house all the time by the name of Elijah. And she would entertain this prophet and his servant Gehazi. Gehazi was with him to keep the people away from him, and so forth, and to help him. And so she said to her husband, "Let's build a little house on the--little room on the side 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min of the house. And she put a candle there, and a bed, and oh, little buckets of water, and whatmore that the little room needed.

L-6 And he said, "Go ask her what I could do for her, speak to the king or something or another." And she said, "No." She didn't care for that. So he said, "Well, what's wrong?" And she said, "Well," the... Gehazi said, "She don't have any children." So Elijah got a vision from the Lord, and told her just about the time that it was going to happen. And so the baby was born. And when he got about twelve years old, why, he was out in the field one day with his daddy. And I believe he must've got sun-stroked or something. He said, "My head, my head," about eleven o'clock out in the harvest field. So his father had him packed to the house, set on the lap of his mother. And while he was on her lap... It was a faithful woman, a Shunammite. And she... The baby died, the little boy.

L-7 And I want you to watch that woman. She took him right straight up in the bed, where that prophet had been laying, and laid him on the bed. Now, read between the lines just a little, and you will get what Paul was thinking about. Laid him on the prophet's bed, what an appropriate place to lay him, on the--on the bed--on the--the dead baby on the prophet's bed. And she said to the servant, "Saddle me a mule, and go forward, and don't you stop 'less I bid you, and go to the prophet." They said, "Why, he won't be up there." Said, "This will be all right."

L-8 And now, notice this, when she got close to him (the prophet), the prophet didn't know what was going to happen. God hadn't revealed it to him. They don't know all things; it's just as God will reveal. See? It doesn't... Like the woman touched Jesus' garment, He didn't know who it was. God has to do those things. So he said, "Here comes that Shunammite," and said, "she's worried; she's troubled, and God's kept it from me. I don't know what's wrong with her." And so, when she got close. He said, "Is all well with thee, is all well with thy husband, is all well with the baby?" Now, you women listen to this, just a minute. She said, "All is well." Think of it. (Thank you, sweetheart, you're a mighty, fine, little girl. God bless you, honey.) "All is well."

L-9 Why? She wanted to get to God's representative, which was the prophet, and God was in Christ, we know, or in Christ, and He was... Before Christ come, He was representing Himself in the prophets. And now today, He's representing Himself in the Church. Isn't that right? Representing Himself in the Church... And so, he said, "All is well." (Thank you.) She was... she was before the prophet. "All is well."

L-10 Now, watch. And then she begin to reveal to him what had happened. The baby's dead. Her husband's broken-hearted, and she is, but all is well. Could you think that tonight? Knowing that Jesus Christ will pass through these lines tonight, and heal a portion of people that's in here, and perhaps these people here, on these ambulance stretchers here, will probably be up on their feet walking around after while, going out of here rejoicing... What do you think about it tonight? Is all is well? I see a little boy sitting there, bless his little heart, I hope this is his night, and over here, too, this little laddie. I don't know, they're both in little wheelchairs, and I... Here's a lady setting here in a wheelchair. And I--I just hope that this is the night for every one of you. But is all well? Everything's okay now. See? All is well. She's before God's representative. And then, when he told her what was the matter... Now, look what Elisha done. He told Gehazi, "Take this staff," the staff is what he had been handling, said, "take this staff and go lay it on the baby."

L-11 Now, Elijah knew that everything that he touched was blessed. Now, the woman, if he could get her to believe the 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min same thing, all right. But the woman didn't believe that. She knew God was in His servant; she didn't know about no staff; but--but she--she knew about him. She said, "I'm not going to leave you." And so, but I think that's where Paul got laying, taking handkerchiefs off his body. The people seen and knew that God was with Paul, and whatever he touched was blessed. And so I think that's where Paul got laying handkerchiefs on the sick, 'cause Elijah sent a staff that he had handled and laid it on a dead child. So I think that's where Paul got it. However, it was a token to the people that they believe that He has represented Himself here on earth in the form of the Lord Jesus. And Lord Jesus has returned to heaven, and come again in the form of the Holy Spirit, and He's here, working in His Church. And that's why we're going to pray over these just now while we bow our heads.

L-12 Our heavenly Father, first we want to express to You our gratitude, because that we can call You our father, and know assure that Thou art. Just to know the many false religions in the world tonight, worshipping idols, worshipping the fleas, and flies, sacred cows, Buddha, Mohammedan. Oh, at the thousands of idols, but yet there's one true and living God. All their founders and philosophers died, was placed into the grave, and that settled it. But our blessed, heavenly Father sent His Son, that said, "I have power to lay My Life down, and take it up again," and He proved it. And here He is after two thousand years, still moving among the people as He did here on earth, as He moves in His Church.

L-13 A Church, two thousand years ago, when they seen their pastor, the Saint Paul, that You were speaking through him and revealing and ministering, they taken from his body handkerchiefs and aprons, and You honored it; and unclean spirits went out of the people and they were healed. Now, Father, Your beloved servant, the great apostle and saint, has come home to You many a hundreds of years ago, but Thou remaineth forever. And tonight these people who has confidence in Thee, and is wanting Your humble servant to pray a prayer for them, by the means of these handkerchiefs I lay my hands over them in commemoration of Your Word, and ask that every one be healed.

L-14 God, You know what they all mean. You watched them when they was writing these notes. You even knowed when the material was cut out, what it was going to be used for. And here it is tonight, laying here. May it find its destination, and when it's laid upon the sick, may every power of sickness and affliction move from the bodies of the dear people who's suffering. Almighty God, liberate them and they go free. Grant it, Father. Now, bless us in the reading of the Word tonight and speaking. Heal all the sick and afflicted, and save the lost, and call back the ones who were wayward, and gone away from Thee. For we ask it in Jesus' Name, Thy beloved Son. Amen. The brother pastor here says you can get the handkerchiefs immediately after the altar call tonight. He will have them for you. And thank you very much, and may the Lord grant that each and every one of these, where they're represented, when they find their resting place to who they're determined to go, may God grant that every one be healed.

L-15 Now, I wish to--to read again tonight for just a few moments... So I finally did dismiss just five minutes late last night. I'm getting better. My folks told me that I was just a little bit shorter on it last night, and the people got in a little earlier. Now, for tomorrow morning, I speak at seven o'clock or seven fifteen at the Christian Business Men, at Glendale. I think that's kind of a closed meeting to business men and their wives, I don't know. And then, Saturday morning, at the Full Gospel Business Men's at Los Angeles, at the Clifton's Cafeteria... The program will be on the air. The Christian Business Men, very fine brethren who sponsor my meetings, many, many places, I find them to be very fine group of men.

L-16 And if there's any business men in here tonight that's Christians, I'm sure if they got a chapter in your neighborhood or somewhere, I trust that God will send you to them and join up with this fine bunch of Spirit-filled brethren, for they are fine men. And this other group also down here, I think the--the one in Los Angeles is full Gospel. This down here is mainly Methodists, Baptists, and so forth only. I... Some full Gospel people were there, or Pentecostal, which is the full Gospel 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min too. And we ever... We sure find a bunch of fine men everywhere we go. Anywhere you find Christians, no matter what nation they're in, they're real, real, genuine people.

L-17 I stood sometime ago... Just to show you, brethren... You know I think today... I was hearing the news coming that Mr. Malenkov, or ever what his name is, up in Russia, oh, they couldn't get any settlement, and fussing about Germany, and whether they're going to unite it or not. You know the thing of it is, you're leaving off the main Person in these meetings, the Lord Jesus. He died that all men might be brothers. When I went up there in Finland... Maybe the Swedish brother here tonight remembers the incidence, when here in America, saw a vision of a boy being raised from the dead. Many of you know of it. And the little boy was found laying just exactly where the vision said, that he'd be just the same looking child. Many of you knew about it, and maybe...?... even heard me tell it a year or two before it ever happened, told just how it would... Is there anybody here that had that written in their Bi... Yeah, look at the hands, sure. Told them how it would happen and all about it, 'cause it's... Every time, it's word by word the way He says it. And when that little lad was raised up from the dead, when the states man there signed a notary seal to it, and so forth, his own name that he was witness to it when it happened.

L-18 That night when they taken me down to the place where I was to speak, for a over six city blocks you couldn't even get in by car. And little Finnish soldiers, little boys hadn't even shaved yet, just little smooth-faced boys, not over sixteen years old, and them big boots and long coats... They killed all the soldiers off. The only army they had was just kiddies coming on. And they taken me down there that night, and there stood Russian soldiers on the street with that Russian salute, tears running down their cheeks. And they'd take a hold of those Finns, when they'd get around the place, and put their arms around them, and hug them and kiss them. Brother, anything that'll make a Finn kiss a Russian, or a Russian a Finn, will settle wars forever.

L-19 It takes the Blood of the Lord Jesus. And those communist, antireligious, they were standing there, and they'd... Some of the brethren would ask them, "What do you think about that?" Said, "We'll accept a God like that that's got power sure. We're ready to--to confess to such as that, but not all this joining churches and laying up all the wealth of the nation, laying up in a church somewhere, and live no different from the rest of the people." I don't blame them much myself. That's right. Yes, sir. If He's God, He's God. If He isn't, why He isn't. You're either right or wrong, all things. Now, over in the Scriptures we read tonight from Genesis 22, to continue our story. How we like to read about Abraham. Isn't it marvelous? I just love to read about him. And now, in the 22nd chapter, and the 7th and 8th verse, and then for a text out of the 14th verse: 7 and 8, of 22, Genesis 22 we read this: And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here I--here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for the burnt offering? And Abraham said, My son, God will provide Himself a lamb for the burnt-offering: so they went both of them together. Now, the 14th verse: And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen. The Lord add His blessings to the reading of His Word.

L-20 Jehovah-jireh, the Lord will provide for Himself a sacrifice. Now, Jehovah, in the Old Testament appears to the human race in a seven compound relative Names that He was going to be to the people. He appeared first as Jehovah-jireh, "the Lord will provide a sacrifice." Second, He appeared as Jehovah-rapha, "the Lord that healeth thee," Jehovah-manasses, Jehovah, our banner, Jehovah... seven compound redemptive names that God appears to the human race, as of the all-sufficient Provider for every thing that we have need of from the beginning to the end. Now, last night we were speaking on Abraham, and we left him where God appeared to him in the Name of Almighty God. And in the Hebrew word was used the "El Shaddai," which means "the breast, or the--or the breasted One, the 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min all-sufficient One, the strong One, the Life-giver." And we give the illustration last night as the breasted--breasted One.

L-21 Now, the compound word, the--the word "breasted," like... How could we ever take Jehovah-jireh out of the Bible, or Jehovah-rapha, the Healer, and accept Jehovah-jireh, the Lord's provided sacrifice? And in all these compound names, they were every one met in Jesus Christ. He was Jehovah-jireh, the provided Sacrifice, He was Jehovah-rapha, the Healer, He was Jehovah, the Banner, Jehovah, the Buckler, Jehovah, the Peace, Jehovah, the Shepherd. All those compound redemptive names was applied to the Lord Jesus. You couldn't apply one and take the other one away. And if they was not applied, He was not Jesus, the Son of God. There you are. They're inseparable, you can't--you can't separate God's compound names. And if one of them was applied to Jesus, all of them was applied to Jesus. So if He's God's provided Sacrifice for sin, He's God's provided Atonement for healing, the same yesterday, today, and forever. When He was here on earth, He said, "As Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness, so must the son of man be lifted up," for the same reasons.

L-22 Moses lifted up the brass serpent for a compound reason. Why? Because the people were backslidden, chiding against God, and against Moses. And the... Moses lifted up the brass serpent for their forgiveness of sin and the healing of their body. And just as the brass serpent represented Christ, He was lifted up for the forgiveness of our sins and the healing of our body. He appeared to Abraham as Jehovah-jireh, Jehovah-rapha. He appeared to him here as El Shaddai. Oh, I... We could take each one of those and stay here six months and never get out of it, just taking it from Genesis to Revelations, right back and forth. I love the Word. The Word of God, It's established. We may hear a lot of false fandangos, and a lot of things that isn't true, and made up, but that Word is everlasting, it's God's eternal promise.

L-23 And remember, you can mark me down on the paper of time, and put it in the history when I'm passed on, that when I appear at the judgment bar, I say this, that every Divine promise of God in the Bible is true. And if you'll take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God it'll bring it to pass. Remember, don't forget it. If you, personally, you, can take the right mental attitude towards any of those Divine promises, it'll bring it to pass. It's... Now, if you don't... Fellow met me here not long ago and said, "Oh, Brother Branham, I don't care what you'd say, I don't believe in Divine healing." I said, "It's not for you." He said, "Why?" I said, "You're an unbeliever. It's only to those who believe. That's the only one who can receive it, is believers, not to unbelievers. It's just to those who believe."

L-24 And so that's the way God deals, only with believers. And Abraham was God's called out, elected servant and prophet. And God met him and kept encouraging him as he waited for the fulfilling of the promise. Say, "I wished He'd do that to me." That's why you're here tonight. That's the reason these people are laying here on these stretchers tonight, these parents has brought these little children. Something in them, they heard others being made well. Here they come. What is it? It's the same thing: God encouraging you on, believe.

L-25 So He appears to Abraham in the name of the El Shaddai, the breasted God: one, physical healing, the other spiritual healing. Whatever you have need of, just take it from God. Two resources, two places that... And notice, like a mother with her little baby (as I said), when it's gentle, and it's sick, and the poor little fellow's all upset and lost a lot of weight, but the mother takes the baby to her bosom and she rocks it. And as it's a getting well, it's nursing from the mother, bringing her strength into the baby. And that's the way it is tonight madam, and sir, you all along here, all of you sick. When you accept God's promise being your personal property (Here it is.), then you'll lean on His bosom, and you're nursing every day, strength. Where the cancer once eat you up, where TB has withered you away, where the affliction has caught you, Satan's been into your house and crippled you and left you that way from a fever or something, but each day you're leaning on His everlasting arms, with your head upon His bosom, nursing from the Word (Hallelujah.), nursing from the Word. 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min And notice, not only that, but the baby who's fretting and upset, while it's a nursing, way before it's well, it's satisfied while it's a nursing.

L-26 And every believer, "Every man that cometh to God must believe that He is, and a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him." And every believer coming to God when He accepts God's provided way, His Sacrifice, as he leans upon the bosom of God to trust for his healing, salvation, whatever it may be, he's satisfied. He don't jump about from pillar to post, not tossed about by every wind of doctrine, but he's satisfied. "God gave the promise. I've accepted it; that settles it, so I'm satisfied just right here." Oh, what a... I've had experience with that, friend. When Mayo's clinic told me in the great break, he said, "You can..." Setting in that council of doctors, they said, "Reverend, you can never be well," said, "you're got a 'gurgitation, your nerves carrying one way, and your blood flying the other." Said, "You can't never--never be well," said, "because it lays within another realm, and we can't get into that realm." My heart started failing me. I said, "You mean I'm washed up?" He said, "That's just exactly." That old doctor setting there with his arms crossed, twitching his mustache, about twenty doctors setting around, he said, "That's right." And I said, "Well, God hasn't told me that yet." I walked out of the place, my wife crying. Then I went over to the hotel to lay down, and I said, "God, what can I do?" And there He appeared, said, "Don't believe that; I'm with you." Hallelujah. My, I come out there with a big smile on my face, and I said, "Praise the Lord. I'm healed." Wife said, "You mean you're healed?" I said, "Sure, He gave the promise, and I've accepted it." She said... I said, "I'm so hungry." She said, "Well, I'll go get you a barley water."

L-27 I said, "Open me up a can of beans, and fry me a hunk of ham, give me some onions, and a piece of corn bread, I'm--I'm really going to eat." Yes, the promise... When you can get it out of your head and get it down here, something takes place. Jehovah-ji... "How you going to do it?" I don't know. He's already provided the Sacrifice; I just have to walk into it. That's all. Didn't seem to be any different for a while, but it sure--it worked a little later on. I never did weigh over a hundred and twenty-five, twenty-eight pounds, and I weigh a hundred and seventy now. So I feel fine. Why? Because He's still El Shaddai. Just as confident He's going to do it, because He said so... Sure.

L-28 On went Abraham, ninety years old now. And he said, "God's appeared to me and said He was the El Shaddai. I'm an old man; my wife is--is eighty years old," old grandmother-to-be, or was, looked like. And there she was a real old woman, him a old man, and the gray whiskers hanging down, but said, "Praise God, we're going to have that baby. God's done said so. Just keep all the birdeye and everything ready, 'cause we're going to have that baby." Oh, my, the people said, "Why, that man is kind of a little bit off of the head. No wonder, he stayed out in the wilderness too long." But he knowed where he was. That's right. No matter what the outside world said, he knowed where he was standing, for he had confidence. "He staggered not at the promise through unbelief but was strong, giving praise to God for he knew that he was able to keep that which He had promised." And if Abraham could do that, and we've got nearly three thousand years of witnesses since then, with the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and His Presence here with us now, and is supposed to be Abraham's seed, let us rise in the name of righteousness, in the Name of Christ, and believe God, if we're Abraham's seed. If the devil's tossing you about from pool room to barroom and everywhere else, kick him aside, take over. God promised it. I don't mean to yell. This thing may have a loud voice, but I--I get to feeling pretty religious sometime, when I go to talking about that, because that's right down the home stretch, you know.

L-29 So thinking there, ninety years old. "Well," he said, "if You're El Shaddai, You're the bosom; I'm leaning right on 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min it. God, I may be an old man; I might've been born sterile. Sarah was also. And she's twenty years, probably forty years now, a past menopause, but glory to God, we're going to have the baby anyhow. You promised it, so we're going right on believing it. Age means nothing." What does age mean to God? My. On they went. Another ten years elapsed. Now, Abraham's a hundred (my) and Sarah ninety. The Bible said they were well-stricken in age. Little grandmother with her little cap on, little shawl going around the house, Old Abraham, his shoulders all stooped over, great, white beard, on his staff as he walked around, still praising God... And the Bible said instead of getting weaker, he got stronger all the time. Be more glory, he'd see a greater thing. Then we call ourself Abraham's seed, and not enough faith to dot an eye if it was ink.

L-30 Notice, that's... I--I didn't mean it that way. Excuse me. I--I--I was... had my mind... Holy Spirit trying to lead me one way, and me trying to jump another, I suppose. But look, I didn't mean it like--like that. I meant if faith is pretty weak, and we go to thinking about our father Abraham, and him without the Holy Spirit. And we got the baptism of the Holy Spirit. He was under the sacrifice of a lamb, which could never take away sin; it just covered sin. But we're under a Sacrifice that put away sin, demolished sin, divorced sin. And then with the faith that we got, but yet they were not made perfect without us. They're looking to us to move on.

L-31 Now, here they are, around a hundred years old. And one day, Abraham after Lot had chose to go down to have a big time in the city as... perhaps maybe he become down in Sodom there, the well-watered plains... You know, the easy road's not always the best road. The best road is find the will of God and then travel it. Amen. That's right. Find the will of God, no matter how hard it is, just raise up your hand, and say, "I'll take the way with the Lord's despised few, started in with Jesus, now Lord, I'm going through." And Mrs. Lot went down there, and maybe become the president of many ladies clubs, and so forth, down there. And Lot became the mayor of the city, or whatever it was, backslidden, away from God, down there amongst those perverted people.

L-32 One day, Abraham setting out in the barren land, where there's not much to eat, and the cattle was poor, no water to drink hardly, but he was doing what God told him to do. One day while setting out there under the oak, he happened to look out, and he saw three Men coming. And he looked at Them, and quickly (he didn't have to wait for a month), quickly, being a Spirit-filled man, he recognized One of Them to be Almighty God and two Angels. That's what the Scripture says they was, Almighty God. And He come up, and Abraham run and fell down before Him, and worshipped Him, and called Him Lord, capital L-O-R-D, Lord. And he said, "Will You just come by a few minutes with me?" A Man was tired looking, Jehovah God Himself, all tired, dust all over His clothes, and probably Gabriel and Michael walking by Him in form of human flesh...

L-33 Said, "Drop in just a moment, for You've come this a way. You've had favor... I've found favor. You come by. Let me get a little water and wash Your feet and rest Yourself. Take a little piece of bread, and refresh Yourself, then You can go on." "Well," said, "just go do as you've said." They set down under the tree, and Abraham run to the tent, said, "Sarah, measure out three measures of meal, right quick, and knead it, and sifter it out, and put it on the hearth, and make some cakes."

L-34 He run out into the herd and felt around till he got the fattest calf he could find, had it killed and dressed, and come back, and brought out to eat corn cakes, veal chops, buttermilk, or milk of some sort, and butter. And Almighty God eat corn bread, veal, eat butter on His corn cakes, and drinking the milk. God did it. Sometime ago I was speaking on that, and a preacher wrote me a letter. He said, "Brother Branham, get next to yourself." He said, "You mean to say that that was God?" I said, "It was God; it was God." "Well, how did He get here, well, did He just get...?" He told Abraham, "Is anything too hard for the Lord?"

L-35 Why, sure. What was it? It was a body He was representing Himself in. Well, God owns everything. He just 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min reached over and got a handful of atoms, and a little petroleum, some cosmic light, and [Brother Branham makes a "whew" sound--Ed.] blowed it together, and stepped right out in it. That's all. He's a Creator. Fixed the other Angels up, and they walked up there in human flesh, and while they were in human flesh they were hungry. Hallelujah. I know I'm excite... may look like I'm excited. Let me tell you something. To know that our Father... What's a human body made out of? A little bit of--of oil, and petroleum, some light, a few atoms, and a little phosphate, and calcium, and so forth, all coming out of the elements. Why, He just spoke it into existence, stepped right out into it, and represented Himself, and talked with human voice.

L-36 That same God... The other day, I--I... My wife, setting back there... I was combing what few hairs I have left. She said, "Billy, you're pretty near bald-headed." I said, "But, thank God, I haven't lost a one of them." She said, "Where are they at?" I said, "Where was they before I got them? They were somewhere. They come, they was, and they are not. And one day they will be again." Hallelujah. Wherever they was at the first place, they are now, waiting for me to come to them some of these days. This old, wrinkled up body is going to change one of these days; I'll go back to be a young man again. So He showed Abraham what He was going to do. God set down with His back to the tent, said, "Where's Sarah?" Said, "She's in the tent." He said, "About according to time of life (that is, as it's with ladies)," he said, "I'm going to visit you about that time." And Sarah in the tent, went, "[Brother Branham illustrates.--Ed.]," laughed. He said, "Why did Sarah laugh?" With His back... the Bible said He had His back to the tent. That was quite a mental telepathy, wasn't it? "Why did Sarah laugh?" Sarah said, "Oh, I never..." "Oh," said, "yes you did."

L-37 God, in human flesh, recognized what was going on behind Him, the same One that--that knowed where Philip found Nathanael. The same One that's here amongst us tonight, that knows everything about you, He's still God. God had a need to talk to Abraham like a man, so He made Himself a body and stepped into it. And that same God of ours has every bit of calcium that's ever in your withered-up body. Hallelujah. Only thing He has to do is at the time of the coming of His Son, the Lord Jesus, is just speak, and every man that ever lived and believed in Him will come back to life again. He's Jehovah God, the Creator. Quit belittling Him; make Him big. That's what He is, He's big, powerful.

L-38 Look what He did to Sarah and Abraham there. Now, you're going to have to put on your jacket for a minute, especially the ministers. What did He do to Sarah and Abraham? After He went on down to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, and the Angels come down there, seen that perverted generation of people, just like we're getting today... Look at the papers and things, how they're packing, how perversion people is on the move because men can't be satisfied with one wife, and he's living with every thing, every woman that he can run around with, and women the same way. And it's become just like the sin of Sodom. On the increase, till the government's full of them; the nation's full of them. This West Coast is contaminated with it. I get thousands of letters from up-and-down this coast of men and women and things, done stepped across the line, perverted, giving them the mind of--of that type. Notice, what a pitiful thing it is. Not a remedy or medicine in the world can cure it: only God.

L-39 There they was, and... Well, you know what God did to Sarah and Abraham there, when He stepped into that human body, God did, Him and them two Angels? He just turned Sarah and Abraham back to a young man and a woman again, made them a young man and woman. Sure He did. Turned them back to a young man and a woman again. And notice. When He did this... I can just imagine seeing Sarah, the little grandma, you know, with a little shawl on, saying, "Dad, you know the hair is beginning to get a little black around the side; and you know, I believe some of it's growing again." 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min Say, "Mother, you know what? I happened to notice, Sarah, that the wrinkles are going out from under your eyes."

L-40 She turned back to a woman probably thirty years old, and him twenty-five or thirty, or little younger age, to a young man and woman. Now, listen brethren, you'll have to admit that God did something to both Sarah and Abraham. Abraham was a hundred years old, and had lived with this woman since, probably seventeen years of age, and no children. He had to do something. Watch. Now, young ladies, you all forgive me for this plain talk, but I'm speaking Scripture now. And watch, it's... Read between the lines. In order to have the baby, the first thing He had to do was bring... He had to make the womb of the woman fertile. Is that right? He had to do it. In order for her to go into labor, He had to give her a strong and a new heart. A woman ninety years old couldn't do that; you know that. And another thing, at that age, the milk veins is dried up. They didn't have bottles them days they fed the babies on, so they had to create milk veins and things for the mother to feed the child.

L-41 God don't patch up nothing. He just made a brand new Sarah to show what He's going to do to all you old women some of these times that'll believe on the Lord Jesus. Yes, sir. He made them a young man and woman again. I'll prove it to you. They taken a journey. Mark on a map where they went down to Gerar, around three hundred miles. That's quite a journey for an old man and woman of that age. And the thing of it was, when they got down to Gerar, there was a young king down there, named Alemek--Abimelech, it was. And he was hunting for a sweetheart. And all those beautiful girls around the country, and he fell in love with this old grandma, a hundred years old, little shawl, running around. He said, "That's the one I've waited for." Nonsense. You know better than that. But the Bible said he took her for his wife, a hundred year old woman. Refused the--all the young ladies, and said, "That's the prettiest girl I ever seen." He went and got her. Abraham called it his sister.

L-42 What did God do? He had turned Sarah back to a beautiful, young woman again. O God, when I think of it, what God can do. What a hope it gives you. Look, God paints a picture. God is a God of variety. That's the reason we can believe Him tonight being the God of the resurrection. Watch nature. The seed goes into the ground. If you put a yellow grain of corn in the ground, it'll come up a yellow. If you put a white grain in, it'll come up a white grain. In the... We're not all going to be blondes, or brunettes, or... In the Kingdom of God, there'll be a variety. God's a God of variety.

L-43 Look. He makes great big mountains; He makes little bitty mountains; He makes plains; He makes prairies; He makes deserts; He makes oceans. He makes white flowers, blue flowers, red flowers, pink flowers; He makes palm trees, oak trees, and all kinds of trees, grass, shrubs, and so forth. He's a God of variety. He makes blondes, brunettes, red-heads; that's the way He wants them. And this is just the negative side. You remember, brother... Let's go back a few days. When I think of this, and think of my own dear wife, setting there, standing between me and the public, thirty-five years old, and almost total white-headed... I like to put my arm around her and say, "Dear, but let me tell you, one of these glorious days, Jesus is coming."

L-44 You remember dad, when he walked down at the altar with mother there? The children's all raised and everything now. Remember how beautiful she was in that wedding dress she had on, those shiny eyes, those rosy cheeks? That was back before Max Factor come into view, maybe. But didn't have to have any put-on. But... And the beautiful set of hair she had... Look at her now, gray, wrinkled, her little cheeks is drawed in. You take her little, old hand, look at that wedding ring across it, and look how wrinkled it is. Mother, you look over at dad and remember how straight he walked down there that day. He was so proud of you. You looked over and seen the shiny hair he had combed back; it's all gone now. What little he's got's turned gray. You look at his great muscle that he used to stand there, when he washed at the old wash bench, and see his muscles move up-and-down, and now it's flabby, gone back. That's right. You remember that?

L-45 But remember, God paints a flower; He paints a picture. He starts you up from a little child. He lets you grow up. 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min I ask a science the other day, I said, "Prove it to me, brother." He was a doctor too. I said, "I want to ask you something, doctor." He was talking about the colored people in Africa, and I told them how they had to live, said they wasn't human. I said, "They're just as much human as you are or I am." That's right. They got a soul. That's right. And they're fine Christian people when they're converted. And I said, "I want to tell you something, doctor." I said, "Is it the truth, that every time I eat, I renew my life, put in new blood cells, comes from the food I eat?" He said, "That's correct."

L-46 I said, "I want to ask you something. When I was sixteen years old, every time I'd eat a good meal, I got bigger and stronger all the time. And now, I'm even eating better food now than I did when I was sixteen years old, and every time I eat, I'm getting older and weaker. Explain that to me. If I put new life in at sixteen, and it still made me grow and get bigger and bigger, how am I going to pour water in a glass and it filling right straight up till it gets right up to a certain place and then stop, and I pour water in and it starts going down? What happened? Tell me." I said, "For God has said; that's the reason. 'Dust thou art, and dust thou shalt return.'"

L-47 God lets you come up to the age to your very best... might have been... Satan might've afflicted you. You might not have reached that maturity. That's all right. In God's mind, He knows what you was supposed to be. So it got you to that certain picture, when He got you just at the time when you was about twenty-three to twenty-five years old, you're at your best, then He said, "All right, death, here he is, but you can't take him till I call." And you notice. You start finding out after you get over twenty-five years old, you're just not the person you used to be. What is it? You're failing. Yet you're eating, you're going back all the time. After while gray hairs sets in; your muscles go away; but the picture is in God's mind. And every vitamin, and every bit of calcium, and every bit of--of everything that was in me, when I was my best, and when you was your best, in the resurrection, it don't go nowhere. It come from somewhere, and it is now. It wasn't, then it is; then it is not. It goes back to where it was, 'cause God already drawed in His mind a picture what He's going to make you forever. And some glorious day, Jesus shall come and all... Look, what can death do to you? Death will keep putting you in the corner, and on the sick bed, and down there, but...?... the last thing it can do is pull you in the Presence of God. And then in the resurrection, everything that death... Oh, hallelujah. Everything that death ever did do to you will be wiped away.

L-48 When God makes this up here to your right place, where you're strong and healthy, and at your best, death set in. But what death done and all of its curse will be taken away, and you'll be back perfect again. Hallelujah. That's our heavenly Father. Oh, my, when we think of it, of how marvelous... just at... "Here, come here." Stepped right into the flesh and walked down. Here was Sarah, a beautiful young woman. And Abimelech was going to marry her. And so that night God appeared to him and said, "Man, you're just as good as a dead man." "Why," he said, "Lord, well why?" He said, "Well, you got a man's wife." "Why," he said, "You know the integrity of my heart; I didn't know it. She said that was her brother, and he said, 'That's my--that's my sister.'" He said, "Yes, that's the reason I kept you from sinning against Me." But listen... Showed God's sovereignty. There was Abraham, God gave the promise to.

L-49 Now, you Arminian brethren, just kind of hold your coat just a little, I don't mean to rub this in. But now, Abimelech was a good holiness man. Wasn't nothing he had done. He was a good man. And he was laying there, and there was God's selected prophet setting out there... Well, a man that would say that about his wife, I don't know. See? Look what a condition he was in, backslidden. Sure he was. God told him to stay in Palestine, and he left Palestine. He was backslid. He was setting down there telling just a small little, white lie. But notice what God did. God said to Abimelech, "I..." Abimelech said, "I know the integrity of your heart; that's the reason I kept you from sinning against 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min Me. But her husband is My prophet. I won't hear your prayer, but you go out there, and let him pray for you, 'cause I've called him, he's my prophet. And he's setting out there even in that condition; you go let him pray for you, and I'll hear him. If you don't, you're a dead man." Amen. Kind of quiet around here, but that's the Bible. All right. "You're just as good as a dead man." Abimelech got up from his dream and he went and called all his men, and they begin to shiver. He went out there and he said, "Abraham, here's your wife." And he restored the wife.

L-50 Abraham was a young man yet. Sarah, immediately, after that, more than a year or two, had the baby that had been promised all the time. Notice... Now, you said, "That's what He done to Sarah, but what about Abraham?" Even after Isaac died, or I mean, after Sarah died, when Isaac was way up a young man, old enough to be married, around forty years later... "Why," you said, "they lived longer in them days, Brother Branham." Now, wait a minute. The Bible said they were both well stricken in age. That's right. And Abraham married another woman after the death of Sarah, forty something years later, and had seven boys. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Hallelujah, it's our God. He showed in Abraham and Sarah what He's going to do to you and your wife, some of these days: turn you back, young again. Now, if that ain't a blessed hope, I don't know what is, brother. When He appeared there, got Hisself--self a handful of material that makes human beings and just spoke it into existence, said, "Come here," with another handful, and put two Angels in the side, and walked down and talked to Abraham and turned him back too, to a young man and proved what He was going to do. Hallelujah. We're the seed of Abraham on our road to the promise. When little Isaac was born... Oh, my, do I have to quit here? Give me just another five minutes, will you, to finish this so I can change something tomorrow night. See? Little Isaac, when he was about sixteen years old, God met Abraham... (Quickly, and I'll try to get to my text, my... Then we'll close, and start praying for the sick.)

L-51 At about sixteen years old, He met him, and He said, "Abraham, I know you've been good; you--you have... you've obeyed Me. I'll tell you what I want you to do: I want you to take little Isaac up and kill him." I'm thinking about a quarter after, I better stop right here, let's pray. Our heavenly Father, oh, it's so good to feast on the living Bread of God. Time won't permit me, Father, to get up to my--the text just now, but maybe You'll let me finish it tomorrow night. The people here they're working, they... I feel sorry for them out there in the fields moving around, in the plants, and offices, and so forth. They've come, Father; some of them are sick, and they're laying here suffering. And I pray, Lord, that You'll just bless Thy Word now, and may they go home with this on their mind, knowing that if they're borned again, they're dead in Christ, and have taken on Abraham's Seed and are heirs according to the promise.

L-52 Let every aged man and woman tonight, as they toddle out of this building, or this tent, as You come out of Your tent, from an old man to be turned to a young, an old woman to be turned to a young beautiful woman again... God, let know that someday we're going out of this tent, this dwelling place, the tabernacle of our humiliation, and we're going to be changed, step over on another land where it's purity. And when our feet first touches that blessed land, when the old ship of Zion blows for landing, we rush out, it's going to be all over then. Sickness, and cripples, and afflictions, and everything will be gone. Old age, death, sorrow, all these natural things that was caused by the curse will be gone forever more. We'll be changed, turned right back. Why, You know where every bit of the calcium is, and everything that goes in the human body. You know where it was before You built the body, and You've got it into Your keeping, can speak it right back. That's the way You did to Abraham, just spoke one into existence. The great Jehovah, standing there in human flesh, eating the meat from a calf, eating bread that He had growed in the field, Himself created, eating butter and drinking milk, hungered in His human body, clothed in a human body, prefigure of the Lord Jesus. How we thank Thee. The day You appeared to Samson and his wife, Jehovah God stepped right in that flame of fire, and went up in the sacrifice. How You appeared to Moses and turned Your back, walked around, let him be able to see You, and said, "It's the back of a man." 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min

L-53 Foreshowing, and yet we're told that You're Spirit. But You have control of all life, all creation. And I'm so happy tonight, Lord, that You can even put a--create a new heart in an old, rundown, sinful man or woman. What a great Father You are: can take a sick man laying on a cot, or a bed, or a stretcher somewhere dying, and make him well. The cancer-ridden, the cripples that's drawed up can straighten out their limbs, just the only thing You ask is to believe. Help us to believe tonight. For we ask it in the Name of Thy dear Child, the Lord Jesus. While we have our heads bowed, just want to ask this solemn question just now. That's why the Holy Spirit told me... I was going to go ahead with that subject, said, "Stop right now." Obedience is better than sacrifice.

L-54 Someone in here, that's outside of Christ... Now, I know we have a--a custom that we call people up around the altar, and let them pray, and so forth. That's good, but it's not Bible. The believers were added, "As many as believed was baptized." Is there someone here while all Christians are praying, people with their heads bowed... Is there a person in here that's away from God tonight, and knows that if Jesus would come, that your soul would be dead, and He could not bring a dead soul back into a live body, and you'll be lost and gone, nothing to bring you back again... Just as sure as the car won't run without gasoline, neither can you run, or be resurrected without the Spirit of Life. You're outside of God would you raise your hand to God, and just by raising your hand, say to Him, "God, remember me; I now want to accept Your provided way and come to You."

L-55 Would someone raise their hand, anywhere in the building? God bless you, my brother. God bless you, my sister. That's good. "I right now want to come. I've never seen it this way before, Brother Branham. I never realized what He did to Sarah and Abraham there." God bless you, little fellow. God bless you. Someone else say... raise you hand to Christ; He sees you. God bless you, my brother, setting over here. Raise your hands to Christ, and say now, "This is my hand to You, Lord. Someday I'm going to step out of this old tabernacle that I'm living in here, and I know if my soul is... And if it's sinning, it's going to be away from me. There's no way for me to be resurrected."

L-56 While you have your heads bowed, let me tell you just a little something recently happened. Sinner, think of this. No matter how much you go to church, if you're not borned again, you're lost. No matter how good you are, and how--what a fine neighbor, you're lost without being borned again. I was setting on a bench, or a little stool, eating some ice cream with an old Methodist minister friend of mine. The Agriculture Hour come on from Louisville, Kentucky. And the little 4-H club, they said, had perfected a machine that would produce a grain of corn that was so perfect that you couldn't tell it from the natural grain of corn that was growed in the field. A sack-full of each, pick up one handful out of one sack growed in the field, and the other handful that they'd made, mix them together, they'd both make the same amount of cornflakes. Open them up in the laboratory, they had the same kind of skin, the same amount of moisture, calcium, and what all goes in the grain of corn, every one just exactly alike. You couldn't tell one from the other, no way to separate them no more, which was growed in the field, and which one... they... was growed in the field, or which one was made by the machine, mechanically.

L-57 But there's only one way he said you could tell them. That's (listen) bury them. The one that man made just exactly like the one that God made, every physical thing looked just exactly alike, but it didn't have a germ of life in it. And the one that man made would rot, and that was all of it, but the one that God made, when it rotted, had a germ of life, and lived again. You may go to church, act like a Christian, pertain to be a Christian, but, brother, if that germ of immortal Life of the Holy Ghost isn't resting in your soul, you'll never raise in the resurrection, the first resurrection. Won't you think that over seriously? As your brother, I speak to you and encourage you in the Name of the Lord Jesus, to as much as raise your hand tonight to Him, and say, "God, give me that germ of Life," while we pray.

L-58 Father, grant it tonight, that whosoever shall do this may receive Life. One more time while... Look, will you raise your hand once more, someone in the building...?... God bless you, I see you back there, brother. Another one down here. God bless you, young man. Someone else, "I want that Life in me, Brother Branham." God bless this man down here. Yes, I see you. God sees you too. All right, we'll pray. 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min Heavenly Father, You see them who put up their hands. I pray tonight, that You'll give them immortal Life just now, because they have believed. "No man can come to Me except the Father draws him, and all that comes I'll give him Everlasting Life and raise them up at the last day." That's Your promise. You'll keep Your promise, Father. Something struck their heart. It was You, great Jehovah, Who was in flesh that day and talked to Abraham, turned him back to a young man. You're here, speaking Life. You said, "No man can come to Me" said Jesus, "except My Father draws him."

L-59 They couldn't have raised their hand, young or old, unless You drawed them. And when You said, "All that comes, I'll give Everlasting Life."... I'm quoting Your Word to You, Jesus. Now, give them that Everlasting Life, as they have accepted. Bless the waiting audience. Someday in the Kingdom of God may we have a great time of rejoicing, thinking of this night because of Your Presence and Your Word, for we ask it in Jesus' Name, God's beloved Son. Amen. The Lord bless you. Oh, my, don't the Word make you feel scoured out, better? Now, we're real late tonight. I'm sorry to... No, I'm not, no, sir. That was the Word of God. See? I'm not sorry. Just be a little more lenient, and stay just a little bit, we'll start praying for the sick.

L-60 Now, if you can thoroughly understand, it doesn't mean that you have to be up here to be healed. I only call a few people to get up here so the Holy Spirit can go to work. And if It goes to work, then God begins to move. And as God begins to move, the Holy Spirit moving on the people... Remember, as God begins to move with His Church, then It brings the Angel of the Lord out into the audience. People with... There's many more healed in the audience than there is healed here. So we just give out prayer cards. And if... so that we can get someone up here to start with, that don't mean they get healed; just means they come up here and are prayed for. You're prayed for out there.

L-61 Your... It isn't whether I touch you or you touch me; it's whether you touch Him or not. See? I'm just a man. See? And I... What could I do standing here? Looky here, this microphone, you hear my voice through it, but it's a complete, deaf, mute, unless there's something speaking in it. Is that right? So would I be a complete mute, nothing to say, unless something speaks through it. You just yield yourself and the Holy Spirit goes to work and confirms that Jesus raised from the dead. And He said, "The things that I do..." I don't... Listen, for the newcomers, Jesus said, "I don't do nothing unless the Father shows Me first a vision, what to do." Saint John 5:19. "Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing in Himself, but what He sees the Father doing: that doeth the Son likewise."

L-62 Always, it's that way through the Scripture. And He said, "The things that I do shall you also, for I'll be with you to the end of the world. A little while, and the unbelievers won't know Me no more; they'll never see me no more." They'll go to church, yeah, be very ritualistic, very pious, belong to fine churches. They did then, the same group that killed Him. Oh, they... "But they'll never see Me no more, yet ye shall see Me," never, that's all down through the ages, every one of them kind of people will never see Me no more." They don't want to see Him; they can't see Him. Said, "You got eyes and you can't see, ears and you can't hear." But said, "Ye shall see Me..." 'Ye's,' there was 'ye's' then. There's 'ye's' in Wesley's age; there's 'ye's' in this age, and will be 'ye's' until Jesus comes. Said, "Ye shall see Me. For I will be with you to the end of the world." Is that right?

L-63 It's never come to its end yet, and Jesus is still here, and people still can see Him. I pray tonight, that He will do something just a little different from the ordinary religious service that you been in, that you might return home like Cleopas and his friend from the resurrection. The day, first day of the resurrection, the Lord Jesus was resurrected and among the people, among the flowers, and so forth, on that first Easter, April morning, when He'd raised from the dead. And He journeyed and talked to two men all day long, and they still didn't recognize Him. There's no doubt at all but what you've... talked to you and He's kept you from having that accident, and He saved the baby's life, and He brought these things in, and helped you pay off the house. All these things He did. But maybe you never recognized it to be Him.

L-64 And then, when He got in there, He did something that only Jesus could do Himself. And their eyes were opened, and they recognized them, and He vanished out of their sight, right quick. And they run all the way back to Jerusalem, saying, "Truly the Lord is risen indeed." 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min I pray that He will do something tonight, like He did when He was here on earth, and then you'll run all the way home telling your neighbors, "Jesus has risen from the dead indeed, and appearing down there the other night in that little group of people setting in that little cold tent." I pray that God will grant that, in Jesus' Name.

L-65 What prayer cards did you give out? We got A, F, and H. All right, we start a new group tonight. We had... We give out a hundred cards and call a couple of nights from them, then we give out another hundred, and today he give out H's. And now, we've been... Prayer card H, turn it over and look at it, and the--the people who has it. And it's 1 to a 100. And let's start tonight... We've been the first, and last, and middle... let's just start tonight, from... I say sixty. See if we got that? Who has H-60? Raise up your hand, prayer card H-60? That's good, sir. Come up here. All right, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 2, 3, 4, 5, just line them up. There's fifteen of them. Let's try that first and see what we get. Look in your--your neighbor's card... H-60, I--I called H--H-60. Now, let's settle ourselves down real quiet for a few moments. Let's sing with this music, this lovely music. Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only believe; Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only believe. Now, there's some prayer cards missing. They're looking for them. I... H, yeah, H--H-60 to 70, I believe I called. H-60, no, 75, H--H-60 to 75. Somebody can't hear, or somebody can't get up. So now, look at your neighbor's cards or something. They're checking them now. All right.

L-66 Let's sing like this... now... They claim that there's a woman here with a--that's blind, that has got a dog with her, leading her. Look at her card, and see if she's been called. Anywhere from H-60 to 75, see if... Let's sing like this: Now, I believe. "Lord, I--I believe Your Word and it's all settled." Now, I believe. Let's raise our hands when we sing it like this: Now I believe, now, I believe, All things are possible, oh, now I believe. (Really mean it now.) Now, I... (Not "I will tomorrow." "Right now, I believe, right now.") Now... Now, do you believe Jesus is risen from the dead and is alive indeed. All things are possible, now I believe.

L-67 Now, I can see Jesus coming down off the hill one day. And the disciples was down there carrying on, but they... A man had an epileptic child, and he brought him. He seen Jesus and he come running to Him, and he said, "Lord, my son's variously vexed with a devil," said, "can You help him?" He said, "It isn't a question of that," in so many words, "but can you believe?" He said, "Lord, I believe; help Thou my unbelief." The boy got worse, right quick. Right quick, he got worse. But after he come over that spell, Jesus said, "Give him some food to strengthen him up; he will be all right." Now, it's the same Jesus tonight, isn't it? Now I believe; all things are possible, now, I believe. Okay.

L-68 Five or six missing, so... All right. Let's start the prayer line, 'cause we got to hurry. Don't make any difference, if one person... the... My ministry from the Lord is not to pray for each individual. Look... How many ever read what the Angel of the Lord said to me that night many years ago, when this even wasn't happening? Told me this thing here would happen like this. Anybody back there in the first of my ministry? Sure, look at the hands of the old-timers. Has it happened just like He said? Sure it did. He said, "You get... Do this, and the people will believe you." Now, those who will believe, just have faith; believe with all your heart. God will surely bring it to pass. Amen.

L-69 All right. Now, here's a man standing here by me, that... I--I never seen him, I guess, in my life. God knows him, I--I don't. But now what... Somebody might've went and got him out here and brought him over to this meeting. Say they did; say it was this brother, here did. I--I... He might've done it, I don't know. But say he did, and this fellow's 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min name now, would be Philip, and this fellow's name would be Nathanael. And he come up in the line where Jesus was standing. What did Jesus do? See? He just begin to tell him who he was, what about him. And the unbelievers said, "That man's got a devil; He's Beelzebub. He--He... That's--that's spiritualism; that's the devil (See?), Beelzebub, the chief of the devils." But Nathanael. said, "Thou art the Son of God, the King of Israel."

L-70 Now... And the woman that was in the audience, the blind man at the gate, all along, everywhere, you see... Jesus just... The woman come from the well, and Jesus talked to her a few minutes, and told her where her trouble was, said, "Go, get your husband." She said, "I don't have any." Said, "That's right, you got five." Now, she said, "You must be a prophet." Now, listen close, so you'll be sure to get this. She said, "We know that when Messiah cometh..." Do you believe Jesus is the Messiah, Jesus Christ, the Messiah waited... Jewish Messiah of God... She said, "We know when Messiah cometh, He will do these things. But Who are You? You must be a prophet." He said, "I'm He." So she goes and tells the people in the city, "Come, see a Man Who revealed my--my past life to...?..."

L-71 Now, He can do... the--the man... The woman come up there, that was her trouble. This man come here; there's some trouble with him, supposingly; I don't know. But God does know. Now, if God will reveal it, will that still be the sign of Messiah, not William Branham, but Messiah? Is that right? Messiah, that's raised and living in us, doing the same thing here, that He did there, isn't that Scripture, just as perfect as it can be? Oh, it's a little against the school of thought today, but it was a little against the school of thought in that day. Man makes schools of thought of anything, but that don't change God's Word. He brings it right on just the way it's supposed to be. See?

L-72 So many of them missed it in that day. Don't you miss it in your day. Not me now, Him. It's His... It's the day of His visitation, not me, I'm just a poor substitute of anything, but He... But it's--it's Him moving, working. He just give me a way, a gift to yield myself to Him and do these things for your benefit, not for mine, for yours. So it's for you. Now, the man a stranger, standing here. But if God will--will let me know this man, what--what's wrong with him, or what's something about him that he knows I know nothing about, will every one of you believe with all your heart then? What about you all around here on these stretchers, and cots, and things, you going to believe?

L-73 Now, if I was a healer, you know what I'd do? I'd jump down and heal that little boy, and heal this person here, and heal this person here, and that little boy over there, and this lady here. I'd heal them. Get this lady here, in this wheelchair, and I'd say, "Everybody's got cancer come here let me heal you." But when a man tells you he can heal you, he's deceiving you to begin with. That's right. Jesus has already did that, and no man can do it again. It's your own, personal faith. Just like a man say he could forgive your sins...?... "Why," he'd say, "why, the Bible said, 'He gave them power.'"

L-74 Yes, but that was before Jesus' crucifixion. That's right. The atonement wasn't made. Remember that, brother. Yes, sir. He also said, "Whoever sins you remit, to them they're remitted. Whosoever sins you retain, to them they're retained." But how did they do it? Peter said, the one that had the keys to it, on the day of Pentecost said, "Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." Is that right? See? Sure, it's not nothing man can do; it's what God has done. You a believer of that, are you, sir? Being preaching the way I did, it's kind of hard for me to get into the anointing of the Angel of the Lord to come, so that's the reason I wait just a moment. And you bear with me, and be real reverent, just for a few moments. And Billy watch me, and you too, and...

L-75 See? This is a subconscious condition (See?), it has to be. I know nothing about it. How could I know about this man? We don't know each other. We're stranger to one to another. Isn't that right, sir? Raise up your hand if that's right. 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min We don't know. God knows. But now, if I can talk to you just a moment, like our Lord did to the woman at the well... She come up to get a bucket of water; He said, "Bring Me a drink." He got a conversation. Did you ever read that in Saint John the 4th chapter? Beautiful verse, isn't it? Wouldn't you like to have been standing there then, right where He was setting on the well?

L-76 Brother, it may seem very strange, but you're standing in just about the same place. That's right. You realize it now, don't you? See? When our faith begin to move to Him, you see quickly what happened? Now, right now, there's a different feeling to you than what it has been since you stood there, is that right? If that's right, raise your hand. Now, if the audience can hear me good and every thing, the man standing to me now, between he and I, looks like a real, light something going on. And the man, he... why he isn't here for healing. He's already been healed. You was healed the other night. You had a... You're here for someone else. That's right. And that's for your child, isn't it, your daughter? That's right. And she isn't here. I see a wife appear on the scene too, nervousness or something. That's right. But she is here. Then you... She is here. And you--your--your daughter though, is in a state that's a different state. It's kind of a level country, lot of wheat grows. It's not... It's--it's Kansas; she's from Kansas; that's where she's from. And she's suffering with nervous trouble too. Mr. Brown, that's your name, you just return on; your daughter's going to get well and so is your wife. You're healed, God bless you. Let's say, "Praise Him."

L-77 Let us say, "Praise the Lord!" [Congregation says, "Praise the Lord!--Ed.] Do you believe? Have faith. Now, the man that's putting this around my neck's got a desire for somebody. Amen. Oh, it's wonderful when He comes on the scene. Have faith in God. You believe, lady? Only God can heal you or give you your desire. Have trouble with your head, don't you, brother? Uh-huh. The young man, setting there... Caused from an injury, wasn't it, brother? Uh-huh...?... You had some sorrow too, haven't you? It's a dark shadow; I believe it's your wife you lost. That's right. Isn't that right? Raise you hand. Why, your head trouble's over, sir. God's honored your faith, going to be well now.

L-78 See what I mean? You don't need a prayer card; you need faith; just have faith. God will give you the deep desire of your heart, if you'll only have faith to believe. Isn't He wonderful? Now, there He is still moving in the audience. While I can still see the audience, let me watch... He said, "I can, if you can believe." He's really lovely, isn't He? I see a lady praying. She's got her handkerchief up to her mouth. She's setting right straight behind this first row here. She's got a skin disease that she's praying about. You believe the Lord will heal you, sister? You believe that He will make you well? The little lady setting right behind the lady with the red coat on here, that's got your handkerchief up to your mouth, right here... Raise your hand up. It'll leave you. I see you even long, later now, it's gone from you. Your faith has healed you, sister. Amen.

L-79 Do you believe Him? "All things are possible to them that believe. If thou canst believe," He said, "all things are possible." You're praying for that child, aren't you, sister, setting there? Keep having faith now. Oh, my dear brother and sister, if I could only, could only, while I know you're listening at me, if I could only express what this feeling is right here now. Oh, just how it looks to me like everybody just ought to be, just oh, believing right now. He, our Lord Jesus is here. That's what caused you to come here tonight.

L-80 Now, it's making me weak. Of course you could see it, and even the--this cold night, and the perspiration running from my hand. See? You're... it's--it's His Presence. Visions... Jesus said "I perceive virtue has gone," not from the God that was in Him, but from His physical body, the Son of God, Who He was. That's the same thing here. It just makes you real weak; it's visions. If you have faith and can believe with all your heart, why, you can receive what you ask for. Now, sister, maybe I can talk to you just a little. Do you believe me to be His servant, the servant of the Lord Jesus? You know that there's nothing in your brother could do anything for you, to help you, to heal you if you're sick, but you know... Believe me that I am His servant, that I'm only trying to come here, because He spoke to me and told me to come, and He'd be with me and do these things, just like you see there in the audience. 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min Now, you know that I don't know you, and I--I know nothing of you. But God knows all about you, doesn't He? Well, if He can tell me here, what you're here for, then will you believe Him with all your heart, and will accept whatever you're here for, whether it's finances, or whether it's spiritual troubles, or whatever it is, you'll--you will accept it? Now, may He grant it is my sincere prayer. But, oh...

L-81 A dark shadow hanging near the lady. There it comes over her, the power of the enemy. And it's a--it's a tumor the woman has, and she also has a stomach trouble. That's right. Tumor's in the head, tumor of the head. That's true. If it is, raise your hand. Now, you believe His Presence is right here? Come here just a moment, that I might, while this anointing is on me, just lay my hands on you, sister, and ask the--the One Who's speaking through me, to you, that He will spare your life. Will you live for Him and do everything you can to serve Him? Dear heavenly father, Thou hearest this. And the darkness hanging over the woman, I curse this enemy. As Your servant, I curse it in the Name of the Lord Jesus. And Your beloved servants, the doctors, have tried to do all they can to for her, but, Lord, I pray that Your healing hand will be with her, and touch her, and make her well, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Now, go rejoicing, going happy, and believe Him. Doest thou believe now, with all your heart?

L-82 What do you think, that's setting there on the--the--the let--with a kidney trouble, setting there, you believe that God will make you well, setting there? You believe that He healed you now? You raised up your hand like you did. You do? You believe that He makes you well? All right, then you can have your healing. Amen. You raised your hands just in time. Amen. Now, go home; just forget you ever had it. Thanks be to the Lord Jesus Who gives us all things freely. Are you the patient? The Angel of the Lord is hanging over that little Spanish woman setting there, but I... Come this way just a minute. I can't see; it won't break to a vision; there's so many people praying. Just come here just a moment. Now, just to talk to you, lady, just for a few moments, I'm... I don't know you, never seen you. We're strangers to one another. Jesus knows you, knows all about you, and I don't know you. That's right. But God does. But if God will tell me what you're here for, will you--will you believe with all your heart? Well, there's one thing that you're bothered with is a heart trouble, and another thing you're bothered with is a nervous condition, and you're also bothered with anemia condition. That's right. And it all comes from a nerve condition that caused it. Causes mainly, after you've eaten, your heart's worse, because it's gas from your stomach, and you're just nervous because it's a time of life for you to be that way. See? That's right. And there's nothing going to bother you; you're in the Presence of the Lord Jesus, not your brother. You believe that? Will you accept it? You're not from this city; you come from another city. You drove here, about a hundred miles away. And it's a place called Ontario, something like that, California. Isn't that right? Now, do you believe me? Now, go home, forget all about it, you're healed. See? Jesus makes you well. Have faith in God; don't doubt. Believe and thou shalt receive, if thou canst believe.

L-83 How do you do, lady. I see you're packing a handkerchief in your hand. Do you believe with all your heart? Do you believe? Do you believe God to be Jehovah God that was with Abraham? You believe Jesus to be His Son? You believe me to be His servant? You believe that you're living in the latter days when Jesus is proving His resurrection? You might... You--you've been troubled with a lot of it, but just remember, those things only declare that there really is a genuine Holy Spirit. Now, you believe that with all your heart? You're here for someone else, aren't you? Yes, sir.

L-84 I see some sorrow. I think it was a loved one or a parent just passed away recently. Both of your parents are dead, both father and mother. That's right. But you got sorrow... It's another man, and that man is crippled, or he walks with crutches. It's a brother. And that brother is not here; he's in a country where it's cold, lot of hardwood. It's... He's from Indiana. That's where he's from. Send him the handkerchief. And here's another thing you're bothered about. You're worried about his conditions, his spiritual condition, 'cause I noticed you've been talking to him about his baptism; he should be baptized. Now, you go. He will be baptized, just tell him to believe with all his heart. Blessed be the Lord, the Jehovah-jireh, the Lord will provide. Is this the lady coming? Have faith. Does thou believe with all your heart? What are you thinking, sir? You believing with all your heart, laying on the stretcher? Believe. 55-1117, Jehovah-Jireh, Tent Meeting, San Fernando, CA, 94 min

L-85 There's a spirit coming from the woman, calling in the audience, and I can't tell where it's at, and... See? Demons sympathize with one another, and they call, help. If they can only reinforce it enough to get this woman to disbelieve, she'll walk off with her same condition. There's something wrong with her, but she--she... If they get her to disbelieve... But if the Angel of the Lord can get a hold of her enough to get the vision started, then she'll go away believing and receive. But he's calling. Yes, right there. Got bronchial trouble for one thing, got bronchial trouble, haven't you? Yes, sir. Setting there with the little, checkered, black sweater on. Uh-huh, yeah, that's you. You're both bothered with bronchial trouble. That's right. He's going to lose the battle. It lightens up. You have a rectal trouble too, hemorrhoids, that you're bothered with. That's right, isn't it? Amen. Just believe; don't doubt; just believe; have faith. He said, "If thou canst believe..."

L-86 Do you believe with all your heart? It's a weakening me, but a vision keeps moving around you. You're not from this city. You're from a place called... Looks to me like that little sign out there says Moore Park, Moore Park, California. That's right. And they call you... your... like Ethel, and Stevens. I see you getting your mail from a post box, 234 is your number. That's right. Now, run on back home, be well in Jesus Christ's Name. Have faith, don't doubt. Now, go out there to the end of the platform and say, "I ain't got no more arthritis; I'm well; I'm going home, be well." Go do that. Jesus make you well then. God bless you. Would you come, sister? That could be an abscess; I wouldn't say for sure; I don't know. You have a drainage from it, a female condition, ladies condition. Do you believe Jesus' going to make you well? All right then, the abscess will dry up and you'll be a well woman, if you'll believe. Just go, having faith, believe Him with all your heart.

L-87 You're nervous and upset. I see you trying to move to a chair. No, you're trying to get up from a chair... Oh, it's arthritis, got arthritis too. Go, thanking Him, saying, "Thank You, Lord; I ain't going to claim... That old arthritis is gone. I'm going to believe with all my heart." Have faith; believe. Lady, an operation waiting for you for a tumor. But do you believe Jesus will make you well? If you do, let me lay hands on you while... In Jesus Christ's Name, may my sister be healed. Thanks be to God. Come, lady. You were standing in the prayer line awhile ago a real strange feeling hit you when I said to someone back in here, "You have kidney trouble." See? You were healed at the same time. Now, that's right, isn't it? All right. Just go believing with all your heart. Let's say, "Praise the Lord." [Congregation says, "Praise the Lord.--Ed.]

L-88 Does thou believe? Sir, you're going to lay in that cot and you'll die laying there. If you'll believe you could get up. That it. Get up in the Name of Jesus Christ, rise up, take your ambulance chair, go home, Christ makes you well. Hallelujah. Let's say, "Praise the Lord." [Congregation says, "Praise the Lord."--Ed.] Do you believe? Then every one of you stand to your feet and accept Jesus as your Healer. Heavenly Father, in the Name of Jesus Christ, may every person here be healed, Lord God, and make them every one well. I commend them to Thee in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I pray that You'll heal...?... Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
