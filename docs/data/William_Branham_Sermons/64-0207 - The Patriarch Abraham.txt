--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Book of Genesis again, the 22nd chapter, beginning with the 15th verse, and we expect now just to speak for a few moments and start the service. Genesis 22, beginning with the 15th verse. And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD for because thou bast done this thing, and bast not withheld thy son, thine only son: That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sands which are upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy; And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou bast obeyed my voice. [Genesis 22:15-18]

L-2 What a promise, because of obedience! Obedience is what God wants. It was once said, "Obedience is better than sacrifice." To obey the Lord is better than any sacrifice that you could do. [I Samuel 15:22-23]

L-3 We're facing now a grand text, tonight, The Patriarch Abraham, which was called "the father of the Faith," because that God made him the promise to inherit the earth, and his Seed. And it's through Abraham we, being dead in Christ, become Abraham's Seed and are heirs with Him according to the promise. [Romans 4:1-13]

L-4 Now, Abraham was just an ordinary man, wasn't something special. God never called him, as far as we have any record, until he was seventy-five years old. His wife, which was his half sister, being sixty-five years old at the time, they had probably lived together since they were very young. And she was barren, and had no children. God called a complete separation, to separate himself from the rest of the world, and from all of his people, and from all of his kindred. There was a special thing for him to do. [Genesis 12:1-5]

L-5 And when God expects you to do a special thing, He demands a complete separation from any doubt. You've got to come to full obedience, to obey what He says. God demands it. You can't do it no other way. And, now, He always sets an example, and that was His example, of a complete separation from all of his family, all of his kindreds, and so forth, to walk a life separated to God. [Genesis 12:1-5]

L-6 Years passed, nothing happened, but still Abraham held on. He was not discouraged. "He never staggered at the promises of God through unbelief, but was strong, giving praise to God."

L-7 Year by year, as it went by, no doubt many critics come by and said, "Abraham, father of nations, how many children do you have now?" That didn't stagger him. No child, and Sarah was past the time of life, of bearing children, course, way beyond menopause, but still Abraham believed God just the same. He made preparations for the baby, because he knew and was fully persuaded that God could not make a promise that He wasn't big enough to back up. [Romans 4:19-21]

L-8 His Seed should think the same thing. Regardless of how unreal it seems, how unnatural it seems to the natural mind, yet God cannot make a promise that He is not big enough to take care of. We believe that same thing today. Every true Seed of Abraham believes the same thing. No matter what circumstances in, how much knowledge we've accumulated, how many things has happened, how unnatural it is to the natural mind, how foolish it is, rather, to the natural mind, it doesn't make a bit of difference. If God said so, that's it. And the Seed of Abraham are settled upon THUS SAITH THE LORD. That settles it. [Romans 4:12-15]

L-9 We find out, at twenty-five years later, no children. And still God was faithful to keep His promise to Abraham, for Abraham believed God. The little boy came on the scene, little Isaac.

L-10 Then after little Isaac had come on the scene, then we find out that God gave him a double test. He said, "This child..." After being now about a hundred and fifteen years old, or twenty, Abraham was. He said, "I want you to take this, your only son, and take him up to the mountain that I will show you, and there offer him up, on this mountain, for 64-0207, The Patriarch Abraham, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 65 min a sacrifice." In other words, destroy every evidence that he had that the promise would be fulfilled. That's taking away all the natural things. [Genesis 22:1-14]

L-11 And Abraham said, "I received him as one from the dead. And I'm fully persuaded that He is able to raise him up from the dead." [Romans 4:20-24]

L-12 That's the people now the Seed of Abraham, because He raised us from the dead. We were dead in sin and trespasses. And He Who was able to change my mind, change my thoughts, change my nature, change me all over, He can do as He pleases. Whatever He says, I believe it's the Truth, and every Seed of Abraham believes the same thing. [Ephesians 2:1]

L-13 Abraham, not disobedient to God, taken the little boy. And on this morning, told the servants, "You wait here with the mules. And the son and I will go yonder to worship, and he and I will return." Oh, how is he going to do it? When he goes up to the top of the mountain, to take his own son's life, yet he says, "The child, the lad and I will return." He knowed that something had to happen. And he didn't know just how God was going to do it; that isn't his question. He knows that God promised it. [Genesis 22:1-6]

L-14 That's all we care to know, God promised it! How is it going to be? I can't tell you. But God said so! He will send Jesus Christ, the second time, He will come in a physical form. He will claim His Own. There will be one thousand years, millennium reign upon this earth, with Him, with the redeemed. That's what He promised, and we are looking for that hour to approach. [Luke 17:30]

L-15 He promised to heal the sick, to raise the dead, to cast out devils. He promised to do it. He is the same yesterday, today and forever. How? I don't know. He promised to do it! We believe it; that settles it. When a man believes God, he believes all He says. [Hebrews 13:8], [Isaiah 53:5]

L-16 And that's the way Abraham believed God. Now was asked to destroy every evidence that His promise would be taken care of, but he was persuaded that God could do it. [Genesis 22:1-14]

L-17 Now, not only did He give this great promise, He give it to his Seed, also. And because Abraham was faithful, and kept the--the Word of God that God promised him, and knowed that God could raise up this child. And he spared not his own child; but (God) was a type of God giving His Son, of course; as he packed the wood up the mountain, and so forth; as Christ later packed His Own sacrifice block, up the hill, to where He was crucified. [Romans 4:1-20]

L-18 We realize that in this, in doing this, it pleased God so well to see that Abraham loved Him above everything on earth, even his only son. He loved Him above what anybody could say, anybody could do, he still loved God enough to believe His Word. [Romans 4:3]

L-19 All Abraham's Seed believes God like that. They are believing God. And we know that it pleased God so well that here is what He said, "Thy Seed shall possess the gates of its enemy. Thy Seed shall possess the gates of its enemy." Remember, that's THUS SAITH THE LORD. Abraham's Seed believes that. If you are genuine Seed of Abraham, the faith that Abraham had in God, it's in you. And you believe, that what God has said, God keeps His promise. [Romans 4:15-20]

L-20 And He said it, now remember, He only made this promise to Abraham after He had give him a test. The Seed of Abraham must first be tested, to see if they really believe the Word. Remember, the only way that he could keep the promise of God, because he believed the promise of God, and was tested whether he believed It or not. [Genesis 22:1-14]

L-21 We are brought to that test. The Seed of Abraham, today, is brought to that test. Will we take God's Word, or we take what man said about It? Will we take what some organization has made up as a creed, and accept that, or do we take what God said? If God's Word is true, we believe God's Word, regardless of what anything else is. We let every man's word be a lie, and God's be the Truth. The true Seed of Abraham! But before you can become that true Seed, you've got to go through the test, like Abraham did, himself. He promised not only to Abraham, but his Seed would possess the enemies' gates. Oh, my! [Genesis 22:1-14]

L-22 Just think, the patriarch was fully persuaded in it, in his test of the promise of the Word of God, was right. Regardless of what the circumstances was, he still believed the Word was right. The Abraham, the great patriarch, 64-0207, The Patriarch Abraham, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 65 min never wavered in faith, when he was brought to that testing time. He believed that God was able to raise him up from the dead. He believed it, because God made the promise. And when God made a promise that he would be "the father of nations," and he believed that that was so. He didn't know how it would be. When the baby come, after he had trusted, twenty-five years, then asked to destroy the baby, he still knew that God's promise was true, and he gave his son. [Romans 4:1-22]

L-23 His Seed, the same thing! The promise of God is the seal, to those who are the Seed of Abraham. The promise is a seal, a signed witness. And when we believe every promised Word, then the seal is given to us, to confirm the promise by. See, if we--if we, being the Seed of Abraham, we go through the test whether we're going to believe the Bible, or not. The Bible is the Word of God, because It is God. And then after you've went through the test, to believe.

L-24 When some of them says, "The days of miracles is passed." If you accept that, that's contrary to the Word.

L-25 If you say, "You do not receive the Holy Ghost, today. There is no such a thing. Just the twelve apostles received It."

L-26 The Word said, Peter preaching It on the Day of Pentecost, he said, "Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to them that's far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." [Acts 2:38]

L-27 That's just exactly what It means. It's, now if you are ready to take the test, of God's acid test, and follow that prescription, I'm telling you, you will find out that God keeps His Word, if you'll believe It. That's right. But you've got to go through that, because that's the seal; when you can receive It, then you will receive the promise. Because, It's God's prescription, the way we should do it, and that's the way we've got to follow It, just what He said. Now not just to some, but "whosoever," whosoever believeth, whosoever repenteth, whosoever believeth. It's to all generations, to all peoples, whosoever wants to believe It. And faith in God's Word brings you to this promise. Then, and then only, can you have power to possess the seal of the promise. [Acts 2:38]

L-28 And the promise that we receive, the seal, is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's right. For that is God in form of Spirit, you being His Word in you, then He comes in. If you receive the Word in you, the Holy Spirit is the only thing that can make That live, and then you have the promise of possessing the gate of every enemy that tries to attack you. That's right. God promised it, and it's so. [Acts 2:38]

L-29 Now, remember, you can only do it then, and then only, after being tested by the Word.

L-30 Abraham was tested by the Word. "Will you believe, Abraham, that you'll have the son?" "Yes."

L-31 The son come. "Now destroy him. Do you still believe it, Abraham?"

L-32 "I believe it, yet, for You're able to raise him up from the dead."

L-33 And after that, He said, "Now, your Seed shall possess the gate of its enemy." Amen! After the test come! [Genesis 22:1-22]

L-34 Let's check up on some of the seed of Abraham, in the natural seed. Which, we be today the spiritual Seed. But let's find out, by the natural seed, of some of them that believed the full promise of God, and never que-... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-35 I said, "By the way, what does a Christian girl want to show her underneath skirt for? I can't understand that."

L-36 You are born again, of God, you got the beauty of the Holy Ghost to show that what you are, you are. You've got virtue that these scandal skirts don't have. That's right. A real woman of God, that stands out with virtue, you might be laughed at, and called old fashion; but you got something that they can't touch, and done lost it and never can have it again. That's right. You got virtue. That's what God looks for, is virtue. See?

L-37 But the first thing, if there's a question in your mind, don't you do it at all. Don't you come in a prayer line if there's a question in your mind. Don't you come unless you absolutely believe it, emphatically, there's not a wave in your mind, at all, but what you're going to be healed, then you'll go off this platform a well person. That's right, when there's not a 64-0207, The Patriarch Abraham, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 65 min question in your mind, at all. You must believe God, not make-believe. Really believe!

L-38 And the Seed of Abraham believes it because the Word said so, and that's the reason we believe it. Not because somebody has criticized, because somebody else said so. Because God said so, that makes it the Truth. When God says it, that settles all questions. He is the last word. He is the ultimate. When God says anything, that settles it. There is nothing else can speak against It. "Every man's word be a lie, and Mine be the Truth."

L-39 Now as we check some of these seeds, let's think. We think of the Hebrew children, I have here, thinking of that, on the Hebrew children, after they had been tested against image worship. Now, you remember, the king said, "Whosoever will not bow down to this image, shall be throwed into the fiery furnace." Now, these children believed that God's Word was right, that they should not worship any kind of an image, but when they come to the showdown and they were tested whether they would. [Daniel 3:1-30]

L-40 When, all the rest of the children down there received and went to the worship, they went right on in the way the king said. They went with the popular thought of the day, that they must do it.

L-41 And when they were tested, whether they would worship images and break the Word of God, they stayed true to the Word. Regardless of the circumstances, they stayed true to the Word. And when they throwed them into the fiery furnace, God's promise was fulfilled. They possessed the gates of their enemy. And there was a fourth Man standing in there, with a key that unlocked the heat from the fire, and it could not do nothing but set them free. Amen. [Daniel 3:1-30]

L-42 When a man or a woman is ready to take the test, the acid test!

L-43 You see, they had to go in the fire. And then when they did, they was in the fire, and the only thing that taken place, this fiery test only unlocked, took the--the bands off of their hands. [Daniel 3:15-23]

L-44 Many times, God let's us, when we get all bound up with the world, bound up, He let's the fiery tests come upon us, where we have to make a decision. And when we do that, the only thing the test can do, when a real Seed of Abraham is standing at the--the crossroads of a decision, and he makes his decision to serve God, it can only cut the bands loose and make us free. Satan might give you a disease. He might give you one thing, another. How you know it's not God got you on the crossroads, to see what kind of a--a--a decision you'll make? [Daniel 3:15-25]

L-45 They possessed the gate of the fire. The fire could not burn them. There wasn't even a smell of fire upon them, because they knowed that they were the Seed of Abraham, and they stood for God and His Word. They possessed the--the gates of the enemy, and the fire could not burn them, because they possessed the gates. [Daniel 3:27]

L-46 Later, there was a man, a prophet down there, by the name of Daniel. He would... had the test whether he would serve one true God, or not. And when it come to that time, whether he would serve one true God, or worship a heathen God, he refused to do it; and throwed up the blinds, and prayed to his God, every day. And he was took by that, by a penalty of the federal laws, and was throwed into a lions' den. A hungry bunch of lions roared out after him. What did he do? He possessed the gate of his enemy. The lions could not eat him. God sent down a Pillar of Fire, an Angel that stood between him and the lion. [Daniel 6:5-28]

L-47 He possessed the gate of the enemy, because he was tested to see whether he would worship one true God, or have a dozen heathen gods that he worshipped. So he stood the test, and he possessed the gate of the enemy. The lion could not even touch him, because God was with him. God's promise stayed true, for he was a true Seed of Abraham. [Daniel 6:15-25]

L-48 Moses, oh, another great one. He was tested, also, to see the promise that God give him. "I'll be with you when you go down there." And when he stood before the impersonators of his gift, Jannes and Jambres tried to stand up and impersonate the very thing that Moses was commanded to do. And God had called him, and he knowed he was the one that was commissioned to do this, and he stood there and performed the miracle as God told him to do it. And here stood the impersonators, to do the same thing, but it did not bother Moses. He stood true to the Word of God, and he possessed the gates, amen, of the enemy, because he stood true to the promise of God, no matter who was trying to impersonate it. [Exodus 3:1-22] 64-0207, The Patriarch Abraham, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 65 min

L-49 What a lesson that is to every Christian! When you look around and see a hypocrite, you just remember he's trying to impersonate a genuine article. But, that only means there is one who is genuine. Stand true to the Word of God! No matter what comes or go, keep His promise. Yes, Daniel stayed true to the Word of God.

L-50 No matter how many tried to impersonate him, and everything else, he stayed true. And he come for a purpose, to take Israel out of Egypt, and to take them into the promised land. And when it come time for them to go into the promised land, out of Egypt, there stood the Dead Sea in the way. And he possessed the gates of the water, and the gates flew open. And the--the waters fell back, and Moses took Israel into the wilderness, to the mountain where God commissioned him to bring them. Amen. He possessed the gates of the enemy.

L-51 His father, Abraham, had had that promise, that his true Seed would possess the gate of the enemy. And the gates of the water was closed, and he could not get through, and that was the path of duty. He was supposed to bring those children to that mountain. God told him to. And there stood the gate in the way, and he possessed the gate of the enemy.

L-52 Joshua, a little later, when they come to Kadesh-barnea, which was the judgment seat of the world at that time, there Israel met its judgment. We find Joshua with Caleb, and twelve others... or--or ten others. One out of each tribe was sent over to spy out the land they were ready to receive.

L-53 And when they seen those great giants standing there, ten of them felt so bad, they said, "We cannot take it. It's too great. Why, look at the opposition we got." But when they come back to bring the report, they brought an evil report.

L-54 Why would they bring an evil report, if God told them, "I have give you that land; it's yours"? He told them down in Egypt. "I have give you this land. It's a good land. It's flowing with milk and honey."

L-55 But when they seen the opposition so great, ten of them come back and said, "We can't do it."

L-56 It was Joshua, he stilled the people, and said, "We're more than able to possess it. We are more than able!" Because why? He was looking at the promise. He was a true Seed of Abraham. Regardless of what the opposition was, "We can possess the gate, because God promised the land." And he possessed the gate. [Numbers 13:30]

L-57 Later on, when he brought the children of Israel down to the river. There stood, in the month of April, the great river, swelling. The Jordan coming down out of the mountains, and she was spread across the plains. Looked like the worse time, in the year, that he could be there. But, yet, he was Abraham's Seed. He knowed he had a promise, and he was in the line of duty. God give him a vision, how to do it, and he possessed the gates of the river. When the gates flew open, the water backed plum up into the mountains. And Joshua and Israel possessed the gates of the enemy, and crossed into the promised land, because God told them to do it. True Seed of Abraham! [Joshua 3:1-17]

L-58 Brothers and sisters, when he got over there, Jericho was all walled up, high enough that they could run three chariots across the top. How could these Israelites do it with borrowed, picked up swords, and everything, and sticks and stones, how were they going to go in there? But he was still the Seed of Abraham. God give him a vision, told him how to do it, said, "Sound a trumpet." Amen. That's it. "Let out a shout, march up towards the wall, the gates will fall before you." Amen! He was a royal Seed of Abraham. He was God's real believer. "The gates will drop down before you. Just let out a shout, and sound the trumpet. That's all you have to do." And what happened? The gates fell down, and Joshua took the city. [Joshua 6:1-27]

L-59 A little later on, we find out that the enemy was routing and going on, after that, and even He stopped the sun in its tracks. As I spoke the other morning, on the Paradox, He stopped the sun until he possessed the gates of his enemy. Amen. He knowed if that enemy ever got together again, they were scattered, and the sun was going down, and Amorites, and the Amalekites, and so forth, was scattered through. If they ever got together again, and come together, then he would have a hard time ever getting them to rout again. And there was only one thing that was holding, that was time. And He stopped time. Amen! Amen! There's one thing keeping him from the promise, that was the sun, nature itself crossing over, and He stopped nature. Why? He was a Seed of Abraham. He believed God's promise. He stopped him, and possessed the gates. Yes, sir. [Joshua 10:1-15]

L-60 These great man, all of them are great man. But you know when they, every one of them, when they come to the 64-0207, The Patriarch Abraham, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 65 min gate of death, they all died. Every one of them had to die. Because they were great man, "They stopped the--the mouth of lions, and escaped the fire, and the edge of the sword," and so forth, as we're told in Hebrews 11. And they possessed the gates of the enemy, all but one enemy, and that was death. Death swallowed every one of them up. [Hebrews 11:1-40]

L-61 Then one day, along come the Royal Seed of Abraham, Jesus Christ, the Son of God; Abraham's Seed, by faith. Not through Isaac, the natural seed; they did their part. But here come One Who was not natural born. Here come One that never come by sexual desire. Here come One by virgin birth. The Son of God, the Seed of Abraham, what a great Man this was! Other naturals was all born natural births. This Man was born a virgin birth. What did He do when He come on earth? He conquered every enemy that Satan had. He conquered everything. [Isaiah 7:14], [Matthew 1:23]

L-62 What did He do? He set out and he conquered sickness. There could be no sickness around Him; wherever sickness was, He conquered it. What did He do after He conquered it? He give us the keys, amen, saying, "Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind it in Heaven." Oh! Amen! That's the Royal Seed of Abraham, His promise. The Holy Ghost in us now, with the keys, holding it to sickness. He conquered sickness. Sickness cannot stand in His Presence. And He said that He gave us the keys to do the same thing, conquer sickness. "Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind in Heaven." [Matthew 18:18], [Matthew 16:19]

L-63 Also, temptation, He was tempted in every manner like we was. What did He do? He conquered it. And what did He say to us? "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you." He conquered sickness for us. He conquered temptation for us, broke down the gates; took the key away from the tempter, and hand it over to the believer, of Abraham's Seed, and said, "If he tempts you, resist him, and he will flee from you." Oh, my! Resist him! [James 4:7]

L-64 He conquered both death and hell. He rose up on the third day, saying, "I have overcome. And because I live, you live also." Oh, what a promise! That's to the Seed of Abraham. He conquered the grave, rose up on the third day, for our justification. When He rose up, He was our justification. What does that make us? He conquered sickness. He conquered death. He conquered hell. He conquered the grave. He conquered temptation. Oh! [John 14:19]

L-65 "Now we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us, and give His life for," being the Royal Seed of Abraham. With the same Spirit of God in us, that was in Him, we are more than conquerors. Every gate has been conquered for us. The only thing we have to do is possess it. It's already conquered. Sickness is conquered. Death is conquered. Hell is conquered. The grave is conquered. Everything is conquered, and we hold the keys, by His grace. Are you afraid to stick them in the lock, and say, "I come in the Name of Jesus Christ"? "Ask the Father anything in My Name." I love Him. [Romans 8:35-39]

L-66 After two thousand years has passed, two thousands years, and still here He is in our midst, the mighty Conqueror that rent the veil in two, that took every sickness, every disease, everything upon Himself, and bore our infirmities to the cross, and our sickness and our diseases, and triumphed over them, and raised up for our justification, and stands alive after two thousand years, to manifest Himself as a living Jesus Christ, amongst the royal Seed of Abraham who are heirs of all things. Oh, my! Those who after, goes through the test, promise of the Word! If you can believe the Word, then you are also the Seed of Abraham. That's how you come to It. [Matthew 8:15-17]

L-67 If you can't take that Word test, then if you doubt It, little suspicious of It, you can't hardly believe It, there is something or other, you can't believe It, then don't you come in the prayer line. I wouldn't even fool around the altar, until you can get enough grace to know that God's Word is true.

L-68 And when you once break through that veil of unbelief, then you got the keys in your hands, of death, hell, and the grave, because you've got a Conqueror Who conquered for you. Then you've got Hebrews 13:8, that tells us, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever." How can we do it?

L-69 The people today say, "Oh, well, I'll tell you, He's in a--a certain way, He is." "He is the same," the Bible said. "Oh, well, He doesn't do today like He did."

L-70 We find it right now, when we see His Word vindicated. What does it do? It throws It right back into their lap 64-0207, The Patriarch Abraham, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 65 min again. Amen.

L-71 The real Seed of Abraham believes It. They know It. And He stands, tonight, as He met Abraham up there in the days of Lot and performed that miracle, as He did by telling Sarah what she said behind Him. Jesus promised, the Royal Seed of Abraham, that the Church would see that same thing just before His Coming. What is it? It's got to happen. God promised it. Jesus Christ confirmed it and said it would be so, and here we are today, after two thousand years, see Him in our midst, still the mighty Conqueror! He conquered death, hell, grave, all superstition; took the Word...?... her. Yes.

L-72 He said, "If ye abide in Me, and My Words in you, ask what you will and it shall be given to you." What was it? The Word, Christ, That's in your heart. "If ye abide in Me, My Words abide in you, then you've conquered everything 'cause I conquered it for you. If ye abide in Me, if you can understand Me, if you can abide in Me. He that believeth Me, that receiveth Me; not just make-belief, but can receive. He that heareth My Words, understandeth My Words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life; and shall not come into temptation, or condemnation, but has passed from death unto Life." There He is, the mighty Conqueror! [John 15:1-6]

L-73 Here He is today, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Here He is performing before the Seed of Abraham, that's been called out of Babylon, called out of Sodom, called out of the world, and separated, showing His promise just exactly through. After two thousand years, here He stands in the midst of us, tonight, that mighty Conqueror, the Word of God Who can discern the thoughts that's in the heart, and the intents thereof. What is it? "Thy Seed shall possess the gates of its enemy." What is it? It's the Seed of Abraham, the royal Seed, believing the Word. And the Word is--the Word is God. [Hebrews 13:8]

L-74 Now when we see this, we can scream out with them, like the poet of old. Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me; Buried, He carried my sins far away; Rising, He justified freely forever; Someday He's coming, O glorious day!

L-75 Someone said, "You're getting old, boy." I can't help that.

L-76 I've lived since I was a little boy, my only achievement I've ever had is to see Jesus Christ's Coming. I gave my life for that purpose. I'm still in the pulpit, as an old man, I believe the same Story, and the greatest thing I can think of is to see Jesus Christ coming from the heavens to receive His own. God, then my... No wonder we can sing: All hail the power of Jesus' Name! Let Angels prostrate fall; Bring forth the royal diadem, And crown Him the Lord of all.

L-77 Why? He is the mighty Conqueror. If you're in Him, you're in the Word. He said, "If ye abide in Me, ask what you will." "What you will," for every gate has already been conquered. Then we can say: For every promise in the Book is mine, Every chapter, every verse, and line; I am trusting in His Word Divine, For every promise in the Book is mine.

L-78 Friends, do you realize what that means? Every promise that God made Abraham, every promise that was spoke by the prophets, every promise that Jesus Christ promised for this day, He is here to confirm it and to show that He lives forevermore. "Thy Seed shall possess the enemies' gate."

L-79 When it comes down to the hour of death. You say, "What about that?" You still have that Possession that Paul said. "O grave, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting? But thanks be to God, Who gives us the victory through that mighty Conqueror, Jesus Christ." Oh! Let Angels prostrate fall; 64-0207, The Patriarch Abraham, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 65 min Bring forth the royal diadem, And crown Him Lord of all.

L-80 Tonight, after two thousand years, we stand to see Him, yet, the mighty Conqueror Who rent the veil that separated us from any promise of God, and we are more than conquerors in Him. Let us pray.

L-81 Heavenly Father, as we stand here, tonight, in the Presence of the Holy Ghost, that great Person of Jesus Christ in Spirit form, Who was promised to come upon the Seed of Abraham, the royal Seed. We pray, O God, if there is a man or woman, boy or girl, in here, that doesn't know You; they've got doubt and flustrations in their mind, about the Word of God, whether It is the Truth or not. O Great God, Who made the promise, come tonight! There is one great promise You made, Lord; You can keep that promise, You said, "He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he also; greater than this will he do, for I go to the Father." Father, God, we pray that You'll confirm Your Word.

L-82 There is many of the children of Abraham here tonight, that's sick. Oh, the devil has gated them up; they've put them on the inside, and they've turned the keys, and said, "Now you must die; you have heart trouble. You got this, that, or the other, and you must die."

L-83 O God, may the jubilee trumpet sound, tonight, of the Gospel, that every slave can go free! Jesus Christ has conquered those gates. We hold the keys in our hands. Oh! "In My Name they shall cast out devils. If you ask the Father anything in My Name, I'll do it. He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he also. The Word of God is sharper and more powerful than a two-edged sword, cutting to the sunder and the marrow, and even a discerner of the thoughts that's in the heart."

L-84 "And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man, for they were eating, drinking, marrying, given in marriage; great building programs." And we watch the world, "There will be signs, fearful sights in the heaven above (this is flying saucers), earthquakes in divers places, the sea roaring (tidal waves), man's heart failing (fear), distress between nation, perplexed of time." [Luke 17:26-30]

L-85 "And as it was in the days of Lot, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man." O God, come tonight and perform Thy Word, come tonight and honor the faith of the children of Abraham. Through Jesus Christ's Name we ask it. Amen.

L-86 The Lord bless you, richly. I'm not going to make the altar call just at this time. I'm going to leave it up to you. I think that, many times, altar calls... I believe with them. "But as many as received, was baptized." That's it, "Many as received Him." We're going to pray for the sick.

L-87 I could speak here all night. You're a lovely audience. But what I say is just a man; but if I say His Words, then it isn't my words, it's His Words. If I say something, and God doesn't back it up, then that was my word. If I say His Word, and He backs It up, who is that sinful man or woman, boy or girl, that'll walk away and say It isn't so?

L-88 Jesus, said when He did these things, they said, "This Man is a fortuneteller. He's a devil!" A fortuneteller, anybody knows that fortune-telling is of the devil. He said, "He's a fortuneteller." But did you ever see a fortuneteller preaching the Gospel? Did you ever see the fortuneteller casting out devils? No, indeedy, they don't do it.

L-89 He said, "Now, I the Son of man will forgive you of this. But when the Holy Ghost is come, to speak against It will never be forgiven in this world or the world to come, because it's calling the work of God an unclean spirit."

L-90 God be merciful to us, tonight, and I pray that God will come down and confirm this Word before you.

L-91 Brother, sister, this is my soul. I've got to meet God. I'm responsible for what I say to you. God will hold me responsible for it. That is right. What good would it do me to stand here and say these things if I knowed I was condemning my soul to hell?

L-92 "There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof is the ways of death." God needs no interpreter. As I have said, He interprets His Own Word.

L-93 "The Seed of Abraham shall possess the gate of the enemy." Do you believe it? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] 64-0207, The Patriarch Abraham, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 65 min

L-94 If I could heal you, I would do it. Christ has already healed you. Only thing, you have the key in your hand. That key is your faith, to take a hold of it. Unlock it, tonight, won't you? While He comes into our midst, that Mighty Conqueror that conquered every disease, and come here and show you that He's done it, for He still is the Word. "And the Word is a discerner of the thoughts that's in the heart."

L-95 What prayer card? B, one to... What'd we start from, the other night? [Someone says, "One."--Ed.] Let's start from fifty. Who has prayer card B, fifty? Raise up your hand. Prayer card B. We started from one, the other night, now we're going to start from fifty, tonight.

L-96 Who has B, B, fifty? Hold up your hand. Prayer card B, fifty. You mean it's not here? Do you have it? All right, B, fifty. B, fifty-one, who has that? B, fifty-one, all right. B, fifty-two, who has B, fifty-two? All right, you have it. B, fifty-three, fifty-four, come right over here. Fifty-four, fifty-five.

L-97 My boy comes down here, right before I come in, and mess up a bunch of cards. And see how they are, one here and one there? They don't know. You might come down this row here and get one, next one get ten, another one get twenty-five. We don't know where it's at, but, wherever they are.

L-98 Now how many'd we call? Five, four? B, fifty. Was B, fifty, wasn't it? [Someone says, "Yes."--Ed.] B, fifty to fifty-five. Fifty-six, fifty-seven, fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty. Now let's see, one, two... Count them, Billy, and we'll... Sixty, seventy, let them stand up first, if you will. B, fifty to seventy, seventy-five. Count them, Brother Roy, if you will, while I'm talking to the audience.

L-99 How many out there now as you look this way, and you haven't got a prayer card?

L-100 Remember, Jesus said, "The works that I do shall you do also." Is that true? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] That's true. Do you believe it? ["Amen."] The Seed of Abraham said so.

L-101 The Bible says, that, "He is the High Priest." Hebrews, the 4th chapter, "He is the High Priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities." Do you believe it? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] If He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, how would He do it?

L-102 There was a little woman, in the Bible, as you notice what I'm saying. A little woman, in the Bible, maybe she didn't have a prayer card; but she said in her heart, "If I can touch that Man, I believe Him." She had spent all she had, for the doc-... with the doctors. They couldn't help her. Her case was too great. They could not help her. But she believed that God would help her. And she touched His border, of His garment.

L-103 And He said, "I perceive that virtue is gone from Me." Is that right?

L-104 Do you believe He is the same, tonight? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Do you believe He is here? ["Amen."] How many believe He raised from the dead? ["Amen."] Now how can you prove He raised from the dead?

L-105 Not long ago, a famous Baptist man come to me, and he said, "Brother Branham, I was defeated--defeated, one time, by a Mohemmedan who said that. He said, 'If He has raised, He promised that He would do the same thing. Let's see Him do it.'" See, they believe that He didn't do it.

L-106 But we do believe that He does it. We believe that He has raised from the dead. There is not another religion in the world that can prove that their founder is a living, but Christianity. And the only way God can confirm It, is through those who believe it; for that's the only way that God does perform His Words, is those who believe It.

L-107 Now while they're lining up this little prayer line here. I don't know how many we'll get. I want each one of you, hold your position, hold your seat, don't move around. Look this a way and pray, say, "Lord Jesus, I believe."

L-108 You remember, He told me, "If you get the people to believe you; and then be sincere when you pray." That's been across this nation, back and forth, for fifteen years, not one time did it fail. It can't fail.

L-109 God, one thing God can't do, that's fail. He's got to keep His Word. I believe that. I believe that just as well as I... more than I believe I'm standing here, more than I believe I'm in this building; this could be a mirage, it could be a dream. In my soul, I know Jesus Christ the Son of God lives. And you being a Seed of Abraham, you being dead in 64-0207, The Patriarch Abraham, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 65 min Christ, you're Abraham's Seed.

L-110 Now they got some handkerchiefs here. Great success is done by this, people who believe. Now let us bow our heads, while they're getting ready, and pray for these.

L-111 Heavenly Father, we're taught in the Bible, and there is people here who believe every Word that You said is the Truth. Lord, sometimes they stagger and punch at the keyhole, with the key, missing it, and scraping, but they believe it's there. Just let them keep punching, they'll find it, for it's there. And that key is the right key, "If thou canst believe, all things are possible." As the song is being sang now, or played.

L-112 In the Bible it says that, "Paul taken from his body handkerchiefs and aprons, and sent them to the sick and the afflicted, and unclean spirits left the people, and they were healed." [Acts 19:12]

L-113 Now, Lord, we know Saint Paul is with You. But, it wasn't him; it was You, Lord, Christ in him. "Not me that liveth, but Christ that liveth in me," he said. [Galatians 2:20]

L-114 And now to this generation, You're still Christ, today, as you was yesterday. And as I pray over these handkerchiefs, touching them, I pray that You'll defeat every enemy. Give them faith, to let them know that the enemy is defeated.

L-115 And one time, the Red Sea, as we just spoke of, had Israel cut off from the promise, and they was in the line of duty. And one writer said, that, "God looked down with angry eyes, through that Pillar of Fire, and the sea got scared and opened up its gates, and they went across."

L-116 Look down, tonight, through the Blood of Jesus Christ. And may, when these handkerchiefs is laid upon the sick, may the enemy see our faith, tonight, as we pray this prayer of faith for them. And may each one be delivered, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.

L-117 Now I want your undivided attention. Ever who is on the mike up here, you might step it up. Because, if the Holy Spirit should do this... I don't say that He will.

L-118 Now anyone comes here and tells you that they have power to heal the sick, don't you believe it. The power is all in Christ. He is the Conqueror, not you and I. We just accept what He has done. No man has power to save or to heal.

L-119 Every man in the world, the price has already been paid. The requirement has been paid. How was it? "He was wounded for our transgressions, with His stripes we were healed." Your--your healing is paid for. Your salvation is paid for. Have you got the faith to come, accept it? That's all. If you're Abraham's Seed, you have. God promised it. There is something in you that says it's there, and it is. [Isaiah 53:4-5]

L-120 Now what is a gift? Is a gift to go out and heal people? No. A gift is to get yourself out of the way, so God can use you.

L-121 Now He promised that, the last sign, according to Jesus Christ, "As it was in the days of Sodom, just before it burned." Not before other things taken place, the Gospel was preached by Lot, and so forth; not that. But just before it was burned, God came down in the form of a man, and set with the elected Church, Abraham and his group, who had the promise. [Luke 17:28]

L-122 Now remember, just Abraham's Seed receives this. "A little while and the world seeth Me no more," Jesus said. "You shall see Me, for I'll be with you, in you, to the end of the world."

L-123 But He promised, just before that He returned again, "As it was in Sodom," look what Sodom is getting; look what the elect Church is getting, said, "so shall it be at the coming of the Son of man." God manifested in a form of a man, that with His back turned to the tent, told what Sarah did on the inside of the tent. Everybody know that's the Truth, raise your hands. That's exactly. Now He promised it. We're at the end time. Now remember, that was the last thing that happened; and the Gentile world was burnt up, Sodom, and the promised son came on the scene. We are looking for a promised Son, the Son of God. [Luke 17:28-30]

L-124 Here we are. May God open your eyes. I know nothing else to say. May He open your eyes. 64-0207, The Patriarch Abraham, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 65 min

L-125 Now Heavenly Father, I'm as helpless, I'm a bunch of clay that You molded together, and set out here. O God, may I, tonight, have Your grace and Presence, that it might be You might use these little lumps of clay that You've got in here. That those, Lord, who You've called to Eternal Life, and maybe haven't accepted It as yet, may they see these promises. They might have been taught that was for another day, but here it is in the Bible. Confirm It, Lord. That's Your Own interpretation. It needs no more than that. If You'll just make it so, then they'll see that the Word is true. Grant it, Father. We commit ourselves to You.

L-126 Let every person in here, Lord, use their faith, tonight. May every member of the Tribe of Abraham, through Jesus Christ, have faith, tonight, and accept Your Presence. And we'll give You the praise. Amen.

L-127 Now, is this the la-... Now this is a strange. I want you to help me now, pray for me. Sit real quiet, don't move around. Sit still, pray.

L-128 Now, see, it's changing from evangelism, over to relax yourself in such a way that the Spirit of God can take you completely into another dimension.

L-129 Now here stands this young... Come over here a little bit, lady. And just... That's all right, so I won't get away from this mike. See, I don't know what happens, you see, and then sometimes, you know... Now only way I know it, it's--it's on the mike, you see, and they are trying to catch it out there, and I just don't know what.

L-130 Now we are strangers to one another. I don't know you, never seen you in my life. But you're a lot younger than I. And we was probably born miles apart, and years apart. This is our first time meeting. Is that right? If it is, raise up your hand so the audience will see. Now, she is just a woman standing here.

L-131 Look, take it back to the Scripture. Let's take Saint John 4. Each one of you read it when you go home. Not--not that this woman is that type of a woman; I don't know. And you know that I'm not Jesus Christ. But He is here. It's Him. Now His Spirit anointing us, can reveal her trouble, as He did to the woman at the well. Same thing.

L-132 And, by that, where the priests and the leaders of that day, said, "This Man is a fortuneteller, or a devil, Beelzebub." [Luke 11:15]

L-133 This woman said, "Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. We know that the Messiah is coming, and that will be His sign." [John 4:19-26]

L-134 Now, how many know that's true? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Well, if He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, wouldn't that be His sign tonight? ["Amen."] Did He promise it would be, just before the end of time? ["Amen"] Now see if He keeps His promise to Abraham's Seed.

L-135 Now if anybody in here thinks that's wrong, you come up here and do the same thing. If it isn't, then don't say nothing about it. You have the privilege.

L-136 Now, in Christ's Name, I take every spirit under my control, to the glory and honor of God.

L-137 I'll just have to talk to you, a moment, young lady. You know, our Lord talked to that woman at the well. He said, "Bring Me a drink." What was He doing?

L-138 Now watch, He said, in Saint John 5, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son," that was Him, body, "can do nothing within Myself," only as He seen the Father do. "What the Father doeth, He showeth the Son. See, I can do nothing within Myself, but as I see the Father do it." Then, Jesus never performed one miracle until first God showed Him by a vision; not told Him in His ear, but showed Him. "What I see," not hear, "see the Father doing." That's what made Him a Prophet like unto Moses, as Moses said. Now when He--He knowed the Father... He was on... [John 5:19]

L-139 He was going to Jericho, but He had need to go by Samaria, and He came up to a city of Sychar. And now see, the Samaritans was looking for a Messiah. [John 4:4]

L-140 The Jews was looking for it, and He showed them His sign. Philip, Nathanael, Peter, as soon as that sign was done, they said, "You're the Son of God." The rabbi said, "This Man is Beelzebub." [Luke 11:15] 64-0207, The Patriarch Abraham, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 65 min

L-141 But now remember, the Gentiles, we, we were the Anglo-Saxon, we--we wasn't looking for no Messiah. We were heathens, Romans, and so forth. We wasn't looking for no Messiah. He only comes to those who are looking for Him.

L-142 But the Samaritans was looking for Him, so He had to go by them, up by Samaria. He sit down at the well. A young lady, probably about your age, come out. She was a woman of ill-fame. You've read the story, I guess. And He said, "Woman, bring Me a drink." [John 4:4-9]

L-143 She said, "Oh, it's not customary for You, a Jew, ask Samaritan such." [John 4:9]

L-144 He said, "But if you knew Who you were talking to, you would ask Me for a drink." [John 4:10]

L-145 The conversation went on. Finally, He found where her trouble was. You remember what it was? She had too many husbands. And said, "Go get your husband, come here." She said, "I have none." [John 4:10-18]

L-146 Said, "You've said well," said, "because you've had five, and the one you're living with now is not yours." [John 4:18]

L-147 She said, "Sir, I perceive that You're a prophet. We know Messiah cometh, He'll tell us these things." And He said, "I am He." [John 4:19-26]

L-148 She left her water pot, ran into the city, and said, "Come, see a Man Who told me what I did. Isn't this the Messiah?" They hadn't had a prophet for hundreds of years. And here was a Man that claimed to be the Messiah, and proved to be a--a prophet, and showed the sign of the Messiah. [John 4:29]

L-149 Would it make you believe the same thing, if He did the same thing, being He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and has promised by these Scriptures that He would do it? Would it make the audience believe? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-150 You suffer with a kidney trouble. If that's right, raise up your hand.

L-151 Why does that always bounce in my face? Somebody says, "He guessed that." I never guessed that.

L-152 Here, she is a nice woman. Do you believe me? Now you know I never guessed that. Let me say something else. Your husband is with you. He is suffering, too. Isn't he? A spinal condition. That's right. Isn't it? You've got a little boy with you. He is suffering, too. You want him prayed for. He has got something wrong with his eyes. That's right. You got a little girl with you, she's got kidney trouble, like you. Is that right? Now you can all be well, if you'll believe. Do you believe it? God bless you. Go on your road and be well.

L-153 Do you believe? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. What is it? What's He trying to do? To you, Seed of Abraham, He is showing you that He is not dead. I can't do those things. He's not dead. But He's a living, showing you that you have a right to possess the gates of your enemy. That should settle it.

L-154 This lady, come this way, just a moment. We're around, somewhere the same age, I suppose. But we are--we're strangers to each other, so far as I know. I don't know you, and we're strangers. I know nothing of you. If that's right, raise up your hand, see. [The sister says, "That's right."--Ed.] Just some of them give you a prayer card, and here you are. All right. Now if the Lord Jesus...

L-155 If I, maybe, say I was trying to take Brother Oral Roberts' place, or some of those great man of faith, I would say, "Lady, what's wrong with you?"

L-156 You would say, "Well, I have so-and-so." Now, he might not be right. See? I don't know. See? But, he, you might tell him what's wrong.

L-157 He would lay hands upon you, say, "God sent me to--to pray for the sick. Do you believe that?" "Yes." "Glory to God! Go, believe it."

L-158 It's alright. It's alright. God promised that. But, you see, we're living up a little further up the--the day than that. Jesus promised, "As it was in the days of Sodom. The works that I do shall you also."

L-159 Now if God can tell me what you have been, you know whether that's true or not. He can tell you what you will 64-0207, The Patriarch Abraham, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 65 min be. And if that's true, this will be true, too. If He tells you, whatever, I don't know; but if He'll tell me what your trouble is.

L-160 Will you believe it, too, audience? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-161 I really should stop. That one time, that person that was here a while ago, that should confirm it. Jesus did it one time. He never did it one more time. Everybody in Sychar believed it, believed the woman's testimony, when she come, told them, and she was an ill-famed woman. A Christian just left the platform, before all of you! Amen. But beings that it's later than we think, may the Lord continue to prove Himself, the great, mighty Conqueror, that the Seed of Abraham... But like Abraham, He did it for Abraham, once; then destroyed that, and did it again. Abraham continually to believe God.

L-162 You're not here for yourself. You're here for somebody else, and that's a lady. It's your sister. [The sister says, "O Lord!"--Ed.] And the lady is shadowed to death. ["My!"] And she is suffering with a--a diabetes. ["Oh!"] And she is not from here. ["No."] She is from a... She is from Louisiana, a swampy country. ["Oh, oh, oh!"] That... And here is another thing, that the audience might know this. You have a daughter that's real sick, that's planning on attending this meeting, and she has epilepsy. ["Oh, oh, oh!"] That's true. That is true. Isn't it? ["Oh!"] Do you believe now? ["Yes. Amen."] If you're Abraham's Seed, accept it and walk out, ["My Lord! My Lord!"] and be healed in the Name of Jesus Christ.

L-163 Do you believe? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Certainly. Remember, it's His promise. He said He would do it. He keeps His promise.

L-164 How do you do? We are strangers to each other. I don't know you. But God does know you. Do you believe if God can reveal to me your trouble, then you know it has to come from some spiritual power. [The sister says, "Right."--Ed.] Now, there is only two things it can come from, that you could imagine. When it's done, it's beyond explaining, because it's a phenomena. And, also, it's a paradox; something, well, it's unreasonable, yet true. It would be a paradox. And now you know it, whether it's true or not, you'll know whether He has told you the truth.

L-165 Now, remember, I don't know you. It has to be Someone besides me. If you do like the Pharisees, and said, "Oh, it's an evil spirit," then you have that reward. If you believe it's Christ, you have His reward. The reason you can believe it, because He promised it for this day, and it hasn't been from that time to this. That makes it the end time.

L-166 There is somebody keeps appearing before you, all the time. It's a man, gray-headed. It's your husband. [The sister says, "Yes."--Ed.] Sitting right there. He is trying to accept his healing, being shadowed by a cancer, tumorous, cancer. You have kidney trouble, bladder trouble. ["Yes."] You are Mr. and Mrs. Little. ["We are."] Is that right? ["Yes."] Believe with all your heart, and be healed.

L-167 "You say his, their name?" Why, certainly. Didn't Jesus tell Peter, "Your name is Simon, the son of Jonas"?

L-168 Here is a man. We are strangers to each other, sir. I don't know you. But you're a man, like--like the Peter coming to the Lord Jesus, we come together. Do you believe me to be His servant? Do you believe what I've told is the truth? [The brother says, "Yes, sir. I do, sir."--Ed.] If you can believe it! ["Yes, sir."] I, if there is anything I could do for you, I'd do it, but there is nothing I can do. He has already done it; it's just something to get you believe it. And, see, it wouldn't be me. If it was me, I'd--I'd do all I could for you. But He gave me a gift, and I just relax myself before Him, and He does the talking. ["That's right. Yes, sir."] Do you believe that? ["Yes."]

L-169 Do you believe that, audience? [Congregation says, "Amen."]

L-170 I wanted to find a man. You have several things wrong with you. But one of the things is, you got a growth on your right eye. That's your main trouble. Here is another thing, a woman keeps appearing here. It's your wife. Do you believe God can tell me what's wrong with your wife here? Her trouble is in her mouth. It's her teeth. That's right. Do you believe that the same Jesus, Who knowed who Simon Peter was, could tell me who you are? [The brother says, "Yes."--Ed.] Would it make you believe greatly? ["Yes, sir."] It would? ["Yes."] Oscar Barnes. ["That's right."] Is that right? Go on your road home, be healed. 64-0207, The Patriarch Abraham, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 65 min

L-171 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... stranger to you. I do not know you, but God does know you. Do you believe that He is able to tell me what's your trouble? Would you believe it with all your heart? Your trouble is around your throat, and in your chest here. It's a--it's a bone decay. You're getting lumps, like, and knots inside the bone structure. That's right. You're not from here.
