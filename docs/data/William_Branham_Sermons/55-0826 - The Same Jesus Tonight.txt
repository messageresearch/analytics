--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 That God was in that man. She ran to Him; she fell on her face, the right way of approach. She looked up at Him, and give Him His right title. She said, "Lord, if Thou would have been here my brother would not have died." Look at the reverence. Now look. Here's a faithful heart by the side of the fountain...?... got to happen. Coming the provided way, she's recognizing Him as Lord. In the face of death she still believes Him. "If Thou would have been here my brother would not have died." But watch this next verse; she said, "But even now, Lord, what You ask God; God will give it to You." Amen. I like that.

L-2 Looky here, lady, you can never come out of that chair by a doctor. You can't either, sir, or you--you with cancer...?... you with heart trouble, maybe you've went to every doctor...?... You've done everything. There's nothing could be done. Look up now, and say, "Even now, Lord, no matter what the doctor said. The man done his best. I respect him. But even now, Lord, whatever You ask God, God will give it to You."

L-3 Look at Him. Setting at the right hand of the Father in His old gray garments, making intercessions for you. He's in His Presence, so ask Him "Did You say. "Even now, Lord, the doctor said I was going to die. But even now, Lord. Whatever You ask God, God will give it to you. The doctor said I will never walk again, but even now, Lord, whatever You ask God, God will give it to You." Amen Now, something's got to happen. It's just like clouds moving together. When the right time comes, every cloud will take it's place. There is a woman with a desire in her heart, with faith in Who He was, standing by the fountain of Life, recognizing, no matter what the past was, in His presence...?... Hallelujah. There she is. "Whatever You ask God, God will give it Thee." That turned His great heart. He looked at her; "... rise again." She said, "Yea, Lord, I know he was a good boy; he will raise again in the general resurrection." Those Jews believed in the resurrection. "He will raise someday in the last days in the resurrection."

L-4 Listen, the only Man that ever lived that could make this statement... The Bible said He wasn't much to look at, probably a little frail-looking Person. I can see Him straighten His little frame up and make this statement. "I am the Resurrection and Life." Never a man could say that, nor afterwards will there ever be. "I am the Resurrection and Life; He that believeth on Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me, shall never die." Oh, how that thrills my heart, to know with certainty, that now we have Everlasting Life. Name's written in the Lamb's Book of heaven... There's a grave laying yonder; the body in it's all molded. The first thing falls in on the body is the nose. Skin worms is going in and out. A broken hearted sister, but Martha, standing by the Fountain of Life had hear that Word. Oh, I love it.

L-5 Let me tell you; she must believe for the impossible then. That's what you've got to do. You've got to believe the impossible in order to have new life. Let me also say this as God's servant, 'cause I know from what I speak. The impossibles are made real, when God is took at His Word. When any person will take that same Word, it'll bring the same results every time, every time you ask it.

L-6 Now, listen, she heard Him say, "I am the Resurrection. He that believeth in Me, though he's dead, yet shall he live." And she believed it. She--she said, "Yea, Lord, I believe that You are the Son of God, that was to come into the world." Look at her confession. Look at her approach. I'm not yelling at you; I don't mean to be that.

L-7 What more, she's standing there. Oh, to stand in her place. Can you stand there tonight, brother? Can you stand there tonight, sister, in her place, with your difficulties, standing at the Fountain of Life, knowing that Jesus is at the right hand of God with a sworn oath and His own Blood, that He will give you whatever you ask in His Name. Amen. Watch Jesus. He said, "I am the Resurrection and Life. He that believeth in Me, yet shall he live; though he were dead yet shall he live." He said, "Believest thou this?" 55-0826, The Same Jesus Tonight, Unknown, Lausanne, Switzerland, 75 min She said, "Yea, Lord, I believe that You're the Son of God." That's exactly what He said He was. That's what God had vindicated Him to be. Oh, my! He's raised from the dead, and that's what you see going on here tonight. Believest thou this? He said unto her, "I--I, you... Believest thou this?" Said, "Yes lord" Said, "Where have you buried him?" Oh, something's got to move. Everything's in order. Something has to move. People, put your heart in order with God, and the heavens will come down in your presence. And you'll see the glory of God. Get your heart right. Get faith, your sail full; and when God's wind of power moves through the building, you'll catch away in it, and sail up out of your sickness and trouble. Hallelujah. The Resurrection and Life... Here we go, down to the grave.

L-8 A woman in America not long ago, she said, "Brother Branham, you brag too much on Jesus in His earthly journey." Said, "You make Him Divine." I said, "He was." Oh, she said, "No." She belonged to a certain denomination of church that did not--does not believe in the virgin birth. She thought Jesus was a prophet. That's a great teaching in the world today: one--one of the blackest lies the devil ever told. He was the virgin born Son of God. Amen. He was either God, or the greatest deceiver the world ever had. A prophet's blood is no more than mine or yours.

L-9 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] When the Holy Ghost overshadowed her, and--and put a blood cell in her womb... In creation God the Creator made that. And that came to be the Son of God. Amen. Outside of that you're lost... Outside of believing that you're lost. All you could do, you have to believe that in order to be saved. A fellow said to me not long ago, he said, "Preacher, you know better than that, cause you know that was Joseph's son." I said, "That was God's Son." He said, "Listen, that's against all scientific order." Said, "It can't be." I said, "I don't care what science says. They say one thing this year, and take it back next year. Say something else. But God's Word stands forever. Now, you don't believe that God could have formed that baby?" I said, "I'm going to ask you something. Then if... Do you believe that He had a mother?" Said, "Yes." "You believe He had a mother? But He had to have a earthly father or He couldn't have been born?" Why, I said, "I want to ask you something. You just told me awhile ago, that man came from monkeys. Then I want to ask you something. Where did the first man came from? Let him be monkey or whatever he may be; he had to have a father and a mother. Where'd the first one come from?" That stopped him. According to his statement, He had to have both father and mother. Oh, my. Their argument is thinner than the broth made out of the shadow of a chicken that's starved to death. To me, oh, here's what I believe in: God's Bible.

L-10 And the woman said, "I can prove to you that He wasn't nothing but a man. I can prove by the Bible that He was just a man." I said, "I want to see it done." She said, "Here, Saint John 11, when He was going down to Lazarus' grave, the Bible said, He wept." Said, "Nothing but a man could weep." I said, "Oh, lady, look. He was a man when He was weeping. But when He stood there with the tears in His eyes, and there laid a man dead, his soul four day's journey, his body had rotten, He said, 'Lazarus, come forth.' And a man been dead four days stood on his feet and lived again. That was more than a man; that was more than a prophet; that was God in Christ." I said, "He was a man when He come down off the mountain and was hungry, looking around the tree. He was hunger like a man. But He... When He taken five loaves and two fishes and fed five thousand, that was more than a man. That was God the Creator." Amen. "He was a man laying out there on that boat that night. He'd been praying and preaching all day. His poor little frail body was so tired, till the waves didn't wake Him up. I can see that little old boat, like a little stopper on the sea. Ten 55-0826, The Same Jesus Tonight, Unknown, Lausanne, Switzerland, 75 min thousand devils of the sea swore they'd drown Him that night. He was laying there like a man asleep, so tired. But when He woke up, walked out, put His foot on the brail of the boat, looked up towards heaven, He said, 'Peace be still.' That was more than a man. That was God. That the winds and waves obeyed Him." Yes, sir.

L-11 That was a Man hanging on Calvary, our supreme Sacrifice, and the blood running from His hands, and from His side where He was striped for us. And He screamed for mercy. That was a man dying. But on Easter morning when the seals was broken, and the stone rolled back, and He rose again, He proved He was God. No wonder the prophet said, "Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me; buried, He carried my sins far away. Rising, He justified, freely forever. Someday He's coming; oh, glorious day."

L-12 How I long to see Him, to see Him here in His Spirit. Someday the Holy Spirit will leave the church. And we will meet Him in the air. And these old bodies...?... will be changed, and made like unto His own glorious body...?... and spend a thousand years with you...?... and we will live in His presences forever. He's the same Jesus tonight. Believest thou this? The Bible says He's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Believest thou this? He's the same Jesus tonight, that a woman touched His garment and virtue went from Him. He's the same Jesus tonight. Believest thou this?

L-13 When the Hebrew children was in the fiery furnace, because of the Word of God. Jesus the Son of God was standing by them. Believest thou this? I believe He's the same One that sent an Angel in the den of the lions with Daniel, so no harm could come to him. Believest thou this? I believe He's the same One that come to the man at the pool of Bethesda. Thirty-eight years sickness... He said, "Take up thy bed and go home now." He's the same Jesus tonight. Believest thou this? He's the same Jesus that told the woman at the well, after talking to her a few moments. He told her her troubles. He's the same Jesus tonight. Believest thou this? He's raised from the dead; He's alive forevermore. Believest thou this? I believe He's here right now to anoint His same power. Believest thou this? I believe the sick's going to be healed in a minute. Believest thou this? I believe these sick people setting here... There's people laying around here that won't even get up now. They'll be getting up, walking after while. Believest thou this? Amen. He's my Lord. Let us talk to Him in prayer.

L-14 Jesus of Nazareth, send forth Thy Spirit tonight, Thy creating Spirit, and Thy great Presence to drive back the darkness of the enemy. And may all the people have a creative power in their heart tonight, the power of faith. O Creator, grant this to us. Will You come take this poor feeble body of Your unworthy servant, drive all the sin away from it. Come, live, Lord Jesus, in here tonight, once more that the people might know that You've raised from the dead. And they'll believe You, I think, Lord. Give one more chance at it. May these people setting bound here in these chairs, laying on cots, may they get up and walk out tonight, believing on the Lord Jesus. May all the ones that's near death walk out well tonight. O Father, I know Your more willing to see it than I am. But You have made a way that man must believe. O God, open every channel tonight of men's hearts, that they could believe. For we ask it in Jesus' Name, Thy only beloved Son. Amen.

L-15 Have faith in God. Don't disbelieve. In America we have a saying, "Toe the line." Meet satan on his own ground; cast him away. What if you went home tonight, to your own home, and there was a big bunch of bad people in your home, tearing up your furniture, and dirtying up your house, drinking and going on? You would open the door; you'd say, "What are you doing here?" They say, "This house is built for human beings. And I'm a human being; I have a right here." But you'd say, "Wait a minute; this is my property." You could prove it. Go there and get your deed, and you could prove it. And then, present that deed. They have to leave. If they don't, the officers will come and throw them out. And look, Satan's doing that evil to you. He's the one gave you the cancer, the heart trouble, all these diseases. Your a son and daughter of God. And you've got an abstract deed from God, that He was wounded for your transgressions, and with His stripes you were healed. Healing is your personal property. Don't let the devil cheat you out of it...?... Faith 55-0826, The Same Jesus Tonight, Unknown, Lausanne, Switzerland, 75 min cometh by hearing, hearing of the Word. And the Holy Ghost... The Holy Ghost is God's Officer. He will come cast him out. Amen. Have faith.

L-16 Now, they give out what prayer...?... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... and you come up here sick. Now, be careful how you answer. Could He heal you? No, no, He's already done it. He's say I did it at Calvary. At Calvary's where you were healed, not on the platform, not out there at your seat: at Calvary where you were healed. Now, you could accept it here on the platform, or you can accept it out there. But you were actually healed at Calvary. Say there's a real bad person in the building tonight...?... Would Jes... Could Jesus save them tonight? No, Huh-uh, He's already done it at Calvary. There's where the price was paid. No matter how bad the person was; they could accept it tonight, but Jesus has already done it. Amen. See, it's already done; so you just have to accept it now.

L-17 But what would Jesus do if He was here? He might know why; He might say something to you like He did in the Bible: told the woman where her trouble was, told Nathanael where he was when Philip found him. And He--and He said, "I can't do nothing Myself; what I see the Father doing in a vision... The Father... The Father gives Me a vision, then I do what He tells me." Did you see tonight in the resurrection of Lazarus? Jesus had a vision. The Father told Him what was going to happen. Amen. Now, He can do the same tonight. And if He, how many's been here before raise up your hand? [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Father, I know there's no virtue in my hands. There's no virtue in my hand...?... virtue of hope and of faith... There was no virtue in handkerchiefs that Paul prayed for. There was no virtue...?... But it was obeying the Word of God...?... I send thousands a month of those all over the world. Testimonies just pile everywhere.

L-18 Just recently, up around Germany, around Berlin. There's a little woman had been in a wheelchair with arthritis for several years. I prayed over a handkerchief and sent it to her. When she got it... When she got it she pinned it on her underneath garment like I told her. And she said [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] If we disobey Him, and reject the Blood of His Son. Now, as the Lord Jesus [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] and know what's wrong [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?... solemnly believe that it's His Presence. You'll have to believe it's some supernatural. So if you accept it to be Jesus, then He can help you. Will you do that? On the tongue... Had--had an operation... Does thou believe the Lord Jesus is present? Come here. Lord Jesus, I bless this man in Jesus Name. Amen. Go, my brother and believe with all your heart. Have faith in God. Believe with all your heart. Amen. Let us believe God with all our heart, with all our soul. Well, if--if I have told truth, then God will vindicate that I've told the truth. Then you have to be the judge. Amen.

L-19 You have been very sick; after... long time ago... You were much younger than you are now. You set in with a nervous condition. And the nervous condition kept bothering you. Now I see you praying with the graying of the hair. And there's something went wrong with your stomach. And your food got so it would sour, and it wouldn't digest. And you're restless at night. And you was examined for this. And you--you went to a--a clinic or--or--or a place and--and there was a strong man, big man, that give the examination. And he was wearing kind of a gray suit, and then they wanted to operate it--in the stomach. And they taken out something from the stomach, where there's one, two, three, three ulcers that come out of the stomach. And then when they did, they sewed it back up. And you have come home. And it's a not healed up; it's not done right. You still can't eat right. And your weight isn't right. You can't gain.

L-20 Those things are true. You believe now? Who knows your life but God? It's His love to you. Do you speak English? [The woman says "Yes."--Ed.] I hear someone say, "Alice." Your name, your name is Alice, and your last name is Humberg. Amen. You are healed. You can go home and be well. Amen. Have faith in God. Don't be startled now. But it's you're wondering again; don't do that. That's Scriptural...?... why it's all. I hear the names of the people, but I can't say those French names. Why, when--when Peter came to Jesus, Jesus said, "Your name is Simon, and your father's name is Jonas." Amen. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever... He knows you. Amen.

L-21 How do you do? You're speaking Dutch. Do you believe? I am just a man, your brother, your friend in Christ. And 55-0826, The Same Jesus Tonight, Unknown, Lausanne, Switzerland, 75 min we're strangers to each other. I never seen you in my life. The lady with the red sweater on, got cancer, Jesus makes you well, if thou canst believe with all your heart. Amen. Have faith. Now, that will not harm you; It's the Holy Spirit. You are suffering with a heart trouble. You have heart disorder, oh, a serious stomach trouble, very bad. You would die, if God doesn't heal you. It's a cancer in the stomach. You are religious; I see you by a church. I see you're a Catholic. You're a Catholic. I see you with beads saying the prayer. Do you believe me to be God's prophet? Would you accept Jesus now as the Divine One to save your life. Come to me, my sister. Oh, God of heaven, have mercy upon this dying woman. And may the mercies of Almighty God, Creator of heaven and earth, rest upon this woman, and may she live. In Jesus Christ' Name. Amen. God be with you. Let us say, "Praise the Lord."

L-22 How do you do? Do you believe with all your heart? Have faith in God. There was something struck you, when you heard what was wrong with the other woman. Cancer, it's awful bad. You believe God can heal you...?... ? You do? She believes it? Look this way. There, you have faith, mother. You are a little age; that doesn't matter to God. He loves you; you're just a child to Him. The cancer's on the breast, on the right breast. That's true. Father God, I look at this poor little woman, and I think about my lovely little mother across the sea, somewhere on her knees now, praying for her preacher boy. Won't you help this little mother? O God, let the virtue of Calvary tell her of her life, through Jesus Christ' Name. Amen. Bless you.

L-23 Good evening. We are strangers to each other. We do not know each other. But look on me just a moment. You believe me to be God's servant? Half of this audience is suffering with your trouble. Turn around this way; let me show you something. How many people in this audience is suffering with a nervous trouble, raise up your hand? Did I tell you right? About... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... that would make you worse. It can't help you; it's the flow of the mind through the nerves. And that's in the supernatural now. God has never let science have one thing for nervousness. They got shock treatments. But that's a shot in the dark: sometimes makes them worse. But Jesus can't fail. Do you believe that? Lady, you got in a pretty bad condition, 'cause her mind keeps wandering. Now, believe with all your heart. I can make it leave you now, but I can't keep it away. Only faith can keep it away. Will you believe with all your heart?

L-24 [Brother Branham speaks to interpreter--Ed.] When did she believe with all her heart? Bow your head. Let the audience bow too. O God, in Jesus' Name, this poor woman... Seeing down the road there, that trap's set for her by Satan...?... And if something doesn't happen, what is fixing to happen in a few months... I pray for mercy. O God, take away this evil. Lighten this burden now so she can have faith. Satan, I cast you away from her in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Gone now. See that sigh of relief? Let us say, "Praise the Lord." Amen. If I told you God healed you of your back trouble when you was setting there would you believe it? Do you believe it? Amen. And then go right on. Amen. Let us say, "Praise the Lord."...?... lady, following this lady, a dark shadow of death. The lady has cancer. But don't fear; Jesus is here to make you well. Come, here my poor sister. Oh, Satan, I come in the Name of the Lord Jesus here, this foul spirit. You cornered this little mother. I--I rebuke thee in Jesus' Name, come out of the woman. In Jesus' Name... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Do you see the smile? God heals. Amen. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?...

L-25 ... That He said He would do. And our eyes see them; our ears hear them; and we behold the glory of God...?... wonderful. Shall we pray. Father, we pray in Jesus' Name, that You'll help us tonight. Now we know when You...?... to be a Healer. You said, "It's not Me that doeth the works. It's My Father that dwelleth in Me." You said, "I do nothing of Myself, but the Father shows Me what to do, and that I do." And Father, we see that You--what You did with our Lord, how You was able to talk to the woman at the well and tell her where her trouble was. And when You told Philip where he had been, and told Nathanael... Many other great things did You do. And You gave us the promise, that the things that You did, that 55-0826, The Same Jesus Tonight, Unknown, Lausanne, Switzerland, 75 min we would do also. Father, we believe it especially at the end time. Forgive us, Father, of our sins. And pray for these tonight, that You'll manifest Yourself in the same manner to this audience tonight. Heal the sick and save the lost. In Jesus' Name we pray. Amen.

L-26 F. J. Palms, and Mister Bosworth has already spoke. And now we will call the prayer line and pray for the sick. Please remember this friends, it is not necessary for any one to pray individually for you. The necessary part is your faith in God. Watch what our Lord does. The paralyzed raise up whole; the blind receive their sight; the deaf and dumb speak and hear; the secret of hearts made known, just like Jesus did when He was here on earth. It's still Jesus, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Brother Bobby come and...?... They sent out several cards: C, D, G, and E's, and F. So we will have to call from somewhere to get a group up here. Let's begin in E, E... Let's say E-65. If you raise up your hand. E-65, would you raise up your hand? This lady raised up her hand. E-65, 66, E-66. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-27 God knows... And you understand that I do not. If there was anything I could do to help you, or anyone else and would not do it, I'd be a brute. If I could help someone and would not do it, I'd be very unkind. Only thing I can do is to take a gift that God gave me to get you to have faith in His Son, Jesus Christ. And He promised in the Bible that He would come in us and do these things through every age, until He physically returns again. Do you believe that? Now, you're just like the woman standing at the well. Have you ever read? She said, "Sir, I perceive that Your a prophet." And He said, she said. "I know when Messiah cometh, the Christ, He will do these things." See, that was the sign of Christ. Said, "But Who are You?" Jesus said, "I am He." See, to know what was wrong with the woman was the sign of the Christ. It still be the sign of a prophet. And here we are tonight, just a man and a woman, standing here on this platform two thousand years later.

L-28 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] That Jesus makes you well? The little lady sitting there, if you believe with all your heart, you may be healed. Amen. Lady setting here, having a hard time breathing. You believe Jesus makes you well, lady? All right, stand up. You been a nervous trouble, which caused you to be shut off. Breathe now. It's gone now. Wave your hand. See, you don't need prayer cards; you have to have faith. That woman's faith touched the Lord Jesus. That's why she was healed. That's THUS SAITH THE LORD. How do you do? You believe with all your heart on the Lord Jesus? I'm just your brother, but Jesus knows all about you. You're conscious you're in His Presence. You, sitting right back there looking this way, behind the folks with the stomach trouble, way back. You believe with all your heart? Yes, the lady, gray headed. That's right. She's standing up now. Your healed. Jesus Christ makes you well.

L-29 See, Satan was doing evil. When you come up here... See, you had stomach trouble too, same thing. Then God can make you well. You've had much trouble with it. Uh-huh. Need operation, a hospital operation...?... That is true. You have... Back and forth, one and then the other... That you might know; I can't speak your language. Look at me and believe with all your heart. You believe me to be His prophet? I believe you do. Here's another thing you might know. You're a married woman. And do you believe with all your heart? Do you believe that Jesus Christ is here to make you well? You have a loved one; someone's trouble in their lungs...?... you want prayed for. You've been praying. That is right. Do you believe now that God will make them well? Come here. Lord Jesus, be merciful and heal her, dear God, in Jesus Christ' Name. Amen. Now go believing, and you'll not have to have no more operations. Just be faithful; that's all. Praise the Lord. If thou canst believe, all things are possible. Do you believe Him with all your heart?

L-30 The lady that raised her hand right back here, about three or four rows back. She's suffering with a liver trouble. If you believe, you can be healed. Will you believe? All right. Go and be healed then, in Jesus' Name. Amen. 55-0826, The Same Jesus Tonight, Unknown, Lausanne, Switzerland, 75 min You believe with all your heart, lady? I've never seen you. Your face is gray. I can hardly see the audience now. I am not a fanatic. God bear me record. We have never met before, we're strangers to each other. Jesus Christ knows us both. You have trouble with your legs, the poor circulation, because of your work. You work standing on your feet. You're around sick people or something. Your a nurse. There's two of you. There... You have a twin sister, and she's a nurse too. And she's got back trouble. Amen. Come. Heavenly Father, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, may this, our sister be healed and her loved ones. I bless them in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Amen. God bless you. If you can believe, all things are possible, but you must believe.

L-31 Lady setting, looking at me back there on the, towards the back, suffering with a nervous trouble... You believe with all your heart, lady? If you can believe, you can be made well. For instance, if you might want to know who it is, a lady... One setting right next to you, look the way, is suffering with a liver trouble. Do you understand? Yes. That's right. Now, if you want to know, there you are lady. All right. Now, if you want to believe God with all your heart, the lady right next to you, the other way is suffering with a head trouble. That's right, lady. Now, you can all go home, and be made well. Jesus Christ heals you. Amen. Do you believe? Just have faith in God. The lady, how do you do? We strangers to each other. God knows us both. And someday, God, and you, and I will stand together. And we will have to give an account for our lives. You believe that? Are you believing on the stretcher there, lady? You're near the Kingdom now. Be reverent, everyone. Excuse me. I just have to follow the Holy Spirit. I wouldn't think that. It is not a stage show. You're mistaken; don't do that. Something bad might happen to you.

L-32 You are suffering with a trouble in your mouth. It's very dark around you. It's a cancer. You are a mother. I see a boy standing by you, about ten or twelve years old, sick too, something in the lung, TB. in the lung. And here's something of you. All your life, you've had a longing, saying, "Someday you'd become a Christian." You need Jesus as your Saviour. These things has happened to bring you to Him. Do you now accept Jesus as your personal Saviour? Your sins be forgiven you, my child. Go in the Name of Jesus and live, and let your son live also. Have faith in God. Don't doubt, but believe with all your heart. As Jesus Christ, the Son of God is here. Now, do you believe Him?

L-33 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... Jesus Christ the Son of God, that's the things He did when He was here on earth. Brother and sister, it's not me; it's Jesus. Now, the lady standing here, I--I don't read the... It isn't reading the people's mind. You think people are thinking about things they done many years ago? Let the lady come near me, and just hold my hand. If God will tell me what's the trouble with the lady, will you...?... You be the... Lady, here, if Jesus just show me what your trouble is, if you will, you raise up your hand, if you will accept Him? You suffer with a lady's trouble, a female disorder. Christ healed you; you can go. God bless you. Have faith, believe with all your heart. If you can believe, God will make you well.

L-34 Here sits a lady right back here, right back behind this row here, suffering with a lady's trouble, with a...?... place on her hair...?... clothes. Your faith healed you, lady. God made you well. God bless you. Amen. I don't know those people. How would I know what was wrong with them? It's their faith. That lady just then, was in her heart, saying, "I believe that. That is true." And God healed her. She didn't realize how bad she was. But the lady from back there was standing here on the platform. And I seen a vision, the Angel of the Lord go with her. That's how I knew who she was. And she was saying in her heart, "I believe that." If that's right, lady, raise up your hand? Do you believe now? You don't have any prayer card; you don't have no way, nothing at all. Your faith alone healed you, and what I told you I saw in a vision here, and what you were saying, if that was right, raise your hand? Let us say, "Praise the Lord." Now, do you believe? He's here to make every one of you well.

L-35 A little boy, come here. I think you're a nice little boy. It hasn't been too long since my little boy was like that. I've 55-0826, The Same Jesus Tonight, Unknown, Lausanne, Switzerland, 75 min got a little boy at home just six weeks old, little Joseph. And I left him so I could come help you. Do you like to go to church? You--you know when they used to teach you about Jesus taking little children and laying His hands on them and they'd get well? I think you're a nice little boy. Now, honey, Jesus went up into heaven, but His Spirit come back. So Brother Branham has come to help you in His Name. Now, that wonderful Jesus that lived back there, if He was here, He'd put His hand on you and bless you and you'd get well. You believe that? Well He sent me to put my hands on you in His Name. Then you'll get well too. Now, Jesus would know what your trouble was, wouldn't He? Then if Jesus will tell me what your trouble is, then you'll believe Brother Branham's telling the truth won't you? Asthma. Amen. Dear heavenly Father, I bless this little lad in Your Name. I pray that You'll make him well. Take this nervousness from him, the asthmatic condition, and may the little boy live to be a strong man. I pray in Jesus' Name. Amen. Go, now and he will be all right. God can heal you of your back trouble just as He did the one just passed by a few moments ago. Let's say, "Thanks be to God." You suffer with a stomach trouble. I see you coming back away from a table, because you can't eat everything. It makes you upset. It's been a long time that way. You started when you was, kind of a--a middle aged woman by being real nervous, and you've been nervous ever since. That's what's caused your stomach in that condition. Come here, my...?...
