--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Good evening. Very happy, and as usual, to be here. It always makes me feel happy to come and--and minister to the sick and the needy. God knows that the world is sure in need. Now, tonight as we minister, Brother Gordon told me the other day, said... Kinda refreshed myself and speak awhile tonight? Next... Tomorrow afternoon is the--the "Life's Story." And I wish, if you would, if you come out tomorrow and can, I make it the afternoon so it will not bother anyone's services, religious services. If you can come in the afternoon, it'll be very, very fine. And then tomorrow night, I trust that God will give us our outstanding healing service tomorrow night. That'll be...

L-2 Next week, they've asked me to continue on a little while, which I'm going to try my best. We very seldom ever stay over three to five nights in meeting there. And this time, I'm trying to stay a little long, because it's so difficult to take the--to take the... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] God bless every one. And I just love little children. She passed by there. Bless her little heart. Yes, sweetheart. She has eye trouble, don't she, mother? She's extremely nervous too, isn't she? Isn't that right? You're suffering with a back trouble. Isn't that right? Yes, ma'am. Well now, you believe me what I tell you, will you do that? You go home testifying that you're healed, and about your daughter too, and everything will be all right for you, if you'll believe it. God bless you, sister. Now, the little sweet little thing come by waving her little hand. Well, I just love little children with all... Now, don't... Do not doubt nothing, sister. Now, that's... You know that I'm perfect stranger to you, and I do not know you, know nothing of you. But you believe me if what I've told you to be the truth, and God... You go ahead and just testify, say you're healed and all is over. And your baby will get well, and everything will be all right.

L-3 Now, I want you to remember that tomorrow night... Everybody try to be in tomorrow night for the healing service. And next week, our... What we try to hold off for so many cards, is to try to get to a place where... Our meetings are usually congested with many, many thousands of people. But it hasn't been too many people in the meetings. And I feel if we'll just take next week and we won't have any prayer cards. We'll just pray for everybody, just let everybody come up and pray for them. And--and I believe that there's been enough said around, and watched the things that's been in other meetings, till I'm--I'm trying to find a way... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Something that God can get every one of, you know, heal everybody. That's what I want to see.

L-4 Someone told me there'd been somebody here for many, many times in the other meetings, and had never been able to get into the prayer line. That's what I'm trying to get away from. Just as quick as possible get to a place to where we can get every one prayed for. The signs and wonders are glorious. And I believe though, I tried it in Kuopio, and many of the different places. And it was just wonderful. But in America I have never seen the time just yet. I was trying to find the will of God, to find out what God wants me to do. And then I always want to walk in His perfect will if I possibly can. Everything that I--I know that it can be done to--to help.

L-5 Now, everybody be reverent, believe with all your heart. And now, I want to thank some of the dear people that... A certain lady, I... She may not even be here. A couple days ago, she bought me some clothes. (My little boy's speaking here.) This woman, kind of a poor lady, was all right. I--I looked at the clothes, and I--I admired it, so that I--I didn't know what to do. Anybody gives me anything, I appreciate it just million times more than if I bought it myself. I was... I just want to thank that lady, if she's here anywhere, and may God bless her and give her the desire of her heart. And I appreciate... Someone sent me a box of handkerchiefs and some things yesterday. And I appreciate that. God knows that I won't 50-0819, Show Us The Father, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 76 min wear those clothes in bad places. I'll just use them to preach the Gospel, everything that I can. And I'll do all that I know how to do for others. And I appreciate it...?... Now, the only thing I can say, is, "God reward you, sister, brother, whoever you are that gave those things." Yes, sir.

L-6 And I was just going to announce it last evening. I thought, "Well, I have this..." Maybe she was here, and I forgot about it. And I appreciate. Someone... And if there's anything, if anyone gives... Don't you feel that way about it? If it's something someone give you... And I've got a--a great person. I love outdoors, guns, knives, hunting, you know. That's where I found God as a little boy, wandering in the woods. And I always loved hunting. And someone... Sometimes a fellow give me a barrel of an old .22 rifle, about that long. And I took a piece of board and made a stock out of it. Why, I wouldn't sell that thing for nothing. Its value would be worth a dime, probably, maybe fifty cents. And I put a hammer on it and I fixed it up. But it's worth a thousand dollars to me. I remember the old brother that had it. And I... Just anything, no matter what it is, that anyone gives, anyone, it's... I cherish it greatly. Now, that... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] We're going right on through, I think, until about Thursday or Friday. Isn't that right, Brother...?... That'll be the longest meeting, I guess, I ever held in my life at any time. And so... Up here in this city. And I certainly haven't seen any place that I would have seen any more spiritual cooperation among the people. And fine faith is what I have found right here in this city. God bless each one of you. You'd be surprised. Just standing right here now, you can see thing after thing happening in the meeting (That's right.), of what's going on. If I could just only get the people to believe it with all their heart, soul, and mind. If they would do that, it would just be marvelous how God would... Now, many times, you can see what's going on. But to ta--say the person's healed, I couldn't say it. Now, I couldn't say until God shows me. I can only say what, everything. Just like the little lady here, telling her what, the man... If I would've had...

L-7 I believe that's the new little boy here. I don't believe. This is the first time--his first time he's been here isn't it? You been here before? Third night. I've never noticed him before to... Now, just a... Are you a believer, the parents? You believe with all your heart? Now, if you'll just believe me, I'll be able to tell you about the child. But now, its healing, I... 'less God tells me. Yes, I see the child. It looks like a spastic, but it wasn't. That child was injured at birth. Isn't that right? Is that what done it? That's right...?... Now, there's some kind of a connection between us now. You know, both of you; you feel real strange now, don't you? See? You've contacted that Spirit. Now, just be real reverent and believe with all your heart, you can have just what exactly what you ask for. If you can believe... But the first thing is to believe. You, I believe, I have said I seen the vision from...

L-8 There's a little lady, setting right there with a white looking dress on, young girl; you're trying your best for me to say something, aren't you, sister? Do you believe with all your heart? And when I walked on the platform awhile ago, you started praying, or something or another, didn't you? Because I turned around, I noticed you were praying or something. You were wanting me to tell you that what--what's wrong and what... Isn't that right? Let me go to telling you a little story. You're just a young woman. We know that by looking at you. But one time, there was a woman in the Bible, something of your nature, and she promised the Lord what she would do if the Lord would just bless her. Is that true? She goes up to the temple to pray about it one day (Is that right?), this woman. And the priest misunderstood her. And she prayed with such sincerity for God to take away her reproach, until she was misunderstood. Is that right? And the temp--priest of the temple came out and said, "The Lord grant to you your desire." And in nine months from then, she had her desire (Wasn't that right?), a little baby. God bless you, sister. And may God give you the child that you're desiring right there. Don't worry, mother. I believe that she'll embrace a child soon. Now, just have faith and believe with all your heart.

L-9 People down in this end of the row, look this a way and believe with all your heart. Here's a kind of a heavy set lady, setting here I just contact now by the Spirit of God. Sister, if I tell you what's wrong with you... I know... Yes, I see now. Here's what it is. You have difficult breathing. Isn't that right? Difficult breath, 50-0819, Show Us The Father, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 76 min you can't breathe good. If you'll do what I tell you to do and believe me as God's prophet...?... You know that you're a stranger. No way in the world that I'd know that except God. You believe in that? Would you go testifying that you're healed, and telling people you're healed? God will grant it. There's a man setting right next to you also with that white shirt on. He's in trouble also. Isn't that right, sir? Now, I don't know. Your trouble is in your arms. No, no it isn't. You have a prostate trouble for one thing. And you're having trouble in your... No, you got pleurisy. That's what it is. Isn't that right, sir? It's in your sides, along like that...?... That is right. Will you believe me as God's prophet? You know that you're a stranger to me. All right. You go and forget you ever had pleurisy. Testify of your healing, you shall have what you've asked for.

L-10 God, be merciful. Nervous and eye trouble, isn't it, sister, with your little girl? Have faith. She'll get over that and be all right. Amen. Do you believe too, sister, with that complication, cancer? Even everything else work on you, isn't that true? Yes, sir. All right. This lady setting here with this white looking collar on, you have complication. You have... You've had cancer also, haven't you? All right. Jesus heals you now. You're over that. You can go home and be free as you want to be. Don't fear about the girl's eyes there, sister. And your nervous trouble, also, that'll leave you and you'll be all right. God bless you, sister, and have mercy. Just have faith. Just believe. Down in this a way, every one look and believe. Have faith. All right, sir, you setting there with your short sleeves on there, with eyes and ear trouble. Isn't that right? You believe me? All right. Testify that you're healed, and God will make you well, and heal you right now if you'll just believe it. Oh, dear brother, sister, anywhere, God is here. He can just make known...

L-11 Let us pray just now. Our heavenly Father, many are the afflictions of Your people, but It says, "The Lord delivereth them out of them all." Oh, time would not permit how that You could sweep over this audience, one from the other, speaking to them. Lord, surely the people would know that Your servant, standing here with not an earthly way, knowing that there's a spiritual contact between these people and Thy servant. And I'm trying to tell them it's Your Divine gift that was sent down from glory to manifest Your Presence. As You told Nathanael, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the tree, I knew you." You told the woman about her sins. You told them where to find the mules. You knew where the fish was that had a coin in his mouth. You know all things, and You reveal them to us as we serve You. And we know You said, "These things that I do, greater shall you, for I go unto My Father." And Your Spirit is here tonight, manifesting.

L-12 Father, help me as I speak the Word. May the Word now go forth with power and bring forth a results that'll start this audience, every one--the cripples to walk, the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak. May they leave here rejoicing, happy, shouting, glorifying You. And may tomorrow be a new day, a dawn that when blind sees, and the deaf hear, lame walk, cancers are gone away, weariness of flesh, faith is in, Jesus rules and reigns, all doubt is gone. Grant it, Father. Bless You Thy people. We're gathering together here at the end of the week to serve You and to bless Thy Name through praise and thanksgiving. For we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-13 Now, everyone now, I want you to listen real closely while I speak for a few moments. Don't doubt, just have faith to believe that... I want to read in Saint John, the 14th chapter, you that have your Bibles. I wish to speak just for a few moments. And I believe God's going to give us a breakthrough tonight. I believe it's on the audience. You feel better now, don't you, brother and sister. The little lady right there in front. But just have faith now. Just believe with all your heart. All right. Let not your hearts be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house there are many mansions: if it wasn't so, I would have told you. And I go and prepare a place for you. 50-0819, Show Us The Father, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 76 min ... if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, to receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. Where I know... where I go you know, and the way you know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not where thou goest, and how can we know the way? Jesus said unto him, I am the way... truth, and the life: no man cometh to the Father but by me. If you had known me, you should have known my Father also... from henceforth you know him, and have seen him. Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.

L-14 I want to use that for a just a little text, for a few moments. Then we want to come back into the healing service again. Just to speak to you on the Word, "Show Us The Father And It Suffices." In other words, "It'll satisfy us if You'll show us the Father." Now, I want... How many would like to really see God, that wants to here, would like to see God? All right. "Show Us The Father And It'll Satisfy Us." Now, that... I want to speak to you just quickly if possible upon some ways to see God, and how to see Him. And if... God, if I can, by the Scripture, and by the wonders and signs, prove to you Who God is, and where He's at, will you believe me? Will you believe me? All right. "Show us the Father and it'll satisfy us."

L-15 I'm going to take about four ways to see God. Then we'll come down and make it, in the last part of it, a way where you'll be--have to see God. I'm going to show Him to you, if I can, by the help of the Spirit tonight in four different manners. Now first, we want to speak of God in His universe, and God in His Word, God in His Son, then God here in His people. I want to show you God in His universe, show you God in His Word, show you God in His Son, then see God here in His people. Then that ought to satisfy any of us, surely.

L-16 Let's bow our heads. Eternal God, the Author of Life and Giver of every good gift, as we now have opened up the Word and read It, the Words that fell from Your beloved Son Jesus. We know they're eter--eternally true, and that they're infinite. There's nothing more truer than God's Word. And we love It. Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing of the Word. And now, Father, that the people may be established now, may be settled upon the Word, the solid Foundation, that is, if Satan should come to them in any manner, they could flee to the Word. "It is written."... Now, Father, help us tonight and open the Word to us, and open our understanding. Circumcise the lips of Your servant that speaks, and circumcise the hearts of the people that the Word may fall in, that It may fall in rich fertile ground and bring forth a hundredfold. And may there not be a feeble one among us after tonight. May it be over tonight, every one with faith, Father. Grant it. And now, may the Holy Spirit take the things of God and deliver them right out to the people, for we ask it in the Name of the Son of God, Jesus Christ. Amen.

L-17 That's the aged old cry: "If I could only find God." The... All ages, people are born to worship. You'll worship something. Maybe it's your child, your car, your home, your job, maybe even your church. That will not work. It isn't the church we worship; it's God. The caveman, the Indians, the American Indian, we found that he worshipped the sun. And he believed there was a happy hunting ground. When one died, they put the corn and so forth, his bow and arrow, and sent him out across the sea somewhere in his canoe, that he would find the happy hunting ground where he would have provisions to carry him over. There's something in the human heart that calls out for a worship, somewhere. No man is on earth without worship. He worships something.

L-18 Jesus told the woman at the well, "You worship, ye know not what. We know salvation's of the Jew." Now, worship is not all we desire. There is a provided way of worship. Did you know that? See? There's a way to worship, and a way, right way to worship and the wrong way to worship. I'm not trying to tell you which way to worship; but I'm telling you; there's a way that you have to approach God. And if you do not come that provided way, 50-0819, Show Us The Father, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 76 min you certainly cannot find God. There's a way for me to go home, not across the field, shortcut; go the highway. That's what was made; it's provided for me. God don't have any shortcuts. We all come the same way. That's right. No shortcuts to glory. We must come the way.

L-19 Look in the beginning when Cain and Abel were turned from the garden, their parents, and they both seen they were mortal beings and knowed they had to die... Look. Cain and Abel, both of them wanted to worship God. And Cain, he built an altar to God. Now, if an altar is all that God requires, Cain was justified. And Cain made a sacrifice upon the altar. Is that right? Well, if a sacrifice and an altar is all God wants, Cain was justified. Then Cain also he built an altar, and he worshipped; he put a sacrifice on it, and he knelt down and worshipped God. But God was displeased, because he didn't come the right way. See, he built a church, an altar; he put a sacrifice on the altar, brought the fruits of the land, was probably the--more beautiful. You must watch this, friend. Don't never forget this.

L-20 Brother Gordon told me I could have this little privilege tonight, as it was, to speak to the people awhile just before we make the final outpush for the ending of the services. Notice, it refreshes me to speak on the Word. It helps me. It keeps me... Sometime under that anointing, It falls on me. And then I stay under there for a long time, I get so weak I can hardly stand. But preaching never bothers me. I love to talk of the Word. Notice. Then... Reason I was calling those people a few minutes ago, and different ones, and I see another one come right now, that's healed right now. But the reason I was doing that, is because that you might know that His Spirit is here now. He's in the building now. See?

L-21 But now, back to Cain and Abel, when Cain worshipped, he built an altar; he sacrificed; he worshipped God. But that wasn't enough. And it was beautiful, no doubt the flowers and things that grows in the field, and he decorated his altar. Why soon, as soon as Easter come, across the nations there'll be million dollars spent for Easter flowers that go on the altar. Well, God don't care about that Easter flower on the altar. He wants you on the altar. You're the person for the altar, not your flower, or your money; He wants you. The altar was built for you to sacrifice your own will to His will. See? Well, then... But if an altar, sacrifice, worship is all that God requires, then you'll have to say Cain was justified. And watch that beauty. Now, that's right in our--many of our Full Gospel churches coming right into it. See? They want to build a little better church, put a few thousand dollars in a pipe organ. That doesn't bring God in. That might bring people. But self-sacrifice brings God in--to the will of God. See?

L-22 And remember, in glory the first thing that ever caused the first sin, that Satan wanted a little better things than what Michael had, went over and set himself up a--a better, beau--more beautiful kingdom. See? That's beauty. Here it falls right down into his son, Cain, coming right on down. And he decorated his altar, beautiful. But here comes Abel dragging a little old lamb behind him. I don't see nothing so pretty about that. They didn't have any ropes in them days, I guess, so they had a vine, maybe, wrapped around his neck, because it was--it was Christ. That's Who It was. For they led Him away like a La--Lamb to the slaughter. They put a rope around his neck. And here he come, leading this little lamb, bleating, pulling back. He laid him upon a rock. Perhaps didn't have any sharp knives in them days. Probably took an old sharp rock, and held his little head back, and begin to beat his little throat; Abel did. See? And the blood begin to spurt out of his little arteries in his neck. Did you ever hear a lamb dying? Most pathetic thing you ever heard is to hear a lamb die. How it bleeds and bleats.

L-23 God looking down out of heaven said, "That's what it takes." The blood speaking, what did it speak of? Years after that, the Lamb of God was led away. Blood... You're the blood of your father and mother. But being borned again, you become the Blood of God, the Blood of Christ cleansing us. 50-0819, Show Us The Father, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 76 min And there He was, the Lamb of God, hanging up there on Calvary, bleeding, bleating, His bloody locks dripping from His head upon His shoulders, the blood spatting everywhere. I believe, like Billy Sunday said in that hour, said, "There's Angels setting in every bush, said, 'Just turn Your hand away. Point to us, and we'll destroy this mob.'" Some of them said, "He saved Himself... He saved others and Himself He cannot save," criticizing. That was the greatest tribute was ever paid Him. He couldn't save Hisself and others, so He gave Hisself to save others. There is the way. There brought down the results standing there for the Holy Spirit coming through the Blood, the Life brings the human today in contact with God.

L-24 Everybody wanted to find God down through the age. Job of old, he said, "Oh, if I only knew where He was." In his trouble setting there on the ash heap scraping his boils... God dealing with a saint in this case... There he was setting there scraping his boils. Some of his church friends come to him, set with their backs turned to him, not much consolation. But Job wanted to know, "Oh, if I only knew where His house was. (In other words.) If I'd go knock on His door, He'd come out and talk to me." That's what he wanted to do. But notice, when a man is hungering and thirsting for God, God will draw nigh to the man always. See? Give up, surrender your will to God. Then when his church members came and could not console him, accused him to being a secret sinner, said he'd sinned before God... Job knew he had not sinned, and he knew he was all right. But then God sent a young man down by the name of Elihu, come down to meet Job, perfect type of Christ again. He didn't accuse Job of being a secret sinner. He tried to tell him of Someone Who would come and stand in the breach in the last days, to put his hands upon a sinful man and upon a holy God and bridge the way.

L-25 Job, being a prophet, caught the vision. He stood up. Lightnings begin to flash; thunders begin to roar. The prophet had come in contact with his Father, God. He turned and said, "I know my Redeemer liveth. At the last days, He'll stand upon the earth. Though the skin worms destroys this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God, Whom I shall see for myself. My eyes shall behold, and not another." Soul calling out for God, God in His universe...

L-26 Recently I was watching. I love birds. I was watching some eagles here not long ago when I was on a fishing trip, an old mother eagle, setting way on top of a mountain. And she threw her wings out, and the little eagles caught ahold of her wings, and she went down into the valley. It was the first time they'd ever been out of that old nest. Reminds me there. Could you see God there? Yes, a sinner. Now, this is kind of... Did you ever... The things of the world is like a eagle's nest: full of sticks, and thorns, vomit. The eagles are regurgitators, and they vomit their food, smell. And a sinner that's living in the nest of the world, among the vomit of the world, barrooms, and walking around, knowing nothing about anything else but the old nest of the world... Then I seen her take her little ones, and they caught ahold of her wings, and she went down the mountain into the valley, throwed out her big wings and the little eagles let loose. They begin to run around, their little feet touched for the first time upon soft ground, upon the grass. They eat green grass. "He leads me beside still water." Oh, my, how glorious and wonderful.

L-27 Then, notice closely, when he was--they did that, then the little eagles... The old mother eagle, when she seen that, what was... She went plumb back up into the top of the mountains again, set down upon the rocks, begin to look down, watching those little eagles. And I begin to think, "My, doesn't that seem like..." Some little girl's sick. One of the elders, will you please run over and have prayer with the little girl; she fell in her chair. And then... Now, notice closely; pay attention this way. The little girl's got sick and some of them going to have prayer with her. I think she has a card in her hand, be in the line probably in a few moments. All right.

L-28 Notice closely now. But the old mother eagle setting up there begin to watch. I thought, "How glorious that Jesus came, taking us out of the things of the world, put us out in this glorious freedom out here." Them little eagles, running carefree, eating grass and so forth, just like glorious old time Holy Ghost meeting, when the saints of God have come 50-0819, Show Us The Father, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 76 min out of the things of the world, down on the green carpet of God's blessings, carefree. Our Saviour has climbed the ramparts of glory. His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me. He knows everything. All times, He knows what's wrong with you. There, she was watching. I noticed her. I picked her up through my binoculars. And I seen her turn that big head sideways and look. I thought, "What's the matter?" She's setting. She watches over those little eagles. There's God in His creation again, God in His universe. I thought, "What would happen if a coyote would happen to run in towards those little eagles, what would take place?" Why, that old mother would be there after them in a moment.

L-29 After while, I seen her hold her head up, and she looked up, and she made a squall. All at once, she darted from that mountain, down into the valley. And when she went down there, she threw forth those great majestic wings and let out a scream. When she did, every one of those little eagles left off eating, run as quickly as they could to their mother, grabbed their little bill ahold of her wings, like that, with their bill, put their little feet in them wings. I wondered what was the matter. I couldn't see it yet. But across the mountain come a hurricane that she could smell in the air and knew it was coming. She was watching over her brood. And then, before she could get off the ground, the storm was already sweeping down through the hollow. When she did, she pierced that storm blowing at sixty miles an hour. Those little eagles holding on to that mother's wings. And right into the cleft of the rocks she went. I thought, "O God, one of these hours there's coming a scream from heaven; the trumpet of God shall sound, and every Christian shall fly on to the wings of the old rugged cross, piercing the storms of life out into the cleft in the Rock, Christ Jesus." Oh, my. God in His nature, watch Him in His universe. Just in a moment, how He can take us, no matter how hard the trial is, just hold on to His wings, and He'll bear you away. Watch God in His birds, and how He cares for it. Watch God in the sunset.

L-30 Not long ago, there was an infidel passed through the lands making infidels out of supposingly to be Christians. He was so educated, till the ministers was afraid to attacked him. And then he went to Europe. On his road back he got broke down. He went out into the west to make him a rest. And one day while he walked out from his camp, oh, he swelled himself out. He begin to look. Down there come that whispering of the wind, down through the pines, and he begin to look up. He looked at those rocks hanging in the mountain. He said, "O rocks, Who put you in the mountains? Have I been wrong about the chronology of this world?" All of a sudden God begin to speak. The Bible said, "If they hold their peace, the rocks will cry out." God in His universe, speaking from His rock. Well, that infidel knelt down by the side of a tree, said, "O God, have mercy on my soul." There you are. Their pastors were afraid to attack him. God could let the rocks speak out. God's in His universe, speaking to His people.

L-31 I've seen the sunset. Stand and cry like a baby, just couldn't help it. Glorious to see God in His sunset and His sunrise. God's in His animals. You go out here and look at the paper this winter. And the papers say, "Tomorrow is going to be fair." And all the news commentators say it's going to be fair. Watch that old sow take the shucks off of the--the north side of the hill, and take them around on the south side and make her bed. Don't you believe what the paper says. No, sir. It'll be cold just as sure as the world. Go out to hunt and find a rabbit going down underneath in the fallow row. Watch for snow and cold weather. Sure. They got a God-given instinct.

L-32 Not long ago... I go up into the mountains to hunt. And in there, there's a... Many times these ducks come out of down in Louisiana, go up into the north and make their nest up there in the slime in Canada and around. And they lay their eggs and hatch them. And when they hatch their eggs, in among those group of ducks there's a little duck that's born that's a leader, a little drake. Just as soon as the first cold breeze sweeps down across the mountains, that little old duck will run right out in the middle of the pond. He's never been off that pond in all of his life. He was born there. He'll run right out there and stick 50-0819, Show Us The Father, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 76 min his little old honker up in the air and honk four or five times. Every duck on the pond will come to him. "What's the matter?" God has given ducks instinct. That's right. They know that that little old duck is borned a leader. Something's going to happen. There's a cold breeze a blowing. The trouble of it is, when the cold breeze blows, man won't listen to his Leader, which is God.

L-33 This little old duck, all of them will get right around him. He'll raise off of that water. Never been off of there in his life, and go just as straight to Louisiana as he can go, to the rice fields to dodge all the cold weather, because God's given him a provided way to detect. He's never been off of there. He has no compass. He don't trust a compass; he's trusting instinct that God's give him. If a... We ought to have "duck sense" anyhow. If God could give a duck enough instinct to dodge the cold and go to safety, how much more ought He give His church with the baptism of the Holy Ghost to trust God. God in His nature, God provided a duck with instinct. God provided you with the Holy Spirit. He's your Leader. He's here now tonight to save you, to heal you. God in His nature, in His universe...

L-34 One day, my dad and I were plowing, and the horses begin to snort. I said, "What's the matter with them, dad?" He said, "Son, there's a storm coming." I said, "Oh, my. Dad, look at how clear it is." He said, "God has so provided that horses has an instinct. They can smell storms for miles away." And we hadn't made two more rounds till we had to hurry to the barn. The horses seen it, knew it. They could detect it by an instinct before there was a sign of anything you could see with any other sense. Oh... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] the Holy Spirit. Oh, church of God, you who claim to kiss the blessings of the rim of the cup of blessings, how can you doubt God, Who is almighty and omnipotent, Who stands now to bless and to heal every person in this building? Why? How could you doubt Him? When men, through the age, is the only people that's ever amount to anything is those who dare to take the stand for God. Many things how God provides...

L-35 How bears is my favorite hunting. The old mother bear, she... In the fall of the year when mating season, they'll go up into the mountains. There she'll eat hemlock cones, and she never eats anything else. Her stomach is all shrunk up to just about big as my fist. Summertime, it'll hold five gallons. And it shrinks up. She stand over the back. The little ones are born about February. She never wakes up. She maybe has anywhere from two to four little bears. And she never knows nothing about it until about May when she wakes up, and her cubs are great big fellows then. Never eats a bite, and those little bears nurse from her. What is it? God's provided way. That's right. God makes a way.

L-36 Not long ago, there was a little preacher, a little minister in a nearby city. And he thought maybe that he knew lots about the--the thing. There's a little boy that went to his church; he asked his mother, "If a..." Wait. All right. I guess they're going to take the little girl out to, maybe it get blessed or something, take it... Going out to the prayer tent? All right. All right now, notice. That's all right. All right. We notice, this little boy, he went to his pastor, and he said, "Pas..." Or, he asked his mother first. That's a good way. God healed you. Go and give your heart to Him then. Isn't that right? Good way to do.

L-37 Now, notice. The pastor... First, the little boy asked his pastor, said, "Pastor, I have heard you speak so much of God, could anybody see God?" Well, the pastor said, "No, honey." Said, "Nobody can see God and live." Well, he was just a boy. And he asked his mother, and his mother didn't know. He asked his Sunday school teacher; she didn't know. Said, "No one could see God." He was so disappointed. He used to stay up on the river near the six mile island up there. There's an old fisherman there that had long white beard. He hung around with this old man.

L-38 One day, up the river they were, and a storm came up. And after the storm, they came down the river. Any boatman here knows what the rhythm of oaring your boat and feel of the waves tip the oars, you know. And the old 50-0819, Show Us The Father, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 76 min man looked around, the sun had come out. There was a rainbow setting. The leaves were all washed off and pretty. The old man kept pulling his boat; tears begin to roll down his cheeks. He'd pulled a little farther and looked back again. The little fellow setting in the stern of the boat become so enthused till he run up in the middle of the boat, and he said, "Sir, I'm going to ask you a question my mother couldn't answer, my father couldn't answer, my pastor, my Sunday school teacher. No one could answer me." Said, "I believe there is a God." And said, "Could I ever see Him?" It was too much for the old fisherman. He just pulled his oars in, threw his hands to his face and wept like a baby. He reached and put his arms around the little boy, and said, "God bless your heart, honey. All I've seen for the past thirty-five years has been God."

L-39 Why, sure. There was so much God on the inside, he could see Him on the outside. If you want to see God in His universe, get Him on the inside. Watch how the birds sing different in the trees. Even your enemy looks different when God comes on the inside. He's in His universe. He's in you looking out, showing you the magnificent part of His universe. (Quickly, we'll hurry.) God in His universe, you believe He is? Did you ever see Him in a sunset? Did you ever see Him in a sunrise? Ever see Him in the beautiful mountains? Oh, my. Sometimes I get there and look down upon the scene and just scream to the top of my voice. I can't help it. There's a deep calling to the deep out there. God in His universe... How we could stand here for hours and speak of Him, how God speaks out of His universe.

L-40 Now, let's take secondly, quickly, so we can get to it: God in His Word. How many believes God's in His universe? All right. You can see Him in His universe. Let's see if He's in His Word. He said, "My Word is Life." Truly, Life... Now, the only thing, the Word... The letter killeth; the Spirit giveth Life. What I trust now with all my heart, that God will quicken ("Quicken" means "make alive."), quicken the Word to you now by His Spirit. Jesus said, "A sower went forth and sowed seeds. And while he slept, another sower came by and sowed tares." And He went ahead and told the parable. The disciples could not understand Him. Jesus explained to them. He said, "The sower is the Son of man. The field is the earth. And the Seed is the Word of God." Amen. Notice, "The Seed is the Word of God." If it's... Whatever God's Word says, It's a seed.

L-41 Now, the way to raise a crop, is first get the ground ready. Is that right? Take out all the stink weeds, and the briars, the creepers. That's unbelief and doubt. Sweep it out of your heart. Get ready. Then the field's broke up. I'm not very much on this dry-eyed repentance. I like to see a man come down before God, say, "I'm sorry, Father. Receive me." Broke up, the ground ready for the Word... Notice, then any Divine promise of God is a Seed. And that Seed in the right ground, will produce its kind. Corn will bring corn. Barley will bring barley. Wheat will bring wheat. And any Divine promise of God will bring the results, if it's placed in the ground, and there watered with faith, prayer, trust, God shall bring it to pass. I'm saying with experience.

L-42 I'm thinking now that the best doctors the United States' got, two years ago, said, "Reverend Branham, there's not a chance for you." Oh, it makes my heart sing "Amazing Grace! how sweet the sound, saved a wretch like me. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] There, setting in Mayo's clinic. They said, "You broke yourself, boy. You'll never come out of it." I turned the old Word. "Whatsoever things you desire, when you pray, believe that you receive them and you shall have them." I said, "Father, place them in my heart. I shall water them with faith day and night; tonight I stand in perfect health." Once a blind man, led me by my arms. I couldn't see a thing, just objects in front of me moving, only daylight was dark. And tonight, my eyes test 20/20. Why? I took God's Word. No one with a gift to cast the spirit away, the Word will do it, faith in God's Word.

L-43 Jesus had all the fine qualities of God in Him. Do you believe it? He had powers upon powers. But when He met Satan, He never used His power. He give an example for the weakest of Christians. When He met Satan, He said, "It is written. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God." The weakest 50-0819, Show Us The Father, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 76 min Christian can take that stand. Hold it. Sure, God's in His Word. Every time when He would meet the enemy, He said, "It is written." I believe He had power to do it. But He met Satan on the same grounds with the same Word that you can meet him with, every one, "It's written." You believe it? Why, it's written. "Whatsoever things you desire, when you pray, believe you receive them." Watch the order of the Word. Believe now (present tense) you receive it, and you shall have it. It'll be given to you later, but believe it now. Before you can get your crop, you got to plant the seed. Water it. Believe it. Don't dig it up every morning to see if it's... Every time you dig it up, you'll delay it that much more. It'll never grow if you keep digging it up.

L-44 When you settle it in your heart that God's healed you, sister; you, little boy; you, brother; any of you, settle it in your heart and believe. Take God at His Word and start testifying about it. Give it plenty of water; fertilize it. Watch what takes place. The Word of God will produce just exactly what It says. If that's not the inspired Word of God, I wouldn't be standing here. I wouldn't believe in it. But I know It's the truth. Heavens and earth will pass away, but My Word shall not pass away. "I the Lord have planted it; I'll water it day and night 'less some should pluck it from My hand." There you are, God in His Word. God speaks anything, He means it. God says it. Then there'll be so many things and such things, and it was. God said, "Let there be light." Light sprang from somewhere from the Creator. God said, "Let there be this," and it was this. "Let it be that," and it was that. What God said is seeds. God's in His Word. You believe it?

L-45 He said, "Tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high. I'm going to send you the promise of the Father." Yes. That was God's Word. Christ was the Word. Oh, in the beginning was the Word; the Word was with God; and the Word was God; and the Word was made flesh and dwelled among us. You say, "Well, God said the commandments, and God said this." Everything that Christ said was the Word of God: Father in the Son, speaking through Him. "Tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high." My, God's in His Word, manifest Hisself.

L-46 He told a man, "Go wash in the Pool of Siloam (Sent.) And the man washed in the pool and obeyed the Word, come back clean. God's in His Word. You believe that? God is in His universe. God is in His Word. God will confirm His Word. Up there on the day of Pentecost, when they were all gathered in one place, afraid, cowards, setting in behind the walls, walled in a little room, but they had a commandment not to leave Jerusalem until they were endued with power from on high. There they are, a hundred and twenty gathered in the upper room, fastened the doors, pulled down the windows, if there was any. Then all of a sudden there came a sound from heaven like of a little rushing mighty wind. And It filled all the house where they were setting. Out into the streets they went. They didn't care about their human prestige. There was all the aristocrats from all over the country gathered there at the day of Pentecost. They went into the streets staggering, swinging their arms, and acting like a bunch of maniacs. Say that's wrong and you deny the Bible. The Bible said they were drunk.

L-47 And listen, women, you who think because you got your name on the church, it's all right. The virgin Mary was with them, acting like a drunk woman. And if God would not permit the mother of God to come into heaven without receiving the Holy Ghost, how are you going to go in anything less than that? Is that right? You'll pay the way with the Lord's despised few. They said, "Why, these men are full of new wine." There, the women and all of them... Did you ever see a man drunk? Everything's all right with him, staggering, butting against things. "That's all right." See? Drunk. Said, "Be not us drunk upon strong drink, biteth like an adder, stingeth like a serpent. But be drunk upon the Spirit," drunk. So in drunk with the love of God till you can forget all about the 50-0819, Show Us The Father, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 76 min past, only know what God is doing now. Live for today. God in His Word... Yes, sir.

L-48 Then notice, when they were all cutting up like that and acting that way, and all of them, they stood by laughing, making fun of them. The critics never all died back there. They might've, but the spirit lives on. Notice this. Then Peter, a little old fellow didn't know his abc's (He couldn't sign his own name. The Bible said he was a ignorant and unlearned man.), stood on a soap box, or a stump, or something, said, "You men of Judaea, and you that dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known unto you and hearken to my words; for these are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it's the third hour of the day; but this is that." Back to the Word. "This is that which was spoke of by the prophet Joel, 'It shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I'll pour out My Spirit upon all flesh.'" Brother, Peter said, "This is that." If this ain't that, I'm going to keep this till that comes anyhow. Yes, sir. For I believe this is that that was spoke of. God in His Word speaking to the people. God said He would do it. God will do it. You take God's Word and see.

L-49 Then to confirm the Word, He sends His prophets; He sends His signs; He sends His wonders. And even in all of that, when God will move down into an audience and reveal the very secrets of a man's heart, tell him the things to do after the Word saying it first, which is the foundation, then the prophet comes and reveals the secrets of his heart and tell him what to do, then you mean to tell me you'd be afraid? Why, my. I'm saying now that God has double confirmed it. That's right. God in His universe, God in His Word... Now, quickly, let's take God in His Son. You believe God was in Christ? I believe it with all my heart. The Bible said that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself. He was Emmanuel. In other words, He was the expressed image of Jehovah here on earth, as Jehovah inveiled in flesh, living here on the earth, the only begotten of the Father, from His bosom.

L-50 Notice, God becoming flesh that He might suffer the penalty of sin, for He was the One Who pronounced sin. He was the...?... One pronounced this penalty upon sin. And He couldn't have some individual person besides Hisself. It wouldn't be right for me to say, "My wife will take your place, my boy, my brother, anybody else." If I'm just and sovereign, I take your place. And God had to come down in His Son, Christ Jesus, to suffer. That's right. And God's Blood bled from His body. Yes, sir. God was in His Son. He eat like a man. That's right. He spoke like a man (That's right.) when He would talk to people. But I tell you, when some people come to take Him, one time, some soldiers, they went back and said, "Never a man spake like this." He was a man, but that was God speaking out of Him. When He was standing, as I said the other day, by the side of Lazarus' grave, tears rolling down His cheeks, He was a man. But when He said, "Lazarus, come forth," and a man been dead four days come back to life again, that was God speaking out of His Son. Yes, sir.

L-51 He was a God-man. I believe He was the--the infinite Son of God, borned of the virgin Mary. That's right. Everything the Bible said He was, I believe He was. When He was on earth, He looked like God; He talked like God; He--He preached like God; He rose like God; He ascended like God. He, God was in Him, God manifested here in a body of flesh on the earth in a form, His Son, Christ Jesus. Notice. God was in His Son. He was always... God deals back there in the beginning. When He was with the Israelites, coming through the wilderness, there was a rock going along there, following them, a spiritual rock. And God told Moses, "Smite the rock, and it'll bring forth water." What was it? He smote it with the rod that was in his hand. That rod wasn't Moses' rod; that was God's rod, the judgment. And he smote the rock, and the rock brought forth water.

L-52 And when one time they wanted a drink, they went to the rock. When they wanted something to eat, they went down and a bunch of bees had a hive in there. In the rock there was a cleft. God stood in the cleft. The bees had their nest in the cleft. Anything they had need of, they went to the rock. And the Bible clearly teaches that Christ was that Rock that was in the wilderness. If you're thirsty tonight, go to the Rock. If you want honey, sweetness, go to the Rock. If you want life, go to the Rock. 50-0819, Show Us The Father, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 76 min If you want to believe God was in His Son, go to the Rock. He was in the Rock. Speak to the Rock, and It'll bring forth Its waters. There you are, God in His Son.

L-53 One day, there was some people down there trusting God's Word down in Babylon. Let's watch it just a few moments. And oh, I can see a great thing happening. There'd been an issue made, that anybody that went down there and begin to worship any other God, or didn't bow down to what the government said, would have to be throwed into a fiery furnace. There was three boys there, four of them, three of them mainly, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego. They decided they was not going to bow down to any image. They were going to serve the true God. They believed His Word. All right. Notice. They found out that these boys, they wouldn't bow down. So they het the furnace according to the king's commandments, seven times hotter than it ever was het. Said, "We'll burn that religion out of them." You can't burn the Holy Ghost out of a man. Why, It's fire Itself. You can't burn It. They took Brother John the Revelator, boiled him in a vat in--of grease for twenty-four hours. They thought he was a witch.

L-54 Some man came here at the temple, the other day, or the place, said, "Hey..." Brother started to give him a card down there, and he was laughing. Some of the ministers was telling me about it. Said, "It..." He said, "I come to get my fortune told." Oh, my. They thought John was a--bewitched the grease. It wasn't John bewitching the grease; it was the Holy Ghost had him bound up. The grease couldn't burn him. These Hebrew children believed God's Word. They said, "God is able to deliver us from the fiery furnace. But nevertheless, we're not bowing down to your image." Oh, if we could just get some Shadrachs in this building. Said, "I don't see no difference in you. Go over there and somebody prayed for you. I don't see no difference." "You can say what you want to, but I'm not bowing down to your unbelief. I'm taking God at His Word." That's right. God's in His Word.

L-55 Let's notice this scene, being we started it just a moment. God help us for a minute now to see God, how He will reward. We get away from the subject just for a second. I can see morning come. Let's dramatize this a moment. I can see the furnace. The skies look like turning black and red. That furnace was burning. I can see king Nebuchadnezzar set on his throne. Said, "We'll just burn up that bunch of holy-rollers out there and stop all this fuss." Step back out there, "We're getting tired of all this here carrying on around here anyhow." All right. I can see them getting ready now to heat the furnace, bring out Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, bound their hands behind them. Three men with long spears begin to march them up, where they went up to the top of the cupola to drop in. My, don't you think that when you take Christ as your Saviour, as your Healer, that the devil won't put the heat on you? He sure will. Yes, sir. Just watch him.

L-56 Remember, I've warned every one of you, within seventy-two hours, what would take place. The Bible said, "When the unclean spirit's gone out of a man, he walks in dry places, then returns again (Is that right?), with seven other devils worse then he was." Be careful. Let the good Man of the house be standing there with faith warring him away, telling him he can't come. Refuse to see it; refuse to have it, or anything else. Stay right with it. Notice. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] was...?... They started a death march going up there. They're going to burn up these loyal believers in God, one that trust God's Word. They're going up to the--be burnt up. They walk up. You know it. I can hear Shadrach say to Meshach, "Are you--are you sure we're all prayed up?" I can hear him say, "Yes, I got the victory. Let's go on." Amen. That's the way to do it. Marched right on just a little farther, kept going, going. They got almost there, they begin to get a little faint. I can hear him say, "All right, are you ready now? "Yes, we're ready."

L-57 These fellows pushing them, holding their heads back, get right up. Just one more step now and away they go, 50-0819, Show Us The Father, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 76 min down into the fiery furnace to be consumed. Why, the men that was standing plumb behind them, died of the intense heat. The length of a spear (Probably half of that pole or more.) behind them, died. Goes to show that God was right with them on the march. He'll be right with you from this night on when you take Him. Just stand on His Word and believe He's in His Word and in His Son. Here they go, marching on, right up to the edge. Watch, one more step and in there they go.

L-58 Our picture looks pretty dark right now for believers, doesn't it? Let's just turn our camera, or our binoculars, and look up. You know, all the time there's something going on on earth, there's something going on in heaven. I can see Him. Let's look at Him a moment. I can see Him setting on His throne (Oh, my.), His priestly robes all around Him. I can see coming to His right, a noise. What is it? Let's call It Gabriel, the great Archangel, run up to the side of Him, pulled His sword, said, "Master, have You looked down in Babylon? Three true believers are meeting their end. Have You beheld them? I've obeyed You all since You created me. Let me go down; I'll change the scene just in a few moments." I believe He could, don't you? Yes, I believe He could.

L-59 That big sword pulled, and David seen Him with it--Joshua seen Him when he crossed the river. Said, "I'm the captain of the Host of the Lord. I've seen that sword drawn." Said, "Lord, let me go down, Master." I can hear Him say, "Gabriel, You've been a good Angel. Since the day I created You, You have obeyed Me. But I just can't let You go." I can see Gabriel put His sword back into the sheath, take--stand attention to His side. Oh, my. Everything in the heaven obeyed Him. That's right. All but the heart of men, they don't want to obey Him. They don't want to believe Him.

L-60 Look, coming to the left, here comes another Angel. Look at Him. God has ministering Spirits, Angels. I believe on this One right here now not far. And He stood... What is His name? Wormwood: Bitter waters. I can hear Him say, "O Master, have You looked down into Babylon. Let me go down there this morning. You gave me the keys in the antediluvian destruction. I poured the waters over the earth." You know of... Woodworm has it, controls of all the waters of the earth, the Bible says. And there He says, "I'll go down and wash Babylon off the face of the earth." I believe He could've done it, don't you? Yes, sir. "Oh," He said, "Master look down there." I can hear Him say, "Woodworm, You have been a good Angel. You did obey Me and break up the springs of the deep, and so forth, and destroyed the world in the days of Noah. But I just can't let You go." I can see Woodworm taking His place again and stand at attention.

L-61 "Have You considered?" another Angel said. He said, "Yes, I've been watching them all night long." Oh, brother, if He was considered about three, He's considered about three thousand here tonight too. His eye is on the sparrow. He knows right now what you have need of. He knows why you've come to this meeting tonight. I can hear Him say, "I can't let You go, You fellows, because I'm going Myself." Oh, my. I can see Him rise. You think I'm crazy, don't you? You're going to call me holy-roller anyhow, so you might as well go do it. Notice. I love Him. I owe my life wrapped in Him. I see nothing but Him. I can see Him rise from His throne, His garments drop around Him, gets out there. And way back over in the north country, I see a big thunderhead. I can hear Him say, "Come here." Oh, my. I can hear Him say, "East wind, West, North, and South, come here." Everything minds Him. That's right. I can hear Him say, "Go over there and get under that thunderhead, and roll it over here. Here comes the East, North, South, and West winds, go under this big thunderhead. And here it comes, churning up at the side of the throne. I can see Him step off on that. Oh, my. Say, "Winds, I'm going to drive you like horses this morning. I'm going down into Babylon."

L-62 I can see Him reach up and get ahold of a zigzag lightning with His hands, pass by the Tree of Life and pick off a 50-0819, Show Us The Father, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 76 min branch. They made their last step, trusting God's Word. And about the time they stepped in, there was One like the Son of man, standing by their side (Hallelujah. Yes, sir.), with a palm, fanning away. Even with hot breezes down, talking with them. When king Nebuchadnezzar opened the doors, said, "How many did you put in?" Said, "Three." Said, "There's four. And one looks like the Son of God." He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. His powers cannot fail. He cannot. God is in His Son. Yes. You believe that? God is in His peoples. God is here tonight.

L-63 God manifested Hisself in His people on the day of Pentecost. When that old fisherman stood there and spoke that sermon, till he shook the stalactites of hell into the devil's eyes, and three thousand come into the Kingdom of God. The next day he preached again at the healing of a sick man laying at the gate, lame. He healed him, and five thousand souls swept into the Kingdom of God. God in His people... Yes, sir. I can see little Stephen standing there, a poor little fellow before about a half a million people in that great Sanhedrin court that morning. And the Bible said his face showed like an Angel. God was in His people. He said, "Oh, you stiffnecked, uncircumcised of heart and ears, why do you resist the Holy Ghost? Like your fathers did, so do you." And they gnashed upon him. And when they stoned him to death, him with his little head in the bosoms of God, and said, "I see Jesus standing at the right hand of God."... God rocked him to sleep on His bosom, like a mother rocking a baby. God's in His people.

L-64 I can see that old fisherman without a grammar school education, or without even could sign his own name, a ignorant and unlearned man, with so much God in him, till the peoples passing through the streets wanted his shadow to pass over them. Every one was healed. Why? God in His people. Hallelujah. ...?... said when he come to the cross, when they were going to kill him, he said, "Only one regret that I have; I haven't got five lives to give for the glory of God." God in His people... Yes, sir. When they went to kill, the apostle Peter said, "Turn my feet up, my head down. I'm not worthy to die like my Lord." Oh, my. Andrew's cross, how he... They'd killed him; how they'd burn them to stakes. They fed them to lions. They sawed them asunder. They put them in jail. They told them they were crazy. They shut the doors. They've run them out of the cities. And God lives on in His people. Some...

L-65 April the 6th, 1909, when the sun begin to peep up over a little Kentucky hill, a little old mother setting there, fourteen years old, in a little old crude made bed, no floor but the earth. All the stuff, a little table, a little old straw tick laying there to lay on, a little old shuck pillow for her to lay their head on... My daddy with his pair of overalls on, standing at the foot of the bed... But God permitted me to come into the earth. As the morning star was peeping across the mountains, coming circling into the window, came a supernatural Being whirling into the room when the mountain people standing begin to cry. Oh, my. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Years after that, standing in a little old room one night, cold, praying with all my heart, here come the supernatural Being, His august Being lit the room like the morning sun shining. He spoke to me, in a scream, "Come, fear not. I'm with you." (Hallelujah.) "You're to take a message of Divine healing to the peoples of the world."
