--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Thank you, Brother Baxter. [Someone says something to Brother Branham--Ed.] Okay, that's fine. Thanks a lot. I went out to get a--a sandwich, and I liked not to got back in time. It's a... I know it's very hot in the building, tonight, and we are--we are in sympathy with you, but we love you with all our hearts, because that you have cooperated so, and come out in these hot meetings, like this to--to glorify our Lord Jesus. And we thank you from the depths of our souls. Brother Baxter's just telling me that they'd taken a--a love offering for me awhile ago. If it's all right with you... While I was off, from overseas, I went a lot in debt, about four thousand dollars, five nearly, with the thousand I had to borrow to send forth on this. I... Usually, what I don't use for my family's use, exactly, I put it in to missionary work to take me back to the other countries. Now, it may be, I don't know, but may be that I'll have to use some of it, just what I don't use for eating, and so forth, to help pay that debt off. I'm sure that'd be all right with you. Will it? It's for a...?... [Congregation responds.--Ed.] Thank you very much. God bless you. I... Anything that I can do to help you at any time, I'd be glad to do it.

L-2 Now, it's too bad that this air--this building isn't air conditioned tonight, with this lovely audience of people setting around everywhere. And God could just... If we could have a... It'd be a lot better if we--if it was just cool, but there's no way at all that we can prevent it. Now, if I understand this schedule right, I only go as the Lord leads, of course. I was definitely led to come to Hammond, Indiana. I say that tonight. And there'll be a result come out of here, that you'll hear from a long, long time. I have obeyed, before God tonight, and man, I've done the best that I know how, to follow the leadings of the Holy Spirit.

L-3 Next Tuesday, the Lord willing, I'll just be right up the coast here, a little piece, at Zion, Illinois, to begin there in a--a big auditorium there, of some sort. I don't know what it is. And then, if the good Lord will be willing, when we close there, we come right back over here to Gary, Indiana, for three nights. And then from there, we go right into Chicago, and we'll be in Chicago. Then, if the Lord willing, we'll be in Battle Creek, Michigan, right immediately after that. We'd be glad for you... I guess they've made the opening announcements, and telling you where we'd be. We'd be happy... And as soon as our Lord tells me the hour, the time to move, I'm going into Africa, and from there to India, where I will fulfill a vision that God has given me of three hundred thousand people. And you remember to keep that in mind. And you'll see it appear in different places. And now, you remember, that is the truth. God has spoken that, and it will be so.

L-4 And now, while I've been here, you've been very kind, very lovely, and helped me in every way, and I appreciate it with all my heart. God's richest blessings upon you all, is my prayer. As the Finns would say, many of them in here, "Jumalan rauhaa." That's "God's peace rest upon you." And now, I pray that--that you will remember me as your brother, as I go other places to minister in the Name of our dear Lord, that you will pray for me. Could I just have you raise your hand, say, "I will remember you, Brother Branham." Thank you, thank you. God bless your kind hearts.

L-5 I hope that someday, I can come back to Hammond again, come back and hold a meeting, when it would, maybe, a little cooler, in the fall or something, when we could secure the auditorium here, this civic center. I want to thank these gentlemen, the men who was--let us have this auditorium, this civic center. They're nice. And we thank you, gentlemen, from the depths of our heart, and may God's blessings rest upon you each, is my prayer. And to all the cooperating ministers, that cooperated in the meeting, I say, "God's peace be with you. May many souls be that was saved during the meetings, come into your church." And to all the--the laity, and so forth, I pray that we have been a blessing to you, that you'll go away from here with your souls filled up with the glory of God, going 52-0720E, Who Has Believed Our Report?, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 56 min forward now, to be better Christians than what you was, with a more determination to serve our Lord. And as your brother, I want to leave tonight. And I thank you, the ushers, and all, everyone. If I leave out anyone, forgive me, I don't mean too. You've been more than kind to me, and I love you for it with all my heart. And now, if I leave out any, a certain part, any people, well, you forgive me. I don't mean to do that.

L-6 Now, I shall start praying for the sick, just in a few moments. Just as quick as I possibly can, I will start praying for the sick and the needy. Now, any time that I can be a blessing to you, or anything that I can do to help you, I'll be glad to hear from you. And if you want me to send you anointed cloth, or something that I prayed over, which many times... How many believes in that, sending handkerchiefs and aprons? Well, friends, I send out thousands a week. But look, never one, that I pray for it. Now, you might find a little form there, that... We've got a universal prayer going around the world. Every three hours, or ever... that's at nine o'clock at morning, twelve o'clock at noon, and at three o'clock in the afternoon, Eastern Daylight Standard time. We--we pray for the sick. And that goes around the world. People down in Africa, get up at midnight to offer up prayer at that time. When, I guess, around a million voices break forth together. Something has to happen. Don't you believe so...?... When... Just think of it.

L-7 And now, we send you a little mimeograph thing, what to do; that is, if you got anything in your life, go make it right with God. And go get your pastor, some good, religious person, have the--a prayer, and put this on you. And then it tells you what to do. Now, it is true, a secretary makes... It's made up. I've made it up, and told you what to do, but it's run off by a secretary, put out by my secretary at Jeffersonville. But the prayer cloths, I've prayed over that myself (see?), myself.

L-8 Look, if my baby was sick, and I wanted some man, that could come from... Now, many times, you believe in anointing a cloth. That's all right; that's perfectly all right. Anything that God will bless, I'm for it. Aren't you? That's right. See? Now, many people anoint the cloth, but if you'll follow me in the Bible, it was not... Paul didn't anoint the cloth, "He taken from his body, handkerchiefs and aprons." Is that right? He never anointed them; he just taken them from his body. Now, I believe he got that from Elijah's staff. Elijah went and said--said, "Lay the staff on the baby." See? Elijah knew that what he touched was blessed. But now, whether the Shunammite woman would believe it or not, that's different. But now, Paul got that from there, that he knew that what he touched was blessed. And the people believed him to be God's servant and His prophet. So what he touched, he believed was blessed, and he sent the handkerchief, and the people received that.

L-9 Now, somebody that's real fundamental, what a... Those people won't have tried it. See? God does things sometime, that's not in the scope that He's written in the Bible. You believe that? The Bible's a Blueprint, sure enough. But what if, when Peter passed through the gate called Beautiful, or, I mean, Jesus, at the pool of Bethesda, what if those people there said, "Now wait, go back in the Old Testament and show me where there's a Scripture that that's an Angel. That's psychology. That's nothing but just the wind blowing around that wall there or that pool. That's what's a doing that." But the people believed it was an Angel. Do you believe it was? But it wasn't written in the Scripture.

L-10 What if, them laying in the shadow of Peter, and every one of them getting healed, what if somebody said, "Now, wait a minute. Show me that in the Scripture, where they'll lay in the shadow of a man." But God did it anyhow, didn't He? He did it. That's right. It wasn't in the Scripture. Paul taken handkerchiefs, or aprons from his body. Somebody say, "Oh, show me that in the Scripture, where it's going to be." It wasn't in the Scriptures, but God did it anyhow. Is that right? He rewards you of your faith. That's what it is, your faith. Whatever you want to do.

L-11 I was talking to Brother Roberts, here not long ago. And Brother Roberts said, "Brother Branham, what I have, a point of contact. I have the people to touch the radio, touch the--something." Said, "What do you think about that?" I said, "That's wonderful, Oral. That's fine." Anything that you can have a point of contact, something that you got faith to believe. Your... It rests in your faith. Wherever you can start from, right there's where you begin, when you believe God. Is that right? Whatever it is, that's not to me to know. 52-0720E, Who Has Believed Our Report?, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 56 min Now, to my meetings, it's a supernatural Being, that's--that's absolutely in the meeting, and you can see It moving. And I ask you to have faith and believe it's Jesus Christ, the Son of God. See? And if you believe, God does the rest of it. You believe that, don't you? All right.

L-12 Now, every one be real reverent, believe with all your heart now. And I want to read a Scripture, and then I shall have prayer for the sick. Over in Isaiah, the 53rd chapter, the 1st verse, beginning: Who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground: he has no form... comeliness; and when we shall see him, there's no beauty that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrow... acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he has borne our grief, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquity: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

L-13 That is our report. Have you believed it? That's the report that we still bring to you. Jesus Christ, that, by His stripes, we are now (present tense) healed. You are already healed, every one of you. Every sick person here is healed. The only thing you have to do, is have enough faith to reach up and get a hold of it. Is that right? I believe that every sinner that's setting in this building tonight is already saved. When Jesus died at Calvary, He settled the sin question with God. Do you believe that? It'll never do you any good until you accept it.

L-14 If you bought my ticket... I'm fixing to drive home just in a little bit after the services, so I can get the wife and babies and be in Zion by Tuesday. But now... That's about a six, seven hundred miles' trip, right quick. Now, if you'd say, "Brother Branham, I have an airplane ticket laying out here for you. You drive down--go down by plane." Well, if I never go... And you have taken your money and purchased that airplane ticket, but yet, it'll never do me no good, no matter how much the airlines say, "Here it is. Your name's here, you're ready." Until I accept that ticket, it'll never do me no good. Is that right? No matter how sincere you are, yet it won't do me any good, till I accept it. Now, your healing is--is just as complete as the airplane ticket, and more so than what the--the... Your healing is more complete than the airplane ticket would be complete, if you'd paid for it. Is that right? Jesus, when He died, He settled the sin question. And in there, He--He did make an atonement for your sickness. "He was wounded for our transgressions; with His stripes we are healed." That's as plain as I know to see... to report it to you.

L-15 And then, the Bible said that He's the same. When He came on the earth, they said He came and fulfilled that in Matthew 8, many people say. Well, if He did it, then He fulfilled it before the atonement was made. So you see, you couldn't ta... you couldn't say that. When anybody tells you that, it's wrong, 'cause that was a year and six months before Jesus died. And how could He fulfill what Isaiah spoke of, there in the 53rd chapter, when... before He'd even been "wounded for our transgressions, or bruised for our iniquities, or with His stripes we're healed." His stripes hadn't been put on Him yet, so how could it fulfill what Isaiah said, in Matthew 8? It couldn't do it. No, sir. It wasn't until after He was... Then if it was fulfilled there, and you say it was a shadow, just of the atonement, then what did Peter heal the man at the gate called Beautiful for--with? What atonement, what a power, and what authority was that by? See? What about with Paul, and the rest of them, on down through the age, and what is this tonight that's a doing it?

L-16 There's people setting here sick, that'll be well in another hour from now. There's no doubt. Like last night, a man went from this building had never walked in all of his life, and went out the door there walking. What was it? Because I prayed for him? No, sir. Because his faith looked up to God, and was healed. That's why it was. He walked because he felt the power of God and accepted it. He didn't have to feel it; he had to believe it, and got up and walked out. He seen it, and he said, "That's good," and he just got up and walked out. Last night, as I was leaving, here set a man, setting... had raised up there. I was trying to speak to him. I'd see his vision standing before me, a colored man. He was setting there with a cane in his hand, almost blind and crippled. And when I spoke over, I said, "You crippled there, set up... get up." And the man was a sinner, and I tried to talk to him, but I--I was too far gone. I couldn't speak no more, 'cause they'd taken me out. See? There he was there, out there rejoicing. I 52-0720E, Who Has Believed Our Report?, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 56 min told him, "Get your heart right with God," (See?) as I went out.

L-17 Now. God is here tonight to make ready, to heal, and to make manifest anything that you ask, believing Him. Do you believe that's so? All right. Now, let us have prayer. Our heavenly Father, O God, this closing night, there's no doubt people here, that we will never meet again this side of heaven. God, save every sinner. Grant it, Lord. We thank You for Hammond, Indiana, for its founders, and for its religious institutions, for the other surrounding cities, the fellowship, and for the great privilege of being setting here in America, where the doors of the church is open. We thank Thee for that, our Father. And I thank You for a gallant people that would come out in this hot building tonight, setting here, even the sick and needy. God, have mercy, I pray, that this will be the climax of the meeting, Lord, that it will be the greatest night with the sick and the afflicted, and the lame, and halt, and blind, and cancered, and heart trouble, and all will be healed right... every one of them. Grant it, Lord. May there not be one feeble one left among us, when the services is over.

L-18 God, may we go away from here with faith. Maybe some of them can't get up, maybe some of them are crippled yet, but Lord, if that faith has settled there, it's got to materialize, it just... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... It has to come to pass; You said so, and we believe You. No matter what the symptoms are, we believe God. It isn't the way I feel, or what my symptoms is, it's what You said about it. How can I ever believe, me, a sinner, lost, and undone, come from a sinful family, a sinful generation, that You'd ever stoop down and save me. That's more of a miracle than it was when You healed me when I was blind. O God, how great You are. And I pray, Father, with the sincerity of my heart.

L-19 Now, You led me here to Hammond, I've come in obedience to the leading. You have taken them out of wheelchairs, off of crutches, off of cots, off of stretchers. You have made the heart troubles healed. You've made the doctors write out their testimonies that the cancers is gone. O Father, and You've took the alcoholics and the prostitutes; You've taken the dope fiends, You--You've brought them out of every walk of life and made ladies and gentlemen out of them. O God, what more could be? We thank You for it, and You've manifested Yourself every night, infallible. Every night you have manifested Yourself in great power, and signs, and wonders, and visions, that the people now, when You come, if You should come tomorrow morning to this earth to receive Your Church, the people are without excuse. They have seen it. I have testified of You, Lord. Thou knowest that I have testified of You, and not of myself, but of You. Therefore, my testimony is true, because I speak of Thee, my Lord. And telling the people that it's not their brother, it is You our Lord.

L-20 And Thou hast manifested Thyself every night with the same signs that You did when You were here on earth. Now, we thank Thee, and we pray that You'll come to us tonight and will reward us in a great way. All these things, Father, I commit to Your hand. Grant it, Lord. I can't make the people have faith. But Thou can move down a little closer tonight than before. I pray you can, Lord, and get just a little closer to their hearts. Seeing that the great anticipation of this meeting, the waiting, just a few minutes. God, I pray that You'll move down like a shower, like a cool breeze coming down from heaven, a refreshing from the Presence of the Lord, and will let the people know that You're here, and a vindicate Your truth, that it is the truth. Then, Lord, I'll feel that I can leave the city, saying, "I have done my best for my Lord, and the people will all say, 'Glory to God in the highest.'" Oh, thank You, Father. I believe that You will do it, for I commit it to You now, in the Name of Your Son Jesus. Amen.

L-21 How many's here for your first time? First time you's ever in the meeting, let's see? One of the... Oh, there's many of you. Just a little, a moment or two now, just before we call for the sick and the afflicted. I want to ask you something. If you were looking tonight... Now, let's just--just lay aside... How many of you here, that for your first time, and are Christians, Bible readers? Let's see your hand. Raise your hands, Christians, Bible readers. All right. Now, if you were coming to this building tonight to look for a certain person, you'd have to have a description of them. If you were coming, looking for our Lord... If Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever, He's the same in Person, same in action, same in power. Do you believe that?

L-22 Now remember, our Lord said He could do nothing (Saint John 5:19, and 20), He could do nothing until the Father showed Him. How many says that's right? Jesus Christ said, "I can do nothing of Myself, what I see the Father doing, 52-0720E, Who Has Believed Our Report?, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 56 min that I do. Outside of that, I do nothing." See? Just what the Father showed Him. Here's a little baby setting here, a little spastic child. Still... Been setting here for a few nights. I--I wonder... or one like it anyhow. I wonder what--what if I could go down there and heal that child. Wouldn't I be happy? That mother thinks just as much of that baby, as I do of mine. I wished I could do that. I can't. And there's no other man on earth can do it. There's only one can do it, and that's God. Now, He has, as far as the atonement is appropriated, He's appropriated healing for that child in the atonement. You believe that. You have to, to be a Christian, and a Bible reader. You'll have to believe the full Gospel. That's right, not part of it, all of it. Now--now, that baby, before I leave this building tonight may be perfectly normal, walking around here on the floor. God in heaven, Who I stand before, knows that many things beyond that has happened. Now the only thing I'd be able to know, if our heavenly Father will show me what to do about that baby, then I'll do it.

L-23 Now--now He comes down... Jesus said He was the same... The Bible said He was the same yesterday, today, and forever. Is that right? Then if He is the same today, as He was then, then He still can do nothing except the Father give Him permission or show Him. Is that right? Now, being that He isn't here in a physical body, but in the form of the Holy Spirit, then He uses our eyes to see visions like He did. "The things that I do, shall you also." Is that right? Now, notice just what He saw. He saw Nathanael, when Nathanael came. He seen Nathanael coming. Nathanael said, "Nothing good could come out of Nazareth." When Jesus saw him, He said, "Behold there's an Israelite in whom there's no guile." And the--the Israelite said, "When did you know me, Rabbi?" He said, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the tree, I saw you." Is that right? Now, He said, "You're the Son of God, the King of Israel."

L-24 Now, when He talked to the woman at the well, He carried a conversation with her. He spoke to her, and talked to her, wanted to know what was... talked about water and bringing Him a drink. But after He caught her spirit, and God gave Him a vision, He said, "Go get your husband." Is that right? And then when He went and got... She said, "Why, I perceive that You're a prophet." She went into the city, and said, "Come, see a Man Who told me every thing I ever done." He never did that. He only told her that she had five husbands. But she knew if that was true, God could tell her all things. He knew her life.

L-25 Now, if Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and do we believe that the Holy Spirit is on earth today? How many believes that? Well, that Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit of God. Is that right? The third Person of the trinity, Jesus Christ. "Yet a little while, the world seeth Me no more, yet you'll see Me, for I'll be with you, even in you to the end of the world." Is that right? Then if He's going to be with us, in us to the end of the world, that makes Him the same yesterday, today, and forever. Is that right? Now, if He comes down in our midst tonight, and I'm just your brother, remember. But it's the claims that I say about Him, that He is the same. And here's what I believe. I believe every Word of the Bible is absolutely, infallible, the truth. That's the way... I--I think you can't say, "This is not inspired, and that's not inspired." I believe it's all inspired of God. And I'm willing tonight to hang my soul on any phase of it, and say, "It's the truth." I believe the whole book. And I believe when it said that "Jesus was the same yesterday, today, and for ever." I believe that Jesus made a way that He could be with us, as He said, "A little while, the world seeth Me no more; yet you shall. For I will be with you, even in you, to the end of the world." I believe that He returned back in the form of the Holy Ghost the second, third Person of the trinity, come back as the Comforter, and is with us, working the same thing that Jesus Christ did when He was here on earth. Now, that's either right or wrong. Now, that's the way you got to take God.

L-26 If God promised to heal you, if you have faith tonight, it's either right, or wrong. That right. It's right, or wrong. If He promised to save you, no matter if you're a boot-legger, if you're a dope fiend, if you're a whatever you are. If you're a prostitute, whatever it is, Jesus Christ will stoop down and receive you. "He that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." You believe that? I have to, to be a Christian. I believe His mercies is unlimited. And I believe that tonight His mercies to you is unlimited. It's your faith limits God. 52-0720E, Who Has Believed Our Report?, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 56 min See? Now, may God come and give His great work tonight to you all.

L-27 Honey, what--what's the number to card? Huh? 1 to a 100 in what? F, F-1 to a 100. Well, I don't know how many we can stand tonight, maybe about ten at a time, I guess. Maybe we could take--take ten or fifteen. Let's begin at one, just start at one and line up here now. F, how many has prayer card F, raise your hand. There's a hundred of you here somewhere. All right. F--the biggest group of them lays right in here. All right. Who's got F number 1? Look at on those crippled people there, can't get up here. And look around and see your neighbor, setting next to you, if you got a--a card, maybe he's deaf, and he can't hear. He don't know his number's called. All right. F number 1, number 2, number 3, number 4, on up to about 10, 15, 20, somewhere, all along in there till you can stop. All right.

L-28 Line up now over here, F-1 through... Look around now, if there's somebody deaf and can't hear. Look at your neighbor's card. Somebody look over and say, "You got a prayer card?" Anywhere in the building, look over and say, "Have you got a prayer card?" And see, if the person is deaf setting next to you, they would--they wouldn't hear it. And it might be that... Now, we'll try to get some more just in a--a few moments, another call. Now, check around these--these crippled people here and see. We never had over three or four cots cases and crippled cases... [Someone speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] 1 to 100--100 there... That's just... Maybe I can get to it just in a... It's F-1. Yes, thank you. All right, brother. Just set here, maybe we can get to you just in a moment. All right.

L-29 Now, F-1 to F-15, or--or whatever we called to there. All right. You, see, it's too hot for them to stand up. And now, Brother Baxter, where you at? Brother Baxter, come to the microphone, if you will, just a moment. In these meetings there has been the people who was afflicted and setting in wheelchairs was healed, those who were propped in setting chairs who couldn't walk, walked. Those who were dying with cancer, doctors statements signed, they are well, heart trouble, doctor's statements, they are well, and everything. I--I wonder what more God could do for you. Men and women who were bound with sins, all kinds of habits, such as... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-30 The meeting alone... The anointing comes, it seems to me like that I have been somewhere, I don't know, but I don't remember the meetings. And Mr. Baxter and the--the ministers, and so forth, they get to enter and keep what's taken place. But absolutely... Brother Baxter, are you... Is Brother Baxter standing there? I would like for him to come to the microphone, just a moment. You don't know where he's at. All right. How many's missing out of that--out of your group now? How many? The prayer card number 4 is missing out of the group of the fifteen. Who has prayer card number 4? Somebody look again. It's somebody's deaf, perhaps, and can't--can't hear. Prayer card F-4 is missing out of the fifteen. Look around to a numbers. Maybe, some... one of the ushers. Say, sir, check among them people there, see if maybe someone can't get their hand up or something. All right. Prayer card F-4. How--how are they lining up back there, Brother Billings? What say? You get it? All right. How... Is the first fifteen lined up all right?

L-31 Look. I want you all back there in the audience, I know many of you. See? There's many of you back there with different diseases, that probably going to die right away, of course, if God doesn't help you, with cancer and tumor. I--I--I believe before that comes upon me, and I get beside myself... Brother Baxter, I want you to come here for something. I want you to stand here and sing a song," Nothing Between My Soul and The Saviour, Amazing Grace--Amazing Grace." I want to walk down, pray for them people setting there before I get started, them people that's crip--crippled and can't get up here. Where's--here's a little baby here, also. Now, everyone else just be reverent and quite just a minute. Look. I'm coming down to pray. And I want to pray for this: that God will give you faith, that while the meeting's going on, the Holy Spirit will turn me around, and tell me what's wrong with you, and you can raise up and be healed. Will that help you some? How many Christians will join in with me in silent prayer, while I'm praying?

L-32 Here's some more people over here, laying over here, too, that's awfully sick or something wrong. I'm going to come and pray for you all also. See? And now I pray that God will give you enough faith that He will show me what's wrong, and while I'm here on the platform. Then that'll make you ready for your healing when it comes time. Will you 52-0720E, Who Has Believed Our Report?, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 56 min believe now with all your heart? Will you believe? All right. All right. Let's all bow our heads now in prayer. Be in prayer, while I go pray for the sick. [A brother speaks to the congregation. Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] ...and I--I feel sorry for you to have to--to be like this, but I... It's nothing that I can do to prevent it. That's one thing that I--I'm sure of. Now, everyone be reverent and be in prayer.

L-33 Now...?... Now, it maybe just a little bit till I can--to feel the Angel of the Lord. See? It's anointing that does this. And I--I can get to--to talk to the man maybe, just a little while. Now, are you a stranger to me, sir? Are... I want to get this microphone so you'll be able to hear, if I can. Brother Baxter, you stand here and watch it if you possibly can. Now, to this audience here, I want you all to remember, when I leave, if anybody said, "Brother Branham is a--the Divine healer," don't you believe that; I am not. See? Jesus Christ is your Healer. Now, I only claim, that I... It's by a vision that God gave me, when I was a little baby in my mother's womb. When I was born, just a few minutes, here It come circling over where I was. It's been with me ever since. Go back down through the cities and the places where I've come from, ask the city where I come from, Jeffersonville, call the mayor of the city, anyone you want to. Ask them if anything has been said, or--or predicted, but what's come to pass, just exactly at the time and the place It said it would. See? That's right. See? Therefore, it's--it's true.

L-34 Now, if this man be here... Now, look around to this audience. Sir, I do not know you. I never seen you in my life. You're just a man. Now, if this... You just drew a prayer card, or they gave you a prayer card, and you came up here. Now, if I be God's prophet, then if there's anything in--in your life, that I--God would reveal to me something, and us being strangers, it'd have to come through the supernatural. Do you believe that? If that's right, just raise up your hand. That is right. Now, how many of you out there, that believes that if God would--will do this, that you'd accept Jesus Christ? If this man... You are a Christian, a believer. Now, this man is a Christian, he's standing here with his hand up, knows that I know not one thing about him, nothing at all. Now, if Jesus Christ will reveal this, will you accept Jesus to be the same yesterday, today, and for ever? Would it be the same Holy Spirit if it--if it--Jesus does this? You'll know it's supernatural, but we might pass it on, say, "Well, mental telepathy," or something like that, or throw it over to one side. But friend, if you do, then that's between you and God. It's not between me and God. I'm declaring to you the Jesus, the same yesterday, today, and forever.

L-35 You say why don't I heal that little girl? If it was me, I would. See? Why'd He leave... Why'd He pass by that little spastic child, and those crippled, and lame, and halt, there at the pool of Bethesda, and moved right on by them, passed up, many of them standing there, the Bible said halt, lame, blind. What about that blind man screaming for mercy to put him in the pool, and Jesus come right by him, and He was Emmanuel. Is that right? What about that lame, afflicted, great multitude, maybe ten thousand of them laying there, screaming for somebody to get them in the water. Why did He--why didn't He heal them? He passed right by. He had compassion; He was the Son of God. Is that right? He went right over to a... one man, that had diabetes or something, heart trouble, or some disease he'd had for thirty-eight years. He could walk. He said, "While I'm coming down at the water, somebody else steps before me." Is that right? And He healed that one man, and walked away and left that multitude. How many knows that's the Bible? Raise your hands. And when the Jew's questioned Him, He said, "I can do nothing, till the Father shows Me."

L-36 Now, the man can't hide his life from me, 'cause that's a Divine gift. But whether he's healed or not, that'll be up to God. See? I--I have nothing to do with it. See? I can pray for him, that's all. Now, sir, now stand right around this way, if you will, so I can just talk to you, just to look at you, just a few moments. And you and I will talk, just like Jesus and the woman at the well. See? We'll begin talking, and then--and then, after while, you'll begin to recognize that something's taking place. And when you do, it'll be His Presence, then your human spirit and my human spirit will be coming in contact, and then it'll be something, ever what's wrong with you, and this Angel of the Lord, standing here, there'll be two more Beings (See?) speaking. Now, depends on... I have faith to believe that He will. If I can get you to have faith, it'll happen. If it doesn't, well I--I can't--I can't do it. You see? I can't 52-0720E, Who Has Believed Our Report?, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 56 min do a thing, but just tell you what He shows me.

L-37 Now, do you--do you like Indiana? I... Just a conversation with you (See?) to get your mind off... You're all keyed-up now, nervous. You see? I want to get your mind off of it. I don't want you to think nothing about what--what's your troubles or nothing. I want you to think about something else. Is your--is you... Do you like Indiana? It's a wonderful state. It's a... I've spoke of it around the world. See? Jeffersonville, Indiana. Little old... Was you ever in Jeffersonville? No? It's a little, bitty, old city down there of about seventeen thousand population, but... Well, it's called "little Chicago." Ha-ha-ha. Much gambling, you know, there's much gambling. And... But there's a lot of good people lives there. There is everywhere. You believe that, don't you? God has people all over the world. See? We just have to... Someday He will take them all up, and we'll all be together then. Is... Won't that be wonderful? It sure will. Now, sir, you're aware that something's moving now. Now, if that is right, raise your hand, sir. Now, friends, not psychology, George J. Lacy, and the picture back there, will prove that. Something's moving in this platform, just now, just like a wave, coming in, like, "whew," the Angel of the Lord, flaming, licking, flashing. This man's aware of it.

L-38 Now, sir, that won't hurt you. That's the only thing that can help you now. He's sent from the Presence of God. Now, did you ever see His picture back there in the book? Did you ever see... Well, you've actually seen it. Yes. You've seen that copyright, and you've seen on there, what this, the best inspector they had in the world said: "The only Im--Immortal Being was ever photographed." Now, that's what is the results, that you're feeling right now. That's His Presence. You--you have many things wrong with you. Isn't that right? I just see it all mixing up together. And, say, you've--you just had an operation too. Isn't that right? Now, I see a room. It was--it was a tumor. Is that right? Say, aren't you taking some kind of a treatment for that now. Isn't that right, some kind of treatment to kill the... is that right? Now, just a moment, It--It left me. Was what I said was right? Turn around to the audience. Was that right, sir? Now, come here. I can pray for you. That's all I can do. Dear Lord, You are here tonight. And I pray that You'll heal this man. May he get well. He wants too, Lord. He realizes this is malignancy. And I pray, God, that You'll heal him and make him well. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may he live. Amen. Sir, it is malignancy you have. You're--but you're--you're going to get all right now. God bless you. Go on your road, rejoice. Let us say, "Praise be to God!"

L-39 'Course, that man had a prayer card. He was brought up here at the platform. See? He was... Come here... How many out there hasn't got a prayer card (let's see your hands) and believes that God will heal you and make you well? Raise up your hands. Just say, "I believe...?... with all my heart." Come. Howdy do? Are you a stranger to me, lady? I don't believe I've ever seen you. I've never seen you, no ma'am. All right then, if you be a stranger to me, and... But I realize that you're a Christian. Now, is that... How would I know you was a Christian. You're just a lady standing there. How would I know that you's a Christian? Is that the same Spirit that said to Nathanael, "Behold an Israelite, indeed, in whom there's no guile"? Do you believe that? You're acquainted, you know that something's happening. You're not only a Christian, but you're a minister of the Christian Word. Is that right? Don't you come from a place where there's a lot of palm trees or something? I see you moving on a street. Now, it's either Florida or California. I believe California. Is that right? All right. And say, you've had a... There's something wrong in your back. It's--it's down in your back. You're stiffening. Yes, you're limbs in your back is getting stiff. Is that right? Say, wasn't that caused from an automobile accident? Is that right? [Woman speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] Is it... Yes, ma'am. All right. Jesus Christ bless you, my sister. Lord God, bless this woman and make her well, through Jesus Christ's' Name. Return happy and rejoicing, and go... All right. God bless you. Let's say, "Thanks be to God." Oh, my! When I feel the Spirit of God cry out in my soul, to the people... Why not believe Him? Why not have faith in Him? All right, lady; you. Are we strangers? I don't know you. I never seen you in my life, as I know of. Is that true? You believe God is with me? You believe this is God, what you feel now, that moving of the Spirit. You believe that's it? Now, look sister, you have cancer. I don't know whether you knew that or not. It's cancer and it's at the opening in your throat. Is that right? That's right. Come here just a minute. Cancer, cursed be you, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Come out of this child of God; turn her loose. God bless you, lady. Go... See, that... God bless you, sister...?... 52-0720E, Who Has Believed Our Report?, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 56 min

L-40 Come here. Everybody's got cancer could be healed right now, if you want to. Have faith in God. Believe God with all your heart. God shall bring it to pass. You believe it? Amen. Have faith. Some of you out there, get praying now. You people I prayed for, to have faith. While the anointing of the Holy Spirit is moving in here now, you have faith in God.

L-41 Are you the patient, lady?...?... Excuse me, sometimes I get just a little bit, kinda beside myself, on account of the anointing. Now, you come here to me. Do you believe me to be God's servant? First thing, right quick. It's nervous trouble, isn't it? That's right. Yes, you're upset. And one of the main things you need is Jesus Christ. Isn't that right? You don't... I'm... You can't hide your life from me. I know what it is. See? Will you accept Him as your personal Saviour right now? You been thinking about that anyhow for a few days, especially since you've been in this meeting. I'm not reading your mind, but that's the truth. Is it? If it is, raise your hand. Sinner, but you want to come to Christ now. Do you? O Father, have mercy on the woman. God, we realize it's Satan that did this. He'd take the woman's life if he could...?... But she's, somehow, she come into the building tonight. She's come here to be healed. And God, she realizes that the Holy Spirit would not let sin pass over the platform in His Presence, without revealing it. God, in Jesus Christ' Name, I pray that You heal the woman. Grant it. Save her from every sin; forgive every sin that she did, as she stood here before these many thousand people, with their hands up, that she's believes and accepts You, as her Saviour. We know at this very moment, her name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life, for she's confessed You before men. You said, "I will confess you before My Father, and the Holy Angels." And now, satan, you had a right to hold her, as long as she was a sinner, but you don't have any right now. Come out of the woman, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Now, lady, I don't... You've--you just... You're saved now. You've accepted Him as your Saviour. You've been having all kinds of trouble, mental trouble, and then Satan has set into you to take you to an insane institution. That's on--on a nervous breakdown. And now, you can go home, and be well, and serve God all your life, reverently. Now, if God let me know what was wrong with you, He will let me know what will be and what was for you. But you done the greatest thing that you ever done in your life, when you got to the platform. Now, not because I was here, but because that you accepted Jesus Christ. God bless you. Go now, and the Lord bless...?... Hallelujah!

L-42 All right, lady. And what do you think about the meetings? Wonderful. I'm just so happy to hear that. Now, we're strangers, are we? You don't know me, and I don't know you. No, ma'am. Till this service. Well, that--that's... I'm happy that we get to meet one another. Now, if there's anything wrong with you, then our heavenly Father would reveal it to me. Do you believe that? Just in order, to let you... You haven't got a prayer card have you, lady, setting there? Yes. You haven't got a prayer card? You have a prayer card. Well, maybe you'll be called in a few minutes, but... All right. That kidney trouble you had, that's been bothered with... Is that right? All right. You stand up. He--He healed you anyhow. So you don't have to come in the prayer line to use it. All right. Look, lady. Your trouble is a female trouble. It's in the female glands, in the womb. And it's a tumor. Isn't that right? And don't you have a... You've had a--a bunch of children, haven't you? Yes. Say, don't you come from Kentucky, the state of Ken...? Is that right? Raise your hand up. God bless you. Go home, your tumor's gone. In the name of the Lord...?... go home...

L-43 You believe, my brother? With all your heart? All right. Come here. In the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, may you go home and be well. [Brother Branham speaks to the man--Ed.]... won't heal up right at the bottom of it. He never did say nothing about it when you passed by. I... You wondered why I didn't tell you that...?... Ain't that right? Come here...?... Just so that you might know the glory of God, the man passed up here at the platform and I prayed for him. I seen he was going to get well, so I just passed him on. When he went by, he was wondering in his mind, why I didn't tell him what was wrong with him. I turned him around. Now... I turned the man back around, because he was thinking of it. Not as I'm a mind reader, but Jesus Christ perceived their thoughts. Is that right? All right. And he wanted to know why I didn't tell... And I turned him around, I said, "You're wondering, brother, why I didn't tell you 52-0720E, Who Has Believed Our Report?, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 56 min what was the matter with you." And I said, "You've just had an appendicitis operation, and the lower part of the incision won't heal up." Is that right, sir? All right. You go... You're going to be healed up now. God's going to make you well...?...

L-44 Come, lady. Do you believe, with all your heart? Do you believe me to be His prophet? You believe that what I would ask God, God would do? Not because it's me, but because it's--it's Him. Is that right? You're pending an operation. Is that right? You was examined, and you have tumor. Is that right? Isn't that tumor found in the stomach? Is that right? Raise your hand. And you're have... supposed to be operated on for that. Isn't that right? Isn't He wonderful? Come here. Father, in the Name of Thy Son, Jesus, I bless this poor, little woman. May she go home and be healed tonight, and may that tumor just disappear. I curse it in the Name of Jesus Christ, as Your representative. Amen. God bless you, sister. Go on your road rejoicing, happy.

L-45 I keep seeing a lady appear before me, right along in here somewhere. It's the colored lady setting there. You got kidney trouble. Is that right, lady? That's right. You're healed. You can go home now. You don't have a prayer card, do you? You don't have any prayer card. L? Well, that's way back in the first of the meeting. All right. All right. What do you think of it, setting up here, lady? You have a prayer card? You do. Well, I--I maybe you'll get... Is it a prayer card for tonight? What number is it? What? Oh, it's nights gone by. You see her setting there believing, trying to believe with all your heart, and that's the reason... Maybe you'll get called into the line. Do you believe me as God's prophet, if I stand here, and tell you what's wrong with you? Stand up on your feet just a minute. Look on me just a minute. There's another lady setting right there in front of you, crying...?... A bladder trouble, is that right? Raise your hand, if that's right. All right. Go home now and be well.

L-46 All right, sister, the Lord bless you. Father, I pray that You'll make her every whit whole. May she go home now and be healed in Jesus' Name. Amen. Let's say, "Thanks be to God." You been wondering about your heart trouble, but it's gone...?... is gone. God bless you. You're a preacher (see?); you come by and God be merciful, and make the woman to have confirmed of this faith in Jesus' Name. God bless you, sister. All right. You come. "Only believe, all things are possible only believe." You believe, lady? With all your heart? Do you believe I'd be God's servant? You do? All right. If you believe, and accept Jesus Christ as your Healer now? You do? Now, if I never say what's wrong with you, you believe anyhow. Is that right? I say this, so that you'll have a--a better foundation of faith. You got a stomach trouble that's been bothering you. Is that right? Wave your hand, like this. All right. You can go home and eat now. Jesus Christ makes you well.

L-47 Do you believe, sister? Have faith in God. I see a colored lady setting here, had a lot of trouble, a lot of operations. You haven't got a prayer card, have you? You have a prayer card. What number is it? Is it going to be called? What--what--what number--N? Well, that was way back some other time in the week. Look. Look this way to me. Do you believe me as God's prophet? You've--you've had an operation, two or three, about, yeah, about four or five of them. Is that right? And isn't that operation on the... it's... it's a eye... it's in the... it's on the spine. It's in your rectum or spine. And you've had kind of a fistula like, in the... Is that right? Is that true? That's right. All right, lady. God bless you. Go home, you're going to get well...?....

L-48 You believe you're going to get over that tumor? You do? You believe you are now? All right, there, go home then, and may the Lord bless you and make you well. Do you believe? With all your heart? What your trouble is your blood; you're anemia. Isn't that right? Have smotherings too, like with heart trouble, which it is. That's right. Nervous heart. Which you're nervous to begin with, but you're anemia, without blood. Let us go to Calvary tonight for a transfusion, will you, sister? Come here. I'm a man; I'm your brother. I will pray for you; you believe what I pray. Will you? Almighty God, I bless this poor, little, dying woman here. May we now by faith look up there and see the stream Thy flowing wound supplied, and may she--this anemia condition leave, and may she be a healthy, well woman. In the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you, sister. Go rejoicing now and be happy.

L-49 Come, lady... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] You believe with all of your heart? Have faith, have faith. That lady sitting right up above where that man was healed, that had heart trouble. You believe? If you do, stand up on your feet. See it? 52-0720E, Who Has Believed Our Report?, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 56 min You believe with all your heart, raise your hand. How many more in here's got heart trouble? Raise your hands. Satan's calling for help. Something's fixing to happen, friends. Some of you believe me with heart trouble. Here it is. Almighty God, in Jesus Christ's Name, heal every one with heart trouble, Lord. Every one of you...?... stand on your feet, quickly, quickly, right quick. Raise up your hands, accept it right now, while He's... Almighty God Author of Life, giver of every good gift send Thy blessings upon the people, Lord. O...?... devil, thou...?... spirit...?...
