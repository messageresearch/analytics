With Jesus Falling In Love With Jesus Falling In Love With Jesus was the best thing I ever ever done amen he get sweeter and sweeter doesn't he as the days go by we've we've had two meetings today we had a minister meeting this morning at breakfast and I would just say we all witnessed the presence of God come in that room we had a young people service this afternoon and we watched God just come in another way and tonight I believe believe he's going to come one more time we've been praying we've been we made mention yesterday that today we would Orient the service toward having prayer and a prayer line I want to just make a couple of statements about that briefly if I can in the message Satan's Eden brother Ram said they asked why didn't brother Neville preach on the Holy Ghost this morning and he said the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a life it's not an emotion it's not some sort of a fleshly evidence but it is the person Jesus Christ amen and then he says Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart to Quicken every word of this age amen he says watch the Holy Ghost In Action not so much in demonstration but in action amen we have brother Ron Spencer here tonight brother Ron is a Gifted Man he's a pastor he's a minister but he's also been gifted in other manners brother Brandon would tell us there's no better way than accepting your healing your need Deliverance than believing his word but he said if we can't do that that ought to be enough he said but if it isn't then he comes down and he set in the church gifts yeah and he said now the minister can teach the word and that we ought to believe outright but then look at the goodness of God he sends something else he sends servants and Prophets and so forth with discernment of spirit and so forth so we believe the Lord's going to use his vessel tonight so we're going to let brother Ron come to the pulpit we're going to give him the Liberty we're going to sacrifice our thoughts our minds we're going to put our focus on one thing last night was another level it wasn't brother Ron in the latter part of that service so let's as we said let's our put our faith to what God has set forth for us there's provision you'll lay hands on the sick and the sick shall recover in my name they'll cast out Devils that's our promise that's our our our inheritance that's our Authority today so we're going to set our faith to that let's just sing the song God still moves God still [Music] moves God God still moves God still moves hearts of his people God still moves he do do not [Music] sleep he slum God still moves God still moves God still moves God still m in the heart son his people God still moves he does not sleep nor does he Slumber God still moves God still moves aren't you glad that he still moves amen isn't he wonderful to us isn't he Gooden we just love him with all of our hearts and amen maybe we could maybe we could sing a a course of that on the wings of a snow white dove and then sing that last verse though I have suffered in many way okay Amen on the wings of a snow God s his love from above all the wings of a let's sing it together now I have suffered [Music] [Applause] in many a ways I cry for healing night and take Faith wasn't for God by the father of he gave me his son all the wings of let's sing it with all of our heart now on the wngs of [Music] a God send his sweet love high from above on the wngs of [Music] a isn't he wonderful am what a meeting we've had amen if we would close even now we could say we have been met by the angel of the Lord he's came in every service even this morning in The Minister's breakfast it was it was so overwhelming his awesome presence today in the youth Service as we as we watched and you were a part of we watched God speak and turn speak to you and take a vessel and use him if we can only recognize it's the voice behind The Voice none of us came to see man even as we turn our hearts toward tonight of of a prayer line you know no man's A Healer no man's A Healer but when our faith reaches another level reaches unto God you can walk out in this building a a very sick individual even unto death but you can walk out totally healed now let me just ask you we've all sit in doctor's offices for hours and hours and hours been patient with that and they're only practicing Physicians there's a doctor in the house [Applause] now some things in your conditions are too private to even speak but God hears and he answers prayer Sarah is there anything impossible with God and he's the same God today maybe you'd lift divide gravity and lift your hands before the Lord and say Lord Jesus Remember me some man would scream thou son of David have mercy on me amen even in addressing him out of order God still heard he hears your prayer he knows your thoughts he knows what you've been going through you may say well brother Ron it's just impossible I've suffered with this for years with our God there's nothing [Music] impossible maybe even now you would say brother Ron I've got children that don't know Jesus that's right they know church but they don't know Jesus maybe you don't know Jesus you know him by a story or even a prophet's vook voice but Jesus is in the room amen Heavenly Father we feel your awesome presence even now Lord as we come we have surrendered ourself to you phenomenal Minister standing in this room Lord what great men that you've placed here but you placed them here for a great bride that's right a people of your own choosing while we're here in this Humanity we have great needs many needs are so difficult almost unmanageable so hard to even talk about not just needs in the flesh but in the spirit maybe the darkness of depression that thing can be broke tonight maybe there's people that know you but they're backsliding in their Spirit things have just got in the way maybe they've been hurt Lord you've never hurt one it's your it's maybe men and their own carnality that's done that I'm so sorry Lord God come touch your children tonight father we reach out to you now we all stand in need Lord as we take these directions now we ask you that you would speak to our hearts even while the word Goes Forth touch us now brood over this building may it be like a wind that would come through here Lord May the buer of fire be present to your children may this place become like a smoky presence of the hollow presence of God lord what we say is you're welcome here now Satan leave leave in the name of Jesus Christ you take your leave you go back to where you came from by the authority of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ tonight we pray you are a defeated being and we Proclaim that today in Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen and amen and amen amen amen God bless you God bless you amen we so appreciate every service that's we've been a part of and we've been here to be part thank you for having us thank you for having us me and sister Connie we're honored to be here to stand with you one more time and we don't never take the those things for granted if you will turn with us to Matthew chap 6 and verse 9 you would just give us the leeway to just take part two and this will be more of an action scriptures tonight so I would like for you to read this with me if you will and after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the Glory forever amen amen God bless you you can be seated God bless you brother minow amen love you we're friends for those that are very familiar with the message you will identify with us next scriptures in every prayer line service brother Brandon would you would either would read these scriptures or he would talk about the story it was a story of Redemption where Jesus would go out of his way for one that's right John chapter 6 chapter 4 and verse 6 now Jacob swell was there and Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on a well as it was about the sixth hour and there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water and Jesus saith unto her give me to drink for the disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat brother brandham said that he sent them away and then saith the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou be in a Jew ask drink of me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans and Jesus said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Water and the woman which saith unto him sir thou H has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from when then hast thou a a living water art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the water the well and drink thereof himself and his children and his cattle and Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drink of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up to everlasting life and the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I may that I may thirst not neither come hither to draw and Jesus said unto her go call thy husband and come hither and the woman answered and said I have no husband and Jesus said unto her thou Hast said well I have no husband for thou H has had five husbands and he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in that sest thou truly I think as we would begin this service brother brandham wouldn't just tell that story over and over again the same Messiah sign has been displayed in this generation that same gift none of us pretend to be a prophet or that's that gift was one to a generation to and so we we realize that we realize even in this building that we're not looking to a man we'd be quick to do that now what I'm doing is getting rid of scarecrows here first and very and very quickly we would identify that that the same Jesus was at that well is setting at your well and maybe even you would be in denial of where you're at but Jesus already knows now he's not ashamed to come to your well because he's looking past your condition he's not even looking at your situation he's looking at the seed that was placed on the inside of you and you were worth coming to Edmonton for so he'll go out of his way to come to one tonight it be me many so you can come to the well tonight and expecting one kind of water and leave with a complete different kind of water now we do this by a higher authority we were commissioned by the scriptures to lay hands on the sick and we're not the Healer that's right but the scripture says that they shall recover and so we take him at his word now Faith so many times we want to try to manufacture Faith but but let me just say this to you faith is expecting God to do what he said he would do now when you ask him to save you and he come into your life and and you accept salvation your garment changes and you're no longer the person that you used to be and he begins to clean you up and take habits out of your life now there's not a preacher here that can clean you we can preach a whole lot of legalism and preach how to clean our lives but God can take the [Applause] desire he can take the desire he can take the unbelief and you may not be a believer tonight or even be a make believer where you're at but you don't have to stay that way and I'm not here to condemn you to be in your condition but I can tell you you can walk out of this building even if you've served the Lord 50 years you can walk out of here refreshed in a new Revival like never before I preached about 40 years now we preached about Revival coming we preached about the great things that is going to be among us that's here now that's here now services like that we're having all over the world you don't have to manufacture it we're not feeding on the personality of a man we're not trying to work anything up he's here and let me just say he's not here by accident he's here to fulfill word and he's on a mission that's right the our Prophet had to leave the scene but the angel didn't leave the scene and he's here to make sure that the word is accomplished in your life so this is the bride's Revival and we're feeding on the word and it's manifestation of the word and it's not just a dead letter but said it's a life that's right now we realize that Satan can't get to that Gene seed of God that was placed there before the foundation of the world you understand in future home you were born and it was almost like two Natures inside of you but one laid dormant and then under the right atmosphere that seed of God came to life inside of you amen now you never was let me just say you never was a a pig in your you never was that that that out there you acted like an alien you always was a Son of God but you didn't act like it but one day God rich in Mercy this is a healing service but you remember when all of us has got that story we remember when when he came down rich and mercy in our lives and what a miracle it was he took a drunk or he took a dope addict or he took a religious person that was dead sitting in a Pew and he brought him to [Applause] life and you didn't have to make yourself go to church anymore you didn't have to make yourself loved God it was a spontaneous fountain that became alive inside of you you you couldn't wait till those doors came open you were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and came under the identification and then God filled you with the Holy Ghost and he sealed you with his own life like a breath of fresh air it be to breathe on the inside of you but that didn't change your flesh that's right your flesh is still a sinful flesh and God sends you the Holy Ghost to put Reigns and Dominion on your flesh and that faith that word of God keeps your body under control and when that old nature wants to rise itself up inside of it you by the word of God call it back to order are you with me that's why we need a body change that'll be the greatest healing line ever in the [Music] earth oh brother Ron I don't know so much about these Divine Healing in the message and prayer lines in the message let me just say there's going to be a prayer line around the world one glorious day break between 6 and 9:00 there's going to be a tiny light come down and change your body from Mortal immortality never to have another gray hair and never to be sick again oh what a day that will [Applause] be thank you Lord because Adam fell we get sick because Adam fail in our spirit we become weary there's many different things that he afflicts us with memories of the past haunts us and we are prisoners to what yesterday was like but if you could only see yourself as God sees you and you could get a glimpse that God never sees you now the way that you used to be but maybe there's a spirit Waring in your flesh of what you used to be and used to be why not tonight get a Divine Healing for that as well brother Brandon would talk about in spiritual Amnesia if you can just give me just a few moments in spiritual Amnesia he would talk about there was a there was some War boys soldiers and they'd been at War and as they had been at War they had forgot who they were he said kind of getting between two opinions will cause that they had forgot who they were and they were scarred and they didn't know where home was they'd put him on a train and take him to a place to where that they would be taken care of be cared for by tender hands but brother brand we'll talk about a story to where that this train would come to a stop and and they would let them get off and stretch their legs just a little bit and as they would get off and stretch their legs the story of the day was that there was one boy that that was looking around and as he was looking around there was a water tower and it seemed familiar to him and he and he just started walking and the guard instead of stopping him said I I think I'll follow him and he began to follow him and and as he was walking he noticed that he went up over the hill and went down and went up over another Hill and he was following a path and we go over the hill a couple of different places and he would look look and there was a little smoke coming from a a chimney there's a little house over there and he began to walk down and he as he walked down there was a man standing in the yard at the gate and the guard witnessed a miracle and that father was standing there and he said son I thought you was dead I thought you was dead welcome home welcome home or if we could see the water tower tonight I'm sorry that some have been scarred in so many directions and got different thoughts about different things and sometimes us as ministers may seem like that we were extending Grace like never before but you don't realize when we when we see that there's a seat of God on the inside of an individual we'll go to the ends of the Earth a real man of God will never give up on [Applause] you why would brother brandham hunt with a man named Burke call he called him o lizard I wickedest man he ever met a prophet that is going to reveal the mysteries of the book that as a spokesman for this age even would be confused with God himself but God would allow him to have time with Bert call let me just say this you God will take time for you you say God don't care for me let me just say this to you God cares and as long as there's breath in your lungs he still cares brother Ron I'm going to need a quote for that okay Jesus talked about a a a boy in a hog pin and you know he was talking to people that didn't identified with Hogs they were so religious and they were had a law and they'd put you in hell in a moment but Jesus talks about a man that is wanted to have all of his father's goods and he spent it all on riotous living but notice the father didn't give up on him notice he didn't give up on him and that boy found himself when the friends were gone found himself in a hog pin in a horrible Place one day he realized that my father's servants have it better than what I have something inside of him said it's time to go home now no man can come to the father except the father draws him there's no man can come but let me just say this you I dare not want to stand in one's way when he's on his way home [Applause] home brother Ron why are you going in this direction my boss told me to go in this direction he's interested in that last seed I don't know where it'll be sitting but he's interested in that last seed and none of us are going anywhere until that last one comes in when that boy made his way home he found a father that didn't condemn him he found a father that loved him as much as he ever loved him I would say this to you I've disappointed the Lord many times but he's never throwed me [Music] away now for those that are self-righteous you you've disappointed him too maybe with an attitude or a thought out of place even toward one another Satan if he can't get you he'll get you to throw rocks at one another we're family I want to remind you under this Divine Healing we're all going to sit at the same table and it won't matter who can quote the most or who has the greatest Revelation or who is the most intellectual or who is the most anointed we've all got a seat at the table and I'm going to thank God that day that I made it Hallelujah I was not worthy but God in his [Applause] blood oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah now we realize that sickness comes not from God it comes from an enemy it's under the law of sin and death but we realize that we have power to pray brother Brenham tells us that prayer is the key it's the answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in control of human beings there's no atom IC bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as [Music] prayer it's still active today Isaiah 53 and verse 5 said but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the Chas but of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed if Satan you know he thinks he's so smart but if it would only realize that when this man takes this beaten it's going to be the inoculation sickness cure [Applause] Hallelujah if he's so smart with the word of God he would have never touch Jesus Jesus would have died an old man so the devil's not so smart and he'll afflict a child of God knowing that they have a right yeah and there's a blood and there's a scripture that said I don't have to to live this way I can be healed he cared enough he cared enough to conquer every enemy for you that all you have to do is to be sincere and believe it he conquered death and death ain't nothing for me to conquer it's already conquered sickness ain't for me to conquer it can't it it ain't nothing he said for Christ to conquer it's already conquered I just have to care enough to believe it are you afraid what somebody else Will has told you are you afraid of a doctor's diagnosis are you afraid of what the church will say to you are you afraid to stand there toe-to-toe with the devil and say I've confessed my sins I've laid aside everything and I believe in every word Here I Am Lord create in me you cared for me I care for you and now we are more than conquerors we just walk right into it as an inheritance more than conquerors we're dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated brother said I wish I was twice as size I am now we are disputing yeah he's twice my size we are disputing with a a conquered enemy could you say that with me we are disputing with a conquered enemy Give the Lord a good hand now once we're healed once God blesses us we have an obligation to thank him for it you know that's the reason that we come to church and we have song Services it's to bring us out of the atmosphere of the world and you know and we're not here to be entertained we're we're here to lift our worship before the Lord now whether you're a quiet person or the loudest person in the building we all have an obligation to enter into worship now entering into worship is not just for the men of God to to preach to you but then you respond to it and when you respond you're not just responding you know for even for yourself to hear it but you're responding to where that your enemy hears it and you identify with what the word says am oh but I think it but God didn't ask you to think it he asked you to confess it so worship is a part of confessing it and if you remember God gave people talents and he gave them gifts and he gave them healings and and one time there was many that went away but two came back to praise him and thank him for it I would like to be a part of those that came back to say thank you I'm in a situation of my life I thank him for every day I thank him for every hour I don't just take it for granted I I very much thank him I have found out what's really important to me amen amen and Psalms 150 is a good spot to stop and thinking praise ye the Lord hallah Praise God in his Sanctuary Praise Him in the firment of his power praise him for his mighty acts Praise Him according to his excellent greatness that's for his works praise him for his works praise him for his healings praise him for the gifts in the body praise him for what he has done for you you're not a here by an accident praise him for that don't take for sitting in this building for granted Satan's done everything that he can to stop you from being setting [Applause] here oh hallelujah praise him with the sound of a trumpet praise him with a saucery and a harp doesn't sound like a quiet place praise him with a timble and a dance praise him with stringed instruments and organs praise him with loud sounding symbol praise him on the high sounding symbols let everything that hath [Applause] breath let everything that half breath praise ye the Lord [Applause] Hallelujah brother Ron you're going to make us Pentecostal exactly the original ones but brother Ron I I came out of a dead Church well there's a healing line for that yes sir there's a healing line for that there's a blood for that brother Ron but my church don't do that you might want to [Applause] move why should we be scared of worshiping the Lord they worship at a hockey game they worship at a football game they worship Hall they worship why shouldn't we worship the King of Kings and the Lord of lords for he is good and his mercies endure [Music] forever we ought to thank God I'm free I'm free I'm free I've been born [Applause] again now I would say this to you if if you're dead you have a right to set dead still but I will identify somebody that's dead still and quiet and don't want nothing to do with worship they're spiritually dead but you don't have to stay that way there's a better life it's kind of like being married you should tell your wife she's the most beautiful woman in the [Music] world you better tell her she's the most beautiful woman in the world you tell her how much you love her every day multiple times brother Ron I'm just not that kind of person you need to you need [Applause] Jesus cuz marriage besides the Lord is the greatest thing that God did for you you're going to spend eternity with that little woman you stepped out of time into eternity you say where does this fit in a healing line some of your marriages need a real touch from God you need to fall in love with one another quit you fighting quit you fussing quit you Ste create an atmosphere where Jesus Will coming your home rep prayer the prayer the altar of your home don't let brother Brown's voice become a stranger there anymore let your children see the real Christ the real sermons living on the inside of you amen you take your place man you take your place sisters live in harmony you didn't know you came to a marriage counseling service did youu now if Jesus won't live in a vessel that's contaminated by sin he won't live in a [Music] home he won't live in a home that's fussing and stewing all the time let's quit being actors here let's be real and neither will he live in a church we as men of God don't have to beat people into it we need to love them and do it we need to care for them and do it we need to live like Jesus sometimes we think well why am I having so much trouble brother brandham says and why does God let troubles come but he said he God harnesses trouble and puts bit in its mouths and makes it obey him and it's those troubles that bring us into closer fellowship with God a Sayan that struck home with me the other day said I asked God why are you taking me through trouble water and he replied to me it's because your enemies can't swim [Applause] brother BR said it's in those crucial hours that press us onto those sacred Sands it was in the Bible and and now and remember no matter how great the distress is Satan cannot take your life until God is finished with you I want you to say this with me Satan cannot take your life until God is finished with you so why should we fear death there is nothing that can happen to you unless God permits it there's no evil can come unless God permits it notice these next word and it's for your good he's working that brother sister now let us turn our camera and turn it back to that dark afternoon 1900 years years ago this afternoon looking going up a hill I hear thumping what is it it's an Old Rugged Cross going up the hillside it's dragging out those bloody Footprints of the bear and as it's bumping over those rocks as it went through the street I look over all of his back and its specks all over and that robe is without seam and and God of creation packing the very cross that he created Emmanuel's blood begins to flow through his back and spots and and as he goes up the hill them stop them spots be begin to get bigger and bigger and all at once they go into one great big splotch of blood and against his little humble body weakly legs they begin to Splat what is it is his dropping it he's dropped his shoulder his human strength what was it God hiding himself in Simplicity that was God packing that cross here he goes up the hill stumbling the blood running out out of him he fell Simon picked up that cross to help him with it and as he goes up the hill the devil said you know what I I know that he's not God I know he's not he would never do that I've got him now I've conquered every man I've got him so I know that that ain't God so he sent the bee of death to sting him and as that bee begin to H around him you know bees insects that have stingers death's in the stinger and you know a an insect ever ever stings death it begins to pull that stinger out so it is ever anchored in a man an ordinary man if he's been an ordinary man a prophet he's he's had that stung and many a prophet has died but when he stung this one when he sunk his Stinger into the Lamb of God he no longer had the sting of death he pulled it inside him himself for you if you would have been the only one he pulled it inside of himself for you yeah now you remember in Jonesboro Arkansas brother brandham is taken a break from the service he's walking through the crowd that that City now that's a small city has become three times its size because of the meeting people are coming to see coming from afar and he hears a a girl calling out and she's going she's calling papa papa where's my papa and brother brandom listen not by chance comes to her and ask her what she's looking for she said I I'm looking for my papa my papa told me to stand here but the crowd has pushed me and I I I've lost my place and I've lost my father what did you come here for we come here to see the Healer and and he said I thought I'd just talked to her little bit kind of he would apologize for being that way and he would talk to her a full little you don't believe that oh yes we heard about a blind man that that was blind and and he got healed at this meeting that man was actually sitting under a red light when his eyes came open I've said at that red light these are not just stories and I'm not just rehearsing a story now and brother brandham says now he talked to her and he said you don't believe that do you yes sir yes sir I do I do see I I have cataracts that's wrapped around once they became ripe they wrapped around my Optical nerves and and they give me no hope and I'm blind and he begins to talk to her and he says well I guess you ought to know that I'm Willam brandham she locked the hold of him she locked the hold of his leels of his jacket wouldn't let him go let me just say hold on to God while he's passing through in this service grab a hold of him touch the him of His Garment while he passes by notice in brother bram's prayer he said remember Lord she being a black woman remember Lord when when Simon Serene picked up your cross and and carried it for you this blood will take care of black white yellow pink it'll take care of everyone of us no Christian should have any Prejudice whatsoever it's a healing line for that too notice what she told him said if I can get to the Healer I can find my daddy if I can get to the Healer tonight brother Ron if I can get to the Healer tonight my marriage will will be different I can come back to God I'll see the water [Applause] tower if I can fall in love with Jesus this message won't become mechanical [Applause] anymore I Love to Worship the Lord I love to praise the Lord young people we don't have to sit de still you don't have to be so quiet but if you fall in love with [Applause] Jesus I remember I remember brother Mino was I was a young man 22 23 years old when I Found Jesus I knew that I was lost as a Goose and God rich in Mercy reached down into my life and he saved me from being a drug addict I was raised in this message I heard the tapes I knew the quotes but when Jesus became real to [Applause] me I had danced for the devil and I sure enjoyed dancing with my new partner believe that works brother Ron I was on an airplane I was I had preached a meeting and I was wore out and tired being wore out and tired I got to the plane and they bumped me this week's hadn't been the only time I've had trouble with planes and they said we don't have a place for you we we're we're going to have to move you so they moved me to a complete different airplane that new airplane I I didn't get a good seat it was against the wind and two great big guys was one great big guy and another fell was sitting beside of me and you know the fell beside of me was so talkative he was just a yak yak yak y y y y and he was just jacking away and he was telling me all about life and their insurance company he was telling me how great his boss was and you know for almost two hours they just he just talked away the other fell sitting on the other side was looking at a newspaper he literally had nothing to say he kind of sat pitch forward looking at the news paper kind of bored with life and he was sitting there and the guy in the middle finally said what do you do and I said well I'm a preacher and he said well what do you preach and I didn't have time to fool with him I said I preached the message of William Mar and brandom and the Man in the aisle said really he said I grew up in the message he told me the story of squirrels and he told me the story of had him right and he told me a couple of different things so I would identify that he knew what I was talking about him he said but my life is so wrecked and so horribly tore apart he said I can never find my way back and I told him begin to talk to him about praying for him and I'll be remembering you in prayer we got off of the airplane I was trying to catch him and he got ahead and they were gone for about 20 years I told that story about that man what I was telling the story for was I was looking for the man in the audience one day I'd meet that man new people moved into our church and we were having a gathering with them and having a dinner there was a man sitting beside of me and you know and as he was sitting beside of me and I was sitting with him you know and we were just conversing and now he looks much different 20 years later whether you know it or not you look different 20 years later and right and I I said we've met before he said no no you and I have never met before and I said oh yes we've we've met before he said no sir I can I can tell you 100% for sure we've met not met before and I said well let me just share with you the event the Lord just whispered in my ear that you were the man hallu you was a man on an airplane and you told me about the message and your your your associate sat and talked with me but at the end you told me that you had been raised in the message and your life was in turmoil and he sat there at that table and he said my God here I am 20 years in horror 20 years in horrible life and I've been invited to this service and you've just told me who I [Applause] am that man now has come to himself and he's a real believer sets at our church believes the message with all of his heart don't tell me is not [Applause] caring little girl comes to service and she comes and she's got tattoos all over she comes with her boyfriend because her boyfriend's parents sat on the front row of our church that boy's been in drugs for years he's been in trouble for years he's in prison right now but that girl came one service that boy was arrested in a couple days and next weekend she was back horrible looking shape sin had wrecked her life just tore completely apart marriages failed had a child about 8 years old living almost homeless we watched God begin to wash her [Music] [Applause] brother Ron but you just extending Grace what you too [Applause] yeah you too God so cleaned her up she was living in a place to where there was an older man that was give her a shelter to stay and he saw such a change in her life tell he would come to church with her ruffle coder we would say at home God rich in Mercy he walked to the Altar and he said I don't know what I've got to be to do to get saved and get what she's got [Music] [Applause] we was in a prayer line and he's heard Mariah puit story had Al Capia no hair would grow on her body the disease had set in and now she's losing all of her hair it was in that prayer line that she came and she brought three bobby pins and she said I believe that I can wear these I'll be needing these God came and touched her life if you could see her today many of you seen the pictures of her heard her testimony but she's got long flowing beautiful hair it was in that meeting that at the end I would be carried to a cabin but just before I was carried to a cabin the Lord whispered in my ear wait for Jessica wait for Jessica Martin you would know her as wendles he's here wait for Jessica Martin and I waited for just almost hundreds of people and finally Jessica stepped I didn't know her need but he did you've heard the story of how he WR and all of us appreciate that story but she had a boy in trouble in a lot of trouble I'm not so worried about your past I'm worried about your [Applause] future and the Lord spoke to her you was in a vessel and said I give you your son I give you your son and today her son is saved and is married and is a pillar in the church immediately after that they would carry me off to a cabin this story may have you have heard but it's still true you don't have to embellish the truth brother Tim PR's son-in-law Aaron ausby was not a preacher at least he didn't know it and he carries me in he's a height of this fell here and he carries me in and as he's carrying me in I said you'll never be the same God's calling you to preach the gospel and he flung up against the wall and God came down and filled his life like never before and let me me to say he's not just a preacher he is a convention preacher when God does a job he does it extremely well and I sat down spinning in the Holy Spirit and I saw a vision of a little boy coming across the yard in a Mickey Mouse shirt with his finger up like that and Andrew was standing in front of me and I said I see a little boy a boy of impossibility and Andrew immediately responded not me daddyy not me Daddy I said no it'll be Whitney and Davey now Whitney was born with a condition to where that she was impossible to have a children and she married knowing that they couldn't have children but God thinks something greater Davy was in an accident that story was told it was believed that that story now was about 3 years old and God's not in really Hur and so anyway as as as time would go Davy was in an accident hit ice and flipped him up in a tree and crushed his pelvis that pelvis was so crushed until I heard the doctor say you'll never have children because it's crushed all of that part the vision still holds I'm going to talk to you about some impossible situations now they came came through the prayer line about a year later and the angel of the Lord was there I said Whitney being my daughter I said Whitney it's time for that baby now let me just say this to you I had never uttered these words but God not only showed me was a boy he not only showed me his eye color and his hair color but he told me his name now that's not too hard for God because it comes out of the book don't take that so strange it comes out of the book and so when I walked into the the room that day they said we'd like to tell you his name I said let me tell you his name his name is a Isaac Jackson Braden that's exactly right brother Ron I said that's what the Lord said it would [Applause] be I had a nephew that was that was so lost it seemed like no hope he had had Promises of playing professional football in America that's a great big deal but he had promises to playing professional football he was now living in a Dusty Rusty basement musty and you could smell it on his clothes he was living a very wretched life I was getting ready to have brain surgery and he came and he sat at the side of my bed and he just sat there that day before Co everybody could come and they wasn't thinking maybe even I would live through it so they let everybody in and so you know everybody was there maybe 30 to 50 people was in the room it was eating Mexican food I couldn't eat they was eating Mexican food somebody said amen they was wrapping it in those things you know and they were enjoying it you know and all of a sudden that room became empty it was just me and him I looked over at him and I said Gabriel I don't believe that what's just happened is by accident everybody left but you I said you see I'm not the greatest need in the room I said what you need Gabriel's Jesus it don't take 10 years 15 years to grow your way into it so in just a few moments I begin to speak to him and Jesus came in the room and in a few moments he walked back into that they walked back into that room and I said I have an announcement the boy that was sitting here isn't here no more but there's a new man he left where he was living he moved in with me he got transfer ferred in his Trooper job and he's a State Trooper he got transferred God just so miraculous and moveed things around God gave him a queen for a wife had a baby born the day beautifully Miracles taking place there he's not just a good boy but he's now a deacon in our church brother Ron I don't believe in Visions like that anymore well I'm sorry I'm sorry amen I can't manufacture these things and I don't embellish these things I just learned a long time just tell the truth and then God will amen it cuz I don't want you to look at me I I want to tell you these things that not I could talk to you about howy right I could talk to you about the woman in Memphis I could talk to you about all the stories but I want to tell you there's a God that's [Applause] here and if he's come he's come for you [Applause] I'd been invited with brother Tim PR and brother Timothy PR brother Jason Jackson to preach a meeting at brother Danny steeman church it was the last morning that we were going to be there and I had a vision I had a vision that I was entering a pit and it was the most horrible pit of my life and in this depth of this pit I'd never seen I'd never seen the Calamity or the chaos that would be in this Darkness it was so thick it was so oppressing it was so depressing there's not enough words that I could say to it but at the bottom of the pit I found a niece she was a girl that had left her husband and she had entered a wretched life everybody said a lot of things against you not me I'm careful how I talk about those things I didn't throw any Stones cuz I know what Jesus can do Facebook said a lot of things Instagram said a lot of things a lot of people gave up a lot of people stowed stones but I had a vision and at the bottom of the pit I asked her I said are you ready to go home yes I am and I took her by the arm and we begin to walk out of that pit do you know that L that girl sits in our church now a girl of Grace a girl of Mercy a girl that has been restored a girl back with her husband I was called one night to a the bedside of a girl that would had hated me and said said a lot of bad things about me they give her hours to live she weighed 85 lbs and she was green she was green as some of your clothes the nurse was sitting at watch and her daughters was there her husband was sitting beside of her and when I walked in it was late at night the Lord had spoke to me go to her side so I figured if the Lord had spoke to me to go he had business to attend to now I'll tell you the reason why I'm here I'm probably the sickest man in the room but I'm here under commission to help you and I'm going be straight up with the devil right now honest to God facts with with papers that tall I'm probably the sickest man in this room but I'm not afraid of the sickness I may be afflicted but I'm not defeated I don't need notches on my belt I don't need nobody to praise me but I'm here because God sent me this year especially and put an incredible burden on for me to be here and while I was expressing my burden brother Ed immediately wrote me and told me he wanted me to come God answers on both ends of the line he don't pull a meeting together just to see if he pulls a meeting together he gathered his people he knows your condition he's come to your bed side right now he knows what's going on in your life whether you're in the seen audience or the Unseen audience I told her husband he was telling me I'd like for you to preach the funeral I'd like for you to you know get us through this tragic event and I said you know I don't think that the Lord sent me here to get funeral preparations she'd been out of her for maybe days weeks and hadn't said or uttered a word and I took her by her little head and I rolled it over to me and her eyes that hadn't been open for for now days rolled up and looked right in my eyes and I said Tabatha you may have hated me for a long time you may have said a lot of things and you may have been not understanding of me you may not have loved me but I'm here for you I want to tell you I haven't come to preach your funeral I've come to tell you that there's a Jesus that can heal you and I begin to pray for that girl and as I prayed I felt the presence of God drop in the room I turned to her husband in that impossible situation and I said she'll walk down the hall with you tomorrow [Music] don't look at what you're seeing don't look at your impossible situation don't look at it don't keep your eyes on that you focus on Jesus you just walk into the vision you walk into a well body you begin to take steps you can't do nothing but move your finger move your fer start thanking God for your healing the next day she rolled out of that bed and walked down that hallway the nurse told me on the way out she said I don't I don't believe you understand I don't believe you gave them a false hope and I said I didn't say it Jesus said it you said well brother Ron I I believe I can get my healing while the word Goes Forth I believe that too I was preaching at a huge meeting this is a large congregation but that audience is about three or four times his size as I preached there was an older man with with braces on his legs and crutches to this day I don't know he's name but he began to walk as I preached and he moved about like this right here as he walked he was making his way past tent poles as as he was making his way past one tent to pole he would take a break for a little while and makeing making a little bit further and he would take a break for a little while he make a little bit further and he got to the front of the place and when he got to the front of the place he throw his crutches down he thought his braces off he ran all over that place this okay this okay I was overseas so I wouldn't know anybody this lady was sitting there about where you're sitting and she was sitting there and I just kept getting get draw to her I said I believe if you'll stand to your feet you have pancreas cancer and they've only gave you weeks to live she said that's right brother Ron I said Jesus is your healer she's still alive today there's nothing impossible with God lady told me she said Tuesday I'm going to deliver a dead baby I said let God breathe life in to that womb just now I prayed for her and a healthy boy was born out of that dead womb so don't tell me God can't still work he's not dead that didn't leave the earth when a prophet left the Earth We're still commissioned to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover let's remind him of the prophet's prayer Satan I JW you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ leave this person leave this person Satan you're defeated in the name of Jesus Christ you were whipped at Calvary you don't have arrows for your own bow you have no legal Authority it's for you if you will believe brother Ron I've I've gotten a little bitter in my spirit I'm coming to a close I've gotten a little bitter in my spirit my prayer life is left and I've got critical everpresent water from the Rocks brother Bram explains that he said it once was a beautiful flower but Without Rain Without Rain it'll begin to curl up and it'll get become a sticker and then it's just constantly punching at everything if you're not careful you'll get a critical spirit and nothing's right in church songs this music the heat in the a fans blowing over your head who said in your Pew preachers too loud he preaches too long what do you need you need an oldfashioned Revival in your heart you need a refreshing in your [Music] spirit you don't have to be that way no longer you just need an attitude change in your life maybe you don't understand the road that your pastor's taken taking through a journey but God shows him a certain way to operate and it's that Pastor many times he'll go directions that'll disappoint you but God's Got A Plan God's Got A Plan he'll leave 90 and n and go get [Applause] one he'll show Grace when you feel like law needs to be beat how long has it been since you've had an oldfashioned prayer meeting in your home I'm talking about when the pillar fire comes down saturates you and your your tongue becomes a tongue that not only speaks English but it begins to speak in a heavenly language how long has it been since you had an old fashion refreshing of the Holy Ghost oh but I got filled with the Holy Ghost 30 years ago what about a [Applause] refreshing what a matter of refreshing brother Ron I'll be I'm afraid I'll get fanatical glory to God but brother Ron you know you know we get so critical would we have been Critical with brother brandom dancing around a tree would we have been a critical of brother R shouting and Glory would we have been critical at the end of this service with brother brandham walking across the pull pit swinging in his [Applause] coat thank you Lord we want deep preaching sometimes we need an oldfashioned [Applause] shakan we need a fresh breath to get inside with some of these mommies God's not coming back for a mannequin he's coming back for a bride that loves him worships him praise is [Applause] him Lord brother Ron I I've got an impossible situation can I give you one more I was speaking at brother Roy shrewsbury's church that just went on to be with the Lord and a woman with hair to her ankles came they'll probably hear this service and she came and she said brother Ron I want my husband he lives in Florida with another woman but I want him to come home and be a real husband to me and I wanted him to give his life to Jesus I'll be honest with you it was hard for me to have faith for that brother men I prayed I said these words as your faith is so be it done unto you amen yes oh what a meeting we had Hallelujah brother Roy said brother Ron would you come back next week and preach for us I believe it's the leadership of the Lord and I said well I I've got plans he said could you break those plans I believe God wants you to be here next week so I preached the next week large audience came down and I I preached on a Saving Grace of Jesus Christ the woman at the well that I just read to you about the end of the service there was a man that came running to the alter that crowd erupted I didn't know what was going on but that crowd erupted and I was down with him I was down with him praying and as I was praying with him you know after a while he had a breakthrough he jumped up and picked this little guy up and shouted around with meall brother Shrewsberry said do you know who that is I said no he said that's the woman's husband that she prayed for last week don't tell me he your children can't come home don't tell me that the Holy Ghost can't go get them don't tell me that there's a god of impossib ities why he's the same God here today I'll tell you what a powerful situation that took place that man became a pastor of the church there's nothing impossible [Applause] thank he just hug my neck the other day the blood still holds you it still holds isn't he wonderful isn't he wonderful now I would like for you now to say Lord help my un believe Lord help my critical spirit Terry he came and got you and just to let you know he still loves you I was preaching a while back and while I was preaching I saw a vision of her sitting on a park bench and she was crying out to God so I told your story in the pull pit and as I told the story in the Pulpit I told you that God still loved you and you would hear the service that I preached and I'm thousands of miles away God knows how to come and get you he loves you he loves you he loves you you came through this prayer line with a lung disease is't that right and while I prayed for you I'm not a doctor but I told you exactly that the name of that disease too long for me to even say but God uttered it through these lips he's that God he's a Healer a't that right ain't that right brother John was in a meeting he just spoke to us just before the service was over come to start I spoke to him and three or four years ago in a line in a line specifically in British Columbia it was at Mount Baker camp in a tent meeting it was exactly what he needed to hear now he's a preacher of the Gospel of Jesus Christ [Applause] it's so powerful behind this pull pit now I kind of takes my breath just a bit brother Dwayne why has why has he come why has he come for your needs why is he come for your needs why is he come young people your daddy may be a preacher may be a deacon may have been as a pillar of this church for years but what about you do you know him do you know him you may not be able to get a hold of me but you can get a hold of Jesus you may not be able to grab me by the lapel but there's a Jesus in the room th son of David have mercy upon me prodal I don't care what your situation is there's a seed there's a blood come home but I'll be throw stones at not by me right not by Jesus come home I believe the same way as for all these ministers sitting in the building you may have looked at them with wrong attitudes or wrong situ situations but let me just say there's a Jesus on the inside of them that they preach with love and care they'll help you but when you feel like you're you're so alone I want to quote a scripture for you he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you thank you Lord now he saw you before the foundation of the world he sees your situation now right but he sees where you're going let's bow our heads just for a moment we're preparing to have a prayer
