[1:02:12] who can be against us
[1:02:26] i've seen some valleys walk through some
[1:02:30] darkness waded through rivers of greece
[1:02:35] and the enemy told me that i was
[1:02:39] forsaken no one was fighting for me
[1:02:45] but i didn't make it this far on my own
[1:02:50] though often my strength was all gone
[1:02:55] the hands of a savior keep holding me up
[1:02:59] his promise of help is my song
[1:03:06] if god is for
[1:03:08] me
[1:03:10] who can stand against me
[1:03:15] [Music]
[1:03:24] if it's just me and jesus
[1:03:29] i can't be defeated
[1:03:34] when my god is with me
[1:03:37] i've got the victory
[1:03:39] every time
[1:03:43] [Music]
[1:03:45] he may be calling for you
[1:03:48] to follow to places you think you can't
[1:03:52] go
[1:03:54] and people will tell you that you'll
[1:03:57] never
[1:03:58] make it you can't win this fight all
[1:04:02] along
[1:04:04] if it's a choice to trust or to that
[1:04:08] just remember what he always does
[1:04:13] yet he'll never fail me and never will
[1:04:18] the battle
[1:04:22] [Music]
[1:04:24] is for
[1:04:26] me
[1:04:28] who can stand against me
[1:04:33] no weapon shall prosper
[1:04:38] for when god's on my side
[1:04:42] if it's just me and jesus
[1:04:47] i can't be defeated
[1:04:52] but my god is with me
[1:04:55] i've got the victory
[1:04:57] every time
[1:05:01] oh if god
[1:05:05] [Music]
[1:05:08] against me
[1:05:11] no heaven shall prosper

[1:05:20] if it's just me and jesus
[1:05:25] i can't be defeated
[1:05:30] my god is with me
[1:05:33] i've got the
[1:05:34] victory every time
[1:05:39] when my god is with me
[1:05:42] i've got the victory
[1:05:45] every time
[1:05:49] [Music]
[1:06:01] amen
[1:06:04] victory is in him
[1:06:07] hallelujah
[1:06:08] we're going to change the order of the
[1:06:10] service here this morning
[1:06:11] we'll ask our brothers to come
[1:06:13] why don't we stand
[1:06:17] not sure which way to go here fast or
[1:06:19] slow but i think we're going to go fast
[1:06:22] amen we're uh
[1:06:24] we're always facing battles
[1:06:27] it's a song that we've sang many times
[1:06:29] but you know what
[1:06:30] if you're a climber
[1:06:32] and god gives you the strength you can
[1:06:34] climb
[1:06:36] because there's mountains that will have
[1:06:37] to climb
[1:06:38] and it takes some stamina to go downward
[1:06:40] too
[1:06:41] if it's a steep
[1:06:43] valley well he'll take can give you
[1:06:45] strength to go down too but he's always
[1:06:47] there
[1:06:48] whether it's valleys or mountains or
[1:06:50] whatever it is but i thank god
[1:06:53] that we have someone beside us every day
[1:06:56] well we're always facing bad and it's
[1:06:59] hard to keep the base cause satan never
[1:07:04] lets him in his fight for when he plays
[1:07:08] but i'll have the lord to guide every
[1:07:11] step along the way so when satan comes
[1:07:16] against me you can't always hear me say
[1:07:21] well that's no hill four o'clock that's
[1:07:24] no battle for a child of god
[1:07:29] [Music]
[1:07:41] [Music]
[1:07:46] well every time i try to do a little
[1:07:50] something for my lord satan tries to
[1:07:54] block my
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:08:08] he'll hear me
[1:08:14] [Music]
[1:08:18] satan's already been defeated and the
[1:08:21] victory's
[1:08:23] [Music]
[1:08:32] [Music]
[1:08:35] one more time

[1:18:21] the powerful message we heard last night
[1:18:24] and the grace of god it just gives us
[1:18:27] gives us all uh a boost and
[1:18:29] encouragement
[1:18:31] and um we are so blessed by brother ron
[1:18:34] his ministry the lord is certainly using
[1:18:36] him
[1:18:37] in ways that
[1:18:39] would have never been done if just a
[1:18:40] miracle had taken place and
[1:18:42] and uh he hadn't had to go through this
[1:18:45] but to see him persevere under trial
[1:18:48] amen has been an inspiration to us all
[1:18:51] and i know many of you have drawn
[1:18:54] strength from that as i have and
[1:18:56] we have been so blessed to see the lord
[1:19:00] just bring him through
[1:19:01] one thing after another and god just
[1:19:04] coming on the scene
[1:19:06] you know i i remember what was a dozen
[1:19:09] years ago when i
[1:19:11] visit him in the hospital
[1:19:12] and um he had
[1:19:14] he had been in a very severe burn and
[1:19:17] they were not expecting him to live and
[1:19:20] and uh i walked into the hospital room
[1:19:22] and i felt like i had all the prayers of
[1:19:25] all the believers from everywhere around
[1:19:27] the world
[1:19:28] i i if i i said if i ever felt like a
[1:19:32] high priest then i felt it then you know
[1:19:34] where you you come in with the incense
[1:19:36] of all the other prayers and offering
[1:19:38] before god and we laid hands upon him
[1:19:41] and prayed with him there and i i told
[1:19:44] him i whispered in his ear and i said i
[1:19:47] have not come
[1:19:48] to to to anoint you for death i have
[1:19:52] come to anoint you for life
[1:19:55] and then we saw the holy spirit move and
[1:19:58] and and as i prayed i just said lord let
[1:20:01] me
[1:20:02] let me before i leave here because he
[1:20:04] had taken a turn for the worse even
[1:20:06] after that and
[1:20:07] the doctors had given up on him said he
[1:20:09] would die and and was about to
[1:20:12] harvest his organs you've heard the
[1:20:14] story and and uh i prayed there with my
[1:20:17] wife there at a crack of barrel as i
[1:20:20] went to see him i said lord i've got to
[1:20:22] leave today but don't let me leave
[1:20:24] without seeing my friend
[1:20:27] raised up from there and doing well and
[1:20:29] and
[1:20:30] we saw that victory as we
[1:20:33] before we left we saw him up talking and
[1:20:36] speaking and
[1:20:37] amen on his way to recovery
[1:20:40] and god's still god
[1:20:42] amen
[1:20:43] [Music]
[1:20:44] amen
[1:20:46] he's god on the mountain he's god in the
[1:20:49] valley he's god in our great troubles
[1:20:52] god is still god and he'll be god for
[1:20:54] you
[1:20:55] amen this morning so let's just talk to
[1:20:58] him right now as we just bow before the
[1:21:00] throne of grace and
[1:21:02] maybe as we would approach the father
[1:21:07] maybe you'd want to lift a hand to him
[1:21:09] and say lord don't pass me by
[1:21:11] you just minister to me in some way
[1:21:15] i need you father
[1:21:18] pass me not o gentle savior you're my
[1:21:20] humble cry
[1:21:22] [Music]
[1:21:23] while another
[1:21:25] you are
[1:21:26] calling let me reach out and get ahold
[1:21:29] of your garment today
[1:21:31] let my faith touch you
[1:21:34] lord you can even pull from the minister
[1:21:37] my faith can't even pull him to say
[1:21:39] things he didn't even have in his notes
[1:21:41] or he didn't think of and
[1:21:43] stop just by my pew and minister to me
[1:21:46] he knows my name he knows my situation
[1:21:49] he's a deserter of every thought intent
[1:21:52] of the heart
[1:21:54] lord jesus today
[1:21:57] i want to raise my hands to both of them
[1:21:59] i just need you
[1:22:02] i can't find the way without you
[1:22:07] i must have your leadership and guidance
[1:22:10] and i stand here lord in a very very
[1:22:15] tremendous place this morning
[1:22:19] to address this portion of your bride
[1:22:21] your people
[1:22:23] it's an awesome responsibility
[1:22:26] somewhat a terrible responsibility
[1:22:30] but lord
[1:22:33] you've ordained us and called us in this
[1:22:36] hour in this time and you're able to
[1:22:39] direct the word to the target exactly
[1:22:41] what is needed
[1:22:44] and there are many that have raised a
[1:22:46] hand towards you
[1:22:47] they didn't raise it toward me they know
[1:22:49] i can't help them
[1:22:51] i'm just a human like them
[1:22:53] immortal
[1:22:55] and i need you as much as they do
[1:22:58] but lord i pray today that as they
[1:23:00] lifted a hand towards you
[1:23:02] you being the intercessor our approach
[1:23:05] to spirit god
[1:23:07] is through the man christ jesus
[1:23:09] and we're so thankful you came and
[1:23:11] tasted
[1:23:13] humanity and experienced what we
[1:23:15] experienced
[1:23:16] so that we would have a high priest that
[1:23:18] we could go to
[1:23:21] who could be touched by the feelings of
[1:23:23] our infirmities who would know what it
[1:23:25] meant
[1:23:26] to be a man and suffer as men do
[1:23:30] and i pray lord that today you'll just
[1:23:33] respond to their need
[1:23:35] as i just take each one of them
[1:23:38] spiritually by the hand now
[1:23:40] they lifted the hand towards you and
[1:23:42] said lord i need you
[1:23:45] and i take them by the hand and before
[1:23:47] the throne right now and
[1:23:49] and i say jesus you see what your enemy
[1:23:51] the devil has done to your children
[1:23:55] your bride your spouse lord
[1:23:59] we know god as a man something would
[1:24:01] rise up in us if somebody was doing that
[1:24:03] to our wife
[1:24:05] we know something's got to move in your
[1:24:07] heart when you look on your people
[1:24:10] as we quote the prophet of god when
[1:24:12] satan takes after one of god's little
[1:24:14] ones he's got jesus christ on his hands
[1:24:18] lord today
[1:24:20] we're like esther
[1:24:22] we're like esther coming before the
[1:24:24] throne and
[1:24:25] we're saying this wicked haman
[1:24:28] this wicked one you see what he's been
[1:24:30] doing to your children you see what he's
[1:24:32] threatening to do
[1:24:34] move on our behalf
[1:24:37] move on to our behalf
[1:24:39] hang him on that same
[1:24:41] that same noose with that same noose
[1:24:43] that he had designed to destroy us
[1:24:46] destroy him
[1:24:49] i pray in the name of jesus that you'll
[1:24:51] intercede on the behalf of your people
[1:24:54] because you ever live to make
[1:24:55] intercession on behalf of our confession
[1:24:58] and we confess lord
[1:25:00] it's all paid for
[1:25:03] [Music]
[1:25:04] our debt is clean
[1:25:05] and we are clean before you
[1:25:08] so we can come boldly before your throne
[1:25:12] we can ask help in the time of need
[1:25:15] now as we look to the word lord
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:20] as i said they're just
[1:25:22] thoughts
[1:25:24] lord i did my best to try to find a
[1:25:29] level of communication with you to

[1:26:36] hospitality and
[1:26:38] this wonderful invitation to be here and
[1:26:41] thank you to
[1:26:42] all the ministers that have come and and
[1:26:46] and uh supported the meeting it wouldn't
[1:26:48] be what it is without you and all the
[1:26:50] different folks from different places
[1:26:52] and
[1:26:53] the hometown here in edmonton we
[1:26:55] appreciate each one of you and i want to
[1:26:57] just say thank you
[1:26:59] amen for your kind attention and your
[1:27:02] love to us and you you know i i'd love
[1:27:04] to be able to shake hands with every one
[1:27:07] of you spend a few moments with you i
[1:27:09] i we don't mean to be isolationists but
[1:27:12] i hope you understand if we slip in and
[1:27:14] out brother brother ron has been
[1:27:17] instructed not to be exposed to too many
[1:27:19] people and things like that so we try to
[1:27:22] protect him as well
[1:27:24] amen but um you know sometimes
[1:27:27] we can't do enough
[1:27:29] and uh so we look to the lord of course
[1:27:32] amen matthew chapter 8 verse 23
[1:27:35] and when he was entered into his ship
[1:27:37] his disciples followed with him
[1:27:40] or followed him and
[1:27:41] behold there arose a great tempest in
[1:27:44] the sea and so much the ship
[1:27:47] was covered with waters but he was
[1:27:50] asleep
[1:27:51] and his disciples came to him and awoke
[1:27:53] him saying lord save us
[1:27:56] we perish
[1:27:58] and he said unto them why are you
[1:28:00] fearful and
[1:28:02] oh ye of little faith and then he arose
[1:28:05] and rebuked the winds and the sea and
[1:28:08] there was a great calm
[1:28:11] but the men marveled saying what manner
[1:28:14] of man is this
[1:28:16] that even the winds and the waves obey
[1:28:18] him
[1:28:19] and when he was come to the other side
[1:28:21] into the country of the gurgaoseans
[1:28:24] there he
[1:28:26] met him to
[1:28:27] possessed with the devil
[1:28:30] coming out of the tombs exceeding fears
[1:28:33] so that no man might pass by that way
[1:28:37] then if you'll turn with me to matthew
[1:28:39] chapter 14
[1:28:41] just a couple more chapters over verse
[1:28:43] 22
[1:28:45] and straightway
[1:28:47] jesus constrained his disciples to get
[1:28:50] into a ship
[1:28:52] to go before him unto the other side and
[1:28:56] while he sent the multitudes away and
[1:28:59] when he had sent the multitudes away he
[1:29:01] went up into a mountain apart to pray
[1:29:04] and when evening was come he was there
[1:29:06] alone
[1:29:08] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[1:29:10] sea tossed with waves for the wind was
[1:29:13] contrary
[1:29:14] and in the fourth watch of the night
[1:29:17] jesus went into them walking on the sea
[1:29:20] and when the disciples saw him walking
[1:29:23] on the sea they were troubled saying it
[1:29:25] is a spirit
[1:29:27] and they cried out for fear
[1:29:29] but straightway jesus spake unto them
[1:29:32] be of good cheer it is i
[1:29:35] be not
[1:29:36] afraid and peter answered him and said
[1:29:40] lord if thou
[1:29:42] if it be thou bid me come unto thee on
[1:29:46] the water
[1:29:47] and he said come and when peter was a
[1:29:50] come down out of the ship he walked on
[1:29:53] the water to go to jesus but when he saw
[1:29:56] the wind boisterous he was afraid and
[1:29:58] began to sink and he cried saying lord
[1:30:01] save me
[1:30:04] and immediately jesus stretched forth
[1:30:06] his hand and caught him and said unto
[1:30:08] him oh thou of little faith
[1:30:11] wherefore deadest thou doubt
[1:30:14] and when they were coming to the ship
[1:30:16] the wind ceased
[1:30:18] and then they that were in the ship came
[1:30:21] and worshiped him saying
[1:30:23] of a truth thou art the son of god
[1:30:27] amen may god bless you
[1:30:29] as you can have your seats
[1:30:34] today i want to speak again on
[1:30:37] is there hope of revival
[1:30:40] and brother branham of course you know
[1:30:43] proclaimed the end of the azusa street
[1:30:45] and the divine healing revival and in
[1:30:48] fact i was there as a young boy when he
[1:30:50] stood in like tabernacle and
[1:30:52] and preached on the invisible union of
[1:30:54] the bride of christ
[1:30:56] and there he directed his sermon to the
[1:30:59] church the body of christ and many of
[1:31:03] them um i watched to get up and exit the
[1:31:06] building and
[1:31:08] then they actually
[1:31:10] had some meetings there with the
[1:31:11] ministry
[1:31:12] and um they were not going to let
[1:31:14] brother branham finish the meetings and
[1:31:17] they missed him at the motel and would
[1:31:19] come back a little bit
[1:31:21] uh and let him let him come and speak
[1:31:23] the next service and it was more on
[1:31:25] faith and
[1:31:26] and the healing side and they decided to
[1:31:28] let him continue the meetings but they
[1:31:30] had a little talk with him
[1:31:32] about the old times and guess you're so
[1:31:34] busy with your message you don't have
[1:31:36] time for things like
[1:31:40] the lamb and the dove and
[1:31:42] brother branham would preach that great
[1:31:44] memorial sermon
[1:31:45] on the wings of a snow white dove
[1:31:48] i remember those that meeting i was
[1:31:51] i was just a 11 year old boy
[1:31:54] i'd ask for a suit that year for my
[1:31:56] birthday and a bible with my name on it
[1:31:58] because i was getting ready to preach
[1:32:00] already
[1:32:02] and you know i did start full-time
[1:32:05] ministry at 15 and
[1:32:07] i'd look and there was windows like this
[1:32:09] except they were a little higher
[1:32:11] and someone junior jackson or someone
[1:32:13] had a dream of angels coming down
[1:32:16] through that
[1:32:17] windows and and the meetings and brother
[1:32:19] branham told about
[1:32:21] the that and i sat there listening to
[1:32:24] brother branham and watching for those
[1:32:26] angels
[1:32:27] and um
[1:32:28] you know
[1:32:29] it it
[1:32:30] those things move my childish heart
[1:32:34] and um be quite honest with you when he
[1:32:36] broke out into that last verse said i've
[1:32:38] written a verse to that
[1:32:40] and though i've suffered in many way and
[1:32:42] i cried for healing
[1:32:44] both night and day but faith wasn't
[1:32:46] forgotten by the father above
[1:32:49] he sent down a sign on the wings of a
[1:32:51] dove and
[1:32:53] you know for me that just kind of topped
[1:32:55] it all off i said wow
[1:32:57] you know he can has these visions and
[1:33:00] discerns of hearts and turns his back to
[1:33:03] the congregation and calls them out and
[1:33:06] does uh you know there's been miracles
[1:33:08] and signs and wonders and
[1:33:11] he even writes songs
[1:33:14] so you see it was just a
[1:33:16] really a wow moment for me but those
[1:33:19] things impact your life forever
[1:33:22] and but he stood there in like
[1:33:24] tabernacle and and and he spoke he said
[1:33:27] um
[1:33:28] i
[1:33:29] direct my sermon to the church the body
[1:33:31] of christ
[1:33:32] that we're trying to lead
[1:33:34] to deeper thoughts and higher objectives
[1:33:37] believing that they come to the lord is
[1:33:39] at hand and we believe that much more is
[1:33:42] 20 years closer than it was the first
[1:33:45] time i come to shreveport and of course
[1:33:48] that would have been 1946 at the
[1:33:50] beginning of the
[1:33:51] of the revival
[1:33:53] and and
[1:33:54] shortly after the angel the lord came to
[1:33:57] him that he would visit shreveport and
[1:33:59] he said so much has happened since that
[1:34:02] time
[1:34:03] now we're looking forward for the coming
[1:34:05] of the lord in our generation i'm not
[1:34:07] looking for revival in our generation
[1:34:10] i'm looking for the coming of the lord
[1:34:13] in our generation
[1:34:15] so he was not looking for another
[1:34:18] worldwide revival or another repeat of
[1:34:21] azusa or he wasn't looking for another
[1:34:24] uh divine healing movement
[1:34:27] where that there would be thousands go
[1:34:30] out then inspired by him and
[1:34:33] and uh another billy graham rise on the
[1:34:36] scene and thousands follow him with
[1:34:39] and and pattern after his ministry and
[1:34:42] others copy after brother branham and he
[1:34:44] was not looking for that he was
[1:34:46] expecting the coming of the lord
[1:34:48] and i believe that we are in the coming
[1:34:51] of the lord
[1:34:53] amen i believe that the word came to a
[1:34:55] prophet that was the coming of the lord
[1:34:58] to the a prophet not a physical coming
[1:35:00] but the word coming
[1:35:02] and i believe that that same word had to
[1:35:05] become flesh
[1:35:06] in a people
[1:35:08] that they after they ate the book they
[1:35:10] could prophesy again
[1:35:12] so i believe the lord has come and that
[1:35:14] he is his now has appeared among us in
[1:35:17] bright form
[1:35:19] and it's the same god he just changed in
[1:35:21] his mask all the time
[1:35:23] now so as we're looking at this this
[1:35:26] morning but we we're we want to speak on
[1:35:29] the subject of revival and brother
[1:35:32] branham would tell them in albuquerque
[1:35:35] in 63 right after the seals he said now
[1:35:37] you hear me then if you believe me to be
[1:35:39] a messenger sent from christ to you you
[1:35:42] believe me if if not if you're not in
[1:35:45] the kingdom of god you better press
[1:35:47] right quick
[1:35:48] it will not get better it will grow
[1:35:50] worse
[1:35:51] all the time just mark that down
[1:35:54] remember and see whether it's right or
[1:35:57] wrong you you you see if it's going to
[1:35:59] be right or wrong it's it's not going to
[1:36:01] get better it's going to get worse it's
[1:36:04] going to get harder all the time
[1:36:07] the revival is gone you're only gleaning
[1:36:09] in the field she is over and now you say
[1:36:13] i disagree with that fine it's okay if
[1:36:15] you do that's all right but that's my
[1:36:17] conviction and that's my hearing from
[1:36:20] heaven
[1:36:21] i believe the laodicean age is the
[1:36:23] pentecostal age where she comes to that
[1:36:25] place of lukewarm and god spews her from
[1:36:28] his mouth and there's where she's come
[1:36:31] right now the pentecostal movement has
[1:36:33] come to that place
[1:36:35] lukewarm not red-hot not ice cold
[1:36:38] you are not
[1:36:40] cold and you're you're not cold and
[1:36:42] formal neither are you hot you're in the
[1:36:44] spewing stage and you're going
[1:36:48] and and now of course we can all say
[1:36:51] yeah that's right i mean that's all true
[1:36:53] about the denominational system but
[1:36:56] sadly message churches
[1:36:58] are not immune to this
[1:37:01] people can get so hard and and not
[1:37:04] tender and sensitive to the spirit of
[1:37:06] god and they're lukewarm about it
[1:37:10] and brother branham even spoke of this
[1:37:12] in his own church but just before he
[1:37:14] parted in in july of 65 he said i told
[1:37:19] my wife to brother woods when i got here
[1:37:21] and some friends i met i've had about
[1:37:23] five years of hardly know what to do see
[1:37:25] the revival itself among the churches
[1:37:28] has died
[1:37:30] everyone knows that you feel it in this
[1:37:32] tabernacle so it wasn't something that
[1:37:35] was just affecting
[1:37:37] the denomination it's affecting the
[1:37:39] whole world
[1:37:40] and in every aspect he said you feel it
[1:37:43] everywhere there's a thump a dead
[1:37:46] feeling there just something isn't right
[1:37:48] it's because the revival enthusiasm has
[1:37:51] gone away from the people
[1:37:53] going to the churches you see them
[1:37:55] sitting there and the pastor is
[1:37:56] stumbling around for a message or
[1:37:59] something another and first thing you
[1:38:01] know he's turned it off to some kind of
[1:38:03] party they're going to have or something
[1:38:05] it seems to be a dead trump everywhere
[1:38:09] so you know again because of this many
[1:38:12] times the ministry as he said stumbling
[1:38:15] around for a message you know because of
[1:38:18] the lack of this of of the spirit men
[1:38:22] actually have turned
[1:38:24] to psychology
[1:38:26] to put band-aids on sin problems
[1:38:32] amen i mean we we've actually went
[1:38:34] through a whole cycle and it's still
[1:38:36] happening in many places where
[1:38:38] psychology is what is being offered and
[1:38:41] and extolled and
[1:38:43] and said that was necessary and books on
[1:38:46] dr dobson or these other christian
[1:38:49] psychologists they call them you know
[1:38:51] they are passed around because we got
[1:38:53] trouble in our churches
[1:38:55] we got problems here in the family and
[1:38:58] we got to figure a way ways to fix the
[1:39:00] problem well i'll tell you a good dose
[1:39:03] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:39:06] we'll fix about 99 of your marriage
[1:39:09] problems
[1:39:10] it'll fix your teenage rebellion
[1:39:13] it'll it'll fix the sin problem
[1:39:15] everywhere just get a good dose of the
[1:39:17] holy ghost
[1:39:19] but you see he said the church spirit
[1:39:21] sits spiritually dead gone the hour is
[1:39:24] past them they're in a slump hardly know
[1:39:27] what to do one running this way and one
[1:39:29] running that way
[1:39:31] and and here every promise that god made
[1:39:35] in the bible every one of them is laying
[1:39:38] there just as good as they ever was
[1:39:41] it's the hour he said what makes a
[1:39:43] church like this we're in the age of
[1:39:45] laodicea when she has to come this way
[1:39:49] but praise god i read in the in that
[1:39:52] same chapter there about the lukewarm
[1:39:54] spirit and it says to him that overcomes
[1:39:59] well he couldn't say to him that
[1:40:01] overcometh unless there's somebody going
[1:40:03] to overcome
[1:40:03] [Applause]
[1:40:06] amen
[1:40:07] now so again god likes to show his power
[1:40:11] he likes to do that it pleases him to
[1:40:13] show his omnipotence to let his subjects
[1:40:16] know who he is
[1:40:19] amen and what does that do it it
[1:40:21] prepares their hearts it makes them
[1:40:24] ready it makes them brace up and take a
[1:40:27] new hold
[1:40:29] and he said to people who don't believe
[1:40:30] in divine healing and performing in
[1:40:32] miracles i wonder i know wonder our
[1:40:35] churches are
[1:40:36] dying no wonder they're withered up to
[1:40:39] bloodless cults
[1:40:41] and it's sad today you know many that
[1:40:43] are calling herself or i have identified
[1:40:45] to them as a as a message of people
[1:40:49] they're they're just nothing more than a
[1:40:51] cult
[1:40:53] if you don't belong to them you can't
[1:40:55] fellowship you can't enter you can't
[1:40:59] there's all kinds of awful things that
[1:41:02] are happening in the midst
[1:41:04] and i mean marriages and divorces and
[1:41:07] remarriages and and fixed marriages and
[1:41:10] every kind of problem that you can
[1:41:13] you can imagine
[1:41:15] and many times you know the message is
[1:41:17] no longer being even preached
[1:41:20] but you see god is a great phenomenal
[1:41:23] he's a creator he and he is jehovah he's
[1:41:26] the great reality
[1:41:28] he's a great substance of everything
[1:41:31] that was made on the earth everything
[1:41:33] was made by him
[1:41:35] he'll display his power by the sun
[1:41:37] rising every morning by sending forth
[1:41:40] his reign
[1:41:41] and by setting his rainbows in the sky
[1:41:44] and he comes down to his subjects and he
[1:41:47] heals our sickness
[1:41:49] saves us from our sins
[1:41:51] god likes to display the phenomenal
[1:41:55] and speaking of the other church early
[1:41:57] church brother branham said notice if
[1:41:58] it's a church that when they obeyed what
[1:42:01] god said originally and it is the word
[1:42:04] of god look at the miracles and the
[1:42:06] signs and so forth they had and they and
[1:42:09] you don't have them at all today it's an
[1:42:12] evidence that god is not with you
[1:42:15] and and so signs will follow them that
[1:42:18] believe
[1:42:19] amen because he said that they will be
[1:42:22] casting out devils
[1:42:24] they will believe in healing they will
[1:42:25] be speaking with new tongues
[1:42:27] they will believe all the supernatural
[1:42:29] works of god the resurrected jesus
[1:42:32] working among them
[1:42:34] amen to try to take that away you will
[1:42:37] be cursed
[1:42:39] amen and what the you know and so
[1:42:41] brother brandon said that's just the way
[1:42:42] it is you try to add to it you try to
[1:42:44] take from it you'll be cursed try to
[1:42:46] take that out of the church you're a
[1:42:48] cursed people
[1:42:50] amen he said was the pentecostal church
[1:42:52] and noisy church back in the beginning
[1:42:54] when the holy ghost first fell the
[1:42:57] virgin mary like she was drunk
[1:42:58] staggering under the power of god and
[1:43:01] all of them like that and people said
[1:43:03] they're full of new wine that's the way
[1:43:05] the church was ordained
[1:43:07] that's the way every church is ordained
[1:43:10] every time god has a church he'll have
[1:43:12] that kind of church
[1:43:17] you know
[1:43:18] it even got taught among us you know
[1:43:21] actually it actually got taught among us
[1:43:22] said oh we get the holy ghost like mary
[1:43:25] did you know um you know when mary
[1:43:28] when mary got it she got it without
[1:43:30] sensation
[1:43:32] and and and she conceived there and it
[1:43:36] was of the holy ghost that was not when
[1:43:38] she got the holy ghost
[1:43:39] that's when she got pregnant
[1:43:42] [Applause]
[1:43:43] when she got the holy ghost she was in
[1:43:45] the upper room
[1:43:47] she staggered like a drunk woman
[1:43:50] she spoke in other tongues like the rest
[1:43:52] of them
[1:43:53] amen and brother adam said if you don't
[1:43:55] get the holy ghost like mary did he said
[1:43:57] you're not going to enter in he said if
[1:43:59] god wouldn't let her into heaven without
[1:44:01] that kind of pentecostal experience he's
[1:44:04] not going to let you into heaven
[1:44:06] [Applause]
[1:44:10] so that's a lie
[1:44:11] that's not how we receive the holy ghost
[1:44:13] not not even a teaching of the message
[1:44:16] that was a teaching of a backslidden
[1:44:18] preacher
[1:44:21] now
[1:44:22] you see
[1:44:23] in the second hand ruby said they say
[1:44:25] divine healing can't work the days of
[1:44:27] miracles has passed he says if the days
[1:44:30] and miracles has passed the days of god
[1:44:33] is past
[1:44:34] the church that don't believe in the
[1:44:36] supernatural will finally die and god
[1:44:39] will leave that church
[1:44:42] so again we we ask is there possibility
[1:44:46] is there any possibility that there
[1:44:49] could be somebody on fire for god in
[1:44:52] this last day
[1:44:53] is there a possibility
[1:44:56] that someone would be
[1:45:00] hot i'm not worried about the coldness
[1:45:03] my goodness the whole world is is either
[1:45:06] lukewarm or cold
[1:45:08] but is there going to be somebody hot
[1:45:11] is there going to be somebody fervent is
[1:45:13] there somebody going to be full of the
[1:45:15] power of god
[1:45:17] is there hope
[1:45:20] for revival
[1:45:23] that's my question today
[1:45:25] [Music]
[1:45:26] brother branham said it seems like a
[1:45:28] drying out of the churches
[1:45:31] and i hardly can find a church anywhere
[1:45:34] that's alive with the word and with the
[1:45:37] spirit of god and great things taking
[1:45:39] place like it was not long ago
[1:45:41] god of this evil age listen to this this
[1:45:44] is august just before he leaves us he
[1:45:47] says now she's
[1:45:48] she has caused the whole world except
[1:45:51] the scientific leadership of the
[1:45:53] educational program that satan has given
[1:45:56] to her
[1:45:57] under the name of a church the
[1:45:59] leadership of an educational scientific
[1:46:02] program i'm preaching to you the god of
[1:46:05] this world
[1:46:06] when she has eve had the very feeling of
[1:46:09] god's word in her hand she could have
[1:46:12] taken god's word but what should she do
[1:46:15] to that instead of carrying for the
[1:46:18] baptism of the holy ghost let science
[1:46:21] prove to her that the holy ghost was
[1:46:23] only for the disciples
[1:46:25] and instead of keeping divine healing
[1:46:28] going when she ought to be now
[1:46:31] raising the dead
[1:46:33] and doing great miracles she has let
[1:46:36] satan under his leadership of religious
[1:46:39] man take the word of god and try to say
[1:46:42] it was for another age
[1:46:46] now you see that's the condition
[1:46:49] and that's what brother branham said
[1:46:51] instead of keeping it going
[1:46:54] you see we were never to let the holy
[1:46:57] spirit die out in our church and the
[1:47:00] phenomenon to quit
[1:47:05] amen there ought to be a holy power
[1:47:08] surrounding the church that makes demons
[1:47:11] flee
[1:47:14] where sin is uncomfortable in our midst
[1:47:18] where is called out and exposed
[1:47:21] it can't be hidden anymore and there's
[1:47:23] an anonymized sapphire
[1:47:28] but brother adam said instead of that we
[1:47:30] become a laughingstock he said what is
[1:47:32] it mechanics
[1:47:34] instead of dynamics
[1:47:37] i'm quoting him
[1:47:39] he said then they have the nerve to say
[1:47:41] wonder what happened the god of the
[1:47:42] bible
[1:47:44] where is that god he said well you
[1:47:46] choked him out by your creeds
[1:47:50] creates this doctrinal statement so you
[1:47:52] know i believe that's what creed means i
[1:47:54] believe this is what we believe
[1:47:57] and and so creeds in one sense created
[1:48:00] the creeds are wrong we all have creeds
[1:48:02] no creed but christ no book but the
[1:48:04] bible
[1:48:06] so you see christ should be our creed
[1:48:08] what we believe
[1:48:09] amen but he said you try to place him
[1:48:11] back in history
[1:48:13] and this is happened we sometimes point
[1:48:15] way back what god used to do
[1:48:20] how he worked and threw a prophet and
[1:48:22] how he vindicated the message
[1:48:24] and said we we don't need vindication
[1:48:27] anymore well the new testament church
[1:48:29] needed vindication
[1:48:31] these signs have followed them that
[1:48:33] believe and the lord went with them
[1:48:36] working signs and wonders among them
[1:48:39] and this was the proof that the lord was
[1:48:41] with them
[1:48:43] silver and gold have thy none they knew
[1:48:45] they had been with jesus
[1:48:47] you see they had vindication
[1:48:50] well the message don't need vindication
[1:48:52] no but you as a believer needs
[1:48:54] vindication
[1:48:57] god has vindicated and proved the
[1:48:59] message but you see he must show himself
[1:49:02] alive
[1:49:03] with us over and over and over again
[1:49:10] well i don't need a miracle i do
[1:49:15] well i'll tell you we we don't need
[1:49:17] healing we we we got doctors no we need
[1:49:20] divine healing
[1:49:24] amen now he's still god the god of
[1:49:27] history but he's waiting for somebody to
[1:49:29] call him up out of history
[1:49:32] god remains the same he's forever god
[1:49:35] and so he says and when we begin to find
[1:49:38] out miracles isn't taking place no more
[1:49:41] like they were
[1:49:42] the sick go home sick
[1:49:45] it isn't because of god it's because of
[1:49:48] the lack of revival among the people
[1:49:51] there's no revival they just sit and
[1:49:53] listen and go home and say well i guess
[1:49:56] that was pretty good and
[1:49:58] see there's not that zeal
[1:50:01] there's not that something in the people
[1:50:03] that should be there
[1:50:07] now brother branham often talked about
[1:50:09] two classes of people he said if i could
[1:50:11] just get these two together
[1:50:14] and he said one is fundamental you know
[1:50:16] and he said the other of course he said
[1:50:19] where the pentecostal in other words he
[1:50:21] said if i could just get them together
[1:50:24] he said in my travel once a fundamental
[1:50:27] they know by the mechanics positionally
[1:50:29] they know by the mechanics they are to
[1:50:32] be sons and daughters of god
[1:50:36] you know i spoke to a man that was so
[1:50:38] mechanically sure
[1:50:40] of his salvation as a baptist man he sat
[1:50:43] there with me and was talking to me
[1:50:45] about a situation
[1:50:47] that he was contemplating and he said
[1:50:49] now i'm not here to talk about my
[1:50:51] salvation i am saved i know i'm going to
[1:50:54] heaven i know without a doubt i'm going
[1:50:58] to be there i'm secure
[1:51:00] you know i've accepted jesus as my
[1:51:02] savior and i know beyond a shadow doubt
[1:51:06] i'll be in that rapture as he sucked his
[1:51:08] cigarette lit another one off of that
[1:51:10] one and sucked another
[1:51:12] and then he was contemplating marrying
[1:51:14] for the third time and then he then he
[1:51:17] had just been arrested for drunk driving
[1:51:22] just two weeks before and spent a few
[1:51:23] nights in jail
[1:51:26] but he was so sure
[1:51:28] he had the mechanics so down
[1:51:32] of the positioning i'm a son of god
[1:51:36] but he had no dynamics
[1:51:39] he had no life to go with it
[1:51:42] amen and he said that the next i
[1:51:44] financed the pentecostals day they were
[1:51:47] the baptism of the holy spirit not many
[1:51:49] times this baptism was just
[1:51:51] was rarely on the soul just from the
[1:51:53] flesh of screaming and shouting and
[1:51:55] worked up emotion
[1:51:58] now
[1:52:00] we know
[1:52:01] that everywhere jesus is there's noise
[1:52:05] but there can be noise and jesus ain't
[1:52:08] nowhere
[1:52:10] [Music]
[1:52:12] so it ain't just noise that we're trying
[1:52:14] to get
[1:52:17] revival isn't just noise
[1:52:21] i want to get some thoughts to you we
[1:52:23] get noise confused with the anointing
[1:52:26] noise ain't the anointing and brother
[1:52:28] brandon said i've seen a lot of noise
[1:52:30] and not enough faith to cure a toothache
[1:52:34] you you know you've got to come solemnly
[1:52:36] to the father you know with with with
[1:52:38] assurance you know who you are
[1:52:41] but he said i've seen people shout and
[1:52:43] praise the lord not enough faith to heal
[1:52:45] a toothache
[1:52:46] and actually actually we've had a
[1:52:49] fraction of the message that have
[1:52:50] trained their their congregation to give
[1:52:52] a response of running down to the
[1:52:55] platform standing there shouting and
[1:52:57] screaming to the preaching
[1:53:00] noise that has been sometimes confused
[1:53:03] even for the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:53:06] you know
[1:53:08] and much of it is no different from the
[1:53:09] priest of baal who elijah mocked as they
[1:53:13] tried to scream down the power of their
[1:53:15] god
[1:53:17] but you see the evidence of the token is
[1:53:20] not noise
[1:53:22] it is a surrendered life to god
[1:53:28] so he said brother the whole old floor
[1:53:31] was dancing the spirit and he said not
[1:53:33] enough faith to heal the truth you call
[1:53:35] that power that's not power that's
[1:53:37] blessings
[1:53:38] and there's a lot of difference between
[1:53:40] blessings and power
[1:53:43] amen god baits his blessings on the
[1:53:46] righteous and the unrighteous
[1:53:48] amen but he said we need to get back to
[1:53:50] the truth
[1:53:51] but i'm just going to say on the other
[1:53:53] hand just theology don't work either
[1:53:58] come on just drop theology don't do it
[1:54:01] either
[1:54:02] we've seen people so pumped with
[1:54:04] theology they ain't enough faith to heal
[1:54:06] a toothache
[1:54:07] [Applause]
[1:54:09] paul saw it coming he wander he warned
[1:54:12] about a subtle priesthood that would
[1:54:14] come and take over with false doctrines
[1:54:17] and he knew they would implement a way
[1:54:19] of worship that excluded the people from
[1:54:21] any part of the holy spirit ministry and
[1:54:23] he said and even right today among those
[1:54:25] who claim to be free and full of the
[1:54:28] spirit there's not too much freedom in
[1:54:29] the laity and the best we can see is a
[1:54:32] few preachers with inspired preaching
[1:54:34] while the flock just sits there and
[1:54:36] tries to absorb it
[1:54:38] this is a far cry from paul who said
[1:54:41] when all came together all had the
[1:54:43] leading of the spirit and all
[1:54:45] participated in spiritual worship
[1:54:48] so we have we have two groups of
[1:54:50] fundamentals oh my word word word and
[1:54:54] and then the pentecostals spirit spirit
[1:54:57] spirit
[1:54:58] and of course you know there has to be a
[1:55:02] third one more group
[1:55:05] that has it all together
[1:55:08] [Applause]
[1:55:10] brother branham long to see it
[1:55:13] if i could just get these two together
[1:55:17] that's what his message was to produce
[1:55:22] fundamentals they know positioning where
[1:55:24] they're at but they don't have any faith
[1:55:26] pentecostals got a lot of faith and
[1:55:27] don't know who they are he says like one
[1:55:29] having money in the bank the other and
[1:55:31] don't know how to write a check and the
[1:55:33] other knows how to write a check but he
[1:55:34] has no money in the bank if we could get
[1:55:36] them together
[1:55:40] amen i believe god's going to have it
[1:55:42] together
[1:55:44] he said his bride would be without spot
[1:55:46] or wrinkle
[1:55:48] amen and he said to pentecost if they
[1:55:50] could take that stream and know how to
[1:55:52] direct it fundamentally in the word the
[1:55:54] big regime of god would start moving on
[1:55:57] and he said that's where satan's got in
[1:56:00] to make it all mechanics
[1:56:02] and no dynamics
[1:56:05] or all dynamics and no mechanics
[1:56:08] we've got to put it together we've got
[1:56:11] to have the power of the holy spirit but
[1:56:13] we've got to come back with the word to
[1:56:15] feed this machine
[1:56:17] we can't feed it on creed it won't burn
[1:56:19] it it chokes up the flues it will not
[1:56:21] burn it it was made for the word of god
[1:56:25] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:56:27] every word not as part of it
[1:56:31] so brother branham accessed the
[1:56:33] condition of the day
[1:56:35] and he spoke of it like two cars
[1:56:38] one mechanically fine and that it had
[1:56:41] all the looks and the shine
[1:56:44] you know it had all of the
[1:56:46] beautiful plush seats and doe skin and
[1:56:50] and
[1:56:51] diamond studded steering wheel and
[1:56:52] polished hubs and
[1:56:54] and he says what good does it do he
[1:56:56] called it give it a simonized job you
[1:56:59] know that's a polishing job
[1:57:01] and he said what good does it do to
[1:57:02] polish it all up
[1:57:04] it don't run
[1:57:08] and that's what happens a lot of times
[1:57:10] is our religious ways have just become
[1:57:14] polished up
[1:57:17] but it don't run
[1:57:19] as i said yesterday it won't run down to
[1:57:21] divine healing
[1:57:23] it won't run to the power of god it
[1:57:25] won't drive down
[1:57:27] to miracles
[1:57:29] it won't it won't drive down to holy
[1:57:32] lives
[1:57:34] it sits right there and it won't go
[1:57:37] anywhere
[1:57:38] it looks like a church but it isn't with
[1:57:41] the power of god in it
[1:57:43] now and he said that he said until the
[1:57:46] church becomes both dynamics and
[1:57:48] mechanics
[1:57:50] and the spirit of god that moved him to
[1:57:52] do the same things he did if he did on
[1:57:54] 16 cylinders so will the bride
[1:57:57] for he said in john 14 12 he that
[1:58:00] believeth on me the works that i do
[1:58:02] shall he do also i'll give him a charge
[1:58:06] of my dynamics in his mechanics that the
[1:58:09] world will not be able to withstand it
[1:58:12] and i'll raise him up again in the last
[1:58:14] day
[1:58:16] that's the easter message the dynamics
[1:58:19] and the mechanics together
[1:58:21] the mechanics without dynamics no good
[1:58:24] and neither is dynamics without the
[1:58:26] mechanics he said you can scream and
[1:58:28] shout and jump up and down all you want
[1:58:30] to and deny this word it won't do any
[1:58:33] good you're just cranking around on the
[1:58:36] on the pistons
[1:58:37] you know god got the
[1:58:39] you got to have the spark there to fire
[1:58:42] you got the spark there to fire but no
[1:58:43] gasoline to fire it by
[1:58:45] it'll only work when it comes together
[1:58:49] amen one will sit still he said and the
[1:58:51] other will go up i don't know about you
[1:58:54] but i don't want to be left here sitting
[1:58:56] still
[1:58:57] i want to go up i want to be a part of
[1:58:59] that rapture
[1:59:01] the car that the brother branham left
[1:59:03] running it'll drive to the rapture
[1:59:06] [Applause]
[1:59:08] but it'll only work if the two come
[1:59:10] together
[1:59:12] amen and of course he says it won't move
[1:59:15] no matter how good the mechanics is
[1:59:17] until the dynamics come and when the
[1:59:19] dynamics come that fire that's made to
[1:59:21] connect with that octane in the gasoline
[1:59:24] when that explodes it causes a
[1:59:26] combustion
[1:59:28] [Applause]
[1:59:29] hallelujah i want to say there's power
[1:59:32] in the word there's power in the message
[1:59:35] it's full of not just 98 of octane it's
[1:59:39] full of the power of god
[1:59:42] hallelujah there's liftoff power in it
[1:59:45] there's rapture and faith in it
[1:59:48] are you with me it all leaves right
[1:59:50] there in the word but it takes the holy
[1:59:53] spirit dynamics to make that word live
[2:00:01] so there are two drops of brother
[2:00:03] bradham in her will back and forth
[2:00:06] there again at the end of his ministry
[2:00:09] he would preach a lot on you know about
[2:00:11] waking up samson
[2:00:13] we spoke about that yesterday
[2:00:16] and there are to now our day before now
[2:00:19] but they're they're true thoughts that
[2:00:20] brother branham enter whoa back and
[2:00:22] forth
[2:00:23] and one thought was contained in the
[2:00:25] testimony on the sea
[2:00:27] go awake jesus
[2:00:30] and the others dealt with where the
[2:00:32] disciples
[2:00:33] um were
[2:00:35] in in that he dealt with the disciples
[2:00:38] had jesus in the boat
[2:00:41] jesus was asleep in their boat and they
[2:00:43] were testifying
[2:00:45] of
[2:00:46] all the great things that god had done
[2:00:50] and the other one be not afraid he was
[2:00:52] telling us there's some
[2:00:54] that has actually went without jesus
[2:01:00] so you wind up with two
[2:01:02] fractions
[2:01:03] one has jesus
[2:01:05] but he's asleep
[2:01:10] the other has went off without him
[2:01:15] they started the journey and didn't take
[2:01:17] jesus with them
[2:01:21] and so now they get along life's journey
[2:01:23] and what happened they get in the storms
[2:01:27] because you're going to get in the
[2:01:28] storms whether jesus with you or not
[2:01:31] you're going to have storms in your life
[2:01:35] are you with me
[2:01:36] now so their true thoughts go await
[2:01:38] jesus and be not afraid and they
[2:01:41] revealed two conditions of the end-time
[2:01:44] people
[2:01:47] a person or a church who has jesus in
[2:01:49] their boat but just needs to arouse him
[2:01:53] niece arousing the only thing that will
[2:01:55] arouse him is your faith
[2:01:59] amen or a person or church who has gone
[2:02:02] off without jesus and he's the very
[2:02:04] thing they need
[2:02:06] but they're afraid of it
[2:02:09] so some have him
[2:02:11] but he needs to be awakened
[2:02:14] and some
[2:02:15] don't
[2:02:16] don't have him at all and they're afraid
[2:02:18] of it
[2:02:20] you see they're afraid to speak with
[2:02:22] tongues
[2:02:26] believers shouldn't be afraid of that
[2:02:29] in my name they'll cast out devils they
[2:02:31] shall
[2:02:32] speak with new tongues
[2:02:35] is that right
[2:02:36] then they're afraid of the anointing
[2:02:38] because it might be
[2:02:39] an anointed one says end time
[2:02:42] well you better be
[2:02:44] well i don't want to be on the one of
[2:02:46] them anointed once at the end time you
[2:02:48] better be
[2:02:50] the anointing was never sent for the
[2:02:52] terror
[2:02:54] the rain did not come for the weeds
[2:02:57] the rain came from the for the wheat
[2:03:00] [Applause]
[2:03:04] it just happened to fall on the just and
[2:03:06] the unjust it wasn't sent for them it
[2:03:08] was sent for you
[2:03:11] we the bride must be the anointed one of
[2:03:16] the day
[2:03:19] in fact that's why the mighty angel came
[2:03:23] that was not a physical return of christ
[2:03:25] that was an anointing coming down
[2:03:28] and that anointing would open the seals
[2:03:30] it would reveal the mysteries and once
[2:03:32] you ate it oh hallelujah it would cause
[2:03:35] something to burst on the inside of you
[2:03:38] until you also gave witness
[2:03:45] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:03:48] so you better be the anointed ones at
[2:03:50] the end time
[2:03:53] amen it's
[2:03:54] that anointing that rain that is sent to
[2:03:57] mature the wheat to make them rejoice
[2:04:01] brother branham preached another sermon
[2:04:03] just before he left and it was called
[2:04:05] ashamed of him
[2:04:08] and he warned us about being ashamed
[2:04:12] of christ
[2:04:13] because there's a whole age that is
[2:04:16] rejecting him
[2:04:18] and he said when it comes to accepting
[2:04:20] the fatherhood of the word of god christ
[2:04:23] no they're embarrassed they don't want
[2:04:24] to say yes i have spoke with tongues
[2:04:28] yes i had seen visions
[2:04:30] yes i believe in divine healing yes i
[2:04:34] praise the lord
[2:04:36] [Applause]
[2:04:39] amen you know you know some get
[2:04:41] embarrassed because brother ron said i
[2:04:42] saw a vision only brother branham could
[2:04:44] do that you're god's in the past
[2:04:51] come on joel 2 said in the last day i'll
[2:04:53] pour out my spirit on sons and daughters
[2:04:56] old men will dream dreams and young men
[2:04:59] will see visions
[2:05:03] and i'll pour it up on handmaids and
[2:05:05] daughters upon all flesh
[2:05:09] and if you see them out there doing it
[2:05:11] what are the bread of christ
[2:05:16] if they can rejoice over their anointing
[2:05:18] what about us who's anointed with the
[2:05:21] mighty angel
[2:05:22] [Applause]
[2:05:30] and ashamed of him he said but let me
[2:05:32] say this a man who has once come in
[2:05:35] contact with god which is the word and
[2:05:37] the word has been plain and manifested
[2:05:40] to him there's no shameness about that
[2:05:42] you are not embarrassed
[2:05:45] it doesn't embarrass me to say i believe
[2:05:47] every word of god
[2:05:49] it doesn't embarrass me when the lord
[2:05:51] says to do anything you go and say and
[2:05:53] do it it don't embarrass me to say i've
[2:05:56] been filled with the holy ghost it don't
[2:05:58] embarrass me to say i've spoke with
[2:06:00] other tongues it doesn't embarrass me to
[2:06:02] say that our lord showed me vision it
[2:06:05] don't embarrass me to say he's the same
[2:06:07] yesterday
[2:06:08] today and forever
[2:06:13] [Applause]
[2:06:16] now the disciples
[2:06:19] they got out on this ship
[2:06:21] and jesus went to sleep
[2:06:24] the divine healing revival had just kind
[2:06:27] of went over they'd had great revivals
[2:06:29] and
[2:06:30] miracles and
[2:06:32] you know those testimonies in india
[2:06:35] those testimonies of blind men in africa
[2:06:39] or
[2:06:40] the blind man in mexico
[2:06:42] the dead baby that came to life or the
[2:06:45] little crippled upper character you know
[2:06:48] that was there with with a chain around
[2:06:50] his neck
[2:06:52] and seemed straightened up and bones
[2:06:54] cracking becoming a wrecked man and
[2:06:57] healed
[2:07:01] amen great revivals they had seen
[2:07:03] marvelous things
[2:07:05] when they got out there on the sea
[2:07:09] and they got out there kind of resting
[2:07:11] relaxing and
[2:07:13] in their
[2:07:14] relaxing time
[2:07:17] jesus went to sleep
[2:07:26] and they were resting between revivals
[2:07:27] brother them why are you preaching this
[2:07:31] because the resting between revivals
[2:07:34] cannot go on forever
[2:07:39] it's time we start stressing the
[2:07:41] dynamics
[2:07:44] and that's why i am announcing the rest
[2:07:47] between revivals is over
[2:07:50] [Music]
[2:07:52] amen the pride is starting to realize
[2:07:54] they are the revival
[2:07:59] we've had a good time of coasting along
[2:08:02] and going over the mysteries and talking
[2:08:04] about the seals and and looking at all
[2:08:07] the mechanics and tinkering with this
[2:08:09] and t and some of tinker waited till
[2:08:10] they wanted to run no more
[2:08:16] they pulled out the plugs and set them
[2:08:17] at a different gap and made two lords
[2:08:19] out of them and
[2:08:21] and it just sputters and won't go and
[2:08:23] it won't get out of the driveway
[2:08:29] and sometimes well we'll just wait for
[2:08:31] brother branham to come back when he
[2:08:32] comes back he'll fix it
[2:08:36] it's going to be too late when brother
[2:08:37] branham comes back
[2:08:40] you're going to have to have the
[2:08:41] dynamics to be changed
[2:08:44] come on
[2:08:45] you're going to have to have the holy
[2:08:46] ghost moving in your life
[2:08:50] or you're going to miss it
[2:08:52] so the rest between revivals is over
[2:08:55] we've had 60 years of that
[2:08:57] [Applause]
[2:08:58] it's going home time
[2:09:01] it's rapture time
[2:09:07] we've started out on a journey with a
[2:09:09] great divine healing revival that
[2:09:11] crescendoed and think about it he kept
[2:09:14] crescendoing and crescendoing and it
[2:09:17] reached an apex until you know the
[2:09:19] revelations of god went from just
[2:09:22] discerning the thoughts and intense
[2:09:23] heart to revealing the word
[2:09:26] are you with me
[2:09:27] amen that same god that could go back 40
[2:09:30] years in a person's life could go back
[2:09:32] and show you where in the mind of god
[2:09:34] before the foundation of the world
[2:09:38] is that right
[2:09:39] i mean this was more important that word
[2:09:41] where your problem began it could go
[2:09:43] back to genesis and see the fall
[2:09:47] this was more important than finding out
[2:09:50] 40 years ago you were scared by a dog
[2:09:52] this is where the church got off
[2:09:54] and sin entered in
[2:09:56] right back out here in genesis in the
[2:09:58] beginning and thrilled that beast all
[2:10:00] the way to the end
[2:10:03] to where the devil has been totally
[2:10:05] exposed
[2:10:06] [Applause]
[2:10:08] the man of sin has been
[2:10:12] exposed the mystery of iniquity that
[2:10:16] worked back in paul's day now we see it
[2:10:19] clearly
[2:10:21] now
[2:10:23] amen it crescendoed
[2:10:26] into the book being opened by the lamb
[2:10:29] and the seals being opened
[2:10:33] to where we are standing here today
[2:10:36] in the in the very coming of the lord
[2:10:39] that seventh seal being opened that had
[2:10:41] broken the silence
[2:10:45] what god held secret to other ages has
[2:10:47] now been made known
[2:10:49] is not silenced anymore it's been
[2:10:52] revealed
[2:10:54] you are privy to things that other
[2:10:56] agents didn't get to know
[2:10:58] if satan would have got a hold of it
[2:11:00] that there would be seven ages and seven
[2:11:03] messengers in 2000 years he'd have done
[2:11:05] great damage with that so god hid all of
[2:11:08] that until the last day
[2:11:10] [Applause]
[2:11:13] you see we've been on a journey and it's
[2:11:15] kind of like this you know uh we we've
[2:11:17] been on a journey and you got to know
[2:11:19] where you're at
[2:11:22] and god wanted you to know where you're
[2:11:23] at
[2:11:24] [Applause]
[2:11:26] he wanted you to know you're the last
[2:11:28] stage there's not another age coming
[2:11:30] this is the last message and if you miss
[2:11:32] it you're going to miss it
[2:11:35] don't miss this junction
[2:11:37] [Applause]
[2:11:38] amen so you know it's kind of like one
[2:11:40] day i went on a journey i had a friend a
[2:11:42] brother in the church you know he was
[2:11:44] from florida and made many trips down
[2:11:47] there his dad passed away and they
[2:11:48] wanted me to do the memorial service so
[2:11:50] i got in my car and i took him with me
[2:11:52] and his sister and and down to florida
[2:11:55] we go
[2:11:56] before i leave on the journey i just
[2:11:58] happen to remember i forgot my map i
[2:12:00] said and that was days you know no gps
[2:12:03] in
[2:12:04] and so i forgot my map
[2:12:06] and so
[2:12:08] i said wait wait wait wait i said i
[2:12:09] can't go nowhere till i get my map
[2:12:12] and and he said to me ah you don't need
[2:12:14] that old map
[2:12:15] he said i know the way like the back of
[2:12:18] my hand i have been to florida so many
[2:12:21] times
[2:12:22] i can tell you exactly every time i said
[2:12:24] you know how to get to florida i don't
[2:12:26] know how to get to florida you don't
[2:12:28] need a map but i need a map buddy so i
[2:12:31] went back in and i got my map and i
[2:12:34] looked and i charted out my journey okay
[2:12:36] you make this turn this turn this turn
[2:12:37] and and i kind of got it down in my mind
[2:12:39] and we could refer to my map anytime i
[2:12:42] needed to and we start along the journey
[2:12:44] and
[2:12:45] about two in the morning it's about 16
[2:12:48] hour drive there and about two in the
[2:12:50] morning i got real tired and i said hey
[2:12:52] would you drive for an hour
[2:12:54] uh and he said yeah he said i'll let you
[2:12:56] rest for an hour he said i'd be glad to
[2:12:59] i said okay i'm gonna go to sleep now
[2:13:00] there's a turn down here you want to
[2:13:02] watch listen you can go to sleep i've
[2:13:04] been this way many many times
[2:13:10] so i go to sleep
[2:13:12] and i'm sleeping maybe 30 40 minutes and
[2:13:15] all of a sudden i feel the vehicle come
[2:13:17] to stop
[2:13:19] and i raise up
[2:13:21] and i look around
[2:13:24] and he's i said where are we he said i
[2:13:26] don't know the road just disappeared
[2:13:30] i said roads just can't disappear
[2:13:34] i said where are we at he said i don't
[2:13:36] know look on that map and tell us where
[2:13:38] we're at
[2:13:40] i said math don't work that way
[2:13:43] i can't look at this map and tell you
[2:13:45] where we're at
[2:13:47] i said but since you got us lost you see
[2:13:50] that store right there walk in there and
[2:13:53] ask this question where am i
[2:14:00] and if you can tell me where we are
[2:14:04] i can look on this map
[2:14:06] and get us back on the right road to
[2:14:08] florida
[2:14:14] you're getting adrift
[2:14:16] that's what god did in this day
[2:14:18] we had a road map
[2:14:21] but we didn't know where we were
[2:14:24] and so god sent a seer
[2:14:27] a prophet
[2:14:29] that opened the map and said right
[2:14:30] here's where you're at
[2:14:32] you're in the last age during the last
[2:14:35] days little children it's rapture time
[2:14:40] hallelujah
[2:14:42] now we can use the road map
[2:14:46] to go all the way
[2:14:50] you know why because that seer marked it
[2:14:53] out clearly the path all the way to the
[2:14:56] don't get off the path
[2:14:58] stay with the message
[2:15:08] so you know
[2:15:09] we have spent 50 60 years
[2:15:13] since we have discovered where we're at
[2:15:15] in time
[2:15:16] that we as a church have journeyed now
[2:15:18] we can look back on the map say we
[2:15:20] started back here on the day of
[2:15:21] pentecost
[2:15:22] and we come down through here ephesus
[2:15:24] and smyrna and i that that sign post was
[2:15:27] that signpost right there that was uh
[2:15:29] paul and and here here it was and we can
[2:15:32] trace it right on down through seven
[2:15:34] ages
[2:15:35] and we have now come to the last one
[2:15:39] now as we're sailing along in the boat
[2:15:43] and you know resting between revivals
[2:15:47] you don't get a little relaxing time and
[2:15:50] we're not only testifying about what god
[2:15:52] did but then we start talking about
[2:15:55] the doctrines of jesus
[2:15:59] and somehow we begin to hear things in
[2:16:02] views that are expressed in the boat
[2:16:04] uh that pentecost is not our goal is not
[2:16:07] our destination
[2:16:09] it's not where we're supposed to be
[2:16:12] that you know that somehow another
[2:16:15] you know before jesus went to sleep in
[2:16:17] our boat
[2:16:18] he taught the and all believers used to
[2:16:20] believe
[2:16:21] that malachi 4 was to turn our hearts
[2:16:24] back to the faith of the pentecostal
[2:16:25] fathers
[2:16:28] but now many are not sure that they're
[2:16:30] even to be like the original church
[2:16:37] well i wanted to say god had a church
[2:16:39] like he wanted
[2:16:41] and now he wants a church like he
[2:16:44] started
[2:16:46] [Applause]
[2:16:48] but somehow the thought is we're to end
[2:16:50] up somewhere different than what was
[2:16:52] poured out at pentecost
[2:16:55] and winds that begin to howl and the
[2:16:58] devil gets into those winds and you know
[2:17:00] there's no such thing as miracles you
[2:17:02] know just quieting down your testimony
[2:17:04] boys you know women don't you say amen
[2:17:06] no more i mean you know come on
[2:17:08] yeah there's nothing to be excited about
[2:17:11] this is a boat trip
[2:17:15] god don't do miracles anymore
[2:17:19] but even the devil that gets in the
[2:17:21] storm knows
[2:17:23] assuredly that the original church at
[2:17:25] pentecost with the power of god mark 16
[2:17:28] in action is the true church that jesus
[2:17:31] claims is his own and all else is false
[2:17:35] it has to be he said christ in the true
[2:17:38] church is a continuation of the book of
[2:17:42] acts
[2:17:43] [Applause]
[2:17:46] amen
[2:17:47] so you know we're not just returning to
[2:17:49] the book of acts we are continuing
[2:17:53] where they failed we have went back
[2:17:57] there and we're going to finish the race
[2:18:00] [Applause]
[2:18:05] now the seven ages were represented by
[2:18:07] seven lamps
[2:18:09] the holy fire from the altar being
[2:18:10] passed from lamb to lamp is a type of
[2:18:12] the holy spirit in the seven church ages
[2:18:16] that original outpouring of the holy of
[2:18:18] the holy ghost at pentecost which came
[2:18:21] direct from jesus on the mercy seat is
[2:18:24] enduring
[2:18:25] is endowing his church um through this
[2:18:29] all seven ages showing he's the same
[2:18:31] yesterday today and forever
[2:18:33] so what happened god lit the first one
[2:18:35] the light from there lights the next the
[2:18:37] light from there lights the next all the
[2:18:38] way down to the end showing jesus christ
[2:18:41] is the same yesterday today and forever
[2:18:45] but somehow we've been told now there we
[2:18:47] got something different than they what
[2:18:49] they had in acts 2.
[2:18:52] indeed many have us
[2:18:55] it's true
[2:18:56] it don't match the original outpouring
[2:18:58] at all
[2:19:00] and whatever this snake oil is that
[2:19:02] they're trying to burn the fire god
[2:19:04] won't stay lit on it
[2:19:07] you see what the church was at pentecost
[2:19:10] is the standard
[2:19:12] that is the pattern
[2:19:14] there is no other pattern
[2:19:18] but somehow we're winding up with
[2:19:19] something different we don't want to be
[2:19:21] those acts 2 38 screaming blabbering
[2:19:23] shouting amen
[2:19:25] who have the second adam's way of acting
[2:19:27] we don't want children like that
[2:19:30] so then where the church becomes like
[2:19:32] those women screaming down there about
[2:19:34] roe versus wade we want to kill those
[2:19:37] because we don't want that kind of noise
[2:19:39] in our church
[2:19:41] so we'll abort those noisy kids but we
[2:19:43] don't have time for that in our society
[2:19:46] church
[2:19:49] after all is our body
[2:19:52] it's our church
[2:19:56] well your womb must have been for the
[2:19:58] holy spirit to bear forth his life
[2:20:03] in case women have forgotten that's what
[2:20:06] a womb is for
[2:20:09] that's what marriage is all about
[2:20:12] to reproduce
[2:20:15] that life again
[2:20:18] and why does god want a womb in this
[2:20:20] last day he wants to reproduce his life
[2:20:24] he wants to put his spirit into a body
[2:20:28] and he wants that seed of his own seed
[2:20:30] he don't want any of every top dick and
[2:20:32] harry out here he wants it out of his
[2:20:35] own life
[2:20:36] [Applause]
[2:20:40] but we're told to expect different
[2:20:41] results
[2:20:42] and if
[2:20:44] and if the original
[2:20:46] root at pentecost was an orange tree
[2:20:49] how come we got bitter lemons as fruit
[2:20:58] it isn't long that
[2:21:00] in this boat
[2:21:02] you know these oars
[2:21:05] these precious truths
[2:21:07] that we were to push the boat along with
[2:21:10] and wound up as weapons against one
[2:21:12] another
[2:21:15] you don't think that's end time prophecy
[2:21:17] part the end time prophecy is they
[2:21:19] waited on the master's return they began
[2:21:21] to beat one another
[2:21:26] that's part of the coming
[2:21:28] that's part of what will happen in the
[2:21:30] end time
[2:21:32] amen and so you know instead of using it
[2:21:35] there to further the gospel
[2:21:37] we'll use it to beat one another with
[2:21:43] am i but i wouldn't say scripture
[2:21:45] doesn't fight scripture
[2:21:47] and quotes don't fight quotes
[2:21:54] amen and if we're going to say well the
[2:21:56] word has been restored well then take
[2:21:58] all of it
[2:22:02] every bit of it
[2:22:04] amen i want every bit of it if there's
[2:22:06] tongues in it i want it if there's
[2:22:08] healing in it i want it if there's
[2:22:09] shouting in it i want it amen if there's
[2:22:12] a christian stable life in it i want it
[2:22:15] whatever it has i want it
[2:22:17] [Applause]
[2:22:21] so the true church will always try to be
[2:22:23] like the original of pentecost
[2:22:26] the true church today will try to
[2:22:28] approximate the early first one the
[2:22:30] messengers through the churches having
[2:22:32] the same spirit of god in them will try
[2:22:34] to approximate the apostle paul they
[2:22:36] won't be exactly like him but the true
[2:22:38] messengers will be the ones that come
[2:22:40] closest to paul who was free of all men
[2:22:42] sold out to god gave forth the word of
[2:22:44] god only manifested the holy ghost in
[2:22:46] power
[2:22:47] not none else would do
[2:22:49] you gotta work from the original as the
[2:22:52] light begins life the true church will
[2:22:54] always be the one that tries to follow
[2:22:58] in the steps of her founders at
[2:22:59] pentecost and her messengers will follow
[2:23:02] the apostle paul the first messenger to
[2:23:04] the first stage is that simple and that
[2:23:07] wonderful
[2:23:09] but in case you noticed around it's
[2:23:11] getting dark
[2:23:15] out here on this boat you know the skies
[2:23:17] are friendly
[2:23:19] waves are coming up
[2:23:21] trouble's on every hand
[2:23:25] wars and political strife
[2:23:28] the climate isn't real
[2:23:30] good for us on this journey
[2:23:34] amen i mean there's every kind of things
[2:23:37] that
[2:23:38] that where where the left has their
[2:23:40] agenda and we're going to have our
[2:23:42] liberal world order what sure they're
[2:23:44] going to say crown satan
[2:23:48] we're we're we are in a transition where
[2:23:52] there's a bride ascending and satan
[2:23:54] being cast out
[2:23:59] and one day he'll be full king of the
[2:24:01] earth but thank god we won't be here
[2:24:05] but right now we're already feeling the
[2:24:07] winds of persecution we're feeling the
[2:24:10] winds
[2:24:11] the winds and the storms of judgment
[2:24:14] we're feeling the heat of the
[2:24:15] tribulation
[2:24:18] already pre-tribulation plagues are
[2:24:20] coming up on the earth
[2:24:21] [Applause]
[2:24:24] you can't even send your kids to school
[2:24:26] without them coming out contaminated
[2:24:29] two-fold more child of hell when they
[2:24:31] come out than what they were when they
[2:24:32] went in
[2:24:33] it's a troubled world that we're in
[2:24:35] [Applause]
[2:24:38] and satan's got an agenda
[2:24:41] now john you know
[2:24:44] before all this tempus got up
[2:24:46] real big you know
[2:24:49] he began maybe it started with him a
[2:24:51] testimony brother brandon said his heart
[2:24:53] wasn't so scarred with so much theology
[2:24:57] and he must have said think of it right
[2:24:59] in this ship
[2:25:02] this one that's identified by jehovah's
[2:25:04] word to be jehovah's servant and whom he
[2:25:07] is pleased is right here in the ship
[2:25:09] with us
[2:25:11] you know you get your heart all scarred
[2:25:13] with theology
[2:25:18] preacher friend of mine just wrote me
[2:25:19] this morning i just listened to brother
[2:25:21] donnie preaching scarred human beings
[2:25:24] it's uh it's a sermon that's just
[2:25:26] this has just been so profound
[2:25:30] but let me tell you a lot of people are
[2:25:31] scarred with theology
[2:25:35] they've been scarred by preachers
[2:25:39] they've been scarred by doctrines
[2:25:42] they've been scarred by attitudes of
[2:25:44] church members
[2:25:47] they've been scarred you know
[2:25:50] by theology you know
[2:25:53] well we got the thunders right we we are
[2:25:55] the seals i mean we're the opening of
[2:25:57] the word we and they don't live but
[2:25:59] they're open in the word we're we is
[2:26:01] coming we're the epiphany we are the
[2:26:03] perusia
[2:26:06] and well you know it's it doesn't say
[2:26:08] and after a while you get so out of
[2:26:10] focus there ain't even one lord in focus
[2:26:13] anymore there's two laying in your ship
[2:26:18] how'd there get to be two jehovah's and
[2:26:20] two jesuses and two lords and
[2:26:26] amen but your heart but
[2:26:29] but when your heart isn't scarred so
[2:26:31] scarred instead of thinking oh i'm so
[2:26:34] glad of this certain theology man i'm in
[2:26:36] the bride and man us click our four no
[2:26:39] more
[2:26:41] when your heart isn't really scarred
[2:26:43] you're just thankful for his life and
[2:26:46] power within you
[2:26:48] [Music]
[2:26:50] because not to know his theology is life
[2:26:54] not to know even the bible is like but
[2:26:56] to know him as life
[2:26:58] to know him as your savior the one who's
[2:27:01] filled you with his holy spirit you were
[2:27:04] there when it happened
[2:27:06] and nobody can take that away from you
[2:27:10] you see that's what smith wigglesworth
[2:27:12] said years ago he said he that hath an
[2:27:14] experience is not merely
[2:27:16] it is not at the mercies of those who
[2:27:19] merely have an argument
[2:27:23] and i tell you if you don't get the holy
[2:27:24] ghost somebody will out argue you
[2:27:27] somewhere
[2:27:28] and talk you out of the message and
[2:27:31] discredit the messenger
[2:27:34] and it's done that to many but if you
[2:27:36] got an anchor
[2:27:37] [Applause]
[2:27:39] if you got an experience you may not be
[2:27:42] able to explain every bit of that and i
[2:27:44] understand all of that and how come that
[2:27:46] how come that jesus called that woman a
[2:27:49] dog and how come that he he did this and
[2:27:52] ate with sinners and how come he was how
[2:27:54] why did he do that you may not be able
[2:27:56] to understand
[2:27:58] but you know this i met him and he
[2:28:01] changed my life
[2:28:03] [Applause]
[2:28:13] [Music]
[2:28:14] some people say leave the message
[2:28:16] brother tim leave the message
[2:28:18] leave the message i said well give me
[2:28:21] something better
[2:28:24] show me something better
[2:28:26] if i'm going to leave this
[2:28:28] i wouldn't leave it for something unless
[2:28:30] it's better
[2:28:33] you know what you got look at your kids
[2:28:38] look at the drinking habits coming back
[2:28:40] the smoking the doping the anti-god look
[2:28:42] what it's doing to your family look how
[2:28:44] it's taking away holiness and look how
[2:28:47] the fornication and adultery is coming
[2:28:49] look at your lives
[2:28:51] [Applause]
[2:28:54] hey man like brother brother ron told
[2:28:56] one that left his church said you know
[2:28:59] take a picture now what you are
[2:29:04] because down here it's going to be a
[2:29:06] different picture
[2:29:07] [Applause]
[2:29:09] and them same ones you know
[2:29:12] that left for something better
[2:29:14] now tattoos on their fingers
[2:29:17] on their hands
[2:29:20] what are they tattooing
[2:29:23] well done
[2:29:26] so because
[2:29:28] i have to tattoo it here because i'll
[2:29:30] never hear it there
[2:29:38] but you know god called ministers
[2:29:41] ought not be so stuffed with
[2:29:43] theology
[2:29:46] don't look to psychology on how to fix
[2:29:48] problems preach the holy ghost in power
[2:29:53] that affects every marriage problem
[2:29:56] that affects your home life that affects
[2:29:59] your children
[2:30:01] a good old-fashioned prayer meeting
[2:30:04] amen we'll fix the argument in your home
[2:30:08] hey man it'll soften down the woman and
[2:30:10] make her subject to her husband it'll
[2:30:13] better leadership in the man and make
[2:30:15] him a godly leader
[2:30:20] are you with me
[2:30:22] i remember psychology will never do that
[2:30:24] it'll put a band-aid on your problem but
[2:30:26] it won't fix the problem because it's
[2:30:29] sin nature that's got to be dealt with
[2:30:36] brother branham said preachers ought not
[2:30:38] be so stiff with theology but have
[2:30:40] visited the land of where we're going
[2:30:43] bringing back evidence of divine love
[2:30:45] and the power of jesus christ to make
[2:30:47] known to their congregation there's a
[2:30:49] land beyond the river
[2:30:52] hallelujah
[2:30:55] but you know they felt pretty secure
[2:30:58] and you can feel very secure knowing
[2:31:00] jesus is in your boat
[2:31:03] that you know whatever we're doing is
[2:31:05] we're driving along life's ways
[2:31:07] going down the highways jesus lays in
[2:31:09] the ship
[2:31:12] you know
[2:31:13] he's in our little boat is which we're
[2:31:15] so assailing life's solemn maine
[2:31:19] and just think of it
[2:31:21] it's comforting to know he said i'll
[2:31:23] never leave you or forsake you
[2:31:28] amen it's comforting to know that
[2:31:30] we're sealed to the day of redemption
[2:31:35] not just to the next revival we're
[2:31:37] sealed
[2:31:38] even when there isn't revival
[2:31:41] even when we don't feel joy
[2:31:45] even when the meeting's over with and
[2:31:47] we've gone home and back to the regular
[2:31:50] routine we know he's with us
[2:31:53] but you see when trouble set in they
[2:31:55] forgot all about it
[2:31:58] you know but yet he was still as great
[2:32:00] as he ever was he was the one who
[2:32:02] created the sea
[2:32:04] he was the one who created the wind he
[2:32:06] created the world he was able to park
[2:32:09] the red sea
[2:32:11] goodness what could he do with water
[2:32:14] amen he could heal the leper give sight
[2:32:17] to the blind
[2:32:18] he was great as he was anytime he's
[2:32:20] still just as great
[2:32:25] he's still just as great as what he was
[2:32:27] in the divine healing movement he's
[2:32:29] still just as great as he was in the
[2:32:31] prophet
[2:32:33] come on church
[2:32:35] amen and but you know as i said you as
[2:32:39] you're going along the winds begin to
[2:32:41] blow and trouble comes in
[2:32:44] you know then we find little fusses come
[2:32:46] up in the church
[2:32:50] you know churches have been split
[2:32:54] over having a sidewalk built to the
[2:32:56] bathroom or the well y'all call it here
[2:33:00] washroom
[2:33:05] we wash clothes in a washroom
[2:33:08] [Applause]
[2:33:10] but anyway you know and churches split
[2:33:12] over that
[2:33:14] had church split over the most frivolous
[2:33:16] things
[2:33:18] most silliest things
[2:33:21] especially you get in the building
[2:33:23] project or
[2:33:24] our expansion and watch the arguments
[2:33:26] fly
[2:33:29] and then the next thing you know hey you
[2:33:31] know i mean nothing's going right you
[2:33:32] know that'll destroy the church
[2:33:36] so well our pastor pray for him
[2:33:39] have an all-night revival meeting
[2:33:42] call on god
[2:33:44] he can change the situation
[2:33:46] he'll either move in him or move him out
[2:33:51] amen oh if we can just catch the vision
[2:33:54] god hasn't left us
[2:33:58] amen he's the great
[2:34:00] the great almighty jehovah the holy
[2:34:03] ghost in spirit form is in you
[2:34:08] amen jesus said that day you will know
[2:34:10] that i am in the father the father in me
[2:34:12] and i and you
[2:34:15] that all that god was he poured into
[2:34:17] jesus and all that jesus was he pours
[2:34:19] into the church he divided himself on
[2:34:21] the day of pentecost the pillar of fire
[2:34:24] came down
[2:34:25] amen and busted itself up and this kind
[2:34:28] of glory put in different ones
[2:34:31] tongues of fire seen on each one of them
[2:34:34] the holy spirit god identified himself
[2:34:37] as human beings
[2:34:38] do you believe that
[2:34:40] each one of you with the holy ghost has
[2:34:42] a portion of deity within you
[2:34:46] amen and that person is omnipotent
[2:34:50] there's no big heavy spots in god and
[2:34:53] little weak spots in god the very little
[2:34:55] smallest touch of god is omnipotent
[2:34:59] there's omnipotent power
[2:35:02] laying within your life
[2:35:05] and in this church
[2:35:14] but some just need to wake jesus
[2:35:17] he's there
[2:35:18] but you just let him go to sleep in your
[2:35:20] life
[2:35:23] and others don't have jesus to wake up
[2:35:26] some individuals some people some
[2:35:28] churches have went off without him
[2:35:30] [Music]
[2:35:33] and there's two kinds

[2:35:38] and some have him or don't have him they
[2:35:41] went on the journey can you imagine
[2:35:42] going on a journey without jesus

[2:39:54] and guess what peter wasn't a man who
[2:39:57] just walked on the water once
[2:40:00] he walked on the water twice
[2:40:05] come on somebody
[2:40:08] he walked on the water twice
[2:40:12] listen my god's a god of second chances
[2:40:15] third chances four chances fifth chances
[2:40:19] six chances seven chances
[2:40:22] he'll never give up
[2:40:24] he will not be defeated
[2:40:29] and if you walk the water once you can
[2:40:31] walk on water twice
[2:40:38] but whatever you do just keep walking
[2:40:42] until you get jesus in your boat
[2:40:48] [Applause]
[2:40:51] you don't have to drown out there
[2:40:54] you don't have to wallow himself pity
[2:40:57] you don't have to say this is dirty you
[2:40:59] know you don't have to go into suicide
[2:41:02] you can invite jesus in your boat
[2:41:05] walk on your water toward him till you
[2:41:08] and him gets in the boat together
[2:41:13] and you know what happens then the storm
[2:41:14] pharmacies
[2:41:23] [Applause]
[2:41:32] jesus will lift you up and make you to
[2:41:35] walk on water again and come to your
[2:41:38] ship and then you'll have jesus in your
[2:41:41] boat
[2:41:44] and with jesus in your boat you can
[2:41:46] crest any storm you can go through any
[2:41:49] troubled water you can go through any
[2:41:51] problem in life
[2:41:54] it will save you when you're dying
[2:41:57] it will heal you it will deliver you
[2:42:01] it'll do everything when jesus is in
[2:42:03] your boat
[2:42:08] hallelujah
[2:42:09] [Applause]
[2:42:16] there there was their boat
[2:42:18] on the other hand was about to sink
[2:42:21] and somebody finally remembered
[2:42:29] that the one they'd been ignoring
[2:42:32] too busy with theology
[2:42:35] too busy with churchianity
[2:42:37] too very busy just going through the
[2:42:39] motion of things
[2:42:41] too busy with life
[2:42:46] and the one they had been ignoring
[2:42:50] was asleep
[2:42:52] and somebody said we better wake jesus
[2:42:55] up
[2:42:59] these waves we ain't gonna make it
[2:43:02] if jesus don't come to wake in our lives
[2:43:05] we're never gonna make it
[2:43:08] we've got to get to the other side
[2:43:11] amen so it dawned on somebody you know
[2:43:15] that the one who had been resting
[2:43:18] between the revivals
[2:43:21] the one that left go to sleep
[2:43:24] because emphasis was put on other things
[2:43:26] oh they were still talking about jesus
[2:43:30] they were still discussing the quotes
[2:43:34] they were even slapping one another with
[2:43:36] oars and say you big dummy you know i've
[2:43:38] got more revelation than you and you
[2:43:41] know i was the first to meet jesus and i
[2:43:43] was the first to recognize him and i'm
[2:43:46] number one preacher in the message
[2:43:51] all that may be okay until
[2:43:54] storm comes
[2:43:55] [Applause]
[2:43:57] but when the storm comes you're going to
[2:43:59] need jesus
[2:44:03] [Music]
[2:44:08] all of a sudden
[2:44:11] two lords ain't so important
[2:44:15] i better know the lord
[2:44:19] all of a sudden an emotionless religion
[2:44:21] kind of gets emotional
[2:44:24] [Applause]
[2:44:28] i need jesus
[2:44:30] when you begin to realize your need
[2:44:34] that he's got to be brought back to
[2:44:36] forefront
[2:44:38] that he's got to be number one in your
[2:44:40] life
[2:44:42] that he can't just be resting between
[2:44:45] revival and we're fussing and stewing
[2:44:47] and worried and tore up and doubting
[2:44:51] while the creator is laying in our boat
[2:44:55] listen the very god let it dawn on us
[2:44:58] today that lay you know that this
[2:45:01] dawning just come that the very god that
[2:45:03] separated you from your mother that gave
[2:45:06] you the holy ghost that he's just as
[2:45:09] much god right now
[2:45:11] [Applause]

[2:45:35] you won't even do what the bible says no

[2:45:40] believers

[2:46:48] better
[2:46:49] it's fixing to get worse
[2:46:52] you think you've seen the wave of sin it
[2:46:55] ain't nothing yet
[2:47:00] but it began to dawn them you know that
[2:47:02] and brother branham said maybe
[2:47:05] and he he had come to the end of the
[2:47:07] divine healing movement and listen to
[2:47:09] his words maybe between the revivals now
[2:47:12] and we are looking for another stir
[2:47:15] where there's got to be have something
[2:47:17] happen that will gather the church
[2:47:19] together
[2:47:22] amen you know
[2:47:23] this revival
[2:47:26] it will crescendo in the dead in christ
[2:47:29] rising
[2:47:31] and us being changed to meet the lord in
[2:47:33] the air
[2:47:37] now now look
[2:47:39] we've got to get there
[2:47:41] [Applause]
[2:47:43] we've got to get to the other side
[2:47:45] there's things that's got to happen
[2:47:48] you see on the other side there was a
[2:47:50] legions there was legions waiting for
[2:47:52] deliverance
[2:47:55] and
[2:47:56] and you see the legion that had
[2:47:59] been
[2:48:01] he was so overtaken
[2:48:03] by by sin and chains
[2:48:06] and they you know all kinds of things
[2:48:08] that he was among the tombs
[2:48:14] are you with me and they're legionary he
[2:48:19] he
[2:48:19] he was among the tombs dead things
[2:48:23] and jesus went to deliver a man who was
[2:48:26] among the tombs
[2:48:30] because one moment
[2:48:33] just in one moment
[2:48:35] when he was there at his worst
[2:48:39] just for a brief second
[2:48:42] he came to himself enough
[2:48:45] to whisper a prayer
[2:48:47] god help me
[2:48:52] and it just so happened
[2:48:54] that the god he was praying to
[2:48:57] was across the sea
[2:49:00] way over there
[2:49:02] out of what they thought was hearing
[2:49:07] but you see god's never out of hearing
[2:49:11] he hears even allegiance prayer
[2:49:15] that little whisper from the worst
[2:49:18] center
[2:49:19] saying god
[2:49:21] help me
[2:49:23] [Applause]
[2:49:26] maybe it was just whispered
[2:49:28] that morning in the tomb
[2:49:32] and jesus
[2:49:34] left the other meetings
[2:49:39] why he had come all the way from heaven
[2:49:41] come on somebody
[2:49:42] he had not just left the meeting he had
[2:49:44] come all the way from heaven to find
[2:49:46] legion

[2:49:51] thank you
[2:49:52] jesus thank you jesus
[2:49:55] he'll come all the way from glory this
[2:49:57] morning
[2:49:59] he'll orchestrate one meeting
[2:50:02] he'll then still have the entire meeting
[2:50:05] for what legion
[2:50:07] for one person
[2:50:09] from one sinner
[2:50:11] [Applause]
[2:50:14] he's a god who cares
[2:50:16] [Applause]
[2:50:20] he cares for you
[2:50:23] he cares about your sickness
[2:50:25] he was wounded for your transgressions
[2:50:28] he was bruised because of your iniquity
[2:50:31] the weapons you should have taken he
[2:50:33] took them for you and by those stripes
[2:50:36] you are
[2:50:37] delivered
[2:50:39] delivered
[2:50:46] thank you
[2:50:48] on the other side
[2:50:50] on the other side of this storm
[2:50:52] on the other side of this awakening
[2:50:56] on this other side of awakening jesus
[2:50:59] there was there was those
[2:51:02] who were going to be touched
[2:51:04] but jesus had to be awakened in the boat
[2:51:09] before they could be delivered
[2:51:13] they were on the way to deliverance
[2:51:17] of men who had been among the tombs
[2:51:20] broken men
[2:51:22] shattered
[2:51:23] helpless lives
[2:51:26] oh my
[2:51:28] what do i hear around the message
[2:51:30] i hear sounds of children
[2:51:35] of little kids with autism
[2:51:38] laying there afflicted for years and
[2:51:40] years
[2:51:42] little more than mindless vegetables and
[2:51:45] exhausted parents
[2:51:49] i hear of husbands that are drunks
[2:51:52] smothered over memories of a horrible
[2:51:55] childhood where he watched murders

[2:52:15] children
[2:52:16] that were raised in the message

[2:52:42] i'm not trying to give anybody hope i'm

[2:53:40] thinking
[2:53:44] we got to realize that jesus is in our

[2:54:04] women that came to brother branson's
[2:54:06] meetings that were hopeless

[2:55:30] and
[2:55:31] he was unable to walk or crawl
[2:55:35] couldn't he pull up
[2:55:37] at 18 months old he could we could put
[2:55:39] him in his little hands there and he
[2:55:41] just taught her
[2:55:43] couldn't take a step
[2:55:46] doctors said he had an underdeveloped
[2:55:48] hip
[2:55:51] he was talking about operations earlier
[2:55:53] before that at our family camp
[2:55:56] bethany had come to the prayer line
[2:55:58] leaving her baby there in the in a room
[2:56:00] with a baby monitor to listen out for it
[2:56:02] and came through the prayer line brother
[2:56:04] ron stopped her and said where's your
[2:56:05] baby
[2:56:06] i said i just saw him in a vision
[2:56:08] walking
[2:56:15] he brought him
[2:56:17] had prayer for him
[2:56:19] nothing happened right then
[2:56:21] now that was about a year old and now it

[2:56:33] weak in his body
[2:56:35] unable to
[2:56:37] crawl or stand alone bethany comes in
[2:56:41] that morning
[2:56:43] and she sets little drew at the end of
[2:56:46] her mother's bed
[2:56:48] and her mother had been sitting there
[2:56:50] kind of in despair
[2:56:53] feeling sorry for herself
[2:56:56] and then she began to remember but i got
[2:56:58] jesus in this ship
[2:57:00] [Applause]
[2:57:01] [Music]
[2:57:02] and she began to think with him and his
[2:57:04] ship all things are possible
[2:57:06] and i don't have to fear about the
[2:57:08] future
[2:57:09] i know god's a healer
[2:57:12] and she just lifted her hand to begin to
[2:57:14] praise him and she did her sight came
[2:57:16] back
[2:57:19] and the holy spirit moved over that bed
[2:57:23] to that baby sitting in the middle of
[2:57:25] the floor and he jumped up by himself
[2:57:28] out of the middle of the floor and ran
[2:57:30] all over our house

[2:58:30] and when hope was against him and there
