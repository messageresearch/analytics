Heavenly Father we truly want to be here and abide in your presence as that song that we just sang would Express Lord there's nothing that this world has to offer that even can compare with what we have in you Lord it's such a blessing and an honor to to feel your presence and then to to know that you're working in our hearts changing us molding us into what you would have us to be Lord even as we heard last night father how that we need to recognize Who We Are and father I just was struck how that the reason that we don't know that Lord it is he says it's just because of fear and how that the church needs more of that love that there'd be no place for that fear so Lord that's my request tonight Lord that you would just pour out your love Upon Us Lord we'd have a greater love for you for your word for one another and Lord that you would have the freedom then to move in our midst and accomplish what you have purposed tonight Lord be with our worship may you be honored and glorified

[Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] will sing and even some of them he wrote verses for there was just one song where the Bram said you'll be singing on the other side and I think that's the story of not just brother bran but each and every one of us Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound my brother and I will be doing the song I just a bit of a medley and we trust the Lord will bring his blessings down amen [Music] Grace how sweet the sound that saved all right rich like me [Music] I once once was lost but now now I'm found I was blind I was blind boy now I see [Music] foreign [Music] laughs [Music] I shall fall foreign [Music] cry wedges Jesus died for me how my mind the grace that caught my Fallen songs [Music] he looked look beyond my faults and soul my knees [Music] and when we've been there Ten Thousand Years [Music] the Sun you can join us now with no last days we've known less days to sing God's praise then when we first [Music] all together now [Music] many days [Music] you're here today foreign Grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] we need me on [Music] and Grace will lead me on [Music] um [Applause] mm-hmm amen hallelujah I tell you what it's Grace Grace God's Amazing Grace through many trials and troubles and cares we have already come praise the Lord I was you know when we think about that I was reminded of a quote brother Brown and the church age book he said never has there been a people who has been so beaten down so scored so I'm paraphrasing now but so rejected so made fun of as the Bride of Jesus Christ but it will be worth it all when we get there hallelujah hallelujah [Music] day after death rages [Music] and I feel so worn down [Music] the praise pressure now seems so much greater I wonder Lord how came I stand and down on my knees at the foot of the altar gently it takes mine please just a little bit higher shows me that he still in command he says my child why so damn Hardy why so gloomy why so sad foreign [Music] [Music] such thing as failure why it's all just according to his plan which stand up tall and confess our God is able he has promised we rare to this land he says my child why so down Hardy why so gloomy why so sad for our finish soon what I have started I've chosen you child go take the land he says my child why so down Hardy why so gloomy why so sad for our finish soon what I I have started I've chosen your child go take the lane I've chosen you child go take the land [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah I will invite the brothers to come sing that song when believing isn't easy tonight last night we heard from a Young Man on Fire for God and what a masterpiece what a masterpiece deity isn't in heaven but deity is in you it isn't I believe tonight we're gonna we're gonna hear from the Lord through a walking miracle and I believe that you could look at this song and he could say of anyone when believing isn't easy to keep pressing forward to keep going forward let's all stand it's not hard to believe when you're standing on the mountain top it's not hard to believe standing on the mountain tops in glory when you can hear these songs of angels and the breeze from Heaven sends your spirit sorry [Applause] [Music] oh but in the valley once more will Jesus still be long that's the question because believe me cause believing when believing isn't easy there's a test that is the testing also we need faith [Music] faith for the time when the sun does not shine and the Mountaintop is just a memory [Music] there's no sign to be seen and I don't feel a thing or to the word of God Alone and I need strength for the day when troubles come my way and I just don't understand what it means that's when nothing else will do but faith faith alone will see me through and believing becomes my victory it's not hard to believe when things are going well and skies are sunny [Music] when you feel you're making progress [Music] or would you still keep the faith that's the question that's the question because [Music] testing I need strength I need faith I need faith for the time when the sun does not shine at the Mountaintop is just a memory when there's no sight to be seen and I don't feel a thing but to the word God Alone [Music] and when troubles come my way and I just don't understand what it means that's when nothing else and believing because my victory amen let's give the Lord a hand clap [Applause] Elijah was told arise and eat for the Journey's too great for you if we don't have him we're never going to make it if we don't feed if we don't water our faith that's what we're here to do this weekend you that are here and you've been in this pre-service and the singing you will know that in this room right now is not just the person sitting beside you but there are angels there's the presence of God and I just encourage you stay in this atmosphere through this service we welcome you tonight those that have come in we we greet you we thank you for coming and being a part of these meetings and God bless you listen why don't you have your seats for a moment I'm going to get nervous if I keep talking while you're standing so I'll probably keep be nervous while you're sitting too but that's okay so we've had some visitors come in I believe we've had some come in from Calgary brother Berry good to see you brother Toby I enjoyed that special and your brother like you do my your brother's mind coming on a preaching tour with me you can be my opening act and I'll I'll be okay people might not remember the preaching but they'll remember the singing and the sacks I love the sacks I'm kind of partial to the horn section myself but that's an inside joke for our congregation here so anyway we welcome you those from Calgary we've mentioned some from from Saskatchewan there's a whole bunch here from Grand Prairie we welcome all those from Grand Prairie brother Darren brother Stephen your families God bless you thank you for coming for participating I see many others and as I said yesterday if I don't mention you in this service don't worry I got two more to go I don't know what I'm going to do when I get to the last service because by then I'll miss somebody but God bless you brother weeb God bless you good to see everybody that's here we also have some Believers here from New York we have a couple sisters that came God bless you we thank you for coming to our meetings and to our little part of the world and we have some here also saw I think I saw brother Solomon I guess he hails from Washington State now but he used to be from Edmonton so I'll still welcome you as an edmontonian today but that's okay so God bless you hey man I want to just give you a brief announce a few brief announcements about the services we started last night and for those that you aren't here I don't want to just make you feel bad or anything but I'll say it's worthwhile to go back and listen to that it's not robbery if I could characterize it this way today we had a little gathering over at brother Jake and sister Mary's brother Ron used to be a stranger but he's at home in that house now and brother Ron can go in that house and he can open the fridge door and he can take something out and he can say and sit down and do it and I'll tell you what it's not robbery now somebody else from Russia from from Virginia could do that and it would be robbery so that's that's just a little pre you know they have those little Clips before the main thing well that's what the service was all about and it was a blessing we had brother Nathan preach for us and that was not just plowing that was more than plowing and we we enjoyed that immensely amen tonight we're going to have brother Ron Spencer speaking for us and he'll be coming up and you'll be happy to know his luggage arrived and uh [Applause] I don't know if that's good or bad because after he had to come up here in his jeans tonight I was looking forward to wearing jeans and making him feel at home but I had to Alas go back to my regular attire so he'll be speaking tonight he'll be also speaking tomorrow night and I'll just deal with that shortly but tomorrow we've got a full day at 9 30 we've got a Minister's meeting and that's for ministers and their wife to come and if you haven't been invited and you feel you're qualified to do so please come and see me and we'll we'll be happy to welcome you that'll be at 9 30 Brother Ray Erickson will be giving a little little time to the brothers and their wives there we're looking forward to that tomorrow 1 30 tomorrow afternoon we've got a youth meeting here brother Nathan will be speaking and I we've always had good youth meetings I believe we're going to have a wonderful service and you know the meetings are good when people ask you what's the age limit for the youth meeting and uh you know it used to be limited to single people up to 30 well after much discussion we've opened it up to anybody that's married in 85. so uh no we're not we're not going to do it but the service can be streamed so but we'll keep it for the Youth but you know they're good meetings you know even even the ministers meeting there was a brother that was asking me says uh can I be ordained and attend the meeting and I said well I don't know about that brother I said well appreciate and somebody was standing nearby and said hey can I can I be ordained to come to and I said sister I appreciate your Zeal but but we're running into doctrinal issues here so but uh anyways you know they're good meetings when those things happen so anyway and then tomorrow night brother Ron will be speaking as well and uh on Sunday we're gonna Brother Ray Erickson come and he'll address the troops and uh I just I can't tell you how much I appreciate Brother Ray he's just been a stalwart General in the message and uh you saw the fruits of it last night with his grandson his son is also here um that afternoon after that'll be the last service but you're welcome to stay after that service will be going out for lunch or you go out for lunch as you would please but later that afternoon at 4 30 we're having a picnic at brother Andrew and sister Melissa Dodds and you're all welcome to come we've got some maps at the back and on the route there there is uh we're having a little open viewing at the cemetery where our founding Pastor brother Harold Hildebrandt was was laid to rest and that'll be between three and four to four Thirty tomorrow on Sunday afternoon we've also got maps for that Thief sister Leanne recently had the headstone there and about 3 30 or so we're going to have brother Ron just say a few words there as well so if if you are here and you want to not everybody that was here could come at the time brother Harold passed last year so we're going to open that up and we want to just honor that and remember that as well so that that's kind of the events we've got some maps at the back I mentioned yesterday regarding the parking there's parking attendance that will direct you on that um tonight brother Ron is going to minister and tomorrow night and I just want to say this about brother Ron he's he has been here for many years and we appreciate you know in God's economy God has had there are stars and and I don't mean like stars that way but in in the in the solar system some shine brighter some lesser but they're all stars they're all reflecting the light of God and God places certain stars at certain place the North Star different ones brother on has been a blessing to many people around the world and his gift is not just that of a pastor but it's a greater gift there's a gift of faith Associated there's a gift of healing and so I I want you to recognize that it's God in that vessel and in that gift so he'll speak tonight but then on Saturday night we want to make room and and we've we've talked on that but we want to make room that if you will need prayer that we can have a time to have prayer you know in the in in The Book of Mark and let me just take a moment or two to say this but the commission the Great Commission was that these signs would follow them that believe we would we would go into the gospel preach the world those that would believe would be and be baptized to be saved but it would say also in my name they shall cast out devils and I want to say I believe that Devils will be cast out tonight tomorrow I believe that the kingdom of Satan is going to suffer a blow because the Believers are here and the angels of God are here it says they will also speak with new tongues they will take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing will not hurt them and they will lay hands on the sick and the sick will recover so I believe we need to leave room for that we were in a little bit of a Pew project we had an extra Pew but we took that out I felt we needed to have more room at the front not just for prayer but for people to come to lay their burdens down so tomorrow night we're going to just leave space for that and if I can just give you this short Little Instruction I want if you need prayer I want you to do as the prophet would say in perfect faith don't come up unless you have faith for that don't don't just come up well that's brother Ron and whatever will happen no why don't you set yourself today tomorrow and if you have a need allow that need to come into the presence of God before you ever come into the prayer line and then we do that also as you come up be recognizing that we're all working together this is not brother Ron this is God in the body God working through a gift and you need to respect that there's there's limitations to that gift so when you come up you might just mention a need don't tell your life story just say the need let let God come on the scene is this all right okay I don't want to change the atmosphere too much I'm not going to say much more but I believe we we need to become more mature and say yeah we're going to do everything Mark 16 said but we're going to do it in a way oh God is a mature body with faith in what God will do let's just stand together so we're going to settle our Spirits a little bit but let's just sing a song Maybe Just let's sing How Great Is Our God how um the one I wanted sing with me hungry how great [Music] sing with me [Music] how great is our God the splendor the Splendor of a king rejoice [Music] all the Earth rejoice [Music] it trembles at his voice it trembles [Music] is [Music] [Applause] on and he's the name oh he is and he's worthy always [Music] [Applause] [Music] is worthy of all things and my heart will sing I'll praise [Music] [Applause] my heart will say I'll pray it's all gone without music oh how great [Music] God sing with me how great [Music] is our God and all we'll see how great how great How great is our God how great Our God sing with me or sing with me how great is my God alone [Music] we're gonna invite brother Ron to come up I want us just to all sacrifice our thoughts our beings to one cause in this service we're out against one enemy and we've got a brother here who's given himself and I've seen God working with him we've got a tall brother got an elder brother we've got a brother in between I don't know what we're going to do with that guy but neither does the kingdom of of Hell know what they're going to do with him and I believe God has ordained them to be here entertain them to be a part of the Bride in this hour now as we just invite him to come let's just sing fill my cup Lord I lift it up as we do that okay [Music] foreign [Music] before so he is [Music] that your desire that he would come to where you're at he's made a promise he's a personal God [Music] and he's that kind of God he he can take an audience of this size and speak to every one of us and he can tell you how special you are [Music] and make you feel like you're the only one in the room that's quite a God isn't it no we don't need our names called or our whole situation but in a moment we can we can just know that we know that we know we know him and I would say this to you today there's no one like him there's just no one like him amen maybe you have a need on your heart today that you'd like to say Lord would you remember me just remember me every service has the potential to be the greatest service you've ever been in maybe for the one standing beside of you it won't be like that but for you but for you Lord come near us now we feel these presence we know he's in the room now just invite him to where you're at Heavenly Father [Music] the god of Jacob Isaac [Music] God of our prophet [Music] our God Lord You're Not Our God until we make you our God and we sense that you're in the room we have prayed we have felt burdened but now the time has come last night we heard a masterpiece Lord how you touched our hearts and we've reveled in it through the night and even today how you can take a young man even in a message royal family and give him a new birth then when he steps behind the pulpit he has so been saturated by the presence of the Lord it's no more that man but it's now the Christ of this Bible Lord we didn't come here to feed on the on the mind of a man or the personality of a man Lord the only thing that makes us Great Is You we're a body we're a team we're believers now Lord Jesus we ask you fathers our hands have went up and we all have great needs and you can meet them in this service we'll have a prayer line tomorrow night let us not put it aside till tomorrow could we just Reach Out And Touch the Lord as you would pass by father Lord anoint your servant we can study and we can we can just father try to find the channel but we need you now that's just not speaker that's here now I ask you to touch our hearts today bless this church bless every visitor bless everyone for all the efforts that they have made bless brother Ed in this congregation and all the officers 30 years this church is known around the world I think how Sovereign it is as brother Ed shared with me that he and sister Sandy was the first wedding in this church there's no accidents with God we thank you Father for this servant brother Harold that now stands with the Saints of all the ages Lord we thank you for his life his friendship [Music] now Lord as we enjoy these moments together may we just absorb this time [Music] father it's a fleeting and it's passing so quickly touch us now we pray in Jesus Christ name we pray amen and amen amen God bless you I'm so honored to stand here with you and to be back again Feels Like Home and we've been here for a long time now and my hair was once red like his and it's not that way anymore I'm not a lick taller yeah but it's okay to be short amen John Wesley was five foot one and he shook the Earth and so maybe at five foot five I can shake it a little bit too so I would like to just take just a moment I'm sorry to keep you standing but I'd like to take a moment to thank you for your prayers for us as our journey has continued and and we're alive and we thank God for life and we we thank you for your prayers for us we we continue to take chemotherapy every day twice a day and for those that don't know we have brain cancer and lung cancer and uh and the doctors tell us that what a miracle that we are and we know that and we they always attribute it to our God and and so we're thankful we're thankful to have good doctors and brother Branham went to good doctors and he said if you don't if you don't believe in their medicine don't go to them and but we're thankful yes chemotherapy makes you sick chemotherapy makes you do a lot of things and and we've also we've lost a bit of weight and and

special lady amen thank you for your time and we love you with all of our hearts and you know where it was March and I was having a very difficult time I was thinking of this meeting and it was a burden like I had a weight on me like I had the flu sister Connie took me to Cracker Barrel it's American institution you ought to try it sometime and we were sitting in in overflow chairs because my strength wasn't enough I could stand and we were sitting there and I told her I said you know I've been talking to you about my burden for the Edmonton meetings I haven't been contacted maybe they won't have me this year and while it was having the conversation brother Ed wrote me and I said look at here God's always on time and God just don't do things to do things he's got a plan so as I stand here before you today I I want to share a few thoughts what's on my heart I will continue tomorrow night and as the strength will allow me and and I'd like to speak to you on the authority and the name of Jesus to destroy the works of the devil [Applause] amen if you will turn with me to Psalms chapter 46 and verse 1. let's let's have a good time turn to your neighbor and say let's have church I don't know how far you've come I don't know what your situation is I don't know what you got going on after service but let's go ahead and have church amen amen Psalms 46 and verse 1. God is our refuge and strength a very present help and trouble therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and the be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereofs Allah there is a river in the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved God shall shall help her and that right early the Heathen raged and the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice and the Earth melted the Lord of hosts is with us I love that don't you the god of Jacob is our refuge come Behold The Works of the Lord what desolation he hath made in the earth he maketh worse to cease unto the end of the Earth he brick at the bow and cutth the spear and Sunder he burneth The Chariot in fire be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen and I will be exalted in the Earth the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge amen you can be seated Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 14. Heal Me O Lord and I shall be healed save me and I shall be saved for thou art my praise Psalm 6 and verse 2 have mercy upon Me O Lord for I am weak O Lord Heal me for my bones are vexed Psalms 12 and verse 4 who have said with our tongue will we Prevail our lips are our own who is Lord over Isaiah 54 and verse 17 no weapon [Applause] Hallelujah no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is not only a prophetic and promise of the scripture for the most powerful people on the Earth but this is also an action scripture so I would like for Satan to listen he's here he's here you'll have to cast him out no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against them the Judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness of me notice these next words saith the Lord [Music] we know God is a God that's never lied he's a God that's never failed we could pray a prayer like this Lord Jesus you are the name above every name your name is like a fortified Tower in which I can find Safety and Security when I'm troubled I can find peace in your name when I am weak when I feel weak I can found strength in your name when I'm overwhelmed I can find rest in your name when I feel surrounded by the pressures on every side I can find stability in your name you're never present help in the time of troubles when it seemed like the world is crumbling around me I am thrown around by the storms of my life take away my fear when I am weak You Are My Strength when I am vulnerable you are my refuge when I cry for help you will answer me you are the Prince of Peace you are the Lord of lords you are the king of kings I want you to remind mind you today that this is a Jesus meeting this is a Jesus meeting now in a Jesus meeting maybe you've come and and you know maybe there's someone that's a sinner or someone that's got a lot of difficulties in their life and maybe the law of the scripture says that they shouldn't be among the sir maybe this one's done that to hurt you or this one's had this little acts against one another and you know and a lot of times Satan gets in the details of a lot of things and he'll begin to work because he knows he can't defeat the word as a matter of fact he can't even get to your soul but he afflicts your flesh and he afflicts your spirit and you can get in a spirit to where that it can take you in a lot of different directions and it'll cause you to be critical with one another it'll cause you to be sharp with one another brother Ed hadn't told me anything so I I just feel free I'm a pastor too and so it'll cost us Humanity it'll cause our Humanity to look across the Pew and maybe have a dart but in Jesus's meetings you find a place to where you can drop your rocks see sometimes we come to church even in a convention and we're looking over here and we're looking over here and we're looking over there and we're looking over there and and if we're not careful we'll get in an accusing or a atmosphere of who's here and who's not here and we have a whole pocket full of rocks but but when they brought a woman before Jesus to accuse her and and they had a right and the law said that they could and there was a lot of things that that was at trial here today what would Jesus do with his own word and Jesus knew their atmosphere he knew the real reason behind the reason now he wasn't going to change his word so he just simply stooped down and preached [Applause] you know in some of these most powerful moments he was quiet he was quiet before Pilate with a screaming mob his silence was deafening and Jesus asked these men that are accusing this woman and they have they have stones to do the job and Jesus says he that is without sin amen now he is without sin cast the first stone I think that's one thing that brother Branham was so successful at coming from a family of bootleggers he always remembered it he was the most important one in the room we can remember where we came from and Satan tried to destroy us in our potential form he would have did everything against us then to try to destroy us because he could see a light following you even while you were a sinner he could look in that realm and see that light that was following you that angel that was protecting you when you was unworthy when you were an alien from the kingdom of God when you was a nobody not a church wanted you but Jesus had a plan in your life [Applause] [Music] and no doubt Your Vessel was being used to do a lot of things but one day God would empty that vessel and fill it with the spirit of God and then shake the kingdom of hell with that now I want to ask you a woman where is thy accuser Give the Lord a good hand he is the name above every name he is far above every principality and Power his Dominion not only is in this world but in the world to come there has never been one greater than the name of Jesus Christ it is the highest of all names God has gathered you to represent him on the Earth of all the people down through the ages of time he has saved you to this day knowing that this would be Satan's Eden where every demon of hell would be loosed against you hear the words Invincible Army super race super Church Barnaby's bone life of his life those were not casual words [Applause] but that was not just the words of our Prophet but that was the words of God about you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now if you can believe it you heard it last night but it's now more than just believing it but now it's got to take action [Applause] now remember Brandon said now God just doesn't make a tree just to see if he can do it he just doesn't make this to see if he can do it he just doesn't do that to see if he can do it he just didn't watch over you since the days of Adam this one Mary and that one and this one Mary and that one and this one Mary and that one all the way down even when Jesus was here you're you're your seed was on the Earth and God watched over your seed in that natural form Wars and pestilence and and moving from country to Country and watching over you God was watching over your seat now you may be the only one in that natural lineage that ever has become a Christian [Applause] you may have had a lot of history of evil in your family but God rich in Mercy [Applause] God rich and mercy watched over you because before the foundational world before there was ever a molecule of this Earth displayed he saw you he knew Adam would fall and because you were in the book and because he had created his own enemy he knew that we would have forces against us so he came himself [Applause] he just didn't send an angel he came himself [Applause] to provide everything that you would have made of to overcome in this day [Applause] now he did that more than just to see if he could do it he's not playing a game here of Chess checkers hockey trying to find you he does just he's not just not Gathering a church he's not Gathering a click it's not Gathering families he's Gathering a wife [Applause] [Music] a wife that he can place his seed in [Applause] and he's going to give you a word so powerful in this day it'll not be the mind of a man it'll not denominate it will not deteriorate [Applause] and everything Satan will do to try to destroy the message will only elevate it to show us that it's a masterpiece and the people that will eat the book and realize that the book is open to them and they realize that they're the Ruth of this day [Applause] I love that [Applause] if I I can't add anything to that but let me just say this you look at your past so I want to destroy that work right now God doesn't look at your past like you look at your past if you're if you're in the Rahab lineage when Rahab Mary salmon and him being a great a great warrior and a great captain I will guarantee you one thing for sure he never reminded her of where she came from [Applause] once she became his wife he never called her a harlot [Applause] Boaz never reminded Ruth [Applause] of her start passed and the things that she had been under and the oppression I will guarantee you everybody that worked around Boaz dare not say anything about her because she was his wife [Applause] can I take it to a higher level the enemy that is in trouble [Applause] when he torments you and afflicts you and it condemns you and he is our husband [Applause] that enemy will be judged for the things that he has said about you because God don't look at you that way anymore [Applause] Psalms 22. Jesus was in the Tomb he was conquering death hell in the grave to the visible light you couldn't see what was going on but in another realm he was conquering hell [Applause] he was conquering death so you and I wouldn't have to go there God sent him to hell so you and I would not have to go but Psalms 22 said I will not suffer my Holy One to seek corruption [Applause] so in that body corruption could not set into it and you're the reason [Music] you're the reason you were in him [Applause] [Music] now if I can just say this bully if he couldn't corrupt you 2 000 years ago he can't corrupt you now Hallelujah [Music] thank you man [Music] can I say this to you oh what a blood oh what a blood well that's a good starting point in there it feels like it's 10 000 volts of electricity up here now Christ was man of devil and brother Branham says you believe that now I can't explain all of this I I'm just going to go through and just quickly now hit the high place sir you won't have to stay too long Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil ask them is that right you believe that that's why he was what he was God's word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil is that right he was done to do that he was born to be that to destroy The Works of the devil now his body is to do the same thing [Applause] now his body is to do the same thing because the body is the head and the body is together that's right and if Christ is the head what's the word his body has to be the same thing as the head was that's right a church of the word born of the word virgin born from the word not denomination now virgin born from the word the way the body operates is by the heck [Applause] who is that brother Ron look around Satan could not take them he could not drown Noah in the flood until the purpose of God had been finished he could not burn up Hebrew children until the purpose of God has been finished he could not kill job with balls and troubles until the purpose of God has been finished neither could the lions eat Daniel and to the purpose of God has been finished neither could death an old age take Abraham until the purpose of God has been finished and neither can it take you or take me until the purpose of God of our life is finished [Applause] Hallelujah I stand here with zero fear zero fear of where I'm standing in life answer could have took my life it would have taken my life [Applause] but it's going to take a stronger when than this why does God let troubles come God harnesses troubles and put its in the mouth and makes it obey him those troubles bring us closer to Fellowship with God well brother Ron I just feel like I've been a war in my life in the last few weeks it just feels like all Satan's against me well I've got some scripture for you in Revelations chapter 12 and verse 7 and there was war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and Prevail not I love that Prevail not neither was any place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out now do you remember that Satan if you're still here do you remember that that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength in the Kingdom of our God and the and the power of His Christ for the accuser I Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night notice now what we're going to do and they overcame him [Applause] by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony [Applause] I want to read that again and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb let's just say it together and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony brother on but that was written two thousand years ago yep and it's applicable for you today [Applause] now we're going to change this just a moment and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb say it with me and they overcame it by the blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony every one of you are different this isn't a cookie cutter message everybody want me like you or not nor wants to be like you [Laughter] Hallelujah brother Lonnie Jenkins said I always do heart surgery he said brother Ron does heart surgery and smiles while he's cutting your heart out [Music] but every one of you has a book and it's got a lot of chapters in it and there's places where there's blank pages and I have a lot of words in it but the blood took care of that and now the accuser can't find it even to bring it up to God [Applause] Satan hasn't got any legal rights at all over a Christian every time a man gets saved God just writes a whole big bunch of checks like that and puts his name at the bottom and said here they are fill them out are you scared of it fill it out whatever things that you desire When you pray [Applause] a lot of unanswered prayers is unprayed prayers [Applause] and if Satan can get you too busy to pray he knows he can't defeat you with the word but just get you busy just get you pointing at one another but if you remember what you've been called for [Applause] now now let me just say this you he knows that you as a Believer has every legal right to cast him out but I'm a woman yep you guys preached greater sermons a lot of times than men do oh don't get quiet on me now it's not a good time we are all commissioned to cast out Satan [Applause] Jesus knew the prayer power of Prayer he knew with this connection with God and the angels would would stand at his command let me just say this to you you are fortified greater than the president of the United States of America or your primary and listen Our God's not a politician I'm ever amazed that people will gather 80 000 people to gather to hear a bunch of Lies and they don't want to go to church to hear a preacher tell exactly what the truth is but our job is to destroy the works of the devil and we have the authority like brother Branham said that little police officer said he doesn't have the power to stop a bicycle but he walks out there and puts his hand up in that badge on his chest and blows his whistle he said break start screeching let me remind you are you an ambassador of God [Applause] Hallelujah you're an ambassador of God oh my brother Ron if those Saints of the ages would come back in this day but God selected you [Applause] he selected Jew to live in this day and he does not have expectations of you failing [Applause] so you're here for a purpose you're here to destroy the works of the devil and you have a Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil then you're his offsprings and you'll destroy the works of the devil sons and daughters have the same ambition of our father so my declaration to you let's start destroying [Applause] Psalms chapter 91 and verse 1 for those that have known me for a long time know that this is my favorite scriptures he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide Under The Shadow of the Almighty and I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise on pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings Thou shalt trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror thy night nor the arrow that flies by day nor the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor the destruction that wasteth at noon day A thousand shall fall at thy sight and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee Only With Thine Eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou Hast made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come Thy Thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee [Music] to keep thee in all the ways [Applause] now demons know that you have the authority [Music] they know that you have the authority they just hope you don't know [Music] [Applause] demons know that you have the authority they hope you don't know Angelo Dundee probably was the greatest Corner man for any boxer one of the most famous boxers that ever lived in the Earth and I'll share a story with you after I tell you this was Muhammad Ali you made a great statement one time he said I didn't have to tell Muhammad Ali how to fight I just had to remind him of who he was [Music] Ron but that's a boxing story well let me just give you a little brief history here that probably a lot of you don't know I walked out of my hotel room as a young preacher and it was a man standing and he had his foot on the rail Second Story and had his foot on the rail and he was standing there and he was the preacher of the evening services at this large camp meeting I recognized who he was and I just began to talk to him and he turned around to me and he said do you like boxing His Name Was Harold Hildebrand he said I like boxing he said I really like he said I really like the fight I said are you do you have discernment cause I lack a good fight now don't you go get holier than thou cause we're in a real fight when these eyelids open up in the morning and they said I should have died three years ago and I realized I haven't fulfilled God's purpose yet I'm not promised tomorrow so let me just say this you hell is in trouble as long as I got breath in my lungs I'm gonna praise the Lord and I'm not going to stand in front of a people that's a bride of Jesus Christ that is the most powerful people that there is on the Earth and give them some little poetry just to kind of get them to the next service I want to remind you you are the champions of laodicea we will overcome we will have to fight for every of the ground but we will win let's have church Isaiah chapter 40. and verse 29. he giveth power to the faint and to him that has no strength might he increases their strength even to you shall feign and be wearing the young men shall utterly fall fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk in nothing [Applause] First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 58

courage when I Stumble he stumbled he steadies me when I am hurt he heals me when I am broken he mends me when I am blind he leads me when I am hungry he feeds me when I face trials he is with me when I face persecution he Shields me when I face problems he comforts me when I face loss he provides for me when I face death he carries me home he is my God [Applause] I am his and he is mine [Applause] I would like to say Satan you must have forgot who you're fooling with he has a way of underestimating his enemy he can stand there like Goliath and make incredible boasts and God will send him a boy [Applause] create a chamber where it gets so hot and tell even the men that will throw in three Hebrew children they will be consumed by the fire but God has provided a conference and our Prophet would go and look in that Dimension and say wormwood would go before God and said let me go down there and change it I flooded the world I can put the fire out others will come and say let me go down and God himself will say no I've been watching [Music] [Applause] I've been watching I'm gonna go myself and brother randomly said he would call a zigzag lightning to come down to carry him down into the midst of the fire he said God loves us show his power let me remind you you're not alone I don't care what your situation is he's riding on your storm he's standing in the midst of the sea he's right there with you he'll help you walk on water [Music] [Applause] [Music] maybe you quite questions in your heart tonight I want to remind you who got you here [Music] who got you here who pulled you here who calls you here now if he could watch over you since Adam [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my brother on you don't know what I'm going through don't matter your circumstances are only temporary [Applause] [Music] [Applause] they're very temporary brother Ron but you just don't know what the doctors told me I got a good idea [Music] but before my storm yeah he told me on December the 22nd weeks before the storm would start if you'll trust me I'll use you late never before and people from around the world can see a preacher that has standing maybe we're no other preacher has ever stood lung cancer brain cancer chemo every day no hope by the doctors even told the other day that I'm on a terminal that you know it you know they'll only go so far but I got another doctor I got another doctor I have another report I choose to report readable reports that says I'm Healed so young people when you're going through a trial you may never remember my name but you can remember my story [Applause] yeah are you with me the same God is your god my God your God he's no respecter of persons you may feel like an orphan child you may feel so alone you can't stand yourself seems like you're the only one in the world and the devil is Whispering everything you can in your ear Every dart of hell is against you but let me just say the god that's with you is greater than ever God every devil that fights a good shoe [Applause] none of us have ever had a day like job had none of us The Book of Job is an Incredible Book it shows us what Humanity can go through but a prophet would take us even before job and they begin to explain that that the enemy came before God and God asked him said where you been where you been well I've been searching to and fro in the earth seeking whom I may devour Satan has an ambition to destroy you he would destroy you with a lot of different things and he offers you guys a whole lot of different things he'll offer your jobs he'll offer your relationships you'll offer you a lot of prosperity but it's only temporary I've been going to and fro in the earth seeking whom I may devour and God speaks up and said have you considered my servant job now brother Branham said the reason he would say that's because he'd been fellowshipping with him he fellowship with Abraham and he's fellowship with you and you've had some trials I've had some trials now we don't have trust in your flesh but he has trust in that seed [Applause] your flesh will get the urge to quit your flesh will say I've had enough your flesh will begin to talk the devil's language your flesh will take on spirits but God had confidence in the sea and trial after trial after trial that none of us has said trials like him children wealth animals gone horrific stories in a short manner of time he did not get a letter from heaven saying you're about to go through this he didn't know when God would show up it just kept going but the only thing he knew to trust was God a lot of things even an Unwritten in the Book of Job that you've heard in your ears but when God comes to visit him when it comes down to visit him God doesn't talk about any of his trials he doesn't talk about any of his trials he doesn't talk about how bad is God and how much loss he's had he doesn't talk about how defeated he feels he begins to talk about the Eternal Realm [Applause] he begins to remind him job where was you can I call your name right here where was you when I laid the foundations of the Earth when I put the Zodiac the first Bible into place you represent one of them Stars [Applause] Abraham can you count the Sun to the Sea no you can't count them that's your natural seed can you count the stars of the heaven no way well that's why spiritual seed and Abraham was standing there trial us God's not looking at your circumstances now or help me preach he's not looking at how you feel he's not looking at your critical spirit he's not looking at all the things that you're fighting in your life where was you when I pre-planned you where was you when I built you when I was you when I put my attributes inside of you where was she when I laid your put your name in the book I'll not lose a one I'll not lose someone foreign but I don't know how much longer I'm holding I can hold on you're not the one holding on go ahead Shout I thank God I'm not the one holding on I'd have quit a long time ago I didn't give up a long time ago I was discouraged a long time ago [Music] [Applause] I'm not holding on please holding on to me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] look past your backslidden condition look past your place to where you feel so depressed you can't go on look past that circumstances that are around you look past your troubles look past the things that you can't see through tomorrow [Applause] [Music] I called you I Justified you [Applause] I have glorified you no wonder our Prophet could stand here and preach to people that didn't believe it because he'd seen an eternal Realm [Applause] [Music] [Applause] because a lot of preachers would turn against him and he knew in his own flesh he said I haven't done anything for God his hands behind his head an enemy was talking would you like to look beyond the curtain of time [Applause] [Music] he needed to see more than rejection of humanity [Applause] he needed to see more than a Bootlegger's son [Applause] he needed to see more than a lost wife and a lost daughter he needed to see more than just a little bitty Church he needed to see more than coming to Saskatoon in Edmonton and church is turning against him he needed to see into another Realm [Music] he needed to handle them [Music] Not Just an Illusion but he needed to handle them amen that regardless of tax cases people worshiping him as God his human frailties pulling off his shirt and Mowing and people coming by and feeling condemned God needed to show him an eternal Realm what are these Services about we're not going to be here much longer there's another Realm [Applause] yes God has plans [Music] [Applause] now you remember when I won't be much longer now you remember when God was coming and blew himself a body picked up some elements of the Earth and and then he stepped in because Abraham was now approaching the impossible age [Music] let me let me just talk to you about it God will allow things in your life to let you know that you can't do it on your own [Applause] now he knew Abraham's going to have a son through Sarah but I need to wait to where it's a total impossibility for him to be able to say that I did it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and he had to wait till Sarah became a cranky or woman that was tired of hearing the story so he knew I got to go have a conversation with her now that morning that morning Sarah was in the tent and she was fussing you said brother Ron you're out on a limb no I'm I'm in the message [Applause] and it said she was fussing about you know those Caravans they don't come by here they go down to where lot's wife's at she gets the nicest clothes and she gets the nicest hats and she gets all the nicest things and she was just in a fussy Stewie kind of happens at church sometimes and Jesus is on his way you know a good sign of a meetings when people get fussy and Stewie ah you don't have to hide now I know I'm so On Target it's unbelievable there's pastors all across this building you know what I'm talking about some of your most faithful right-hand people take a knife put it up under your chest and wiggle it around and you've just walked out of the pulpit you know what I'm talking about the devil uses your best friend and so Abraham he believed the promise and so he kept himself in an atmosphere to Abraham he didn't care if he was 200 years old and he was 300 years old I can't figure out how old I'm gonna have to be to get there but I'm going to have a son because God said it [Applause] [Music] that's right and God came you know Abraham wasn't a trinitarian so he he called him Lord [Music] and since the Lord came to the house he wanted to entertain him and he's on a purpose now how he knew was by his voice he couldn't recognize him by his physical being because he had met him as a pillar of fire and walked through the Beast and you heard his voice so many times that now that voice is speaking out of that body he can't explain it all but that's him [Applause] last night he spoke to you through guys almost seven foot tall and you know you you might have felt awkward with the way that he operated for a little while but after a while if you listen long enough you heard you heard him you heard the voice behind The Voice and what he was doing was reminding you who you are and that's what Melchizedek was going to do with Sarah he's going to remind her of who she was because she had forgot who she was [Applause] she's a part of the promise and he asked her a question that I'm going to ask you is anything impossible with God can we fast forward just a little bit Abraham and Sarah it seems that they're going to get out of the will of God it seems and in their trouble they have to lie because when God does a work he does it so well it's just phenomenal he takes an old cranky woman don't get mad he takes an old cranky Church he takes an old cranky people and he makes them so beautiful [Applause] to one of the the greatest kings in the whole world over one of the most powerful Kingdoms in the whole world that can have anybody that he wants and when he sees her [Applause] he's just gotta have her I want you to think now Sarah has a revelation of what God's going to do through her womb she has a revelation now that my womb is going to produce Isaac I'm going to carry Isaac but the devil's always in the details now God allows the devil to be like a tool [Music] okay if I need a wrench I go get a wrench if I need a hammer I go get a hammer if I need a screwdriver I get a screwdriver and the devil is dumb so God's looking at laodicea and there's Abraham and Sarah now turn young again but I got a proof I got to prove I've got to write the book to where that there's going to be a people on the Earth around the world can believe I can turn them back young again because Sarah is the type [Applause] I gotta have a people I'm going to send them a message it's going to be more than Gathering a church and more than seals and more than Thunders and more than but I'm going to take their bodies and it seems like totally impossible but they should be under expectation of a body change mortal is going to become immortal and I'm going to Rapture around the entire world and on Rapture mourning no matter how difficult and how many things that Satan's thrown against him they're going to believe my word so much [Applause] [Music] now you know I just have to admit to you like you're sitting here tonight can I can I just go out on a limb here just for a minute in other kingdoms Castle knowing that in the morning in the morning this king is going to marry me how did I get here how did I come through these situations of life here I can't sleep tomorrow morning I'm going to be another man's wife and it's going to be impossible to perform what the message says now let's go to attempt there's a man with no doubt a fire outside of his tent and he's crying before God God I've messed up I'm down here out of your will it seems not knowing that God wrote the book [Music] he's just being a part of it I'm a I lied I lied yesterday to save my own skin I lied he'd have killed me for her but I lied God you came you told me for 25 years I was going to have a son with her you came and met me about a year ago I never dreamed I'd have my hair colored back I never dreamed my shoulders would be strong again but here I am in my natural Shred God not only met him back up on a hill but now because he needed a people in laodicea to catch the message [Applause] to know that it's not going to be you that gets you there that's right there's things going to be out of your control a lot of times but he's got you in the palm of his hands and let me just say this to you if I can in your most difficult moments you don't realize you're destroying the works of the devil [Applause] we invited brother Kelly Hildebran and sister Myra to come in speak for us three and a half maybe close to four years ago we had difficulty flying the other day three flights became five flights lost luggage I said in blue jeans last night you won't believe from where all the world was watching last night and I was sitting in blue jeans you might have been critical because a lot of people said I look good [Applause] as long as Connie says I look good it don't matter what anybody else is I needed you to relax so I could get you there Brother Kelly's brother flew a different Airline is he here okay your other brother's here I see him over here he's been smiling at me he must like me okay and so you know Kent is that right Kent Kent made it right on time he wasn't even a minute late he was almost early he made it absolutely wrong and you know you were supposed to be there you're supposed to be there you know and so we're getting close to services and earlier in the week the Lord spoke to me and he says now you're going to preach a sermon on don't worry don't worry well you know we're getting close and brother Kelly he's now one day he's now two days he's now three days and you know what he's still coming isn't that crazy yeah isn't that crazy you know more natural human beings just go hey I've had enough I'm going home Kent told me said you know I'll preach for you I never heard him preach we had visitors there I said well the lord gave me a sermon to preach and I'll just take that don't worry I didn't know in a couple of months what was going to be told to me and brother Kelly comes and we pick him up not in the local airport but we pick him up in Washington at a complete different airport than any of us would use and I told the audience the night before I said now you know if you'll remember you know Sarah was all fussy Stewie all kind of circumstances is going on and it was Satan trying to block the visitation so now brother Kelly doesn't realize what he's going through but it's Satan trying to block the visitation and he's got a message that's going to be real for us and so you know what brother Kelly comes and you know we were supposed to have a Sunday morning service he wasn't going to get there in time and so you know we're in the South we just changed it if you don't work to eat in the morning you eat an evening so we're getting a ride a lot of times and so you know brother Kelly we pick him up and he looks wore out as the guy right back here and and you know he's he's a lot older than that guy and not quite 40 years but he's a little bit older than that yeah Maybe 30. you know I take him to my house and he lays down about a half an hour and he insists tomorrow lay down and we get up and we go to church and you know he starts he comes to the pulpit and he starts and he's he said I got a coin I want to give present to brother Ron I'd saw the coin before on his desk thank you and I thought so much of it because there was a man it was a Normandy coin it's a commemorative coin maybe you have some of them but it's got a grain of sand on it just one grain of sand on this coin and it's in a little little nice case and you know I had a man in my church that fought at Normandy and he didn't become a Christian tilling his late 70s near 80. his name was Max was losing his mind he thought he'd been a drunk all of his life he came to church because of a funeral he liked it he liked me I don't know why I bet he liked me and Max had run the shore of Normandy and he when he left the ship the water was already bloody men was running with him and he watched them fall and he said Iran all I knew to do was run and he said I made the sand I was alive and he said I kept running through the sand and I got to the wall and he said I made the wall and he said I stood there beside of the wall and he said why did I make it he said that thought went through my life all those lives probably four decades Plus I don't want to tell you why you made it I want to tell you why you've made it [Music] [Applause] and I was preaching one night and I began to talk to him about a grain of sand you were maybe one of those grains of sand that God told Abraham about and you've been through some Wars and you've been through some turmoil and you didn't think you'd make it and it was up to you you'd have quit and you'd give up but you just kept running yeah you just kept running yeah and when you got to the wall you turned around and you was believing the message with all your heart and you said how did I of all those millions of people how did I see the message Max in the next service he generally said about the fourth row back he was old he didn't have any friends in the world he came to church loved God he went to the restroom in the middle of the service and it was getting now toward the end and I was finishing preaching and I was tired and weary and I walked back and sat down on the on a seat like this and Max walked up and put his hand on my knee and he said last night you answered the question of why I made it to the wall foreign that was Max's last service and he went home to be with the Lord when brother Kelly announced his text we will accept nothing but total victory I want to say this to you let it be ringing in your ears I was sitting there not knowing what was getting ready to happen I went to the doctor can I have just a few more minutes I went to the doctor I thought I had a prostate infection a Mennonite doctor examined spent some time with me and he said Ron I'm getting ready to send you down a dark Road and he sent me for scans well before we would get the results of the scans I had to be at brother biscoll so I was just going to fly by myself because the tickets was too high and so it was just going to be a few days tripping I was going to go and we got a call from Sister Connie's cousin that said you need to be with brother Ron you need to you need to get on the plane and you need to be there because he's going to get some news sister Connie called one of those agents at United I don't know if it was you or not

call from the doctor and he said Ron we have some bad news for you you have a tumor in your lungs and there's multiples of them how you got a kick in the gut but I knew what I was getting ready to preach courage I knew that Satan had tried to block that man setting back there brother Kelly Hildebrandt he had tried to block him for three days from getting to the church tried to block him from telling me we will accept nothing but total victory God knows what your future is God knows what you're about to go through [Applause] amen don't you give up on your lost kids don't you give up I

said that there's more than what we see with our natural eyes in this room and there's another one that's been in this room and that's the enemy that has thrown everything at you and he's been watching this service he's been watching our reaction [Music] brother Darren Boyer we were in Kelowna a couple of years ago and you were speaking that morning and you took the Book of Job and it so spoke to me how God would tell job about Leviathan and he says who can do this but the story was not about what job was going through that's what job saw but he was trying to tell him watch what I'm going to do to the devil through this trial and you will be the Victor over it brother Kelly we spoke just a little over a few weeks ago and we shared this quote and it was precious brother Ron touched on the story of the Hebrew children that were going into the fire [Music] and brother Branham would say this he would say Daniel was the one that was there in that day he was the leader as Christ being the leader of the church but there was Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they were the church and they had to Bow before the image and worship the image but notice Daniel was silent you may have been waiting for God to take away the trial you may have been waiting for God to remove this burden but God has just allowed him to be quiet and the quote goes on to say in those times Daniel was silent oh I hope you get this he says Daniel was silent they had to make their own choice and those Hebrew children their testimony before they went in the fire even if God doesn't Deliver Us we will not bow down we will not serve this enemy I will still praise him I will still give him glory and the devil is watching and I just choose today like brother Ron did when he was sick going to church I'm going to thank the Lord because he's going to make a way through and the devil will be subject to my testimony he will be set to my reaction in this service oh my goodness and while that was going on down there the Angels were starting to rise up look look in Christ that I know God said I know this is not for you I'm gonna come down he's watching the devil's watching but I'm making my choice tonight what choice are you gonna make brother John I don't know if you remember the song I'm not going to let you go do you know that can you do that this is God's determination your flesh might be weak but God nobody put in you you know what you can go through he's not going to let you go let's sing this Mercy said no I'm not gonna let you go I'm not gonna let you slip away you don't have to be
