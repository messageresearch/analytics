[50:55] these meetings just i'm going to take
[50:57] just a few minutes this will be the only
[50:58] time i do this
[50:59] and i just want to say this these
[51:01] meetings
[51:02] were really started years ago by brother
[51:04] harold hildebrandt in 1985. he felt it
[51:07] on his heart
[51:09] to
[51:10] have a missionary convention and we had
[51:12] a number of brothers come from around
[51:14] the world this was at a time when we did
[51:16] not have
[51:18] internet streaming
[51:19] we we couldn't get together and and we
[51:22] would start that as a five-day set of
[51:24] meetings starting on a wednesday would
[51:26] go through and we would have missionary
[51:28] brothers and
[51:29] it was as i was just speaking to the
[51:31] brothers in the back office it was a
[51:33] tremendous time it was a time that was
[51:35] very formative
[51:37] brothers we had friendships we began to
[51:39] meet people it was a real coming
[51:41] together of the bride of christ and that
[51:44] was now 37 years ago
[51:47] and
[51:48] we had regular missionary meetings every
[51:51] three years for a number of years but
[51:53] then in between we had what we called
[51:55] our annual meetings and this is the same
[51:57] time so we're doing that again all these
[52:00] years later
[52:01] and this year we have three speakers
[52:04] and the the elder statesman i'm gonna
[52:07] have to call him that is brother tim
[52:10] pruitt
[52:11] brother brother tim
[52:19] brother tim preached at our meetings in
[52:22] 1988
[52:24] and he made me aware of that and i
[52:25] remembered the message he preached
[52:27] and uh
[52:29] so he was he said i was he was 34 years
[52:32] old at the time
[52:34] and uh that was 34 years ago so
[52:38] if you're good at math you you'd have an
[52:40] idea of how old he is
[52:42] so
[52:44] we want to we just want to say we're we
[52:46] r we're happy to have him back we
[52:48] haven't had
[52:49] up to this year we hadn't had brother
[52:50] tim pruitt here for many years
[52:53] and we were so happy that he came to be
[52:55] a part
[52:56] of the memorial service for brother
[52:58] harold we were blessed by that
[53:00] and prior to him even coming
[53:03] we already had made arrangements for him
[53:05] to be the speaker this year
[53:07] and it had been so many years and we
[53:09] felt it was just good for him
[53:11] to be back in edmonton again
[53:13] the other long-standing fixture i'll
[53:16] call him here is his brother ron spencer
[53:19] he's
[53:28] he's been a part of our meetings for
[53:30] many years
[53:31] he he occupies a big part of our hearts
[53:34] and uh
[53:36] in all the times that he's come here now
[53:38] including
[53:39] other trips other meetings this is his
[53:42] 25th trip to edmonton
[53:45] 25 years
[53:47] welcome home
[53:51] [Music]
[53:54] the last two years we had a
[53:57] uh video a meeting with him he couldn't
[53:59] travel
[54:01] and i would just say
[54:03] uh you know he wasn't sure if he'd ever
[54:05] be back but i'll say this there's
[54:07] nothing like the real deal i i'm happy
[54:10] you're here in in body and presence and
[54:13] we met him at the airport yesterday and
[54:16] his wife sister connie is here
[54:18] and it was so good to see them and and
[54:21] uh brother ron it was just so good to
[54:23] give you a hug and and uh
[54:25] see it and you know the one thing about
[54:27] internet streaming you can't
[54:29] partake of tim horton's coffee
[54:31] uh you can't eat saskatoon berry pie
[54:35] so
[54:36] it's more than just being here in person
[54:38] you got to live it you got to experience
[54:40] it and and and that's just
[54:43] the humorous side of it but but we love
[54:45] brother ron and and we appreciate sister
[54:47] connie being here and we're going to
[54:49] take a little more time with him but
[54:51] when brother tim pruitt accepted our
[54:53] invitation and
[54:55] and
[54:56] since last year when his wife passed
[54:58] brother he's had his son timothy uh
[55:01] travel with him
[55:03] and hearing that he would be
[55:05] here we we thought
[55:08] brother timothy has a gift in his life
[55:11] and
[55:13] you know he he'll be speaking a couple
[55:15] services for us
[55:17] he he'll be speaking a youth meeting
[55:18] that we're going to have saturday
[55:20] afternoon here at the church
[55:21] at 1 30
[55:23] but we also felt we needed to hear him
[55:25] as a congregation
[55:26] so he's going to speak for us tonight
[55:29] and you know when when brother tim was
[55:31] here in 1988 i think brother timothy was
[55:34] only 10 years old at the time
[55:36] and he never knew what he had there but
[55:38] we're so glad and and you know i'd say
[55:40] this he's the opening night speaker
[55:43] but he's not a warm-up act
[55:45] brother timothy is a preacher a man of
[55:48] god and i will just say this to you
[55:51] don't wait
[55:52] for the other services start start
[55:54] tonight just just enter in
[56:02] well we're gathered here and and i would
[56:04] like to just say even though these are
[56:06] regular meetings
[56:07] i'd like to say they're anything but
[56:09] regular
[56:10] it's been two years of covid
[56:13] we are seeing a world that is falling
[56:15] apart
[56:17] we we are seeing spirits that are rising
[56:20] up that are being loosed upon the people
[56:22] we are seeing darkness that is
[56:24] unprecedented
[56:26] and when brother branham would talk
[56:28] about a darkness the bible talks about a
[56:29] gross darkness
[56:31] we are seeing it on on levels that we've
[56:33] never seen it before
[56:35] and in the midst of all of this god has
[56:37] promised that he would raise the
[56:39] standard
[56:40] and i believe what we're just saying
[56:41] about a new testament church i believe
[56:44] that's promised
[56:45] that ephesus that the the alpha would
[56:47] become the omega
[56:49] the ephesian church that fell off
[56:51] would come from where they fell off to
[56:54] finish what god had intended and i
[56:56] believe we're at that point so
[56:58] i i just want to encourage you don't
[57:00] look at it as just regular meetings
[57:03] and
[57:04] this city in the last week
[57:06] has had a large religious gathering
[57:09] and it affected traffic it was much
[57:12] publicized in the media
[57:14] and i would say this meeting has gone
[57:17] relatively unnoticed by those measures
[57:20] but i would also like to say
[57:22] that this meeting
[57:24] i believe that heaven has taken notice
[57:27] i believe that hell has taken notice
[57:30] and i believe that
[57:32] it had it has a greater significance
[57:35] than maybe what the world saw this last
[57:37] week
[57:38] and i would just like to say the god of
[57:40] heaven
[57:41] i believe is here
[57:43] he knows we would be here he knew the
[57:45] time he knew the speakers he knew our
[57:48] situations and i want to encourage you
[57:50] friends
[57:51] let's just look to god in these meetings
[57:54] these brothers as much as i love these
[57:56] brothers as much as i appreciate them
[57:59] these are men of god
[58:01] but
[58:02] beyond the mask there's a gift
[58:05] and i would say we're not looking to
[58:07] just brother ron we're not just looking
[58:09] to brother tim or brother timothy
[58:12] but we're looking to the mighty god
[58:14] and i want you to be reminded if you can
[58:17] we we had a a in this in 1963 a man of
[58:21] god came and
[58:22] announced a series of meetings
[58:25] on the opening of the seven seals
[58:27] and he was he said i can't do it only
[58:30] the lamb can open that
[58:32] and he announced these meetings
[58:33] beforehand and to the very day
[58:36] he didn't even know what he was going to
[58:38] speak
[58:39] but god came on the scene
[58:41] and i say that god is still the god
[58:44] today
[58:45] and i want to encourage you to pull on
[58:47] that god whatever you have need of
[58:50] and i would say there are great needs we
[58:52] are depending on him for these meetings
[58:55] and i don't know how he'll come when
[58:57] he'll come but i believe he'll come
[58:59] because he's been invited
[59:01] so having said all of that i i just want
[59:04] to
[59:04] say we're looking to him
[59:06] and if i can i want to just share this
[59:09] and then i'm going to have we're going
[59:10] to stand and we'll have our brother
[59:12] timothy come but
[59:13] a brother in our in our minister group
[59:16] he shared this
[59:17] prayer of brother branham
[59:19] uh earlier this this this week and i uh
[59:23] i just felt to share it and it would it
[59:25] so spoke to me
[59:27] and i i wanted to just just just bring
[59:29] it to all of you
[59:31] and i'm just i had it and then i i went
[59:33] somewhere else but i've got it now so
[59:35] this is brother branham speaking in a
[59:37] message
[59:38] and uh the message is
[59:41] in in 1965 in january a paradox and i
[59:46] want to just read part of this prayer
[59:48] brother brahms said we'd say and now
[59:50] we're about to approach the word
[59:53] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[59:55] us
[59:56] may it be again lord that the word will
[59:58] become flesh
[1:00:00] that it will pour through thy church
[1:00:03] and thy people
[1:00:05] to fulfill the promises of this hour
[1:00:09] we realize we're in the closing time
[1:00:13] time is running out
[1:00:15] and we're blending in with eternity
[1:00:18] the civilization has traveled from east
[1:00:20] to west there's no place to go father we
[1:00:23] pray heavenly father that this will be a
[1:00:26] great hour for us
[1:00:28] that we may sense the presence of the
[1:00:30] holy spirit the writer of this word back
[1:00:33] in the building of the tabernacle of
[1:00:36] flesh manifesting himself to us
[1:00:39] pardoning our sins
[1:00:40] forgiven our iniquity and the assurance
[1:00:44] he will not impute sin to the believer
[1:00:46] and with the assurance that he would
[1:00:48] heal our infirmities
[1:00:50] take people out of wheelchairs and off
[1:00:52] of crutches
[1:00:54] give them sight them that are blind and
[1:00:57] an extension of days those that are
[1:00:59] dying with horrible diseases like cancer
[1:01:02] and tuberculocar
[1:01:04] advanced diseases that the physicians
[1:01:06] cannot curb
[1:01:08] it's beyond that but god you go beyond
[1:01:11] scientific research
[1:01:13] you go beyond reasoning
[1:01:16] grant to your servants this afternoon
[1:01:19] the speaking and hearing of the word
[1:01:23] and he begins to speak the message a
[1:01:25] paradox
[1:01:26] i believe that same god is real
[1:01:29] i believe he's going to make himself
[1:01:30] known in our midst let's stand together
[1:01:33] we're going to invite our brother
[1:01:34] timothy pruitt
[1:01:36] we're looking for a great time in the
[1:01:37] lord let's pull on the gift

[1:05:01] we're looking for god to do amazing
[1:05:03] things
[1:05:04] because he's an amazing god
[1:05:07] hallelujah
[1:05:08] uh someone that sent me actually brother
[1:05:11] buzzbosia
[1:05:12] from uganda sent me this quote
[1:05:15] earlier this week while we was preparing
[1:05:18] for these meetings and just like to
[1:05:20] read this as we start says
[1:05:22] the reason i like these full gospel
[1:05:24] conventions
[1:05:26] you hear the people cry
[1:05:28] shout
[1:05:30] praise the lord
[1:05:31] because they've come into fellowship
[1:05:33] a divine fellowship of the holy spirit
[1:05:37] he said whenever you get rid of that
[1:05:39] you're going back to babylon you might
[1:05:41] as well bury yourself that's exactly
[1:05:43] right
[1:05:44] but when we get to a place to where we
[1:05:46] get away from that shekinah glory that
[1:05:48] praises of god that fresh anointing and
[1:05:51] breaks down all religious barriers and
[1:05:53] things
[1:05:54] and makes us want in christ jesus it
[1:05:56] frees us from all condemnation
[1:05:58] that's what we need tonight
[1:06:01] that's what the church needs divine
[1:06:03] fellowship
[1:06:04] he said that's what i found in these
[1:06:06] conventions in places where men and
[1:06:09] women they're not ashamed
[1:06:11] they're not ashamed of the gospel
[1:06:13] they're ready to testify they're ready
[1:06:15] to sing about it they're ready to shout
[1:06:17] about it
[1:06:19] hallelujah said i've even heard them
[1:06:20] speak in tongues once in a while i
[1:06:23] believe we can have that kind of
[1:06:24] convention
[1:06:26] amen god bless you today been in much
[1:06:29] prayer for these meetings it's an honor
[1:06:30] to be with you and
[1:06:32] to be ministering of course with two of
[1:06:35] my heroes

[1:09:52] actually a song that was sang one sunday

[1:10:34] amen i want my turn job chapter 5 and
[1:10:37] verse 8

[1:10:41] and unto god would i commit my calls
[1:10:45] which does great things
[1:10:47] and unsearchable
[1:10:49] marvelous things
[1:10:51] without number
[1:10:53] amen we let you be seated
[1:10:58] a god
[1:11:00] who does great things
[1:11:02] unsearchable things
[1:11:04] marvelous things
[1:11:06] but things with that has no number you
[1:11:09] know i read i want to read a quote as we
[1:11:12] start this out when god talked to moses
[1:11:14] brother branham would say this and it's
[1:11:16] a very wonderful statement more than
[1:11:18] just a statement but he said i believe
[1:11:20] that the age has come now
[1:11:23] the miraculous the phenomenal the
[1:11:26] baptism of the spirit
[1:11:28] power signs and wonders this great power
[1:11:32] pouring out of god's spirit in the last
[1:11:35] days
[1:11:36] and he said that's the thing that'll
[1:11:37] bring faith into the people that'll take
[1:11:40] a rapture in faith that'll take the
[1:11:42] church into glory
[1:11:44] but the age has come now amen i believe
[1:11:47] this time to quit putting it off to
[1:11:49] another time or to a time in the past
[1:11:52] but today is the date and that this hour
[1:11:55] is the hour that we are to witness the
[1:11:58] miraculous the phenomenal amen the
[1:12:00] pouring out of god's spirit he said in
[1:12:02] the last days i'll pour out my spirit
[1:12:04] saith the lord signs and wonders the
[1:12:07] great pouring out of god's spirit in the
[1:12:10] last days and that's what has been
[1:12:11] released to this age
[1:12:13] what has been released to this age is
[1:12:15] the phenomenal what has been released to
[1:12:17] this age is the miraculous it is the
[1:12:20] baptism of the holy spirit that's been
[1:12:22] released again as it was on the day of
[1:12:25] pentecost
[1:12:26] just as po as he poured out the
[1:12:28] miraculous in the first age and the
[1:12:31] first exodus and the first signs and the
[1:12:33] first wonders he's also pouring them out
[1:12:36] in this time that we live in now i want
[1:12:38] to look at the exodus because i believe
[1:12:41] we're in another exodus we're in a time
[1:12:44] of leaving here amen it's a time of the
[1:12:46] body change it's the time of the rapture
[1:12:48] it's a time of the cult going home with
[1:12:50] the saints of god so but as we look in
[1:12:53] the time we're living in you want to
[1:12:54] know how god is today you go back and
[1:12:56] see what he was yesterday because what
[1:12:59] he was yesterday he will be again today
[1:13:01] because he is the same yesterday today
[1:13:04] and forever so if you want to see how
[1:13:06] god feels about healing go see what he
[1:13:08] felt 20 years ago 30 years ago 100 years
[1:13:10] ago 2 000 years ago he still feels the
[1:13:13] same way today if you want to see what
[1:13:15] he feels like about
[1:13:17] deliverances or salvation or anything
[1:13:20] that you have a need of if you want to
[1:13:22] know what he feels like or how he his
[1:13:24] attributes are or how he acts go see
[1:13:26] what he did then because he's still the
[1:13:29] same today and so we can see in the
[1:13:31] first exodus as we look amen there was a
[1:13:33] phenomenal thing that was poured out the
[1:13:36] pillar of fire came down amen the the
[1:13:39] prophet began to speak there was a word
[1:13:41] that was spoke amen said let my people
[1:13:44] go and he came and he showed himself
[1:13:46] personally with signs with wonders amen
[1:13:50] in the first exodus now we know again in
[1:13:52] the second exodus says he would take the
[1:13:54] people out of judaism into into the
[1:13:57] baptism of the holy ghost into the word
[1:13:59] of god he would also pour out the
[1:14:01] phenomenal there would be miracles that
[1:14:03] would take place there would be signs
[1:14:04] and wonders there'd be a light that
[1:14:06] would appear on the river jordan it
[1:14:08] would be a word that would go forth and
[1:14:10] say let my people go and in the third
[1:14:13] exodus it's been the same thing it's
[1:14:15] been a repeat amen we have the same
[1:14:17] anointing we have the same pillar of
[1:14:19] fire we have the same word that says let
[1:14:22] my people go
[1:14:23] so if you're under some kind of
[1:14:25] situation today are you under some kind
[1:14:27] of a problem in your life there is a
[1:14:29] word that is hanging over you that says
[1:14:32] let my people go you don't have to stay
[1:14:34] where you're at you don't have to stay
[1:14:36] bound you don't have to say in the
[1:14:38] situation that you are there is a word
[1:14:41] for your deliverance amen if you're
[1:14:43] depressed tonight there is a word for
[1:14:45] your deliverance if you're sick tonight
[1:14:47] there is a word for your deliverance
[1:14:49] whatever you have need of there is a
[1:14:52] word for it and he came and showed
[1:14:54] himself personally now i want you to
[1:14:57] understand that that same pillar of fire
[1:14:59] is still among us even now it is still
[1:15:02] doing the miraculous it is still
[1:15:04] changing lives it is still healing the
[1:15:06] sick it is still raising the dead
[1:15:10] amen we'd be blind as a bat tonight if
[1:15:13] we can say we try to say god doesn't
[1:15:15] still do the miraculous why you have one
[1:15:17] of the greatest miracles sitting right
[1:15:19] here in front of you that the devil has
[1:15:21] tried to kill over and over but god is a
[1:15:24] god of miracles amen he's a god that can
[1:15:27] move away obstacles out of our lives
[1:15:30] many of you no doubt faced obstacles to
[1:15:32] come to this meeting and you wondered
[1:15:34] how it was going to happen but god came
[1:15:36] on the scene for you because he's a god
[1:15:39] of miracles he came to move now we can
[1:15:42] see as brother brown we bring it down in
[1:15:44] the third exodus he would say the holy
[1:15:46] spirit in the form of the pillar of fire
[1:15:48] coming down and manifestations brought
[1:15:51] the first exodus and brought israel out
[1:15:53] of egypt the second exodus was christ
[1:15:56] bringing the church out of judaism the
[1:15:58] third exodus was the same pillar of fire
[1:16:02] takes a bride from the church
[1:16:04] wanted out of the natural what out of
[1:16:06] the spiritual the spiritual out of the
[1:16:09] church what was it he wanted a spiritual
[1:16:11] people to work spiritual things through
[1:16:15] so he had to have a supernatural people
[1:16:17] to believe in the supernatural amen if
[1:16:20] you don't believe in the supernatural
[1:16:21] that means you are not a supernatural
[1:16:23] person but if you have been born of the
[1:16:26] supernatural if you have been born of
[1:16:28] the pillar of fire you will believe the
[1:16:30] very works of god because that life
[1:16:32] lives on the inside of you
[1:16:35] amen if i can have just a little more up
[1:16:37] here amen see god fulfilling his word
[1:16:40] backing it up by the miraculous you say
[1:16:43] well we have the word today wonderful
[1:16:45] but you cannot separate the word from
[1:16:48] the miraculous

[1:16:53] always present
[1:16:55] amen in this generation under the third
[1:16:58] pole it has produced miracles

[1:17:04] in the third pool the third pole that
[1:17:06] we're under amen the miracle working god
[1:17:09] showed us what was in this third pool
[1:17:11] that the dead fish was raised squirrels
[1:17:14] were created storms were spoke out of
[1:17:17] existence tumors were spoke out of
[1:17:19] existence salvation given to hattie
[1:17:21] wright's boys amen nothing but the
[1:17:24] miraculous
[1:17:26] but have you ever noticed they say day
[1:17:28] they say days of miracles are passed
[1:17:30] they're not always saying god can't do
[1:17:32] miracles but the day has passed
[1:17:36] amen the day has passed but listen to
[1:17:38] this he says the day of miracles is not
[1:17:41] passed as the day the theologians say if
[1:17:44] the days of miracles is passed the day
[1:17:47] of god has passed
[1:17:50] god is a miracle
[1:17:52] [Applause]
[1:17:54] he said when was they say when the days
[1:17:56] of miracles were passed he said when the
[1:17:58] days of miracles has passed the day of
[1:18:01] god has passed for god is miracles and
[1:18:04] the days of miracles never will be
[1:18:07] passed
[1:18:10] never was and never will be
[1:18:13] never was and never will be he is a god
[1:18:17] of miracles therefore where he is
[1:18:19] present miracles are present
[1:18:22] where he is present healings is present
[1:18:24] salvation is present amen the holy ghost
[1:18:27] is present the word of god is present
[1:18:30] everything that he is is present
[1:18:33] [Applause]
[1:18:36] amen in the first exodus god called an
[1:18:40] exodus a separation from where they were
[1:18:43] at the present time and god is re making
[1:18:46] ready to fulfill his divine promised
[1:18:48] word that he gave abraham isaac and
[1:18:50] jacob now years had passed since god had
[1:18:53] given a promise
[1:18:55] and it seemed like it was not going to
[1:18:57] happen it seemed impossible
[1:19:00] uh brother branham would even make the
[1:19:01] statement that that exodus seemed more
[1:19:03] impossible than ours does
[1:19:07] he said
[1:19:08] it seemed so impossible that 400 years
[1:19:11] had went by and there seemed to be no
[1:19:14] hope here they were slaves now here they
[1:19:17] were in bad situation there seemed to be
[1:19:19] no way out he said in but in the season
[1:19:22] the due time god will always make his
[1:19:26] promise right
[1:19:29] so whatever you're holding on to tonight
[1:19:31] don't give up on it
[1:19:33] amen it hasn't been 400 years yet amen
[1:19:36] it may have been 20 years 40 years
[1:19:38] whatever it is two years
[1:19:40] don't ever give up on it because he will
[1:19:42] bring it to pass
[1:19:45] he will fulfill his word
[1:19:51] you can rest assured that what god has
[1:19:54] promised he's going to do it
[1:19:58] that gives me a great hope tonight
[1:20:00] because he promised a body change
[1:20:03] it may look impossible but he said it
[1:20:06] was going to happen and he's going to
[1:20:08] bring it to pass
[1:20:09] [Applause]
[1:20:11] he's going to do it don't need to try to
[1:20:13] think anything else well maybe the
[1:20:15] prophet was wrong or maybe it couldn't
[1:20:17] maybe it could happen in this day looked
[1:20:20] at almost impossible then he said more
[1:20:22] impossible than it does now but god did
[1:20:25] it anyhow

[1:24:24] what's the greatest miracle that could
[1:24:25] ever take place
[1:24:27] is a spiritual cancer that's in somebody
[1:24:30] and it's eating their soul up to where
[1:24:32] they can't even fellowship no more and
[1:24:34] they can't be around people
[1:24:37] and they got unforgiveness in their
[1:24:38] heart
[1:24:40] hey man that's the worst kind of cancer
[1:24:42] there is is unforgiveness
[1:24:44] grudges and things they want to hold and
[1:24:47] they want to hold on to and they won't
[1:24:48] let things go from 20 years ago let it
[1:24:50] go
[1:24:54] you say you say well what what
[1:24:57] if i'd let it go

[1:25:51] drug to put in their arms maybe 90 i
[1:25:54] don't know what percentage you can say

[1:25:59] neither does anybody else
[1:26:02] but they'll line up for it and it's got
[1:26:04] side effects
[1:26:06] and it has issues and it causes all
[1:26:08] things and they're because you know why
[1:26:10] they're doing it and i'm not trying to
[1:26:11] get political here but we're here and
[1:26:12] we're just going to go this first
[1:26:13] service
[1:26:18] you know while they're doing it because
[1:26:19] they're scared of a disease
[1:26:21] that you have about a 99 point something
[1:26:23] percent a chance of surviving
[1:26:31] something don't compute
[1:26:35] and that's where they're at
[1:26:37] and they're scared to death of it fear
[1:26:38] is taking over people's lives
[1:26:41] and it ain't just out there it's taking
[1:26:43] over people's lives in the church house
[1:26:46] all of a sudden social distance became a
[1:26:48] word it became something that we and
[1:26:50] began not not even realizing they began
[1:26:53] to social distance themselves not just
[1:26:55] from people but from god
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:01] amen and they they they line up because
[1:27:03] of their fear and they got a 99 whatever
[1:27:06] percent chance of surviving and i'm not
[1:27:08] making light of it my wife had a bad
[1:27:10] case of it spending yeah
[1:27:12] weeks in the hospital
[1:27:14] came very close to death amen but listen
[1:27:17] i got there's something out there that's
[1:27:19] worse than covet
[1:27:21] it's called the layout to see and flu
[1:27:23] [Applause]
[1:27:25] it's got a 100 percent kill rate
[1:27:28] [Applause]
[1:27:30] it's got a hundred percent of taking
[1:27:33] good boys and good girls straight to
[1:27:35] hell
[1:27:38] but there is an inoculation for it
[1:27:42] there is something that you can take
[1:27:44] that'll inoculate from you from there to
[1:27:47] seal and you won't be pulled down by it
[1:27:49] no more and you won't be bothered by its
[1:27:51] creeds and his dress codes and all the
[1:27:54] things that goes with it because you
[1:27:56] have been inoculated
[1:27:58] [Applause]
[1:28:04] people need to have more fear about
[1:28:05] something that's a 100 percent death
[1:28:07] rate
[1:28:08] but they twiddle their thumbs and
[1:28:10] whistle in the graveyard like nothing's
[1:28:11] going on and here we are at the cusp of
[1:28:14] the rapture
[1:28:18] hallelujah that's all free
[1:28:21] he said i don't mean to say he said
[1:28:23] people began to reason he said i don't
[1:28:24] mean to say a man with a fine education
[1:28:27] and a strong mind that man can't
[1:28:29] understand it that's all right wonderful
[1:28:30] as long as he uses that to not to reason
[1:28:35] but he uses it to believe god
[1:28:43] he said when a man tries to reason it
[1:28:45] couldn't be done that drives him away
[1:28:47] from god constantly all the time when
[1:28:50] he's trying to listen to his own
[1:28:51] understanding if if you don't understand
[1:28:54] the bible says a certain thing just
[1:28:56] punctuated with an amen and let it go
[1:28:59] like that
[1:29:01] we don't have to understand everything
[1:29:03] but you got to believe what he said
[1:29:07] we get this idea of in the time that
[1:29:09] we're living in that we got to know
[1:29:10] everything we got such a world of
[1:29:12] knowledge and we got to know it listen
[1:29:14] with god you're not going to ever know
[1:29:16] everything you're not going to know why
[1:29:18] you're not going to know how come you're
[1:29:19] not going to know all the questions but
[1:29:21] the deal you've got to do is i believe
[1:29:24] it
[1:29:24] [Applause]
[1:29:26] i believe what he said
[1:29:34] the first exodus
[1:29:36] he said why were they down in egypt to
[1:29:37] begin with
[1:29:39] why would god's people be out of the
[1:29:41] land that god had promised them
[1:29:44] god had promised them at the beginning
[1:29:46] with abraham and isaac and jacob and god
[1:29:49] give them that land and said this is it
[1:29:51] why would people not be in the place god
[1:29:54] has provided them
[1:29:56] brother branham says this in right there
[1:29:58] he said that's the question of today
[1:30:00] also he said god give us a pentecost he
[1:30:04] give us a book of acts he give us the
[1:30:06] holy spirit to lead and guide us he give
[1:30:09] us a land why are we out of it
[1:30:14] why is the church out of it why is a
[1:30:16] great christian church today living why
[1:30:19] isn't it living again like it was in the
[1:30:22] book of acts
[1:30:23] bringing forth the same thing there's
[1:30:25] some reason for it
[1:30:31] they went down to egypt
[1:30:33] all because of the jealousy of a brother
[1:30:38] that's the reason is israel was in egypt
[1:30:40] at that time and out of the land
[1:30:42] remember god promises it was only as
[1:30:45] long as they stayed in the land now they
[1:30:48] have a physical land we have a spiritual
[1:30:50] land our promises belong in that land
[1:30:56] but he was taken from his brothers
[1:30:57] because he was spiritual joseph he was a
[1:31:00] great man maybe and lay you know humble
[1:31:02] but great man and they hated him without
[1:31:05] a cause
[1:31:06] they should have respected him
[1:31:10] but they hated him why because he was a
[1:31:13] brother
[1:31:15] he was somebody that they thought well
[1:31:17] surely if god was going to use somebody
[1:31:19] they wouldn't use my brother
[1:31:22] you know it's it it's real hard to get
[1:31:24] behind behind beyond all this veil
[1:31:27] called humanity
[1:31:28] we're good about getting beyond our own
[1:31:30] veil but other people's veil
[1:31:36] we're good about seeing god in ourselves
[1:31:38] you know and we oh i see god i see god
[1:31:41] but then god comes and he begins to
[1:31:42] preach and speak to you and he steps on
[1:31:44] our toes well that couldn't be god
[1:31:47] somebody had to tell him that
[1:31:52] somebody must have told him that what
[1:31:54] i've been doing and what i've been yes
[1:31:56] somebody has it's called the angel of
[1:31:59] god that's been in your bed chamber
[1:32:08] my dad always said it like this he said
[1:32:10] you know if people are going to believe
[1:32:12] that i sit there and tell
[1:32:14] other ministers what to preach and well
[1:32:15] i got this problem in my church and if
[1:32:17] you minister on this that'll help and if
[1:32:19] you go down this road that'll help and
[1:32:20] he said they'll believe all that they'll
[1:32:22] believe also i paid him extra money to
[1:32:24] do it
[1:32:30] all of a sudden it becomes not god
[1:32:31] anymore
[1:32:34] well somebody told him what i was doing
[1:32:36] listen
[1:32:37] we ought to know by now by bible readers
[1:32:40] that god knows what goes on in your
[1:32:42] house
[1:32:43] he knows what god amen what was it there
[1:32:45] was a prophet in the land that was
[1:32:46] telling the king of israel what was
[1:32:48] being said in this kingdom of syria's
[1:32:50] bed chamber
[1:32:51] god knows what you're doing he knows
[1:32:53] where you're at he knows if you're real
[1:32:55] he knows if you're not he knows where
[1:32:58] you're up or where you're down he knows
[1:32:59] all about you
[1:33:00] [Applause]
[1:33:03] he knows you more than your pastor knows
[1:33:05] you
[1:33:12] he had god had given this man spiritual
[1:33:14] understanding he could interpret dreams
[1:33:17] he could foretell what would come to
[1:33:19] pass
[1:33:20] and and he didn't pull no punches
[1:33:23] he saw the dream of those sheaves bowing
[1:33:25] before his sheep and his brothers got
[1:33:27] angry with him said well i guess then
[1:33:28] you little holy rover we'll bow down
[1:33:31] before you someday that's and that's the
[1:33:33] way it happened
[1:33:35] how those big giants ever bow down for
[1:33:37] that little insignificant fella but they
[1:33:39] did it they sure did and pleaded for
[1:33:41] mercy but he hadn't come into power yet
[1:33:43] you see he was only their brother
[1:33:47] just only brother so and so it's only
[1:33:49] sister so and so but when we find out by
[1:33:51] doing this joseph was taken and he was
[1:33:53] sold into egypt and and he went down
[1:33:56] there and he said see what was happening
[1:33:59] he said we realize as long as they dwelt
[1:34:02] in the dwelling place
[1:34:04] and the spirit of god would move
[1:34:08] he said that's a good thing stay in that
[1:34:11] place
[1:34:14] he said but when they moved they got rid
[1:34:17] of the spirit
[1:34:21] the funny and it goes on the
[1:34:22] fundamentals that they positionally know
[1:34:25] where they are by intellectual
[1:34:27] conception of the bible but there's no
[1:34:29] spirit
[1:34:31] they rejected joseph they turned him out
[1:34:33] they don't want nothing to do with him
[1:34:35] because that's just a bunch of holy
[1:34:36] rollers we don't want nothing to do with
[1:34:38] it and they excommunicate him and sold
[1:34:40] him out to the world and he they wanted
[1:34:43] him out of their fellowship
[1:34:48] he said the story of this these jealous
[1:34:51] brothers is certainly a great comparison
[1:34:53] with the spiritual side of it today
[1:34:55] we're all aware of it that's pure
[1:34:57] jealousy
[1:34:59] he said not pure it's old dirty filthy
[1:35:02] jealousy
[1:35:04] there's no purity and jealousy there's
[1:35:06] nothing but filthy jealousy when we see
[1:35:09] the same bible the same nature of god
[1:35:11] that wrote the bible vindicated and
[1:35:13] turned that down without reason that's
[1:35:15] not pure that's dirty jealousy
[1:35:19] you watch god heal the sick you watch
[1:35:22] god raise the dead and that same god
[1:35:24] that lived in the days of the apostles
[1:35:26] the same god that they wrote about him
[1:35:28] the same god that was in their spiritual
[1:35:30] journey it's doing the same thing today
[1:35:33] and they're jealous of it
[1:35:35] and they excommunicate it and they run
[1:35:37] them off
[1:35:40] he said that brother thought well we'll
[1:35:42] never have a use for him but brother
[1:35:44] like this why not get rid of him he said
[1:35:46] that's what the same thing has happened
[1:35:47] today they think because our churches
[1:35:50] have become intellectual
[1:35:53] we got the best dressed crowds we got
[1:35:55] the biggest organization we got the
[1:35:57] smartest ministers
[1:35:59] that we have no use of the holy spirit
[1:36:02] in the way that it was back there
[1:36:06] uh-oh
[1:36:08] and in other words actions speak louder
[1:36:10] than words they're seminaries
[1:36:13] they're they're they're they're coming
[1:36:14] together and discussing things and are
[1:36:17] more able
[1:36:18] with more of their own intellectual
[1:36:20] minds to set the church in order and
[1:36:22] it's better than what the holy spirit
[1:36:24] can do
[1:36:27] so they don't need the holy spirit no
[1:36:29] longer it's something that we don't need
[1:36:31] today the days of that is past
[1:36:38] don't need the holy spirit this is a
[1:36:39] direct quote we don't need the holy
[1:36:41] spirit to heal the sick we've got
[1:36:43] doctors we don't need the holy spirit to
[1:36:44] speak in tongues we're all intellectual
[1:36:47] people and when you take that out from
[1:36:50] your framework you've taken the lifeline
[1:36:56] you've taken the lifeline jesus said it
[1:36:59] to the jews the stone that was rejected
[1:37:02] as a chief cornerstone you see what i
[1:37:04] mean he said see you have taken the
[1:37:07] spirit of god out and you adopted some
[1:37:09] man-made system to take the place of the
[1:37:12] holy ghost
[1:37:15] therefore there is a people that's
[1:37:17] elected
[1:37:18] that has their names on the book of life
[1:37:20] they will never go for that
[1:37:25] i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so
[1:37:29] glad that i can say i'm one of them
[1:37:31] there's people whose names are on the
[1:37:34] blam's book of life they can't go for
[1:37:37] that
[1:37:37] [Applause]
[1:37:39] they are spiritually minded therefore
[1:37:41] they'll never go for it they can't stand
[1:37:43] it no matter if their father leaves
[1:37:45] their mother leaves whatever they won't
[1:37:48] stand for it
[1:37:56] he said they may not speak that right
[1:37:58] out like that but their actions prove it
[1:38:00] the holy spirit proves is amongst those
[1:38:03] when he gets them gathered together that
[1:38:05] he still heals the sick
[1:38:07] he still raises the dead
[1:38:09] he still speaks with tongues he still
[1:38:12] cast out devils
[1:38:16] but the church feels that it don't need
[1:38:18] the holy spirit the church will tell you
[1:38:20] that and men can stand up and give you
[1:38:22] such an intellectual talk it'll make you
[1:38:25] almost believe it
[1:38:28] didn't jesus say the two would be so
[1:38:30] close together it would deceive the very
[1:38:33] elected if it's possible the
[1:38:34] intellectual talks would be so smooth it
[1:38:37] would deceive people it's gospel it's
[1:38:39] men who can handle the word in such a
[1:38:41] way they'll make almost any intellectual
[1:38:43] person if you're trusting in their
[1:38:44] intellectuals they would condemn the
[1:38:46] holy spirit and take it away of men
[1:38:50] take the way of men he said that's the
[1:38:52] same thing they thought about joseph
[1:38:53] they got rid of him and down into egypt
[1:38:56] how we think oh my he says down in egypt
[1:38:58] they went
[1:39:01] he said
[1:39:02] you could stay here for three years and
[1:39:04] never leave that subject day and night
[1:39:06] and still be finding the great kernels
[1:39:08] of the holy spirit
[1:39:10] the spiritual mind can look down in
[1:39:12] egypt and see that persecution rise can
[1:39:15] see joseph taken away in order that that
[1:39:17] persecution could arise and see god with
[1:39:20] his wills and the wheels everything
[1:39:21] moving perfectly see potiphar see all of
[1:39:24] the things taking place he said how we
[1:39:26] can see that the church has cut as we
[1:39:28] can realize we have been positionally
[1:39:31] placed in a land don't leave the land
[1:39:35] [Applause]
[1:39:37] this is the land of the holy ghost
[1:39:40] this is the land of divine healing
[1:39:44] amen in this there is prayer lines in
[1:39:47] this there is altar calls in this there
[1:39:49] is land hold hands on the sick
[1:39:52] and they shall recover
[1:39:56] don't leave the land
[1:40:02] god told moses said you go and i'll send
[1:40:04] an angel before you and he's going to
[1:40:06] keep you in the way and bring in the
[1:40:07] place i've prepared beware of him obey
[1:40:10] his voice for he will not pardon your
[1:40:11] transgression for my name is in him the
[1:40:14] angel was the angel of the covenant
[1:40:16] which was christ jesus the people many
[1:40:18] of them did not believe it those who did
[1:40:20] not believe perished
[1:40:24] those who did not believe went those who
[1:40:26] did believe went on into the promised
[1:40:28] land and the men who reject light went
[1:40:31] into total darkness
[1:40:33] i believe today that those who reject
[1:40:35] the holy spirit the light of god and the
[1:40:38] days of miracles and so forth will go
[1:40:41] out into total darkness
[1:40:47] because they are rejecting the very
[1:40:49] light giver
[1:40:52] calling it just emotions
[1:40:55] calling it all kind of dirty names
[1:40:57] calling it well that's just pentecostal
[1:41:01] i agree i am pentecostal
[1:41:04] but i have you to know i've never been
[1:41:06] in a pentecostal denominational church
[1:41:08] never preached in one never saying one
[1:41:10] as far as i know never been in one of
[1:41:12] their services i don't know how they act
[1:41:14] i don't know nothing about them but i do
[1:41:16] know i have witnessed the same pillar of
[1:41:18] fire that fell 2 000 years ago on the
[1:41:21] day of pentecost
[1:41:23] [Applause]
[1:41:25] and i know what it does it'll change
[1:41:27] your life forever
[1:41:29] [Applause]
[1:41:32] listen it still has the same effect on
[1:41:34] your life if you receive it it'll do to
[1:41:37] you what it did to them
[1:41:39] because it's the same god with the same
[1:41:42] works on the same side and the same
[1:41:44] wonders moving among his people
[1:41:50] when they reject the light they reject
[1:41:52] the holy ghost they reject the movement
[1:41:54] of the spirit they reject the miracle
[1:41:56] worker
[1:41:58] the very one that can heal them the very
[1:42:01] one that can deliver them the very one
[1:42:03] that can set them free they don't want
[1:42:05] nothing to do with it
[1:42:11] you know it was a story
[1:42:13] an event brother branham had
[1:42:16] as he was at night got lost turned
[1:42:18] around in the woods
[1:42:19] on his horse
[1:42:20] and he came up to this old burn over
[1:42:24] he said it was a moonlit night and it
[1:42:25] was pretty spooky
[1:42:26] place plus a place like that's pretty
[1:42:29] spooky i'd say even in daylight
[1:42:31] but at night it makes things worse
[1:42:33] it's pretty spooky
[1:42:36] winds were beginning to blow and he'd
[1:42:37] hear this mournful sound
[1:42:40] i heard it myself me and brother baker
[1:42:42] doug baker went up on
[1:42:44] on the edge of tucson up to the mount
[1:42:46] lemmon
[1:42:47] we sat on the top of that mountain they
[1:42:48] had a fire
[1:42:50] uh maybe the year before
[1:42:51] it was burnt over down below us and that
[1:42:53] wind began to come up up that mountain
[1:42:56] you hear those sounds in the more dead
[1:42:58] trees
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:06] creaking and
[1:43:07] carrying on because they're dead
[1:43:13] brother brown said that was a spooky
[1:43:15] place he said but i began to notice as
[1:43:16] that wind blows underneath those trees
[1:43:19] with some little leaves that were
[1:43:20] frolicking around
[1:43:22] you see that new growth that was coming
[1:43:23] up
[1:43:24] and he said it put me in mind of a good
[1:43:26] old-fashioned god sent holy ghost
[1:43:28] revival
[1:43:29] [Applause]
[1:43:32] he said he said in one place you can
[1:43:34] look it up he said there was it was
[1:43:35] wonderful and
[1:43:37] there was those under there there was
[1:43:38] frolicking there was those above it that
[1:43:39] was moaning same wind
[1:43:45] [Applause]
[1:43:47] hey man the same thing happens in the
[1:43:49] church that when the holy ghost to come
[1:43:51] it'll make some moan and it makes them
[1:43:53] shout
[1:43:55] it'll make some pouty to make some smile
[1:43:57] it'll make some sad or make some happy
[1:44:00] it'll make some jad dance and be joyful
[1:44:02] in the things of god it'll make other
[1:44:05] sours they can be
[1:44:07] [Applause]
[1:44:09] amen he said it makes me think of a

[1:44:14] and wonders begin to come into the
[1:44:16] church those big old trees those old

[1:44:21] that's fanaticism that's the days of
[1:44:24] miracles are passed the wind whistling
[1:44:26] down the same one that made the moan has
[1:44:28] given the others a good frolic
[1:44:31] [Applause]
[1:44:32] he said when you shook that tree every
[1:44:34] time he gets to shake it it loosens up
[1:44:36] the roots so it can grow down and get a
[1:44:38] better hold hallelujah that's what we
[1:44:40] need tonight
[1:44:43] it's a good old time holy ghost shaking
[1:44:46] get down to glory to god get an
[1:44:48] old-fashioned hold on god shaking and
[1:44:50] pulling the holy ghost does to you he's
[1:44:52] loosening up that dirt around you
[1:44:55] so you can put your roots down he said
[1:44:57] them experiences experiences of healing
[1:45:00] experiences of baptism the holy ghost
[1:45:02] experiences the gifts of the spirit just
[1:45:05] anchors you in christ
[1:45:07] [Applause]
[1:45:09] and the harder it blows the harder you
[1:45:11] can hold
[1:45:13] and you can look right into the winds of
[1:45:15] laodicea and say it's going to take a
[1:45:17] stronger win than this
[1:45:20] it's going to take something more than
[1:45:21] you got because you ain't got enough
[1:45:28] hallelujah let me tell you something
[1:45:30] right now if the devil would have had
[1:45:32] enough he'd have used all he had to keep
[1:45:33] ron spencer from being here this weekend
[1:45:35] but apparently he ain't got enough
[1:45:39] amen if the devil had enough he'd have
[1:45:41] kept you from being here but he didn't
[1:45:43] have enough
[1:45:47] hallelujah some of you need to look at
[1:45:49] devil and i'd say devil you don't have
[1:45:51] enough
[1:45:54] because greater is he that's in me than
[1:45:56] he that's in the world you don't have
[1:45:58] enough i'm still here
[1:46:04] hallelujah amen depression has tried to
[1:46:07] destroy you anxiety and fear is trying
[1:46:09] to tear you down but he didn't have
[1:46:11] enough
[1:46:12] [Applause]
[1:46:13] family troubles trying to split you
[1:46:15] apart but he didn't have enough
[1:46:26] because if he had enough he'd bring
[1:46:27] enough
[1:46:32] i mean that's the way i look at it
[1:46:34] if a guy was going to try my arm he was
[1:46:36] going to try to stop another army it's
[1:46:37] going to try to be bigger than what the
[1:46:39] army is facing
[1:46:40] going to have enough to stop them
[1:46:43] right
[1:46:44] i mean that's logical thinking
[1:46:49] brother branham there and now
[1:46:50] them lapping hill with them lapping
[1:46:52] rocks on those hills and that little boy
[1:46:53] had been in a vision being raised from
[1:46:55] the dead
[1:46:58] so when he saw what was taking place
[1:47:00] he turned around and he saw where he was
[1:47:01] at he said you can line every devil up
[1:47:05] they don't have
[1:47:06] enough
[1:47:08] because this is the time for the
[1:47:10] phenomenal the miraculous
[1:47:12] this is time for the vision to be
[1:47:14] fulfilled
[1:47:15] or church of the living god this is time
[1:47:18] for the vision that is solved to be
[1:47:20] fulfilled of that bride marching in step
[1:47:23] on with christian soldiers and she
[1:47:25] started to rise up
[1:47:29] she started to rise up
[1:47:31] oh come on now this is where we're at
[1:47:34] we're not going down into death we're
[1:47:36] not going down to and make another
[1:47:38] denomination we're not going back down
[1:47:40] to creeds and domes but we're rising up
[1:47:43] we're rising up and we're going to rise
[1:47:46] up over every devil in hell he's under
[1:47:48] my feet
[1:47:50] he's under my fridge
[1:47:54] he's under my feet
[1:47:56] why because god put him there
[1:48:00] i'm gonna say this right now if the
[1:48:01] devil is not under your feet he's out of
[1:48:04] his place
[1:48:07] hallelujah that's where he belongs
[1:48:10] [Applause]
[1:48:17] hallelujah
[1:48:18] he said let the church squeak and moan
[1:48:22] if you want to moan tonight go ahead
[1:48:24] moan
[1:48:26] you want to say days of miracles or past
[1:48:28] suit yourself
[1:48:30] you're dead anyhow
[1:48:33] reading a quote
[1:48:36] well we're a church
[1:48:38] those were trees
[1:48:44] but look at them no bark was on them
[1:48:47] blistered
[1:48:49] all the bark done been burned off
[1:48:51] they couldn't pack the life up no more
[1:48:53] if them trees had bark on them they'd
[1:48:55] packed the life to live again but all
[1:48:57] the bark had been stripped off
[1:48:59] all the maiden rituals and so forth and
[1:49:01] all the bark was taking place but now
[1:49:03] nothing they could do but squeak and
[1:49:04] squawk
[1:49:06] when the winds blew
[1:49:08] but god sent his wind just the same
[1:49:11] [Applause]
[1:49:13] i want you to understand something you
[1:49:14] come here to try to stop a move of god
[1:49:16] you might as well get out of the way
[1:49:19] because of when god wants to sin this
[1:49:21] will and god wants to send the power of
[1:49:23] the holy ghost through a building there
[1:49:25] ain't nothing you can do to stop it
[1:49:29] [Music]
[1:49:31] he'll send his win just the same and
[1:49:34] this little bitty church coming up this
[1:49:35] little handful was having himself a big
[1:49:38] time while the rest of them was carrying
[1:49:39] on with their moaning and groaning he
[1:49:41] said that's what we need it's god's
[1:49:43] power in the church but see satan is
[1:49:46] trying to keep us looking at a day gone
[1:49:48] or a day in the future
[1:49:52] but the time is now
[1:49:55] when you realize the time is now satan
[1:49:58] can't stop it

[1:54:55] uh the israel lights a bunch of dirty
[1:54:56] names

[1:55:05] me 40 days he came out
[1:55:08] could you imagine 40 days of listening
[1:55:10] to this nonsense
[1:55:15] but on that 40th day
[1:55:17] one morning
[1:55:19] this father told his young son said hey
[1:55:21] david go down to the camp and see what's
[1:55:23] going on take some bread and take some
[1:55:24] things to your brothers and bring me
[1:55:26] back a report
[1:55:28] so david comes down there
[1:55:30] and he goes down to the camp and as he
[1:55:32] walks in and hears this challenge
[1:55:37] and he notices as the giant makes his
[1:55:40] challenge everybody runs back into their
[1:55:42] tent
[1:55:46] danny steven said it like this and i
[1:55:47] like it i'm gonna borrow it he said they
[1:55:48] ran into their tent to pull up their
[1:55:50] laptop see if they'd find a quote about
[1:55:51] it
[1:56:00] but david came down with experience
[1:56:03] [Applause]
[1:56:04] he doesn't met the god
[1:56:07] he doesn't met the god of elijah
[1:56:10] he don't met him for himself
[1:56:12] amen and he goes he goes there and he he
[1:56:15] hears this challenge and brother said
[1:56:17] what happened he said on that 40th day
[1:56:19] there happened to be a different set of
[1:56:21] ears in the camp
[1:56:24] somebody that hadn't been there the
[1:56:26] previous 39 days happened to be there on
[1:56:29] that 40th day and one time was enough
[1:56:32] one time was all david wanted to hear he
[1:56:35] said who's this uncircumcised philistine
[1:56:37] that wants to challenge the armies of
[1:56:39] the living god send me i'll go fight him
[1:56:43] i'll take his head off
[1:56:45] now can you imagine that
[1:56:47] for 39 days had got up and fixed his
[1:56:50] breakfast
[1:56:51] he had got up and put on his armor he
[1:56:54] had got up and shined his shoes he'd got
[1:56:56] up and put on every piece of equipment
[1:56:58] that he needed he had ate his eggs he'd
[1:57:00] ate his toast whatever he'd done
[1:57:01] probably 12 eggs and about 14 pieces of
[1:57:03] toast
[1:57:04] he'd done all of that
[1:57:06] but this on this 40th day
[1:57:09] i like this
[1:57:10] it was his last day
[1:57:12] [Music]
[1:57:13] it was his last day to get up and put
[1:57:15] his shoes on it was his last days to put
[1:57:17] his armor on it was his last days to
[1:57:20] buckle up his chest my his chest
[1:57:22] protectors and all put it it was his
[1:57:23] last time to slide that helmet over that
[1:57:26] big ugly head it was his last time to
[1:57:28] say let's go out and let's make our
[1:57:30] challenge it was his last day
[1:57:34] [Applause]
[1:57:36] because a young boy who had met the god
[1:57:39] of miracles knew he wasn't just a god of
[1:57:41] miracles years ago but he had
[1:57:43] experienced him for himself
[1:57:46] he had saw him in the line with he
[1:57:48] fought the line he'd saw him when he
[1:57:50] fought the bear and he said this giant
[1:57:52] will be just like those
[1:57:54] dead
[1:58:02] paul said uh saul said let me tell you
[1:58:04] let me let me put you some armor on
[1:58:06] no no david

[1:58:17] i don't need your intellectual speeches
[1:58:19] i don't need your man-made protection i
[1:58:22] need the god of elijah
[1:58:24] [Applause]
[1:58:25] and he pulls it all off and he reaches
[1:58:27] down and he gets his little sling shot
[1:58:30] and he want i actually got to walk down
[1:58:31] that same valley and i picked me up five
[1:58:33] stones
[1:58:36] and i looked down and i grabbed me some
[1:58:37] good giant killers
[1:58:39] got them sitting on my desk there at
[1:58:41] church just in case a giant ever shows
[1:58:44] up

[1:59:12] that'll kill him he puts him in his bag
[1:59:14] and he goes and he takes his head off
[1:59:16] why because he said this is the day

[1:59:37] joy for everything that you have need of

[2:00:44] around i thought this was very awesome
[2:00:46] he turns around
[2:00:48] and he's walking back with jairus

[2:00:52] comes from jairus house
[2:00:56] he says she's dead
[2:00:59] jesus said i'll go razor
[2:01:01] and they're walking to jairus house and
[2:01:03] in the middle of walking the jairus
[2:01:05] house there's this little woman with a
[2:01:07] blood issue
[2:01:09] now he's going to another house
[2:01:11] but she says this is my day
[2:01:19] you might see him going to another pew

[2:01:23] but if you'll say this is my day

[2:01:27] this is my time to get to it and she had
[2:01:29] to get through all kinds of situations
[2:01:32] this is my turn if i can only touch the
[2:01:35] hem of his garments i will be made whole
[2:01:40] brother venom said she had all kind of
[2:01:42] obstacles to face and to fight through
[2:01:44] and every kind of thing that said it

[2:22:28] he said today i'm going to cut your head
[2:22:31] off
[2:22:32] that's our god by grace in that crucial
[2:22:35] moment when decisions needed to be made
[2:22:37] the same god that produced the grace in
[2:22:40] that day and dropped the seed of faith
[2:22:42] and that little boy
[2:22:44] that same god in this crucial moment
[2:22:48] can take a woman from a wheelchair a
[2:22:51] little a little girl out of a bad
[2:22:52] situation he said if it's revealed to
[2:22:55] you i don't care how long it takes
[2:22:59] [Applause]
[2:23:07] but you got to remember
[2:23:13] it's your moment
[2:23:16] it's your time as we look to bring this
[2:23:19] down
[2:23:22] the greatest miracle
[2:23:26] he said well there's a lot of miracles
[2:23:28] brother timothy
[2:23:29] the greatest miracle
[2:23:32] that god has ever performed
[2:23:35] is when he took a sinner
[2:23:37] like me
[2:23:42] and he made a christian out of me
[2:23:46] and you want to say the days of miracles
[2:23:48] are passed there's miracles all over
[2:23:50] this building
[2:23:52] [Applause]
[2:23:56] he said look you believe that god can
[2:23:58] save anybody well that's far more
[2:24:01] miracle than a man that was dead
[2:24:05] a man that's dead and trespasses in sin
[2:24:07] a man that's dead and had to believe or
[2:24:10] remain dead then after you're born again
[2:24:12] you become a son of god how much more
[2:24:14] ought you ought to believe for a lesser
[2:24:16] miracle divine healing
[2:24:18] so if you can believe the god that saved
[2:24:20] you we ought to believe in a god who
[2:24:22] heals us
[2:24:23] [Applause]
[2:24:27] the greatest miracle ever performed
[2:24:30] is when god can take something
[2:24:32] and bring it back to li itself again
[2:24:35] just as he can take you
[2:24:37] in that dead wretched condition
[2:24:40] and change you and mold you and clean
[2:24:44] you and put himself in there
[2:24:46] that is the greatest miracle
[2:24:52] and he wants to do that tonight
[2:24:55] well i ain't never had that experience
[2:24:57] well he's here
[2:25:00] it's your turn
[2:25:05] my turn
[2:25:07] mine
[2:25:08] me yeah
[2:25:11] yeah yeah you're your turn
[2:25:14] your turn
[2:25:17] maybe you've been a hog
[2:25:19] but you don't have to remain one
[2:25:23] maybe you've been in pig slop but you
[2:25:25] don't have to stay there
[2:25:28] maybe you've been in the world and
[2:25:29] you've been so filthy and so tore up
[2:25:33] you don't have to stay there
[2:25:34] maybe your mind has been so tore up by
[2:25:37] satan's thoughts and things and he so
[2:25:38] convinced you that this word isn't for
[2:25:41] you and this message ain't for you and
[2:25:42] you're about to walk away you don't have
[2:25:44] to stay there
[2:25:50] he's here to take that away from you
[2:26:01] i remember a situation in my own life
[2:26:04] told it a couple of times
[2:26:07] but just personal testimony
[2:26:09] of my daughter being adriana been in a
[2:26:11] terrible accident
[2:26:14] and she went on a rip stick acting you
[2:26:16] know we don't have snow down south so
[2:26:19] she was on this rip stick acting like
[2:26:21] she was snowboarding on asphalt
[2:26:24] and she goes down the wrong way and
[2:26:25] can't make a turn so she goes down a
[2:26:28] real long pathway down to an end and
[2:26:30] goes tumbling
[2:26:32] at the end of the asphalt and 30 feet we
[2:26:34] had measured she went flying through the
[2:26:35] air and flipping over and over and her
[2:26:37] head hits up against a steel pole
[2:26:41] and i'm there and i'm watching it all
[2:26:42] take place we was there to be with the
[2:26:45] young people at the state park and
[2:26:46] flipping some hamburgers and i'm just
[2:26:48] praying god be merciful be merciful be
[2:26:50] merciful what nothing i could do
[2:26:52] i couldn't stop it if i wanted to
[2:26:55] and there were some girls down there
[2:26:57] where she landed and they began to
[2:26:58] scream for us to come and i went down
[2:27:00] there and there she's laying her head up
[2:27:03] against that pole and it's swelling out
[2:27:05] and
[2:27:06] i rolled her onto her back as carefully
[2:27:08] as i could because i didn't know what
[2:27:09] broke bone she may have or things i
[2:27:11] didn't know
[2:27:12] she's just grown and got that rattle
[2:27:15] i'm just saying baby talk to me
[2:27:18] adriana
[2:27:19] daddy wants to hear you talk to me
[2:27:21] and i'm praying
[2:27:23] and in my mind i'm thinking about when
[2:27:24] brother branham was out fishing
[2:27:27] and he's out fishing and one of his
[2:27:29] friends gets bit by a snake
[2:27:32] and he just calmly reaches over there
[2:27:33] and begins to pray
[2:27:35] and and god immediately took the
[2:27:37] strength of that venom away and healed
[2:27:39] the man
[2:27:40] he said lord we're not out here doing
[2:27:41] anything wrong we're out here enjoying
[2:27:43] nature that's what we were doing i said
[2:27:45] the same prayers the lord we're not out
[2:27:47] here doing anything wrong we're out here
[2:27:48] enjoying nature and fellowship together
[2:27:50] with believers
[2:27:51] and this accident has happened i need
[2:27:53] you to come by my way
[2:27:55] and then she begins to finally speak and
[2:27:57] she said daddy i can't see you and she's
[2:27:59] trying to open her eyes and they're all
[2:28:01] crossed
[2:28:02] and i see her eyes crossed really bad
[2:28:04] and i just begin to pray lord
[2:28:06] god come on the scene and uncross her
[2:28:08] eyes
[2:28:09] and i watched as those eyes would come
[2:28:11] straight
[2:28:15] and she
[2:28:17] she says daddy i can't see you and i
[2:28:19] said lord you uncrossed her eyes will
[2:28:21] you give her back her sight
[2:28:23] and she says daddy i see you now
[2:28:27] but she couldn't remember nothing about
[2:28:28] what she had happened what it was why am
[2:28:30] i here why am i dirty why my feet are
[2:28:33] they cut off what's wrong she could feel
[2:28:35] pain but she just had no clue why she
[2:28:37] was in the position that she was in she
[2:28:39] had amnesia
[2:28:41] and so we'd called for an ambulance and
[2:28:43] it was about 20 minutes away because we
[2:28:45] was way out the state park on this lake
[2:28:46] and so they're rushing and there's
[2:28:48] another brother that was there he calls
[2:28:50] my dad and my dad's studying for sunday
[2:28:52] and he's he's uh uh
[2:28:55] he just picks up the phone hears the
[2:28:56] news puts it down says lord let there
[2:28:58] not be one broke bone
[2:29:02] a few minutes the ambulance finally gets
[2:29:04] there and and and we put her in and as
[2:29:07] we're putting her in her mind begins to
[2:29:08] spark back to her and she said oh i was
[2:29:11] doing this and i was doing this we were
[2:29:13] doing oh i i know now and you can see
[2:29:16] lights coming on
[2:29:18] we just begin to thank the lord for what
[2:29:19] we saw and
[2:29:21] rushed her to they wanted to take her on
[2:29:22] to the hospital and so they rushed to
[2:29:24] the hospital sister ruth got in there
[2:29:26] with her and some of the other brothers
[2:29:27] and sisters there took the rest of my
[2:29:29] kids and i got in a van to go meet my
[2:29:31] father in a little town and was going to
[2:29:32] get together and go to the hospital
[2:29:34] together and as i'm driving i'm just
[2:29:36] thanking the lord for all that i saw and
[2:29:38] the miracle that had taken place and i
[2:29:40] just got my hand up and my tear i didn't
[2:29:42] know how i was driving
[2:29:44] and i'm just praising god for what i saw
[2:29:47] and out of my mouth i hear something
[2:29:48] speak and i really begin to realize it's
[2:29:50] my voice and it says what you've seen in
[2:29:52] the natural you'll also see in the
[2:29:54] supernatural
[2:29:58] and now it's just like a gong
[2:30:00] hit me upside the head i'm like what was
[2:30:02] that and i'm and i just began to again
[2:30:04] thank god okay god i don't know what's
[2:30:06] about to happen but i just want to
[2:30:07] praise you for it
[2:30:09] we go to the hospital and they do cat
[2:30:11] scans and x-rays and cat scans and mris
[2:30:14] and x-rays and the doctor finally comes
[2:30:16] in and he says look he says i can he
[2:30:18] said we have done so many really a
[2:30:21] dangerous amount of scans
[2:30:23] he said but we were so sure that there
[2:30:24] were broke bones we were so sure that
[2:30:26] she had a concussion we were but there
[2:30:28] ain't a sign of a broke bone there's not
[2:30:30] even a sign of a concussion
[2:30:34] it's all gone
[2:30:43] he said he said we're gonna have to keep
[2:30:44] her overnight because she was observed
[2:30:46] knocked out just to observe her but
[2:30:48] there's really nothing to worry about
[2:30:51] he said it's all gone
[2:30:53] and so i was actually had been preparing
[2:30:56] for sunday night the next night it was
[2:30:58] on saturday the next night to preach at
[2:31:00] our communion service and i had been
[2:31:01] looking on a thought on a guardrail we
[2:31:03] could we rely on now i didn't need notes
[2:31:08] sunday morning brother tim preaches i
[2:31:10] leave and go pick up sister little
[2:31:11] adriana and my and my wife go pick her
[2:31:13] up we bring her back to the evening
[2:31:15] service she's there in the evening
[2:31:16] service and i began to tell the
[2:31:18] testimony and i said i don't know what's
[2:31:20] about to happen but i know god is moving
[2:31:22] and god's going to move in a very
[2:31:24] phenomenal way
[2:31:25] because he said what i've seen in the
[2:31:27] natural we're gonna see in the
[2:31:29] supernatural and i said what i saw in
[2:31:31] the natural was a girl going down the
[2:31:33] wrong way going down to a bitter end and
[2:31:36] the destruction on every hand but in
[2:31:38] just a moment god turned it all around
[2:31:41] and gave her back her mind took away
[2:31:43] every sign of it it's gone
[2:31:46] [Applause]
[2:31:47] even just a few days every scar that had
[2:31:50] been on her body was completely gone
[2:31:54] it was a miracle
[2:31:58] by that next wednesday i began to study
[2:32:00] on a thought on spiritual identity
[2:32:02] crisis because of what had happened
[2:32:05] and i come out to preach and there's a a
[2:32:07] man about my age maybe a month older
[2:32:09] than me a couple months older than me
[2:32:10] brother phillip and he had been out of
[2:32:12] church for seven years and he didn't got
[2:32:15] to the place he'd come to some of our
[2:32:16] family camps some of our youth camps but
[2:32:18] he'd got to the place he said it ain't
[2:32:20] for me it might be for my wife it might
[2:32:22] be for my kids it ain't for me i can't
[2:32:25] live it i i can't do it i've tried it's
[2:32:28] dumb done i'm finished
[2:32:30] but that week god began to deal on his
[2:32:32] heart
[2:32:33] and just a few minutes before they had
[2:32:35] went out of that house to go to church
[2:32:37] he said if you'll wait a minute i'll get
[2:32:39] ready and go with you
[2:32:41] [Applause]
[2:32:42] well listen this mama and these kids
[2:32:44] have been praying
[2:32:45] later he would testify he wondered why
[2:32:47] his his mattress was so lumpy he said
[2:32:49] because there was so many prayer cloths
[2:32:51] under it

[2:33:14] and totally changed his life forever
[2:33:17] [Applause]

[2:59:09] [Music]
[2:59:11] but let me
[2:59:26] amen i shared this with your church on
[2:59:30] sunday brother kelly but
[2:59:32] we'd had a long day friday we had a
[2:59:34] wedding and
[2:59:35] saturday morning i got up and went out
[2:59:37] it was nice enough that i went out to a
[2:59:39] little area
[2:59:40] and just was burdening my heart before
[2:59:42] the lord
[2:59:44] and this situation and that situation
[2:59:48] and i just had finished praying and i'm
[2:59:49] sitting out there in the patio between
[2:59:51] the trees
[2:59:52] and i watched this bird coming across
[2:59:54] the sky
[2:59:55] and i could make out its features it was
[2:59:57] flapping and and i was it's crossing
[2:59:59] sort of from the west to the east and
[3:00:02] and all of a sudden before it goes
[3:00:03] behind the trees it sort of circles and
[3:00:05] i thought strange it's going back
[3:00:07] but it wasn't going back it started
[3:00:09] circling and it went up
[3:00:11] and it circled up once
[3:00:14] twice
[3:00:15] three times
[3:00:16] i started to lose the distinguishing
[3:00:18] features and and then all sudden it flew
[3:00:21] but at a higher level it was flying a
[3:00:24] little differently
[3:00:26] and i'll say this
[3:00:27] it that did something in my heart and i
[3:00:30] just said
[3:00:31] that's us lord
[3:00:32] we don't need to fight down here and
[3:00:34] slog it out we just need to allow you to
[3:00:37] take us a little higher
[3:00:39] and i believe god started a little take
[3:00:41] us a little higher today
[3:00:44] i believe that we need to allow
[3:00:46] ourselves to be in a position
[3:00:49] for a miracle to happen
[3:00:51] and you say lord you've let this you've
[3:00:53] let let let everything run out till
[3:00:55] there's only a little bit of oil and
[3:00:57] just a little bit of meal that's just
[3:00:59] the perfect place for god to come
[3:01:02] and so don't don't take what the devil
[3:01:04] says lord i don't know how you're going
[3:01:05] to do it but just start thanking him
[3:01:08] start allowing that
[3:01:09] let's let's sing a song we had a sister
[3:01:11] here
[3:01:12] sister tatusi i don't know if you
[3:01:13] remember sister emma but she sang a song
[3:01:15] god in your rivers you think are
[3:01:17] incrossable and she'd take the
[3:01:19] tambourine and she'd start singing that
[3:01:21] i think that was her signature song
[3:01:23] nobody could quite sing it like that but
[3:01:25] i think all of us together
[3:01:27] we could sing that
[3:01:28] and and put yourself in the equation
[3:01:30] here does that sound good
[3:01:33] let's just sing it brother michael lead
[3:01:34] us be of good courage
